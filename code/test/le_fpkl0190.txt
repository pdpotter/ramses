2 EXAMINATION

3 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

4 Q. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for being
5 on time. I think I was the last one here.

6 Good morning, Dr. English.

7 A. Good morning, Mr. Surprenant.

8 Q. Philip Morris has retained you as an expert
9 medical historian in this case; is that correct?
10 A. That is correct.
11 Q. And as —— I noticed in your report ——

12 strike that.
13 Now, you know, as a medical historian, that
14 smoking is the leading cause of illness, disease and

15 death in the United States, correct?

16 A. As a physician I know that as well as a

17 historian of medicine, it's a leading cause of death,
18 yes.

19 Q. And as a medical historian I notice ——

20 well, strike that.

21 I notice in your report you cite a number of
22 times to statistics and conclusions from the American
23 Cancer Society; is that correct?

24 A. I do, yes.

1 Q. And what is the American Cancer Society?

2 A. It's a voluntary public group that is

3 interested in promoting research, public education,

4 and lobbying for cancer in this country.

5 O. Okay. And, as a medical historian, do you
6 regard the American Cancer Society as a reliable

7 source of information?

8 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

9 THE WITNESS: Reliable in what sense?

10 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

11 Q. Well, do you regard, as a medical

12 historian, their conclusions about the link between

13 cigarette smoking and illness as reliable?

14 A. Well, you know, as a medical historian, I've
15 actually gone through the American Cancer Society's

16 annual reports for, oh, for 60, 70 years, and so they
17 have had a lot of conclusions about the risks of

18 smoking, especially for cancer.

19 So I would have to know the date, but I

20 do —— I think the American Cancer Society is a very,
21 you know, respectable organization. It's always had,
22 you know, there are three missions of education,

23 research, and lobbying, you know, forefront.

24 O. Okay. Now, on its current website that you

Page 9 
1 could go on and look at today the American Cancer §

2 Society reports that, on an annual basis,

3 approximately 443,600 people in the United States died

4 from illnesses relating to cigarette smoking. Do you
5 agree or disagree?
6 A. I have no way of independently verifying

7 that one way or the other, but, you know, I'll take

8 what the American Cancer Society says.

9 Q. And it says that smoking kills more
10 Americans than alcohol, car accidents, suicide, AIDS,
11 homicides and illegal drugs combined. Does that sound
12 approximately correct to you as a medical historian?
13 A. Well, of course, you're talking about 2010,
14 so that really wouldn't be my role as a historian, but

15 in 2010, I think that those numbers would be, you

16 know, in the ballpark.

17 Q. Now, before smoking, I mean —— strike that.
18 This is my first deposition in this case,
19 Dr. English, and this case has been going on a number
20 of years. And when I, as a lawyer, kind of parachute
21 in late in a case, I always feel as if I'm speaking a
22 foreign language that I haven't quite mastered.

23 A. Well, this is my first deposition in this
24 case as well.

ﬁm910§

1 Q. Yes, but you have had similar depositions

2 before. So I will try to make my questions as

3 coherent as possible.

4 The American Cancer Society points out that,
5 not only does smoking cause death, but it also can

6 significantly harm a smoker's quality of life while

7 the smoker is alive. Do you agree with that?

8 A. Again, we're talking about do I personally

9 agree with that or are we talking ——
10 Q. As a medical historian do you have a view

11 on that?

12 A. Well, again, you know, a historian looks at
13 things over time and you're asking a question about a

14 2010 website. So I think the way I would answer that

15 is that I would tend to agree with the American Cancer

16 Society's View on that in 2010, yes.

17 Q. Now, there is something that I didn't
18 understand until I got on this case, which was ——
19 other than in a very general way —— but what is

20 secondhand smoke?

21 A. Secondhand smoke, it's the —— firsthand
22 smoke is what a smoker gets through the cigarette

23 itself. And then when the smoker exhales, that is

24 part of secondhand smoke. And then there is also a

 

 

Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.
312-421-3377

388054?418
3990547418

Rme11
1 component of secondhand smoke that is being burned at

2 the cigarette that doesn't actually get inhaled in the

3 smoker in the first place. So there are two

4 components of it.

5 Q. Out of either end, as it were.

6 A. Well, one —— yeah, but one end also goes

7 through the smoker first.

8 Q. Okay. Now, the American Cancer Society
9 reports that on an annual basis 4,600 —— 46,000 ——
10 nonsmokers died from heart disease due to secondhand
11 smoke. Does that —— does that sound approximately
12 correct to you?
13 A. Well, I'm not sure about that. I think that
14 there has been a long sort of historical controversy
15 about how those numbers —— that particular —— those
16 particular numbers are calculated. So I'm not sure I
17 have an opinion about that. I mean, I'll take your

18 representation that that's what the website says, but

19 I'm not sure that I'm as comfortable with that number
20 as maybe some others.

21 Q. Okay. I understand that, Dr. English.

22 Let's see what we can agree on. Without tying you to
23 a specific number, even a general number, it is the
24 case —— is it the case —— that secondhand smoke kills

ﬁm912§

1 thousands, if not tens of thousands, of Americans a

2 year who themselves are not smokers?

3 A. I'm not sure I have an opinion on that.

4 Q. Okay. Would you agree with the American

5 Cancer Society that children are especially sensitive
6 to secondhand smoke?

7 A. I would ee I'm not exactly sure where the
8 Cancer Society is getting that, but I would say, as a

9 pediatrician, that I would agree with that.

10 Q. Okay. And you no longer are an active
11 practicing physician; is that correct?

12 A. That's correct.

13 Q. You retired from that in 2005?

14 A. That's correct.

15 Q. But for a number of years you had an
16 active, how do you say it, pediatric practice?

17 A. Yes, about 30 years.

18 Q. And you treated children to young

19 teenagers?

20 A. Well, actually I began in the prenatal visit
21 and then I would pass my patient on to another

22 physician when they graduated from college.
23 Q. Okay. And smoking is a problem in youths;

24 underaged smoking is a problem, correct?

1 A. It is. A
2 Q. And approximately 1 in 5 smokers begin

3 smoking in high school?

4 A. I'm not sure what the current number is, but
5 that would if that sounds about right.

6 Q. And would you agree that, as a general

7 matter ee well, strike that.

8 Do you agree that nicotine and cigarette

9 smoking are addictive?
10 A. Well, are you asking me as a physician?
11 Q. Sure.
12 A. Yes. I mean, and the reason I make a
13 distinction is that there is actually a long history
14 of how the public health community has viewed nicotine
15 and the addicting qualities of it, but —— so my answer
16 there is a little different because in one I have a
17 historical perspective, but if you're asking me in
18 2010, as a pediatrician, do I think nicotine is
19 addicting, yes, I do.
20 Q. Okay. And let me follow, kind of take a
21 segue from where I was going and try to understand the
22 distinction you were just making, Dr. English. What
23 is your view as a medical historian as to whether or
24 not cigarette smoking and nicotine are addictive? If

ﬁme14§

 

1 that is different from your views as a pediatrician.
2 A. Yeah. I mean, I think that physicians and
3 the public health authorities always understood that
4 cigarette smoking was hard to quit. And I think for a
5 very long time they have thought that nicotine was the
6 substance within cigarettes that was —— was largely
7 responsible. But when it came down to actually how do
8 you —— how do you define this, whether it's dependency
9 or —— how do you define this relationship between
10 nicotine and humans smoking, there the public health
11 community has had sort of a long history on how they
12 describe it.
13 So, for example, in the first Surgeon
14 General's Report there is a whole chapter that
15 addresses the question of whether this particular
16 group of experts in 1964 thought that cigarette
17 smoking was addictive. Ihey —— what they did was they
18 looked up definitions of addiction, which were based
19 on the World Health Organization, and they said they
20 didn't think so. I mean, it wasn't that they denied
21 that cigarette smoking was hard to quit. They didn't
22 deny that nicotine was the chemical that was
23 important, but when it came —— when push came to shove
24 their definition did not include the word "addiction."
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" 
312-421-3377
399%54-7’4—22

3990547422


Page 15 

 

ﬁme15§
1 They used the word "habituation." ﬂ

2 Well, since then, the World Health

3 Organization has moved in its definitions of

4 addictions and the Surgeon General has moved in its ——
5 I'm using "its" even because it's really a consortium
6 of people —— but in its definition, they reviewed

7 addiction in 1979, and it's really sort of a divided
8 opinion that some people think it was more of a social
9 habit, more people thought it was a straight—up
10 nicotine addiction. There is back and forth on that.
11 They reviewed it again in 1988, and then they

12 emphatically said that they thought that nicotine was

13 an addiction.
14 Q. And when would you say there was a medical
15 consensus that nicotine was an addiction, it was an

16 addictive drug?
17 A. It's hard actually to put a date, I think,
18 precisely on that. I mean, certainly by —— I think

19 most people would have said by 1988 there certainly

20 were people who were doing research in, you know,
21 especially in compensation about when, you know, when
22 a smoker moves from a higher to a lower nicotine

23 cigarette. People like Michael Russell, who, I think,

24 thought in the '70s that nicotine was an addictive

ﬁme16§

1 substance.

2 So I think it's hard to actually pin down a
3 precise moment when —— but that's how public health

4 consensuses are. Often it is not a precise moment

5 when that happens. But I think there was a spectrum

6 of that.

7 Q. Would you agree that the younger a smoker
8 starts as a general matter, the more that —— the more
9 addictive —— strike that.
10 Would you agree as a general matter that the
11 younger the smoker starts smoking the harder it will
12 be for that smoker to quit because of his or her
13 addiction to nicotine?
14 A. I really don't have a professional opinion
15 on that, I mean, and either as a historian or as a
16 pediatrician. I do know in my practice that some of
17 my patients who were smokers stopped and in fact

18 probably most of them stopped at some point. So ——
19 but I don't have —— I don't have an opinion about
20 whether a younger smoker has a more difficult time

21 with that or not.

22 Q. Okay. Now, are you aware of survey data
23 that indicate that —— you know, think back when we
24 were in high school we all thought we were

1 invulnerable and did some really stupid things.

2 A. I'm not sure I ever thought that, but I know
3 people use that expression, but at least my dealing

4 with teenagers they are beset with vulnerabilities,

5 maybe unrealistic ones if

6 Q. Well, they are. They are. But the point

7 is, is that, are you aware of a survey that a large

8 number of smokers in high school, underaged smokers,

9 believed that in five years they will be able to quit

10 smoking, and, in fact, the vast majority are addicted
11 smokers seven to nine years later?

12 A. I don't have an opinion on that. I'm not
13 aware of those numbers.

14 Q. Now, you're teaching a class this spring

15 called "Chubby History"?

16 A. I am.

17 Q. And I looked at the synopsis, and I think
18 you said that many public health officials believe

19 that obesity is the second most important public

20 health problem after smoking.

21 A. I do say that.

22 Q. And so do I —— I think I correctly inferred
23 that it is your belief, as a historian, that today

24 cigarette smoking is the most important public health

1 problem. A

2 A. It's certainly right up there as an

3 important public health problem.

4 Q. And Philip Morris, am I correct, that it is
5 far and away the leading cigarette manufacturer by

6 market share in the United States?

7 A. I don't know what Philip Morris's market

8 share is.

9 Q. Okay. But despite the health issues that
10 are caused by smoking that we've reviewed, it is your

11 View that Philip Morris and the other tobacco

12 companies are admirable companies, correct?

13 MR. ROSENIHAL: Objection to form.

14 THE WITNESS: I think you're referring to a
15 comment I made in another deposition. Is that —— am I
16 correct in that assumption?

17 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

18 Q. Yes. It was, I believe, your deposition in
19 the Miles case.

20 A. Yes. I did say that in the Miles case.

21 Q. And you said that under oath.

22 A. I did. But I think, as I remember, that ——
23 with that line of questioning, of course, the

24 deposition was on low—tar cigarettes, and I think, as

1 I recall, I took what I was trying to respond to was
2 in the sense that did cigarette companies respond to
3 public health concerns for them to produce low—tar

4 cigarettes. And I think the "admirable" was in that
5 respect. But certainly, you know, I've never studied
6 Philip Morris as a corporation. I'm not really

7 qualified to do that. And I don't know what Philip

8 Morris does on a day—to—day basis or year to year

9 because that's simply something I've never studied.
10 So I really am not in the position to say
11 overall whether Philip Morris or any cigarette company
12 is admirable or not. It simply is not something I

13 have studied, but my —— the way I was responding to

14 that was on the issue of whether their production of

15 low—tar cigarettes was viewed by the public health

16 community as admirable.
17 Q. Okay. Dr. English, let me mark as Exhibit
18 1 an excerpt from your deposition taken on October

19 21st, 2002, which is almost somehow eight years ago

20 already. And I believe Mr. Rosenthal was there.

21 MR. ROSENIEAL: That's correct.

1 Q. And I believe the excerpt that I'm going to
2 direct your attention to is complete. I don't have
3 the whole deposition because, as you might remember,

4 it was somewhat lengthy.

5 The first page is simply the beginning of
6 your testimony where you state your name and your
7 Social Security number. And then the examination that

8 I had in mind, I believe, starts at page 220 at the

9 bottom of what's also marked as page 159, quote:

10 Question. Do you consider the tobacco

11 companies admirable companies?

12 Mr. Rosenthal: Objection to form.

13 The Witness: Admirable companies?

14 Question. Yes.

15 Answer. They make legal products.

16 Question. Does that make them admirable?
17 Answer. Yes.

18 Does that refresh your recollection that at
19 that time at least your line of reasoning was that
20 tobacco companies were admirable companies because

21 they make a legal product?
22 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
23 THE WITNESS: I see the words on the page,

24 and I said it, but, on reflection, I think, I tried to

1 explain to you what I meant to that. I do see that

2 that's what I've said, but an answer, I think, that
3 reflected both my opinion then as well as my opinions
4 now is the one I responded to a moment ago.

5 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

6 Q. And that opinion with respect to whether or
7 not tobacco companies are admirable is ee what is that
8 opinion?

9 A. Well, my opinion, first of all, is I'm not
10 in a position to make a global statement because I
11 haven't studied any corporate —— I'm not a corporate
12 historian or business historian. So I'm not able to
13 analyze a corporate structure in any way.
14 Back in this particular deposition I was,

15 you know, I was there to talk about the development of
16 low—tar cigarettes and how the public health community

17 viewed them, and I took that as the thrust of the

18 question, but I certainly see the words on the page.

19 Q. Okay. Are you aware of any historian who

20 has published an article, the essential thrust of

21 which is that Big Tobacco companies harass historians

22 who testify against them?
23 A. I mean, there was an article in "The Nation"

24 about a month or so back that I've read. I can't

1 remember all of the details. Is that the one you're

2 referring to?

3 Q. Yeah. It was written by Professor Wiener

4 of the University of California at Irvine.

5 A. Uhehuh.

6 Q. And it addressed specifically what

7 Professor Wiener viewed as harassment of Professor

8 Proctor and Professor —— I will mispronounce his name.
9 MR. ROSENTHAL: Kyriakoudes.

10 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

11 Q. —— Kyriakoudes.

12 MR. ROSENTHAL: You have to practice that
13 one several times.

14 MR. SURPRENANT: Kyriakoudes.

15 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
16 Q. Yes. So that's the article. Have you read

17 that?

18 A. "The Nation" article?

19 Q. Yeah.

20 A. Yes, I have read it.

21 Q. And what was your view as a medical

22 historian about the reliability of Professor Wiener's
23 article?

24 (Exhibit No. 2 marked for identification and

2 MR. RQSENTRAL: Objection to form.
3 THE WITNESS: Reliability —— reliability in
4 what sense?

5 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

6 Q. Well, did you agree with his conclusions

7 that lawyers for Big Tobacco companies had harassed

8 the tobacco —— the historians who had testified

9 against them in litigation?
10 MR. ROSENTHAL: Same objection.
11 THE WITNESS: T have no opinion on that. T
12 don't know one way or the other.

13 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
14 Q. Okay. But is what I marked as Exhibit 2,
15 "Big Tobacco and the Historians," by Jon Wiener, is

16 that the article that you read?

17 A. I didn't see it in this format. I mean, I
18 read it in, you know, "The Nation" magazine itself,

19 so ——

20 Q. It didn't look like this.

21 A. It didn't look like that, so I'm not —— T'll
22 take your representation that this is the same one

23 that appeared in "The Nation," but I can't go beyond

24 that.

1 Q. I direct your attention to the last
2 sentence in the italicized kind of preface.
3 "This article originally appeared in the

4 March 15, 2010 edition of 'Ihe Nation.'"
5 Is that where you read it?
6 A. I think it was then. I would have thought

7 it was a little earlier than that, but I'll take that.

8 Q. If I could direct your attention to the

9 last full paragraph on page 2 —— and please read
10 whatever else you need for context —— quote —— this is
11 Professor Wiener.
12 "In these cases, history has become a key
13 component in the tobacco attorneys' defense strategy.
14 In the past, when smokers with cancer sued for

15 damages, the company said they shouldn't have to pay

16 because there was a, quote, scientific controversy,
17 closed quote, about whether smoking causes cancer.
18 But in recent years they have given up that argument
19 and now argue something like the opposite. Quote,
20 everybody knew, closed quote, smoking causes cancer,
21 so if you got cancer from smoking, it's your own

22 fault."

23 Do you have a view having studied and

24 researched around issues of smoking and the public

1 health community if Professor Wiener's summary that I
2 just read is accurate or reasonably accurate?
3 A. Well, I don't know what he's basing this on.

4 And I haven't been involved in all the cases, but I

5 think that if and I can't really talk about tobacco

6 attorneys' defense strategies because that's —— that's
7 a legal opinion and strategy. I can talk about how I,
8 as a historian of medicine, View some of these issues,

9 if that's what you want me to do, but I can't really

10 talk about legal strategies.

11 Q. Are you aware of something called the open
12 question policy or strategy of large tobacco

13 companies?

14 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

15 THE WITNESS: Can you be more specific as

16 the date and ——

17 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

18 O. Well, would you agree that big tobacco
19 companies, including Philip Morris, along with their
20 lawyers and publicists, had an open strategy campaign

21 from 1954 through 1999?

22 A. Open question strategy?
23 O. Open question strategy.
24 A. From what dates?

1 Q. Approximately 1954 with the advertisement
2 of a Frank Message to Smokers.

3 A. Frank Statement, yeah.

4 Q. Frank Statement, through 1999 that they

5 followed an open question strategy?

6 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

7 THE WITNESS: I'm certainly aware of the
8 Frank Statement. I think I am aware —— this is

9 getting somewhat distant, not things that I reviewed

10 for this particular deposition, but I believe that

11 there were some newspaper advertisements at a later

12 date about open question, but I'd have to actually see
13 one to recall it more fully.

14 So —— but I don't know anything —— I can't

15 really comment on a strategy because that's something

16 that I've not studied, so I don't know whether tobacco
17 companies or Philip Morris had a strategy as such

18 about that.

19 MR. SURFRENANI: I need to call my wife. If
20 we could take a short break.

1 Q. Okay. Dr. English, I will get back to what 4

2 you're an expert in, the scope of your expertise, what
3 you know about Philip Morris specifically, but let's

4 go back to 1988.

5 In 1988 you were a professor and a

6 practicing pediatrician at Duke?

7 A. Yes.

8 Q. Okay. And you were approached by a lawyer
9 named Murray Granick [sic] of this firm, correct?
10 A. Garnick, G—A—R—N—I—C—K.
11 Q. And Mr. Garnick at that time was involved

12 in defending Philip Morris in litigation, right?

13 A. Yes.

14 Q. And he was also involved in defending the
15 lead industry against cases of claims of lead

16 poisoning, correct?

17 A. He was in the same firm with lawyers who

18 defended lead. I'm not sure whether he did a lot of

19 work in lead, but, anyway, he was knowledgeable.

20 Q. And you ended up being retained as a

21 medical historian expert by the lead industry,

22 correct?

23 A. Yes, somewhat later in the mid '90s.

24 Q. And the substance of your testimony in the

 

 

Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.
312-421-3377

399a54?435
3990547435


Page 28 

 

Page 28 

1 lead poisoning cases was that the things that

2 plaintiffs were complaining about were publicly known;
3 is that correct?

4 A. Well, we'd have to go —— I mean, that's a

5 very complicated set of cases, and they are all

6 different. So do you have a particular case in mind?

7 I mean, my general task in that was that the

8 history of the evolution of knowledge about the

9 dangers of lead poisoning, and then the public health
10 communities' responses about what the —— what
11 Americans should do to lessen that. But that's, in
12 general, and that's really the same general task that
13 I've taken in the case like this one today dealing
14 with low—tar cigarettes is generally the accumulation

15 of knowledge about the risks of smoking and what the

16 public health community has recommended to do about
17 that.
18 Q. Okay. And so you were retained in 1988 by

19 Mr. Garnick.

20 A. Garnick.

21 Q. —— Garnick —— to do research into tobacco
22 issues?

23 A. That, including smoking issues. In other
24 words, my assignment was to look about the evolution

 

 

Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.
312-421-3377

398854?486
3990547436


Page 29 

 

Page 29 
1 of knowledge about the dangers of smoking and what the §

2 public health community advised it to do about that up
3 through the publication of the first Surgeon General's

4 Report in 1964.

5 Q. So your research from if and you worked on
6 it for about two years, correct?

7 A. About that, yes.

8 Q. And you never prepared a report.

9 A. I don't think there was ever a report
10 prepared. I know I didn't prepare a report, no.
11 Q. And am I correct in understanding your
12 previous deposition testimony that you weren't
13 retained for a specific case or at least it never

14 evolved into that?
15 A. Well, I think there was a case, the Haines
16 case, which was ongoing, and I hear that it may still

17 be ongoing, you know, decades later, but I think it

18 was in the —— the possibility that that case might go
19 forward was why I was retained, but, more generally,
20 it was a more open—ended type of assignment.

21 Q. And so you were studying the public health
22 community's positions on smoking and the dangers of

23 smoking from when through 1964?

24 A. Roughly 20th century.

399654743?
3990547437


Page 30 

 

Page 30 

1 Q. Okay. And one thing I hadn't learned, I

2 hadn't understood until this case, am I correct that

3 cigarette smoking is really a phenomenon of the last

4 century, in other words, there's very little cigarette
5 smoking before the 21st century?

6 A. Machine—rolled cigarettes, yes. It's mostly

7 1880's onward.
8 Q. And prior to that time obviously tobacco as
9 a product of the New World and Europeans used tobacco

10 then from the 1500's was principally cigars and pipes?

11 A. Or they —— yeah. In categories that —— or
12 chewing —— that we would probably list as cigars,

13 sometimes they were wrapped in paper, but mostly what
14 we would call cigars, pipes and chewing.

15 Q. A cigar is tobacco wrapped in tobacco

16 leaves?

17 A. That's my understanding.

18 Q. Okay. And then you worked for about two

19 years, and then what happened, did Mr. Garnick just

20 tell you to stop or what happened?

21 A. Yeah, that's about —— I mean, between then
22 and the late '908 occasionally we would have a

23 conversation, but I don't think I did any substantive
24 research between that time.

Rmes1
1 Q. Okay. And then in 2001, approximately nine

2 years after you stopped working, you talked to

3 Mr. Garnick again, correct?

4 A. In ——

5 Q. He retained you as an expert in 2001.

6 A. I think it was actually earlier than that.
7 It was in preparation for the Blue Cross and Blue

8 Shield case of New York and New Jersey, and I think
9 that case was in 2001. I may be wrong. I may have

10 been retained, let's say, 1999 or something like that.

11 Q. Okay. Now, you've been retained by either
12 Philip Morris or Philip Morris and other tobacco

13 companies or other tobacco companies on a number of
14 occasions, correct?

15 A. I have.

16 Q. How many?

17 A. You know, I don't have a number of cases
18 where I've been retained. Twenty? Twenty—five? I'm
19 sorry. I don't have a number.

20 Q. Okay. Well, let's try to help me —— I

21 don't really need reading glasses, but I wear them to
22 look smart.

23 A. I do need reading glasses.

24 Q. What happens at about age 43 a tiny muscle

MR. SURPRENANT: Oh, you wear reading
glasses already?

MR. ROSENTHAL: Uhehuh.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:

Q. Okay. You were retained by the joint

defendants in United States v. Philip Morris; is that

correct?
A. Yes.

Q. And the joint defendants were R.J.

Reynolds, Philip Morris, Brown & Williamson, Lorillard

Tobacco?

A. Lorillard.

Q. Lorillard Tobacco Company, British American

Tobacco, the Council for Tobacco Research, and the

Tobacco Institute; is that correct?

A. I believe that's correct.

Q. Okay. And you prepared a report in United

States v. Philip Morris?
A. I did.

Q. You were deposed?

1 A. Yes.

2 Q. But you did not testify at the trial; is

3 that correct?

4 A. That's correct.

5 Q. Do you know why you didn't testify at the
6 trial?

7 A. No.

8 Q. Okay. Do you know the outcome of that

9 trial?
10 A. Judge Kessler sided with the Department of

11 Justice.
12 Q. And she —— and do you know that, among

13 other things, she concluded that the defendants had

14 designed and marketed Light cigarettes in a deceptive
15 fashion?

16 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, form.

17 THE WITNESS: Well, I haven't read the

18 entire opinion.

19 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

20 Q. It's very long.

21 A. I have read the two to 300 pages that deal
22 roughly with issues of low—tar cigarettes. So 1

23 recall that she did make those conclusions.

24 Q. And you also were retained as an expert in

1 Miles versus Philip Morris? 3
2 A. Yes.

3 Q. And you were retained there by Philip

4 Morris?

5 A. Yes.

6 Q. And that was in Madison County, Illinois?

7 A. It was.

8 Q. And you testified at trial there?

9 A I did.
10 Q. And you also were retained as an expert in
11 a case called Turner versus R.J. Reynolds?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. And who was your client in that case?
14 A. I assume it was R.J. Reynolds.
15 Q. Okay.
16 MR. SURPRENANI: Now, let me mark as Exhibit
17 3 Joint Defendants' Expert Disclosure for Dr. Peter
18 English in United States of America v. Philip Morris,
19 which I will mark for identification as Exhibit 3.
20 (Exhibit No. 3 marked for identification and
21 attached hereto.)
22 MR. ROSENIEAL: Thank you.
23 BY MR . SURPRENANT:
24 Q. And the first few pages are the disclosure

1 and then attached to it is a certificate of service 4

2 and then a document called, "Rule 26 Expert Report,

3 United States v. Philip Morris, Inc., Peter C.

4 English, MD, Ph.D."

5 Did you draft the Rule 26 expert report?

6 A. I probably drafted all of it except putting

7 on the term "Rule 26 Expert Report" because I don't

8 know what that —— what rule that is.

9 Q. Dr. English, when I was in law school —— I
10 just went back for my 25th law school reunion —— I was
11 the articles editor of a student publication, and I
12 got a submission from a doctor in Germany, and he had

13 an MD and a Ph.D. and his letterhead said "Doctor
14 Doctor."
15 A. Sometimes it would say, "Er Herr Er, Doctor

16 Doctor."

17 Q. That's not your usage, I take it.

18 A. No.

19 Q. Now, I'd like to call out to you some
20 language that is in this report. It is in some of
21 your other reports, but then at a certain time you

22 stopped using the language. And that is at the first
23 page of your report, "II. Opinions and Bases

24 Iherefor," and it's in the second —— the second

1 paragraph, in part it reads:

2 Quote: I will underscore the necessity of
3 being comprehensive; of interpreting specific

4 statements, studies and documents in the context of
5 the time; and avoiding hindsight when conducting

6 historic research.

7 MR. ROSENIHAL: You actually technically
8 read that incorrectly. It's "scientific statements"
9 not "specific statements"
10 MR. SURPRENANT: Thank you.
11 MR. ROSENTHAL: —— for the record.
12 MR. SURPRENANI: When you get older, you

13 start typing different words than you think. I read
14 emails and they are ——

15 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

16 Q. Am I correct, Dr. English, that you burn
17 whatever neurons you have and it's downhill from

18 there?

19 A. I think that's actually something people are
20 debating still. There is some evidence that you can

21 actually generate a neuron or two at an advanced age.
22 Q. Okay.

23 A. And that, of course, is the hope for stroke
24 victims or motorcycle accidents.

1 Q. Well, my sister was telling me there are
2 different kinds of neurons. There are different kinds
3 of neurons and that neurons in your head are the same
4 as the neurons in your stomach. And she thinks in the
5 future they will be able to scoop up some neurons from
6 your stomach, put it through a centrifuge, and then
7 put it in your head, and you will suddenly probably be
8 hungry all the time.
9 A. I'm not aware of that. I'll take your
10 representation.
11 Q. Okay. So that language that I just read
12 was in your report for the United States v. Philip
13 Morris report, which we have in front of us.
14 Do you recall that you had identical
15 language in your expert report for Miles versus Philip
16 Morris?
17 A. I don't remember that, but I'll take your
18 representation.
19 Q. And then —— and then at some point you stop
20 putting that paragraph, specifically the necessity of
21 being comprehensive, you stopped putting that in your
22 expert report. It's not in your expert report in this
23 case.
24 Is that still —— but I take it that the

1 statement that, when you're a medical historian, there
2 is a necessity to be comprehensive, correct?

3 A. Yes.

4 Q. And what does that mean?

5 A. It means that I try to read as broadly as I
6 can. I use the tools of medical history in attempting
7 to identify the scientific studies and public health

8 organizations that are involved in this, but —— so a

9 sense of trying to understand the nature of how public
10 health decisions are made and the background, so ——
11 but that's in general what I'm referring to there. In
12 other words, not relying on a too narrow a base of
13 information.
14 Q. As a historian, what is the danger of
15 relying on too narrow a basis of information?
16 A. It would be that there would be some slant
17 to the interpretations drawn from that.
18 Q. You also have been retained by Philip
19 Morris in Schwab versus Philip Morris?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. You filed an expert report?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. You were deposed?

1 by Philip Morris in Price versus Philip Morris?

2 A. That's Miles, yes.

3 MR. ROSENTHAL: Same case.

4 MR. SURPRENANT: Oh, that's Miles. I see.

5 I got it.

6 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

7 Q. The judgment in the Miles case was a $10
8 billion judgment, correct? It was reversed by the
9 Illinois Supreme Court.

10 A. Yeah. It was reversed, I think, somewhat

11 emphatically, yeah.

12 Q. Yeah. And it included an award of two and
13 a half billion dollars in attorney's fees? Those poor
14 attorneys.

15 MR. ROSENTHAL: They are still appealing it.

16 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

17 Q. You were retained as an expert in a case
18 called In Re Tobacco Litigation in West Virginia?
19 A. I think so, yes.

20 Q. Do you recall who your client was?

21 A. I don't remember.

22 Q. You have been retained as an expert in a
23 case called City of St. Louis versus The American
24 Tobacco Company?

1 A. Et al.

2 Q. Et al.

3 A. Yes.

4 Q. And what is the nature of that case?

5 A That's a case where hospitals in the state
6 of Missouri are suing tobacco companies.

7 Q. For what? Do you know what?

8 A. I'm not sure of all the legal details, but I
9 think it is to recover monies that the hospitals spent
10 taking care of patients with smoking—related diseases.
11 Q. And I haven't yet read your report —— did
12 you prepare a report in the City of St. Louis?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. And I haven't looked at it yet. What, in
15 substance, does your report address in the City of
16 St. Louis case?
17 A. It, in general —— I mean, it's a very
18 detailed report —— it dealt with primarily with the
19 public health community and scientific communities
20 within the state of Missouri and their knowledge about
21 the dangers of smoking and the various programs that
22 they had in the state to lessen those risks. There is
23 also a section there both on sort of the understanding
24 that hospitals, both nationally and in the state of

1 Missouri, had about the problems with smoking.

2 Q. So I take it —— I've gone over the cases

3 that I know about that you've been retained as an

4 expert and I'm not near 20, so I take it there is a

5 number of other cases?

6 A. Yes.

7 Q. Can you identify those other cases that

8 come to mind?

9 A. There are a series of cases in New York City

10 that are ongoing. And I don't know if I know all the

11 names of them, but they are individual smoker cases.
12 Q. Are you involved at all in the Florida

13 tobacco litigations?

14 A. No.

15 Q. So, in addition to the cases that I

16 mentioned, there is a series of cases in New York that
17 relate to individual smokers suing tobacco companies?
18 A. Yes.

19 Q. And who retained you in that case?

20 A. Lawyers representing Lorillard.

21 Q. Okay. Now, I understand there is agreement
22 in this case that I don't want to obviously breach

23 that experts are not to be examined with respect to

24 their communications with the lawyers unless they

1 relied on that. a

2 And so, Mr. Rosenthal, please object and
3 tell me whenever I'm stepping over the bounds, but I
4 was just going to ask a series of questions about who

5 retained you, what did they tell you the assignment

6 was, just that kind of information.

7 MR. ROSENIHAL: And we will go on a

8 question—by—question basis. Give me, before you

9 answer, because you have a tendency to respond
10 quickly, give me a second to evaluate.
11 MR. SURPRENANT: Yeah, because I don't want
12 to step on whatever has been the practice.
13 MR. ROSENTHAL: Understood.
14 MR. SURPRENANT: Okay.

15 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

16 Q. Who retained you in this case?

17 A. James Rosenthal and George Lombardi.

18 Q. And when did that retention occur?

19 A. I think the first communication was in the

20 fall of 2009.

21 Q. And you talked to Mr. Rosenthal and

22 Mr. Lombardi, correct?

23 A. I talked with Mr. Rosenthal primarily.
24 There were one or two times when I've spoken with

1 George Lombardi.

2 MR. ROSENIRAL: Dr. English, I would advise
3 you not to disclose the substance of any

4 communications ——

5 MR. SURPRENANT: That ' 3 fine .

6 MR. ROSENTHAL: —— as opposed to the

7 existence of the communications.

8 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
9 Q. Right. Now let me try to get at it this

10 way. After talking with Mr. Lombardi and

11 Mr. Rosenthal, what was your understanding of your
12 assignment?
13 A. That it would be similar to what I had done

14 in Miles—Price in that I would be looking at

15 particularly how the public health community viewed

16 and supported the development of low—tar cigarettes

17 from, you know, roughly the middle of the 20th century

18 and to the end.

19 So in that case it would be really no
20 different from Miles—Price, but there have been eight
21 years or so since then and there have been some
22 developments and that I would in some measure extend

23 chronologically the scope of the report.

24 Q. Do you know what the class in this case is,

312-421-3377

399o54r452
3990547452


Page 45 

 

Page 45 

1 how the class is defined?

2 A. I believe the class is defined as all

3 citizens of the state of Missouri who purchased and

4 smoked Marlboro Light cigarettes for a period of five

5 years, and I think the dates are roughly 1995 to 2000,
6 but I could be off by a year or so.
7 MR. SURPRENANI: I think Mr. Rosenthal and I

8 can stipulate the period goes to about 2003.

9 MR. ROSENTHAL: Yes .
10 MR. SURPRENANT: Okay .
11 THE WITNESS: And then when does it begin?

12 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

13 Q. I believe 1995.

14 MR. ROSENTHAL: Although your collateral
15 estoppel case says '98, which confused me, but my

16 understanding was it was '95.

17 MR. SURPRENANI: You know, when we wrote
18 that brief, we were just new kids on the block.

19 MR. ROSENIHAL: I understand.

20 MR. SURPRENANI: I have to mention that to
21 ——

22 MR. ROSENIHAL: I mean, my understanding was
23 '95 to 2003, which is the same as yours, so ——

24 MR. SURPRENANI: Okay.

2 Q. And so what you did —— let me see if I can
3 summarize. You took a report that had been filed ——
4 prepared by you —— and filed in a number of cases,

5 largely duped and revised it, and then added

6 discussion to bring it up to the present; is that

7 correct?

8 A. I'm not sure what you mean by the word

9 "duped."
10 MR. ROSENIHAL: I was going to object to
11 form too.
12 THE WITNESS: By that, but, yes, I took that
13 form of that report as a base and then I made some
14 modifications to it, yes.

15 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

16 Q. I didn't realize "duped" can have very

17 different meanings. Duped can mean to trick someone.
18 I was using it in the shorthand phrase of duplicate

19 and revise.

20 So it's largely —— your present report is
21 largely a report that you prepared in other cases that

22 largely is repeated here and then you've brought it up
23 to the present; is that correct?

24 A. More or less, yes. I mean, there are some

1 things in the report that are different that don't 4

2 relate specifically to the period 2002 to 2010.
3 O. Okay. Let me try to now move to a question
4 to asking you about how you, as a medical historian,

5 go about practicing your expertise. And I'll tell

6 you —— have you read Professor Greenwood's report in

7 this case?

8 A. No.

9 O. She is also a historian. The scope of her
10 report is more aimed at information that was addressed

11 to the public as opposed to the public health
12 community, but she had a section which I noticed yours

13 didn't that talks about what the historical method is.

14 And 1 was going to ask you if you proceed as does

15 Professor Greenwood.

16 She said the historical method —— let me

17 just ask without reference to Professor Greenwood. Do

18 you agree that the historical method generally follows

19 the mode of the scientific method?

20 A. I'm not sure what she means by that.

21 Q. Okay.

22 A. Maybe she defines it in the next sentence.
23 O. Okay. Let me go on. This is going to be a

24 long question and then I'll break it down.

1 Do you agree there are four steps to the

2 historical method? One, the formulation of a research
3 question; two, searching out a wide variety of sources
4 that provide evidence to help answer the research

5 question; the review and analysis of the sources and

6 the development of a working hypothesis; and then,

7 finally, reaching conclusions based on sources. Do

8 you generally agree?

9 A. In general, yes.
10 Q. Your expert report contains a number of
11 conclusions, but it doesn't identify what the research
12 question or questions were that you were addressing.

13 What were they?

14 A. They were how the public health community
15 evaluated low—tar cigarettes as a public health

16 response to the knowledge that smoking cigarettes

17 causes diseases and kills. A subset of that is what

18 did they base their judgments that low—tar cigarettes
19 provided a reduced risk. Another question was how did

20 they go about informing the public about their

21 conclusions about low—tar cigarettes.

22 Q. Okay.

23 A. I may have forgot one in there, but that's
24 the, in general, the substance there.

1 strep, the common form of strep throat, and it's a ——
2 the body has an overreaction of its sort of immune

3 system and it attacks a variety of different organs in
4 the body, the heart being one of the more important

5 ones.

6 And what makes it a fascinating disease for
7 a historian is which 77 which target organs the body

8 chooses actually changes historically. It moves

9 around. And that's because it's responding to changes
10 within the strep bacteria itself ——
11 Q. Oh, that's fascinating.
12 A. —— but it's interesting, when someone asks
13 me about rheumatic fever, they almost say exactly what
14 you do. I had a father. I had an aunt. I had a
15 brother or sister. I mean, because it was a very,
16 very common, major illness in that period of time. In
17 the 1960‘s it was beginning to sort of go away, and so
18 he was really in the tail end of it.
19 Q. Yeah. And you've published a book on that.
20 A. Rheumatic fever, yes.
21 Q. And what other fields or areas have you
22 published in?
23 A. Well, all of my publications are in the
24 history of medicine generally. I have a book on the

2 lead paint poisoning. I've also written articles on

3 diphtheria and child abuse and some on the history of
4 pediatrics. Currently working on a book on history of
5 obesity, epidemic, focusing on children.

6 Q. The history of surgery, I take it, was

7 guite gruesome in parts?

8 A. My book?

9 MR. ROSENTHAL: On the reader or the ——
10 THE WITNESS: I don't know how gruesome it
11 was.

14 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

15 Q. Have you ever published —— I take it you've
16 never published on the impact of tobacco on health.

17 A. No. I mean, I have a section in my 20th

18 century medicine course on that, but I've never

19 published it.

20 Q. And you've never published on the tobacco
21 industry's claims about smoking and health.

22 A. No.

23 Q. Would you agree that, in order to reach
24 sound historical conclusions, the historian has to

1 make a systematic study of the issue under review?
2 A. Sure.
3 Q. Now, would you agree, with respect to ——
4 that the historical inquiry has to appropriately frame
5 the is the research question, correct?
6 A. Yes. I mean, we might have a discussion
7 on is given the topic ee what the appropriate question
8 is, what the word "appropriate" meant, but, yes, I
9 think so, yes.
10 Q. Okay. Let me try. I was trying to come up
11 with a couple of examples what I, as a lawyer, perhaps
12 using lawyer terminology, would say —— well, let me
13 just ask the question.
14 In the following hypothetical example, in
15 your view would the historian have committed a
16 mistake, and, if so, what kind of mistake? Let's say
17 a historian, a graduate student, Ph.D. candidate, said
18 that he wanted to study whether American slaves were
19 happy with their status as slaves or detested their
20 status as slaves, but he was only going to look at
21 slave owners' accounts of that issue and no other
22 data. Okay? So he was going to read what slave
23 owners said about whether they viewed their slaves as
24 being happy or not.

3990547460


Page 53 

 

Page 53 
1 Would that be a mistake in the historical ﬂ

2 method?
3 A. Well, I think this is where we get to the

4 idea of what is the appropriate question. If the

5 question is what were the perceptions of slave owners
6 about their slaves' happiness or not, then the source
7 material would appropriately look at slave owners.

8 Q. Okay.

9 A. If the question was, irrespective of what
10 slave owners said, what did slaves think about this
11 institution, then the appropriate sources would be

12 different.

13 Q. And so the way you would —— and let's say
14 it was the second, that the candidate said, I really
15 want to find out whether American slaves prior to the
16 abolition of slavery were happy with their status, and
17 I think the only source that I'm going to look at is
18 what slave owners said. I take it that that, the

19 mistake that that hypothetical historian would have

20 made, how would you describe it?

21 A. Well, I mean, it depends. And, again, you
22 have to get into the actual research because I would
23 imagine that some slave owners might actually be more
24 sensitive to what their slaves felt. So you'd have to

Page 54 

1 look at the source to see whether it was an

2 appropriate one or not.

3 This, of course, gets me very far afield

4 from medical history, so I'm not exactly sure what all
5 the available sources would be for slave narratives.

6 I know people spend their whole lives on slave

7 narratives, but I think there is a body of primary

8 sources of slaves and their recollections of slavery

9 that they probably would draw on.
10 Q. So would it be fair to say that in my

11 hypothetical the historian erred at least in part by

12 only reviewing a narrow and likely suspect body of

13 evidence?

14 A. Again, you know, I don't want —— you chose a
15 specific example there, and I don't necessarily know

16 if I can answer because I don't know that particular

17 field. I think it would be important that the
18 historian, you know, understand the sources that he or

19 she is dealing with and make the best out of the

20 materials that are available.

21 Q. Okay. Let me ask another hypothetical.

22 And, again, it's going to be as a non—historian, I

23 believe this hypothetical historian would be making a
24 mistake in the practice of history, and ask you about

1 it
2 In my hypothetical, the Ph.D. candidate
3 says, I have a remarkable thesis that anti—Semitism in

4 Poland between 1939 and 1945 under the Nazi regime was

5 almost completely wiped out. There was almost no
6 anti—Semitism in Poland in 1945. There was a lot of
7 antieSemitism, active antieSemitism, in Poland in

8 1939. So that means that the Nazis almost eradicated

9 anti—Semitism in Poland.
10 What mistake has that hypothetical historian
11 made?
12 A. Well, one of the things would be is that

13 there has been a body of historical analysis that has
14 a different point of view. There is also —— I don't
15 know what source materials. We'd have to question how

16 the Ph.D. student actually got to that conclusion.

17 Were there problems in that, you know.

18 Just looking at this on the surface of it,
19 you know, it seems like a very controversial

20 conclusion to reach. And so 1 think my antennae would

21 go up and want to know exactly how they reached that

 

 

 

 

 

22 conclusion.
23 Q. Right. Because what we all know is what's
24 missing is what happened is the Nazis eradicated most

1 of the Polish Jews and so there was no more target for
2 anti—Semitism.
3 A. Well, I don't know —— I think it's probably

4 more complicated than that, but ——

5 Q. All right.

6 A. You could be an anti—Semite without
7 necessarily having Jewish people right around.
8 Q. You have not made a systematic study
9 sufficient to form expert opinion as a medical
10 historian on what Philip Morris knew about the

11 delivery and health risks of Light cigarettes,

12 correct?

13 A. That's correct.

14 Q. You have not made a sufficient study,

15 sufficient to form expert opinions, on what the public

16 understood about the delivery and health risks of

17 Light cigarettes, correct?

18 A. That's correct.

19 Q. You have not made a systematic study
20 sufficient to form expert opinions on what Philip

21 Morris told the public health community.

22 A. No, I have not done that.
23 Q. You have made, I take it ——
24 A. I take it back. There are a few instances.

1 For example, in the Surgeon General's Advisory §

2 Committee in 1964, Philip Morris submitted a report to

3 the Advisory Committee in advance of the Surgeon

4 General's Report. So I do —— but I have not made ——
5 ever made a systematic, but I am aware of some

6 communications.

7 Q. Yeah. And I'm sure you have a lot of

8 opinions, just as I do, that aren't expert opinions.
9 In other words, you might even have opinions in your
10 field, but they are not expert opinions because you
11 haven't made —— you haven't followed a historical

12 method to reach those. So that's what I‘m really

13 focused on.

14 In other words, you may be aware of certain
15 communications Philip Morris made to the public health
16 community, but my question was, to be more precise,

17 and I think I understand your answer, but let me

18 re—ask it.

19 While you may be aware of some

20 communications that Philip Morris made to the public

21 health community on the topic of Light cigarettes, you

22 have not done a systematic study sufficient to form
23 expert opinions on that topic, correct?
24 A. That's correct.

1 Q. You also have no expert opinion on what 4

2 Philip Morris communicated to the American public on

3 the delivery and health risk of Light cigarettes,

4 correct?

5 A. That's correct.

6 Q. And same question for the Tobacco

7 Institute. You don't have an expert opinion on what
8 the Tobacco Institute communicated to the American

9 public on the delivery and health risks of Light

10 cigarettes; is that correct?

11 A. That's correct.

12 Q. What is the Tobacco Institute? What was
13 it ——

14 A. What was it?

15 Q. —— during its ——

16 A. It was an organization that attempted to
17 communicate with the public.

18 Q. And do you have an understanding of its
19 basic mission?

20 A. I don't.

21 Q. Okay. And I take it you have no expert
22 opinion about the effect on the public perception of

23 the delivery and health risks of Light cigarettes that

24 resulted from the Tobacco Institute's communications

1 to the public on that topic. 3
2 A. That is correct.

3 Q. I thought for sure, Dr. English, you were

4 going to say that is a long question.

5 You have no expert opinion on how Marlboro

6 Light smokers understood "Light" in Marlboro Light,

7 correct?

8 A. That's correct.

9 Q. And you have no expert opinion on how
10 Marlboro Light smokers understood the legend "lowered
11 tar & nicotine" on the pack, correct?
12 A. That is correct.
13 Q. Now, let me try to get my arms around —— I
14 love this case because I'm actually learning things,
15 which, as you get older, happens less and less.
16 Would you agree that a medical historian who
17 makes an appropriate study can reach expert opinions
18 on what information was available to the public health
19 community?
20 A. Yes, I think so.
21 Q. Would you agree with me that there is an
22 important difference between reaching an expert
23 opinion about what information was communicated to the
24 public health community and reaching an expert

1 opinion —— strike that. Let me strike that. 4

2 That was just about ready to go into the

3 ditch, if it in fact is not already there.

4 Would you agree with me that a medical

5 historian cannot opine on what any individual member
6 of the public health community thought unless that

7 expert talked to that individual, correct?

8 A. This gets complicated because a member of
9 the public health community could be a person. A
10 member could be an organization. And so we would need
11 more specificity. Generally historians have trouble
12 getting into intent. They can look at the
13 communication, but, you know the intent is hard —— is

14 very hard to get at.

15 Q. Well, let me try to get at it this way. As
16 a medical historian, you can identify what the public
17 health community —— what information it had available
18 to it, but neither as to any individual member of that
19 community or as to the community as a whole can you

20 opine on how they understood the information that was

21 available.

1 public health community —— let's turn it back to the
2 case that we were talking about this morning ——

3 actually explained what —— why they reached a certain
4 conclusion.

5 So, in that sense, I think I would be able
6 to say I know, you know, how they understood this

7 particular topic.

8 If you take, go back to the psychological
9 notion, you know, what's going on in their heads, I

10 can't do that, but I think many of the public health

11 organizations, they just don't say, we support Light

12 cigarettes. They actually go and say —— or they don't
13 say "light," they say low—tar cigarettes —— but they
14 give a reason for that. And I think the reasons that
15 they provide does give insight as to how they process
16 that information.

9 then there is front views and partially —— basically
10 front views —— of the Marlboro Light box compared next
11 to a Red, Marlboro Red, and then there is a close—up
12 of the Marlboro Lights, lowered tar and nicotine.
13 MR. ROSENTRAL: Just as a preliminary
14 matter, I have a foundational objection, I think, to
15 any questioning based on this because it does not
16 provide sufficient information, such as the year in

17 which this supposed pack that is photographed here was

18 manufactured, and things of that nature.

19 MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. Well, let me press
20 on.

21 MR. ROSENTHAL: Sure.

22 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
23 Q. Did you ever in your research try to obtain

24 the Marlboro Light box and try to determine if the

1 shape, the look or the language on the box ever 4

2 changed?

3 A. I didn't.

4 Q. Okay. So the reason —— really the reason
5 that I *7 to go to a question I asked a little while
6 ago, and to continue to try to kind of research, I

7 mean, refine this issue of the difference between

8 available —— information that was available and how
9 that information was understood from a historical
10 point of view, you have no expert opinion on how a

11 Marlboro Light cigarette smoker looking at this box

12 would have understood "Lights" to mean.

13 A. I don't.

14 Q. And you have no expert opinion on how they
15 would have understood "lowered tar and nicotine,"

16 correct?

17 A. No.

18 Q. Okay. Now, same question with respect to
19 the public health community. Do you have an expert
20 opinion on how the public health community understood
21 "Lights" on the Marlboro Lights box?

22 A. As far as I can recall, sitting here today,
23 I don't recall a discussion in the public health

24 community about the front of a cigarette box. The

1 public health community was very concerned about the
2 warning labels that occurred on the side of the boxes.
3 I can't —— I don't recall a discussion talking about

4 sort of the front of the box or the side of the box

5 or is

6 O. Well, let me re—ask the question. Do you
7 have an expert opinion on what the public health

8 community understood the term "light" to mean in the

9 phrase "Marlboro Lights"?
10 A. In the phrase "Marlboro Light," no.
11 Q. Okay. Do you have an expert opinion on

12 what the public health community understood the legend

13 on the box "lowered tar & nicotine" to mean?

14 A. No.

15 MR. SURPRENANI: Okay. I promised we would
16 take a morning break.

17 VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record at 10:21.

18 (Proceedings recessed.)

19 VIDEOGRAPHER: Going on the record, this is

20 the beginning of Tape 2, Volume I, in the deposition
21 of Dr. England —— English. On the record at 10:30.
22 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

23 O. Dr. English, you're a very experienced

24 deposition witness, so let me call out something that

312-421-3377

399e54r4r2
3990547472


Page 65 

 

1 I'm absolutely sure you already know. If at any point Rw665§
2 in a deposition it occurs to you that you need to

3 modify, you have something to add or you'd like to

4 modify previous testimony, just call that out to me.

5 So you always have the option of amending or

6 correcting any previous testimony, if it occurs to you
7 that it needs to be done.

8 Okay. You are not an expert in surveys.

9 A. I don't take surveys. I mean, I certainly
10 have —— I read a lot of the surveys, and I think I
11 know how to interpret them, depends on the survey, I
12 guess, but I don't take surveys, no.
13 Q. And you would not —— if you read a survey,
14 you wouldn't have expertise to determine independently
15 whether that survey was reliable or unreliable,
16 correct?
17 A. What I would probably do, because certainly
18 that would cross my mind would be, if I knew something
19 about the organization taking the survey. I mean, if
20 it was a Gallup organization survey, for example, I
21 would probably think that that would be —— would
22 likely be more reliable than an organization I didn't
23 know.
24 Q. Right. And I understand that, and I would

1 make a similar —— a similar distinction, but I'm

2 asking —— I take it, as an expert medical historian,

3 you do not have the training or experience to

4 independently reach an expert conclusion as to whether
5 any particular survey is reliable or unreliable.

6 A. I think that's fair.

7 Q. Okay. Same question with respect to

8 polling.
9 A. Again, I read polls and I would, You know,

10 defer to the organization producing the poll, but I

11 don't take —— I mean, I don't actually conduct polls.
12 Q. And you, as an expert medical historian, do
13 not have the training or background necessary to reach
14 an expert conclusion as to whether any particular poll
15 is reliable or not, correct?

16 A. I think that's fair, yes.

17 Q. You are not an expert on consumer behavior.
18 A. That is correct.

19 Q. You are not an expert on marketing.

20 A. That's correct.

21 Q. You're not an expert on advertising.

22 A. That is correct.

23 Q. This one I don't know. Are you an expert
24 on how people who are addicted to harmful substances

Page 67 

1 filter information so as to avoid cognitive

2 dissonance?

3 A. No.

4 Q. Do you have any views on how smokers filter
5 information about is to avoid cognitive dissonance on
6 the notion that I know tobacco smoking could kill me

7 and yet I smoke cigarettes?

8 A. No. I mean, I think the question is

9 complex, like what do I —— you know, who are the
10 smokers in question, but I think my answer would be ——

11 would be no.

12 Q. Let me kind of take a detour here from

13 medical historian expertise. When you were active in
14 your pediatric practice, did you ever have discussions
15 with your patients about, doctor, I know I smoke

16 cigarettes and I know cigarettes can kill me, but I

17 smoke them anyway, where you just anecdotally learned
18 information about how smokers deal with that cognitive
19 dissonance?

20 A. Well, as a general rule, I talk to my

21 patients about smoking beginning with a prenatal visit
22 and then with the actual patient every year at their
23 annual physical from prekindergarten up until the last
24 time I saw them. It was a standard part of my —— of

399o54?4?5
3990547475


Page 68 

 

Page 68 

1 my primary care, health maintenance visit. And, as
2 part of that, to get more directly to your question,
3 as part of that occasionally there would be an

4 adolescent who smoked. So I have a little sense of

5 that, but it would be anecdotal in the sense that it

6 would be based on relatively few visits.

7 Q. Okay. Prenatal, you mean you began 77 what
8 does "prenatal" mean?

9 A. It means that the pregnant woman and her
10 partner come in and talk about whether I'm going to be
11 their pediatrician afterward, any particular advice I
12 would have about especially the parents' behavior

13 before the baby is born.

14 Q. And you tell them —— you tell the mother
15 it's important not to smoke cigarettes.

16 A. Yes.

17 Q. And try to avoid secondhand smoke.

18 A. Yes, I mean —— right.

19 Q. Having three children, we always thought it
20 was okay to have maybe one glass of wine late in the
21 pregnancy. Were we right?

22 A. You know, the issue of fetal alcohol

23 syndrome is, you know, I think it's controversial.

24 The public health community has been, at least as far

Page 69 
1 as obstetricians, that they are —— they have come down 4

2 very hard about drinking during pregnancy. I'm not

3 sure that the epidemiology supports that hard of view.

4 I can tell you that we have one child and he was born
5 in 1977, and my wife's obstetrician gave the advice,
6 "lead a normal life," which is different from "you may

7 not drink."

8 Q. I see. I see. You have no expert opinion
9 on what Philip Morris knew about compensation and when
10 they knew it, correct?
11 A. That's correct.
12 Q. You do not have an expert opinion on why

13 Philip Morris developed Light cigarettes, correct?
14 A. That's correct.

15 Q. You do not have an expert opinion on

16 whether the understanding of the public health

17 community about delivery and the risk of Light

18 cigarettes had any role, played any role, in Philip

19 Morris's decision to develop and market Light

20 cigarettes, correct?

21 A. That's correct.

22 Q. Have you studied whether or not Philip

23 Morris developed Light cigarettes as a health

24 assurance product in an attempt to prevent smokers who

1 were concerned about the health effects of smoking 4

2 from trying to quit?
3 A. I didn't catch the question about —— I got

4 the predicate there.

5 MR. ROSENIHAL: Why don't we just read it

6 back.

7 MR. SURPRENANI: Why don't you read it back.
8 You know, there is no young associates here, so I

9 can't tell them. It's always a good idea to test how

10 good you are.

11 (Record read.)

12 THE WITNESS: NO.

13 MR. ROSENTHAL: A+ for the court reporter,

14 by the way.
15 MR. SURPRENANI: Very good. Off the record.
16 (Discussion was had off the record.)

17 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

18 Q. So you can't comment one way or the other
19 on the assertion that the reason Philip Morris

20 marketed —— developed and marketed Light cigarettes ——
21 was as a health assurance product, i.e., to create the
22 impression that there were fewer health risks with

23 Light cigarettes than regular cigarettes, correct?

24 A. Yes, that is correct.

1 Q. You would agree with me that, just because

2 one public health person knows a fact, that it doesn't

3 mean that all other public health officials know the

4 same fact, correct?

5 A. In general, I think that if if I'm

6 understanding the question, the sun is hot, one person
7 has, I suspect everyone would have it because it's so
8 universally known, but, are you talking —— can you

9 give me a specific that you're thinking about?
10 Q. Sure. That's an excellent —— an excellent

11 question, Dr. English. Just because one public health

12 community member knew a certain fact about

13 compensation, it doesn't mean that everybody knew that
14 fact about compensation, correct?

15 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection, form.

16 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

17 Q. Everybody in the public health community.
18 MR. ROSENTEAL: Same objection.

19 THE WITNESS: Well, I think it —— we would
20 have to talk about who —— which member you're talking
21 about. In other words, the Surgeon General in his

22 report, that's, you know, that's a member —— he's a
23 member of the public health community. "He," I'm

24 using the single again for the large. And if they

Page 72 

1 talk about compensation there, that represents, I

2 would imagine, a broader view than just —— just one

3 person, you know. So I think it depends on the —— who
4 you're —— who your individual member is.

5 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

6 Q. Okay. Do you know how many Marlboro Light
7 smokers in Missouri between 1995 and 2003 knew

8 anything at all about compensation?

9 A. Don't know.
10 Q. Do you know how many Marlboro Light smokers

11 in Missouri between 1995 and 2003 knew anything about

12 the FTC testing method?

13 A. I don't know.

14 Q. You had a younger —— you have a younger
15 sister who used to smoke?

16 A. I have two younger sisters who used to
17 smoke.

18 Q. And do you believe that your sisters

19 underestimated when they smoked how much they smoked
20 based on your observations?

21 A. I have no ——

22 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

23 THE WITNESS: I have no idea.

1 Q. Did your patients typically underestimate ﬁ

2 how much they smoked?

3 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection, form.
4 THE WITNESS: When they did —— the answer to
5 that is, I don't know, because our discussions were

6 usually on whether they did or did not rather than how
7 much or what their perception was on that.

8 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

9 Q. Okay. Do you have an opinion as to whether
10 smokers typically underestimate how much they smoke?
11 A. No.

12 Q. I don't have the deposition here,

13 Dr. English, but you don't recall testifying at a

14 previous deposition that one of your younger smokers,
15 you believe she underestimated how much she smoked

16 based on your observations of her smoking behavior

17 when you were at family gatherings?

18 A. You mean my sister?

19 Q. Uh—huh.

20 A. I really don't remember that.

21 Q. Okay. I think you've already answered this

22 question in part, Dr. English, but could you
23 specifically tell me what additional work you did on

24 the latest version of your expert report filed in this

Page 74 

1 case?
2 A. Well, because this case is occurring in the
3 state of Missouri, I did put some Missouri—specific

4 materials in there, not many, but there are some
5 Missouriespecific materials. I also added a few
6 materials in the 1970's dealing with public health
7 community and their understanding of compensation.

8 There is also, I think, one of those from the 1980's

9 as well.
10 I did make some changes in language in
11 response to the Supreme Court's decision in the Good
12 case.
13 Q. That's G—O—O—D?
14 A. Yes. And I believe —— I believe those are
15 most of them. Some more may come to mind.
16 Q. Didn't you also kind of bring it up to date
17 or had that been done in a previous report?
18 A. Well, you're right. I already mentioned

19 that. Yes, I did bring it up a little bit up to date.

20 I have a section on —— a couple of sentences —— on

21 what the European Union is doing, and I have a

22 statement about the law passed on Congress in 2009 of
23 transferring some of the authority to the Food and

24 Drug Administration.

Page 75 
1 Q. Now, in Europe, in UK, I know, for —— am I ﬂ

2 correct that in the UK, for some period of time, the
3 designator "Light" has been prohibited?

4 A. In the EU generally. And I think it's

5 somewhere in the '90s, but it could be later than

6 that, they have not permitted those kinds of

7 descriptors.

8 Q. And do you have an opinion as a medical

9 historian what caused the EU to prohibit the "Light"
10 designation on Light cigarettes such as Marlboro
11 Light?
12 A. I don't. I haven't done enough research in
13 there to know. I mean, I am sure they probably had
14 conferences on it, but I haven't read that.
15 Q. Am I correct that shortly in the United
16 States the "Light" term will be prohibited?
17 A. My understanding of the law by the FDA is
18 that those terms cannot be used until the FDA gives

19 approval of them.

20 Q. And do you have a view whether the

21 designation "Light" cigarettes has an inherent

22 tendency to communicate to potential or actual smokers
23 that there are less health risks than with a regular
24 cigarette?

 

 

Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.
312-421-3377

ssso54?4sa
3990547483


Page 76 

 

Page 76 

1 A. I don't have an opinion on that.
2 Q. Do you have an opinion whether the legend
3 "lowered—tar and nicotine" inherently communicates to

4 a potential or actual smoker that the Light

5 cigarette if the cigarette that has lowered tar and

6 nicotine —— is —— inherently communicates that it has
7 less health risks than regular cigarettes?

8 A. I don't have an opinion.

9 Q. How did you go about finding and
10 identifying the Missouri—specific information
11 contained in your report in this case?
12 A. Well, specifically I took them from my
13 report in the City of St. Louis case. Did you want me

14 to talk about how I generated the materials in the

15 City of St. Louis case?

16 Q. Thank you, Doctor. Yes.

17 A. This was a fairly big undertaking mainly

18 because many of the indexes which tell —— have

19 access —— provides access to materials for the medical
2O historian on a more general, larger scope, nature,

21 simply don't catalog all of the scientific, medical,
22 nursing, public health journals in Missouri.

23 And so I went about trying to recreate the
24 public health community in the state of Missouri,

 

 

Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.
312-421-3377

389854?484
3990547484


Page 77 

 

Page 77 

1 so —— I was interested in what the —— what the state
2 government was doing, what the City of St. Louis
3 government was doing in their departments of public

4 health. All of the voluntary health organizations
5 that we talked if we talked a little bit about the

6 American Cancer Society. All of them, whether it was

7 the Heart Association, Lung Association, Public Health
8 Association, all of those have local state chapters.
9 So I was interested in what the Missouri chapter ——

10 and it turns out, not only did they have national

11 materials that they distributed, they have their own
12 journal, they had their own educational materials that

13 they distribute. So it was a big undertaking.

14 Plus, just the state of Missouri has, I

15 don't know, six or eight medical journals. They have

16 a number of nursing journals. They have hospital

17 journals. They have hospital administrator journals.

18 The City of St. Louis has its own journals. So it was

19 a big undertaking that I tried to capture what their

20 understanding about the nature of the health hazards

21 of smoking.

22 Q. And did you receive assistance from anyone
23 in that big undertaking?

24 A. I did. I had a number of paralegals who

 

 

Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.
312-421-3377

seee54r4as
3990547485


Page 78 

 

Page 78 

1 came from one of the law firms and they worked under

2 my direction. I also made visits to a number of the

3 archives myself.

4 Q. Okay. And what firm did the paralegals

5 come from?

6 A. I don't remember now. As I sit here today I

7 don't know them. I don't know them.

8 Q. So let me see if I understand it.

9 MR. SURPRENANI: And, again, Mr. Rosenthal,
10 if you think I'm ever trenching on the agreement, let
11 me know.

12 MR. RQSENTHAL: Understood.

13 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

14 Q. I take it, to the extent the paralegals
15 identified materials that you believed was relevant,
16 you relied on those materials and included them in
17 your report.

18 A. My technique was, I mean, I wanted them
19 to —— this is a very —— very voluminous. And so I

20 gave them things like, if the word "smoking" appeared,

21 I wanted the full text, even if it had no bearing at

 

 

 

 

 

22 all.
23 And so probably the vast majority of the
24 materials they uncovered were not particularly helpful

399%54?48ﬁ

3990547486

Page 79 

1 in my enterprise. And then of those materials, you

2 know, I wrote the report, and if I'm understanding

3 your question, you're talking about the reliance ——

4 are you talking about the reliance in this case or in
5 the City of if we were in the City of St. Louis case
6 we were talking about. I'm not sure how ——

7 Q. Well, let's start with the City of

8 St. Louis.

9 A. Yes.
10 Q. And I understand that you had some
11 communication with the paralegals and then they went
12 out and presumably went to archives and libraries and
13 stuff.
14 A. Right. Yes.
15 Q. And then they brought you back what you
16 viewed as a purposefully overbroad selection of
17 materials ——
18 A. Right.
19 Q. —— which you then winnowed down to what you
20 thought was relevant and responsive to your historical

21 inquiry. And to that extent, to the extent you
22 thought it was relevant and responsive, and you
23 included it in your report in the City of

24 Los Angeles ——

1 A. City of St. Louis.

2 Q. —— City of St. Louis, I take it you relied
3 on the work the paralegals did under your supervision.
4 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

5 THE WITNESS: Well, I relied on the

6 documents as I finally sort of culled them, yeah.

7 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
8 Q. Uh—huh. And what is it you told the

9 paralegals they should be looking for?

10 A. I gave them just a broad, general list of
11 words, things like smoking, tobacco, the diseases that
12 were associated with smoking, things like, you know,
13 educational programs. There was a long list. I don't
14 —— I don't have it in front of me. But what I wanted
15 them to do was to be very inclusive and knowing that I

16 would probably not use most of what they found.
17 And how did I come up with the list? Well,

18 one of the things I did was, as I identified a

19 particular journal, I would ask them for them to copy
20 the entire journal —— that issue —— for a number of
21 issues. So I would get a sense of the kind of ways
22 that this particular journal or organization, the

23 kinds of things that they were concerned about so I
24 could then have them focus more particularly sort of

1 tailored for that particular source.

2 To give you another example, health

3 departments are interested in smoking, but where in

4 their annual reports the smoking section occurs can

5 actually differ. You would think there would just be
6 a smoking section, but oftentimes there is not. So

7 I'd have to actually go through a number of years and
8 say, well, what you really need to look —— this is

9 under "addictions" or something, and that's what you
10 need to do, or it's under "alcohol and smoking" and
11 some other substance.
12 Q. Do you know if —— well, strike that. Are
13 you aware of an archive called tobaccodocuments.org?
14 A. I am —— I'm aware of that, yes.
15 Q. And what is your understanding of what that
16 archive is?
17 A. I don't usually go to that for —— because I
18 believe those are —— mostly deals with documents that
19 come from the —— from litigation and deal with tobacco
20 companies, and so I normally don't consult that.
21 Q. Did you consult tobaccodocuments.org for
22 your work in this case?
23 A. I'm hesitating here. I personally did not.
24 I have a research assistant who dealt with me, and

1 there were a couple of articles that Dr. Burns cited Rm682§
2 in his report that I did not have. And because he had

4 least look at them. And I'm not sure whether she got
5 them from that particular website.

6 Q. Okay. Who is that research assistant?

7 A. Her name?

8 Q. Yeah.

9 A. Betsy Adams.
10 Q. And where does she work?
11 A. She's a retired medical reference librarian.
12 Q. I see. Why do you not rely or why have you
13 not used tobaccodocuments.org in your expert work on
14 your cases dealing with tobacco issues?
15 A. Well, my task has been to look at what the
16 scientific and public health communities knew and
17 understood about the value of low—tar cigarettes. And
18 so I have focused primarily on the published
19 scientific literature or educational materials from
20 the Cancer Society, materials that the Surgeon General
21 has put out. I have not focused on any kind of
22 internal documents of Philip Morris or any other
23 company.
24 Q. But it is not the case, is it, that

Page 83 

1 tobaccodocuments.org only contained private internal
2 documents from the tobacco companies, correct?
3 A. I have not searched that, so I can't tell

4 you all the things that are in there, but I can tell

5 you that most of the es I think virtually all of the

6 documents that I have used have come through other

7 databases.

8 Q. Is one of the reasons that you have not

9 relied or not examined the documents in
10 tobaccodocuments.org is because one of the lawyers for

11 Philip Morris told you strategically you should not do

12 that?

13 A. No one's ever told me that.
14 Q. I take it you yourself have never gone —— I
15 take it you could get on tobaccodocuments.org just by

16 putting that in the Internet search site and it would

 

 

 

 

 

17 come up.
18 A. I assume.
19 Q. Okay. How do you know what's in —— how do
20 you know what's in tobaccodocuments.org if you've
21 never done that?
22 A. I haven't done it. I've just heard that
23 they have a lot of company material, but I haven't
24 gone to the website so I don't —— I don't know what's

1 in it.

2 Q. Am I correct that archives are typically a
3 primary and valuable resource that historians consult?
4 A. Of course.

5 Q. And you have consulted either directly or

6 through your research assistants archives for your

7 work in the tobacco cases, correct?

8 A. The archive that I dealt with in detail was
9 the one —— the Lewis Robbins archive at Johns Hopkins.
10 Q. The Lewis ——
11 A. Robbins. He was the head of the cancer
12 control program of the National Cancer Institute and

13 the U.S. Public Health Service from sort of 1957

14 through ‘65, I believe.

15 Q. I've always wondered why there is an S

16 after John in Johns Hopkins.

17 A. In Hopkins? Because that's his name. There
18 is a Quaker version of John that has a plural —— has

19 an S at the end. It is not a plural. It's an S. So

20 there are not two John Hopkins.

21 Q. How many paralegals assisted you in the
22 City of St. Louis on the Missouri specific?

23 A. I'm going to say two or three.

24 Q. And how long duration was that work?

1 A. Their part? I'm going to say around six

2 months.

3 Q. And do you know who was paying them? I

4 take it you weren't.

5 A. I wasn't.

6 Q. And then what you did in this case is you
7 looked 7* you got your report ee when did you prepare

8 the report for the City of St. Louis case?

9 A. Well, I was deposed a year or a year and a
10 half ago, so it would have been before that, so I'm
11 going to say somewhere around maybe 2005 or six.

12 Q. And then when you were retained in this

13 case you then looked to your report in the City of

14 St. Louis case and adapted some of the

15 Missouri—specific discussion?

16 A. I did.

17 Q. Did you do any additional Missouri—specific
18 work?

19 A. No.

20 Q. Okay. Now, you said you added an incident
21 in the '70s and another one in the '80s on the public
22 health community's understanding of compensation. How
23 did you identify those sources?

24 A. Those were already in my —— in my file in

 

 

Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.

Page 86 
1 the office, and I was just pulling them out because I §

2 knew that what the public health community knew about

3 compensation in the '70s might be of an issue in this

4 case.

5 Q. So those 77 those files, those documents,

6 were pre—existing in files that you had been

7 accumulating over the years in your office as part of

8 your retention by the tobacco companies?

9 A. Yes. I have a chronology file in my office.
10 Q. Now, what was the selection process that
11 led to those documents going to your chronology file?
12 A. I added a couple of documents. I mean,

13 there is some that were from the federal government

14 and there were pamphlets. I think in the original

15 report I had mentioned just one pamphlet and I think

16 now I have mentioned three or four different pamphlets
17 from the same area in the first —— in 1970's, '71,

18 '72, '73, in there.

19 I have a copy of the second World Conference

20 on smoking and health, and I added something, a

21 quotation, from Michael Russell from that regard. I
22 had some National Institute of Drug Addiction

23 documents, and, again, those —— I added a couple

24 quotes from there as well.

Page 87 
1 Q. But how did you first come into —— how did A

2 you first identify those sources to get them into your
3 chronology file?

4 A. Well, probably for each one there would be a
5 different way. I think the U.S. if the Institute of

6 Drug Addiction, National Institute of Drug Addiction,

7 I think I acquired those in the DOJ case dealing with

8 the issue of addiction.
9 The World Health —— I mean the World
10 Conferences, I can't remember whether I —— at what
11 stage I got them. There are several World Conferences

12 that were held in the period of the 1960‘s and 1970's.

13 I think they go into the 1980's. And I have parts of

14 those transcripts there. Different ways.

15 Q. All right. Dr. English, you have never
16 made a systematic analysis of statements of Philip
17 Morris or the Tobacco Institute to the public about
18 smoking, have you.

19 A. No.

20 Q. And you have no expert opinion on that

21 topic.

 

 

 

 

 

22 A. I don't.
23 Q. In preparing the expert report you prepared
24 in this case, have you performed your analysis at the
Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.
312-421-3377

Page 88 

1 same level of objectivity and rigor that you would use
2 in writing a professional article for a peer—reviewed

3 journal?

4 A. I approached this whole process with that in
5 mind, but also really even a step further as a book in
6 the sense that the materials, you know, it's more

7 encompassing than a single article would be.

8 Q. Now, I'm trying to formulate this question,

9 Dr. English. Virtually everything that you quote that
10 occurred prior to the Tobacco Institute being

11 disbanded that called out the danger of smoking or

12 related topics, I could get a contemporaneous report
13 from the Tobacco Institute trying to undermine that

14 communication or similar communications. And as a

15 matter of historical practice, why did not your

16 analysis include what the Tobacco Institute was doing
17 to try to undermine information suggesting that

18 smoking regular cigarettes or smoking Light cigarettes
19 could kill you or give you disease?

20 MR. ROSENTEAL: I object to the form and

21 lack of foundation, both as to the question and the
22 lengthy preface before it.
23 You may answer.

24 THE WITNESS: Well, I have not looked at the

3990547496

Page 89 

1 Tobacco Institute documents. My focus has been on the
2 medical community and public health community and what
3 their communications were.

4 Now, in the course of that many years, I

5 mean, I've read a lot of newspaper accounts and

6 occasionally I would see a Tobacco Institute comment,
7 so I'm not totally unaware of some of the things that
8 they were saying, but I've never done a systematic

9 search in their documents or their communications.

10 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

11 Q. Well, do you have —— do you believe that
12 there is a likelihood that, if you were to analyze in
13 a systematic way, communications of the Tobacco

14 Institute to the public health community, that you

15 would find a decades—long program of what you would
16 consider professionally to be disinformation?

17 MR. ROSENTHAL: Object to the form.

18 THE WITNESS: You know, I —— I don't know
19 exactly what you mean by "disinformation," but let me

20 just step back. You know, I've read a lot of public

21 health information, and I don't think I can recall a
22 single time when, let's say, the Surgeon General said,
23 you know, we rely on the Tobacco Institute for A, B or
24 C. I mean, they aren't cited, I mean. So I think

sooo54r4s?
3990547497


Page 90 

 

Page 90 

1 from that point of View they are probably irrelevant.

2 Now, so in your question —— but part of your
3 question I thought also implied, you know,

4 communications that might be read by the general

5 public, because the second part dealt with the public
6 health community, which I do know something about.

7 How the public process snippets in the newspaper from
8 the Tobacco Institute, I don't know.

9 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
10 Q. Right. You have no expert opinion on how
11 communications from the tobacco industry,
12 specifically, the Tobacco Institute specifically or

13 the tobacco industry more generally, affected public

14 perceptions about the health risk of smoking including
15 smoking Light cigarettes, correct?

16 MR. ROSENTHAL: Object to form.

17 THE WITNESS: What the Tobacco Institute

18 said? I haven't studied the Tobacco Institute, so I
19 have no —— no professional opinion on that.

20 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

21 Q. Right. And how their communications

22 affected public perceptions about the risks of smoking
23 Light cigarettes, correct?

24 A. I'm not doing anything here on consumer

1 perception.

2 Q. We've talked around this issue,

3 Dr. English, and so I would make an objection to my

4 own question as asked and answered in part, but let me
5 try to exhaust you on this topic.

6 Why did you determine that you would not

7 examine in a comprehensive way consistent with the

8 rigor required of a medical historian to determine

9 what the tobacco industry in general and Philip Morris
10 in particular communicated to the public health
11 community about the relative delivery and risk of
12 Light cigarettes versus non—Light cigarettes?
13 A. The way I define my historical question was

14 what the public health community and what the

15 scientific communities knew about this. I didn't

16 include in my historical question what a manufacturer
17 knew.

18 Q. You read several hundred pages of Judge

19 Kessler's opinion in United States v. Philip Morris.

20 Did you say that?

 

 

 

 

 

21 A. I did.
22 Q. Did you read the decision by the Court of
23 Appeal —— of Appeals for the District of Columbia
24 affirming her decision?
Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.
312-421-3377
399D54?499

3990547499


Page 92 

 

Page 92 

1 A. No.

2 Q. Okay. But what you read is you focused on
3 her discussion of Light cigarettes, correct?

4 A. Yes.

5 Q. And that ran into several hundred pages.

6 A. I believe so, yes.

7 Q. And one of her conclusions was that the

8 tobacco defendants, including Philip Morris,

9 fraudulently or deceptively marketed their Light

10 cigarettes, correct?

11 A. I believe that's correct.

12 Q. And did you agree? Did you find yourself
13 agreeing with her, disagreeing, or not having an

14 expert opinion on that topic?

15 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection to form.

16 THE WITNESS: That's not an area that I've
17 studied, so I don't have an opinion.

18 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
19 Q. There is a jurisprudential writer,
20 Dr. English, called —— oh, that neuron has died ——

21 Ronald Dawkin, D—A—W—R—I—N. And before there was

22 Google, he kind of invented, as a heuristic device, as
23 a teaching device, what later effectively became
24 Google and that is a character named Hercules. And

 

 

Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.
312-421-3377

sooo54rsoo
3990547500


Page 93 

 

Page 93 

1 Hercules knows everything that we can know. He is not
2 omniscient, like God, but he knows everything that

3 humans can know.

4 And so I'm going to use an example, and

5 that's now Google is that has become Google. So I'm

6 going to give you a hypothetical involving Hercules.

7 In other words, Hercules is unfailingly accurate about
8 anything humans could know.

9 So if Hercules was to tell you that Philip
10 Morris fraudulently and deceptively manufactured and

11 marketed Marlboro Lights, would that fact which you

12 have to accept as accurate and well—founded, have any
13 effect on the expert conclusions you have reached in

14 this case?

15 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

16 THE WITNESS: Well, I mean, I don't know how
17 Hercules reached their conclusion, so whether this is
18 based on an opinion, whether it was —— I don't know

19 what time frame we're talking about here, and I

20 certainly don't think either you or I would put Judge
21 Kessler in the role of Hercules.

22 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

23 Q. That's why I didn't use Judge Kessler.

24 Well, let me ask you. Do you have any reason to

 

 

Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.
312-421-3377

3990547501


Page 94 

 

Page 94 
1 question the accuracy and the reliability of the §

2 findings that Judge Kessler made about how Philip
3 Morris and the other tobacco defendants developed and

4 marketed Light cigarettes?

5 A. I have no way of making ee having an opinion
6 on that because that's not something I've studied.

7 And she obviously was reaching a legal conclusion, and
8 that's another reason —— I'm not a lawyer, so I don't

9 know whether she used the evidence before her and
10 arguments in an appropriate way or not.
11 Q. Okay. Fair enough. That's why I used
12 Hercules. So forget fraudulent, which carries a legal
13 connotation, but Hercules, who we know is unfailingly
14 accurate, reached the conclusion that Philip Morris

15 marketed Marlboro Lights in a deceptive fashion that
16 actually materially deceived Marlboro Light smokers
17 from the inception of its marketing campaign until

18 approximately 2002. Would that have any impact on any

19 expert opinion you have reached in this case?

20 MR. ROSENIHAL: Objection to form.

21 THE WITNESS: Well, you know, I focused on
22 the medical and public health communities, and they
23 reached their conclusions supporting low—tar

24 cigarettes as a third—tier public health

1 recommendation irrespective of any marketing decisions §

2 that Philip Morris did. They didn't refer to Philip

3 Morris as far as I can tell in any, so I don't believe
4 it would have made —— would make any difference on my
5 conclusions.

6 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

7 Q. You are aware, are you not, that there is

8 an allegation that the tobacco industry, including

9 Philip Morris, manipulated the FTC decision in a way
10 that led them to approve and make decisions about the
11 testing method for tar and nicotine and for what could
12 be communicated to smokers about those results? I'm

13 not saying you agree with that allegation, but have

14 you looked into that allegation?

15 A. Well, are you referring to the 1966—1967

16 period? Is that what you're referring to.

17 Q. Among others ——

18 MR. ROSENTHAL: I‘m going to object to form,

19 by the way. A little slow.

20 THE WITNESS: Well, I'm not —— actually I
21 don't know whether —— were the allegations, so ——

22 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

23 Q. Okay.

24 A. But I do know some of the —— the

 

 

Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.
312-421-3377

399o54rso3
3990547503


Page 96 

 

Page 96 
1 contributions to the FTC discussion about the adoption §

2 of the Cambridge Method. If that's what you are

3 interested in knowing about, it's in my report as

4 well. But I —— but maybe a follow—up question would
5 help.

6 Q. Sure. Sure. And maybe just answer this.
7 You were not aware of the allegation that the tobacco

8 industry manipulated the FTC into adopting what you

9 referred to and what was originally referred to as the
10 Cambridge Method that over time became known as the
11 FTC Method. You're not aware of such an allegation.
12 A. I'm not aware of the allegation, no.
13 Q. So you have no way of knowing if what the
14 Federal Trade Commission was communicating to the
15 public health community was deceptive because they
16 themselves had been deceived by the tobacco companies,

17 including Philip Morris.

18 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

19 THE WITNESS: I certainly haven't seen

20 anything that would indicate that. You need to be
21 more specific. I mean, the Federal Trade Commission
22 was pretty clear about what they thought about this
23 particular system. The Cambridge Method was highly

24 thought of before they adopted it. It remained in

1 place obviously for decades.

2 But, again, you know, I'm aware of what

3 Philip Morris and other tobacco companies —— what

4 kinds of arguments that they and submissions to the

5 Federal Trade Commission, I mean, those documents have
6 been part of legal proceedings for really quite some

7 time, but, other than that, I can't as I can't *7

8 MR. SURPRENANT: Miss Reporter, could I have
9 my question and answer reread?
10 (Record read.)

11 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

12 Q. Okay. Let me try to get at the same
13 question. You have no opinion on whether

14 communications of the FTC to the public health

15 community on the delivery and health risks of Light

16 cigarettes was deceptive because the Federal Trade

17 Commission itself had been misled by the tobacco

18 industry, correct?

19 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form, vague.
20 THE WITNESS: I'm unaware of any

21 communications —— that's something I've not studied ——
22 between tobacco companies and the FTC other than ones
23 that, you know, are part —— that I cite in my report.

24 So I don't know anything about those.

 

 

Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.
312-421-3377

ssoo54rso5
3990547505


Page 98 

 

Page 98 

1 So I don't know anything about whether there
2 was any deception because I don't —— I can't get into
3 the mind of a tobacco company to know what their

4 intent is. I can't get into the mind of the FTC to
5 know how they are processing the information so are

6 they indeed deceived.

7 And so, you know, it just 77 and then it's

8 certainly about passing on deceptive materials to the

9 public health community, I have no way to know about
10 the intent of the FTC, whether —— what they were

11 trying to do or the perception of the public health
12 community. So most of the aspects of your question I
13 cannot help you with.

14 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

15 Q. Okay. I think sometimes I know in your

16 earlier deposition in particular somebody kept

17 haranguing you to give yes and no answers, and then,
18 if you want to give an explanation, and I think what I
19 just received —— and I say this politely —— was the

20 explanation.

21 I think the answer to my question is, no,
22 you do not have an expert opinion on whether FIC's

23 communication on the relative delivery and risk of

24 Light cigarettes was deceptive because it itself had

 

 

Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.
312-421-3377

39935452? 5116

3990547506


Page 99 

 

Page 99 

1 been deceived or misled by the tobacco industry,

2 correct?

3 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form and
4 characterization.

5 THE WITNESS: The best way I know how to

6 answer the question is the answer I've already given.
7 But because I haven't studied what the tobacco

8 companies have done, I really sort of have to stop at

9 that particular point. And rather than making a

10 comment on the double deception, because I —— or the
11 potential there, simply because I, you know, at the

12 start of the process there, I'm —— I don‘t have that
13 information.

14 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
15 O. Okay. Well, let's try to pursue this line
16 of inquiry. You were focused on what information was

17 available to the public health community on the

18 relative delivery and risk of Marlboro Light —— of

19 Light cigarettes —— versus regular cigarettes,

20 correct?

21 A. Well, now are we talking about the testing

22 program? That's what I'm ——
23 Q. I'm now making a more general statement.

24 Okay? You were interested in the expert historical

 

 

Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.
312-421-3377

399o54rso?
3990547507


Page 100 

 

Page 100 

1 medical —— strike that.
2 You were interested as an expert medical
3 historian on what information was available to the

4 public health community from the 1950's onward on the

5 relative delivery and risks of Light cigarettes versus
6 non—Light cigarettes, correct?
7 A. Well, it's actually broader. I mean, we

8 talk about the public health communities. They didn't
9 use the term "Light" cigarettes. What they would do
10 is talk about high tar, low tar, filtered versus

11 nonfiltered.

12 So, I mean, "Light" is a —— is a, my

13 understanding, is an advertising descriptor. It's not
14 a public health term. So they were interested in

15 evaluating the disease risks associated with smokers
16 who smoke one particular type of cigarette and then

17 comparing that to the disease risks of smokers —— of
18 smoking a different type of cigarette, a lower tar

19 cigarette.

20 And as their reference point what they used
21 was the FTC Method because that's —— that was their

22 relative way of comparing what would be a higher tar
23 cigarette versus a lower tar cigarette would be higher
24 in the sense that the cigarette smoking machine, the

3990547508

Page 101
1 Cambridge Method, had determined that one was higher

2 than the other.

3 Q. Okay. Let me, with your correction of my
4 terminology, try to state again what the scope of your
5 interest was as a medical historian in this case. You
6 were interested in what information was available to

7 public health community from the 1950's onward on the

8 disease risk that a smoker of a regular cigarette
9 would face versus a smoker of a lowered tar and
10 nicotine cigarette, correct?
11 A. In general, yes.
12 Q. Okay. And, as a general matter, until the

13 publication, Monograph 13, it is your opinion that

14 there was a broad understanding of the public —— in

15 the public health community that cigarettes with

16 lowered tar and nicotine as measured by the FTC Method

17 posed less health risk than cigarettes with higher tar

18 and nicotine, correct?

19 A. Yes.

20 Q. And the FTC Method tested cigarettes on a
21 machine, correct?

22 A. Of course, yes.

23 Q. And the machine did not compensate for the
24 fact that it was testing a lowered tar and nicotine

5 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection to form.

6 THE WITNESS: Some human smokers compensate.

7 The public health community knew that. They

8 understood that smokers could compensate even up to

9 the point of getting, for some smokers, the same
10 amount of tar and nicotine in a low—tar cigarette than
11 a comparative higher tar —— what they were persuaded

12 by the epidemiological evidence is that the population
13 as a whole didn't.

14 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

15 Q. And did Philip Morris know more about that

16 topic than the ETC or do you not have an opinion

17 because you haven't studied Philip Morris's documents?
18 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection to form.

19 THE WITNESS: T have not studied them in a

20 systematic fashion. I mean, there have been some that
21 have been included in parts of expert reports,

22 including in this case. I have taken a look at those,
23 but T have not made any systematic attempt to

24 understand what Philip Morris knew about compensation.

2 Q. And you don't know whether or not Philip
3 Morris knew materially more about the FTC about
4 compensation in that it knew the role that addiction

5 played and the FTC did not.
6 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
7 THE WITNESS: Okay. I'm a little confused

8 here. One is that I don't know what Philip Morris

9 knew on that issue. So I'm not in a position to make
10 a comparable statement. I mean, certainly the FTC
11 understood that compensation was possible. I mean,

12 they mention that. They knew that was related to
13 nicotine. But I have no —— I have no opinion about
14 whether Philip Morris knew more or less.

20 Q. Okay. Now, you don't know if during

21 periods of time when Philip Morris was advocating to

22 the FTC that it should continue to use the FTC Method,
23 that that method produced results that were inaccurate

24 predictors of health risks because the addiction would

using the FTC Method at any time?

A. Again, I haven't studied all of the FTC

submissions on this, so I'm not sure. I have seen

Philip Morris document dealing with the discussion of

whether the FTC should adopt a new method in 1997

about a high level versus a low level, and Philip

Morris, I think, was arguing there 77 because I've
seen the memo or seen the submission —— that they
should keep the old method, but ——

So, along the way,

too much about —— I mean,

about the method in the beginning because that's what

they —— so that was what that discussion was.

issue, the more fundamental issue here,

is what did

I know they had reservations

people know about the quality of the measurements of

the machine, and, you know, were they in any way
representative of a smoker, an average smoker, a
population of smokers.

from the very beginning that, no, of course not.

mean, this is a machine.
The value of the data that the machine
identified was that —— that the consumer could compare

whether a cigarette had a higher tar and nicotine

rating or a lower one, depending on this reference

 

And I think that the FTC knew

1 point. I don't want to sound like the FTC was cruel
2 because they weren't interested in what individual
3 smokers got, but that's not what their machine was

4 measuring, and I think they knew it. I think they
5 repeatedly said that they knew it. It was as what the
6 purpose of the machine was to give relative values
7 that all the cigarettes be tested in the same way,

8 that no other method could be used, and that was what
9 the purpose was. And they understood, I think, that
10 some smokers would get more or some smokers would get

11 less.

12 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

13 Q. Okay. Now, let me ask my question again.
14 You've located the correct decade. Do you know in the
15 1990's whether Philip Morris advocated to the FTC that
16 it should not change the FTC testing method when

17 Philip Morris internally was aware that the FTC Method

18 would mislead consumers into falsely believing Light

19 cigarettes had less health risks than regular

20 cigarettes?

21 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form and lack
22 of foundation.

23 THE WITNESS: I don't see anything like that
24 in this one document I've read, so I don‘t know what

1 Philip Morris —— I mean, my understanding of that ﬂ

2 particular submission that I read is that they thought
3 that the relative rankings, the one I talked about

4 before, using the old method, would not substantially

5 change by having a twoitier method. And so, I guess,
6 what the —— now I'm speculating that they thought that
7 the dual system was if the proposed dual system was

8 superfluous. But that's what I took away from that
9 document.

10 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

11 Q. All right. Now, how would a medical

12 historian —— would a medical historian regard factual
13 findings, not conclusions of law, okay, but factual
14 findings by a federal judge after a nine—month trial

15 as something that that medical historian should

16 consider if it was relevant to the historical inquiry
17 the historian was considering?

18 A. I think they would —— they might note it as
19 an event, but I don't necessarily —— because a judge
20 says —— concludes —— one thing or —— that that

21 necessarily means that the historian is obligated in

22 any way to agree with the judge.
23 Q. Well, my question wasn't whether the

24 historian would feel bound by it.

1 A. Oh, I see. Okay.

2 Q. But would consider, is it relative input,
3 again, with the proviso that it is relevant to the

4 historical inquiry that the medical historian is

5 conducting, you have a substantial trial after years
6 of pretrial litigation, millions of dollars, many

7 millions of dollars are spent on presenting the

8 evidence to the judge, and the judge issues detailed

9 Findings of Fact.

10 My initial question is, in that scenario, is
11 that information —— would a medical historian consider
12 that information worth considering so long as it was
13 relevant to the historical inguiry the historian was
14 pursuing?

15 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

16 THE WITNESS: The issue about the cost of
17 the trial, I don't know whether the historians would
18 consider that, but I think, you know, the notion of

19 considering it —— I considered it. I mean, so —— T

20 mean, I read it. I mean, it's a body of information
21 that's —— that's available.

3 reasons, I either —— for a variety of reasons —— I'm

7 THE WITNESS: In general, yes.

8 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

9 Q. Okay. Now, did you run across when you
10 were reading Judge Kessler's opinion any factual
11 findings that she made where she determined that the
12 tobacco companies knew more about compensation than

13 the FTC and had misled the FTC on that issue?

14 A. I think she may have done this, but it was
15 not an area that I focused on because it was not

16 something that I've done any work on.

17 Q. Okay. Fair enough. This is returning,

18 Dr. English, to an issue we've discussed before. I'll
19 try to avoid prolonging the examination.

20 First, as a threshold matter, to kind of

21 reorient us, because you're not an expert in consumer
22 behavior, you don't know what consumers, including

23 Marlboro Lights smokers, thought about the health

24 risks of Light cigarettes, correct?

3 Q. Okay. I'm going to return to the things a

4 medical historian can identify and reach expert

5 conclusions about with respect to the public health
6 community, but before we go there, I realized during
7 the break there is another issue I want to discuss

8 with you first, Dr. English.

9 Assume with me, Dr. English, that the key
10 issue in this case is the extent to which Marlboro
11 Light smokers in Missouri between 1995 and 2003 were
12 either misled or not misled because of the descriptor
13 "Lights" and the legend "lowered—tar and nicotine."
14 Your expert conclusion does not directly address that
15 topic since you have no expert conclusion on how
16 consumers understood those terms, correct?
17 MR. ROSENIHAL: Objection to form.
18 THE WITNESS: In general, yes. I don't know
19 exactly what all of the claims are or whether every
20 attorney involved would agree with you in your
21 assessment of what the central claims are, that I
22 don't know. But as I've said a couple times is that
23 I'm not here to talk about consumer perception in
24 general or in the particular case of Missouri.

12 Q. Yeah, I wasn't in my last question and your
13 answer to it, Dr. English, I wasn't attempting to

14 communicate that all the lawyers would agree that, as
15 I phrase the issue, that was a central issue, but

16 assuming that's the central issue, that is, the degree
17 to which —— or whether or not Marlboro Light smokers

18 in Missouri between 1995 and 2003 were misled by the

19 "Lights" descriptor on the box and by the "lowered tar
20 and nicotine," as we've established, you don't have an
21 expert opinion on that topic.

3 Q. Moreover, you have no expert opinion that

5 health community about the relative delivery and risk
6 of lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes versus higher
7 tar and nicotine cigarettes is even inferentially

8 related or —— strike that. I was almost there and

9 then I ended in the ditch.
10 The opinions that you do have about what was
11 known to the public health community does not even

12 inferentially address the issue of how Marlboro Light

13 smokers in Missouri understood the "Lights" descriptor

2 guess at my meaning, you will call out, as you just
3 did, that you don't understand it. So that's

4 perfectly fine. We can proceed on that basis. Can we

5 have that agreement?
6 A. Of course.
7 Q. I keep meaning to want to go over to the

8 flip chart because I think this is something that

9 could —— that would help —— that I could help
10 illustrate it. But let me, before lunch —— I'll move
11 that at lunch —— but let me try to work on it.
12 So here we have the question. How did class
13 members understand "Lights" in the term "Marlboro

14 Lights" on the pack and the legend "lowered tar and

15 nicotine"?
16 Okay. So I've just written out on this
17 piece of paper the question. How did class members

18 understand "Lights" in the term "Marlboro Lights" on

19 the pack and the legend "lowered tar and nicotine."
20 And on the left—hand side of the paper I'm
21 putting Dr. English's expert conclusions in this case.

22 And my question to you, Dr. English, is the
23 conclusions you have reached in this case do not bear

24 directly or inferentially on the answer to that

1 question, correct?
2 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection to form.
3 THE WITNESS: Let me say how they —— how

4 they might bear on this, and that is the public health
5 community clearly recommended lowetar cigarettes to

6 American smokers for a period of decades because it

7 was if as a ee what I call a thirdetier
8 recommendation. The most important recommendation
9 always was don't smoke. The second thing was, if
10 you're already a smoker, you need to stop. But if you
11 are smoking, you know, you should smoke low tar,
12 nicotine —— and this was done by governmental
13 authorities, members of the American Cancer Society

14 and others.

15 So this information was out there. It was a
16 determined decision in public communication. Exactly
17 where Missouri smokers got their information, I can't
18 tell you, but I —— but it certainly is conceivable to

19 me that they got their information from the public
20 health community. And I suspect, although I don't

21 know that, that there will be people here who do know

22 how to study consumer perception that may be able to
23 connect the public health message with the consumer
24 response, but that's not something that T can do.

2 Q. So beyond having the nonexpert conclusion
3 that your expert conclusions in this case might or

4 conceivably might address what I have termed "the

5 question," you yourself have no expertise that says,
6 even inferentially it bears on that question, though
7 you do believe there may be other experts who can

8 connect what the public health community —— the

9 information available to the public health community,
10 connect that topic to how class members understood
11 "Lights" and "lowered tar and nicotine," correct?
12 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
13 THE WITNESS: Well, it's not just the

14 information that was available to the public health

15 community. I mean, it's another step there. They

16 process that information and actually had, you know, a
17 concerted educational program to recommend. So it's
18 more than just what's available to them. It's what

19 they actually were saying. But the reception of that
20 message, that fairly clear public health message, in
21 Missouri smokers is not something I can do.

19 higher tar and nicotine cigarettes, correct?

2 Q. Okay. Now, who did they make

4 recommendations would go to different people, but, in
5 general.

6 A. Well, they made recommendations to smokers.
7 Q. To the public, in other words?

8 A. To the public. Some of the recommendations

9 they made were to physicians with, I think, ultimately

10 the physicians were an intermediary to the public.

11 Q. Okay. Now ——

12 A. I mean, they also —— I mean, the "New York
13 Times" commented on the recommendations, and so it was

14 picked up by the media. Lots of magazines picked up

15 various elements of it. So I think there probably

16 were a variety of audiences.

17 Q. Okay. Now, where we've had some discussion
18 is about the ability of a medical historian to reach
19 expert opinion, expert conclusions, on what the public

20 health community understood. Okay.

21 Now, I take it, it is your testimony that
22 you can have some insight, not only into what

23 information was available and what recommendations
24 were made, but you can gain insight into what the

1 public health community understood because you have Rme1m
2 written documents where they talk about their

3 understanding; is that correct?

4 A. Yes, I think I can do that in some

5 instances.

6 O. Okay. Now, it may not matter. It may be

7 semantics, I don't know, but, as a historian, you're

8 not able to reach expert opinions on what people

9 believed because belief is inherently subjective.
10 A. Well, of course, you know, the public health
11 community can be people, it can be an organization,
12 you know, and we may be getting into semantics there,
13 but sometimes when they come out and say, we recommend

15 think, or an understanding. So I'm not sure I'm
16 making a distinction there that you maybe are making
17 in asking your question.

19 one. Okay. We will mark as Exhibit 6 this sheet. If
20 you could focus on that just for a moment.

2 available," "recommend," "understood," and then over
3 here, "consumers and class members."

4 MR. ROSENTEAL: Technically it's

5 "information was available."

6 MR. SURRRENANT: What did I say?

7 MR. ROSENTHAL: "Information available."
8 MR. SURPRENANT: What?

9 MR. ROSENTEAL: You left out the "was."
10 MR. SURPRENANT: Oh, Okay.

12 there you have a line in the middle.

14 Q. I do, and I'm going to ask about that.

15 A. Okay.

16 Q. So you would be required to speculate to

17 draw a conclusion that there is —— strike that.

18 You do not have any expert opinion that the
19 information available to the public health community,
20 what they understood and what they recommended reached
21 either consumers in general or the specific class

22 members in this case, correct?

23 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection to form.

1 that this message could have been heard, but I have
2 not studied the consumers and I have not studied the
3 class members, but I think I can say something about

4 the concerted effort of the public health community to
5 get their message out.

6 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

7 Q. Okay. I have a fancy graph that I want to

8 do next, but I'll have to do that over the break

9 because it's going to be elaborate. So I'll just go
10 back to my nongraphic examination.

13 MR. SURPRENANT: Oh, it will be a beauty.
14 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

15 Q. Okay. Let me mark as my next document

16 Exhibit 7. Let me describe it for the record and then
17 I'll hand it to you, Dr. English. These are typed on
18 separate pieces of paper, "Findings of Fact," from the
19 amended final opinion by Judge Kessler in United

20 States v. Philip Morris, USA. Finding of Fact 2027,
21 Finding of Fact 2066, Finding of Fact 2080, Finding of
22 Fact 2174, Finding of Fact 2346, Finding of Fact 2349,
23 Finding of Fact 2351, and Finding of Fact 2627.

2 MR. SURFRENANT: And Finding of Fact 2110.
3 MR. ROSENTHAL: So what I'm going to get is
4 identical to that.

5 MR. SURFRENANT: Yeah. It should be. It

6 should be. I kind of put this together myself, so it

7 is my intent if aspirationally it will be the same.
8 MR. ROSENTHAL: Understood. Now it looks
9 like some of these you don't actually quote the entire

10 finding of fact, right? You have ellipses.

11 MR. SURPRENANT: I think where there is ——
12 unless it was ellipses that were in the original.
13 MR. ROSENTHAL: Well, I'm looking at finding

14 of Fact 2174, there are ellipses at the beginning of
15 the Finding of Fact, which would suggest to me as a

16 reader that there is a portion of 2174 that isn't

17 actually in here.
18 MR. SURPRENANT: That is likely and you can
19 object on that basis. I had not shined such an acute

20 light on the exhibit as you have.

21 MR. ROSENTHAL: Understood. And I do so
22 object to the extent you get the questions on that
23 Finding of Fact.

2 MR. ROSENTHAL: Okay.

3 MR. SURPRENANT: You know she has now joined
4 our firm.

5 MR. ROSENTHAL: I'm aware of that, yes.

6 But so, I mean, for instance, looking at

7 Finding of Fact 2080, there are ellipses in the

8 middle. And is it your representation that the
9 ellipses are original to Judge Kessler ——
10 MR. SURPRENANT: Well, since it's inside a

11 quotation ——

12 MR. ROSENTHAL: That's your assumption.

13 MR. SURPRENANT: —— that's my assumption,
14 but we will proceed in, as Hamlet says, "a hugger

15 mugger fashion."

16 MR. ROSENTHAL: Understood.

17 MR. SURPRENANT: One of the things Hamlet
18 says is there has been much tossing about of brains in
19 a certain —— there was a controversy about children as
20 actors, which was current at the time Shakespeare was
21 writing "Hamlet." And 1 always loved that phrase,

22 "much tossing about of brains."

1 different questions on these different findings of §

2 fact depending on what they say. Now, Finding of Fact
3 2027 ——

4 A. You're going to have to explain to me what a
5 finding of fact is.

6 Q. Well, you read Judge Kessler's opinion?

7 A. 1 did read portions of it, but I'm not sure
8 what a finding of fact is.

9 Q. What I'm going to say is that a judge in a
10 judge trial where the judge is the trier of fact ——
11 there is not a jury —— is the judge will, after the
12 trial, with the input of the parties, will then reach

13 Findings of Fact, that is, the Court will find as a

14 fact a certain fact, a certain datum, as it were, and
15 will also reach conclusions of law based on those

16 facts.

17 A. So the finding of fact is based on evidence

18 that the judge has heard.

19 Q. Yes. Right.
20 A. Okay.
21 MR. ROSENTHAL: In theory, at least.

22 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

 

 

 

 

 

23 Q. Okay.
24 A. Uh—huh. And presumably there is dispute at
Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.

399%54?534

Page 127 
1 the trial about the facts. g

2 Q. Right. A judge in a judge trial, as Judge
3 Kessler did here, will hear conflicting evidence, and,
4 like a juror, a jury, will decide essentially who to

5 believe and who not to believe, but a jury is a black
6 box. They don't —— they don't —— they aren't required
7 to if they are just required to fill out the special

8 jury interrogatory, you know, which are usually used

9 and not just a verdict. But a judge has to find
10 facts, make conclusions of law, so it can be appealed

11 and the court of appeal can understand what the judge

12 found.

13 And so with that little introduction to law,
14 Professor English, so the first one I'm going to have,

15 as I was saying, I'm going to have different questions

16 on different of these findings. And the defendants,

17 as you know from being an expert witness in the case,
18 included Philip Morris, correct?

19 A. That's —— yes.

20 Q. Okay. So Finding of Fact No. 2027:

21 Defendants did not disclose the full extent

22 and depth of their knowledge and understanding of
23 smoker compensation to the public health community or

24 to government regulators.

1 Because you have not done a systematic study
2 of what Philip Morris knew about compensation, you

3 have no opinion one way or another as to whether this

4 factual finding is correct or not.

5 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection.

6 THE WITNESS: Full extent, no, I don't. I

7 don't have that. I mean, I have seen some documents,

8 but I haven't done no systematic research.

9 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
10 Q. Okay. And so you have no expert opinion on

11 that finding, correct?

12 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection to form.

13 THE WITNESS: Well, presumably there would
14 be a document that would be shown to me or you're just
15 going to show me Judge Kessler's opinion, I mean, just
16 like this —— I would normally expect at trial that you
17 would then show me a document and then ask me to

18 compare that to what the public health community did
19 know. And if I'm only here commenting on Judge

20 Kessler and her determinations, I mean, then I would
21 answer slightly differently. We're just looking at
22 the one sentence here.

23 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

24 O. Well, yeah, and, you know, just to —— we're

1 being quite conversational, but that's —— perhaps it 3

2 will lead us to greater clarity in the future. I'm

3 not asking you did Judge Kessler get it right or not.

4 A. Okay.

5 O. Okay. What I'm asking you if and I could
6 be saying Hercules instead of Judge Kessler for

7 present purposes. In other words, I'm just asking, do
8 you have an expert opinion on whether the

9 assertion/factual finding is accurate or not, and the
10 answer is, you don't have an expert opinion, correct?
11 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form and
12 characterization.
13 THE WITNESS: Well, given this, I did not
14 study what Philip Morris has done as far as
15 disclosing, and so I can't —— I don't have an opinion
16 on whether it was a full disclosure or not.

17 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
18 O. Okay. Now what I‘m going to do in the next

19 one, Dr. English, which is Finding of Fact No. 2066,

20 which is somewhat lengthier —— you can read the whole
21 thing to yourself. I'm going to read it one sentence
22 at a time and then ask you about that sentence. Is
23 that an acceptable way to proceed?

24 A. There is a couple of things here before we

1 go into it too much. There are numbers here, which I 3

2 think must be relating to a document that she was

3 relying on; is that right?

4 Q. I think she is citing deposition testimony.
5 MR. ROSENIHAL: It's actually written

6 direct.

7 THE WITNESS: Written direct and if

8 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

9 Q. Oh, okay, the written direct of that
10 witness.
11 MR. ROSENIEAL: Correct.
12 THE WITNESS: So it's going to be hard ——
13 I'll see what your question is, but it seems to me
14 this is shorthand for a longer answer, so that's why
15 I'm ——

16 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

17 Q. Okay. We'll proceed, and —— we'll proceed
18 and see how we do.

19 Finding of Fact number 2066, I'm going to

20 read the first sentence.

21 Defendants —— and, again, as we discussed,

22 Dr. English, that would include Philip Morris ——
23 defendants did not, however, disclose their knowledge

24 that smokers would ultimately ingest as much if not

1 more nicotine and tar from low—delivery cigarettes as

2 they would from full—flavor products. End of first

3 sentence.

4 Again, Dr. English, I'm not asking you with
5 respect to that sentence whether you agree with Judge
6 Kessler, disagree with Judge Kessler, whether ——

7 whether she had an adequate basis for that or an

8 inadequate basis. I'm simply asking, am I correct

9 that you do not have an expert opinion as to whether
10 that assertion is accurate or not, correct?
11 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection to form.
12 THE WITNESS: I haven't studied what Philip
13 Morris did in that respect, so I don't have a
14 professional opinion.

15 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
16 Q. Okay. Next sentence will be the same.

17 I'll read it and then I will ask you simply am I

18 correct that you don't have an expert opinion as a

19 medical historian as to whether the sentence, the

20 assertion the sentence makes, is accurate or not.

21 Quoting: Defendants knew that the

22 phenomenon of smoker compensation discussed in greater
23 detail infra —— infra means Latin for later on ——

24 would cause smokers to smoke low—delivery products

1 more intensely and more frequently in order to obtain
2 their desired level of nicotine.
3 You do not have a expert opinion as a

4 medical historian whether that assertion is correct or

5 not.
6 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
7 THE WITNESS: Well, I mean, I really es

8 since I haven't done a study of the defendants Philip

9 Morris, I mean, certainly smoker compensation and
10 would cause smokers —— I don't know whether she is
11 referring to every smoker or smokers under 20 —— I
12 mean, it‘s kind of —— kind of a vague sentence there,

13 but I think the thrust of your question is do I know
14 what the defendants knew at that time. No, I don't

15 know that.

16 I guess part of my answer is that, you know,
17 her finding of fact, you know, is problematic to me,

18 but I think your question is we're not trying to

19 second—guess Judge Kessler on this.

20 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

21 Q. Determining —— what I'm trying to determine
22 here in a kind of granular way, Dr. English, is,

23 again, admittedly, a granular way, what you don't have
24 expert opinions about.

Page 133 

1 A. Okay. So the part I don't have the expert

2 opinion about would be what the defendants knew.

3 Q. Correct.

4 A. Okay.

5 Q. Now, the next sentence we're going to run

6 into the first instance where the Court, Judge

7 Kessler, is citing written testimony on direct.

8 You know, they should have written testimony
9 on direct in every case. Direct testimony is so

10 boring.

11 Quoting the third sentence: To feed their
12 addiction, therefore, these smokers would defeat the

13 stated purpose of the lower delivery products, and

14 then she cites a witness, Henningfield, written

15 direct, and she gives the page and line citation.

16 Reading that sentence in conjunction as I

17 think it should be with the prior sentence that I read

18 to you, I am correct, am I not, that because you have
19 not studied Philip Morris's internal documents in a
20 systematic way, you have no expert opinion on whether
21 that third sentence read in conjunction with the

22 second sentence is accurate or not, correct?

23 MR. ROSENIHAL: Objection.

24 THE WITNESS: Actually I'm not sure that

 

 

Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.
312-421-3377

sooo54rs41
3990547541


Page 134 

 

Page 134 
1 that's a correct reading of that or a fair reading of 4

2 that. I don't know whether she's referring to feed

3 their addiction, the smoker's would defeat, or whether
4 she is referring back to the defendants, or is she

5 making a separate finding based on Dr. Henningfield's
6 written direct. I can't make a comment on that

7 because I don't know what, you know, what all the

8 antecedents are.

9 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

10 Q. So you find the sentence either read with
11 the preceding sentence or not to be ambiguous, and,

12 therefore, you're not sure what position she is

13 asserting.

14 A. Well, I wouldn't want to get into Dr. ——

15 Judge Kessler's head. I mean, the idea of how smokers
16 responded to lower delivery products is something the

17 public health community had a lot of things to say

18 about. So, in that sense, I have, You know, I do have
19 opinions.

20 Now, you're trying to tie it to the prior
21 sentence of what the defendants did not disclose, and
22 I just don't know if that's even —— if that's Judge

23 Kessler's intent at this point. I mean, I just can't

24 tell by looking at the document.

1 Q. Okay.

2 A. And I certainly don't know, you know —— I

3 mean, I have read a lot of papers by Dr. Henningfield,
4 but I don't know what this particular citation refers
5 to.

6 Q. Okay. Let me try to avoid other findings

7 that I've read to you, that I've given you, that may
8 kind of cause us to have similar problems, and skip

9 ahead to Finding of Fact 2346.

10 And you will see there, Dr. English, there
11 are a large number of what a lawyer would call

12 evidentiary citations after the first two sentences.
13 Evidentiary citation, i.e., a citation to evidence

14 either testimonial or documents.

15 A. Uh—huh.

16 Q. And so I'm not going to ask you if you

17 have, you know, any opinions on evidentiary citations,
18 but just the first two sentences, which I will read.
19 Finding of Fact No. 2346: Despite evidence
20 spanning multiple decades showing Defendants'

21 extensive knowledge of compensation, Defendants

22 concealed that knowledge and disseminated false and
23 misleading statements to downplay its existence and

24 prevalence. As part of their attempt to portray

1 low—tar cigarettes as less harmful, Defendants ﬂ

2 publicly endorsed retaining the FTC Method well into

3 the 1990's because of its usefulness to consumers.

4 Taking the first sentence, am I correct that
5 you do not have a expert opinion as to whether that

6 sentence is accurate or not?

7 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.

8 THE WITNESS: This is actually even more

9 difficult for me to interpret because there is just so
10 many evidentiary citations after that, which I am
11 assuming would illuminate those two or three sentences
12 that you read. So without having a chance to read all
13 that, and even then I'm not sure I could respond to
14 your question, based on —— based on either the Finding

15 of Fact 2346 ——

16 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

17 Q. Okay. I hear you. I have a plan on how
18 I'm going to try to return to this topic, but I hear
19 what you're saying. Let me try, if we can work

20 through Finding of Fact No. 2349.

21 Quoting: As noted in section V(E)(1)(c)
22 supra, which is Latin for above ——
23 A. Just for explanatory, what is this section

24 V(E)(1)(C)?

1 Q. It is an earlier part of her opinion that

2 she is addressing. It's not another document.

3 A. I know, but, in particular, what she is

4 noting that she is coming back to?

5 Q. Well, I think she then goes on to summarize
6 it. Okay. And maybe we will run into problems.

7 Let's proceed and see if we can.

8 As noted in section V(E)(1)(c) supra, while

9 the FTC contemplated at the time it adopted its method

10 that numerous potential variations among individuals
11 in everyday smoking behavior could have some effect on
12 tar and nicotine yields, it did not have a full

13 understanding of smoker compensation —— that smokers'
14 addiction to nicotine would cause them to smoke

15 low—tar cigarettes more intensely to satisfy their

16 nicotine addiction, and thereby inhale amounts of tar
17 and nicotine comparable to those inhaled by smokers of

18 full—flavored cigarettes.

19 I take it you do not have an expert opinion
20 whether the assertion that I've just quoted is

21 accurate.

22 MR. ROSENIHAL: Objection.

23 THE WITNESS: Well, what I don't know is

24 what she is —— first of all, I don't know the prior

1 section, and so there may be some facts in there.
2 THE REPORTER: Read slowly, please, Doctor.
3 THE WITNESS: The first part here of this

4 sentence, while the FTC contemplated at the time it

5 adopted its method that numerous potential variations
6 among individuals in everyday smoking behavior could

7 have some effect on tar and nicotine yields, and RR

8 I mean, I assume, but this is where I don't
9 know the assumption here, nicotine yields as smoked in

10 the Cambridge machine, I think, it did not have a full

11 understanding of smoker compensation.

12 Well, I'm not sure, you know, what she means
13 by "full" in the sense that did they have —— did they
14 have a 1967 view of what smoker compensation was or
15 does she mean full 2000 and whatever the opinion was,
16 five or six, view of compensation? That that —— T

17 mean, in other words, I'm —— T'm hampered because I
18 don't know enough to be able to make a comment.

19 Certainly some of the things in this

20 paragraph are things I do have opinions on, but I'm
21 not sure exactly with her wording —— I mean, you're
22 asking a question using her wording, and I'm sort of

23 losing the thread a little bit.

1 Q. Okay. That's fair enough. And let me read
2 the next sentence and examine you on that, and then

3 I'll try to generalize the point and see if we can get
4 a clearer communication.

5 The next sentence said in Finding of Fact

6 2349:

7 Defendants, which would include Philip

8 Morris, withheld the long—held knowledge that the

9 primary reason the FTC Method could yield misleading

10 data was that nicotine addiction would drive smokers
11 to obtain relatively stable nicotine intakes through
12 smoker compensation, and then a citation to the

13 written direct of Henningfield.

14 Do you feel an expert opinion —— strike

15 that.

16 I take it you do not have an expert opinion
17 because your testimony didn't —— your analysis ——

18 didn't address it whether the tobacco companies,

19 including Philip Morris, withheld from the FTC their

20 long—held knowledge that the primary reason the FTC

21 Method could yield misleading data was that nicotine
22 addiction would drive smokers to obtain relatively
23 stable nicotine intakes through smoker compensation.

1 THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. There are just so
2 many things wrong with the sentence, I don't even know
3 where to begin.

4 First of all, I don't, as I've said many

5 times, I haven't studied what the defendants if

6 misleading, I think, has a certain meaning in a legal
7 context than it does in other contexts. I mean, the
8 fact is the —— I'm assuming we're not talking about

9 the machine being misled or yielding different kinds

10 of things.

11 And then we get to the point of

12 Dr. Henningfield's citation. I don't know whether he
13 somehow charged the defendants or whether the judge is
14 taking a comment that he made about contemporary views

15 about the FTC Method and somehow conflating that with

16 something else. I just can't —— it's very hard for me
17 to give you an answer given the nature of the question
18 and includes a third—party's phrasing making reference
19 to documents that neither one of us has in front of

20 us.

3 VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the record at 1:12.

4 MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. I had Dr. English on
5 the ropes. He was just about ready to withdraw his

6 report.

7 THE WITNESS: You're going to object, right?
8 MR. ROSENTHAL: I think that was so

9 facetious on its face that no objection is necessary.
10 However, it is an absurd characterization of what was
11 occurring.

12 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

13 Q. Okay. So let me, as I told you, let me try
14 to generalize the point.

15 A. So we're no longer looking at this document?
16 Q. Not now. We're going to go back to it.

17 A. Okay.

18 Q. But right now the Plaintiffs in this case,

1 Q. Is that one of the ways that Philip Morris, ﬂ

2 in concert with the other tobacco companies, misled

3 the FTC about whether its testing method was

4 appropriate or not or useful or not was they knew,

5 based on internal data and studies, that because

6 nicotine addiction most smokers would smoke the

7 cigarette in such a way, consciously or unconsciously,
8 to obtain relatively stable levels of nicotine when

9 they switched from a higher tar and nicotine cigarette
10 to a lower tar and nicotine cigarette. That is a
11 topic your analysis has not addressed and you do not
12 have an opinion on.
13 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
14 THE WITNESS: Well, of course the FTC knew

15 that irrespective of what Philip Morris said. But,

16 again, I haven't studied Philip Morris's disclosures
17 to the FTC, so I can't reach —— I don't have an
18 opinion on that.

19 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

20 Q. When did the FTC —— let me see if T

21 understand this correctly. Ts it your testimony that
22 the FTC understood throughout the time period that it
23 employed the FTC Method that compensation would be

24 driven by nicotine addiction and the smoker's

1 unconscious efforts to smoke the cigarette in order

2 to —— it would provide relatively stable levels of

3 nicotine after switching from a higher tar and

4 nicotine cigarette to a lower tar and nicotine

5 cigarette?

6 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

7 THE WITNESS: Let me try to answer it this

8 way. From the very beginning the FTC understood that

9 what a smoker got and what the machine got were
10 different and for all the reasons that they enumerated
11 in the news release at the time. This, of course, was
12 1967, a full idea of what compensation was and
13 nicotine titration, that was a —— that was a

14 scientific idea that emerged a little bit later

15 especially with Michael Russell's studies in the

16 1970's.

17 Certainly, I think, in some of their annual
18 reports and also reviews of whether they should change
19 the FTC Method, the FTC clearly states that they know
20 that what a machine gets and what the smoker get are
21 different. They mention the fact that compensation

22 exists. Whether they put it, all the elements, like
23 you have in your question, into a single document, I'm

24 not sure they do that precisely, but I think that they

1 are very well aware that compensation exists, that

2 nicotine addiction or at least nicotine titration is
3 what is fueling compensation. I think they were very
4 well aware of that.

5 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
6 Q. Well, you put several things together.

7 There is no doubt, Dr. English, that the FTC was aware

8 that compensation was possible, correct?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. There is no doubt that they were aware and

11 stated that the FTC methods results would not be

12 tracked by actual smoking and the actual smoking

13 intake could vary based on the smoker, correct?

14 A. Yes.

15 Q. Okay. And they obviously knew there was a
16 variety of ways a cigarette smoker could compensate by

17 smoking more puffs, by smoking more deeply, by holding
18 the smoke, inhaling it longer, as it were, and smoking
19 further down into the —— what is the technical term of
20 the cigarette?

21 A. Closer to the butt?

22 Q. Closer to the butt, yes, okay. And all of
23 that was known and talked about in the public health

24 community, correct? I am asking a very specific

1 question ——
2 A. Uh—huh.
3 Q. —— which is, I'm correct —— do you ——

4 strike that.

5 Well, let me ask it this way. I'm correct,
6 am I not, that for much, if not virtually all of the

7 period of time the FTC Method was in effect, the FTC

8 did not have the core knowledge that it was the

9 nicotine addiction that would cause the smoker to
10 extract as much nicotine from a lowered tar and
11 nicotine cigarette as from the higher one they had
12 switched from, correct?
13 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
14 THE WITNESS: I don't agree with that. T
15 mean, I think the reason smokers compensated was for
16 nicotine. I mean, that was a standard public
17 health —— in fact, I can't think of a single document

18 that comes to mind at the moment that would say that
19 smokers compensate for any other reason than nicotine.
20 That goes with the concept of compensation.

21 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

22 Q. Let me hand you and mark your report and

23 I'm going to ask you to identify in your report any

24 document from the FTC that says the FTC testing method

1 is misleading because —— strike that. Any document, 3

2 communication from the FTC that said, one of the

3 reasons the FTC Method may not apply to actual smokers

4 is they are addicted to nicotine and will smoke
5 cigarettes to obtain the if essentially the same level
6 of nicotine from the lowered tar and nicotine

7 cigarette than the higher one they switched from. It
8 says that in sum or substance.
9 MR. ROSENTHAL: Is that a question? I'm a

10 little confused.

11 MR. SURPRENANT: Yeah. I'm handing the

12 witness ——

14 want —— I‘m trying to determine whether I need to

18 question.

1 THE WITNESS: Well, they talk about $

2 compensation, but compensation implies nicotine.

3 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

4 O. Okay. I understand. We already agreed

5 they talk about compensation.

6 A. Okay.

7 Q. I'm saying where they say that we, the FTC,
8 are aware of the fact that nicotine, in sum or

9 substance, that nicotine addiction would drive smokers
10 to obtain relatively stable nicotine intake through
11 smoker compensation.
12 A. Well, as I pointed out here, we could flip

13 through this, but my point is they were aware of
14 compensation and compensation implies nicotine ——
15 smoking for nicotine levels. I mean, I think that's

16 just part and parcel of the public health community's

17 understanding of what compensation was. There is

18 no —— what else would be driving it?

19 O. Well, first of all, are you now saying that
20 that is the implication in the FTC's communications

21 but they never made that implication express?

22 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection.

23 THE WITNESS: I think when they use the term
24 "compensation," they are using it to mean that.

2 Q. Okay. Now let's ask —— let's go to the
3 next level. It is one thing, Dr. English, to say, we
4 all know the only reason a smoker compensates is
5 because of nicotine addiction. It is a far different
6 thing to say that addiction will cause them to smoke
7 lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes in such a way as
8 to obtain relatively stable nicotine intakes. That's
9 another point, correct?
10 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection.
11 THE WITNESS: The way the public health
12 community used the term "compensation" in the 1970's
13 and onward is that the smoker adjusted smoking
14 behavior based on the level of nicotine. And the way
15 was that they would adjust their behavior upward, more
16 intensive smoking, in response to lower levels of
17 nicotine. That's the only way that T have ever seen
18 in the historical documents I've read how people
19 understood this. I mean, the question might be did
20 every smoker do it or not. That was —— I mean, there
21 was discussion about that aspect of it, but not the
22 sense that compensation existed and that it was —— it
23 was linked to nicotine.

1 Q. Dr. English, just as a matter of logic, if $

2 the FTC knew, if the FTC knew that because of nicotine

3 addiction that the addicted smoker would smoke the

4 cigarette, whether consciously in part, unconsciously
5 in part, all consciously, all unconsciously, to obtain
6 relatively stable levels of nicotine, that would have

7 told them for that reason that the FTC Method was

8 misleading the public, correct?

9 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
10 THE WITNESS: The FTC knew that what
11 their —— their Cambridge Method —— FTC was
12 measuring —— had nothing to do with what a smoker, an
13 individual smoker, got. They were very —— they were
14 —— and they knew it had nothing to do with what an
15 average smoker got. What they were interested in
16 doing is coming up with a machine number that would
17 give smokers a way to distinguish higher based on FTC
18 measurements and lower based on FTC measurements.
19 That's all they did. That's all —— I believe that's

20 all they ever claimed to do.

21 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

22 Q. Okay. That wasn't my question, though. My
23 question was, just as a matter of logic, if the FTC
24 Method —— if the FTC knew that its machine test

1 results indicating that lower —— smoke by a machine a
2 Marlboro Light had less tar and nicotine than a

3 Marlboro regular. But if they also at the same time
4 knew that almost invariably that smoker of Marlboro

5 Light is going to smoke the cigarette so in such a way
6 as to get comparable levels of nicotine, they —— then
7 they would have known the test was misleading, right?
8 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

9 THE WITNESS: Well, a couple things. One
10 is, I don't think anyone who was discussing
11 compensation would have used the word "invariably."
12 They knew it was possible for some smokers but maybe
13 not all smokers. So that was one.
14 The question of misleading gets the intent

15 of, you know, do I have any evidence that the FTC,

16 even with this idea, they knew compensation was trying
17 to deliberately mislead the public? I mean, I have no
18 comment on that. I just don‘t have any —— I don't

19 have the ability to make that kind of discernment, nor

20 do I have any ability to say, on the other side of
21 your proposed perception, what the public understood
22 from the FTC Method.

23 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

24 O. Okay. So let's go back to my original

Page 151
1 reason for giving you your report, which is, is there

2 any document that you cite that expressly says, from

3 the FTC, that we understand that the smoker is going

4 to change his smoking habits when they switch from a

5 higher to a lower tar and nicotine cigarette in such a
6 way that their addiction will cause them to smoke in

7 such a way where they get comparable levels of

8 nicotine?

9 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
10 THE WITNESS: Well, certainly they never

11 expressed it the way you did. First of all, they

12 would never say "the smoker." They might say it's

13 possible for, you know, a smoker but not —— or some

14 smoker, but "the smoker" implies the population. But
15 I'll come back to what my original answer, and that is

16 that they understood that compensation exists, they

17 kept the method despite that, the FTC. The public

18 health community kept it because they had

19 epidemiological evidence as well. And, you know, did
20 they phrase the whole thing ——

21 But my view is that compensation inherently
22 includes the notion of smoking for nicotine.

1 report ——

2 A. I'm not sure —— going back ——

3 MR. ROSENTEAL: Wait. Let him finish his

4 question first.

5 THE WITNESS: Okay. I was going to go back

6 to the other question, but that's all right.

7 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

8 Q. Is there any document cited in your report
9 from the FTC Where compensation isn't inherently
10 linked to satisfying nicotine addiction but is

11 expressly linked?

12 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection to form.
13 THE WITNESS: Expressly linked? I can't
14 remember.

15 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

16 Q. Okay. Let's jump to Finding of Fact 2627.
17 It is clear —— quoting —— it is clear, based on their
18 internal research documents, reports, memoranda, and

19 letters, that defendants have known for decades that
20 there is no clear health benefit from smoking low—tar,
21 low—nicotine cigarettes as opposed to conventional,

22 full—flavor cigarettes.

23 I'm correct, am I not, that you do not have

24 an expert opinion on the accuracy of that assertion?

1 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection. a

2 THE WITNESS: That's correct.
3 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
4 Q. Continuing, it is also clear that, while

5 Defendants knew that the ETC Method for measuring tar

6 and nicotine accurately compared the nicotine tar
7 percentages of different cigarettes, they also knew
8 the method was totally unreliable for measuring the
9 actual nicotine and tar any real—life smoker would
10 absorb because it did not take into account the
11 phenomenon of smoker compensation.
12 Do you have any expert opinion on the
13 accuracy of that sentence?
14 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection to form.
15 THE WITNESS: The only way I could answer

16 that question is I do know what Philip Morris and

17 other tobacco companies, what their submission was

18 when the Cambridge Method first came up in the ETC

19 held hearings, and the —— and the tobacco companies
20 expressly said that they did not believe that the

21 method actually measured what smokers obtained from
22 cigarettes, and that opinion was taken over virtually
23 verbatim by the FTC when they announced the method.

24 Now, there are other parts of that which I

4 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection.

5 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

6 Q. They didn't say that, did they?

7 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection.

8 THE WITNESS: I think if you go back to the
9 original submission, they were pretty clear that they

10 didn't think that it was reliable.

11 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

12 Q. Okay.
13 A. But —— and it was something that the FTC
14 agreed with, but that wasn't the purpose of the —— of

15 the Cambridge Method.

16 Q. Let me go lastly to Finding of Fact 2110.
17 Moreover, epidemiological ——
18 MR. ROSENTEAL: Epidemiological.

19 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

20 Q. —— epidemiological studies may
21 underestimate the risk for lower tar smokers because
22 these smokers may have other characteristics such as

23 healthier lifestyles that contribute in risk.

24 Regardless of the type of cigarette smoked?

1 MR. ROSENTHAL: That was actually —— you
2 misread it in several respects. Let's just start
3 over.

4 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

5 Q. Let's go again, beyond my bad

6 pronunciation. Moreover, epidemiological studies may
7 underestimate the risks for lower tar smokers because
8 these smokers may have other characteristics —— such
9 as healthier lifestyles —— that contribute to a
10 reduction in risk regardless of the type of cigarette

11 smoked...
12 MR. ROSENTHAL: And we don't know if the
13 ellipses reflect the fact that there is more of

14 Finding 2110 that you just haven't reproduced here,

15 correct?

16 MR. SURPRENANT: That's true .

17 MR. ROSENTHAL: It's entirely possible that
18 there is something else here that's missing.

19 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

20 Q. But do you agree with that?

21 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

22 THE WITNESS: This, you know, there are lots
23 of epidemiological studies and they have strengths and
24 weaknesses. The public health community took great

1 store in epidemiological studies to be able to answer
2 questions about the risks of certain diseases. There
3 always are questions about confounding factors, but,

4 beyond that, I can't say.

5 So one is that I understand that any

6 epidemiological study can have confounding factors,
7 but that doesn't change my opinion in my report that
8 the public health community relied very heavily on

9 epidemiological studies.
10 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
11 Q. Okay. Let me return to a topic that we
12 kind of had some examination on without being
13 duplicative and try to get a better understanding.
14 You have framed your analysis around what

15 the public health community understood, what knowledge

16 was available to it, about the relative delivery and
17 health risk of lowered tar and nicotine cigarette

18 versus higher tar and nicotine cigarette. What

19 recommendations they made based on that and what they
20 understood as discerned from the recommendations and

21 the documents they published.

22 That, at a general level, is a fair summary
23 of what you've done, correct?
24 A. Yes.

1 Q. Okay. But among the things you haven't
2 done is to identify in a systematic way that would
3 comport with the rigor of medical historical research

4 to identify what the tobacco industry, including

5 Philip Morris, communicated to the public health

6 community. I'm correct in that as well?
7 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
8 THE WITNESS: Yes .

9 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

10 Q. Okay. Now, what would be your answer to
11 the criticism, Dr. English, that, in order to

12 determine what the public health community —— what

13 information was available to it and what it

14 understood, you needed to include the tobacco

15 industry's communication as part of that analysis?

16 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

17 THE WITNESS: What I was —— what my task was
18 was to look at what the science and —— what the

19 scientific and medical communities knew about the

20 health risks and what the recommendations were. That

21 did not include the tobacco industry. So I didn't ——

22 1 did not look there. I certainly have found no
23 evidence from looking at scientific and public health
24 documents that the public health community was relying

2 from the public health —— from the tobacco companies,
3 but it's simply not something that I've done.

4 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

5 Q. And the reason es the reason is because you

6 were attempting to identify the knowledge and

7 understanding of the public health community and you
8 did not include the tobacco companies as participants
9 in that community?
10 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
11 THE WITNESS: Yes. 1 was looking at
12 primarily almost entirely of the scientific and public
13 health communities.

14 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

15 Q. Well, but didn't —— doesn't Philip Morris
16 have doctors and physicians who study, you know,

17 smoking and who take public positions, including

18 public positions to the public health community, on
19 issues related to the risk of smoking?

20 A. Some of Philip Morris's scientists publish
21 in the scientific literature. 1 have seen some of

22 those because they are part of the scientific record.
23 So, in that sense, they are included. But I have not
24 made a systematic study of what the —— what the

2 Q. Now, there is another part of your answer,
3 several answers ago, do you think the public health

4 committee —— community —— regarded statements made

5 about health issues involving tobacco with skepticism?
6 A. I'm sorry. Which —— whose statements?

7 Q. Let me reeask the question.

8 First re—read it and see if I misspoke.

9 (Record read.)
10 MR. SURPRENANI: I did misspeak. Quite

11 right.
12 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
13 Q. Do you believe, as a medical historian,

14 that the public health community regarded statements

15 made by tobacco companies and the tobacco industry

16 about health issues involving tobacco with skepticism?
17 A. You know, they don't comment on it. I don't
18 see that in a Surgeon General's Report from the '70s

19 or '80s or —— about that. So I —— I can't really —— I
20 don't really have a comment on that.

21 I think there were some very negative

22 comments about the tobacco industry that got into

23 Monograph 13. That's not really a Surgeon General's

24 Report, but I see it there where, as I recall, that

2 tobacco industry positions, but, for the most part,

3 they don't talk about the tobacco industry.

4 Q. Do you have, based on the 20 or 25 cases
5 you've been retained by tobacco companies if I take it
6 you principally have been retained more often than not

7 by Philip Morris?

8 A. I suspect that's the case.

9 O. Okay. Have you ran across any
10 communications by Philip Morris or other tobacco
11 companies on the topic of health issues and tobacco
12 that you believe were —— would be misleading, would

13 mislead members of the public if the public believed
14 them?

15 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

16 THE WITNESS: You know, I haven't —- again,

17 I haven't studied that. I haven't seen that.

18 Occasionally in cases I've been presented with

19 plaintiffs attorneys with some documents, but when you
20 get to the question of being misled, my understanding

21 of what the word means is that there is intent, and I

22 can't tell the intent of the person writing a document

23 would be.

24 And then the other half of misleading is the

1 reception, and I don't know if I can be able to show
2 that someone was misled by or deceived by the

3 document.

4 So —— but that's the best I can answer for
5 your question.

6 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
7 Q. I actually anticipated both objections and
8 I thought I avoided both of them. I said misled,

9 would be misleading, if believed, and I didn't put

10 into the question whether the misleading effect was
11 deliberate or intended.

12 So let me try to proceed. You are aware,
13 are you not, that Congressman Waxman from actually

14 west L.A. held a hearing in 1994?
15 A. Uh—huh.
16 Q. And Mr. Campbell testified at this hearing?

17 He was then the CEO of Philip Morris.

18 A. Uh—huh.

19 Q. And the other CEOs of the major tobacco
20 companies testified?

21 A. Uh—huh.

22 MR. ROSENTHAL: By the way, generally,
23 yeses, nos, not ——

24 THE WITNESS: Oh, sorry. Yes, yes, I am

1 aware of that. I've seen the video. ﬂ

2 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
3 Q. And each of them, each of the CEOs, in

4 1994, testified that smoking was not addictive,

5 correct?
6 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
7 THE WITNESS: I think it's more complicated

8 than that. That's certainly the sound bite that came
9 out of that, but what they were trying to do was to
10 connect that particular conclusion back to this 1964
11 Surgeon General's Report. So, I mean, I think it's
12 more complicated than that, but, yeah, they said,
13 based on how they looked at —— defined addiction, they
14 did not think smoking was addicting.

15 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

16 Q. Well, and do you believe that was a

17 responsible position to take in 1994?

18 A. I think ——

19 MR. ROSENIHAL: Objection to form.

20 THE WITNESS: I think it was a silly thing
21 to say, but —— I mean, the public —— and I guess they
22 are correct in that, when they refer to the '64

23 Surgeon General's report —— but the Surgeon General

24 had moved in his position from 1964 to 1988.

1 And so in 1988 the Surgeon General and I ﬂ

2 think the public health community agreed that nicotine
3 was an addicting substance.

4 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

5 Q. Well, do you think that if

6 A. So, I think, you know, I mean, do I —— do I
7 think they were wrong? I don't agree with them.

8 Didn't agree with them at the time.

9 Q. Do you think if a smoker or a potential
10 smoker in 1994 thought, gosh, all seven of the CEOs
11 testified under oath that it wasn't addictive, and if
12 they believed that and continued or began smoking

13 based on it, were they misled in my hypothetical?

14 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

15 THE WITNESS: That gets into consumer

16 perceptions and that's not something I have an opinion
17 on.

18 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

19 Q. Right, but as my —— as my first—year law

20 professors drilled into our heads, they were the

21 master of the hypothetical. We poor students had to
22 accept the hypothetical and answer it. And, in a

23 similar way, I am the master of the hypothetical. And

24 so I can set up a hypothetical where I'm asking you to

1 assume is true certain facts. Let me try to do it
2 again.
3 If I was a potential smoker in 1994 and I

4 believed what Mr. Campbell of Philip Morris and the

5 other six testifying CEOs testified that nicotine was
6 not addictive, and then I started smoking in reliance
7 on their statement that I wouldn't be addicted, in

8 that hypothetical would I have been misled?

9 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
10 THE WITNESS: Well, this is, you know ——
11 historians try to figure out, you know, what happened,

12 not what might have happened if something that didn't
13 happen happened. So I'm getting confused here.

14 But, first of all, is the smoker in your
15 hypothetical relying on everything that Mr. Campbell
16 said? In other words, his whole testimony? He saw

17 the video that I saw and so he saw the idea that the

18 Surgeon General changed his opinion and they are

19 looking back at a '64 —— I mean, is that what they are
20 referring to or are they —— if they just saw the

21 photograph of them taking —— which is not really

22 swearing, it's where they are being sworn in, that was
23 in all the newspapers, if you just saw that, I mean,
24 I'm —— you know, consumer perception is a very

1 complicated field, and I don't have expertise into
2 parsing it. And so I don't know how —— I don't know
3 how to give you a professional opinion on this.

4 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

5 Q. Okay. You certainly ff you certainly would
6 understand the logic that a potential smoker of
7 cigarette, if they believed the sworn testimony of

8 Mr. Campbell and the other tobacco CEOs that smoking
9 tobacco wasn't addictive, that might lead to a
10 tendency of a nonsmoker to start smoking if they

11 believed that sentence, right?

12 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

13 THE WITNESS: I think consumer behavior is
14 much more complicated than that. I mean, what little
15 I do know, and I'm not an expert there, I suspect that
16 a potential consumer might consider all the

17 information that's out there. But, again, I'm getting
18 into a field where I really don't have expertise, and
19 so I don't want to give —— I don't want —— I just

20 don't know how to answer that question.

21 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

22 Q. Now, you've referred, Dr. English, a number
23 of times to a sound bite where they all said it's not
24 addictive, and there was substantially more testimony.

1 It was a day—long testimony. And the transcript from
2 that hearing is several hundred pages, correct?
3 A. I haven't read the transcript, but I assume

4 that's probably correct.

5 Q. Have you read some of the transcript?

6 A. I think so, but not in —— certainly not in
7 preparation for this deposition.

8 Q. Did you read it where the seven—year—old

9 boy who had asthma testified that there were a lot of

10 things that he wanted to do that he couldn't do

11 because smoking was allowed in public places, like

12 bowling alleys, and occasionally when he was around
13 secondhand smoke he would feel sick for days, and the
14 secondhand smoke and the smoking in public places,

15 like bowling alleys, made him feel as if he was not
16 normal and not equal to his other friends who didn't

17 get as sick as he did from secondhand smoke. And they
18 asked the CEOs, doesn't this child's testimony

19 indicate there is a real issue with secondhand smoke,
20 and none of them would agree that public smoking

21 should be banned.

22 A. I don't remember that.

8 4 in the deposition of Dr. English. On the record at

10 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
11 Q. I am going to examine Dr. English with a
12 couple of charts that I drew up during the break.

13 What I've marked for identification as Exhibit 9,

14 which 1 will turn to the witness after I read it, it
15 says on the left: "What the public health community
16 knew and recommended about lowered tar and nicotine

17 cigarettes versus higher tar and nicotine cigarettes."
18 And on the right—hand side there are three
19 points: "What class members understood," quote,

20 "Marlboro Lights, and," quote, "lowered tar and

21 nicotine to mean, what class members understood about

22 the health risks associated with Marlboro Lights
23 versus Marlboro Reds."

24 MR. ROSENTEAL: That S is critical.

1 MR. SURPRENANI: "Whether Philip Morris

2 designed and marketed Marlboro Lights in a misleading
3 way."

4 MR. ROSENTHAL: Do you want to do the other
5 one now just to get it over with?

6 MR. SURPRENANI: Sure.

7 MR. ROSENIHAL: Since we got the if

8 MR. SURPRENANI: This is not as fancy as my
9 aspirations were. On the left, which is circled in a
10 shape that I don't think mathematics has a name for.

12 Mayan heads.

13 MR. SURPRENANT: It could be.

14 MR. ROSENTHAL: Or Easter Island.

15 MR. SURPRENANT: Easter Island.

16 MR. ROSENTHAL: That's what I was thinking.
17 MR. SURPRENANI: Okay. "Tobacco companies,

18 including Philip Morris, manipulating the ETC, and
19 then the EIC," and then there is an arrow to "PRC,"
20 which means the public health community. And I will
21 mark that as Exhibit 10.

1 O. Okay. Now, Dr. English, I appreciate your
2 patience with me. I'm not saying that the lawyers,
3 your —— Philip Morris counsel and I —— will agree that

4 what I've put on the right—hand side of Exhibit 9 are

5 the relevant issues. That's an argument we can have.
6 What I want to do is understand the
7 relationship, if any, between what's on the leftihand

8 side of Exhibit 9 and what's on the right—hand side of

9 Exhibit 9.

10 Now, on the left hand is what the public
11 health community knew and recommended about lowered
12 tar and nicotine cigarettes versus higher tar and

13 nicotine cigarettes. And, Dr. English, that's just
14 kind of my shorthand telegraph for what your testimony

15 is. Okay?

 

 

 

 

 

16 A. Okay.
17 Q. And I am correct, am I not, that there is
18 no relationship between your testimony on what the
19 public health community knew and recommended about
20 lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes versus higher tar
21 and nicotine cigarettes and the topic of what class
22 members understood Marlboro Lights and lowered tar and
23 nicotine to mean, correct?

1 THE WITNESS: That's not exactly what I ﬂ

2 said. What I said is that I don't know what class

3 members understood, but I think there is a connection
4 in the sense that the public health community wanted
5 smokers 77 these are people who would not stop and

6 wouldn't, you know, smoking —— they wanted them to

7 know about lowetar cigarettes.

8 So I think there is a connection there.

9 That's certainly what the message was. But what I
10 haven't done is studied the class. So I don't know
11 about their reception of the message.

12 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

13 Q. Well, what is more is that's a question of
14 consumer behavior, and you told me just before we

15 broke that that is a topic that you have no expertise
16 on and would be extremely reluctant to opine on,

17 correct?

18 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection.

19 THE WITNESS: Well, that's not something

20 I've studied, yes.
21 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
22 Q. Okay. And there are perhaps other experts
23 that you believe conceptually or theoretically could

24 connect what the public community knew and recommended

 

 

Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.

399o54rsrs

Page 171 

 

1 about lower tar and nicotine cigarettes versus higher Rme1ﬂ
2 tar and nicotine cigarettes to what the class member
3 understood Marlboro Lights and lowered tar and

4 nicotine to mean, but that's not —— that's not a

5 connection you can provide, correct?

6 A. That's correct.

7 Q. Okay. Now, the second one, issue, I put

8 there is what class members understood about health

9 risks associated with Marlboro Lights versus Marlboro
10 Reds. And, again, because that is an issue of
11 consumer behavior and marketing and advertising, all
12 of which are topics you're not an expert on, there is
13 no connection between that issue —— strike that.
14 Your opinion on what the public health
15 community knew and recommended about lowered tar and
16 nicotine cigarettes versus higher tar and nicotine
17 cigarettes does not address the issue of what class
18 members understood about health risks associated with
19 Marlboro Lights versus Marlboro Reds, correct?
20 A. I would answer in the same way. I mean,
21 certainly the public health community had the
22 information, but I'm —— I haven't studied the class,
23 so I'm not able to make that —— that assessment.
24 Q. Now, I know you're not an expert on

1 consumer behavior, so I'm kind of reluctant to go down
2 this path, but let me ask a few questions.

3 I've asked you about tobacco —— whether

4 you've studied the impact of communications from the

5 Tobacco Institute to the public health community and
6 whether that affected their understanding or

7 communications by Philip Morris to the public health
8 community, and I believe you've expressed in sum or

9 substance that you don't think that any such

10 communications would have had an impact on what the

11 public health community knew and understood; is that
12 correct?

13 A. Certainly the ones that I've seen. I mean,
14 I haven't made a systematic study, but over the years
15 I've seen quite a few documents, you know, probably in
16 the hundreds of documents.

17 Q. Now, just as a matter —— and I know you're
18 not an expert in consumer behavior —— but do you have

19 any kind of lay opinion that the public would much

20 more likely be influenced by —— about, you know, risks
21 and dangers or the absence of risks and dangers from
22 smoking cigarettes by communications from the ——

23 strike that. Strike that. Let me start again.

24 We had some brief examination on the

1 open—question strategy. Do you recall that?

2 A. Yes, I do. I do remember the line of

3 questioning.

4 O. Okay. Now, are you aware that an express

5 aim of the openeguestion strategy was to create in the
6 smoking public or the potential smoking public's mind
7 an issue that said, while there are statistical

8 correlations between smoking and lung cancer, it is an
9 open question whether there is really a cause and

10 effect?

11 MR. ROSENTHAL: Are you done?
12 MR. SURPRENANT: Yes .
13 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

14 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

15 O. That was one of the aims of the

16 open—question strategy.

17 MR. ROSENIHAL: Same objection.

18 THE WITNESS: Okay. I don't know what the
19 aims of the strategy was. I have seen one of the ads
20 that appeared in a newspaper. I don't —— I didn't

21 review it for this case, so I'd have to take a look
22 and actually see what was in the ad. I just don't

23 remember it well enough, but I certainly don't have
24 any knowledge about what the aims of the campaign.

1 And I don't even know it was a campaign. a

2 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

3 Q. Okay.

4 A. To my recollection, only seeing one or two
5 ads in a specific time, and so I don't know whether

6 that's actually an ongoing campaign. I just don't

7 have any information about that.

8 Q. Okay. We'll pursue that a little bit, but,
9 as a medical historian, you know that Philip Morris
10 and the tobacco industry denied that smoking was
11 addictive until 1999, correct?
12 MR. ROSENIHAL: Objection to form.
13 THE WITNESS: Again, I haven't studied it

14 well enough to know exactly what their public

15 statements were on addiction. I do know that in

16 their —— on their website they mention in 1999 that
17 the public health community thought that cigarette

18 smoking was an addiction and they thought the public
19 should pay attention to the public health community.
20 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

21 Q. Right. And that was one of the results of
22 the 1998 settlement of the lawsuits by the attorney
23 general —— the attorney generals of most of the

24 states —— versus the tobacco company, as part of the

Page 175 
1 settlement they agreed that they would put that on the §

2 website, correct?

3 A. I'm not sure that that was part of the

4 settlement.

5 Q. Okay. Now, they also, Philip Morris and

6 the public —— Big Tobacco companies, denied from 1954,
7 for a considerable length of time, I believe 1999

8 again, that cigarette smoking killed people, killed

9 smokers, and caused disease, correct?
10 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form,
11 foundation.
12 THE WITNESS: I'm not —— again, I haven't

13 studied their public statements on that, any

14 systematic fashion, so I don't know. I'd be happy to
15 look at a statement that we can look at it and see

16 what it says and compare it to what the public health
17 community was saying at the same time, if you want,

18 but T just haven't studied it in a systematic fashion.

19 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

20 Q. Right. Now, I understand why you haven't
21 studied it in a systematic fashion with respect to the
22 public health community because you told me you were

23 interested in identifying what the public health

24 community knew and recommended about lowered tar and

1 nicotine cigarettes. And since Philip Morris and the 4

2 tobacco companies are not members in the public health

3 community, you didn't look at that statement. I

4 understand why you did that. But —— and I understand
5 you're not an expert in consumer behavior or consumer
6 understanding, but do you have a lay opinion whether

7 the public would likely have been more susceptible to

8 being persuaded by the efforts of the tobacco company
9 to create uncertainty about whether nicotine was
10 addictive and harmful versus members of the public

11 health community?

12 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form,

13 foundation, competency.

14 THE WITNESS: It's just not something I've
15 studied. Consumer behavior, I understand, is a very

16 complicated field, and it's not something that I have
17 expertise in.

18 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

19 Q. Okay. Now, the last thing I put on here is

20 whether Philip Morris designed and marketed Marlboro

21 Lights in a misleading way. Now, that is not a topic
22 you've considered or have expert opinions about,

23 correct?

24 A. That is correct.

1 Dr. English, were far more than my graphic abilities, 3

2 but 1 am trying to communicate a point here. And let
3 me kind of walk through it.

4 And so we have tobacco companies, including
5 Philip Morris, manipulating the FTC. We then have the

6 FTC and then we have the public health community.

7 Now, let me try to develop this into
8 something that you can understand. You did not, as a
9 medical historian, examine in any systematic way that
10 would allow you to reach expert conclusions as a
11 medical historian the communications between the

12 tobacco companies and the FTC, including Philip

13 Morris, correct?

18 haven't made a systematic study.

8 It was originally Craft. When Craft dropped out,

9 Judge David requested that we continue to refer to it
10 as Craft to keep it straight in his own mind. I
11 personally have been referring to it as Craft even

12 though Craft is no longer a plaintiff. But we're
13 talking about the case in Missouri, the reason why we
14 are sitting here today.

15 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

16 Q. The Missouri case.
17 A. Okay. You mentioned Judge Kessler, and
18 that's what confused me. I wanted to make sure we

19 were talking about DOJ or we were talking about the

20 case why we're all here.

21 Q. Right. Okay. And let me —— okay. One of
22 the assertions Plaintiffs in this case are making is
23 that the tobacco companies, including Philip Morris,
24 had greater knowledge on compensation than the FTC

1 had. They withheld that knowledge and manipulated the

2 FTC to adopt and maintain the FTC Method. That is not

3 a topic that you have studied, correct?
4 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
5 THE WITNESS: Well if

6 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

7 Q. That's not a topic you have reached expert
8 conclusions on.
9 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
10 THE WITNESS: Well, let me answer this way.
11 I do know a lot about compensation and the FTC,

12 limitations of their testing and all of that, so,
13 although I haven't made a systematic study, I am fully
14 prepared to talk about any document that you can have

15 that purports to show that and I'll look at it and

16 give you an opinion on it.

17 So, I mean, T certainly know that I haven't
18 seen any like that, and, I mean, I've read some of the
19 documents that Dr. Burns in his expert report cited.

20 I didn't see anything like that that would be a

21 manipulative document. I mean, you probably have some
22 documents in mind you could show me, but —— so

23 depending on the kinds of questions I'm asked about a

24 document, I probably —— I might well have an opinion.

1 BY MR. SURPRENANT: :3:

2 Q. Okay. Let's spend some time on this

3 because it's important. As you sit here today, you do
4 not have an expert opinion reached by standards

5 appropriate in the circumstances for a medical

6 historian where you can testify, I have made a

7 systematic study of the communications and the

8 interaction between the tobacco companies and the FTC

9 with respect to the FTC testing method, and I have an
10 expert conclusion that the tobacco companies did not

11 manipulate and mislead the FTC. You don't have that

12 opinion, correct?

13 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

14 THE WITNESS: I have not made a systematic
15 fashion —— I haven't seen a document that would

16 indicate that. You know, if you show me a document,

17 I'll be happy to take a look at it, but beyond that I
18 can't go.

19 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

20 Q. Right. Because you told me that, other

21 than documents Plaintiffs' attorney has shown you, you
22 haven't attempted to get an expert understanding as a
23 medical historian about the nature of the

24 communications and interactions between the tobacco

1 companies and the FTC with regard to the FTC's ﬂ

2 adoption and maintenance of the FTC testing method,
3 correct?
4 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection, mischaracterizes

5 the testimony.

6 THE WITNESS: Well, I guess maybe put it
7 more boldly. I'm sort of counting on Plaintiffs'

8 attorneys to show me the strongest documents and T

9 haven't seen them. I haven't seen any that would go

10 to the question about manipulating the FTC.

11 So, you know, I'm willing to look at a

12 document, but your question is have I made a

13 systematic search, and what I mean by systematic would
14 mean that I would try to find every communication

15 between Philip Morris and the FTC, no, I have not done
16 that.

17 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

18 Q. And there is even a greater reason that you
19 are unable to opine on that topic, isn't there,

20 Dr. English, which is you haven't studied internal

21 Philip Morris documents, right?

22 MR. ROSENTEAL: Two things. First of all,
23 he's changing, just for the record, he's writing

24 things on the chart, which was previously shown on the

MR. ROSENTHAL:
the question.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Okay.

Let me just ask a fresh question,

Dr. English. As a logical matter, as a logical

matter, unless you have determined in a systematic way

sufficient to form expert opinions about what Philip

Morris knew about compensation and when it knew it,
you could not arrive at an opinion as to whether
Philip Morris manipulated the FTC on the issue of
compensation and the FTC testing method, correct?
would be missing a vital input.

MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.

THE WITNESS: Well, I certainly have not in

a systematic way studied Philip Morris internal

documents. I mean, I hear numbers of multiple

 

And let me explain what I

I also object to the form of

1 hundreds of millions of internal documents, and so I 3

2 don't know whether that number is even in the

3 ballpark, but it's a lot. I haven't done that.

4 In these cases I have seen quite a few

5 documents that Plaintiffs' attorneys have shown me,

6 internal documents, and I haven't seen one, as I

7 mentioned in answer to the prior question, that goes

8 to the issue of whether Philip Morris was manipulating
9 the Federal Trade Commission.

10 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

11 Q. Okay. Let me —— because you brought it up,
12 Dr. English, let me kind of explore your understanding
13 of an expert witness testifying. You've been retained
14 by Philip Morris to offer expert opinions in their

15 case—in—chief, correct?

16 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

17 THE WITNESS: And case—in—chief is ——

18 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

19 Q. When they put their case on, they are going
20 to call you as a witness and you're going to testify.
21 A. Okay. Is that what "case—in—chief" means?
22 Q. Yeah.

23 A. Okay.

24 Q. And you also say that you reserve the right

1 to testify in rebuttal to anything our experts put on,
2 correct?

3 A. I believe that's correct, yes.

4 Q. Okay. And so it is my job to cross—examine
5 you on the opinions that you've expressed. You

6 understand that, correct?

7 A. I'm not sure I know what your job is if

8 Q. Okay.

9 A. —— but I'll take that.
10 Q. But it's not my job to cross—examine you on
11 a topic that is not addressed in your direct
12 testimony. In other words, you have not in your
13 direct testimony said, in sum or substance, I

14 understand that the Plaintiffs allege that Philip
15 Morris and the other tobacco companies knew important
16 information about compensation which they did not

17 provide to the FTC, thereby misleading the FTC, and I

18 have studied the internal documents of the tobacco
19 companies, which are available at
20 tobaccodocuments.org, and I have made a systematic

21 study of both those internal documents and the
22 documents relating to the communication between the
23 tobacco industry and the FTC with respect to

24 compensation and the FTC method, and I conclude that

1 there was no manipulation.
2 MR. ROSENTEAL: I object to that
3 characterization.

4 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

5 Q. Now, if you had put that in your expert

6 report, Dr. English, you can be sure I would be

7 crosseexamining you. Okay? But you did not do a

8 systematic study of the tobacco company documents on
9 tobaccodocuments.org, correct?
10 A. No, I did not do that.
11 Q. And you do not have an expert opinion on
12 what the internal Philip Morris documents show about
13 what Philip Morris knew about compensation and when
14 they knew it, correct?
15 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
16 THE WITNESS: Well, I certainly have seen a
17 lot of documents shown to me by Plaintiffs' attorneys
18 about that. I have not made a systematic —— and I

19 think I do address that in my report. There is a
20 portion in there that talks about this issue.

21 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

22 Q. Right, but that's —— I know what you're
23 referring to.
24 A. Okay.

2 documents from Dr. Burns.

3 A. Uh—huh. That's not what I'm referring to.
4 Q. What are you referring to?

5 THE WITNESS: Do you have it there?

6 MR. ROSENTHAL: You have your report in

7 front of you. Feel free to look through.

8 I don't want to coach the witness. I'm

9 happy to clarify what we intend to do so you're on
10 notice.
11 MR. SURPRENANT: Well ——
12 MR. ROSENTHAL: I think his report speaks
13 for itself, and the reason you're getting the answers
14 you are is you are intentionally asking the question
15 in a very precise way to get a certain answer, which

16 you're then twisting the meaning of it. That's the ——
17 MR. SURPRENANI: I agree with the first half

18 and I disagree with the second half.

19 MR. ROSENIHAL: Just because you may not

20 have done a systematic study on one particular website
21 does not mean you don't have opinions on specific

22 issues.

23 MR. SURPRENANI: We're now getting —— okay.

2 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

3 Q. Well, I'm quite familiar with that, but

4 let's go back to how expert medical historian reaches
5 expert conclusions. You would first have to frame a
6 historical inquiry, which is, what do the internal

7 documents of the tobacco industry indicate what they
8 knew on the issue of compensation and when they knew

9 it. And then you would have to do a systematic study

10 of those documents to reach an expert conclusion. You
11 haven't framed that inquiry and you haven't done that
12 analysis, correct?

13 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.

14 THE WITNESS: I have not looked at a

15 systematic View —— I haven't —— actually I don't know
16 whether I've seen all the Philip Morris documents on
17 compensation. I do know that in the Price—Miles case
18 there were lots of documents there, and I looked at
19 every document that Plaintiffs introduced in the case
20 dealing with compensation.

21 But getting back to the systematic, I have
22 not done or trying to identify every possible

23 compensation document. That's something that I have
24 not done.

2 Q. And you haven't —— you haven't done a
3 systematic analysis of the communications between the
4 tobacco companies and the FTC on compensation and the
5 FTC testing method and maintaining its use, correct?
6 MR. ROSFNTHAL: Objection.
7 THE WITNESS: Okay. Again, I have not done
8 it in a systemic way, and, I mean, I haven't seen any
9 document that would —— that could be interpreted as
10 manipulating. I anticipate that someone might show me

11 one of those, and then I'll study it and give an
12 opinion, if I haven't seen it already.

13 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

14 Q. Okay. Now, so —— now let me go back. Let
15 me go back. Did you know there was an allegation in
16 this case that the internal documents from Philip
17 Morris and the other tobacco companies indicated they
18 knew important information about compensation and

19 addiction that they did not reveal to the FTC in such

20 a way that the FTC was misled into the adoption and

21 maintaining the use of the FTC testing method? You're
22 aware that that is a contention that is made in this
23 case, correct?

24 A. I'm actually not aware of that.

ssoo54rsss

Page 191 

 

Page 191

1 Q. Okay. Are you aware that that contention
2 has been made in other cases in which you were an

3 expert?

4 A. I can't remember whether that was ——

5 particularly the FTC? I mean, I think in PriceeMiles
6 there was some allegation about whether the Surgeon
7 General was misled in that 1981 Surgeon General's

8 Report. That's a little different than the Federal

9 Trade Commission. But beyond that I can't go. I
10 don't know —— I don't know all the allegations in each
11 of the cases that I've been an expert in.
12 Q. Well, how did you arrive at what topics you
13 would consider in your direct expert testimony?
14 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
15 THE WITNESS: You mean in my report?

16 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

17 Q. Yes.

18 A. Is what the public health community knew.
19 Q. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you.
20 I know what —— you've told me before what your

21 historical inquiry was. How did you choose those

22 topics?
23 MR. ROSENTHAL: Same objection.

1 Q. Those were the topics that the tobacco

2 companies' lawyers indicated that they wanted you to
3 address in your expert report, correct?

4 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection.

5 THE WITNESS: Tn broad strokes, yes.

6 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

7 Q. Right. And so they could have told you,

8 Dr. English, you're our only medical historian expert

9 and we want you to address in an expert way, based on
10 systematic study that satisfies the rigors of medical
11 historical research, whether Philip Morris and the

12 other tobacco companies manipulated the FTC by
13 withholding important information from compensation.

14 They could have asked you to do that inquiry and

15 that's an inquiry you would have been capable of

16 doing.

17 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection.

18 THE WITNESS: Well, they could have asked
19 me. I'm not entirely sure that T have the expertise

20 to do that in the sense that, if you're talking about
2l scientific studies and information, I probably

22 could —— could do some of that. If you're talking

23 about all the other possibilities that might exist,

24 that would probably get out of my expertise.

2 Q. Okay. Now, I just realized I need to ask a
3 question. Is the FTC —— is this, my graph 10, this

4 orphan of my imagination, is it mis—graphed?

5 A. I think so.

6 Q. Because the FTC is a member of the public

7 health community.

8 A. Yes. I think so. Especially in tobacco and
9 in this particular issue because I think the Federal
10 Trade Commission certainly worked in concert with the

11 public health community in getting information about
12 tar and nicotine out to the American public.
13 If anything, I would reverse the arrow from

14 the public health community to FTC, but I really think

15 the FTC is part of the public health community.

16 Q. Okay. I'm going to make a modification to
17 this orphan of my imagination. I will draw a box
18 around FTC, arrow, public health community, and put

19 public health community on the box.

20 And what I'm attempting to do now,

21 Dr. English, is to put the public health —— the FTC ——
22 within the public health community, but indicate what
23 is substantially addressed in your expert report,

24 which is the FTC's communication to other members of

Page 194 
1 the public health community. a

2 A. I'd reverse the arrow. I mean, I think that

3 it was the public health community that asked the FTC,

4 persuaded the FTC, to take up —— to essentially
5 reverse its position on tar and nicotine in
6 advertising in 1966, and then from that point on we're

7 collaborating with the public health community.
8 Q. Okay. I'll mark out that arrow and I'll
9 put the arrow the other way. Is that ——

10 A. I think that —— I think it goes back and

11 forth, but ——

12 Q. There would be an arrow on both sides.

13 A. Arrow on both sides. But I think it's a
14 bigger arrow the other way.

15 Q. Okay. And then I'm going to make another

16 change to my Exhibit 10, which where it now says

17 tobacco companies including Philip Morris manipulating
18 the FTC, I'm going to add "and other members of the

19 public health community."

20 MR. ROSENTHAL: I object to —— I mean,

21 you're asking questions on a series of words contained
22 within your Easter Island bubble. You then add words
23 to the bubble after you've asked the questions.

24 MR. SURFRENANT: Well, but it‘s clear ——

2 that I'm doing it.
3 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
4 Q. And this is obviously trial like. You can
5 take this examination at trial. You build graphs all

6 the time.

7 And I realize, Doctor *7 Dr. English es that
8 I have been leaving out a part of my question that I
9 am now going to put into the question, which is, you
10 have not made a study of the internal documents of the
11 tobacco companies on the issue of compensation and the

12 FIG testing method to determine if the tobacco
13 industry, not only misled the FTC, but also misled the

14 public health community by withholding important

15 information about addiction and compensation.

16 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.

17 THE WITNESS: Well, I mean, I —— as I said,
18 on systematic, no. I have seen many, many documents
19 shown to me by attorneys, Plaintiffs' attorneys, about
20 Philip Morris's knowledge of compensation. I have not
21 seen any significant piece of information about

22 compensation that was not already in the public health
23 community's knowledge. In some ways the public health
24 community had superior knowledge in many ways.

2 Q. Superior knowledge than?
3 A. It seems ——
4 MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him finish.

5 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
6 Q. Oh, I'm sorry.
7 A. Seems to have had even greater knowledge

8 than Philip Morris, at least in the documents that

9 I've seen. So, you know, I simply cannot subscribe to
10 the use of manipulating. I just haven't seen the
11 evidence for that.
12 Q. All right. But there is a difference
13 between saying the Plaintiffs' attorneys haven't
14 provided you the evidence and what I believe we've
15 established here today, which is you have not done ——
16 you do not have expert testimony, an expert opinion,
17 on what Philip Morris knew about compensation and when
18 it knew it, correct?
19 MR. ROSENIHAL: Objection to
20 characterization.
21 THE WITNESS: Well, what I've said that I've
22 not done in a systematic fashion, I've seen lots of
23 documents about that and we just answered that, but,

24 beyond that, I can't go.

7 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection.

18 know a lot about the ETC and the public health

19 community, so, you know, if I had seen some documents
20 indicating manipulation, I might have an opinion about
21 them, but, you're correct, T have not made a

22 systematic judgment —— systematic research.

3 companies and the public health community, including

4 the FTC and non—FTC constituents of the public health

5 community, on the issue of compensation and addiction,
6 correct?

7 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection.

8 THE WITNESS: I thought that was the same

9 question you just asked me before.

10 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

11 Q. No. My question —— it shows the beauty of
12 these charts, despite their ungainly nature, I was

13 asking about internal tobacco company documents. Now
14 I'm changing it to communications between the tobacco
15 companies and the public health community. You

16 haven't made a systematic study of that either,

17 correct?

18 MR. ROSENTEAL: Same objection.

19 THE WITNESS: Again, I have not made a

20 systematic study of all the communications between

21 Philip Morris and the ETC or all the communications

22 that Philip Morris may have had with the Surgeon
23 General or the American Cancer Society. I don't ——

14 FIG and PHC, public health community, to reflect

15 Dr. English's testimony that the FTC is actually

16 within the community of the public health community,
17 and then I put an arrow on both ends of the arrow, of

18 the line between FTC and public health community, to

19 reflect the testimony that there were communications
20 each way. I drew these two lines and put "internal PM
21 docs."

7 and attached hereto.)
8 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
9 Q. What I have at the top, and I'll show it to

10 you in a moment, Dr. English, what the public health

11 community knew and understood about compensation and
12 when it knew it versus what Philip Morris and the

13 tobacco industry knew and understood about

14 compensation and when they knew it.

15 Now, you have studied in a systematic way
16 sufficient to allow you to reach expert opinions ——

17 strike that.

18 You believe, as an expert medical historian,
19 that you have studied with sufficient rigor and

20 sufficient consideration of relevant sources to reach
21 a conclusion about what the public health community

22 knew and understood about compensation and when they
23 knew it, correct?

24 A. I think so, yes.

1 Q. Now, what you haven't done and what you do
2 not have an expert opinion on is what Philip Morris

3 and the tobacco industry knew and understood about

4 compensation and when they knew it. You've seen some
5 documents that have been shown to you by Plaintiffs'
6 attorneys in other cases, but you have not made a

7 systematic study of that topic, and, therefore, you do

8 not have expert opinions on that topic as a medical

9 historian, correct?
10 MR. ROSENIHAL: Objection.
11 THE WITNESS: Well, let me just say how it's
12 happened in other cases and you can say whether

13 something like that might happen in this case. In

14 other words, when I've been shown a document from
15 Philip Morris, I'm asked an expert opinion about
16 whether that document represents knowledge that was

17 not generally available in the public health

18 community.

19 In other words, I don't think I have to

20 know —— do research on every possible document that
21 Philip Morris had in order to be able to make —— have
22 an opinion about a single document, usually one

23 introduced by Plaintiffs, with a claim that it really

24 is superior knowledge than what the public health

1 community is. I've been shown those documents, and
2 then I would make —— have an opinion about whether the
3 public health community actually knew this particular

4 point. I mean, that's the way it's gone in the past.
5 And I suspect that that's what may happen in this
6 case, but I'm —— I'm not certain about that.

7 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

8 Q. Well, if I have my hands on the wheel, it

9 won't, okay? If I were to look in your report, if I
10 were to ask you, Dr. English, can you point me in your
11 report where you address in a systematic way
12 sufficient to allow you to reach expert conclusions

13 the topic, what Philip Morris and the tobacco industry
14 knew and understood about compensation and when they

15 knew it, would there be a part of the report you could

16 point me to?
17 MR. ROSENIEAL: Objection.
18 THE WITNESS: It would be that same

19 paragraph. What did I say, 65?

20 MR. ROSENTHAL: 68 .

21 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

22 Q. 68.

23 A. 68? It would be that —— that particular

24 paragraph.

1 Q. Is this a new paragraph on this report or

2 is this paragraph appeared in other reports?

3 A. I believe it's appeared in other reports.

4 Q. Okay. Do you recall why you first inserted
5 it into your report?

6 A. My recollection is that it covered the

7 general issue that we're talking about here this

8 afternoon, in that in many —— in some of the trials

9 I've been in, I was thinking particularly of the
10 Miles—Price one, I was asked questions about whether a
11 particular Philip Morris document or Philip Morris

12 study was, you know, how that fit into what the public

13 health community knew, what was it —— did it show

14 superior knowledge, no difference, and in a general

15 way sort of covers that —— the issue of that.

16 Q. Okay. So am I correct that the sum and

17 substance of your discussion of the topic of what

18 Philip Morris and the tobacco industry knew or

19 understood about compensation and when they knew it,
20 the sum and substance, the totality of that discussion

21 is in paragraph 68?

22 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
23 THE WITNESS: That's, I believe, is the only
24 place where I discuss it in the report.

2 Q. Okay. And so ——
3 A. But, I mean, the knowledge, I mean, comes
4 from the documents, I mean, the knowledge is not

5 actually in the paragraph.

6 Q. Right.

7 A. Okay.

8 Q. And so you say, on page 28, the last

9 sentence of paragraph 68: I've reviewed documents

10 identified by Plaintiffs in support of this allegation
11 in previous litigation. "This allegation" being ——

12 strike that. Let me start that again.

13 The first sentence of paragraph 68 says, I'm
14 aware that in previous litigation against these
15 tobacco company defendants —— who does that refer to,

16 Philip Morris?

17 A. Yes.

18 Q. And how do you say the corporate parent? I
19 can never get it right. Altria?

20 A. Altria?

21 MR. ROSENTHAL: I think technically it's

22 Altria ——
23 MR. SURPRENANI: Is that a made—up name?

24 MR. ROSENIHAL: What do you mean by

1 "made—up"?

2 MR. SURPRENANI: Does it refer to anything
3 in the real world or did some marketing person invent
4 it?

5 MR. ROSENIHAL: The short answer is I don't
6 know.

7 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

8 Q. I mean, what was —— didn't, like, they
9 spend millions of dollars coming up with Cingular?
10 And remember when AIaI became Cingular and ——
11 MR. ROSENTHAL: Verizon is made up too.
12 It's a derivation of the Latin for truth or something

13 like that.

14 THE WITNESS: So not horizon.
15 MR. SURPRENANI: Right. The phrase, the
16 slogan of my law school is "in vino veritas." No,

17 it's not. It does have "veritas," but I don't think
18 it has "vino."

19 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

20 Q. Paragraph 68. I'm aware that in previous
2l litigation against these tobacco defendants —— tobacco
22 company defendants —— some plaintiffs have alleged

23 that had the tobacco company defendants disclosed

24 their knowledge about compensation in the 1970's, the

 

 

Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.

Page 206 

 

Page 206 

1 conclusion of the 1981 Surgeon General Report would
2 have been different.
3 So that's the conclusion we're talking

4 about. And then to skip to the last paragraph, you

5 say: I have reviewed documents identified by

6 Plaintiffs in support of this allegation in previous

7 litigation and am unaware of any Defendants internal

8 study that reflects information not known to the

9 public health community about compensation by
10 increasing the number of cigarette smoked per day, the
11 one form of compensation not taken into account by

12 epidemiology.
13 Okay. So this kind of relates to what I'm

14 talking about, but it's clearly different and much

15 more narrow. And so I am correct that, in your

16 report, you do not address in a systematic way that
17 would allow you to reach conclusions of a medical

18 historian what Philip Morris and the tobacco industry
19 knew and understood about compensation and when they
20 knew it, correct?

21 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.

22 THE WITNESS: With the way I've tried to
23 answer that question before, I've not made a

24 systematic attempt. I have been asked to analyze

1 documents shown to me by Plaintiffs' attorneys and I ﬂ
2 do try to put it into the context that I did in that

3 paragraph in my report and in the context that we

4 talked about earlier.

5 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

6 O. Okay. Now, I take that into account.

7 A. Okay.

8 Q. I understand what you're saying,

9 Dr. English, but logically you cannot reach an expert
10 conclusion as a medical historian about whether the
11 public health community knew and understood everything
12 Philip Morris and the tobacco industry knew about
13 compensation and that they knew about it at the same
14 time because you don't have the antecedent expert
15 opinion about what Philip Morris and the tobacco
16 industry knew and understood about compensation and
17 when they knew it, correct?
18 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
19 THE WITNESS: Well, I'm not sure I entirely
20 understand your question, but I do know what the
21 public health community knew and understood about
22 compensation. And as for whether Philip Morris knew
23 anything different or anything better or more helpful,
24 it's the same answer I've given —— I've tried to

1 give —— in a couple other issues —— questions —— and ﬂ

2 that is I have seen lots of documents shown to me. I
3 don't think I need to View every document that Philip

4 Morris had about compensation to be able to ask ——

5 answer is the question, again, as an expert in medical
6 history about whether this particular document that

7 I'm being shown would have changed in any material way
8 the public health community's understanding about

9 compensation.

10 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

11 Q. Do you know who Dr. Burns is?

12 A. I do.

13 Q. Dr. Burns disagrees with you, doesn't he.

14 A. He does.

15 Q. Okay. Now, tobaccodocuments.org, that

16 contains millions of documents, right?

17 A. I don't know that. That's my understanding,

18 but we talked about that earlier.

19 Q. Now, if you wanted to form an independent
20 expert opinion about what Philip Morris knew about
21 compensation and when they knew it, that is something

22 you certainly could do simply with the documents that
23 are available on tobaccodocuments.org, correct?

3 what their documents are.

4 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

5 Q. But you understand that what
6 tobaccodocuments.org is, it's an archive that was
7 created as part of the 1998 master settlement, and it
8 contains millions of pages of internal public ——
9 internal tobacco —— company ——
10 MR. ROSENTEAL: Nice ring tone.
11 MR. SURPRENANT: Yeah. But, you know, if
12 you have that and it goes off in a judge's presence in
13 a courtroom, it will be in the last pocket you look
14 in.
15 THE WITNESS: There is a message there.
16 MR. SURPRENANT: Turn it off. Let the
17 record reflect I, once again, had Dr. English on the
18 ropes and that call was actually from Mr. Rosenthal's
19 secretary.

4 A. I can't say ——

6 THE WITNESS: And I certainly can't ——

7 (Cell phone.)

8 MR. SURPRENANT: This was actually my

9 secretary. I talked to her about travel plans and I

10 told her I would call her back.

11 MR. ROSENTEAL: Actually I want Dr. English
12 to have the opportunity to fully answer since that

13 went off in the middle of his answer.

14 MR. SURPRENANT: No, why don't we do this.

15 Why don't you re—read the question, re—read the

16 answer, and then you can finish your answer.

17 MR. ROSENTHAL: Okay.

18 (Record read.)

19 THE WITNESS: I certainly don't know that.
20 I'm taking your representation. But particularly I

21 have no idea whether there are studies on compensation
22 or on the archive, whether it's their scientific

23 studies, whether it's their scientific meetings,

24 whether it has to do with perhaps some corporate

1 conversations. I just don't know what's in it so I

2 can't make a conversation on that.

3 But I haven't studied everything, but I do
4 feel comfortable evaluating documents that I'm shown,
5 especially when the question is, is this information
6 materially different than was already —— that the ——

7 did the public health community already know those
8 subjects.

9 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
10 Q. I take it, it is your opinion that the
11 publication of Monograph 13 in 2001 was when the

12 public health community no longer believed that

13 lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes were safer than
14 higher tar and nicotine cigarettes, correct?

15 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.

16 THE WITNESS: I don't think that's quite

17 what I say in my report. What I think what happened

18 in Monograph 13 was that the public health community

19 concluded that it could no longer recommend low tar

20 and nicotine cigarettes to smokers as a third—tier

21 recommendation.

22 In other words, before —— up until that

23 point the primary message was don't smoke, stop if you
24 are, last, third tier, was, if you're going to smoke,

1 smoke low tar. I think Monograph 13 took that third 3

2 tier off the table.

3 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

4 Q. Why? What's your understanding?

5 A. Iook ee the understanding that low tar and
6 nicotine cigarettes were —— were —— that it was ——

7 that it was a strategy for smokers. In other words, I

8 think there was enough doubt at that point. But I
9 don't think necessarily that everyone concluded that
10 low—tar cigarettes didn't have some kind of health

11 advantage. I think what they decided they couldn't

12 make the recommendation. Because I think what we've
13 seen in the last, you know, six, seven, eight years is
14 people are continuing to study it. And so, I mean, I

15 think there is still an interest in there. Whether it

16 will come back as a recommendation at some point, I

17 don't know. But currently now I don't know of any

18 public health organization that recommends low—tar

19 cigarettes to smokers who refuse to quit.

20 Q. And are you aware of any members of the

21 public health community who believe the designation of
22 "Light" as in Marlboro Light is misleading and causes
23 public health concerns?

Page 213 

1 THE WITNESS: I think up until around

2 Monograph 13 there wasn't any discussion about the

3 term "Light" in this country. I think there was some
4 in Canada and I believe there was some in Great

5 Britain. I think since then there has been I see in

6 Surgeon General's Reports and the like that there is a
7 discussion about some concern about using those terms.
8 And, of course, we know that Congress passed a law

9 saying, you know, that those terms cannot be used

10 until the FDA determines whether they have some
11 validity. But up until then I don't see —— I'm not
12 sure I see any comment about the descriptors.

1 health benefit versus smoking Marlboro Reds?

2 MR. ROSENIRAL: Objection to form.

3 THE WITNESS: No. Certainly there is

4 nothing I've studied, so I don't —— I don't have an
5 opinion on that.

6 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
7 Q. Have you studied whether 77 have you

8 studied whether Marlboro Light cigarettes are actually

9 riskier than Marlboro Reds because of compensation and
10 the deeper and more frequent and more prolonged puffs
11 that a compensating smoker takes?

12 A. In particular have I looked at Marlboro

13 Light? No, I haven't done that.

14 Q. Have you looked at Light cigarettes in
15 general along those lines?
16 A. Okay. Let's go back to your question about

17 have I looked at ——

18 Q. Whether Light cigarettes are actually
19 riskier from a health perspective due to the
20 compensating smoker taking more frequent and deeper

21 puffs.
22 A. You know, the public health community —— I
23 have to answer the question, what did the public

24 health community believe. And I think there has

 

 

Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.
312-421-3377

3990547622


Page 215 

 

Page 215 

1 always been a concern that some smokers could

2 compensate and get more tar and nicotine from low—tar
3 cigarettes, and —— but whether —— I certainly haven't
4 come to the —— seen them come to the conclusion that

5 all smokers get more dangerous substances from smoking
6 low—tar cigarettes. I just —— I haven't —— I haven't
7 come across that kind of conclusion.

8 Q. Okay. I'm going to be kind of switching

9 topics kind of back and forth here. There is, as I
10 referred to before, there is an agreement among the
11 parties that what would otherwise be allowable expert
12 testimony or lines of inquiry, the parties have agreed

13 on both sides that they won't do that, they won't

14 engage.

15 And one of the things that I don't intend to
16 examine you on, Dr. English, is communications you

17 have had with the Philip Morris lawyers except to the

18 extent, if any, that you have relied on those

19 communications in preparing your expert report or

20 reaching conclusions.

21 And I just call that out because we're going

22 to be kind of around that topic, and please let
23 Mr. Rosenthal have sufficient time to object, and, if

24 he chooses, instruct you not to answer if he thinks my

1 question goes over the line.

2 But I don't think this one does because I

3 think the way I phrase it you necessarily will have

4 relied on, I think —— okay. Let me just ask the

5 question.

6 Of the information that you have relied on
7 in reaching the expert opinions contained in your

8 expert report, what information was supplied to you by
9 tobacco companies or lawyers working for tobacco
10 companies?
11 Now, let me kind of, before you answer that

12 question, Dr. English, just observe that the present

13 report goes back a number of years and has been
14 through a number of iterations, and so I‘m talking
15 about over the trajectory or the evolution of what is

16 the expert report that I have marked for

17 identification as ——
18 MR. ROSENTHAL: I believe it's 7.
19 MR. SURPRENANT: —— as Exhibit 8.

20 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

21 Q. Does any of that material, was that

22 originally provided to you by the tobacco companies or
23 their lawyers?

24 MR. ROSENIHAL: I object to the form, but

1 you may answer.
2 THE WITNESS: Well, we almost would have to
3 go through source by source. I mean, the vast

4 majority of material in the report I found along ——
5 along the way. Sometimes, though, I request that a
6 tobacco company attorney send me the materials,

7 especially if they aren't available at Duke in the

8 library. And so I do get material sometimes from

9 them. And from time to time, you know, a small
10 percentage of the time they send me materials they
11 want me to look at and consider. But we would almost
12 have to go through —— and I'm not sure that, if we did

13 it today, I would be able to tell you exactly how I

14 obtained, you know, the information about every
15 subject there or on my reliance list. But if you
16 want —— do you have a question about a particular
17 document?

18 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

19 Q. No, I was just asking you in general.

20 A. Okay. I can try, but I'm not sure at this
21 point I would be able to say, but, as a general rule,
22 the vast majority of the ones I identified, but some

23 of the ones I actually physically get hold of using

24 the attorneys as a document procurement facility.

1 Q. Right. Let me tell you where I'm going.
2 Either later on today —— and I have a feeling that we
3 will continue tomorrow but that we will be done before

4 lunch and maybe by midmorning, but one of the things I
5 do want to do is to go through your report. I'm not

6 going to go through every line. That would take us up
7 through 6 p.m. tomorrow, and I'm not going to torture
8 either of us in that fashion. But I will be asking

9 you about how you learned of particular documents. I
10 won't do that in that comprehensive way. But let me

11 try to get at it at least a little differently.

12 As I understand from some of your earlier

13 depositions, and I think you referred to it here, you
14 have a chronology of documents that relate to the

15 tobacco issues you've looked at, correct?

16 A. Uh—huh, I do.

17 Q. And you write notes on the documents as

18 you're examining them, correct?

19 A. Yes.

20 Q. And then when you draft your report you

21 essentially get the documents out and kind of string

22 together, at least in part, put together the notes you
23 had previously written on the documents; is that

24 correct?

2 Q. Okay. And you started working for

3 Kirkland —— Kirkland —— Arnold & Porter in 1988, your
4 first retention, correct?

5 A. Yes.

6 Q. Worked for a couple of years and you had a
7 file.

13 Q. Okay. Have you kind of continued to build

14 on that original file?

15 A. I have built on it, but I've also weeded as
16 time goes just because of space.

17 Q. Okay. How big is your chronology file?

18 A. It is two shelves, floor to ceiling shelves,
19 and then a number of file cabinet drawers. I'm not

20 sure how many linear feet it is.

22 full of documents. And how are the documents housed,
23 in binders or boxes?

2 additional file cabinet drawers?

3 A. Yes.

4 Q. And so that is a document repository that

5 you have been building for two years, 1988 through

6 1990, '91, and then from 2000 to the present; is that

7 correct?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. And some of those documents have been
10 obtained by the work of people under your direction
11 and supervision, such as paralegals, correct?
12 A. Yes, but in that case only in the City of
13 Missouri case.
14 Q. Okay. The City of Missouri case was the
15 singular time you used paralegals to do research?
16 A. Yes.
17 O. Okay. And have you had research
18 assistants?
19 A. I've had the one that I mentioned earlier.
20 Q. Okay. And some of the time, in terms of
21 that document repository, it would contain documents
22 that you knew about but did not have ready access to,
23 so you asked the tobacco company, Philip Morris
24 lawyers or the tobacco company lawyers, to provide

1 you, but it was really at your request. They were

2 just giving you data you knew about and asked for,

3 correct?

4 A. Yes.

5 Q. But occasionally they have sent you

6 documents and said, in sum or substance, Dr. English,

7 we'd like you to take a look at these.

8 A. Sure.

9 Q. And at this point in time, if we were to go
10 through your expert report and ask with respect to
11 every exhibit you list, in some cases you would not be
12 able to remember how it got into your document
13 repository.
14 A. I think that's a fair summary.
15 Q. Okay. I apologize for switching between my
16 sight glasses and my reading glasses. I tried using,

17 what are they called ——

18 MR. ROSENTEAL: Bifocals?

19 MR. SURPRENANT: Not bifocals.

20 THE WITNESS: Graduated.

21 MR. SURPRENANT: Yeah. And I was dizzy for
22 three weeks.

23 THE WITNESS: You have to persist. You have
24 to persevere.

1 MR. SURPRENANT: I was dizzy for three

2 weeks. I was tired of being dizzy. But what has

3 happened is, I'm going to have to solve this problem

4 because, if I tried a case like this, the jury would

5 hate me because the jury pays attention to little tics

6 like that.

7 There is actually something called

8 True—Focus. They are relatively ugly glasses. They
9 have a switch right here and they are like a camera.
10 And you can switch them to length and distance and
11 reading and anywhere in between. But that would be
12 even a more gruesome tic for the jury to get
13 distracted by.

14 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

15 Q. Okay. I think you may agree or disagree on
16 some of these points. Let me see.

17 Would you agree that the availability of

18 information to the public health community does not

19 equate to the public health community necessarily

2O understanding that information?

21 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

22 THE WITNESS: You're talking about a

23 particular piece of information or this is some sort

24 of global statement about ——

2 Q. Well, let's start off ——
3 A. I mean, is this like it's available
4 somewhere in the universe and —— I mean, I'm not sure

5 exactly how this applies to this case, but could

6 you ——

7 Q. Fair enough, Dr. English. Let me ask that.
8 As a general, theoretical matter, the fact that

9 information is available to the public health
10 community in the United States does not mean that it
11 is necessarily understood by every member of the
12 public health community or understood in the same way,
13 correct?
14 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection to form.
15 THE WITNESS: I think I agree with most of

16 that. Of course, you know, in no public health

17 decision does everyone agree, so that's sort of a
18 standard, You know. There is always some —— there is
19 always an outlier.

20 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

21 Q. In any of your work as a medical historian
22 have you attempted to address what information was

23 available to the —— to just the general public?

24 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection to the form.

1 THE WITNESS: I haven't really —— I mean, ﬂ

2 let me put it this way, I certainly haven't tried to

3 understand what the public understood about these

4 issues. I mean, I certainly read a lot of Gallup

5 polls and all that, but I certainly know what ee what
6 the public health community tried to communicate, some
7 of that's in the report, about this information about

8 the benefits of low—tar cigarettes, but actually what
9 the public took away from that information I don't
10 know.
11 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
12 Q. Okay. Let me follow that up and try to
13 flesh it out a little bit. I was a smoker off and on
14 in the late '70s until April 1st, 1988. I smoked a
15 low—tar cigarette, Merits. I understood that it had
16 health benefits over non—Light cigarettes. And prior
17 to getting on this case a few months ago I would have
18 said that I thought it was common knowledge that Light
19 cigarettes were not as dangerous as full—flavored
20 cigarettes. And I would have never heard of
21 Monograph 13 or the FTC testing method or
22 compensation. And I take it that illustrates that
23 there is a big difference with respect to the public

24 of what information is, guote/unguote, available and

1 what any individual member of the public actually

2 knows about it, correct?

3 MR. ROSENIHAL: Objection to form.

4 THE WITNESS: I think that's a good —— a

5 good assessment. I mean, I don't know what individual

6 smokers thought about this. You clearly had an

7 opinion that you now remember two decades later. I'm
8 not sure, you know —— there are people who study
9 memories and what, you know, how valid your memory

10 actually is —— we're not going to get into that —— but

11 there are people who study that as well, but that's
12 just not something that I've studied.

13 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

14 Q. No. I mean, my —— my belief, what I just
15 said, is that it was obvious that a Light cigarette
16 had health benefits over regular cigarettes, that's
17 something I would have believed in 2009, in early

18 2010.

19 A. Uh—huh.

20 Q. And so I think with respect to the public
21 we would agree that there is a big difference with
22 respect to the public about what information is

23 available and what any individual member of the public
24 understands and what he or she has incorporated into

2 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection to form.

3 THE WITNESS: Again, I have not studied it
4 in consumer perceptions.

5 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
6 O. Okay. Let me kind of continue on the topic
7 that we have been on and addressed several times

8 today. With respect to the public health community, I

9 take it you —— well, do you agree that awareness of
10 information does not equate to acceptance of the
11 information?
12 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection to form.
13 THE WITNESS: Are you talking about within

14 the public health community?

15 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

16 O. Yes.
17 A. I suppose that they could be aware of an
18 idea and not accept it. As a general principle, I can

19 accept that.

20 Q. Do you know whether the public health

21 community has considered whether global warming,

22 climate change, poses public health risks?

23 A. You know, that's certainly not something

24 I've studied.

1 Q. I mean, certainly there is a lot of
2 information available about climate change and global
3 warming, but at least ostensibly there is members of

4 the public who don't agree that it poses the risk that

5 other people agree with, correct?

6 A. Now we're talking about global warming?

7 Q. Yeah.

8 A. But we were talking about the public health
9 community. There is a difference there. But, I mean,

10 I'm sure that, yes, there appear to be quite a lot of

11 opinions about the causes, whether global warming
12 exists at all, and what the consequences might be.
13 Q. I think this is a question that I can ask

14 you, though, again, I would give Mr. Rosenthal time to
15 object, if he inaccurately believes it trenches on

16 areas I shouldn't be asking about. I think it is only

17 lawyers who use "trenching" as a verb.

18 MR. ROSENTHAL: I've never heard anyone use
19 "trenching" as a verb.

20 MR. SURPRENANI: Io trench on? That means
21 to invade.

22 THE WITNESS: Io slog?

23 MR. SURPRENANI: No, slog is different.

24 Irench on means to improperly invade ——

3 MR. SURPRENANT: Encroach.

4 MR. ROSENTHAL: But I've never heard
5 "trench." Anyway, ask away.

6 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

7 Q. Would you have expected is and I'm not
8 asking for communications. I'm asking for your
9 subjective expectations. Would you have expected the

10 Philip Morris lawyers, if they knew of a Philip Morris

11 document that, fairly read, contradicted the opinions
12 in your expert report, would you have expected them to
13 have shown you that document so you would be aware of
14 it?

15 MR. ROSENTHAL: I object to form, but you
16 can answer.

17 THE WITNESS: I would hope that they would
18 have shown me that document.

19 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

21 correct?

4 Q. Can you think of any Light product where

5 you get more of the bad stuff in the Light than you

6 get in the regular if you consume the same amount?

7 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection to form and

8 competency.

9 THE WITNESS: I'm not sure I can do that. I
10 was thinking, with diet soda, you get more of
11 aspartame, which some people say might be more harmful

12 than high fructose corn syrup, but that really does
13 get me into an area where I don't have any opinion.
14 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

15 Q. Like Light beer, that has less of the bad

16 stuff than full—flavored, than non—Light beer,

17 correct?

18 MR. ROSENTEAL: Same objections.

20 beer.

1 Morris employee or executive, correct?

2 A. I don't think so, but I —— I can't be 100%
3 sure.

4 Q. Now, why haven't you made a systematic

5 study of the depositions that have been taken of
6 Philip Morris executives in the tobacco cases in order
7 to gain a real broad and deep insight into what Philip
8 Morris knew and when it knew what it knew on the issue
9 of smoking and health?
10 MR. ROSENIHAL: Objection to form.
11 THE WITNESS: What my task was was looking
12 at the scientific community and the public health
13 community. I don't put Philip Morris executives in
14 that category. And I haven't looked at them.
15 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
16 Q. Do you have an expert understanding of what
17 test Philip Morris did on compensation prior to
18 launching Marlboro Lights?

20 Q. Do you know when Philip Morris launched

21 Marlboro Lights?

22 A. I believe it was 1971.

24 Morris documents about marketing and advertising for

2 what messages Philip Morris was trying to communicate

3 to the consuming public?

4 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form, compound.
5 THE WITNESS: NO.

6 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
7 Q. Have you ever heard of the term of "Light"
8 cigarettes being referred to as a health assurance

9 product?

10 A. I think in one of the documents I've been
11 shown there may have been that phrase in there, but,
12 beyond that, I can't —— I can't go any further.

13 Q. And you don't have any understanding or
14 information or knowledge about whether or not Philip

15 Morris developed and marketed Light, Marlboro Lights,

16 as a health assurance product because of concerns that
17 people without a health assurance cigarette
18 alternative available would otherwise quit or attempt

19 to quit?

20 A. I don't —— I don't have an opinion on that.
21 Q. Do you have opinion either as a

22 pediatrician or as a medical historian whether

23 nicotine is addictive? I think you do.

24 A. I think I've already mentioned that, you

1 know, I think —— you know, I follow the public health 3
2 community on this, and they have determined that

3 nicotine is addicting, and so I accept that.

4 Q. Medically what kind of chemical is

5 nicotine?

6 A. I believe it's an alkaloid.

7 Q. It's an alkaloid? And is it a stimulant or
8 depressant or both?

9 A. I think it's —— it's a stimulant. I suspect
10 that there is —— idiosyncratic reaction in that some
11 people may experience nicotine differently.
12 Q. I ——
13 MR. ROSENIHAL: Were you actually done with
14 your answer?
15 THE WITNESS: What I'm saying is I'm not
16 sure I can categorize it for all people who smoke,
17 but —— that's getting a bit far from my —— I mean, I
18 was an undergraduate chemistry major, but that's been
19 a long time ago.

22 you actually done with your answer.

24 where you were talking over each other.

1 MR. SURPRENANI: No, it's called stepping on
2 an answer, and we have mostly avoided that today. You
3 have witnesses that you say, I'll try not to step on

4 your answer and please don't answer my question before
5 I'm finished even if you know what I'm going to ask,

6 and they will do that all day long.

7 Can you put my next question before I say

8 it? Oh, yeah. Okay. After that repartee, where were
9 we?

10 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

11 Q. I was just wondering, I think I understand
12 that alcohol is both a stimulant and a depressant in
13 the sense that it stimulates you when you first begin
14 drinking, but, then, if you continue to drink or after
15 a period of time, it then turns into a depressant. Is
16 that incorrect?

17 A. Could be.

18 Q. Oh, okay. Do you have any understanding,
19 either as a medical historian or as a pediatrician,

20 how a addicted smoker typically satisfies his or her
21 addiction over the course of a day? In other words,

22 they wake up, they smoke cigarettes right away.
23 A. What I do know, as a medical historian, is

24 that's something that the public health community has

Page 234 

 

Page 234 
1 studied. And I'm thinking particularly in the case of 4

2 some of the studies in the 1970's beginning with

3 Ashton and then Michael Russell was the notion that,
4 during their waking hours anyway, a smoker sought out
5 a particular level of nicotine and then tried to

6 maintain that level through the course of the day.

7 Q. In other words, you'd smoke and attain it,

8 and then it would begin to drift down and you would

9 smoke —— is that the idea?
10 A. In a rough way. I'm not —— but basically
11 trying to maintain some sort of nicotine level.
12 Q. Okay. Let me now turn to your report. If

13 I could direct your attention to paragraph 5, you

14 state there:

15 I have extensively researched the history of
16 the development of scientific knowledge regarding the
17 relationship between smoking and serious disease and

18 the public health community's response to the evidence
19 linking smoking to fatal disease, such as lung cancer.
20 As part of that history I've specifically

21 examined the public health and scientific communities'
22 consideration of the reductions in tar and nicotine

23 yields as a possible means of reducing the risk of

24 cigarette smoking.

1 Now, I am correct that, although you have

2 extensively researched the topics you've described,

3 you have never published on this, on these topics,

4 correct?

5 A. That is correct.

6 Q. And all of this extensive research you have
7 done has been as an expert witness retained by the

8 tobacco —— by a tobacco company or companies, correct?
9 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
10 THE WITNESS: Much of it. I mean, the

11 tobacco and smoking is a big part of 20th century

12 medicine, and that's a course I teach. So parts of
13 this research is part of my general teaching, but
14 you're correct in saying that most of the detailed
15 research I've done has been as a medical history

16 consultant.

2 smoking.

3 Q. You have a class on smoking. And how do

4 you lecture, from notes or PowerPoint ——

5 A. I never use a PowerPoint. I lecture from
6 notes.

7 Q. I see. And you teach ee so how many 77 in
8 your class on 20th century medicine, how many —— how
9 many sessions do you have in a semester approximately?
10 A. How many times does the class meet?
11 Q. Yeah.
12 A. Twenty—eight times.
13 Q. And do they meet with you 28 times?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. So you teach that class 28 times.
16 A. Yeah. It's ——
17 Q. On 28 occasions?
18 A. Yeah, 14 weeks, two classes a week.
19 Q. And one of the 28 days —— is one of the 28

20 days devoted solely to smoking?

1 A. Well, we talk a little bit about the

2 development of the cigarette. That's important for

3 Duke University because our founder was —— made at

4 least part of his fortune dealing with the development
5 of cigarettes. Then we talk about the accumulation of

6 knowledge about smoking and health risks, talk about
7 the first Surgeon General's Report. I sometimes show
8 them a video clip from the Edward R. Murrow, "See It

9 Now," TV show in the 1950's.

10 Q. When he's smoking all the time?

11 A. He was smoking all the time. And I do that
12 partly because they haven't seen what television in

13 1950's was like and also because, you know, he tries
14 to seek out, you know, what the opinions were about

15 smoking and health in 1955. Do the Surgeon General's
16 Report, and then we talk about what happened after the
17 Surgeon General's Report. And so we talk about the

18 public health campaign. And usually then I sort of

19 ask them, can they tell me about the dangers of

20 cigarette smoking and list them on the board, and it
21 determines that they pretty much know what the public
22 health community wants them to know about the dangers
23 of cigarette smoking. And we talk a little bit about

24 the low—tar cigarettes. We talk about addiction. We

1 talk a number —— about a number of substances. I also
2 give some information about the number of Americans

3 who smoked and how those numbers have changed over

4 time.

5 Q. Do any of your students who list 77 do they
6 come up and list it on the board?

7 A. No.

8 Q. Oh, okay. I told you I went to my 25th law
9 school reunion. They have these cool chalkboards
10 where they are on rollers and so you can roll it up
11 real high and you have a chalkboard here and you have
12 one up there you can't reach, but then you reach and
13 pull it down, so you can have —— you double the amount

14 of chalkboard space. It's great.
15 Do you use chalkboard or white board?
16 A. Depends on the classroom I'm in. I prefer

17 slate boards.

18 Q. Black or green?

19 A. They are all black.

20 Q. Didn't they used to be green?

21 A. I suspect they were painted if they were
22 green.

23 Q. I grew up with green blackboards.

2 dangers of smoking identify themselves as smokers?

3 A. You know, I ask them sometimes to raise

4 their hands about that, and no students actually raise

5 their hands.

6 Q. Do you think you don't have any cigarette

7 smokers at Duke?

8 A. No, I don't think that at all.

9 Q. Why do you think they are not raising their

10 hands?
11 A. I think there are —— it's become such a
12 socially unfavored activity that I suspect a number of

13 my students don't want me to know that they smoke.

14 Q. Who was the founder of Duke who made his
15 fortune or some of it off tobacco?

16 A. James B. Duke. The university is actually
17 named after his grandfather, but he was one of the ——
18 one of the people who began using machines to roll

19 cigarettes.

20 Q. Was he associated with any particular

21 tobacco company?

2 health service, quote, technical report, closed quote,
3 in 1966 and was reaffirmed by the Surgeon General's

4 Report of 1981.

5 Now let me focus on "technical reports." Do
6 you know by measure —— the way You measure tar, I take
7 it, is by milligram per cigarette?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. Okay.
10 A. You mean in 1966.
11 Q. Yes.
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Is that how it's measured today?
14 A. Well, sometimes they can give ingredients

15 and things like that, but in 1966 it was done by

16 milligrams per cigarette.

17 Q. And nicotine is also measured by milligram
18 per cigarette?

19 A. Yes.

20 Q. Okay. And do you know in 1966 when the

21 technical report was issued what a low—yield cigarette
22 was —— what was considered to be a low—yield cigarette
23 as measured by milligrams of tar and of nicotine?

1 THE WITNESS: What the public health
2 community knew in 1966 was that there appeared to be a
3 dose—response relationship, which means that the less

4 tar, less disease. So they hadn't gotten to the point

5 where if that they used necessarily the term "lower

6 tar."

7 So what they were determining here in 1966
8 was that, based on the knowledge of a dose—response

9 curve, that any reduction would be better than, from a
10 disease point of View, than a cigarette that had a
11 higher —— so it's a long way around saying they hadn't
12 quite come up with a designation yet of, you know,
13 below a certain number was considered low. It was

14 that anything lower was better than anything higher.

15 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

16 Q. What tar levels would you get in the 1960's
17 from an unfiltered cigarette?

18 A. Well, you know, before the FTC Method, of
19 course, these were being measured by organizations

20 like "Reader's Digest" and "Consumer Reports," and I

21 think they had cigarettes that would get a tar, you

22 know, into the 40's milligrams, and then they had some
23 that were considerably lower than that as well. And
24 then nicotine is, you know, usually considered to be a

1 fixed, you know, component of tobacco, and so it would
2 be proportionately lower as well.

3 Q. I'm correct, am I not, that —— well, do you
4 know whether or not the tobacco used in a Marlboro

5 Light is exactly the same tobacco in a Marlboro Red?

6 A. I don't know that.

7 Q. Do you know what the differences are

8 between a Marlboro Light and a Marlboro Red?

9 A. You mean differences in the FTC rating of
10 them or do you mean differences in the actual
11 cigarette?
12 Q. Differences in the actual cigarette.
13 A. No.

1 the risk of lung cancer started with Public Health ﬂ

2 Services Technical Report, that consensus was a

3 consensus that, in your view, was shared by the public
4 health community.

5 A. Yes.

6 Q. I mean, it wasn't like a global, universal
7 consensus.

8 A. No. I'm talking about the public health

9 community, yes.
10 Q. Now, I have —— I've only asked you
11 questions about paragraphs 5 and paragraphs 8, but, as

12 we go through this report, one of the things that I'm
13 going to ask you is to call out any discussion that

14 the public health community was aware that the ——

15 aware of the role of nicotine addiction in causing

16 compensatory smokers to smoke in such a way as to keep
17 generally consistent levels of nicotine when they

18 switched from a higher to a lower—yield cigarette.

19 MR. ROSENIHAL: Hold on for a second. You

20 can ask questions. He can answer questions. I'm not

21 sure you can have a pending question hanging out

22 through the entire examination of the report in

23 addition to the specific questions you're asking

24 about.

2 that I will be asking that question as I now will.

3 MR. ROSENTHAL: Okay. That's a different

4 issue.

5 MR. SURPRENANI: Yeah. I was just providing
6 rules of the road, as it were.

7 THE WITNESS: Now, there is a section in the

8 report that deals with that. Did you want to just go
9 to that section and do that or ——

10 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

11 Q. Well, let me first ask my question I was

12 going to ask and then we'll do that. Okay.

13 I take it paragraph 9 —— in paragraphs 6
14 through 11 you set forth in summary and explained

15 below your conclusions, correct?

16 A. Yes.

17 O. Okay. Under the heading "Conclusions."
18 A. Yes.

19 Q. And nowhere in your conclusions do you

20 address in sum or substance that the public health
21 community was aware that a compensatory smoker would
22 smoke lower—tar cigarettes in such a fashion,

23 unconsciously or consciously, to derive comparable
24 levels of nicotine once they switched to lower tar and

1 nicotine cigarettes.

2 MR. ROSENTEAL: Objection.

3 THE WITNESS: Well, when we get to that

4 section, you'll see that, but, as I tried to, I guess,
5 maybe it was this morning or maybe it was early this
6 afternoon, is my view of compensation it inherently
7 has nicotine as a component. I mean, that's why

8 people change their smoking behavior and the public
9 health community —— I don't know of anyone who is
10 proposing that people change their smoking behavior
11 for any other reason than for nicotine.

12 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
13 Q. There is a —— there is a —— well, let me
14 see. You and I can agree that there was discussion

15 about and knowledge in the public health community

16 about compensation, correct?

17 A. With a certain —— yes, there is a lot of
18 discussion.

19 O. Okay. And there was discussion that a

20 compensatory smoker might obtain higher levels of tar

21 and nicotine than measured by the ETC METHOD because
22 of the manner in which they smoked, correct?
23 A. Yes. Certainly that's what —— the public

24 health community.

1 Q. And it is your testimony that inherent in

2 the concept of a compensatory smoker is the smoker is
3 compensating how he smokes because of the role of

4 nicotine addiction. Is that your testimony?

5 A. That's my understanding of what the is of

6 how the public health community viewed this issue, you

7 know, in the '70s and '80s.

8 Q. But I am adding a different and additional
9 component, is that, not only would smokers compensate
10 and not only would they compensate because of nicotine
11 addiction, but that compensation, as a general matter,
12 would reach, perhaps not exact, but comparable levels

13 of nicotine addiction so the smoker would get
14 comparable levels of nicotine and tar in the lowered

15 tar and nicotine cigarette as they did with the higher

16 one they switched from. That's what I'm looking for.

17 MR. ROSENTHAL: Is that a statement or a
18 question?
19 MR. SURPRENANT: That's a question.

20 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

21 Q. I'm looking for discussion, not merely of
22 compensation, that compensation is driven by nicotine
23 addiction and that the average smoker of a Light

24 cigarette will unconsciously compensate to derive

1 essentially compensatory levels of nicotine. ﬂ

2 A. Well, I would direct you to section 7 of my

3 report.

4 Q. Okay. And what page is that?

5 A. 18.

6 MR. ROSENTHAL: I'm still not sure what the
7 question is. To the extent there is a question, I

8 object to the form.

9 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

10 Q. Okay. I'm looking for that. We know what
11 I'm looking for, and so point out where that topic is
12 addressed in section 7.

13 A. Paragraph 48, for example, British

14 researchers conducted a study of 34 smokers finding
15 that, quote, under varying conditions smokers of

16 low—nicotine cigarettes had a higher puff frequency
17 and drew into their mouths nearly the same amount of
18 nicotine as smokers of high—nicotine cigarettes. The
19 researchers concluded that these findings are, quote,
20 are consistent with the possibility that there exists
21 an optimum nicotine dose for a given activity that

22 smokers unconsciously modify their smoking patterns to
23 obtain —— in an attempt to obtain this dose.

24 Q. Okay. Now, let's —— I'm glad you called

1 that out to my attention. That's footnote 55. That ﬂ

2 is the British Medical Journal, correct?
3 A. I believe, yes, that's where that article

4 appeared.

5 O. Okay. Now, this is a study of 34 smokers,
6 correct?

7 A. Yes.

8 O. Okay. Now, is this anecdotal or are you

9 saying that this report in 1970 in the British Medical
10 Journal was widely known and widely accepted in the

11 public health community?

12 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
13 THE WITNESS: I believe it's widely quoted.
14 I don't know how —— how broadly accepted it was.

15 Certainly when people do articles dealing with
16 nicotine research in the 1970's, it's often there as
17 an important initial study.

18 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

19 O. Okay. Does the word "addiction" appear

20 here?

21 A. I don't see the word "addiction" there, no.
22 Q. And didn't you tell me earlier that the

23 public health community did not conclude or reach

24 consensus on addiction until much later time than

1 1970?

2 A. Well, certainly the Surgeon General

3 concluded in 1988 that cigarette smoking was

4 addictive. There were alternative hypotheses going

5 forth that cigarette smoking was driven entirely by a
6 nicotine addiction. And that was Michael Russell. He
7 is quoted in the Surgeon General's Report as one of

8 the primary researchers. And certainly people, I

9 think, who were in the field of compensation studies

10 accepted the notion of people, at least in the 1970's

11 and 1980's, that people smoked to titrate the level to

12 a certain level, which is another way of —— I mean,
13 addiction is a term, which is in many ways not a

14 scientific term. It's a —— it's a term that has both
15 sort of common—sense meanings to it as well as more
16 scientific meanings to it. But 1 think most of the

17 compensation people thought that people smoke

18 cigarettes to get a certain level of nicotine, which
19 is —— which is a form of addiction. So, therefore, if
20 they were shown —— if they were smoking a cigarette

21 that had a lower level of nicotine in it, then they

22 would smoke that more intensively to get the higher

23 level of nicotine in their system.

1 Q. Do you know if the British researchers who ﬂ

2 conducted this study in 1970, do you know whether or

3 not they considered nicotine addictive?

4 A. I don't know whether they ever used that
5 term or not.

6 Q. Okay. And then let's go to paragraph 49.

7 This is Dr. Michael Russell 77
8 A. Uh—huh.
9 Q. —— speaking at the second World Conference

10 on Smoking and Health in 1971. And you guote him as

11 saying, I know of two recent studies in this country
12 that have shown cigarette smokers tend to modify their
13 puff rate to maintain a certain level of nicotine

14 intake. If you give them low—nicotine cigarettes,

15 they tend to puff harder to achieve the same intake of

16 nicotine and thereby possibly take in more tar.
17 Oh, and that you're citing to the
18 proceedings of the second World Conference on Smoking

19 and Health in London.

20 A. Yes.

21 Q. Now, with respect to either the report in
22 footnote 55 or the report in footnote 56, do you

23 recall how you came to be aware of that document?

24 A. I mean, I came across Ashton in my research.

1 British Medical Journal is easily obtainable, so I'm
2 sure I got it in Durham. World Conferences, you know,
3 that —— I have proceedings for a number of the world
4 conferences in my collection.

5 Q. Okay. Now, do you know if Dr. Russell at

6 the time he wrote that believed that nicotine was

7 addictive?

8 A. Well, he was certainly a leader in the ——

9 that nicotine titration theory of —— in fact on both

10 sides of the Atlantic. He was British, but his work

11 was well—known in the United States. So I think he,

12 you know, believed that smokers smoked to get a
13 constant level of nicotine in their blood. I can't
14 remember whether —— I think in some of his articles he

15 may well use the term "addiction" to it, but I think

16 throughout his work his view was that smokers smoked
17 to get a constant level of nicotine into their blood.
18 Q. Okay. Then let's read paragraph 50. The
19 Surgeon General in his 1972 report also considered the
20 hypothesis that smokers sought a constant level of

21 nicotine. An alternative point of view held by some
22 is that smoking behavior is a response to the need to
23 reach a certain nicotine level and that lowering the
24 amount of nicotine available from a cigarette may

Page 252 

1 result in an increase in the number of cigarettes

2 smoked, the depth of inhalation, or the number of

3 puffs in order to maintain an accustomed level. Such
4 an increase in smoking might result in an increased

5 inhalation of other hazardous substances in the smoke,

6 thereby potentially negating the effect of reducing

7 the amount available in each cigarette.
8 Now, do you know what the view was that this
9 view is an alternative to?
10 A. Yes. In that section of the Surgeon
11 General's Report, I believe the Surgeon General was
12 talking about whether a lower—tar cigarette would have
13 clear health benefits, and so the —— this asterisk
14 comment was the alternative view was that smokers
15 might compensate, and, therefore, not get the benefits

16 of low tar.

17 Q. And we know that in 1972 this was not the
18 consensus view because the Surgeon General calls out
19 that this alternative point of view was held by some,
20 correct?

21 A. Right.

22 Q. And was there a consensus in the

23 alternative point of view that some of these people
24 had, i.e., that there were clear health benefits from

1 smoking low—tar cigarettes?

2 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

3 THE WITNESS: I'm confused, but let me see
4 if T can answer.

5 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

6 Q. Let me withdraw the question. Strike it.
7 The consensus report in the 1972 is the
8 consensus View that the Surgeon General reported in

9 1972 is that there was clear health benefits from

10 lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes, correct?
11 A. I think the general View, and I think that's
12 in my conclusions there, of the public health
13 community is that they believe that low—tar cigarettes

14 had health benefits despite the fact that some smokers

15 could compensate. But this is an early phrase. They
16 had a few studies that were —— human studies —— at
17 this point in 1972 that were —— thinking particularly

18 of the Bross study, exciting studies that would

19 indicate that there was less risk in filtered
20 cigarettes.
21 The difference of moving to animal to human

22 studies, I think, was a big step for the public health
23 community, but they are saying right here, as I think

24 they said in the public health community and members

Page 254 
1 of it said back in the '50s was that, generally 4

2 speaking, it's a dose—response curve, so less
3 exposure, less disease, but only if smokers don't
4 compensate. They didn't use the word "compensate" in

5 the 1950's, they used other phrasing, but the fact is
6 that the public health community believed that low—tar

7 cigarettes had some health benefit. They made that

8 recommendation even though there was the concern about
9 compensation, which got increasingly more detailed
10 throughout their understanding as time went on.
11 Q. Okay. So the Surgeon General in 1972, he
12 did not yet consider cigarette smoking and nicotine
13 addictive, correct?
14 A. Well, you know, he didn't use —— he didn't
15 use that term, no, I don't believe. I'd have to see
16 in the whole report again, but —— but I don't want to

17 be caught up too much on what the public health
18 community viewed about the nature of cigarette
19 smoking. Because whether you're talking in 1950 or

20 1940, 1960, 1980's, cigarette smoking is hard to quit.

21 There is no question about it. Some people use the
22 term "addiction." Some people use different terms.
23 The Surgeon General did opine in the, you

24 know, in 1964, but what they said was it‘s hard to

Page 255 

1 quit, some people can't quit, and the substance

2 involved is nicotine. And, you know, that's sort of
3 what —— that's what our opinion is now. Sometimes we
4 actually use the term "addiction," but the point is

5 that cigarette smoking in 2010 is hard to quit, and

6 the public health community still thinks that the

7 substance within cigarette smoking that makes it hard
8 to quit is nicotine.
9 Q. Now, you're a pediatrician, correct? You
10 for a long time, many years, were a pediatrician.
11 A. I am.
12 Q. And you are now a retired pediatrician.
13 A. That is correct.
14 Q. Okay. I'm correct, am I not, that
15 teenagers, one of the reasons they occasionally engage
16 in irrational or immature behavior, is not only
17 they're relatively inexperienced, but that their
18 neurodevelopment isn't complete, correct?
19 A. That's certainly one of the ideas about

20 that. I think it's probably more complicated than

21 that, but that's one of the ideas, yes.

22 Q. Okay. And so teenagers and pre—teens, you
23 know, they often find cigarette smoking glamorous,
24 correct?

l A. You know, that gets into, you know, what —— ﬂ

2 smoking perception, and that gets out of my field of

3 expertise.

4 Q. Well, I can remember when I was eight years
5 old going down in the basement and getting a glass of
6 water and a pencil and pretending I was drinking

7 whiskey and smoking. Now es

8 A. And your point?

9 Q. Kids will find that behavior —— it's

10 predictable. We earlier said 1 in 5 high school

11 students smoke, right?

12 A. It may even be higher than that.

13 Q. Right. And they do that despite, you know,
14 the fact that advertising for cigarettes has been

15 restricted, correct?

16 A. Uh—huh.

17 Q. That the warning labels are on there.

18 A. Uh—huh.

19 Q. And Philip Morris —— you would expect that
20 Philip Morris —— strike that. You're also aware of
21 surveys that said children under six had a 96

22 recognition of Joe Camel, the same as Mickey Mouse?
23 A. I have seen those —— those studies, yes.
24 Q. Okay.

l A. It's interesting because my current students ﬂ

2 don't know who Joe Camel is. I asked them that

3 question.

4 Q. Right. Because the advertisement hasn't

5 run for a while.

6 A. Right.

7 Q. But Philip Morris has to understand that

8 immature middle school and high school students who

9 are underage are going to smoke and are going to get
10 addicted before they can make a mature decision about

11 smoking and they are going to be addicted and it's

12 going to be very hard for them to stop, correct?
13 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.

14 THE WITNESS: I don't know what Philip
15 Morris knows on that subject.

17 Q. Do you think it would be possible they

18 could not know those facts?

19 MR. ROSENTHAL: Same objection.

20 THE WITNESS: I just haven't studied it, so
21 I don't want to make a comment on that.

24 to manufacture and market cigarettes knowing that 1 in

1 5 or more underaged people who are unable to make ﬂ

4 of adulthood?

6 foundation.

7 THE WITNESS: I'm not a marketing expert. I
8 don't have any comments to say about that.

9 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
10 Q. And then paragraph 51, we turn to

11 Dr. Russell, a letter to the editor in the British

12 Medical Journal, and then a research Monograph 17 in
13 1977.

14 A. Uh—huh.

15 Q. Do you know how widely viewed —— first of
16 all, he doesn't mention nicotine addiction, correct?
17 A. Well ——

18 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, form.

19 THE WITNESS: We're quibbling a little bit
20 here because he doesn't use the word "addiction" in
21 this particular quote, but, again, he's talking about
22 compensating to maintain a level of nicotine in the
23 blood, which is one of the characteristics, I think,
24 that many people would consider as evidence of

Page 259 
1 addiction. But I don't want to quibble on terms, but ﬂ

2 I think it's —— you seem to be very fixed on the word
3 "addiction" maybe more than the scientific community
4 was in the 1970's. They were interested in explaining
5 what was driving the behavior of compensation, which,
6 as they —— I think these examples show their

7 understanding was that what was driving the

8 compensation was the quest of the smoker,

9 unconsciously, to maintain a level of nicotine in the
10 blood during waking hours, of course.

11 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
12 Q. Yeah. No, I am —— I am interested in
13 addiction and the role that plays in compensation.

14 I'm explicitly interested in it. And I didn't think I

15 was going to find an explicit statement and we haven't
16 so far. But I understand your point, Dr. English, is
17 you're saying, Surprenant, you're overly focused on

18 the word "addiction," it's more or less in here, and
19 you and I disagree, but that's fine. We can proceed.
20 Now, do you know how widely shared

21 Dr. Russell's views were as stated here in 1975 and

22 1977?

23 A. His view about nicotine were widely viewed,

24 known, in the public health community, and I think his

1 understanding of what drove compensation was commonly
2 held.

3 Q. Have you —— is that an anecdotal view or do
4 you have an expert view on that?

5 A. That's my opinion. That's an expert

6 opinion.

7 Q. But in 1972 the Surgeon General referred to
8 the substance of what Dr. Russell was stating as an

9 alternative view, correct, held by some?
10 A. Yeah.
11 Q. So I take it there was no consensus around

12 this point in the mid '70s in the public health

13 community.

14 MR. ROSENIHAL: Objection to form.

15 THE WITNESS: You know, we're getting into
16 the point, how public health consensus are made on a
17 given topic. Certainly over the course of the 1970's
18 I think this notion of compensating to maintain a

19 level of nicotine grew in its acceptance. I don't

20 know that I can actually give you a date when that

21 happened, but the public health community understood

22 that compensation could exist, and the only
23 explanation I've ever seen about compensation, what
24 drives compensation, is that of nicotine.

2 Q. Okay. Now, do you think it is pretty

3 likely that in each of the time periods that we've

4 covered so far —— 1950's, 1970, '71, '72, '75, '77 ——

5 it would be a trivial matter for me to obtain

6 something from the tobacco industry or the Tobacco

7 Institute condemning the statements we've been

8 discussing as being unsubstantiated?

9 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, form, foundation.
10 THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. First of all,

11 Russell didn't start publishing until the 1970's, and
12 so something earlier than that —— you can't condemn
13 something that hasn't happened yet.

14 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

15 Q. Well, I think we —— maybe my question was

16 imprecise. You start off talking in 1950 in paragraph

17 47.

18 A. But I thought, You know —— maybe I'm ——
19 okay. About compensation, well, again, 1 have not
20 studied what the tobacco companies' public

21 announcement, so 1 don't have an opinion on that.
22 Q. Yeah, but we know that in the Frank

23 Statement published in 1954, Philip Morris and the

24 other tobacco companies, assured the readers that

1 there was no consensus and no proof that smoking was

2 addictive or caused health issues, correct?

3 MR. ROSENIEAL: Objection to form.

4 THE WITNESS: I'm not —— we have to have ——

5 I haven't looked at the Frank Statement for a long

6 time, so I don't know. We would have to look at the
7 wording again of the Frank Statement.
8 MR. SURPRENANI: Okay. I'm going to go to
9 another exhibit, which I will make as we proceed in
10 open air.
11 MR. ROSENTHAL: 12.
12 MR. SURPRENANT: Exhibit 12.
13 (Exhibit No. 12 marked for identification

l4 and attached hereto.)

15 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

16 Q. What we're going to have, and I'll show the
17 videographer when it's complete, we have on the right
18 "public," and then we have to the left and up above
19 "public health community." And then below that we

20 have "Big Tobacco."

21 MR. ROSENIEAL: As opposed to small tobacco?
22 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

23 Q. And that is tobacco companies and their

24 agents, including Iobacco Institute. Now, one of the

1 things that you believe, Dr. English —— a

2 VIDEOGRAPHER: Do you want to show ——
3 MR. SURPRENANT: I'll show it to you when
4 I'm done because it may morph.

5 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
6 Q. One of the things that you have said is

7 that the public health community knew and understood

8 certain information about lowered tar and nicotine
9 cigarettes and made recommendations to the public,
10 correct?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Okay. Now, ultimately in this case what
13 we're concerned about isn't what the public health
14 community understood or knew. We're concerned with
15 what the public understood and knew, and, most
16 specifically, the class of Missouri smokers of

17 Marlboro Lights.
18 And so, as a matter of logic, if every time

19 the public health community said something about

20 smoking and then "Big Tobacco" including the Tobacco
21 Institute said, there is no proof, they are making it
22 up, it's unsubstantiated, there is no evidence for it,

23 that has a likelihood of frustrating what the public

24 health community is telling the public, doesn't it,

1 just as a matter of logic?

2 MR. ROSENTHAL: First of all, I object to

3 the paragraph—long preface, which I'm not even sure

4 was a question, but I also object to the form and

5 foundation of the question.

6 THE WITNESS: Well, part of your question

7 had to do with public health community recommendations

8 about low—tar cigarettes to the public. I don't think

9 I've ever seen a tobacco company, a Tobacco Institute
10 document, in any form —— I mean, I know I haven't done
11 a systematic search —— shown that would countermand
12 that particular message that low—tar cigarette —— that

13 the public, if they are going to smoke, should smoke

14 low tar. Maybe they have; I just haven't seen one.
15 And, again, how the public achieves —— how
16 they process the information, it's not something that
17 I have an expert opinion about.

18 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

19 Q. Okay. Now, if in 1988 the Tobacco
20 Institute is, even on that late date saying, it's an
21 open question, we don't know if cigarettes are
22 addictive, we don't know if cigarettes cause health

23 issues, we don't know if they kill people, they are

24 necessarily saying that about Light cigarettes,

1 correct?
2 MR. ROSENIEAL: Object to form.
3 THE WITNESS: Again, I haven't seen that

4 statement. We would have to look at it together. I

5 don't if you know, I certainly haven't seen any

6 statement about —— like that, but, you know, if you

7 have a statement you want to show me, we can look at

8 it. But I certainly haven't seen any, you know, any

9 representation in any of these cases where there was
10 any attempt to undermine the public health community's
11 message about low—tar cigarettes.

12 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

13 Q. But, as a matter of logic, if the public

14 health community is telling smokers, if you switch

15 from higher tar and nicotine cigarettes to lower tar
16 and nicotine cigarettes —— strike that.

17 According to your testimony, Dr. English,
18 there was a three—tier platform of advice given by the

19 public health community to the public about smoking

20 from 1955 through 2001. That was, don't smoke, if you

21 smoke stop, but if you can't stop, switch to a low—tar
22 —— a lowered tar and nicotine cigarette, correct?

23 A. I wouldn't put '55. I think I said '66,

24 but ——

Page 266 

 

Page 266 

1 Q. Okay. Now, if the tobacco companies and

2 the Tobacco Institute are denying the basic premise

3 that cigarette smoking causes health concerns, they

4 are obviously denying that you need to go to a lower

5 tar and filtered cigarette if a lower tar and nicotine
6 cigarette —— because there are no health problems even
7 if you're smoking Marlboro Reds.

8 MR. ROSENTHAL: Object to form.

9 THE WITNESS: I haven't studied what they

10 said. I certainly don't know the intent behind any

11 statement and we don't have a statement in front of us
12 to look at. And, again, how the public processes
13 messages is something that's outside of my expertise.

14 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
15 Q. Okay. Now, the Surgeon General, how do you

16 say his name, the guy with the Amish beard?

17 A. Koop?

18 Q. Koop. What president was he the Surgeon
19 General for?

20 A. Reagan.

21 Q. And in the late '80s he issued a report

22 saying that cigarette smoking killed over 400,000
23 people a year. And T was in Washington on a case as a

24 young associate and the spokeswoman for the American

Page 267 

1 Tobacco Institute came on, and in a very indignant

2 tone asked what the Surgeon General thought he was

3 doing issuing that report, he had no business issuing
4 such a report.

5 Assuming my memory is correct, was that in
6 any way a responsible statement for the American

7 Tobacco Institute to question Surgeon General Koop

8 even him having the termidity to address the fact that

9 cigarette smoking was killing people?
10 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
11 THE WITNESS: I would have to look at that

12 with you again and see what they actually said.

13 Without looking at that or —— I guess it was a
14 video —— I wouldn't be able to tell you, make a
15 comment.

16 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

17 Q. Okay. Now, I take it that because you're a
18 medical historian, if you thought it was a worthwhile
19 task, you could reach a expert opinion as to what the
20 message was of the tobacco industry, and, in

21 particular, the Tobacco Institute to the American

22 public about health risks associated with smoking.

23 That's an analysis you could do, correct?

24 A. It depends. I'm not an expert on various

1 public relation campaigns. If it dealt with ﬂ

2 scientific facts and studies, I might be able to have
3 a comment there, but it's certainly not something that
4 I have done.

5 Q. Right. But if what we wanted to know is

6 what the public understood or believed about the risk

7 of health smoking 77 the risk if the health risks of
8 smoking cigarettes, certainly conceptually one of the
9 things we would want to understand is the efforts that
10 the tobacco industry, including the Tobacco Institute,
11 undertook to persuade the public that there were no
12 proven health risks, correct?
13 MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
14 THE WITNESS: I mean, someone who studies
15 how the public processes information would probably
16 look at a whole variety of different inputs of

17 information that might include that, but it's

18 certainly not something that I have expertise in.

19 BY MR. SURPRENANT:

20 Q. Okay.

21 MR. SURPRENANI: Mr. Rosenthal, it is now
22 4:35. We began at 9:01. I am not going to finish
23 today, but I will finish by noon tomorrow. So it is

24 up to you and to, most of all, you, Dr. English, when

1 you want to quit. a

2 I have a conference call I have to prepare

3 for, but I'm willing to go further and get you out

4 slightly earlier tomorrow, but how long do you want to
5 proceed?

6 MR. ROSENTEAL: It's entirely up to you.

7 THE WITNESS: It's up to you. I mean, you
8 have to run and catch a flight at noon tomorrow?

9 MR. SURPRENANT: Well, I'm going to change.

10 It's just I know that ——

11 THE WITNESS: Are we off the record?

12 MR. SURPRENANT: No, we're on the record.
13 Knowing what I have left to examine you on and what

14 evil genius I will work out of my hotel room tonight
15 is I can commit to you I will finish by noon tomorrow,
16 and one of the reasons I'm going to do that is just

17 efficiency and it will allow me to get home earlier.

18 But we can go to 5:00. I don't want to go past 5:00.

19 We can stop now. It's up to you, Dr. English.

20 THE WITNESS: Why don't we stop now.
21 MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. Fair enough. Thank
22 you for your patience today and it's been an

23 educational day.
