1950's was a period that gave birth to a new science and included investigations of causes of chronic disease using new tools
which included both prospective studies, retrospective studies, it was really a much broader field than that. Part of the clinical
epidemiology had to do with new designs of therapeutic trials. If you're testing a drug for high blood pressure, how do you
create the proper experimental conditions to test a drug in human populations. So clinical epidemiology I might add as an aside
is a very broad field.

"2000","2000-08-23","English, Peter","le_rhlj0015.pdf","Q","Q. Certainly but for recent concerns about the ethics of subjecting animals to these tests, it has been for many years practiced to subject animals to testing of carcinogenic materials in order to draw inferences as to whether those materials are carcinogenic in man.
"
"2000","2000-08-23","English, Peter","le_rhlj0015.pdf","A","A. Cholanthrene iB a more complicated issue, and complicated only because I think it's largely spurious. Beginning in 1955, there were a number of polycyclic hydrocarbons that were discovered in tobacco tar that when tested on the backs of mice produced Borne of these warts and papillomas that we were talking to later.
The issue here, and this is pertinent to the scope both of ben2pyrene, cholanthrene and methylcholanthrene, is tobacco tar is a mixture of a great many chemicals. In the 1950s, it was thought to be somewhere around 700 different chemicals in tobacco tar. He now know, I don't know, four or five thousand.
I've done a little work in trying to separate out a particular chemical within the mass of plant tar. It's particularly difficult because of the very minute quantities known. In the traditional way a chemist determines whether something is present in the material at hand is to isolate that material in pure form and then to perform various chemical tests on it.
That's very difficult in small quantities when you're dealing with a mixture as large as tobacco tar, so there was a real debate among organic chemists in the late 1950s and 1960s and later of how do you know that a given chemical is actually in this mass of tar, especially since it was -- except for a couple of cases, I think 3,4-benzpyrene may have been the only one, it was impossible to actually isolate it in enough quantity to perform the traditional tests chemists do to know.
So they used a series of indirect methods. They used chromatographies, spectroscopy, a number o£ UV light, and at issue here was a consensus in the late 1950s that you needed to have more than one of these indirect methods before you could actually say that there was a likelihood that a chemical was present.
The criteria of that, by the way, are set up by Johnstone and Plimmer, and actually the Surgeon general's report in 1964 recognized the issue. They stated it as necessary to have two or more criteria, and the Wynder and Hoffmann in their book ""Tobacco and Tobacco Smoke"" in 1967 reiterated the fact that you needed two or more,
t
Cholanthrene was a chemical that Rodgman in his 1959 report mentioned as one of the ones that he had found that had not reported. Cholanthrene was in
a known carcinogen, not from tobacco smoke, but from other substances, and there was a small literature on cholanthrene, 1 think about a half a dozen papers extending back to the 1930s where people had rodent skin of varying success of producing tumors with cholanthrene.
I asked to see more detail on what Rodgman -- because this 1959 memo that plaintiffs have
is really not a scientific document. It's really a report to I guess a group. I'm not really sure on who the audience actually was for that, but in his paper where he mentioned that, he details what his lab waB doing and also says what the -- what his criteria were for me. So I think he detailed that there were 40, 41 different chemicals that he thought he had found, but only 14 met the criteria of two or more indirect tests, and cholanthrene was in the group that he had only found by ultraviral testing, which in subsequent reports remained in that category.
Now, the issue is, you know, is cholanthrene even in tobacco, In looking at recent -- I'm thinking of Hoffmann and Hoffmann's article in the '90s where they list carcinogens in tobacco smoke as in the mid-'90s, cholanthrene and methylcholanthrene aren't in 1 the list. IR publication in 1986, it's not there. I mean, what I assume is that he thought he saw itf he only had like nine-hundredths of a milligram I think what he Bald, it wasn't enough to perform any teetB.
He probably did think it was there, but he was probably wrong.
"
"2000","2000-10-25","Ford, Lacy","wl_35717504.pdf","A","A. Well, my understanding of it obviously is a lay or nonexpert understanding of the overall case. It's been described to me
as a medical monitoring case, where the plaintiffs are asking for medical monitoring for testing and certain procedures to be
conducted in an attempt to ascertain diseases that are attributed by the medical community to smoking.

"2001","2001-06-21","Ludmerer, Kenneth","le_rlkp0018.pdf","A","A. Right. It was discouraging because a lot of treatments that were thought to be valid were shown not to be valid by this type of testing.

"2009","2009-03-31","Hoff, Joan","wl_5061522.pdf","Q","Q. Yeah. In lawsuits, under certain circumstances, the parties have the opportunity to challenge the testimony and the
admissibility of the testimony of the other side's expert. So in federal court that's known as a Daubert, D-A-U-B-E-R-T; state
court sometimes it's known as the Frye challenge.
But has anyone ever challenged your methodologies at testing or your methodologies at research?

"2009","2009-03-31","Hoff, Joan","wl_5061522.pdf","Q","Q. Okay, I understand that. I guess the terms were a bit broad.
But you would agree that oftentimes when a publication or an article would come out, a journal would come out discussing the
health hazards of smoking or the addictive nature of smoking, sometimes a day later or two days later or sometimes that same
day, maybe an article -- maybe in a paragraph in the same article or in an article in a different section of the paper, there would
be some mention of the fact that there is this company, it's the manufacturer of the product, who maintains that the literature
is inconclusive, additional testing needs to be done, there's no link between health hazards and smoking cigarettes, there's no
link between addictiveness -- addiction and cigarettes.
Would you agree with that?

point I'd like you to focus on.

that testing -- I'm sorry, that testing has been performed and that there may be a link between smoking and lung cancer, smoking
and certain illnesses, but that link is inconclusive and that additional testing may be done or the testing timing performed may
be inadequate, right?

Q. Okay. It's generally correct that -- it's hard for me to play with the semantics of the sentence, but it's generally correct that
the public, while they may have been made aware of some studies that documented the relationship between certain health
risks and smoking, they were also presented with responses which said that those relationships may, in fact, not be true or that
additional testing is necessary; is that correct?

"2010","2010-04-29","English, Peter","le_fpkl0190.pdf","Q","Q. Is that one of the ways that Philip Morris, in concert with the other tobacco companies, misled the FTC about whether its testing method was appropriate or not or useful or not was they knew, based on internal data and studies, that because nicotine addiction most smokers would smoke the cigarette in such a way, consciously or unconsciously, to obtain relatively stable levels of nicotine when they switched from a higher tar and nicotine cigarette to a lower tar and nicotine cigarette.

As a logical matter, as a logical matter, unless you have determined in a systematic way sufficient to form expert opinions about what Philip Morris knew about compensation and when it knew it, you could not arrive at an opinion as to whether Philip Morris manipulated the FTC on the issue of compensation and the FTC testing method, correct? You would be missing a vital input.
"
"2010","2010-04-29","English, Peter","le_fpkl0190.pdf","Q","Q. And you haven't -- you haven't done a systematic analysis of the communications between the tobacco companies and the FTC on compensation and the FTC testing method and maintaining its use, correct?
"
"2010","2010-04-29","English, Peter","le_fpkl0190.pdf","Q","Q. Okay. Now, so — now let me go back. Let me go back. Did you know there was an allegation in this case that the internal documents from Philip Morris and the other tobacco companies indicated they knew important information about compensation and addiction that they did not reveal to the FTC in such a way that the FTC was misled into the adoption and maintaining the use of the FTC testing method? You're aware that that is a contention that is made in this case, correct?
"
"2010","2010-04-29","English, Peter","le_fpkl0190.pdf","Q","Q. Okay. Let me follow that up and try to flesh it out a little bit. I was a smoker off and on in the late '70s until April 1st, 1988. I smoked a low-tar cigarette, Merits. I understood that it had health benefits over non-Light cigarettes. And prior to getting on this case a few months ago I would have said that I thought it was common knowledge that Light cigarettes were not as dangerous as full-flavored cigarettes. And I would have never heard of Monograph 13 or the FTC testing method or compensation. And I take it that illustrates that there is a big difference with respect to the public of what information is, quote/unquote, available and
what any individual member of the public actually knows about it, correct?
"
"2010","2010-04-30","English, Peter","le_lpkl0190.pdf","Q","Q. So let's just kind of stay there. If the public health community knew in the 1970's, '80s and '90s, that Philip Morris and other tobacco industry -other tobacco companies -- were advocating the continued use of the FTC testing method because they knew it misled smokers into thinking lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes were better for them when they weren't, that is something that would have been new and different and that the public health community did not know, correct?
"
"2010","2010-04-30","English, Peter","le_lpkl0190.pdf","Q","Q. I know, Dr. English, that you are having trouble answering hypothetical questions. I understand that. You may have trouble answering this one. But do you think in the 1990's if Philip Morris told the FTC, FTC, we have scientists, we have marketing people, we do surveys, we've done a lot of work on compensation and addiction and public
perception, and we want you to continue the FTC testing method because it's favorable to our business in the following way: It misleads Marlboro Light smokers into thinking that ""lowered tar & nicotine"" on the Marlboro Light box means better for them than Marlboro Reds and we know that's false. Don't you think the FTC would have said, hmm, let's look into that?
"
"2010","2010-04-30","English, Peter","le_lpkl0190.pdf","A","A. : I don't know what the FTC would have done. They knew about what some of the limitations were of their testing method. They knew that from even before they started it. They reiterated in the '70s, '80s and '90s their understanding that, you know, that -- about the FTC Method, the limitations of that method. They kept it because they thought that it was of benefit to smokers to know of comparable values. They knew that compensation would permit some smokers of low-tar cigarettes to get a higher amount, but, I mean, I don't know what they would have done with a representation by Philip Morris of that -- the way you describe.

to the best of your knowledge, was that more testing needed to be done. The statistical association was not enough, and there
needed to be further causative testing done; is that correct?

The articles that I'm recalling at the moment tended to focus more on what the numbers were, because no — there was no standard uniform testing at that time, and so some of these articles offered figures that had been arrived at by independent testing.

"2012","2012-10-21","English, Peter","le_xxhl0190.pdf","Q","Q. If a consumer in 1971, '72, was told cigarettes -- these cigarettes are lower in tar than some other brand of cigarettes, and didn't say lower by the FTC method, lower by the smoking machine, lower by some analytical testing only, would you agree with me, that consumer would have assumed that that phrase, lower in tar, meant lower than what he was actually inhaling than if he had smoked some other cigarette?
"
"2012","2012-10-21","English, Peter","le_xxhl0190.pdf","A","A. They were developed in the 1970s as a way of, I guess, screening, I guess would be the way to put that -- let me back up. Carcinogenicity in the 1970s, let's say when the Tobacco Working Group was working or Wynder before that, involved painting tars on the backs of mice week after week, month after month, year after month. That was the gold standard for animal testing, but it took a look period of time. Mutagenicity tests were developed, and a quite a few of them, in the 1970s as a way to shortcut or screen potential substances that might
be carcinogens, so that it could happen -- so you wouldn't have to wait months and months and years and years. Mutagenicity is not the same as carcinogenicity and I am not sure you can relate scores, but it was sort of a screening test.

What I was saying was, the public health community in the nineteen — late 1960s or after the Surgeon General's Report and the industry, itself, were hypothesizing, essentially, that perhaps filters would have a protective effect, and lights and low tars. The whole FTC method of testing cigarettes grows out of that.
But, of course, the whole point is the industry had knowledge of how smokers actually smoked, indicating that they didn't actually offer a real benefit in real humans.
