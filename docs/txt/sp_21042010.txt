Hoffman is fine.
Q.
15
Great.
Thank you.
If you have any problems hearing me, this is a

19 question before you started answering, and I could do
20 the same for you.
21 or we start talking over each other, let's just try to
22 be patient and allow each other to finish talking.
23 a little bit hard to do because you can't see each

www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 including yourself, has anybody in that family ever
2 smoked cigarettes?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. Start at the top and tell me who, please.
5 A. My oldest sister smoked cigarettes, and my

7 other sisters started smoking cigarettes fairly
8 recently.
And then one of my
9 Q. What is her age?
10 A. The sister who just started smoking?
11 Q. Yes, ma'am.

20 Q. Tell me over what time period.
21 A. I'm not entirely certain.
22 late, I think.
23 actually, I'm not sure.
She started fairly
I believe in her -- well, just,
24 Q. Do your best for me and ballpark it.
25 A. I would guess maybe when she was 20, and she
7
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
stopped about six years ago.
2 Q. So she smoked for approximately 30 years?
3 A. I don't know.
4 Let's see.
5 age 49.
I'd have to do the math on that.
She smoked from -- guessing, from age 20 to
Yeah, 29 years.
You're right.
6 Q. Okay.
7 A. No, I do not.
8 Q. Where does she live?
9 A. She lives in Little Rock, Arkansas.
10 Q. How old were you when she was 20?
11 A. I would have been 16.
12 Q. Did you live in the same household when she
13
Do you live near her?
started smoking around the age of 20?
14 A. No.
15 Q. She had left the home?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. All right.
You said you have a youngest sister
18 who also has been a smoker or is a smoker.
19 about her.
20 A. That's my sister Sally.
21 Q. And how many years your junior is she?
22 A. She is five years my junior.
23 Q. Okay.
24
25
Tell me
If we ballpark it, say 48 years old?
Sound about right?
A.
That sounds about right.
8
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Q. And when did she start smoking?
2 A. I'm not sure.
3
Again, I could ballpark it around
16 or 17 years of age probably.
4 Q. Does she still smoke?
5 A. Yes, she does.
6 Q. Where does she live?
7 A. She lives in Jamul, California.
8 Q. You have to help me with that one.
9
big towns but not the little ones.
10
11
12
I know the
Is that close to you?
A.
It's close to me.
Spelled with a J, by the way.
It's a Spanish name.
13 Q. And do you see her from time to time?
14 A. I do.
15 Q. Does she live close enough to you that you get
16
to see her, say, once a month?
17 A. Roughly speaking, yes.
18 Q. Do you know what kind of cigarettes she smokes?
19 A. No, I don't.
20 Q. Do you know whether or not she's been a
21
continuous smoker from age 16 or 17 to present?
22 A. I believe she has quit on occasions.
23 Q. Have you ever discussed that with her?
24 A. Yes, I have.
25 Q. And what would be your best guess as to how many
9
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 times she has tried to quit in her 30-year smoking
2 career?
3 A. I really could not guess that number.
4 Q. So let's see if I can do some quick math in my
5 head here.
6 years ago, that would be about 1980?
7 about right, when she started?
If she's 48 and started smoking 30 -- 30
Does that sound
8 A. I suppose so.
9 Q. And your other sister smoked or started at 20.
2010 minus 30 would be 1980.
10 She's 57.
11 about the same time as your other sister, about 1980.
12
So that would be about 30 years.
She started
Does that sound about right?
13 A. Yeah, she might have.
14 Q. In your household growing up, were either your
15
mother or father smokers?
16 A. No, they were not.
17 Q. Did your father ever smoke a cigar or a pipe?
18 A. No, he did not, that I am aware of.
19 Q. I would presume your mother never smoked a cigar
20
or pipe.
21 A. No.
22 Q. She's not a smoker of any kind?
23 A. No.
24 Q. And the other children that were in your family,
25
She never has been.
I think we've talked about three sisters, all of whom
10
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 smoked, plus you would be four.
2 That leaves three out.
3
4
There's seven kids.
What about the other three?
Were they ever
smokers?
5 A. Not that I'm aware of.
6 Q. Did you ever have an opportunity back around the
7 time your two sisters started smoking in 1980 to discuss
8 why it was they started smoking?
9 A. No, we did not.
10 Q. Considering the fact now you've been involved as
11 a paid witness in cigarette litigation for approximately
12 ten years, during that period of time, have you ever
13 gone back in any discussions with your sisters and asked
14 them why it was they started smoking in 1980?
15 MR. KOETHE:
16 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I've never discussed with them why
17 they started smoking, or at least not with -- not with
18 my oldest or my youngest sisters.
19 BY MR. WARRINER:
20
21
Q.
What about with the middle one that started more
recently?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Tell me about that discussion.
24
25
Let's see.
She
started smoking approximately two years ago?
A.
Yes.
11
(212) 279-9424

fair?
3 A. That's correct.
4 Q. All right.
5
6
Is that
Tell me about that conversation you
had with your adult sister who started smoking in 2008.
A.
I -- I don't recall the conversation verbatim,
7 by any means.
8 had started smoking, and I can't recall how I knew that.
9 Perhaps my mother mentioned it to me.
10
Q.
I just -- you know, I was aware that she
Same question.
I never asked about her.
I
11 asked you about the oldest sister and the youngest
12 sister.
13
14
But the middle sister, does she live close to
you?
15 A. Yes, she does.
16 Q. Do you have an opportunity to see her fairly

frequently, say, at least once a month?
18 A.
19 the phone.
20 Q.
Yes.
If we don't see each other, we speak on
Of the three sisters who have been cigarette
21 smokers, do any of them know that you have participated
22 as a paid witness for the cigarette companies in
23 lawsuits?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. How many of them know that?
12
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. All of them.
2 Q. And how would that come up?
3
How would you share
that role with them?
4
A.
Oh, I guess just in the casual way one talks
5 about what's new in your life, I would have told them
6 about it.
7
Q.
And I'm a little unclear as to when your first
8 experience would have been as a witness for a cigarette
9 manufacturer.
10
Was there anything previous to that?
11
12
I know about the Boeken case.
A.
I was not involved in testifying before that
case.
13
Q.
Okay.
And that's approximately ten years ago,
14 again ballparking.
15 make it exact, but that's not really that important to
16 me.
17
18
We could get transcripts out and
Is ten years a fair estimate?
A.
I think the Boeken case was more recent than
19 that.
20 but I'm not sure.
21 the transcripts to be certain.
22
Q.
I believe it might have been as recent as 2003,
Again, I would also have to get out
I'm looking at -- I was looking at Mr. Piuze's
23 opening statement in that case this morning, just to get
24 a ballpark, and I believe it was in 2001.
25
A.
Okay.
13
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Q. 2 years. 3 A. That's correct.
4 Q. And when would it have come up with your
So you've been involved for, say, nine or ten
Fair enough?
5 sisters, the fact that you had done something new in
6 your life and you were participating as a paid witness
7 in cigarette litigation?
8
9
10
11
12
A.
Again, I'm just guessing it would have been near
the beginning of my doing that work.
Q.
And what did your smoking sisters say about
that?
A.
Well, they said that they certainly knew about
13 the hazards of smoking before they started, so they
14 assumed other people would too.
15
16
Q.
Did you talk to them about that?
Did you just simply ask them the question?
You
17 know, I'm involved as a witness, and I've got to give
18 testimony about this.
19 after Surgeon General's warnings went on packs of
20 cigarettes and Surgeon General's Reports were out.
21 in the world would make you start smoking cigarettes
22 after all that information was out there and available?
23 Did you ever ask that question of them?

Thank you.
Given your role and your testimony in these
16 cases, is it your testimony today that you did not

Why did I not ask them that

14 Cal.
15
MR. WARRINER:
I'd have to make it twice as
16 long, but I can fix that.
17 BY MR. WARRINER:
18
Q.
I mean, why did you not ask them why they
19 started smoking in 1980 in light of the fact that they
20 say they had full knowledge as to the risks of smoking
21 cigarettes?
22
A.
Well, as I indicated, I think that they have
23 both, at different points in their life, have said to me
24 that it was a stupid thing to do and, you know,
25 that's -- and they were just being teenagers or, you

know, they were being willful, and so they started.
Q.
So you didn't have to ask the question.
They
3 had offered up to you the fact that they were being
4 teenagers.
5 started smoking in light of their knowledge of the risk?
And that was their explanation for why they

14 time they started?

Have you urged both of them that continue to
smoke today to quit?
24 A. Yes.

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 simply put cigarettes down if they know they're

3 A.
Yes.
4 Q.
What do they say?
5 A.
Again, they say they want to.
6 Q.
They want to quit?
7 A.
No.
They want --
They -- well, they want both things. They
8 want to quit, and -- but they also want to smoke. They
9 like to smoke.
10
Q.
Do you think that both of them know that if they
11 continue to smoke cigarettes, they could develop lung
12 cancer and die from smoking?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. And they continue to spoke despite the fact they
15 know that.
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. What do they say?
18 A. Okay.
Have you ever asked them why?
I think you had two questions there.
19 I've asked them why they continue to smoke.
20 that --
Right?

21 Q. Yes.
22 A. Separate them out for me, please.
23 Q. Good.

11 regarding her attempts to quit, have you asked her
12 whether or not she has knowledge of the dangers of

15 was in the context generally of, you know, discussing

16 And I'm aware that she occasionally smokes.
17
Q.
18
She actually lives in Washington, D.C.
Okay.
Never mind.
Going back to your current employment, it looks
19 like, if I add up the years, that you have been at San
20 Diego State from the time that you were first approached
21 to potentially give paid witness testimony in tobacco
22 litigation.
23

Yes.

22 involved?

responsibilities are at San Diego State.
11 A. I teach two classes per semester.
12 Q. And what are those classes?
13 A. They vary, of course, from semester to semester.
14 Currently, I am teaching a class that is about American
15 foreign relations from -- approximately during -- across
16 the course of the 20th century.

23

the summertimes.
Q.
And what responsibilities would you have in the
department when you are not teaching?
A.
They could be any number of responsibilities.
8 For example, master's degree students are usually still
9 writing their theses over the summer, over the other
10 breaks during the year, so I could easily be editing or
11 consulting with them on their work.

17
Q.
Other than in a cigarette case, have you ever
been called as an expert witness in any other court?
A.
No, I have not been called as an expert witness
in any other subject, to date.
Q.
I want to distinguish subject from the type of
case, because it could be a little bit confusing.
18
Have you ever been an expert witness, whether
19 you testified or not, in any type of case other than a
20 smoking case?

10 any of your classes where you keep notes or you have a
11 handout or you have audio/visuals that you use during
12 that particular topic or lecture?
13
A.
I don't think so.
I -- this is such common
14 knowledge, it would have been in reference to something
15 where it was easy to talk about it extemporaneously.
16
Q.
So the subject might have come up, but the
17 purpose of the entire lecture was not to lecture the
18 class on smoking and health issues?

You know, I just can't think of an example at
the moment.
Q.
I don't recall one.
As I look at your CV and as I look at your Web
5 site and as I look at the San Diego State Web site, I am
6 struck by the lack of any publication, learning, study
7 in the area of smoking and health that preceded your
8 involvement in cigarette testifying.

Did you ever have, as any part of your academic
study, the issue specifically of smoking and health?
11 MR. SUAREZ:

Form.
Well, again, it was not my focus,
13 but it's the kind of information that would come up in a
14 general understanding of American history going back to
15 the, you know, beginnings of the country.
16 many -- you know, they are many kinds of projects where
17 you begin it at a certain moment in time, and before
18 that moment in time, you hadn't been working on it so
19 that, for example, when I did research on Brazil,
20 although I traveled to and lived in Brazil, before I did

That's sort of an answer to my question, with
all due respect.
Would I be correct in assuming, from that

A.
No.
I never published anything specifically on
smoking and health before this time.
All right. Go back to the year 2000, which you
18 gave me that year. And I'll give you an opportunity to
19 tell me, you know, specifically how did this project
20 start and when?
21
Q.
A.
I think it started at the end of 1999, so -- as
22 best as I recall, and I began by doing research in the
23 Library of Congress and at San Diego State University.
24
25
Q.
So one day you woke up, and you said, I'm
interested in tobacco today; I'm going to the Library of

Congress to do research?
2 A. No.
3 Q. Or did it happen different than that?
4 A. It happened differently from that.
5 Q. How did it happen?
6 A. Well, this was a period of time when I first
7 started at San Diego State University, and I was
8 simultaneously approached about several projects right
9 there at the beginning of my career at San Diego State.
10 And one of those was the project to research the state
11 of public awareness of the harms of smoking.

24 Q. Who approached you to write those?
25 A. I was approached by Houghton Mifflin to write

Q.
And I was approached by
Did any of them have anything to do with
cigarettes or tobacco or smoking issues?
A.
No, not -- not as a focus.
That's the kind of
6 information that can come up and does come up when you
7 study history in a general sense.
8 much broader, of course, because it was world history.
9
Q.
Right.
But the focus, it was
And the people that were asking you to
10 write those -- that was probably an inartful question.
11 The people that were asking you to begin those
12 projects, did they have anything to do with tobacco
13 companies?
14 A.
Not that I'm aware of.
15 Q.
Okay.
So those were academic exercises, the
16 result of which would be textbooks that possibly could
17 be used in a teaching setting?
18 A. Yes, that's correct.
19 Q. And then you said you were approached to do this
20 public awareness research as well.
21 Mifflin approach you to do that?
22
23
A.
I'm sorry.
Did Houghton and
Could you say that -- did Houghton
Mifflin ask me to do research on smoking?
24 Q. Yes. They publish textbooks.
25 A. Yes. But, no, that wasn't what they asked me to

Q.
Okay.
They weren't involved in asking you to do
cigarette research, were they?
4 A. No, they were not.
5 Q. And what about the colleague that you said
6 approached you to write one of the textbooks?
7 cigarette project also his or her project as well, or
8 was it somebody else that had the cigarette project?
9
10
A.
Was the
There was a third person who asked me about the
cigarette project.
11 Q. And who was that?
12 A. That was Michael Schaller from the University of
13
Arizona.
14 Q. Can you spell "Schaller" for me, please.
15 A. Certainly.
16
17
18
It's C -- S-C-H-A-L-L-E-R.
I think
I have that right.
Q.
I can't imagine I guessed that right, but I
wrote it that way.
19 A. Very good.
20 Q. And he's at the University of Arizona?
21 A. Yes, that's correct.
22 Q. How did you know him?
23 A. I knew him through professional historical

associations.
Q.
Like what?

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

(212) 490-34301
A.
Well, I think we met once at the American
2 Historical Association at a meeting, I believe, in
3 Chicago.
4
Q.
Okay.
And why, to the best of your
5 understanding, was it that a historian in Arizona was
6 calling you in San Diego to do smoking and cigarette
7 research?
8
9
A.
He said that he was, you know, looking around to
see if there were historians in California who would be
10 interested in doing this kind of research, because he
11 had been engaged in it.
12 Q.
13 companies?
14 A.
He was already working for the tobacco

Form.
He was working for an attorney at
And that attorney, did that attorney represent
cigarette companies?
21 A. Yes, he did.
22 Q. And I want you to tell me, as best you can
23 recall, the substance of that first contact been Michael
24 Schaller and yourself regarding this possible project.
25
A.
I don't think it was a very long conversation.
40
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 We probably chatted about mutual interests or friends or
2 something before he asked me the question.
3 he had been engaged in doing historical research for
4 some period of time and was checking to see if I might
5 be interested in being engaged in the same kind of
6 research project.
7 know, consider it.
8 with the attorney for whom he had been doing research.
9
Q.
Okay.
But he said
And I told him that I would, you
So he said he would put me in touch
When you left that very first
10 conversation with Michael Schaller, did you understand
11 that, in addition to just doing research, you would be
12 asked to act as a testifying witness?
13
A.
Yes, I understood that it was to -- to testify
14 ultimately if -- if the research, you know, was
15 completed.
16 Q.
17
18
And how long had he been doing this research, to
the best of your knowledge?
A.
I really don't know.
It could have been one
19 year, or it could have been five years.
20 discuss that.
21
22
Q.
We didn't
Had he already testified, or had he only been
performing research to that point?
23 A. I don't know.
24 Q. Had you ever testified in court before that
25
phone call took place --
41
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Yes.
2 Q. -- in any setting:
A witness, traffic court,
3 your own case, your friend's case, as a witness to an
4 accident, anything?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. And when had you testified in court?
7 A. I think when I was about 18.
8 Q. All right.
9
10
And the sort of -- just the
thumbnail sketch of what it was about.
A.
That was a small claims -- I think it's small
11 claims.
12 who had rented out her property to a school at which I
13 was a student, and she was making claims about the
14 damage to the property, and I was called as a witness.
15
Q.
In any case, it was a claim by an individual
Gotcha.
Other than that experience as a witness
16 in small claims court, had you ever been a witness in
17 any other proceeding?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. What?
20 A. Oh, there was a property dispute that I was
21 engaged in.
22 that.
23 had to do with the sale of a property in California.
I think I -- I think I gave a deposition in
But, honestly, I don't entirely remember.
24 Q. Real estate property?
25 A. Real estate.
That
42
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Q. Like land and houses kind of thing?
2 A. Correct, a house.
3 Q. Okay.
Other than those two, the small claims
4 and the dispute over a sale of the home, had you ever
5 been a witness in any other proceeding, regulatory or in
6 a regular court?
7
A.
Again I was involved in another small claims
8 over property at one point, probably 20 years ago -- no.
9 Maybe 18 years ago.
10
Q.
So if we go back ten to when Mr. Schaller
11 approached you, your last experience as a witness in
12 court prior to that had been ten years or so before
13 that, and that was in a property dispute?
14 A. That's correct.
15 Q. Had you ever been called upon to testify in any
16 court of law, administrative proceeding, or regulatory
17 matter within the area of your professional expertise?
18
19
20
A.
I had not ever testified in court about my
professional expertise.
Q.
In the three times that you had testified before
21 Mr. Schaller approached you, I would presume that those
22 were all what we call "fact witness" testimony.
23 not expert testimony.
It was
Is that correct?
24 A. That sounds right to me.
25 Q. So at the time Mr. Schaller called you to

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 propose this project, you had never been an expert
2 witness in any venue in your professional career?
3 A. Not in court, no.
4 Q. Had you ever been an expert witness in any venue
5
6
whatsoever?
A.
Well, I don't -- I don't know if this is --
7 would meet your definition or not, but I was on board
8 for the U.S. Department of State for six years, in which
9 I was asked, as a historian, to come and partake in
10 efforts to monitor the transparency of the U.S.
11 government with regard to diplomatic correspondence,
12 which is a congressionally-mandated advisory board.
13 I was one of nine people on that board.
14 So you see what I mean?
It's not a court, but
15 you're an expert, and you're asked to come in your
16 expert capacity to evaluate the activities of the
17 government.
18
19
Q.
Other than that experience, have you ever been
called upon in any forum to give expert testimony?
20 MR. KOETHE:
21 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I've not ever testified in a court
22 as an expert witness other than in these cases.
23 BY MR. WARRINER:

Q.
Okay.
When Mr. Schaller reached out to you, did
you basically suggest to him or say to him something

(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 along the lines of, Why are you calling me, I've never
2 done any work in the cigarette or smoking field ever
3 before?
4 MR. SUAREZ:
5 THE WITNESS:
Objection.
Form.
No, in the same sense that I had

19 Q. And your Ph.D. is in what?
20 A. It's in American history.
21 Q. Well, it doesn't surprise me that somebody might
22 call a Ph.D. in American history to write an American
23 history textbook.
24 would call somebody with a Ph.D. in American history,
25 who has never studied or published in the area of

8 develop additional witnesses would pay each witness by
9 the hour for the research that they did.
10
Q.
Were you one of other people that they were
11 reaching out to at the same time?
12 understood it?
Is that the way you
13 A. That's how I understood it.
14 Q. How many more witnesses were they looking for?
15
Did he tell you?
16 A. I don't know that.
17 Q. Did he tell you why they needed more witnesses?
18 A. Well, I -- as I indicated earlier, I believe
19 that I recall he said they would like some historians
20 who were working in California and had experience in
21 California, and he was -- you know, he's primarily
22 established in Arizona and also is from New York.
23
Q.
Did he ask you to give him any names of other
24 colleagues of yours in California that they might reach
25 out to as well?
47
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. No, he did not.
2 Q. Did you discuss the names of any other
3 colleagues, whether they were in California or not, that
4 you might know that might be willing to do this as well?
5
A.
We discussed other colleagues who were engaged
6 in that kind of work, but we did not talk about who
7 might be asked in the future.
8
9
Q.
I think the easiest way I can ask that
question -- I got kind of convoluted there -- was, Did
10 he ask you to give him the names of anybody else that
11 you thought might be willing to do this?
12 A. No, he did not.
13 Q. And who were the colleagues that you both
14
15
discussed were already engaged in this kind of work?
A.
He mentioned two that I recall off the top of my
16 head.
17 historian, now deceased; and another colleague named
18 Joan Hoff Wilson, who is still among us.
One was Stephen Ambrose, who's a well-known
19 Q. Did you know both of those people by name?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. All right.
22
23
What was the next step in the
process?
A.
I believe he gave my name to the attorney that
24 he was working with, and that person called me to set up
25 an appointment.
48
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Q. And who was that?
2 A. That was Allen Purvis, P-U-R-V-I-S.
3 Q. There was some shuffling of paper, and I didn't
4 hear that.
5 A. His last name is Purvis.
6 Q. Oh.
7
I thought I heard "Allen," but that was it.
Okay.
Thank you.
And where is Mr. Purvis?
Is he in California?
8 A. I believe he lives in Washington, D.C.
9 Q. Do you know what firm he's with?
10 A. I believe he's retired.
11 Q. Do you know what firm he was with at the time?
12 A. At the time, he was with Johnson, Tyler &
13
14
15
Purvis.
Q.
Any he was the first person that made contact
with you after you talked with Mr. Schaller?
16 A. Yes, he was.
17 Q. And was this a telephone call?
18 A. Yes, it was.
19 Q. Was there anybody else on the phone?
20 A. No.
21 Q. Tell me, as best you can recall, what the
22

subject and substance of that conversation was.
A.
It was very similar in kind to my conversation

And so we then set up a time to have an
3 Q. All right.
4 A. Yes, it did.
5 Q. From your conversation with Mr. Purvis, was it
Did that take place?
6 likewise clear after you got with that conversation
7 that, in addition to doing research, you were also going
8 to be called upon to testify in court?
9 A. He said that it might result in that.
10 Q. And did he tell you what the subject matter of
11
12
this, quote, research project was going to be?
A.
Yes.
He reiterated that it was about the
13 history of knowledge of the harms of smoking amongst the
14 general public.
15
Q.
All right.
And what new was it you were going
16 to bring to the table, with regard to that research
17 project, that had not been done a thousand times before?

It sounds like you're asking me to
And I can't answer that.
You already knew that Mr. Schaller had been
23 doing this for some period of time, that other
24 colleagues of yours, Ambrose and Hoff Wilson, had been
25 doing this for some time.
50
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Why was it that you were going to be called
2 upon, according to your conversation, to do new
3 research?
4
5
6
A.
Well, my understanding was that they wanted more
research on California, per se.
Q.
Had there ever been tobacco cases,
7 smoking-related cases, tried in the state of California
8 before this time, to your knowledge?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. Had there been witnesses called by the tobacco
11 companies in those cases, according to your knowledge as
12 of that time, that had fulfilled the exact same role
13 that they were going to ask you to fulfill, that be a
14 witness to get on the stand and talk about the state of
15 the public knowledge in the state of California with
16 regard to smoking- and health-related issues?
17
18
19
A.
I'm not sure.
There might have been one, but
I'm not entirely certain of that.
Q.
Did you ask Mr. Purvis what it was that you
20 would be doing in addition, if anything, to looking at
21 those issues in California-specific terms?
22
A.
I believe it's just -- I want to make sure.
23 Again, I'm having trouble following that.
24 understanding of your question is, again, what I would
25 be doing would be adding to the research base of
But my
51
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 knowledge about the harms of smoking in California, by
2 Californians.
3
Q.
When you say adding to the knowledge base, did
4 he suggest to you that they already had some existing
5 knowledge about that subject in California?
6
A.
We didn't talk about that.
He just -- he
7 mentioned that he had been engaged in this kind of
8 litigation in other parts of the country and asked if I
9 could help them out in California, if I would be willing
10
11
to do that research.
Q.
Did he suggest to you that you would be starting
12 from scratch; or was he going to give you an existing
13 database that had their current knowledge as to those
14 subjects, and you would be adding to that?
15 MR. KOETHE:
16 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
My understanding was that I would
17 entirely design my own research and begin from scratch,
18 begin where it made sense to me to begin.
19 BY MR. WARRINER:
20
21
Q.
then we talked about an in-person meeting.
22
23
24
25
And I think we talked about a phone call, and
When did the in-person meeting take place?
A.
I would say probably within a week or two of the
initial phone call with Mr. Purvis.
Q.
And where did that take place?
52
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. In my office at San Diego State University.
2 Q. Was anybody else present?
3 A. No.
4 Q. Did Mr. Purvis bring any information with him?
5 Did he bring any documents?
6 he bring any video images?
7 anything?

11
A.
Did he bring any data?

Q.
Okay.
And up to the point in time that
12 Mr. Purvis left that in-person meeting, had you come to
13 an agreement as to how you would be compensated?
14
15
A.
No.
We didn't come to an agreement at that
meeting.
16 Q. All right.
17 A. Again, he asked if I would be willing to work on
What happened at that meeting, then?

meeting.
12
13
No.
So Mr. Purvis comes out.
You-all have a
You speak about what we've talked about.
What was your next contact with him or anybody
else from the tobacco manufacturers?
A.
Gosh, I'm not sure.
I might have had another
15 phone call or -- with him.
16 years, so I don't remember every -- every contact I ever
17 had with him.
18
Q.
It's, you know, been ten
I also saw him in Washington, D.C.
And was the trip to D.C. specifically to go meet
19 with Mr. Purvis and/or his colleagues, or were you --
20 just happened to be in D.C., and this was a trip that
21 you made because you were already there?
22
A.
It was a combination of both things.
I did have
23 another professional obligation in Washington, so I
24 combined it with a meeting with him.
25
Q.
Okay.
Did you meet with him and anybody else or

just him?
A.
Oh, I think I met a couple of other people in
his office at that time.
4 Q. Do you remember any of their names?
5 A. I believe I was introduced to Julia Tyler at
6 that time.
7 who's first name -- last name is Johnson.
8 Tyler & Purvis.
9 but the first named partner in that firm.
10
11
Q.
And I'm forgetting the name of the person
Johnson,
I cannot recall offhand her first name,
Fair enough.
It was a long time ago, and I
don't want to hold you to first names.
12 A. Well, just don't tell her, please.
13 Q. Tell me, then, at that meeting what happened.
14 A. It would have, again, been more informal.
I
15 think that they -- you know, he told me about some of
16 his research that he had collected, things that he, you
17 know, had in his own possession.
18 about some of the magazines that tended to cover this
19 issue very frequently, such as Reader's Digest, which,
20 of course, as you know, was one of the publications that
21 Mr. Soffer read.
22
23
24
25
Q.
We probably talked
Did Mr. Purvis suggest to you that he already
had a collection of those types of materials?
A.
I knew he had some materials in his own
possession, yes.
57

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

(212) 490-34301
Q.
Other than magazines, did he tell you that he
2 had in his possession any other types of materials on
3 this subject?
4 A. Yes, he did.
5 Q. What else did he have?
6 A. Oh, he, for example, had a little display in his
7 office of nicknacks that he had collected pertaining to
8 the subject, board games, and other kinds of things like
9 that.
10
Q.
Any other documents that would potentially speak
11 to the subject that you were going to study other than
12 magazine articles?
13
14
A.
Yes.
He had some newspaper articles that -- in
his possession, and we discussed those.
15 Q. California newspapers or others?
16 A. I think at that time it was others.
17 Q. Like what?
18 A. Oh.
Gosh, I don't remember which -- it seems to
19 me this might have been around the time that they were
20 starting to do some research in Florida on the Engle
21 case.
22 Florida newspapers, probably.
23
24
25
Q.
So I believe he would have made reference to some
Do you remember him happening to mention any New
York Times material at that meeting?
A.
Again, I just don't remember the specific

2 he had New York Times information.
3
Q.
I came to be aware, at some point, that
Other than newspapers and magazines, any other
4 kind of documentation that you can remember that
5 Mr. Purvis had already collected and had at his
6 disposal?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. What else?
9 A. Well, I recall that he had a collection of
10 information that Michael Schaller had sent him from
11 archives at Loma Linda University in California, in Loma
12 Linda.
13 Q.
What kind of materials were those?
14 A.
Well, Loma Linda is a -- an institution of the
15 Seventh-Day Adventists, and so this was some information
16 from their archives on their many, many attempts to
17 develop programs to help smokers quit smoking and to
18 generally educate the public about the harms of smoking.
19 Q. Anything else that he had?
20 A. I'm sure there were other things, but that's
21
22
what I'm recalling off the top.
Q.
All right.
And by the time you left that
23 meeting, had you come to an agreement as to how you
24 would be compensated?
25
A.
Yes.
59
(212) 279-9424

Thank you.
BY MR. WARRINER:
Q.
Before we took a quick break, you had identified
20 for me three areas of documentation that Mr. Purvis
21 related to you at this in-person meeting, they had
22 already had extensive collections on.
23 articles, the second was newspaper articles, and the
24 third was some stuff from Loma Linda that Mr. Schaller
25 had already collected for them.
One was magazine

(212) 490-34301
In addition to those materials, did Mr. Purvis
2 inform you of or show you any other collections of
3 documents that they had already put together?
4 A. Not that I recall.
5 Q. Did he take you to any particular location to
6 show you what it was that they had already collected, or
7 were they just bringing some stuff into a conference
8 room?
9
A.
No.
We met at his office, so he sort of pointed
10 to like, for example, the shelves.

Q.
You know, here's my
So it was -- it was right out there in his
Where was the Loma Linda collection that had
been put together by Mr. Schaller?
16 A. It seemed to me that he had that in a file.
17 Q. Okay.
18
19
20
21
22
What about the magazines and newspaper
articles?
A.
I just don't recall how he had them set up.
They could have been in notebooks or something maybe.
Q.
And by the time you left that day, did you have
a copy of those?
23 A. No, I did not.
24 Q. Did he promise to make copies and send them to
25
you?
61
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. No, he did not.
2 Q. So it was just sort of the subject of some
3
conversation?
4 A. That's correct.
5 Q. When you left that day, did he suggest to you
6 that they would be willing to share previous research
7 and collection of documents relating to these topics?
8 A. I didn't ask him to.
9 Q. At the time you were in Mr. Purvis's office, did
10 he let you know that they had an extensive collection,
11 probably going back 50 years, of video clips of
12 television, news, movies that discussed or mentioned or
13 included the topics that you were going to be
14 researching?
15 A. I don't recall discussing that that day.
16 Q. What was your next interaction with anybody from
17
18
Mr. Purvis's firm or anybody else along those lines?
A.
Oh, I probably would have sent a bill to his
19 office at the end of the first month that I was working
20 on this kind of research.
21 me that was my next contact, was with an administrator
22 of some sort.
And so I think -- it seems to
23 Q. So you went back home and you started work?
24 A. I did.
25 Q. You told me that you had the opportunity to

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
design the research project.
2
3
Did you ever send Mr. Purvis anything in writing
outlining what your research design was?
4 A. No, I did not.
5 Q. Did you ever jot down, even for yourself, in
6 terms of notes or memorandum, what your research design
7 was?
8 A. No, not my research design.
9 Q. Is that documented anywhere, or is it just in
10 your head?
11 A. That's in my head.
12 Q. And as of the time you left Mr. Purvis's office
13 in Washington, D.C. back in 1999 and returned home to
14 start work, what did you understand your assignment was?
15
A.
Well, he had offered to engage me to do research
16 on what people knew about the harms of smoking from the
17 first time that Europeans became aware of tobacco and
18 started using tobacco up to the present, with an
19 emphasis in particular on keeping an eye out for
20 information on California and how that -- how that
21 information was passed on to children and adults in
22 California.
23
Q.
I asked you a question earlier, you know,
24 basically asking you if you were going to start from
25 scratch.

What was your understanding from Mr. Purvis as
2 to level and amount of effort that had been expended
3 prior to them engaging you on the subjects

20 MR. SUAREZ: Objection. Form.
21 THE WITNESS:
He did not tell me the specific
22 number of hours that he had been engaged in this.
23 Obviously books have been written about the history of
24 tobacco, so I can deduce from that that people have
25 spent an amount of time working on them over the years.

Q.
My question is more specific to paid witnesses
doing research for the tobacco industry.
4
Did you have any understanding at all, as of the
5 time you left Mr. Purvis's office and went back to
6 California to start your research -- of the
7 non-California-specific information regarding
8 publicly-available knowledge of smoking and health, did
9 you have any understanding of how much time and effort
10 the cigarette industry had already spent researching
11 that?
12 MR. KOETHE:
13 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I did not know how much time had
14 been spent on those general questions.

16
Q.
And regardless of how much time had been spent
17 by the tobacco industry on that very subject, they asked
18 you to, once again, at $175 an hour, do the same
19 research over again?

But it's important
I appreciate that.
Did you start afresh or de novo?
16 A. Yes, I started afresh.
17 Q. And you did that without any knowledge as to
18 what other people had already done on the subject for
19 the cigarette industry?
20 A. No, that's not true.
21 Q. Okay.
Well, tell me what your -- the extent of
22 your knowledge was, when you started your project, of
23 what the cigarette industry had already done in terms of
24 researching this topic non-California-specific.

with any of that?
11 A. No.

They -- no.

20 you or did you not have provided to you, at the time you
21 started your project, materials that had already been
22 gathered by other people?
23 A. No.
24 Q. It goes one of two ways.

7 else?

As I just mentioned, I
10 subsequently asked Michael Schaller, for example, to
11 share with me some of what he had.
12 BY MR. WARRINER:
13 Q. Is he the only one that you asked to share?
14 A. No.
15 Q. Who else?
16 A. One that I'm recalling off the top was Greg
17 Black, who was a professor in Kansas who had done
18 research on media, and I received some information from
19 him about -- I think it was PSAs, public service
20 announcements, because his specialty is media research.
21
22
Q.
25
Now we've got two people that you asked
for documents from.
23

Okay.
Anybody else?
A.

Q.
At what point in the process -- how many
21 meetings did you have with Mr. Purvis and/or his

I'm sorry.
13 Mr. Kushner why it was they were asking you to now do
14 research California-specific when they already had

him?
A.
I think it was Allen Purvis who told me that he
5 knew Greg Black, and I think they were both in the same
6 city at some point in Missouri or Kansas City, something
7 like that.
8 Q.
9
And was Mr. Black -- did he have this special
interest in PSAs because of his academic position, or
10 had he done that work on behalf of the cigarette
11 manufacturers?
12
A.
Well, as I said, I believe his specialty is
13 media, so I know he's done research on that for his
14 academic specialty.

16
Q.
Beyond that, I don't know.
Do you know if he had been engaged by the
cigarette manufacturers?

He works -- has worked on -- started out on U.S.
Imperialism in the Philippines, and he looked at
74
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 teachers in the Philippines, that kind of thing,
2 American reformers who had gone there to, quote/unquote,
3 educate and uplift, unquote.
4
Q.
And what part of his work would have generated
5 issues, documents, or videos or whatever the like is
6 that's relevant to this exercise here?
7
A.
I'm very sorry.
I just cannot remember the
8 specific materials that he would have sent me.
9 you know, I've got so many -- many, many thousands of
10 documents.
11 to send me ten years ago.
12
Q.
I've --
I just don't recall which ones I asked him
Okay.
Let's see.
I've got a blank here.
13 think you mentioned -- you mentioned Schaller.
14 stuff from Schaller, Purvis, Black, the fellow in
15 Oregon, Howard Kushner, and one other person?
16 A. No.
17 Q. I wasn't writing fast enough.
18 A. I'm sorry.
19
I
You got
I didn't--
I didn't say I got anything from
Allen Purvis.
20 Q. Maybe I misspoke.
21 A. On -- oh.
I recall.
At one point I got some
22 information from John Snetsinger, who I think is at San
23 Luis Obispo, Cal Poly.
24 Q. How do you spell "Snetsinger"?
25 A. I believe it's S-N-E-T-S-I-N-G-E-R.
But there
75
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 could be a Z snuck in there somewhere and I'm not
2 recalling.
3 Q.
4
5
And what kind of information did you get from
him?
A.
He told me about research he had done up at the
6 University of California medical archives up in San
7 Francisco.
8 went there myself, again, to corroborate some of what he
9 sent me and to do some additional research.
10 Q.
11 Francisco?
12 A.
So he sent me some of that.
And then I also
Where did that research take place in San
Where did you go?
I don't remember the street that it's on.
13 a university in the hills in San Francisco.
14 don't remember the address.
It's
I just
15 Q. The University of California at San Francisco?
16 A. I think that is it, yeah.
17 it definitively.
18 But, yes, virtually certain.
19
20
21
Q.
Okay.
But I'd hate to say
I feel like I ought to look that up.
And the purpose of your trip to UCSF was
what?
A.
Well, I wanted to look at the archives having to
22 do with the antismoking movement in California, which
23 has been very extensive going back into the 1950s, the
24 1940s when Mr. -- well, in this particular case, when
25 Mr. Soffer was also resident in California.
But at the
76
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
time I was doing that research, it was more general.
Q.
Okay.
And the year in which you actually went
3 to UCSF and did some research was what, if you can
4 remember?
5 A. No, I don't recall the year.
6 Q. Would it have been prior to testifying in the
7
Boeken case?
8 A. I'm sorry.
9 Q. You don't remember if you did that before or
10
I just don't recall the year.
after Boeken?
11 A. No, I don't recall.
12 Q. Do you know if the UCSF medical school library
13 had put together the Legacy Documents before you went
14 there?
15 A.
I don't know.
16 Q.
Do you know what those are?
17 A.
Well, you can remind me.
18
It might be the papers
associated with the tobacco industry --
19 Q. Yes.
20 A. -- that Stanton Glantz has put together.
21 Q. Yeah.
Have you ever, at any time you've been to
22 UCSF, gone to the special collection section and looked
23 at the Legacy compilation of documents?
24
25
A.
I have gone to the archives and looked at
documents related to smoking and antismoking, and I'm
77
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 not sure if those were a part of the Legacy collection
2 or not.
3
4
Q.
Other than the people you have mentioned, have
you -- well, strike that.
5 Mr. Snetsinger, do you know if the research that
6 he had done in the medical archives had been for himself
7 personally, or had he done that at the request of a
8 cigarette manufacturer or a lawyer for the cigarette
9 manufacturer?
10
11
12
13
A.
As I understand it, he was doing it as a part of
research related to litigation.
Q.
And was his contact also Mr. Purvis or somebody
in his firm?
14 A. That, I don't know.
15 Q. Any other historian that you have been in touch
16 with, all the way up till today, with regard to
17 documents in tobacco litigation, other than the people
18 you've already mentioned?
19
20
21
A.
Are you asking me are there any other
individuals?
Q.
22
I know there's a lot more.
But my question to you is, Have you personally
23 had contact with any others?
24 the day you first met somebody until today.
25
A.
Yeah, I believe so.
And I'm talking about from
I believe so.
78
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Q. Who else, please?
2 A. And I'm sorry.
3
You said other historians
engaged in this research.
4 Q. Correct.
5 A. Okay.
Right?
I'm just honestly not remembering the
6 names of different people.
7 talked with Richard Means, Dr. Richard Means, before his
8 death, about research he had done on education, for
9 example.
But, yes, for example, I
And I think there are probably a couple of
10 others, but I would just need to look at my notes to
11 refresh my memory on their names, because it really
12 truly has been quite a long time.
13
14
Q.
When you say you'd have to look at your notes,
what kind of notes do you keep about this activity?
15 MR. KOETHE:
16 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
What kind of notes do I keep?
17 Well, I keep, for example, things like time records and
18 bills.
19 BY MR. WARRINER:
20 Q. Okay.
21 A. I keep notes on depositions that I read.
22 Q. Okay.
23 A. I keep notes on particular cases.
What else?
What else?
So, for
24 example, in the case of Mr. Soffer, I'll have notes that
25 summarize for -- just for myself -- they're not
79
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 reports -- notes for myself about what I learned in
2 relation to his life and his family and the facts about
3 smoking as it pertained to him.
4
5
6
7
Q.
How are those notes different from the notes
that you make when you're reviewing depositions?
A.
Well, when I review a deposition, I'll have a
set of notes that are just about that deposition.
8 Q. Understood.
9 A. So that would be different from, you know, a
10
11
summary, a set of summary notes.
Q.
So you have at least two sets of notes on this
12 particular case we're talking about today.
13 notes made during deposition review and general notes on
14 the case that would reflect review of other items not
15 necessarily contained in depositions?
You have
16 A. That's correct.
17 Q. Any other notes that you keep as part of your
18
19
activity as a paid witness for the tobacco industry?
A.
I -- yes.
I would keep notes on, for example,
20 magazines, to give you a sense of this, like the
21 Reader's Digest, which I know is something that
22 Mr. Soffer read extensively for a number of decades.
23 And I have notes on almost every article they ever
24 published on this subject, which were more than 200
25 articles.
So just to keep them straight for myself, I
80
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
3
4
make notes on them.
Q.
And where did you get those Reader's Digest
articles?
A.
Well, from the Reader's Digest.
5 would xerox, myself.
6 research assistant to obtain.
7
Q.
Some of them I
Some of them I would ask my
Any other place?
Did you get any of those from
8 Mr. Purvis or any of these other historians that you've
9 engaged with over the years?
10 A. No.
11 Q. All right.
You keep notes on magazines, and
12 that might travel from case to case.
13 necessarily be notes for the Soffer case only.
14 might have another case where somebody is reported to
15 have read Reader's Digest, and those would be equally
16 applicable.
17
A.
That wouldn't
You
Correct?
Yes, that's correct.
For example, TIME magazine
18 had lots of news, more than a hundred -- well more than
19 a hundred articles on that, and I keep notes on those.
20 And in the case of Mr. Soffer, as an example, I know he
21 read TIME magazine, so I go back and look at my notes on
22 TIME, and then I might incorporate some of those in my
23 notes to myself, my summary notes about Mr. Soffer and
24 his family.
25
Q.
Now, just -- we'll get into this later.
81
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
But just so I can put this in context for
2 myself, when you go and you collect Reader's Digest
3 articles that discuss the issue of smoking and health,
4 do you collect them all?
5
A.
You collect as many as you can find.
You know,
6 no one is perfect.
7 one over five decades, six decades, seven decades in the
8 case of Reader's Digest, which started publicizing this
9 information in 1924.
10
11
Q.
Right.
So it's entirely possible you miss
But my question -- maybe it was
inartfully asked.
12
If you take the universe of those documents,
13 assuming that you have done an adequate job of locating
14 them all, do you then, thereafter, put them all in a pot
15 and read them all, or do you selectively take those that
16 you want to talk about out of the pot and put them on
17 your reliance list?
18 MR. KOETHE:
19 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I collect all of them and use all
20 of them in my assessment of a case.
21 BY MR. WARRINER:
22
Q.
And what is your criteria for actually pulling
23 an article from Reader's Digest to include in your
24 reliance list?
25
A.
I like to include representative samples.
So,
82
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 you know, it -- and also, of course, keeping in mind
2 that you can't use everything, just because it's too
3 voluminous.
4 representative.
5
Q.
So I try to get things which I think are
So if I -- which I don't have in front of me at
6 all.
7 intend to talk about or rely upon in this case.
8 there's a way to identify the Reader's Digest articles
9 and we put them all in a pile, we printed them up --
I don't even have a list of what it is that you
If
10 which we don't really do anymore very often -- but we
11 printed them all up, and we put them in a pile, would it
12 be your testimony that is not the entire universe of
13 Reader's Digest articles that discuss the issues of
14 smoking and health?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Those are just ones you have picked that you
17
want to talk about?
18 A. Yes, because they are representative.
19 Q. And where do you keep the entire universe of
20
Reader's Digest articles that you have collected?
21 A. In my office.
22 Q. Do you keep those electronically?
23 A. No.
24 Q. You have paper copies of all of them?
25 A. Yes, I do.
83
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Q. Do you have them stored electronically anywhere?
2 A. No, I do not.
Oh.
Well -- no, I don't.
But
3 they -- for example, they would be on discs so that when
4 we produce them for you, we have a disc of them.
5
Q.
Right.
But I'm not interested in the ones you
6 want to produce for me, which is a subset of all of
7 them.
8
9
I want to know, Do you have the entire universe
of Reader's Digest articles in electronic format
10 somewhere?
11 A. No, I do not.
12 Q. Who does the work -- when you pick the ones that
13 you want to talk about in front of the jury, who does
14 the work of actually creating the electronic copy of
15 that?
16

Q.
I assume that a secretary somewhere types up the

21
A.
Who does that?
How does it get out of your
The law firm has its own copies of most of or
22 much of this information.
23 new to them that they don't have in their archives or in
24 their files, and then they would add it at that time.
25 So sometimes I might create a .pdf, for example.
Sometimes I provide something
And I
84
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 would send it to an assistant and say, you know, Please

3
I don't -- I usually don't keep .pdfs, just

5 much information.
6 going, that I try do -- you know, I try to keep things
7 to what I actually need to keep.
8 copies.
9
Q.
10
All right.
I have so many different projects
So I keep the hard
So help me with the process.
It's time for you to decide what it is you want
11 to show the jury in the Soffer case, and that is some
12 subset of the Reader's Digest articles.
13
14
15
How, then, do you create the reliance list that
you give to me?
A.
I would have a conversation, typically with
16 Mr. Koethe, because he's the person I primarily work
17 with at Jones Day, although I've met some other
18 attorneys there, and we would discuss the case and where
19 the plaintiff lived.
20 In this case, say, Mr. Soffer, I was aware that
21 he'd lived in any number of towns in the United States.
22 So I would begin by saying, Okay.
23 example, about California.
24
25
Let's talk, for
I know he was in California from roughly 1958 to
1965.
So then I'd say, Okay.
Well, now let's make sure
85
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 that we have all, you know, the information or top hits
2 of the Los Angeles Times.
3
And there are 372 articles in the Los Angeles
4 Times about the harms of smoking in that period.
5 know he was an avid reader, so there's a good chance --
6 his wife said he read the paper every day, cover to
7 cover -- that he was seeing many of those 372 articles.
8 But I would try to select ones I thought would be most
9 important:
We
For example, something that might have been
10 on the front page, in this case, that covered the years
11 of the Surgeon General's Report.
12 there that I thought were particularly useful.
13
There are articles in
For example, they would -- there was one article
14 where they gave the whole -- well, not the whole report
15 but an excerpt from the entire report.
16 course, is, I don't know, a hundred pages.
17 example, Los Angeles Times, on the day that that
18 announcement was made by the Surgeon General, had
19 44 feet, linear feet, of coverage on the subject of the
20 harms of smoking.
21
The report, of
But, for
So, you know, obviously I'm not going to have
22 him put all 44 feet.
23 the lead article, and let's take some letters to the
24 editor, maybe something from the health column, that
25 kind of thing.
So I would say, Hey, let's take
86
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
So we'd have that sort of discussion, and then
2 it would spread out from there, looking at different
3 cities, different towns, also educational records and
4 things like that.
5
Q.
Okay.
Going back to Reader's Digest, because I
6 want to focus on that for a minute, that's a national
7 publication.
8
9
10
11
A.
Yes.
Correct?
Really it's an international publication,
because it's from the U.S. but it's published abroad as
well.
Q.
But you don't have to be city-specific when you
12 go looking for Reader's Digest articles that you want to
13 include.
Correct?
14 A. That's true.
15 Q. How many Reader's Digest articles do you have in
16
17
your collection?
A.
I'm going to guess -- I think it's around 130,
18 something like that.
19 number.
20
21
22
Q.
But I could be wrong about that
And how many of those appear on your reliance
list in this case?
A.
I don't know.
I'd have to go and count them up.
23 I don't choose it based on a number.
24 on --
25
Q.
I choose it based
Can you give me an estimate?
87
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
3
A.
No, I really can't.
I would need to look at the
list to count them.
Q.
When you say that the universe of ones that you
4 have is 130 articles, what is your criteria for choosing
5 each of those to include in the 130?
6 A. You mean which -- how do I choose the subset?
7 Q. No. How do you choose the 130?
8 A. Oh. I choose everything that they have written
9
that I could find on the harms of smoking.
And Reader's
10 Digest has always been vehemently against smoking, so
11 those would be the only kind of articles that they would
12 run on that subject.
13 every decade and found what I could.
14
Q.
So I, you know, went through it
Has Reader's Digest ever published an article
15 that discusses the controversy about the harms of
16 smoking?
17
A.
Well, they would have articles that, for
18 example, would raise questions:
19 headlines, "How Harmful Is Smoking?"
20 question.
21 information at that time.
22 their conclusion, in every article I recall at the
23 moment, was always it's very harmful, don't do it.
24
25
Q.
You know, for example,
So that would be a
And then they would refer to the state of
Again, they -- you know,
But back to my question again, my question is --
I want to know how you get to your 130.
88
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Is that every article that Reader's Digest has
2 ever written about smoking and harm, regardless of
3 whether there's a controversy discussed or they draw a
4 conclusion that's favorable to your position or
5 whatever?
6
7
A.
It would be every article on the subject
that I could find.
8
9
Yes.
MR. WARRINER:
MR. KOETHE:
11 MR. WARRINER:
12 (Off record)
14
Can we take another five,
please?
10
13
Okay.
Yes.
Thank you.
BY MR. WARRINER:
Q.
Dr. Hoffman, I kind of put a little checkmark
15 where I left off.
16 questions for some stuff earlier that I kind of missed.
17
I've got a couple of follow-up
Number one, have the attorneys for R.J. Reynolds
18 told you that in this venue, Gainesville, Florida, we
19 have been ordered by the court to produce a 100-exhibit
20 exhibit list for all witnesses and trial?
21 A. Yes, I heard something to that effect.
22 Q. And the reliance list that you've brought to
23 this deposition today, how many documents are on that
24 list?
25
A.
There are around 6,000.
89
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
And what are you doing to try to come up with
2 less than a hundred documents for your portion of the
3 testimony?
4 A.
Well, we haven't gotten down to winnowing it
5 down yet.
6 some input about ones that I think are particularly
7 important to have on there.
8 got a set 100 yet.
9 know.
10
Q.
We have talked some about it, and I've given
It is.
But I don't think we have
It's very difficult, as I'm sure you
And I'm not being critical of it.
It
11 just puts me in a pickle having to take your deposition
12 before that hundred is settled, if you know what I mean.
13 A. Uh-huh.
14 Q. I'm with you on it's not easy to take thousands
15 of documents and make it a hundred.
16 before the court already.
17
It's been discussed
But for purposes of deposing you today, it
18 causes me a lot of problems in apprising the plaintiff
19 of what they're going to see when they come to trial, if
20 you know what I mean.
21 A. Sure.
22 Q. Which is really the purpose of this deposition
23 because, as you know, the historians for the defendants
24 come with the most documents out of anybody.
25 up with a lot of documents.
They show
And it's only fair that
90
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 both sides kind of have a reasonable idea of what's
2 coming.
3
So I'll tackle that in a minute, as best I can.
Second thing I wanted to ask you is, Have you
4 been provided a copy of the Engle opinion, and have you
5 read it?
6 A. No.
7 Q. Have you been told by the lawyers what the
8 issues are that are to be tried in these post-Engle
9 cases? 10 A. No.
11 Q. Have you been provided a copy of the complaint
12
that was filed in this case?
13 A. Yes, I have.
14 Q. Are you aware of the fact that, in this case,
15
16
the plaintiff admits some fault for his injury?
A.
The plaintiff is not a he.
It's his wife.
He's
17 deceased, so -- the fellow who had lung cancer.
18 not sure what you mean by the plaintiff, he has admitted
19 responsibility.
20
21
Q.
Okay.
So I'm
Let me change the question just a little
bit.
22 Are you aware of the fact that the plaintiff,
23 who is the personal representative of the estate, has
24 admitted fault on behalf of the smoker?
25
A.
No.
I'm sorry.
I just -- I -- I haven't
91
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 followed that.
2 admitted to.
3
Q.
Okay.
I don't know how much fault she's
Now, so I will know, in terms of history,
4 I'm aware of your having testified, participated in the
5 Boeken case.
6
Prior to giving testimony recently in two
7 Florida cases that are set for trial in Gainesville,
8 what other tobacco cases have you been disclosed as a
9 witness for any cigarette company or any lawyer for any
10
11
cigarette company in since the Boeken case?
A.
I would have to do some research to give you a
12 comprehensive list.
13 right off are the Brown case and the Daniels case, and
14 they were both in California.
But two case that come to mind
15 Q. Did those cases go to trial?
16 A. No, they did not.
17 Q. Do you know what happened to them?
18 A. I believe that the Daniels case was dismissed.
19 And I think that the Brown case had to go up to the
20 state supreme court.
21 have been revivified recently.
22
Q.
Gotcha.
And I thank it may be -- it might
So it was a case that went up to the
23 appellate courts on pretrial issues before it was ever
24 actually tried?
25
A.
Yes, that's my understanding.

Q.
Did you ever give a deposition in either Brown
or Daniels?
3 A.
Yes, I did.
4 Q.
One or both?
5 A.
Both.
6 sorry.
7 2003, I think it was.
At least I believe it was both.
I'm
That's been, probably, six or seven years also.
8 Q. Around 2003 you gave depositions in both cases?
9 A. I believe so.
10 Q. And then recently in Florida, you've been
11
12
deposed in Patterson and Evers, both Gainesville cases?
A.
I've been deposed in both of those cases, but
13 they're not Gainesville cases, I don't believe.
14 they're both in Tampa, if I recall right.
15
Q.
Oh.
I think
Okay.
16 Do you know whether or not you've been disclosed
17 in any cases in Florida other than Patterson, Evers, and
18 Soffer?
19
A.
I know I'm doing research in some other cases,
20 but I'm not sure whether I've been disclosed in them.
21 I'm sorry.
22 works. 23 Q. How many other cases are you doing research in?
24 A. Probably seven or eight.
25 Q. Do you know the venues of those cases?
I just don't quite know how that process

A.
They're mostly in Tampa.
I think there's one
2 that's -- might be up in Escambia County, but I just
3 don't recall offhand.
4
Q.
Can you give me an estimate -- and I know it's
5 been a while, and this is probably of record in
6 deposition testimony and/or trial testimony -- give me
7 an estimate as to the number of hours you spent
8 researching and doing what it is you do before you
9 actually testified in Boeken?
10 MR. SUAREZ:
11 THE WITNESS:
Objection.
Form.
So are you asking the number of
12 hours I worked before the Boeken case went to trial?
13 BY MR. WARRINER:
14 Q. Yes, ma'am.
15 A. I'm very sorry.
16 offhand.
17 correctly.
18 Q.
I don't know that number
I would have to do the research to answer it
It's -- that's been almost ten years.
And by the time the trial was over in Boeken, do
19 you have any recollection at all as to what you had
20 billed Mr. Purvis's firm?
21
A.
No.
I'm sorry.
I don't know that number.
22 would just really have to guess, and I don't think
23 that's appropriate.
24
25
Q.
How about the number in Brown or Daniels?
I
Do
you know that?
94
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. No.
2 Q. How about to date in Patterson and Evers?
Do
3 you know what you've billed the defense in those case to
4 this point?
5
A.
No.
Again, each case is a separate set of
6 hours, and so I'd have to go back and tease them out and
7 add them up.
8 you.
I'm very sorry.
I can't estimate that for
9 Q. You keep records on all this, don't you?
10 A. I sure do.
11 Q. And can you give me an estimate as to the number
12 of hours you've spent in the seven or eight cases that
13 you've not been deposed in yet?
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
A.
No.
I can't break it out that way without
looking at the documents.
Q.
In each of the Florida cases to date, have you
been retained by the same entity?
A.
I have worked consistently for Jones Day during
this period of time.
Q.
Do you know which company -- which cigarette
company they represent?
22 A. I believe they represent R.J. Reynolds.
23 Q. To the best of your knowledge, have you done any
24
25
paid expert witness work for any other tobacco company?
A.
At any point in time?

3
Q.
In the Florida litigation.
Let's just limit it
to that.
A.
In the Florida litigation.
Well, as I
4 understand, some of these cases have multiple
5 defendants.
6 Jones Day, it may be, without my being aware of it, that
7 they are also defending the other companies to the
8 extent that they're implicated in each case.
9
10
Q.
So in that sense, although I'm working for
But your contact in each case has been the Jones
Day firm?
11 A. That's correct.
12 Q. Okay.
Now, since you began agreeing to act as a
13 witness in cigarette smoking cases, have you ever
14 actually gotten together physically with any of the
15 other historians who are participating, as well as
16 witnesses, in these cases?
17
A.
Yeah.
18 MR. KOETHE:
19 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
If you're asking have I ever seen
20 other historians in person who have done this work, the
21 answer is yes.
22 BY MR. WARRINER:
23
Q.
Okay.
A little more direct question:
Other
24 than seeing them possibly in an academic meeting or
25 something like that, have you ever gotten together with
96
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 any of them where the purpose of the meeting was to
2 discuss testifying and/or doing research in these cases?
3
A.
I believe I -- I once met in person with John
4 Snetsinger to discuss his research.
5 it's mostly been on the phone.
6
Q.
Other than that,
Now, similar to some questions I asked you
7 earlier, let's fast-forward to, you know, 2010.
8 you've done, I think it would probably be safe to say,
9 hundreds of hours of research in these smoking-related
10 cases.
11 A.
Would that be a fair estimate?
It sounds logical, but I just don't have the
12 number in front of me.
13 amount of research, certainly.
14 hundreds by now, I would suspect.
15
Q.
By now
But I've done a substantial
It probably would be
And you've engaged in -- let's see.
You've
16 given one, two depositions, three, four depositions, at
17 least five, and this is the sixth deposition in a
18 smoking-related case.
19
20
21
22
23
A.
Would that be a fair estimate?
Yeah, Boeken and the two California cases and
three now in Florida.
Q.
And I think you said your reliance list in this
case alone is 6,000 documents.
A.
Yes.
Correct?
This -- my initial list, from which we
24 will try to winnow down to a hundred or fewer, has --
25 presently, it has 5,633 documents.
97
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
And am I safe in assuming that that is a subset
2 of the documents that, over time, you have collected on
3 the issue of smoking and health?
4 A. Yes, that's correct.
5 Q. And how many documents would you say you have in
6 total? 7 A.
8
I could not give you a fair estimate of that.
It's too voluminous.
9 Q. Is it more than double 6,000?
10 A. I think that would be easily the case.
11 Q. How about triple?
12 A. Easily the case.
13 Q. Give me your best estimate of how many total
14
15
16
17
documents you have.
A.
I really could not give you an adequate
estimate.
Q.
I'd be guessing too wildly.
I'm sorry.
Well, triple's getting close to 20,000, and you
18 said "easily."
19 before you would say, Now you're starting to make me
20 uncomfortable with that estimate?
21
A.
So how much farther would I have to go
I just don't know to -- Los Angeles Times, for
22 example, there are 72 articles on this list from Los
23 Angeles Times.
24 Los Angeles Times.
25 don't know what you would have to multiply it by to get,
But I know I have about 2800 from the
So 72, of course, multiplied -- I
98
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 you know, almost 3,000.
2 know, some other record collections as well.
3 and I discussed earlier, we talked about the Reader's
4 Digest. It would be a small subset of this much larger
5 number. Same would be true for TIME magazine and a
6 number of other collections.
7 Q.
8 this area?
9 A.
So that would be true of, you
And as you
Do you have any present intent to publish in
I don't have an intent beyond what I've already
10 done in the textbook that I published that has some
11 materials on this subject.
12 Q. Which textbook is that?
13 A. It's called Major Problems In American History,
14
15
1865 to the Present.
Q.
And other than that work which you've done in
16 the past, do you have any intent to publish any kind of
17 book chapter, scholarly article, treatise, manuscript,
18 or anything along those lines on the issues about which
19 you testify in these cases?
20
A.
Not at present.
That could change, but I have
21 other publication plans right now that require me to
22 spend my time on them.
23
Q.
Has the research design or research plan that
24 you have engaged in in coming up with the documents that
25 you present in these cases ever been subjected to any
99
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
peer review process?
2 MR. KOETHE:
3 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Normally a research plan would not
4 be subject to peer review in my field.
5 we work as historians.
6 BY MR. WARRINER:
7
Q.
Okay.
That's not how
Has the historical method that you've
8 applied in these cases ever been subjected to any peer
9 review process?
10
A.
The historical method is generally not a subject
11 of peer review.
12 the subject, but it's not something that one's peers
13 look at and opine on.
14
15
16
Q.
It's something you'll find in books on
What would be the subject of peer review in a
scholarly historical treatise?
A.
The subject of peer review would be an article,
17 typically, sometimes a book.
18 you'd be looking at the proof of the pudding, the proof
19 of the process rather than somebody analyzing the
20 starting point.
21
22
23
24
25
Q.
That -- so, in a sense,
Or the methodology employed at reaching
conclusions?
A.
Methodology could come in for scrutiny if the
methodology was clearly inadequate.
Q.
And what was the original assignment you were
100
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 given, this sort of working hypothesis or thesis about
2 which you then applied some scholarly historic method to
3 testify?
4 A. I wasn't given a working hypothesis.
5 Q. What was the working hypothesis that you then
6
7
sort of derived on your own if you weren't given one?
A.
I didn't have a working hypothesis.
The way we
8 start is with a question.
9 about the answers, but you don't really start with a
10
11
12
You might have some hunches
hypothesis about the answer.
Q.
What was the question that you started with in
this case --
13 A. The --
14 Q. -- that you tried to answer through your
15
16
research, I guess?
A.
Right.
The question was, What did the public
17 know, and when did they know it, about the hazards of
18 smoking, which would include things like addiction,
19 heart disease, circulation problems, lung diseases, and
20 such matters?
21 out with.
22
23
Q.
So that was the question that I started
So what did the public know, and when did they
know it, about those issues?
24 A. Correct.
25 Q. And explain to me what relevance that has to,
101
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
say, for example, somebody like Mr. Soffer.
2 MR. KOETHE:
3 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I think that it's relevant to find
4 out what Mr. Soffer would have been told by schools and
5 what the schools intended to educate kids about, for
6 example, in Philadelphia where he grew up, and also what
7 newspapers were saying about this topic during the years
8 that he was, as his two wives put it, an avid newspaper
9 reader.
So it seems to me relevant in this case to
10 establishing his state of knowledge prior to and during
11 the years that he was smoking.
12 BY MR. WARRINER:
13
Q.
All right.
So can I understand from what you
14 just said that you equate public knowledge to what
15 Mr. Soffer knew?
16 MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
17 MR. SUAREZ: Objection.
18 THE WITNESS:
19
20
21
Form.
Could you just restate it for me,
please.
MR. WARRINER:
I'll have the court reporter read
that one back.
22 THE WITNESS:
23 (Record read)
24 MR. SUAREZ:
25 THE WITNESS:
Okay.
Same objection.
I think that Mr. Soffer was a
102
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 member of the public.
2 looking at public knowledge then, yes, I am including
3 him in that, and his family.
4 BY MR. WARRINER:
5
Q.
And so to the extent that I am
So you intend to come to court and testify, for
6 example, if there is an article in the L.A. Times that
7 reveals risks of smoking, that Mr. Soffer knew that?
8
9
A.
I'm going to testify that he was, as his family
has documented, an avid reader who read all of the
10 newspaper every day and sometimes got additional
11 newspapers during the same day and that he would have,
12 as a consequence of that, have learned about the dangers
13 of smoking and would have been very well apprised of
14 them as, by the way, of course, his wife also said he
15 was, since she said he knew very well that it was
16 harming him and could harm him.
17 corroborate her statement, basically.
18
19
Q.
All right.
So this would
So you just made this a very
difficult deposition for me.
20 A. Sorry.
21 Q. I want you to do me a favor, and I want you to
22 take the list that you brought, and I want you to put a
23 checkmark by every document or video or newspaper
24 article or magazine article or Reader's Digest article
25 that you can go to Gainesville, Florida and get on a
103

(212) 490-34301 witness stand and swear in front of a jury that
2 Mr. Soffer read or saw.
3
A.
Well, I must tell --
4 MR. SUAREZ:
5 I just want to note an objection to form.
6 Go ahead.
7 THE WITNESS:
8 Let me be clear.
9
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Thank you.
I'm not saying that I can
establish that he read any article in particular.
For
10 example, even though he was said to have read the Los
11 Angeles Times every day and there could have been a day
12 he was ill, for example, and -- or, you know, maybe
13 there was a newspaper strike or -- I don't know.
14 really can't say.
15 on the list and say every article he would have
16 certainly read.
17
So I
And so I could not tick off for you
What I can say is that the probability is that,
18 considering the testimony of his family, that he would
19 have come across many of these articles.
20 that his school was required to provide him with
21 information about the harms of smoking, and his teachers
22 were mandated by state law, under penalties of losing
23 their jobs, that they had to tell him about this.
24 can't swear, however, that they actually followed
25 through on their obligation or that he was listening.
Or I can say
I
104
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 But I can say that he was repeatedly exposed to the
2 information, and I think that that's -- I think that

I think I've already told --
BY MR. WARRINER:
Q.
Can you do that -- let me just ask the first
question.
Can you do that for a single item on your
reliance list?
18 MR. SUAREZ: Objection.
19 MR. KOETHE: Yeah, it's compound.
20 THE WITNESS:
Form.
I could go through the list and
21 look at it again to see if there's one document that
22 perhaps his family referred to that I'm not recalling
23 right now that -- where they would say, Yeah, we saw
24 that movie together.
25
So I don't recall that.
As it is, as I said, I don't believe that
105
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 there's any document, at least at this moment, that I
2 could pin down to his having held in his hands.
3 can say is that he's read all of these newspapers day
4 after day for 50 years, and so I think that he would
5 have gotten this information.
6 would have gotten this information in one form or
7 another, and also because his wife said he did.

Okay.
All I

3 or was exposed to that particular item on the list?

6 question a couple of times.

Well, you've answered it the way you want to
answer it, and I don't see it as an answer, and I don't
want to argue --
11
12
Compound.
MR. SUAREZ:
Again -- again, please ask the
question.
13
MR. WARRINER:
I did ask the question, and the
14 response I got was, "I believe I've answered that."
15 That's not a response to a question that's appropriate.
16 Somebody will be able to look at this and be able to
17 make a judgment at some later point in time whether or
18 not she did or did not.
19 about whether she answered the question.
20 did.

MR. SUAREZ:
Objection.

answered.
3
THE WITNESS:
No, I cannot -- I cannot do that,
4 because I don't have a photograph, for example, of him
5 sitting at a table holding the article.
6 to me, would be probably the only real proof that he
7 read anything.

9 that he read all of the paper.
That -- that,
And, in which case, his family would be
That's what his wife

But, I mean, you
know, at some point in time --
21 MR. KOETHE:
22 MR. WARRINER:
She's answered your question.
At some point in time, I have the
23 opportunity to direct the witness to answer my question
24 as it's been asked and not give all this editorial stuff
25 about photographs and whether or not the family's being

All right.
Well, that's fair.
8 If you think that I'm changing the question, I'll break
9 it down into very small subparts and make sure that the

11 legal argument on our hands at the back end of this.

Q.
Dr. Hoffman, is there a single item on your

Is there a single video that's contained on your

22 Gainesville, Florida, look a jury in the eyes under
23 oath, and tell them that you can say Mr. Soffer saw the
24 video?
25 A.
I don't think so, but I don't recall.
I would
109
(212) 279-9424

3 example, Yul Brynner came up.
4 daughter, Joyce Soffer, who brought that up.
5 can't recall now if she said she saw it with her dad.

And when I said "article" before, I want
10 to make sure that it's clear on the record I intend
11 "article" to mean newspaper articles, Reader's Digest
12 articles, and things like that.
13 Did you understand my question that way?
14 MR. SUAREZ:
15 THE WITNESS:
Objection.
Form.
By "articles," I assumed that you
16 meant articles from the Los Angeles Times, you know, his
17 subscription to that or his subscription to the New York
18 Times or to the Reader's Digest, to all of the magazines
19 that he collected and read.
20 you were referring to, the ones that I have identified
21 on my list.

Q.
I assumed that that's what
Well, what evidence do you have that Mr. Soffer
ever subscribed to the New York Times?
A.
His first wife -- Lorraine Ellison I believe is

(212) 490-34301 her name -- said that she thought that they subscribed

3 Island.
4
Q.
And what about the Los Angeles Times?
What
5 evidence do you have that Mr. Soffer subscribed to the
6 Los Angeles Times?
7
A.
Again, I believe that Lorraine Ellison said that
8 they took the Los Angeles Times when they lived in that
9 area in the late 1950s up through 1965.
10
11
12
Q.
And what evidence do you have that Mr. Soffer
subscribed to any periodical?
A.
They're not as certain that it was a
13 subscription.
14 saying that they picked up magazines with some
15 frequency.
16 lived with his grandparents and his widowed mother as a
17 child that -- I believe it was Lorraine Ellison said she
18 recalls there being Reader's Digest in the house.
19 don't know if that was a subscription or not.
20
21
22
Q.
I remember one of the family members
Again going back to even his -- when he
But I
Do you have any evidence that Mr. Soffer, at any
time in his life, subscribed to any periodical?
A.
I don't know.
I just know that he read it, at
23 least according to his family, so I don't know if he had
24 a subscription to them or not.
25
Q.
Okay.
Any other newspapers, other than the L.A.
111

(212) 490-34301 Times or the New York Times that you have any evidence
2 that Mr. Soffer subscribed to that newspaper at any time
3 in his life?
4
A.
Again, I believe his wife Mrs. Soffer, the
5 second Mrs. Soffer, said that they got the Savannah
6 newspaper when they lived there.
7 them referred to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, but I'm
8 not as certain on that.
9 family was saying, that he was a regular subscriber

10 wherever he lived, although there must have been times
11 when they were moving houses that they didn't have a
12 subscription until they got settled.
13
Q.
And what is the evidence as to whether or not
14 Mr. Soffer was a regular subscriber to the Gainesville
15 paper?

The evidence would be his wife's
And she's testified, in your opinion, that
21 Mr. Soffer was a regular subscriber to The Gainesville
22 Sun?
23
A.
Again, there I'd have to look at it.
I'm not
24 sure if she said subscription or if that was one that
25 they picked up.
I think that that was a subscription,
112
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 but it may be that the Philadelphia paper was one that
2 they picked up.
3
4
5
I could establish that readily by going back and
looking at the depositions, if you like.
Q.
6
7
No.
That's okay.
Do you have on your reliance materials articles
out of the Philadelphia paper?
8 A. Yes, I do.
9 Q. Do you have articles on your reliance list out
10
of the New York Times?
11 A. Yes, I do.
12 Q. Do you have articles on your reliance list out
13
of the Savannah paper?
14 A. I believe I do.
15 Q. What about the St. Louis Post?
16 A. Yes, same thing.
17 Q. And what about The Gainesville Sun?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. Any other Florida papers?
20 A. Yes.
I think that there are a few from
21 scattered around, Tampa and Miami area.
22 some from Lakeland on here.
23 so there are -- and probably the Jacksonville Journal.
24
25
Q.
Right.
I think I have
Palm Beach Post is on here,
With regard to papers that weren't even
published in the town in which Mr. Soffer lived, what is

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
the reason for including those?
A.
Well, to give you an example, Mrs. Lucille
3 Soffer is from a large family and has five brothers who
4 all smoked and expressed, at different times, their
5 concern to Mr. Soffer about smoking.
6 pretty certain, lived in Lakeland.
7 in Lakeland.
8 the community of which he's a part is being informed
9 about these issues.

Maybe he still lives
So there's an example where the kind of --
So, you know, most people don't just live
11 hermetically sealed in one town, but they travel
12 elsewhere.
13 each and did travel back and forth for things.
14 think it's relevant to establish the larger climate of
15 public knowledge, which, of course, is my larger
16 question.
17
Q.
We know that the family kept in touch with

So I
So am I correct in assuming that you can
18 potentially put the New York Times, the Philadelphia
19 paper, the Gainesville, St. Louis, and Savannah papers
20 in Mr. Soffer's hands.
21 other papers in Mr. Soffer's hands:
22 Lakeland, Miami, Tampa.

(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 family, that he read anything he got his hands on.
2 I'm going to assume that if he was visiting family in
3 another part of Florida, that he would probably read
4 whatever paper that household had.
5
So
And, again, it's important to understand that
6 knowledge doesn't just come from the newspaper or from
7 any one source.

Q.
I'm just trying to find out what newspapers
13 you're going to come to Gainesville and tell the jury
14 Mr. Soffer read right now.
15 question.
16
That's a very simple
Are you suggesting to me that you can put any of
17 the papers from any of these other cities in
18 Mr. Soffer's hands ever?
19 MR. KOETHE:
20 THE WITNESS:

Is this the same question about
21 will I swear that he read a particular paper on a
22 particular day and saw a particular article?

(212) 490-34301
2
hands ever?
A.
In a -- logically, in a sense, because I don't
3 have photographic evidence that he ever picked up a
4 newspaper, I'm just going to assume that when he
5 traveled and when he was at home, based on what his
6 family said, that he read papers.
7 quite reasonable that if he did any traveling in
8 Florida, that he would have read other papers.
9
And so I think it's
But, again, that's not the purpose of why some
10 of these things are on the list.
11 prove that he read them.
12 people in Florida had a common awareness of the hazards
13 of smoking.

Q.
They're not there to
They're there to show that
I guess I deserved that one because I did ask
15 you why you put them on there earlier.
16 is a lot more simple right now.
17
18
Can you put The Tampa Tribune in Mr. Soffer's
hands, yes or no, ever?
19 MR. KOETHE:

Asked and answered.
I -- no.
I don't know that he
21 read it at any particular point.

Q.
How about the Lakeland paper?
Can you put it in
Mr. Soffer's hands ever?

116
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

best as I can.
Q.
8
9
Okay.
Right.
Okay.
Can you put The Miami Herald in
Mr. Soffer's hands ever?
A.
That same answer would apply as with Lakeland,
11 although I don't remember if they had any family down
12 that way.
13 to the larger society, not to Mr. Soffer particularly.
14
Q.
So The Miami Herald would be more a testament
And any other paper that I could reference to
15 you -- see, I don't have your reliance list.
16 what you've told me you consider to be relevant
17 newspaper articles, there could be 150 newspapers in
18 that reliance list.
19
Based upon
Would the answer be the same with respect to any
20 other paper, that you do not have any evidence of --
21 that Mr. Soffer subscribed to it or even picked it up
22 from time to time?
23 MR. KOETHE:
24 THE WITNESS:
25
Object to form.
So the question is -- can you just
restate the precise question for me?
I'd be very
117
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 grateful.
2 BY MR. WARRINER:
3
Q.
4
Yes, ma'am.
The precise question is as follows:
You've told
5 me specifically of some newspapers around the state of
6 Florida that are published in cities that Mr. Soffer
7 does not live in and that you have no evidence of the
8 fact that he ever subscribed to that paper or picked it
9 up from time to time according to his wife or his
10
daughters or his family.
Okay?
11 My question to you is, For those papers that you
12 might have on your reliance list, of which I don't know,
13 that are from cities outside of which Mr. Soffer lived
14 and for which you have no evidence that he subscribed to
15 them, would your answer be the same:
16 that paper in Mr. Soffer's hand ever?
17 MR. SUAREZ:
18 THE WITNESS:
Objection.
You cannot put
Form.
I think that it's fair to say that
19 some of these papers I don't expect that he personally
20 read.
21 read them.
22 personally read the Jacksonville Journal.

24
25
Q.
I think that people he knew would likely have
But I don't have any reason to think that he
Okay.
Fair enough.
Would that answer apply to all newspapers that
118
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 we have not previously discussed that he -- you have
2 some evidence of that he subscribed to them or he lived
3 in that city or he picked it up from time to time,
4 according to testimony in the case?
5 MR. SUAREZ:
6 THE WITNESS:
Form.
Well, I hate to make a statement
7 that's absolutely categorical in relation to that.
8 There are certainly some papers that I put on there that
9 I was using to establish the state of knowledge in
10 Florida that would affect the people he came into
11 contact with, the community that surrounded him, the
12 context in which he lived, historically.
13 possible that some of those he might have traveled to
14 that town, and I would look at it and say, Yeah, that's
15 one I think he could have personally picked up.
16
So it's
But you're quite right that there are some that
17 are on there not because I think he picked it up and
18 read it, but because it's one of those things that
19 establishes knowledge in Florida.
20 BY MR. WARRINER:
21
22
23
Q.
Okay.
We've got a bunch of papers in Florida
you have already identified.
Other than L.A., Savannah, Philly or St. Louis,

Yeah.
I think most the evidence about his
military career seems -- seems sketchy.
Q.
Okay.
So can you put the Dallas paper in
Mr. Soffer's hands ever?
A.
No, I can't.
But, for example, some of those
15 articles would have been about -- about Wichita Falls,
16 for example, events in Wichita Falls.
17 newspaper, I don't think he read the article
18 necessarily.
19 he was living in, I think it still provides useful
20 information for us about his knowledge about the harms
21 of smoking.

A.
I don't know.
I don't know that.
I think it's
incredibly likely that he did, but I don't know it.
Q.
And the basis for your statement, just so I'm
7 certain, you live in California and you're saying that
8 it would be incredibly unlikely that Mr. Soffer, what,
9 40 years ago when he lived on Long Island, did not ever
10
read the Long Island Express.

19 he did not read the Long Island Express.
20 Is that what you just said?
21 MR. SUAREZ:
22 THE WITNESS:
Objection.
Misstates testimony.
I think it's unlikely that he
23 could have lived on Long Island for, I think, a few
24 years and not occasionally have read that newspaper,

I'll object to form.
A practice session for testifying.
BY MR. WARRINER:
Q.
Right.
Where you get together with the lawyer
who retained you and you go over your prospective
10 testimony and people ask you sort of mock questions,
11 kind of like a practice session.
12
A.
Well, I've sat in sessions where we've discussed
13 my findings and talked about how -- you know, how you
14 would describe the findings and that kind of thing.
15 in that sense, yes.
16
Q.
Okay.
So
Other than just generally talking about
17 it, has the lawyer who -- lawyer or lawyers who retained
18 you ever asked you questions to sort of simulate what
19 the questions might be coming from the smoker's lawyer?
20 MR. KOETHE:
21 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Well, people have said, yes, Now,
22 if I asked you what did Mr. Soffer know, what would your
23 answer be?
24 I think that's so that they can anticipate what my
25 findings are.
And so I would tell them what it would be.

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

2
BY MR. WARRINER:
Q.
Right.
I'm talking about something a little
3 more formal where the lawyer will actually ask you a
4 series of questions in a role-playing fashion, sort of
5 like pretending like you were in court and how you would
6 answer certain questions.
7 You ever done that?
8 MR. KOETHE:
9 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Well, I think I've answered that.
10 It's similar to being deposed.

12 or, What did -- what do the polls suggest? and that kind
13 of thing.
14 are, you know, looking at your findings and stating them
15 and restating them.

Q.
It's similar to being in
So in that sense, it's a session where you
The lawyer who's retained you ever videotaped
that session?
19 A. Not that I'm aware of.
20 Q. Have you ever practiced your testimony on
21
videotape and had it played back to you?
22 A. No.
23 Q. How many hours have you worked on the Soffer
24
25
case to date?
A.
That's a little hard to estimate.
Of course,
124
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 this month I've been working on it fairly consistently.
2 I'm guessing here a little bit maybe 20 hours or
3 something this month.
4 spent a fair amount of time working on it too.
5 bring a bill, so that would tell me the number of hours,
6 if I can just shuffle through this for just a minute and
7 get it.
And last month I sat down and
I did
8 It looks to me, last month I spent about
9 22 hours, something like that, last month on it.
Before
10 that I had -- most of the time I'd spent was more casual
11 in the sense of phone conversations, for which I don't
12 always bill because I'm -- you know, I'm just having a
13 phone conversation that you catch when you're in the
14 middle of something else.
15 And then some of the time, of course, I've just
16 been relying on my general Florida research, which I've
17 been doing for three years.
18 specific to Mr. Soffer.
19 this case.
20 Q.
Right.
So some of that wasn't

I'm
going to guess maybe 40 or 50 hours.

125
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
A.
Well, that would be total where I billed it
2 solely to the Soffer case.
3 many, many hours prior to that where I was learning
4 these sorts of things, for example, reading The
5 Gainesville Sun or -- which I was also reading for
6 another case at another point, and other newspapers or
7 even like the Los Angeles Times, which I read in its
8 entirety for the Boeken case, but I'm now using that
9 information in the Soffer case.
That would not include the
So it would not be
10 billed to Soffer because I had already done the work
11 several years ago.
12
Q.

14
15
Understood.
On Florida-specific matters, though, would those
generally be classified as Engle-related matters?
A.
I suspect so.
I think that that's around the
16 same time that I was brought in to work on Florida
17 cases.
18 Q.
19
20
Okay.
So what would we have to do to tally up
your Florida-related time?
A.
We would go back to 2007, which is when I
21 started working in Florida, and that would be the
22 Florida-specific hours, and we could, you know, tally up
23 the bills and the hours associated with them to come up
24 with a total.
25
Q.
And that would be the three cases that you've
126
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 given depositions in plus the six or seven other ones
2 that you said you've been working on?
3 A. Yes, that's right.
4 Q. Do you have in your possession any of your own
5
6
7
8
9
10
testimony transcripts?
A.
I have in my possession the depositions today
that I gave in the Patterson and Evers cases.
Q.
Okay.
And do you maintain possession yourself
of any other trial testimony or deposition testimony
that you have given?
11 A. Yes, I do.
12 Q. Do you have your Boeken deposition?
13 A. I have it in my office but not here.
14 Q. Do you have your Boeken trial testimony?
15 A. Yes, I do.

A.
Do you maintain
As best I recall, I should have copies of those.
I just haven't looked at them in several years.
Q.
Have you been provided the deposition or trial
testimony of any other historians?
A.
No.
I think I saw a deposition or two, but I
24 don't think I've seen any trial testimony, that I
25 recall.

I just don't recall
any trial -- any trial transcripts at all from others.
Q.
Who do you have deposition testimony from that
is, you know, not your own.
A.
I have a deposition of Jeff Norell and I think
that that's it.
8 Q. When was that given?
9 A. It may be that I also have a deposition from
10
11
12
Michael Schaller.
Q.
And Norell's deposition was given when, or taken
when --
13 A. I'm --
14 Q. -- the one that you have the transcript for?
15 A. I'm sorry.
16 Q. Was it a Florida case or pre-Florida?
17 A. It was a Florida case.
18 Q. Do you know who took the deposition?
19 A. I think that that one was your colleague
20 Mr. Sales.
21
22
I don't recall the date of it.
THE WITNESS:
By the way, would it be all right
with you if we took a break in a minute?
23 MR. WARRINER:
24 THE WITNESS:
25 question first or --
Absolutely.
Okay.
Sure.
You want to ask me a

No.
BY MR. WARRINER:
Q.
Dr. Hoffman, attached or as part of the notice
5 of deposition that we sent pursuant to which the
6 deposition's being taken today, there was a list of
7 items that you were requested to bring with you to the
8 deposition.
9
Were you provided with that?
10 A. Yes, I was.
11 Q. Good.
12
Let's go through it real quickly.
MR. WARRINER:
And if the court reporter needs
13 to mark something, just holler, because I can't see what
14 you're doing.
15 mark instead of try to type and mark at the same time.
16 BY MR. WARRINER:
17
Q.
And I'll try to stop talking so you can
The first request on there was for any and all
18 data, documents, papers, photographs, filing -- I don't
19 know what that means -- videotapes, memorandum, or other
20 writings prepared by you pursuant to your employment in
21 this case.
22
Did you review that request, No. 1?
23 A. Yes, I did.
24 Q. And what do you have with you today that would
25
qualify as falling under that request?
129
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
A.
I have the list that we've been discussing, the
2 reliance list, and then I have some discs that --
3 CD-type discs that have that information on it.
4 have that to provide to you.
5
6
Q.
Okay.
And the list, is it -- that's a paper
list?
7 A. Yes, it is.
8 Q. And tell me what it sort of looks like.
9
10
11
12
13
So I
just Item 1 through Item 6,000?
Is it
Is there any
description of the document?
A.
Yes.
There's both things.
There's a numerical, you know, order from 1 to
5,600-something.
14 Then associated with each document is a date
15 that it was approximately created, or even precisely
16 created.
17
Then there's a summary of the document, which is
18 essentially a title that is fairly good at describing
19 what it is or at least what it was called.
20 And then there's an image number.
21 number allows you to readily call up any of these
22 documents from the discs, because once you put the disc
23 in your computer, as you probably know, usually a
24 dialogue box pops up.
25 you can type in this image number, and then that item
And the image
And it will say "search for," and
130
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
will come up right away.
Q.
Okay.
Anything else that you brought with you
3 today that would qualify under No. 1, which would be a
4 paper list and discs of images?
5
A.
No.
6 By the way, I'm -- I -- your numbers, they seem
7 to overlap so much, and there was such a long list that
8 I'm not sure which things fall under Nos. 1, 2, 4, you
9 know, through 20, whatever.
So I have a lot of other
10 things I did bring.
11 this.
12 numerically, or do you want me to tell you the things I
13 brought?
14
I'm not sure how you want me to do
Should we just try to go through the list
MR. WARRINER:
Why don't we do this.
Let's mark
15 the deposition notice with the duces tecum designation
16 as Plaintiff's Exhibit 1 to the deposition.
17 speed's sake, if somebody has a pen and a copy of that
18 there, they can just write 1 on it, and we'll mark
19 later.
20 Is that okay with everybody?
21 THE WITNESS:
22
So this is my copy of that request
by your office, and we'll mark that No. 1.
23 (Exhibit 1 marked)
24 THE WITNESS:
25
And for
All right.
I think we've done
that.

2
BY MR. WARRINER:
Q.
And then why don't we mark as Plaintiff's
3 Exhibit 2, or Exhibit 2, the paper list and CDs that you
4 brought with you.
5
6
How many CDs are there?
A.
There are three CDs.
So we will mark those
7 CDs -- do they each need a number, or are they
8 collectively one number?
9 Q. Do you have any other CDs with you today?
10 A. No, just those three.
11 Q. If we could keep them together and mark them as
12
13
14
Plaintiff's Exhibit 2, that would be great.
A.
And we'll mark it as 2 along with the written
list to which they correspond?
15 Q. Yes.
16 A. Okay.
17
18
19
Sounds good.
(Exhibit 2 marked)
BY MR. WARRINER:
Q.
All right.
I would assume that you don't have
20 any photographs you've viewed and/or taken, but that may
21 not be the case.
22
Do you have any photographs?
23 A. No, I do not.
24 Q. Number 3 asks for copies of statements, written
25
or recorded, which you've examined.
132
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Have you examined or reviewed any statements
2 other than the depositions, which I would, you know,
3 loosely say qualify under that?
4
A.
Beyond the depositions, no, not beyond the
5 depositions and anything else that's not already on the
6 list we just talked about, the reliance list.
7
Q.
All right.
Number 4 asks for all published
8 professional standards or guidelines used or referred to
9 by you in formulating your opinions in connection with
10
this case.
11
12
13
Is there anything that you brought that would
qualify under No. 4?
A.
No.
Honestly, I did not bring anything.
And it
14 didn't make -- fully make sense to me because, of
15 course, ever since graduate school, I've been reading
16 things about the practice of my profession, and I just
17 didn't think you wanted me to bring all the books I've
18 read about how to do research in history.
19
Q.
Okay.
Number 5, all professional literature,
20 treatises, textbooks, or other publications which you
21 regard as authoritative in connection with this case?
22
23
A.
Same response.
MR. KOETHE:
Cal, this is Paul.
I just want to
24 note for the record that this entire production is being
25 made subject to the objections that our firm filed in
133
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 connection with the subpoena.
2 we've objected to and have advised Professor Hoffman
3 that she need not bring, for example, all of the
4 articles and things she's read since graduate school.
5
So some of these things
So I just wanted to be clear that we have
6 responded to this, and there is on file a set of
7 objections.
8
9
MR. WARRINER:
Well, if you could, for me, as we
go along in here and we identify something that has been
10 objected to and, as a result of a filed objection, the
11 witness has been told not to produce documents, then
12 please so note.
13
MR. KOETHE:
Okay.
Well, I probably overstated
14 that, because I don't think we've told the witness not
15 to bring anything in particular.
16 what she needs to bring.
17 to 1, 2 -- 1 and 2, for example, we have indicated that
18 she would bring her reliance list and the materials and
19 her notes relating to this case.
20
We've told the witness
And, for example, in response
And that is what we've asked her to bring, so --
21 and to the extent that the request goes beyond that --
22 and some of these are very broad and overlapping --
23 we've objected.
24 2.
25 reliance materials.
And so that would be the case for 1 and
She's brought the reliance list, her notes, and
134
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
I forget where -- where were we up to?
Were we
up to --
3
MR. WARRINER:
Well, let's go back to No. 1,
4 then, because that -- you know, objections and, you
5 know, suggestions that they're broad give me a lot of
6 heartburn because that allows people to self-select what
7 they think they should bring to a deposition, as opposed
8 to what's being requested.
9
Number 1 says, "any and all data, documents,
10 paper, photographs, filing" -- which I'll stipulate I
11 have no idea what that means -- "videotapes, memorandum,
12 or other writings prepared by you pursuant to your
13 employment in this case."
14
To me, that's not very broad.
And so I would
15 like a statement on the record that what has been
16 brought is all that exists with regard to No. 1.
17 would also like you to so designate -- if things have
18 been created or prepared by her pursuant to her
19 employment in this case that she has not brought today,
20 I need to know what they are.
21
THE WITNESS:
22 a question?
23 BY MR. WARRINER:
24
25
Q.
I'm sorry, sir.
Or I
Are you asking me
Is that a question for me?
You and counsel, because it sounds like you both
participated in this exercise.
135
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
A.
Well, I can tell you that I prepared a very long
2 list, pursuant to this case, that I feel is adequate to
3 explain my research in the case and will give you plenty
4 of things to look at and me plenty of things to use as
5 demonstratives.
6 very responsive to it.
7 however, that there aren't other things I've learned
8 over the years of being a historian that might come up,
9 that you yourself might even ask me about having to do
So I think it's actually -- I've been
I just can't swear to you,
10 with the history of the period or something else that I
11 would not have prepared specifically for this case but
12 that I might end up employing in the case.
13
14
Is that clear?
Q.
No, it's not clear at all, because No. 1 asks
15 for stuff that you prepared pursuant to your employment
16 in this case.
17 doesn't talk about what you've read since graduate
18 school.
19 you have prepared pursuant to your employment in this
20 case, for Soffer.
21 prepared pursuant to your employment in Soffer, then
22 that's what this is asking for, not a self-selection by
23 you or the attorneys as to what you do or don't want to
24 bring.
25
It doesn't talk about other cases.
I doesn't talk about any of that stuff.
It
What
If you have any documents that you
So that's my question:
Do I have everything in
136
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 front of you there today marked as Exhibit 2 to the
2 deposition that would qualify under that?
3
4
5
A.
I think so, yes.
Everything I've prepared
specifically for this case, I have brought.
Q.
6
Great.
All right.
I think you said you brought some
7 notes. 8 A. That's right.
9 Q. Okay.
And we talked about those earlier.
10 have two kinds of notes.
11 notes and then case-general notes.
12
You have deposition-specific
Would that be a fair characterization?
13 A. Yes, I think that's right.
14 Q. And how many pages comprise each?
15 A. All right.
16
19
Looks like 13 that are the deposition notes.
Q.
22
23
24
25
Okay.
Why don't we -- you didn't happen to
bring an extra copy of those.
20
21
Let me -- I'm going to add them up
real quickly.
17
18
You
Is that your original copy?
A.
No.
I made a copy for you.
That's an extra
one.
MR. WARRINER:
Good.
Why don't we get those
marked as the next numbered exhibit.
MR. SUAREZ:
Which, by my count, would be 3.
137
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 MR. WARRINER:
2 (Exhibit 3 marked)
3
That sounds right.
BY MR. WARRINER:
4
Q.
And then the other set of notes that you have,
5 could you tell me how many pages of notes those are?
6 And let's mark those as 4.
7
A.
8
9
Just a moment.
I have seven pages on that, and we'll mark those
as No. 4.
10
Q.
11
12
Yes.
Perfect.
(Exhibit 4 marked)
BY MR. WARRINER:
13
Q.
And then No. 2, there were some pictures in this
14 case that were produced by us to the defendants.
15 they provide those to you?
16 photograph-type pictures.
17 A. No.
18 Q. Okay.
Did
These would be family
I did not see any of those.
Can you think of anything else that you
19 have -- photographs that you have viewed and/or taken in
20 connection with this case?
21 A. No.
22 Q. All right.
I -- I can't think of anything.
And I think we already talked about
23 3.
24 that could qualify here would be the actual depositions.
25
The only thing that you have reviewed in this case
You don't have any nonsworn statements?
138
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
A.
I'm sorry.
Could you -- because we've marked it
2 as an exhibit now, I can't follow along in this list
3 very well.
4 statement -- yes, nothing other than the depositions,
5 except for -- what do they call -- the interrogatories,
6 the verified worksheet, that kind of thing, does that
7 count?
8 Q.
That does not really count, no.
9 A.
Okay.
10
11
Let's see.
No.
Number 3 is copies of all
Then, other than that, no, it's just
the depositions.
Q.
From time to time people -- lawyers will send
12 investigators out to take statements from witnesses, and
13 then those people are not deposed.
14 can be given to experts to look at.
15
You don't have anything like that, do you?
16 A. No, I do not.
17 Q. Skip 4.
18
19
But sometimes they
Skip 5.
How about No. 6?
A.
No.
I don't have anything for that.
It says
20 published within the past three years, and I think -- I
21 mentioned that textbook I did, Major Problems In
22 American History, and I think that falls just outside
23 the three years.
24 given any speeches which affect my opinion in this case
25 either.
So I didn't bring it, and I have not
139
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
Okay.
Number 7, published articles written by
2 others on which you have relied that affect your opinion
3 in this case.
4
A.
That would be included under No. 1 because, of
5 course, there are a lot of articles upon which I'm
6 relying for information in the case, and they would all
7 be on that list of 5,000-plus articles and documents.
8 Q. Okay.
9 A. Yes.
And then No. 8, other transcripts?
Those are the -- as I understand it, what
10 I needed to bring there were the two depositions I gave
11 last year.
12 Q.
13
And so I brought those with me as well.
Okay.
I don't need to mark those.
I have
copies of those.
14 A. Okay.
15 Q. Number 9, reports, have you prepared any
16
17
reports?
A.
No reports.
But as we talked about, I have a
18 kind of a summary.
19 didn't we?
20 Q. The notes?
21 A. Yeah, we already did that.
22 No. 4. 23 Q. Okay.
24 A. No.
25 Q. 11, we already have your notes?
But I think we already got that,
That was our Exhibit
So there's nothing in addition to Exhibit No. 4.
How about No. 10?
140
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Correct.
2 Q. 12, would that be included in one?
3 A. Yes, I think so.
4 Q. 13 is your billing information.
5
that as Plaintiff's Exhibit 5.
6
A.
Hold on.
Let me pull that out.
7 There we go, No. 5.

9
And let's mark
BY MR. WARRINER:
10
Q.
Let's go to No. 16.
Do you have any
11 correspondence between you, your office, or counsel for
12 the defendants?
13 A. Counsel -- yes, I do have two e-mails.
14 Q. Okay.
15
6.
16
17
18
Would you do me a favor and mark those as

Q.
Number 17 looks for correspondence between you
19 and people other than the attorneys who retained you in
20 this case.
21
22
Have you written or received any correspondence
from anybody else about this case?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. And who is that from or to?
25 A. It is from a woman named Katherine Schouten, who
I do have one other e-mail.

2 Q. What is History Works?
3 A. It's a public history consulting business.
4 Q. What do they do?
5 A. Well, public historians will find documents for
6 you, or sometimes they can even write histories for
7 corporations and that kind of thing.
8 asked her if she could help me find some textbooks, and
9 the e-mail pertains to her search for a couple of
10 textbooks.
11 Q.
12
Okay.
In this case I
It's just one from her to you or one from
you to her?
13 A. It's just one from her to me.
14 Q. Does it show the initiating e-mail from you to
15
16
17
her with the request?
A.
No, because there wasn't an initiating e-mail.
I just called and left a message for her on her phone.
18 Q. And was she successful in finding the text?
19 A. She said that she couldn't get them immediately
20
but that she could get them in a couple of days.
21 Q. And when was that request made?
22 A. That was -- April 20 is the date of her e-mail.
23 So I think that's last week.
24 of this week?

Okay.
Number 20, charts, diagrams, overlays,
5 graphs, photographic enlargements, or other
6 demonstrative aids -- which, I guess, in 2010, would
7 include PowerPoint presentations -- prepared or to be
8 used by you at trial or in aid of your opinions and/or
9 testimony, do you have anything like that?
10 A. Oh, I haven't prepared anything like that yet.
11 Q. I've already got a copy of your CV.
12 A. Okay.
13 Q. I already asked you to approximate, during the
14 deposition, for me the number of hours you have spent in
15 the Florida cases over the past couple years, and you
16 could not do that.
17
18
19
Do you have any documentation that you brought
with you today that would assist us?
A.
I believe we provided that at some point, and my
20 approximation was 10 percent of my professional time.
21 think, actually, we disclosed that originally.
22 sure I'm using the correct legalese there.
23 believe I've already answered that question.
24 look up the amount of income earned over the past three
25 years, so I have that figure.
I
I'm not
But I
And I did
143
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
And is that income that you looked up over the
2 past three years all solely related to work for this
3 particular law firm that retained you?
4
5
6
A.
Yes, because I was only retained by this one law
firm.
Q.
And do you have a document there that you could
7 attach as an exhibit that reflects those hours and that
8 amount of billing?
9
A.
No.
I'm sorry.
I didn't interpret your list
10 here meaning that I should bring the supporting data.
11 thought you just wanted to know the information.
I
12 Q. Okay.
13 A. It's approximately $250,000 over the past three
14 years. 15 Q.
16
And I think we cleared this up earlier, but let
me just make sure I understand this.
17
18
Tell me the information, then.
That's all Florida-related work in the past
three years?
19 A. No.
20 Q. Okay.
21 A. I was also working on a case in New York for a

What else would that include?

Q.
I assume you didn't give a deposition in that

testified in.
3
And that's the end of that list.
Did you bring anything else with you?
4 A. No.
5 Q. Okay.
I think that that's it.
All right.
I want to go back.
6 made a note of this, so I have to turn pages.
7 one second.
8
9
Great.
And I
Hold on
You said that you -- the question that was posed
that you were attempting to answer in performing the
10 research you did in this case was, What did the public
11 know, and when did they know it, about various health
12 hazards associated with smoking cigarettes?
13
14
15
16
Is that a fair statement?
A.
Yes.
I think that accurately restates what I
said.
Q.
And when you went and you started accumulating
17 these documents that we could look at on your reliance
18 list, was part of your search to reach out and identify
19 what statements had been made in the public realm by the
20 tobacco industry with regard to issues relating to
21 smoking and health?

Q.
Okay.
And in terms of looking at those
3 statements, would you consider the search that you made
4 for industry statements with regard to issues of smoking
5 and health to be as comprehensive as the search you made
6 for other publicly-available information about those
7 issues?

I'll be happy to
Yes.
Do you feel like, now having worked on this
16 issue for ten years, that you have performed an
17 exhaustive search to identify all statements in the
18 public realm that were made by tobacco companies or
19 representatives of tobacco companies with regard to the
20 issues of smoking and health?
21 MR. KOETHE:
22 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I can say that they were not --
23 that was not the focus of my research.
24 looking at was the public -- you know, the public
25 domain, so to speak.

A.
Honestly, that's -- that's all I recall off the
3 top.
4 they certainly weren't in textbooks, for example, and
5 they weren't in statements by the American Cancer
6 Society, which would be in there.
7 movies either, so I would say it's pretty much -- my

I might have seen something else, but that's --

2 smoking and lung cancer from 1955?
3 A. Yes, I've seen that.
4 Q. Are you aware of the industry's efforts to
5
influence the content of that program?
6 MR. KOETHE:
7 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
No, I'm not aware of what those
8 efforts might have been.
9 BY MR. WARRINER:
10
Q.
I just don't recall that.
So as you sit here today, you cannot say one way
11 or the other how successful the industry's efforts, if
12 any, to influence the content of that program were?
13 MR. KOETHE:
14 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
All I can say is that program was
15 one of many that told viewers that the product was a
16 dangerous one and that that should be used with great
17 caution and that it had been linked to the rapid
18 increase in the incidence of lung cancer.
19 course, Mr. Murrow tragically died of that disease
20 himself a few years later, so --
And, of
21 And, by the way, that's also something that was
22 remarked upon by -- I think it was Lorraine Ellison who
23 said she recalls watching Edward R. Murrow and then
24 remembered that he died of lung cancer.

So that's -- I

Right.
And do you know what Hill & Knowlton did
for the tobacco industry?
A.
Well, I believe, as a public relations firm,
19 that they, as they did with all their clients, probably
20 provided advice on how to publicize the product, how to
21 put it out there to the public.

What is your understanding of what the cigarette

170
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
THE WITNESS:
I saw a variety of statements.
2 For example, we could begin in 1954 with the Frank
3 Statement where they said they thought their product was
4 not injurious, but they also said that very serious
5 charges had been leveled, and therefore, it was very
6 important to take those charges seriously, which I think
7 in the process of probably doing so, that they
8 encouraged some people to think that they had better
9 take it seriously as well because the industry, of
10 course, was saying that they were serious charges.
11
And then, of course, as you certainly know,
12 there were statements on the packages from 1966 forward
13 which said that the products were dangerous.
14 sense it seems to me that in that way they were
15 acknowledging the danger of it by putting the hazard
16 label on it.

What was their public position, from the early
22 '50s through the early 1990s, as to whether or not it
23 had been proven that cigarettes cause lung cancer?
24 MR. KOETHE: Object to form.
25 THE WITNESS: Well -- okay.
It seems to me that
171
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 something you put on the side of the package is a public
2 statement about the injury that's potential from smoking
3 cigarettes.
4
On the matter of proven, I think that -- again,
5 that that evolved somewhat over time.
6 were, of course, scientists as well as people in the
7 industry who were questioning whether or not statistical
8 evidence was sufficient to constitute biological proof.
9 And then, of course, at some point the Surgeon General
In the '50s there
10 said, We don't really need biological proof because the
11 statistical proof is adequate.
12
So, you know, to me, their position changed
13 somewhat over time.
14 certainly times where they were saying that more proof
15 was needed, and they were probably referring to that
16 kind of biological proof that the Surgeon General had
17 said by this point wasn't necessary.

BY MR. WARRINER:
Q.
Dr. Hoffman, what was R.J. Reynolds' public
8 position as to whether cigarettes caused cancer, say,
9 from the 1950s up to 1984 when the warning -- the
10 rotating warning specifically referencing cancer went on
11 the pack?
12 MR. KOETHE:
13 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
I don't know if they had one
14 public stand on it or if there was a formal policy.
15 saw references at different times to representatives of
16 the company who said they thought that more research was
17 needed.
I never saw them say there was no basis for the
18 claims.
But, you know, they did, from time to time, say
19 that more research would be -- was warranted.

At any time from 1950 to 1984, did R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Company agree that smoking caused lung cancer?

I don't know.

you exactly what I recall, which is that they said that
174
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 they were serious charges but that more research was
2 needed to pin down the biological proof of, you know,
3 where the connection was.
4 statements I saw on several occasions.
5
Q.
So those are the kind of
From all of the research you've done, can you

8 they agreed that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?
9

11
A.
No.
I don't think I could point to a statement
where they categorically state that.
Q.
And would the same be for Philip Morris tobacco
12 company?

14 from 1950 until 1984, when the rotating warning went on

I did not see public statements
Again, as I said, often what happened is that,
with less and less frequency, anything they said wasn't

11 seeing is tens of thousands of articles talking about
12 the harm and, on very, very rare and infrequent
13 occasions, a statement by the tobacco companies.
14 don't recall one from any company where they said, We

I believe that they took the same

Well, for example, in the 1990
16 hearings before Congress, that was the wording that they

19 addictive, because scientists had, of course, debated
20 that for several decades.
21 recall them, as I said, weighing in saying it's not

How many?
approximately 20, I'd say, 15 or 20.
Q.
On the reliance materials, is the entire

A.
No.
We've generally referenced -- well, the
11 entire book would be listed, so you would have all the
12 publication data.

14 they called "narcotics," and tobacco was first -- often

18 you earlier about -- well, let me ask you this question
19 first:
20 transcript?
21
A.
Have you reviewed Mr. Soffer's school
No.
I have not been able to get any records on
22 his schooling, unfortunately.
23 wife, or at least his first wife tells us, that he
24 graduated from West Philadelphia High School and that he
25 grew up in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, you know,
I know from his first
184

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

(212) 490-34301 township or whatever it's called, and therefore, he
2 would have been under that district's, you know, care.
3
4
5
Q.
Do you know whether or not Mr. Soffer ever went
to private school?
A.
I've not heard any testimony or seen any
6 testimony to that effect, at least not at the elementary
7 and secondary levels.
8
9
Q.
With regard to the textbooks that are on this
list, did I hear you right where you said there was a
10 list of potential texts that could have been used, and
11 then the schools were allowed to select which ones they
12 wanted to use?
13
A.
Well, yes.
For example, in high school, there
14 was only one textbook that they were allowed to use.
15 But in, you know, fifth grade, let's say, as an example,
16 there might have been just two textbooks to select from.
17 I think there was one grade where there might have been
18 three and maybe even one grade where there were four
19 textbooks that the teachers could choose from among.
20 So, in this case, certainly in the high school, we know
21 there was only one textbook.
22 think it's safe to assume that the teachers would have
23 used those books, because it's a very finite number and
24 they were the only ones allowed.
25
Q.
But in the other grades, I
And what subject were these books for?
185
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

A.
Most of these are -- what are they called --
2 health education, which was a very important
3 legally-mandated component of their elementary and
4 secondary education.
5
In addition to this, by the way, there would
6 have undoubtedly have been science books in which this
7 subject also came up, but I did not have endless amounts
8 of time, so I focused on the health education portion of
9 it.
But I do know from other documents that they
10 endeavored to wrap lessons about the cost and hazards of
11 cigarette use into other lessons as well, like science
12 and mathematics.
13 health education.
14
Q.
Okay.
So this, however, purely looks at
Tell me what your evidence of that last
15 statement is and how you knew what was going on in the
16 Philadelphia school system in the 1940s.
17
A.
From reports that were drawn up by the
18 Philadelphia school system.
19 published, fortunately for us, their curricular guides
20 for teachers.
21
So the board of education
By the way, in addition to those, there were
22 also guides at the state level which had information,
23 and I've also included that in my reliance list.
24
25
Q.
Guides, I understand that.
What evidence do you have that the books were
186
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
actually used?
A.
I only know that they were legally mandated.
So
3 it's possible that some of the teachers broke the law
4 and did not teach these subjects.
5 that's not very likely that they would have done that in
6 every grade where he was supposed to learn this
7 information.
8
9
10
11
Q.
But I think that
And what evidence do you have of the fact that
they wrapped this topic into other classes, like
science, for example?
A.
Well, I'd have to go back to my documents to
12 find the citations for you because I'm afraid I'm not
13 remembering them off the top.
14 statewide guidelines they typically will say things like
15 that, like, you know, don't forget you can talk about
16 this in science too.
17
But in, for example, the
And also, by the way -- of course, this was in
18 Florida.
19 depositions these were in, whether it was the first
20 Mrs. Soffer or one of his daughters, but talking about
21 learning about it in science class.
22 that, by the way, I think it was Rochelle Soffer who
23 talked about a science class where they talked about the
24 harms of cigarettes.
25
But I -- well, maybe -- I'm forgetting which

The reason I ask is when I get your reliance
18 list, I'm trying to figure out if the book that you took
19 your excerpts from is 275 pages of a health text, what
20 else is in the book other than the ten pages or two
21 pages or one page that you copied and put on your
22 reliance list.
23
Do you follow what I'm saying?
24 A. Yes, I understand what you're saying.
25 Q. All right.
And so just exactly how -- because
190
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 you said there could be multiple sections in a book with
2 reference to tobacco or smoking.
3
So how did you go about looking through these 20
4 textbooks and selecting the portions that you chose to
5 give us?
6
A.
Well, of course, I didn't want to inundate you
7 or my filing system with the whole, let's say, 200-page
8 books, so I would select the portions that I thought
9 were relevant to Mr. Soffer's understanding about the
10 harms of cigarette smoking.
11 index, for example, in the book or -- and then you can
12 look up cigarettes or tobacco.
13
Often I would go to the
Typically things are listed under "tobacco" or
14 "nicotine," because there was a lot of references to
15 nicotine as a poison as well as a narcotic.
16 would be a good way to look things up.
17 sometimes, too, you go through -- again, you look at the
18 particular elements of the body that you -- that we
19 happen to know would be implicated in cigarette use,
20 like lungs or heart, and I would read through those
21 sections and just, you know, see if I could find places
22 where they had warned students not to use tobacco.
23
Q.
So that
And then
So when the books were requested by you, you
24 received the whole book, and then you reviewed the whole
25 book, and you chose sections to put on the reliance

3
A.
Is that correct?
Both occurred.
Or did you choose selections to
For example, sometimes I would
4 go to the library and find a book myself, and then I
5 would peruse it just in the way I described to you.
6
Other times, for example, these ones we were
7 just talking about, the two from 1945 or something,
8 those, I would ask them to just send me the relevant
9 portions of the book because, as I said, these often are
10 library books in Chicago, so I can't have them send me
11 the whole book.
12 to peruse this and adequately find every reference that
13 you can to tobacco or to nicotine or to cigarettes and
14 then send me those portions of the book.
15
Q.
So I would say, you know, I trust you
Similar to the question I asked earlier about
16 whether you could actually put the textbook into
17 Mr. Soffer's hand while he was a student in the 1940s in
18 Philadelphia, how can you tell me today, and
19 subsequently a jury, that even if the textbook was used
20 in a class in which Mr. Soffer was in, that the
21 particular portion that you have selected was identified
22 by the teacher as something that was required study?
23
A.
Well, let me give you another idea about how I
24 would deduce this information, since I don't have
25 photographic evidence or personal testimony from
192
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Mr. Soffer.
2 In 1955, and again '56 and '59, there were polls
3 of students, nationwide polls of high school students in
4 his age range.
5 students said they felt that there was a definite link
6 between smoking and lung cancer.
7 that. 8 signed onto information that was often contained in
9 textbooks and in the newspaper, it makes me believe that
And one year they said 94 percent of
1959, 97 percent said
So since such a large group of people repeated or
10 I'm correct in deducing that they read those sections,
11 or at least that those sections were presented to them
12 by their teachers.
13
Q.
So am I correct, in listening to your answer,
14 that your evidence of the fact that Mr. Soffer, in the
15 '40s in Philadelphia, was taught the sections of the
16 textbooks that you have excerpted and put on your
17 reliance list are polls from the later '50s that show
18 that a group of young people knew at a 97 percent rate
19 that cigarette smoking can cause lung cancer?
20 what you just told me?
21 MR. SUAREZ:
22 THE WITNESS:
Objection.
Is that
Form.
I told you that there are multiple
23 ways a historian uses to try to understand the past.
24 And so we look at a lot of different kinds of
25 information to corroborate the trends that we see.
And
193
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 so when I see there's a very strong trend for young
2 people to say that smoking, they believe, is linked to
3 lung cancer, then I look at these other documents as
4 well, for example, the textbooks that say similar things
5 or a Reader's Digest which was in Mr. Soffer's
6 grandparents' home which says similar things.

first five years.
A.
So you're

He -- I'm not aware of his father's smoking
13 behavior, and I didn't see anything in the depositions
14 which indicated whether his father smoked.
15 did smoke, but his grandparents did not.
16 raised by his -- in his grandparents' home by his mother
17 after she was widowed.
18
His mother
And he was
By the way, I believe at least in one of the
19 depositions it says she was widowed when he was 13 years
20 old, so I'm not quite sure what happened before that.
21 But I know at least two of his parents, in a sense, his
22 grandparents weren't smokers.
23
Q.
And in that home, do you have any evidence about
24 what newspapers might have been available, say, in
25 Mr. Soffer's first ten years, which would have been '35

to '45?
A.
Well, it seems to me, based on what we have to
3 go on, which are the depositions, that the Philadelphia
4 Inquirer would have likely been the newspaper they had.
5 Since he was so engrained in his habits as a newspaper
6 reader as an adult, I think it's likely that that
7 started early with him.
8
9
And, again, I believe Lorraine Ellison said she
thought that his grandparents had the newspaper.
Also,
10 of course, don't forget his first set of children lived
11 with the grandparent, with the grandmother, at least,
12 for a period of time.
13 referenced the Philadelphia Inquirer as being in the
14 home, along with Reader's Digest.
15
Q.
16
All right.
And, again, I think they
I'm just trying to understand.
Do you think there's evidence that the
17 Philadelphia Inquirer was in the grandparents' or the
18 mother's home from the time Mr. Soffer was born until he
19 was ten?
20
21
A.
No.
We don't have -- there are no depositions
from anyone who knew him in that period of time.
So --
22 Q. Without -- go ahead.
23 A. Well, I mean, his grandmother is no longer
24 living; and his mother is no longer living and; of
25 course, unfortunately, Mr. Soffer no longer living.
So
195
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 none of the people who would have been able to testify

4 what other people said, that it was there that they're
5 aware of when he was a young man and then later when he
6 was a father.

In 1940, Mr. Soffer would have been five years

Correct?
16 A. That's correct.
17 Q. Would you agree with me that in 1940, when

19 manufacturers knew more about the risks of smoking than
20 did five-year-old Mr. Soffer?

When Mr. Soffer was five in 1940, you would

8 MR. KOETHE:
9 THE WITNESS:

I'm not actually sure about that
10 in the sense that, again, I don't know what they knew.
11 I have not done research on the knowledge of the
12 industry itself.

10 You can't tell me that the manufacturers of cigarettes,

13 nicotine?
14 MR. SUAREZ:
15 THE WITNESS:
Objection.

The word "properties" is a very
16 broad term.
17 probably what everybody pretty much knew is that if you
18 were a smoker, you tended to have what they called
19 "nicotine fits" if you didn't get another cigarette.
20 And I don't know what, beyond that information, the
21 companies had.
22 known since Columbus, that it's habituating.
23
I think that what we're saying is that
To me, that's the property that's been
So I don't know that he knew that at five.
24 Maybe a more reasonable guess would have been six or

So I'm sorry.
Your testimony is that five-year-old Mr. --

Mr. Soffer's children, that he had

Are you including that in your answer?
20 A. Yes, five is a young age.

Other than the textbooks that we've already

I
20 think the textbooks are the strongest evidence I have
21 for that age group, which, of course, did tell him that
22 nicotine was a dangerous narcotic drug; that the habit
23 of smoking is easy to form and hard to break; that it
24 masters people, et cetera; that it does grave harm to

The other evidence I would look at

I make that inference because people

But I think it's -- for example, the Surgeon
General said that's one of the ways people hear about
10 smoking and about the harms of it, is through their
11 families.

couple of notes I've made here.
MR. KOETHE:
They may
Bear with me.
If that means it will be done
sooner, we will bear with you.
MR. WARRINER:
I tell you what, guys.
While I'm
looking at this, I need to take a real quick break.

BY MR. WARRINER:
Q.
Earlier, Dr. Hoffman, you said that the question
3 you attempted to ask with your research was what did the
4 public know and when did they know it.
5 part of the note I wrote down.

That's the only
What was the end of your statement?
Was it
about the relationship of smoking to the health risk?
A.
Right, about the health risk associated with
smoking and with tobacco, including such things as
10 addiction and lung cancer, heart disease, and other
11 injuries that were attendant upon it.
12
Q.
All right.
Who outlined that question with
13 respect to, you know, what your mission or assignment
14 was?
15 own, or was that a question that was posed to you by the
16 lawyers who represent the cigarette companies?
17
Is that something that you came up with on your
A.
That was a question I designed for myself.
I
18 mean, obviously it comes close to what they were asking
19 me to research.
20 different subject.
21 kinds of cases that they were getting, and I thought
22 that that was the question that made sense.
23
24
25
Q.
I wouldn't make up an entirely
But, you know, they outlined the
And have you answered that question for yourself
from your research?
A.
Yes, I have.
217
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Q. Tell us what the answer is to the question.
2 A. The answer to the question is that the evidence
3 shows that the public knew, from almost the beginning of
4 use of tobacco, that there were harms associated with
5 it.
6 addiction, and that -- subsequently to that, over the
7 course of the centuries, really, a number of other harms
8 are discovered, such as cancers primarily of the mouth
9 and the throat and the lips.
10
The earliest of these harms that was identified was
That was really in the,
you know, Middle Centuries, so to speak.
11
But then in the early 20th, people began
12 noticing an increase in the disease of lung cancer, and
13 the public became aware, fairly widely, and by the early
14 1950s, mid-1950s, that smoking had been linked very
15 directly with cancer of the lung.
16
17
So that would be my conclusion.
Q.
And Mr. Soffer up to -- I think your answer
18 included, you know, several hundred years before
19 Mr. Soffer was born.
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. Okay.
Correct?
I looked at the whole period.
And then I think the last date that you
22 mentioned was 1950, and so that would have been when
23 Mr. Soffer was 15 years old.
24
25
A.
Correct?
Well, actually, I was speaking of the mid-1950s,
which would have been when he was around 20 years old.
218
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

(212) 490-34301 Of course, I could bring this story up to the present,
2 but what I was trying to show was the essential answer,
3 which is that the public knew about these harms very
4 early and they knew about many of them; although some of
5 the harms became clearer over time, such as lung cancer,
6 which became clearer in the 1950s, before he started
7 smoking but also around the time he began.
8
9
Q.
So it's your testimony, from your research of
what was publicly-available knowledge, that by the
10 mid-1950s the link between smoking and lung cancer was
11 clear and undisputed?
12 MR. KOETHE: Object to form.
13 MR. SUAREZ: Objection.
14 THE WITNESS:
15
Form.
That's not what I said.
BY MR. WARRINER:
16 Q. What did you say?
17 A. I said by the mid-1950s it was widespread
18
19
knowledge that the two had been substantially linked.
Q.
And I think you said that the link between
20 tobacco and addiction had been established in the mid
21 centuries?
22 A.
That had been established way back, you know,
23 right around the time of Columbus.
24 was noted about tobacco as a harm associated with it was
25 that it caused addiction.
The first thing that
And, of course, as I said
219
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 before, there are many different ways people phrased
2 that at the time.
3 "enslaving" because, of course, this was the year --
4 centuries when slavery was public and legal and much
5 disapproved of.
6
Q.
A common phrase for that would be
Regardless of what it was called, people were
7 referring to the same reaction to the use of nicotine,
8 though.
Correct?
9 A. Yes, this property that it had.
10 Q. Right.
I mean, you can use the word
11 "habituation."
12 can use the word "hard to quit."
13 synonymous for what you're talking about had been
14 identified since the time of Columbus?
You can use the word "addiction."
You
All of those are
15 A. That's correct.
16 Q. What is the first time a warning ever went on a
17 pack of cigarettes suggesting that the use of the
18 product was habituating or addicting?
19
A.
Well, of course, when the Surgeon General said
20 these may injure your health, it was a broad statement.
21 And it wasn't until 1984 that it listed -- that the
22 Surgeon General listed some of the specific harms.
23 course, if you're a prudent individual, I presume you
24 don't want any harm to your health.
25 paying attention, you wouldn't use it even back then
Of

when it was less specific.
I'm not sure exactly when "addiction" went on
3 the packs.
4 to review my notes to remember specifically the warnings
5 from 1984 that began to rotate.
6
But it could have been 1984.
I would have
It may be, by the way, that it wasn't on there
7 because, as the American Medical Association said in
8 1964, we don't need a warning, because people know all
9 about these dangers already and they've known about them
10

12
for a good, long while.
