EXAMINATION
BY MR. HART:
Q. Would you please state your name for the record?
A. John Drobny.
Q. Mr. Drobny, my name is Jim Hart, and I think you understand that I represent the State of Texas, the plaintiff, in this lawsuit. Do you understand that?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. And looking at some information, it's my understanding that you have -- at least since 1994, have not had your deposition taken; is that a correct statement?
A. That is correct.
Q. Just to kind of refresh you a little bit, I will be asking you questions and
every question that I ask the court reporter will be taking down my question and then she will also be taking down your response to my question. It's important in that process that you and I don't talk over each other. So I'll try not to interrupt you while you're answering a question, if you'll try not to interrupt me before I complete my question.
Can we have that agreement?
A. Yes.
Q. And as we go through the day, it's going to be important for you to give me verbal answers. I don't think that will be a problem with you, but as opposed to a nod or a shake. Would you agree to give me verbal answers to my questions that I ask you?
A. Yes.
Q. Also, anytime you need a break, please let me know. I would just ask if there is a pending -- a question pending that we wait until we finish that question before we take our break.
Can we have that agreement?
A. Yes.
Q. If there is any question I ask you
today, Mr. Drobny, that you don't understand, and I'm sure there will be some that I get you confused on, please let me know and we'll restate the question because I want to make sure the answers that you give are answers to questions you understood.
Can we have that agreement?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Where do you currently live, Mr. Drobny?
A. [DELETED]
I
Q. And how long have you lived in
[DELETED]
A. Ten years.

[DELETED]	where did you live?
A. Various locations. Washington, D.C.; Austin, Texas; Chicago, Illinois.
Q. What years did you live in Austin,
Texas?
A.	1979 to 1985.
Q. Okay. I want to show you what I've marked as Drobny Exhibit Number 1. Do you recognize that exhibit, Mr. Drobny?
Q. Okay. And this is a letter dated August 6, 1997; is that correct?
A. That is correct. •
Q. And on the first page of Exhibit
1,	under Subsection B, it says that you have not authored in whole or in part books or articles or papers.
Is that a correct statement?
A. Yes.
Q. And then, under Subsection C of Page 1 of Exhibit 1, it says the following documents on which Mr. Drobny may or will rely to form the basis he intends to offer at trial, we believe these documents have been exchanged in discovery. And it lists 1 through 33.	.
It's my understanding that this is a list of documents that you intend to or will rely on in rendering the opinions in this case.
b
Is that a correct understanding? ^
A. Yes.	c
C*
MR. HART: And I only have <j one copy of this, but I've marked as Exhibit
2 -MS. CALLCOTT: That's fine.
MR. HART: -- what was attached to Exhibit 1 as Exhibit A.
Q. (By Mr. Hart) Is that also a list of documents that you intend to rely on in rendering the opinions in this case?	-
A.	Yes.
Q. And then there is Drobny Exhibit Number 3, which I believe also is another attachment to Exhibit 1, which is another list of documents. And is that a list of documents that you intend to rely on or will rely on in rendering your opinions in this case?
A. Yes.
Q. And then I was presented this morning with Drobny Exhibit Number 4. Is that -- could you tell me what Drobny Exhibit Number 4 is?
A. Are you asking me?
Q. Yes, sir.
A. Yes. It's a list of documents	i
t	I
I've reviewed from the library.	1

Q. Can you tell me which ones you believe you'll be relying upon to render the opinions in this case?
A. I really don't -- I think some of the more important ones are the ones at the start here. The Managed Care Manual. I'm not totally sure that I wouldn't rely on some others that are in here. There is a report by
Hurley in here, which is a major book.
Q. What number is that?
A. Number 12. Number 11. And Number 10. Those would be the major ones, but it doesn't mean I wouldn't look at some of the others.
Q. Okay. Mr. Drobny, you understand in relation to this testimony you had to provide a list of opinions also in this case?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. And in support of that list of opinions, you were to provide the plaintiffs in this lawsuit with a list of all documents that you intend to rely on that support those opinions.
A. Right.
Q. On Exhibit Number 4, are any of these documents documents that you're relying on to support the opinions that you have presented to me in written form?
A. I don't think I understand that question.	\

order --	J
Q. -- you understand you had to present to me a list of opinions that you intend to render in this case?

A. Uh-huh.
Q. -- are any of these documents documents that you're relying on to support the opinions in the opinion -MS. CALLCOTT: Statement.
Q. (By Mr. Hart) -- statement that you had to make?

show you what is marked as Drobny Exhibit Number 5. Do you recognize that document?

A. No.
Q. Okay. So if I understand you then, all the documents that you have reviewed but you are not relying upon are the remaining documents in Exhibit Number 4?
A. That's correct.
Q. Have you reviewed any deposition testimony related to this case?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Whose depositions have you reviewed?
A. Cathy Rossberg.
Q. Who else?
A. That is it.

A. Yes.
Q. Who did you talk with?
A. Cynthia Callcott.
Q. And what did you and Cynthia talk about in relationship to Exhibit Number 6?
A. Just basically what's laid out
here.
Q. Okay. Did somebody tell you that you needed to set forth your opinions?
A. Yes.
Q. And what did they tell you? I understand they talked to you that your opinions are going to relate to managed care?
A. Correct.
Q. Did somebody give you some
0 4
guidance as to what area of managed care your opinions needed to focus on?

A. Yes.
Q. Who did you express those opinions

A. Cindy.
Q. Were there other opinions that you expressed that aren't contained on the opinion statement?
A. No.
Q. Mr. Drobny, I want to start off and walk through these opinions with you.
A. Okay.
Q. And discuss them with you. And try to do it sentence by sentence, and each opinion contained within each sentence.
In Sentence Number 1 of Paragraph 1 you state, The State has missed out on the substantial savings and other benefits that
managed care offers by failing to implement managed care until 1993. And not by significantly expanding managed care throughout the state more expediently. I've kind of broken that sentence down into two parts. I want to focus on the first part of it.
What do you mean by "managed care" in Sentence Number 1?
A. I mean a system that is running -an overall system that is running Medicaid care.
Q. Okay. Doesn't Texas have in place an overall system that is running Medicaid?
A. They have it running Medicaid on a fee-for-service basis, not on a managed care basis.
Q. And tell me again, what is your definition of "managed care"?
A. A definition of "managed care" is an overall system of governance over the managed care.	m
Q. What is "managed care"?	g
A. "Managed care" is a method by	®
00
which you allocate care to patients.
Q. And describe to me the method under managed care, which services are	.
allocated to patients. How does managed care work?
A. All services are allocated to patients. Managed care under an HMO concept basically works where the State receives a capitated amount of money, the State pays a provider a capitated amount of money.
Q. What do you mean by "capitated amount of money"?
A. A certain amount agreed to, actuarially determined.
Q. A certain amount per individual or just a lump sum?
A. Per individual.
Q. And that would be an HMO concept of managed care?
A. That is correct.
Q. How many different concepts of managed care are there?
A. I really don't know.
Q. Are there others besides an HMO arrangement?
Q. List the other ones for me.
A. There is a -- what is called a prepaid health plan.
Q. And is there an acronym for that?
A. PHP.
Q. Okay. What is a prepaid health plan?	'
A. Prepaid health plan is a plan where the hospital is not capitated but the doctors are.
Q. So how does that work, then? The hospitals get a fee for service?
A. Complete fee for service.
Q. And the doctors would receive a capitated amount per patient?
A. Per patient, right.
Q. How is that different from an HMO?
A. An HMO, both units are capitated.
Q. Any other concept of managed care other than an HMO and a PHP that you're aware of?
A. PCCM.
t
►
Q. What is a PCCM, what does that	;
c
stand for?	<s
o
b /
Q. Tell me how that concept is set up.	.
A. That concept is set up with the hospital and the doctor both on fee for service. And the doctor gets a case management fee normally of $3 per member per month to manage the patient.	'
Q. So if I'm following you, then, it's a fee for service for the hospital?
A. Correct.
Q. It's a fee for service for the doctor?
A. Correct.
Q. But he also gets an administrative
fee?
A. Per patient per month.
Q. And when you say "per patient," is it per patient that you actually sees?
A. No.
Q. How do they figure that?
A. They assign patients to -patients to separate doctors, and he is that patient's PCP that's been assigned to him.
Q. So once you have your client list, let's say if you're a doctor and you have
under a PCCM your clientele, each month for your clientele you would get an administrative fee?
A. Correct. .	-
Q. Other than the HMO, the PHP and the PCCM, any other concepts of managed care that you're aware of?	'
A. No. Those are the primary ones.
Q. What's a PPO?
A. It's a preferred provider organization.
Q. Is that considered managed care?
A. Yes and no. It's not a true managed care. It depends on how it's set up.
A lot of PPOs are strictly fee for service.
Q. If you had -- your general definition of a PPO, if somebody asked you,
Mr. Drobny, what is a PPO, just tell me what your general definition would be to them.
A. It would be a limited number of doctors that you could see and hospitals that you could see.
Q. So if I'm an insured, and I'm part of a PPO, I would have a limited number of doctors and a limited number of hospitals
which I could use?
A. That's correct.
Q. And what is the benefit of a PPO?
A. Well, usually in a PPO those providers contract with the insurance company for reduced rate in exchange for more volume.
Q. Is it paid on a capitated reimbursement method, or is it paid fee for service?
A. It can be both ways, but it's normally fee for service.
Q. Okay. Other than the four that we've listed, any other types or concepts of managed care that you're aware of?
A. No.
Q. In Sentence Number 1 you state that, The State has missed out on the substantial savings and other benefits that managed care offers by failing to implement managed care until 1993. What substantial savings -- first of all, when you say "substantial savings," can you quantify that u for me in any way?	*
A. 5 to 15 percent.
A. Of the normal fee for service. Medicaid fee for service.
Q. So whatever the State normally pays in fee for service, you think that they could discount that 5 to 15 percent if they used managed care?
A. That's correct.
Q. Where are you coming up with that percentage 5 to 15 percent?
A. That's based on my experience of over 25 years in working with -- discussions with people in the Federal government. It's also in one of these documents. Which one I cannot remember right now.
Q. Okay. You believe there is a statement in one of the documents that says it would save 5 to 15 percent?
A. Normally saves 5 to 15 percent in different states.
Q. And the document you're relying upon, it speaks of a savings normally achieved in other states?
A. Correct.
Q. Are you aware of any study or analysis that has been performed to determine
the amount of savings managed care would create for the State of Texas under its Medicaid plan?
A. Yes.
Q. What study are you aware of?
A. Texas Perspective 1997. Medicaid Perspective.	-
Q. And what does that -- what does Texas in Perspective say?
MS. CALLCOTT: I think he said Medicaid in Perspective.
Q.	(By Mr. Hart) Medicaid in
| Perspective, what is stated in that document?
A. States that the Travis County study saved approximately, I believe, 3.8 percent.
Q. You aware of any other study, survey in Texas that has concluded or reached any specific number concerning savings as it relates to managed care in the Texas Medicaid arena?
MS. CALLCOTT: Are you asking him actual or projected?
MR. HART: Either.
A. Yes. If you're saying projected,
Q. (By Mr. Hart) What document?
A. There are several. One I can think of right now is Breaking the Mold. The other is --
Q. Let me talk to you about that. Breaking the Mold?	-
A. Right.
Q. What do you recall Breaking the Mold stating about savings in Medicaid?
A. Just that it was possible to make savings there.
Q. All right. And other than the. statement that it's possible, are you aware of any study or survey that the people who publish Breaking the Mold performed to reach that calculation?
A. No, I don't know how they did it.
Q. You just saw the statement?
A. I've seen the statement.
Q. All right. Any other documents where you've seen a statement?	►
A. Yeah, I may have to look at it.
It's Dollars --
Q. Dollars We Deserve?
A. Dollars We Deserve, yeah.	.
Q. And let me ask you. Do you just recall there being a statement about savings?
A. Yes, Medicare managed care savings.
Q. Do you recall what that statement
was?
A. No, I don't.
Q. Do you recall if it was a statement about future savings or past savings?
A. No, future.
Q. Do you recall any percentage that they may have mentioned in there?
A. No.
Q. Are you aware in the Dollars We Deserve, that document, whether or not there was any type of study or analysis performed to support whatever statement they rendered?
A. I don't remember.
Q. Okay. I think you mentioned in Medicaid in Perspective 1997 -A. Correct.
Q. -- there was the Bexar -- is it the Bexar County survey?
A. ,No, Travis County.
Q. Travis County. Other than that survey, are you aware of any other analysis or study performed in Texas for either the past or the future to determine savings in the Medicaid system going to managed care?
A. Actual or projected again?	'
MS. CALLCOTT: If you don't understand his question, just ask him and he'll rephrase it.
A. Why don't you rephrase the question.
Q. (By Mr. Hart) I'll break it up.
Are you aware of any study or analysis other than the one you mentioned in Travis County -A. Uh-huh.
Q. -- that has made a determination in Texas as to any cost savings related to going to managed care?
A. No.
Q. All right. Let's talk about in the future.
A. Okay.
Q. And I'm not just talking about a statement, but are you aware of any study or
analysis that has been performed that has projected any savings to the State of Texas and its Medicaid system going to managed care?
MS. CALLCOTT: Would it help you if you looked at the list?
THE WITNESS: Yeah, I think it would help if I looked at the list.
Q. (By Mr. Hart) If you need to look at the list, feel free to. And again, what I'm trying to distinguish between is just a statement as opposed to any survey or study that has some factual basis to it.
MR. HART: Why don't we go off the record for a minute and let him do that.
(A recess was taken.)
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back
on.
Q. (By Mr. Hart) Mr. Drobny, before we went off the record I had asked you to look at the documents that were listed and to identify for me any studies or surveys that you believe existed that reflected cost savings -A. Uh-huh.
Q. -- for Texas going to a managed care program.	•
A. Correct.
Q. Have you done that for me?
A. Yes, I have.
Q. Could you read off for me first the exhibit and then the documents that you . believe are studies or surveys relating to cost effectiveness of managed care.
A. Okay. Exhibit A.
Q. And actually that would be Exhibit
4?
A. Yes.
MS. CALLCOTT: Read the
sticker.
A. This is Drobny 2, right?
Q. (By Mr. Hart) Correct.
A. Texas 1115 Waiver dated 10-31-96. Texas 1115 Medicaid Waiver dated 8-31-95.
Q. When you submit a waiver, do you have to as part of the waiver process submit proj ections?
A. Yes.
Q. And do you believe -- is there an actual -- on the waiver is there an actual
dollar amount demonstrated as a savings comparing managed care to fee for service?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Continue.
A. Briefing materials in Texas, Medicaid Part 2, May 16, 1994.
Q. Okay. Study of Cost Effectiveness in Medicaid in Texas, Sperry and Scarborough, '83. Public hearing Medicaid charge from Lieutenant Governor Bullock, 1994. Against the Grain, 1993. Texas 1115 Medicaid Waiver 8-31-95.
Q. Is there anything on Exhibit 1?
A. Yes. Again, the Sperry and Scarborough Study of Cost Effectiveness,
1983. Health and Human Services Medicaid Perspective, January 1997. Control public accounts, Dollars We Deserve, Part 4, 1990.
Drobny 3. Original 1915 B Waiver. Listed as 6-96. That's it.
Q. Okay. So the documents you read to me would be documents that you believe are any -- reflect any analysis or study relating to cost savings by the Texas Medicaid system for managed care?
Q. Either in the past or in the future?
A. Correct.	•
Q. On Exhibit Number 6, the first , sentence, you state that they missed out on other benefits. What do you mean when you say • "other benefits"?
A. Benefits that are associated with Medicaid managed care.
Q. What would those be? What benefits did Texas miss out on?
A. That the recipient would have a medical home.
Q. Explain that to me.
A. "Medical home" means a place the recipient can go to always get medical care instead of entering through the emergency room.
Q. That's assuming that every
Medicaid person enters through the emergency ^
room?	S
s
A. That's correct.
V£>
<T>
Q. There is -- in Texas prior to the implementation of managed care, a Medicaid
patient could receive treatment without going to the emergency room; is that right?
A. That's correct.
Q. And when you say "a home," you're saying that under that arrangement, that under a managed care arrangement, each Medicaid person would have at least a primary physician?
A. That's correct.
Q. Under a fee for service arrangement, what prohibits the individual from having a primary physician?
A. Under fee for service, the policy in this state before managed care was really to refer the person to an emergency room.
They never saw the same doctor or went to the same hospital or anything else. It was built in into the system that whenever a person was sick, whether it be for acne or a broken toe or anything, they went directly to the emergency room.
Q. So it's your testimony, then, that for basically any type of injury, the Medicaid population in Texas accessed medical care through the emergency room?
Q. Okay. Are you -- is there any survey or analysis that sets forth that opinion or quantifies it in any-amount?
A. I'm basing that on my experience.;
Q. What experience has led you to believe that that's to be the case?
A. Over four years consulting with John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth,
Texas. And over a year working with Thomason Hospital in El Paso, Texas.
Q. What did you find in consulting with John Peter Smith? First of all, what were you consulting with them about?	.
A. I was consulting with them to bring their hospital into a managed care program.
Q. Okay. And how long did your consulting contract last with them?
A. Four years.
Q. And did it deal with managed care from a Medicaid standpoint, or just a general medical treatment?
A. Well, primarily a Medicaid standpoint.
Q. Did you bring them into the Texas -- a managed care provider in the Texas Medicaid system?
A. No, I did not.
Q. Tell me, then, what experience you had with John Peter Smith that leads you to believe that the Medicaid population uses the emergency room as opposed to other ways to enter medical treatment.
A. Hundreds of discussions with doctors and other clinical personnel of how they referred patients, how they treated patients. Observations of my own in the emergency room. Observations of my own throughout the hospital.
Q. Was there any study or survey performed by John Peter Smith, which tracked their Medicaid population and made a determination as to any percentage that used the emergency room versus other methods to enter treatment procedures?
A. Not to my knowledge.
Q. Okay. What did you do in El Paso?
A. Did the same thing. Basically cried to get Thomason Hospital into a Medicaid
program. Medicaid managed care program.
Q. Were you successful in doing that?
A. No.
Q. And what experience at the hospital in El Paso you think supports your position concerning emergency room treatment for Medicaid patients?
A. Discussions with doctors and, again, other clinical personnel and observations of my own of people cuing up in the emergency room.
Q. Are you aware in El Paso at that hospital if they did any type of survey or analysis to determine how their Medicaid population was accessing their system?
A. Not to my knowledge.
Q. Any other -- when you say in Paragraph 1 of Exhibit 6, when you have other benefits, is there any other benefit that you're speaking of in addition to this having a home?
A. The medical home is primarily the main benefit because from that flows the other benefits. That is to say, access, the teaching of preventative medicine. You can't
do any of these things if you don't have a place to go. You can't be taught how to prevent disease if you're just going to the emergency room. You can't really have a regular doctor if you're going to the emergency room. All of these things, the access of a medical home, the being of a medical home means that you can have the ability to have a regular physician.
Q. Under the Medicaid program, managed care programs, if you have a home provider, or preventative education, health education, is that funded under the Medicaid program?
A. I'd like you to restate that question, please.
Q. You said preventative, one of the benefits for the home concept was having preventative health measures?
A. Because you're able to track the recipient. The recipient is assigned to a PCP, for example. Then you're able to track him, you're able to get him into different programs. If he's just accessing the system by coming into the emergency room, you have no
way of finding out where he is or whatever.
You have no idea. He just comes in when he gets sick.
Q. Okay. And then the benefit -- if he's in a PPO -- is that his doctor has a history? Is that -MS. CALLCOTT: I don't think , he said PPO. I think he said PCP meaning primary.
A. PCP. He's assigned to a doctor, a PCP, primary care physician.
Q.	(By Mr. Hart) Does that apply to
the HMO?
A. That's the way the HMO works.
Q. Well, then, you said PCP. Did you say PCP?
A. Yes. Primary care physician.
Q. Is that the same as PCCM?
A. No.
Q. We didn't talk about a PCP. You said PHP.
A. But --
Q. I'm asking the questions and you look to me. And my question to you is:
Earlier I asked you about the various types of
managed care.
Q. One of the things you did not mention to me was a PCP. Is that a type of managed care?
A. No.
Q. All right. What does it have to do with managed care if it's not a type of managed care?
A. It is a definition for a primary care physician, which is part of an HMO concept. Every HMO has a primary care physician.	:
Q. Is it part of the PHP?
A. Yes, could be.
Q. Is it typically?
A. Yes.
Q. Is it part of a PCCM?
A. Yes.
Q. Is it part of a PPO?
A. I don't know.
Q. Can it be?	,
I
A. I don't know. I don't know how some of these PPOs are organized. PPOs are organized very different ways. As a rule,
they do not have PPOs in Medicaid managed care.
Q. So typically that would not be an area of managed care or would not be an option in Texas Medicaid managed care?
A. It isn't at the present time, PPO.
Q. Would you consider it to be an option?	•
A. No.
Q. Would it work?
A. I don't know.
Q. Do you think it would?
A. I don't know. I don't know.
Q. You have no idea?
A. Huh-uh.
Q. Okay. But you're an expert in managed care. That's a type of managed care and you have no opinion as to whether a PPO would work or not?
A. That's right. In Texas.
Q. All right. Other than the home concept for medical care, any other benefit to managed care that you were referring to in Paragraph 1 of Exhibit 6?
Q. What do you consider to be the benefits of -- if I ask you generally, what is the benefit of using a managed care versus a fee for service?	.
A. Benefit to whom?
Q. Well, I don't know. You've got down here other benefits of managed care. If someone is going to implement, if I am a -let's say a state Medicaid provider -A. Uh-huh.
Q. -- what do you believe is the benefit of going to managed care versus fee for service?
A. For a state Medicaid provider, i.e., hospital --
Q. I'm talking about the state.
What's the benefit to the state?
A. A provider usually means a hospital or a physician.
Q. I apologize if I used that word. The question I asked you, I'm going to ask you right now, is what is the benefit of a state going to managed care versus fee for service?
A. Saving money.
Q. That's the major benefit?
A. Yes.
Q. What is the -- what is a negative of a state going to managed care versus fee for service?	'
A. I don't know that there is any.
Q. Okay. You don't believe there to be any negative for a state and its Medicaid ■ population going from managed care -- going from fee for service to managed care?
A. Could you rephrase that question? You've now put state and Medicaid population together. Before you just had state.
Q. Well, don't you think a state if they're going to go to managed care is concerned about the Medicaid recipients who are going to be receiving the benefits under the managed care program?
A. I don't know.
Q. Would you think they would be?
A. I don't know.
Q. You have no idea?
A. I have no idea what's in the state administrator's mind. No, I don't.
Q. I thought you work in this field.
A. I do work in the field.
Q. Do you talk to administrators?
A. Absolutely. All the time.
Q. You never asked them what they're looking for in a program?	•
A. I'm never able to read their minds, no.
Q. I didn't ask you if you could read their minds. I don't expect you to read their mind. My question is: If I'm talking to a client and I'm trying to offer them some options, I would be asking them what are you looking for, what do you want to provide to your Medicaid population. You don't think that's important?
A. I do. But a lot of administrators have never said that to me, state administrators.
Q. Let me put it this way. Is there a negative to the state, the recipients, the individuals, in the Medicaid role of moving to managed care?
A. No.	tji
Q. You don't think there is any	m
<S)
negative to it?	§
s
Q. Do you believe the delivery of medical services to be as good or better under a managed care arrangement versus a fee-for-service arrangement? -
A. I believe it to be better under managed care arrangement.
Q. You would state that for the general population?
A. I would state that for the Medicaid population very definitely.
Q. Would you state that for the general population?
A. I don't know.
Q. Why don't you know?
A. Because there is so many different types of plans, and so many different things that happen in a general population I couldn't feel comfortable making a blanket statement like that.
Q. What happens in the general population that are different from the
I
Medicaid population that prohibit you from	;
b
making a statement like that?	e
.	a
A. In the general population, people ® have different opinions sometimes than the
Medicaid population. They're different types of people. They're all different types of people. It's a huge population. The whole universe is much different than a specific Medicaid population.
Q. What are they? If you think there is differences, tell me what you think they are. You've listed one. How does that affect your opinion as it relates to what that group would prefer from a medical -A. Just what I've read. There are some people in the general population who are wealthy enough who always want to be able to choose their own doctors.
Q. So you believe, then, in at least in the general population, that there may be a segment of those people who would not be satisfied with the providers or services available to them under a managed care arrangement?
A. Correct.
Q. Any other things?	£
-j
A. Huh-uh.	®
<s>
Q. When Texas went to -- when did	»
<s>
Q. Do you know how long -- was there a planning period prior to 1993 that Texas went in determining whether or not to go to managed care?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know how long that period -
was?
A. To the best of my knowledge, it was two years.
Q. So they started -- what did they start doing in 1991?
A. 1991, as I remember, the legislature passed a bill implementing these two pilot projects. And it was assigned to the state department, then the department of what was called DHS. And they worked on it for two years before they implemented the proj ect.
Q. What did they implement in 1993?
A. They implemented -- on September 1
t
they implemented an HMO, PHP model in Travis ^
c
County.	<s
0
h
Q. Okay. Do you have criticisms of <s the HMO and the PHP that they implemented in
Travis County?
A. Well, what do you mean by "criticisms”?
Q. I don't know. Do you think -- do you have something critical to say?
A. I think the HMO is a good idea. I think the PHP was not.
Q. Okay. Do you know why they did an HMO and a PHP?
A. No, I really don't.
Q. Okay. Why do you think the PHP was not a good idea?
A. Because it didn't save money.
Q. And how do you know that?
A. By Texas Medical Perspective,
Medicaid Perspective 1997.
Q. What does it say about the PHP?
A. It says that the PHP costs more than fee for service.
Q. Did it say any benefits that may have been obtained through the PHP?
A. No.	1
c
Q. Why would the PHP cost more than (
(
the HMO?	1
A. All I can think of is that they
had cost overruns. They spent more money than they had intended to spend.
Q. You don't know anything about -you haven't seen anything that discusses why there may have been any -A. The HMO is capitated. And the PHP was not totally capitated. The hospital costs, when you don't capitate hospital costs on a fee for service they can get out of hand. And I presume that's what happened.
Q. But that's your assumption?
A. Yes.	.
Q. Have you seen anything that supports that assumption?
A. No.
Q. So you think the PHP in retrospect was a bad idea?
A. The State didn't continue it after that pilot project. They never continued it. So I believe that that's a reflection that was a bad idea, yes.
Q. Do you agree with that?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. And the State after implementing it made a decision not to use it anymore?
Q. How about the HMO? Any criticisms of the HMO in Austin?
A. No, it did well. •
Q. Okay. Other than Austin, what else did the State do in 1993 as it relates to managed care?	•
A. It implemented a PCCM program on December 1st in the tri-county area.
Q. And when you say "tri-county," what area are you referring to?
A. Chambers, Galveston and Beaumont. Orange County.
Q. And what's your opinion of the PCC program that was implemented in the tri-county area by Texas?
A. I believe the PCCM program was not a good program.
Q. And why do you believe that?
A. One, it had significant cost overruns.
Q. Okay. Is the program still in place today?
A. Yes, it is.
Q. And how is the program doing
A. Again, the Texas Medical Perspective said it had a cost overrun of 6.7 percent.	.
Q. Did it say why?
A. No.
Q. So you think it was a bad idea?	.
A. Yes.
Q. . What do you think that Texas should have used in the tri-county area?
A. An HMO.
Q. And how about the -- when it says it has cost overruns, is there any comparison of what the PCCM saved versus a normal fee for service if they would have continued fee for service in that area?
A. Yes. The fee for service would have been basically, as I said, 6.7 percent less expensive.
Q. That's why I was confused.
A. Okay.
Q. I thought it was cost overrun from projection. How about the PCCM? When you spoke of it being over cost, was that versus what they would have paid for fee for service?
Q. That brings up a point then. Does managed care always result in savings?
A. No.	•
Q. Can you -- and what are some reasons why a managed care program would not result in savings?	'
A. Because it did not use a capitated method.
Q. So you believe if it uses a capitated method, that that will keep the program from not being a cost saver?
A. I'm sorry. I didn't understand that question.
Q. I think that question was probably not what I wanted to ask. You believe that if a managed care program is capitated then it should save money?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. So you would be an advocate, then, if I follow you, then, the only kind of managed care program you would advocate would be a capitated managed care program?
A. That is correct.
Q. And the only kind of managed care
program you would advocate would be a capitated managed care program for all types of services provided?
A. That is correct. *
Q. And, for instance, capitated for the doctors, capitated for the hospital, capitated in what other area?	'
A. Radiology, pharmacy, all different programs.
Q. Are you aware of any capitated -totally capitated managed care programs in the Medicaid system in any other states?
A. Yes.
Q. What states?
A. Specifically there are a whole number of them. Most of the states today are going to totally fully capitated systems.
Q. Can you name me some states that are totally capitated that are Medicaid systems, managed care program?
A. Washington, Wisconsin.
Massachusetts.
Q. How many states have Medicaid programs?
A. All now today. Every state now
has a Medicaid program.
Q. Of the 50 states that have Medicaid programs, how many of them have moved to managed care?	-
A. The last estimate -- and this is changing all the time -- this is a very rapidly moving field. I think there is only two or three states now that don't have Medicaid managed care in them. Wyoming is one. Alaska is another. There may be one or two more, but that's it. They're all looking at Medicaid managed care now because they need to save money.
Q. And you say this is a rapidly changing field?
A. Very rapidly changing.
Q. Has this been a dynamic area for Medicaid administrators, something that they have been dealing with and looking at?
A. They haven't been doing it very fast. They have had to have been prodded by the industry.
Q. What industry?
A. The insurance industry.
Q. So you believe that the insurance
industry wanted managed care before the states did?
A. I believe that the insurance industry saw the benefits of managed care and tried to interest the states, have been trying to interest the states. I mean, that's who was doing managed care was the insurance	.
industry.	'
. And they have been in that field since the early '70s, and they have been trying to interest different states and counties in that since the early '70s. And some counties have been taking that since the early '70s. In the early '70s there is examples in California where prepaid plans have been in existence since '73.
Q. Do you believe in Texas that the insurance companies have been wanting managed care in the Medicaid population before the State had wanted to implement it?
A. Yes.
Q. So you - -
A. And not just insurance companies. Groups of hospitals, medical groups. A whole panoply of groups had wanted managed care.
Q. Before the State wanted it?
A. Before the State wanted it, yes.
Q. And so if I was to implement, if I was a state, let's just make an•assumption.
A. Okay.
Q. I'm the State of Texas. I want to go to managed care.	-
A. Okay.
Q. In order for me to do that, what am I going to need out there, what needs to be available to me to go to managed care for my Medicaid population?
A. I think if you were the State of Texas what you would need first is a plan and you would need to go out on a competitive bidding process to see what was available out there.
Q. I'm speaking more from just the basic, very basics. In order for a state to go into managed care, Number 1, you've got to have an insurance organization willing to do it; is that right?
A. That's one. Not necessarily an insurance organization, some organization that is willing to take the risk.
Q. Okay. If it's not an insurance organization, then who would it be?
A. It would be a group of hospitals or a single hospital or a group.of doctors or a multipractice doctor setup. There is lots of things.
Q. And if we're talking about HMO	,
through insurance companies, like you're saying the insurance companies wanted to get into it, let's talk about that. The first thing I would need then would be a willing insurance company.	.
A. Okay. Fine.
Q. Is that a fair statement?
A. That's a fair statement.
Q. And if there is not any insurance companies out there, then that's going to prohibit me, who are willing to do managed care for the Medicaid population, that's going to prohibit me from moving into that program.
Do you agree with that?
A. If there weren't any insurance companies out there, but it's my belief in Texas as in every other state, insurance companies have been in Texas, it's probably
about the founding of the State of Texas since 1845. There have always been insurance companies in Texas, as far as I know.
Q. Doing HMOs since 1845?
A. Not HMOs. You just said insurance companies. I'm saying insurance companies.
Q. I got you confused then because -- -
A. Okay.
Q. I don't know that they've been around since 1845. I'm sure they've been around a long time. My question to you was, if I'm the State of Texas moving to managed care -A. Okay.
Q. -- from an insurance standpoint and one of the things you said insurance companies provide is managed care programs.
A. Right.
Q. If I want to go that route, if I'm the State of Texas looking at managed care, one of the things I'm going to need are insurance companies providing managed care programs, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And if they're not out there,
that's going to prohibit me from going through that process, correct?
A. Yeah, if they weren't out there, but they are out there.
Q. I know. You've said that about 15 times so far. Let me go through my questions and we'll get through this a little bit quicker.	•
Second step, if you're going to go through an insurance company for a managed care program, if you've got the insurance company in place, the insurance company is going to need providers, right?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. And if there is not providers willing to do it, and enough providers willing to do it, it's not going to work, is it?
A. That would be true, yeah.
Q. Okay. Do you believe that the medical lobby in the State of Texas has always been supportive of managed care for the
Medicaid population?	►
<2
A. I don't know.	c
o
N
Q. Do you believe the medical lobby N in the State of Texas to be a powerful lobby?
Q. You have no idea?
A. Huh-uh.
Q. You're telling me that part of your business is consulting at least on two occasions in the State of Texas and you're not familiar with its medical lobby?
A. I'm familiar with the Texas Medical Association, but I don't know how powerful they are or not powerful.
Q. Okay. In general have states -- a general perspective, has a state typically gone to managed care for its general population and then moved to managed care for its Medicaid population?
A. Not necessarily.
Q. You would not say there is any trend one way or the other?
A. No, huh-uh.
Q. What was the experience, let's say, in California since that is where you're from?	I
A. Okay.	!
i
Q. Was there a managed care program j offered to the general Medicaid population --
excuse me, the general medical population before the Medicaid population?
A. Could you rephrase that? I'm
sorry.
Q. Yeah. It's my understanding -I'm not on Medicaid.
A. Right. I hope not.
Q. I have the availability to go to a managed care program through my insurance.
A. Okay.
Q. But I haven't always had that opportunity here in the State of Texas. For instance, my employers did not offer a managed care program until four or five years ago.
All right?
A. Okay.
Q. My question to you: In the State of California was managed care available to the general nonMedicaid population before the Medicaid population?
A. I do not believe so. California is unusual in the fact that experimentation
“	CS
H
was done. It was very unusual to have managed ^
care, you know, prior to 1973. And there are s
0
N
several instances in California where several *
small plans in separate counties started experimenting with prepaid plans as early as 1973. And probably as far back as 1965.
Q. Okay. But my question simply to you is this. And you're talking about programs and counties. I don't know if you're speaking of the general medical program.
A. I'm talking about the Medicaid population. What you're asking me is, I think I understand this, you're asking me what came first. Was a managed care program, a commercial managed care program available first before Medicaid program. And my belief in California was that because of the way the state was and the problems with Medi-Cal, there were several demonstration projects that came first. Contra Costa County being one, which is a county in the suburban bay area behind Oakland.
Q. Just so I'm clear then, you're talking about, and you're stating to me then that you believe the first managed care programs in the State of California were offered in the Medicaid population?
Q. And then did the general population lag behind that?
A. Yes, they did.
Q. And do you know what the lag period was?
A. I don't know. But it's a case -in California it's a case of sort of ups and downs. Now they are putting -- in California we have six million people on Medi-Cal. So that's 20 percent of the population. We're in the process now of putting a hundred percent of those people on the Medicaid managed care.
And I would say that in the . general population in California, probably 40 percent of the people are on some form of managed care. So that's the difference if that answers your question.
Q. Do you believe it to be -- that timing to be the same or the typical way that states have implemented managed care or managed care has been implemented in states, that being at first managed care has first been introduced into the Medicaid population and then was followed in the commercial population?
A. I guess what I'm saying, there is no typical way.
Q. If that's your opinion, we can cut it off there. I didn't know if you had an opinion on that.
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Excuse me. I need to change the tape.
(A recess was'taken.)
.	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're on
the video.
Q. (By Mr. Hart) Mr. Drobny, in the State of Texas what was first? Managed care to the Medicaid population, or managed care to the general population?
A. Managed care to the general population.
Q. When did managed care to the general population become available in the State of Texas?
A. Approximately 19 -- somewhere in the area between 1979 and 1983.
Q. And that would be when some programs were first introduced into this state?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you know what percentage of the general health care population was using the managed care option, let's say, in 1983?
A. No, I don't.	.
Q. Do you have any idea what percentage of the Texas general population was using managed care, let's say, 1990?
A. No, I don't. No.	•
Q. Would you -- do you know whether or not that managed care in the State of Texas for the general population is something that has taken time to sink in with the general population to a point where they would exercise those options?
A. I think that's correct, yes.
Q. And when do you think in Texas people became more comfortable with managed care and there became -- and the population for managed care in the general population increased?
A. Well, where there were plans in the Dallas and Houston area, as early as the '70s, there was significant growth in those plans. Sanus purchased a plan in Houston in 1983 or '84 and it grew quite rapidly. I
think it had been owned by -- I don't remember who it had been owned by previously, but it had quite a few members throughout the Harris County area.	•
Q. You would agree with me, that managed care in the general Medicaid population -- excuse me, in the general health -population in Texas, took time before people became comfortable with it?
A. It took a longer period of time.
I would say that, yes.
Q. And today, as we sit here today, do you know what percentage of the Texas general health care population utilizes managed care versus fee for service?
A. No, I don't. But I know it's growing very rapidly.
Q. Do you know whether or not fee for service is still the majority of the -- still the majority arrangement for most Texas -Texans using the general insurance? Do you understand my question?
A. No.
Q. Let me rephrase it. Do you know today whether or not for the general health
care population in Texas -A. Uh-huh.	'
Q. -- whether the majority of that population uses managed care or fee for service?
A. No, I don't.
Q. In a state when -- when a state wants to implement managed care, do the demographics of a state come into play when managed care is a consideration?
A. Yes.
Q. And tell me how the demographics would come into play.
A. Well, you know, for example, in the San Francisco Bay area, if you were in Oakland, you would be closer to a doctor in San Mateo maybe than you might be in another part of Alameda County. But the problem is you have to cross a bridge to go over there and there is a bay of water. So those demographics would be very important to how you schedule where the people go.
Q. How many different states have you worked in trying to implement managed care?
A. Well, I've worked in the Medicaid
programs in, I'd say, half of the 50 states.
Q. Dealing with managed care?
A. Not necessarily managed care. All phases. Different phases of Medicaid.
Q. Would you agree that the demographics of the various states that you have worked in relating to Medicaid affect the type of options they try to provide'to their citizens?
A. I don't know if it affects the type of the options as much as it affects the implementation period, how you would implement it, how long it would take to implement it.
Q. Tell me about that. How do demographics of a state affect the implementation, let's say, of the managed care program?
A. I think if you have large -- a large state with different urban sectors like you do in the State of Texas, that it would take you longer to implement a managed care state plan than you would have a homogeneous state like Rhode Island where it's mostly all urban. Distance and everything else.
Q. Would the size of the State of
Texas also be a factor that would make it more difficult to implement a managed care program?
A. Sure.
Q. Anything else that would make it more difficult to implement from a demographic standpoint?
A. Not that I can think of, no.
Q. We talked about in 1993. Texas going into the Austin area and then the tri-county area for managed care. Was there any other area that you're aware of that they went into in 1993?
A. No.
Q. Do you believe there should have been other areas that they should have gone into in 1993?
A. Yes.
Q. What areas do you think they should have gone into?
A. I believe that after the bill was passed, that they should have been faster in implementing the pilot programs. And by 1993 they should have been prepared to have a plan nhat implemented the project statewide and at least by the end of '93 could have opened some
other programs in different counties.
Q. Okay. So if I'm following you then, you think from sometime in 1991 --by 1993, they should have had a plan to implement managed care statewide?
A. That's right.
Q. Do you know whether or not they had such a plan? .
A. I know they did not.
Q. Okay. Did they have a plan by 1993 to go beyond Travis County and the tristate area?
A. No.
Q. So it's your understanding the only plan they had in place by 1993 was those two locations?
A. That is correct.
Q. There were no other plans from any other location?
A. None at all.
Q. Do you have any idea why Texas made a decision to go into those two areas first?
A. I think it was -- it was mandated by the state legislature.
Q. So that would have been legislation that said -A. In 1991. The '91 session.
Q. Saying we're going to let you go into these two areas?
A. Yes, I think so.
Q. Do you know whether that legislation had any other time frames to go into other areas?
A. No, I don't know that it did. I don't know. I just don't remember.
Q. And so in Texas, then, in order to go into the managed care option for the Medicaid population, that was something that the state legislature had to approve?
A. It didn't necessarily have to approve it. It mandated the pilot projects, because the executive branch of the State of Texas was not moving fast enough in Medicaid managed care, so in 1991 the legislative branch of the State of Texas decided to give it a push.
Q. So it's your belief, then, that when you say the "executive branch," who are you speaking of?
A. I'm speaking of that branch of government that is run by the Governor.
Q. And who from the executive branch should have been pushing, or was not pushing managed care in the Medicaid population hard enough?
A. I don't know that there is any specific individual. I mean, the ultimate responsibility also rests on these things with the governor.
Q. So you think the Governor of the State of Texas should have been pressing for managed care in the health -- in the Medicaid population before 1991?
A. I believe so, yes.
Q. Do you know whether the governor was or wasn't?
A. I don't. I really don't.
Q. Okay. Are you aware of whether or not the agencies involved with implementing or administering Medicaid in the State of Texas were prohibited from going to a managed care program prior to 1993 because they had not had legislative approval?
A. No, they weren't prohibited
because they were getting requests from different entities to appreciate, but they weren't being pushed either.
Q. So it's your opinion that prior to 1991, if the agencies responsible for running Medicaid had wanted to go to managed care, they could have done that without receiving	,
legislative approval?	'
A. I believe so, yes.
Q. Tell me in the State of Texas, who would make the decision -- what agency, first of all, is responsible for running Medicaid?
A. Well, it depends at what time we're talking about.
Q. Let's talk about 1991.
A. 1991 would be the Department of Human Services, Medicaid was located in that department at that time.
Q. Was that the only department?
A. No. At that time they had also created an umbrella agency called the Health and Human Services Commission over several agencies and that would have to have a say in that also.
Q. Okay. So those were the agencies
that would have had to discuss it?
A. Correct.
Q. In the second part of Paragraph 1 on Exhibit Number 6 you state that by not significantly expanding managed care throughout the state more expediently, that that is something that Texas didn't do?
A. That's correct.
Q. First of all, you say "significantly expanding." Tell me where you believe Texas should have been, how should they have more significantly expanded managed care?
A. I believe that after the pilots, even if the pilots were -- which they were all very late in starting, even after 1993, I think after six months' experience they certainly had some idea of what they wanted to do. I believe in early 1994 they could have very easily expanded into Tarrant County and some other counties.
Q. So you think first they should have gone to Tarrant County?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. And that should have been done by
Q. Do you know if there was anything that prohibited them from expanding into Tarrant County in 1994?
A. Not to my knowledge. No, there was nothing.
Q. And you were working with the Tarrant County Hospital District?
A. Yes, I was.
Q. Was that for Medicaid managed
care?
A. Yes, it was.
Q. And when did you start working for
them?
A. April of 1993.
Q. All right. Do you know whether or not they were in contact with the State in April of 1993 concerning the expansion of Medicaid into the Tarrant County area?
A. Yes, I know they were.
Q. So at least in 1993 they were	£
discussing expansion into Tarrant County?	®
(S)
A. That is correct.	°°
u>
oo
Q. Where else do you think they
should have been in by 1994?
A. Well --
Q. Did they go into Tarrant County?
A. No, they did not. •
Q. So they're not in Tarrant County right now?
A. Yes, they are*
Q. When did they go into Tarrant County?
A. They implemented a program on October 1, 1996.
Q. And when I say them, I'm talking about Texas Medicaid?
A. Correct.
Q. Where else do you think they should have gone, expanded to at a quicker pace?
A. I think they should have expanded in 1994 all over the state, because in September of 1994 they had a request and what they called an RFI. There were 55 responses to that RFI. And they were from all over the

state. And these RFIs were never reacted on. * These people never got the courtesy of a return statement. They just dropped it.
Q. Okay. What is an RFI?
A. It's a Request for Information.
It's a bidding process.
Q. You said in, I think, September of
1994?
A. September of '94.
Q. That Texas received 55 RFIs?
A. Right. They requested them, the
State of Texas Medicaid managed care division
requested these.
Q. And what did they request -- what
did the request state?
A. They stated an interest in
providing Medicaid managed care services to
the State of Texas in specific areas. Didn't
even specify the areas, as I remember. It was
all statewide.
Q. And so these went out to different
providers or to insurance companies?
A. To everyone. To providers. We
have these -- all these documents are on our
Exhibit B. And you can see that they come
from all different walks of -- all different (
parts of the state, if you would like to look c
o
, # at them.	s
Q. If you would just show me, just identify if you could that group of documents.
A. Yeah, there is a large group here. I'll just --to save time.
Q. You mind if I step up and look
over.	'
A. Just look over my shoulder. I can show you what they are. Basically starting here on --
Q. Bottom of Page 2?
A. This is -- well, these all here.
Here -- these are different. Blue Cross, Blue Shield. This is the chairman of Harris County. It's Houston. John Guest is San Antonio. This is San Antonio. These are all proposals. This is Russ Tolman down in Fort Worth.
Q. So this would be on Exhibit Number 3, Page 3?
A. Page 3, 4.
Q. Running through -A. 5, 6, 7. And I think it ends about there. One here on the 8th.
Q. And those would be the request for
information?
A. Right. They're their responses to the request for information from the State of Texas.
Q. And in the request for information, what was the state, what type of information were they seeking?
A. They were seeking the capability, if you have the ability to provide Medicaid managed care services in the area you were projecting for. It was limited to 15 pages. And some of these are longer. Some of these are shorter than 15 pages. But it was, as I just showed you there, all over the state.
Q. And do you know what the state did with these requests for information?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. What did they do with them?
A. Nothing.
Q. And when you say "nothing," typically what would a state do with a request for information?
A. They would usually say we're going to -- they could do many different things.
They could say we're going to accept some and
implement some plans in these counties. We're not going to accept some. We decided not to do anything. They didn't do anything. There was never, ever a response.	■
Q. Did you represent any entity that submitted a request for information?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. Which entity?
A. The Tarrant County Hospital District, and the El Paso County Hospital District.
Q. Okay. And are you -- is it your understanding that Texas did not respond to any of the 55 requests for information?
A. Yeah, none of them it's my understanding.
Q. And just so I'm clear, then, you think by 1994 Texas should have implemented a managed care system throughout the state?
A. At least had a plan. I'm saying at least by '94 they should have had a plan to do that, yes.
Q. Let me ask you. In the State of Texas to implement managed care throughout the state, first of all, how long would it --
would you say it would take to come up with a plan to do that time-wise?
A. I think a plan would take a couple months to come up with.
Q. All right. How long would it take to implement a managed care program statewide?
A. Two to three years.
Q. When you say "statewide,," you think that somebody in Fort Stockton, Texas should have access if they're on Medicaid to an HMO-type program?
A. I think it's possible even in a small community as Fort Stockton to have that. It may not be possible. Fort Stockton is a very rural community. It's out on I-10 110 miles from El Paso. That's very difficult. But I'm saying at least the bulk of the population could be serviced by an HMO-type concept.
Q. When you say the "bulk of the population," do you include in that the urban -- the urban areas in the State of Texas?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. All right. Let's talk now where
is -- where are the HMO programs for Medicaid population available in the urban areas in Texas today? Are they in Harris County?
A. Not yet. Not until I understand that that program has been delayed. So I cannot tell you today what date that will start.
Q. Do you know when?
A. It was supposed to start October
1st.
Q. Of -A. 1997, yes, in Harris County, yes.
Q. How about Dallas County? When
did - -
A. Dallas County is now not scheduled to start until February of 1999.
Q. Okay. How about Tarrant County?
A. Tarrant County started October 1st or November 1st, 1996. I believe it was October 1st. Could have been November 1st, though.
Q. How about in El Paso?
A. El Paso is not scheduled until the end of 1999.
Q. How about San Antone?
A. Bexar County is a program that started on -- September 1, 1996.
Q. It's been in place?
A. It's been in place since that time, almost a year now.
Q. After the '93 initial implementation -A. Uh-huh.
Q. -- what areas did Texas next move
into?
A. Well, they didn't do anything until September 1st, 1996 when they implemented Bexar County and Lubbock County.
Q. And that was in 1996?
A. 1996. So that was three years basically later.
Q. And what did they do after that?
A. Then they put out what we call a request for proposal, the State put out a request for proposal for Harris County. And in about February, January or February of 1997. And they made an award on that April 15, 1997.
Q. Okay. Have they gone into any other areas since Lubbock and --
A. And Tarrant County.
Q. And Tarrant County?
A. No.
Q. So right now they're in the tri-county?
A. Correct.
Q. They're in Austin?
A. Correct.
Q. They're in San Antone?
A. Correct.
Q. They're in Lubbock County?
A. Correct. And Tarrant County.
Q. And Tarrant County. They start in Houston in -- supposed to be '97?
A. Supposed to be October 1st, 1997, but I'm understanding it's being postponed to December 1, 1997.
Q. And then we've got Dallas not until 1999?
A. Dallas 1999.
Q. El Paso?
A. Not until late 1999, November of 1999. February 1999 is Dallas.
Q. Is there any urban area within the state that you're aware of that either managed
care is not already in place or there is not plans to -- a plan to have it in place?
A. Well, there is a plan to have it in place all throughout the state by 2002.
They now have a plan, an eight-year implementation plan.
Q. And that would include first the urban areas?	'
A. Yes. Well, some of the other urban areas you and I haven't talked about are like Nueces County, Corpus Christi. That's in there. I can't remember what day, but think that's about 2 000.
Q. Waco?
A. Waco, Tyler. Some of these are still urban, you know.
Q. I'm with you. But basically there's plans by the year 1999 to have the majority of the urban -- what we would consider urban areas to be covered?
A. The large urban areas, the larger
SMAs .
Q. And I think you told me that the rural -- pretty much the remaining part of Texas would be covered by the year 2000?
A. 2002, yeah.
Q. And you think that is a good
thing?
A. No, I don't think it-'s a good
thing.
Q. You don't think it should be covered?
A. I think it should be covered. I think it should be done faster. I think the rollout should be faster. I think after you have done Harris County and to have no rollouts in 1998 is unconscionable. Why should you wait almost two yaars. I think you ought to be able to do it faster than that.
Q. Are there any benefits that a state running a Medicaid program would reap from not rolling out the entire state at one time?
A. No. They would actually get more benefits, but I've never advocated rolling out this state all at one time because it's a large state.
Q. Tell me then, what have you advocated from a time standpoint as to how Texas should have rolled out its managed care
program?
A. I believe they should have rolled their managed care program out in a two- to three-year program.	.
Q. And how would you -- tell me progressively how you would have rolled out the program.
A. I think I would have rolled out the program in the larger -- in the larger counties first. And then rolled it out into the rural areas. And I think that I would have had a rollout, a progressive rollout every three to six months of a group of three to four counties.
Q. When you do your planning for a managed care program -A. Uh-huh.
Q. --in that planning phase I assume you have to contact and establish who the insurance companies are going to be?
A. And other providers, insurance companies and hospital groups.
Q. And then the hospital groups?
A. Yeah.
Q. And the providers?
Q. And when you roll that out and you start another one, then you would have to -A. Do the same thing. In reality, actually today these people are banging on your door. They want to get in there. They are the ones that are knocking on your door.
You don't have to go too far out your door.
Q. And you believe that to have been the case, let's say, in 1993?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. And you believe that to be the case in 1993 where there are an abundance of willing providers?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. And you believe in 1993 there was an abundance of willing hospitals?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. And you believe in 1993 there was an abundance of willing insurance companies to run HMOs?
A. Yes, I do.	**
Q. For Medicaid?	%
«
A. For Medicaid.	<
1
other ones, I was speaking specifically as to Medicaid.
A. Right, uh-huh.
Q. When a state -- in order to implement a managed care program, a state has to receive -- a managed care Medicaid program, a state has to receive a waiver from the federal government; is that right? ■
A. Not necessarily. Depends on what they do. I mean, there is certain things that they have to do. If they make it mandatory and they want to restrict the providers the people go to, yes, they have to have a waiver. If they want to make it all	,
voluntary, they wouldn't have to have a waiver.
Q. Well, for what Texas was doing -A. They would have to have a waiver. Q. And most states what they do -A. Most states have waivers. The programs I was talking to you about in California were voluntary.
Q. And it doesn't make -- the better arrangement would be to have it mandatory?
A. Sure. Absolutely.
Q. So if you're going to do it mandatory, and you get the waiver, it's not 1915?
A. It depends on what you're doing. 1915 would be -- is what Texas has used.
Q. In order to get the waiver, do you have to substantiate on the waiver that there are options available to the people?
A. Yeah, you have to give them access and they have to have access because you're limiting their freedom of choice. You have to show that they have access. I think that's what you're referring to.
Q. And the bottom line is you've got to have -- to substantiate a waiver you also have to show to the federal government that there was not just one person wanting to do that but there were other providers or other insurance companies interested in this and if there was a selection between -A. Normally you would do that, but the State in 1993 in Travis County tried initially just to do it with one PCA, with one HMO .
Q. But in order to do it with one,
even to substantiate that waiver, you would first have to show that you selected them over another?
A. You would have to show some reasons. And as it worked out, evidently they didn't show those reasons because they had to have the PHP in there.	.
Q. Let me ask you. In order to get a waiver, if there is only one willing provider available, you could not get that waiver. Is that a true statement?
A. I don't know. To be very honest with you, I think some waivers have been granted on only one willing provider.
Q. Can you identify for me any reason why the State of Texas has rolled out their managed care program for the Medicaid recipients in this State in the fashion that they have?
A. No. I can't give you a reason for
it.
Q. In your opinion, is there any benefit at all to the State in the method that they rolled out their managed care system?
Q. Is there any benefit to the recipients, in your opinion, as to the way the State rolled out its managed care program?
A. The way it rolled it out, no, there is no benefit in stretching it over this long period of time. There would be more benefit in both if you compacted it into the two- or three-year program I laid out before.
Q. So you think from 1993 -- I think is what you said?
A. Right.
Q. -- that it should have been rolled out completely?
A. Completely.
Q. -- within three years?
A. Yeah, and I think it could have been done by 1996.
Q. Do you know whether or not the state legislature supported a complete rollout within a three-year period of time?
A. I could never speak for the state legislature, and I don't think anybody else ever can either. But I do know that in 1995 they passed a bill called SB 10 that provided
Q. When you say provided more, provided more funds?
A. It didn't provide any funds, but it mandated a faster rollout. And in 1994 in some of the documents we have here, this showed all through 1994 they were having hearings on how they could basically save money and how they could do things on Medicaid managed care.
Q. And when you say documents that show that they could have done it more expeditiously, the documents related to hearings?
A. Hearings, right. Hearings, yeah.
Q. And I think those are easily identifiable?
A. Yeah, you can find them here very
quick.
Q. Have you performed any type of cost benefit analysis to determine any of the costs or the savings Texas would have received . by rolling out the program in the manner that you've described?
Q. Do you know whether anyone else has done any type of cost benefit analysis to determine in rolling out the plan within a three-year period of 1993 the way you've described?
A. No, I do not.
Q. In California, is managed care for the Medicaid population throughout the entire state?
A. Yes, it is.
Q. How long has it been like that?
A. Probably four or five years.
Q. Okay. And they first rolled it out in 1973?
A. Yeah. That was a voluntary plan. Those plans in 1973 had no state sanction. Those were county plans. They didn't get a plan and waiver approved probably until the early 1990s.
Q. Okay. So California didn't get a plan approved until the early 1990s?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. When do you think, then -- when you've talked about in Paragraph 3 you think you say Texas was slow to implement managed
care - -
Q. -- what year do you think Texas should have implemented it? .
A. Well, I think Texas should have been really -- you know, we go back to the Sperry report here, Sperry and Scarborough,	,
and they mention Medicaid managed care in 1983. I think Texas should have been looking at pilot programs for as big a state as it was in the late '80s and looking to implement a pilot program on their own in the late '80s.
Q. Who had implemented Medicaid managed care statewide by the late '80s? What state?
A. None.
Q. None. Okay. What was the first state to implement Medicaid managed care statewide?
A. I don't know. I'd have to look at some of my reference materials. I really don't know.
Q. Is there anything in any of these documents that would tell me who was the first state to implement Medicaid managed care
statewide?
A. No. Because nobody ever really recorded things that way. It was just not done that way.	•
Q. Let me ask you this. Not speaking of the first state, which state it was, what is your recollection as to the year that there was a state that went to managed care statewide for its Medicaid population?
A. I think -- I think by the early '90s that states like Massachusetts and Connecticut and Rhode Island, those states, had them statewide. I think so.
Q. And is it fair to say those were smaller population states?
A. Absolutely.
Q. And for the smaller population states, that's something that's easier to do?
A. Absolutely. No disagreement.
Q. And, in fact, has managed care been something -- let's talk first just the general health population. Has managed care been more receptive in different parts of the United States?
Q. Okay. Has managed care been more receptive in the general medical population in the Northeast?
A. Yes.	-
Q. Before it was accepted in the
South?
A. Yes.	,
Q. And more accepted on the West Coast than in the South?
A. Yes.
Q. And you would agree that the southern states have been slow, and when I say states I'm talking about the people in those states, have been slower to wrap their arms around managed care?
A. Well, up until -- I would agree with that up until about 1991.
Q. Okay. Just generally throughout the development?
A. We're talking about the whole southern tier states.
Q. And part of that is because in the Northeast you've got some major labor unions up there, right?	.
A. That's correct.
Q. And they implemented managed care early on?
A. That's correct.
Q. And it was something- that worked because you had a group of people together, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you would agree -- maybe you would agree with this -- generally do you think the population in California is a little bit more liberal than the population in Texas?
A. I definitely agree with that.
Q. Okay. I didn't want to stretch you too far, but I thought you would probably agree with that.
And in implementing these types of programs, the perceptions of the state's people are something you got to consider?
A. Sometimes. That is definitely a factor. I don't know how much of a weighting that is. But there has to be some consideration of that, yes.
Q. And wouldn't you agree that the state legislature has a better sense of what the people in their state want? I mean,
that's how our government is supposed to work, right?
A. I believe that's the way it's supposed to work, right. I think the legislature does. This is very true in the State of Texas. Because the legislature in the State of Texas sensed that in 1991 the	.
people were ready for managed care. They had to push the executive branch of government to do that. So they pushed those programs, yes.
Q. And you would agree that they're in the best position to know what the state, what the general population wants and what the Medicaid population wants, and what their constituents want as it relates to the benefits in the state?
A. As a rule, yes.
Q. Let's go to Sentence -- Paragraph 2 of Exhibit Number 6, Mr. Drobny.
A. Okay.
Q. It says, Despite the fact that many examples of effective managed care	“
I-
programs existed when the State began its	<s
s
implementation, the State managed care pilot £ program was not well-designed and the state's
rollout program was similarly ill-designed.
First of all, on the first part of that, you said there were many examples of managed care programs existing when Texas began its implementation. Tell me what examples you were speaking of.
A. I was speaking of the fact that by the time Texas started almost every other state had far more covered lives in their program than Texas and had had a lot of experience with it.
Q. And when you say far more covered lives, you're speaking Medicaid recipients covered by managed care?
A. Medicaid recipients covered by managed care, correct.
Q. When Texas started in 1993, can you name me the states who had managed care in place?
A. Sure, but I would like to have an exhibit to make -- I would have --
Q. Is there something that shows me?
A. Yeah, there is. It's on our exhibit list now. It's on -- we have it -it's the waiver -- for 1993 we were talking
about as of August 1993 I can read it off to you.
Q. Is it one of the documents?
A. Yeah, it's in here. And it's in my briefcase. I would have to pull it out of my briefcase. It's up to you guys.
Q. If you can just tell me which document you believe it is and then explain to me what the document would tell me.
MS. CALLCOTT: I think he's just asking you to identify which document it is.
A. Yeah, and I just don't know which one it is.
MS. CALLCOTT: Why don't you
look at the list?
THE WITNESS: Okay. Fine.
Q. (By Mr. Hart) And would that refresh your memory?
A. Yeah. I can tell you it's called the Medicaid Community Care Waiver List as prepared by the federal government, 1993.
Q. And what does that document	(
reflect?	#
are in managed care as of 1993.
Q. Okay. When you say "covered lives," would chat break it down by state?
A. Recipients, yes, by state.
Q. So, for instance, any state who had a managed care program, it would reflect a number of recipients?
A. Right.
Q. Medicaid recipients on managed care in that state?
A. At that time, yes.
Q. State by state?
A. State by state.
Q. I can look at that.
A. Okay. Fine.
Q. When you say despite the fact many examples of effective managed care programs, I understand on that it will show me the programs that were in place, is it your opinion that all of those programs that were in place in 1993 that provided managed care to the Medicaid population were effective?
A. No. I mean, some of them probably were not.
Q. Can you tell me the ones that were
not?
idea.
Q. And just so we're clear, then,
Mr. Drobny, when you state in Paragraph 2 of Exhibit 6, Despite the fact that many examples of effective managed care programs existed, you know in 1993 that other states had people covered under managed care but you could not identify for me in which states those programs were considered to be effective or ineffective?	.
A. Not without reviewing some more documentation, no.
Q. All right. And so when you say -when you're speaking of examples of effective managed care, you're really just saying that there are other states that had it in place in 1993?
A. No. It was effective. It was effective. What I'm saying about not all the plans, I don't think in any plan as big as our county is today that you can say 100 percent of every program is going to be effective. I don't think that would be correct. But I
think that the majority of those plans that were offered in 1993 were very effective.
Q. Do you have any particular state in mind that -- first of all, what do you mean by effective?
A. I mean effective that we were saving money for the states.	'
Q. Okay.
A. That we're saving and providing good medical care for the recipients.
Q. Okay. Can you identify for me any state that was not effective that you believe was not effective? Is there anyone you have in mind?
A. In '93?
Q. Yeah.
A. No, nothing specifically comes to mind, no.
Q. But you would agree that you could not make a blanket statement that each state in 1993 was effective?
A. No, because you're having start-up states. States were starting up during that time, and there can be, as you would well expect, to have some problems when you start
up a program of this magnitude. And they were starting up all the time. So I would have to think that some were not as effective as they later became.	.
Q. Is there any state that you can identify that has gone to managed care that has -- has not been effective?
A. I think, and I don't remember this completely, but originally in North Carolina in about 1976 they started a managed care program, particularly with vendor drugs. And it failed and they went back to fee for service.
Q. Any other -- are they still fee for service vendors?
A. No, I think they've converted back. Now they've got -- in 2 0 years they've gotten better computers and things and been able to do things.
Q. Any other examples of somebody who has gone to a managed care concept that has not been successful?
A. Not to my knowledge.
MS. CALLCOTT: In that
question are you asking at any point in time or today?
MR. HART: Yeah, you know, up to today.	■
A. I thought we were talking 1993.
Q. (By Mr. Hart) No, just any state that has gone into managed care. I was just -curious that you were aware of any today that have used managed care where it has not been successful.
A. No. I don't really. I can't -let me just say that in 1994, it's a pretty prominent example, and that's the State of Tennessee. State of Tennessee implemented everything all at one time and had problems.
But since 1994, it's taken them three years, but now they're running a very effective program.
Q. Are you aware of any state Medicaid program that terminated its managed care program, let's say, for inpatient hospitals because they found it to be unsuccessful?
A. Statewide? Total state doing it?
Q. Or any major urban area.
A. Not to my knowledge. That doesn't mean it couldn't be. Not to my knowledge.
Q. Okay. In the second part of Paragraph 2 on Exhibit 6 you state, The state's managed care pilot programs were not well-designed. And the states rollout program is similarly ill-designed.
First of all, what pilot programs are you talking about?
A. Specifically the instance here, the Exhibit 5 right here of A Report to the Texas Human Services Commission by Floyd Brandon points out the Bexar County and the problems they're having in Bexar County, which are very similar to the problems they had in the State of Tennessee in 1994.
Q. What are the problems as you see them that Bexar County's having?
A. There were system problems, provider payment problems. There were access problems. One of the things that Mr. Brandon points out in this article is that many of the PCPs just simply left a recording on their answering machines. When a recipient would call in, they would get a recording to go to
the emergency room. These things indicate that it was not very well thought out.
Q. You lost me. The PCP?
A. Primary care physician.
Q. If the Medicaid patient called them, they would call back and leave a message to the patient saying go to the emergency room?
A. Yeah. What happened was that this Medicaid recipient had been reassigned to this doctor, this PCP. He was sick. He wanted to know what to do. So he called in at 12:00 midnight, or whenever he called in, during a weekend and all he got was a recording to go to the emergency room. That's not managed care. So that's what was happening. Those are things that are documented in this report.
Q. In the Bexar County pilot program, is there any determination as to it has saved money versus the fee for service?
A. No, it has not. Not at this time. I think because it had only been in operation when Mr. Brandon wrote his report which has been seven months, eight months.
Q. And what had been the troubling
areas that had prevented that program from making cost savings?
A. Well, I think the thing that Mr. Brandon points out is very good is that the State should have required what he called a readiness review at the time of the implementation of the program. I want to tell you this program was implemented by the State on the Sunday before Labor Day.
Q. Okay.
A. That's a day I'll tell you most physicians are not around in this state or in any other state. They're down at the seashore doing something. And so there were patients running around wondering where they could get care. Over a hundred patients went directly to the emergency room at St. Rose's Hospital during that two-day period because they couldn't get care from their primary care physician because they were out of town.
Q. That aside, let's say we would have started on the Tuesday after Labor Day, would the program have achieved cost savings? ^
(9
A. I don't know. And I don't know ® without -- again what Mr. Brandon says what w
the State should have really done is done a real readiness review, check one of these for HMOs, one PCCM and three HMOs, and make sure they were ready to go on all of these things. They had provider manuals and everything else. And you can read in here some of the things that he said. I think if that had been accomplished on that Tuesday, yes, then it would have been a much better program.
Q. So when you were speaking of other states, these are the same kind of problems that you have when you roll out one of these managed care programs?
A. What I'm saying is, that the State of Texas in this Bexar County rollout learned nothing from the other states that had had errors. They replicated the same types of errors that other states had made in the rollouts. And one of the things that the State has always said, the reason that they haven't implemented this program earlier was because they wanted to learn from other states. And what I'm saying is, they didn't learn anything from the other states.
Q. What specifically, then, would you
have changed in the way they rolled out Bexar County?
A. I would have done what Mr. Brandon says here in his recommendations.
Q. Can you find those for me in the document?
A. Yeah, I'm flipping through them right now and you're free to read them.
Q. Just show them to me.
A. Require readiness reviews as part of the contractor selection process and before managed care organization
Q. I've got it. Let me talk to you about this for a second. In this document relating to Bexar County, Drobny Exhibit Number 5, you agree, then, with the recommendations for improvements to the implementation of Medicaid managed care services, he has listed some recommendations in this document.
A. Right.
Q. And do you agree with all of the recommendations?
A. Pretty much. Just about all of them. Particularly the ones regarding the
PCCM. I think that the PCCM which has the bulk of the membership there, those problems should not exist because NHIC had been working with them for a long time.	-
Q. When you say "them," who?
A. Those doctors in the PCCM.
Q. And how should that have prevented whatever problem there was in the PCCM?
A. Because NHIC has been operating in the state for 25 years with their computer system. They shouldn't have been missing payments and some of the other things that Mr. Brandon points out that they did on the PCCM model. As I said to you before, I don't believe the PCCM model is a very effective way of managed care. You asked me about cost effectiveness, if they're having these problems with the PCCM and the PCCM is already an expensive model, you could make sure that they're going to have significant cost overruns.
Q. What type of managed care program was implemented in Bexar County?
A. Well, there were two prongs.
There were three HMO types and one PCCM.
A. Okay.
Q. The HMO prongs, are you critical of the HMO prongs in Bexar County?
A. Yes, because they're not doing some certain things also.
Q. What are you critical of concerning the HMO prong?	'
A. I'm critical that they weren't ready to go either.
Q. What should -- tell me what they should have done.
A. They should have had their systems up as the PCCM should have too. They should have had their systems up, they should have been ready to go. They should have had the provider manuals out, distributed, and everything else, by September 1.
Q. Did they not have those out?
A. No, they did not.
Q. Was there a delay in getting their provider manuals out to the people?
A. That's what Mr. Brandon notes in his study.
Mr. Brandon's study to criticize Bexar County?
A. That's correct.
Q. And just so I can probably speed this up, any criticism you have as to Bexar County would be contained within his report?
A. Correct.
Q. You have nothing independent of what he is saying?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. What do you have independent?
A. I believe that Bexar County should never have implemented a PCCM program.
Q. And they should have just implemented all HMOs?
A. All HMOs, correct.
Q. And why do you believe that?
A. Because the PCCM program is a fee-for-service program with a case management fee, and they are not saving the kinds of money they could save in a fully capitated program.
Q. When a state typically rolls out its managed care program, have states in the past experimented with the various concept of ; managed care to see what concept works best i
within its state?
A. Yes, they have.
Q. So it's not uncommon for a state then to try an HMO, to try a PHP or a PCCM or PPO -- well, PPO I think you said they didn't.
A. Right.
Q. But those three and to see which one may work better within the state?
A. That's right.
Q. And -- I would assume, then, things that could affect each one of those type concepts of managed care would be the demographics of the particular area that you're implementing that concept?
A. No, I don't think the demographics come into play. I think up until 1991 or '92, states did exactly what you said. But after '92, most states weren't implementing a PCCM because regardless of demographics it wasn't saving them any money. As we see in the Texas Medicaid Perspective Study in 1997, it cost the State of Texas money to implement the one in the tri-county area.
Q. So after 1991, then, it's your
opinion that most managed care was either using an HMO or PHP?
A. Right, yes. And fully capitated.
Q. Both of those would-be fully capitated?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. Are you aware of any state that	>
did not implement either the HMO or the PHP that used the PCCM after 1991?
A. I'm sure there were. I'm sure even today probably states are trying to do that.
Q. Why would a state use a PCCM?
A. I really don't know.
Q. You have no opinion at all as to why a state would want -A. No, I wouldn't. It's not cost saving. And even this state, I can tell you from conversations I've had with key state officials, that they are very worried in Harris County if all the people join the PCCM down there it will cost their budget $100 million in the next biennium.
Q. Who have you talked to about this?
A. A person in the governor's office.
Q. What's his name?
A. Ron Lindsey.	-
Q. I'm sorry?
A. Ron Lindsey.
Q. And what has Mr. Lindsey told you?
A. He's told me that he is very concerned that as people join the PCCM, because it costs more money that it would have a significant cost impact on the next State biennium budget. I believe it would.
Q. What is Mr. Lindsey's position?
A. I don't know what his exact title is, but he's a special assistant to the governor for health policy.
Q. And what is the option that is available or is going to be made available in Houston or Harris County, what is that -- what concept are they using in Harris County?
A. Well, they are using a -- they had a proposal, as I explained to you before, earlier this year. And it was awarded April 15, 1997. And they awarded it to six HMOs and one PCCM.
The legislature was still sitting at the time of this award. The Harris County Hospital District was very upset about not being awarded an HMO. They got their own bill through. So they got themselves included.
There is now seven HMOs and one PCCM.
And the HMOs are not what you	|
would normally think. They're not -- they're a lot -- there are several groupings of hospitals that -- I don't remember exactly which they are, but Memorial has their own and | Herman has their own. And then, for example, there is some out-of-state -- there are some out-of-state Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans that are in there too.
Q. And your criticism of the Harris County program, then, is the fact it's going to use a PCCM?
A. Absolutely. Yes.
THE REPORTER: I need to
change my paper.
MR. HART: Okay.
MS. CALLCOTT: Would this be a good time to break for lunch?
MR. HART: If Mr. Drobny
wants to, now is fine.
THE WITNESS: Fine. As I say -- we'll just eat -MS. CALLCOTT: -We'll eat
quick.
MR. HART: What time would you-all like to -MS. CALLCOTT: Why don't we take 30 minutes at the most?
MR. HART: I was going to
hang out here.
MS. CALLCOTT: Twenty
minutes.
MR. HART: So whenever you are ready, come back in.
(A recess was taken.)
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back
on the video.
Q. (By Mr. Hart) Mr. Drobny, during lunch did you review any documents?
A. No, I did not.
Q. Okay. Let's go back to Exhibit Number 6.
there.
Q. And quickly on Paragraph 2, we talked about the first part, and we had mentioned effective managed care programs.
Off the top of your head, could you identify for me what you consider to be -- and when you say effective managed care programs, I assume you're speaking of states?
A. Correct.
Q. Can you list me some states who you believe had effective managed care programs when Texas implemented theirs?
A. Certainly. Arizona.
Q. Okay. Who else?
A. Washington State.
Q. Who else?
A. Oregon.
Q. All right.
A. Wisconsin. Massachusetts.
Q. Anybody else?
A. That's about it.
Q. Would you put California in there?
A. Not in 1991, no.
Q. Why would you not include them as an effective program in 1991?
A. Because they hadn't really gotten
going to the point they are today. They weren't fully capitated at that point.
Q. If you were going to compare the Texas Medicaid population size-wise and demographic-wise, what would be other states that you would compare it to?
A. I've always been told by Texans they can't compare Texas to anybody else.
That's a tall order.
Q. That's probably right.
A. That's difficult.
Q. Forget about demographics. Let's talk about size.
A. Talk about size, okay. Texas ; today, in my opinion, it's the second largest state. It's growing rapidly. We all know that. And I think you could very easily compare it with some of the industrial states, Michigan, Wisconsin is not as big. There is nowhere that you're going to find the size.
Q. How about New York? Medicaid.
And we are talking just comparing the Medicaid j
population size-wise.	'
i
A. New York Medicaid population is because it's really three times the size of
the Medicaid population here. What we have in the Medicaid population here in the State of Texas is mainly pregnant women. I mean, we have an AFDC population. They have much more, as you said before, more liberal population in the North so they have more cases. But I would say that New York is about three times the size Medicaid.	’
Q. If we were going to group together the larger states -A. New York would have to be in
there.
Q. Texas, Michigan. How about is California one of the large ones?
A. It's the largest. But it's twice the size of Texas now with 30 million population.
Q. How about Florida?
A. Florida is very close. It's the fourth largest state. 13 million people. Florida would be a good --
Q. So if we were going to pick out the states that are as large or larger, there is kind of a group, I think, that you would distinguish from the rest of the population,
Texas, Michigan, New York, California and Florida would be in that group?
A. That's right.
Q. And the list that you just described to me as being effective programs in 1991, you did not include Michigan, New York, California or Florida, right?	,
A. No, I did not.	•
Q. We were talking about the second part of Sentence 2 in Exhibit 6, the pilot programs. I believe we discussed Bexar County?
A. Correct.
Q. So we can kind of conclude that line of questioning, if I want to go to your criticism of Bexar County -A. Right.
Q. - - I can find it in Exhibit Number
5?
A. That is correct.
Q. And the criticisms that are made in that report?
A. Yes.
Q. And there was one other one, I think you told me, the fact that they used the
PCCM.
A. That's a major criticism that's not in there.
Q. And that's your criticism of the program?
A. Correct.
Q. The other pilot programs that you -contend were not well-designed in the Texas managed care Medicaid system, is there another pilot program?
A. Yes.
Q. Which one is that?
A. Lubbock County.
Q. Tell me the criticism of Lubbock County.
A. The criticism of Lubbock County is that they are using a PCCM in Lubbock County.
And I believe they should be using an HMO fully capitated model.
Q. Do they have any branch of the. managed care program in Lubbock County that is HMO?
A. Yes, they do. They have two HMOs
there.
Q. So they have two HMOs and a PCCM?
Q. How are the HMOs operating in Lubbock County? Do you know?
A. Do you mean fully -- go ahead.
Why don't you repeat your question.
Q. That's a poor question. From a standpoint of effectiveness and, let's say, from a cost standpoint, how are the two HMOs in Lubbock County operating?
A. I really don't know, because they've only been -- there's been no analysis done of them. And they have only been operating about six months.	,
Q. Has there been an analysis of the PCCM in Lubbock County?
A. Not to my knowledge.
Q. So as far as you know, there has not been an analysis to say that the PCCM has failed to save money for the State?
A. Yeah, there has not been.
Q. Is your criticism, then, just basically you don't think the PCCM type of arrangement is best?
A. That's right.
Q. But there is nothing yet that's
out there, any documents that has yet been published to demonstrate any criticism from a cost standpoint?
A. No.	•
Q. Any other pilot programs that you're critical of that Texas has implemented?
A. No.	'
Q. And then you go on to say that the State's rollout program is similarly ill-designed. First of all, what do you mean the rollout program?
A. The rollout program where it takes eight years to implement this program. As we talked before, my belief is that they should have been able to roll out this program in two to three years.
Q. The design of that program, I think we spoke a little bit about how you would have designed it?
A. Correct.
Q. What do you believe from a design standpoint would have been -- I can't remember if you answered this question or not. So I apologize if you have. You said it should have been done, I think, in three years
completely through the state?
A. Two to three years.
Q. Did you have in mind when you were criticizing the rollout program— how would you have rolled it out? Where would you have started and where would you have moved to?
A. I think we talked about that a	-
little bit before the break. But basically as I said then, I think I would have taken the urban counties more and tried to have a start-up every three to six months of the different counties, as I stated to you before.
Q. When you firsr rolled out the program, would you have tried to roll out a number of the urban counties on the first day of the program?
A. No, I wouldn't. I would have balanced it off. I would have not -- I would have had some balance in there. And again, depending upon what we looked at as urban counties, as you know some of the areas are growing very rapidly in the state, so I think there would have been some flexibility there.
So I certainly would not have ever recommended taking Harris County and Dallas County and
Tarrant County on the same day. No, some sort of balance there.
Q. And with that said, you would never recommend that the State had implemented a total rollout on one date?
A. No.
Q. Other than the length that it has taken or the rollout that we have in place here in Texas -- I think what you said to be the eight-year program?
A. Eight-year program, yes.
Q. And other than that, and other than the fact that there are some PCCMs that are being used, do you have any other criticism as to the rollout program being ill-designed?
A. No.
Q. So it's the time?
A. It's the time and the PCCMs.
Q. Okay. In Paragraph 3 of Exhibit 6, I think we've talked -- we've covered, I think, what you believe then to have been slow to implement managed care. We talked about that?
Q. The next one says the State could have implemented managed care earlier than it did. I think you have told me you believe they should have started around the '91 time period?
A. Well, even as early as '87. I believe that there is -- there was an earlier time frame, yes.	•
Q. And tell me about that then. When do you think -A. I think it would have been possible for the State itself to go to HCFA and get a pilot program in the late 1980s,
'87, '88. And because, as I explained to you before, what finally happened is the legislature mandated them to look at it in ' 91.
Q. When you say Texas could have gone in '87, '88 for a pilot program, would your recommendation at that time for the State to have been simply to run a pilot program in, let's say, one particular urban area?
A. Yes.
Q. Would you agree in 1987 or '88 the I
C
State of Texas was not ready for a larger	‘
scale rollout of a pilot program?
A. Well, I don't know. But the reason of a pilot program would be to test that theory. It would be able to test and see a pilot program. You put in a pilot program and then you see if the rest of the counties are ready to do it. You would have gotten -all I'm saying is you would have gotten some experience earlier on.
Q. And so if a rollout program includes at first pilots of different areas, that concept you think is a good idea?
A. Yeah. I think it's a good idea to have a pilot to start out with.
Q. Okay. In the third sentence of Paragraph 3 you state, The State received recommendations and considered managed care as far back as the 1970s but has only implemented managed care for the Medicaid population recently.
I think we talked about the last part of that, when they implemented it.
A. Right.
Q. I want to talk to you about the first part.
Q. You say the State received recommendations. Are there particular documents that you're relying on?
A. Right. In other words, the Crescent McCormick study of 1976. It's in our -- yes, it's on our list. There were several studies, the Scheer Scarborough study really was the first that really identified it in '83. That's also on our list.
Q. And what did -- that's the cost effectiveness report of 1983, the Scarborough?
A. No. Yeah, that's what it's called, yes. You're right.
Q. And what in that document, what did Scarborough and the other fellow suggest?
A. They recommended looking into it on a pilot basis. Take a look at other states. By this time other states were doing it, and there was all sorts, as it was in the '70s, all sorts of individual projects by individual counties throughout the country.
Q. Do you know if -- first of all, the '83 report by Scarborough, do you know whether anybody acted on his recommendations
as far as considering it and making a determination whether a pilot was good or bad?
A. I don't know what the reception of that report was and what channels it went up or anything.
Q. You mentioned the Scarborough report and there was another report you said first. What report was that?	■
A. Well, it was called Crescent, McCormick and Pageant. This was still the older department of public welfare. It was done in 1977. That set the stages for Medicaid managed care by reorganizing the department so it could handle Medicaid better.
Q. Can you find the document for me, where it's listed?
A. Yeah.
Q. Do you know if it's in Exhibit Number 1?
A. I really don't know. Let me see.
I don't remember what the real title was. It had several. There is a number of documents.
Q. And the name that you referred to it as does not ring a bell.
A. Well, I was doing consulting here
at that time. That's what they always called it. The CMP study. The real title is something else. It's a reorganization of the Department of Public Welfare. I know it's on our list. I just don't know which one. Was it the Blue Ribbon Task Force Evaluation of Medicaid in Texas? That's the formal title, I think.
Q. Okay. I appreciate it. We've got that one. And do you recall in the Blue Ribbon Task Force generally what the recommendation is made in there?
A. It didn't recommend Medicaid managed care per se. But it recommended organizing this department, this huge department, which was going like topsy in the '70s. So it could identify questions and problems like the Medicaid growth and looking at ways of cutting back the growth and looking into Medicaid managed care. Things of that nature.
Q. Does managed care, Medicaid managed care, make more sense if you have a larger Medicaid population? I mean, the more people you have in the program, does that help
to make managed care a more viable or a better option?
A. You can always get economies of scale if you have a capitated program, yes. I think that's the question you're asking.
Q. Are you aware of a period in the Texas Medicaid program where they experienced an overwhelming growth? And I know that's a vague term, "overwhelming." But a period where there was a large growth in the Texas Medicaid population?
A. You know, as I say, I was a resident of this state for a number of years. And certainly in the late '70s when Texas was growing exponentially there was a lot of strains in the Medicaid program because there was a lot of people coming in here. And there was growth at that time. I don't know any other times where there was what we would call overwhelming growth. During the oil boom years of '78, '79 -- '77, '78, '79 and culminating about 1984 when the boom stopped, there was a lot of growth.
Q. And you would contend that that would be the most significant growth in the
Texas Medicaid population?
A. I don't know. I really don't know because I don't have access to those figures.
Q. And I guess what I'm thinking is, that if there was a period in your growth of your program, if you had an overall population and then over a three- or four- or five-year period experienced a tremendous amount of growth, that might be a good time to where managed care would make sense for you, right?
A. I think it would be. I think that that's what's happened now. There's been so much growth in '91 the legislature thought they should do something about Medicaid managed care.
Q. Are you aware that there were eligibility changes in the Medicaid program in the late '80s that increased the size of the Texas Medicaid population?
A. Yes.
Q. And that was a tremendous increase in the size of the population?
A. I can't remember. I know there were eligibility changes during that time.
Q. Any other recommendations that you
can identify for me that the State received concerning managed care?
A. No.
Q. And when you say in that same sentence that it considered managed care as far back as the 1970s, are you referring to any other documents?
A. No.	•
Q. So the documents you've identified for me are the documents that support your position that there were recommendations and the State considered it?
A. Correct, yes.
Q. Okay. Just to kind of jump out of line, Mr. Drobny, if you'll look down to the last paragraph on Exhibit Number 6.
A. Uh-huh.
Q. It says -- the first sentence of that paragraph states, In addition to the opinions listed above, Mr. Drobny is expected to comment and refer to various studies, reports, articles, polls and other research in support of these opinions.
Just so I'm clear, you've identified for me in Exhibits 1 through 5 the
documents that you're going to rely upon to render these opinions?
A. Correct.
Q. And as we sit here today, there is not any study, report, article, poll or research that you're relying on to support these opinions; is that right?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. And as we sit here today, you haven't at this time identified anything that you intend to look at, any study, report, article, poll or other research to support ' these opinions?
A. Correct.
Q. Let's move back, then, to Paragraph Number 4. The first sentence you state, The State could have achieved significant savings if it had used selective contracting earlier and if it had used a more selective program.
Can you -- first of all, can you describe to me or explain to me what your definition is of "selective contracting"?
A. Yeah. "Selective contracting" is a way of -- two things. It negotiates
preferred rates with providers that wish to provide services into the Medicaid community.
And it also directs patients to those providers.	.
Q. What is the difference, then, between a capitated HMO and a selective contracting arrangement?	,
A. Selective contracting is not a managed care at all. It's strictly a method of reducing cost by directly saying that the patients can go to X, Y, Z hospitals where they have a specific charge already set up and X, Y, Z doctors. But it doesn't tell them what of those doctors to go to. They still have a pretty wide choice.
Q. So it's not the home provider?
A. No, there is no medical home or -no concept, there is nothing being run by a system or anything else. And in the case of Texas, the access isn't even restricted. But in the case of California, access was.
Q. So if I'm following you in selective contracting arrangement, I may go to a hospital or several hospitals?
Q. And say give me a rate for various types of treatment?
A. No. Just reduce all your costs by a percentage amount. Give me -- if you want to continue in the Medicaid program, reduce your costs by, shall we say, hypothetically 4 percent.
Q. For whatever costs you have in place for whatever treatment?
A. Right, for all treatments.
Q. And in return for that, then the State or the person, let's say the State, then would direct the recipients to certain contracted-with facilities?
A. Yeah, that's the way it works best, yes.
Q. Is then selective contract -which is better; an HMO, a managed care program or selective contracting?
A. To do what?
Q. Well, you're telling me the State should have moved to HMOs sooner?
A. Correct.
Q. Why do you believe that, then?	*
Q. All right. What's better then from a cost standpoint, HMOs or selective contracting?	.
A. In selective contracting, selective contracting is merely just reducing the charges the hospital is charging you. So „
I	suppose hypothetically if you could get the hospital to reduce its costs enough, you would then get more savings. The main state that does this, California has both. In other words, it has ratcheted down the cost of the hospitals and also used Medicaid managed care to reduce costs even more. So it has used both programs together.
And California's program has been in effect since 1982, selective contracting.
And the difference in California, California has directed patients strictly to hospitals. Particularly in the Los Angeles area where there are over 400 hospitals in Los Angeles County. Not all of those hospitals are on the Medicaid program. So that volume is directed to certain hospitals and it has reduced their costs. And it has reduced the cost to the
Medi-Cal program significantly.
Q. But let's see if I can -- see if I'm following you. You have suggested earlier that Texas go to a statewide HMO, I think what you told me was the best thing for Texas would be a statewide HMO that's capitated fully?
A. Correct.
Q. If that were the case, .does it make sense to have selective bidding?
A. Sure.
Q. Selective contracting?
A. You can reduce the costs even
more.
Q. So you can have -- and that's where I'm confused. You can have a managed care arrangement?
A.	Right.
Q. And then also have a selective contracting arrangement within that managed care arrangement?
A. Yes.
Q. Tell me how that works.
A. Basically -- this is the way it is in California. In other words, you have Medicaid managed care implemented on top of
selective contracting, which has already reduced the cost in the hospitals. In other words, the costs have already been reduced down once by selective contracting and then when Medicaid managed care came along they reduced them again.
Q. For instance, let me just see if I'm thinking the design in the correct way.
If I had a hospital, if I'm the State and I have a Medicaid population -A. Right.
Q. -- I could go to, let's just say, a provider.
A. Okay.
Q. And I could selectively contract with them my rates?
A. Right.
Q. Then I could turn around and enter into an HMO arrangement with them?
A. Right.
Q. And what that's going to do, I'm going to have my selective contracting agreement. Then I'm going to have an HMO arrangement as it relates to how the services will be provided?
Q. Do you suggest that be what the State of Texas do?
A. I suggest that, you know, when selective contracting came out, the original idea for it, there was no Medicaid managed care in the state. And I would suggest that that was one way of getting some very quick Medicaid savings dollars, which was needed in 1991 because that legislative session, things were very tight. They could have implemented that earlier. That recommendation had been around here for several years. If they had done that immediately, and they had done it very selectively as the Lewin evaluation points out, they could have saved a lot of money.
Q. Let's talk about that, then.
A. Sure.
Q. You talk about significant savings if they had used selective contracting earlier. When do you first suggest Texas should have used selective contracting?
A. In the late '80s possibly.
A. Yes.
Q. Was New York using selective contracting at that time?	.
A. No, it was not.
Q. Was Florida using selective contracting?
A. No, it was not.	•
Q. Was Michigan using selective contracting at that time?
A. No, it was not.
Q. Was California using selective contracting?
A. Yes, they were.
Q. In order to -- again in this selective contracting type of situation, in order first to be able to do that, you have to have providers who are willing to accept that type of arrangement? That's a fair statement, isn't it?
A. Well, in the State of California and also in the State of Texas, they were told they had to accept the arrangement or else they would be out of the program. They have to be able and willing to stay in the
program. Some hospitals in California decided they didn't want any more Medicaid patients so they opted out of the program.
Q. And that's what I'm getting at.
In Texas in order to get it off the ground to do selective contracting, you would first have to have hospitals that would even be willing to enter into that type of arrangement.
A. Right, but when they did this in 1993, every hospital, to my knowledge, signed a contract for selective contracting.
Q. When you say -- every hospital in the State of Texas?
A. Uh-huh. That they asked.
Q. That they asked?
A. They were all in the urban areas,
yeah.
Q. Do you know how many hospitals they asked?
A. I really don't know.
Q. Let's talk about just from a practical standpoint, if a town, let's say, like maybe like Abilene or something, use that as an example.
t
Q. Where you may have four or five nursing homes.
A. Uh-huh.
Q. Or let's make up our own town, how is that? And if you go to a selective contracting arrangement -A. Uh-huh.
Q. -- and one hospital gets that facility, gets that contract, let's say it's a selective contract and one nursing home gets the bid, all the Medicaid patients then are funneled through that to -- would be funneled to that hospital, to that nursing home, correct?
A. Let me be very clear on selective contracting. It doesn't have anything to do with long-term care, which a nursing home is.
Q. You wouldn't suggest that for long-term care?
A. No. Just for acute care. Just for hospitals, inpatient hospitals.
Q. All right. Selective contracting then, just so I'm clear, you believe that selective contracting only makes sense for acute care?
A. Acute care --no. In an institutional setting. It can also be used for outpatient services and can also be used for physicians.
Q. And are you suggesting that Texas should have used it for outpatient services and physicians back in the late '80s?
A. Yes, I am.	.
Q. When you talk about significant savings, can you quantify the savings you believe Texas would have received?
A. I can't quantify what they would have received. All I can quantify is what they received in the first year which is in the Lewin evaluation which is $66 million in the first year.
Q. And that's identified in one of the documents?
A. Yes, it is.
Q. Other than the Lewin document, is there any other document that you've seen that first identifies the savings that they received in the first year they went to selective contracting?
A. No. There was no other evaluation
other than Lewin.
Q. And just so I'm clear, you have not done any type of analysis or report that quantifies the amount of savings that could have been obtained if Texas had moved to selective contracting earlier?
A. No.
Q. And you're not aware of any analysis or report by any other person that quantifies that amount?
A. No.
Q. If we -- if Texas would have moved earlier?
A. Right.
Q. Are you aware of anything that prohibited the State from moving to selective contracting earlier than -- was it '93 when they moved?
A. I think the legislation -- it was House Bill 79. I think it was finally -there had been recommendations earlier and finally House Bill 79 went through in the '93 session, yes.
Q. Okay. Is there anything that you're aware of that prohibited Texas from
moving to selective contracting prior to the time that it did?
A. No.
Q. Do you believe that the savings in the Lewin report, that those were good savings?
A. Well, I believe what Lewin said. Lewin said basically that's what was saved.
But if the hospitals would have done this more selectively -- the State, I'm sorry, the State would have done it more selectively that there could have been greater savings.
Q. Tell me what you mean by "more selective."
A. And what they mean too, what Lewin means too. In other words --
Q. Let me ask you this so if we miss some pieces. The Lewin report and the statements in that report, then, do you pretty much agree with everything in the report as it relates to selective contracting?
A. Pretty much. Yes, pretty much.
Q. Is there any major disagreement with their views on selective contracting?
Q. Tell me, then, when you talk about the lack of selectivity what do you mean?
A. Basically what I mean and they mean is that if they would have channeled these patients more to hospitals that have lower costs and directed them and asked the hospitals to make bigger savings -- they asked the hospitals what kind of savings will you give us and. the hospital would say 1 percent,
2	percent and take it back. If they had said each hospital is going to give us a savings between 5 and 10 percent, it's my opinion they would have gotten significant numbers to adequately take care of the Medicaid population. And if they had done that, they could have had significantly more savings.
Q. I mean, if I follow what you said, you're saying that if they just would have negotiated a better deal on savings.
A. Absolutely.
Q. Do you have anything to support the fact in Texas that the hospitals that agreed to selective contracting would have agreed to a 5 to 10 percent reduction in their
cost?
A. Well, they would have had to agree to it if it was mandated by the State, yes.
Q. Well, to do selective contracting, are you telling me that everybody who is participating in selective contracting in the State of Texas now has been mandated by law that they have to give the State a certain percentage of savings?	.
A. Yes, they have. And the thing is, there is not a set savings. I can show you in Tarrant County where the Tarrant County Hospital District gave them a 1 percent savings the first year and zero the next two. It was a three-year bid.
Q. What law requires them to -A. House Bill 79.
Q. What does it say?
A. I'm sorry. I can't remember. Roughly that there shall be a selective contracting program in the state, and if you want to remain in the Medicaid program you have to participate in it is basically what it says.
Q. So House Bill 79 says if you want to remain in the Medicaid program --
Q. -- you have to participate in selective contracting?
A. Uh-huh.	.
Q. So I assume that would cover just about all hospitals, all hospitals previously or the majority had been involved in the	.
Medicaid program?	•
A. . Yeah. None to my knowledge did not make some sort of agreement.
Q. And that agreement, then, as far as percentage of savings was left up to each hospital?
A. That's right.
Q. And so there is nothing in that law that would require a hospital to give you a 5 to 10 percent savings?
A. No.
Q. And so when you mean more selectivity, are you saying that the State should have been more selective in the number of providers they contracted with for the selective contracting?
A. Yes. And the way that works is, not every hospital for the same procedure
charges the State the same amount of money in the same county.
Q. Okay.
A. So it is twice as expensive to go to John Peter Smith as it is to Huguley Hospital. And what we are saying is if the State --
Q. For any --	.
A. For all procedures, all procedures, in Medicaid. If they would have gone to Huguley, if they would have directed the patients away from John Peter Smith to Huguley Hospital, they could have achieved a 50 percent savings right there.
Q. Could Huguley Hospital have handled all of the Medicaid?
A. Yes, I think it had a vacancy factor of about 40 percent at that time.
Q. Where is Huguley Hospital?
A. It is in southern Tarrant County.
Q. And John Peter Smith is the county hospital in Fort Worth?
A. In Fort Worth.
Q. And so in that scenario, then, your idea of the way to use selective
contracting would have been to contract with that -- with Huguley?
A. Correct.
Q. That being the only .hospital?
A. Not necessarily. But at least directing more patients there than would have normally gone to John Peter Smith.
Q. But can you in the selective contracting, process, can you ask -- can you say, I'm going to direct a percent here or percent there?
A. Yes, you can do that.
Q. And so I could contract -- you're telling me then in that example you gave me, my selective contract with Huguley and with John Peter Smith could say seven out of every 10 I'm going to send to Huguley -A. That's right.
Q. -- and three I'm going to send to John Peter Smith?
A. That's right.
Q. And so, I guess, the bottom line is, you're saying that if you start off selective contracting, if you already have one hospital that is more expensive than the
other, if you negotiate the same percentage, the same percentage of savings for both of them, you're going to come out ahead with a cheaper hospital?
A. Right.
Q. So it makes sense to go to the cheaper hospital to do your negotiating?
A. That's right.	.
Q. Let's just, fjfom that example, does Huguley Hospital have all of the same medical capabilities from a treatment standpoint that John Peter Smith has?
A. No. I doubt it.
Q. So although that is a great concept, you might not be able to do it completely?
A. Not completely, no.
Q. And that would be -- one of the down sides to selective contracting would be that in an area you may only have a limited number of facilities or a facility that does certain types of procedures?
A. That could be, yeah.
Q. The third sentence in Paragraph Number 4 you say, The State received
recommendations to implement selective contracting in other areas, other service areas, but failed to do so.
What -- first of all, what service area were we talking about above?
A. What we meant there is the physicians -- expanding it to, as I said to you earlier, about physicians and some outpatient services such as radiology and/or drugs, something like that.
Q. When Texas started doing their selective contracting, what areas were they contracting wich?
A. Only inpatient services. And today that's all it covers is inpatient hospital acute services.
Q. You think that should be extended to physicians?
A. Yes, I think they should have looked at that area, yes.
Q. And what other area?
A. Outpatient and pharmacy.
Q. And to extend it to physicians, then, you would have to actually go to the physician and contract it?
Q. Have you done any type of survey or study to determine whether the physicians in the State of Texas are willing to consider selective contracting for the Medicaid population?
A. No.
Q. Are you aware whether or not there is resistance on behalf of the physicians in the State of Texas to participate in selective contracting for the Medicaid population?
A. I don't know if there would be or
not.
Q. If there was, that would be a problem with implementing that type of plan?
A. If there was, that would be a problem.
Q. And the same thing for the pharmacy.
A. The other two areas.
Q. If you don't have the providers willing to participate in this type of arrangement, it's not going to work?
A. It would be difficult to implement it. In my experience, in most states there is
always somebody who wants to because of the increased volume potential, get into a program like that.
Q. But as we sit here today, you're not aware of the attitudes as it relates to the physicians or the pharmacists or the other areas in Texas dealing with selective contracting?	•
A. No, I'm not.
Q. And you haven't done any type of survey or analysis to determine or project any potential savings through the use of selective contracting in the Medicaid population in these other areas?
A. No, I have not.
Q. And I would assume that you're not aware of any other report or survey that has done that?
A. No, not in these other areas, no.
Q. And when we -- you talked about the recommendations to do selective contracting in other areas. Are there some documents that those recommendations are contained within?
contracting, one today was Dollars, the Dollars, that is when it was first brought out in '90, in one of those.
Q. The Dollars We Deserve?
A. Dollars We Deserve, yeah.
Q. Any other ones that you recall?
A. It could be -- I think also it's in Breaking the Mold. That would have been '91. Both of those.
Q. And there is a discussion. Has selective contracting, does it always save a state money?
A. Yes. Because it's just lopping it off. This year in the State of Texas they're going into their second round. It's built into the budget $100 million savings this year already built into savings. That's up from $66 million in '94.
Q. When you say built into the budget as $100 million savings -A. Yes.
Q. -- what do you mean by that?
A. Basically that the budget has already taken into consideration that they're saving $100 million.
Q. Is that contained in a document?
A. Yeah, must be in the budget document. I got that information from Larry Fisher, who is the head of the selective contracting program.
Q. Here in the State of Texas?
A. In Austin, yes.
Q. What did Mr. Fisher tell you?
A. Mr. Fisher told me that this program is saving the State $100 million at the present time under its present form.
Q. When did you talk with Mr. Fisher?
A. February 1997.
Q. What's he do?
A. He's the analyst in charge of the selective contracting.
Q. And how many times have you talked to Mr. Fisher?
A. I've probably talked to him several hundred times.
Q. Since February of 1997.
A. I don't know. A couple of times.
I really don't know.
Q. And you've called him to talk to him about the issues we've discussed here?
A. Some of the things on behalf of other clients.
Q. How about as it relates to these opinions?
A. No, nothing. Nothing to that effect.
Q. Who is the guy at the governor's office that you talked to?
A. Ron Lindsey.
Q. Is it Ron?
A. Ron.
Q. When did you talk to Ron?
A. Either January or February of
1997.
Q. What was the purpose of your conversation with Ron?
A. Well, I was talking to him about at that time I was doing work for the Prudential Insurance Company in Houston writing their Medicaid proposal for that procurement, and that's when I was talking to him about it.
Q. Did you talk to him about your opinions as it relates to -- what were you doing for Prudential in January of 1997?
A. I helped them write their Medicaid proposal for the Harris County procurement.
Q. When were you retained in this lawsuit by the --	.
A. I think it was May 7th.
Q. Of?
A. 1997.
Q. Had you -- and when were you first contacted? .
A. I think it was May 5th. I could be off a couple of days.
Q. May?
A. May. Early May.
Q. Have you talked to Mr. Lindsey since May of 1997?
A. No, I have not.
Q. Have you talked to Mr. Fisher since May of 1997?
A. Yes, I think I have.
Q. How many times?
A. Once, I think.
Q. When was that?
A. Late May 1997.
call?
A. I needed some information for another study I was doing on some of the costs of some of the hospitals. He does other things other than selective contracting. He had some costing material for me.
Q. At that time did you tell Mr. Fisher that you were retained as an expert by the defendant in this lawsuit? .
A. Yes, I did.
Q. You told him that?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. What did he say to you?
A. He acknowledged that.
Q. Have you talked since May of '97 with any other individuals within the state government here in Texas other than Mr. Lindsey and Mr. Fisher?
MS. CALLCOTT: I don't think he said he talked to Mr. Lindsey since May.
Q. (By Mr. Hart) I apologize. Other than talking with Mr. Lindsey and Mr. Fisher, we've talked about them?
A. Right.
Q. Since May have you talked to anybody else?
A. Other people who are employed by the State of Texas?
Q. Yes.
A. Yes, I have.	.
Q. Who have you talked with?
A. Gee, you know, I have other clients. Hazel Baylor who is with the Texas Work Force Commission.	'
Q. Did you tell Hazel that you were retained as an expert in this litigation?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. Who else?
A. I think she would be the main person.
Q. As we sit here you can't specifically recall anybody else?
A. No, not as we sit here.
Q. Has there been anybody else that you've talked to in the State since May who you have not revealed -- who you have talked to but failed to reveal that you were retained as an expert in this litigation for tobacco companies?
A. I'm not retained by the tobacco companies. I'm retained by the --
Q. By the. law firms.
A. Yeah, right. No, I have not.
There is no one else.
Q. Let me ask you, do you consider your client to be the law firm or the companies that you're going to be rendering testimony on behalf of? Are you rendering this testimony on behalf pf the law. firm or the defendants in this lawsuits?
A. Both really. The company -- I understand who the ultimate client is. The ultimate client is the company.
Q. I'm sorry?
A. The tobacco companies.	.
Q. I think we just covered -- you mentioned a couple documents that you received that there were recommendations concerning selective contracting, right?
A. Right.
Q. Is there any other that we didn't talk about that you recall?
A. No, I don't think so.
Q. And we were just discussing a little bit about other states' selective contracting. Are you aware of any states that
have implemented selective contracting and then gone away from it?
A. Yes.
Q. What state is that? .
A. Illinois.
Q. And why did Illinois do that?
A. It was explained to me that there was a change in administrations, in-gubernatorial administrations.
Q. Is it your understanding that the Illinois selective contracting program was not operating cost effectively?
A. No, I was under the impression that it was operating cost effectively and -but it was changed because of a change in administrations.
Q. Have you seen any type of report or survey that demonstrates the cost effective nature of the Illinois program?
A. There was something in one of the documents that mentioned it. I can't remember right now which one it was. It was in one of the documents. I just don't know.
Q. Do you remember when they talked about it whether they were saying it was
saving or wasn't saving the state money?
A. It was saving the state money. My recollection is the saving was about $100	'
million. And when they had this change in administration, that the cost rapidly escalated.
Q. It's your understanding when Illinois went to a different program that the cost escalated?
A. Yes.
Q. Are you aware of any other states that have gone away from selective contracting?
A. No.	.
Q. Are there any states that do not use selective contracting.
A. Most do not. Most do not.
Q. Of the 50 states that have Medicaid programs, how many do you believe use selective contracting?
A. I really don't know how many there are right now. The two prominent ones are California and Texas, the two largest states.
Q. That use it?
Q. Can you name me any other states that do use it?
A. No, I can't, not right now.
Q. So as we sit here, t.oday the only states that you know that use selective contracting are Texas and California?
A. Correct.
Q. And you believe that to be a good thing that they have implemented selective contracting?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. When a state submits a waiver for managed care, do you have to get a waiver for selective contracting?
A. Yes, you do.
Q. What's that waiver called?
A. It's the same type. It's 1915 B.
Q. Let's first talk about selective contracting. When you submit a waiver for selective contracting, does the waiver have to include a description of the major design features of the program?
A. Yes.
Q. What would be the -- when somebody says the major design features of a program,
what would that include typically?
A. How much -- primarily how much you're going to reduce the hospitals and charges, the cost to the hospitals, what your plans were. Mainly what your plan was to reduce -- possibly reduce the access to the Medicaid client. That is the main reason of a waiver, because you're limiting the freedom of choice. Also, you have to make sure that it's statewide. And if it isn't statewide then you have to get that waiver.
Q. First you have to explain in that waiver the options that will be available to the individual for treatment?
A. Right.
Q. All right. And then the federal government must approve the waiver before you implement the program?
A. Correct.
Q. And in the case of Texas going to managed care in these areas, they have been presented to the federal government and have been -- the waiver has been presented and been approved?
A. Right. They had two waivers.
They had, the first waiver which we have included in our documents in 1994. And they have the second waiver they got this year for the second program. They're starting to implement the program right now in the second phase.
Q. The waiver for the first phase,	,
did that cover -- what areas did that cover?
A. . It covered just inpatient hospital services, and it was only for three years.
Q. And in what geographic areas did it cover?
A. The whole state.
Q. The whole state?
A. Yeah.
Q. And what does the second waiver
cover?
A. I'm not sure. It really covers the same thing because the other waiver had expired. They had to go back and update -basically update the first waiver and telling what they had done. And we have it in our documents. It's tiled Attachment 4 HCFA.
Q. So in the waiver process you don't have to get a waiver for each geographic area
you go into?
A. No, you get it for the whole statewide program.
Q. Do you have to list in the waiver the design features that you will be using in each geographic area that you're going to go into?
A. No. As I remember it, they did it mostly over the whole state because the design was pretty much the same over the whole state. In other words, they were just asking each hospital in each district to reduce their cost by the amount they wish to do it.
Q. Even for the waiver for managed
care?
A. Now we're talking about two different things.
Q. You're talking about selective contracting?
A. Right.
Q. Let's talk about managed care.
A. Okay. Go ahead with that question
then.
Q. For managed care, when you have to submit your design features for your waiver --
Q. --do you have to do it on a geographic basis?
A. Yes. You wouldn't have to, but the way the State of Texas has done it is every time they've gone into a new county they've submitted a separate 1915 B waiver for that county.. They're in the process right now of submitting one for Harris County.
Q. So any county that has a Medicaid managed care program in the State of Texas, there has been a waiver that's been submitted to the federal government and it's been approved as it relates to that county?
A. Right.
Q. And the program they're going to put in place in that county?	.
A. That's right.
Q. Does the federal government have the option to turn down a waiver?
A. Oh, yes.
Q. Has that ever happened?
A. Yes. Texas has had a lot of problems in that area.
Q. And so typically, then, when a waiver is approved, it has been looked at closely by the federal government?
A. Oh, yeah, there is a very rigorous bureaucratic process that they check it.
Q. How long does it take to get a waiver?
A. 1915 B, it's mandatory 90 days.
But that was because the federal government was taking so long in the early '90s. It was taking years to approve it. So in 1991 it was 90 days.
Q. Are you familiar with, and I may be referring to this by the wrong name, but the Borin Emmit lawsuits or lawsuit in Texas?
A. That's not really my area, but I know that there has been a lawsuit under Borin, yes.
Q. Do you recall at all what that lawsuit dealt with in Texas?
A. It had to do something with cost. That's all I remember.
Q. Okay. Do you know if there was anything --do you know how long that lawsuit was pending in Texas?
A. No, I'm not a lawyer. I don't know. I mean, I know it was --
Q. That's fine. Are you aware of whether or not the State of Texas was able to implement managed care during the time period that the Borin lawsuit was pending?
A. I don't know. I don't know the ramifications of Borin.	■
Q. I guess what I'm getting at, it would be something you would want to know that if while the Borin lawsuit was going on, and if it was going on for several years, if the State was prohibited from moving to managed care, that would be important to know, correct?
A. I don't know. Because I don't know enough about Borin to tell you.
Q. Just assume with me this, assume with me that the lawsuit was going on for several years. Let's just say from 1991 to 1993 or 1990 to 1993. Let's assume that time period.
And if while that lawsuit was going on, the State was prohibited from moving to managed care, that would be something that
would be important that you would need to know if we were going to criticize them for their selection as to the timing of managed care?
A. If that was in there. But I don't remember that that was -- that the Borin amendment was prohibiting the State to going to Medicaid managed care.
Q. If it did?	.
A. It would be something you would want to consider.
Q. And the same thing for selective contracting. If the Borin lawsuit prohibited them from going to selective contracting while the lawsuit was pending, that would be something you would need to know before you criticized them as to the timing of when they did it?
A. Yeah, it would have -- some effect it would have there, yes.
MR. HART: You want to take a
quick break?
MS. CALLCOTT: How much more
do you have?
MR. HART: We're getting
{A recess was taken.)
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back
on.
Q.	(By Mr. Hart) Mr. Drobny, I want
to show you what I've marked as Drobny Exhibit Number 7.
A. Yes, uh-huh.	.
Q. And is this a copy of your most recent resume?
A. Yes, it is.
Q. If I could, for a second, I'd like to talk to you about the resume for a little bit. You've got listed from 1987 to present, president IHG, Inc. What type of company is that?
A. That's a Nevada corporation.
That's basically my corporation I do consulting out of as a sole practitioner.
Q. I was going to ask you, are there any other employees?
A. No, there are not.
Q. How long have you been -- from '87 to present has that been your only employer?
A. Yes.
individuals during the period between 1987 to present?
A. Not employed, no.
Q. Okay. Describe to me the type of work that you have done, or IHG has done, from -- in general from 1987 to present?
A. Basically I've been at IHG an independent consultant doing work in Medicaid and Medicaid managed care areas. Primarily consulting with hospital districts, medical groups. And specialty providers getting them into managed care programs.
Q. Okay. Under your --on your resume on Page 1, you've listed, I think, some areas of work or some type of work that you have performed. The first bullet point,
Converted several major public hospitals fee for service Medicaid programs into Medicaid managed care programs.
A. Uh-huh.
Q. What states were those hospitals
u
in?	^
<s
A. California and Texas.
U
Q. It was converted to managed care?
A. It is now managed care. It has Metro Health.
Q. Was it converted while you were working on that contract?
A. No, not completely. It was going in that direction.
Q. But just so I'm clear, when you were working on the John Peter Smith contract, it did not convert to managed care under your - -
A. It was partially converted. It was doing some -- when I came there, there were no managed care things it was doing at all. When I got there, I converted the employee program and some other programs over. But the Medicaid portion was converted after I left.
Q. Fair enough. The Medicaid portion of John Peter Smith's managed care plan was not converted while you were working on it?
A. Right.
Q. The second bullet point, Medicaid and Medicare managed care proposal writing for
several clients responding to specific governmental requests.
Are there any particular states that you had in mind in that comment?
A. It's the only thing I've done off and on for 10 years. It's been again Texas and California.
Q. What groups in Texas have you
done?
A. I did that. That's what I referred to you before about Prudential and Harris County.
Q. What did you do for them?
A. I helped them write their Medicaid managed care proposal.
Q. Were they selected?
A. No, they were not. And I also did Thomason and then John Peter Smith as I mentioned to you before.
Q. Do you know why Prudential was not selected in Harris County?
A. No, I don't. I really don't.
Q. What was the proposal that Prudential submitted? What did their proposal consist of, what type of managed care
arrangement?
A. Fully capitated.
Q. HMO?
A. HMO, yes.
Q. Any others -- any other proposals in the State of Texas?
A. No.
Q. The third one, Develop public hospital outpatient clinics into significant primary care network functioning under Medicaid managed care guidelines.
Was that ever done in Texas?
A. That is Texas. And that was John Peter Smith.
Q. And again, the transition from fee for -- to a managed care program for John Peter Smith was not done while you were working on that contract?
A. Right. That's why it says guidelines, correct.
Q. Why did you leave your contract with John Peter Smith?
A. Basically the management of the hospital had changed, and the direction had changed and I had finished all the work I was
Q. How long after you left was it before their Medicaid program moved to managed care?
A. Well, it was moving while I was there. I think it fully went in there about the month afterwards or something like that.
Q. Who was the contact at the hospital that you worked most closely with in this area?
A. David Wood.
Q. Is he still there?
A. No.
Q. Do you know where he is?
A. Yes.
Q. Where is he now?
A. Deceased.
Q. Who else at the hospital did you work with? After Mr. Wood, who would have been the person that you would have -A. There really wasn't anybody. The closest was Bob O'Donnell.	,
Q. Is he still there?
A. Yes.
Q. He's at John Peter Smith?
A. I don't know if he's at John Peter Smith or if he's at a John Peter Smith	.
affiliated HMO. I don't really know.
Q. Does he live in [DELETED]
A. Yes, he does.
Q. The next bullet point, Negotiated with state Medicaid director regarding the establishment of a countywide Medicaid managed care program. Where was that?
A. That was in Texas.
Q. What Medicaid director did you talk to?
A. Linda Wurtz.
Q. Was there ever an agreement as to this countywide Medicaid managed care program?
A. No.
Q. What county was that?
A. Tarrant.
Q. That relates again back to the John Peter Smith?
A. Correct.
Q. Next you say, Supervised the preparation of several proposals for Medicaid managed care programs in a countywide area.
What area is that for?
Q. What kind of proposals did you -what type of proposals were these for managed care?
A. Basically it was in California in the late '80s. There were several proposals that were -- that were proposed for several different counties.	.
Q. Were they -- what was the type of managed care arrangement you were proposing?
A. Fully capitated.
Q. Have you ever proposed that a county use something other than a fully capitated concept of HMO?
A. No.
Q. That has been the only type of managed care arrangement you have advocated?
A. That's correct.
Q. And put into a proposal?
A. Right.
Q. And that would be an HMO that is fully capitated?
A. That's correct.
Q. For all areas?
Q. It says, Formed hospital based IPA, developed Medicaid capitation program.
Where was that done?
A. California.	*
Q. How about the CIO Medi-Cal only medical group?
A. California.	'
Q. What is that?
A. Medi-Cal is the California definition of Medicaid. It's the only state that calls it something different than Medicaid.
Q. What's CIO?
A. Chief Information Officer in charge of all the data processing.
Q. Was that a position you held?
A. I did that on a contract, yes.

Q. And you wouldn't consider, then, the PPO to be a type of managed care?	.
A. No, not in that --no. I really still don't. That was more of a carve-out.
Q. What kind of PPO program network did you negotiate?
A. It was a carveout. It was basically just hearts. I mean, all we were doing was just trying to get different insurance companies to accept bundled rates for heart trans -- not heart transplants, but four-way bypasses, five-way bypasses and angioplasty.

A. Yeah, 50 percent.
Q. And how many other owners were
there?
A. One other.
A. William McMann.

riTTT T TIT-1 r nivnwnn	a n A A A 1 _ ntr DA / 1 "3 n C \	O 1 & .TCQ-nH’DO
A. Yeah. It was managed care. It was the beginnings of what would later become Nylcare.
Q. What type of managed care program did they have in place?
A. Strictly commercial. They did some Medicaid but very little. 95 percent commercial.
Q. NonMedicaid?
A. Yes, nonMedicaid.
Q. Next, Marketing director of major medical group partially contracted to a staff model HMO. Solicited Medicaid and commercial clients.
Where was that?
A. Washington, D.C.
Q. You were soliciting Medicaid clients for HMOs?
A. Yes, uh-huh.
Q. Did you ever solicit the State of
Texas?

U1
actual recipients in the District of Columbia. ^
(Si
Q. Next, Established IPAs and served s as acting CEO under the Arizona Medicaid	£
program. Tell me about that.
A. That was work I did with the Bradford National Corporation when they won the bid for the Arizona access program. I helped them get started and helped them a few months working as their acting CEO.
Q. When you say acting CEO -- I'm sorry, who were you the CEO for? .
A. It was the access program in Arizona. It was the Bradford National Corporation.
Q. What is the access program?
A. That's their Medicaid program.
Q. Okay. They were just starting it out at that point. Is there a Medicaid program run by a private group?
A. Yes, it has been. It has always been contracted that way.
Q. Did you implement, what year were you doing this?
A.	'82 is when it started.
Q. Did you implement managed care in '82 in the Arizona Medicaid program?
A. For a period of time. I was really only there for about three months. I
just helped them out until they got a CEO.
Q. And did they already have managed
care?
A. No, they didn't even have Medicaid before that. Arizona was the last state to go to Medicaid, and that's when I went.
Q. And did you implement managed care from the very beginning?
A. Yes.
Q. What type of program?
A. Fully capitated.
Q. For a full percentage of the Medicaid population?
A. A hundred percent of the Medicaid population.
Q. So you implemented it statewide?
A. Right.
Q. All managed care for the Medicaid population?
A. Right.
Q. And that was in what year?
A. That was '82.
Q. And for a short period of time, you would have been the head of the Arizona Medicaid program?
A. No. I was doing the contract work. There was other people that were in the state government. I was not a state employee. I was just doing contract work for them.
Q. The last three, any of that work done in -- first, Assisted hospitals in establishing home health care subsidiaries.
Was that done in Texas, any of that?
A. No.
Q. Hospital and nursing home Medicaid reimbursement assignments. Was that done in Texas?
A. Yeah. That was -- I was doing a lot of work then in Medicaid in Texas, particularly nursing homes at that point.
Q. What years would that have been?
A. That was '82. The bulk of it was done from '76 to '82. And below Deloitte & Touche. That is some work that I carried over.
Q. Tell me about that work. What were you doing?
A. Basically we were evaluating the whole reimbursement program for nursing homes
in the State of Texas and looking at what the nursing homes were getting paid vis-a-vis	.
other states. We did numerous studies. We also did the whole complete audits. This is with Deloitte & Touche. I'm going down to '76 now.
Deloitte & Touche had all the	'
audits for that period of time, those six years. I started the program out in '77 coming to Texas and, you know, looking at their whole Medicaid program in '77.
Q. And this dealt with reimbursement for nursing homes?
A. Nursing homes and the whole area really because it touched everything.
Q. What type of reimbursement schedule did they use for nursing homes at that time?	.
A. I really don't remember. It was 20 years ago. I just don't remember. It was a schedule based on fee -- there was some correlation of cost, but I don't remember. I couldn't really tell you any more what it was.
Q. Do you know if it was a prospective or a retrospective --
A. I think it was prospective. Yes.
I think it has always been prospective in this state.
Q. Do you think prospective or retrospective is a better method of reimbursement?
A. I'll tell you, I've been away from that for so long now I don't really remember.
Q. You have no opinion as to that?
A. No, I don't have any opinion.
Q. Okay. And I believe you said that this work dealt mainly in Texas?
A. It was all in Texas, uh-huh.
Q. Were you ever critical of the reimbursement method used by the Texas nursing homes that you can recall?
A. I really can't recall. I just really can't.
Q. That's fine. Under Deloitte & Touche, why did you -- first of all, why did you leave Castle Consulting Group?
A. My partner died.
Q. Then was Castle Consulting Group basically just -A. We disbanded it.
Q. You turned it into IHG?
A. Basically.
Q. Were you doing pretty much the same type of work?	-
A. Pretty much.
Q. All right. You went to work at Deloitte & Touche in '76 to '82. Why did you ' leave Deloitte & Touche in '82?
A. Because we founded our own company. My partner, Mr. McMann, had been with Deloitte & Touche and we took some business with us and we gave all the accounting business back to Deloitte & Touche.
Q. Okay. When you talk about hospital and nursing home Medicaid reimbursement programs, that's again doing the auditing?
A. This is all Texas and Oklahoma, and I think there was a little bit in Louisiana.
Q. What about state government Medicaid reimbursement plan development? What is that about?
A. I think that -- as I remember -that was the work I had done for Texas. They
needed some work on their state plan. And I did that in conjunction with other people at Deloitte & Touche.
Q. Do you know what kind of work you did on their state plan?
A. I just really don't.
Q. Accounting and cost system installations. Did that relate to any Medicaid programs?
A. No.
Q. How about welfare fraud and abuse system installations? Did that deal with any Medicaid programs?
A. No. That was a Medicare program.
Q. Health systems agency needs methodology study. Was that done in Texas?
A. No, that was in New Mexico.
Q. When you worked for Deloitte & Touche, where were you living?
A. Austin.
Q. Austin. Okay. The entire time?
A. Not the entire time. As I said, consult as an expert from out of town. I	(
started in Chicago, and I was living in	^
Ol
.	• T 00
Chicago for a while. I didn't move down until
nnn a a r, nunn/l'JTil 11 A.lCQ.nCDn I
about '78, '79 roughly.
Q. So you lived in Chicago for a period of time?
A. Right.	•
Q. So it's my understanding, then, during your history of employment, you have never worked for any state agency in the Texas Medicaid system?
A. No.
Q. You've never worked for any state agency that dealt with a state's Medicaid agency?
A. That's correct.
Q. I mean, Medicaid system.
A. Right.
Q. You've never worked for any federal entity that dealt with federal Medicaid?
A. No.
Q. You've never worked in any health and human services capacity for any state?
A. No.
Q. Do you smoke, Mr. Drobny?
A. No.
A. When I was in college from 1959 to
1965 .
Q. Why did you stop smoking?
A. Because I had a cold one day and I didn't feel like smoking after that. I quit cold turkey.	.
Q. Do you think that cigarette smoking is harmful to an individual's health?
A. I don't really know.
Q. Do you have a personal opinion?
A. No. I don't.
Q. Do you believe cigarette smoking is addictive?
A. I don't know really what addictive means. It depends on the definition of addictive.
Q. Give me your definition and tell me whether you think it's addictive.
A. I think if you can stop something cold turkey it's not addictive.
Q. So you don't believe it to be	<-
addictive?	®
to
Q. Do you think cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?	.
A. I don't know.
Q. Do you think it causes emphysema?
A. Again, I really don't know. I'm not a doctor.
Q. I understand that. I'm just asking what your thoughts are on it. Let me ask it this way, then. I've got four little girls, and I think you said you have two girls.
A. Two girls, right.
Q. Have you ever recommended to your children that they start smoking?
A. No.
Q. And why is that?
A. I just have not thought that they needed the expense.
Q. So you're going to look me in the eye and tell me the reason you've told your girls not to smoke is because it's expensive?
A. That's one of the reasons. It is expensive, especially today.
Q. Is there any other reason out there why you might tell your kids you don't
want them smoking?
A. Don't think it's something they need to do.
Q. Because you're afraid it's not good on their health?
A. Could be, yes. Possibly. Yes.
Q. Let's just be dad to dad. When you've talked to your kids about not smoking, you may have mentioned that it was expensive but the overriding reason you told them not to smoke is because you didn't think it was good for them?
A. Well, I don't think it's good for their health. But I never had any conversations with them. They never started smoking or had any desire to do it.
Q. Did your wife smoke?
A. No.
Q. Do you -- when you go to a restaurant now do you sit in a smoking or nonsmoking section?
A. I sit in first available.
Q. At your house, do you -- have you let people smoke in your house?	,
V,
C
smoked. I can't think of in the past 10 years of somebody smoking in my house.
Q. Do you think that smoking-related illnesses -- do you believe that the Texas Medicaid system has incurred cost because of smoking-related illnesses of Medicaid patients?
A. No.
Q. You don't?
A. Huh-uh.
Q. You don't believe that the Medicaid system at all has ever incurred any cost due to smoking-related illnesses within the Medicaid population?
A. Now, is this statewide, nationwide?
Q. In the State of Texas.
A. Not in the State of Texas.
Q. Okay. So just so I'm clear on this -A. Right.
Q. -- you don't believe that the Texas Medicaid system, their Medicaid costs have been affected at all by any smoking-related illness incurred by any
Medicaid patients in Texas at any time?
A. No, I don't think so.
Q. Do you believe that there is any Medicaid recipient in the State of Texas that has ever had an illness caused by smoking?
A. I don't know. It could be. It could be. I just don't know.
Q. If there were people in the Texas Medicaid system that had illnesses caused by smoking, wouldn't the cost associated with that treatment affect the Texas Medicaid costs?
A. I would think so, yes.
Q. Mr. Drobny, we've got a long list of documents. Several long lists of documents.
A. No kidding.
Q. And really what I would like for you to do, I would imagine many of these documents are documents that you have reviewed or seen but there may be some documents you believe to be more important to your opinions £
—J
than others.	®
A. Uh-huh.	a
Q. What I would like to do would be
to go through on Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and to identify the documents that you believe to . be the more important documents.
A. Okay.	'
Q. And what I mean by that is, if there is a document that you're really -- you can say to me today I'm relying on this document to support this opinion, I would like for you to identify that document for me. If there is one that you can't really recall why you have it listed, then I would not want you to identify it for me.
A. Okay.
Q. I'm trying to expedite the procedure.
MS. CALLCOTT: Can I make a suggestion? Would it be easier if he went through and identified the documents he's not really relying on?
MR. HART: Yeah.
Q.	(By Mr. Hart) Really what I want,
I'm trying to cut it down to the true documents that you're saying, Jim, here is the nuts and bolts because -A. Obviously I have a plane to catch
here. Jim, is there a way I can take these to my office and fax this information to you or do you want it done right now? How do you want this done? Obviously I am going to be more rushed now to think about it. But I would be willing to -- certainly we have a lot of documents. I know we've got a lot here, and to do a thorough job would really require me to go back to my office and give a list.
Q. Maybe we can do a hybrid of the deal. If you would at this time look at Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, if you could go through them and if there is ones right now you know that are the important documents, if you would identify those for me. If you at a later time can look at them and send me something, that is fine.
A. Sure. I would send it through Cindy. Would that be all right?
MR. HART: Off the record.
(A recess was taken.)
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back
on.
Q.	(By Mr. Hart) Mr. Drobny, while
we were on our break, I asked you to look at
rTT.T.TTP £. DAPV12B ft 0 0 - A A 1 - nPIPH 1 £ ) 0 1 A - 1 Q - DF.PD ( '
the Exhibits 1 through 5 and to put a circle next to or around the documents that you felt were important documents that you were trying to help me narrow down what were documents that you were relying on.
Have you done that?
A. Yes, I have.
Q. And if any document comes to your mind that you didn't circle, would you please provide that information to your attorney?
A. Yes, I will.
Q. And I want to thank you for your time, and I think that's all the questions that I have today.
A.	Thank you.

IMPLEMENTATION OF MEDICAID MANAGED CARE IN THE BEXAR SERVICE AREA
report provides an analysis of the implementation of Manag< in the Medicaid Program. This report is restricted to tl ■ Service Area, an area which includes the following sev< :ies; Bexar, Atascosa, Comal, Guadalupe, Kendall, Medina, ai »n. The primary area of study is Timeliness of reimbursemer tnts to providers, including assessment of the length of tii >s are pended before payment is received bv providers.
hree areas that this report addresses are:
A review of the implementation of Medicaid managed care in tl Bexar service area.
An assessment of the effectiveness of the implementation c Medicaid managed care as it relates to reimbursement payment to providers.
Recommendations for improvements to the implementation c Medicaid managed care services.
INTRODUCTION
[edicaid managed care program has been operational for sevc is in the Bexar Service Area. This program involves usir ! managed care organizations and one State model. The manage organizations are:
PCA----The Physician's Corporation of America
HMO Blue----A subsidiary of Texas Blue Cross/Blue Shield
CF----Community First Health Plans
State model is:
TDH-STAR----A Primary Care Case Management (PCCM) mod<
operated under contract by NHIC, National Heritage Insurant Company, a subsidiary of the EDS Corporation
of the material in this report appears to be quite critica /er, it should be noted that significant improvements have be<
le during the past few weeks. Each of the managed fanizations (MOO) has hired additional staff and each has t rnificant actions to eliminate the large backlog of claims .sts. Reimbursement periods are becoming shorter, although .11 are not averaging the thirty days as required by contrac
irting up a new program such as this one is usually a complic; 1 time consuming process, attended with numerous problems oreseen events. Start-up of the Medicaid Managed Care Pro< the Bexar Service Area certainly has lived up to i inition. It has taken more time and has had more problems t te officials had expected. However, by both type and sevei problems, Texas has stayed well within the experience of ot tes. It is commendable that some of the most serious prob] other states, especially those related to enrollment fraud se appear to have been avoided altogether. Nonetheless, blems experienced in the Bexar Service Area have exceeded ectations of State officials and they are already tak rective measures to avoid them in future start-ups.
ims processing systems problems still exist, but all three MC NHIC have taken important steps toward improving th cessing capability.
community of providers seems to have been divided into binct groups. The first is those who had contracts with one b MCOs. This group was fairly well informed and was able e quickly move into the mode of operation that is required u anaged care program. The second group, mostly specialists -specialists who do not have MCO contracts, did not appear a advantage of the educational opportunities, often did not aider's manuals or other instructions, and typically had n a difficulty conforming to the new rules of managed care.
nunication among all involved parties has improved and there a perception among providers that the MCOs are interested providers and are willing to help them.
Bexar Service Area Medicaid managed care program has recei nificant attention from Texas officials, particularly Dr. E ngartner who is the Director of the TDH Bureau of Managed Ca Baumgartner has visited San Antonio several times during ef tenure and has shown a very strong interest in the success managed care program. Dr. Baumgartner and his staff are \ able and they are working hard to improve management of gram. In addition, Dr. Baumgartner has been quite open eptive to suggestions from providers and other interes ties.
orts to address problems of provider education, support, ment began with the first reports of problems during Septemi Bureau of Manaaed Care staff worked with both providers and
i in every case that was brought to their attention. When 1 >lems became more extensive, BMC staff began dealing in a m< :ematic manner. In addition, staff have cooperated with I tr County Medical Society to meet with providers and l esentatives to solve claims payment problems.
of the more significant events that has taken place during tt n month period was a meeting that Dr. Michael D. McKinney he senior officials of the managed care organizations (MCO) ess his concerns about several aspects of the progra uding the slowness with which the MCOs were making payments iders. That meeting was held in early March and since th ing, there have been notable improvements in the manner h the managed care program is being operated and in t liness of payments to providers.
lly, the most important section of this report is Section II tied, Recommendations for Improvements to the Implementation caid Managed Care Services. This section contains suggestio improvements that might be made to the procurement a Bmentation processes. I am pleased to note that Dr. McKinn Linda Hertz, the State's Medicaid Director, along with D gartner and the TDH staff have already begun implementation ral of the recommendations listed in this report. In more th « cases, they had already begun implementation of improvemen re this consultant had made such a suggestion.
ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MEDICAID MANAGED CARE IN THE BEXAR SERVICE AREA
>lementation of Medicaid Managed Care in the Bexar Service i 1 not start smoothly for a number of reasons. The managed < anizations (MCO) were still getting systems and procedures ce, staff hired and trained, and provider contracts awardee porting organizations such as IPAs (physician Indepenc fessicnal Organizations), hospitals, and any other groups ht receive claims, pay claims, manage risk, etc. Almost hall eligible patients were not interested enough to select a PCI MCO, and finally, many providers were not adequately prepared in the program.
TENS
claims processing systems	of the MCOs and the NHIC-PCCM h
had problems and systems	changes have been made during st seven months.
The NHIC system used to process PCCM and other Medicaid cla was changed to a new system called TexMedNet on February 1997. The TexMedNet system uses over six hundred front edits to validate claims information. During Februa several providers had difficulty getting the system to acc their claims. Since that time, some systems changes have b made and the system is now more receptive.
The system used by PCA was changed in October and the start of a new system caused ? delay of six to eight weeks w claims were not being paid, or were being paid very slow The system is operating well at this time and PCA is catch up on the backlog of claims payments.
The system used by HMO Blue has not functioned well at time during the implementation. Officials of HMO Blue h publicly stated that they did not pay their first claim ur late October. Since April 1, HMO Blue has increased cla processing and customer support staff. They are still behi but because of the increased staff, they are beginning catch up with processing their backlog of claims.
I have been told by HMO Blue managers that they considering replacing the current claims processing systc
The system used by Community First does not currently prcr for submissions of claims electronically. This has slowed claims payment process and has caused increased costs providers. CF is in the process of correcting this prob]
either through a systems upgrade or acquisition of a system. It will take several months for the new system t fully operational.
ERATIONS AND PROCEDURES
Fective September 1, 1996, the process for submitting claims >,000 Medicaid patients was changed significantly. What had i relatively straightforward system became quite complicated rolved several more steps before claims were ready mission.
dng three MCOs and a PCCM, each with different rules irating instructions created a much greater degree of comple: m had existed under traditional Medicaid. As a result, iicaid managed care system is considerably more complicated ficult to operate within than the traditional Medicaid syj ;. Also, while Medicaid managed care may be more cost effect the State, it is certainly more costly for the provide sicians and hospitals alike.
PROVIDER'S MANUALS
y providers did not have provider's manuals from the MCOs eral weeks into the program. Generally, these were special: sub-specialists who did not have contracts with the MCOs. ing manuals available for guidance made it much more diffic know how to operate "within the system." Relatively sin ngs like which PCP to call for approvals or where to sen im becamo complex when attempted without written instructic the other hand, those providers who had MCO contracts in p] e furnished manuals, education, and training, and had a i other start into Medicaid managed care.
is essential that complete and specific instructions nished to all providers regarding claims preparation and ims are to be submitted. A major problem now is that some * e three, four, or more different places where a claim shoul< mitted a .d the providers do not have guidance regarding wt hin an MCO's network to submit a claim. This adds confusion ays reimbursements.
CUSTOMER SUPPORT
MCOs and PCCM customer support phone lines were swamped and tomer support staff of the MCOs and the PCCM did not pro' tely answers to many of the questions asked by providers, me lines were always busy, which meant that more and i wider's staff time was used attempting to get answers tcedural inquiries. Then, once a phone connection was made, deal response from the MCO would be to insist on takir isage with a promise to "get back to you within three da;
ing the first two or threa months, there were thousands stions asked and only a small percentage received corr tfers in a timely manner. Some MCOs used answering servic e had staff who simply broke the phone connection, and all Lp-desk" staff who were not very helpful. They were either Lned, under-skilled, overwhelmed, or all three.
s problem has continued, even until today. Some of inizations are taking the calls with shorter waiting times, f of the questions asked are still not being answered ir »ly manner. This applies to computer systems questions as wi >illing questions.
' providers have had to increase billing and utilization rev: 'f to keep up with the increasing workload. One rural hospii tally doubled it's claims staff; several providers increased percent or more, and the others are paying overtime in >mpt to stay abreast of the workload. The cost of submittini m varies from less than $1.00 for electronically submitl ms up to $5.00-7.50 for a paper claim. Often when a batch itronic claims is rejected, the entire batch will be converl aper and submitted in that form. When a claim is re-submitti i of the original cost is incurred again, since most of the c< ilts from labor.
i of the commercial companies that provide billing services l caid providers have lost clients due to their inability to < ly reimbursements of claims from the MCOs and NHIC-PCCM.
ORGANIZATIONS
ng the initial phases of implementation, changes were sti g made to organizations by all three of the MCOs. Th< ges affected where claims should be submitted, which part of nization should be called or notified for authorizations, i slowed down the claims payment process. Hundreds of otherw: n claims were returned to providers by the MCOs, wj ements such as "this organization is not the payor", mean: the claim should be sent to a subordinate part of that si s organization. Until very recently, the MCOs did not inf< provider regarding which of several subordinate organizati< claim should be sent to, leaving the provider with the prob: attempting to determine where the claim should be sent. ' i have improved this in the past few weeks and now are giv: :ific instructions regarding where claims should be submitt<
ET DATE
targeted start date had been August 1, 1996. When it bee; irent that the August 1 date would not be met, the State dela; start to the beginning of the State fiscal year which lember I. In 1996. Sentiember 1 fell on a Sundav and was a
day before Labor Day. Having two non-work days at inning of the program added to the confusion which was to ected as a normal part of starting a new project.
t doctor's offices and clinics were not open on either of st two days, so patients could not visit either an office o nic, even if they had tried to. However, patients did make o hundred visits to hospital emergency departments (one hund: sn to Santa Rosa Children's hospital alone), and when hospi Ltting staff called for authorizations, they discovered t] f of the primary care physicians (PCP) were not available i admission determinations and authorize treatments. ' :ome of this process was that many of the claims submitted : se days were denied for lack of prior authorization. In rec< :s, the MCOs have re-reviewed and paid many of these claims tl previously been denied.
riDERS
start-up of this Medicaid Managed Care Program has led to ease in the number of providers serving the Medicaid recipic ilation. New providers have come into the program as part ol iician group or as part of an IPA.
providers seem to be divided into two major groupings. Fii the PCPs, specialists, and hospital based providers who h; ed contracts with one or more of the MCOs. This group ly well informed as a result of having been furnist Ider's manuals and some professional education and trainj ses.
second group is comprised of mostly specialists and si ialists. In many cases, members of this group had litt act with MCO staff in the early days of the program. They we furnished provider's manuals, and some of them did not ev that manuals were available until several weeks after t ram had started. It should be noted that education, trainir information were available from the Enrollment Broker and e\ i the MCOs, if requested. Some providers did not utilize tt training.
outreach program for providers should have been more success 1 i it was. However, many providers did not (and still do nc to change from the system they had with traditional Medicai
i providers, both physicians and hospitals, have continued t Medicaid managed care patients, even knowing that under 1 ged care program, they may never be reimbursed, because tl i an ineligible provider, or the patient should not have b< e (emergency department, for instance), or the patient came a specialist without pre-authorization from a primary c> iician, etc.
ling other than education of the providers will change t lomenon. The providers must understand that under managed ca re are patients they should not see and procedures they sho perform (if they expect payment) and that there are : :edures that must be followed. The managed care process is mi i cumbersome, harder to understand and/or explain, and diffici *ork within than the old traditional Medicaid system. It w: :inue to be so until providers begin to follow the guid: iciples of the program.
SIBILITY OF PATIENTS
control of eligibility information is very significant becai incorrect eligibility information automatically causes a cle ye rejected.
rmining and keeping track of patient eligibility is ilicated process that involves thousands of TDHS caseworker sands of patients, and hundreds of medical services staff. A e persons are either furnishing information or entering patie ibility information into one of several data processi ems. Even with careful persons using strict procedures, t ntial for errors is significant.
ddition:
A patient's Medicaid eligibility can change several times p year
A newly eligible patient has sixty days to choose a PCP and MCO
A patient can change MCOs each month; over fifteen percent the patients in the Bexar Service Area changed MCOs in Marc
A patient can change PCPs every ninety days
ihould be noted here that the State has reguested permissi the Federal Department of Health & Human Services to upda manner in which it performs eligibility determination.
LLMENT OF PATIENTS
: of education of patients (also called members, recipient nts) slowed the implementation considerably. The enrollm« :er may have made heroic efforts to outreach the patient bat the enrollment results do not indicate a high level of succes irge percentage of the patients appear not to have understc importance of the enrollment process, as evidenced by the f( : some well-advertised sessions were held with no recipients mdance.
Lie statistical data showed that fifty five percent of :ients actually selected a managed care organization an .mary care provider, it is certainly true that a large numbe: i patients did not understand the enrollment process clearly
ire were errors made during assignment of non-enrolled pati< use of the default process. Children in the same family v ligned to different PCPs, sometimes to a PCP that the family rer seen. PCPs were assigned patients that they had n< ated and in some cases, who were out of their area cialization, and in other cases, out of their geographic ax a number of cases, hospitals called the PCP listed on the d, only to be told that the provider had never heard of t ient, did not have or know of her/his records, and consequent Id not give authorization for treatment.
ients were assigned to physicians whose duties do not incl ing patients; Dr. James P. was assigned a full panel of fift dred patients and his duties are administrative only, ther example, eight hundred patients were assigned a radiolog their PCP.
s explanation is not intended to relieve the MCOs or the PCCM ponsibility for problems with the implementation process, t, several organizations share in the responsibili nty/twenty hindsight says the State probably should not h rted the program on a Sunday before a holiday, and the M uld have been more prepared for the start-up by hav Cicient staff on-board and trained. However, the program eady behind schedule, and it appears that all parties w ious to begin. In addition to staffing, some of the MCOs have claims payment systems in place and fully operational cess claims.
to this the fact that the claims processing systems were rating properly, many of the providers did not have provide iials froit the MCOs, providers did not know what organization 1 for pre-treatment authorization, and finally, providers had a where to submit claims. Further confusion was caused by s and the PCCM not having staff available to give real-t tiers to questions relating to either claims, systems, cedures.
tunately, since about April 1, the MCOs and providers have b king better together to get claims prepared correctly mitted to the appropriate place. That allows MCOs and th -contractors to process claims more quickly, thereby reduc overall time required for payments to be made to the provide
SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC FINDINGS IN THIS STUDY LISTED BY AREA OF INTEREST
LEMS PAYMENT
Initial reimbursement payments were not made on a timely bi and while improvements have been made, MCOs are still meeting the thirty day contractual requirement.
The time period for reimbursements increased from about tw« seven days to over ninety days during the first four or 1 months. Since the first of April, the claims pended time been shortened considerably, but it is still greater t thirty days on average.
MCO Blue is on record as saying that their £1 reimbursements were made on October 28, almost two full.mon into the program.
PCA started off making timely reimbursements to many provid and after two months, effectively stopped while a new cla payment system was being installed.
CF still, at the time of this report, requires submission paper claims only. CF staff are in the process of select a system that will allow electronic submission of claims.
None of the MCOs, including NHIC, provides routine answers claims or systems inquiries on a real time basis. They "take questions and say they will call back."
All the MCOs, including NHIC, have very large backlogs unprocessed and unpaid claims, involving millions of doll still due providers.
Thousands of claims have been lost; some have been resubmit several times and are still not paid.
HMO Blue has, on several occasions, sent reimbursement che at a different time than Explanation of Benefits forms.
RATIONS AMD PROCEDURES
Among the four plans, one or the other has been mak operational changes each week, often without pr notification to providers.
The three MCOs have set up contractual relationships wit number of groups to share or pass-off risk. In some cas claims must be submitted to entities other than the MCO. MCOs need to inform Droviders where all tvc>es of claims she
be submitted.
Effective March 31, the only way a provider can contract u PCA will be to accept risk. PCA is passing through all ri
Claims submitted to the NHIC TexMedNet system reguire s different entries than the national standard format.
EDS-NHIC which is managing the TDH-PCCM model, requi frequent approval reguests for patient care, amounting daily requests for in-patient care, even when multiple d are indicated.
SRAM START-UP
None of the organizations involved in the Medicaid Mana< Care Program was prepared to begin September 1, 1996. Neit the managed care organizations (MCO) nor NHIC, showed by th actions that they had sufficient staff in place and trained perform the functions necessary to make the implementatio: success. In the beginning months, none of them made real-t responses to questions about claims, systems, or procedure
The enrollment process was not effective.
Many of the patients did not read the enrollment packet.
Many of the patients did not receive adequate information training to understand what they should expect and what wo be reguired of them.
Some of the provider 'hospital relationships that w described in the packet did not materialize, usually beca an MCO did not contract with one or the other, or the contr had not been finalized.
During enrollment, there were cases where children in the s family were assigned to different Primary Care Physici (PCP), without reason.
Having three MCOs and one State plan, TDH-STAR, provides m times the confusion that having one MCO and one State p would create, for providers, their staff, and for patient
VIDERS
Every provider I have talked with has had to increase stafl staff time to deal with MCOs on claims, systems, { admissions, utilization review, etc.
Providers who were under contract with MCOs were furnis
Provider's Manuals before September l. other providers not know they were available and did not get then for sevc weeks after start up. Some MCOs do not furnish manuals providers that do not have a contract with that MCO.
Some PCPs are using recordings to authorize late ni admissions to emergency departments.
Many providers had not received adequate training understand what they should expect and what would be requi of them. Educational opportunities were made available to providers, but may not have been successful, or they were we11-attended.
Providers who had not contracted with an MCO did not h provider's manuals for weeks or even months after the prog started.
PENS
All the MCOs, including NHIC, have had significant cla processing problems. Claims were lost, or never acknowledi as received even though a remittance advice would be recei later to deny the claim.
All the MCOs, including NHIC, have had significant systi problems.
•MANAGED CARE BUREAU
TDH-Managed Care Bureau staff are competent and dedicated, 1 they appear to be overwhelmed. Rather than dealing with da: fires, they need time tj developed the ongoing managem< systems that will be so necessary as other managed ci contracts come on line.
ilBILITY
The eligibility process seems to invite errors to be mat There are numerous persons involved including thousands TDHS caseworkers, thousands of providers staff, and thousa: of patients. All of them are putting data into eligibility system, which leads to errors being made, system for correcting the errors seems burdenso complicated, and time consuming.
Patient identification numbers for newborn infants must requested from NHIC by all the MCOs. It normally takes f 10-60 days to receive that number. This means that claims newborn must be pended for that period of time.
should be noted that another study has just been completed r Lecroix and Darwin Goodspeed under the sponsorship of 1

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MEDICAID MANAGED CARE SERVICES
[ NOTED IN THE INTRODUCTION, SEVERAL OF THESE RECONMENDATK ALREADY BEING IMPLEMENTED; SOME BEFORE I MADE SUGGESTIONS.
Require readiness reviews as part of the contractor selecti process and again before the MCO actually begins operatior A readiness review is a formal process to assure that t potential contractor has everything in place and is ful prepared to begin operations.
Develop an extensive set of Medicaid managed care claims a require each vendor to successfully process them through i system. Accomplishment of this should be a go-no-requirement as part of the contractor selection process.
Require each prospective contractor to include in i proposal, an organization chart showing its own organizatio and more importantly, a chart or series of charts which sh relationships with groups that will be involved in any mann in providing services, paying claims, etc. The charts mu include:
PCPs
Sub-specialty groups
IPAs of all types
Management support organi7ations
Utilization review groups
Billing groups
Claims paying groups
Hospitals
Risk sharing or risk management groups
These charts should show lines of relationships; must depi how responsibility flows or is delegated; where authori resides, such as specifically which group or person can ms determinations such as pre-approval of admissions, approval ER visits, and payment of claims.
The organization charts discussed in #2 must be accompanied a narrative/graphic discussion that specifically shows wh«
claims (by type of claim) will be submitted; e.g., to the M itself, to an IPA, to an MSO, to a risk-sharing entity, et It is imperative that providers know exactly where/who to ca for authorizations and exactly where to submit various typ of claims.
Require each bidder to provide a complete Provider's Manual TDH for approval. TDH should consider providing, in standard format, the majority of information that goes ini Provider's Manuals. Standardization would have a vei positive effect on providers being able to prepare claii properly in order to get timely reimbursement. Ea< contractor would still be able to include its specific itei in the manual. The manual review and approval process shouJ be part of the contractor selection process and should I completed well before contract start date.
Reguire that each contractor make Provider's Manuals availab] to any provider or interested party, even if they mus purchase the manuals. At present, MCOs only provide manual to providers who have a contract with that MCO. Many nor contract providers will submit claims and need Provider' Manuals.
The State should prepare a specific set of rules to clarif how MCOs assign risk, share risk, and assign capitation. The State needs to know which groups are being capitated ar which groups are bearing risk, and what differences there az between risk-taking or risk-sharing groups and groups that c not taka or share risks, and nore importantly, how does ti risk sharing affect those providers who are trying to provic services to clients and also do business within thi framework.
The State's contractor selection team should make on-sit visits to each bidder's facility to observe first hand he it's claims processing system is working and how long it ha been operational with relatively few problems and/c complaints from users. If that system is not current] processing Medicaid claims, the State should follow tt procedure discussed in #1 above.
The State should require prior approval of system changes ar require that the contractors give users a reasonable notic before system changes are implemented.
Require the contractor to have well trained systems ai customer service reps (persons whose sole function is 1 respond to queries from users) available to answer question; Call waiting time should be short and many questions should 1 answered in real time.
Claims should be logged in immediately upon receipt by an M not after they have been through a series of reviews.
Consider limiting each service area to one MCO contract one State administered plan. Having only one of each w greatly reduce the confusion and potential for errors ti come from having several MCOs. This will also help redi problems caused by clients moving from one MCO to another
Assure that the array of contracted hospitals covers i geographic areas necessary to adequately serve the cli< population.
Have a full-time "contract management" staff whose prim* duties are to manage the MCO contracts. This staff should trained in contract management and should be responsible I the effective performance of a particular MCO.
Assure that each MCO has its contracts and/or agreements wi IPAs, PCPs, other providers, and all other organizations tt will be involved, in place and pre-approved by the St* before contract start up. Require any changes to the contracts to be approved by the appropriate State contrs manager, in advance and before the changes can be implement* Providers should be given at least two weeks advance notice changes.
Assign all clients to PCPs and to MCOs for the first 180 de to create some stability for the overall system operatic They will have plenty of time to make selections later, should be noted here that the State is currently attempting obtain Federal approval to do this.
Establish a working group to develop a near-term solution the eligibility determination problem. Current problems wj the SAVERR system and the times involved in gettj eligibility determinations and corrections through the syst are causing serious delays in providers being able to file 1 and be reimbursed on clean claims. The State has request Federal approval to change the eligibility system and proces
Require MCOs to disclose, up-front and before start-up, to i providers specifically what that provider can expect, wt that provider will receive, which hospitals he can use, i what will be expected from that provider.
Start-up new managed care contracts gradually (e.g. ramp-u] with small caseloads, allowing time to work operational bi out of the system.

The Educational meetings intended to inform the Medicaid clients of the requirements < the program did not meet the needs. The clients did not understand the program.
When the program started many of the clients had not received their letters. Many of th clients were assigned to the wrong PCP. PCP’s were named on the clients card but the Physician had never seen the patient. Some members of families were assigned to different PCP s. It seemed that the State started the program before they had all the problems ironed out. We were instructed to call NAIS to verify the PCP. In some instances this information was incorrect. Exvra staff was needed to help patients get thei information corrected. Some care was denied, many times it was delayed due to the telephone calls necessary to verify coverage.
rhe delay in the decision as to which Insurance Company would be awarded the contracts hampered the negotiation process. When the contracts were awarded, the :ompany we selected. Community First did not have all their procedures in place. They vere not equipped with an electronic billing system. We were forced to return to paper :laims which required more time and expense to file a claim. The turnaround time for >ayment of the claim was extended. Cash flow was immediately affected.
Procedures for referrals and pre treatment authorizations were much more stringent than inything we were accustomed to under the NHIC guidelines. Because the program eemed to be started in such a rush, the Community First Company did not get all their nformation to our hospital or clinic staff. Decisions were still being made two and thre< veeks after the program had started. Many of the procedures we were instructed to ollow by the representatives of the Community First Company, were not accepted by the Medical Management Company hired to process the claims. There was a lot of iscussion about which claim form, UBC2 or 1500's would be used. This caused a lot of ielay in filing the first months claims and created denials. We did not receive our first :imbursement for services until the month of November. We had over $70,000.00 in eceivable at this time. Since the information on the cards was wrong, treatment was tiled to the wrong Insurance Company. Many of the claims had to be appealed to xplain why a certain procedure required by the HMO was not followed because we lought we were billing traditional Medicaid. In January, 1997, we still have some of lose claims pending.
Ion emergency care or Urgent care administered to patients in the rural setting because
o	other source of medical care is available to them after hours and weekends was a very iig issue. Many hours of negotiations were needed to convince the Community First Representatives that it was necessary for us to treat these patients in our emergency room "here was a lot of confusion in the emergency room. Staff spent hours on the telephone, rying to get approval for treatment from PCP’s and the insurance companies.

[s. Jeane Laurence [anaged Care Contract Specialist ommunity First Health Plans 120 Blanco Road, Suite 200 in Antonio, Texas 78216
:ar Ms. Laurence:
Dr. J.S. Potyka, President of River City IPA (representing the 35 Emergency lysicians of Emergency Physicians Affiliates-- which staff the 5 Baptist Emergency spartments in San Antonio) has authorized me to effect liaison with the managed care mmunity in an effort to clarify the often misunderstood “emergency medical screening amination” mandated by the Federal “Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor :t” of 1986. As you know, this Federal law requires that each and every patient renting to an Emergency Department in the US must receive a “screening amination” to determine whether or not the patient has an “emergency medical ndition”. The definition of an “emergency medical condition”, as defined by the nerican College of Emergency Physicians, (as well as contained in the contract between ver City IPA and Community First Health Plan) is as follows:
mergency medical care refers to healthcare services provided in a hospital emergency :ility to evaluate and treat medical conditions of a recent onset and severity, including, t not limited to, severe pain, that would lead a prudent lay person, possessing an stage knowledge of medicine and health, to believe that his or her condition, sickness, injury is of such a nature that failure to get immediate medical care could result in:
1.	placing the patient’s health in serious jeopardy;
2.	serious impairment to bodily functions; or
3.	serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.”
In the past, questions have arisen as to how to recognize CPT codes used to identify : “emergency medical screening examination” required by Federal law. The information low will hopefully clarify this issue.
__
ALAMO PHYSICIANS' SERVICES. INC.
Correct CPT Coding for the “Emergency Medical Screening Exam”
lie -32 modifier which identifies mandated services is applied to the appropriate level o &M service to correctly identify the Federally-mandated (Emergency Medical Treatmen 3d Active Labor Act) emergency medical screening examination. Examples follow:
Screening Exam
PT Code	Screening Exam CPT Code	RCIPA Fee	Acceptable Payment
?281	99281-32	$ 42.00	$ 10.00
>282	99282-32	$ 65.00	$ 52.00
>283	99283-32	$ 104.00	$ 83.20
>284	99284-32 -	$164.00	$ 131.20
>285	99285-32	$256.00	$ 204.80
le charges for these screening exams are identical to the current charges for the irresponding levels of E&M codes. Since 80% of the work involved in the ED visit is pended in the evaluation required to determine whether a true emergency medical ndition exists, the proposed “screening exam” payment is 80% of the fee charged for ch level of Emergency Dept. Evaluation and Management service.
Charges for any diagnostic procedures required in order to determine whether an Krgency medical condition exists will be submitted at the standard charge for that ocedure, and payment will be at the usual rate for these diagnostic procedures, cample: A 3 jaonth old child comes to the ED with a fever of 104 degrees F. lere is no obvious source for the fever, and a two view chest X-ray and a lumbar incture are performed in an effort to determine if the child has an emergency medical mdition. In addition to the E&M code of99285-32 which is charged for the screening lamination, the charges for CPT 71020-26 (two'view chest X-ray interpretation) and for PT 62270 (Lumbar Puncture) are also submitted. Since these procedures are necessary the determination of whether an emergency medical condition such as pneumonia or eningitis exists, those codes must be paid at the usual rate, in addition to the 99285-32 >de. Thus, the appropriate CPT Codes for the visit described above are as follows:
