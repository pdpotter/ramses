17	(All Plaintiffs Exhibits were retained by Mr. Acosta)
1	MR. GERAGHTY: This is Bill Geraghty, counsel
2	for Philip Morris USA and Lorillard Tobacco
3	Company. I have had several -- we have had several
4	hearings over the course of the last couple of
5	days. There is an order entered by Judge Terrell
6	in Escambia County that addresses certain issues.
7	And I have had some discussions with some of the
8	plaintiffs' counsel this morning.
9	Just to clarify one or two things, we have an
10	agreement among the parties -- and this is set
11	forth in Judge Terrell's order -- that all
12	objections except those to the form of the question
13	will be preserved. In addition, counsel may, if
14	they want to know the basis of the form objection,
15	will ask counsel.
16	My understanding is we've now changed the
17	camera views so that we have two cameras, both of
18	which are trained on the witness, which was
19	something we had requested in earlier
20	correspondence to plaintiffs counsel in earlier
21	depositions.
22	All right. Just a couple of other things. We
23	have an agreement that an objection by one
24	defendant is an objection for all.
25	MR. ACOSTA: Yes.
0005
1	MR. GERAGHTY: And by the same token, if one
2	of Plaintiffs' counsel objects, that's an objection
3	on behalf of all plaintiffs in whose case this
4	deposition may be played.
5	MR. ACOSTA: Okay.
6	MR. GERAGHTY: We also agreed that in terms of
7	any objections to the use of a particular document,
8	we'll state that objection plainly and succinctly
9	at the very beginning, and then we won't make any
10	further objections to questions posed about the
11	document other than to the form of the question.
12	Do we have an agreement on that?
13	MR. ACOSTA: I'm not sure -- why don't we go
14	off the record for a second.
15	MR. GERAGHTY: All right.
16	(A discussion off the record.)
17	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay. I think we have an
18	agreement that we had -- there is an order that
19	addresses the issue of the disclosure of documents
20	we had two hearings on, I believe it was Thursday
21	and Friday, that addressed that issue. And I think
22	all of the dates when documents were exchanged, I
23	think were all memorialized primarily by e-mail.
24	So we'll agree that to the extent there are any
25	objections to the timeliness of disclosure, we can
0006
1	agree that those are preserved.
2	MR. ACOSTA: Yes.
3	MR. GERAGHTY: And objections as to
4	authenticity, hearsay, all that kind of stuff to a
5	particular document are preserved, correct?
6	MR. ACOSTA: Yes, unless it's something that
7	can be cured in the deposition. For example, if I
8	ask Dr. Kyriakoudes about a document and
9	authenticate it through him, which I intend to
10	probably do that with all the documents, to
11	authenticate them through him, and if you have an
12	objection, I guess, to the authenticity after that,
13	maybe you should make the objection.
14	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay.
15	MR. ACOSTA: Unless you are going to make it
16	to every single one of them. And if you are, then
17	let's just reserve that one.
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Why don't we see how that goes.
19	And let's object on a document-by-document basis.
20	If it becomes clear that it's happening all the
21	time or 9 times out of 10 or whatever, we can
22	revisit it. So I mean the intent is not to slow
23	the process down. I mean, I think we all want to
24	get -- hopefully have you get done today and then
25	finish everything up tomorrow. So why don't we
0007
1	play that by ear for the time being, and we can
2	agree to revisit it at some point if it's a -- if a
3	pattern emerges from the question, questions and
4	answers.
5	MR. ACOSTA: Okay.
6	MR. ROSENSTEIN: Can I make a objection
7	initially for record? It's Mike Rosenstein, here
8	on behalf of Liggett Group LLC.
9	It's my understanding there was an agreement
10	the other day -- I'm not sure which day it
11	was reached -- between the defendants and the
12	plaintiffs other than Liggett. And my
13	understanding of the agreement is that the parties
14	agreed to limit their use of exhibits to
15	the exhibits introduced at trial during the Amitz
16	and Hall trials. Liggett was not a defendant in
17	those trials, and we just want to state a general
18	objection for the record preserving our rights to
19	object to anything that's introduced.
20	MR. GERAGHTY: Right. Just to be clear, Matt
21	Schultz and myself exchanged e-mails on Wednesday.
22	I think those e-mails will speak for themselves.
23	But essentially the defendants Lorillard, Philip
24	Morris, Reynolds agreed -- we agreed to the
25	plaintiffs narrowing of their list of exhibits to
0008
1	the documents used during the Hall trial, documents
2	used during the Amitz trial, and all of your New
3	York Times articles. We, of course, reserved our
4	objection to the admissibility of those things.
5	But I think that, unless Matt wants to correct me,
6	I think that fairly sets forth what we agreed to on
7	Wednesday afternoon.
8	MR. ACOSTA: Since that agreement, though, I
9	realized that there were a couple of Liggett
10	documents that I needed to use, and therefore sent
11	an e-mail and attached those documents to you. And
12	so your objection is noted, and we'll just take it
13	from there.
14	MR. ROSENSTEIN: That sounds fine.
15	MR. KOETHE: Can I make one brief statement?
16	I'm Paul Koethe, representing R. J. Reynolds and
17	Brown & Williamson.
18	Howard, I assume that as you go through the
19	testimony, it would be helpful if you could just
20	pass along a copy of what you are going to be using
21	so we can take a quick look at it. That will, I
22	think, help us with respect to this issue of
23	objections, so we have a chance to see what you are
24	using before you go ahead and ask questions on it.
25	(A discussion off the record.)
0009
1	MR. GERAGHTY: You know what? Before we do
2	that, real quick, one last item.
3	We agreed off record that -- Mr. Acosta has
4	told us that he intends to show or use some
5	videotape, videotapes during the course of the
6	deposition. For record purposes, we ask that he
7	play those so that we have the entire snippet or
8	piece of the videotape that's played.
9	And I guess I'm making a request to the court
10	reporter, to the extent you are able to do so, if
11	you could note when the video is being played and
12	try to --1 think we did this in one of the
13	trials -- as best you can actually, if you can
14	record what's being said on the video, to the
15	extent you are able to do so, we would appreciate
16	that.
17	(A discussion off the record.)
18	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Plaintiff s notice of
19	taking videotaped deposition for trial to all
20	counsel of record. Please take notice that the

22	cigarette company defendants before?
23	A. Yes, I have.
24	Q. How many times have you done that?
25	A. Approximately eight or nine times. I actually
1	don't have a current count, but numerous times.
2	Q. Have you always testified for the plaintiff,

18	interviews on Public Radio.
19	Q. Now, can you tell us, going back to your
20	testifying in other cases, over the last 10 years what
21	percentage of your income has been made by consulting
22	with lawyers versus what you make as a college
23	professor?
24	A. It's -- it's about 30 percent.
25	Q. You mentioned that you testified for
0013
1	defendants in cigarette litigation, or on cigarette

3	testified for?
4	A. No, they were not.
5	Q. But they were defendants, nonetheless?
6	A. Yes, they were defendants.
7	Q. Does your testimony about the history of the
8	cigarette change between plaintiff and defendant?
9	A. No. Same testimony.
10	Q. Have you ever -- have you ever testified for a
11	cigarette company?
12	A. No, I have not.
13	Q. Have you ever been asked to testify by a
14	cigarette company?
15	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
16	THE WITNESS: I've never been asked.
17	MR. ACOSTA: What's the basis of that one?
18	MR. GERAGHTY: What's the basis for the - it
19	would be a conflict of interest. It leaves a false
20	impression.
21	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. Interesting.
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. If the cigarette company asked you to testify
24	on its behalf, say in another country, would you be
25	happy to do that?
0014
1	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: As long as it was clear that,
3	you know, the testimony that I have given will be
4	consistent with what I intend to give.
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Move to strike the response.
6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. Have you published anything?
8	A. I've published scholarly works, yes.
9	Q. Can you give us some examples of things that
10	you have published?
11	A. I have published a book called Social Origins
12	of the Urban South. I've published peer reviewed
13	articles on the history of -- or aspects on the history
14	of America in the 19th and 20th Centuries, including
15	aspects of the history of tobacco and of the cigarette
16	industry.
17	Q. As a historian, have you reviewed the
18	cigarette defendants' internal documents?
19	A. Yes. I have consulted the archives that are
20	available through the industry websites and other sites
21	that contain the industry documents, yes.
22	Q. Is there a body of cigarette defendant
23	documents that has been used in the other cases you have
24	been involved in?
25	A. Yes. Cigarette industry documents are readily
0015
1	available in electronic form.
2	Q. Has the public health community written about
3	those documents?
4	A. Yes, they have, extensively.
5	Q. And have historians written about those
6	documents?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. And have journalists written about those
9	documents?
10	A. Journalists, yes.
11	Q. And are there libraries set up in various
12	places to contain those documents?
13	A. Yes, there are.
14	Q. Are they available on the internet?
15	A. Yes, they are, through various portals.
16	Q. Can you tell the jury about how many hours you
17	have spent reviewing cigarette industry documents that
18	relate to the litigation?
19	A. I've spent in my research really thousands of
20	hours reviewing cigarette industry documents. It
21	constitutes one of the most complete archives on -- on
22	not just the history of this industry but really the
23	history of 19th and 20th Century America. So it's a
24	very extensive source in which I have spent, you know, a
25	terrific amount of my professional time.
0016
1	Q. Now, have you looked at other sources that
2	contain information that the cigarette company
3	defendants have provided to the public?
4	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form. It's
5	vague.
6	THE WITNESS: Yes, I have. Many different
7	types of sources.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. And how did you go about looking at
10	information involving messages from the cigarette
11	industry to the public?
12	A. Well, I have researched newspapers, magazines,
13	television, radio transcripts. You know, so various
14	public media outlets in terms of looking for industry
15	statements.
16	Q. Now, when a historian does an investigation
17	into an area like the history of cigarette smoking, do
18	you have obstacles to overcome when you present that
19	information that you've discovered to a jury or to
20	anyone in the present sense?
21	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
22	THE WITNESS: Yes. I mean, historians work
23	very hard to recreate the past. And when we
24	communicate that recreation to the public through
25	our writings, through this venue to juries, to
0017
1	general citizens in any context, we always work
2	hard to avoid presentism, which is a tendency to
3	look at the past through our contemporary biases.
4	It's best to recreate the past as it was as
5	completely as we can based on the evidence that we
6	have.
7	BY MR. ACOSTA:
8	Q. Is there a concept known as
9	present-mindedness?
10	A. Yes. Presentism, present-mindedness would be
11	synonyms, yes.
12	Q. Okay. What does that mean?
13	A. Well, as I mentioned earlier, it's a tendency
14	to look at the past strictly in terms of the present
15	with our present assumptions and biases and projecting
16	those back into the past rather than looking at past
17	events as past actors, historical, you know, people in
18	past times would have understood things given their own
19	assumptions and their own culture and their -- the
20	conditions of their own time.
21	Q. Would you want the jury in this case to look
22	at the past from their present perspective, or would you
23	want them to perceive what you say as if they were in
24	the shoes of a person back in the time frame that you
25	speak?
0018
1	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: It would be the latter of the
3	options you present. In other words, I would want
4	very much for the jury to look at the evidence and
5	put themselves back in time to the earlier period
6	that I would be talking about so that they can
7	understand how things were to people at that time,
8	rather than taking the biases and assumptions that
9	we live with today and projecting those backwards,
10	because people in the past times didn't know what
11	we know today.
12	BY MR. ACOSTA:
13	Q. When you investigate, or investigated in this
14	case, did you have to overcome present -- presentism or
15	present-mindedness yourself?
16	A. Well, I think this is part of an historian's
17	professional training. You know, we -- we -- you know,
18	we overcome that as part of our training as historians.
19	And that's how we approach problems, is going back and
20	looking, immersing ourselves in the evidence in the past
21	so that we don't do what you just described, which is to
22	put our contemporary biases and conditions and project
23	those onto the past.
24	Q. Is there any particular method or is there a
25	tag name for a method that historians use to look at the
0019
1	past and come up with historical facts and opinions?
2	A. Yes. We call it the historical method.
3	Q. And can you tell us briefly what that is?
4	A. Yes. It's the process of going back,
5	formulating a research question and immersing yourselves
6	in what we call the primary sources. That is, those
7	sources or that evidence that was generated at the time
8	of the thing that you are looking at or the problem you
9	are trying to understand.
10	Q. And did you use the historical method in
11	this--in this case?
12	A. Yes, I did.
13	Q. And is the historical method something that is
14	accepted by historians and the typical university in
15	this country?
16	A. It is. It's the standard method practiced
17	this -- by our profession.
18	Q. Now, are you knowledgeable in sub-facets of
19	history?
20	A. Yes. My training in business history and
21	economic history, the history of advertising, these are
22	all areas in which I teach and do research.
23	Q. Do you teach -- are you teaching, you know,
24	this semester as we sit here?
25	A. Yes, I am teaching a course this semester.
0020
1	Q. And what is the name of that course?
2	A. It's a graduate seminar, and it has a long
3	name. It's called U.S. Historiography Since 1865.
4	Q. Now, have you testified about cigarette
5	company advertising in the past?
6	A. Yes, I have.
7	Q. As an expert witness?
8	A. Yes, I have.
9	Q. And have you testified about the cigarette --
10	the history of smoking and health as an expert in the
11	past?
12	A. Yes, I have.
13	Q. Now, do you have knowledge based upon your
14	investigation of historical facts that pertain to the
15	defendants in this case?
16	A. I do.
17	Q. And do you have opinions about the history
18	that you've discovered as a historian based upon those
19	historical facts?
20	A. I do.
21	Q. If I asked you to summarize all of your
22	opinions into one or two sentences, could you do that?
23	A. I could, yes.
24	Q. Would you give us the bottom line of what your
25	investigation revealed about the cigarette company
0021
1	defendants in this case?
2	A. Yes. The bottom line is that the cigarette --
3	that the defendants in this case had knowledge about the
4	health risks in their product as early as at least the
5	1940s, perhaps even earlier, but did not share that, did
6	not tell the truth about that to the public.
7	Q. When was tobacco first commercialized in
8	America?
9	A. Well, tobacco goes back to the time of really
10	the founders -- of the European discovery of the Western
11	Hemisphere with Christopher Columbus onward.
12	Q. How was tobacco used back in the 16th, 17th,
13	18th Centuries in America?
14	A. Well, in the Americas there was Indian uses of
15	tobacco, but among Europeans it was principally viewed
16	as a medicine, a medicinal herb.
17	Q. In what forms was it used?
18	A. Generally smoked in pipes, sometimes chewed,
19	and then later wrapped in tobacco leaves, which we would
20	call a cigar.
21	Q. When were cigarettes, as opposed to those
22	other forms, first sold in significant numbers in the
23	United States?
24	A. Well, a cigarette is a very modem product.
25	It's really a product of industrialization. And so the
0022
1	major impetus in the cigarette is really after 1900, the
2	20th Century.
3	Q. If we went back a hundred years or so to 1900,
4	what share or what percentage of the total tobacco
5	market was -- was the cigarette back then?
6	A. In 1900, an infinitesimally small share. The
7	predominant form of tobacco use at that time was chewing
8	tobacco, with pipes and cigars following.
9	Q. And today, what percentage of the market is
10	the cigarette versus other forms of tobacco?
11	A. Over 4/5. So by far the predominant and
12	normative method of tobacco consumption.
13	Q. Now, before the cigarette was invented, you
14	mentioned that tobacco was medicinal?
15	A. There is -- yes. Tobacco was initially
16	introduced into Europe as a medicinal herb. Jean Nicot,
17	from whom we get the term nicotine, was a champion of
18	tobacco as a healing herb.
19	Q. Before the cigarette became popular, which --
20	Well, let me ask you this. When in
21	conjunction to 1900 do you believe that the cigarette
22	really took off and started becoming popular?
23	A. The big boost in cigarette consumption,
24	compared to other forms of tobacco and in absolute
25	numbers, really comes in 19 teens, cigarette use begins
0023
1	to explode. And it's in the 1920s, the mid 1920s that
2	cigarettes actually surpass other forms of tobacco in
3	terms of total sales.
4	Q. Now, before the cigarette became popular, did
5	significant numbers of people that smoked cigars and
6	smoked the pipe and chewed tobacco become diseased from
7	their use of tobacco before the cigarette?
8	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
9	BY MR. ACOSTA:
10	Q. Let me strike that and I'll say it again.
11	Before the popularity of the cigarette in the
12	teens of about 100 years or so ago, did people get sick
13	from their use of tobacco?
14	A. No, nowhere near to the extent that is the
15	case today.
16	Q. In your investigation of people that smoked
17	tobacco from the time Columbus discovered tobacco to
18	1900, were there reports of people getting lung cancer?
19	A. Lung cancer in particular is very rare before
20	the 20th Century.
21	Q. How about emphysema?
22	A. Yeah. I've seen no reference to that in the
23	earlier period.
24	Q. Was any form of cancer attributable to tobacco
25	before the cigarette?
0024
1	A. Occasionally you would see the accusation that
2	tobacco could cause lip cancer, although there was a
3	great debate as to whether that was caused by the
4	tobacco or by the heat of the pipe on the lip.
5	Q. Now, after the cigarette became popular, was
6	there a change in the lung cancer rate in this country?
7	A. Oh, yes, a very significant change.
8	Q. And do you have a graph that describes that?
9	A. Yes. I brought with me a graph which is taken
10	from the 1989 Surgeon General's report.
11	(Plaintiffs Exhibit 1, Graph taken from 1989
12	Surgeon General report, was identified.)
13	MR. ACOSTA: We've got that marked as -- as
14	Plaintiffs Exhibit Number 1 for identification. I
15	would like to use it demonstratively.
16	MR. GERAGHTY: Let me just object to the
17	record on the ground that it was untimely
18	disclosed. And I guess in terms of objections to
19	whether he is qualified to address the document,
20	we're preserving those, right?
21	MR. ACOSTA: Sure.
22	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay. Go ahead.
23	MR. ACOSTA: Okay.
24	BY MR. ACOSTA:
25	Q. I'm not sure if we really need to do it this
0025
1	way, but I guess I'll do it.
2	All right. Dr. Kyriakoudes, let me show you
3	what's been marked as Plaintiffs Exhibit 1 and ask you
4	if that is the graph that shows the age-adjusted cancer
5	death rates for males in the United States between 1930
6	and 1986.
7	A. That's what it says. Yes, that's right.
8	Q. And would that be this line that starts down
9	at about 5 that goes all the way up to about 83 or 84?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. And so from 1930 to 1986, that line takes a
12	very steep climb?
13	A. Yes. And keep in mind that that rate is age
14	adjusted for males and expressed as per 100,000
15	population.
16	Q. Did you find that after the 1920s, that the
17	public health community thought that lung cancer was an
18	epidemic in this country?
19	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection.
20	THE WITNESS: Yes. In fact-
21	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form. I'm
22	sorry. Go ahead.
23	BY MR. ACOSTA:
24	Q. Was lung cancer determined to be an epidemic
25	in this country after the 1920s?
0026
1	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection. Go ahead.
2	THE WITNESS: Yes. The public health
3	community, surgeons in particular, began to notice
4	the very sharp increase in lung cancer in the 1930s
5	and 1940s.
6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. I'm going to ask you the same question in just
8	a little bit different way without the graph. Would you
9	tell the jury how the lung cancer rate in this country
10	changed, if at all, after about 1925?
11	A. Yes. It increased dramatically from
12	approximately about 8 or 9 cases per 100,000 to about
13	the mid 70s, 70 or so cases per 100,000. So a sharp,
14	sharp increase.
15	Q. How many people were getting lung cancer in
16	the '50s and '60s or '70s?
17	A. I'll just start with the later period. Even
18	today the current lung cancer mortality rate -- that's
19	what -- that's the figure I have in my head -- is about
20	125,000 a year. Today it's the leading cancer in terms
21	of causing death. So more people die from lung cancer
22	than other -- any other cancer.
23	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm going to object and move to
24	strike as not responsive.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0027
1	Q. So in 1900, how many were there?
2	A. I don't have the exact number of cases
3	diagnosed, but it would have been a very small, small
4	number.
5	Q. And then in comparison with today?
6	A. Today it is the leading cause of cancer death.
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. During -- well, let me ask you this. How do
10	you know that it's the leading cause of death in this
11	country?
12	THE WITNESS: I know this from my research
13	in -- you want to know the sources from which I get
14	that?
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. Sure.
17	A. You can go to the National Institutes of
18	Health. They keep records on this. National Center for
19	Health Statistics. An easy way to access this is
20	through the Centers for Disease Control. They publish
21	something called the Weekly Mortality and Morbidity
22	Review. And this is the standard way to disseminate
23	mortality and morbidity statistics -- data -- excuse
24	me --to the public health community.
25	Q. All right. Now, during this same time frame
0028
1	that lung cancer rates went from a very few around 1900
2	to over 100,000 today, what happened to cigarette sales
3	during that same period?
4	A. Oh, they increased very dramatically, both in
5	terms of numbers of cigarettes smoked in the nation,
6	that is sold, and in the portion of the population that
7	was smoking cigarettes.
8	Q. If we were to take that same graph that we
9	looked at a few minutes ago and were to draw a line that
10	showed the growth of cigarette sales in this country,
11	how would that line compare with the lung cancer --
12	growth of the lung cancer rates in this country?
13	A. Well, the lines would have a similar slope.
14	That is, a similar upward angle. In other words, they
15	would be roughly parallel, except that the consumption
16	would be shifted to the left. That is, it would precede
17	that of the cancer death rate.
18	Q. Okay. So if I was to take Plaintiffs Exhibit
19	Number 1 and draw a line on it like this, would that
20	more or less represent the rise in cigarette sales at
21	the same time cancer rates were rising?
22	A. Generally, with one -- one exception. And
23	what you should have done is, is instead of drawing the
24	line to the line of the lung cancer line, which means
25	that consumption would happen after the lung cancer
0029
1	rate, you would want to draw the line before. Because
2	people begin smoking, and there is a lag time, and then
3	they, you know, are diagnosed and suffer from the
4	disease.
5	Q. Okay. So you would want the cigarette line
6	over here?
7	A. Yes. That would be more accurate.
8	Q. Okay. And that's because of what again?
9	A. Well, you have to smoke first. And so that
10	has to happen sooner in time, because the X, just a
11	little graph, the X axis, which is the horizontal axis,
12	indicates decades on that graph. So you would want to
13	have it left-shifted.
14	Q. Now, did you review any information in your
15	investigation that came from within any of the cigarette
16	company defendants about lung cancer?
17	A. Yes, I did.
18	Q. Did that review have anything to do with the
19	rising rate of lung cancer in this country?
20	A. Yes.
21	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection.
22	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: Can I answer now? You spoke at
24	the same time.
25	Yes, it did. And I can explain that.
0030
1	BY MR. ACOSTA:
2	Q. Well, hang on. Have we established that there
3	was a rising lung cancer rate in this country?
4	A. Yes. We've just looked at the data.
5	Q. And did you look at any of the cigarette
6	company defendants' documents with the idea that there
7	was a rising lung cancer rate in this country?
8	A. I looked at industry documents pertinent to
9	the rising incidence of lung cancer.
10	Q. I'm going to show you --
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Can you give us just a second
12	to -- I'm sorry -- see what it is?
13	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. Sure. I think you know.
14	MR. GERAGHTY: We're going to object because
15	this document was not one of the documents produced
16	to us in advance of the deposition.
17	MR. ACOSTA: Yeah. It was on a disk. It was
18	produced. So we have a dispute about that.
19	MR. KOETHE: Well, it was not disclosed as
20	part of the materials that would be used in
21	connection with the direct testimony of Dr.
22	Kyriakoudes.
23	MR. GERAGHTY: Right. And it was not used in
24	the Hall case, the Amitz case, nor is it one of
25	the New York Times articles.
0031
1	MR. KOETHE: And we would object to
2	qualifications of the witness to discuss this
3	document.
4	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. Well, before we introduce
5	this document, then I think I will ask some more
6	questions.
7	BY MR. ACOSTA:
8	Q. In your review of cigarette industry documents
9	that pertain to lung cancer, can you tell us the
10	approximate time frame that those -- of those documents'
11	origination?
12	A. You mean what documents do I look at and how
13	old they are?
14	Q. Just how old they are at this point.
15	A. Yes. Dating from the 1940s and the 1950s.
16	Q. And were those documents marked by the
17	cigarette companies in any way to indicate their
18	confidentiality ?
19	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: Some were, yes. Yeah, marked
21	confidential on the document itself, yes.
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. And what did you learn about what the
24	cigarette company defendant who had a document like the
25	ones you reviewed knew about lung cancer in this
0032
1	country?
2	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
3	THE WITNESS: Well, in reviewing the documents
4	I learned that the defendants became concerned
5	about the relationship between smoking and lung
6	cancer in particular. And the documents I reviewed
7	were documents in which members of the scientific
8	and research staff of the defendants' collated and
9	summarized current research and then presented that
10	in memorandum form, confidential memorandum form to
11	upper management.
12	BY MR. ACOSTA:
13	Q. Do you remember any particular document?
14	MR. KOETHE: Excuse me, Howard. I'm going to
15	object to this whole line of questioning on the
16	additional ground that it's well beyond the
17	disclosure that was provided for Dr. Kyriakoudes in
18	terms of the opinions he was going to be offering
19	in these cases. I just want to make that clear for
20	the record. And by that, I mean the expert witness
21	reports that the plaintiffs provide to the
22	defendants in this case.
23	BY MR. ACOSTA:
24	Q. Okay. Let me ask you again. When you did
25	your investigation about the internal company documents,
0033
1	did you find that any of them had knowledge of lung
2	cancer rates or the problem with lung cancer, let's say,
3	before 1953?
4	A. Yes.
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection. Objection to form.
6	Excuse me.
7	THE WITNESS: Yes.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. When did you find that the cigarette company
10	defendants first learned that there was a lung cancer
11	problem in this country?
12	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
13	THE WITNESS: The documents I've looked at
14	indicate the 1940s, the late 1940s.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. Did the cigarette companies internally through
17	their own investigations determine whether or not there
18	was a problem with lung cancer in this country --
19	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection.
20	BY MR. ACOSTA:
21	Q. — back in the early 1950s?
22	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: Yes. Their--their internal
24	staffs researched the issue.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0034
1	Q. And did they write papers about that?
2	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
3	THE WITNESS: Yes, they -- their scientific
4	staffs wrote, yes, wrote papers.
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. And did they -- through your investigation,
7	were you able to determine whether they told the public
8	about what they learned?
9	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
10	THE WITNESS: Yes. I was able to investigate
11	that question, and I discovered that while the
12	issue was discussed internally extensively, it was
13	not -- that information was not shared with the
14	public.
15	(Plaintiffs Exhibit 2, Memorandum dated
16	2/2/1953 by Claude Teague, was identified.)
17	BY MR. ACOSTA:
18	Q. Okay. Now, I'm going to show you Plaintiffs
19	Exhibit Number 2 and ask you if you can identify it.
20	A. Yes. This is an R. J. Reynolds internal
21	memorandum authored by Claude Teague, one of their
22	scientists.
23	Q. And what's the date?
24	A. Oh, sure. The date is February 2nd, 1953.
25	And the title is Survey of Cancer Research with Emphasis
0035
1	Upon Possible Carcinogenesis From Tobacco.
2	Q. And where did you first learn of that
3	document?
4	A. This -- this is a widely discussed document.
5	It's available on the R. J. Reynolds document website
6	that they are required to maintain. It's also discussed
7	extensively in the historical literature on the history
8	of tobacco.
9	Q. And who was Dr. Teague that signed the
10	document?
11	A. Claude Teague was a scientist with R. J.
12	Reynolds. Spent a significant amount of time, worked
13	there at least, as far as I'm aware of, through the
14	1970s, perhaps longer.
15	Q. Would you look through that document and tell
16	us if it appears to be authentic?
17	MR. KOETHE: I would like a continuing
18	objection the use of this document with this
19	witness.
20	MR. GERAGHTY: And you want him to object to
21	authenticity as well, specifically?
22	MR. ACOSTA: If there is a specific reason for
23	it. Just a general authenticity objection I don't
24	think is --
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Well, let me go back. I would
0036
1	just object because I don't believe that the doctor
2	or any expert is in a position to opine on the
3	authenticity of a particular document.
4	MR. KOETHE: And I would object on the ground
5	of foundation as well.
6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. Okay.
8	A. And your question, just please run that by me
9	again.
10	Q. And my question to you, Dr. Kyriakoudes, does
11	that Exhibit Number 2 appear to be authentic to you?
12	A. Oh, yes.
13	Q. Okay. And does it contain information about
14	lung cancer?
15	A. It does.
16	Q. Do you know when Exhibit Number 2, which is
17	titled Survey of Cancer Research with Emphasis Upon
18	Possible Carcinogens From Tobacco, first became
19	available to the public?
20	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
21	THE WITNESS: Well, I don't know. For me, as
22	a researcher, it first became available to me or I
23	became aware of it around 2000 when it -- when I
24	started using the industry websites to research
25	their primary documents. It may have been released
0037
1	earlier in litigation in the 1990s perhaps, you
2	know, in earlier trials. But I'm not aware of the
3	history of that aspect of it.
4	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm going to move to strike the
5	response.
6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. Do you know if it was ever released before
8	there was litigation against the company regarding
9	smoking and health?
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: I don't know --1 do not know
12	that it was ever released voluntarily by the
13	company. No, I'm not aware of that.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. Through the year 2000, did R. J. Reynolds deny
16	that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer?
17	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: Yes. That was the position of
19	the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company on smoking and
20	cancer.
21	BY MR. ACOSTA:
22	Q. What do you consider to be the historical
23	significance of Dr. Teague's paper on a survey of cancer
24	back in 1953?
25	MR. KOETHE: And object to the -- I'm sorry.
0038
1	Object to the form. Lack of foundation.
2	THE WITNESS: The document is significant
3	because it shows that within the upper management
4	of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company there was
5	great concern about the relationship between
6	smoking and lung cancer, and that it was a priority
7	within upper management to have their scientists
8	ascertain as to, you know, the truthfulness of the
9	matter of the relationship between smoking and
10	health.
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. Okay. I'm going to ask you the same question
13	but without respect to the document. Okay? Can you
14	tell us what the historical significance is of the
15	information that the cigarette company defendants
16	learned about lung cancer before 1953?
17	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: Yes. It's - it's significant
19	because the defendants were concerned about the
20	relationship between smoking and lung cancer and
21	feared that it would undermine their business.
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. Okay. Did you find any information indicating
24	that the defendants were aware of carcinogenic
25	substances at that time?
0039
1	A. Yes, I found information that --
2	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm sorry. Let me - I
3	apologize. Objection to the form. Go ahead.
4	THE WITNESS: Run the question again, please.
5	I got a little --
6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. In your research and investigation, did you
8	find that the cigarette company defendants had
9	information that their cigarettes made smoke which
10	contained carcinogenic substances --
11	(An interruption by a telephone sounding.)
12	A. I can answer the question. You don't have to
13	restate it.
14	Q. Good.
15	A. Third time's the charm.
16	MR. GERAGHTY: Let me just object to the form
17	of the question though.
18	THE WITNESS: In my research, I discovered a
19	high level of concern among the industry about the
20	relationship between smoking and lung cancer, and
21	part of that discussion was -- did include reports
22	by scientists employed by the -- by the industry
23	identifying compounds that were possible
24	carcinogens in smoking.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0040
1	Q. And who were the major cigarette companies
2	back in the early 1950s in this country?
3	A. Well, the major companies were the American
4	Tobacco Company, the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company,
5	Liggett & Myers, Lorillard, and Philip Morris.
6	Q. A minute ago you said that -- well, let me
7	strike that.
8	Do you know how many of those companies knew
9	about carcinogenic substances back before 1953?
10	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form, lack of
11	foundation.
12	THE WITNESS: Yes. I've seen evidence
13	relating to -- yeah. How many in terms of numbers?
14	At least in terms of being concerned, at least four
15	of the five.
16	BY MR. ACOSTA:
17	Q. And which would those be?
18	A. Well, I've seen, at least in the 1950s,
19	documents pertaining to R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company,
20	Lorillard Tobacco Company, Liggett & Meyers Tobacco
21	Company, and the American Tobacco Company. Well, and at
22	least some concern on the part of the Philip Morris
23	Tobacco Company. So that would be five.
24	Q. Now, a minute ago you -- you said that your
25	research revealed that at least some of the cigarette
0041
1	company defendants knew of the possibility of
2	carcinogens in cigarette smoke.
3	Did you find that some of the companies, in
4	fact, knew that carcinogens were in their cigarette
5	smoke?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Now, did -- with respect to the concern that
8	you have mentioned regarding cigarette company
9	defendants and lung cancer, did they prepare any
10	response to that issue for the public?
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
12	THE WITNESS: Yes, they did. They prepared a
13	response for the public.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. And how did they go about doing that?
16	A. Well, they --1 mean, they spoke through the
17	media, newspapers, television. They organized
18	themselves to present a common united front on the issue
19	of smoking and health.
20	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm going to object and move to
21	strike the part of the response that's
22	nonresponsive.
23	MR. ACOSTA: What part?
24	MR. GERAGHTY: Organize themselves.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0042
1	Q. Okay. Mr. Kyriakoudes, who led the -- was
2	there a leader of this group involving this organization
3	of the cigarette company defendants?
4	A. Yes, there was. Paul Hahn, who was head of
5	the American Tobacco Company, took the initiative on
6	this issue.
7	Q. Do you remember what year he did that?
8	A. 1953.
9	Q. And was that reported in the press?
10	A. Yes. At least some of it was.
11	Q. What was the purpose of the meeting from a
12	historical perspective?
13	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
14	THE WITNESS: What happened is in 1953 in
15	particular there had been a number of press and
16	media reports reporting on the science linking
17	cigarette smoking to lung cancer. And in the fall
18	of 1953 there were a number of influential press
19	reports, Life Magazine, for example. And in
20	response to this, Paul Hahn sent a telegram to the
21	heads of the major tobacco companies, of the
22	defendants. They convened a meeting. Most
23	attended. This is in December of 1953. And they
24	hired a public relations firm, Hill and Knowlton,
25	the largest public relations firm at the time, and
0043
1	they forged a strategy to deal with the publicity
2	problem that the emerging science, as it was being
3	reported to the public, was providing to their
4	business.
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. Where was the meeting of the cigarette company
7	defendants held?
8	A. There was a meeting in the Plaza Hotel in
9	Manhattan, New York City.
10	Q. And was one of the defendants missing from
11	that meeting?
12	A. Yes. The Liggett & Meyers Tobacco Company did
13	not attend this initial meeting.
14	Q. Who specifically was in attendance at the
15	meeting?
16	A. Well, the remaining four defendants, their
17	presidents, representatives were the principal attendees
18	at the meeting.
19	Q. When you say the presidents, what do you mean
20	by that?
21	A. Well, heads of the companies, CEOs.
22	Q. And do you know from your investigation what
23	it was that they discussed at the meeting?
24	A. Yes, there is extensive documentation on that.
25	They discussed -- basically they discussed the publicity
0044
1	problem that -- that the link, you know, the science
2	linking smoking and lung cancer was providing to their
3	business. They discussed how this was a significant
4	threat to their industry, and they made a number of
5	decisions about how to go forward from that.
6	Q. Now was -- you mentioned that there was some
7	publicity about the meeting. Was Mr. Hahn quoted in any
8	newspaper reports regarding the meeting?
9	A. Well, what I was referring to earlier was
10	actually Paul Hahn was quoted in national press about
11	the relationship between smoking and cigarette
12	smoking -- I'm sorry. Smoking and lung cancer. Pardon
13	me. I misspoke there. He branded it loose talk. This
14	is in November of 1953. The meeting itself was not
15	widely covered in the press.
16	Q. Did -- did he deny that smoke was a cause of
17	lung cancer?
18	A. Yes. He, in his public statements, denied
19	that cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer.
20	Q. And as a result of the meeting, did the
21	cigarette companies -- let me start over in a second
22	here.
23	Oh. Let's go ahead and change videotape right
24	now. We'll go off the record.
25	(A pause was had in the proceedings.)
0045
1	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. Let's go back on the
2	record.
3	(Plaintiffs Exhibit 4, Document titled A
4	Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers, was
5	identified.)
6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, let me show you what's been
8	marked as Plaintiffs Exhibit Number 4. And would you
9	identify that for us?
10	A. Yes. This is a copy of something called a
11	Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers, which was widely
12	published across the nation in January of 1954.
13	Q. And who signed it?
14	A. Well, it's signed by the defendants and then
15	other grower and marketing organizations, with the
16	exception of Liggett & Myers. Would you like me to
17	specifically identify it?
18	Q. Would you identify the cigarette company
19	defendants that signed onto the Frank Statement to
20	Cigarette Smokers?
21	A. The American Tobacco Company, Philip Morris
22	Company, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the
23	P. Lorillard Company, Brown & Williamson Tobacco
24	Company, and then additionally, Benson & Hedges, the
25	Burley Auction Warehouse Association and other such
0046
1	organizations.
2	Q. In a nutshell, what is the Frank Statement
3	about?
4	A. Well, the Frank Statement is the first product
5	of the meeting that we just discussed a moment ago. It
6	is the statement of the position of the -- of the
7	industry as a whole, including the defendants here in
8	this case, as to the truth of the matter on smoking and
9	lung cancer.
10	Q. Now, why did that document come about?
11	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form. Lack of
12	foundation. Speculation.
13	THE WITNESS: This document came about from
14	the suggestion of the public relations counsel that
15	was hired by the collected heads of the tobacco
16	companies at their meetings in December of 1953,
17	and it came about as a way to provide a public
18	statement as to their position on smoking and
19	health -- and that is, smoking was not dangerous --
20	and to announce that, because the health of the
21	public was of paramount importance, to use their
22	language, that they were going to initiate a
23	scientific research program that would get to the
24	truth of the matter, and that this research program
25	was called the Tobacco Industry Research Council,
0047
1	and that this -- this organization founded by the
2	industry would engage in objective scientific
3	research to discover the truth.
4	MR. GERAGHTY: Let me move to strike the
5	response.
6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. Did this Frank Statement come about as a
8	result of the meeting that Mr. Hahn conducted in 1953?
9	A. Yeah. That's what I was referring to when I
10	gave my answer. Yes, the meeting convened by Paul Hahn
11	and attended by most of the tobacco industry.
12	Q. And was the Frank Statement a response to
13	publicity about lung cancer at the time?
14	A. Yes. It was a response, yes, to the public
15	information linking -- accusations linking lung cancer
16	and smoking.
17	Q. And specifically, was it the cigarette company
18	defendants' response?
19	A. Yes. It was the defendants in this -- in this
20	case.
21	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form of that
22	last question.
23	BY MR. ACOSTA:
24	Q. Now, this Frank Statement, was it published?
25	A. It was published widely in newspapers and then
0048
1	also distributed as a free-standing flyer.
2	Q. And how many publications carried the Frank
3	Statement?
4	A. It was published in 448 newspapers across the
5	country.
6	Q. Was it published on the same day?
7	A. Yes, all on the same day, January 4th, 1953.
8	Q. Was there any market in the United States that
9	wasn't covered by those newspapers?
10	A. By design, they reached every market in the
11	country with a population of 50,000 and above. So it
12	covered the entire country.
13	Q. Did they also send any copies to anyone?
14	A. Yeah. They mailed out a huge number of the
15	copies --1 forget the exact number -- hundreds of
16	thousands of copies to doctors and political leaders and
17	really anybody that they could get.
18	Q. All right.
19	A. Widely distributed.
20	Q. Let's put this up. Do you have a copy there
21	that you can read from?
22	A. Yes. It's a little difficult to --
23	Q. Would you read the first paragraph there?
24	A. The first paragraph states, Recent reports on
25	experiments with mice have given wide publicity to a
0049
1	theory that cigarette smoking is in some way linked with
2	lung cancer in human beings.
3	Q. Now, down below that, do they indicate whether
4	or not they feel cigarette smoking caused lung cancer?
5	A. Well, their position is summarized a couple of
6	paragraphs below, yes.
7	Q. And what do they say?
8	A. Well, Item Number 1, that medical research of
9	recent years indicates many possible causes of lung
10	cancer. There is no agreement among the authorities
11	regarding what the cause is. And then they state that
12	there is no proof that cigarette smoking is one of the
13	causes.
14	Q. And below that, do they tell people that they
15	accept an interest in their health?
16	A. Yes. They say we accept an interest in
17	people's health as a basic responsibility paramount to
18	every other consideration in our business, and that we
19	believe the products we make are not injurious to
20	health.
21	Q. And then what do they go on to promise in this
22	Frank Statement?
23	A. Well, to summarize it, they basically promised
24	to support a research program and to work with
25	scientists and public health community to arrive at the
0050
1	true cause of cancer.
2	Q. Okay. Now, would you compare for us the Frank
3	Statement information with the internal information that
4	your investigation revealed that the cigarette companies
5	had about smoking and cancer?
6	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
7	THE WITNESS: Yes. Basically, the Frank
8	Statement does not tell the truth as to what was
9	circulating in terms of information within the
10	industry.
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. In what way?
13	MR. GERAGHTY: Let me move to strike the
14	response. Thank you.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. In what way did the Frank Statement not tell
17	the truth?
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: Well, in reading the Frank
20	Statement, one can be left with the impression
21	that -- that the industry has no evidence that
22	cigarettes are harmful; that they believe that they
23	are not harmful; that they are, in fact, safe. But
24	there is a significant amount of internal
25	discussion, as we referred to earlier, that shows
0051
1	that, in fact, they were deeply concerned about the
2	role that cigarettes played in causing lung cancer.
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. Back in 1954 -- by the way, is that the date
5	of the Frank Statement?
6	A. January 4th, 1954. Yes, it is.
7	Q. In 1954 and 1955, did the cigarette companies
8	ever agree that smoke was a cause of lung cancer?
9	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
10	THE WITNESS: Do you mean in terms of public
11	statements?
12	BY MR. ACOSTA:
13	Q. Yes.
14	A. I've seen no public statements to that effect.
15	No, they did not. And, in fact, they vociferously
16	disagreed with the position that cigarettes caused
17	disease.
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection and move to strike
19	the last response.
20	BY MR. ACOSTA:
21	Q. Was the companies -- the company defendants'
22	statements in the Frank Statement consistent with what
23	they knew internally?
24	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
25	MR. KOETHE: Lack of foundation, speculation.
0052
1	THE WITNESS: No.
2	MR. KOETHE: I'm sorry.
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. Well, let's do that again, because we had some
5	objections and sort of talked over one another.
6	Subject to your objections.
7	Dr. Kyriakoudes, were the statements made by
8	the cigarette company defendants in the Frank Statement
9	consistent with what the defendants actually knew at the
10	time?
11	A. No.
12	Q. Now, was this Frank Statement created as an
13	agreement?
14	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
15	THE WITNESS: Well, it is among many parties.
16	BY MR. ACOSTA:
17	Q. Okay. Who is it an agreement among?
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
19	THE WITNESS: Well, I see the Frank Statement
20	as fundamentally an agreement between the tobacco
21	industry and the American public.
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. Did the --
24	MR. GERAGHTY: I move to strike the response.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0053
1	Q. Did the cigarette company defendants agree
2	among themselves to create the Frank Statement?
3	A. Yeah. They agreed among themselves, yes.
4	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection. Sorry.
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. And did the cigarette company defendants agree
7	to provide the information that is contained in the
8	Frank Statement?
9	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
10	THE WITNESS: They did, yes.
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. And how do you know that they agreed to
13	provide the information that's contained in the Frank
14	Statement?
15	A. Well, I've reviewed the primary sources, the
16	manuscript sources related to this meeting and the
17	formation of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee --
18	or I'm sorry, Research Council.
19	Q. Does history tell us that people died as a
20	result of what was stated in the Frank Statement?
21	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
22	THE WITNESS: Yes.
23	BY MR. ACOSTA:
24	Q. Can you give us some idea of how many smokers
25	have died since 1953 as a result of smoking defendants'
0054
1	cigarettes?
2	A. I can. A rough estimate would be in
3	approximately the 15 to 18 million figure. Certainly 12
4	million deaths since 1964. The 10 preceding years would
5	add to that.
6	Q. Now, did part of that Frank Statement indicate
7	to the public that the cigarette industry would set up a
8	research board or research facility?
9	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
10	THE WITNESS: Yes. They set up a mechanism
11	for funding research into the question of smoking
12	and health.
13	BY MR. ACOSTA:
14	Q. Did the cigarette company defendants ever --
15	I'm going ask you the question a different way. Did the
16	cigarette company defendants ever promise that they
17	would do research on the issue of smoking and health and
18	tell the public that that's what they were going to do?
19	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
20	MR. KOETHE: Objection.
21	THE WITNESS: Yes, they did.
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. And did they do that in the Frank Statement?
24	A. They -- yes. They expressed that intention to
25	support research in the Frank Statement, and then they
0055
1	did that.
2	Q. Did they -- they hired distinguished
3	scientists to do research?
4	A. Yes. They set up something called a
5	Scientific Advisory Board chaired by a scientist of
6	national renown, Clarence Cook Little. And this board
7	acted as a kind of a grant -- granting agency for
8	disbursing Tobacco Industry Research Council research
9	funds.
10	Q. Can you tell us just briefly how this grant
11	process works?
12	A. Yes. People would apply to the TIRC. The
13	TIRC also would identify people they were interested in
14	conducting research. And they would then fund some or
15	all of that research.
16	Q. And tell us what TIRC stands for.
17	A. Oh. Tobacco Industry Research Council.
18	Q. And is that the committee that was set up to
19	do research at the behest of the cigarette company
20	defendants in this case?
21	A. Yes.
22	MR. KOETHE: Objection.
23	THE WITNESS: That was the organization that
24	essentially sponsored the Frank Statement, grew out
25	of the meetings that we talked about earlier. And
0056
1	they -- they largely funded research. That was
2	their principal role.
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. Now, again, was Liggett & Myers involved in
5	this at that time?
6	A. Not at this time, no.
7	Q. Did they become involved in it later?
8	A. They did.
9	MR. KOETHE: Objection.
10	THE WITNESS: Yes, they did later become
11	involved.
12	BY MR. ACOSTA:
13	Q. Did the cigarette company defendants, when
14	Liggett & Myers was involved, pay for the research that
15	these grantees did?
16	MR. KOETHE: Objection.
17	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
18	THE WITNESS: Yes, yes. The TIRC itself was
19	funded by contributions from the cigarette
20	manufacturers.
21	BY MR. ACOSTA:
22	Q. And when it started before Liggett & Myers got
23	involved, did the companies pay for the research that
24	was done?
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
0057
1	THE WITNESS: Yes, they - they all
2	contributed funds that went into the TIRC and then
3	were disbursed to researchers.
4	BY MR. ACOSTA:
5	Q. Did the Tobacco Industry Research Committee
6	ever change its name?
7	A. Yes. Later in the 1960s it changed its name
8	to Council on Tobacco Research, or known more popularly
9	as CTR.
10	Q. Did the TIRC or CTR, this research group,
11	funded by the cigarette company defendants, did they
12	ever make public research that was funded by the
13	cigarette companies that found that smoking caused
14	cancer?
15	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
16	THE WITNESS: I've not seen -- I've not seen
17	any reports or statements by the TIRC that ever
18	pointed to their own research that identified
19	smoking as a cause of lung cancer. No, I've not
20	seen that.
21	BY MR. ACOSTA:
22	Q. Did you ever see the cigarette company
23	defendants point to TIRC -- excuse me. Did you ever see
24	the TIRC or CTR companies referenced by the cigarette
25	industry as doing research which found that smoking
0058
1	caused cancer?
2	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
3	THE WITNESS: No, I've never seen statements
4	to that effect.
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. Now, from 1954 up through let's say 1990, did
7	the cigarette company defendants ever publish anything
8	or make public any information that their research had
9	found cigarette smoking caused cancer?
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: In my extensive review of their
12	public statements in the media, their own press
13	releases and the like, I've never seen them during
14	that time period make a statement that cigarettes
15	were in any way the cause of any disease.
16	(Plaintiffs Exhibit 38, Letter from Jo F.
17	Spach to the Principal of the Willow Ridge
18	Elementary School, was identified.)
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. Okay. Let me show you what's been marked as
21	Plaintiffs Exhibit 38. Would you identify that for us?
22	A. Yes.
23	MR. KOETHE: I'm going to object to the use of
24	this document as not previously disclosed or part
25	of the Hall/Amitz disclosure that was agreed to in
0059
1	advance of this deposition.
2	THE WITNESS: It was all the material I gave
3	them in the depo.
4	BY MR. ACOSTA:
5	Q. Yeah, I know.
6	A. Okay.
7	Q. Let me ask you, can you identify Plaintiffs
8	Exhibit Number 38?
9	A. Yes, I can identify this. Yes.
10	Q. And tell us what it is.
11	A. This is a consumer response letter from a
12	woman named Jo F. Spach, S-P-A-C-H, who is identified as
13	manager of public information in the Public Relations
14	Department at the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in
15	Winston-Salem, North Carolina, to the principal of
16	Willow Ridge Elementary School in Amherst, New York.
17	And it's written in response to an inquiry by the fifth
18	grade class at that school.
19	Q. What is the date?
20	A. And the date is January 11th, 1990.
21	Q. Have you seen that document in the past?
22	A. Oh, yes, I have.
23	Q. In doing your own research, did you find that
24	document among R. J. Reynolds' documents?
25	A. Yes. These are -- this document is contained
0060
1	within the R. J. Reynolds document archive.
2	Q. And are there other similar letters written by
3	Ms. Spach?
4	A. Yes, there's letters -- this type of consumer
5	response letter is a common -- they are commonly found
6	in the R. J. Reynolds archive. Not all of them are
7	written by this particular individual, but they are
8	written by other public relations and public information
9	officers in the company. There are many consumer
10	information letters in the archive.
11	Q. Was Ms. Spach in management?
12	A. Well, she is identified as manager of public
13	information, yes. So she's a manager.
14	Q. And does the document that I handed you appear
15	to be authentic?
16	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form. Lack of
17	foundation.
18	THE WITNESS: Yes. I've seen this document in
19	the R. J. Reynolds archive. It's authentic.
20	BY MR. ACOSTA:
21	Q. Now, before I ask you any questions about the
22	document, I want to ask you some other questions first.
23	Dr. Kyriakoudes, between 1954 and 1990, did you find in
24	your research and investigation that the cigarette
25	industry had ever revealed to the public that cigarette
0061
1	smoking was a cause of cancer?
2	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
3	THE WITNESS: No. I've not found any -- any
4	indication or any public statement.
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. And did the cigarette companies during that
7	time period tell the public that they were responsible
8	for extensive research that was being done on the
9	subject of cigarette smoking and lung cancer?
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: Yes. The industry often -- the
12	defendants often made statement that they were
13	essentially working on the problem, that they were
14	sponsoring a massive research effort.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. I'm going to ask you that question again, too.
17	Between 1954 and 1990, did the cigarette companies
18	reveal to the public that they had been responsible for
19	any research on the subject of smoking and health?
20	MR. GERAGHTY: Object to the form.
21	THE WITNESS: Yes. They did indicate that
22	they were conducting research on smoking and
23	health.
24	BY MR. ACOSTA:
25	Q. And during that same time frame, did they ever
0062
1	reveal that they had learned through their research that
2	smoking was a cause of lung cancer?
3	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form. Lack of
4	foundation.
5	THE WITNESS: No.
6	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm sorry. Overbroad.
7	THE WITNESS: No, I've never seen a statement
8	made by the industry indicating that their
9	research, or any other research for that matter,
10	indicated in their mind a link between cigarette
11	smoking and any disease, including lung cancer.
12	BY MR. ACOSTA:
13	Q. Between 1954 and 1990, did the cigarette
14	company defendants ever admit that cigarette smoking
15	caused lung cancer?
16	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
17	THE WITNESS: No, they never made an admission
18	that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. Now, did the cigarette companies ever tell
21	people about their research over the years, specifically
22	around the 1990 time frame?
23	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
24	THE WITNESS: Yes, they did talk about their
25	research.
0063
1	BY MR. ACOSTA:
2	Q. What did the cigarette companies reveal to the
3	public about the research that they had been conducting
4	on the issue of smoking and health?
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
6	THE WITNESS: They told the public that they
7	were working and investigating the healthfulness of
8	cigarettes and had through their research not found
9	anything indicating that cigarettes were dangerous
10	or caused disease.
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. Did they tell the public how much money they
13	spent doing that?
14	A. Yes.
15	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
16	THE WITNESS: Often. A hundred million
17	dollars or more. Yes.
18	BY MR. ACOSTA:
19	Q. Can you compare how much money they spent on
20	research with how much money they spent advertising?
21	A. Well, by the early --
22	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm just going to object to the
23	form of the question. Excuse me.
24	THE WITNESS: In the '50s, '60s, '70s and
25	'80s, during that period the industry spent
0064
1	approximately $100 million through this research
2	program we have been talking about. And by the
3	early 1990s I believe they were spending a couple
4	of billion a year on various advertising efforts.
5	So the advertising expenditures dwarfed the
6	expenditures on — on research.
7	BY MR. ACOSTA:
8	Q. In the 1990 time frame, did the cigarette
9	companies direct any information to school children?
10	A. They did, yes.
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection.
12	MR. KOETHE: Objection.
13	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. Excuse me. During the early 1990s, did the
16	cigarette company defendants, any of them, direct
17	information to school children?
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: Yes, they did. Yes, they did.
20	MR. GERAGHTY: If you could just pause a
21	second so we could object.
22	THE WITNESS: Okay. Yeah. I don't mean to be
23	fighting with you.
24	MR. GERAGHTY: That's okay. But I think
25	Howard obviously wants your answer and not me and
0065
I	you talking over one another. So --
2	BY MR. ACOSTA:
3	Q. Yeah. It sounds like they are going to object
4	every question. So you might as well just --
5	A. All right. So I'll just pause. Okay. I
6	thought -- see, I thought when you got the first
7	objection in, and then you were reasking the question, I
8	could just answer it. But I see what the --
9	Q. Okay.
10	A. I see what the deal is now.
II	Q. Okay. Subject to their objection, I'm going
12	to ask you the question again.
13	So you guys don't object subject to the last
14	objection.
15	During the early 1990s, did the cigarette
16	company defendants or any of them in this case direct
17	information about smoking and health to school children?
18	A. Yes, they did.
19	Q. And what kind of information did they direct
20	to school children?
21	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
22	THE WITNESS: The information they directed
23	was that smoking was not implicated in any harmful
24	disease, and that the tobacco industry was
25	sponsoring a significant research program to
0066
1	discover the true cause of disease.
2	BY MR. ACOSTA:
3	Q. Now, tell us about Exhibit Number 38, the
4	letter that was written by the RJR manager Joe Spach.
5	Did it direct smoking and health information to school
6	children?
7	A. Yes, it did.
8	Q. And what did the manager of public relations
9	at RJR, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, want the
10	children to know?
11	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
12	THE WITNESS: Well, they wanted - R. J.
13	Reynolds wanted the students at the Willow Ridge
14	School to know that the tobacco industry was
15	concerned about the charges being made that smoking
16	was the cause of disease; that through the Counsel
17	of Tobacco Research and through its grants to the
18	American Medical Association, that they were
19	sponsoring research in excess of $162,000,000 to
20	independent research on the controversy surrounding
21	smoking. Despite -- and it also wanted them to
22	know that despite all this research, scientists do
23	not know the causes of chronic disease associated
24	with smoking; and that there are many unanswered
25	controversies surrounding smoking; that it's only
0067
1	statistically associated; and that more research
2	needs to be done before we can know if smoke is in
3	any way connected with disease.
4	BY MR. ACOSTA:
5	Q. And what was the date of that letter?
6	A. This letter was January 11th, 1990.
7	Q. And what -- was there a particular grade at
8	the Willow Grove School that was involved?
9	A. Well, it's -- the letter was spurred by an
10	inquiry by letters from the fifth grade students at this
11	particular school.
12	Q. Okay. Now, I want to ask you, after 1990, did
13	any of the defendant cigarette companies ever agree that
14	smoking their cigarettes caused lung cancer or diseases?
15	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
16	THE WITNESS: After 1990?
17	BY MR. ACOSTA:
18	Q. Yes.
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. I want to ask you the question a little bit
21	differently. After 1990, did any of the cigarette
22	company defendants reveal to the public through the
23	public media that they agreed that cigarette smoking
24	caused lung cancer, cancer, or other diseases?
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
0068
1	THE WITNESS: After 1990?
2	BY MR. ACOSTA:
3	Q. Yes.
4	A. Yes, they did.
5	Q. When after 1990 did they do that?
6	A. Well, after the Engle verdict, 2000.
7	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm going to object and move to
8	strike the answer.
9	BY MR. ACOSTA:
10	Q. I'm going to ask it again in another way.
11	After 1990, did the cigarette company defendants ever
12	tell the public in the media that they agreed that
13	cigarette smoking caused lung cancer, cancer or other
14	diseases?
15	A. Yes, they did.
16	Q. And what year did they do that?
17	A. 2000.
18	Q. Did the cigarette company defendants ever
19	agree in public that their cigarettes were addictive?
20	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
21	THE WITNESS: Prior to 2000? I'm not sure-
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. Well, did they ever agree that their
24	cigarettes were addictive, to your knowledge?
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
0069
1	THE WITNESS: Now they do. Now they do agree
2	that their cigarettes are addictive.
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. Do you know when the cigarette company
5	defendants revealed to the public that they believed
6	their cigarettes were addictive?
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: I first became aware of those
9	statements around 2000, 2001. I don't think they
10	mentioned that any earlier, no.
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. When did Philip Morris first disclose to the
13	public that it believed cigarettes were addictive?
14	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
15	THE WITNESS: Around 2001 or so on their
16	website.
17	BY MR. ACOSTA:
18	Q. How about R. J. Reynolds? When did R. J.
19	Reynolds Tobacco Company first disclose to the
20	company -- to the country through public media that it
21	thought smoking its cigarettes could be addictive?
22	A. About the same time.
23	MR. ACOSTA: Why don't we take a short break
24	at this point.
25	(A pause was had in the proceedings.)
0070
1	MR. ACOSTA: Let's go back on the record.
2	BY MR. ACOSTA:
3	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, would you tell -- you told us
4	a little while ago that the defendant cigarette
5	companies had not admitted that smoking was a cause of
6	cancer or addictive until after 2000.
7	A. Well, I -
8	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form. I'm sorry.
9	THE WITNESS: You had asked me actually about
10	R. J. Reynolds and Philip Morris.
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. Okay. Is there a time when defendant Liggett
13	& Myers publicly admitted that cigarette smoking caused
14	cancer and was addictive?
15	A. Liggett & Myers made those statements a bit
16	earlier, yes, in the 1990s.
17	Q. Was it in the late 1990s?
18	A. Around 1998.
19	Q. Okay. And for the other defendant companies,
20	it was when?
21	A. Around 2000.
22	Q. I want to take you back to the 1953-54 time
23	frame again at the time of the Frank Statement. Did the
24	cigarette companies respond to the publicity about lung
25	cancer and smoking in any way other than through the
0071
1	Frank Statement?
2	A. Yes, they did.
3	Q. Did they -- tell me about how many people were
4	smoking back in 1953-54. How many Americans smoked
5	cigarettes?
6	A. In the mid '50s smoking was about, among men,
7	about 60, in the low 60 percent range. About a third of
8	women smoked. And that was the rate of smoking.
9	Q. Did the cigarette companies advertise their
10	cigarettes to the public?
11	A. Extensively, yes.
12	Q. Can you give us any changes in the amount of
13	advertising that occurred around 1953 or 1954?
14	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. Let me ask it a different way. Dr.
17	Kyriakoudes, in response to this publicity about cancer,
18	did the cigarette companies -- did it affect their
19	advertising in any way?
20	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
21	THE WITNESS: Yes, it did.
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. In what way?
24	A. Well, they -- they increased their
25	advertising.
0072
1	Q. How much advertising, for example, did Philip
2	Morris do in the 1953-54 time frame?
3	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: Extensive advertising. I mean,
5	they reported in, you know, in their documents
6	something like three billion advertising messages.
7	So very extensive advertising.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. Was that three -- three million or three
10	billion?
11	A. No. I said B with -- a billion with a B.
12	Q. And for how long a period of time did they
13	have three billion advertising messages?
14	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
15	THE WITNESS: That was just for the year, the
16	1953 year reported in their annual report.
17	BY MR. ACOSTA:
18	Q. Do you have any examples of cigarette company
19	advertising?
20	A. Yes, I have many examples.
21	Q. Okay. Let me show you what we are going to
22	mark as Plaintiffs Exhibit Number 5000.
23	(Plaintiffs Exhibit 5000, Compilation of
24	print advertisements, was identified.)
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0073
1	Q. Let me show you Plaintiffs Exhibit 500 and
2	ask you if you would tell us what it is.
3	A. Yeah. This is a collection of print
4	advertisements, of cigarette print advertisements from
5	magazines, mostly Life Magazine.
6	Q. And does it cover the time period before 1969
7	and after the mid 1940s?
8	A. Yes. These are in chronological order. And
9	the first is 1945, and the last date is from the late
10	'60s. I can't quite see the exact date without pulling
11	the whole thing apart.
12	Q. And what magazine did you say those pertain
13	to?
14	A. I believe a variety of magazines, mostly Life
15	Magazine, but you've got Look, Field & Stream. You
16	know, national magazines.
17	Q. How often did Life Magazine come out?
18	A. Life Magazine was a weekly magazine.
19	Q. And was there any particular kind of
20	advertisement that was usually on the back cover?
21	A. Typically the back cover, which was the prime
22	position for color or full -- we would call -- would say
23	full-color, full-page glossy print, that was typically a
24	cigarette advertisement.
25	Q. And what kinds of themes for their advertising
0074
1	did the cigarette companies have back in the 1950s?
2	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
3	THE WITNESS: Themes relating to things like
4	more doctors smoke Camels. Not a cough in a
5	carload. No throat scratch. Will not harm nose,
6	throat or accessory organs, a famous advertisement
7	for Chesterfield. Thematically the themes focused
8	around healthfulness, you know, vitality, energy,
9	youth. Often they were movie stars and sports
10	figures who would endorse the products, so you had
11	endorsements. You know, Camels don't get your
12	wind. Another famous slogan that was used
13	extensively. Winston tastes good like a cigarette
14	should. Themes of the west, open, you know,
15	associated with Marlboro, for example.
16	So, you know, an extensive array of themes.
17	BY MR. ACOSTA:
18	Q. And in addition to print ads in magazines,
19	what other forms of advertising did the cigarette
20	companies use back in the '50s?
21	A. Well, they relied heavily on broadcast media
22	as well. In the 1950s that would mean radio, which was
23	an extensive way to advertise, and television, which was
24	established but in its infancy.
25	Q. And how about in the 1960s? Did the
0075
1	advertising in the 1960s differ much from what was
2	happening in the 1950s?
3	A. Some differences. The industry was barred
4	from using celebrities and sports endorsers. But
5	generally in their basic goals, the same. Extensive
6	coverage through print and broadcast media.
7	Q. In the -- in the past, did the cigarette
8	company advertisements include endorsement from various
9	people?
10	A. Yes. Movie stars, sports stars.
11	Q. Can you remember some of the names of the
12	movie stars and sports stars that endorsed cigarette
13	company advertisements?
14	A. Sure. Among sports stars, prominent baseball
15	players. Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig would be examples.
16	Prominent football players. Frank Gifford, for example,
17	who was a prominent football player in the 1950s. Among
18	movie stars and other entertainers, Bob Hope, Ronald
19	Reagan before he became a politician, Marlene Dietrich,
20	Rosalyn Russell, many other stars. Dick Van Dike, Mary
21	Tyler Moore. It goes on and on. Extensive reliance
22	on -- on movie and TV stars and other celebrity figures.
23	Q. And what kind of advertising occurred on
24	television?
25	A. Well, there were traditional television
0076
1	commercials and full-blown sponsorships of programs.
2	Earlier TV worked a little bit differently than it does
3	today, where you would have, for example, Your Lucky
4	Strike Hit Parade. So the name of the product, in this
5	case Lucky Strike, American Tobacco's principal
6	cigarette, was incorporated into the name of the
7	program.
8	Q. And what other shows can you remember were
9	advertised by cigarette companies, were sponsored by
10	cigarette companies?
11	A. Well, yeah. A huge number. By the early '60s
12	they were sponsoring over 40 percent of all television
13	programing. So it's a lot. Gunsmoke, The Flintstones,
14	the Beverly Hillbillies. You know, it goes on and on
15	and on.
16	Q. What kind of advertising was done on The
17	Flintstones?
18	A. Commercials with -- starring the Flintstone
19	characters, the cartoon characters.
20	Q. And how about the Beverly Hillbillies?
21	A. Again, commercials starring the characters on
22	the program. You know, Jed Clampett and Grandma, for
23	example. And --
24	Q. Do you remember any of the slogans that went
25	with the cigarettes back in the 1950s?
0077
1	A. Sure. Not a cough in the carload. Winston
2	tastes good like a cigarette should. Tobacco is its own
3	best filter. Guards against throat scratch. Those are
4	examples. Oh, to give you some more, don't be afraid to
5	inhale. Play it safe. Good, good, good. You know,
6	those are -- those are examples.
7	Q. Did any of the advertising reference
8	physicians?
9	A. Yes. As I said earlier, there was a very
10	extensive campaign by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company
11	advertising their Camel cigarette brand long the lines
12	of more doctors smoke Camels.
13	Q. Did Philip Morris also reference physicians in
14	some of its advertising?
15	A. Yes, Philip Morris advertised extensively in
16	medical journals for their Philip Morris brand
17	cigarette, indicating that for patients who inhale,
18	suggest Philip Morris, that it was a safer smoke.
19	Q. How about L&M, Liggett & Myers cigarettes, L&M
20	cigarettes?
21	A. Yes. Similar health-related themes.
22	Q. Do you remember what one of their slogans was
23	that referenced doctors?
24	A. I'm not recalling the L&M slogan at this
25	moment.
0078
1	Q. Let me see if I can refresh your recollection.
2	Just what the doctor ordered?
3	A. Yes. That's right. That was the L&M slogan.
4	Just what the doctor ordered. You know, another example
5	would be Chesterfield, scientifically proven not to harm
6	nose, throat or accessory organs. A prominent
7	advertising campaign feature Marlene Dietrich and
8	Rosalyn Russell.
9	Q. Were there any children in cigarette ads back
10	in the 1950s?
11	A. In some, yes.
12	Q. In what ways were children involved?
13	A. Well. Many ads portrayed smoking in domestic
14	situations, and so people would be smoking amongst their
15	families. The Marlboro brand was originally a woman's
16	brand before they remade, manufactured it or
17	readvertised it into the macho western brand. So in the
18	early '50s it had been a women's brand up to that point.
19	And that featured babies, babies with carton captions
20	saying Mom, smoke Marlboro because it's mild.
21	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection. Move to strike the
22	response.
23	BY MR. ACOSTA:
24	Q. In the 19 -- let's go to the 1980s, for
25	example. Were there any particularly successful
0079
1	advertising campaigns in the 1980s?
2	A. Yes, a number of very, very successful
3	advertising campaigns. The Joe Camel campaign by the
4	RJR Reynolds Tobacco Company was an extremely successful
5	campaign.
6	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm sorry. Object to the form
7	and move to strike.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. Who was Joe Camel?
10	A. Joe Camel was a carton representation of the
11	R. J. Reynolds trademark of Camel. A camel had adorned
12	the pack of the Camel cigarette pack from its inception
13	in the 19 teens, and Joe Camel was a hip and trendy
14	carton manifestation of that.
15	Q. Was there a particular age group that Joe
16	Camel was directed at?
17	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form, foundation.
18	THE WITNESS: Yes. My opinion is Joe Camel
19	was directed towards children.
20	BY MR. ACOSTA:
21	Q. What type of clothing did Joe Camel wear?
22	A. Often he wore a leather jacket. Sometimes
23	he'd be riding a motorcycle. You know, kind of hip,
24	trendy clothing.
25	Q. Did he wear the kind of clothing that your
0080
1	parents wore?
2	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
3	THE WITNESS: No. He wore, you know, kind of
4	in style, action, you know, younger clothing.
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. Did the defendants ever give away cigarettes,
7	the cigarette company defendants?
8	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
9	THE WITNESS: Yes. It was common practice to
10	market cigarettes by giving away samples.
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. Okay. How did they go about giving away
13	cigarettes?
14	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
15	THE WITNESS: Cigarettes were distributed in
16	many, many ways. It used to be standard practice
17	that when you flew on an airplane you got a little
18	slim four-pack of cigarettes as, you know, part of
19	your, you know, your snack, so to speak. There
20	were extensive college marketing programs where
21	college representatives would give away cigarettes
22	on campus to students. And then there is even
23	evidence that tobacco company officials would go
24	into neighborhoods and simply give away cigarettes
25	to anybody that would take them.
0081
1	BY MR. ACOSTA:
2	Q. Did they give cigarettes to soldiers?
3	A. Cigarettes were standard component of K and C
4	rations, which were soldiers' rations until very recent
5	times. So in essence they were included as a food item.
6	Q. Now, before 1969, did any of the
7	advertisements that the cigarette industry provided to
8	the public, did any of the advertisements contain any
9	warnings about any health hazards associated with
10	smoking?
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Just for -- you said before
12	1969, right?
13	MR. ACOSTA: Yeah.
14	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. Let me -- let me restate the question, because
17	it wasn't very good anyway.
18	Dr. Kyriakoudes, before 1969 did any of the
19	cigarette advertising carry with it any warnings that
20	there was a hazard associated with smoking cigarettes?
21	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
22	THE WITNESS: Not on the advertising, no.
23	BY MR. ACOSTA:
24	Q. Was there any warning provided by the
25	cigarette companies any place else other than
0082
1	advertising?
2	A. Well -
3	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
4	THE WITNESS: Beginning in 1966, packs of
5	cigarettes, by legislation, by federal legislation,
6	were required to carry a caution label.
7	BY MR. ACOSTA:
8	Q. Okay.
9	A. A caution message.
10	Q. We'll talk about that in a second. Let's go
11	back to the 1950 time frame. In the 1950s did the
12	cigarette companies ever provide any warnings to people
13	that smoking their cigarettes might be hazardous to
14	their health?
15	A. No, none whatsoever.
16	Q. Did the cigarette -- any of the cigarette
17	company defendants make representations about what they
18	would do if they -- they found that their cigarettes
19	were hazardous?
20	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
21	THE WITNESS: Yes, they did.
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. Do we have a movie clip about that?
24	A. Yes, we have clips relating to that.
25	Q. And do you have a clip that identifies any
0083
1	particular person with a cigarette company that makes
2	representations about cigarette smoke?
3	A. Well, yeah. I have a set of clips from the
4	1950s, if that's what you are referring to.
5	Q. Can we show your example that pertains to
6	something that the cigarette companies were looking for?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. All right. Let me put that on so you can look
9	at it.
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Are you going to try to play it
11	on your computer?
12	MR. ACOSTA: Do you just want to see it on my
13	computer instead of on the screen? Or do you want
14	to let everybody look at it?
15	MR. GERAGHTY: Let's let everybody look at it.
16	And then if the court reporter could try to take
17	down the sound, that would be great.
18	MR. ACOSTA: I'll make it as loud as my little
19	speakers will go.
20	MR. KOETHE: And do you have a number, Howard?
21	Is there a number on it? Or just identify it for
22	the record.
23	MR. ACOSTA: We can identify it as Exhibit 42.
24	MR. GERAGHTY: Which would be?
25	MR. ACOSTA: Which would be the clip from See
0084
1	It Now involving Dr. DuPuis.
2	(Plaintiffs Exhibit 42, Video Clip of a Dr.
3	Robert N. DuPuis interview, was marked for
4	identification.)
5	(A discussion off the record.)
6	MR. ACOSTA: All right. Are we back on
7	camera?
8	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: You are rolling.
9	(A video clip was played.)
10	MR. MURROW: Good evening. This is See It
11	Now, produced by the partnership of Friendly and
12	Murrow and presented by ALCOA, the Aluminum Company
13	of America. Tonight, the second half of a report
14	on cigarettes and cancer.
15	(Inaudible word.)
16	Nonetheless, each major cigarette producer has
17	been conducting its own experiments on this
18	problem.
19	This is the Richmond laboratory of one of the
20	major producers.
21	Dr. DuPuis: I am Dr. Robert N. DuPuis,
22	chairman of the Industry Technical Group of the
23	Tobacco Industry Research Committee.
24	Our primary objective is to analyze all of the
25	components of smoke. Of course, we do a great deal
0085
1	of research on analysis and technology of tobacco
2	itself. But even if we knew all of the components
3	of tobacco, we still would not know the components
4	of smoke. And since smoke is what we sell, we feel
5	that we should emphasize this phase of research.
6	After we have produced the smoke and separated
7	it into fractions, the next step is to identify
8	these fractions. These are then identified either
9	photographically or on the oscilloscope. The
10	oscilloscope is now demonstrating the means of
11	identification of one of the smoke components.
12	Using these instruments, we have isolated and
13	identified some three dozen components of smoke.
14	Many more will be identified. As we find these
15	components, we publish the results of our work in
16	technical journals which are available to any
17	scientist in any part of the world. So far, we
18	have found none that give us any cause for concern.
19	If we do find any that we consider harmful -- and
20	so far we have not -- we will remove these from
21	smoke.
22	(The playing of the video clip concluded.)
23	BY MR. ACOSTA:
24	Q. That's end of the clip. Dr. Kyriakoudes, can
25	you tell us who that was that was speaking in the very
0086
1	beginning of that clip?
2	A. Initially that was Edward R. Murrow, a
3	journalist and pioneering television journalist from the
4	1950s.
5	Q. All right. And was that clip from a show that
6	he did in 1955?
7	A. Yes. That's from his news program See It Now.
8	Q. And the person that next spoke, Dr. DuPuis, do
9	you remember which company he worked for?
10	A. Yes. He was a scientist with Philip Morris.
11	Q. And is what he said about finding -- let me
12	strike that.
13	Is what he said about finding constituents in
14	the smoke or agents in the smoke or cancer causes
15	chemicals in the smoke consistent with what at least
16	some of the defendants knew about cigarette smoke before
17	1954?
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
19	MR. KOETHE: Objection.
20	THE WITNESS: No, it's not consistent unless
21	one -- you know, unless he has no concern
22	whatsoever for human life.
23	BY MR. ACOSTA:
24	Q. I'm going to ask it again in a different way.
25	Is what Dr. DuPuis said about not finding any harmful
0087
1	chemicals in smoke consistent with what was in some of
2	the cigarette company defendants' own documents before
3	1954?
4	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
5	THE WITNESS: No, it's not consistent.
6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. And in what way isn't it consistent?
8	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
9	THE WITNESS: Well, industry documents clearly
10	identify the harmful carcinogens in the smoke.
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. And Dr. DuPuis said what about them?
13	A. He said that he had identified none that are
14	of concern.
15	Q. And what did he say they would do if they
16	found them?
17	A. If they found any, they would remove them.
18	Q. Now, about that time did the design of the
19	cigarette go through changes?
20	A. Yes, it did.
21	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm going to object to the
22	form.
23	BY MR. ACOSTA:
24	Q. Now, when I say that, I'm not asking you to
25	talk about cigarette design from an expert's point of
0088
1	view. What I am asking you is did the typical cigarette
2	change from one kind to another in the mid 1950s?
3	A. Yes, it did change.
4	Q. Okay. In what way?
5	A. The cigarette market in the 1950s very quickly
6	saw the explosion in filter cigarettes in terms of what
7	was being offered for sale to the public.
8	Q. And who chose to put filters on the
9	cigarettes?
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
11	THE WITNESS: Well, the manufacturers put the
12	filters on the cigarettes.
13	BY MR. ACOSTA:
14	Q. And did they come out with new brands that
15	contained filters after this Frank Statement and about
16	the time that Dr. DuPuis was talking about looking for
17	things in smoke?
18	A. Yes. New brands came out, older brands were
19	put on with filter and sold as a filter variety, and
20	then new brands came out with filters.
21	Q. When did Winstons come out?
22	A. Winstons came out in the 1950s as a filter
23	cigarette.
24	Q. How about Marlboro?
25	A. Marlboro was reformulated and introduced as a
0089
1	filter cigarette with a new advertising image.
2	Q. How about Benson & Hedges?
3	A. Benson & Hedges also became a filter cigarette
4	in the 1950s.
5	Q. How about Salem?
6	A. Salem, also a menthol cigarette with a filter.
7	Q. And how about, oh --
8	A. True.
9	Q. — Kent.
10	A. Yeah. Kent would be perhaps the most notable
11	filter cigarette, yes.
12	Q. Why was it notable?
13	A. Well, Kent expressly advertised its filter as
14	having positive health properties, being -- you know,
15	that it would filter out whatever might be harmful.
16	Q. How about Parliament?
17	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm sorry. Excuse me. Object
18	to the form and move to strike.
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. How about Parliament?
21	A. Also a filter cigarette.
22	Q. And did Parliament also make assertions about
23	safety?
24	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
25	THE WITNESS: Yes. In television commercials
0090
1	and print ads, yes, it did.
2	BY MR. ACOSTA:
3	Q. Do you remember any particular kinds of
4	television ads involving filter cigarettes and nonfilter
5	cigarettes where there were comparisons made on TV ?
6	A. Yes. I mean, there were -- a typical
7	television advertisement from this period would be, you
8	know, to blow smoke through a handkerchief to indicate
9	that, you know, tar had been filtered out or, you know,
10	at least harmful elements had been filtered out, showing
11	the products of filtered smoking and comparing that to
12	unfiltered smoke as being cleaner and therefore more
13	healthful.
14	Q. Do you recall the discussion we had earlier
15	about the tobacco industry research committee?
16	A. Yes, I recall that.
17	Q. Do you have a clip which indicates their
18	announcement on television to the public about what some
19	of the things that they did?
20	A. Yes. There is actually a couple of clips.
21	Q. Okay. Why don't we show those. We'll
22	identify them as Exhibit 43 and 44.
23	(Plaintiffs Exhibit 43, Video Clip of a
24	Timothy Hartnett interview, and Plaintiffs Exhibit
25	44, Video Clip of a Clarence Cook Little interview,
0091
1	were marked for identification.)
2	MR. GERAGHTY: And these are also from the See
3	It Now program, Howard?
4	MR. ACOSTA: I think so. I think they are.
5	MR. KOETHE: Subject to seeing this, I'm going
6	to object on the grounds of foundation.
7	(A video excerpt was played.)
8	MR. MURROW: Former president of a major
9	tobacco firm and chairman of the Industry Research
10	Committee.
11	MR. HARTNETT: I would like to quote from a
12	statement released at the time the Tobacco Research
13	Committee was formed. At that time we stated, We
14	accept an interest in people's health as a basic
15	responsibility paramount to every other
16	consideration in our business. And that's where we
17	stand.
18	(The playing of the video excerpt concluded.)
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. Now, who was that that just spoke?
21	A. That was Timothy V. Hartnett. He had been
22	head of the Brown & Williamson Company, but was tapped
23	to head up the TIRC soon after its creation.
24	Q. And what did he do before he was tapped to
25	head up the TIRC?
0092
1	A. He was head of Brown & Williamson.
2	Q. Now, let me show you -- well, where did that
3	clip come from?
4	A. That clip is also from the See It Now
5	television program.
6	Q. Okay. Let me show you the next clip involving
7	Clarence Cook Little, and I'll ask you some questions
8	about it after I show it.
9	(A video excerpt was played.)
10	FIRST SPEAKER: Dr. Little, you are chairman
11	of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Tobacco
12	Industry Research Committee. What is the purpose
13	of the committee?
14	DR. LITTLE: Well, the purpose of the
15	committee is to study in every possible way the
16	relations between smoking and human health.
17	FIRST SPEAKER: Have any cancer causing agents
18	been identified in cigarettes?
19	DR. LITTLE: No, none whatever, by either the
20	cigarettes or in any product of smoking as such.
21	(The video excerpt was concluded.)
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. Based upon your investigation and research,
24	was that statement correct?
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
0093
1	THE WITNESS: No, that was an incorrect
2	statement.
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. And I'm speaking specifically about the
5	finding of any carcinogenic substance in cigarette
6	smoke.
7	A. Little says none whatsoever had been found,
8	and that's incorrect.
9	Q. Now, what show was that from, clip from?
10	A. That's also from Edward R. Murrow's See It
11	Now.
12	Q. Did the cigarette companies at that time
13	continue to deny that smoking caused any disease?
14	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
15	THE WITNESS: Yes, they continued to deny that
16	cigarettes caused any disease.
17	BY MR. ACOSTA:
18	Q. Now, did anything happen to their -- their
19	sales in terms of the amounts of cigarettes they were
20	selling in the 1950s as a result of any publicity
21	involving cancer?
22	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
23	THE WITNESS: Well, if you are talking about
24	total sales of cigarettes sold, the general trend
25	in the 1950s was an increase.
0094
1	BY MR. ACOSTA:
2	Q. All right. Let me ask you the question a
3	different way. What was the general trend of sales of
4	cigarettes during the 1950s?
5	A. Upward.
6	Q. Now, have you reviewed any cigarette company
7	defendant documents about filter cigarettes?
8	A. I have.
9	Q. And have you reviewed any, for example, from
10	Philip Morris?
11	A. Yes, I have.
12	Q. Did you see anything in any of Philip Morris's
13	documents indicating the efficacy or nonefficacy,
14	whether the filter worked or didn't work on their
15	cigarettes?
16	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
17	THE WITNESS: Yes, I did.
18	BY MR. ACOSTA:
19	Q. What did you see in the Philip Morris
20	documents?
21	A. References.
22	MR. GERAGHTY: Same -- I'm sorry. Same
23	objection.
24	THE WITNESS: Philip Morris referred to the
25	illusion of filtration as they marketed a health
0095
1	cigarette essentially as a marketing device, using
2	the filter as a device that people would think was
3	healthier but, in fact, offered merely the
4	illusion.
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Object and move to strike the
6	response.
7	BY MR. ACOSTA:
8	Q. In your research and investigation, did you
9	see any public statement by Philip Morris to the effect
10	that its filtration was an illusion?
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
12	THE WITNESS: No, I never saw them make a
13	public statement to that effect.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. Did Philip Morris advertising tend to suggest
16	that filters on their cigarettes were effective?
17	MR. GERAGHTY: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: Yes.
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. How about the other cigarette company
21	defendants? Did they make similar suggestions in their
22	advertising?
23	MR. KOETHE: Objection.
24	THE WITNESS: Yes, they did.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0096
1	Q. Now, in the later 1950s, did the cigarette
2	company defendants, including Liggett & Myers, form
3	another trade group in addition to the TIRC?
4	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
5	THE WITNESS: Yes, they did in 1958.
6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. And what was the name of that group?
8	A. The Tobacco Institute.
9	Q. And what was the Tobacco Institute?
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
11	THE WITNESS: The Tobacco Institute was a
12	lobbying and public relations organization designed
13	to deflect, counter the charge that cigarettes were
14	implicated in any form of disease and to further
15	the business interests of the tobacco industry as a
16	whole.
17	Q. Who funded the --
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Excuse me.
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. Who funded the tobacco institute?
21	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm sorry. Move to strike the
22	last response.
23	BY MR. ACOSTA:
24	Q. Who funded the Tobacco Institute?
25	A. It was funded by the member tobacco
0097
1	manufacturers, member corporations that were tobacco
2	manufacturers. They were assessed a fee.
3	Q. And who were the manufacturers that began the
4	Tobacco Institute?
5	A. That would be the defendants in this case with
6	some -- the names and mergers and the like have changed
7	some of that, but American Tobacco, Philip Morris
8	Tobacco, the Philip Morris Company, Lorillard, Liggett &
9	Myers, Brown & Williamson.
10	Q. Any others?
11	A. And R. J. Reynolds.
12	Q. Now, did the Tobacco Institute make public
13	statements on behalf of the cigarette company
14	defendants?
15	A. Yes, it did.
16	Q. And what was the nature of their public
17	statements?
18	A. Well, principally, their public statements
19	denied -- characterizing them as a whole, denied that
20	cigarettes were implicated in causing any disease. They
21	also discussed ongoing research efforts by the tobacco
22	industry to find the true cause -- true cause of these
23	diseases.
24	Q. Now, did the Tobacco Institute publish
25	anything for public -- public use, public reading?
0098
1	A. Yes, it published newsletters and regular
2	publications on tobacco and health.
3	Q. Let me show you something after I give it to
4	the defendants.
5	(Plaintiffs Exhibit 1583, Document titled
6	Research Reports on Tobacco and Health,
7	identified.)
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. Let me show you Plaintiffs Exhibit 1583 and
10	ask you to identify it.
11	MR. GERAGHTY: We are going to object to the
12	use of the document on the grounds that it was not
13	part of the narrowed list of disclosure documents.
14	THE WITNESS: What was your question? Go
15	ahead.
16	BY MR. ACOSTA:
17	Q. Yeah. Would you tell us what the last exhibit
18	was that I handed to you is?
19	A. Yeah. This is a publication by the Tobacco
20	Institute called Research Reports on Tobacco and Health.
21	Q. Without reference to that particular exhibit,
22	would you tell me how often the Tobacco Institute would
23	make public statements about smoking and health back in
24	the 1950s, early 1960s?
25	A. Frequently. Typically, whenever there was a
0099
1	news item or news event in which the research on smoking
2	and health or on investigations into advertising or any
3	of their practices, the tobacco industry would try to
4	make its voice heard in those media reports. So from
5	1958 onward with the Tobacco Institute, they worked hard
6	to make sure that their position was reflected in any
7	news item discussing smoking and health.
8	Q. Between 19 —
9	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm sorry. Let me move to
10	strike that.
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. Between 1954 when the Frank Statement was
13	issued and the time the Tobacco Institute was started
14	up, did the cigarette company defendants make public
15	statements when there were reports of links between
16	cancer and cigarette smoking?
17	A. Yes, frequently.
18	Q. And in what way did they do that?
19	A. They did this by speaking to reporters. They
20	did this by sponsoring the ghost writing of books on
21	smoking and health. They did this by meeting with
22	editors of national magazines, trying to persuade them
23	to include their viewpoint in their publications. They
24	did this through meeting with the producers of
25	television programs to get their position across, to get
0100
1	their position included in their programing, news
2	programing, for example.
3	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm sorry. Object to the form
4	of the last question.
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. What was the position or viewpoint of the
7	cigarette company defendants at that time?
8	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
9	THE WITNESS: That cigarettes were not the
10	cause of disease, particularly lung cancer.
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. And did their viewpoint and position get
13	published in newspaper articles?
14	MR. ACOSTA: Objection.
15	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
16	THE WITNESS: Yes, it did.
17	BY MR. ACOSTA:
18	Q. Can you give us some idea of how many
19	newspaper articles the cigarette company viewpoint was
20	stated in?
21	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
22	THE WITNESS: I -- you know, I've looked at
23	hundreds and hundreds.
24	BY MR. ACOSTA:
25	Q. And were those newspapers that were published
0101
1	around the United States?
2	A. Yes, all across the United States. I've look
3	at papers from a wide variety of locations.
4	Q. Can you give us some idea of, you know, a
5	typical article, what it -- what it might -- might say?
6	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm going to object to the form
7	of the question.
8	THE WITNESS: Yes, I can. Say in the 1950s,
9	an article perhaps indicating from -- or let me
10	rephrase that. An article discussing perhaps a new
11	scientific study showing additional evidence that
12	smoking is a cause of lung cancer. Typically then
13	the tobacco industry, the TIRC and the Tobacco
14	Institute would rebut those statements and indicate
15	flaws in the research, or that, you know,
16	statistical associations are not proof; men are not
17	mice in terms of animal studies; dogs are not an
18	appropriate vehicle for studying inhalation studies
19	or we need more laboratory evidence or what have
20	you.
21	Another category would be stories that
22	initiated from the Tobacco Institute itself, or I
23	should say initiated their position that, you know,
24	it was pollution, for example, that may be the
25	cause of the lung cancer epidemic, or that genetic
0102
1	or constitutional factors might be the cause. And
2	so there were a variety of ways in which they got
3	their message out, both in rebutting the emerging
4	science and also in advertising their own work that
5	sought to discredit the relationship between
6	smoking and disease.
7	MR. GERAGHTY: I move to strike as
8	nonresponsive.
9	BY MR. ACOSTA:
10	Q. Based upon your investigation, do you have an
11	opinion as to why they did that?
12	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
13	THE WITNESS: I do.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. What's that?
16	A. Well, they feared --
17	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection. I'm sorry.
18	Same objection.
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. Let me start over, subject to their objection.
21	Do you have an opinion as to why the cigarette
22	company defendant printed their point of view in so many
23	ways to the public in the news media?
24	A. I do.
25	Q. And what's that?
0103
1	A. Well, they wanted to sow doubt as to the -- in
2	the minds of the consuming public as to the nature of
3	the relationship between smoking and disease. To put it
4	another way, they didn't want people to believe it. And
5	they did this because they feared the effect of
6	widespread belief that smoking would cause disease on
7	their business.
8	Q. And what do you mean by on their business?
9	A. By on their ability to sell cigarettes.
10	MR. GERAGHTY: I object to the form of the
11	last question.
12	BY MR. ACOSTA:
13	Q. What do you mean by on their business?
14	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
15	MR. ACOSTA: Well, wait a minute. You've got
16	the objection. You can keep that objection. Okay?
17	MR. GERAGHTY: All right. You didn't say it
18	that time.
19	MR. ACOSTA: You are right. I apologize.
20	THE WITNESS: By their business -
21	BY MR. ACOSTA:
22	Q. Wait, wait. What did you mean when you said
23	"by their business"?
24	A. "By their business", I mean on their ability
25	to sell cigarettes.
0104
1	Q. And what happened to their ability to sell
2	cigarettes during the 1950s in conjunction with their
3	response to this cancer problem?
4	MR. KOETHE: Objection.
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
6	THE WITNESS: Well, they sold more and more
7	cigarettes year after year.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. Okay. Let me ask it a different way. What
10	happened in the 1950s after the Frank Statement with
11	respect to the cigarette company defendants' sales of
12	their products?

3	disease helped promote the sale of cigarettes.
