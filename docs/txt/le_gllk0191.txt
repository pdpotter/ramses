6
1	LOUIS K YRI AKOUDES, Ph.D.,
2	after being first duly sworn in the cause by the
3	court reporter, testified as follows:
4	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
5	Q. Good morning, Dr. Kyriakoudes. How
6	are you?
7	A. I'm fine.
8	Q. Could you just, for purposes of the
9	record, please state your name and spell your
10	last name and give us your professional address?
11	A. My name is Louis Michael
12	Kyriakoudes. My last name is spelled
13	K-Y-R-I-A-K-O-U-D-E-S, and my address is the
14	Center For Oral History, 118 College Drive,
15	Number 5175, University of Southern Mississippi,
16	Hattiesburg, Mississippi, 39406.
17	Q. Doctor, we've met before.
18	A. Yes, I think last month.
19	Q. And prior to that.
20	A. Prior, at least two or three times.
21	Q. And you have given depositions on
22	numerous occasions, correct?
23	A. Yes. I don't have an exact count,
24	but it's certainly over 20.
25	Q. You understand the rules that apply
7
1	to depositions, correct?
2	A. Yes, I do.
3	Q. Would you want me to repeat those,
4	or are you comfortable?
5	A. I'm comfortable. If I don't
6	understand a question, I'll ask you to repeat it.
7	Q. If you give an answer to a question
8	that I pose, everybody is going to assume that
9	you understood the question. I want to make sure
10	you do understand it. So, if, for any reason,
11	I'm not clear or we're not communicating, please
12	let me know and I'll do my best to rephrase any
13	of the questions that I ask.
14	A. I'll be happy to do that.
15	Q. The address you gave just a moment
16	ago, the Center For Oral History at the
17	University of Southern Mississippi --
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. -- was that your address when we
20	were last here in September?
21	A. Oh, yeah. Maybe --
22	Q. In other words, let me ask the
23	question a different way. Has your office or
24	professional address at the University of
25	Southern Mississippi changed since your
8
1	deposition was taken in the Hess, Sherman, Cohen
2	and Stephens cases back in September?
3	A. No. I have two addresses at the
4	university, and it's a little bit more convenient
5	for me to get my mail at this particular address
6	as opposed to the Department of History address.
7	I might add, just as a matter of my own personal
8	practice, that my preference is to receive
9	anything related to my tobacco consulting at my
10	home, because I maintain a home office. Maybe
11	that would be the best address.
12	Q. Why don't you give us that address
13	if you use that address for purposes of your
14	professional work as an expert witness in tobacco
15	matters.
16	A. Yeah. So, that is 333 DeMontluzin
17	Street, and that's spelled D-E-M-O-N-T-L-U-Z-I-N,
18	Street, of course, Bay St. Louis, Mississippi,
19	39520.
20	Q. Just very briefly, how far is Bay
21	St. Louis from the campus?
22	A. It's 82 miles.
23	Q. So, do you commute back and forth
24	for your teaching responsibilities, typically?
25	A. Right now, I am, yes. We're
9
1	planning to move to Hattiesburg.
2	Q. You and your wife and family?
3	A. Yes.
4	MR. GERAGHTY:
5	Before I go any further, I
6	have some legal issues that I need
7	to address that I think we've
8	addressed so far. Nothing of
9	concern to you, but I want to on
10	the record state some objections.
11	I think they fall into three broad
12	categories. First has to do with
13	the fact that the deposition has
14	been cross-noticed in multiple
15	cases, and the issue of the
16	cross-noticing is being litigated
17	in a variety of courts around the
18	state of Florida right now, in
19	many of these cases, and on behalf
20	of Philip Morris USA and
21	Lorillard, who I am representing
22	here today, as far as we are
23	concerned, this deposition is only
24	taking place in the Escambia
25	County cases in which it was
10
1	properly noticed, and the
2	Hillsborough County cases, in
3	which it was properly noticed, and
4	in the Gelep case, which is a case
5	pending in Pinellas County, by
6	agreement of parties.
7	To the extent this
8	deposition has been cross-noticed
9	in other jurisdictions outside of
10	Hillsborough or Escambia, we
11	object to those cross notices. We
12	reserve our right to take
13	additional depositions of Dr.
14	Kyriakoudes in those cases outside
15	of Hillsborough and outside of
16	Escambia, where the deposition has
17	been cross-noticed. We also
18	reserve our right to take a
19	follow-up deposition as is
20	necessary to the extent that Dr.
21	Kyriakoudes's opinions may change,
22	to the extent that the material
23	upon which he bases his opinions
24	change, and the extent to which
25	there are new developments or new
11
1	issues that Dr. Kyriakoudes
2	advises plaintiffs' counsel that
3	he has looked into or has opinions
4	about.
5	We would also note our
6	objection. I don't --1 don't
7	know Watson is in some of the
8	Hillsborough and Escambia County
9	cases, but we are objecting to any
10	counsel in cases outside of
11	Hillsborough or Escambia
12	participating in the deposition.
13	Obviously, you're in the case for
14	purposes of Hillsborough and
15	Escambia. I understand that. But
16	for purposes of the record, we are
17	objecting to the participation of
18	any counsel who don't have cases
19	in Hillsborough or Escambia
20	County.
21	Two other things. I want to
22	make an objection to the fact that
23	in reviewing Dr. Kyriakoudes'
24	reliance materials, which Mr.
25	Schultz provided us two CDs
12
1	approximately a week or so ago, on
2	behalf of Philip Morris, we have
3	located three documents so far --
4	a review is not complete -- but
5	three documents that we maintain
6	are privileged, and I'm simply
7	going to read the Bates range of
8	the documents into the record and
9	then assert the privilege. The
10	first document is 1003718428
11	through 8432, the second document
12	is 1003718433 through 8436, and
13	the third document is 2045752110.
14	And on behalf of Philip Morris, I
15	would object to the use of these
16	documents by Dr. Kyriakoudes or
17	anybody on the grounds that they
18	are protected by the attorney -
19	client privilege and the work-
20	product doctrine. We would demand
21	that any copies of the documents
22	be returned to us, as well as any
23	other documents that mention,
24	discuss or report on the contents
25	of the privileged documents I have
13
1	mentioned. We would request or
2	demand a list of the names of
3	everyone who has had possession of
4	those documents or copies of them,
5	and we would move to strike any
6	testimony based in whole or in
7	part on the contents of those
8	privileged documents.
9	Thank you.
10	MR. KOETHE:
11	On behalf of Reynolds and
12	Brown & Williamson, I would like
13	to join in those objections and,
14	likewise, object to the use of any
15	documents that are deemed to be
16	privileged or privileged or work-
17	product protected.
18	MR. ROSENSTEIN:
19	For the record, I would like
20	to also join in those objections.
21	MR. SCHULTZ:
22	Is that it?
23	MR. GERAGHTY:
24	One more thing and then I'll
25	turn on over to you.
14
1	Let me just say one other
2	thing. We haven't been able to go
3	through everything on the reliance
4	list to determine whether there
5	might be additional privilege
6	documents. So, I would assert the
7	right to, if we determine that
8	there are additional documents
9	that are privileged, that we would
10	invoke the privilege as to those
11	documents. I want to make sure
12	that is clear.
13	Let me make one last comment
14	on a different issue, and that is
15	in the course of reviewing the
16	reliance materials that you
17	produced on behalf of Dr.
18	Kyriakoudes, based upon what we've
19	seen so far, it looks as if there
20	are over 2,900 individual
21	documents that amount to roughly
22	32,000 pages of material in total,
23	a very voluminous amount of
24	material. We are scheduled to do
25	a trial preservation deposition of
15
1	Dr. Kyriakoudes, as I understand
2	it, on December 9th and 10th in
3	Tampa, Florida, and this issue has
4	been discussed in the context of,
5	I know, the deposition of Dr.
6	Farone but on behalf of Philip
7	Morris and Lorillard, I'm making a
8	request that to the extent that
9	any of those materials identified
10	in Dr. Kyriakoudes' reliance
11	materials are going to be used
12	with Dr. Kyriakoudes during his
13	direct examination, that those
14	documents either be provided to us
15	or that they be identified in a
16	way that we could pull them from
17	the reliance list or from the CDs
18	by December 2nd, which is, you
19	know, one week prior to the
20	beginning of the deposition.
21	MR. KOETHE:
22	And we would join in that
23	request as well.
24	MR. ROSENSTEIN:
25	Liggett will also join in
16
1	that request.
2	MR. SCHULTZ:
3	And Matt Schultz on behalf
4	of the plaintiffs. I will work
5	backwards and very quickly. This
6	isn't the time or the place to
7	talk about trial exhibits. That's
8	enough said on that issue.
9	As to the privilege
10	documents, if the defendants are
11	serious about asserting any claim
12	of privilege or work-product
13	doctrine, they should bring a
14	motion in front of the court at
15	the earliest opportunity. All of
16	the documents on the reliance
17	materials have been filed publicly
18	in Escambia County and are,
19	therefore, part of the public
20	court record there. So, if this
21	is anything other than posturing,
22	I would suggest that a motion be
23	filed straightaway.
24	On the plaintiffs' behalf,
25	regarding appearances, we would
1	object to participation in the
2	deposition by any attorney who is
3	not licensed in Florida or
4	admitted pro hoc in one of the
5	Engle progeny cases.
6	And with respect to
7	follow-up depositions, at least in
8	terms of Escambia County, those
9	are provided for in CMO Number 1
10	that Judge Terrell entered last
11	year, earlier this year, and you
12	are entitled to follow-up
13	depositions in accordance with the
14	terms of the Case Management Order
15	or any other relief you might
16	obtain from Judge Terrell in that
17	regard.
18	And on cross-notices, that
19	issue will be raised at the
20	appropriate times and the
21	appropriate courts and addressed
22	by those judges there rather than
23	here in this deposition.
24	That's it. Thank you.
25	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
1	Q. Doctor, thank you for your patience
2	with that. Okay. Let's proceed.
3	You heard me mention and then Mr.
4	Schultz mention a deposition on December 9th and
5	10th in Tampa.
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. What is your understanding of the
8	purpose of that particular deposition?
9	A. My understanding is that this is
10	going to be, in a sense, a videotaped trial
11	testimony in which I will give my direct
12	examination with the plaintiffs' counsel and then
13	the defense will have an opportunity to cross-
14	examine me, and this will be videotaped and,
15	therefore, relieve me of the obligation to appear
16	in person at certain trials.
17	Q. And from whom did you get this
18	understanding of what that deposition is all
19	about?
20	A. Mr. Matt Schultz, who is right here.
21	Q. And tell me, if you could, when
22	did -- when did you and Mr. Schultz first meet
23	or -- whether by phone or in person?
24	A. Oh, spring.
25	Q. Spring of 2008?
1	A. Spring of 2008, yes.
2	Q. Tell me about your first contact
3	with him. Was it by telephone, in person?
4	A. I think he sent me an e-mail asking
5	if he could talk to me on the telephone, and we
6	spoke on the telephone. We met in person for the
7	first time last night for dinner.
8	Q. For purposes of coordinating and
9	scheduling today's deposition, with whom have you
10	spoken to about that?
11	A. I've worked through Mr. Schultz's
12	firm on arranging my schedule and coordinating
13	the times, you know, setting up the times.
14	Q. Have you discussed the coordination
15	and scheduling of this deposition with anybody
16	other than Mr. Schultz?
17	A. I don't --1 don't think so.
18	Maybe -- maybe a paralegal or a secretary in his
19	office, but I don't even think that, no.
20	Q. Let me be more specific. Have you
21	spoken with any other attorneys besides Mr.
22	Schultz who have filed Engle progeny cases?
23	A. Oh, about coordinating this
24	deposition?
1	A. I spoke briefly once with Howard
2	Acosta.
3	Q. Did you speak at all with Mr. Watson
4	about the scheduling of this deposition or the
5	deposition on December 9th?
6	A. No. Is that -- I've never met him.
7	Q. Mr. Watson is the gentleman to your
8	left.
9	A. Yeah. No, I'd never met Mr. Watson
10	before and I'd never had any prior contact with
11	him.
12	Q. Have you had any contact with
13	anybody from his law firm, the Gary Williams law
14	firm?
15	A. No, that's not a law firm familiar
16	to me.
17	Q. Have you had any discussions with
18	Todd McFarland about the schedule of today's
19	deposition or the deposition on December 9th?
20	A. No. I met Mr. McFarland
21	approximately a year ago for a deposition on a
22	different case, on Ferlanti, where Mr. Rosenstein
23	was present and was the person doing the
24	deposition.
25	Q. So, you've had no conversations with
21
1	Todd McFarland about today's deposition?
2	A. None whatsoever, no.
3	Q. Or the deposition on December 9th?
4	A. I have not communicated with Mr.
5	McFarland since the day that we had a deposition
6	in Durham, North Carolina, approximately a year
7	ago.
8	Q. And that was in the Ferlanti case,
9	as you mentioned a moment ago?
10	A. Yes, correct, Ferlanti.
11	Q. And that was in December, 2007?
12	A. That's --1 believe, yes. I don't
13	know the exact date. It's in my CV.
14	Q. Okay. According to my notes, that
15	deposition took place on December 19th, 2007.
16	Does that sound about right to you?
17	A. That sounds about right.
18	Q. Just so it's clear, you haven't had
19	any communication with Mr. McFarland, whether in
20	person, by telephone or by correspondence or
21	e-mail since December 19th of 2007?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. Has Mr. McFarland asked you to
24	participate specifically in any of his cases?
25	A. I've not had any communication with
22
1	him on anything related to this.
2	Q. Do you know anything about the
3	scheduling of the Ferlanti case for trial?
4	A. No, I don't. Well, all I know is
5	that it was -- it was scheduled for trial in
6	early 2008. I seem to recall February was when
7	they were talking about it being -- and then for
8	reasons that are unknown to me, it was -- it
9	didn't go to trial.
10	Q. So, no one from -- neither Todd
11	McFarland--rephrase it.
12	Neither Todd McFarland or anyone
13	else from the Kelly, Uustal firm has contacted
14	you to ask you to testify live at the Ferlanti
15	case, correct?
16	A. Yeah. I don't know anything about
17	that.
18	Q. What did -- tell me about your
19	discussions with Matt Schultz about this
20	deposition and the deposition scheduled for
21	December 9th.
22	MR. SCHULTZ:
23	I'm going to invoke
24	privilege on that. We tried to
25	work out an arrangement, for the
23
1	record, with defendants on
2	exchanging materials, both
3	correspondence between counsel and
4	experts and communications
5	otherwise between counsel and
6	experts. Those overtures were
7	ignored. So, we're invoking the
8	privilege and work-product
9	doctrine and I'm going to instruct
10	him not to answer any questions
11	regarding the substance of
12	communications between he and I or
13	any other plaintiffs'counsel. I
14	don't mind the stuff on logistics,
15	but beyond that, once we get into
16	substance we will invoke a claim
17	of privilege and work-product
18	protection.
19	MR. GERAGHTY:
20	Let me make sure I'm clear.
21	It's your position that any
22	conversations you or Mr. Acosta
23	has had with Dr. Kyriakoudes about
24	the substance of his opinions or
25	his testimony is privileged.
24
1	MR. SCHULTZ:
2	That's correct and protected
3	by attorney work product, yes.
4	MR. KOETHE:
5	And you're instructing the
6	witness not to answer any of those
7	questions?
8	MR. SCHULTZ:
9	That's correct.
10	MR. GERAGHTY:
11	Well, I don't want to --
12	there's no point in debating
13	because if that's your position,
14	that's your position.
15	For the record, I don't
16	think that is a correct
17	application of either the
18	work-product doctrine or any
19	aspect of the attorney-client
20	privilege, but if you're going to
21	ask him not to -- instruct him not
22	to answer, then, we'll just move
23	on.
24	So, I take it then your
25	position would be that it would be
25
1	appropriate if a defense lawyer
2	raised those same objections if
3	you were taking the deposition of
4	a defense expert?
5	MR. SCHULTZ:
6	I'm not here to answer
7	questions, Bill. I'm telling you
8	what our position is. We tried to
9	work something out and you ignored
10	our request to work something out,
11	so, we didn't work anything out.
12	That's what it comes down to. And
13	we're not in federal court. If we
14	were in federal court, I think it
15	would be cut-and-dried, but we're
16	not, and it's not cut-and-dried
17	under Florida state court.
18	MR. GERAGHTY:
19	Okay. For the record, I
20	can't speak to your comment about
21	whether you tried to work it out
22	with anybody and what that is. I
23	was not involved with those
24	discussions.
25	MR. SCHULTZ:
26
1	Well, I personally was with
2	attorneys from your firm,
3	including Rafael Cruz-Alvarez, and
4	I also copied attorneys from
5	Jones, Day. So, be that as it
6	may, we are where we are.
7	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
8	Q. Well, what is your understanding of
9	the purpose of today's deposition?
10	A. Well, without being flippant, I
11	imagine today's deposition is for you to go
12	through the list of questions which I've been
13	posed many, many times in prior depositions with
14	you, Mr. Koethe, Mr. Rosenstein and other
15	members, but that this is, as in all prior
16	depositions, a chance for you to ascertain what
17	my testimony will be, what my opinions are at --
18	at the trial testimony.
19	Q. Okay. Who is the plaintiff in this
20	case?
21	MR. SCHULTZ:
22	Object to the form.
23	A. Well, my understanding is that this
24	deposition and then the videotaped deposition
25	will be noncase-specific, or applied to many,
27
1	many -- many plaintiffs.
2	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
3	Q. And when you say applied to many
4	plaintiffs, do you know who those plaintiffs are
5	specifically?
6	A. No, I don't.
7	Q. Do you know which particular lawyers
8	filed the cases on behalf of the plaintiffs to
9	which this deposition might apply?
10	A. You know, I've worked here with Mr.
11	Schultz and I have worked with Mr. Acosta, but,
12	no, I don't --1 don't keep up with that part of
13	the story.
14	Q. So, I mean, you don't know if
15	there's, for example, ten plaintiffs to which
16	this deposition might apply?
17	A. Well, that would certainly be -- the
18	number would -- the set would include probably
19	ten, yes. I think it's a bit more than that.
20	Q. Well, what is your understanding of
21	the ballpark figure of the number of plaintiffs
22	to which this deposition --
23	A. I think it —
24	Q. Excuse me -- and the deposition on
25	December 9th would apply?
28
1	A. Well, if this is related to the
2	various Engel class cases, it could be -- it
3	could be quite a large number indeed. I know
4	that I've been disclosed in about 70 cases with
5	Mr. Acosta's firm -- but I don't keep up on that,
6	so, I'm not really in a position to know that.
7	Q. How do you know that you've been
8	disclosed in about 70 cases from Mr. Acosta's
9	firm?
10	A. Because Mr. Koethe brought documents
11	in our last meeting in September where he had
12	them listed.
13	Q. Have you spoken to Mr. Acosta? Has
14	Mr. Acosta told you that this deposition will
15	apply to 70 cases?
16	A. No. No. Actually, I learned that
17	from Mr. Koethe.
18	Q. Has Mr. Schultz told you the number
19	of cases to which this deposition will apply?
20	A. No, he hasn't told me and nor have I
21	asked.
22	Q. Has Mr. Acosta told you the number
23	of plaintiffs to which this deposition will
24	apply?
25	A. No.
29
1	Q. Has any lawyer who's filed any
2	number of Engle progeny cases given you a
3	ballpark number as to the number of plaintiffs to
4	which this deposition will apply?
5	A. No.
6	Q. And if -- do you have an
7	understanding as to whether the number of
8	plaintiffs exceeds 100 for purposes of this
9	deposition and the deposition on December 9th?
10	MR. SCHULTZ:
11	Asked and answered.
12	A. No, I don't have any -- any
13	knowledge either way. I can only conjecture, but
14	I don't know.
15	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
16	Q. Let me just make sure we're clear.
17	Other than Mr. Schultz and Mr. Acosta, have you
18	had any discussions about today's deposition or
19	the deposition that is scheduled for December
20	9th?
21	A. With other attorneys?
22	Q. Yes, sir.
23	A. No. No, I haven't. None
24	whatsoever.
25	Q. Based on -- well, strike that.
30
1	Is it -- do you have an
2	understanding that your testimony on December 9th
3	is going to be in any way different from your
4	testimony, say, in cases like Beckum or Arnitz or
5	the Hall case?
6	A. No. No. I've been deposed, you
7	know, over 20 times, I believe, and I've appeared
8	in trials numerous times. You have direct-
9	examined me in at least one trial, the Amitz
10	trial. Was it more than that? I'm not
11	remembering. You've deposed me a number of
12	times. Mr. Koethe's deposed me four or five
13	times. Mr. Rosenstein has deposed me once. I
14	stand by the accumulated testimony that I've
15	given. I don't, you know --1 stand by
16	everything I've testified in the past, and that
17	is in keeping with what I intend to testify in
18	the future.
19	Q. Okay. I'm not sure you really
20	answered my question, but let's just be clear.
21	A. Sorry.
22	Q. Is it your understanding -- if you
23	could answer this "yes" or "no" and then
24	elaborate, I think that would be helpful, if you
25	can.
31
1	A. Oh, okay.
2	Q. Is it your understanding that what
3	you're going to testify about on December 9th is
4	any different from the testimony you've given at
5	trial in the Beckum, the Amitz and the Hall
6	case, for example?
7	A. No different.
8	Q. Thank you. Are you -- is your
9	semester over at the University of Southern
10	Mississippi?
11	A. Not yet, no.
12	Q. When does the semester end?
13	A. Last day of class is December 4th.
14	So, that's -- then, we have final exams and
15	grades are due. So, I forget the day that my
16	grades are due, but it ends approximately --
17	let's see. Friday, the 11th or 12th, is
18	graduation. So, I guess that's when it ends.
19	Q. As of December 4th, you will have no
20	further teaching responsibilities for the end of
21	the year --or for the end of the semester?
22	A. That's right. There's the giving an
23	exam, but I can have a graduate student, you
24	know, hand out the exam and proctor the exam, as
25	is my normal practice.
32
1	Q. So, you don't normally sit there and
2	administer the exam yourself?
3	A. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.
4	It depends what I've got going on that day.
5	Q. But if, for some reason, you need to
6	be someplace else, you can have a graduate
7	student administer the exam for you?
8	A. Yes. Also, I have administrative
9	duties, so, my schedule has become very tight,
10	just as a point of information for you, and I
11	think you would agree that I'm -- over the many
12	years we've done this, I've been accommodating on
13	schedules, and I've prided myself on that, in
14	terms of being flexible so that they're not in
15	places where we're uncomfortable and the like.
16	I'm happy to do that. Just as a personal note,
17	my schedule has become very, very tight.
18	Q. You know, I'm going to ask you some
19	questions about that in a little bit, but what
20	I'm really just trying to figure out -- well, let
21	me ask you this: Has Mr. Paige, Gary Paige,
22	asked you to testify in the Hess or Sherman
23	cases?
24	A. Yes, and I've been in conversations
25	with him about scheduling that.
33
1	Q. All right. Do you have a flight
2	scheduled to go to Fort Lauderdale?
3	A. I have not yet made a flight, but
4	I'm happy to share with you the day that he would
5	like me to come testify.
6	Q. When does he want you to come
7	testify?
8	MR. SCHULTZ:
9	Let me object to the line of
10	questioning. This has absolutely
11	nothing to do with the reason
12	we're here today. I can't stop
13	the question, of course, but this
14	is just a waste of time.
15	MR. GERAGHTY:
16	Well, you know what, the
17	amount of time it's going to take
18	is going to be less than the
19	objection, I promise you. So, if
20	you're just patient for a few more
21	minutes longer, we'll be moving
22	on.
23	A. Right now, Mr. Paige would like me
24	to testify on that Monday --oh, God. I don't
25	have my calendar with me, but I guess it's the
34
1	second Monday in December. Is that the 8th?
2	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
3	Q. That would be December 8th.
4	A. Yes. Right. Okay.
5	Q. So, are you traveling to Florida on
6	Sunday, December 7th?
7	A. Yes, I will arrive in Florida that
8	evening, fly in that night and arrive a bit late
9	because I have a church function with my family
10	that day and I can't leave until about 5:00.
11	Q. So, you anticipate testifying in the
12	Hess case on December 8th?
13	A. Right now, that's what the
14	discussion has been, yes.
15	Q. All right. Well, because you've
16	already committed to testifying in Tampa on
17	December 9th and 10th, correct?
18	A. That's right. So, the scheduling
19	has gotten quite tight. My thinking is that that
20	Monday night, I could fly or drive or somehow get
21	from Fort Lauderdale to Tampa.
22	Q. Have you discussed the scheduling of
23	this -- strike that.
24	You've obviously discussed the
25	scheduling of all this with Mr. Paige, correct?
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. Have you discussed the scheduling of
3	what you've just told me with Mr. Schultz?
4	A. Somewhat, yes, I think. I think,
5	yeah, I've discussed it.
6	Q. Okay. Well, tell me what you and
7	Mr. Schultz have discussed.
8	A. Trying to arrange all this to work
9	out. I've e-mailed him and cc'd Mr. Paige and
10	basically said y'all work something out. I'm not
11	able--
12	Q. I'm sorry --
13	A. Ubiquity is not one of my -- a good
14	Catholic boy, that's a good quality of becoming a
15	saint and I'm no saint. But, you know, and to
16	have them work out these schedules. You know, I
17	can't be two places at once.
18	Q. You have always tried to do your
19	best to be accommodating to whether it's the
20	plaintiffs' counsel or the defense counsel in
21	terms of scheduling, whether it's a deposition or
22	trial, correct?
23	A. I have, yes.
24	Q. Let me ask you this: When does the
25	semester resume or -- when does your spring
1	semester resume at the University of Southern
2	Mississippi?
3	A. Classes begin around the 15th of
4	January, but, again, I should clarify that just
5	so you understand. I have a new position which I
6	moved into with the new fiscal year July 1. So,
7	my main job is administering the center. I only
8	teach one class now a semester. That's a
9	reduction from three classes a semester.
10	Q. What class are you going to teach in
11	the spring?
12	A. I'm teaching a graduate seminar
13	called U.S. Historiography II, which is a
14	intensive examination of historical themes since
15	1865 for our graduate students.
16	Q. And has -- have the students already
17	had to sign up for that course?
18	A. Yeah. We've had preregistration,
19	but we always have people sign up, too, just
20	before the semester begins.
21	Q. How many students currently are
22	enrolled in that class?
23	A. I haven't checked my --1 haven't
24	checked the online --
25	Q. What's the limit that you would
1	accept for the course?
2	A. Oh, yeah, I wouldn't want more than
3	25. I hope --1 once had one that large and it
4	was too many.
5	Q. And is this a -- would this be for
6	Master's-level students?
7	A. Master's and Ph.D.-level. They
8	throw them in together.
9	Q. So, you're not teaching any what
10	I'll call Bachelor-level courses next spring?
11	A. Not the spring, no.
12	Q. And what is the schedule going to be
13	for the classes you have for this course in the
14	spring?
15	A. Wednesday night, 6:30 to 9:15, room
16	to be announced.
17	MR. GERAGHTY:
18	Off the record.
19	(Whereupon, a discussion was
20	held off the record.)
21	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
22	Q. Let me ask you this: Are you
23	scheduled -- we've talked about Hess. We've
24	talked about the deposition on December 9th in
25	Tampa. Are you currently scheduled to give a
38
1	deposition in any other case right now?
2	A. No. No.
3	Q. Are you scheduled to appear at any
4	trial other than the Hess trial we've talked
5	about?
6	A. No firm dates, no. I haven't
7	scheduled anything.
8	Q. Well, have you had discussions with
9	anybody about participating in other trials?
10	A. Gary Paige made mention that, you
11	know, the other set of the plaintiffs, Cohen
12	and --1 forget -- and the like may be coming up
13	in the spring, but no dates. Just that it might
14	be happening.
15	Q. All right. Let me try to clarify
16	that. When we were here in September to take
17	your deposition, it was for the purposes of four
18	particular cases, Hess, Stephens, Sherman and
19	Cohen, correct?
20	A. (Nods head affirmatively.)
21	Q. So, based upon what you've told me,
22	is it correct that Mr. Paige has asked you if you
23	will participate in the remaining cases, the
24	remainder of those four cases, whenever they
25	might be scheduled for trial?
39
1	A. Yes, that's my understanding.
2	Q. And he's asked you to come live,
3	correct?
4	MR. SCHULTZ:
5	I'm going to make the same
6	objection I made before.
7	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
8	Q. Has he asked you to come live?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And you've agreed to come live,
11	correct?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. You just don't know when those cases
14	might be scheduled for trial?
15	A. I don't, no.
16	Q. And assuming you can manage it with
17	your course responsibilities and your other
18	administrative responsibilities, your intent
19	would be to testify live, as you told Mr. Paige?
20	A. Yes, I'm happy to come in person.
21	Q. We talked a little bit about your--
22	strike that.
23	When we were here in September, you
24	told us that you had taken on a new position as
25	the director for the Center of Oral History at
40
1	the University of Southern Mississippi, correct?
2	A. That's right.
3	Q. All right. And you --1 don't want
4	to ask you a whole bunch of questions about that
5	because Mr. Koethe covered that extensively in
6	September. My question really is: Since
7	September and since you've now gotten more
8	involved in that center, presumably, have your
9	responsibilities changed? Just give me an
10	overview of what your responsibilities are
11	currently with that center.
12	A. There's been no change since
13	September. You know, my job overall is to, you
14	know, administer the center, which means managing
15	the staff, maintaining the budgets, writing
16	grants, working with our external funders,
17	promoting the use of oral history, you know, in
18	the region and in our scholarly work and in
19	working with faculty to kind of advocate for this
20	particular manner of research.
21	Q. Let me break up a little bit what
22	you just said to me. You said administer or
23	supervise the staff. Who is on staff at that
24	center?
25	A. We have --
41
1	Q. I don't need the names. I mean just
2	numbers and job description.
3	A. We have a full-time editor. We have
4	an administrative assistant who -- her
5	responsibilities are helping keep the accounts,
6	doing staff -- center paperwork, I should say.
7	She's also our sound engineer. So, she digitizes
8	tapes and maintains the databases that hold our
9	recorded collections. We have another -- two
10	full-time transcriptionists, and their jobs are
11	to listen to the tapes and transcribe them, much
12	as the court reporter is doing here today. And
13	then we have graduate students who perform
14	various tasks. And we have how many graduate
15	students working in the office -- one, two,
16	three -- four graduate assistants who are
17	essentially research assistants, and they do
18	various tasks, and then we have an undergraduate
19	work/study student.
20	Q. Has your salary at the University of
21	Southern Mississippi changed since what you told
22	us back in September?
23	A. No.
24	Q. Has your -- you mentioned sort of a
25	summer stipend that you also receive.
42
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. Has that changed since September?
3	A. No, there's been no change.
4	Q. You mentioned among the things that
5	the center does, writing grants. Are you in the
6	process of writing any grants currently?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. What -- to whom are you seeking
9	funding or from whom are you seeking funding?
10	A. The National Endowment for the
11	Humanities, the State of Mississippi state
12	legislature, to give us an appropriation, and we
13	are working to renew that in these tough budget
14	times. And I have a set of grant proposals that
15	I'm collaborating with with other faculty, and
16	we're putting together the proposals, the
17	research proposals, and then we're going to go
18	seek the funding agencies. So, those are a
19	little bit earlier in the process. So, we don't
20	have -- to put it another way, we haven't yet
21	identified a funding agency for those grants.
22	Q. Are any of the grants that you're in
23	the process of preparing -- would they be seeking
24	funding for any issues related to your role as an
25	expert witness in the tobacco issues that we've
43
1	talked about at your last several depositions?
2	A. No. Right now, no.
3	Q. Okay. You had mentioned in
4	September plans in the future to perhaps seek
5	some funding to do some oral histories of
6	individuals in Mississippi about health issues
7	that would include tobacco. Do you recall that?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. Has anything further developed as
10	far as that's concerned since September?
11	A. No. That one, because of the nature
12	of the people I work with, we're actually
13	privileging or putting first in line a series of
14	grants related to mental health issues that are
15	health-related. So, we're going to put those
16	through this year. The tobacco stuff, health,
17	diet, overweight --1 mean diet, chronic disease
18	interviews will probably be either later in this
19	fiscal year or early in the next fiscal year,
20	meaning late spring or early summer of '09, that
21	we'll start working on those.
22	Q. Okay. So, right now, you're not
23	currently working on it, right?
24	A. No, right.
25	Q. But your expectation is by maybe
44
1	spring or fall of 2009, you might begin to start
2	that process?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. Okay. Do you have -- let me ask you
5	this: Are you working on any -- are you writing
6	any papers or --
7	A. Yeah. I'm sighing because I've been
8	so swamped. Yeah, I have a number of things
9	which -- that I need to get finished in various
10	states of overdueness. I'm working on a paper
11	looking at the demography of the internal slave
12	trade for inclusion in a edited collection, peer-
13	reviewed collection of essays, and I've got to
14	get that done over Christmas break, and then some
15	smaller writings. Right now, my deadlines are
16	such that I'm not -- and this is probably in
17	anticipation of your next question -- I'm not
18	writing anything on tobacco right now.
19	Q. Let me just be more specific. I
20	appreciate that. Are you working on any papers
21	that might relate to the public's perception of
22	the health risks of cigarette-smoking at any
23	point in time?
24	A. Not right now, no.
25	Q. And as we sit here today, you
45
1	haven't published anything in a peer-reviewed
2	journal that relates to the public's perceptions
3	of the health risks of cigarette-smoking,
4	correct?
5	A. Well, I think my piece in Tobacco
6	Control would fall into that, so, that would be
7	an incorrect statement.
8	Q. Let's set that aside because we may
9	not agree as to what that really deals with. But
10	setting that particular article aside, you
11	haven't written anything that discusses the
12	public's perception of the health risks of
13	cigarette-smoking in any other peer-reviewed
14	journal, correct?
15	A. Well, in addition to that piece,
16	which came out in a leading journal on tobacco --
17	Tobacco Control -- leading journal in the field,
18	I published one commissioned piece on the R. J.
19	Reynolds' use of the Grand Ole Opry and to the
20	extent that the advertising is part of the mix of
21	how the public gets information about the
22	product, I mean, that would fall under that
23	category.
24	Q. Well, but, that article, the one on
25	the Grand Ole Opry, doesn't have any discussion
46
1	in it about how the public perceived that
2	campaign or the health risks of smoking, right?
3	A. That's true, yes. It's about R. J.
4	Reynolds' statements.
5	Q. And it's not published in a
6	peer-reviewed journal, is it?
7	A. The journal is peer-reviewed. That
8	particular piece was commissioned by the editor.
9	Q. So, it wasn't a peer-reviewed
10	article itself?
11	A. No. It didn't go through the
12	double-blind, peer-review process itself.
13	Q. The article you mentioned in Tobacco
14	Control, the focus of that was really the
15	testimony of defense historians on the public's
16	perception of the health risks of smoking,
17	correct?
18	A. That's true, but as you've, no
19	doubt, read the piece, there's an extensive
20	discussion also on the public's appraisal of this
21	and as an historical phenomenon.
22	Q. Okay. But you're not currently
23	working on anything right now that would address
24	the public's understanding or perceptions of the
25	health risks of smoking for any peer-reviewed
47
1	journal, correct?
2	A. No, not right now at this moment,
3	no.
4	Q. Do you have any plans to do that in
5	the next six months ?
6	A. Yeah. No. Once I get over this
7	hump of the slave-trade paper and the backlog of
8	some other work, I'm turning my attention to my
9	cigarette -- writing of my cigarette research
10	in-
11	Q. Do you have a particular -- let me
12	just ask you this: Do you have a particular
13	article in mind or are you talking about your --
14	you've told us at several depositions in the past
15	that you had kind of an idea to write a book
16	about --
17	A. Yeah. No. I had -
18	Q. Let me finish -- write a book, the
19	subject of which would be the testimony you've
20	given in past trials, the substance of the
21	testimony; is that right?
22	A. That would be part of the book, yes.
23	Q. Well, are you -- are you thinking of
24	something different from that, or are you telling
25	me that's what you're thinking about doing once
48
1	you finish the demography article?
2	A. Same thing. Same project. Just
3	kind of put that to bed, get that done as much as
4	possible this spring and summer.
5	Q. Are you currently doing any research
6	on any tobacco-related issues?
7	A. Yeah. I'm doing extensive research.
8	I mean, this is -- this is my main area of
9	primary source investigation.
10	Q. Well, what are you currently
11	researching? Bring me up to speed from when we
12	last spoke to you in September in terms of any
13	new or additional research you're doing on
14	tobacco-related issues.
15	A. Oh, I continue, you know, my reading
16	of industry documents, focusing on anything that
17	industry researchers developed or collected that
18	touches on the social conventions of smoking, the
19	social acceptability of smoking, how people
20	perceived cigarettes, how people understood the
21	various risks involved in smoking and those
22	questions. I'm constantly reading and -- in
23	those areas.
24	Q. Well, with all due respect, that's
25	extremely broad and extremely vague. Can you be
49
1	any more specific about anything you've read or
2	looked at since September?
3	A. Right. So that you can go to my
4	documents and try to pull out anything that's new
5	or help you understand what my thinking is.
6	Q. You don't need to interpret my
7	question. Can you be any more specific than the
8	answer you just gave?
9	A. Yes, I can. Well, let me make sure
10	I understand. What you're saying, have there
11	been any new things I've found that have
12	particularly impressed me or been important to me
13	in my thinking about this topic?
14	Q. Let's start there.
15	A. Okay. I'm working with you.
16	I've been reading in marketing
17	research surveys and marketing studies and I've
18	found some interesting things lately. I can't
19	remember the exact citations of the documents,
20	but they're in my disclosure to you. One thing
21	that really comes to mind is, I believe, the R.
22	J. Reynolds papers, a qualitative study asking
23	about perceptions of addiction versus habituation
24	related to smoking.
25	Q. All right. Let me see if we can
50
1	break that down a little bit. You mentioned --
2	the last thing you said was a -- you called it an
3	R. J. Reynolds qualitative study addressing
4	people's views on habituation versus addiction of
5	cigarette-smoking?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. What document are you talking about?
8	A. I don't have the -- you know, the
9	Bates number and that kind of thing memorized,
10	but I can get that for you and would happily do
11	so. It is a extensive list of essentially
12	interviews -- interview summaries.
13	Q. Interviews with whom?
14	A. Smokers.
15	Q. And who was conducting the
16	interviews?
17	A. Without having it in front of me, I
18	can't exactly recall who specifically.
19	Q. Well, let me ask you, was it
20	somebody who was an -- employed by R. J.
21	Reynolds, as you understand it, or was it some
22	outside organization who was retained by or hired
23	by R. J. Reynolds to do this work?
24	A. I'm not sure at this moment. I
25	would have to refresh my memory on the document,
51
1	but it would be one or the other.
2	Q. What's the date of the document?
3	A. It's fairly recent. I believe it's
4	from the 1990s.
5	Q. How did you find the document?
6	A. Kind of a serendipity. I was
7	just -- you know, you do these searches and
8	you're looking for something, and as so often is
9	the case, because of the nature of the keyword
10	searches, I mostly use the Legacy portal now, you
11	come up with stuff and you look at one thing and
12	one thing leads to another. So, serendipity was
13	the-
14	Q. Were you searching online for
15	documents through the Legacy database, is that
16	what you're telling me?
17	A. Yeah, and I'm constantly doing that.
18	Q. When did you find this document,
19	approximately?
20	A. This fall. This fall.
21	Q. You had never seen it before?
22	A. No.
23	Q. Did a plaintiffs lawyer, like Mr.
24	Schultz or Mr. Acosta, alert you to the document?
25	A. No. No. I have not been alerted to
52
1	any documents by any plaintiffs attorney this
2	fall.
3	Q. Have you discussed this document
4	with anybody?
5	A. No, I haven't.
6	Q. What were the searches that you were
7	doing? Describe for me the word searches you
8	were doing.
9	A. I was --1 forget exactly what terms
10	I put in because, you know, you -- there's two
11	ways to search. You put things in in the
12	keywords, but, now, you can also kind of look for
13	documents that are next to it in the Bates order.
14	There's a little arrow at the top. So, you can
15	kind of -- so, it's like an almost virtual
16	reading of the file, so to speak. So, I do both.
17	Generally, what I have been interested in and how
18	I came across this was I was looking for things
19	on addiction and habit. That was the general --
20	that may not have been the actual terms that I
21	put in, but that's what I was researching.
22	Perceptions of smoking as either an addiction or
23	as a habit.
24	Q. Why were you interested in that
25	particular issue?
1	A. Well, I mean, that's one of the
2	big -- that's one of the big issues in my
3	research, is how -- in terms of how people
4	perceived and understood and how -- what they
5	knew to be true about the risks of smoking. Part
6	of that was cancer, heart disease, emphysema,
7	those illnesses, but part of it, too, was their
8	understanding as to whether it was addictive or
9	not.
10	Q. So, when, roughly, did you start
11	doing these searches that led you to find this
12	document? You said the fall, but that's a very
13	lengthy period of time.
14	A. Right. You know, it was after the
15	deposition that we had in September. Probably in
16	October.
17	Q. Were you doing this search with any
18	particular case in mind?
19	A. No, no case in mind.
20	Q. Were you doing this search at the
21	request of anybody in particular?
22	A. No.
23	Q. Did you feel that your understanding
24	of this issue was less than what you would --
25	well, let me rephrase that question. That was
1	badly worded.
2	Did you do this research because you
3	thought your knowledge on this particular issue,
4	people's views of cigarettes as being addictive
5	versus a habit, was inadequate?
6	A. No.
7	Q. Did you search for anything other
8	than on the Legacy website?
9	A. You mean other portals to access the
10	documents?
11	Q. Well, where -- let me back up.
12	That's a good point. Besides tobacco company
13	document -- you were searching R. J. Reynolds
14	documents, right?
15	A. Yeah, R. J. Reynolds was in -- these
16	days now, when I run a search, I run for all --
17	all of the available documents. I don't, you
18	know -- my normal practice is to search whatever
19	is available in the database.
20	Q. Right. So, when you're doing your
21	search, you're searching R. J. Reynolds
22	documents, Brown & Williamson documents,
23	Lorillard documents, Liggett documents, to the
24	extent they're available, and Philip Morris
25	documents, correct?
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. My question is: Did you search any
3	other source of information besides tobacco
4	company documents?
5	A. No. When I use the Legacy database,
6	I'm looking for industry documents.
7	Q. My point is, though, my question is:
8	When you were in this search of whether people
9	viewed cigarette-smoking as an addiction versus a
10	habit, did you look at any other source of
11	information or material besides tobacco industry
12	documents?
13	A. When I was doing this, no, I was
14	interested in looking at tobacco industry
15	documents.
16	Q. You didn't look at any particular
17	newspaper, right?
18	A. I have done that. I've done a lot
19	of research in newspapers, which I've, of course,
20	given you plenty of that.
21	Q. My question is: When you did this
22	search in the fall, you weren't looking at any
23	particular newspaper, were you?
24	A. Not when I came up with this
1	Q. Okay. You weren't looking at any
2	public health community statements, right, public
3	health authority statements, right?
4	A. Well, as a matter of fact, you know,
5	it's one of the interesting things about the
6	industry documents, is that there is a ton of
7	material from the public health community in
8	there. So, you actually do search that. You do
9	come up with things responsive to that.
10	Q. My question is: Did you search
11	specifically for public health authority
12	statements related to the subject of whether
13	people viewed cigarette-smoking as an addiction
14	or habit when you conducted this search in
15	October?
16	A. Right. No, I didn't, because I
17	wasn't interested in that at the time. What I
18	was looking for were things that explored the
19	smokers' perceptions of smoking as an addiction
20	or habit. I mean, it is an interesting question
21	as to whether the public health community as a
22	matter of state of the art viewed smoking as a
23	habit or an addiction, but I've never testified
24	to that. My research is on the smoker, not on
25	the science or the public health community. So,
57
1	I was really looking for things where I could
2	hear smokers' voices through interviews, focus
3	groups or what have you, or polling data,
4	marketing data, anything like that. And my
5	experience has been because the industry was --
6	had both significant amount of resources, but
7	also an interest in these questions, they tended
8	to run very good studies on this -- on this
9	subject. They're a very good window into the
10	mind of the smoker.
11	Q. Well, the truth is you are not
12	really qualified to evaluate whether the studies
13	were conducted well or not; isn't that right?
14	A. I would disagree with that
15	completely.
16	Q. You're not an expert in polling, are
17	you?
18	A. Oh, I'm qualified to assess polling
19	and the methodology of conducting survey
20	research, yes. I am qualified for that. So,
21	again, I disagree with your statement.
22	Q. Are you an expert in evaluating
23	polling data?
24	MR. SCHULTZ:
25	Object to the form.
58
1	A. I'm an expert in evaluating survey
2	data, which polling is a subset.
3	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
4	Q. And is your expertise stemming from
5	your work in the field of demography? Is that
6	what you're referring to?
7	A. Yeah, my training at the Carolina
8	Population Center, my training at the graduate
9	school in statistical methods.
10	Q. Have you done any work since, let's
11	say, December of last year, when you were deposed
12	in the Ferlanti case and the Connecticut case,
13	which, for the record, Ertman and Izarelli, have
14	you done any work designed to provide you with
15	any expertise on evaluating survey data or
16	polling data?
17	MR. SCHULTZ:
18	Object to the form.
19	A. You mean, like, coursework?
20	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
21	Q. Yes, sir.
22	A. No, I have not taken any coursework.
23	Q. So, you haven't taken any kind of
24	formal courses in the last year, since December
25	of 2007, designed to give you expertise on either
59
1	evaluating polling data or survey data, correct?
2	A. Right. I don't need to.
3	Q. You don't think you need to?
4	A. No. I'm totally qualified to do
5	that.
6	Q. Okay.
7	A. I work with my own -- you know,
8	unlike most people who simply photocopy the polls
9	out of books, I acquire the raw data myself and
10	manipulate the data on my own through my
11	statistical program and work with it, and that
12	allows me to ask more refined and more
13	sophisticated questions of the data.
14	Q. You said you acquire the raw data.
15	What are you referring to?
16	A. Oh, the -- well, the case of Gallup
17	polls, the actual database of the poll
18	respondents, the actual database.
19	Q. Well, since when have you been
20	acquiring raw data for any particular Gallup
21	poll?
22	A. You know, I've disclosed to you in
23	my various presentations -- you'll see the table
24	that I've constructed from that data. I couldn't
25	tell you when, but it's available.
60
1	Q. But isn't it true that you haven't
2	acquired -- you didn't begin to acquire raw data
3	for any poll having to do with the public's
4	perceptions of the health risks of cigarette -
5	smoking until approximately a year and a half
6	ago, right?
7	A. Yeah, when it became available to
8	me. Yeah.
9	Q. It was unavailable to you
10	beforehand?
11	A. If it was available, I wasn't aware
12	of it.
13	Q. Well, when did it become available
14	to you?
15	A. You know, when I say "available," I
16	mean the ability to acquire the actual -- the
17	databases. My first foray -- all this is through
18	a -- a center called Roper Center For Public
19	Opinion, which is hosted by the University of
20	Connecticut and they maintain an online portal.
21	You know, back --1 did a lot of polling research
22	in 2000 and again in 2002, and at that time, all
23	I could get from them were the questions. You
24	could get the questions and the responses to the
25	questions.
61
1	Q. What's the name of the service that
2	enables you to acquire the raw data from these
3	polls?
4	A. The Roper Center for Public Opinion.
5	Q. Is there a website by which you
6	access the database?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. Is it called iPOLL?
9	A. That may well be the URL. I've
10	accessed it through the University of North
11	Carolina library.
12	Q. Let me make sure we're clear about
13	several things. Are you saying you actually
14	tried to acquire this data as early as 2000?
15	A. Well, what I'm saying is the first
16	time I did work in polls through the Roper
17	Center, what I could get from them was simply the
18	question responses, you know. Here's the
19	question and these are the respondents -- you
20	know, statements. This many said yes and this
21	many said no, what have you. I've disclosed that
22	to you guys over the years. But since then,
23	sometime -- and to be honest with you, I can't
24	exactly remember when, but either I learned or
25	they made available -- it could be either case --
62
1	that you could actually download the entire file
2	of the poll. Typically, in the case of Gallup,
3	they usually have about 1,500 respondents. So,
4	you could download all 1,500 cases in a database.
5	I use SPSS. That's my preferred statistical
6	package. I could put that in SPSS, and then I
7	could manipulate the data any way I want. I've
8	included this in one of my presentations that I
9	disclosed to you. There's one of the tables I
10	generated from this.
11	Q. My question, though, is you had
12	never obtained any raw data from any poll for
13	Gallup or Roper or any other organization more
14	than a year and a half ago; is that right in?
15	MR. SCHULTZ:
16	Asked and answered.
17	A. I can't remember exactly when. I
18	know that in 2002,1 had the -- what I had was
19	the response data from the poll, and then
20	sometime between then and now, I learned that I
21	could get the actual raw data and manipulate it
22	myself.
23	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
24	Q. And this information has always been
25	publicly available, hasn't it?
63
1	A. What information?
2	Q. The raw data you're talking about
3	was available in 2000 and 2002, correct?
4	MR. SCHULTZ:
5	Asked and answered.
6	MR. GERAGHTY:
7	That has not been asked and
8	answered.
9	MR. SCHULTZ:
10	He just spent five minutes
11	describing all of this.
12	MR. GERAGHTY:
13	No. You weren't listening.
14	MR. SCHULTZ:
15	Excuse me. We're not going
16	to do that in this deposition, all
17	right? I've made my objection.
18	We're not going to have these
19	little barbs back and forth.
20	MR. GERAGHTY:
21	I don't want to have barbs
22	either, Matt, but the question was
23	not asked and answered.
24	A. Run it at me again and I'll do my
25	best to answer it.
64
1	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
2	Q. This polling data from Roper and
3	Gallup was publicly available if you knew how to
4	access it as early as 2000 and 2002, correct?
5	A. I don't know that.
6	Q. You didn't know how to access it in
7	2000, correct?
8	MR. SCHULTZ:
9	Object to the form.
10	A. Well, I'd have to establish whether
11	it was easily available. I mean, publicly
12	available, all I know is that in my interaction
13	with the Roper database, I was able to get an
14	index of all their questions. So, I knew what
15	their questions were and what the responses were
16	to their questions, but that at some point in the
17	last few years, they made -- either they made
18	available or I found how to do the -- the ability
19	to actually download the file, either a logical
20	record file or an SPSS file. They come in a
21	variety of formats. And once I learned that,
22	then, I was able to download the data, manipulate
23	it myself and make it suit my -- you know, my
24	specific research needs.
25	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
65
1	Q. And when were you first able to do
2	that? That's my question.
3	A. I first did it, let's say that --
4	that would be more precise --1 first did that --
5	it's been in the last couple of years or so, but
6	I couldn't tell you exactly when.
7	Q. Well, it's been in the last year and
8	a half, going back to, let's say, July, 2007,
9	correct?
10	MR. SCHULTZ:
11	Asked and answered.
12	A. You know, I'd have to sit and look
13	at the date, you know, that I -- the only way I
14	could -- to give you an adequate answer to that
15	is to look at the date that -- maybe the file
16	save date. You have that, so, you can look in
17	there. I gave you everything.
18	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
19	Q. You're saying we can determine that
20	based upon the reliance materials you gave us.
21	We can figure out when you downloaded it from the
22	database?
23	A. Well, let me do that. You know, let
24	me -- and I could give you a more precise answer.
25	Q. Doctor, what I want to know now is:
66
1	You don't know whether you had accessed this data
2	at any time prior to July of 2007, correct?
3	A. I'd have to check my records.
4	Q. So, you don't know whether you
5	downloaded this data at any point earlier than
6	July of 2007, correct?
7	A. At this point, no, I don't. I'd
8	have to check my records, check my notes, which
9	I'd be happy to do so I can give you a more
10	precise answer.
11	Q. Do you have to pay to have access to
12	these databases?
13	A. I didn't. They were --1 just went
14	to the library of the University of North
15	Carolina to a computer terminal and accessed the
16	website through their portal. My university, as
17	far as I know, doesn't subscribe to the service.
18	Q. So, you can download these files
19	free of charge if you do it at the University of
20	North Carolina's library?
21	A. I could, yes, that's right, and I
22	would imagine you could do the same thing, yes.
23	Q. And are you telling us you don't
24	remember when you went to the University of North
25	Carolina and did this?
67
1	A. I go there a lot. You know, I'm a
2	very busy person. You know, as you may know,
3	until this summer, you know, I lived in Chapel
4	Hill. So, I -- it was a regular process for me
5	to go to that library all the time. So, to pick
6	one day out of the many hundreds and hundreds of
7	days that I went to the library would be --
8	Q. Did you -- when was the last time
9	you were at the University of North Carolina's
10	library?
11	A. Oh, this summer.
12	Q. Did you go this summer to the
13	library and access polling data from either the
14	Roper or the Gallup organization or any other
15	organization?
16	A. I don't think I did this summer.
17	The summer of '08,1 was pretty busy and I didn't
18	have a lot of time in the library. So, no, I
19	definitely didn't do it this summer. I had
20	already done it prior to that.
21	Q. Did you do it in the summer of 2007?
22	A. I'd have to go back and look at
23	my -- did you bring those disks with you that --
24	Q. I don't have the disks with me.
25	A. You know, if I looked at my notes, I
68
1	could give you a more precise answer since it
2	seems important for you to have it.
3	Q. You have notes on the disks?
4	A. No. I would look at the date that I
5	saved the file. That would give me a precise
6	answer. Because, you know, you download these
7	things, and when you save it onto a file, the
8	date would indicate when I downloaded it.
9	Q. So, you think you can look at the
10	file on that disk and determine when you would
11	have downloaded the information?
12	A. Right, but I've supplied that to you
13	in my disclosure. So, you have it, too.
14	Q. I have your disks --
15	A. Yeah.
16	Q. -- which I got, I don't remember
17	exactly, but within the last ten days.
18	A. Yeah.
19	Q. Doctor, there is data on those disks
20	that you've never produced in tobacco litigation
21	previously, right?
22	A. It's possible, yeah, because this
23	time, what I did was, given the -- you know, the
24	expansiveness of your requests, I simply put a
25	memory stick --an eight-gig memory stick and
69
1	simply saved it all to that stick and then I
2	mailed it to the attorneys. So, I erred on the
3	side of completeness.
4	Q. What do you mean, the expansiveness
5	of our requests?
6	A. You -- basically, I interpreted it
7	to mean that, you know, everything I've ever --
8	ever looked at.
9	Q. What did Mr. Schultz tell you you
10	were obligated to provide us?
11	MR. SCHULTZ:
12	He's not going to talk about
13	conversations we had.
14	MR. GERAGHTY:
15	You're taking the position
16	that it's -- I'm not allowed to
17	ask him what you and he talked
18	about in terms of his obligation
19	to produce documents to us to
20	prepare for this deposition and
21	the deposition on December 9th?
22	MR. SCHULTZ:
23	That's right.
24	MR. GERAGHTY:
25	Okay. I disagree with that.
70
1	The only thing I will say is I
2	think we're entitled to know all
3	that information, and I don't want
4	to have to come back because
5	that's going to threaten December
6	9th. So, all I'm asking you is to
7	think long and hard about whether
8	that's the position you want to
9	take.
10	MR. SCHULTZ:
11	I 've thought long and hard
12	about it. As I said before, we
13	tried to work something out. The
14	defendants were not willing to
15	work something out, so, we haven't
16	worked anything out. So, our
17	position is what I suspect your
18	position will be, and that is that
19	those conversations of that nature
20	are attorney work product and will
21	not be disclosed. We've got a
22	case management conference in
23	front of Judge Terrell on December
24	4th. If you want to tee this
25	issue up, let's tee it up and get
1	it resolved. I'm happy to do it.
2	Either way. It makes no
3	difference to me what the answer
4	is, but there's going to be
5	parity, consistency between the
6	parties.
7	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
8	Q. So, Doctor, you know, though, that
9	there's polling data and analysis of polling data
10	on those disks that you've never produced before,
11	before the disks were provided to us; isn't that
12	right?
13	A. I guess if I gave -- if I gave you
14	the underlying databases, yeah. I mean, not that
15	there's anything you can do with those, but --
16	Q. You've never produced those in any
17	cases you've testified previously, right?
18	A. No. Just the results of the
19	analysis of the tables that I've generated.
20	Q. And isn't that because you've only
21	very recently obtained the data itself?
22	A. Well, I haven't done a case in a
23	long time. I mean, the last case that I
24	testified at in tobacco litigation was in 2005.
25	Q. You gave depositions in July of 2007
1	and in December of 2007 in which you were asked
2	to produce reliance materials, right?
3	A. Yeah, that's right.
4	Q. And you produced reliance materials
5	in both of those instances, and in neither of
6	those instances did you ever produce any raw data
7	that you had downloaded from some database,
8	right?
9	A. Yeah. I mean, I've always tried to
10	give you everything, so --
11	Q. Doctor, look--
12	A. I'm not able to tell you exactly
13	when I downloaded right here, sitting here. At
14	the beginning of the deposition, you pointed out
15	that there are 37,000 pages of documents in my
16	disclosure and, so, you know, I try to keep it
17	straight, but that's a lot of pages to keep up
18	with.
19	MR. GERAGHTY:
20	I'm going to move to strike
21	as nonresponsive.
22	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
23	Q. I'm not trying to argue with you.
24	All I'm trying to establish is: Isn't it true
25	the first time you've produced this underlying
1	data from these polls was on the two disks we
2	received from Mr. Schultz's office about a week
3	and a half ago?
4	A. Yeah. That's probably the case.
5	Yeah.
6	Q. That's all I want to establish.
7	Thank you.
8	On your -- on those disks -- how did
9	those disks get created?
10	A. I don't know how the disks were
11	created. What I supplied was a USB memory stick
12	to Mr. Schultz.
13	MR. SCHULTZ:
14	Which we copied in its
15	entirety, so that the record's
16	clear, onto the DVDs.
17	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
18	Q. When did you produce the memory
19	stick to Mr. Schultz?
20	A. Oh, around the 10th of November,
21	more or less -- before that, because I think he
22	said there was a 10 November deadline for getting
23	the reliance materials to you. So, I got it
24	before then.
74
1	when you would be obligated to produce whatever
2	was going to be your list of reliance materials?
3	A. That's right.
4	Q. And did you have any discussions
5	with Mr. Schultz about the kinds of materials you
6	should include among your reliance materials?
7	A. No.
8	MR. SCHULTZ:
9	That's going to be subject
10	to my claim of attorney work
11	product that we've discussed, this
12	will be the third time, so, I'm
13	going to instruct him not to
14	answer that question.
15	THE WITNESS:
16	Should I give him an answer
17	because -- the answer is no.
18	MR. SCHULTZ:
19	I'm not promising he'll
20	follow my instructions. I'm
21	merely giving them.
22	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
23	Q. What was your understanding as to
24	what you were supposed to include on that memory
25	stick?
75
1	MR. SCHULTZ:
2	Again, I'm going to invoke
3	the attorney work product. You
4	know, we can talk about this off
5	the record. There may be a way --
6	we can do it on a break maybe, we
7	can do it now, some way to satisfy
8	your concerns and memorialize it
9	on the record. Given the posture
10	of the parties on this issue, I
11	can't let him answer these
12	questions on the record as asked.
13	MR. GERAGHTY:
14	I understand. I want to
15	move along. I want to finish what
16	we can finish. If we can't
17	resolve that, we can't resolve
18	that.
19	Let's take a two-minute
20	break.
21	(Whereupon, a discussion was
22	held off the record.)
23	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
24	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, let me ask you a
25	couple of questions following up on what we were
76
1	just talking about. I want to make sure one
2	thing is clear. Have you produced to us in
3	the -- with the memory stick you gave to Mr.
4	Schultz and the two disks he produced to us all
5	of the raw data from any poll or surveys that
6	you've downloaded at any point in time?
7	A. I believe so, yes.
8	Q. Okay.
9	MR. GERAGHTY:
10	I just want to make it clear
11	on the record that our
12	understanding is that all that
13	underlying data that the doctor
14	has pulled at any point in time
15	has now been produced to us and I
16	don't want to be surprised if we
17	were to find other data that was
18	not part of that CD. So,
19	that's -- I'm going to make that
20	request to counsel, that if, for
21	some reason, you find anything,
22	I'm taking the doctor at his word,
23	and if there's some reason that
24	something is absent, we would like
25	to have that produced to us.
77
1	MR. SCHULTZ:
2	The question involved the
3	documents and the memory stick.
4	So, to be clear, whatever was on
5	the stick went on the disks.
6	THE WITNESS:
7	Yes.
8	MR. GERAGHTY:
9	I take that at face value.
10	I want to make sure if you've
11	downloaded any other data, it's
12	been produced to counsel, who has
13	produced it to us. Is that your
14	understanding?
15	THE WITNESS:
16	That's my understanding.
17	And did you bring those disks with
18	you?
19	MR. GERAGHTY:
20	No.
21	THE WITNESS:
22	Okay. Because I could check
23	them.
24	MR. GERAGHTY:
25	Did you bring them, Paul?
78
1	MR. KOETHE:
2	No. I may have them on my
3	hard drive, potentially the same
4	thing, but maybe during lunch, we
5	could --
6	THE WITNESS:
7	We could do that. I'm not
8	trying to -- you know, I want you
9	to have everything I've got.
10	MR. KOETHE:
11	I can't open all of them,
12	quite honestly, maybe because of
13	the format some of them are in.
14	If you want to identify those, I
15	could reproduce them in a format
16	that you could open up.
17	MR. SCHULTZ:
18	We could do this off the
19	record.
20	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
21	Q. You mentioned an R. J. Reynolds
22	document that you found, and you described that
23	for me. Have you arrived at any opinions as a
24	result of having reviewed that document?
25	A. Well, the opinion would be the
79
1	document is a kind of cumulative support for my
2	prior opinion, which is that most people, and
3	particularly smokers, perceive smoking as a habit
4	rather than an addiction.
5	Q. So, you found that document to be
6	corroborative of that opinion?
7	A. Yeah, that's a good -- good -- good
8	way to express it, yes.
9	Q. That's not a new opinion that you
10	have. You've expressed that opinion in the past.
11	A. That's correct.
12	Q. Do you know how many smokers were
13	interviewed?
14	A. There seems to be about, roughly,
15	about 100 responses on this particular document.
16	Q. Okay. Well, just for the record, I
17	would -- I'm not sure --1 don't recall seeing
18	that particular document on this disk. Perhaps
19	it is, but after the deposition, we would request
20	that you and/or Counsel sort of assist us in
21	locating that particular document that's on
22	there.
23	A. And I'd be happy to do that.
24	Q. Okay. Thank you.
25	Let me ask you -- let's move on. Do
80
1	you know what you're going to teach in the fall
2	of 2009?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. What are you going to teach then?
5	A. I teach a survey on the economic
6	history of the United States.
7	Q. Survey on the economic history of
8	the United States?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And is that an undergraduate-level
11	course?
12	A. Undergraduate-level course.
13	Q. Do you know the schedule for that
14	course yet?
15	A. I can't remember.
16	Q. But is it sort of a Monday -
17	Wednesday-Friday, or a Tuesday-Thursday type of
18	schedule?
19	A. You know, I think --1 think it is a
20	Monday-Wednesday -- actually, I'm pretty sure
21	it's Monday-Wednesday-Friday at 9:00. I've been
22	hogging the Tuesday-Thursday schedules for a
23	while, and my chair wants me to do the less-
24	desirable three-day-week schedule.
25	Q. Has Mr. Schultz asked you to be
81
1	available to appear live at the trials of any of
2	his cases?
3	A. I've made no scheduling arrangements
4	on any of that.
5	Q. That's --
6	A. No. The answer is no.
7	Q. So, he hasn't raised the subject
8	with you, of you appearing live to testify in any
9	of his cases?
10	A. No.
11	Q. We talked about this a little bit
12	before the break, but, you know, you've told me
13	what your spring course load is, you've told us
14	now what your fall course load is. Assuming that
15	you can arrange -- arrange it around your
16	schedule, are you willing to appear to testify
17	live in any cases that Mr. Schultz has?
18	A. Sure. Yes. I mean yes.
19	Q. Is the same true for any of the
20	cases filed by Mr. Watson's law firm?
21	A. Yes. I've never -- that's how I've
22	always done it. I've always shown up. Happy to
23	do that. Happy to do that.
24	Q. And the same is true if -- for, say,
25	Mr. McFarland's cases if he asked you to testify
82
1	live, you would work it out around your schedule
2	so that you could appear live?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. You haven't told any plaintiffs'
5	lawyer who's filed any Engle cases that you would
6	be unwilling to testify live in their cases, have
7	you?
8	A. No, I haven't made that --
9	Q. And just so I'm clear, have you
10	discussed that issue at all with anybody other
11	than Mr. Paige at the time being?
12	A. No. He's the only person I've made
13	scheduling --
14	Q. So, no -- neither Mr. Schultz, nor
15	Mr. Watson, nor any other plaintiffs' counsel who
16	has filed an Engle progeny case has asked you
17	about your ability to appear live in any of their
18	cases?
19	A. That's right.
20	Q. Let's go back to the -- just Mr.
21	Schultz made a representation that he would allow
22	you to answer several questions. Tell me, how
23	did you go about preparing the materials that you
24	put on this flash drive and gave to Mr. Schultz?
25	MR. SCHULTZ:
83
1	Let me say just, very
2	briefly, what I agreed to do was,
3	without waiving any other claim of
4	work product that I've made, the
5	one we've discussed on the record
6	several times now, that I would
7	permit questioning on the limited
8	issue of the collection of
9	reliance materials, communications
10	between counsel with any witness
11	on that issue and so forth.
12	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
13	Q. Okay. Within the confines of what
14	Mr. Schultz said, can you try to answer my
15	question?
16	A. I can.
17	Q. Okay.
18	A. And your question again is: How did
19	I go about preparing the reliance documents?
20	Q. Yeah. Right.
21	A. I dropped and dragged them, the
22	folders, from my hard drive to a memory stick,
23	and then mailed that to Mr. Schultz's office.
24	Q. So, every single one of the files
25	that were produced to Mr. Schultz in the memory
84
1	drive -- memory stick was something that already
2	existed on the hard drive of your personal
3	computer?
4	A. That's right.
5	Q. Okay. And were there materials that
6	related to smoking and health, the public's
7	perception of smoking and health, or the tobacco
8	industry or tobacco in general that are on your
9	hard drive that you did not drag and dump into
10	that memory stick?
11	A. I don't think so. If so, it was
12	inadvertent. I mean, my intention was to put
13	everything on that stick.
14	Q. So, your intention when you created
15	this memory stick was to put everything that you
16	had on your hard drive that related to tobacco,
17	basically?
18	A. Correct.
19	Q. And you think you've done that?
20	A. I think I've done that.
21	Q. When did you -- when did Mr. Schultz
22	make the request that you compile the materials
23	that would be among your reliance materials?
24	A. This fall, he sent me one e-mail.
25	Originally, this deposition was -- just kind of
85
1	informally for October. At least, that was my
2	understanding. And at that time, I was supposed
3	to get him materials by early October. Then, the
4	deposition was pushed back in time to the current
5	date, today, and he told me there was a deadline
6	of the 10th of November and that I -- please get
7	me the documents in time -- before that date so
8	that he could forward them to the defense
9	attorneys.
10	Q. How much time -- when did you start
11	creating the memory stick or creating the file
12	that would be the memory stick?
13	A. Well, as it was --1 think I got it
14	out in the Friday FedEx for Saturday delivery.
15	So, I did it that day.
16	Q. You did it all in one day?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Okay. How much time did it take
19	you?
20	A. Well, not very long. I have a
21	fairly fast computer and, so, the process of
22	saving or copying the files to the memory stick
23	is fairly quick. I think it took me about an
24	hour. If you want to include the time it took me
25	to take it to the FedEx drop-off, you know, two
86
1	and a half or three hours total, maximum.
2	Q. You mentioned that you had a
3	conversation with Howard Acosta about the
4	deposition either -- either today's deposition or
5	the deposition on December 9th and 10th. You
6	told me at the very outset of the deposition.
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. Tell me about that conversation.
9	A. It was a three-way telephone call
10	between Mr. Matt Schultz, myself and Mr. Acosta,
11	and it would have been back in October, and it --
12	that's when I had it.
13	Q. How long did the conversation take
14	place?
15	A. I think it was no more than a half
16	hour. It was a short conversation.
17	Q. Approximately one half hour?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. Who was going to ask you questions
20	on behalf of the plaintiffs' counsel on December
21	9th?
22	MR. SCHULTZ:
23	Object to the form.
24	A. I don't know.
25	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
87
1	Q. You haven't had any discussions with
2	anybody about that?
3	A. No.
4	Q. Did you discuss that on December --
5	well, this conversation with Howard and Mr.
6	Schultz that you told me about was in October.
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. Did you have a -- did that issue
9	come up at all during the conversation, who would
10	be asking you questions?
11	A. No, it did not.
12	Q. What did you and Mr. Acosta and Mr.
13	Schultz discuss?
14	MR. SCHULTZ:
15	I'm going to instruct him
16	not to answer on the basis of the
17	earlier invocation of the work-
18	product doctrine, except to the
19	extent you want to ask him about
20	the limited area I've already said
21	he could talk about.
22	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
23	Q. Did the subject of preparing your
24	reliance list come up then?
25	A. Yes. They said that I had to get my
88
1	documents in.
2	Q. Okay. Without --1 appreciate Mr.
3	Schultz's going to object to me asking you about
4	what you specifically discussed, but my question
5	is: Did you discuss the substance of what your
6	testimony would be on December 9th during that
7	call?
8	A. No, we did not.
9	Q. So, it didn't relate to the
10	substance.
11	MR. GERAGHTY:
12	Matt, I guess I'm looking to
13	you for guidance. If you didn't
14	discuss the substance of it --
15	hold on. Hang on. I mean, I'm not
16	sure what --1 want to make sure I
17	understand what the conversation
18	entailed within whatever Mr.
19	Schultz's objection is.
20	THE WITNESS:
21	Yeah, I think I can answer
22	that question within those rules.
23	MR. SCHULTZ:
24	Okay.
25	A. Would you like me?
1	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
2	Q. Yes, please.
3	A. Primarily, we discussed the
4	scheduling, which has been a very complex issue,
5	because my schedule has become a lot less
6	flexible and I've had -- you know, I've had to
7	coordinate with Mr. Gary Paige. So, we talked
8	about scheduling of the -- of these two
9	depositions and then just in a general way, you
10	know, me getting my reliance documents to the
11	plaintiffs' counsel so that they could be
12	forwarded to the defense counsel.
13	Q. And when you had this conversation
14	with Mr. Acosta and Mr. Schultz, was there a
15	discussion about the fact that this was being
16	coordinated in conjunction with your appearance
17	at the Hess and the Sherman trials in Broward
18	County?
19	MR. SCHULTZ:
20	Object to the form.
21	A. At that time, no, because while the
22	schedule for those trials may have been set, I
23	was unaware of the scheduling for those trials.
24	And, in fact, my understanding was -- is that
25	this Hess, Sherman trial was actually scheduled
1	for November and was pushed into December at some
2	later point.
3	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
4	Q. Did you and Mr. Schultz and Mr.
5	Acosta discuss anything else besides what we've
6	already talked about?
7	A. No.
8	Q. Did you have an understanding that
9	the deposition on December 9th is a, quote-
10	unquote, generic deposition?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. What is your understanding of what
13	that means?
14	A. My understanding of what the
15	December 9th deposition is, that it is a
16	videotaped, formalized -- well, essentially, a
17	kind of trial testimony that could be -- could be
18	shown to a jury at trial in a variety of -- you
19	know, in a number of cases.
20	Q. And you have no present knowledge of
21	the specific cases or the number of cases, right?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. Do you agree that the opinions that
24	you will offer at that deposition will be generic
25	opinions?
1	A. When you say "generic," you mean not
2	plaintiff-specific?
3	Q. I'm not sure that we've really
4	defined the term. So, tell me what you -- use
5	your own definition of generic in answering the
6	question.
7	A. As has been the case in all of my
8	testimony, I'm not a historian of the plaintiff.
9	So, my testimony will be, as it has been in the
10	past, relating to the public's knowledge and
11	understanding of the risks of smoking over broad
12	historical time -- the American public.
13	Q. Okay. And for purposes of offering
14	those opinions, as far as you're concerned, it
15	doesn't matter who the plaintiff is in the case;
16	is that right?
17	A. That's true, and that has been my
18	practice in the past.
19	Q. Okay. You are not the historian of
20	the plaintiff --
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. --or any plaintiff.
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. And, so, therefore, the opinions you
25	intend to offer won't change depending upon who
92
1	the particular plaintiff in the case is; is that
2	correct?
3	MR. SCHULTZ:
4	You still talking about
5	December 9th and 10th testimony?
6	MR. GERAGHTY:
7	Yes, sir.
8	A. Yeah, that's correct.
9	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
10	Q. Okay. I just want to play this out
11	for a moment. As you understand it, the
12	deposition could be played in ten, 20, 30, 40
13	individual plaintiffs' cases, correct?
14	A. That's my understanding, yes,
15	correct.
16	Q. And your opinion -- for purposes of
17	your opinion, it doesn't matter who that
18	particular plaintiff is, correct?
19	A. That's correct.
20	Q. It's insignificant to you for
21	purposes of your opinions?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. And, so, the facts of those -- you
24	don't need to know the facts of those cases or
25	the specifics of any particular plaintiff in
93
1	order to offer those opinions, right?
2	A. That's correct.
3	Q. And your opinions will not change
4	depending upon the individual facts and
5	circumstances of any particular plaintiffs case,
6	right?
7	A. That's correct.
8	MR. SCHULTZ:
9	We're still on December 9th
10	and 10th testimony?
11	MR. GERAGHTY:
12	Yes, sir.
13	MR. SCHULTZ:
14	Okay.
15	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
16	Q. Are you still charging 375 an hour?
17	A. No. For this, I've raised it a
18	little bit.
19	Q. When you say "this," you mean today?
20	A. Today, yes. It went up 25 bucks.
21	(Whereupon, a discussion was
22	held off the record.)
23	MR. GERAGHTY:
24	Let me go back on the
25	record.
94
1	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
2	Q. You've increased your hourly rate to
3	$400 per hour?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. And, so, for purposes of today's
6	deposition, you will charge me and the other
7	defendants $400 per hour?
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. Are you still charging $3,000 per
10	day?
11	A. Well, eight times--so.
12	Q. Thirty-two hundred dollars?
13	A. Thirty-two, yes.
14	Q. And at what point today will we go
15	long enough that you will say it's a flat $3,200
16	rate, or are you not going to do that to us?
17	A. You brought me, you know, all the
18	way to New Orleans--
19	Q. Don't be defensive. Just answer the
20	question. I just want to know what the answer
21	is.
22	A. We've reached that point.
23	Q. Okay. It's $3,200 for today's
24	deposition?
25	A. Yes.
95
1	Q. And that's whether we end at noon or
2	2:00 or 4:00, correct?
3	A. You've asked me for the whole day.
4	I've cleared my whole day schedule for you.
5	Q. And is that now going to be your new
6	daily rate for appearances at trial?
7	A. Yes, that's right.
8	Q. So, have you advised Mr. Acosta and
9	Mr. Schultz that you're going to charge $3,200
10	for December 9th and $3,200 for December 10th?
11	A. That's right. That's what I'll do.
12	Q. Is there -- give me your thinking in
13	changing it from 375 to $400 an hour.
14	A. Well, it's been that rate since
15	2004, and prices have gone up, gas has gone up --
16	although it has fallen lately -- but, you know,
17	things are more expensive. It's a modest
18	increase.
19	Q. So, it's basically the economy?
20	A. Yes. That would be -- that's the
21	answer.
22	Q. Did you discuss the change in rate
23	with anybody in particular?
24	A. No. I just thought an extra $25 an
25	hour would be an appropriate rise. That would be
96
1	in keeping with the increasing prices.
2	Q. Who has retained you specifically
3	for purposes of the deposition on December 9th
4	and 10th?
5	A. Mr. Schultz.
6	Q. Has Mr. Acosta retained you?
7	MR. SCHULTZ:
8	Object to the form.
9	A. My conversations have been with Mr.
10	Schultz, and all my scheduling and discussions
11	have been with him, save for, really, one phone
12	conversation with Mr. Acosta. I don't know what
13	their arrangements are in terms of working
14	together, but while I've not submitted any bills,
15	I anticipate billing Mr. Schultz's law firm.
16	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
17	Q. Have you been paid a retainer thus
18	far?
19	A. Yes, I was paid a retainer by Mr.
20	Schultz's law firm.
21	Q. How much were you paid?
22	A. Five thousand dollars.
23	Q. And when did you receive that?
24	A. When did I get that? It's been
25	sometime after I moved to Mississippi, but I
97
1	can't remember exactly when.
2	Q. Which was when?
3	A. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. That would be
4	sometime after the 1st of August.
5	Q. And what specifically was the
6	retainer for, in your mind?
7	A. To -- consultation, to make myself
8	available for his -- his need to have me -- to
9	give depositions and testify.
10	Q. And how much time would you say
11	you've spent on this matter thus far?
12	A. I would say approximately -- and
13	this is including putting the documents together
14	and reviewing things -- approximately a dozen
15	hours. Twelve.
16	Q. And break those 12 hours down for me
17	in terms of conferences or communications with
18	Mr. Schultz, research, you know. Just break the
19	12 hours down for me, please.
20	A. You know, about three -- three hours
21	actually, you know, putting together the reliance
22	documents.
23	Q. I thought you said that was an hour?
24	A. Or an hour. I mean, I had to read
25	them, too. I kind of skimmed through, you know,
98
1	putting all that together, driving to the FedEx
2	place. You know, talked to them on the phone.
3	I've done no specific research, you know, for
4	these cases that's different than my normal
5	research.
6	Q. How many times have you and Mr.
7	Schultz spoken over the phone about today's
8	deposition or the December 9 and 10 deposition?
9	A. We had one half-hour, three-way
10	phone conversation that I've described. We've
11	had telephone conversations about scheduling the
12	deposition. We had one early telephone
13	conversation where I explained to Mr. Schultz the
14	general content of my testimony and my opinions,
15	kind of an informative phone call.
16	Q. Was this the phone call that you and
17	he had?
18	A. Yeah, would be the first, yes.
19	Q. And you kind of orally described for
20	Mr. Schultz kind of the areas that you believe
21	you're prepared to address --
22	A. Correct.
23	Q — in your testimony?
24	A. Correct.
25	Q. How long was that conversation?
99
1	A. That was probably about an hour.
2	Q. So, if my understanding is correct,
3	not holding you to the specific number, but
4	you've had approximately a half dozen
5	conversations with Mr. Schultz of varying lengths
6	of time beginning in the spring of 2008 up till
7	now; is that right?
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. Six, give or take one? One more,
10	one less?
11	A. That's right.
12	Q. And you met Mr. Schultz for the
13	first time last night?
14	A. That's right.
15	Q. You guys had dinner here in town?
16	A. We did.
17	Q. Did you take him to a better place
18	than you took Mr. Paige?
19	A. I did.
20	Q. Where?
21	A. We went to Commander's Palace.
22	Q. Does Gary know that?
23	THE WITNESS:
24	Off the record.
25	(Whereupon, a discussion was
100
1	held off the record.)
2	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
3	Q. So, has the $5,000 retainer
4	basically been absorbed by the 12 hours you've
5	told me you have worked so far on the case?
6	A. It's a retainer. So, I think it's
7	actually to retain me. That's what that's for.
8	Q. So -- but the time you get paid for
9	today's deposition and the time you'll be paid on
10	the 9th and the 10th of December is in addition
11	to the 5,000 you've already been paid?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. You've testified in litigation for a
14	number of years, right?
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. And in your experience, you've been
17	paid for the time you spend being involved in
18	litigation, correct?
19	A. That's correct.
20	Q. And your understanding is the
21	experts hired by the defendants also get paid for
22	the time they spend preparing to testify and
23	testifying, right?
24	A. Yes. Yes, correct.
25	Q. And, now, given your experience over
101
1	the last seven or eight years, you understand
2	that that's fairly standard practice in
3	litigation of this nature, right?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. You have a full-time job as a
6	professor at the University of Southern
7	Mississippi, right?
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. And that keeps you occupied at least
10	40 hours or more per week, right?
11	A. That's right.
12	Q. So, when you take time away from
13	that schedule to participate in expert witness
14	matters, whether it's a deposition or trial
15	testimony, you expect that you should be
16	compensated for the time you take a way from your
17	normal day-to-day activities, right?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. And as far as you're concerned, is
20	there anything wrong with that?
21	A. No.
22	Q. If anybody were to suggest that
23	there was anything wrong with you or a defense
24	expert, a defense historian, charging for the
25	time they spent at trial, would you agree that
102
1	that would be a fair criticism?
2	MR. SCHULTZ:
3	Object to the form.
4	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
5	Q. Understand what I'm saying?
6	A. Yeah, I understand what you're
7	saying. No. People are entitled to be
8	compensated for their time.
9	Q. You alluded to this in response to
10	one of the questions a moment ago, but I just
11	want to make sure we're clear. Have you done any
12	research specifically for purposes of this
13	deposition on the 9th and the 10th?
14	A. Nothing that is specifically only
15	for this deposition.
16	Q. Have you done any other tobacco-
17	related research other -- since September other
18	than what you told me earlier about the searches
19	on the Legacy website for polling information?
20	A. You will find on the disclosure
21	documents that you have that there is a -- some
22	more newspaper research -- not a lot more, but
23	some more newspaper research. Under the
24	subdirectory Newspapers, there are some new
25	sources that are available.
103
1	MR. GERAGHTY:
2	Off the record.
3	(Whereupon, a discussion was
4	held off the record.)
5	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
6	Q. You mentioned that there was a
7	subfile among the reliance materials for
8	Newspaper.
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And I'm looking at what I understand
11	to be what's in that file, and there are articles
12	from The Atlanta Constitution; is that correct?
13	A. Yes, Atlanta Constitution. You
14	should see some Chicago Daily Times. Occasional
15	Hartford Courant, maybe a few LA Times.
16	Q. Yeah. Okay. I've got articles from
17	the Chicago Daily Tribune, The Washington Post,
18	Boston Daily Globe, Atlanta Constitution, New
19	York Times, Los Angeles Times, Christian Science,
20	Hartford Courant, Barron's National Business &
21	Financial Weekly. Does that sound accurate to
22	you?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. Just so we're clear, there are no
25	Florida newspapers on your reliance materials,
104
1	right?
2	A. I don't believe so, no.
3	MR. SCHULTZ:
4	Can we identify for the
5	record what you're reading from,
6	please?
7	MR. GERAGHTY:
8	I'm happy to tell you what
9	it is, but it's work product.
10	MR. SCHULTZ:
11	Sure.
12	MR. GERAGHTY:
13	I'm happy to just simply say
14	that we made our best effort to go
15	through the reliance materials and
16	attempt to index them, and I'm
17	reading from my index.
18	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
19	Q. Other than what you've identified
20	for me, you have done no specific research for
21	the deposition on the 9th or the 10th?
22	A. Right. That's correct.
23	Q. Before we get too far down the road,
24	I noticed that you have a folder with some
25	materials in it.
105
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. Okay. You brought that here today
3	for purposes of today's deposition?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. Why don't you just tell me what
6	you've got there and then maybe we'll --
7	A. You asked for my current CV and a
8	list of cases that I've testified in, and I've
9	supplied that.
10	Q. Can I take a quick look at that?
11	A. Yes, you can have it. I brought
12	this for you. Here.
13	Q. So, for the record, I've got your
14	folder here, and it looks like in your
15	handwriting, you wrote "Depo 11/21/08" on the
16	file folder?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. In here, is this a current version
19	of your CV?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. Which is 11 pages long, correct?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. And then also in the folder is a
24	copy of the Notice of Deposition -- this is a
25	notice for Escambia County, Florida, In Re:
106
1	Engle progeny Cases, Tobacco Litigation, Pertains
2	to All Cases; is that correct?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And this was provided to you by --
5	for the record, those are the only two items in
6	the folder, right?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. And Mr. Schultz provided you with a
9	copy of this particular notice?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. And when did you receive the notice?
12	A. Back in October. Soon after the
13	date of the notice, it was forwarded to me.
14	Q. This, for the record, was dated
15	October 20th.
16	A. That sounds right.
17	Q. And did you review the Exhibit A
18	with the following 12 different categories of
19	items requested?
20	A. I did.
21	Q. I take it that -- well, strike that.
22	Was the preparation of the memory
23	stick that you told us about earlier your effort
24	to produce the documents that were requested in
25	Exhibit A?
1	A. Yes.
2	MR. GERAGHTY:
3	For the record, we've marked
4	as Deposition Exhibit 1 the Notice
5	of Deposition from the
6	Hillsborough County cases; as
7	Deposition Exhibit Number 2, the
8	Notice of Deposition for the
9	Escambia County cases; and
10	Deposition Exhibit Number 3, the
11	Notice of Deposition from the Mary
12	H. Gelep v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco
13	Company, et al notice, which is a
14	Pinellas County case.
15	(Whereupon, Deposition
16	Exhibit Number 1, Deposition
17	Exhibit Number 2 and Deposition
18	Exhibit Number 3 were marked for
19	identification.)
20	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
21	Q. Let me ask you one or two items
22	about, I guess it's Deposition Exhibit 2, the
23	Escambia County notice, which Mr. Schultz
24	provided to you. Take a look at Exhibit A, Item
25	Number 5. You know what, that's not what I'm
1	looking for.
2	Item Number 11.
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. Item Number 11 says:
5	"All correspondence or
6	communications, including e-mails
7	and faxes between you and/or your
8	assistants and Plaintiffs."
9	You've told me that you have
10	e-mailed Mr. Schultz, right?
11	A. That's correct.
12	Q. Okay. And you didn't bring those
13	today, did you?
14	A. No, I didn't.
15	Q. And was that at the instruction of
16	Mr. Schultz?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. Okay. But there are -- there is
19	e-mail communication between the two of you,
20	correct?
21	A. Correct.
22	Q. And I think you also said e-mail
23	communications between you and Mr. Acosta.
24	A. I don't have anything with e-mail
25	with Mr. Acosta. I have his office. He has a
1	woman named April that works for him. I've
2	e-mailed with her.
3	Q. Well, if we broadened it -- let me
4	broaden it. I don't want to limit this in any
5	way to e-mails that relate specifically to this
6	deposition on the 9th and the 10th. If we were
7	to broaden it to include e-mail or correspondence
8	between you and any plaintiffs counsel or their
9	staff regarding any Engle tobacco progeny case,
10	would you have e-mail communications with other
11	attorneys that would be responsive to such a
12	request? Like, for instance, Mr. Paige.
13	A. Yes, I've e-mailed with Mr. Paige,
14	and I did bring those at the deposition in
15	September.
16	Q. My question is: You've told me
17	you've had some e-mail communications with Mr.
18	Schultz, you've had e-mail communication with Mr.
19	Paige, right?
20	A. That's right.
21	Q. And e-mail communication with April
22	from Howard Acosta's law firm, right?
23	A. That's right.
24	Q. Are there any other plaintiffs law
25	firms or staff members at those law firms with
110
1	whom you've communicated in writing?
2	A. No.
3	Q. None?
4	A. None.
5	Q. None with Mr. Watson's firm?
6	A. No. I've just met him today for the
7	first time.
8	Q. Item Number 12 on the Exhibit Number
9	2 asks for time records. Have you maintained any
10	time records that show the amount of time you
11	spent?
12	A. No.
13	Q. So, the 12 hours, you've just sort
14	of pulled that together from your memory?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. Have you taken any notes in this
17	case?
18	A. No.
19	Q. Have you sent any invoices or
20	statements or any other records to Mr. Schultz or
21	Mr. Acosta or any other plaintiffs lawyer that
22	would reflect the time you spent or a request for
23	compensation for the time you spent in these
24	cases?
25	A. No. I've sent no records.
Ill
1	Q. So, the request for the $5,000
2	retainer was made orally to Mr. Schultz?
3	A. That's right.
4	Q. Are you going to -- is that a
5	request you will make in all future Engle progeny
6	cases that you're asked to look at?
7	A. I don't know. I haven't talked with
8	anybody else. So, I'll consider that as it comes
9	in.
10	Q. Well, I think you told us that you
11	asked Mr. Paige for a retainer.
12	A. I can save you some time.
13	Q. Go ahead.
14	A. Yeah. He paid me $1,500.
15	Q. Right. I'm wondering if there's an
16	explanation for the difference between the $1,500
17	retainer there and the $5,000 retainer here.
18	A. Well, my understanding was that Mr.
19	Paige was interested in one case, and Mr. Schultz
20	represented to me that there were a number of
21	cases. So, it seemed to me there was more. More
22	cases, more retainer.
23	Q. When he represented to you that this
24	was involving more cases or a number of cases,
25	was that in the very first conversation you had?
112
1	A. I don't know if it was in the very
2	first conversation. It would have been, you
3	know, in an early conversation.
4	Q. Just to sort of fill out the record
5	on this, I'm handing you back, Doctor, your
6	manila folder that you gave to me, and in the
7	bottom right-hand comer, there are some numbers.
8	Is that your handwriting writing down the Bates
9	numbers that I stated out loud at the beginning
10	of the deposition?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. Okay. Well, why don't we, for the
13	record, let's mark that as Deposition Exhibit 4,
14	the folder and then all the contents of the
15	folder, including the cover page and this last
16	page.
17	(Whereupon, Deposition
18	Exhibit Number 4 was marked for
19	identification.)
20	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
21	Q. Did you bring anything else with you
22	to the deposition today besides what we've marked
23	as Deposition Exhibit 4?
24	A. No.
25	Q. Do you have any new opinions
113
1	regarding the subject of tobacco, the public's
2	perception of the health risks of tobacco or
3	anything related thereto since your deposition
4	was taken a year ago in the Ferlanti and the two
5	Connecticut cases?
6	A. No, I have no new opinions.
7	Q. So, you don't have any present
8	intention of offering any new opinions on
9	December 9th and 10th different from or in
10	addition to what you've testified to in the past,
11	correct?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. Are you going to render any case-
14	specific opinions on December 9th or 10th?
15	A. No.
16	Q. Do you understand what I mean when I
17	say "case-specific opinions"?
18	A. Well, my -- my interpretation of
19	that question is what we discussed earlier
20	related to a particular plaintiff.
21	Q. Okay.
22	A. No. I anticipate giving the same
23	testimony I've given in my prior cases.
24	Q. You are not going to offer any
25	opinions about any particular plaintiff at your
114
1	deposition on December 9th and 10th, correct?
2	A. That's correct.
3	Q. Okay. Have you been asked by any --
4	let's set Mr. Paige and his four cases aside,
5	because you have been asked to look at those
6	cases, correct?
7	A. (Nods head affirmatively.)
8	Q. But -- say "yes" or "no."
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. You nodded. Normally, you know that
11	you're not supposed to do that, so, I wanted to
12	tell you.
13	A. Thank you.
14	Q. Setting aside Mr. Paige's four
15	cases, Hess, Sherman, Cohen and Stephens, have
16	you looked at any material having to do with any
17	other plaintiff who's filed a Engle tobacco case?
18	A. No.
19	Q. Has any lawyer, whether it's Mr.
20	Schultz, Mr. Watson or Mr. Acosta, asked you to
21	look at the specific facts of any particular
22	plaintiffs case?
23	A. No.
24	Q. Would you be interested in doing
25	that if they asked you to do it?
115
1	A. No.
2	Q. Have you been provided with any
3	materials -- again, setting aside Hess, Sherman,
4	Stephens and Cohen -- have you been provided with
5	any discovery materials that have been generated
6	from any particular plaintiffs case who has
7	filed a Engle tobacco case?
8	A. No.
9	Q. Has Mr. Schultz made it clear to you
10	that he has no desire to have you do that?
11	MR. SCHULTZ:
12	Object to the form.
13	A. I've told him my position.
14	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
15	Q. Which is what?
16	A. As we discussed earlier, that I'm an
17	historian of the industry and the general
18	public's knowledge and understanding of the risks
19	of smoking, that I'm not the historian of any
20	particular plaintiff. So, I've made that opinion
21	clear to him.
22	Q. So, okay. Let me just follow that
23	thought then. So, that means that you would not
24	be interested in, for example, reviewing the
25	deposition of a plaintiff in a particular case,
116
1	right?
2	A. I have reviewed these depositions in
3	the past, and as I've testified numerous times,
4	my only interest in reviewing the depositions is
5	to place the particular plaintiff in historical
6	time, you know, whether they were bom in the
7	'20s or the '70s. That is to place them in kind
8	of a historical, generational time. You know,
9	when -- to the extent that they fit the general
10	patterns that I've been discovering in my broader
11	research on this topic.
12	Q. Okay. But for purposes of --1
13	mean, I understand that that's, generally
14	speaking, your view, but I want to make sure
15	we're clear about the cases that Mr. Schultz has
16	filed, that Mr. Watson's firm has filed and
17	all -- I'm including globally the plaintiffs
18	counsel who have filed cases in Hillsborough and
19	Escambia County. You're not prepared to, nor
20	interested in, reading the deposition of any
21	particular plaintiff in any of those cases,
22	right?
23	A. Right, except to the extent to
24	discover these general characteristics. But I'm
25	not going to make these specific plaintiff -
117
1	specific testimony.
2	Q. And the same would be true with
3	depositions of other family members of the
4	plaintiff, for example. You're not interested in
5	reviewing those depositions, right?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. Or just to broaden it, any other
8	material that might provide information about the
9	particular smoker and his or her -- you know, the
10	facts of his or her life, correct? You're not
11	prepared to, nor interested in, reviewing those
12	materials for the Hillsborough County and
13	Escambia County cases?
14	A. That's correct. I don't see -- my
15	role and my opinions are not related to the
16	biography of individual plaintiffs. My expertise
17	is in the tobacco industry, the public
18	statements, the activities and the broader
19	public's knowledge and understanding of the risks
20	of smoking.
21	Q. You made a comment a moment ago that
22	you said you have in the past reviewed
23	depositions of plaintiffs so that you could place
24	them in historical context, right?
25	A. Historical time.
118
1	Q. Historical time. You mentioned
2	wanting to make sure they were bom between the
3	1920s and the 1970s. That's the time period you
4	said.
5	A. I gave that as examples. I should
6	retract that. Just to know when they were bom,
7	where they appear generationally, you know, in
8	historical time.
9	Q. Tell me this. How far back in time
10	would a -- in your view, would a plaintiff --
11	could a plaintiff have been bom and your generic
12	opinions, you believe, would still apply to that
13	particular plaintiff?
14	A. How far back in time?
15	Q. Yes, sir.
16	A. Oh, let's--quite far back. You
17	know --
18	Q. 1880?
19	A. Certainly.
20	Q. So, if a plaintiff -- 1900? Say we
21	have a 108-year-old plaintiff, your opinions
22	would apply to that person?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. Let's say that they had passed away
25	20 years ago and it was a wrongful death case,
119
1	so, they died at the age of 88. Your view is
2	that your opinions would apply to an individual
3	smoker who was bom in the year 1900?
4	MR. SCHULTZ:
5	Asked and answered.
6	A. Yes.
7	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
8	Q. Take me in the other direction, and
9	how far recent in time would your opinions apply
10	to a particular smoker in terms of when they were
11	bom?
12	A. Well, they would apply throughout
13	the course of the 20th century. You know, you've
14	reviewed my testimony, I'm sure. One of the
15	things I've testified is that there is a point in
16	the late 1970s where increasing numbers of the
17	general public began to believe as true the
18	accusation or the -- that cigarettes cause
19	cancer. So, there's something of a -- one might
20	even say a tipping point after that point. It's
21	not complete, but there is increasingly, so, the
22	position gains credence after that on the issue
23	of smoking and cancer.
24	Q. Well, candidly, I don't think you've
25	answered my question. My question is: Give me a
120
1	year -- maybe the answer is it doesn't matter
2	when they were bom, your opinions apply. Is
3	there a cutoff time where you would say, you know
4	what, if this person was bom, hypothetically
5	speaking, after 1965 or 1970,1 would say that
6	that -- that nothing I would say or things that I
7	might say wouldn't apply to that particular
8	person?
9	A. Well, you know, I understand what
10	you're asking. My testimony does --1 mean, I'll
11	testify through, you know -- into the 1990s in
12	terms of certain aspects of knowledge and
13	industry statements.
14	Q. Let me try to --
15	A. I'm not sure --
16	Q. Let me try to be more specific. As
17	far as you're concerned, do your opinions apply
18	to a smoker who was bom in 1950?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. How about 1955?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. How about 1960?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. How about 1965?
25	A. Yes.
121
1	Q. How about 1970?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. How about 1975?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. 1980?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. 1990?
8	A. I've not done research -- at this
9	point, I wouldn't be prepared to discuss the kind
10	of testimony that I've given in the -- applied to
11	the period 1990s earlier to the most -- our most
12	recent time. We're kind of leaving the realm of
13	history and entering contemporary. Someone bom
14	in 1990, if we take the general pattern of when
15	most people pick up smoking, you know, we're
16	talking now. Any time in a window of now. That
17	certainly wouldn't be historical. So, I would --
18	I just wouldn't give an opinion on that at this
19	point.
20	Q. Okay. So, 1990 is your -- the
21	cutoff you're comfortable with as the date of
22	birth of a smoker to whom your opinions would
23	apply?
24	A. Correct, because I haven't looked
25	at -- you know, moving that forward to the
122
1	teenage years, which would be in the 2000s, the
2	first decade of the century. I just haven't done
3	work of a historical nature during that period on
4	this particular set of questions.
5	Q. Let's be clear then. Your opinions
6	may apply. You just haven't done the research to
7	where you can feel comfortable to say one way or
8	the other?
9	A. Yeah, since the period 2000, yeah.
10	Q. But for a plaintiff or a smoker who
11	was bom in 1985, you would be comfortable saying
12	that your opinions would apply to the facts of
13	that particular person's case?
14	A. Yes, some aspects of it, because I
15	have discussed the events of the 1990s in my
16	testimony.
17	Q. So, if there were a hypothetical
18	smoker who was bom in 1985, you would be
19	comfortable testifying in his or her case that
20	the public was unaware of the health risks, did
21	not believe -- let me rephrase the question.
22	If we had a hypothetical smoker who
23	was bom in --
24	THE WITNESS:
25	Off the record.
123
1	(Whereupon, a discussion was
2	held off the record.)
3	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
4	Q. Doctor, we were talking about --
5	well, let me rephrase the question that, I think,
6	was pending before the break, and that is:
7	Hypothetically speaking, if we had a smoker who
8	was born in 1985, your view is that your generic
9	opinions about the public's perceptions of the
10	health risks of cigarette-smoking would apply to
11	that particular smoker's case, right?
12	A. Correct.
13	Q. Okay. And 1990 is sort of the
14	cutoff date in your mind where you're
15	uncomfortable saying that your opinions might
16	apply to a hypothetical smoker who was born 1990
17	or more recently in time, correct?
18	A. Correct.
19	Q. Is it your opinion that the majority
20	of smokers did not believe that cigarette-smoking
21	was dangerous when the hypothetical smoker in
22	1985 began smoking, let's say, for sake of
23	discussion, 15 years later?
24	MR. SCHULTZ:
25	Object to the form.
124
1	MR. WATSON:
2	Join.
3	A. Smoking in 2000? I've never
4	testified on that period thus far, but I wouldn't
5	report --1 wouldn't represent it the way you've
6	represented it, no.
7	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
8	Q. Tell me how you would represent it.
9	A. For young people -- because we're
10	here now -- obviously, we're dealing with young
11	people -- picking up smoking in the 1990s, the
12	knowledge that smoking causes cancer is much
13	higher in the 1990s than it is prior to that. I
14	mean, you know, it's a process of increasing --1
15	mean, the trend was towards increasing knowledge
16	among the general public and the smoking public
17	in particular, and you get in the 1990s, like, on
18	the basis of polls, very high rates of public
19	knowledge on issues like cancer, lower on things
20	like addiction. I mean, it's a complex question.
21	There's lots of facets to it. You know, if
22	asked, I mean, at trial, I would say, you know --
23	to offer the opinion as you are asking me now, I
24	would say in the 1990s, you know, certainly, more
25	people even among young people understood that it
1	was cancer-causing over the long term. You get
2	into -- you get into variations here, though, you
3	know. It's a well-known phenomenon that younger
4	people underestimate certain cumulative risks.
5	So, that would be a factor. I've never testified
6	on this area and I don't anticipate testifying
7	for a cohort--a mid-1980s cohort. I can say
8	right now, I don't intend to offer an opinion on
9	that. I never have in the past.
10	Q. Let me ask you this. Let's say you
11	had a hypothetical smoker who began to smoke in
12	1990. Began to smoke in 1990. Was it common
13	knowledge when that person began to smoke in 1990
14	that cigarette-smoking was addictive?
15	MR. SCHULTZ:
16	Object to the form.
17	MR. WATSON:
18	Join.
19	A. Well, "common knowledge" is a term
20	that, as I've testified in the past, seems --
21	it's not a professional term the way it's used in
22	the litigation, and my preference is to define it
23	as essentially public understanding, what the
24	public knew and understood to be true.
25	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
1	Q. Well, I want to define it the way
2	you want to define it. Give me the language
3	you're comfortable talking about.
4	A. To me, "common knowledge," as I use
5	it, again, it's not my preferred term, but I'll
6	explain what my preferred term is, is just that,
7	common knowledge, common meaning what the
8	public -- what everybody knew and understood to
9	be true. Knowledge. That's different than being
10	aware of a controversy, which is something
11	altogether different. Certainly, by the 1990s,
12	you have high rates of public knowledge that
13	smoking is one of the causes of cancer. And you
14	asked me about addiction.
15	Q. Let me just rephrase the question so
16	I have a clean question and answer. Based on the
17	definition you've given me now of "common
18	knowledge," was it common knowledge in 1990 that
19	cigarette-smoking was addictive?
20	A. Addictive, no.
21	Q. Was it common knowledge that
22	cigarette-smoking was addictive in 1995?
23	A. No.
24	Q. Was it common knowledge that
25	cigarette-smoking was addictive in 2000?
Ill
1	A. I think even -- even today, young
2	people don't fully grasp the addictive quality --
3	qualities of cigarette-smoking. So, even today.
4	I think this is an area where smoking education,
5	smoking knowledge has trailed the other qualities
6	of the harmfulness of smoking.
7	Q. Okay. So, even as of today,
8	November 21st, 2008, it's not common knowledge in
9	the United States that cigarette-smoking is
10	addictive?
11	A. Particularly among young people,
12	yes.
13	Q. Okay. But when you're using the
14	term "common knowledge," we're talking about
15	people of all ages, not just young people, right?
16	A. Well, you could have common
17	knowledge among subgroups. You could have common
18	knowledge among smokers. Again, my preferred
19	term is "public understanding."
20	Q. You've defined it.
21	A. Yeah.
22	Q. Is it common knowledge among smokers
23	today that cigarette-smoking is addictive?
24	A. The most I can say, and this is on
128
1	I'm -- you know, we're leaving the realm of
2	historical analysis and entering into
3	contemporary public health research. The only
4	thing I can say is that today, young people
5	still -- and here I mean teenagers,
6	adolescents -- still don't fully appreciate the
7	addictive qualities of nicotine and cigarette -
8	smoking. That's as far as I can go.
9	Q. That's not a -- that's not an
10	opinion that you hold as an expert to a
11	reasonable degree of historical probability,
12	right?
13	A. That would be -- yeah, I have no
14	intention of making that statement at trial and
15	offering this opinion, nor have I ever offered an
16	opinion like this in terms of being such recent
17	contemporary situations. Because to get back to
18	what I said earlier, just so we're clear, we've
19	left the realm of history, historical analysis
20	and are really into contemporary affairs.
21	Q. You live in this contemporary
22	society. Let me ask you this: Is what you've
23	just told me about this knowledge lagging or
24	lacking among younger people, in your opinion, is
25	it a reflection upon a failure to communicate the
129
I	information to the public or simply what --
2	psychologically the makeup of young people in
3	general?
4	MR. SCHULTZ:
5	Object to the form.
6	MR. WATSON:
7	I also join.
8	A. Well, I'm not prepared to offer a
9	professional opinion on that question.
10	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
II	Q. Your sense is somebody who started
12	to smoke this year, if they were in their teen
13	years, would not believe that cigarette smoke is
14	addictive?
15	MR. SCHULTZ:
16	Object to the form.
17	MR. WATSON:
18	Join.
19	A. Well, the way I phrased it, and this
20	is based simply on my reading of the public
21	health literature on this and, again, it's an
22	area on which I'm not prepared to offer a
23	professional opinion as a historian, so, really,
24	I'm speaking as a citizen who keeps up on these
25	issues --
130
1	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
2	Q. All right. Well, tell me what your
3	personal view is.
4	MR. SCHULTZ:
5	Same objection.
6	A. My personal view is from what I've
7	read in the public health literature, which I,
8	you know, try to keep up on at least in terms of
9	smoking education, is that young people
10	underestimate the risk of the addictive qualities
11	of nicotine.
12	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
13	Q. But does that -- well, where have
14	you read this?
15	A. Ken Warner, who's a -- at the
16	University of Michigan, has published on some of
17	this stuff in kind of contemporary situations.
18	He's had a few articles I've come across that
19	I've -- that have made an impression on me.
20	Q. Ken Warner, W-A-R-N-E-R?
21	A. Yeah.
22	Q. He's at the University of Michigan?
23	A. School of Public Health.
24	Q. And you've read some articles he's
25	published on this subject?
131
1	A. Uh-huh.
2	Q. Anything else you can cite?
3	A. That would be the most. This is a
4	huge field and this enters into the realm of
5	community health and community health education.
6	So, I'm not comfortable talking about -- only my
7	own personal -- personal views and not anything
8	related to my scholarly training and expertise.
9	Q. Fair enough. So, you don't consider
10	yourself to be, quote, qualified to address this
11	particular subject; is that fair?
12	A. That is the current state of the art
13	in the fields of community health and health
14	education as it relates to tobacco control. No,
15	that's not my area of expertise.
16	Q. And, for example, whether youth or
17	teenagers underestimate or overestimate whether
18	cigarette-smoking is addictive or not.
19	MR. SCHULTZ:
20	Object to the form.
21	MR. WATSON:
22	Join.
23	A. Now, again, I'm making a distinction
24	between historical research --1 have researched
25	extensively the literature and the survey
132
1	responses in the '50s, '60s and '70s and, so, for
2	those periods, I can offer opinions. You're
3	asking me about the current state of research in
4	the fields of health education, and I'm not
5	prepared to give you a suitable answer to what
6	the state of the art in that research is.
7	MR. GERAGHTY:
8	Okay. Well, why don't we
9	take a lunch break.
10	(Whereupon, a discussion was
11	held off the record.)
12	MR. GERAGHTY:
13	Back on the record.
14	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
15	Q. During the break, Dr. Kyriakoudes,
16	we looked at one of the disks that Mr. Schultz
17	produced from your memory stick, correct?
18	A. That's correct.
19	Q. And we looked specifically at --
20	within the folders you have, there is a
21	particular subfolder that's entitled Roper.
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. And within that subfile titled
24	Roper, you have various polls, but the question I
25	really want to make sure we nail down is that to
133
1	the extent you have downloaded any underlying
2	data about the polls or the surveys themselves,
3	all of that is contained within that subfile
4	titled Roper?
5	A. That is correct.
6	Q. Let me ask you this one question now
7	about those disks that I didn't ask earlier, just
8	to kind of round out the questions. The material
9	that was produced to us in those two disks is
10	more voluminous than what you produced as your
11	reliance materials in the Hess, Sherman, Cohen
12	and Stephens case. Is there any reason for that?
13	Is there any explanation for that?
14	A. Not really, no.
15	Q. We may go through some of the
16	disclosures from Hillsborough and Escambia County
17	a little bit more, but do you -- are you aware
18	that you have been disclosed in a number of these
19	cases as a potential rebuttal expert?
20	A. That's true. I am aware of that.
21	Q. What is your understanding as to why
22	you've been disclosed as a rebuttal expert?
23	A. To rebut testimony. So, there might
24	be cases where I would be brought in as a
25	rebuttal witness in individual cases.
134
1	Q. Tell me what specifically you've
2	been told about the possibility that you might be
3	asked to serve as a rebuttal witness.
4	A. I was asked if I'd be willing to
5	serve as a rebuttal witness. I said yes.
6	Q. Who asked you to do that?
7	A. Mr. Schultz, Matt Schultz.
8	Q. What is your understanding of what
9	it means to be a rebuttal witness?
10	A. It means to review the testimony of,
11	I'm assuming, a defense historian expert, and
12	then offer my opinions on that testimony.
13	Q. At this point in time, have you
14	looked at any particular defense historian's
15	testimony?
16	MR. SCHULTZ:
17	Object to the form.
18	A. I have reviewed the testimony
19	contained in my data article, which you're
20	familiar with.
21	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
22	Q. Let me be more specific, though.
23	Have you reviewed any deposition testimony taken
24	thus far in any of the Engle tobacco cases?
25	A. No, I have not reviewed that
135
1	testimony.
2	Q. So, you haven't reviewed a
3	deposition of any defense expert taken in an
4	Engle progeny case thus far?
5	A. No, not at this point.
6	Q. Are there any particular witnesses
7	who you can identify by name that you may be
8	asked to provide, quote-unquote, rebuttal
9	testimony?
10	A. No, I don't know of any particular
11	individuals. I haven't been asked to rebut on
12	any particular case. So, I don't know who the
13	witnesses are.
14	Q. Has Mr. Paige in any of his four
15	cases in Broward shown you any of the deposition
16	testimony taken of any of the defense experts in
17	those cases?
18	A. He sent me in maybe late October or
19	early November some deposition testimony, but I
20	have not at this time reviewed it.
21	MR. SCHULTZ:
22	As a formality, Bill, let me
23	say those cases have nothing to do
24	with why we're here today, so, I'm
25	going to have a standing objection
136
1	on any questions.
2	MR. GERAGHTY:
3	That's fine.
4	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
5	Q. Whose testimony did Mr. Paige send
6	you in October?
7	A. I'm not sure, because I haven't
8	actually even opened the package.
9	Q. You haven't opened the package?
10	A. No.
11	Q. Well, do you know during what time
12	frame Mr. Paige wanted you to review the
13	depositions?
14	A. He sent it to me -- I'm not sure why
15	he sent it to me. I'm giving direct testimony in
16	his cases. It might be Michael Schaller. He
17	mentioned that name. I am not sure.
18	Q. You actually had a conversation with
19	Mr. Paige in which he told you he would be
20	sending you some testimony from defense experts
21	in those four cases?
22	A. Yes. I said my ability to review
23	those timewise was limited, but he sent it on to
24	me anyway.
25	Q. And you haven't actually opened the
137
1	package?
2	A. No, I haven't, actually. It sits
3	there.
4	Q. Specifically, Mr. Paige mentioned
5	Michael Schaller as one of the people whose
6	testimony he might send you?
7	A. Yeah, and it's probably in that
8	package.
9	Q. Did he mention Lacy Ford?
10	A. No, he didn't mention Lacy Ford.
11	Q. Did he mention an individual named
12	Kent Tedin?
13	A. No. How do you spell that?
14	Q. T-E-D-I-N.
15	A. No.
16	Q. Did he mention Kip Viscusi?
17	A. He did mention Kip Viscusi, yes.
18	Q. He told you he would send you Kip
19	Viscusi's deposition as well?
20	A. No.
21	Q. Was this conversation within the
22	last couple of weeks?
23	A. Oh, it's very recently. Yeah.
24	Q. Because you told me the package came
25	in October.
138
1	A. Yes, with -- yes, but he -- we had a
2	phone conversation about Kip Viscusi.
3	Q. When did you have a phone
4	conversation about Kip Viscusi?
5	A. Oh, it's within the last two or
6	three weeks.
7	Q. Tell me about the conversation.
8	A. He asked me if I was familiar with
9	Kip Viscusi, and I said --1 explained who he
10	was, he's an economist who's worked on this --
11	awareness issues.
12	Q. Dr. Viscusi is an expert in risk
13	perception?
14	A. Yeah, I think that's how he
15	describes his expertise.
16	Q. Do you agree that he is an expert in
17	risk perception?
18	A. Kip Viscusi. His work is very
19	interesting. I've read most of his material,
20	most of his published cigarette work. Very
21	prolific scholar. Yeah, he's published peer-
22	reviewed articles that deal with risk perception,
23	so, he's got an expertise. I disagree with many
24	of his tobacco-related opinions, but he is
25	certainly admissible as an expert.
139
1	Q. My question isn't about whether you
2	agree or disagree with his conclusions. My
3	question is: You agree he is an expert in risk
4	perception?
5	A. He holds himself out as an expert in
6	risk perceptions.
7	Q. My question is: Do you agree --
8	MR. SCHULTZ:
9	There's a limit here. If
10	you want to take his deposition in
11	one of Gary's cases, you need to
12	notice it in one of Gary's cases.
13	At some point here, just a few
14	questions away, I'm going to tell
15	him to stop answering questions
16	because, Number 1, that's not why
17	we're here. Number 2,1 don't
18	want to prejudice Gary in some way
19	that I'm totally unaware of
20	because I'm totally unfamiliar
21	with his cases altogether.
22	Subject to that and with
23	that understanding, you can answer
24	the question, Doctor.
25	A. I've answered it.
140
1	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
2	Q. No. My question is: Is Kip Viscusi
3	an expert in risk perception?
4	MR. SCHULTZ:
5	I object to the form of the
6	question on Gary's behalf. It's a
7	bad question, it's inappropriate
8	for the reasons I just said.
9	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
10	Q. Go on.
11	A. I'll say that Kip Viscusi is an
12	economist, and that's the most I'll say about his
13	qualifications. I don't feel qualified to go
14	beyond that.
15	Q. Because you're not really an expert
16	in risk perception yourself, right?
17	A. I'm not sure what risk perception
18	is. You know, I think this is one of these, you
19	know, created specialties. I'm a historian.
20	He's an economist. Our work overlaps in some
21	ways in terms of the questions we ask. He makes
22	historical arguments in his work that, I think,
23	are not well formed. That's where I'll go on
24	that.
25	MR. GERAGHTY:
141
1	I'm going to move to strike
2	that answer as nonresponsive.
3	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
4	Q. Doctor, my question was: You are
5	not an expert in the field of risk perception.
6	"Yes" or "no"?
7	A. In terms of -- no, I'm not an expert
8	in risk perception. I'm a historian that studies
9	public knowledge and public understanding.
10	Q. You're not an expert in the field of
11	risk perception, correct?
12	MR. SCHULTZ:
13	Asked and answered.
14	A. Correct. I'm an expert in public
15	knowledge and public understanding in historical
16	time.
17	MR. GERAGHTY:
18	You can't just say "yes" or
19	"no." You got to --
20	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
21	Q. So, you haven't looked at any
22	particular expert's deposition testimony in any
23	Engle progeny case at this point in time, right?
24	A. No, I haven't reviewed any, no.
25	Q. Did Mr. Schultz talk with you about
142
1	rebutting any particular individual's testimony
2	in any of his cases?
3	A. No. He just offered the general
4	idea.
5	Q. He didn't mention Dr. Tedin?
6	MR. SCHULTZ:
7	Object to the form.
8	A. No. I've never heard that name
9	before.
10	MR. SCHULTZ:
11	Neither have I.
12	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
13	Q. Did he mention a Dr. Gerking?
14	A. I'm sorry?
15	Q. G-E-R-K-I-N-G.
16	MR. SCHULTZ:
17	I object to the whole line.
18	He just said we haven't had any
19	discussion about rebutting any
20	particular witness. So, you can
21	ask a list of 400 witnesses; the
22	answer is going to be "no."
23	A. That name is unfamiliar to me.
24	MR. GERAGHTY:
25	The deposition is going to
1	go a lot quicker if we don't have
2	speaking objections.
3	MR. SCHULTZ:
4	The deposition would go a
5	lot more quickly if we didn't ask
6	unnecessary questions.
7	MR. GERAGHTY:
8	They're not unnecessary
9	questions. I'm entitled to
10	explore to what extent you want to
11	use him as a rebuttal expert, and
12	that's exactly what I'm doing
13	here. You've made it clear,
14	you've listed in writing that he
15	will be a rebuttal expert.
16	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
17	Q. Did Mr. Schultz mention a Dr. John
18	Geer, G-E-E-R?
19	MR. SCHULTZ:
20	Same objection.
21	A. No.
22	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
23	Q. Did he mention Dr. Terry Parssinen?
24	A. No.
25	Q. You know who Dr. Parssinen is,
2	A. I believe he testified as a defense
3	expert in a previous case in which I testified as
4	a plaintiffs expert.
5	Q. I'm going to switch gears here,
6	Doctor. You've testified, I think you've said
7	now, in 11 different cases. That sound about
8	right?
9	A. Sounds about right.
10	Q. And those cases that have involved,
11	you know, a variety of different companies,
12	correct?
13	A. That's correct.
14	Q. Okay. And the smokers who are the
15	plaintiffs in those cases smoked a variety of
16	different cigarette brands, did they not?
17	A. Correct.
18	Q. And you know that smokers smoke
19	different brands of cigarettes, correct?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. Some smokers smoke full-flavored
22	cigarettes, right?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. Others smoke medium-flavor or
25	low-tar or ultra-low-tar cigarettes, correct?
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. Some people smoke cigarettes that
3	have menthol in them, right?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Others prefer nonmentholated
6	cigarettes.
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. Some smokers smoke cigarettes that
9	have ammonia in them, right? You're familiar
10	with that.
11	A. Generally familiar with the
12	ammoniated nicotine issue, although, I don't know
13	the science.
14	Q. You know that there are some
15	cigarettes that have ammonia in them, correct?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. If you don't know, that's fine, too.
18	A. Yeah. I do know a little bit about
19	that, but that's not an area of my expertise.
20	Q. Some cigarettes have ammonia in
21	them, others do not, right?
22	A. I couldn't say.
23	Q. Okay. So -- all right. Fair
24	enough.
146
1	on your work in these cases, you know that there
2	are, over the last 50 years, lots of different
3	cigarette brands that have been on the market,
4	correct?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. Made by all of the major cigarette
7	companies, correct?
8	A. Correct.
9	Q. And some smokers will smoke one
10	brand and be loyal to that brand for most of
11	their years as a cigarette smoker, correct?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Other cigarette smokers might switch
14	from one brand to the next, right?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. You've seen this in your experience
17	in some of the cases in which you've testified in
18	the past?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. And you've read some deposition
21	testimony of plaintiffs, correct?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. And you know that people smoke
24	cigarettes for different reasons, right?
25	A. Well, for different reasons and more
147
1	than one reason.
2	Q. Well, people smoke cigarettes -- let
3	me rephrase the question. People choose
4	different brands of cigarettes for different
5	reasons, correct?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Some people choose the brand of
8	cigarettes based on taste, right?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. Some people choose the brand of
11	cigarettes based on the price of the cigarettes,
12	right?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. Some people choose it based on what
15	they understand to be the tar and nicotine yield
16	of the cigarettes, correct?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Other people may choose the brand
19	based on the image that they believe that brand
20	conveys, correct?
21	A. The advertising image, yes.
22	Q. Okay. Some people try low-tar or
23	ultra-low-tar cigarettes, right?
24	A. Try -- yes.
25	Q. And some people reject low-tar and
148
1	ultra- low-tar cigarettes because they find them
2	unsatisfactory; isn't that right?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. Some people find ultra-low-tar
5	cigarettes in particular too difficult to smoke.
6	Have you heard that?
7	A. I'm not sure if I --1 don't
8	understand that point.
9	Q. Too difficult to draw. You
10	understand what I'm talking about, or no?
11	A. Oh, I understand. I see what you're
12	saying. On that particular issue, I haven't seen
13	that either way. That's just not something that
14	I'm familiar with.
15	Q. Okay. And getting back to this
16	deposition for December 9th and the 10th and
17	recognizing that there are some number of
18	plaintiffs involved and you don't know the number
19	of plaintiffs or anything about those plaintiffs,
20	correct?
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. So, for any particular plaintiff in
23	whose case this deposition may be played, you
24	don't know the brands of cigarettes that any one
25	of those plaintiffs smoked, correct?
149
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. Okay. You know that smokers will
3	smoke different amounts of cigarettes, right?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Some people might be -- you've heard
6	of the term chipper, correct?
7	A. No, I'm not familiar with that term.
8	Q. You're not familiar with that term.
9	Okay. You've never heard the term chipper?
10	A. No.
11	Q. In all the years of your historical
12	research, you've never seen the term chipper?
13	A. Chipper, C-H-I-P-P-E-R?
14	Q. Right.
15	A. That's a new one on me.
16	Q. Some people are what are called
17	chain smokers, right?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. Meaning they light one cigarette
20	after another?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Some people might smoke a pack or
23	two packs a day, right?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. Other people might smoke five
150
1	cigarettes, half a pack a day, correct?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And as to any of the plaintiffs in
4	whose cases this video of your deposition may be
5	played, you don't know the amounts of cigarettes
6	those people would have smoked from day to day,
7	right?
8	A. No, I don't know that.
9	Q. Or for how many years they smoked?
10	A. I don't know that.
11	Q. Okay. Some people will smoke
12	cigarettes their entire lives, right?
13	MR. SCHULTZ:
14	Object to the form.
15	A. Or -- well, they do begin at a
16	certain point in time.
17	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
18	Q. Right. After beginning smoking at
19	some point in their lives, some people will smoke
20	for their entire life, correct?
21	A. Until they die.
22	Q. Some people will smoke ten, 15, 25
23	years, right?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. Other people may smoke a year, two
151
1	years, five years, and quit, right?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Some smokers inhale cigarettes,
4	correct? Inhale the smoke of the cigarette.
5	A. Into the lungs, yes.
6	Q. Some people don't inhale the smoke,
7	right?
8	A. Well, the product is designed to be
9	inhaled. There may be some people that don't
10	inhale, but the product is designed to be
11	inhaled.
12	Q. Let's put it this way. You would
13	agree that there's probably a spectrum regarding
14	the extent to which cigarette smokers inhale the
15	smoke from their cigarettes?
16	A. Variation is what you mean?
17	Q. There's variation in the extent to
18	which smokers will inhale the smoke from the
19	cigarettes they choose.
20	A. I would agree with that general
21	proposition.
22	Q. And, in fact, like over the course
23	of a day, the way a particular smoker might smoke
24	could change, right?
25	A. You mean in terms of the intensity
152
1	and the length? Yes. I mean, yes, that's true.
2	Q. Some people might smoke more in the
3	morning as opposed to later on in the day, right?
4	A. That's true.
5	Q. Some people may smoke more
6	frequently after meals, right?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. Some people, given their -- strike
9	that.
10	There are different things that
11	influence the amount of cigarettes a person might
12	smoke during the course of a day, correct?
13	A. Sure. I would imagine.
14	Q. You're aware that there are now
15	workplace restrictions, and there have been for a
16	number of years, that might limit or prohibit
17	where and when a particular person might be able
18	to smoke their cigarettes.
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. I appreciate you don't hold yourself
21	out as an expert in smoking behavior, do you?
22	A. No, not the way -- for the way
23	somebody like Jack Henningfield would. I'm not a
24	design expert.
25	Q. You understand there are people out
153
1	there who spend their time studying the way
2	people smoke cigarettes and their behavior and
3	all aspects of cigarette-smoking, right?
4	A. That's right.
5	Q. You have not made that your task in
6	life?
7	A. That is correct.
8	Q. But recognizing that and
9	appreciating that limitation, you understand that
10	cigarette-smoking from one individual to the next
11	is a complex behavior, right?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. There's a variety of different
14	factors, psychological, physical, behavioral,
15	that influence people's smoking behavior?
16	A. I'll add to that cultural, social.
17	Q. So, you would broaden the list of
18	things that might result in a variation between
19	one smoker's smoking behavior and another's,
20	correct?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. People may choose to start smoking
23	for different reasons, correct?
24	MR. SCHULTZ:
25	Object to the form.
154
1	MR. WATSON:
2	Join.
3	A. Well, I mean, there -- I'm not sure
4	about reasons here, and I'm not trying to be --
5	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
6	Q. You want me to be more specific?
7	A. Yeah.
8	Q. I'll be more specific. I mean, some
9	people choose to smoke because they want to fit
10	in with their peers, right?
11	MR. SCHULTZ:
12	Object to the form.
13	MR. WATSON:
14	Join.
15	A. Yes. With adolescents, that's been
16	well documented.
17	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
18	Q. Some people choose to smoke
19	initially now, you believe, because they -- they
20	are influenced by the advertising of a particular
21	brand, correct?
22	A. That certainly, yeah, is the case.
23	Yes.
24	Q. You hold that view, right?
25	A. Yes.
155
1	Q. Okay. So, my point simply is that
2	there are different reasons why a particular
3	individual might choose to become a cigarette -
4	smoker.
5	A. People begin smoking for different
6	reasons, yes, I would agree with that idea.
7	Q. And people continue to smoke
8	cigarettes for different reasons, too, right?
9	MR. SCHULTZ:
10	Asked and answered.
11	A. Well, this one, this gets to the
12	point I alluded to earlier where I said there's
13	one big reason and, again, I'm not an expert on
14	addiction, I'm not a pharmacologist, but you
15	don't have to have training in those fields to
16	understand that, you know, smoking, by and large,
17	for adult smokers is an addiction-maintenance
18	activity.
19	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
20	Q. Well, I understand that. So, you
21	believe -- let me back up for a second. You're
22	not an expert in nicotine addiction, right?
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. You understand that there are people
25	who spend their lives studying addictions and,
156
1	specifically, addictions to tobacco, right?
2	A. That's correct.
3	Q. And you have not spent your
4	professional life doing that?
5	A. That is not -- that's a correct
6	statement.
7	Q. Your lay person's understanding is
8	cigarette-smoking is addictive, correct?
9	A. Yes. That's my understanding.
10	Q. So, you believe that, certainly,
11	some group of people continue to smoke because
12	they enjoy or need the nicotine in cigarettes,
13	right?
14	MR. SCHULTZ:
15	Object to the form.
16	MR. WATSON:
17	Join.
18	A. The need, yes. They have the
19	physical addiction to nicotine.
20	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
21	Q. In addition to that, there are other
22	reasons why a particular cigarette smoker would
23	choose to continue smoking in addition to, in
24	your view, their need for nicotine, right?
25	MR. SCHULTZ:
157

2	MR. WATSON:

4	A. What might that reason be? Give me
5	some examples. Help me understand it.
6	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
7	Q. Well, for status reasons, cultural
8	reasons -- you mentioned them earlier -- social,
9	cultural, right?
10	A. Yeah. I apply those more towards
11	smoking initiation.
12	Q. Well, certainly, people continue to
13	smoke because of -- for societal reasons, for
14	cultural reasons.
15	MR. SCHULTZ:
16	Object to the form.
17	A. I agree with you. Now, again, here,
18	you know, I am a historian, so, you know, the
19	missing part of your question is, you know, in
20	historical time, and there are -- these factors
21	vary over time. So, yeah, but as a general
22	proposition, there's truth there.
23	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
24	Q. I'm not trying to tell you there's a
25	hundred different reasons why people would choose
158
1	to smoke besides nicotine, but there are other
2	reasons, correct?
3	MR. SCHULTZ:
4	Object to the form.
5	MR. WATSON:
6	Join.
7	A. Yes, but I want to make sure that we
8	have this as a historical component, that
9	depending upon what period of historical time
10	you're dealing with, these factors are going to
11	vary.
12	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
13	Q. Smokers may decide that they want to
14	quit smoking for a variety of different reasons,
15	right?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. Some will quit for health -- out of
18	health concerns, right?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Some people may quit because a loved
21	one or a family member has health concerns for
22	them, right?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. Okay. But there are some cigarette
25	smokers who aren't concerned about their health,
159
1	correct?
2	MR. SCHULTZ:
3	Object to the form.
4	MR. WATSON:
5	Join.
6	A. I'm not sure what you mean by that.
7	I think there are people that don't understand
8	their health and don't fully appreciate the
9	connections, and the key point here is, you know,
10	without getting into fields in which I don't hold
11	myself out as an expert, but, certainly,
12	addiction colors one perceptions.
13	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
14	Q. Well, let me try to rephrase the
15	question so we're -- so maybe we're communicating
16	better.
17	Some people just aren't concerned
18	about their health, right?
19	MR. SCHULTZ:
20	Object to the form. It's
21	the same question.
22	MR. WATSON:
23	Join.
24	A. It is theoretically possible to have
25	somebody who is, you know, completely unconcerned
160
1	with their health. I think most people are
2	concerned with their health. You know, it's an
3	awfully broad statement you're making. The issue
4	is do they understand the connections between
5	their behavior and their health. Often, people
6	don't understand that.
7	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
8	Q. Well, but, for any one individual,
9	you're not in any position to assess to what
10	extent they understand the risk of cigarette -
11	smoking to their own personal health, right?
12	MR. SCHULTZ:
13	Object to the form.
14	A. That's correct. I'm not going to
15	offer, nor have I in the past offered these one-
16	on-one psychological explanations.
17	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
18	Q. You also know that some people, they
19	may appreciate 100 percent what the risk is to
20	their health of cigarette-smoking, but they are
21	willing to live with a certain amount of risk,
22	right?
23	MR. SCHULTZ:
24	Object to the form.
25	MR. WATSON:
1	Object to the form.
2	A. No. I don't accept that, because I
3	think it's pretty clear that, you know, from the
4	research I've read on when people quit, often,
5	when confronted with a traumatic health event,
6	say, for example, a heart attack, people then
7	will quit and only then do they fully appreciate
8	the connection between their action and their
9	health.
10	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
11	Q. You've identified one reason why
12	somebody might choose to quit smoking, and that's
13	because they have been faced with a specific
14	illness and they make the decision that they want
15	to quit at that point in time, right?
16	MR. SCHULTZ:
17	Object to the form.
18	MR. WATSON:
19	Join.
20	A. Yes. Right.
21	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
22	Q. And my point is simply: There are
23	some people who smoke cigarettes, understand the
24	health risk to them and are willing to bear that
25	level of risk.
1	MR. SCHULTZ:
2	Object to the form.
3	MR. WATSON:
4	Join.
5	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
6	Q. If they haven't been faced with a
7	life-threatening illness.
8	MR. SCHULTZ:
9	Same objection.
10	A. I guess here we -- my disagreement
11	with your statement that --1 mentioned a life-
12	threatening illness. Say, for example, heart
13	attack, this is described in a book called The
14	Price of Smoking -- you know, the knowledge is
15	incomplete. The traumatic health event is, in
16	essence, the thing it takes for some people to
17	fully understand the connection between their
18	behavior and their health. So, what you describe
19	is kind of a theoretical possibility, but in
20	terms of social reality, I don't think it really
21	exists.
22	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
23	Q. Let's back up for a second. There
24	are many, many smokers who, after they start
25	smoking, smoke their entire lives and live to
1	their full life expectancy and are still
2	cigarette smokers when they die, right?
3	A. Yes, there are people that have
4	smoked all their lives and then stop smoking when
5	they die, that's true.
6	Q. And my point is simply some
7	percentage of those people fully understand the
8	health risks and choose to bear that risk for
9	whatever reason or another?
10	MR. SCHULTZ:
11	I object to the form.
12	A. Again, that's a possibility, but I
13	think that would actually be an infinitesimally
14	small -- never say 100 percent, because in the
15	realm of statistics, nothing is 100 percent,
16	there is always measurement error and the like.
17	No, I wouldn't agree with that.
18	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
19	Q. Okay.
20	A. I think that for most of the people
21	you're describing, what's actually going on is,
22	you know, they may mouth, oh, I think this is bad
23	for me, but they don't understand that it's a
24	personalized, individualized risk. You can know
164
1	cigarettes are harmful. But to know that you
2	yourself and your direct activity and the
3	cumulative risk of career of smoking is going to
4	harm you, that's another level of knowledge. For
5	example, you can, you know, read the explanation
6	in the 1989 Surgeon General's Report where they
7	go over this in fairly strong detail. So, what
8	you describe is theoretically possible, but as a
9	matter of social reality, I think, I won't say it
10	never happens because there's always exceptions,
11	but it is very, very unusual.
12	Q. So, you don't think there's anybody
13	out there on the planet who understands the
14	health risk and says, I'm going to continue to
15	smoke, understanding that health risk?
16	MR. SCHULTZ:
17	Object to the form. He just
18	answered that.
19	A. I just answered the question. I
20	mean, I really did. I'm not going to answer it
21	again.
22	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
23	Q. I don't think you did. That's okay.
24	We'll move on.
25	You know some smokers try to quit
165
1	smoking, right?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Some smokers do not try to quit
4	smoking.
5	A. That's true.
6	Q. And for some people, cigarette-
7	smoking is hard to quit, right?
8	A. Well, it's an addiction. Yes, very
9	hard to quit.
10	Q. And for other people, they can quit
11	cold turkey, right?
12	MR. SCHULTZ:
13	Object to the form.
14	MR. WATSON:
15	Join.
16	A. I've seen -- just in my research,
17	I've seen many different paths to quitting
18	smoking, cold turkey being one of them.
19	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
20	Q. Right. And, look, you know that
21	millions of Americans have quit smoking using
22	cold turkey by which they quit smoking, correct?
23	MR. SCHULTZ:
24	Object to the form.
25	MR. WATSON:
166
1	Join.
2	A. Yes. The research on this shows
3	that smokers often make multiple attempts to quit
4	smoking.
5	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
6	Q. My point, simply, is, Doctor, that
7	there is a spectrum along which some smokers may
8	find it hard to quit, very hard to quit at one
9	end of the spectrum --
10	A. Even impossible. Even impossible.
11	Q. Let me finish my question. There is
12	a spectrum, and smokers fall all along that
13	spectrum between finding it very hard to quit or
14	easy to quit, right?
15	MR. SCHULTZ:
16	Object to the form.
17	MR. WATSON:
18	Join.
19	A. Now, I'm not a pharmacologist or a
20	toxicologist or an addiction specialist. So, to
21	adequately, you know, appraise the range of that
22	phenomenon would require expertise that I don't
23	possess.
24	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
25	Q. Okay. So, you're not really
167
1	qualified to address that in your opinion.
2	A. That's correct.
3	Q. Okay. That's fair. You know that
4	smokers who decide they want to quit smoking will
5	choose different methods to try to quit, right?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. We've talked about cold turkey being
8	one method, right?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. Some people will use what are
11	referred to as smoking-cessation aids, right?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Some people will use nicotine gum,
14	right?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. Some people will use nicotine patch,
17	right?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. Other people will use medications,
20	correct?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Some people try acupuncture.
23	A. Right. That's true.
24	Q. Some people try hypnosis.
25	A. That's correct.
168
1	Q. Other people seek the assistance of
2	a professional in helping them to quit smoking,
3	correct?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. So, the methods by which a smoker
6	might try to quit are going to vary from one
7	smoker to the next.
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. And you made mention of this a
10	moment ago. If you take a group of smokers,
11	former smokers, for example -- let's take a group
12	of former smokers. If you polled them all and
13	said how many times did you make an attempt to
14	quit smoking, you're going to find different
15	numbers of attempts among the group, right?
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. Some people could have tried lots of
18	times?
19	A. Correct.
20	Q. Some people may have tried just
21	once?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. And then there will be a bunch of
24	people somewhere in between.
25	MR. SCHULTZ:
169
1	Object to the form.
2	A. Yes.
3	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
4	Q. Again, I appreciate that you're not
5	an expert in this field, but you know that one
6	thing that would distinguish one smoker from the
7	next that would be significant in terms of
8	whether they are going to quit smoking is their
9	level of motivation to, in fact, quit smoking,
10	right?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. Professionals in the subject of
13	nicotine addiction have pointed to motivation as
14	being the single most important characteristic in
15	determining whether a particular smoker will quit
16	smoking, right?
17	MR. SCHULTZ:

21	A. I don't know. That, I just don't
22	know about that.
23	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
24	Q. You haven't read that somewhere?
25	A. I can't testify to what the state of
170
1	practice for a nicotine-cessation specialist is,
2	nor would I intend to testify on that.
3	Q. Dr. Warner hasn't written on that
4	subject?
5	A. He may have.
6	Q. You're just not familiar with
7	anything he might have written about it?
8	A. Right. As a general proposition,
9	it's one thing. Your question, I interpret it to
10	mean what is professional practice in this field
11	is specialized knowledge, and I don't know
12	what --1 don't know what the professionals hold
13	as best practices for nicotine addiction therapy.
14	Q. One thing that would distinguish one
15	cigarette smoker from another -- strike that.
16	Smokers learn about the health risks
17	of cigarette-smoking from a variety of different
18	sources, correct?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. You've talked about that in your
21	depositions for quite some time.
22	A. Yes, I have.
23	Q. There are a variety of different
24	sources of information to which an individual
25	smoker might be exposed about the dangers of
171
1	cigarette-smoking, correct?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. One is your family, right?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Your parents and your siblings?
6	A. Correct.
7	Q. Your teachers?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. The government?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. Other public health authorities,
12	right?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. These are all sources of information
15	from which somebody might learn about the health
16	risks of cigarette-smoking, correct?
17	A. Yes. There are others.
18	Q. Your friends and peers is one such
19	source.
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. You believe that advertising is one
22	of those sources, right?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. Okay. Newspapers, magazines and
25	other what I'll call published media is another
172
1	source of information.
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Television is one such source.
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Radio?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Okay. Today, the internet would be
8	one of those.
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. Not if we go back to the '50s and
11	'60s, right?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. Doctors and other medical
14	professionals would be an important source of
15	information for smokers about the health risks of
16	smoking.
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. And for any particular smoker, the
19	information they get from these sources is going
20	to be different, right?
21	A. I'm sorry. I -- just rephrase it.
22	Don't rephrase it. Just restate it. I kind of
23	drifted.
24	Q. That's fine. No problem. For any
25	particular smoker, and it could be any one of the
173
1	smokers on whose behalf Mr. Schultz has filed a
2	lawsuit or Mr. Watson or any of the lawyers in
3	Escambia or Hillsborough, each of those smokers
4	is going to have been provided information about
5	the health risk of smoking from different
6	sources, right?
7	MR. SCHULTZ:
8	Object to the form.
9	A. Yeah, from multiple sources. Yes,
10	any smoker is going to get it from multiple
11	sources, that's true.
12	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
13	Q. Right. For one particular smoker,
14	hypothetically speaking, the main source of
15	information might be from their family.
16	A. Well, I mean, these are going to
17	fall into patterns and, you know, you have to
18	look at the entire social context of this
19	process. You have to consider all of the
20	factors.
21	Q. The sources of information by which
22	a person may be educated about the health risks
23	of smoking are multifactorial, right?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. "Multifactorial" meaning from
174
1	multiple sources.
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And for any one particular smoker or
4	individual, the extent to which they get
5	information from one source or the other or from
6	multiple sources is going to vary from person to
7	person, right?
8	A. There's going to be variations, but
9	these will fall into general patterns. When you
10	examine groups of people, you will be able to
11	make reasonable generalizations about social
12	practice, behavior and knowledge.
13	Q. You understand there's a concept
14	called source credibility?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. You understand what that concept is?
17	A. Yes. Historians use that term.
18	Q. We all engage in, everybody engages
19	in, in essence, source credibility, don't we?
20	A. Well, it's a technical term in
21	history which you use to evaluate and weigh
22	different primary sources that you find in
23	archives and other historical reported
24	repositories and collections.
25	Q. I'm really taking it --1 mean, I'm
175
1	sore sort of -- let me be clear. I'm not talking
2	so much as a historical term so much as I am the
3	way we go about our lives. My question is: The
4	sources that you might find credible on a
5	particular issue may be very different from the
6	sources that I believe are credible on that same
7	issue, right?
8	A. Well, this is a misconception of how
9	social phenomena and public knowledge develops.
10	I mean, this is, I think, an inappropriate
11	application of that concept, because, as I've
12	testified many times, and you can read my prior
13	testimony on this, the social context of smoking
14	and the social context of practice are in and of
15	themselves sources of knowledge, if you will.
16	And, so, you know, it -- when cigarettes become
17	so woven into the culture as they were, say, in
18	the '50s and '60s, this kind of objective ranking
19	of sources doesn't reflect actual social reality.
20	Q. So, you don't think people out there
21	make their own judgments about whether they
22	believe a particular source of information is
23	credible or not?
24	A. They may make judgments about
25	particular sources, but they also are influenced
176
1	by social practice which they may and, in fact,
2	are typically not completely aware of.
3	Q. You mean we're brainwashed?
4	MR. SCHULTZ:
5	Object to the form.
6	A. No. I'm not saying that. I'm not
7	sure what brainwashing means. I don't -- that's
8	not a term I've ever used. What I'm saying is
9	that social context and social practice are
10	strong influences in what we do, what we know and
11	what we say, you know, about things, like,
12	related to of health and, for that matter, a lot
13	of other things.
14	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
15	Q. My question is: Is it your view
16	that a typical American consumer is not capable
17	of making their own determinations about whether
18	they believe a certain person or entity is a
19	credible source of information?
20	A. That's not what I'm saying. I'm

5	paper, watch television, what we do and what we
6	think is also strongly influenced by social
7	practice, social context and culture which
8	historians are particularly qualified to
9	elaborate over the course of historical time.
10	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
11	Q. I don't think you're really
12	responding to my question. All I'm simply trying
13	to establish, Doctor, is people make judgments
14	every day about whether they're going to find a
15	piece of information they're exposed to, whether
16	it's on the television, a radio or newspaper,
17	whether they are going to deem that piece of
18	information credible or not, right? People do
19	that every day, don't they?
20	A. Right. But we're talking in just
21	kind of a general, abstract proposition, devoid
22	of any actual, specific historical context. It's
23	true enough, but it's essentially meaningless to
24	me as a historian.
25	Q. Well, let me ask you this: If in a
178
1	newspaper there's an article that says Barack
2	Obama is a Muslim, don't you think the readers of
3	that article are going to decide for themselves
4	whether they think the person who wrote that
5	statement is credible or not?
6	A. Yes. Okay. But how they make that
7	decision is going to be shaped by a complex of
8	interplays of culture, you know, social practice,
9	their background as elaborated over historical
10	time.
11	Q. Fair enough. And for each
12	individual, the way they will make that
13	determination is going to be different from
14	individual to the next individual, right?
15	A. That's right, but, you know, human
16	variation, you know, can be put together in
17	groups. I mean, that's why we have statistical
18	analysis. We believe that there are regular
19	patterns to phenomenon, and we'd analyze them
20	that way. Otherwise, everything would be
21	biography and there would be no history.
22	Q. People make judgments every day
23	about whether they're going to find a particular
24	piece of information that they're exposed to
25	credible or not, right?
1	A. They do make judgments. Those
2	judgments are influenced by a complex host of
3	factors.
4	Q. In any particular plaintiffs in
5	whose case your videotape might be played, you
6	don't know how those people would make those
7	credibility decisions, would you?
8	A. I'm not going to give testimony on
9	an individual basis.
10	Q. You wouldn't have the information to
11	even begin to make that judgment about any of
12	those individuals, right?
13	A. That's correct.
14	Q. Let me ask you this question. You
15	have -- you've been very clear, you're not an
16	expert on nicotine addiction, right?
17	A. That's right.
18	Q. So, let me just follow that up. You
19	agree that you would never be qualified to
20	testify whether a particular person was addicted
21	to nicotine in cigarettes, right?
22	A. Right. I'm not going to offer an
23	individual diagnosis.
24	Q. Okay. By the same token, if -- you
25	would not be qualified to render an opinion about
1	whether a particular person who was addicted,
2	whether their addiction to nicotine in cigarettes
3	was the cause of their medical illness or
4	disease, right?
5	A. You're asking me to make an
6	individual diagnosis.
7	Q. I'm asking you whether you're
8	qualified to answer the question I just posed to
9	you.
10	A. No, that's not an area of my
11	expertise.
12	Q. Okay. So, if either of those
13	questions are at issue, you agree, you're not
14	qualified to address those issues?
15	A. For a particular individual, no.
16	Q. Now, if you wanted to know a
17	particular person's knowledge, a particular
18	person's knowledge of the health risks of
19	smoking, you would need to know about all the
20	sources of information about the health risks of
21	smoking to which they were exposed, right?
22	A. Well, I mean, if I wanted to know
23	about a particular individual and they were
24	alive, I'd ask them.
25	Q. Okay. But you haven't done that for
1	any of the individual smokers who are the
2	plaintiffs in the cases in Hillsborough County or
3	Escambia County, right?
4	A. That's right. I will only testify
5	as to the broad social groups and social
6	phenomena of knowledge in historical time.
7	Q. My question was: If Mr. Schultz or
8	Mr. Watson or Mr. Acosta said I want you to
9	assess a particular plaintiffs knowledge of the
10	health risks of cigarette-smoking, you would need
11	to know all the sources of information to which
12	they were exposed, right?
13	A. Within -- yes. I mean, I'm not
14	going to offer individual opinions on this.
15	Q. That's fair, and you may -- look,
16	you may find my questions tedious.
17	A. Yeah.
18	Q. But I'm trying to move things along.
19	A. Okay.
20	Q. So, appreciate that.
21	In order to assess a particular
22	person's knowledge of the health risks, you want
23	to know, for example, their background, right?
24	A. That's correct.
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. You'd want to know what their
3	parents told them about cigarette-smoking?
4	A. To the extent that you can know
5	that, yes.
6	Q. You would want to know if, for
7	example, they had close relatives or loved ones
8	who had a tobacco-related illness during the
9	course of their lives, right?
10	A. That might be important. Sure.
11	Q. You'd want to know about their work,
12	what they did for work and who they were exposed
13	to at work, right?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. Okay. And just so we're clear, as
16	to any of the particular plaintiffs in Mr.
17	Schultz's cases or any of the Escambia or
18	Hillsborough cases, you don't have any of that
19	information, right?
20	A. No. I'm not going to offer
21	individual assessments.
22	Q. And you have no present intention of
23	being provided with that information, right?
24	A. No, not at this time, I don't have
25	that intention.
183
1	Q. So, if we were -- for any of the
2	smokers in whose case your deposition testimony
3	may be played, you don't know when that smoker
4	was born, right?
5	A. That's right.
6	Q. Okay. You don't know where the
7	smoker was bom, correct?
8	A. Correct.
9	Q. So, for example, you don't know in
10	what geographical area of the country that person
11	was raised, correct?
12	A. Right.
13	Q. You don't know what newspapers, for
14	example, would have been published in the area
15	where they were raised, right?
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. You don't know what the person's
18	religious upbringing is, right?
19	A. I -- if I don't know who they are, I
20	don't know that either, yes.
21	Q. You don't know where they attended
22	school, right?
23	A. Right.
24	Q. You don't know what their highest
25	level of education that they attained was, right?
184
1	A. Correct.
2	Q. Okay. You don't know how well they
3	did in their schooling, correct?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. You don't know when they started to
6	smoke cigarettes, correct?
7	A. No.
8	Q. In other words, how old they were
9	when they started to smoke cigarettes.
10	A. That's how I understood that
11	question. Yes.
12	Q. You wouldn't know that for any of
13	the smokers we're talking about here.
14	A. No. This is a generalized
15	testimony. I can talk about classes of smokers.
16	Q. And you wouldn't know in what
17	particular year that the smoker began smoking,
18	correct?
19	A. Any particular individual, no.
20	Q. Okay. You don't know what the
21	circumstances were surrounding the first time
22	they ever tried a cigarette, correct?
23	A. Their individual circumstances, no.
24	Q. And you don't know what the reasons
25	were why they first decided that they would smoke
185
1	cigarettes, correct?
2	A. Correct.
3	Q. You don't know why on a year-to-year
4	or decade-to-decade basis that person might have
5	continued to smoke cigarettes?
6	MR. SCHULTZ:
7	Object to the form.
8	MR. WATSON:
9	Join.
10	A. Aside from the fact that, again, we
11	know that smoking is an addiction-maintenance
12	activity.
13	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
14	Q. Well, are you saying that every
15	single smoker is addicted to cigarettes? I mean,
16	even the experts don't say that, Doctor, right?
17	A. Yeah. I'm not going to offer
18	individual testimony on these things.
19	Q. So, the answer to my question is,
20	for any of these plaintiffs, you don't know why
21	they might have chosen to continue to smoke
22	cigarettes over the years; is that correct?
23	MR. SCHULTZ:
24	Object to the form.
25	MR. WATSON:
186
1	Join.
2	A. That's correct. Doesn't matter to
3	my testimony.
4	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
5	Q. And you don't know what particular
6	brands they might have smoked over their
7	lifetime, right?
8	A. Not any particular individual, no.
9	Q. You don't know about any particular
10	brand choices that that smoker may have made over
11	his or her lifetime, right?
12	A. Right.
13	Q. You don't know if the smoker ever
14	switched from a unfiltered to a filtered
15	cigarette, correct?
16	A. Many people did do that, and I can
17	discuss that as a historical phenomenon, but any
18	particular individual, no.
19	Q. So, you would not be in a position
20	to offer any testimony about why a particular
21	person chose the brand of cigarettes he or she
22	smoked.
23	A. No. We can talk as a social
24	phenomena why many people did choose to smoke
25	filters, but not any particular individual. To
187
1	the extent that, you know, individual -- groups
2	of people are comprised of individuals.
3	Q. Okay. You won't -- you don't know
4	whether any particular smoker chose to quit
5	smoking at any point in his or her lifetime,
6	right?
7	A. I'm sorry. Say that again.
8	Q. You don't know whether any
9	particular smoker chose to quit smoking during
10	his or her lifetime.
11	A. When they did it, no, not for
12	individuals, no.
13	Q. Or how hard they found it to quit,
14	right?
15	A. Right.
16	Q. Or how easy, right?
17	A. Sure, the level of difficulty.
18	Q. You won't know with respect to any
19	one of these smokers whether their doctor ever
20	advised them that they should quit smoking,
21	right?
22	A. Not on an individual basis, no.
23	Q. Okay. You don't know the extent
24	which any of these individuals understood and
25	appreciated the health risks of cigarette -
188
1	smoking, right?
2	A. On an individualized basis, no. I
3	can only talk about groups of individuals and as
4	a phenomena.
5	Q. With respect to their knowledge as
6	to how addictive cigarette-smoking is or how
7	difficult it is to quit, you don't know for any
8	particular smoker what his or her level of
9	knowledge was about the addictive nature of
10	cigarette-smoking, correct?
11	MR. SCHULTZ:
12	Asked and answered.
13	A. That's correct. As I said earlier,
14	I deal in groups.
15	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
16	Q. For example, you wouldn't know
17	whether any particular smoker ever saw or heard
18	about the Frank Statement, right?
19	A. That's right. We can talk about the
20	coverage of the Frank Statement and its impact
21	and their evaluations of its impact. Any
22	particular individual, it's hard to say.
23	Q. Let me ask you this: You've
24	testified in 11 cases, right?
25	A. Yes.
189
1	Q. And in some of those 11 cases, you
2	read the deposition of the plaintiff, right?
3	A. Yeah. In some of those, yes.
4	Q. Have any of those plaintiffs ever
5	testified that they saw or heard the Frank
6	Statement?
7	A. I can't recall. I've --1 don't
8	think I've ever testified about any individual
9	perception or impact on them. I mean, what we
10	know about the Frank Statement is that it was
11	widely circulated when it was published.
12	MR. GERAGHTY:
13	I'm going to move to strike
14	the last part of that answer as
15	nonresponsive.
16	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
17	Q. To the best of your knowledge as you
18	sit here today, none of the plaintiffs in any of
19	the previous 11 cases in which you've testified
20	have ever testified that they saw or heard the
21	Frank Statement, correct?
22	A. I can't recall either way, and I've
23	never testified on that fact. So, I don't know.
24	I just don't know on that because, again, I'm
25	being consistent in my testimony in that I've
190
I	never offered individualized judgments --
2	judgments that pertain to particular individuals.
3	I've always talked about this as a social
4	phenomenon, broad historical time. That would be
5	consistent with what my prior testimony has been.
6	Q. You would agree that for purposes of
7	this deposition and the opinions you're going to
8	offer, you're in no position to offer any
9	judgments about any of these individuals, right?
10	A. Yes. I've said that numerous times.
II	MR. SCHULTZ:
12	The testimony on December
13	9th and 10th.
14	MR. GERAGHTY:
15	Thank you for clarifying
16	that.
17	A. Yes.
18	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
19	Q. You don't know what newspaper
20	articles any of these individuals read, correct?
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. So, you don't know to what extent
23	they read articles that talked about the health
24	risks of cigarette-smoking in those newspapers,
25	right?
191
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. And to the extent that there may
3	have been a statement in any of these newspaper
4	articles about -- or from a representative of the
5	Tobacco Institute or the Council for Tobacco
6	Research, you don't know whether any of these
7	individual smokers ever read a statement to that
8	effect, right?
9	A. Right. We know the statements were
10	made and they appeared in national media, but any
11	particular individual, it's hard to say. I
12	haven't looked into that.
13	Q. You haven't -- well, the one paper
14	that you've looked at fairly comprehensively is
15	The New York Times.
16	A. Yes. I've looked at the Times most
17	comprehensively, yes. It's not the only one, but
18	I've looked at that one thoroughly.
19	Q. With respect to any one of these
20	individuals, you don't know kind of what their
21	reading habits were, right?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. So, you don't know whether they read
24	Reader's Digest or Time or Newsweek or any kind
25	of magazine, periodical or newspaper that would
192
1	discuss the health risks of cigarette-smoking,
2	right?
3	A. That's correct.
4	Q. And you don't know what their
5	television-watching habits were, right?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. So, you don't know to what extent
8	they were exposed to information on the health
9	risks of smoking on television was, correct?
10	A. That's correct.
11	Q. You don't know whether any of these
12	people watched the evening news the day that the
13	Surgeon General's Report came out, correct?
14	A. That's correct.
15	Q. You don't know to what extent these
16	people may have been exposed to cigarette
17	advertisements in television, radio or
18	newspapers, right?
19	A. That's correct.
20	MR. SCHULTZ:
21	Are we nearing the end of
22	the list, Bill?
23	MR. GERAGHTY:
24	We are nearing the end of
25	the list.
193
1	MR. SCHULTZ:
2	Thank you.
3	THE WITNESS:
4	I've given you snappy
5	answers.
6	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
7	Q. Now, in one of the previous cases
8	that you and I were involved in, you said --
9	paraphrasing -- but that your opinions apply to
10	the plaintiff only to the extent that that
11	plaintiff is a member of the larger population of
12	smokers. Do you still agree with that
13	paraphrasing?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And, so, I mean, to the extent that
16	you tried to say that opinion applied to a
17	particular person, though, you would agree that
18	it would be speculative on your part to say that,
19	right?
20	MR. SCHULTZ:
21	Object to the form.
22	A. That's correct.
23	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
24	Q. Okay.
25	A. In fact, I -- you know, that's up to
194
1	the jury to decide.
2	(Whereupon, a discussion was
3	held off the record.)
4	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
5	Q. Let me ask this. I don't want to
6	belabor the point. I could go through every
7	subject matter.
8	A. I'm here.
9	Q. I'll ask this and then we'll take a
10	break. You've been very clear that you -- what
11	your area of expertise is, and we've asked you in
12	past depositions, you know, about your expertise
13	in a variety of fields. Mr. Koethe asked you a
14	lot of questions about this back in September.
15	Do you claim to have expertise in any areas that
16	you didn't tell us about back in September?
17	A. No.
18	Q. Or do you claim to have expertise in
19	any areas that you didn't tell us you had back in
20	December, when Mr. Rosenstein took your
21	deposition in the Ferlanti case?
22	A. No. No change.
23	MR. GERAGHTY:
24	All right. Let's take a
25	short break.
195
1	(Whereupon, a discussion was
2	held off the record.)
3	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
4	Q. Let me ask you a -- you acknowledged
5	earlier that you're not an expert on nicotine
6	addiction. So, if -- you would not be qualified
7	to offer an opinion about whether a particular
8	smoker could have quit at an early point in time
9	in their life, correct?
10	A. That's correct. I'm not going to
11	offer that opinion.
12	Q. You know, we've talked --1
13	understand what your opinions are about the
14	things that the tobacco companies did at points
15	in time history historically, but I think we
16	agreed in the deposition at the Hess and Sherman
17	cases that you're not in a position to say
18	whether any of the things the companies did,
19	whether that caused harm or injury to a
20	particular plaintiff, right?
21	MR. SCHULTZ:
22	Object to the form.
23	A. In a one-on-one, like, individual --
24	particular statement to a particular individual,
25	no. I mean, the way I talk about the industry
196
1	actions is that they, over time, created, you
2	know, an expectation about the -- in the mind of
3	the public generally about how cigarettes would
4	function and perform, you know, what they did or
5	what they didn't do. You know, the industry
6	actions hindered the growth of the -- of public
7	knowledge on the risks of smoking. You know,
8	getting back to the extent that this affected the
9	individual, the individual would be part of a
10	larger group.
11	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
12	Q. Let me try to be more specific.
13	You're not a lawyer, right?
14	A. No, I'm not.
15	Q. And you don't hold yourself out as
16	being an expert in any area of the law, right?
17	A. I do not, no.
18	Q. You do not know how Florida law
19	defines concealment, right?
20	A. No, I don't.
21	Q. All right. So, you would agree that
22	you would not be qualified or in a position to
23	offer an opinion whether the concealment of any
24	information by any tobacco company was the
25	proximate cause of any particular plaintiffs
1	injury or disease, right?
2	MR. SCHULTZ:
3	Object to the form.
4	MR. WATSON:
5	Join.
6	A. In the legal sense, you mean,
7	fulfilling the legal test?
8	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
9	Q. Yes, sir.
10	A. No, I'm not going to make a judgment
11	about the law.
12	Q. Let me make sure we're clear. I'm
13	not asking you to make a judgment about the law.
14	I'm asking you, given what you've told me, that
15	your opinions are going to be generic and that
16	you're not going to be exposed to any information
17	about any particular smoker, given all that, do
18	you agree that you are not going to be in a
19	position to say whether any alleged concealment
20	of any information by Philip Morris, R. J.
21	Reynolds, Lorillard Tobacco Company, Liggett,
22	Vector caused harm to a particular plaintiff?
23	A. I'd agree with you on that.
24	Q. You're not going to be offering that
25	kind of testimony?
1	A. I'm not going to be offering that
2	kind of testimony.
3	Q. We talked last time about the Engle
4	case. Remember, I asked you what you knew about
5	the Engle case?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. I don't want to repeat any of those
8	questions, but have you -- I'm just wondering
9	whether that dialogue prompted you to go back and
10	look at Engle or read Engle or do anything to
11	understand the Engle case any better?
12	A. No, I haven't done -- no -- nothing
13	in that area.
14	Q. You haven't read the opinion out of
15	Florida Supreme Court?
16	A. No, I have not.
17	Q. You didn't testify in the Engle
18	case, right?
19	A. No, I didn't do that.
20	Q. You never attended any portion of
21	the trial and observed it, did you?
22	A. No.
23	Q. You've never -- have you read any of
24	the verdicts that were returned by the jury?
25	A. No, I've not read about -- not read
1	the original documents related to the Engle case.
2	Q. Have you read the testimony of, for
3	example, any of the testimony of any of the
4	plaintiffs witnesses in the Engle case?
5	MR. SCHULTZ:
6	Object to the form.
7	MR. WATSON:
8	Join.
9	A. No, I did not read that.
10	MR. GERAGHTY:
11	What's wrong with the form
12	of that question?
13	MR. SCHULTZ:
14	The way it's phrased, he may
15	have read the testimony of David
16	Bums, but not in the Engle case,
17	and that was encompassed by your
18	question.
19	MR. GERAGHTY:
20	How do you want me to
21	rephrase it?
22	MR. SCHULTZ:
23	You can rephrase it any way
24	you want. I'm not here to tell
1	just saying I think the question
2	was ambiguous and capable of a
3	misleading response from the
4	witness.
5	MR. GERAGHTY:
6	Let me try again.
7	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
8	Q. Have you read the testimony of any
9	witness offered by the plaintiff in the Engle
10	case?
11	A. If I have, it would have been
12	whomever the expert historian was, and if I did,
13	it would be listed in the table of documents
14	reviewed in my data article, and I've reviewed
15	about 18 or 19 trials for that study. So, I ask
16	you to consult that table to see if I read it.
17	Q. Okay. You just told me you read
18	defense expert testimony, right?
19	A. Oh, I misunderstood your question.
20	Q. Let me rephrase the question. Have
21	you read any testimony offered by the plaintiff
22	in the Engle case?
23	A. No. No. I misunderstood what you
24	were saying.
25	Q. And you don't know what documents
201
1	were introduced during the course of the trial by
2	the plaintiff in the Engle case?
3	A. No, I don't.
4	Q. The jury returned certain findings.
5	You may have heard something generally about
6	those findings.
7	A. Right.
8	Q. But for any of those particular
9	findings that the jury returned, you don't know
10	what the specific evidence was that the jury
11	based its determination on, do you?
12	A. No. No. I have no need to know
13	that.
14	Q. And nobody would be able to know
15	that, right?
16	MR. SCHULTZ:
17	Object to the form.
18	A. Well, I guess you studied the trial,
19	you might be able to know, or the lawyers might
20	know, but I don't.
21	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
22	Q. You don't know what they based their
23	findings on, correct?
24	A. The jury?
25	Q. Yes.
202
1	A. No. I don't know anything about how
2	that case was conducted.
3	Q. All right. Since you don't know
4	what evidence or conduct the jury based its
5	findings on, you're not in the position to say
6	whether that evidence or conduct caused harm to
7	any particular plaintiff, right?
8	A. Well, I just don't -- I'm unfamiliar
9	with that case. I haven't studied that case.
10	So, I don't know how that case was decided. So,
11	no, I don't know.
12	Q. You wouldn't be able to say that,
13	correct?
14	A. No.
15	Q. For the same reason, because you
16	don't know what particular evidence or conduct
17	the jury based its finding on, you don't know
18	whether that conduct was something that, for
19	example, Philip Morris engaged in within the
20	state of Florida, right?
21	A. I'm not sure if I follow your
22	question. You know, if it relates to Philip
23	Morris's conduct, that, I know a great deal
24	about. If it relates to how Philip Morris's
25	conduct was discussed over the course of that
203
1	trial and how it was presented at the trial,
2	that, I don't know because I didn't attend that
3	trial. I didn't testify in that trial. I've not
4	read the transcripts of that file -- of that
5	trial. I meant to say trial, not file. That's
6	not an area that I've concerned myself with.
7	Q. Right. I understand. My question
8	is limited to the conduct, for example, of Philip
9	Morris that was presented to the jury during that
10	trial. You don't know whether any of that
11	conduct occurred in the state of Florida or not.
12	Do you know?
13	A. I haven't looked at that trial.
14	Q. Do you have any plans to do so?
15	A. No.
16	Q. What information -- do you believe
17	that Philip Morris or any of the other companies
18	that are defendants in this case concealed
19	information from the public?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. What information do you believe they
22	concealed? And, if you could, specify, you know,
23	which entity you're talking about.
24	A. Sure. Overall, the sponsors of the
25	TIRC, including Philip Morris, over a long period
204
1	of time concealed from the public the purpose of
2	that effort, the true purpose of that effort.
3	Q. When you say "the purpose of that
4	effort," you mean the members of the TIRC
5	concealed the purpose of creating the TIRC? Is
6	that what you mean?
7	A. Right, from the public.
8	Q. Okay. And you believe the TIRC was
9	created for what purpose?
10	A. It was a public relations effort to
11	sow doubt and confusion in the mind of the public
12	as to the truth of the emerging science that
13	cigarettes caused lung cancer.
14	Q. Okay. Anything else that they --
15	when I say "they," I mean collectively the
16	defendants -- concealed?
17	A. Philip Morris, Brown & Williamson
18	concealed from the public, at least among the
19	upper ranks of management, their knowledge that
20	smoking was addictive -- that nicotine was
21	addictive. They also concealed from the
22	public -- R. J. Reynolds and -- R. J. Reynolds
23	concealed from the public -- and Philip Morris --
24	that their basic business model for their company
25	is based on the proposition of addicting young
205
1	people to cigarettes and then finding replacement
2	smokers for the ones that die from smoking. I
3	think the industry concealed the true purpose of
4	the AMA educational research fund they gave them
5	in the mid-'60s. I think, overall, Philip Morris
6	and R. J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson
7	concealed from the public the notion that they --
8	they presented themselves as interested in the
9	public's health as it relates to their products,
10	but, in fact, what they concealed from the public
11	was that they were working their darnedest to
12	make sure that the public did not completely
13	understand the risks of smoking. That would be
14	American Tobacco as well. I said Brown &
15	Williamson, but Brown & Williamson bought
16	American Tobacco. So, I'm putting those two
17	together. Now, they're part of Reynolds. The
18	Tobacco Industry Research Committee concealed
19	from the public that it worked assiduously behind
20	the scenes to influence media coverage of the
21	smoking-and-health issue. They concealed from
22	the public that they were sponsoring articles and
23	books which put forth their message without
24	informing the public. They concealed from the
25	public their activities in suppressing
206
1	information related to smoking and health coming
2	out in other venues. So, there's a lot.
3	Q. Is there anything else?
4	A. From my perspectives -- you know,
5	I'm not going to talk about the science. That's
6	a whole 'nother issue. I'm dealing here just in
7	terms of the things that I have identified as my
8	testimony.
9	Q. Right. You've been very clear in
10	the past that you're not an expert on the state
11	of the art as to the medical or scientific
12	connection between cigarette-smoking and lung
13	cancer at any particular point in time, right?
14	A. That's correct.
15	Q. All right. But I just want to make
16	sure I haven't missed anything. Have you told me
17	everything you wanted to tell me in response to
18	that?
19	A. Yeah. And just, you know, keep in
20	mind that I've testified as consistently over
21	numerous trials and that my -- you know, I
22	anticipate my testimony will be completely in
23	congruence or in accord with my prior testimony.
24	Q. And the list of items you gave me,
25	things that you believe have been concealed, you
207
1	don't view any of this as being anything new or
2	different from what you've said in the past?
3	A. That's correct.
4	Q. All right. Let me just ask you a
5	couple of follow-up questions. Sort of following
6	up on what we talked about earlier about the fact
7	that you don't have any depositions of any
8	particular plaintiff or any other information
9	about any particular plaintiff, while you're
10	prepared to talk about the information that you
11	believe was concealed, you don't have the
12	information to be in a position to testify
13	whether the concealment of these particular
14	things affected or influenced any particular
15	smoker in whose case your deposition may be
16	played, the deposition of December 9th and 10th,
17	right?
18	MR. SCHULTZ:
19	Object to form.
20	A. That's correct.
21	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
22	Q. You probably testified about this in
23	the past, if so, I apologize for it, but the AM A
24	research fund, you say that they concealed the
25	true purpose of that?
208
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. What was the true purpose of the
3	fund?
4	A. Well, it's publicly put forth as,
5	again, a research fund, but it's clear from the
6	Philip Morris documentation that it was, in
7	essence, a gift to the American Medical
8	Association as part of a complex alignment of
9	interests in the mid-1960s.
10	Q. You believe it was a bribe, right?
11	A. I do, yes.
12	Q. You've said as much, correct?
13	A. I have, yes, that's right. I think
14	they bought them off.
15	Q. Who bribed whom, in your opinion?
16	A. TIRC -- the Tobacco Institute --
17	Q. Who was it?
18	A. The Tobacco Institute bribed the
19	American Medical Association. That's the
20	direction there.
21	Q. Who was the -- who in particular at
22	the American Medical Association accepted the
23	bribe?
24	A. Forget his first name. Blasinghame,
25	who came out in opposition to warnings.
209
1	Q. Dr. Blasinghame?
2	A. Yeah. Not sure how to pronounce it.
3	Q. B-L-A-S-I-N-G-H-A-M-E.
4	A. Yeah, came out in a very famous
5	letter against warnings on cigarettes. There's
6	more involved than that. It's the money. It's
7	also the American Medical Association was seeking
8	things from the Tobacco Institute as well.
9	Q. I just want to be clear, though, how
10	much money exchanged hands.
11	A. My recollection of that is it was a
12	$ 10 million fund.
13	Q. Okay. So, the Tobacco Institute --
14	I want to make sure I understand what you're
15	saying. The Tobacco Institute paid Dr.
16	Blasinghame and the American Medical Association
17	$10 million--
18	A. Yes, for a research fund.
19	Q. That was the stated purpose,
20	correct?
21	A. That's right.
22	Q. But you believe the true purpose was
23	so that the American Medical Association would
24	write a letter and state publicly that it did not
25	believe that warnings on cigarette packs were
210
1	necessary?
2	A. Right, and it's a little bit larger
3	than that. I mean, in essence, they're buying
4	the cooperation of the AMA and, you know, I mean,
5	the coincidental proof of this is the fact that
6	the report that this fund was supposed to
7	purchase -- was supposed to fund wasn't published
8	until the late 1970s, you know, and given the
9	immediacy of the public health concerns over
10	smoking and health in the mid-'60s, that's quite
11	late indeed.
12	Q. All right. I just wanted to make
13	sure I understood what you were saying about
14	that. All right. So, you've clarified that
15	particular point.
16	You've given me --1 don't want to
17	put words in your mouth, but you've given me a
18	list of items of information you believe was
19	concealed.
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. I just want to, before I move on, is
22	there anything further, or have you given me all
23	of the things you believe were concealed?
24	A. Yeah. I mean, that's the general --
25	that's the general gist of it, yes.
211
1	Q. Okay. We talked about this a moment
2	ago, but I wanted to just -- you don't know how
3	Florida law defines a defective product, do you?
4	A. No, I don't.
5	Q. And you don't know how Florida law
6	defines the term unreasonably dangerous, do you?
7	A. I do not.
8	Q. Do you know how many --in how many
9	cases you have been disclosed as an expert
10	witness?
11	A. I don't know the exact number.
12	Q. So, it may be more than 100, as far
13	as you know?
14	A. It might be. We discussed this at
15	the September deposition, and I have no new
16	information on that issue.
17	Q. Okay. Is any plaintiffs lawyer in
18	the state of Florida who has filed a Engle
19	tobacco case free to disclose you as an expert in
20	their case?
21	A. No.
22	Q. No? Okay.
23	A. Only people that have called me and
24	asked my permission.
25	Q. All right. So, who would those
212
1	people be that have called you and asked for your
2	permission and who you would say today have your
3	authorization to list you as an expert on behalf
4	of or in one or more of their cases?
5	MR. SCHULTZ:
6	I'll object to the form.
7	MR. WATSON:
8	Join.
9	A. Woody Wilner's law firm.
10	W-I-L-N-E-R. That would be in the Levine Landers
11	case, which you're familiar with, I'm sure.
12	Danny O'Shea for the Ferlanti case. Gary Paige,
13	for his set of cases. And Matt Schultz and
14	Howard Acosta, working together on their cases.
15	Those are the people I have talked with. Anybody
16	else is doing so without my permission.
17	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
18	Q. So, anybody else besides the five
19	attorneys you've mentioned, if they have listed
20	your name as an expert in one of their cases,
21	they have done so without your permission, right?
22	MR. SCHULTZ:
23	Object to the form.
24	MR. WATSON:
25	Join.
213
1	A. Right, unless there is some
2	relationship --1 don't know exactly how their
3	relationships are going, but Howard Acosta and
4	Mr. Schultz have some set of cases, and they may
5	be cross-working these with some other attorneys
6	and I may not know all the attorneys, but
7	something would have to originate with one of
8	those people.
9	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
10	Q. Have you ever met an attorney named
11	Steve Barnes?
12	A. No.
13	Q. Have you ever met an attorney named
14	Hank Uiterwyck?
15	A. No.
16	Q. Are Mr. Barnes or Mr. Uiterwyck
17	authorized to list you as an expert in their
18	cases?
19	MR. SCHULTZ:
20	Object to the form.
21	A. Unless they are working with one of
22	the people on that list. I know that these
23	things can get quite complex in terms of layered
24	cross-representations. But if they're
25	unconnected to any of those people and I haven't
1	talked to them --
2	MR. SCHULTZ:
3	I object to the manner of
4	taking, Bill, because I think it
5	exploits his understandable
6	ignorance of the procedural
7	niceties in these cases. These
8	cases are being handled in
9	Hillsborough and Escambia
10	particularly, but all case
11	designations, that are quite
12	different and unique than most
13	cases. So, he does not understand
14	all the procedural niceties, and I
15	fear the answers your getting will
16	show up in Steve Barnes' or Hank
17	Uiterwyck's cases and that his
18	ignorance of that process is being
19	manipulated here.
20	MR. GERAGHTY:
21	No. I think what's being
22	manipulated is the fact that the
23	doctor, his name is being used by
24	lawyers who have never met or laid
25	eyes on him, and I don't know and,
1	frankly, I believe that under
2	Florida law, that's not
3	appropriate, and I'm entitled to
4	explore what the doctor knows
5	about his relationships with these
6	attorneys. Whether you and Mr.
7	Watson believe this is only an
8	issue of procedural niceties and
9	you're allowed to do this is an
10	issue that will be resolved at
11	some point perhaps by the judge,
12	but I'm entitled to ask Dr.
13	Kyriakoudes what he knows about
14	his relationship with all of these
15	attorneys that listed him.
16	MR. SCHULTZ:
17	I do not dispute that. I'm
18	not going to try and make you not
19	ask the questions. I'm just
20	trying to clear up the record,
21	because Florida law also includes
22	the two Case Management Orders in
23	places -- Hillsborough and
24	Escambia Counties.
25	MR. GERAGHTY:
1	I understand that, but I
2	object to the notion that somehow
3	the questions I'm asking this
4	doctor are misleading, because
5	they are anything but. They are
6	simple, direct questions about who
7	he has spoken to, what those
8	conversations are and, as far as
9	he's concerned, what those lawyers
10	are authorized by him to do.
11	MR. SCHULTZ:
12	I think, when you read the
13	transcript, you'll realize I
14	didn't say your questions were
15	misleading. I said that his
16	answers could be misleading. But
17	go ahead. I just wanted to make
18	it clear where I'm at on it.
19	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
20	Q. Have you met any attorneys from the
21	law firm Alley, Clark?
22	A. No.
23	Q. Have you ever met the Alley, Clark
24	law firm?
25	A. No, I've never heard of it.
Ill
1	Q. Have you personally authorized the
2	Alley, Clark law firm to list you as an expert in
3	their cases?
4	A. I have not. Now, unless they are
5	cocounsel to one of the people that I've
6	discussed right here --1 mean, that may be the
7	case.
8	Q. Well, if these lawyers have their
9	own set of cases that some may be in the same
10	county where Mr. Schultz's cases are pending,
11	some may be in the same county where Mr. Watson's
12	cases are pending, but they are not cocounsel of
13	record in those cases, are they authorized to
14	designate you as an expert witness in those
15	cases?
16	MR. SCHULTZ:
17	Same objection.
18	MR. WATSON:
19	Join.
20	A. No. I mean, if I've not talked with
21	them, they've not asked me.
22	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
23	Q. Okay.
24	A. I charge a fee for this. My name
218
1	And if I get a -- no. No, they don't.
2	Q. You certainly -- I'll withdraw that.
3	Have you ever met an attorney by the
4	name of Greg Prysock?
5	A. I don't know that name.
6	Q. Have you ever had any contact with
7	the law firm of Morgan & Morgan?
8	A. Don't know that name.
9	Q. Has that law firm retained you?
10	A. I've given you the list of the
11	people that I've authorized to -- to work with.
12	Q. I'll try to shorten this. I don't
13	want to belabor it. But the lawyers who have
14	retained you in Engle progeny cases include Woody
15	Wilner, right?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. Danny O'Shea, correct?
18	A. Yes, and he works with the Uustal
19	people, Todd McFarland.
20	Q. But they've retained you in the
21	Ferlanti case only, correct?
22	A. That's right.
23	Q. Gary Paige is another one who's
24	retained you, right?
25	A. That's right.
219
1	Q. Matt Schultz, right?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And Howard Acosta, correct?
4	A. That's right.
5	Q. Other than those five lawyers, no
6	other lawyer has retained you to serve as an
7	expert witness in any of their cases, correct?
8	A. That's right. I mean, they're free
9	to call me and talk about it, but at this point,
10	no, they've not contacted me.
11	Q. Are you willing to allow lawyers
12	you've never met, lawyers with whom you've never
13	spoken, to list you in cases they choose?
14	MR. SCHULTZ:
15	Objection.
16	MR. WATSON:
17	Join.
18	A. No. They're free to call me and
19	explain to me what services they seek, and if
20	it's something --1 can tell them what my
21	testimony is, and if it's something that, you
22	know, that would work out, that's one thing.
23	But, no, without having ever contacted me, no.
24	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
25	Q. And Mr. McFarland has never
220
1	contacted you, for example, about any of his
2	cases in Broward County other than the Ferlanti
3	case, right?
4	A. That's right, yeah, although, I'd
5	certainly be willing to talk to him, but --
6	Q. But he has never initiated a contact
7	with you, has he?
8	A. No.
9	Q. Have you ever told Mr. McFarland
10	that you would be unwilling to testify live in
11	any of his cases?
12	A. No.
13	Q. And if Mr. McFarland called you on
14	the phone and said, Dr. Kyriakoudes, I have my
15	own group of cases in Broward County, I've read
16	your testimony, I would like you to serve as an
17	expert in my cases, would you be willing to
18	appear to testify at any of Todd McFarland's
19	trials if your schedule permitted you to do so?
20	A. Yes, I would be, yes.
21	Q. And would that be true of these
22	other plaintiffs law firms if they called you
23	and made the inquiry?
24	A. I would consider it, you know,
25	depending upon, you know, my schedule and, you
221
1	know, as long as they were clear on the issues of
2	my expertise and that they understood what my
3	opinions were, because my opinions don't change.
4	You know, my research is what my research is.
5	You know, that kind of thing. You know, I
6	wouldn't want to do it if they were not clear as
7	to what I would testify on. I'm very careful
8	about that.
9	Q. Right. You understand that -- well,
10	you believe that who you work with and the cases
11	in which you choose to be involved, that your
12	professional reputation is on the line whenever
13	you choose to get involved in a particular case
14	with a particular lawyer, right?
15	A. That's right. And, you know, I
16	can't -- you know, I don't accept every case.
17	Q. Have you ever rejected any case?
18	A. I have, yes.
19	Q. Whose cases have you rejected? Just
20	tell me about that.
21	A. I was once asked by an attorney for
22	a case -- it was the Atlanta football player,
23	Atlanta Falcons -- Willie Gault.
24	Q. He had a tobacco case?
25	A. No. His sister.
222
1	Q. Oh.
2	A. Apparently, his sister, and I
3	discussed the content of my testimony and my
4	opinions and I wasn't able to -- what I testified
5	on and told them that I couldn't really be --1
6	told them what my opinions were, and they felt
7	that that wouldn't be helpful in their particular
8	situation.
9	I was also deposed for a case, but
10	didn't testify, largely because I told the
11	plaintiffs attorney that, you know, my opinions
12	are this and I don't think I would -- you know,
13	doesn't seem suitable.
14	Q. Do you remember the name of the
15	lawyer who represented Willie Gault's sister?
16	A. I don't.
17	Q. What year did this take place?
18	A. It was about -- it was a few years
19	ago. Maybe around 2005, '04.
20	Q. Where was the case pending, do you
21	recall that?
22	A. I don't recall. You know, I don't
23	remember.
24	Q. The case where you were deposed but
25	didn't testify at trial, is that deposition on
223
I	your --
2	A. Yes, on my CV.
3	Q. Okay.
4	A. I can tell you what it is.
5	Q. I'll just hand it to you.
6	A. It was the Reller case, the
7	second -- like a retrial of the Reller case.
8	Q. This is Michael Pews?
9	A. Pews, as in church pew. That's the
10	way I remember his name.
II	Q. And you didn't think you would be
12	able to help him in that case. Why?
13	A. I had a deposition much like this
14	one, and I forget the details, but the way this
15	case was being retried, and I forget the details,
16	but the rulings were so very narrow, it just
17	didn't seem -- my testimony didn't seem relevant
18	to the very narrow legal issues, which I don't
19	even remember because it was 2004 that this
20	occurred in, towards the end of 2004.
21	Q. Do you normally evaluate to what
22	extent your particular opinions -- you don't
23	normally know what the issues are in a particular
24	case, right?
25	A. Right, but he called me and we
224
1	talked about it and he laid out this -- if I
2	recall, it was -- you know, the issue was on
3	awareness, not belief, you know, and I'm not
4	exactly sure because it's been a long time, and I
5	told him, look, you know -- he kind of came to
6	the opinion that we both did, that, in that
7	particular case, it just wasn't -- my testimony
8	wasn't particularly relevant, you know, for the
9	particular circumstances of that case.
10	Q. Do you think if a lawyer wants to
11	use the videotape of your deposition that is
12	created on December 9th and 10th, do you think
13	they should have to pay you to do that?
14	A. Well, I mean, this is my words. I
15	live by my research and my work product. One way
16	or another, I mean, I'm doing this for, you know,
17	compensation. Yes. I've got a family to
18	support.
19	Q. Okay. So, anybody who would want to
20	use the videotape, Number 1, should give you a
21	call on the phone, correct?
22	A. To -- yeah, and run by whether they
23	want to have me on their case and I can talk to
24	them about it and see if it's something that's
25	appropriate.
225
1	Q. And retain you. They should retain
2	you, right?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And then discuss whatever you and
5	that lawyer believe are appropriate terms of
6	compensation, correct?
7	A. That's right.
8	MR. SCHULTZ:
9	And I'll make the same
10	objection I made earlier, form.
11	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
12	Q. And with the exception of the five
13	lawyers you mentioned earlier, no other lawyer
14	has called you and had that kind of conversation
15	with you, right?
16	A. That's right.
17	Q. Let's talk -- have you done -- you
18	mentioned earlier that you had done a
19	comprehensive review of The New York Times,
20	right?
21	A. That's right.
22	Q. Okay. And I didn't spell it out as
23	clearly as perhaps I should, but you did a
24	comprehensive review of The New York Times
25	designed to find all of the information about
226
1	smoking and health that appeared in The New York
2	Times for a given time frame, correct?
3	A. That's right.
4	Q. And for -- if you could, give me the
5	time period throughout which you have done what
6	we'll call a comprehensive review of that
7	newspaper.
8	A. Yes. For the times I began in the
9	nineteen teens, carried forward into the 1970s,
10	and then kind of added to that, and it goes into
11	the early 1990s.
12	Q. Okay. And for any decade -- let's
13	use a decade -- have you done a similar
14	comprehensive review of all of the information
15	published in any newspaper about smoking and
16	health for any particular decade in time?
17	A. Other newspapers?
18	Q. Yes, sir.
19	A. Yeah. I've done work on the
20	Hartford Courant.
21	Q. Let me help you here. We talked
22	earlier about the papers that are on the reliance
23	list. Would those be the papers for which you
24	had done a comprehensive review?
25	A. Yes.
227
1	Q. Let me give you the list and that
2	might speed things along, and if that list isn't
3	all-inclusive, you tell me if there's others.
4	You mentioned the Hartford Courant, right?
5	A. (Nods head affirmatively.)
6	Q. Yes?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. The New York Times, correct?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And the question is: Have you done
11	a comprehensive review of all of the articles
12	that discuss issues of smoking and health in this
13	particular newspaper for any particular decade,
14	and then I might ask you about the decade.
15	Atlanta Constitution, yes or no?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. Hartford Courant, we've discussed,
18	right?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Los Angeles Times?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Did you do that for a particular
23	case?
24	A. No, I didn't.
25	Q. Was that for the Reller case?
228
1	A. No, it wasn't.
2	Q. You didn't do it for a particular
3	case?
4	A. No. LA Times was just kind of
5	generalized research.
6	Q. The Boston Daily Globe?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. For what decade?
9	A. That's fairly limited, and if I
10	recall, I think you find most of the dates, they
11	are early, in the early 20th century, which would
12	also be the case for The Atlanta Constitution.
13	Q. Okay. How about the Chicago Daily
14	Tribune?
15	A. Also, kind of the early 20th century
16	period.
17	Q. The Washington Post?
18	A. Some limited searching in there. I
19	wasn't very comprehensive with The Washington
20	Post.
21	Q. So, have you done what I'll
22	characterize as a comprehensive review of any
23	other newspaper for any other decade other than
24	the ones we've just mentioned here?
25	A. For the 1950s, the New York Daily
229
1	News. For the 1950s and '60s, set of Iowa
2	newspapers. Also, for the nineteen teens for
3	Iowa.
4	Q. Does the nineteen teens mean between
5	1910 and 1920?
6	A. Yes. Thank you for clarifying that.
7	Q. That's all right.
8	A. Also, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
9	Q. Was that for the Mash case?
10	A. That was, yes.
11	Q. And that was a case that was tried
12	in St. Louis?
13	A. That's right.
14	Q. Was Mr. Rosenstein's client,
15	Liggett, one of the defendants? Do you remember
16	who the defendants were in that case?
17	A. Yeah. I thought it was Brown &
18	Williamson.
19	Q. All right. So, in addition to the
20	list I provided you from your reliance materials,
21	you mentioned the New York Daily News, some Iowa
22	papers and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch?
23	A. That's right.
24	Q. Anything else?
25	A. I believe that's it. Went through
230
1	Newsday a bit in the '60s.
2	Q. Newsday?
3	A. Yeah. Some of that got washed out,
4	to put it mildly. Those were all in paper form.
5	Q. Is that it?
6	A. Yeah.
7	Q. Okay. You have not done a
8	comprehensive review of the daily newspaper in
9	Fort Lauderdale, right?
10	A. No.
11	Q. You have not done a comprehensive
12	review of The Miami Herald, right?
13	A. Right. In fact, just to make your
14	time quicker, if I may be so presumptuous, all my
15	answers now would be the same as they were in
16	September when we went through this then.
17	Q. Let me try to shortchange it then.
18	In September, you told us that you had at one
19	point online looked at some of the coverage of
20	the Surgeon General's Report in January of 1964
21	from The Miami Herald, right? Do you recall
22	telling us that?
23	A. Yes. It wasn't online, though. It
24	wasn't online.
25	Q. Were those the ones that you threw
231
1	out the documents because they got soggy and wet
2	and --
3	A. That's to put it mildly. Yeah.
4	Yeah.
5	Q. Whether it was online or not, you
6	did look at some of the news coverage in The
7	Miami Herald of the Surgeon General's Report from
8	approximately -- it would have been sometime in
9	January, 1964, right?
10	A. That's right.
11	Q. But aside from that, you haven't
12	looked at The Miami Herald during the decade of
13	the 1950s or the decade of the 1960s, right?
14	A. No, I have not.
15	Q. Or any decade, for that matter?
16	A. That's right.
17	Q. And if I were to --1 mean, I could
18	go through a laundry list of Florida newspapers,
19	but the same would be true of any daily newspaper
20	in the state of Florida, correct?
21	A. Right.
22	Q. You have done no comprehensive
23	review of the articles discussing smoking and
24	health issues in any Florida newspaper for any
25	decade, right?
232
1	A. That's right.
2	Q. And you don't have any plans to do
3	that between now and December 9th, do you?
4	A. I do not.
5	Q. In your reliance materials, do you
6	have any materials that you would -- you would
7	characterize as being Florida-specific?
8	A. I've got in my files some copies of
9	early 20th century Florida public health
10	publications, Florida Health Notes. That would
11	be Florida-specific. I believe those are listed
12	in the list.
13	Q. And how did you obtain the copies of
14	the Florida Health Notes you have?
15	A. I forget. It may -- it's something
16	I just kind of collected in the course of my
17	research.
18	Q. They were given to you by Mr.
19	Acosta, right?
20	A. I may well have gotten it from him,
21	or it's just as likely that I got them from a
22	defense attorney asking me about them. I don't
23	know. It's been a long time.
24	Q. Okay. That's fair. You don't
25	recall. But you did not go out and find the
1	Florida Health Notes as part of your general
2	research on the public's perceptions of the
3	health risks of cigarette-smoking, right?
4	A. That's right.
5	Q. Whether it was Mr. Acosta or another
6	defense lawyer, these were given to you during
7	the course litigation, right?
8	A. That's correct, yes.
9	Q. You've been given materials by --
10	let me rephrase. I'm getting tired.
11	Over the course of time since you've
12	gotten involved in litigation, serving as an
13	expert witness, you have over the course of time
14	been provided with materials from plaintiffs
15	counsel, correct?
16	A. People have sent me stuff, yes.
17	Often, they just send me things in the mail. I
18	don't request them. My reliance materials that
19	I've supplied to you are all things I have
20	acquired myself in the course of my own research.
21	Q. Identify for me the names of
22	plaintiffs lawyers who have provided you with
23	information of historical nature.
24	A. Back in -- when I began this, I was
25	supplied a large box of what were the Minnesota
1	Blue Cross/Blue Shield v. Philip Morris trial
2	exhibits in a large box. I was given those.
3	They were supplied to me by a plaintiffs
4	attorney by the name of Louis Fondren. This was
5	back in 1998, and he asked me to review those
6	documents and I did review those documents. In
7	the Boemer v. Brown & Williamson trial in 2000,
8	I was asked as a explicit part of my role to
9	review materials that had been part of the
10	defense reliance set. And, so, I reviewed these
11	materials that were supplied to me.
12	Q. And, so, the plaintiffs counsel in
13	the Boemer case gave those to you?
14	A. Right. They said these are defense
15	exhibits, would you review these for us, and I
16	did.
17	Q. You've participated in trials as an
18	expert for Mr. Acosta going back to probably
19	2000, right?
20	A. No. I met --1 met Howard Acosta in
21	the fall of 2002.
22	Q. That's what I said. You've been
23	working with him since 2002?
24	A. I have worked with him, I think, in
25	four cases.
1	Q. But since 2002, right?
2	A. Yeah.
3	Q. And over the course of time, in
4	connection with the different cases you've worked
5	on with Mr. Acosta, he's provided you with
6	information that he's obtained in the course of
7	litigation, correct?
8	A. Has he given me stuff? Mostly, the
9	other way around. You know, all of his New York
10	Times came from me, as far as I know. I mean,
11	I've given him all of this stuff that I've put
12	together. Here and there. We did, Howard and I,
13	do some early on together -- do some film clips,
14	editing down some movies. We did that together.
15	Q. And these are film clips that you've
16	shown in several trials with him?
17	A. That's right.
18	Q. And the two of you kind of work
19	together to edit the video clips and create them
20	so that you and he -- so that they would be
21	presentable to a jury, correct?
22	A. That's right, and they show all the
23	professional polish of the home video effort.
24	Q. He provided you with some of your --
25	well, let me rephrase.
1	When you first started looking at
2	polls and polling data relating to smoking and
3	health, he provided the first set of materials
4	you had on that, right?
5	A. No, not on the polls.
6	Q. You got those from Louis Fondren in
7	1998 or from the plaintiffs counsel in the
8	Boemer case?
9	A. No. The polls that I got, I got
10	from the Roper Center. I put them together. I
11	wrote up a little report, which I sent to Woody
12	Wilner. That was, like, the first round of poll
13	research.
14	Q. When did you send a report to Woody
15	Wilner about the polling data?
16	A. Around 2002, somewhere around then.
17	I met with them down -- I've testified to this in
18	the past. I met with them in Jacksonville at the
19	law offices of Woody Wilner's law firm.
20	Q. Was this for a particular case?
21	A. It was for the Levine case.
22	Q. Which you mentioned earlier?
23	A. And the Boemer -- Boemer v. Brown
24	& Williamson case, and then Howard Acosta had a
25	case called Eastman v. Philip Morris that he was
237
1	putting up, and two of those went to trial in the
2	spring of 2003. So, that's what the meeting was
3	about.
4	Q. Okay. On your set of reliance
5	materials, within the folder on polling
6	information, there are some Excel spreadsheets
7	and some documents that look like you or somebody
8	else created that represent some sort of analysis
9	of some of the polls. Do you know what I'm
10	referring to?
11	A. Would you be referring to graphs?
12	Q. Yes.
13	A. The graphs that I created?
14	Q. Yes.
15	A. I supplied that with the underlying
16	spreadsheets if you guys want to -- those are
17	mine.
18	Q. I don't want to take them out.
19	MR. SCHULTZ:
20	I want to be sure we're
21	talking about the same thing.
22	A. I'll tell you. I've created my own
23	graphs.
24	EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:
25	Q. I might make this request, is that
238
1	if you go back to that folder and if you could
2	identify for me documents that present your work,
3	for example, things you created as opposed to
4	either the polls themselves or the underlying
5	data.
6	A. I can answer that question right
7	now.
8	Q. Okay. Go ahead.
9	A. If it is a Excel spreadsheet with
10	a chart that's either in PowerPoint or a PDF of a
11	PowerPoint -- you know, you can save PowerPoints
12	to PDF -- that includes bar graphs and line
13	graphs, those are mine. I created those --
14	Q. Okay.
15	A. --completely, 100 percent myself.
16	Q. Maybe I'll make this request on the
17	record rather than belabor the point here. If in
18	going through any of that stuff we have any
19	question about whether it's your work or whether
20	it was something you downloaded, we may ask Mr.
21	Schultz to have you clarify that for us.
22	MR. SCHULTZ:
23	That's not a problem --
24	A. Absolutely. Yeah.
25	MR. SCHULTZ:
239
1	-- within reason.
2	A. Yeah. You know, we could, at the
3	end of today, if there's time, I can open up my
4	file, as we did at lunchtime, and I can go
5	through it quickly with you.
6	MR. GERAGHTY:
7	If Mr. Koethe wants you to
8	do that, you can. Okay.
9	You know, I am -- here's
10	what I'd like to do. If I have
11	any questions left, which I may
12	not have any, I'm going to go
13	through my notes and I won't have
14	any more than five or ten minutes.
15	MR. SCHULTZ:
16	Sure.
17	MR. GERAGHTY:
18	To move things along, I'm
19	prepared to switch seats with Mr.
20	Koethe.
21	(Whereupon, a discussion was
22	held off the record.)
23	MR. KOETHE:
24	Let's go on the record.
25	MR. SCHULTZ:
240
1	Let me just mention, it
2	sounds like Mr. Koethe has
3	questions that are case-specific
4	questions to Hargroves, which is
5	Howard Acosta's case in the
6	Hillsborough set of Engle progeny
7	cases. It sounds as if at least a
8	portion of the questioning is not
9	going to be generic, which is what
10	Dr. Kyriakoudes has been called
11	here to today to testify to, and
12	this would not be all-case,
13	generic testimony in the Escambia
14	and Hillsborough County, but in an
15	effort to accommodate Mr. Koethe
16	and Howard Acosta, we're going to
17	take the testimony and we will
18	just sort this out after we get
19	the transcript and do our best to
20	clear up the mess.
21	MR. KOETHE:
22	For the record, I want to
23	note that we did attempt to get a
24	date for Dr. Kyriakoudes's
25	deposition in the Hargroves case
241
1	and Mr. Acosta indicated that no
2	such date would be provided and
3	that we needed to do our
4	deposition today in the generic
5	Hillsborough County cases. So, I
6	think we will have to resolve this
7	as we go down. Let's try to get
8	through the questioning. It's not
9	too extensive.
10	EXAMINATION BY MR. KOETHE:
11	Q. Professor, I showed you what had
12	been marked as Exhibit 5, which is the disclosure
13	that was provided to the defendants in the
14	Hargroves case, and you had a chance during the
15	break to read that?
16	(Whereupon, Deposition
17	Exhibit Number 5 was marked for
18	identification.)
19	A. I did.
20	EXAMINATION BY MR. KOETHE:
21	Q. And have you seen that disclosure
22	before today?
23	A. I have not seen this particular
24	disclosure, no.
25	Q. If you notice, in the second
242
1	sentence, it states that you have not reviewed
2	case-specific materials, but will testify
3	generally on the subject of tobacco and cigarette
4	history. You see that?
5	A. I see that.
6	Q. And is it a true statement that you
7	have not reviewed case-specific materials by that
8	specific to the Hargroves case?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. Have you seen this disclosure
11	before?
12	A. No, I haven't seen this particular
13	disclosure.
14	Q. And I take it, is it fair to say
15	that you have not received any Hargroves-specific
16	case materials?
17	A. That's true.
18	Q. Have you done any specific work on
19	the Hargroves case to date?
20	A. I have not.
21	Q. And does Exhibit 5 represent a
22	complete and accurate description of the opinions
23	you would expect to give in the Hargroves case?
24	A. It does.
25	Q. And I notice that it makes reference
243
1	down at the bottom of the page to the Eastman
2	case and the Amitz case. You see that?
3	A. I do.
4	Q. Are there any specific opinions from
5	Eastman or Amitz that you would expect to give
6	in Hargroves that aren't already identified in
7	the preceding bulk of the paragraph there?
8	A. The only -- the only thing I can
9	envision would be, if asked, about kind of
10	possible hypothetical alternative scenarios in
11	temis of industry behavior.
12	Q. And what do you mean by that?
13	A. Oh, say, for example, if I was asked
14	the question, Dr. Kyriakoudes, if -- if the
15	tobacco industry had in 1954 come out and said
16	that we have reason to believe that cigarettes
17	cause cancer, that our research indicates that
18	there is an item of serious concern, we're going
19	to, say, put on a warning, a voluntary warning on
20	our pack of cigarettes, what would have been the
21	effect on public knowledge, in a hypothetical.
22	Q. Okay. And did you give such
23	testimony in Eastman or Amitz?
24	A. I don't believe I was asked that,
25	but I have been asked that in other cases.
244
1	Q. So, other than that question, can
2	you identify for me today any other opinions that
3	you might be giving in Hargroves that aren't
4	encompassed by what's in Exhibit 5?
5	A. No. There would be nothing else.
6	It's complete.
7	Q. And, very briefly, how would you
8	answer that hypothetical question?
9	A. I would answer it by saying that if
10	we took that to be the case, the sharp downward
11	shift in cigarette count consumption that began
12	really as a trend in the early 1970s may have
13	happened at an earlier period and, if so, that
14	would have had a significant impact on, one,
15	public knowledge, or would have been indicative
16	of a significant change in public knowledge. It
17	would have had a significant impact on cigarette -
18	related mortality.
19	Q. And that area of testimony gets into
20	what we've talked about before as counterfactual
21	testimony?
22	A. That's right.
23	Q. And that involves a level of
24	speculation as to what might have happened if
25	something different occurred at some point in
245
1	time; is that right?
2	A. That's quite right.
3	Q. So, you have to qualify any
4	testimony you might give on such a matter because
5	the facts are such that that's not what happened
6	in 1954, right?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. And it would involve speculation on
9	your part as to what would have been different
10	had different facts occurred in history, correct?
11	A. That's correct.
12	Q. As to the Hargroves case, do you
13	know the name of the smoker in that case?
14	A. I'm not familiar with any of the
15	specific materials on this case. I came prepared
16	for this deposition today, prepared to give
17	generic testimony. So, I'm not familiar with
18	this -- particulars of this case, but that
19	doesn't mean I might not later make myself
20	familiar.
21	Q. I won't go through the whole list,
22	but I do have a few follow-up questions.
23	A. Yeah. Sure.
24	Q. So, you don't know whether the
25	smoker in Hargroves was a male or female?
246
1	A. At this point in time, no.
2	Q. Or whether that person is alive or
3	deceased?
4	A. I don't know that.
5	Q. Don't know when or where the person,
6	the smoker, was bom?
7	A. Do not know that.
8	Q. Would it be fair to say that just as
9	you testified earlier today as to the broad group
10	of Hillsborough and Escambia cases, you're not in
11	a position to testify about when or why Mrs.
12	Hargroves started smoking?
13	A. That is correct.
14	Q. You don't know whether her parents
15	or siblings smoked?
16	A. I don't know that.
17	Q. You don't know what magazines or
18	newspapers Mrs. Hargroves read during her life?
19	A. I don't know that.
20	Q. Have you done any research in the
21	Lakeland, Florida, newspaper?
22	A. I have not.
23	Q. Do you know what the name of the
24	Lakeland, Florida, newspaper is?
25	A. I don't.
247
1	Q. Have you ever been to Lakeland,
2	Florida?
3	A. I believe I've passed through on my
4	way to Gainesville.
5	Q. Never done any tobacco-related
6	research in Lakeland, Florida?
7	A. No.
8	Q. Have you ever been to Plant City,
9	Florida?
10	A. No, I've never been there.
11	Q. Do you know if Plant City has a
12	newspaper?
13	A. I don't know.
14	Q. I think you testified earlier today
15	that with respect to the Hillsborough and
16	Escambia County cases, you don't know what
17	information any specific smoker would have
18	received about the dangers of smoking; is that
19	fair?
20	A. I'm sorry?
21	Q. As to the Escambia and Hillsborough
22	County cases, you don't know what information any
23	specific smoker received about the dangers of
24	smoking.
25	A. That's right. That would be
248
1	consistent with my earlier responses.
2	Q. And that would be true for Mrs.
3	Hargroves as well?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. I think you said earlier today that
6	you didn't know the specific sources from which
7	any particular smoker would have received
8	information about the dangers of smoking in the
9	Hillsborough and Escambia County cases.
10	A. That's fair.
11	Q. Is that a fair representation of
12	your testimony?
13	A. Yes, that's correct.
14	Q. And the same would be true for Mrs.
15	Hargroves?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. And you're not able to opine on how
18	well informed Mrs. Hargroves was about the
19	dangers of smoking?
20	A. No, I'm not.
21	Q. And would it be true that you're not
22	in a position to opine upon how well informed any
23	particular smoker would have been about the
24	dangers of smoking in the Hillsborough and
25	Escambia County cases?
249
1	A. Right. Talking about groups.
2	Q. And you don't know, do you, what
3	Mrs. Hargroves specifically believed about the
4	dangers of smoking?
5	A. No, I don't.
6	Q. Would it be true that as to the
7	individual smokers in the Escambia and
8	Hillsborough County cases, you don't know what
9	those individual smokers believed about the
10	dangers of smoking?
11	A. That's correct.
12	Q. And you don't know whether or not
13	those individual smokers would have read or heard
14	any specific tobacco company statements?
15	A. As individuals, no.
16	Q. Okay. And the same would be true
17	for Mrs. Hargroves, I take it?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. You're not aware of whether she
20	heard or read any specific tobacco company
21	statements about the dangers of smoking?
22	A. That's right.
23	Q. And, likewise, you don't know
24	whether Mrs. Hargroves relied upon any tobacco
25	company statements in making the decision she
250
1	made about smoking?
2	A. Her as an individual, no.
3	Q. Would it be fair to say that as to
4	the plaintiffs in the Escambia and Hillsborough
5	County cases, you're not able to testify about
6	whether any tobacco company statements influenced
7	any individual smoker's smoking decisions in
8	those cases either?
9	A. One more time, just repeat that.
10	I'm sorry.
11	Q. Okay. Do you know whether any
12	tobacco company statements would have influenced
13	any individual smoker in the Hillsborough and
14	Escambia County cases?
15	A. No, not as individuals.
16	Q. Just to clarify an earlier line of
17	questions, are there any cases in Hillsborough or
18	Escambia County where you have actually done
19	specific research relating to the smoker in one
20	of those cases?
21	MR. SCHULTZ:
22	Asked and answered.
23	A. No.
24	EXAMINATION BY MR. KOETHE:
25	Q. You talked earlier about polling
1	data. You talked quite a bit about polling data,
2	correct?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And you've reviewed a number of
5	Roper or Gallup polls and, I guess, some Roper
6	polls.
7	A. Among others, yes.
8	Q. Typically, would it be fair to say
9	that many of these polls dealt with, you know,
10	groups of maybe 500 or 1,500 respondents who were
11	asked questions?
12	A. Yeah. Their sample sizes in terms
13	of the N, number of cases, runs between 12 and
14	15, typically.
15	Q. Twelve to --
16	A. Twelve and 1,500, yes.
17	Q. Is it your view that the polls on
18	your reliance list from Gallup and Roper and
19	Harris are generalizable to the population at
20	large?
21	A. Yes. Those are nationally
22	representative samples, and they're
23	generalizable.
24	Q. Would you agree with me that based
25	on the polling research that you've looked at,
1	that in the 1960s, there were millions of smokers
2	in America who were aware that smoking could
3	cause lung cancer?
4	A. Well, let me be just a little bit
5	more precise. Certainly, a portion of, you
6	know --just based on the polling data, a portion
7	of smokers responded affirmatively that smoking
8	was one of the causes of lung cancer.
9	Significant numbers responded, you know,
10	otherwise, but, yes, there were always
11	significant numbers of smokers among and, as
12	well, the general population.
13	Q. You would agree that in the 1960s,
14	millions of American smokers believed that
15	smoking was a cause of lung cancer.
16	A. Yes, based on the polling data.
17	Yes. Millions didn't, but millions did, yes.
18	Q. Millions of smokers did believe that
19	smoking was a cause of lung cancer in the 1960s?
20	MR. SCHULTZ:
21	Asked and answered.
22	A. Was one of the causes of lung
23	cancer, yes.
24	EXAMINATION BY MR. KOETHE:
25	Q. And this would be true in the 1970s
1	as well?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And in the 1980s?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. And would you agree that in the
6	1950s, there were millions of smokers who
7	believed that smoking was one of the causes of
8	lung cancer?
9	A. Yeah. Let me just make sure I get
10	this right. We're running about approximately 60
11	million smokers at that time. I'm just going to
12	do a little mental math. Among smokers
13	responding affirmatively -- yeah.
14	Q. So, even in the 1950s, there would
15	have been millions of smokers in America who did
16	believe that smoking was a cause of lung cancer.
17	A. Well, who responded to the polls
18	affirmatively saying that smoking is one of the
19	causes of lung cancer.
20	Q. And is it your opinion that they
21	were responding truthfully to those polls?
22	A. Yes. I mean, I generally accept
23	that. People, when this --1 mean, there are
24	exceptions.
254
1	would have been at least millions of smokers in
2	the U.S. in the 1950s who had already come to the
3	view that smoking was a cause of lung cancer?
4	MR. SCHULTZ:
5	Asked and answered.
6	A. Yes, one of the causes, yes.
7	EXAMINATION BY MR. KOETHE:
8	Q. And is it fair to say that with
9	respect to the group of smokers in the
10	Hillsborough and Escambia County cases, you're
11	not able to put any individual smoker into one
12	group or the other as to whether that smoker
13	believed it was a cause or that smoker had not
14	yet come to believe smoking was a cause of lung
15	cancer?
16	A. That's right. I don't intend to
17	sort individuals that way.
18	Q. You talked a little bit today about
19	some of the different sources of information that
20	smokers may have received information about on
21	the dangers of smoking. Do you recall that?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. I think family members was one of
24	those areas that Mr. Geraghty asked you about; is
25	that right?
255
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. When a smoker has a family member
3	who dies of cancer from smoking, would you agree
4	that that sends a strong message to the smoker
5	that smoking can be harmful to health?
6	MR. SCHULTZ:
7	Object to the form.
8	MR. WATSON:
9	Join.
10	A. Well, it just depends. I mean, when
11	this happens, you know, what the circumstances
12	are, it may or may not. You know, people die
13	of -- to give you a hypothetical scenario --
14	EXAMINATION BY MR. KOETHE:
15	Q. Well, sure.
16	A. No. No. That's okay. You go.
17	Q. Tell me what you think that depends
18	on, I guess, that might be part of what you were
19	going to start to do.
20	A. Yeah. In a hypothetical situation,
21	someone dying of a lung cancer death in the
22	mid-'50s, whether the doctors attributed that to
23	smoking or not, it just depends what the
24	perception of the death is.
25	Q. And, actually, I didn't build a time
256
1	period into my question. You mentioned the
2	1950s. So, time period would be a factor that
3	you would consider? I mean, let's say the person
4	died in the 1990s from lung cancer from smoking.
5	That might result in a different view, in your
6	mind, than if the person died in the 1950s?
7	A. Yes, that's different.
8	Q. Time would be a factor, and the
9	second thing you mentioned was whether or not the
10	death was attributed to smoking.
11	A. That's right.
12	Q. Any other factors that you think you
13	would need to know before you could answer that
14	question?
15	A. I guess the consanguinity, the
16	degree of closeness of the relative, might be a
17	factor: Just a relative, close relative, whether
18	the person was physically located --
19	Q. Sorry?
20	A. Physical location. Seems to me,
21	just on the surface of it, if you -- one observes
22	a death up close and, you know --1 mean, in your
23	home, a close relative, that's different than a
24	distant cousin, something like that, might have a
25	less -- less of an impact.
257
1	Q. Anything else?
2	A. Those are the things that come to
3	the top of my head.
4	Q. Okay. So, if, in fact, a smoker had
5	a close family member, spouse, parent, who died
6	of cancer that the family attributed to smoking,
7	do you agree that that would send a strong
8	message to the smoker that smoking can be
9	harmful?
10	A. Yes.
11	MR. SCHULTZ:
12	Object to form.
13	EXAMINATION BY MR. KOETHE:
14	Q. Let's say a smoker has a close
15	family member, spouse, parent -- would you
16	consider a brother or sister a close family
17	member?
18	A. Yes. Any of their family members,
19	sure.
20	Q. So, if a smoker had a close family
21	member who suffered a heart attack that the
22	family attributed to smoking, would you agree
23	that that sends a strong message to the smoker
24	that smoking can be harmful?
25	MR. SCHULTZ:
258
1	Object to the form.
2	A. Yes. Yes, that's a message.
3	EXAMINATION BY MR. KOETHE:
4	Q. How about if a smoker has a child or
5	other close family member who urges that smoker
6	to quit because smoking might be harmful to them,
7	do you think that sends a strong message to the
8	smoker that smoking can be harmful?
9	MR. SCHULTZ:
10	Object to the form.
11	A. That's also a message. I mean,
12	here, you're dealing with addiction, and one of
13	the -- we know from just basic research that most
14	people who smoke would rather not smoke and
15	overcoming that addiction is incredibly
16	difficult, and part of the shame of smoking these
17	days is when you get messages from your kids who
18	come home with health education and apply that to
19	their parents. It's one of the tragedies of this
20	product and part of the harm that it inflicts on
21	families.
22	MR. KOETHE:
23	Move to strike.
24	EXAMINATION BY MR. KOETHE:
25	Q. I think you testified that you're
259
1	really not qualified to testify about the
2	difficulty that any particular smoker might
3	experience in quitting, right?
4	A. Well, yes, and I'm -- that answer
5	was dealing with in a general case. What I said
6	in terms of the individuals is I'm not going to
7	offer an individualized diagnosis.
8	Q. I guess my question didn't go to
9	addiction, so, let me try to rephrase it. The
10	question was whether or not if a smoker has a
11	child or close family member who urges that
12	person to quit smoking because of the health
13	dangers of smoking, would you agree that that
14	sends a strong message to the smoker that smoking
15	can be harmful?
16	A. Yes.
17	MR. SCHULTZ:
18	Object to the form.
19	EXAMINATION BY MR. KOETHE:
20	Q. Couple of additional questions on
21	the Hargroves matter. Do you know what injury is
22	being alleged in the Hargroves case?
23	A. I'm not familiar with the specifics
24	of the case.
25	Q. You are not aware what brands of
260
1	cigarettes Mrs. Hargroves smoked?
2	A. I'm not familiar with that.
3	Q. I want to clarify something about
4	the research you did in the Chicago newspaper
5	that was mentioned earlier, and I guess it was
6	the Daily Times.
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. I thought we talked about this at
9	the last deposition, but it got a bit confused in
10	my mind. The Chicago Daily Times is not a paper
11	that you've done a systematic review of, is it,
12	in terms of trying to locate stories on the
13	dangers of cigarette-smoking?
14	A. That's correct. I have just a small
15	number of stories in there.
16	Q. And those articles were included in
17	the disks that you provided to us?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. And, I think, from my looking at it,
20	they related to early part of the 20th century, I
21	think; is that right?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. And is it correct that that research
24	involved some of the cultural aspects, ashtrays
25	and things of that nature?
261
1	A. That's correct. Yes, you've got it.
2	Q. And that's not a paper that you
3	looked at to assess what information was being
4	communicated to the public about the health
5	dangers of smoking?
6	A. Right, that's correct, and, again, I
7	don't think the citations in that paper go beyond
8	the 1920s.
9	Q. You talked earlier about an R. J.
10	Reynolds document that was a --1 think you
11	called it a qualitative summary concerning
12	perceptions of addiction and habituation.
13	A. That's right.
14	Q. And Mr. Geraghty asked if you'd be
15	able to identify that for us, and I want to
16	reiterate that request, but I thought I would try
17	to see if we can figure out, is that a document
18	that would be on the disks that you provided?
19	A. Yes. It's probably -- if it's not
20	on the disks, it's --1 believe the citation is
21	in that list of long citations that I included
22	with that -- there should have been a WordPerfect
23	file called Reliance List. You know, I don't
24	save everything in a PDF form. Some things, I
25	just have the citation for.
262
1	Q. And tell me again, to the best of
2	your recollection, the time frame of that
3	document.
4	A. '90s. Early '90s.
5	Q. We'll see if we can find it. If
6	not, you have no objection to pinpointing it for
7	us?
8	A. In fact, I will, before you even
9	ask, I will send an e-mail to Mr. Schultz when I
10	get back to my office and he can forward that and
11	I'll include the citation from the Legacy
12	database.
13	Q. Okay. We appreciate that.
14	A. Glad to do it.
15	MR. KOETHE:
16	I'd like to take a very
17	short break.
18	MR. SCHULTZ:
19	Before we go off the record,
20	I think that was -- with the
21	exception of perhaps the last
22	dozen questions, that was all
23	Hargroves case-specific, just for
24	future reference when we're trying
25	to sort this out.
263
1	MR. KOETHE:
2	Okay. And I guess I'll
3	defer on either agreeing or
4	disagreeing with that for the
5	moment.
6	MR. GERAGHTY:
7	I think you've been very
8	clear, Matt, but I just wanted to
9	make sure it was on the record
10	because somebody asked me to do
11	this, not anybody here, but the
12	intention for the December 9th and
13	10th is that this will be
14	completely generic and there will
15	be no discussion of any particular
16	plaintiff. Obviously, Dr.
17	Kyriakoudes has testified at
18	length today that he wouldn't even
19	be prepared to talk about any
20	particular plaintiff. I want to
21	make sure that's our
22	understanding.
23	MR. SCHULTZ:
24	That's correct, on direct
25	and on cross, yes.
264
1	(Whereupon, a discussion was
2	held off the record.)
3	MR. KOETHE:
4	I have no further questions
5	at this time, and I would just, I
6	think, like to reserve our right
7	with respect to the Hargroves case
8	if there is going to be any
9	further research that Dr.
10	Kyriakoudes does or that might
11	somehow put him into the bailiwick
12	of offering something other than
13	completely generic testimony, and
14	we'll have to resolve that down
15	the road, but I want to reserve
16	the right to do that.
17	MR. SCHULTZ:
18	Sure, and that's Howard
19	Acosta's fight to fight.
20	MR. GERAGHTY:
21	I have no further questions.
22	The only thing I wanted to --
23	obviously, I preserved the
24	objections at the outset to the
25	cross-noticing and whatnot and,
265
1	obviously, saying that I've
2	completed my questions for today
3	doesn't, you know, waive those
4	objections, from my perspective.
5	MR. SCHULTZ:
6	Okay. And we've responded
7	to those early on.
8	THE WITNESS:
9	In the --
10	MR. GERAGHTY:
11	This doesn't need to be on
12	the record, I don't think.
13	(Whereupon, a discussion was
14	held off the record.)
15	THE WITNESS:
16	I supplied to Mr. Paul
17	Koethe and to Mr. Geraghty in
18	September at the Sherman, Hess
19	deposition two folders
20	approximately two inches thick
21	each of select Hill & Knowlton
22	documents which I acquired through
23	direct research at the University
24	of Wisconsin archives, and those
25	would be included as part of my
266
1	reliance documents.
2	MR. KOETHE:
3	I guess I would just say
4	that to the extent that those are
5	not included in the materials that
6	were provided for today's
7	deposition, we would reserve our
8	right to object to those.
9	MR. GERAGHTY:
10	And I would join in that
11	objection as well.
12	MR. ROSENSTEIN:
13	And I join in it as well.
14	(Whereupon, the testimony of
15	the witness was concluded at 3:41
16	p.m.)
