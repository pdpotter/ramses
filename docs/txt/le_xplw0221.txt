1	SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA, THURSDAY, AUGUST 7, 2014
2	9:53 A.M.
4	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Okay. Good morning. My name

9	Diego, California. The caption of this case is Sherri
10	Hubbird, et al., versus R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company,
11	in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in
12	and for Miami-Dade County, Florida, Case No.
13	12-18904-CA-42. The witness today is Elizabeth Cobbs
14	Hoffman, Ph.D.
15	At this time would all attorneys present please
16	identify themselves and whom they represent.
17	MR. KAISER: Allan Kaiser on behalf of the
18	plaintiff. The sound is very bad. I could not hear
19	anyone.
20	MR. DAVIS: Todd Davis on behalf of R.J.
21	Reynolds Tobacco Company.
22	Allan, is that better? Can you hear us?
23	MR. KAISER: I hear you, but I didn't hear
24	the -- the first speaker hardly at all, and my head's
25	like right near the phone.
7
1	MR. DAVIS: Yeah. It's the videographer. He's
2	a little bit away from the phone. I don't think he's
3	going to be speaking. So if you have a problem anytime
4	either with me asking -- hearing me ask questions or
5	Dr. Hoffman answering, will you let us know?
6	MR. KAISER: I will. And also, are you going to
7	put on the record our agreement, at least from Dr.
8	Proctor's depo, that it's going to apply here about form
9	and waiving and preserving all of the other objections?
10	MR. DAVIS: Yes. I was getting ready to do
11	that. And I can do that right now before the witness
12	is -- is sworn.
13	To facilitate the deposition, the parties have
14	agreed to reserve all objections, except as to the form
15	of the question or the responsiveness of the answer,
16	until the parties have designated testimony from this
17	deposition to be presented at trial. No substantive
18	objections to the testimony today, including those
19	relating to the issues raised in the parties' motions in
20	limines (sic) are waived, by agreement of the parties.
21	The parties also have agreed that no objections other
22	than to the form of the question or the responsiveness
23	of the answer are waived if not made during the
24	deposition. These objections that are not waived
25	include objections relating to relevance, prejudice,
8
1	hearsay, due process, preemption, privilege, foundation,
2	speculation, improper bolstering, any objection based
3	upon a party's constitutional rights, or any objection
4	to evidence that is not proper expert testimony. All
5	objections other than to form of the question, and the
6	responsiveness of the -- of the answer are specifically
7	preserved by this agreement.
8	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Thank you.
9	Would -- would our court reporter please swear
10	in the witness.
11
12	ELIZABETH COBBS HOFFMAN, Ph.D.,
13	having been first duly sworn, testified as follows:

15	EXAMINATION
16	BY MR. DAVIS:
17	Q. Good morning.
18	A. Good morning.
19	Q. Will you please in yourself -- introduce
20	yourself to the jury and tell us what you do for a
21	living.
22	A. My name is Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman. I'm a
23	professional historian and also a university professor.
24	Q. How long have you been teaching history?
25	A. I've been teaching history at the university
9
1	level for 25 years.
2	Q. Do you hold a special position in the history
3	department where you teach?
4	A. Yes, I do.
5	Q. And you are -- you teach at San Diego State
6	University?
7	A. That's right. I'm a professor at San Diego
8	State University, where I hold what's called an endowed
9	chair. So I teach as well as do research.
10	Q. Is that what it means to have an endowed chair
11	at the Univers— at the -- San Diego State University?
12	A. Well, a chair is -- can be used in two senses of
13	the word. A chair in a -- in a -- in a history
14	department or any university department can mean the
15	administrative head of the department, and that's a
16	position that's rotated. And that person takes care of
17	the administration. But it's also possible, and this is
18	much rarer, to have a -- an endowed chair, and that is a
19	permanent position.
20	Q. What fellowships were you awarded for your work
21	for the upcoming year?
22	A. Well, this particular year I was awarded a
23	fellowship at Stanford University in the Hoover
24	Institution, which is a -- a think tank, so to speak,
25	and that's to do research.
10
1	Q. Can you briefly tell us what you're here to talk
2	about today?
3	A. Yes. I'm here to talk about my research on the
4	question of what information was available to Daniel
5	(sic) Ellsworth during his lifetime, and other members
6	of his generation, about the hazards of smoking,
7	including lung addiction and -- pardon me -- lung cancer
8	and addiction.
9	Q. And when you say "Mr. Ellsworth," are you
10	talking about David Ellsworth?
11	A. Yes, I'm speaking of David Ellsworth.
12	Q. And did the research -- did you research the way
13	in which information was commuted to -- communicated to
14	the public during Mr. Ellsworth's lifetime about the
15	dangers of cigarette smoking?
16	A. Yes. I was looking at information that was
17	communicated to Mr. David Ellsworth as well as his older
18	brothers, his children, and to the general public
19	throughout his lifetime, with emphasis, of course, on
20	the places he lived; namely, Rhode Island, primarily,
21	and also Florida.
22	Q. Did your research include the ways in which
23	information was communicated to the public during David
24	Ellsworth's lifetime about both the risk of lung cancer
25	and the addictiveness of cigarettes?
11
1	A. Yes. I looked at information on the hazards of
2	smoking, primarily lung cancer and addiction, but other
3	hazards as well.
4	Q. Is the topic -- and -- and so I think -- is the
5	topic of public attitudes and -- and awareness something
6	you have studied in other historical work?
7	A. Yes. It's -- it's pretty common for historians
8	looking at the past to examine public attitudes and
9	knowledge about a wide variety of things. So, for
10	example, I did a book on the history of the Peace Corps,
11	and I looked at the prevalence of information about the
12	Peace Corps and -- and how many Americans had heard of
13	it and had joined it and things like that.
14	Q. Before we discuss the opinions you have reached
15	in this case, I want to spend a few minutes on your
16	credentials and experience that you bring to the issues
17	that you analyzed for this case.
18	Professor Hoffman, can you tell us about whether
19	you have a master's degree or a Ph.D. in the field of
20	history and when you received those?
21	A. Yes. I have both a master's degree and a Ph.D.
22	in history. I received those, the master's degree, in
23	1984 and the Ph.D. in 1988 from Stanford University.
24	Q. Since 1988 have you been practicing and teaching
25	as a professional historian?
12
1	A. Yes. I've been continuously employed as a
2	professional historian, which meant teaching students,
3	of course, many generations of college students, as well
4	as doing professional research, which is a part of the
5	job of a professional historian, in some -- especially
6	someone who obtains something like an endowed chair,
7	where that enables you to spend extra time doing
8	research, and it's a -- it's a very honorary position.
9	In my university, for example, there are three of us
10	amongst hundreds of professors who have endowed chairs.
11	Q. As part of your duties as San Diego State
12	Univer— do you teach courses on the history of the
13	United States?
14	A. Yes. I've taught history -- classes on history
15	of the United States for all 25 years, from the founding
16	of the first colonies at Jamestown in -- in Plymouth,
17	Massachusetts, up to the present. I've taught other
18	subjects more specialized than the general survey as
19	well. For example, a class I teach very frequently is
20	called "historical methods." And I'm, in fact, teaching
21	that this -- this coming semester.
22	Q. And we're going to talk about the historical
23	method shortly. But have you taught courses in which
24	the history of tobacco and cigarette use have been part
25	of the class?
13
1	A. Yes, I have.
2	Q. Can you describe that for us, please?
3	A. Well, for example, I teach a class on the
4	history of the 1960s. And when you talk about the
5	history of the 1960s, one of the things you'll talk
6	about is the Surgeon General's report but also the
7	decline of cigarette smoking and the rise of marijuana
8	smoking and people's understanding of the hazards but
9	also risk taking in relation to drug use. So it's a
10	topic that naturally winds into a variety of topics in
11	American history, going back to the revolution.
12	Q. In addition to teaching U.S. history courses,
13	have you held other positions of responsibility at the
14	university level?
15	A. Yes, I have.
16	Q. What have those been?
17	A. Well, in my own university I've been chair of
18	the history department, acting chair at one point. I
19	previously was at another university, where I was the
20	chair of the history department before I got the endowed
21	chair, and also head of the honors program and -- and
22	such things, various kinds of jobs.
23	Q. Have you written books in the field of history?
24	A. Yes, I have.
25	Q. Can you tell us several examples of the books
14
1	that you've written?
2	A. Sure. I've written -- mostly I've written what
3	we call monographs. Those are original works of
4	history, which are very in-depth research on particular
5	topics. I mentioned the Peace Corps. I've written
6	about -- I've written about the American Civil War.
7	I've written about modem American foreign relations,
8	U.S. relations with the world. I also have a textbook
9	on American history that's an edited collection of
10	works.
11	Q. Have you written any scholar— scholarly
12	articles or essays in the field of history?
13	A. Yes. I've written quite a number of scholarly
14	essays as well.
15	Q. Have you written book reviews as part of -- of
16	the scholarly work that you've done?
17	A. Yes. I've written both scholarly book reviews
18	on -- in -- in scholarly journals. I've also written a
19	number of reviews for magazines and newspapers in
20	Britain, also here in the United States. I've written
21	for the New York Times. I've written for the Los
22	Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Jerusalem Post.
23	Q. Have the historical articles that you've
24	written, have those been published in peer review
25	journals?
15
1	A. Yes. The scholarly articles I've written have
2	been published in -- in peer review journals.
3	Q. And when we say that it's -- something is peer
4	reviewed, can you explain that to the jury?
5	A. Yes. A peer review is where an article or a
6	book will be reviewed by a -- a group of scholars. It's
7	usually sent out, so two or three people, depending on
8	the -- the journal. Other scholars will read it and
9	give a kind of -- usually it's a thumbs up or a thumbs
10	down on -- on the piece and if meets professional
11	scholarly requirements. And as I said, all of my
12	scholarly articles have been submitted to peer review.
13	Sometimes I write for other kinds of publications, which
14	are not peer reviewed.
15	Q. Have you served as someone who is a peer
16	reviewer, that is, somebody who has looked at the
17	scholarly work of other historians and provided comments
18	on the -- about the -- about the -- the quality of the
19	work and whether it's worthy of publication?
20	A. Yes. I've been a peer reviewer for at least two
21	decades. Just last month I --1 peer reviewed an
22	article for a scholarly journal.
23	Q. Have you served as a reviewer for the Pulitzer
24	Prize in History?
25	A. Yes. A couple of years ago, I was asked to
16
1	serve on the three-person jury for the Pulitzer Prize in
2	History, which was a great honor and required reviewing
3	all the books which were being nominated for the
4	Pulitzer Prize.
5	Q. Have you serve on the editorial board for the
6	Encyclopedia of American Foreign Relations?
7	A. Yes. I've served on a couple of different --
8	well, certainly that encyclopedia board, as well as a
9	Journal of Americ— of World History as well.
10	Q. With respect to professional organizations and
11	awards that you have had over the course of your career,
12	I want to spend a few minutes on those.
13	Do you belong to any groups or organizations in
14	the field of history?
15	A. Yes. Like most professional historians, I
16	belong to several professional organizations, such as
17	the American Historical Organi— pardon me -- American
18	Historical Association, which is the oldest, as well as
19	the Organization of American Historians and -- and
20	several others.
21	Q. Have you served in any professional capacity for
22	the U.S. government?
23	A. Yes. I served two terms, which was six years,
24	for the U.S. State Department. The American State
25	Department has a small committee, which is appointed by
17
1	the Secretary of State. There are only nine of us on
2	that committee. It's actually required by Congress.
3	And -- and I sat on that committee for six years in
4	Washington, D.C.
5	Q. Have you received any grants, fellowships, or
6	other awards for your work as an historian?
7	A. Yes. I've received quite a -- a number of
8	awards for my work as a historian.
9	Q. Can you give us a few examples of the awards
10	that you've received?
11	A. I've -- I've received, I would say, probably two
12	types of awards. One are the type of awards where you
13	are selected in a very competitive process to receive a
14	grant to enable you to pursue research. So, for
15	example, a grant I got was to spend a semester at the
16	Smithsonian to do research in American History.
17	In addition, I've also received some prizes for
18	the actual product of my scholarships, so I've received
19	four prizes for my books.
20	Q. Have you previously testified as an expert
21	historian in smoking and health cases?
22	A. Yes, I have.
23	Q. And in the earlier cases, what was the subject
24	area of your testimony?
25	A. In the other cases in which I've testified, the
1	subject has been the same, with a different plaintiff,
2	of course, and sometimes a very different part of the
3	country. But it's been about the question of what
4	information the public generally was exposed to about
5	the hazards of smoking, when they were exposed to it, in
6	what ways they were exposed to it, where, over what
7	period of time, and that kind of thing.
8	Q. And in those particular cases, have you also
9	taken into consideration the -- the specific
10	circumstances of the individual smoker that -- and --
11	and that individual's personal history?
12	A. Yes, every time, because it's -- it's very
13	important, if you were trying to understand the context
14	of someone's life, that you know where they were. And
15	so each time I've been asked this question, I've -- I've
16	gone to the place where that person spent their life, to
17	understand very specifically what they would have been
18	exposed to and their age group that they grew up with.
19	Q. For how many years have you been doing research
20	on the topic of public awareness of the health risks of
21	smoking?
22	A. I started this research about 15 years ago.
23	Q. Do you charge for the time that you spend doing
24	the historical research?
25	A. Yes, I do charge for my time.
1	Q. And what is your hourly rate?
2	A. My hourly rate is $300 an hour.
3	Q. Okay. And have you charged for your time in
4	this case, the Hubbird case?
5	A. Yes, I did.
6	Q. Approximately how many hours have you spent on
7	this case?
8	A. In this particular case I spent about -- thus
9	far, about 75 hours traveling and doing research.
10	Q. Approximately how many hours have you spent
11	doing research on the issue of public awareness of the
12	dangers of cigarette smoking?
13	A. Well, thousands of hours. I don't -- over the
14	course of 15 years, I --1 can't give you a number, but
15	thousands of hours.
16	Q. Earlier you mentioned the historical method and
17	the fact that you teach a course on the historical
18	method. I'd like, if you could, for the jury's benefit,
19	if we can talk somewhat about that and get a perspective
20	of where you're coming from about what and how you did
21	your research in this case.
22	Is there a recognized method by which historians
23	study and analyze the past?
24	A. Yes. There is a very specific method.
25	Q. What is that method called?
1	A. Well, this is the -- the method that I learned
2	at Stanford University. This is the method I teach my
3	own students. And like most professions, historians
4	have a very careful process that they use in order to
5	make sure that the results we get would stand up to a --
6	a group of our peers, a group of professional analysts.
7	And in this case the -- the -- the method that
8	we use, as I explain to my students, I explain now, is
9	you begin with a question. And this sounds very simple,
10	but it's actually in some ways the hardest part of what
11	you do. It's the first part. And, again, sort of like
12	a scientist, you have to be careful to know exactly what
13	you're looking for so you don't go off on tangents, and
14	you don't get variables mixed in that don't make sense.
15	So I define my question very carefully, or make
16	sure my students do. Then what that enables you to do
17	is that then you know, to answer this question, where
18	you need to go to find information, what specific types
19	of information will answer your question, and also what
20	the universe of information is that lies outside.
21	Otherwise, it's very easy to go off on tangents. And I
22	tell my students, you could be wandering in the library
23	for, you know, a month before you really hone in on your
24	topic.
25	So once you've figured out what you need to
21
1	know, then you figure out where you need to go to get
2	it. Sometimes you actually literally have to go to what
3	we call archives. And an archive is the place that has
4	often the single and only existing copy of a particular
5	document. That's important because historians always
6	rely mostly on what we call primary documents. And
7	those are documents that were created at the time. So
8	this isn't something that somebody thought of later or
9	maybe remembered incorrectly. And so we'll go to
10	archives, and we'll collect information that is not
11	available elsewhere.
12	An example of that would be in DeLand, Florida,
13	they would have the DeLand, Florida, newspaper because
14	that's not a big enough newspaper to have been collected
15	and be in San Diego, for example, where I teach. So
16	you'd have to actually go there.
17	Then what the professor or scholar does is they
18	take all the information that they've collected in a
19	comprehensive way. It's very important to make sure
20	you've gotten everything that falls within the scope of
21	your question. And then you analyze it for source bias.
22	You analyze it to reconcile things that may not seem at
23	first that they're consistent with each other, because
24	the world is a -- you know, is a big place and not every
25	piece of evidence lines up with all the others. So it's
22
1	really important to be using context, to be using
2	proportion to analyze that. And, in fact, those are our
3	two big tools, context and proportion, as historians.
4	So once you've analyzed the information, then
5	you go back, and you answer that question.
6	Q. And what -- is what you described to the jury,
7	is that what is known as the historical method?
8	A. That is the historical method that you will see
9	described in many, many books.
10	Q. Does the historical method permit you to reach
11	accurate and reliable opinions and conclusions about the
12	past?
13	A. Yes, it does.
14	Q. What are the problems you can encounter if you
15	don't follow or use the historical method?
16	A. If you don't use the historical method, you can
17	get very misleading and confusing results, very
18	unreliable results. Some of the dangers that historians
19	talk about, one of the first of these we call
20	presentism. And what presentism means is that you're
21	using present-day knowledge or attitudes or values to
22	look through your present-day glasses onto the past, so
23	to speak. And you can -- you can seriously
24	misunderstand something.
25	For example, words are used very different in
23
1	the present than they might have been used in the past.
2	One of my favorite examples is the word "beehive." If I
3	was to tell you in context that we are talking about
4	Jackie Kennedy, who was married to President Kennedy,
5	and I said, She had a beehive, well, if you knew about
6	the 1960s in that early period, you might -- you would
7	understand that she probably had a hairdo which was a
8	very tall, stacked hairdo called a beehive. But if I
9	was speaking of her daughter, Caroline Kennedy, who is
10	still alive and lives in New York, and I said she has a
11	beehive, from context you would know that, you know, the
12	likeliest interpretation is that she maintains bees,
13	because that's kind of a fashionable thing to do in New
14	York.
15	So context and proportion allow us to escape
16	presentism. So presentism is one of the big problems,
17	one of the big dangers, to misread the past. And that
18	goes back again to this question of context, taking
19	things out of context.
20	Q. Is what you've described of making sure you put
21	things in the proper context, is there a phrase or a --
22	a term that's used?
23	A. Well, you -- presentism is -- is taking things
24	off and out of context.
25	Another thing I would simply emphasize is
24
1	proportion. Proportion is important because especially
2	if you're not looking at primary documents at the time
3	period, it's easy to misread things and think they're
4	bigger than they are.
5	So, for example, a real quick one is if you were
6	to say, you know, there was a major Civil War battle in
7	Florida, and let's say somebody from the time wrote a
8	letter home to his mom and said, This was the biggest
9	battle that we had. Three hundred people were killed.
10	If you had only read that, you might think, Wow, that's
11	the biggest Civil War battle. But you need to knowledge
12	about Gettysburg, where 8,000 people were killed. So
13	bigness and proportion are -- are very important.
14	Another example of context that would pertain
15	here is a word like "narcotic." When I first started
16	doing this research 15 years ago, I came across
17	references to tobacco as a narcotic. I actually thought
18	that maybe it was a misprint or something. And then I
19	read deeply in the subject, and I found that that
20	actually was the common term used for tobacco then.
21	It's -- it's certainly not what we would use today, but
22	it helped me understand how people saw it at that time.
23	Q. Are you familiar with the -- with the term
24	"historical context"?
25	A. Yes.
25
1	Q. And are those some of the examples that you've
2	just described as -- are those examples of historical
3	context?
4	A. Yes, those are examples of historical context.
5	And -- and you -- this is one reason why a trained
6	historian is, I think, of -- of such value, because a
7	historian has not just the context of the story that
8	they're researching but also the entire surrounding
9	story of American history that helps us understand just
10	about any topic. So that's why professionals do this.
11	Q. And when you are placing -- or you're looking at
12	something in the historical context, do you try to take
13	into account the big picture?
14	A. Yes. You have to look at the whole picture.
15	Q. And why is that important?
16	A. Well, again, if you don't look at the whole
17	picture, you can easily misinterpret almost any event,
18	very easily misinterpret almost any event.
19	Q. Did you follow the historical method here to
20	study the information that was available to
21	Mr. Ellsworth about the dangers of cigarette smoking?
22	A. Yes. I use the historical method in all my
23	research. Whenever I engage in any topic, this topic of
24	course, whether I'm writing books or articles, it's a --
25	it's like a scientific method. You -- if you're a
26
1	professional, you will always use the same method in
2	order to ensure reliability of results.
3	Q. Professor Hoffman, did you bring a slide that
4	describes the different ways that information about the
5	dangers of smoking were communicated during David
6	Ellsworth's lifetime?
7	A. Yes. I prepared a slide for that.
8	Q. Okay. And we're on Slide 1 right now. Could
9	you explain this -- this slide to the jury?
10	A. In this slide what I've done is I was given a
11	picture of David Ellsworth, and I wanted the jury and
12	the judge to see the ways in which a historian builds a
13	context. To under— to answer my question, my
14	question alerted me to the full range of the kinds of
15	information I needed. You would never take one piece of
16	evidence, for example, and look only at that, because
17	that would be to take anything out of context.
18	So in this context Mr. Ellsworth is surrounded.
19	At the top -- around the top left, we see family. He
20	had two older brothers, who are -- are still alive and
21	testified in this case. He had children, you know,
22	family of all sorts. And a lot of what we learn, people
23	learn from families, so it's important to look at that.
24	The top slide is a picture of Gilbert Stuart
25	High School -- pardon me -- Junior High School, where
27
1	Mr. Gilbert went to -- I'm sorry -- where Mr. Ellsworth
2	went to school, along with his older brothers. On the
3	right-hand side, you see a mass media.
4	And that's another source of information that's
5	particularly important in the time period we're looking
6	at, as the mass media has become such a enormous
7	presence in American life in the 20th century.
8	Below that is a picture of a Baptist Church,
9	which happens to be the very first Baptist Church in
10	America. It's in Providence, Rhode Island, where
11	Mr. David Ellsworth was bom and where he attended
12	Baptist Church. So another way that people get
13	information is from religious authorities, if they're
14	churchgoers.
15	On the bottom you see popular culture there.
16	That would include slang, music, film, all kinds of
17	things that we learn about not because somebody sat down
18	necessarily to teach us a lesson but because it's the
19	information that's just out there. Sort of like rain,
20	you don't know how you get wet, but you -- which drop
21	hits you, but these are all the -- the things that are
22	coming down around us all the time.
23	On the bottom left you see symbols for two of
24	the most important organizations for this particular
25	topic, which were the American Lung Association and the
28
1	American Cancer Society. And both of those groups were
2	very active over many decades in educating Americans
3	like David Ellsworth about the harms and hazards of
4	cigarette smoking.
5	Government, this is the -- actually the State
6	House in Providence, Rhode Island, where I went to do
7	research on this subject, and that's the very beautiful
8	state -- state legislature that they have there in Rhode
9	Island. So these are all the things that would have
10	surrounded, and did surround, Mr. Ellsworth.
11	Q. Now, let's talk a little bit more specifically
12	about the research that you did for this case. Do you
13	have a slide that summarizes the specific materials that
14	you reviewed as part of your research here in this case?
15	A. Yes, I do.
16	Q. Okay. If we go to Slide 2, can you tell us
17	what's -- what's shown on this slide, Dr. -- Professor
18	Hoffman?
19	A. Yes. This slide gives the jury the information
20	about the places I went and the kinds of things I looked
21	at to answer my question comprehensively and fairly and
22	thoroughly. So I looked at Hubbird case materials, and
23	those included quite a number of depositions from his
24	family and acquaintances, also his military records. He
25	served in the Marine Corps, so I was able to obtain his
29
1	military records.
2	I also looked at educational materials,
3	primarily in Rhode Island, since that's entirely where
4	he went to school, although his children went to school
5	in -- in Florida.
6	I also looked at magazines, like Reader's
7	Digest. Reader's Digest was the -- the nation's largest
8	magazine, in fact, the world's largest magazine. It was
9	also approved for use by Rhode Island -- by Providence,
10	Rhode Island, in the schools when he was a student
11	there.
12	I looked at TIME magazine, Life magazine. Those
13	were also preeminent, general interest news magazines,
14	and also at Newsweek. Newsweek, like Reader's Digest,
15	was authorized for use in the schools in Providence,
16	Rhode Island.
17	I looked at religious materials, particularly
18	Baptist materials, since he was raised as a Baptist; and
19	then when he became a stepfather he took his stepson
20	Rickey Maheu to church as well.
21	I looked at pop culture, and that includes songs
22	and slang and such things. I looked at polls. That's
23	one piece of information, too, that gives us some idea
24	of what people were exposed to.
25	Television, film, there I went to UCLA
30
1	Television & Film Archives. I also, in Miami, went to
2	the Wolfson Television Archive.
3	Voluntarily health organizations, those were --
4	I was able to obtain the reports -- public reports and
5	lots of public materials put out by groups like the
6	American Cancer Society, including public service
7	announcements. And those are television and radio
8	announcements which I was able to collect.
9	State and federal records, I looked at those in
10	several locales, Rhode Island, as I mentioned before,
11	and that showed that in that previous slide. Also in
12	Florida I went to Tallahassee, the Florida archives, a
13	variety of archive in Florida; and also in Washington,
14	D.C. the National Archives, which are in Washington. I
15	also went to the National Library of Medicine, which is
16	in Bethesda, Maryland, where I looked at the Surgeon
17	General's records from 1964 and earlier. And I also
18	looked at public libraries, because in public libraries
19	often we find things like local newspapers. So I went
20	to libraries in Providence, Rhode Island; and Miami,
21	where he lived many, many years; and also in DeLand,
22	Florida, where he lived approximately the last ten years
23	of his life.
24	Q. You mentioned before that you had traveled to
25	Providence, Rhode Island, to conduct research in this
31
1	case? Yes?
2	A. That's -- that's correct.
3	Q. And tell us what you did while you were in
4	Providence, Rhode Island.
5	A. In Providence what I did is I went to the
6	archives --1 went to a couple of different archives but
7	spent the most time in the archives for the City of
8	Providence, Rhode Island. And that was important to me
9	because I was working on tracking down what kinds of
10	information Mr. Ellsworth was exposed to in school. And
11	it was there that I found, for example, the -- the
12	school -- minutes of the school board meetings, where
13	they identified these are the books that are authorized.
14	These are the magazines that will be used in the
15	schools.
16	Q. Did you travel to DeLand, Florida, to conduct
17	research for the case?
18	A. I did.
19	Q. What did you do while you were in DeLand,
20	Florida?
21	A. Well, in DeLand, Florida, what I primarily
22	wanted to find was the DeLand Sun Times. That's the
23	local newspaper, and one of Mr. Ellsworth's daughters
24	said that he read the local DeLand paper. In fact, they
25	call it the homegrown newspaper of DeLand. And so I
32
1	looked at the DeLand Sun Times in the local public
2	library.
3	Q. Okay. And -- and I think you also mentioned
4	that you went -- you had been to Miami to conduct
5	research. Is that right?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. All right. And are all the materials that you
8	just described, which are the types of materials that a
9	historian would reasonably rely upon to study historical
10	questions like the one you researched for this case?
11	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
12	THE WITNESS: Are the -- these are the types of
13	materials that any professional historian would go to.
14	These are absolutely --1 want to call them bread and
15	butter documents. You know, federal government
16	documents, laws, education, public media, again, pop
17	culture and polls -- these are things I've used in all
18	my research in all the books I've written for, which I
19	have --1 have won prizes.
20	BY MR. DAVIS:
21	Q. Do you rely solely on any one of the sources
22	that you've identified here in Slide 2 to form your
23	opinions?
24	A. No. I didn't, and I wouldn't, because that
25	would not be the method of a professional historian.
33
1	Any one piece of evidence is not very useful without all
2	of the corroborating evidence around it, all the -- the
3	context in which it occurred.
4	Q. You mentioned that you reviewed depositions
5	taken in the case of individuals either -- who were
6	either family members or others that knew Mr. Ellsworth.
7	What did you learn from reading those depositions and
8	reviewing the other records specific to him, from your
9	review? What did you learn from that?
10	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
11	THE WITNESS: I learned a lot of things from the
12	depositions. I really -- I'm almost -- say -- you could
13	say almost start there. I need to know about the
14	person, where they -- where they grew up, what their
15	family members had heard/knew about the hazards of
16	smoking, for example. I learned a lot about where he
17	lived. I learned about the cautions that family members
18	had given him, for example, about hazards such as the
19	ones that I'm looking at in my overall question.
20	I found the military records very helpful
21	because they told me what he had done in the service. I
22	also learned where he was stationed and -- and when.
23	And so all of those materials were very useful.
24	BY MR. DAVIS:
25	Q. Can we go back to Slide 1 real quickly?
34
1	For the -- for this slide, in terms of the
2	information and sources of information that were
3	available to Mr. Ellsworth, did any of these sources not
4	apply to his circumstances, based upon what you reviewed
5	in the depositions --
6	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
7	BY MR. DAVIS:
8	Q. — and other records that you've reviewed
9	specific to him?
10	A. No. Based on the depositions, every single one
11	of these would absolutely apply. And it would be
12	improper as a historian to drop any one of them out.
13	You'd need to know.
14	Q. Did you review any internal tobacco company
15	documents as part of your research in this case?
16	A. No, I did not.
17	Q. Why -- why not?
18	A. Again, going back to the historical method, when
19	you devise a question, what you're -- what you need to
20	look at is everything that applies to answering that
21	question. If something doesn't apply, it's actually
22	important historically not to include it, because it can
23	muddy your results. You're not following the
24	professional -- professional protocol.
25	Now, why internal company documents would not be
35
1	relevant and, in fact, could be confusing or misleading
2	is because I wanted to see and I --1 needed to know
3	what the public was exposed to, what information the
4	public had at its disposal, including Mr. Ellsworth.
5	Any document that was internal to, in this case
6	the tobacco industry, would not have been a document he
7	would have had any exposure to or could have gotten any
8	information from. So I need to look at simply what he
9	was exposed to or could have been exposed to. So those
10	documents were irrelevant.
11	Q. If a tobacco company statement reached the
12	public -- for example, in a newspaper, magazine article,
13	or TV or radio -- would you have considered that in
14	reaching your opinions in this case?
15	A. Yes, absolutely, because that falls within the
16	question of information to which the public would have
17	been exposed. So, for example, in a newspaper article
18	there could have been a mention of what the industry
19	spokesperson said about a given study, for example. And
20	so that's very important to consider.
21	Q. Professor Hoffman, have -- based upon your
22	historical research and the historical record that
23	you've analyzed, have you formed an opinion to a
24	reasonable degree of professional certainty about the
25	information that was publicly communicated and available
1	to people like Mr. Ellsworth during his lifetime about
2	the health risks of cigarette smoking?
3	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
4	THE WITNESS: Yes, I have reached a definite
5	professional conclusion.
6	BY MR. DAVIS:
7	Q. And for the opinions that you will offer here
8	today about the -- your research and the results of your
9	research, do you hold those opinions to a reasonable
10	degree of professional certainty in your field as an
11	historian?
12	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
13	THE WITNESS: Yes. My results are based on
14	careful research that leads me to a very certain
15	professional conclusion.
16	BY MR. DAVIS:
17	Q. Do you have a slide summarizing your opinions?
18	A. Yes, I do.
19	Q. All right. Let's -- let's pull up Slide 3,
20	please.
21	Can you just tell us what your opinions and --
22	and a summary of your opinions and conclusions as they
23	relate to David Ellsworth?
24	A. Yes. My research shows and leads me to the
25	professional conclusion that throughout Mr. David
1	Ellsworth's lifetime, a massive amount of information
2	from many different sources was available to him and the
3	public about the dangers of smoking. And that included
4	information that smoking can cause lung cancer, other
5	diseases as well, and that it can be addictive or habit
6	forming.
7	Q. Based upon the amount and type of information
8	that you have discovered in your research, do you have
9	an opinion as to how difficult it would have been for
10	someone living in the time period in places that
11	Mr. Ellsworth lived to have missed this information?
12	A. Yes. It's -
13	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
14	BY MR. DAVIS:
15	Q. What's your opinion?
16	A. My professional opinion is that it would have
17	been impossible for David Ellsworth or anyone else in
18	his generation to avoid this information.
19	Q. For the slides that you will show the jury today
20	about the historical documents that you've researched
21	and discuss here, such as books -- textbooks, newspaper
22	articles, TV shows, or news, public service
23	announcements, and published for broadcast statements,
24	do the slides reflect true and -- and correct copies or
25	representations of the historical materials or documents
1	upon which they are -- which are reflected on the
2	slides?
3	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
4	THE WITNESS: Yes. These are all true, accurate
5	copies of the -- of the materials that I found.
6	BY MR. DAVIS:
7	Q. Okay. Let's turn our attention to talk about
8	Mr. Ellsworth. Before you reach opinions about the
9	availability of information about the dangers of
10	smoking, is it important for you to know as much as you
11	can about the person's background and experiences?
12	A. Yes. It's -- it's important for me to find out
13	as much as possible.
14	Q. When was Mr. Ellsworth bom?
15	A. Mr. Ellsworth was born in March of 1934.
16	Q. Where was Mr. Ellsworth bom?
17	A. He was born in Providence, Rhode Island.
18	Q. Did he grow up in Providence, Rhode Island?
19	A. Yes. He stayed in Providence until he joined
20	the Marine Corps, which he joined the month before his
21	eighteenth birthday.
22	Q. Did you limit your research to materials from
23	1934 forward?
24	A. No, I did not.
25	Q. Why didn't you do that?
39
1	A. Well, again, this is very important because of
2	the context. He wasn't bom into a world that didn't
3	exist. There's a -- a framework of laws. He had -- he
4	had parents, the older -- older brothers. So it's very
5	important to understand the world into which he was bom
6	and that he became a part of.
7	Q. In doing your historical research, did you find
8	any public discussion or opposition to tobacco because
9	it was dangerous, even before Mr. Ellsworth was bom?
10	A. Yes, absolutely.
11	Q. Do you have a slide showing some examples of
12	that early opposition to tobacco?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. All right. Let's go to the next slide, which is
15	Slide 4.
16	Can you tell us what's shown here and -- and why
17	you picked this?
18	A. This is one representation of a big field of
19	infomiation I could present about the opposition to
20	tobacco. This is from King James I, who wrote --
21	commissioned the King James Bible, with which many
22	people will be familiar or will have heard of. This was
23	England's version of opposition to tobacco.
24	In other countries tobacco was actually -- in
25	fact, use of tobacco was punishable by death in China,
40
1	Turkey, Russia as well. In England they taxed it. So
2	King James put --1 think it was a 4,000 percent tax on
3	the price of tobacco. And he also put out a pamphlet,
4	one of our first government pamphlets telling you
5	smoking will be harmful. And he called it a custom
6	loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to
7	the brain, and dangerous to the lungs. And this is a
8	statement I, by the way, have seen represented many
9	times over in all kinds of modern publications.
10	Q. And we -- we see here in the quote that's pulled
11	out on the slide that there is -- that there are some
12	words that are just -- are spelled differently. Are
13	those misspellings, or is that how they spelled those
14	words back in the day?
15	A. Well, that's how they spelled things back then.
16	Again, the context is very different. This is from
17	1604. But you see -- and you also see different ways of
18	talking about things that we would say today, you know,
19	it will hurt your lungs. It causes aneurysms in the
20	brain. It's -- it hurts your respiration. It can
21	damage your eyesight. So we would use different terms.
22	But -- and that's the difference in context. But he's
23	talking about similar problems.
24	Q. And for the record, this is AIW_6. That's the
25	exhibit number.
41
1	Doctor -- excuse me -- Professor Hoffman, in
2	your research did you see any other aspect of cigarette
3	smoking that was discussed?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Can you tell us what those are?
6	A. Well, in this same period of time, there --
7	and -- and later, there were many, many examples of --
8	of this. I, you know, again, have dozens of -- of
9	articles. And some of these are religious matters. For
10	example, when the United States -- well, before it
11	became the United States, early preachers preached
12	against it. The Methodist Church, the Puritan Church,
13	et cetera, also preached and warned people about medical
14	hazards.
15	Q. Based upon your research, did you see discussion
16	in the 16-, 17-, and 1800s about cigarette smoking
17	either causing harm or be -- being habit forming or hard
18	to quit?
19	A. Yes, absolutely. In fact, tobacco came over to
20	Europe as a result of the voyages of Columbus. And the
21	very first hazard that people right at that time began
22	writing about, I mean people like Americo Vespucio, for
23	whom America is named, was that people who started
24	smoking had trouble quitting. So the addictive element
25	of smoking was actually the first hazard that became
42
1	well known. By the time of King James, they're adding
2	other problems to the list.
3	Q. How far back does the use of the words "cancer"
4	and "addictive" go with respect to tobacco?
5	A. Tobac— cancer as being associated with
6	tobacco goes back into the 18th century. "Addictive,"
7	I've seen that in the 19th century.
8	Q. Okay. Now, do you have some examples for the
9	jury in the next slide?
10	A. Yes, I do.
11	Q. Okay. Let's go to Slide 5. And this is AIW_9
12	and AIW_3522 for exhibit.
13	And what's depicted here, Professor Hoffman?
14	A. Well, what I've -- what I've done is I've just
15	picked two examples. I could show you many more
16	examples as well. On the left we see a picture of
17	Benjamin Rush. He was our first Surgeon General. He
18	was actually the Surgeon General of the Continental Army
19	under George Washington. And after the Revolution he
20	wrote quite a bit. He was a Philadelphia physician, and
21	he put out a pamphlet, which I read, which said, "A
22	Citizen" -- this is one quote from it. "A citizen lost
23	all his teeth by drawing the hot smoke of tobacco into
24	his mouth," so gum disease. "And I have been informed
25	of a cancer of the lip, which terminated fatally from
43
1	the same cause." And there were other physicians at
2	Harvard University at that time, then called Harvard
3	College. There was another physician who wrote about
4	cancer and harms.
5	On the right-hand side you see a picture of John
6	Quincy Adams. He was our sixth president and son of
7	John Adams. And writing to a friend he wrote, "In my
8	early youth I was addicted to the use of tobacco." So
9	the word "addiction" is something I saw a lot in the
10	19th century. Sometimes they would use another phrase
11	like, "a slave to tobacco," and this was a time when
12	there was actual slavery, so it was a very strong term
13	about which people, you know, had very strong negative
14	feelings.
15	Q. As part of your research, did you find early
16	references to addiction from cigarette smoking in the
17	state of Florida?
18	A. I did.
19	Q. Okay. And do you have a slide showing the
20	earliest reference that you found for the term
21	"addiction" for -- used by the state of Florida?
22	A. Yes, I brought an example of that.
23	Q. Okay. Let's use -- let's go to Slide 6, and
24	it's -- exhibit number is AHL_32.
25	Tell us what's -- what's shown here on the
44
1	slide, Professor Hoffman.
2	A. Well, Florida Health Notes is a publication
3	that, you know, all -- published all through the 20th
4	century, but going back early to 1906, so this is one
5	example I found. I did research at the University of
6	Miami, where they had archives that contained the
7	Florida Health Notes. I also found some of them in the
8	archives up in Tallahassee.
9	In this particular one what it showed, and as it
10	says -- the call-out quote there, it says, "Today the
11	cigarette is looked upon by all smokers as the very
12	worst form of tobacco addition -- addiction." And by
13	the way, this is an example of historical context. The
14	word "today" is not misspelled; it's simply spelled
15	differently at that time.
16	Q. Why are John Quincy Adams, Benjamin Rush, and
17	the Florida Health Notes significant to you in terms of
18	forming opinions in this case?
19	A. It's significant because it shows a context of
20	widespread knowledge, awareness, information about the
21	habit forming and addictive character of -- of nicotine,
22	of tobacco, and that that was something that was
23	commonplace when people would discuss it.
24	Another example of this was Ulysses S. Grant,
25	American president, great Civil War hero, who died of a
45
1	throat cancer. And the references I found from that
2	very time, from the 19th and early 20th Centuries, all
3	mentioned that he was a heavy smoker, and as a result of
4	that, he died of throat cancer.
5	Q. Has the fact that smoking it habit forming and
6	hard to quit always been characterized as an addiction?
7	A. That word is a -- is a word that's used, you
8	know, in everyday language, and sometimes it's used in a
9	very medically specific way. In the cases we're talking
10	about, the early 20th century, it was used
11	interchangeably with words like "habit forming," or as I
12	mentioned, "enslaving," the idea that you would have a
13	really hard time quitting. So "addiction" was a
14	commonly used term.
15	As you can see, Florida Health Notes is actually
16	the official bulletin of the State Board of Health. So
17	in that case it was a governmental agency using that
18	word.
19	Q. So the informations that -- like some of these
20	historical documents going back several hundred years,
21	was that -- was that information available well before
22	Mr. Ellsworth was bom?
23	A. Yes, it was.
24	Q. Was it available before he ever picked up his
25	first cigarette?
46
1	A. Yes, it was.
2	Q. As a result of opposition to tobacco and its
3	addictive quality, were any prohibition laws passed in
4	the United States relating to cigarettes?
5	A. Yes. It's ironic, I think, probably to those of
6	us today to know that actually tobacco cigarettes were
7	banned before opium was banned in the United States, in
8	states like Florida and California, where I'm from. So,
9	yes, there were a number of laws passed against the
10	manufacture and use and possession of cigarettes.
11	Q. Do you have a slide that represents some of
12	these laws that went into effect?
13	A. Yes, I do.
14	Q. Okay. And so let's go to Slide 7.
15	Tell us what we're seeing here, Professor
16	Hoffman.
17	A. Well, what you're seeing here is a slide that
18	depicts the prohibition movement. And I realize that
19	for many of us, if we're not deeply versed in this
20	period of American history, one thinks of the word
21	"prohibition," and one thinks of alcohol. And, in fact,
22	those movements were fairly parallel, and you would see
23	some similar maps there.
24	There was a big concern at this time about
25	outlawing things that people understood were very
47
1	harmful to health and risky, like alcohol and tobacco.
2	In this case, this with the prohibition of cigarettes,
3	as you see, everything in blue is a place that was
4	either -- it was considered as a law, like in my state,
5	in California, which considered it several times but
6	never passed that law. But in 16 states it was actually
7	passed, and cigarette use and possession was made
8	illegal, not just for minors but for all adults, all
9	citizens. That was true in Florida. As you can see on
10	the bottom right, it's one of the states that's in that
11	deep blue color.
12	Q. And can you tell us when Florida passed the
13	prohibition law on cigarettes?
14	A. Florida passed it a couple of times because it
15	was passed, and then at one point it was overturned. So
16	back -- going back to 1899, it was again passed in 1907,
17	so on a couple of occasions.
18	Q. Based upon your research and historical context
19	at the -- at the time, what does the historical record
20	reflect about why states like Florida enacted cigarette
21	prohibition laws?
22	A. States like Florida enacted cigarette
23	prohibition laws because they understood -- well, the
24	legislators who were advocating for this, that -- that
25	tobacco smoking was very harmful, that it could be
48
1	dangerous. Now, this is around the same time as the
2	Pure Food and Drug Act, for example, which was another
3	movement to basically regulate or if possible eliminate
4	anything that was harmful. So things like in relation
5	to alcohol actually went through. What they found is
6	that it was so hard to enforce that ultimately they
7	decided they would regulate it rather than prohibit it.
8	And that's why you see in the chart, it starts to --
9	these things are repealed, or they start to die out
10	after 1930, which was around the same time that alcohol
11	prohibition was lifted, because they found that
12	sometimes, especially in relation to alcohol, people
13	wanted to do it more, so better to regulate than to
14	prohibit.
15	Q. Okay. In the 1930s and 1940s when Mr. Ellsworth
16	was growing up, did Rhode Island have a law prohibiting
17	the sale of tobacco to minors?
18	A. Yes, it did.
19	Q. Do you have a slide that talks about that?
20	A. I do.
21	Q. Let's go to Slide 8, and it is Exhibit APS_9730
22	and APS_9796.
23	What's -- can you help us -- teach us, if you
24	will, what -- what is the significance of this
25	particular -- these particular laws that you found.
49
1	A. Well, I think there are two things that are
2	significant about this, and this is one reason why it's
3	so important to go to the place where something happens,
4	in this case where Mr. Ellsworth was bom. You learn
5	things. The top law shows us the law that was there
6	since 1892. It was reiterated in 1938, as you see,
7	which was, of course, right after he was bom and before
8	he started school, so he would have been four years old
9	in 1938.
10	The top law says basically that no person can
11	sell, give, or deliver to any minor under 16 years of
12	age any tobacco in the form of cigarettes. Now, that's
13	a law I've seen in every single state that I've looked
14	at. What's interesting about Rhode Island is that it
15	has a second part to this law that you see below that
16	was also present in 1938, in addition to 1892, and it
17	said that "No person under 16 years of age shall smoke
18	or chew in any public street, place, or resort any
19	tobacco in any form whatsoever. Any such person
20	violating the provisions of this section shall be fined
21	not more than $5."
22	Now, why that's significant to me is that it
23	says that actually it was against the law for minors to
24	engage in this behavior. Now, that is very unusual.
25	Rhode Island is very responsible and very concerned
50
1	about this. For example, Florida didn't pass that kind
2	of law until 2001. So it's always been the case that
3	you couldn't sell or give minors this stuff, but if the
4	minor was caught using it, you know, they were caught
5	using it. Rhode Island, it was against the law.
6	Q. Now, how did Rhode Island compare to other
7	state, in terms of when it passed a law where there was
8	some type of penalty for -- by a minor if the minor
9	possessed tobacco in any form whatsoever?
10	A. Well, Rhode Island was way ahead of everybody
11	else, but at the same time, it was also consistent. And
12	that's where that historical context is interesting,
13	because it was consistent in that it did have the laws
14	regulating the sale. It had laws against giving or
15	selling tobacco to minors. I saw those laws in Florida,
16	New York -- New York, California, everywhere that I've
17	done any research.
18	Q. Yeah. And you mentioned that the law was
19	originally passed in 1892. Was it still in effect when
20	David Ellsworth attended school in Providence, Rhode
21	Island?
22	A. Yes, it was in effect.
23	Q. And in 1938 it says that the --1 think you
24	mentioned that the fine was about $5. How did -- what
25	was that the equivalent back in -- in 1938? What was
51
1	the -- what's today's equivalent of $5?
2	A. Oh, gosh.
3	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
4	BY MR. DAVIS:
5	Q. Let me back up. Let me ask it -- so if you --
6	based on inflation, $5 in 1938 would be what, what
7	amount of money today?
8	A. Well, honestly, I don't have --
9	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
10	THE WITNESS: -- that calculation. I certainly
11	know that $5 in the midst of the Great Depression was a
12	tremendous amount of money. So for a minor to come up
13	with $5 for each offense, I -- is absolutely
14	prohibitive.
15	BY MR. DAVIS:
16	Q. As a historian, how do these laws relate to the
17	public awareness of the dangers of smoking?
18	A. These laws relate to understanding about the
19	hazards and dangers of smoking because law is very
20	important for us. People do break laws. But what the
21	law always tells us is what, you know, officials who
22	have given a lot of thought to what should be happening
23	in society have decided is the important thing to do.
24	And so when they're telling people you may not do this,
25	you may not do that, it's because they're telling you
52
1	something that's -- that's very fundamental to the
2	society and to understandings about what's good for
3	people and what's harmful.
4	Q. Let's talk about education, which is another
5	source of information that you've looked at concerning
6	Mr. Ellsworth. When did Mr. Ellsworth begin his
7	education in Rhode Island?
8	A. Mr. Ellsworth would have entered school,
9	kindergarten 1939, first grade 1940, so right around
10	this same period of time.
11	Q. And what's -- what middle school did he attend?
12	A. He attended the Gilbert Stuart Junior High.
13	Q. And during the time that Mr. Ellsworth was
14	attending school, and based upon your research of -- of
15	the historical record, what were the schools in Rhode
16	Island -- Providence, Rhode Island, teaching about the
17	dangers of smoking?
18	A. Well, in Rhode Island, as in many states,
19	teachers operated under a law, what's called education
20	law. And that is -- required teachers actually by law
21	to be teaching about the hazards of smoking. Now, again
22	they would sometimes use words like "narcotics." But --
23	but based on the historical record, it's quite clear
24	that by narcotic they meant tobacco.
25	Q. During the time that Mr. Ellsworth was attending
53
1	school in Providence, Rhode island, were teachers at the
2	time talking and teaching students that tobacco or
3	cigarette smoking was bad for the lungs?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Were the teachers at the time that Mr. Ellsworth
6	attended school in Providence, Rhode Island, talking
7	about how tobacco or cigarette smoking shortens the life
8	span?
9	A. Yes, they did.
10	Q. And that it was harmful to health?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. In the 1940s when Mr. Ellsworth was in school,
13	did the state of Rhode Island require that dangers of
14	smoking be taught to students?
15	A. Yes. That was the law.
16	Q. Do you have a slide that helps illustrates this
17	point?
18	A. I do.
19	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 9.
20	Professor Hoffman, can you tell us what --
21	what's this slide showing, and why it was significant to
22	you?
23	A. What this slide shows are two things, which are
24	very closely related. On the left-hand side you see
25	the -- the law, the acts of the Assembly of Rhode
1	Island, which passes laws about what students must be
2	taught and, you know, what kinds of books they should be
3	able to have accessible to them, so on the -- it shows
4	that in 1884 -- and this, by the way, was reiterated by
5	the legislature many times, four or five times, up until
6	1939, again reiterated just as he was going into school,
7	and it basically said you must teach about the hazards.
8	On the right-hand side, what you'll see that -- how this
9	law gets implemented, because the school board then
10	tells teachers about the law and -- and instructs
11	teachers on what they must be teaching students. So
12	this quote, which I got from this particular curriculum
13	guide made up in Providence, it said, "The curriculum
14	shall emphasize physiology and hygiene, with special
15	reference to the effects of acholic liquors, stimulants,
16	and narcotics upon the human system." Again, narcotics,
17	we might be tempted to think they must be talking about
18	opium, which they were, but they also classify tobacco
19	as a narcotic.
20	Q. And did you learn that, again, from the
21	historical research that you did?
22	A. I did, from extensive research both in Florida
23	and also in Providence.
24	Q. Besides curriculum -- curriculum guides -- let
25	me back up for a second.
1	For the record, it's -- what's shown on the
2	slide is APS_9729 and APS_9774.
3	Besides curriculum guides, Professor Hoffman,
4	how did the state of Rhode Island go about implementing
5	these laws, from what you found in your historical
6	research?
7	A. Well, what I found in the historical -- in the
8	archives in Providence were the school board minutes,
9	and they told me several things. And I also looked at
10	these curriculum guides, which I got through the
11	Providence public libraries and -- and a state library.
12	And they told me two things. First of all, the list of
13	textbooks that was authorized for use in the schools in
14	the very years that Mr. David Ellsworth and his two
15	older brothers were in school, so I have the specific
16	books. And that's one way in which we know the
17	information that they were being exposed to.
18	I also learned how they used them, for example,
19	that health textbooks were used as a part of physical
20	education. So they would have kids do their physical
21	education and also have them read the textbooks about
22	health, you know, in the course of that same lesson.
23	Q. Okay. And did you bring some examples of the
24	actual textbooks that were authorized or approved by the
25	school committee of Providence during the time that
1	David Ellsworth attended school?
2	A. Yes, I did.
3	Q. Are you able to say for sure that Mr. Ellsworth
4	used these specific textbooks in his classroom?
5	A. I can't say that he picked up the book and used
6	the book. I --1 do know these were the books that were
7	authorized that, teachers were required to use them by
8	law. So I have no reason to think he wouldn't have been
9	exposed to it. But did he actually show up on that day
10	and pick up the book? I don't know. It's not possible
11	to know.
12	Q. And nonetheless, why are these textbooks
13	significant to you in terms of -- of the opinions that
14	you formed concerning Mr. David Ellsworth and the
15	publicly available information about the dangers of
16	cigarette smoking?
17	A. They are important because they're, again, a
18	part of this context. Students read these books. Which
19	students read them, you can't bring it down to that
20	level of historical detail. But certainly these are the
21	information that his teachers, his fellow students, his
22	brothers might have read, were supposed to read.
23	In fact, by the way, from the deposition
24	testimony, the testimony is that his older brother, his
25	next to oldest brother actually recalls being taught
57
1	this information in junior high school. So I think
2	that's also very relevant to -- to understanding that
3	these books were really in use.
4	Q. Okay. And let's take a look at the -- at some
5	of the examples of the textbooks that you brought here
6	today that you used to base your opinions upon.
7	Let's go to the next slide, which is Slide 10.
8	This is Exhibit No. ATB_326, paren, 1935, close paren.
9	Professor Hoffman, can you tell us what's
10	depicted here on this slide?
11	A. Yes. This is a book that was authorized by the
12	school board of Providence, Rhode Island, when he was
13	going to elementary school in Providence. This was the
14	book that was authorized for use in the third grade.
15	And it said -- you know, it took -- about all health
16	topics; it's about everyday living. But again, this
17	information is wound into this health textbook, which
18	kids were assigned.
19	For example, one of the things it said is at the
20	top, "Nearly all doctors agree that tobacco is harmful
21	to growing boy and girls." It also said, "The first
22	time a boy smokes, he may become ill. This is the
23	body's way of telling him that tobacco is harmful. If
24	he keeps on using it, he finds he wants it more and
25	more; thus he forms a habit that is always expensive,
58
1	that may be very harmful, and that will be hard to
2	break." So it's a -- it's a third grade way of saying
3	it's obviously put in language that would be accessible
4	to a -- a young child.
5	Q. Now, this book was published in 1935, the year
6	after Mr. Ellsworth was bom. Is that right?
7	A. Yes, that's correct.
8	Q. And how would -- how do we know that it was
9	still being used at the time that he went to -- that he
10	attended school?
11	A. Well, this was--textbooks are expensive. And
12	so, for example, in this case I think the year was 1941
13	where the actual school board met and said, you know,
14	this is the series that we're going to use. So we know
15	it's authorized. A few years later they added another
16	series, but this was certainly authorized, and -- and it
17	had a very limited number of books that they -- that
18	they authorized. So published the 1935 but certainly --
19	definitely used after 1941, which is when he was -- by
20	the time he was in second grade.
21	Q. Do you have another example of a textbook
22	approved for use when Mr. Ellsworth was in school in
23	Providence?
24	A. Yes, I do.
25	Q. All right. Can you show the jury that textbook?
59
1	A. Yes. Now, as you can see, they -- they wound it
2	into pretty much every grade. And that's one of the
3	things I think it's important to know, that sometimes
4	people will remember the particular grade they learned
5	it in. In Richard Ellsworth's case -- that's the next
6	oldest both to David Ellsworth -- he remembered learning
7	about it in junior high. But, in fact, historically the
8	record shows that it was in every single grade. So I
9	actually happen to have that book I could --1 could
10	get. Some of these books I can only get in the library,
11	but I was able to -- this comes through eBay. So in
12	Safety Every Day, which was the fourth grade book in
13	Rhode -- authorized from Rhode Island, in Providence,
14	had a variety of things that said -- one of the quotes
15	is "Tobacco makes the lungs less able to do their work."
16	It also said that "Tobacco hurts the heart of many
17	persons who smoke too much. The heart trouble may grow
18	worse later life." That's talking to fourth graders.
19	It also notes again what we would call again addiction.
20	But it says, "Once a person has the smoking habit, he
21	often finds it very hard to break the habit."
22	Q. Okay. And for the record, that's Exhibit
23	ATB_46, paren, 1939, close paren.
24	Do you have another example of textbooks that
25	were approved or authorized during the time period that
60
1	David Ellsworth attended school in Providence?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Okay. Let's go to the next slide, which is
4	Slide 12. And for the record, that's ATB_186, paren,
5	1941, close paren.
6	Go ahead.
7	A. So this was a book for the sixth grade, and
8	textbooks are not always but often numbered, so you know
9	what grade it was for. In this particular one, one of
10	the things they noted, which again it was a very common
11	fact that was put forward about tobacco in most of these
12	books, it said, "The chief poison in tobacco is
13	nicotine." So, of course, that's a very strong word,
14	"poison," and they're talking about the primary
15	ingredient that makes it hard to stop smoking.
16	They also said, "Smoking is less harmful when
17	the smoke is not inhaled, but a certain amount of
18	nicotine is always breathed in. Tobacco smoke that is
19	inhaled is also harmful to the lungs." So lung damage
20	was always one of the important focuses.
21	Q. Okay. Let's go to another -- the next slide,
22	which is Slide 13.
23	Professor Hoffman, can you tell us what's the --
24	what's shown here on Slide 13.
25	A. Yeah, this is the seventh grade textbook. And
61
1	this -- again, I have one of those. This is Health for
2	Young Americans, and, you know, again on all kinds of
3	diseases. But as the law required, they had a section
4	on tobacco and -- and, you know, alcohol, et cetera.
5	And it -- and this one, some of the quotes were,
6	"Alcohol, tobacco, and other narcotic drugs." And by
7	the way, here's an example of how can you see tobacco
8	being called a narcotic drug, as alcohol was too.
9	"Alcohol, tobacco, and other narcotic drugs are harmful
10	and destructive enemies. There are other undesirable
11	substances such as tars and resins in tobacco, which
12	have irritating effects upon the delicate linings of the
13	nose and throat." Later in the book it said, "Tobacco
14	is dangerous too in that it is habit forming. In time
15	the practice of smoking takes a stronger hold upon the
16	smoker, forcing him to smoke more and more until he
17	becomes an excessive smoker."
18	Q. And those are some of the quotes that you found
19	of significance as you did your research?
20	A. That's right.
21	Q. Now, for the record, that's ATB_515, paren,
22	1946, close paren.
23	Do you have any other examples that you could
24	share with the jury?
25	A. I do.
62
1	Q. All right. Let's go to the next slide. This is
2	Slide 14.
3	And can you tell the jury, Professor Hoffman,
4	what's depicted here?
5	A. This is from the eighth grade. The book that
6	was authorized at that time is called "A Sound Body."
7	Here it gave a list of things you should do and not do.
8	And one of the things it emphasized was that a person, a
9	student like Mr. Ellsworth, a junior high school
10	student, should avoid tobacco and drugs. Tobacco
11	usually causes the heart to be beat faster because the
12	poison in tobacco, nicotine, acts upon the adrenal
13	glands. This latter condition is especially noticeable
14	after the age of 50. Severe irregularities of the heart
15	may result in sudden death during middle life, and this
16	is seen especially in heavy smokers.
17	Q. Okay. All right. Do you have another example
18	as well from the textbooks that were in use at
19	Providence, Rhode Island?
20	A. I do.
21	Q. All right. Let's go to the next slide, which is
22	Slide 15. It's Exhibit No. ATB_50, paren, 1941, close
23	paren. And I think the last one, if I didn't get it,
24	was -- Slide 13 was ATB_515, paren, 1946, close paren.
25	All right. Tell us, what was -- what did you
63
1	find of significance in this particular textbook?
2	A. Well, this was a ninth grade textbook, also
3	assigned in Providence, Rhode Island. This --1 thought
4	about whether or not to include this because he -- the
5	records say that he graduated from eighth grade but that
6	he reached ninth grade, and so I was just a little
7	ambiguous about that. Also his -- his brothers and also
8	his friends, of course, people were in ninth grade,
9	so -- so this is a little bit of a transitional one.
10	But this was very interesting. Again, there were quite
11	extensive discussions about the hazards of smoking in
12	this book. But one of the things I thought was very
13	interesting about it is it referred specifically to a
14	study, then gaining a lot of attention, by Raymond
15	Pearl. And it said, "Dr. Raymond Pearl of Johns Hopkins
16	University recently showed that even moderate smoking
17	shortens life." And so that the emergence of major
18	studies that people began to know about, even in terms
19	of who the researchers were, that's something you're
20	starting to see here in the -- in the early 1940s, late
21	1930s, actually, and early 1940s.
22	Q. Now, do we have another example of a textbook
23	that was approved for use in Providence, Rhode Island?
24	A. Yes, we do.
25	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 16, which is
64
1	Exhibit No. ATB_1142, paren, 1943, close paren.
2	And, Professor Hoffman, can you tell us what's
3	depicted here?
4	A. Yes. This is a science textbook, and this is
5	from junior high school. We know he did graduate junior
6	high school. Often teachers would find different ways
7	of putting together -- you know, different ways of
8	putting out this kind of information about smoking
9	hazards. So as I mentioned, it would certainly be in
10	health classes and physical education. Sometimes it
11	would even be put into math books so people could figure
12	out how costly smoking was. But it was all -- very,
13	very commonly in science, and it was in a science book
14	authorized for use in junior high in Providence. So
15	that's just another subject area.
16	And it said, "Tobacco is known to be harmful to
17	boys and girls. A recent scientific study showed that
18	cigarette smoke contains small quantities of several
19	violent poisons." And at -- then at the bottom,
20	"Tobacco belongs in the class of substances called
21	'habit-forming drugs.'"
22	Q. And was advertising of products discussed in
23	this textbook as well?
24	A. Yes, it was. It was discussed in several
25	textbooks. One of the efforts of teachers throughout
65
1	this period was to alert students to be very cautious
2	about advertising as self interested, and so the test --
3	health textbooks would sometimes ask students to do what
4	teachers ask students to do today, which is collect
5	advertisements to see the ways in which advertisements
6	imply that a product is fun and -- and not necessarily
7	harmful. And so they really wanted to inoculate
8	students against -- against falling for advertising.
9	Q. Okay. And so was -- so was this the only
10	textbook that mentioned something about advertising, in
11	terms of what you reviewed specific to the textbooks
12	that were approved for use during the time that David
13	Ellsworth attended school?
14	A. No. There were -- there were --it was in
15	several textbooks.
16	Q. For each of the textbooks that we've covered,
17	were they approved for -- for use for only a single
18	year?
19	A. No. As I mentioned, textbooks, you know, like
20	Health in a Power Age, they -- they were very expensive,
21	and so they were typically used for what they -- what
22	they called multi-year adoptions. So they might often
23	have been used for up to eight years and passed from
24	student to student.
25	Q. One of the other sources of information you've
66
1	mentioned that you looked at in research was popular
2	culture, or pop culture. Can you tell the jury what it
3	is -- what pop culture is and why it was of significance
4	to you?
5	A. Pop culture is of great significance to
6	historians because it -- it's yet another level of -- of
7	information and understanding. So we talked earlier
8	about law. Law is what, you know, people kind of at the
9	top of our society think we ought to do. And then
10	education is what teachers organize to tell us.
11	There was recently a popular book called
12	"Everything I Ever Needed to Know I Lived in --1
13	Learned in Kindergarten." So that's where teachers
14	think about what you ought to know.
15	Pop culture is really kind of what's out there,
16	what people do know or what information they do have.
17	So, for example, information that's casually embedded is
18	in some ways more revealing because to get a joke, you
19	have to know all kinds of things that are background.
20	In fact, we have the word "clueless." A clueless person
21	is a person who's not paying attention to the world
22	around. So to be clued in means that you're going to
23	get the joke. You're going to understand what a
24	reference means.
25	Q. And what are some examples of popular culture?
67
1	A. Slang is an example of popular culture. Music
2	is an example of popular culture. Again, it's not a
3	formal lesson. It's an individual makes up a word or
4	writes a song. Movies, television reflect popular
5	culture. That's the kind of thing that comes readily to
6	mind.
7	Q. And you mentioned slang. How -- have people
8	used slang terms over the years to describe tobacco as
9	habit forming or dangerous?
10	MR. KAISER: Objection to form.
11	THE WITNESS: Yes, they have. I used slang
12	dictionaries to look at this, and you can get -- you
13	know, in libraries they have old copies of books. And
14	I've looked at slang dictionaries that -- that discuss
15	the origins of slang in the 19th century, which,
16	especially in relation to cigarettes, is particularly
17	relevant.
18	BY MR. DAVIS:
19	Q. Were -- let me back up and ask you a couple of
20	follow-up questions.
21	Were slang terms used for cigarettes?
22	A. Yes, they were.
23	Q. And when slang terms were used, what was the
24	context by which the slang was being used? I mean, what
25	was the slang term -- slang term trying to convey about
68
1	cigarettes?
2	A. The slang terms, all of the ones that I saw and
3	all of the ones I found in historical thesauruses and
4	slang dictionaries communicated the hazards of smoking.
5	Some of these we wouldn't be familiar with today because
6	they're really old-fashioned, like gasper and lung dust
7	and brain pill, all kinds of very now archaic terms.
8	One term that actually has stayed with us more
9	or less -- it's one of the longest of the terms in
10	use -- is "coffin nails." Now, coffin nails is one that
11	goes back to the 19th century and partly because of the
12	invention of -- in the Industrial Revolution the
13	invention of cigarette-producing machines. And so
14	cigarettes would be rolled and look very uniform, unlike
15	a hand-rolled cigarette, which would be kind of lumpy.
16	And so they looked more and more like nails. And so
17	they would say, every cigarette's a nail in your coffin
18	or in the coffin.
19	And by the way, actually in our depositions
20	Rickey Maheu, one of the deponent's stepson, said that
21	was a term. And he actually quoted that phrase. A
22	cigarette -- a coffin nail means every cigarette's
23	another nail in the coffin. But it's a very old term.
24	Q. Yeah. And let's look at Slide 17 quickly.
25	This is kind of a slide that kind of shows the
69
1	different types of -- some of the types of pop culture
2	that you talked about earlier?
3	A. That's right.
4	Q. All right. And then let's go to 18. Do you
5	have a slide that shows that -- the use of slang terms
6	for cigarette smoking?
7	A. Yes, now, these are more modern terms that many
8	people would recognize, and many of the deponents
9	recognized and had used. So coffin nails, cancer
10	sticks, nicotine addict, nic fit, I'm having a nicotine
11	fit, or I need a nic fix. So that's the way those were
12	used. A chain smoker, meaning a person who smokes one
13	cigarette right after the other in a chain. Someone
14	might say they were hooked on cigarettes. Those are all
15	slang terms.
16	Now, let me point out that none of these have
17	the word "cigarette" in them. A coffin nail doesn't say
18	cigarette. Cancer stick doesn't say tobacco or
19	cigarette. So that's why slang is very revealing of
20	knowledge and information, because people can say cancer
21	stick, and the person they're talking to understands
22	that it's about a cigarette, that it is a stick shape,
23	and that it will give you cancer or may give you cancer.
24	Q. You mentioned earlier some of -- you mentioned
25	some deposition testimony from Rickey Maheu,
70
1	Mr. Ellsworth's stepson. Based upon your research and
2	for this case, did you find evidence that Mr. Ellsworth
3	or his friends or family were familiar with any of these
4	slang terms, other than Mr. Maheu?
5	A. Yes.
6	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
7	BY MR. DAVIS:
8	Q. Who do -- who do you remember talking about some
9	of these slang terms in their depositions?
10	A. Other deponent --1 can't recall offhand. I'm
11	thinking that Carole Maheu might have, but I just don't
12	have the list in front of me. But certainly others were
13	asked and responded that they had heard the term.
14	Mr. Maheu said he actually used the term with his
15	stepfather, David Ellsworth.
16	Q. So when looking at it, let's say -- let's
17	look -- let's take, for example, coffin nails. You
18	mentioned that this slang term goes back to the turn of
19	the century, back to the late nineteen -- late 1900s,
20	early two -- early 2000s -- early 20th century.
21	A. Early 20th century.
22	Q. Right. Let me -- let me see if I can straighten
23	this up.
24	You mentioned earlier that the use of the term
25	"coffin nail" goes back to the late 19th century, early
71
1	20th century. What is that -- the fact that these -- a
2	slang term such as that be -- the fact that it's being
3	used, what does that convey to you, as a historian,
4	based upon your review of the historical record?
5	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
6	THE WITNESS: The use of a term like "coffin
7	nails," the fact that it goes back to the 1880s and was
8	used through -- you know, all through the last century
9	and into this century, what that tells me is that the --
10	that this information was embedded very deeply in
11	American popular culture, that knowledge of the hazards
12	that this is so dangerous that it could kill you, that
13	you would be buried in a coffin that was nailed down
14	with cigarettes.
15	BY MR. DAVIS:
16	Q. In terms of information kind of being embedded
17	into the -- the -- the American culture about --
18	concerning the slang term of coffin nails, did you
19	have -- did you bring a slide that showed -- that
20	depicted an example of that?
21	A. Yes, I did.
22	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 19.
23	Professor Hoffman, tell us what this slide is
24	and what it shows.
25	A. This is -- this slide is from a cartoon. It was
1	a series of cartoons, actually, about how hard it is to
2	quit smoking but how important it is to quit smoking,
3	and this was in Life magazine, which at that time was
4	the glossiest, prettiest, biggest magazine that you
5	could get. And it's important to remember this is
6	before there was even color TV, so things that were in
7	color, magazines that were in color, were very
8	attractive, and Life was the biggest. And it showed
9	that around the time the American Cancer Society was
10	releasing its big studies on cancer that these -- as it
11	says, "The Turn of the Century term 'coffin nail' comes
12	back." And the guy is not only in his coffin--coffin,
13	but he's sneaking out to have another cigarette. So
14	it's -- the message there is that they're using humor to
15	say that smoking is very difficult to quit and -- but
16	that you should.
17	Q. Now, in what year was this -- this car— did
18	this cartoon appear?
19	A. This appeared in 1954.
20	Q. Okay. And for the record, that's AIW_225,
21	exhibit number.
22	You mentioned music as another part of popular
23	culture that you research -- researched. Did you
24	uncover any evidence about what kind of music
25	Mr. Ellsworth liked?
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. What was that kind of music?
3	A. Well, a number of the depositions said that his
4	favorite kind of music was country music, and he hiked
5	it very much.
6	Q. Have the health risks of smoking been the topic
7	of songs?
8	A. Yes, they have.
9	Q. Can you give us a few examples?
10	A. Well, the -- one is the mov— pardon me -- the
11	song "Smoke Smoke Smoke." More recently there was a
12	K.D. Lang song. She's a country western star. Other
13	groups, The Who, there's a list of them.
14	Q. Who sang the song Smoke -- originally sang the
15	song -- song "Smoke Smoke Smoke" --
16	A. The-
17	Q. --"that Cigarette"?
18	A. The song "Smoke Smoke Smoke That Cigarette" was
19	originally recorded by Tex Williams.
20	Q. And was he a country music star at the time?
21	A. Yes. He was a very big country music star. In
22	fact, he was one of the first crossover country western
23	folks. And -- and his song rose to the top, not only on
24	the country charts, but of the pop charts. So it was a
25	very, very popular song for many years, in fact,
1	decades.
2	Q. And what's the -- how does the album cover
3	describe the song that -- "Smoke Smoke Smoke That
4	Cigarette" ?
5	A. Well, the -- the album I think was originally
6	released as a -- what do they call it, a 45? Forgetting
7	that term. We're getting now to -- the little tiny old
8	records. But then it was later reissued, and I got a
9	copy of -- in 1960. It originally came out in the
10	'40s, and then it was reissued, and it's -- on the back
11	of it, it says that, "Ever since Sir Walter Raleigh
12	picked up that old Indian habit of inhaling hot
13	nicotine, the tobacco growers of the world have chanted,
14	'smoke smoke smoke that cigarette.' In the year 1947,
15	however, Tex Williams turned that phrase into a singing
16	sermon that showed how excessive smoking could enlarge
17	one's circle of acquaintances, like you could meet St.
18	Peter personally," meaning St. Peter, of course, at the
19	pearly gates, you could die as a result of smoking. So
20	this was, you know, one example of that. But it was
21	also recorded by other singing stars.
22	Q. I was going to ask you that. Was it -- it
23	was -- was Tex Williams the only one that recorded
24	"Smoke Smoke Smoke That Cigarette"?
25	A. No. It's been recorded and rerecorded, and it
75
1	may be someone will record it again tomorrow. I don't
2	know. It's recorded very frequently.
3	Q. Did you bring here today a compilation of the
4	song for us to listen to?
5	A. I did. I wanted the jury to see the various
6	artists who have made this a very popular hit over a
7	long period of time.
8	Q. Now, before we play the song, can you describe
9	what we're about to hear and how it relates to the
10	dangers of cigarette smoking?
11	A. Well, what this song communicates is how hard it
12	is to quit smoking, that it's a -- it's a very dangerous
13	habit, that the people who are looking upon the smoker,
14	you know, are frustrated with that person. And it uses
15	humor because that's what popular culture does. It's
16	not --it's not your teacher standing at the front of
17	the -- the school classroom, and it's not a judge
18	sitting in a courtroom. So it -- it talks about
19	addiction and hazards and the fact that it shortens your
20	life.
21	Q. All right. We'll play the compilation right
22	now. It's Exhibit AIW_149.
23	(An audio clip was played:
24	Now, I'm a fellow with a heart of gold and the
25	ways of a gentleman, I've been told, a kind of a guy
76
1	that wouldn't even harm a flea. But if me and a certain
2	character met, that guy that invented that cigarette,
3	I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree.
4	That ain't 'cause I don't smoke myself, and I
5	don't reckon they injure your health. I've smoked 'em
6	all my life, and I ain't dead yet. But them nicotine
7	slaves, they're all the same. At a pettin' parties or a
8	poker game, everything's gotta stop while they have a
9	that cigarette.
10	Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette. Puff puff
11	puff. And if you smoke yourself to death, tell St.
12	Peter at the Golden Gate that you hate to make him wait,
13	but you just gotta have another cigarette.)
14	THE WITNESS: I might add that I've also seen
15	another version of this, which was performed on Hee Haw,
16	which was a -- and the Grand Ole Opry, which were
17	favorite shows of Mr. -- Mr. David Ellsworth, according
18	to testimony in the depositions.
19	BY MR. DAVIS:
20	Q. As part of your research for this case, did you
21	see any evidence that Mr. Ellsworth belonged to a
22	particular religion?
23	A. Yes, I did.
24	Q. And what was Mr. Ellsworth's religion -- strike
25	that.
77
1	Why was Mr. Ellsworth's religion significant to
2	you, as a historian?
3	A. Mr. Ellsworth's religion was significant to me
4	because that's yet another of the avenues by which
5	people learn things. People spend time in church if
6	they are churchgoers and -- and will hear literally
7	sermons about things you should and shouldn't do. And
8	there were two or three deponents who spoke about this,
9	his brother with whom he went to church regularly as a
10	boy growing up. They went to an Elmwood Congregational
11	Baptist Church in Providence, Rhode Island, which, as I
12	said, you know, this was actually where Baptists
13	started, in Providence.
14	Rhode Island became a colony because Roger
15	Williams -- Roger Williams was kicked out of
16	Massachusetts Bay Colony, and -- because he was a
17	Baptist. So this idea of freedom of religion is very
18	deeply built into Rhode Island.
19	And after he left Rhode Island, and when he had
20	a stepson, he took his stepson, and they also attended
21	church regularly in Miami, attended a Baptist
22	Congregation there.
23	Q. Do you have a slide that discusses -- let me
24	back up.
25	In your research have you seen information from
78
1	the Baptist Church that discusses the risks of smoking?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Do you have a slide that discusses that
4	information?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 21.
7	Professor Hoffman, can you tell us what's
8	depicted on Slide 21 and what -- why is it signif—
9	significant to your opinions?
10	A. What's depicted in this slide are -- are just a
11	few of the many, many dozens of -- dozens and dozens of
12	articles I could show you that come out of the Baptist
13	faith. On the left-hand side --1 want to give you a
14	sampling. On the left-hand side is something from 1952,
15	and it was a doctor's column that ran in the Baptist
16	Junior Union Quarterly. It says, "Tobacco hurts the
17	body. A cigarette contains poisons too," again, that
18	use of the word. "Medical tests have proved many
19	doctors think that much cancer of the mouth, lips, and
20	throat is caused from smoking." So that was in 1952,
21	very early on.
22	On the right-hand side, you see something from
23	the '60s. And by the way, this was -- this came out
24	after the Surgeon General's report of 1964. And this
25	editorial in another Baptist publication called Home
79
I	Life, it says, "The public generally has long known" --
2	so 1965, but they're saying, "The public has long known
3	that the use of tobacco in any form is physically
4	harmful, filthy, and a costly habit. It doesn't take a
5	scientific report to discover that. By and large, those
6	who smoke have known the dangers and have practiced the
7	vice with their eyes open."
8	Q. So again, to summarize, why was that significant
9	to you to look at this type of information issued by the
10	Baptist Church as it relates to David Ellsworth?
II	A. Well, it was important because in the historical
12	method you have a question, right, and the question is,
13	what information was David Ellsworth and his generation
14	exposed to about the harms of smoking? So to have left
15	his church out would have been improper because that was
16	one place, as it turns out, that the harms of smoking
17	were actually discussed very openly over many years.
18	Q. Now, and for the record, Slide 21 depicts
19	Exhibits AIW_175 and AFL_444.
20	Okay. As part of the research on pop culture
21	that you did for your opinions in this case, you also
22	mentioned magazines that you had reviewed. Is that
23	right?
24	A. That's correct.
25	Q. And from the 1920s to the 1940s, before
80
1	Mr. Ellsworth was bom or when he was just a child, was
2	any infomiation regarding the health dangers of smoking
3	made available to the public in the printed media?
4	A. Yes, it was.
5	Q. Okay. Did popular magazines cover the
6	developments regarding the health dangers of smoking in
7	the 1920s, the 1930s, and the 1940s?
8	A. Absolutely.
9	MR. KAISER: Fomi.
10	BY MR. DAVIS:
11	Q. What years did popular magazines cover the
12	health dangers of smoking?
13	MR. KAISER: Object to fomi.
14	THE WITNESS: Oh, popular magazines covered the
15	health dangers of smoking throughout the 19th century,
16	certainly throughout the earlier 20th century too, up
17	through the time that Mr. Ellsworth -- before his birth
18	and after his birth, throughout his lifetime, so for a
19	long, long time.
20	BY MR. DAVIS:
21	Q. Why are magazines an important source of
22	information for your research?
23	A. Magazines and newspapers are particularly
24	important if you're looking at anything from the early
25	20th century. This was before television, largely.
81
1	Television doesn't really come on board until the late
2	1940s. So magazines and newspapers are very important
3	to understanding what people saw. People read a great
4	deal more than they do now, at least in the form of
5	printed matter. So there was also, of course, radio,
6	and I have also come across discussions on radio of the
7	hazards of smoking too, but magazines were very
8	important.
9	Q. Earlier you mentioned Reader's Digest. What
10	kind of magazine is Reader's Digest?
11	A. Reader's Digest was the most popular magazine,
12	the most wildly distributed magazine in America
13	throughout the 20th century, early on and all through
14	the same period of time. President Eisenhower, who was
15	president when -- when Mr. Ellsworth was in the Marine
16	Corps, said that the Reader's Digest was a mirror of the
17	American character. At that time, by the early 1950s,
18	there were 30 million readers of the Reader's Digest.
19	It was printed in like -- if I recall right, 13
20	languages, including brail.
21	It was also important because Reader's Digest,
22	what it did, it digested information. So anything that
23	was in there was also somewhere else. It collected the
24	material that had already been published elsewhere, put
25	it in one format, and generally made the article shorter
82
1	and easier to read so that it was used -- you know,
2	people subscribed to it. They used it in doctor's
3	office. As I mentioned, the Providence, Rhode Island,
4	schools authorized it for use in the schools. It was
5	very credible, very widely respected, and very, very
6	widely read.
7	Q. In the 1950s what was the largest circulation --
8	strike that.
9	For the 1950s which magazine had the largest
10	circulation of any magazine?
11	A. Reader's Digest had the largest circulation of
12	any magazine in the United States and any magazine in
13	the world.
14	Q. And are you familiar with the figures from 1950
15	which show the circulation rate for Reader's Digest --
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. -- in U.S. households?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. What is that?
20	A. They printed and distributed between 10 to 12
21	million copies. That's a little different from
22	circulation figures because when a magazine goes to a
23	household, especially in this time when there aren't a
24	lot of other media outlets, they assumed that about
25	three people read every magazine. By the way, Reader's
83
1	Digest could also easily have had even a larger
2	circulation than that because it was very common to find
3	it in doctors' offices. So it would be read and reread
4	and, of course, in libraries read many times over.
5	Q. Did Reader's Digest publish articles about the
6	health risks of smoking before and during
7	Mr. Ellsworth's lifetime?
8	A. Yes, they did.
9	Q. And what kinds of information did --
10	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
11	BY MR. DAVIS:
12	Q. What kind of -- kinds of information did
13	Reader's Digest articles have on the issue of cigarette
14	smoking?
15	A. Reader's Digest had a wide variety of
16	information on hazards of smoking. They discussed
17	cancer. They discussed, you know, consequences for
18	respiratory disease, heart disease. They talked a lot
19	about what we would call addiction or the habit-forming
20	character of smoking. And they also talked a lot about
21	quitting and the importance of quitting if you had
22	started.
23	Q. How far back in time did Reader's Digest cover
24	the health risks of cigarette smoking?
25	A. Well, Reader's Digest was started in the early
84
1	1920s, and they started covering it right away. This
2	was something about which the -- the owners and
3	publishers of Reader's Digest actually cared a lot
4	about, so they covered it extensively very early on.
5	Q. Do you have a slide here that shows some of the
6	articles that were published in Reader's Digest in the
7	1920s and 1940s?
8	A. Yes, I do.
9	Q. Okay. Let's go to Slide 22. And for the
10	record, that's AIW_117, AIW_130, AIW_137, AIW_140,
11	AIW_142, and AIW_148.
12	Now, Professor Hoffman, can you tell us what's
13	depicted here with respect to articles on the -- from
14	Reader's Digest in the 1920s and 1940s?
15	A. Yes. In this slide what it shows is -- the
16	first slide, the call-out quote is from the very first
17	article that I found in Reader's Digest in -- you know,
18	beginning in nineteen --in this case, 1924. The
19	magazine started in 1922. And it asks the question,
20	"Does tobacco injure the human body?" So they asked it
21	as a question, and then the whole article basically goes
22	to answer the question. In one paragraph it says it
23	directly. "Tobacco is injurious to the human body." It
24	goes on to list -- it says, "It lessens resistance to
25	tuberculous and other diseases. Its use sometimes
85
1	induces cancer, and it probably shortens life."
2	The other articles, you know, again, they have
3	all different -- all the articles talk about different
4	things. The next one you see the headline on giving up
5	smoking. The next one talks about, "So you're going to
6	stop smoking." Another one talks about, "I quit
7	smoking." And by the way, that particular article was,
8	I guess, very popular, because they reprinted it several
9	times.
10	Then one in the bottom, in the middle, "Nicotine
11	knockout or the slow count," talks about the hazards of
12	nicotine, its -- its habit-forming character, the damage
13	it does to the body. Again, another one on the right
14	talks about the importance of smoking. "Are you a man
15	or a smokestack? It's going to take a lot of willpower,
16	but you can do it."
17	Q. What did your research reveal about the use of
18	Reader's Digest in Providence, Rhode Island, schools?
19	A. This was authorized for use. There were just a
20	handful of newspapers and magazines authorized for use
21	in the schools, and this was one of them I found in the
22	school records.
23	Q. Was Reader's Digest authorized or approved for
24	use in the schools that David Ellsworth attended in
25	Providence, Rhode Island?
86
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. In your opinion, what did the titles of these
3	articles show about the way Reader's Digest was
4	presenting information on the risks and dangers of
5	cigarette smoking?
6	A. What these articles and their headlines
7	indicated to me as I read them was that the message was
8	very clear that smoking is hazardous, that people
9	shouldn't smoke. If they do smoke, they should quit
10	because it can otherwise -- as it says right there, it
11	can shorten their life.
12	Q. Is this slide representative of the kind of
13	information that Reader's Digest was providing to the
14	public about the dangers of smoking?
15	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
16	THE WITNESS: Oh, absolutely. I mean, this was
17	the most widely read magazine in America, and everything
18	it printed -- absolutely everything was about the harms
19	of smoking.
20	BY MR. DAVIS:
21	Q. Did Reader's Digest contain any advertisements
22	for cigarettes?
23	A. No. Reader's Digest made an early decision
24	never to care -- pardon me -- never to carry any tobacco
25	ads. So those 30 million readers would not have been
87
1	seeing any tobacco ads alongside or anywhere near these
2	articles. So they carried no art— no ads whatsoever
3	on smoking or alcohol.
4	Q. All right. I want to move forward a little bit
5	in time to when Mr. Ellsworth was an adult. In the
6	1950s did other magazines, in addition to Reader's
7	Digest, begin covering the dangers of cigarette smoking?
8	A. Yes, they did.
9	Q. What other -- what other magazines did you
10	research that showed that those magazines were covering
11	the dangers of cigarette smoking?
12	A. Well, I --1 focused on national magazines
13	because I wanted to look at the magazines that would
14	have been available, you know, broadly to -- across the
15	United States but also, of course, very -- very much so
16	in Providence, Rhode Island, as well as Miami, Florida,
17	or any of the places that he subsequently lived.
18	Q. And in terms of some of the magazines that were
19	discussing the dangers of cigarette smoking, what were
20	they?
21	A. Well, some of the magazines I looked at, for
22	example, included Newsweek because that was one of the
23	two that were approved for use in Providence, Rhode
24	Island. So Newsweek is a national news magazine. It's
25	probably No. 2 to TIME magazine, which I also looked at
88
1	because that was considered the No. 1 general news
2	magazine. I also looked at Life magazine. As I said
3	before, that was a very important and very popular, what
4	they call photojournalism magazine, from the mid 20th
5	century.
6	Q. Do you have an example from Newsweek magazine in
7	the 1950s that -- which had an article discussing the
8	risks of cigarette smoking?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. All right. Let's see if we can show that one.
11	That's Exhibit -- excuse me, it's Slide 23, and it's
12	Exhibit AIW_170.
13	Professor Hoffman, can you tell us what it is
14	that's being depicted here on this slide?
15	A. Yes. Now, this is an article from Newsweek.
16	Again, I could show you many, many more. And then
17	that's important for the jury to know, especially
18	because these are representative samples. And this
19	particular case was from June 1950. That's when
20	Mr. Ellsworth would have been 16 years old. That's
21	around the time that he dropped out of school. But it
22	was in use in Providence, Rhode Island, as we've
23	discussed. And this particular article is all about
24	essentially the American Cancer Society and these new
25	studies that were coming out about lung cancer. And it
89
1	says, "Statistics show that the more heavily a person
2	smokes, the greater are his chances of being afflicted
3	with lung cancer." The whole article is about lung
4	cancer. That's why I had to put that in there, so you'd
5	understand. But that's what the article is about.
6	Q. And who -- who were the scientists who had
7	conducted the study that this article talks about?
8	A. Well, these are, again, British and American
9	scientists, Hammond and Horn and Graham and Wynder and
10	Doll and Hill, et cetera.
11	Q. Okay.
12	A. I don't --1 don't remember the specific
13	emphasis, but that's that period of time where those
14	first studies were all coming out.
15	Q. And why -- why was this -- why are articles such
16	as the one in Slide 23 of significance to you in terms
17	of your opinions in the case?
18	A. They're significant because my question was,
19	what hazards, what information about the hazards of
20	smoking was the public exposed to and Mr. Ellsworth
21	exposed to during this period of time. So the fact that
22	Newsweek was used in the schools and also that was
23	widely read amongst adults would show that this is --
24	you know, this is a very high level of information about
25	hazards, including specifically lung cancer.
1	Q. Did magazines like Newsweek ever address the
2	addictive nature of cigarette smoking in the 1950s?
3	A. Yes, they did, very commonly.
4	Q. And did you bring an example of some articles
5	that discuss that issue?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 24. And for the
8	record, that's AIW_176 and ANS_2896.
9	And, Professor Hoffman, if you could tell us
10	what this slide depicts and why it was of significance
11	to you -- to your opinions.
12	A. Well, these were two articles that talked about,
13	amongst others, about the addictive character of
14	smoking, the fact that it was really hard to stop. And
15	again, in this period of time the word like "addiction"
16	is used interchangeably with "habit forming." And
17	again, sometimes it's still the case, even words like
18	"enslaving" creep in, although by now, the mid 20th
19	century, the vernacular, the popular word choices begin
20	to change.
21	The one on the left, it said, "The psychological
22	urge is reinforced by a pharmacological urge, the true
23	physical craving for tobacco." So this was about
24	nicotine and again alerting readers that this was
25	dangerous. So this would have been right after he
1	joined the Marines. And on the right-hand, side we see
2	in Newsweek another article talking about it. It says,
3	"Smoking is a most serious sort of drug addiction and
4	with a real psychological basis." So both of them were
5	emphasizing drugs as, in fact, the schoolbooks, of
6	course, had done as well, talking about nicotine as a --
7	as a drug, as a narcotic in the case of the schoolbooks.
8	Q. Did you find other examples of magazines that
9	ran stories about the -- the dangers of smoking in the
10	1950s?
11	A. Yes, many.
12	Q. And did you bring some examples of those to
13	discuss as well?
14	A. Yes, just a couple.
15	Q. All right. Let's talk about some of the
16	representative magazine articles that you brought.
17	Let's go to Slide 25, and it's AIW_180, AIW_266.
18	Professor Hoffman, can you tell us what's shown
19	on this slide and why it was of significance to you to
20	talk about this one as a representative?
21	A. Right. Well, TIME magazine covered this story,
22	so to speak, very extensively. Again, it's sort of the
23	gold standard of the news magazines in this era. TIME
24	would have the man of the year and things like that, so
25	people really looked at TIME magazine and looked up to
1	TIME magazine.
2	In this case the article on the left talks
3	about, again, these studies that were coming out very
4	rapidly, many, many studies, thousands, in fact, of
5	studies in the 1950s. This particular one it says on
6	the left-hand side, "There's a definite, definite
7	relationship between smoking and lung cancer."
8	On the right-hand side, again, this is just yet
9	another article. And this particular one is about the
10	American Cancer Society study of 1957. It says,
11	"There's an increasing and consistent body of evidence
12	that excessive cigarette smoking is one of the causative
13	factors in lung cancer."
14	Now, one reason I wanted to -- to bring these
15	particular ones is that one thing I was very interested
16	to discover that had a lot of significance for my
17	professional findings is you see -- in fact, I had it
18	circled on the slide. It's circled in red on the one
19	hand -- left-hand side. It says, "Smoking and cancer."
20	On the right-hand side I circled it because it says,
21	"Smoking and cancer continued." Now, by the way, when
22	it says "continued," it's not continued from an earlier
23	page in that edition of the magazine. What I found was
24	that over a seven-year period, from 1952 to 1959, that
25	this topic came up so much that TIME magazine started to
93
1	use the same headline. It would say, "Smoking and
2	cancer, continued," as if to suggest that, hey, this is
3	the story we've been talking about and talking about,
4	and here's another installment in that story. So again,
5	this was not from an earlier page in that same magazine.
6	It was from the other articles that they had -- readers
7	had already seen.
8	Q. You mentioned Life magazine earlier. Were
9	stories about the dangers of smoking also covered in
10	Life?
11	A. Yes, they were --
12	Q. And what kind magazine was Life during the 1950s
13	and 1960s?
14	A. Life magazine was published by Henry Luce. It
15	was considered the glossiest, most beautiful, most
16	prominent photojournalism magazine. People often used
17	it as a coffee table magazine. Later on and even today,
18	Life published coffee table books. But Life magazine
19	preceded those books. Later the books were compiled
20	from those magazines. And so it was widely read. In
21	fact, he was the person who called -- said the United
22	States -- called the 20th century the American century.
23	So I say that partly because --to indicate the level of
24	respect that was held for Life magazine.
25	Q. Okay.
94
1	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Excuse me, Counsel. I'm
2	sorry to interrupt. I have to take a break to change
3	the media.
4	MR. DAVIS: Okay. That's fine.
5	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Okay. Off the record, the
6	time is 11:43 a.m. This marks the end of Media No. 1.
7	(Off record)
8	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the record.
9	The time is 12:05 p.m. This marks the beginning of
10	Media No. 2.
11	MR. DAVIS: All right. And Allan and Chris, if
12	there's an issue again with hearing the test— the
13	question or the answers, please let us know, and we'll
14	do the best we can. Okay?
15	MR. KAISER: I will. I just --1 hated to
16	interrupt, but if I can't hear, I'll let you know.
17	MR. DAVIS: Thank you.
18	BY MR. DAVIS:
19	Q. All right. Now, Professor Hoffman, we were
20	dealing with and discussing the Life magazine, and --
21	when we took a break. And did you find articles in Life
22	magazine that discussed the -- the dangers of smoking in
23	the 1950s?
24	A. I did.
25	Q. Did you bring some representative examples of
95
1	those articles with you here today?
2	A. I did.
3	Q. All right. And do we have a slide that shows
4	those -- one of those articles?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 26, and this is
7	Exhibit No. AS_999.
8	Professor Hoffman, can you tell us what this
9	slide shows and why this article was of significance to
10	you in your research?
11	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
12	THE WITNESS: This particular article was very
13	significant because it -- it was about one of the very
14	first studies which came up with what scientists at that
15	time were calling biological evidence for the
16	carcinogenic character of cigarettes and of tobacco and
17	nicotine. And so in this particular article, it talked
18	about the very famous study by Evarts Graham and Ernst
19	Wynder, in which they took distillates from tobacco
20	smoke -- smoke, tars and resins, and that's when that
21	phrase started to come out very clearly in the language,
22	although we also saw it in student textbooks even before
23	that, but tars and resins, and they would paint them on
24	the backs of mice. And that was a very a famous and,
25	you know, very well-publicized study that is shown in
96
1	this particular issue of Life magazine.
2	BY MR. DAVIS:
3	Q. With respect to the magazine articles that you
4	have shown us in the 1950s that discuss the risk and
5	dangers of smoking, the ones that we've shown the jury,
6	are those the only ones that existed in magazines in the
7	1950s?
8	A. No.
9	MR. KAISER: Form.
10	THE WITNESS: Not at all. There were dozens,
11	hundreds, ultimately thousands upon thousands of
12	articles about the hazards. And simply for the purposes
13	of time, it's not feasible for me to show the jury or
14	you all of the examples that I could. So I try to get
15	things which are representative, and did do that, and so
16	that's why, for the purposes of getting through the
17	material. But that's a part of the historical method.
18	It's very important to me as a professional that you are
19	seeing representative samples.
20	Q. You mentioned another source of information that
21	you looked at was newspapers. Is that right?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. And why were newspapers an important source for
24	you to consider concern -- concerning the conveyance of
25	information about the health risks of smoking in the
97
1	1940s and 1950s?
2	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
3	THE WITNESS: Newspapers at that time had a
4	different role, really, than -- than they even have
5	today. And that's something you could know from
6	historical context. Most cities had morning and evening
7	newspapers. Most people took the newspaper. Many
8	people took both newspapers. There wasn't -- again,
9	there wasn't the Internet. There weren't television
10	channels even, so very limited news coverage. A lot of
11	people took the newspaper.
12	Also, we know from the deposition testimony
13	that -- that the -- that Mr. Ellsworth's family
14	subscribed to the Providence newspaper and took that
15	newspaper in the home and that his father read it every
16	day. We do know that -- again from testimony, that
17	Mr. Ellsworth became a regular consumer of newspapers
18	throughout his entire adult life. Every town he lived
19	in, he subscribed to the newspaper. So it was important
20	as a general avenue for information to the public, but
21	it also had particular relevance for this case.
22	BY MR. DAVIS:
23	Q. So did you select the newspapers for your
24	research that were -- that would be a part of
25	Mr. Ellsworth's growing up and a part of his life?
98
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. All right. And what newspapers were those that
3	you selected to look at?
4	A. Well, the newspapers I looked at were the ones
5	primarily in Providence, Rhode Island; later in Miami;
6	and later on than that, in DeLand, Florida; as well
7	Orlando because he also read the Orlando paper, which is
8	nearby to DeLand.
9	Q. In the 1940s and 1950s, were the dangers of
10	smoking covered in the newspapers around Providence,
11	Rhode Island, where Mr. Ellsworth grew up?
12	A. Yes. The haz—
13	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
14	THE WITNESS: The hazards were covered even
15	before Mr. Ellsworth got out of school.
16	BY MR. DAVIS:
17	Q. Did you bring some representative examples of
18	those newspaper articles?
19	A. I did.
20	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 27 and Exhibit
21	Nos. AR71 -- excuse me -- ARA_1155, ARA_1164, ARA_1165.
22	Professor Hoffman, can you tell us what is
23	depicted on Slide 27 and why it is representative of
24	what you found?
25	A. Well, this is that period of time in which the
99
1	very specific hazard of lung cancer begins to come into
2	the newspapers. And after this -- before this period of
3	time, there are other kinds of references to harms, but
4	at this time lung cancer becomes preeminent. As you see
5	in the upper left-hand, this is from the Providence
6	Journal. It says, "Excessive cigarette smoking held
7	important factor in lung cancer." On the right-hand
8	side, "Cigarettes held factor in lung cancer." Below
9	that, another one from 1950, so 1949, 1950, "Cancer
10	blood test almost 100 percent right." And the call-out
11	quote from that particular one says, "Three teams of
12	scientists today blamed smoking, especially cigarettes,
13	for apparently causing part of the increase in lung
14	cancer, the fastest growing type of cancer in the United
15	States."
16	Q. And was the -- these articles were published in
17	what newspaper?
18	A. The Providence Journal and the Providence
19	Evening Bulletin. So again, that -- what you see there
20	is that a lot of studies -- Providence in not a big
21	town, even though, you know, it's right there in Rhode
22	Island, but --
23	Q. What times of days were these newspapers
24	delivered to the -- the people who subscribed to them?
25	A. Well, there were morning and afternoon
100
1	newspapers, they were called.
2	Q. Okay. And, like, were these the only articles
3	warning about the dangers of smoking that were published
4	in Mr. Ellsworth's hometown newspaper in Providence,
5	Rhode Island?
6	A. No.
7	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
8	THE WITNESS: No, but these were the earliest
9	ones I found on lung cancer.
10	BY MR. DAVIS:
11	Q. Did Mr. Ellsworth's hometown papers continue to
12	publish articles warning of the dangers of smoking
13	throughout the 1950s?
14	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
15	THE WITNESS: Yes, they did. I did not look at
16	them beyond roughly 1952, however, because that's when
17	he left Providence.
18	BY MR. DAVIS:
19	Q. And you mentioned earlier that you reviewed
20	Mr. Ellsworth's military records?
21	A. Yes, I did.
22	Q. What do Mr. Ellsworth's military records show
23	about what job responsibilities he had in the Marines?
24	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
25	THE WITNESS: Mr. Ellsworth's service in the
101
1	Marines, he was what they call a procurement clerk. So
2	he -- supply clerk, basically. It was related to the
3	job he had before he went into the Marines. It has been
4	testified in some of the testimony that he was a clothes
5	folder. He worked for a clothing company in Providence
6	for a short time after he dropped out of school and
7	before he joined the Marines. He appears to have held a
8	similar job as a supply clerk in the Marines.
9	BY MR. DAVIS:
10	Q. Do Mr. Ellsworth's military records show the
11	dates that he was in the military?
12	A. They do.
13	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
14	BY MR. DAVIS:
15	Q. What do they show in that -- with respect to the
16	dates that he was in the military?
17	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
18	THE WITNESS: The military records show that
19	he -- he signed up, and I believe it was January of
20	1952. He joined the Marines in February of 1952. So
21	that was very shortly before he turned 18. Then he
22	served for approximately three years. He was discharged
23	in 1955 in Miami. He actually had some of his service
24	in Miami, and then when he was discharged, he
25	apparently -- he liked it enough to come back there and
102
1	stay permanently.
2	BY MR. DAVIS:
3	Q. Did the -- did the military have a newspaper
4	that was published to servicemen and women during the
5	time period that Mr. Ellsworth was in the Marines?
6	A. Yes, they did. They had several publications,
7	but they in particular had a publication that they put
8	out for personnel who were stationed overseas. So there
9	was one year, for example, during Mr. Ellsworth's
10	service, from approximately June 1953 to the next July
11	1954, when he served in Japan and Korea. He was in both
12	places. We're not exactly sure how long in which spot.
13	But the newspaper that was made available to those
14	servicemen is called the Pacific Stars and Stripes.
15	Q. Okay. So do Mr. Ellsworth's military records
16	reflect that he was stationed outside the United States
17	between June of 1953 and July of 1954?
18	A. Yes. He was outside the U.S. for a whole year.
19	Q. Okay. And so when he was stationed overseas,
20	was Pacific Stars and Stripes the military newspaper
21	that was available to him?
22	A. Yes, it was.
23	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
24	BY MR. DAVIS:
25	Q. Did Pacific Stars and Stripes publish articles
103
1	on the dangers of smoking cigarettes when Mr. Ellsworth
2	was in the service, including --
3	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
4	BY MR. DAVIS:
5	Q. — when he was stationed outside the U.S. from
6	June 1953 until July 1954?
7	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
8	THE WITNESS: Stars and Stripes had pretty solid
9	coverage of the hazards of smoking, including the new
10	information about lung cancer, per se, before he was in
11	the service, after he was in the service, and during
12	that year that he was in the service in Korea and in
13	Japan.
14	BY MR. DAVIS:
15	Q. Do you have some examples of the articles from
16	the Pacific Stars and Stripes to show the jury?
17	A. Yes, I do.
18	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 28, and this shows
19	Exhibits AFL_899, AFL_900, AFL_901.
20	For starters, what is -- who's in the photograph
21	that is depicted in this slide, and where did you get
22	that photograph from?
23	A. This is a photograph I found in the military
24	records, which is the youngest picture I have, a picture
25	of Mr. Ellsworth at the youngest age that is available,
104
1	was available to me. So this shows him in his military
2	uniform when he became a Marine in 1952. So -- and this
3	is the information that surrounded him when he was
4	abroad, that is, and this shows the military newspaper
5	that was issued to sailors and -- or pardon me --
6	Marines and Amiy -- Amiy -- troops, et cetera.
7	And so here's some of the kinds of headlines.
8	"Nonsmokers said to outlive puffers." And so the idea
9	was that you should -- should be a nonsmoker.
10	On the bottom it shows an article -- actually
11	this is an article written by a health writer in the
12	United States, because Stars and Stripes often picked up
13	the same news, the same articles that were being
14	published in places like Miami and Providence. And this
15	shows an article that says, "Cigarette-cancer tie
16	found." You see that this is from June 1954. So that
17	was exactly when that first -- one of the first big ACS
18	Hammond and Horn studies was put out. So just being out
19	of the country didn't mean you weren't getting stuff.
20	They were actually getting the same kinds of information
21	citizens at home were.
22	On the upper right-hand, it talked about -- this
23	was an article that talked about "Smoker's hack,"
24	meaning smoker's cough, "can kill, New York doctors
25	say." And this article was about again the lung damage
105
1	and the fact that people could die very suddenly from --
2	you know, in middle life from the kinds of damage that
3	was done by -- to the respiratory system by smoking.
4	Q. Was the information in these articles and the
5	others that you found which linked smoking to lung
6	cancer, was that something that was hidden from
7	servicemen such as Mr. Ellsworth at the time that he was
8	in the service?
9	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
10	THE WITNESS: No, this wasn't hidden
11	information. In fact, the Stars and Stripes is--you
12	know, it's published by the U.S. Government, So this
13	was -- you know, they were educating servicemen about
14	hazards and encouraging them to quit.
15	BY MR. DAVIS:
16	Q. Are you familiar with what is called the Frank
17	Statement?
18	A. Yes, I am.
19	Q. Did what is called the Frank Statement run in
20	the Pacific Stars and Stripes?
21	A. No. The Frank Statement did not appear in the
22	Pacific Stars and Stripes. If it had, it would have
23	been in that -- right in that period of time that he was
24	away. So there was -- there was actually an article
25	that day, January 4th, I think that was, 1954, that
106
1	talked about smoking going down and cigarette use going
2	down because of the information about lung cancer.
3	Q. Yeah, so let me ask some follow-up questions
4	about that.
5	A. Uh-huh.
6	Q. When did the Frank Statement run in papers in
7	the United States?
8	A. I believe the date exact -- precise date was
9	January 4th, 1954.
10	Q. Was Mr. Ellsworth in the United States when the
11	Frank Statement ran in U.S. newspapers?
12	A. No.
13	Q. Were there any articles or stories in the
14	Pacific Stars and Stripes about smoking that ran on
15	January 4, 1954?
16	A. Yes. There was one story, as I mentioned.
17	Q. Can you describe what that story discussed?
18	A. That particular story was about the fact that
19	cigarette consumption had gone down. And I think --1
20	think it was off by a few percentage points. They said
21	it was the first time that cigarette consumption had
22	gone down in 23 years. So that was in the year 1953.
23	They were looking back on 1953 and seeing a decline as a
24	result, it appeared, of the publicity around the hazards
25	of smoking.
107
1	Q. Where was Mr. Ellsworth stationed right before
2	he was discharged from the service?
3	A. It appears from the record that he came back to
4	Miami.
5	Q. And after Mr. Ellsworth was discharged from the
6	service, where did he live?
7	A. Well, he was actually discharged in Miami, and
8	from the family depositions, it seems that he never left
9	Miami after that. He stayed on after 19 -- before and
10	after 1955, up until his death.
11	Q. Okay. What years did he live in Miami, Florida?
12	A. He lived in Miami, Florida, until approximately
13	1984, 1985. I just realized I meant to say he stayed in
14	Florida up until his -- until his death. But he lived
15	in Miami until approximately 1984, 1985.
16	Q. Okay. And when Mr. Ellsworth arrived in Miami,
17	were the dangers of cigarette smoking being publicized
18	there too?
19	A. Yeah.
20	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
21	THE WITNESS: The dangers of cigarette smoking
22	were being very heavily looked at and publicized in
23	Miami.
24	BY MR. DAVIS:
25	Q. Do you have examples from the Miami papers as
1	well that discuss the dangers of cigarette smoking in
2	the 1950s?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. All right. Do you have a slide that shows some
5	representative examples of what you found?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 29. This is
8	ALN_129, ALN_131, AFL - L - AFL_4065, ALN-134.
9	Professor Hoffman, can you tell us what is
10	depicted here and the newspapers that -- the newspaper
11	that it's depicted in?
12	A. Yes. These are all from the Miami Herald. And
13	the reason why I selected the Miami Herald, and I did
14	research in the Miami Herald in the Miami Public
15	Library, is because this was the paper that his family
16	said he always read. And, in fact, his children
17	remember reading it themselves. It was there apparently
18	on the kitchen table every day, and he would read it in
19	the morning over coffee and a cigarette is what I --
20	what I saw in the testimony. So I just wanted to give a
21	sampling of some of the kinds of articles that were
22	coming out very frequently on the hazards.
23	At the top left you see it says, "Smokers bad
24	risks, the doctors said" -- the quote from that
25	particular article says, "The evidence pointing to
1	smoking as a cause of lung cancer is overwhelming."
2	On the right-hand side, that's from 1955. You
3	see these are all from the mid-'50s. The one at the
4	right says, "Lung ruptures tied to cigarette smoking."
5	And there it says, "Cigarette smoking widely blamed for
6	lung cancer may be even more hazardous than has hitherto
7	been recognized." So they're talking there about the
8	effect on other organs: The stomach, the lungs, et
9	cetera.
10	On the bottom left the headline there is "Heavy
11	Smokers, Cancer Victims." On the right -- this -- the
12	right -- one on the right is kind of interesting because
13	it's a very typical headline that I saw frequently,
14	where it says, "Cigarettes blamed again for cancer." So
15	it's sort of like the TIME magazine article where they
16	say, "continued," or one more time this has been stated,
17	because there were thousands of studies in the 1050s.
18	They didn't all make it in the newspaper. But again and
19	again different ones, the more famous ones, were being
20	reported on.
21	Q. These headlines and articles discussing how
22	smokers are more likely to get cancer, was that hidden
23	from public view in Miami when Mr. Ellsworth lived in
24	Miami for much of his life?
25	A. No, it wasn't hidden. This information was in
1	plain view.
2	Q. Do have you more examples -- representative
3	examples of articles on the dangers of smoking in the
4	Miami Herald during the 1950s?
5	A. Yes, I do.
6	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 30. It is
7	Exhibits ALN_144, ALN_150, ALN_160.
8	And, Professor Hoffman, can you tell us what
9	this slide shows?
10	A. Yes. This shows again the variety of kinds of
11	articles that people were being exposed to. On the
12	upper left, the Miami Herald talked about the British
13	survey. And it's -- it's important to know again this
14	is context. This wasn't just in America that people
15	were talking about this. When I say that there were
16	thousands of studies that were done, and these studies
17	were later brought together into one place by the
18	Surgeon Generals of the U.S., these were studies being
19	conducted all over the world that were being publicized
20	here and used here.
21	So the British survey was on the left. It said,
22	"Lung cancer rise laid to smoking." On the upper
23	right-hand side, you say -- you see, "Cigarette-lung
24	cancer link seen by many smokers."
25	This particular article, by the way, was
111
1	columned by George Gallup, the famous pollster who was
2	very, very well known in the 1950s, and the Gallup poll
3	was asking smokers, Have you heard about that link?
4	On the bottom right you see another Miami Herald
5	article. Again, this was one of those articles that
6	talks about all the dangers. It mentions lung cancer,
7	but it also talks about the effect on the heart and
8	other major internal organs.
9	Q. How would you characterize the amount of
10	information discussed in the Miami Herald and other
11	Miami newspapers about the dangers of smoking?
12	A. I think that the best characterization is that
13	it was a massive amount of information. I know of no
14	other health issue about which there was such wide
15	information.
16	The other big issue at that time, by the way,
17	was polio, and there was the time during which the polio
18	vaccine was invented, was discovered, one might -- one
19	might say. So health news, science news, this was an
20	exciting time in the 1950s, where scientists were very
21	much respected for what they were bringing to public
22	knowledge.
23	Of course, polio, that information dies away.
24	That story doesn't really continue because of the
25	vaccine, where cigarette smoking and the hazards are a
112
1	huge story. In fact, these particular studies, the
2	American Cancer Society said -- in the 1950s the
3	American Cancer Society said these studies made
4	headlines from New York to Tokyo.
5	Q. All right. Let's look at -- did you have other
6	representative articles from the Miami Herald that talk
7	about the -- the risks of smoking?
8	A. I do, just -- a few more.
9	Q. Let's look at Slide 31, and it's ALN_153,
10	AFL_4069.
11	And, Professor Hoffman, can you tell us what the
12	significance of these articles are in terms of your
13	opinions?
14	A. Well, these again are just samples of a lot of
15	articles, and we don't have time for them all. On the
16	left-hand side I just wanted to show how this is
17	somebody who's less famous, but the other -- as I said,
18	lots of studies, and a physician there is talking on the
19	left about there is not any question or doubt that
20	cigarettes cause lung cancer, so there were physicians
21	who are putting forward that position very strongly,
22	very widely.
23	On the right-hand side you see a mention of the
24	Bible. The Bible warns us against the evils of the
25	smoking habit. This was actually Billy Graham's
113
1	syndicated column, a very, very well-known, very famous,
2	probably the most famous, Baptist preacher at this time
3	in America and for many decades. And someone was asking
4	him, Why don't you talk more about the harms of smoking?
5	Which he said, You know, as a Christian we shouldn't
6	smoke, because our bodies are our temples.
7	We do know from testimony that -- that
8	Mr. Ellsworth was baptized. His son tells us so. He
9	was a very important, active member of the church,
10	apparently. But Billy Graham said, "I don't need to
11	lecture about this as much as you may think," because as
12	he put it, quote, The medical profession has done an
13	excellent job in alerting the American public to the
14	dangers of smoking. And this was in 1959.
15	Q. And so earlier you -- you mentioned polls as a
16	source of information that you consider. Explain to the
17	jury, if you will, how you use polls as a professional
18	historian.
19	A. As a professional historian I've used polls on a
20	variety of moments in my career to measure all kinds of
21	public attitudes. Prior to the U.S. entry into World
22	War II, for example, I --1 went actually to the Gallup
23	polls again to look at American sentiment about the war.
24	I used --1 used Gallup polls in my most recent book,
25	looking at American attitudes towards the Cold War.
114
1	In this particular case I went as well to the
2	polls because polls are another layer of evidence. I
3	would never use them by themselves. But what they show
4	is it's -- it's one measure of what kind of information
5	was getting through to people and how they were
6	responding to that information.
7	Q. Are you familiar with what -- what are called
8	the Gallup polls?
9	A. Yes. As I mentioned, Gallup was probably the
10	most well-known pollster.
11	Q. And when you say "Gallup," are you referring to
12	George Gallup?
13	A. I'm referring to George Gallup.
14	Q. And what is the Gallup organization?
15	A. Well, George Gallup, the man, started the Gallup
16	organization. He's now deceased. But he became very
17	famous in the -- in the mid-1930s because he was the man
18	who predicted the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
19	And he had made a wager with the other preeminent
20	polling organization, and they blew it. They picked a
21	man probably most people will not recognize, Alf Landon.
22	And what Gallup showed was that if you used what
23	he called scientific polling to get a representative
24	sample of the public, that you could get a much better
25	and more accurate read on what actually people believed
115
1	or knew.
2	Q. Are Gallup polls considered reliable in your
3	field?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Are Gallup polls the type of information that --
6	which is reasonably relied upon by historians when
7	conducting research such as the research you did for
8	this case?
9	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
10	THE WITNESS: Absolutely. Historians use polls
11	extensively, what are considered the scientific polls,
12	of course, the very -- the gold start polls like Gallup
13	or like Roper.
14	BY MR. DAVIS:
15	Q. Did you find polling results from 1954 relating
16	to the public's awareness of the link between cigarette
17	smoking and lung cancer in your research?
18	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
19	THE WITNESS: Yes, I did find such polls.
20	BY MR. DAVIS:
21	Q. Let me -- what poll results did you find from
22	the 1950s that related to public awareness of the link
23	between cigarette smoking and lung cancer?
24	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
25	THE WITNESS: Because I was interested in
116
1	looking in pollings, I have spent a considerable amount
2	of time at Stanford University, and one of the resources
3	that they have there that my own university does not
4	have is access to the -- all the background information
5	on polls. So you can actually see not only the poll but
6	kind of the actual -- literally the forms upon which
7	pollsters were making their marks 50 or 60 years ago.
8	So I went to the Gallup polls, and I found that
9	there were questions that they were asking from the
10	early and mid-1950s up to the present about what people
11	had heard about the harms of smoking. So it was
12	directly related to the research I was doing.
13	BY MR. DAVIS:
14	Q. And what were the results -- was there a poll
15	conducted in the -- in the 1950s?
16	A. Yeah. There were several polls in the 1950s.
17	One of the most useful polls for -- to me were the ones
18	that were conducted in 1954, 1957, around the time that
19	these big reports, the reports that most of us -- or
20	many of us know about came out.
21	Q. Let's talk about the 1954 poll. What were the
22	results of that poll on the issue of awareness of the
23	link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer?
24	A. There -- the -- many, many people had heard -- a
25	very high percentage had heard about the link -- had
117
1	heard or read about the link between cigarette smoking
2	and lung cancer.
3	Q. And did you bring a slide that depicts the
4	results of this poll?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. Okay. Let's go to Slide 32, and it is Exhibit
7	AN_592.
8	Professor Hoffman, can you explain to us what --
9	what's depicted here and why it was of significance to
10	you?
11	A. Now, this particular poll, it was from June of
12	1954. And this poll asked the representative sample of
13	Americans, have you read -- pardon me -- have you heard
14	or read anything recently to the effect that cigarette
15	smoking may be a cause of cancer of the lung?
16	And I --1 emphasize the "heard" or "read"
17	because again, in this -- how we learn information, we
18	learn it a lot of different ways. Our parents might
19	have told us about the study, or you might have heard
20	neighbors discussing it, or a person could have picked
21	up the newspaper and read about.
22	What it found was this phenomenal figure, that
23	90 percent of Americans -- the vast, vast majority of
24	Americans, according to the poll -- had heard or read
25	about the link between cancer of the lung and cigarette
118
1	smoking.
2	Q. How does the result of this poll, the 90 percent
3	figure, compare to the public's knowledge of other
4	issues at the time?
5	A. Well, this was -- the amazing thing about this
6	poll, it was probably -- it's hard to think of any fact,
7	any fact, about which Americans were better informed
8	than about the link between lung cancer and cigarette
9	smoking.
10	Q. Did you bring a slide to illustrate that point?
11	A. I did.
12	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 33. It's AIW_201,
13	AHL_145, AIW_229, AN_592.
14	And, Professor Hoffman, tell us what's shown
15	here in terms of the -- the information about --
16	about -- about awareness of cigarette smoking that may
17	be a cause of lung cancer, compared to other information
18	that was -- that was out discussed in the public at the
19	time.
20	A. Well, this is where proportion and context are
21	important. And, in fact, the Gallup polls -- these
22	numbers are all from the Gallup polls because they
23	often -- George Gallup wanted to know in comparison to
24	another common fact -- you know, in order to be able to
25	make this statement that this is a remarkable figure, he
119
1	needed to know what people knew about other kinds of
2	things.
3	So as you see on the far left, one of the
4	questions was, "What are the three branches of the
5	federal government?" Now, most people who've taken
6	government are supposed to at least be able to say there
7	was the executive branch, the legislative branch, and
8	the judicial branch. But only 19 percent, one in five
9	Americans, could identify that correctly.
10	A third of Americans -- the next figure shows
11	that a third of Americans could identify that the first
12	ten amendments to our constitution are called the Bill
13	of Rights. It's a -- you know, it's supposed to be a
14	well-known fact in government classes.
15	The next question that Gallup asked was, "What's
16	the first book of the Bible?" And about a little less
17	than half Americans could correctly answer that that's
18	Genesis.
19	The next question, which again seemed very
20	common, people should be able to answer the question,
21	"Where was Jesus Christ bom?" And people -- most
22	people, it seems, should be able to say Bethlehem, but
23	apparently only 64 percent of Americans could answer
24	"Bethlehem."
25	When it came to the question, "Have you heard or
120
1	read that cigarette smoking may be a cause of lung
2	cancer?" 90 percent of Americans could answer yes.
3	Q. Did this poll assess educational -- let me back
4	up.
5	Did the poll that was conducted in 1954 about
6	whether you had heard or read recently that cigarette
7	smoking may be a cause of lung cancer, did that poll
8	assess the educational level of the participants of the
9	poll?
10	A. Yes, it did.
11	Q. And what did it --
12	A. Gallup -
13	Q. And what did it find?
14	A. Gallup wanted to make the polls representative.
15	All right. That's the only way that you could get a
16	scientific poll, if it was representative of the
17	population. And this was a period of time where a lot
18	of people did not complete high school, just as
19	Mr. Ellsworth did not complete high school. And, in
20	fact, in this particular poll in June of 1954, of the
21	respondents, those people who said 90 percent had heard
22	or read, 57 percent, the majority of people, had never
23	graduated from high school. So these were average
24	folks. And at that time "average" meant that you very
25	likely, good -- really good chance you had not graduated
121
1	high school.
2	Q. Okay. And one of the earlier scientific
3	studies -- let me back up.
4	What does that tell you as an historian?
5	A. Well, what that tells me is that the prevalence
6	of information about the hazards of smoking wasn't
7	limited to any special population group of highly
8	educated Americans, that this was information that was
9	out there that people talked about. They may have heard
10	it. They may have read it. But the overwhelming number
11	of Americans had heard about this connection in an -- an
12	extraordinarily broad-based way.
13	Q. One of the scientific studies you mentioned
14	earlier was the American Cancer Society study. When did
15	that -- did the American Cancer Society publish the
16	final results of the study?
17	A. Well, the American Cancer Society had started
18	this study in the early 1950s, and it was meant to be a
19	longitudinal study to follow people over time. But what
20	happened is that the results were so remarkable, that
21	they -- that they felt that they had to publish them
22	provisionally, and so they did a couple of times. But
23	the final study came out in 1957.
24	Q. Was that the -- the 1957 -- let me back up.
25	Were there any polling results connected with
122
1	the American Cancer Society study in 1957?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And was that the earlier study where you said
4	that you had looked at the 1957 poll? Did it -- did
5	that 1957 poll relate to the American Cancer Study?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. All right. Let's talk about that one. And did
8	you bring a slide that discusses the 1957 poll results?
9	A. Yes, I did.
10	Q. All right. Let's go to the next slide, Slide
11	34. AHL_ 145, AIW_258 are the exhibit numbers.
12	Professor Hoffman, can you describe this slide
13	for us?
14	A. Yes. This is showing the Gallup -- another
15	Gallup study. And it asks people, the people they were
16	interviewing, "Did you happen to hear or read about the
17	recent report of the American Cancer Society regarding
18	the reports of a study on the effects of cigarette
19	smoking?" So here they're asking something a little
20	more specific. They're not just saying, Have you heard
21	about people talking about this link between cancer
22	and -- lung cancer and smoking? They're saying, Did you
23	hear about this particular study about that subject?
24	And what it shows is that 82 percent of
25	cigarette smokers, which actually was a higher
123
1	percentage than nonsmokers, so cigarette smokers
2	reported hearing or reading about that study in somewhat
3	higher numbers than nonsmokers, very high number.
4	Q. Were the results of this poll published in the
5	Miami Herald, the newspaper that David Ellsworth read
6	while living in Miami?
7	A. Yes.
8	MR. KAISER: Objection to form.
9	THE WITNESS: Yes. The Miami Herald ran the
10	results of this Gallup poll. So not only was the poll
11	taken and available to people who were interested in
12	reading about polls, but George Gallup wrote a
13	syndicated column that was picked up in the Miami Herald
14	during the time that Mr. Ellsworth was a subscriber.
15	BY MR. DAVIS:
16	Q. All right. Let's -- let's move to Slide 35.
17	Is -- what -- what does Slide 35 reflect,
18	Professor Hoffman?
19	A. Slide 35 here is from the Miami Herald. It's
20	that article I was just mentioning. And it says -- and
21	this was written by George Gallup. And he says,
22	"Eighty-two percent of the cigarette smokers have heard
23	or read about the American Cancer Society report." And
24	as the headline shows, it also seems to be that
25	cigarette smoking is starting to decline a bit. It's --
124
1	these studies are having an impact on what people do.
2	Q. And for the record, it's -- Slide 35 relates to
3	Exhibit ARA_829.
4	You mentioned -- let me back up.
5	Were there any government officials addressing
6	the issue of public awareness or the dangers of smoking
7	in the 1950s?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. Who was the Surgeon General in the late 1950s?
10	A. Leroy Burney was the Surgeon General in the late
11	'50s.
12	Q. What did your research show about Surgeon
13	General Burney in the issue of public awareness of the
14	risks of cigarette smoking in the -- in the 1950s?
15	A. Leroy Burney was a very conscientious physician
16	and Surgeon General, and like his predecessor, who also
17	talked about the hazards, but Leroy Burney issued two
18	formal warnings to the American public about the hazards
19	of cigarette smoking, in particular its connection with
20	lung cancer.
21	Q. And do you remember the -- do you recall the
22	years that those publications -- that those
23	announcements were made?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. What -- what years?
125
1	A. Those were in 1957 and then again in 1959.
2	Q. All right. Let's talk about the one that was in
3	1957 by Surgeon General Burney. Do you have a slide
4	that reflects some of the statements -- a statement that
5	he made in connection with the public announcement?
6	A. I do.
7	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 36, and it's
8	AIW_3641.
9	Please tell us what's depicted on this slide.
10	A. Well, Leroy Burney was asked and actually
11	testified about their efforts. The public health
12	service, as I said, was very diligent, and he said that
13	quote, Our position is that we have informed the public
14	though the excellent coverage of the press, radio, and
15	TV.
16	So what I've show you are these press
17	announcements, but I have also seen him on television
18	clips, making the same announcements.
19	Q. So was his position about how the public had
20	been informed through excellent coverage of the press,
21	radio, and TV made public?
22	A. Oh, yes.
23	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
24	THE WITNESS: Yes. It was - he said this
25	publicly.
1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. Okay. And let's -- were there other public
3	health officials who made announcements about public
4	awareness at the time concerning the risk of cigarette
5	smoking?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Who else did -- who else did that?
8	A. Well, Dr. John Heller also actually testified to
9	Congress that -- that -- you know, they had done
10	everything they possibly could and that the results had
11	been very good from their point of view.
12	Q. Who was Dr. John Heller?
13	A. Dr. John Heller was head of the National Cancer
14	Institute, which the federal government had started in
15	the 1930s as -- you know, they were concerned about
16	people knowing more about cancer and -- and learning
17	about how to take charge of their own lives and -- and
18	avoid risks.
19	Q. What year Dr. Heller publicly address the issue
20	of public awareness of the risks of cigarette smoking?
21	A. Well, again, he had -- the National Cancer
22	Institute had been doing things all along. But in 1957,
23	very similar to Dr. Burney, he said, you know, Yes,
24	we're -- we're on top of this.
25	Q. And do you have a slide that depicts that --
Ill
1	that statement?
2	A. I do.
3	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 37. It's Exhibit
4	AIW_3641.
5	And again, what was the public statement that
6	Dr. Heller made?
7	A. Well, as you can see from this call-out, what he
8	said verbatim was, "Newspapers, radio, TV, and other
9	media have done an excellent job covering this problem,
10	and a very objective job. This is an exceedingly
11	valuable way of informing the public."
12	Now, one thing you can note here is, of course,
13	that this is in the 1950s, when for the first time
14	television is really online. So one of the things that
15	was very exciting to public health officials is that
16	they now could reach Americans in all different kinds of
17	ways, not just through the schools, not just through
18	churches, not just through Florida Health Notes, but
19	through the electronic media.
20	Q. Were the warnings -- warnings from public health
21	officials like Leroy Burney and Dr. John Heller covered
22	in these papers Mr. Ellsworth read?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. And was the Miami Herald, which Mr. Ellsworth
25	read, part of the excellent job done by the news media
1	in covering the dangers and risks of smoking?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Did that coverage by the Miami Herald cover
4	warnings by Surgeon General Burney?
5	A. Yes, it did.
6	Q. And did the coverage by the Miami Herald
7	specifically discuss how smoking cigarettes cause lung
8	cancer?
9	A. Yes, it did.
10	Q. Do we have a slide here that shows that issue
11	appearing in the Miami Herald?
12	A. Yes. I brought a slide for that.
13	Q. All right. Let's do that. Let's look at Slide
14	38. It's Exhibit AFL_892, ALN_172.
15	And, Professor Hoffman, please tell us what's
16	shown here.
17	A. Well, these are two articles -- these are the
18	articles that came out when Burney made his formal
19	announcement about the hazard of cigarette smoking. So
20	the one on the left is from 1957, and as he put it,
21	quote, There is an increasing and consistent body of
22	evidence that excessive cigarette smoking is one of the
23	causative factors in lung cancer.
24	Then again in 1959 -- again, study upon study
25	had been piled up, and he felt it was important to come
129
1	out and say it again, and even more strongly. Here it
2	says on the right, Renewing a previous warning to the
3	public, Burney said that the weight of evidence to
4	the -- to date implicates smoking as the principal cause
5	of the nation's increased rate of lung cancer, unquote.
6	Q. And what's the title of the second article
7	called?
8	A. The -- again, the one on the left says,
9	"Cigarettes again figure -- fingered as a factor." On
10	the right-hand side, it says, "Filter tip cigarettes
11	rated equal hazard." So he wanted to make it clear that
12	it didn't matter, it was filtered, unfiltered; they were
13	all hazardous.
14	Q. When the Miami Herald published news of
15	Dr. Burney's warnings, did it also get a statement from
16	the tobacco industry?
17	A. Yes, it did.
18	Q. And did someone from the tobacco industry
19	provide a statement in response?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. And tell us about that, please.
22	A. Well, and I want the jury especially to see
23	this. The -- remember, Dr. Heller said that the
24	newspapers had done a very objective job. And part of
25	the standard of newspaper objectivity and press
130
1	objectivity at that time was to make sure you were
2	asking for a comment on the person about whom somebody
3	else was talking.
4	So in this case they would periodically -- it
5	wasn't very common. And in fact, I found in all the
6	articles I reviewed that it was roughly 5 percent of the
7	time, they would be -- they would ask, for example, in
8	this case the industry spokesman to give a comment.
9	That means 95 percent of the time overall, there weren't
10	a comment -- a response by the industry. But in this
11	case there was, and this was part of what made
12	Dr. Heller feel that this was actually valuable.
13	Q. Do we have a slide that reflects what the
14	statement was from the tobacco industry?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 39. It's AFL_892.
17	And tell us what's shown here, Professor
18	Hoffman.
19	A. Okay. What's shown here is what again -- what I
20	like to go back to, proportion and context. It shows
21	the same article we just saw where I read the headline,
22	"Cigarettes again fingered as a factor in cancer." And
23	it was a four-column article. And in the middle of it,
24	sandwiched in between very negative statements, it
25	asked -- Burney's was -- statement was responded to. So
131
1	here you see in the call-out, Burney's statement brought
2	immediate reply from Dr. Clarence Cook Little of the
3	Tobacco Industry Research Committee. Little said that
4	Burney's statement adds nothing new to what has been
5	known about the cause of lung cancer. It reflects the
6	opinions of some statisticians and a relatively few
7	experimental scientists who have actively charged that
8	cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer, unquote.
9	And what I think is important about this, at
10	least to me as a historian, is that in terms of
11	proportion, these kinds of responses were very
12	infrequent. They did appear, absolutely, but they were
13	a tiny portion. Also contextually they're almost always
14	sandwiched between these other kinds of statements. In
15	fact, the preceding paragraph --1 didn't have room
16	enough to call everything out -- actually says that
17	Burney says there was no new proof either. But that's
18	partly because there was already a lot of proof, and
19	what he was saying is, I've assembled the proof, and I
20	want you to know and I want the American public to know
21	that this is a hazard.
22	Q. Okay. Now, going back to the Reader's Digest
23	publication, was --
24	MR. KAISER: (Indiscernible)
25	THE REPORTER: Excuse me?
132
1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. Did -- did Reader's Digest treat the issue of
3	the dangers of cigarettes -- let me back up.
4	How did Reader's Digest treat the issue of the
5	dangers of cigarette smoking in the 1950s?
6	A. In the 1950s Reader's Digest was even more
7	active than before. It had always weighed in frequently
8	on this issue. In the 1950s it covered all of the
9	studies, or almost all of the studies. It urged people
10	again and again to quit.
11	Q. Do you have some representatives of the articles
12	that were published in Reader's Digest about the dangers
13	and risks of cigarette smoking?
14	A. Yes, I do.
15	Q. Let's go to Slide 40. It's AS_995, AIW_162,
16	AS_915, AIW_211, AS_936, AS_938, AS_940, AS_941.
17	And, Professor Hoffman, can you tell us what --
18	what this slide shows about Reader's Digest?
19	A. Right. Well, Reader's Digest talked a lot about
20	lung cancer particularly, especially because this is the
21	period where all the really big studies are coming out.
22	They also talked a lot about quitting. So you see here
23	on the slide some of the headlines. One is about, how
24	harmful are cigarettes? The next one sounds the same.
25	How harmful are cigarettes? But right below it -- it
133
1	repeats that article, I --1 quit smoking, which was a
2	repeat from another earlier period of time. In December
3	of 1952 that third article, it's cancer by the carton.
4	And by the way, that's almost another example of
5	slang. If you saw cancer by the carton, and this is a
6	period of time in which people commonly bought
7	cigarettes in cartons, it's not saying the word
8	"cigarette," it's not saying the word "tobacco," but the
9	headline itself is suggestive of the information people
10	know, cancer by the carton.
11	On the right-hand side, upper right, it shows
12	one on how to stop smoking. It says, "When you wake in
13	the morning, remind yourself that you're going to get
14	through this day too without smoking."
15	On the bottom these are some other articles from
16	a little bit later in the 1950s, the second half of the
17	'50s. One says, "The facts behind cancer" -- pardon
18	me -- "the cigarette controversy." Another one says,
19	"The facts behind filter tip cigarette," again making
20	the point that filter tip cigarettes are no guarantee of
21	health. The third one is on nicotine, the problem of
22	addiction. The last one there is about -- from March of
23	1951 called -- pardon me -- March of 1959 called "The
24	growing -- growing horror of lung cancer." It says,
25	"Lung cancer is indeed a growing horror and a growing
134
1	threat. I am very convinced that every heavy smoker
2	will develop lung cancer unless heart disease or some
3	other sickness claims them earlier."
4	Q. You mentioned television coverage in some source
5	of information that you looked at. Did you review news
6	sources to see if they were running stories on smoking
7	and health during the 1950s?
8	A. I did.
9	Q. And how is TV coverage significant to your
10	opinions in this case?
11	A. Well, TV coverage is significant. This is a
12	period of time where television is -- is really taking
13	over the American landscape. You go from zero percent
14	television in 1949, or half a percent, up to something
15	like 80 percent of Americans owning television. More
16	Americans had televisions than had running water by the
17	end of the 1950s. So it's very significant.
18	And I went to a variety of archives on, for
19	example, the UCLA Television Film Archive. I mentioned
20	that earlier. That's handy for me because it's in
21	Hollywood, which is nearby where I work. Also it's one
22	of the nation's biggest archival repositories for this
23	kind of information.
24	Q. Are you familiar with the television program
25	called "See it Now"?
135
1	A. Yes, I am.
2	Q. And what was the program called "See it Now"?
3	A. Well, this is one of the programs that was
4	available, for example, at UCLA. See it Now was a very
5	popular news show from the mid-1950s that featured
6	Edward R. Murrow. Edward R. Murrow was one of the most
7	respected -- probably the most respected newsman of his
8	time. He had been a World War II correspondent, so he
9	was one of those people who reported on the terrible
10	devastation of London and other parts of Britain as a
11	result of, you know, Nazi bombing.
12	Q. How would See it Now compare to current TV news
13	programs?
14	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
15	THE WITNESS: There's almost no comparison
16	because of the fact that there were only two channels.
17	So there's no news program I can think of today which
18	would command the audience share that See it Now did.
19	Yeah, some people might compare it with 60 Minutes or
20	Meet the Nation, but it was even bigger.
21	BY MR. DAVIS:
22	Q. And did See -- did See it Now run nationwide?
23	A. Yes, it did.
24	Q. And did you review the See it Now program in
25	forming your opinions in this case?
136
1	A. I did.
2	Q. And did See it Now run a program in 19 -- let me
3	back up.
4	Did See it Now run a program regarding the
5	dangers of cigarette smoking?
6	A. Yes, they did.
7	Q. And when did they run that program?
8	A. They ran that program in 1955, a two-part
9	program.
10	Q. And can you describe for us what that -- what
11	that program was about?
12	A. Well, it was about the -- about the reports that
13	had been coming out. So this is -- this actually
14	precedes, of course, Leroy Burney's formal warning in
15	1957 and the one in 1959. This is from the mid-1950s.
16	This is from the year that David Ellsworth was
17	discharged from the Marines and came to live in Miami.
18	We know he was an avid television watcher during his
19	life. I don't know exactly when he got his first TV,
20	but he was a person who did watch television a lot.
21	Q. Do you have a clip that you brought, for the
22	jury's benefit, of the See it Now program that aired in
23	1955 about risks of smoking?
24	A. I did.
25	Q. All right. Let's play that clip, and it's
137
1	AIW_235 and Slide 41.
2	(A video clip was shown:
3	"Good evening. This is See it Now, produced by
4	the partnership of Friendly and Murrow. Tonight the
5	first of two reports on cigarettes and lung cancer. In
6	1952, Doctors Hammond and Horn of the American Cancer
7	Society began an extended study of the smoking habits of
8	American men. Here is Dr. Hammond reporting on the
9	results of the first two years."
10	"It is now established, in my opinion, beyond a
11	reasonable doubt that cigarette smoking greatly
12	increases the probability of developing lung cancer. In
13	my opinion, people should be warned of the dangers, and
14	they are being warned. What they then want to do,
15	whether they wish to smoke or not, is their own
16	business."
17	"Next Dr. Ernst Wynder and Research Assistant
18	Adele Coringer."
19	"And this bottle contains the amount of tar to
20	which the average heavy cigarette smoker is exposed to
21	over a given year's period of time. We believe that the
22	present evidence very strongly indicates that tobacco
23	smoking, and particularly cigarette smoking, is a major
24	cause of lung cancer.")
25
138
1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. In the See it Now clip we just watched,
3	Dr. Hammond reported publicly that people are, quote,
4	being warned. Is this consistent with your research
5	findings?
6	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
7	THE WITNESS: Dr. Hammond's statement from 1955
8	is very consistent with all the other findings. It's
9	consistent with the educational findings. It's
10	consistent with newspaper findings. It's consistent
11	with the polling findings. Again, we have -- and, of
12	course, he himself also said it, so that's another
13	finding that shows that this information was very -- in
14	very plain view.
15	BY MR. DAVIS:
16	Q. Did popular movies and television address the
17	dangers of smoking during the 1950s?
18	A. Yes, they did.
19	Q. And did you bring some examples from this time
20	period?
21	A. Yes, I did.
22	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 42. It's AN_2650,
23	AN_3141, AN_694, AN_695, ACR_2462.
24	Play that -- and can you -- before we play the
25	first clip, can you set up for us what it is that the
139
1	jury's going to see in these particular movie clips
2	and -- the movies and -- and some of the actors?
3	A. Well, what I've done here is I've brought
4	together clips. And again, these are representative. I
5	could show you many more. I brought together the ones
6	that are primarily from the 1950s and the early 1960s
7	just before the Surgeon General's report came out.
8	I could show you the Three Stooges from the
9	1930s, who had a whole skit on coffin nails. I could
10	show you other movies with very famous actors from the
11	1940s. I could show you Walt Disney cartoons, including
12	Donald Duck and Goofy, on -- on these same subjects.
13	But I wanted to just get a representative sample from
14	the later period, not the early, mid- 1950s.
15	And I also wanted to show the jury and -- and --
16	and the judge that these kinds of information in popular
17	culture were embedded in a lot of different contexts.
18	It wasn't just movies. It was stage plays. It was --
19	it was game shows. It was sitcoms.
20	So the first one we're going to see is from The
21	Seven Year Itch, which was a famous Broadway play that
22	was then made into a movie starring Marilyn Monroe, so
23	one of the biggest stars on the American screen. And
24	this is the famous movie where her -- her skirt blows
25	up. So this is a movie that a lot of people went to
140
1	see.
2	The second selection is from Leave it to Beaver.
3	And Leave it to Beaver is probably the most famous
4	American sitcom of the '50s. It ran through the '60s.
5	It was in syndication for many decades. So there's a
6	selection from Leave it to Beaver.
7	The next one is another movie starring, again,
8	probably the biggest male star of the time, Clark Gable.
9	And he talks about cigarette smoking is a kind of
10	suicide.
11	Sweet Bird of Youth is one of the last films.
12	This was also another major motion picture. It starred
13	the new heartthrob of the era, which was Paul Newman,
14	who could perhaps today be compared with Brad Pitt or
15	George Clooney or something. It actually -- this was a
16	movie that starts out in Florida, and it's -- he's --
17	it's him accompanying a faded -- fading movie star. It
18	also is that turning point in the early 1960s where
19	people are starting to talk about other kinds of drug
20	use, in this case illegal drug use.
21	Password was a famous, very well-known game
22	show. And I saw other game shows as well, To Tell the
23	Truth, for example, at the UCLA Film and Television
24	Archives, where they had information about smoking
25	hazards embedded in the show. So these are some
141
1	examples.
2	(A video clip was shown:
3	"Don't worry, Dr. Murphy. Just one, that's all.
4	All those lovely, injurious tars and resins."
5	THE WITNESS: I could mention about that, that
6	he was trying to quit smoking on his doctor's orders,
7	and Marilyn Monroe was so seductive that he got tempted
8	to smoke again. But the movie is a lot about him trying
9	to quit smoking because it's harmful.
10	(A video clip was shown:
11	"Peter, why in the world would you and Larry
12	want to smoke?"
13	"Well, gee, Mom, everybody is always saying how
14	bad it is, telling kids not to do it. Then I figured if
15	grownups say it was so bad, there must be something real
16	good about it. But there wasn't. I could hardly hold
17	my stomach down."
18	"Well, Beaver, strange as it may seem, as you
19	grow older, you're going to discover that quite a lot of
20	things we tell you are bad really are bad."
21	"Yeah, Dad, guess I kind of found that out."
22	"Why would you and Larry do a crazy thing like
23	smoking that pipe?"
24	"I don't know. Well, it was there, so we smoked
25	it."
142
1	"Yeah, well, you're always telling me you want
2	to go out for football and stuff when you get in high
3	school. Well, don't you know that smoking could wreck
4	you?"
5	"Gee, maybe I'm wrecked already, because I can
6	only do two pushups.")
7	(A video clip was shown:
8	"I'm not going to become no track star."
9	"Phew, you got to get fresh air."
10	"Air is too damp. Irritates my cough."
11	"Your cough is the illegitimate child of you and
12	those cigarettes."
13	"You -- you smoke."
14	"Yeah, I drink too, as recreation, not as a
15	disguised form of suicide.")
16	(A video clip was shown:
17	"I'll go out pretty soon. My credit is kind of
18	shaky."
19	"I would like to smoke, please. No, no, just
20	one of the ordinary cigarettes. They'll only give you
21	cancer.")
22	(A video clip was shown:
23	"This is the lovely singing star of television
24	and the Broadway musical theater, Florence Henderson."
25	"Thank you."
143
1	"This is a talented actor and popular star of
2	stage, screen, and television, Tony Randall.
3	"Good evening."
4	"And we are all here to play Password. Guess
5	the password, brought to you this evening" --
6	"The password is 'butt.'"
7	"Okay. Florence, start with you, ten points."
8	"I think we shouldn't have this word. I'm
9	sorry. Bottom."
10	"Top."
11	"Bottom, top, and thank you. All right, nine
12	points."
13	"Goat. Goat."
14	"Animal."
15	"Animal. Eight points."
16	"Montana."
17	"Hnini, Montana."
18	"Coyote?"
19	"No, but that's very interesting. Seven points,
20	Tony."
21	"Cigarettes."
22	"Five seconds. That's a good clue."
23	"Lighter."
24	"Lighter. No. Six points."
25	"Cigarette."
1	"Cancer?"
2	"I told you."
3	"You know, we get into trouble when -- when --
4	Tony, five points."
5	"Oh, Mother, help.")
6	BY MR. DAVIS:
7	Q. All right. Professor Hoffman, what's the
8	significance to you of how the audience reacted on that
9	last clip when --
10	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
11	BY MR. DAVIS:
12	Q. -- the -- the -- the participants on the game
13	show were trying to link up "butt" with something else,
14	and one of the participants said cancer?
15	A. Well -
16	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
17	THE WITNESS: -- what was significant about this
18	to me -- and by the way, this episode of Password was
19	commented upon in TIME magazine. And they said
20	everybody is equating these terms now, cigarettes,
21	cancer. And they -- they made -- they had an article
22	actually about the Password episode. And the laughter,
23	I thought, was again a good example of the way that
24	popular culture works, that people can know things and
25	no sermon and no schoolbook is necessary, no article, no
1	Surgeon General's report. It's simply people laughed
2	because they went, Oh, right. Of course. Cigarettes
3	equals cancer.
4	BY MR. DAVIS:
5	Q. Now, going into the 1960s, did newspaper
6	coverage about the dangers of smoking slow down in
7	that -- in that decade?
8	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
9	THE WITNESS: No, coverage did not slow down.
10	BY MR. DAVIS:
11	Q. Do you have some examples that you brought with
12	you of representative articles in the 1960s about the
13	dangers of -- of smoking?
14	A. Yes, I did.
15	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 43, ALN_177,
16	ALN_181, ALN_186, ALN_193, ALN_213.
17	Professor Hoffman, can you tell us -- and can
18	you explain this slide for the -- for the jury, please?
19	A. Yes. Well, this slide shows the continuation
20	of -- of articles that were coming out, again, around
21	the same time as that Password show we just watched,
22	early 19 -- that was in 1963. This is 1961, '62, '63,
23	so it's that early '60s.
24	And this is the period of time in which, by the
25	way, President John Kennedy decided to commission a
1	study on the hazards of smoking and to bring together
2	all of the research that had been coming out so
3	continuously. You know, he understood that he was now
4	at this point under pressure to really do something
5	about it.
6	And so in the Miami Herald, which was the paper
7	that -- that the family was taking and Mr. Ellsworth was
8	taking, it shows things like "Smoking, cancer linked by
9	Jones." That's another researcher. The second article,
10	Cigarettes again link -- again tied to lung cancer -- to
11	cancer. Pardon me.
12	Again, on the right side, Cigarette,
13	cancer-cigarette tie cited. Now, again, you can see how
14	those two words are just being put together much like
15	they did in Password. On the bottom left it says,
16	"Study links smoking to more diseases than cancer,"
17	because that was also happening. There was a lot of
18	discussion of emphysema, of throat cancer, of heart
19	disease, and other kinds of hazards, of which there were
20	many. On the bottom right you see one, "Death rate
21	reported higher for smokers."
22	Q. You mentioned the Surgeon General's report
23	earlier. When was that report released to the public?
24	A. That report was actually delayed. Very sadly,
25	it was released on January 11, 1964, which meant it was
147
1	just about less than two months after President Kennedy
2	was assassinated, which may be one of the reasons why it
3	had such attention. People were quite aware that this
4	had been a special interest to President Kennedy, who
5	was himself a nonsmoker. And -- and it was released to
6	wide acclaim.
7	Q. Do you have a slide on the release of the
8	Surgeon General's report?
9	A. I do.
10	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 44.
11	And can you tell us what's depicted here,
12	please?
13	A. Well, what's depicted here is the big moment,
14	and there was a tremendous amount of anticipation about
15	this. The report had been being underway. There was a
16	lot of attention to it while it was being done. It was
17	done in super secret way. Nobody was supposed to know
18	the results until the day they were announced.
19	And so they actually brought reporters in. You
20	can -- you can see that depiction of the auditorium.
21	Everyone was brought in. They locked the doors so that
22	no reporter could get out ahead of all the others and
23	report the story. And Luther Terry announced what
24	really what everyone expected to hear. But this was
25	based on, you know, more than ten years of studies, more
148
1	than 3,000 studies. And again, I looked at these
2	records at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda,
3	Maryland.
4	Q. Did -- Surgeon General Terry, did he report --
5	let me back up.
6	Is -- who's depicted on the left-hand side?
7	A. Surgeon General Luther Terry.
8	Q. And did he report a connection between smoking
9	and lung cancer?
10	A. Yes, he did.
11	Q. And did the report say anything about the
12	habit-forming nature of smoking?
13	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
14	THE WITNESS: Yes, it did.
15	BY MR. DAVIS:
16	Q. What did -- what -- what was -- so that was
17	discussed in the report as well?
18	A. Yes. The report and the Surgeon General's
19	committee, which was a committee of eminent doctors and
20	physicians and researchers, they concluded that it was
21	habit forming, not addictive. And that's because at
22	this time the understood medical -- technical medical
23	definition of addiction was that it was something that
24	would create -- such anti— you would be so addicted
25	that you would be antisocial. You'd be willing to bash
149
1	a window or, you know, rob a bank to get what you
2	needed, to get your fix, so to speak. They considered
3	substances addictive which would create grand mal
4	seizures, for example. And it was known that smoking
5	did not lead to seizures or deeply antisocial behavior.
6	So they -- they said habit forming.
7	Q. Yeah. And so you mentioned earlier that -- that
8	number of reporters attended this -- this press
9	conference. What kind of publicity did the Surgeon
10	General's report receive?
11	A. Well, they announced it on a Saturday. And part
12	of the idea here, why a Saturday during -- in
13	Washington, D.C., they wanted it to make the Sunday
14	editions, which were the biggest newspaper editions and
15	which would get a lot of -- a lot of attention. There
16	were also television specials that were prepared for
17	this too, so they would air on the weekend when people
18	had time to watch TV. So it got tremendous publicity
19	all across the country, all across the world.
20	Q. Was Mr. Ellsworth living in Miami when the 1964
21	Surgeon General's report was released?
22	A. Yes, he was.
23	Q. And did the Miami newspapers cover the release
24	of the Surgeon General's report and its findings?
25	A. Yes, they did.
150
I	Q. All right. Do you have some examples of that --
2	that newspaper coverage?
3	A. Yes, I do. I brought some.
4	Q. All right. Let's -- let's turn to Slide 45,
5	ALN_231, ALN_232.
6	And, Professor Hoffman, please tell us what's --
7	what's shown on this slide.
8	A. Well, what this slide shows are two of the
9	articles that were in the Miami Herald that day. As you
10	see, it's the banner headline across the top. That top
II	article is, you know, a reporter who's saying, "That's
12	it. I quit smoking at 2:00 p.m., Saturday," and that's
13	because that's the hour at which the Surgeon General's
14	report was -- was announced, and that smoker said, "I'm
15	done."
16	The other article is about the report itself,
17	and it says, "That's it. Cigarettes guilty."
18	Q. Do you have some other representative articles
19	about the release of the Surgeon General's report?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. And let's -- let's go to the next slide, Slide
22	46. It's AL_340, AL_452, AL_613, AL_4662.
23	And again, Professor Hoffman, tell us -- tell us
24	what we see here.
25	A. Well, I brought these particular slides and
151
1	examples. I could have brought hundreds of others,
2	really hundreds of others. But I wanted to show
3	context. I wanted to show the -- the towns that
4	surround Miami or that are in proximity to Miami. And
5	so you see the Orlando Sentinel, and that was the town
6	to which nearby he eventually moved.
7	It says, "Smoking top cause of lung cancer." To
8	the right of that, it says, "Smoking, cancer linked."
9	It shows Dr. Terry holding up the report. Below that it
10	shows, "Cigarettes-cancer link," and that's from the Ft.
11	Lauderdale Sun Sentinel, so again another town not
12	terribly far away. And then the Miami News, the other
13	local newspaper, on the bottom right, "Cigarettes do
14	cause cancer."
15	Q. Were the cover stories the only coverage by the
16	Florida newspapers?
17	A. No.
18	MR. KAISER: Form.
19	BY MR. DAVIS:
20	Q. Did you bring examples of the -- the other
21	coverage inside the newspaper, so to speak?
22	A. Yes, I did.
23	Q. Okay. And did you bring a slide that kind of --
24	that shows that coverage?
25	A. Yes.
152
1	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 47.
2	And can you tell us what's depicted here?
3	A. Well, what -- what you see here are articles
4	that -- they're from January 12th, by the way, because
5	the report was released January 11th, and so daily
6	newspaper reports the information the next day when they
7	print the paper.
8	On that particular day they -- here are three
9	articles in addition to the ones we -- we talked about.
10	"Here's what the study by the U.S. revealed." That's an
11	article. Another one says, "Lung cancer to strike 400.
12	Will you be one of them?" That's what they're --
13	they're talking about in Dade County, by there -- by the
14	way, there.
15	On the bottom left it says, "No ifs, ands, or
16	butts" -- and that's the -- the joke there is the pun on
17	the word "butt" -- "Pal, try Smokers Anonymous." Now,
18	that -- what that was about was that there -- right
19	around this time -- if fact, by 1962, before the
20	report -- there was this major national movement to
21	start antismoking clinics. So this is the kind of thing
22	that the Miami Herald was covering the day before the
23	report, the day of the report, the day after the report,
24	and -- and on -- so on.
25	Q. How many articles ran in the Miami Herald on
153
1	January 12, 1964, which discussed the 1964 Surgeon
2	General's report or risk from smoking?
3	A. Well, on that -- on that day, the day the report
4	came out, there were ten separate articles in the Miami
5	Herald on the hazards of smoking and the importance of
6	quitting.
7	Q. Was the information reported in these articles
8	in the Miami Herald including -- you know, with such
9	headlines that cigarettes do cause cancer, was that
10	something that was hidden from public view in Florida in
11	1964?
12	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
13	THE WITNESS: No. This was information that was
14	delivered to people's doorstep in 1964.
15	BY MR. DAVIS:
16	Q. And for the record, those are -- Slide 47
17	reflects ALN_225, ALN_226, ALN_229.
18	Did coverage of the Surgeon's General (sic)
19	report, was it just limited to -- to newspapers?
20	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
21	THE WITNESS: Oh, no, no. The Surgeon General's
22	report was covered on television. It was covered on
23	radio. It was covered in magazines, in all the forms of
24	public media.
25
154
1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. Okay. Did you bring some examples of some of
3	the magazine coverage of the 1964 Surgeon General's
4	report for us?
5	A. Yes, I did.
6	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 48. That's --
7	reflects AIW_361, AIW_2928, AFL_1868, AIW_366, AIW_372.
8	And, Professor Hoffman, please tell us what --
9	what we see here on Slide 40 -- on this slide.
10	A. Well, these are examples of some of the most
11	important magazines in America at that time. TIME
12	magazine, of course, was the leading news magazine, the
13	most famous. It had a whole article in the Surgeon
14	General's report. To the right of that, Newsweek again,
15	that headline reads, "Cigarette smoking is a health
16	hazard."
17	The bottom left, this is Business Week. And, of
18	course, this is a period of time in which business is
19	very big in America, and Business Week was one of the
20	primary preeminent magazines. That particular article
21	not only talked about the Surgeon General's -- General's
22	report but also emphasized, as it says in the headline,
23	"The U.S. sums it up. Quit smoking." So they talked
24	about smoking take -- ways of -- ways to quit smoking in
25	that article.
155
1	To the right of that, another Life magazine
2	article, "Verdict on cigarettes, guilty as charged."
3	And to the right of that, of course, is Reader's Digest,
4	which was continuously printing information on this
5	subject.
6	Q. And based upon your research, how hard would it
7	have been for an American to avoid all of the news
8	coverage concerning the 1964 Surgeon General's report?
9	MR. KAISER: Object to form, "How hard."
10	THE WITNESS: Based on my professional research,
11	my professional opinion is that it would have been
12	impossible for average Americans and for David Ellsworth
13	to avoid this information.
14	BY MR. DAVIS:
15	Q. Did Reader's Digest --1 think you mentioned --
16	strike that.
17	Did Reader's Digest continue to publish articles
18	about the dangers of smoking throughout the 1960s?
19	A. Oh, yes.
20	Q. All right. Did you bring a representative slide
21	of -- of that coverage in Reader's Digest?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 49, AIW_318,
24	AIW_322, AIW_324, AIW_334, AIW_372, AIW_388, AIW_390,
25	AIW_404.
156
1	Professor Hoffman, are these representative --
2	strike that.
3	Professor Hoffman, are these stories that ran in
4	the Reader's Digest in the 1960s about the dangers of
5	smoking cigarettes?
6	A. Yes. These articles are all about the dangers
7	of smoking cigarettes.
8	Q. Did these articles discuss that the -- that
9	cigarettes cause lung cancer?
10	A. Yes. These --
11	MR. KAISER: Object to fomi.
12	THE WITNESS: These articles talked about the
13	hazard of lung cancer as well as other risks.
14	BY MR. DAVIS:
15	Q. Was the Surge—
16	MR. KAISER: (Inaudible) can't hear anything.
17	BY MR. DAVIS:
18	Q. Was the Surgeon General's report --
19	MR. DAVIS: I'm sorry. What did you say, Allan?
20	MR. KAISER: I can't hear you now.
21	MR. DAVIS: Okay. Is this better?
22	MR. KAISER: Yeah.
23	MR. DAVIS: Thanks.
24	BY MR. DAVIS:
25	Q. Professor Hoffman, was the 1964 Surgeon
157
1	General's report covered on the TV news?
2	A. Yes, the Surgeon General's report was covered on
3	television news.
4	Q. And how extensive -- let me -- let me -- let me
5	back up.
6	What was the level of coverage on the TV news
7	concerning the 1964 Surgeon General's report?
8	A. The television news coverage of the Surgeon
9	General's report in 1964 was really very strong. This
10	is a period of time in which television news was often
11	just 15 minutes. It was very short. It wasn't like
12	today's 24-hour news cycle. You would have very short
13	evening news. Over time they got longer.
14	But what happened with the Surgeon General's
15	report is they put up half-hour, one-hour specials about
16	the hazards of smoking when the report came out.
17	Q. And do you have an example or representative
18	clip from one of the news programs at the time?
19	A. Yes, I do.
20	Q. And can you set this up for -- set this up for
21	the jury, to explain what it is that they're going to
22	see?
23	A. Well, what the -- what you're going to see here
24	is a short part of -- because we don't have time for the
25	whole thing, a short segment of the report by Harry
158
1	Reasoner, who was a very well-known, very well-respected
2	anchorman for a long, long time, talking about the
3	Surgeon General's report.
4	Q. And did this CBS News program run nationwide?
5	A. It did. Again, there were only two channels in
6	the whole nation. ABC was coming on board around this
7	time too. But CBS and NBC were the first two national
8	television stations, so if you wanted to watch TV, you
9	had to watch one of these.
10	Q. Okay. We're going to play the clip now from
11	that program, and it's AN_002416.
12	(A video clip was shown:
13	"This is a CBS News Extra on smoking and health,
14	the findings of the Surgeon General's committee."
15	"Almost from the moment that cigarettes were
16	introduced, they were attacked. But the attacks took a
17	new turn ten years ago and culminated in today's report
18	by the Surgeon General's committee. This, in summary,
19	is what the committee says. Cigarette smoking is a
20	major cause of lung cancer in men, and data on women
21	smokers points the same way. Cigarette smoking is a
22	significant cause of cancer of the lamax and probably
23	the most important cause of chronic bronchitis.
24	Cigarette smoking may be related to other lung diseases.
25	Male smokers have a much higher death rate from heart
159
1	disease, although it's not proven that smoking is the
2	cause. On the question of filters, the committee says
3	there is no evidence that they do any good, but it
4	didn't exclude the possibility that an effective filter
5	might be developed. In short, the committee says if you
6	smoke cigarettes, you increase your chances of dying
7	early. The sooner you start, the more you smoke, the
8	more you inhale, the worse your chances are. The
9	Surgeon General's committee presented its report at a
10	news conference in Washington."
11	"Out of its long and exhaustive deliberations,
12	the committee has reached the overall judgment that
13	cigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient
14	importance to the United States to warrant remedial
15	action. This overall judgment was supported my many
16	converging lines of evidence as well as by data
17	indicating that cigarette smoking is related to higher
18	death rates in a number of disease categories. More
19	specifically, the committee states on page 61 of the
20	report, and I quote, 'In view of the continuing and
21	mounting evidence from many sources, it is the judgment
22	of the committee that cigarette smoking contributes
23	substantially to mortality from certain specific
24	diseases and to the overall death rate.'"
25	"In this kind of a country, it comes down to
160
1	you, whether you like it or not. No one is going to
2	forbid an adult to smoke. And it is now quite clear
3	that no one is going to tell him it's good from him
4	either. The decision is his, the decision and the
5	health that may depend on it.
6	"This is Harry Reasoner. Good night.")
7	BY MR. DAVIS:
8	Q. Professor Hoffman, with respect to the materials
9	that you reviewed, whether that be magazine articles,
10	newspaper articles, or TV news clips or other material,
11	did some of those items also contain comments by tobacco
12	company representatives?
13	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
14	THE WITNESS: Yes, occasionally.
15	BY MR. DAVIS:
16	Q. And did you consider these tobacco company
17	comments in reaching your opinions and conclusions?
18	A. Yes, very much so.
19	Q. How much weight did you give them?
20	A. I gave them due weight.
21	Q. And were you -- what do you mean by that?
22	A. What I mean is that, again, as a historian we're
23	looking at the context and proportion. So, for example,
24	I showed the jury a little while ago an article which
25	talked a lot about the hazards of smoking, and there was
161
1	a comment by the industry. To me what -- what -- the
2	due weight there is it's important to show it and to
3	recognize that that's there. But then have you to ask,
4	Well, how common was that, and in what context was that?
5	So if the overall context is one in which it's
6	being condemned and they say, What's your comment, and
7	they say something like, No comment, or, This isn't new,
8	then you know that with 95 percent of the articles
9	being, you know, hostile, so to speak, that you can say
10	that this information was plainly out there, that those
11	statements in no way under -- undermined the overall
12	message.
13	Q. Based upon your research and analysis, what
14	percentage of articles or news reports or magazine
15	articles had a comment by a tobacco company
16	representative?
17	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
18	THE WITNESS: Well, I actually - I actually -
19	very curious to know that. So one of the things I did
20	was to go to what's called the Vanderbilt News Archive.
21	And the Vanderbilt News Archive is the one place where
22	all the newscasts after 1968 have been brought together.
23	A lot of the information before that was not kept in one
24	place. And doing a computer search of that archive,
25	what I found was that of something like 2100 articles,
1	about 150 or so had a -- a reference in which the
2	tobacco industry was asked, What's your opinion? So the
3	numbers of that come out to about 5 percent of the time.
4	So 95 percent of the time, there was no reference at all
5	to what the industry thought. It was all people like
6	Luther Terry and Leroy Burney and Doctors Hammond and
7	Horn.
8	I also did a similar study with the Los Angeles
9	Times because that's the closest major newspaper to me.
10	I found there that out of something like 2200 articles,
11	more than 2,000 articles over a 30- or 40-year period of
12	time, that again around 5 percent had some sandwiched
13	comment about what the industry thought, which meant
14	that 95 percent of the time there was no reference at
15	all. So again, looking at things in context and taking
16	into account proportion, what I found was that -- that
17	the overall message was very prominent and very clear.
18	BY MR. DAVIS:
19	Q. If there's some prior testimony in this case
20	that statements by the tobacco companies were pervasive
21	in the media, would that be supported by your research
22	and analysis?
23	A. No. All of the evidence --
24	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
25	THE WITNESS: All of the evidence I found with
1	exhaustive research was that that commentary was not
2	pervasive at all. It was actually uncommon.
3	MR. DAVIS: Allan?
4	MR. KAISER: Yeah.
5	MR. DAVIS: We're going to take a break. The
6	court reporter has been going for almost another 90
7	minutes. So I'm going to give her a short break. Do
8	you want to grab -- we're going to -- we're going to
9	grab a quick lunch of like 25 minutes or so, and then
10	I'm going to try to wrap it up.
11	MR. KAISER: Okay.
12	MR. DAVIS: Okay?
13	MR. KAISER: Yeah.
14	MR. DAVIS: All right. So do you want to dial
15	back in in about 20 minutes, 25 minutes?
16	MR. KAISER: Yeah.
17	MR. DAVIS: Okay. Off the record.
18	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record, the time is
19	1:30 p.m. This marks the end of Media No. 2.
20	(Off record)
21	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the record, the time
22	is 2:11 p.m. This marks the beginning of Media No. 3.
23	BY MR. DAVIS:
24	Q. Professor Hoffman, when did warning labels first
25	appear on cigarette packages?
1	A. Warning labels first appeared in 1966.
2	Q. Even before 1966 were public health
3	organizations discussing the issues -- strike that.
4	Even before 1966 were public health
5	organizations discussing the issues of warning labels
6	A. Yes --
7	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
8	THE WITNESS: Yes, they were discussing it prior
9	to 1966.
10	BY MR. DAVIS:
11	Q. Did the American medical -- let me back up.
12	What -- what health organizations are you aware
13	of that had discussed the issue of warning labels before
14	1966?
15	A. Well, the organization with which I'm most
16	familiar is the American Medical Association, which
17	weighed in on the question of whether or not there
18	should or should not be warning labels.
19	Q. What was the American Medical Association's
20	position?
21	A. The American Medical Association took the
22	position that warning labels were not necessary. They
23	agreed that smoking caused cancer. But at this -- this
24	was a time when there weren't warning labels on -- on
25	common products that people would actually consume.
165
1	Today there are warning labels on -- on pretty much
2	everything from, you know, wine bottles to water
3	bottles. But at that time there were no products of
4	that sort. So the AMA actually said it was common
5	knowledge and this would not be necessary, to break from
6	all precedent.
7	Q. Do you have a slide that is illustrative of that
8	point?
9	A. Yes, I do.
10	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 51. It'sAS_321.
11	And is this the American Medical Association's
12	statement that you mentioned earlier about their view on
13	whether a warning was needed on cigarette packaging?
14	A. Yes. This shows you one representation of this.
15	I've also seen it reported in newspapers. And it was --
16	as you can see, it was testimony to the Federal Trade
17	Commission. And they said, quote, The health hazards of
18	excessive smoking have been well publicized for more
19	than ten years and are common knowledge. Labeling will
20	not alert even the young cigarette smoker to any risks
21	of which he is not already aware.
22	Q. When did -- what was the date of this
23	publication?
24	A. That was April 6, 1964.
25	Q. Did other publications also recognize what is
166
1	described there as the well publicized health warnings
2	regarding cigarettes?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. Okay. And do you have an example of -- of those
5	other publications in the next slide?
6	A. I do.
7	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 52. It's AIW_371.
8	And, Professor Hoffman, what's shown here in
9	this slide, and what's it -- and what is the
10	significance of this?
11	A. Well, here the American Cancer Society is
12	actually recognizing the role of Reader's Digest and --
13	and the effect of its, you know, efforts over 30 years,
14	40 years to make people aware. So it says, "Since
15	November 1924 the Reader's Digest has published 36
16	articles on smoking and health. The American Cancer
17	Society has termed them a profound influence in creating
18	public awareness of the risks involved in smoking."
19	MR. DAVIS: For the record, that's AIW_371.
20	BY MR. DAVIS:
21	Q. Did the government, nonetheless -- let me strike
22	that.
23	Despite what the American Medical Association
24	said and the current environment at the time that
25	products of the type like cigarettes did not have
167
1	warnings on them, did the government nonetheless require
2	that warnings be placed on cigarette packages?
3	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
4	THE WITNESS: Yes. The government did decide
5	that as a result of the 1964 S.G. report, that they
6	wanted to take what Luther Terry had called remedial
7	action. They wanted there to be a physical, you know,
8	warning that went out on an ongoing basis, so they
9	decided to label all cigarettes.
10	BY MR. DAVIS:
11	Q. And do you have a slide that shows the warning
12	that went on the cigarette packaging in 1966?
13	A. I do.
14	Q. All right. Let's go to the next slide.
15	And is this the warning that went on in 1966?
16	A. Yes. This is the first warning.
17	Q. And who ended up making the decision to require
18	this warning?
19	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
20	THE WITNESS: Well, this was a decision by the
21	U.S. Congress.
22	BY MR. DAVIS:
23	Q. And did the Congress's decision to require this
24	labeling receive any public attention?
25	A. Oh, yes. This was very hot news. This --
168
1	because it was so controversial. It wasn't just because
2	it was about this really important news story which had
3	been covered extensively. It was also the very first
4	time that anything was going to be publicly labeled.
5	And so it was covered everywhere that I've looked; I
6	mean, from every magazine, every newspaper that I've
7	looked in this period.
8	Q. Do you have an example of the coverage in the
9	Miami Herald newspaper that Mr. Ellsworth read?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. All right. Let's show that, please. That's
12	Exhibit 54. It's AFL_4138, AGS_74.
13	And, Professor Hoffman, can you tell us what's
14	shown here on this slide?
15	A. Yes. This is the article, one of the -- in the
16	Miami Herald that talked about Lyndon Johnson having
17	actually assigned the bill that had been debated and
18	discussed for a per— almost a year. And it says,
19	"Cigarette health warning bill signed into law by
20	Johnson." Lyndon Johnson was president at that time.
21	He was also an ex-smoker and had very publicly quit
22	smoking as a result of its consequences for his health,
23	as had President Eisenhower before him. As I mentioned,
24	John Kennedy was a nonsmoker.
25	And on the right-hand side, if you don't mind my
169
1	saying, it was publicized not just in newspapers, but as
2	can you see, the American Cancer Society put out a
3	poster that said, "Congress has acted. The next step is
4	yours"
5	And there was always this emphasis, which is a
6	little unusual for us today, because at that time this
7	was the middle of the Cold War, and the idea was always
8	that we don't want to being like Soviet society, like
9	Russians, which tell people what to do. Instead, people
10	have to make their own choices.
11	There was also a poster that was put up right
12	around the same time, just a little bit later, on U.S.
13	mail trucks. So every mail truck in the U.S., as it
14	went out to deliver mail around the country, had a sign
15	that said, you know, "100,000 doctors have quit
16	smoking."
17	Q. Now, did your research reveal any polling data
18	about the public -- public's awareness of the 1966
19	warning label?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. And was that polling data publicly available?
22	A. Yes, it was.
23	Q. And what did the polling data show?
24	A. Polling data showed that, overwhelmingly,
25	Americans had -- were aware of the warning going on the
170
1	package.
2	Q. Do you have a slide to show the results of that
3	polling data?
4	A. I do.
5	Q. All right. Let's go to the next slide, which is
6	Slide 55, AIW_411.
7	And please tell us what's being shown here in
8	this slide.
9	A. Well, what this slide shows is that, as it says,
10	the people were asked, "Have you seen or heard about the
11	health warning label that is required on the outside of
12	each package of cigarettes?" And men overall, males,
13	said -- about 84 percent said, yes, they'd heard about
14	it. Smokers, even more. Male smokers, like Mr.
15	Ellsworth, almost 92 percent said, yes, they had -- they
16	were aware of the warning about health on the side of
17	the package.
18	Q. Following the 1964 Surgeon General's report, did
19	newspapers in Miami continue to report upon health
20	hazards and dangers of smoking?
21	A. Yes, they did.
22	Q. Do you have a slide that shows some of the
23	articles which were representative of that -- that
24	newspaper coverage?
25	A. Yes, I do.
171
1	Q. All right. The next -- let's go to the next
2	slide. And it's -- articles represented there are AL --
3	ALN_268, AFL_4088, ALN_275, AF - excuse me - AFL_4096,
4	AFL_4145.
5	And what newspaper is reflected in the -- that's
6	reflected up there, in terms of the articles that are --
7	that were published at the time?
8	A. These are all from the Miami Herald, which was
9	the paper to which Mr. Ellsworth subscribed and that,
10	according to his family's testimony, that he -- he read
11	every day.
12	Q. And you don't need to go through all of the
13	headlines, but what -- what are some of the few
14	headlines that are reflected here in this slide?
15	A. Smoke link to—
16	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
17	THE WITNESS: -- cancer link to cancer
18	emphasized. They truly are coffin nails. Again, that's
19	slang.
20	I pulled out a quote here that says, "Abstinence
21	from smoking affords the best protection against lung
22	cancer at present, the council asserted." So the
23	newspaper continued to warn people that it was bad for
24	them, that if they did smoke, they should stop.
25
172
1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. Professor Hoffman, are you familiar with the
3	National Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health?
4	A. I am.
5	Q. And what was that group? What's that -- what
6	was that organization?
7	A. The National Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health
8	was the national level of what were actually also a
9	series of statewide organizations. Every state,
10	including Florida, started a council on smoking and
11	health to bring together everybody who was interested in
12	the issue to coordinate efforts to get people to stop.
13	And there was a national umbrella for all of this, and
14	the ahead of that was Daniel Horn, of the famous Hammond
15	and Horn study.
16	Q. Okay. In the 1960s did Dr. Horn make any public
17	statements about the issue of public awareness on the
18	risks of cigarette smoking?
19	A. Yes, he did.
20	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
21	BY MR. DAVIS:
22	Q. Do you have a slide describing what Dr. Horn
23	said?
24	A. I do.
25	Q. Let's go to the next slide, and it's AIW_401.
173
1	Please tell us about this slide, Professor
2	Hoffman, and the significance of it.
3	A. Well, so -
4	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
5	THE WITNESS: -- Dr. Horn was one of the most
6	famous researchers on the issue of smoking and health.
7	Hammond and Horn had been the big study. So he was put
8	in charge of this national organization that was in
9	charge also of all these statewide organizations. So if
10	anyone in the whole country had a bird's-eye view of
11	everything that was being done to warn people, it would
12	have been Dr. Daniel Horn. And he said in 1968, quote,
13	You could stand on a rooftop and shout, Smoking is
14	dangerous, at the top of your lungs, and you would not
15	be telling anyone anything they did not already know.
16	BY MR. DAVIS:
17	Q. If we could switch back a little bit to warning
18	labels, did the 19— is the 1966 warning label that we
19	looked at, is that the warning label that's in effect
20	today?
21	A. No.
22	MR. KAISER: Form.
23	BY MR. DAVIS:
24	Q. Did -- did the warning label from 1966 change?
25	A. Yes, it did.
174
1	Q. When did it change?
2	A. It changed in 1970.
3	Q. And did you bring a slide with you to show the
4	warning in -- that was -- went into effect in 1970?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. All right. Let's go to that one.
7	What did the 1970 warning say?
8	A. It said, "Warning. The Surgeon General has
9	determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your
10	health."
11	Q. Was there a time when warning -- the -- this
12	warning label would appear any -- elsewhere besides just
13	on the cigarette packaging?
14	A. Yeah --
15	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
16	THE WITNESS: Yes. Actually, two years later,
17	in 1972, Congress required that the warning also appear
18	on all advertising. Now, this is, by the way, print
19	advertising because by that point in 1971, all
20	electronic advertising for cigarettes went off the air.
21	So it was no longer allowed on television and radio. So
22	on print ads or in billboards, they would have to put up
23	the -- the warning.
24	BY MR. DAVIS:
25	Q. How many TV news stories ran about
175
1	smoking-related health issues or risks from smoking
2	between 1968 and 1994?
3	A. 2,100-and-something, a lot, on the national
4	networks.
5	Q. Okay. And did the TV news continue to cover the
6	issue of smoking and health from the 1960s to the 1980s?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. And did you bring a few examples of this
9	coverage on TV as well as in movies?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. All right. Let's go to the next slide.
12	And first of all, what -- what are we about to
13	see in this -- on this next slide, in these -- in this
14	next video clips?
15	A. Well, as I indicate, we're going to look at
16	television news next. And there were thousands -- a
17	couple of thousand of news stories, so I can only show
18	you two or three. But these were continuous warnings.
19	Often they were just very quick, again, because this was
20	such a continuing story. Sometimes one of the most
21	famous people, like Walter Cronkite or Huntley and
22	Brinkley -- these were people from that era -- they
23	would make a very quick comment, but it was always in
24	the context of this ongoing story.
25	Q. Okay. Let's see if we can run those clips.
176
1	Oh, yeah. It's AN_2485, AN_2509, AN_2519.
2	(A video clip was shown:
3	"In a report to Congress released today, the
4	Public Health Service says new evidence has been found
5	linking cigarette smoking with a variety of diseases,
6	including types of cancer and, for the first time,
7	noncancerous diseases of the mouth. The report was
8	accompanied by a letter from Welfare Secretary Finch,
9	which said cigarette smoking continues to cause much
10	unnecessary disease and death. At the same time Finch
11	praised the tobacco industry for offering to end
12	broadcast advertising of cigarettes by September 1970.")
13	(A video clip was shown:
14	"HEW Secretary Califano today formally launched
15	the government's new campaign against cigarette smoking.
16	Barry Serafin reports."
17	"Califano said he was not launching his campaign
18	because of his zeal as a reformed smoker but because is,
19	quote, public health enemy No. 1 in the United States.
20	'The evidence is clear,' he said, 'that smoking kills.'"
21	"Last year smoking was a major factor in 220,000
22	deaths from heart disease, in 78,000 deaths from lung
23	cancer, in 22,000 deaths from other cancers. These
24	facts mean that people who smoke are committing
25	slow-motion suicide.")
177
1	(A video clip was shown:
2	"Another set of statistics arguing against
3	smoking came out today. The study by the State Mutual
4	Life Insurance Company says death statistics show that
5	the life expectancy of cigarette smokers is seven years
6	less than nonsmokers, that they die at a rate 2 1/2
7	times higher than nonsmokers.")
8	BY MR. DAVIS:
9	Q. Professor Hoffman, with respect to the
10	newscaster that -- for each of those clips on CBS News,
11	who is that?
12	A. That's Walter Cronkite.
13	Q. What was -- what was Mr. Cronkite's reputation
14	as a journalist and -- and newscaster at the time?
15	MR. KAISER: Objection. Form. "Reputation."
16	THE WITNESS: Mr. Cronkite was -
17	BY MR. DAVIS:
18	Q. Let me -- let me ask it a different way.
19	A. Sure.
20	Q. Based upon your historical research that you've
21	conducted, what was the view of Walter Cronkite in terms
22	of public perception?
23	MR. KAISER: Object to form, relevance, lack of
24	foundation.
25	THE WITNESS: Walter Cronkite was the most
178
1	famous of all American newsmen of this generation. He
2	was the person who announced President Kennedy's death
3	on television. He was the person who some people say
4	brought down Lyndon Johnson by saying the American war
5	in Vietnam was not going -- ever going to go well. So
6	he was very well respected, a person people actually
7	cared about and trusted.
8	BY MR. DAVIS:
9	Q. What about television programs and movies? Did
10	they continue to convey information about the dangers of
11	smoking in the 1970s and 1980s?
12	A. Yes, they did.
13	Q. Do you have some examples of those to show to
14	the jury?
15	A. I do.
16	Q. All right. Let's go to the next clip. And it's
17	going to be AN_2588, AN_3144, AWX_6, AN_2550.
18	And before we show these clips, can we -- can
19	you tell us, Professor Hoffman, what we're going to see
20	and some of the -- some of the background information
21	about these particular movies?
22	A. Well, in -
23	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
24	THE WITNESS: -- these particular television
25	and, you know, movie theater movies, I've selected out
179
1	of, you know, dozens upon dozens that I could have.
2	I --1 was interested because the deposition said that
3	Mr. Ellsworth liked to watch television every night
4	after coming after work. He would watch two or three
5	hours with the family, that he -- they particularly
6	liked sitcoms. They watched all the old sitcoms, as his
7	son said.
8	Also, I wanted to pick movies, as I had done
9	before, which show people who were very well known at
10	the time. These are some of the most popular sitcoms
11	and movies. So, for example, Superman is with
12	Christopher Reeve, who was very famous; or Lethal
13	Weapon, this was when Mel Gibson really hit the airwaves
14	and was very -- became very famous.
15	One of these shows also has a particular
16	relevance: Happy Days. Pardon me, not -- yeah, Happy
17	Days because it was mentioned in the depositions and One
18	Day at a Time because that particular sitcom was
19	produced by Norman Lear. And Norman Lear was one of
20	those producers who cooperated with the American Cancer
21	Society to actually get some antismoking messages
22	into -- into actual sitcoms, including such programs as
23	All in the Family, which was another sitcom we simply
24	don't have time to watch. But there are lots and lots
25	of these. And so these are a sample.
1	MR. DAVIS: Great. If we can play the clips.
2	(A video clip was shown:
3	"--to drop in on you like this, Miss Lane, but
4	I've been thinking, you know, there must be a lot of
5	questions about me that people would like to know the
6	answers to."
7	"Of course. Yes."
8	"You really shouldn't smoke, you know, Miss
9	Lang."
10	"Don't tell me. Lung cancer. Right?"
11	"Well, not yet, thank goodness.")
12	(A video clip was shown:
13	"Sunday, Monday, happy days; Tuesday, Wednesday,
14	happy days; Thursday, Friday, happy days; the weekend
15	comes, the cycle hums, ready to race to you."
16	"Hey, Rich, that's Joanie. Tony's in the
17	Magnets."
18	"Oh, yeah. Good social club, you know, nice
19	bunch of girls. Yeah, she's really growing up."
20	"Yeah, I'll say. She's smoking and everything."
21	"What? No. She's not smoking."
22	"Oh, yeah?"
23	"I'll handle this. Now, both of you just sit
24	down, huh?"
25	"Oh, I'm sorry, Howard. I won't say anything."
1	"Me either."
2	"Now, Joanie —"
3	"I won't say that smoking leads to heart
4	attacks."
5	"Yeah, and lung disease."
6	"Joanie —"
7	"I won't say anything about some people thinking
8	that smoking might lead to cancer."
9	"Yeah, and all that tar and garbage gets into
10	your system, turns your lungs black."
11	"Will you two stop it?"
12	"Talk to Joanie."
13	"Who is the coolest of cool?"
14	"Well, you are."
15	"Yeah, that's true. Smoking ain't cool.")
16	(A video clip was shown:
17	"Did you start smoking?"
18	"I don't smoke."
19	"Your mustache is steaming. You going to put it
20	out?"
21	"Absolutely. Tastes terrible."
22	"Funny thing happens when my husband is not in
23	my bed: I wake up."
24	"Oh, hi."
25	"Smoking, huh? I'm going to tell the Surgeon
1	General on you.")
2	(A video clip was shown:
3	"Somebody might point out a couple of truths?
4	You're polluting yourself. You know you're polluting
5	yourself. You go right on polluting yourself. Nobody
6	here yet has mentioned the word 'cancer' or 'heart
7	attack' or 'stroke.' Those are all very real things,
8	you know."
9	"Sam, Sam, nobody's trying to say that it's easy
10	to stop. Now, I used to put away a pack before
11	breakfast. Then one day I saw an x-ray of my lungs.
12	Well, that did it for me, Pal. I joined a smoker's
13	group.")
14	(A video clip was shown:
15	"Here, you want a -- want a cigarette? Come on,
16	let's smoke. Take it."
17	"Yeah."
18	"Go on, take it. Here. We can take our time
19	and both die of cancer.")
20	BY MR. DAVIS:
21	Q. Professor Hoffman, what's the significance of
22	the discussions in these TV shows --
23	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
24	BY MR. DAVIS:
25	Q. — and movies --
183
1	MR. KAISER: Can't hear.
2	MR. DAVIS: Yeah, just --1 haven't finished the
3	question.
4	BY MR. DAVIS:
5	Q. Professor Hoffman, what's the significance of
6	these TV shows and films discussing the risks of
7	smoking, in terms of your opinions?
8	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
9	THE WITNESS: The significance of these kind of
10	references to the hazardous consequences of smoking
11	being wrapped into everyday films that people can just
12	see without even planning to see it is -- to me
13	indicates that -- that my historical research, all these
14	parts come together really; that as the polls showed, as
15	the public health officials were saying, this
16	information was out there, it was everywhere, and people
17	in their everyday lives were talking about things. So
18	when Bonnie Franklin, that actress, says, "I'm going to
19	tell the Surgeon General on you," again, she doesn't
20	need to -- we all know what the Surgeon General means in
21	that context. It means he's the conscience of America.
22	So she doesn't have to mention the 1964 report or
23	anything. It's that -- it's the way that pop culture
24	functions.
25
184
1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. With respect to one of the film clips we
3	watched, which was Happy Days, what was the popularity
4	of the sitcom Happy Days at -- during the time --
5	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
6	BY MR. DAVIS:
7	Q. — during the time period that it ran?
8	A. Well, Happy Days and also One Day at a Time were
9	amongst the longest running series and most popular
10	series on American television at that time. I think
11	they just -- you know, overwhelming in their popularity,
12	and the Nealson ratings extremely high and -- and ran
13	for a really long time in -- not only originally but
14	also reruns.
15	Q. Now, switching back to newspapers, in addition
16	to the articles on the dangers of smoking that you've
17	shown us, did the issue of smoking and cigarettes appear
18	anywhere else in the newspaper?
19	A. Yes. It appeared in cartoons. It appeared in
20	the business section. It appeared on health columns.
21	It appeared in advice columns, just pretty much every
22	section of the newspaper.
23	Q. And do we have some examples to show the jury of
24	some of those representatives that -- or let me back up.
25	Do we have some examples to show the jury of
185
1	where else the issue of the dangers of smoking occurred
2	in newspapers besides in news articles?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. All right. Let's go to Slide 61, ALN_242,
5	ALN_285, AFL_1462, AFL_237 are the articles reflected
6	there.
7	Again, is this -- were these the only articles
8	that you found that had to do with doctors and advice
9	columns?
10	A. No. I —
11	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
12	THE WITNESS: No. There were doctors and advice
13	columns, you know, from the '40s, through the '50s,
14	through the '60s, the '70s up -- up until Mr.
15	Ellsworth's death.
16	BY MR. DAVIS:
17	Q. And where do these particular doctors and advice
18	columns run? What newspaper?
19	A. Well, right -- what I'm showing here is the --
20	how they were printed in the Miami Herald. But some of
21	these were nationwide. Two of them, for example, on the
22	left you have Ann Landers. Her column on the upper
23	column says, "Our dad is smoking himself to death." The
24	bottom one said, "Hospital's program helped smoker
25	quit." So she--she did a lot about quitting and about
186
1	danger.
2	Ann Landers had a column. That's, you know, Ann
3	Landers column. And she was considered and, in fact,
4	was voted the most influential woman in America. She
5	had a column that ran every day for almost 50 years in
6	1200 newspapers around the country. So this is the
7	Miami Herald, but it ran many, many other places in
8	Florida and throughout the country.
9	In fact, she -- her obituary when she died in
10	2002, it was observed that she embodied the conventional
11	wisdom of America in the middle of the 20th century.
12	And the quote was, "As Ann Landers would have said, tip
13	the pizza guy, quit smoking, pay your taxes."
14	Q. Now, in some of the advice columns where the
15	issue of smoking was discussed, was the issue of
16	quitting smoking mentioned?
17	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
18	THE WITNESS: Yes. The emphasis of -- most
19	advice columns and doctors' columns was on quitting
20	because it was so apparent to people that the -- the
21	harms were well known. The question became how to
22	convince everybody, or as people as possible, to quit.
23	BY MR. DAVIS:
24	Q. Let me flip the question around a little bit.
25	In the advice columns that you reviewed, did -- what
187
1	were some of the subject matters that were discussed
2	about smoking?
3	A. Parents would write about how to keep their kids
4	from smoking. Kids would write about how to convince
5	their parents to stop smoking. Fiances would write
6	about how to convince their future spouses to stop
7	smoking. Ann Landers herself had a brother-in-law who
8	died from a smoking-related disease.
9	By the way, her sister was Abigail Van Buren,
10	Dear Abby. And Dear Abby's column -- so between the two
11	sisters, they had the whole advice column world sewn up.
12	Dear Abby ran in the DeLand Sun Times (sic). So when --
13	and also the Orlando Sentinel, both papers that
14	Mr. Ellsworth read after he read the Miami Herald. So
15	these were always advising people on how to take better
16	care of themselves.
17	Q. Was the issue of quitting smoking and how to
18	quit smoking covered during the 1960s, the 1970s, and
19	the 1980s in the Miami and DeLand, Florida, papers at
20	the times that Mr. Ellsworth was -- were living --
21	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
22	BY MR. DAVIS:
23	Q. — in each of those respective places?
24	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
25	THE WITNESS: Yes. It was covered in all of the
188
1	locales where he lived.
2	BY MR. DAVIS:
3	Q. Okay. Do you have some examples to show the
4	jury about those --
5	MR. KAISER: Object-
6	BY MR. DAVIS:
7	Q. — those particular pieces?
8	A. I do.
9	Q. All right. Let's go to --
10	MR. KAISER: Form.
11	BY MR. DAVIS:
12	Q. — the next slide, which is -- for the record,
13	it's AFL_1460, AFL_1457, AFL_244, AFL_429.
14	And, Professor Hoffman, can you tell us what
15	we're seeing here on this slide?
16	A. Yes. These were the kinds of articles that ran
17	very commonly, especially in the '60s, '70s, and '80s
18	after the Surgeon General's report, up until Mr. --
19	Mr. Ellsworth was diagnosed with lung cancer. And they
20	emphasized the benefits of quitting, that at any age, if
21	you quit, that you could begin to improve your health
22	and extend your life.
23	So the stop one, Miami Herald, "Quitting smoking
24	greatly cuts lung risk." The one below that, "Ceasing
25	smoking may save years." As you see on the bottom
189
1	right, it says, "Even people who have been smoking for
2	four or five decades decrease their risk of dying" --
3	pardon me -- "of cigarette-related diseases if they give
4	up the habit."
5	So that was one of the things that was really
6	emphasized to encourage people to -- to make a good
7	choice in relation to their health.
8	Q. What was the earliest article in the Miami
9	Herald that you found about how to quit smoking?
10	A. I --1 almost couldn't tell you off the stop.
11	Just don't know. There were articles about how to quit
12	smoking in the '50s. There were articles in the early
13	'60s. So there were a lot of programs that were devised
14	in the late '50s, early '60s because part of what
15	happened is that all kinds of smoking cessation programs
16	were invented.
17	The Seventh Day Adventists invented what was
18	called "The Five-day" and then eventually "The Ten-day
19	Program." American Cancer Society had something called
20	"Fresh Start." There was ones like Schick, trying to
21	remember the name of this one, "Smokers Anonymous." The
22	list goes on.
23	Q. Were -- were the --
24	A. So these were all talked about.
25	Q. Were articles about the benefits of smoking
190
1	discussed in the newspapers that Mr. Ellsworth's
2	families or acquaintances said that he had received?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. Okay. And then we have -- do we have a slide on
5	some of those representative articles?
6	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
7	THE WITNESS: Yes.
8	BY MR. DAVIS:
9	Q. All right. Let's go to the next slide, which
10	is -- the articles here are AFL_1460, AFL_1457, AFL_244,
11	AFL_429.
12	And can you tell us, Professor, what's depicted
13	on this particular slide?
14	A. Yes. These are all slides from the '60s through
15	the 1980s, you know, how 888,000 smokers stopped; best
16	way to quit: Abruptly and totally, which is what it
17	turns out the Surgeon General was also discovering, that
18	so-called cold turkey was actually the most effective
19	way to quit.
20	Up on the above, you see actually it was an
21	entire town decided they would all together go cold
22	turkey. Habit -- smokers kick habit in clinics. There
23	were a multiplicity of kinds of clinics that were
24	available, most of them, by the way, for free for
25	smokers if they would come.
191
1	Q. Yeah, and I think I misread the -- the exhibit
2	numbers. It's -- for this slide it's AFL_4084, ARA_845,
3	AFL_222, APS_7963, AFL_234.
4	Based upon the research that you conducted, do
5	you have an opinion about whether the information about
6	the benefits of quiting and how to quit was hidden from
7	view in Mr. Ellsworth's community from the 1960s to the
8	1980s?
9	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
10	THE WITNESS: This information wasn't hidden in
11	any way. Efforts were made to make it as blatant, as
12	widespread, as clear, as vivid as prevalent as possible,
13	and it was very prevalent.
14	BY MR. DAVIS:
15	Q. In your research did you find any evidence that
16	people were, in fact, quitting?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Do you have a slide to -- to explain this point?
19	A. I do.
20	Q. All right. Let's go to the next slide. It's --
21	for the record, it's AIW_470, exhibit number.
22	Please tell us what we're -- we're seeing here
23	on this slide.
24	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
25	THE WITNESS: What we're seeing on this slide
192
1	are the data that I've collected from newspapers and
2	magazines but also from the Surgeon General, who
3	continued to put out reports. And they found that, for
4	example, this trend continued, but between the years
5	1964 and 1982, 30 million smokers quit smoking. And, in
6	fact, by the end of the '80s, half of all living people
7	who had ever smoked had quit.
8	Now, in 1982 the entire population of Florida
9	was 10 million people. So if you, you know, take
10	30 million smokers, that's equivalent to three times the
11	population of Florida; so as if every baby, teenager,
12	man, woman, old person in Florida smoked, all of them
13	quit simultaneously times three. That's how many people
14	had quit in that relatively short period of time. I say
15	"short" because for historians that's an extraordinary
16	change in human behavior in a very short period of time.
17	And by the way, 95 percent of these went cold
18	turkey.
19	Q. Okay.
20	A. Some of the people who quit more or less in the
21	same period of time were also Mr. Ellsworth's brothers.
22	His older bothers both quit smoking.
23	Q. Now, we look at --1 think you mentioned earlier
24	that one of the things you looked at was public service
25	announcements that had been issued about the risks of
193
1	smoking. Is that one of the sources you looked at?
2	A. Yes, I did.
3	Q. And in your work and research for this case, did
4	you find any educational films that were produced by
5	public health organizations on the risks of smoking?
6	A. Yes. I found many educational films.
7	Q. Did you bring an example to show to the jury?
8	A. I did. I brought one.
9	Q. All right. Let's -- let's show this next clip.
10	And it's going to be AIW_397.
11	And before we see this, Professor Hoffman, can
12	you tell us what it is that we're about to see?
13	A. Yes. The American Lung Association was one of
14	the organizations that put together a long list of
15	original productions to -- and they distributed them to
16	classrooms around the country and to community
17	organizations. This particular one was kind of
18	interesting because it was made primarily by children.
19	One of the experts that it featured was Dr.
20	Charles Tate. Charles Tate was probably Florida's
21	leading I'd say voice in the antismoking campaign. He
22	spoke all around Florida in person and also appeared on
23	television specials.
24	Also, this is -- this was made by kids at around
25	the same time that Mr. Ellsworth's stepchildren were
194
1	growing up in his home. And -- and they themselves, in
2	the case of his younger daughter or youngest daughter
3	Kerri, had actually asked her father to stop smoking.
4	And so this is kind of what this familiar is about.
5	(A video clip was shown:
6	(Indiscernible) "And this is a special program
7	for" (indiscernible).
8	"You're probably wondering what this is all
9	about. Well, mainly we owe you an apology because you
10	may not like what you're about. Well, because most of
11	you smoke, and this program's about smoking and what it
12	can do to your lungs and your body. But every time we
13	tell you about it, you just pat us on the head and just
14	change the subject. So this is the most dramatic way we
15	could think of for you to really listen to us and do
16	something about it. We've got important people lined up
17	for this program. We've got film clips and artwork and
18	other important things. Here is some very grownup
19	information you might consider." (Indiscernible.)
20	"We now for go to Florida for a special
21	interview with Dr. Charles F. Tate, chief of the
22	(indiscernible) section of the Jackson Memorial Hospital
23	and associate professor of medicine at the University of
24	Miami. Our correspondent, Bill Snyder."
25	"Thank you, Bob.
195
1	"To help us understand what really goes on
2	inside our body while we breathe, here's Dr. Charles F.
3	Tate.
4	Dr. Tate, could you tell us why we breathe?"
5	"In order to get oxygen from the" --
6	"What is oxygen?"
7	"Oxygen is a form of gas. Of course, it's
8	combined with a lot of other gasses out in the
9	atmosphere. But the purpose of breathing is to get
10	oxygen part of the atmosphere down inside the lungs,
11	next to the little tiny blood vessels, where they can
12	pick up the oxygen and carry it to the tissues."
13	"We now switch to our correspondent in New
14	Jersey, Moreen Dillon."
15	"Thank you, Bob.
16	"Here in East Orange, New Jersey, we have the
17	privilege to interview Dr. Oscar Auerbach, who is senior
18	medical investigator of the Veteran's Hospital.
19	"How well was it proven that smoking causes
20	emphysema?"
21	"There has been definite proof that cigarette
22	smoke causes emphysema and lung cancer. As a matter of
23	fact, in many clinics throughout the United States where
24	they treat emphysema, the first requirement for these
25	patients before they receive a treatment is that they
196
1	stop smoking. So that, you see, that the doctors
2	throughout the United States have known for quite some
3	time that cigarette smoking definitely causes emphysema.
4	Here you see the actual lung of a nonsmoker. And here
5	you see the lung of a heavy smoker. And the big
6	difference, of course, between the two is that the lung
7	of the nonsmoker doesn't have any holes, or the ruptured
8	balloons that we talked about a little while back. Here
9	you see all of the ruptured balloons in the lungs. This
10	is the emphysema. And with all of these holes in his
11	lungs, we aren't surprised that this man couldn't live
12	any longer, because he had no lung with which to
13	breathe. You see, Moreen, cigarette smoking is more
14	than dangerous. We know that cigarette smoking causes
15	lung cancer. We know that cigarette smoking is involved
16	in many other diseases."
17	"Thank you, Dr. Dr. Auerbach."
18	"And now back to Bob Gordon at master control."
19	"Thank you, Moreen, and thanks to Dr. Auerbach.
20	"Please quit right now."
21	"Fade to black."
22	"What's going to happen now?"
23	"I don't know.")
24	BY MR. DAVIS:
25	Q. You mentioned that one of the sources you looked
197
1	at was public service announcements. Have you brought
2	some examples of those public service announcements to
3	show to the jury?
4	A. I --1 have.
5	Q. And what -- before we watch those clips, would
6	you tell us about how the public service announcements
7	got started and -- and some of the -- some of the
8	examples that you brought with you?
9	A. All right.
10	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
11	THE WITNESS: Well, public service announcements
12	are required by law, for the privilege of having air
13	space and air time, stations are required to put out a
14	certain amount of, well, public service announcements.
15	And so the American Lung Association, the American
16	Cancer Society, and other groups would provide to the
17	stations these clips, which they would then air for
18	free. So it was free advertising for the antismoking
19	movement.
20	And I wanted to bring just a few that were
21	representative that --1 found some of these, for
22	example -- the first one is called "Warnings." You'll
23	see why. I found that actually in the UCLA television
24	archives. That was aired during a -- many times, but I
25	saw it during an episode of To Tell the Truth, which was
1	a very popular game show.
2	After that there are some other ones which
3	feature major television stars like Larry Hagman, who
4	was very famous for the television show Dallas. And
5	also, there's another PSA by the American Lung
6	Association, which had a very famous slogan, and their
7	slogan was, "It's a matter of life and breath."
8	MR. DAVIS: Let's go ahead and play those clips.
9	And for the record, those are AN_947, AN_759.
10	(A video clip was shown:
11	"We'll receive many warnings in our life, and
12	sometimes they can save our life.
13	"This message is brought to you by the American
14	Cancer Society.")
15	(A video clip was shown:
16	"The moment you stop, in most cases the effects
17	of smoking will begin to reverse themselves till your
18	lungs are nice and clear again.")
19	(A video clip was shown:
20	"Do you know what would happen if you stopped
21	smoking cigarettes right now, right this minute? Well,
22	I'll tell you what would happen. Your lungs would
23	immediately start to repair themselves. Even if you've
24	been smoking for years and years, once you stop
25	assaulting your lungs, it's only a matter of time before
1	they're healthy and in the pink again. Now you have
2	every reason in the world to stop smoking cigarettes
3	because now you know what will happen if you do, and
4	what will happen if you don't.")
5	(A video clip was shown:
6	"My father smoked so much, he smelled of it. I
7	many his face, his hair, his clothes, everything had
8	that yucky smell, and he was always coughing."
9	"Sorry. But that's the way it was."
10	"I worried about him because in school we
11	learned about what cigarettes can do to your lungs."
12	"She sure let me and my lungs know."
13	"So one day I wrote to the Lung Association for
14	help. And they sent me this free information about how
15	to quit smoking."
16	"I didn't think it would help, but I promised to
17	try."
18	"It wasn't easy."
19	"The understatement of the year."
20	"But he quit."
21	"I really did."
22	"And if he can" --
23	"You can. But just remember, it was tough."
24	"Lung disease is tougher. So if you love
25	someone who smokes, write to your lung association for
1	help. Whether it's smoking, air pollution, or any lung
2	problem, your Lung Association cares about every breath
3	you take."
4	"Take it from me, they really do.")
5	BY MR. DAVIS:
6	Q. Why did you consider these particular public
7	service announcements?
8	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
9	THE WITNESS: I thought that these were
10	particularly representative. One of the things that we
11	know from the Surgeon General's own polling is that by
12	the late 1970s, half of all mothers reported that their
13	kids had encouraged them -- had urged them to stop
14	smoking. And this, of course, was the exact age which
15	the stepchildren and natural children of Mr. Ellsworth,
16	some of them did that, Kerri in particular. Some did
17	not, as we know. Sherri Hubbird said that she did not
18	warn her parents, though she knew it was hazardous, out
19	of respect for them. But the younger daughter actually,
20	you know, shared that information, very much like the
21	girl in that video.
22	So it's very -- it's very interesting, it's very
23	important, because it's really a part of this larger
24	picture about the prevalence of the information. And it
25	also does relate to the life story of Mr. Ellsworth.
201
1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. Do you know what the Great American Smokeout is?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. What is it?
5	A. Great American Smokeout was a program started by
6	the American Cancer Society to encourage everyone to
7	stop smoking at least one day a year. And it started in
8	the mid- 1970s in California, but it spread immediately
9	to Florida and was taken up and very much embraced. In
10	fact, it got to the point where the estimates were that
11	a third of all American smokers did quit for the one
12	day. And, of course, some stuck with it and some did
13	not.
14	Q. How many people participated in the Great
15	American Smokeout every year?
16	A. It varied year to year, but millions, you know,
17	tens of millions: 18 million, 20 million, 30 million
18	people.
19	Q. Did the Great American Smokeout receive any kind
20	of publicity?
21	A. It did.
22	Q. What -- what was the level of coverage that the
23	Great American Smokeout received?
24	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
25	THE WITNESS: The Great American Smokeout
202
1	received extraordinary coverage. It was acknowledged by
2	state governments. It was pushed by Dear Abby and Ann
3	Landers. It was publicized by newspapers. And -- and
4	the American Cancer Society itself took a very fond
5	approach. They really tried to do something different,
6	it say, Don't be so gloomy about it. You can do it, and
7	it can even be fun.
8	So they had celebrities like Larry Hagman and
9	Sammy Davis, Jr., and other prominent celebrities of the
10	time head it up. But sometimes they would just do
11	something really different, and they would have Dennis
12	the Menace or Mr. Potato Head head the American -- Great
13	American Smokeout. So all these were ways of generating
14	publicity around the importance of quitting and the
15	possibility of it.
16	BY MR. DAVIS:
17	Q. Did you bring some examples of newspaper
18	articles covering the Great American Smokeout in Miami
19	during the time period that Mr. Ellsworth lived there?
20	A. Yes, I did.
21	Q. All right. Let's go ahead and go to the next
22	slide. And this is slide -- the exhibits reflected
23	there are APS_7981, AFL_230, APS_8005, APS_8008.
24	And what newspaper did these articles appear in?
25	A. These all appeared in the Miami Herald, which
203
1	was the paper to which Mr. Ellsworth subscribed and that
2	he read. And as you can see, some of them say, "Take a
3	24-hour breather from -- from smoke," the group asked in
4	1978.
5	Bottom left, 1982, it says, "Smokeout sanity.
6	Do yourselves a favor." And it says -- the call-out
7	there is, The hazards of smoking are so evident, they
8	ought not need reiterating, unquote. Because the whole
9	point here was that you now know; it's your job --it's
10	up to you to quit.
11	In the far right it showed that one out of three
12	did try. And on that -- in answer to your last
13	question, it said a record 19 million at that -- on that
14	particular year in 1983.
15	Q. Did the Great American Smokeout receive any
16	publicity by way of television announcements or -- or
17	coverage?
18	A. Yes.
19	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
20	THE WITNESS: The Great American Smokeout was in
21	the usual television news stories. I mean, people like
22	Walter Cronkite. But it also got a lot of PSAs as well,
23	and special commercials devised and -- for the Great
24	American Smokeout.
25
204
1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. When you say "PSA," are you referring to public
3	service announcements?
4	A. Yes, I am. I'm sorry. Public service
5	announcements.
6	And I -- the two that I brought, I could show
7	you more, but one is from Ed Asner, who at that time was
8	a very well-known television actor, although he recently
9	starred as the voice in a movie called "Up," which is a
10	cartoon movie. But at that time he had been in shows
11	like Mary Tyler Moore and the Ed Asner Show.
12	After that I'm going to show you Sammy Davis,
13	Jr., who was a very famous entertainer, a very beloved
14	entertainer, again going back to the era of John Kennedy
15	and coming up through the -- through the 1980s.
16	Q. So you have some examples to show the jury of
17	these public service announcements on the Great American
18	Smokeout?
19	A. Yes, I do.
20	MR. DAVIS: All right. Let's play those two
21	clips, and they are AN_759, AN_3226.
22	(A video clip was shown:
23	"Hi. I'm Ed Asner. Last year the American
24	Cancer Society asked me to stop smoking just for a day.
25	I said, 'Okay, but just for a day.' That was November
205
1	16th. Well, I got through it. So I tried it again on
2	November 17th and 18th and 19th. And, you know, to this
3	day I still haven't had a cigarette. Why don't you try
4	it. Join the Great American Smokeout this November
5	15th. Tell yourself, It's just for a day.")
6	(A video clip was shown:
7	"You know, giving up smoking comes easy for some
8	people and hard for others. If you're a smoker like me,
9	try kicking the habit for just one day, on Thursday,
10	November the 17th. That's the date of the Great
11	American Smokeout. This is Sammy Davis, Jr., inviting
12	you to join me, along with a few million other
13	Americans, in making Thursday, November the 17th, truly
14	a smokeless Thursday. That means 24 hours, man, without
15	one of these things.")
16	BY MR. DAVIS:
17	Q. Who was Sammy Davis, Jr.?
18	A. Sammy Davis, Jr., was an entertainer, had been
19	since childhood; again, one of the most famous song and
20	dance men, I guess you could call him, of that era, so a
21	very beloved figure in that time period.
22	Q. Were the issues we've seen up to this point
23	concerning smoking cigarettes also covered in the town
24	of DeLand, Florida, where Mr. Ellsworth and his family
25	moved in 1985?
206
1	MR. KAISER: Object to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: Yes. The information about
3	hazards of smoking and also about the Great American
4	Smokeout were covered in DeLand.
5	And the Great American Smokeout, I -- last thing
6	I want to point out about that is it was every year the
7	week before Thanksgiving because part of the idea of
8	this was, Do it for your family. And that's the great
9	family holiday.
10	BY MR. DAVIS:
11	Q. Were -- were there articles in the DeLand
12	newspaper about the Great American Smokeout?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. Do you have some examples of articles that ran
15	in the DeLand newspaper about the Great American
16	Smokeout?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. All right. Let's show those to the jury.
19	That's Exhibit - Exhibits APS_8514, APS_8535, APS_8540.
20	And if you could tell us, what are -- what are
21	the -- what's -- what's shown on this slide?
22	A. Well, this is a combination of articles. It
23	talks about the top one, West Volusia. And Volusia
24	County is the county where DeLand is situated. DeLand's
25	a -- for those who don't know, it's a very small,
207
1	picturesque mid-Florida town, Central Florida town. And
2	their cancer unit was very active, the ACS, and they
3	joined the Smokeout.
4	And then some of the other articles talk about
5	ongoing things; such as on the far right, the Lung
6	Association offers a stop smoking clinic in August of
7	1986.
8	Q. What was the name of the newspaper in DeLand?
9	A. It was called the DeLand Sun News.
10	Q. And concerning the Great American Smokeout, do
11	we have some other examples of articles that ran in the
12	DeLand Sun News?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. All right. Let's go to the next slide. And
15	this is APS_8539, APS_8540, 8540 -- excuse me --
16	APS_8541, APS_8542, APS_8544, APS_8546, APS_2555,
17	ARA_2556, ARA_2557.
18	And what's shown on this particular slide?
19	A. Well, DeLand -- the DeLand Sun Times (sic) had
20	been going for a hundred years. And what really struck
21	me, when I -- when I went there and I --1 looked in the
22	newspaper, was the extraordinary attention that this
23	small town gave to the -- to the Great American
24	Smokeout.
25	This particular slide shows you only one -- one
208
1	time, one year's worth of Great American Smokeout news
2	coverage. But every year that Mr. Ellsworth was in
3	DeLand, there were articles every time that that came up
4	just before Thanksgiving. This particular slide, there
5	were actually -- on the day of the Great American
6	Smokeout, there were seven articles, on the left.
7	Actually there are a couple more than the ones I could
8	fit on one page.
9	And then after that they ran articles the next
10	day as well, including Dear Abby, et cetera. And then
11	for five days after that, they ran suggestions; you
12	know, day one, day two, day three, all the way up to day
13	seven, which was quit.
14	So this was a community that really cared. And
15	they head all kinds of fun activities. They would do a
16	thing where you could order for $3 a balloon and a card
17	to be sent to someone you loved saying, "Please quit."
18	One time they had students at Stetson University, which
19	is the college in that town, they had a "Adopt a smoker"
20	certificate, and you could adopt a smoker and help them
21	stop smoking. Other times they had somebody dress up as
22	what they called "Puff the Smokeless Dragon," and he
23	went to elementary schools. On one of the Great
24	American Smokeout dates, every child born in West
25	Volusia Memorial Hospital was given a T-shirt which
209
1	said, "I'm a bom nonsmoker." So the -- the county was
2	just really remarkable. And -- and all the time that he
3	lived there, there was this extraordinary effort.
4	Q. Let's go to the -- let's go to the next slide.
5	And with respect to the -- the DeLand Sun News
6	coverage that you saw, can you tell us what this slide
7	shows and about -- about what you found there?
8	A. Well, this just summarizes that -- that one time
9	in 1986, although I saw articles in '84 through the
10	early '90s. And that one -- on that particular occasion
11	there were ten articles in two days. Now, this was a
12	24-page newspaper. It was a very small county, local
13	newspaper. Then there was article every day for the
14	next five days. So there were 15 articles in seven days
15	on the Great American Smokeout.
16	Q. And was 1986 the only year that the Great
17	American Smokeout was covered by the DeLand Sun News?
18	A. No. It was covered every year, and every year
19	there were several articles.
20	Q. Let's talk about the -- we can go to the next
21	slide.
22	Professor Hoffman, what does this slide show us?
23	A. Well, this shows us around that same time that
24	Mr. Ellsworth moved to DeLand in 1985, once again the
25	Surgeon General and the U.S. Congress decided on
210
1	changing the warnings again. In this case they made
2	four warnings which rotated. And these are still the
3	warnings that are in effect today.
4	Q. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s and even the
5	1990s, was the state of Florida, and Miami
6	particularly -- let me back up for a second.
7	With respect to the 1970s, the 1980s, and even
8	the 1990s, based upon your historical research, how did
9	you view the state of Florida, and Miami in
10	particularly, in terms of their approach and stance
11	towards cigarette smoking?
12	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
13	THE WITNESS: Well, the city of Miami and also
14	the state of Florida were really leaders on this issue.
15	I mean, there were other states that were very concerned
16	about it too, and Florida and California and New York
17	all. But Miami, for example, was singled out by the
18	American Cancer Society for being the first -- one of
19	the very first, and possibly the first, city to actually
20	ban smoking in a number of public places. So there was
21	great attention to this where Mr. Ellsworth and his
22	family were living.
23	BY MR. DAVIS:
24	Q. Do you have a slide that shows some of the
25	research you did on the issue of what Miami and the
211
1	state of Florida did with respect to smoking and bans on
2	smoking?
3	A. Yes, I do.
4	Q. All right. Let's go to the next slide.
5	And, Professor Hoffman, can you tell us what's
6	shown here?
7	A. Yes. What this shows you is this building
8	towards what a later Surgeon General called the
9	smoke-free -- well, he was talking about Class of 2000,
10	but he was really hoping for a smoke-free world. They
11	didn't want to do legal prohibition, but they hoped to
12	encourage people to stop smoking and ban it as much as
13	possible.
14	So in 1973 city of Miami bans smoking in buses,
15	elevators, hospitals. '74, Florida banned it in
16	elevators. '78, Florida required separate smoking and
17	non-smoking areas in government buildings. 1985,
18	Florida passed what was called the Clean Air Act,
19	limiting smoking to only smoking sections. 1992,
20	Florida -- this is before Mr. Ellsworth died -- banned
21	all smoking in hospitals, schools, day care centers, and
22	other indoor spaces.
23	We know that he abided by some of these bans.
24	He did not smoke when his daughter was in the hospital,
25	for example. And -- and his stepson Rickey Maheu also
212
1	recalls these bans going into effect. So this was
2	another way that smokers were being warned. They were
3	being told, You can't do this here. And -- and that was
4	one way to try to encourage smokers also to stop
5	altogether.
6	Q. Based upon all the information that you looked
7	at in the sources of information that you've looked at
8	to assess and research the question you had for this
9	case, do you have a slide that summarizes your
10	opinions -- let me back up for a minute.
11	Do you have a slide that summarizes the
12	information environment that Mr. Ellsworth lived in and
13	worked in with respect to warnings about the dangers of
14	smoking?
15	A. Yes, I do.
16	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
17	BY MR. DAVIS:
18	Q. And let's go to that slide.
19	What does this slide show, and how -- how is --
20	and -- and why did you prepare this slide for purposes
21	of your opinions?
22	A. Well, you may remember the first slide, which
23	showed Mr. Ellsworth, this same picture, being
24	surrounded by institutions and sources of information.
25	And my question was, what information was available to
213
1	him and to others about the hazards?
2	So I started out by going to these institutions
3	and finding out what they were saying. And what I found
4	out is represented now in this slide, which is that all
5	around him throughout his entire life, he was receiving
6	warnings: Initially warnings from family; warnings in
7	school as a youngster; warnings through his church;
8	warnings from magazines and newspapers, especially
9	newspapers he took very regularly; warnings from
10	television and movies, and we know from testimony that
11	he was a very avid television watcher; warnings in slang
12	and songs, we know the slang was used around him, and
13	some of his favorite music was country western;
14	Warnings from the Surgeon General, of course, were on
15	every package after 1966, as well as in advertisements.
16	And all of this to me indicates exactly what I was
17	trying to say to begin with, that in my professional
18	research, what I found is that there was a massive
19	amount of information on the hazards of smoking that
20	surrounded Mr. Ellsworth throughout his lifetime.
21	Q. Was there any way for Mr. Ellsworth to not be
22	exposed to these warnings that we've discussed today?
23	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
24	THE WITNESS: No, not in my professional
25	opinion.
214
1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. Were the risks of smoking, including that it
3	causes lung cancer and that it was addictive, hidden
4	from Mr. Ellsworth?
5	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
6	THE WITNESS: No. This information was in no
7	way hidden.
8	BY MR. DAVIS:
9	Q. Do you have a slide that outlines the warnings
10	that Mr. Ellsworth received over the course of his life?
11	A. Yes, I do.
12	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
13	BY MR. DAVIS:
14	Q. Okay. Let's go and -- and let's go to the next
15	slide.
16	Professor Hoffman, can you explain for us these
17	next two slides and why you prepared them and -- for
18	purposes of your testimony today?
19	A. I prepared these slides because I think it's
20	important to understand not just what everybody out
21	there was getting but also the specific information that
22	Mr. Ellsworth was being exposed to, information that I
23	found in the depositions and the testimony that was
24	offered.
25	So, for example, I know, from my own research
215
1	but also from what one of his brothers said, that
2	smoking was banned in Rhode Island -- it was against the
3	law, for minors, that is -- and that schools taught
4	about these health hazards during the years he was
5	there, in very specific books.
6	Mr. Ellsworth's parents warned their sons
7	against smoking. They said it was bad for them. Mr.
8	Ellsworth's older brother Donald knew smoking was
9	hazardous and quit after 1948. He never allowed it in
10	his own home. Gilbert Stuart Junior High School, that
11	picture you saw at the beginning, the health teacher
12	there taught that smoking was bad for your health,
13	according to another brother, Richard Ellsworth.
14	From the 1950s through the 1990s up until his
15	death, Mr. Ellsworth subscribed to newspapers that
16	extensively covered the risks of smoking, including lung
17	cancer and addiction. He watched television news and
18	kept on current events. All the depositions say that,
19	are very consistent on that point.
20	Mr. Ellsworth's stepdaughter Sherri Hubbird, who
21	is the plaintiff, told her parents that their smoking
22	made her sick actually, although that did not lead them
23	to quit. Sherri also urged her father to quit. In 1982
24	he -- she told him, "It's not healthy." According to
25	one deponent, quote, He smiled and walked back out.
1	And then I have one other slide, if you don't
2	mind.
3	Q. Yep.
4	A. Thank you.
5	Q. Let's go to the next slide. Yep.
6	A. Thank you.
7	Around 1969 Mr. Ellsworth caught his stepsons,
8	two stepsons, smoking and made them smoke a cigar all
9	the way to the end to deter them from taking up the
10	habit, because he didn't want them smoking.
11	In the 1970s, '80s, afterwards, Mr. Ellsworth's
12	son -- stepson Rickey used the terms "cancer sticks" and
13	"coffin nails" around his stepfather, who never said
14	that he was confused about what that meant. It was used
15	as a common term.
16	Then also, in 1977 Mr. Ellsworth's daughter
17	Kerri talked with him about a paper she wrote in junior
18	high school as a part of a school assignment on tobacco
19	and nicotine and -- and urged him to quit. Kerri
20	Ellsworth was sure her father saw PSAs -- she saw them,
21	she remembered them, some of the kinds that we just
22	saw -- about smoking and cigarettes.
23	Mr. Ellsworth's daughter-in-law -- she was
24	married to Rickey Maheu -- she knew smoking was harmful
25	when she started and smoked alongside and believes that
Ill
1	in Ellsworth understood it just as she did. She also
2	recalled multiple Surgeon General's warnings on
3	television and elsewhere, that all the -- the ways in
4	which the Surgeon General's message was broadcast across
5	America.
6	And lastly, Mr. Ellsworth, his mother-in-law,
7	who's I believe 99 years old now, she told her family,
8	including her son-in-law, in 1986 that smokers were
9	addicts.
10	Q. So based upon the historical record and your
11	research that you did in this case, do you have a
12	professional opinion regarding the amount of information
13	available to Mr. Ellsworth about the dangers of smoking?
14	MR. KAISER: Objection. Form, repetitive.
15	THE WITNESS: It's my professional conclusion
16	that the amount of information available to
17	Mr. Ellsworth during his lifetime was massive concerning
18	the hazards of smoking, including lung cancer and
19	addiction.
20	BY MR. DAVIS:
21	Q. Based upon the research that you did and the
22	historical record that you reviewed, do you have a
23	professional opinion regarding the amount -- well,
24	strike that.
25	Do you -- have you -- do you hold your opinions
1	that you've expressed here to a reasonable degree of
2	professional certainty in your field as an historian?
3	MR. KAISER: Objection to form.
4	THE WITNESS: Yes, absolutely. It's with great
5	professional certainty, I can say that this information
6	was widely out there; that it was targeted at people
7	like Mr. Ellsworth; and that information, you know, was
8	received.
9	MR. DAVIS: Thank you, Doctor. I don't have any
10	further questions at this time.
11	Allan, do you want to take a break, or you want
12	to start right in?
13	MR. KAISER: I'll start right in.
14	MR. DAVIS: Let me ask the court reporter, are
15	you okay --
16	THE REPORTER: Does anyone need a break?
17	I think there's someone in the room who needs a
18	break.
19	MR. DAVIS: Okay. Allan, will you give us a
20	couple minutes?
21	MR. KAISER: Yeah.
22	MR. DAVIS: Okay. Thanks.
23	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record, the time is
24	3:19 p.m. This marks the end of Media No. 3.
25	(Off record)
219
1	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the record, the time
2	is 3:25 p.m. This marks the beginning of Media No. 4.
4	EXAMINATION
5	BY MR. KAISER:
6	Q. Dr. Hoffman, good afternoon.
7	A. Good afternoon.
8	Q. I believe you have a master's degree from
9	Stanford from 1984. Is that correct?
10	A. That's correct.
11	Q. And a Ph.D. from Stanford in 1988?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. And your Ph.D., I believe your dissertation was
14	in foreign relation in the '40s and '50s. Is that
15	correct?
16	A. It was in American history with an emphasis on
17	foreign relations from the 1930s through the '60s or
18	'70s, about.
19	Q. Do you recall in the Belinger case you testified
20	at a deposition?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And in that case the deposition page 8, line 20,
23	21, "The topic of my dissertation was American foreign
24	relations in the '40s and '50s." Do you remember
25	answering a question as to what your topic of
220
1	dissertation was, and that was your answer?
2	MR. DAVIS: Do you have the testimony to show
3	the witness?
4	MR. KAISER: No. I don't think I need to show
5	the witness. I'm just reading it.
6	MR. DAVIS: Yeah, I just don't know if she --1
7	think she needs it in front of her if you're going to --
8	if you're going to question her about it.
9	MR. KAISER: Well, if she wants to, you know,
10	contend that my reading is wrong, I'm just asking.
11	BY MR. KAISER:
12	Q. Do you recall the Belinger case?
13	A. Yes, I do recall the Belinger case.
14	Q. And do you recall, again, the question on line
15	18, "What was your -- what was the topic of your
16	dissertation?"
17	"Answer: The topic of my dissertation was
18	American foreign relations in the 1940s and 1950s."
19	MR. DAVIS: Object to-
20	BY MR. KAISER:
21	Q. Do you recall that question and answer from the
22	Belinger deposition?
23	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
24	THE WITNESS: No, I don't recall the specific
25	question and specific answer. It sounds logical, but I
221
1	don't --1 haven't looked at that in quite a few years,
2	I think.
3	BY MR. KAISER:
4	Q. That's very well. Do you recall, ma'am, is your
5	dissertation in foreign relations in the '40s and '50s?
6	A. Yes. That's -- that's part of it. It does
7	spread out from there into the '30s and a little bit
8	later. But that would be a fair characterization.
9	Q. And can you tell me, ma'am, how you prepared for
10	your testimony today for the jury?
11	A. Well, I prepared, as I discussed earlier, by
12	doing the research, reading the depositions and other
13	case materials, by going to the archives, as I've
14	discussed, reading through all of those materials,
15	preparing slides, and -- and such things.
16	Q. And if I could stop you, I don't mean to talk
17	about preparation for your testimony and opinions. I
18	mean your testimony for today in response to questions
19	by your attorney --
20	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
21	BY MR. KAISER:
22	Q. -- and for cross-examination.
23	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
24	THE WITNESS: Well, if I understand the question
25	correctly, how I prepared for it was to work up these
222
1	slides and to meet with the attorneys to discuss the
2	slides with them and show them the information I wanted
3	to show the jury.
4	BY MR. KAISER:
5	Q. Now, you don't mean that you actually prepared
6	slides yourself, do you?
7	A. Well, yes, I did. I didn't type out -- in these
8	PowerPoints I did not do all of the typing. There was
9	an attorney assistant who actually did the physical
10	typing because they have to coordinate the -- the
11	electronic records that -- so everybody has the same
12	record. But I prepared them in the sense that I
13	selected articles, I selected quotes, et cetera. So I
14	consider that as preparing. I would consider them done
15	under my authorship.
16	Q. Can you tell me what attorneys you spoke to
17	about your testimony today?
18	A. Well, the attorney I spoke with who was helping
19	me prepare the slides was an attorney named Anthony
20	Martucci, and I also spoke with the attorney who is
21	present here who put on the direct examination, and a
22	couple of others.
23	Q. When did you meet with Mr. Davis?
24	A. I'm sorry. Mr. Davis? Oh, oh. I'm — I —
25	Q. Yeah, he should be the man sitting next to you
223
1	in the room in Los Angeles.
2	A. I'm very sorry. Well, actually we're in San
3	Diego.
4	Q. San Diego. Well, I'm not, so --
5	A. That's fine.
6	Mr. Davis I met for the first time in July, I
7	believe it was, the first time we met. So we met once
8	in July, and -- and then we met again yesterday.
9	Q. And how long did you meet yesterday?
10	A. Yesterday for about three hours.
11	Q. What did you discuss yesterday for three hours?
12	A. Well, we went over these slides that he and I
13	had not gone over together that I had been preparing.
14	So as you saw, it takes a while to go through them.
15	Q. Did you go through the questions and the answers
16	that you were going to provide to those questions?
17	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: A little but generally not. What
19	we primarily talked about were the slides.
20	BY MR. KAISER:
21	Q. So you had no idea what the questions were going
22	to be until you first heard them today?
23	A. Well, I --1 did in the sense that these were --
24	these were the slides I wanted to show. And so I did
25	know he was going to ask me about them. But that's --
224
1	not beyond that.
2	Q. When you met with Mr. Davis in July, how long
3	did you meet?
4	A. Oh, I think, again, probably three or four
5	hours. But I --1 don't recall the specific amount of
6	time. It was part of a day.
7	Q. What was the reason for meeting for three to
8	four hours in July with Mr. Davis?
9	A. Well, it was important for me to share with
10	Mr. Davis the results of my research and the case
11	materials that I had read and -- and to talk them over
12	with him to bring him up to date with what I had
13	discovered in places like Providence and DeLand.
14	Q. Now, how many trials have you testified in on
15	behalf of tobacco companies?
16	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
17	THE WITNESS: I've testified - I've given
18	expert witness testimony --1 don't have the exact
19	number. I -- under a dozen, I guess, something like
20	that. Eight or nine, in there.
21	BY MR. KAISER:
22	Q. Now, let me go back to your qualifications for a
23	moment, if I might. You began your teaching career at
24	the University of California San Diego?
25	A. That's correct.
225
1	Q. In 1988?
2	A. That's correct.
3	Q. I believe your C.V. indicates you were a
4	lecturer in 1988 and 1989?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. You became a full professor in 1998 at the San
7	Diego State University?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. A full professor, that means you're at the top
10	rank of the professor ladder, if you will. Correct?
11	A. Well, at the top rank of the normal ladder. An
12	endowed professor would generally be considered above
13	that. But, yes, professors normally top out at full
14	professor.
15	Q. And I'm going to get there. You're also an
16	endowed chair. Right?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. Which is recognition of having a special
19	preeminence in research. Correct?
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. When you became a full professor, can you tell
22	me how that came about?
23	A. Well, I had previously -- between those two
24	appointments you mentioned, I had worked for ten years
25	at the University of San Diego, which is a private
226
1	university here in town. And I was an associate
2	professor there and also chair of the history
3	department, an administrative chair. And then I was
4	encouraged to, but also thought to, apply for an endowed
5	position over at San Diego State, which is just across
6	town here in San Diego. And -- and so I applied for
7	that. And at the time I applied for it, I was actually
8	an associate professor, but they -- you know, they made
9	me a very good offer to come over as a full professor as
10	well as an endowed chair. So it happened together.
11	Q. And you are an endowed chair -- you're the
12	Dwight Stanford chair in American foreign relations U.S.
13	and Latin America. Correct?
14	A. "U.S. and Latin America" is not normally a part
15	of the title, but the first part is.
16	Q. Is your -- am I correct that your Web site at
17	the San Diego State University under research interests
18	lists "Dwight B. Stanford chair in American foreign
19	relations U.S. and Latin America"?
20	A. I'm not aware of it being phrased that way. It
21	could be. I'm not looking at it. I--1 would suspect
22	there would be a comma in there or something because the
23	title is "Dwight Stanford chair in American foreign
24	relations," and that's the end of the title. But they
25	may have typed it in that way.
227
1	Q. Yeah, I didn't find the comma. I'm just reading
2	from it. But whatever your recollection is.
3	When you applied for that endowed position, did
4	the people who passed on your application consider your
5	publishing at the time?
6	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
7	THE WITNESS: Yes. They would hire a scholar
8	based on the scholar's publication record.
9	BY MR. KAISER:
10	Q. And you are encouraged, if not required, to
11	publish as a professor. Correct?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. And you did publish fairly extensively, did you
14	not? And you continue to do so today. Correct?
15	A. That's -- that's correct.
16	Q. At the time of your application for the endowed
17	position, you had published specifically in the area of
18	foreign relations, hadn't you?
19	A. Yes, in a way broadly defined, because my second
20	book was on the history of the Peace Corps, which was
21	also a book about the history of the 1960s.
22	Q. And publishing, you had written books that
23	concerned public -- foreign relations. Correct?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. You had written peer-reviewed articles that
228
1	dealt with foreign policy or foreign relations.
2	Correct?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. I believe you'd written reviews for books that
5	dealt with foreign policy. Correct?
6	A. Yes, among other topics.
7	Q. And these would have been things that would have
8	normally been considered by the committee that was
9	reviewing your application. Correct?
10	A. Yes. They would have considered my publication
11	record.
12	Q. Would the committee have also considered other
13	experience, like lecturing?
14	A. Not normally. They would have -- they were, and
15	would have been, interested in my teaching abilities and
16	teaching record, not so much lecturing.
17	Q. You do include lectures on your C.V., do you
18	not?
19	A. I include some, and I don't include others.
20	Q. Would they have considered your peer-reviewed
21	articles that you had written?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. Would they have considered service to the
24	university --to the university community?
25	A. They may have. That would be less important in
229
1	the case of an endowed chair.
2	Q. Is service to the university community important
3	in any other respects?
4	A. Yes, it's important. It's a part of what's
5	considered being a good citizen really of the
6	university. So that might include such things as being
7	on university committees. Of course, my service went
8	beyond that. But it -- it could be important, and it's
9	an -- it's just a part of your job.
10	Q. And so in order for you to obtain the Dwight
11	Stanford chair in American foreign relations and to be a
12	distinguished scholar, you would have been expected to
13	publish in the area of American foreign relations.
14	Correct?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. And you did?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Now, you also -- at some point from 2012 to
19	2014, you were the chair of the post-tenure review
20	committee?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Could you tell me about that?
23	A. Yes. In universities it's -- one job of the
24	faculty is to review other faculty and to make sure that
25	they are doing research and performing their job. And
230
1	so post-tenure review, it means once a person already
2	has tenure, they should still, however, be held to
3	standards of performance. And so one of the jobs I did
4	was to serve on the post-tenure review committee and
5	reviewed my colleagues.
6	Q. And when you reviewed the colleagues, would this
7	be a face-to-face meeting, or would you just review
8	without them being present? How would that work?
9	A. Well, it could take a number of forms.
10	Different people do it differently. Some professors --
11	I didn't do this, but some professors like to go see the
12	teaching performance of other professors. Often we
13	simply rely on the materials that are given to us. Or,
14	for example, if we know a colleague has published a
15	book, I'll go to the library and look at the book, read
16	the book. So there -- oh, also we look at course
17	evaluations -- that's very important -- to know, is the
18	person a good teacher; are they communicating
19	effectively with their students; are they being fair to
20	their students? So those are some of the materials that
21	we'd look at to answer that question.
22	Q. So as just an example, a hypothetical, if you
23	were considering, as the chair of the post-tenure review
24	committee, a tenured professor in the area of Chinese
25	studies, you would -- you would expect to see some
231
1	publications from this tenured professor in the area of
2	her specialty, Chinese history?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. Okay. And you would expect that this tenured
5	professor would be teaching in the area of Chinese
6	history?
7	A. Well, she or he may or may not. Sometimes
8	professors teach what are called service courses. That
9	person may, for example, not teach Chinese history for a
10	good long time if they're needed to teach world history
11	or the history of all Asia or something like historical
12	methods. So it would depend, and -- and that would be
13	worked out with the department.
14	Q. But you would certainly review publications to
15	see if this tenured professor was publishing either
16	peer-reviewed articles or writing textbooks in her
17	specialty or his specialty of Chinese history. Correct?
18	A. Yes. We would be looking at their publication
19	record.
20	Q. Now, you first became recruited to become an
21	expert witness for these tobacco cases sometime in 1999.
22	Is that correct?
23	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
24	THE WITNESS: I was asked if I would be
25	interested in doing research on the question of public
1	awareness in 1999. The --
2	BY THE WITNESS:
3	Q. I believe a man named Michael Schaller was the
4	person who first contacted you?
5	A. Yes. Another historian who had undertaken
6	similar research contacted me and asked me if I would be
7	interested in doing it.
8	Q. Was Michael Schaller an academic professor or an
9	academic historian at the time he contacted you in 1999?
10	A. Yes. He was a full professor in Arizona.
11	Q. At the University of Arizona?
12	A. That's right.
13	Q. Contacted you -- do you know if he had testified
14	yet in any tobacco case at the time that he contacted
15	you?
16	A. No, I --1 don't know.
17	Q. Ultimately, I guess you decided that you would
18	assist in this endeavor. Correct?
19	A. Well, I thought it was an interesting question.
20	So, yes, I did the decide to -- to go forward.
21	Q. You came to know a lawyer named Allen Purvis.
22	Correct?
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. Allen Purvis was at a particular law firm, and
25	that was the person that you had contact with. Correct?
233
1	A. Yes. Mr. Purvis contacted me.
2	Q. And you -- that was your contact person in
3	connection with your expert witness assignment.
4	Correct?
5	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
6	THE WITNESS: Well, there were -- there were
7	three attorneys at that firm. There were three named
8	attorneys. It was called Johnson Tyler & Purvis. So I
9	actually had contact with all three of them at different
10	times.
11	BY MR. KAISER:
12	Q. And how long did you have contact with
13	Mr. Purvis or two other people?
14	A. Well, I had contact with them up until the time
15	that that particular firm disbanded. And I believe
16	I'm -- that was in 2004,1 believe; 2003, 2004.
17	Q. So at the time that Mr. Schaller contacted you
18	in 1999, is it true that you did not have any specialty
19	in tobacco and health?
20	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
21	THE WITNESS: I had never done research into
22	those questions deeply. So that -- that was not an area
23	in which I had yet done research.
24	BY MR. KAISER:
25	Q. And at that time you had no specialty in public
1	knowledge or awareness of the health risk of smoking.
2	Correct?
3	A. No. I had a general awareness as -- as an
4	American historian of the -- primarily the 20th century.
5	But I had never done specialized research on that up to
6	that point.
7	Q. You had no subspecialty at that time in tobacco
8	and health, or public knowledge of the health risk of
9	smoking, did you?
10	A. No. I had done public awareness research
11	related to other things but never in relation to that.
12	Q. In 1999 you had not written any books on tobacco
13	and health or public knowledge of the health risk of
14	smoking. Correct?
15	A. No.
16	Q. In 1999 you had not written any peer-reviewed
17	articles on the subject of tobacco and health and public
18	knowledge of the health risk of smoking, had you?
19	A. No. I had not done that up to that point.
20	Q. In 1999 you had not lectured to any professional
21	associations on the subject of tobacco and health and
22	the public knowledge or awareness of the health risk of
23	smoking, had you?
24	A. No, not at that point.
25	Q. In 1999 you had not lectured to any public
1	health agencies on tobacco and health and public
2	awareness or knowledge of the health risk of smoking,
3	had you?
4	A. No. Historians normally wouldn't lecture to
5	public health agencies. But, no, I had not.
6	Q. In 1999 you had not applied for any fellowships
7	directed to any research projects on the issues of
8	tobacco and health and public knowledge of the health
9	risk of smoking, had you?
10	A. No. There are many other subjects that I had
11	not yet researched that I have subsequently researched
12	as well. But, no, I hadn't done that up to that point.
13	Q. At this time in 1999, you did not serve on any
14	review committees where you reviewed any articles on
15	tobacco and health or public knowledge of the health
16	risk of smoking. Correct?
17	A. No. That had not been a part of my review.
18	Q. In 1999 you had not written any book reviews on
19	books on tobacco and health and public knowledge of the
20	health risk of smoking, had you?
21	A. No. There were very few books at that time on
22	that subject even, but yes.
23	Q. In 1999 had you taught any courses exclusively
24	on the tobacco industry and public awareness of the
25	dangers of smoking?
1	A. No. I'd only taught general American history,
2	which would include references to tobacco industry, but
3	no specialized courses.
4	Q. Did you consider yourself at that time in 1999
5	to be an expert on the issue of tobacco and health?
6	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
7	THE WITNESS: Oh, no. No. I - it was an
8	expertise that I developed subsequently.
9	BY MR. KAISER:
10	Q. Did you consider yourself at that time in 1999
11	to be an expert on the issue of public knowledge of the
12	health risk of tobacco?
13	A. No. That was a subsequent effort.
14	Q. Did you consider yourself in 1999 to be an
15	expert on the subject of the addictive nature of
16	nicotine?
17	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: No, and I'm not a medical expert
19	now either.
20	BY MR. KAISER:
21	Q. Did you consider yourself in 1999 to be an
22	expert on the subject of addiction in general?
23	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
24	THE WITNESS: No. I'm not an expert then or now
25	on addiction in general.
237
1	BY MR. KAISER:
2	Q. Did you consider yourself in 1999 to be an
3	expert on the subject of cigarette design?
4	A. No.
5	Q. In 1999 you had not yet testified about tobacco
6	and health and the public knowledge of the health risk
7	of tobacco, had you?
8	A. No. That was 15 -- that was years later.
9	Q. You told us how you began, then, your research
10	efforts. From the time that you were first contacted by
11	Michael Schaller in 1999, how long was it before you
12	were deposed for the first time on the subject matter of
13	tobacco and health?
14	A. I --1 don't -- it's been a while, of course. I
15	don't have the precise dates in front of me. But I
16	think it was approximately a year and a half or two
17	years. So I was engaged in very intensive research, as
18	I would for a book, for example, which often takes a
19	couple of years' worth of research before you can
20	actually write anything. So I believe I started 1999.
21	I think it was 2001 before I was deposed the first time,
22	as I recall it.
23	Q. When you began your research efforts, were you
24	aware that the firm where you're at right now, Jones
25	Day, had a huge library of various movie snippets and
238
1	things like that dealing with tobacco and health?
2	A. No. I had never heard the name Jones Day at
3	that point.
4	Q. Did you come to learn that Jones Day and other
5	law firms had extensive libraries of newspapers on the
6	subject of tobacco and health?
7	A. Well, I came to learn that -- that they had
8	information. Apparently they had been trying these
9	cases, and so they did have information on these
10	matters, some of which I have and some of which they had
11	subsequently.
12	Q. Did you come to learn that these law firms had
13	extensive libraries that included all of these Reader's
14	Digest articles that you have alluded to today?
15	A. You know, I'm just not familiar with their
16	libraries. This is the first time I've been at Jones
17	Day here in San Diego, this very afternoon. So I --
18	I --1 do know that they have these information, and
19	that's how I was able to work with, you know, putting
20	together these slides, because they have the same
21	information. Of course, I provided much information to
22	them. I assume they keep it, but I --1 don't know in
23	what form and if they have an actual library or not.
24	Q. Well, just so we're clear, when you say "I
25	assume they have this information," what is the
239
1	information of which you're speaking?
2	A. Well, for -- for example, you mentioned Reader's
3	Digest or Miami Herald. They would have this
4	information as well. So that, for example, if I would
5	say to them, you know, there's an article from 1962, and
6	here's the article, and I have it, and I'll find out, do
7	you have that article? And it's always been my
8	experience that they have the article as well. But
9	it's -- it's I who am saying, Do you have this article?
10	So I hope that answers your question.
11	Q. And then that the snippets of songs that you
12	showed us today, particularly the "Smoke Smoke Smoke
13	That Cigarette" song, do you know that?
14	A. Yes, I know the song.
15	Q. I didn't ask if you know the song. I'm asking
16	you, did you know the law firms had access to that
17	particular song; and, in fact, many, many other
18	historians use that same song?
19	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
20	BY MR. KAISER:
21	Q. Do you know that?
22	A. Oh, yes. I'm aware that that song has been used
23	widely.
24	Q. By historians that testify on behalf of tobacco
25	companies. Correct?
240
1	A. That I have to assume. I assume that some other
2	historians have used it as well. It's a very well-known
3	song, so that makes sense.
4	Q. (Inaudible) to other historians that do this
5	type of work for tobacco companies, haven't you?
6	MR. DAVIS: Object to the-
7	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. I couldn't hear that
8	question.
9	BY MR. KAISER:
10	Q. You have spoken to other historians that do the
11	same type of work that you do on behalf of tobacco
12	companies, haven't you?
13	A. Oh, well, I --1 certainly have on occasion.
14	You mentioned Michael Schaller, who's a colleague, and
15	I've spoken to him many times about a variety of topics
16	over the years, including this.
17	Q. And I believe Michael Schaller on occasion has
18	provided you newspaper articles from the Miami area, has
19	he not?
20	A. I don't recall as I'm sitting here getting
21	newspaper articles from Michael Schaller from the --
22	from the Miami area. He and I have sometimes exchanged
23	information. I just don't recall pertaining -- for
24	example, in Miami he and I both went to the Wolfson
25	Archives and were both trying to get the -- the same
241
1	video there. So there have been times we've
2	collaborated, which is commonplace with historians. We
3	often share information about a variety of topics.
4	Q. You've talked to a historian in the past,
5	Stephen Ambrose. Correct?
6	A. No. I --1 never met Stephen Ambrose. Or I —
7	I never spoke with him before he died.
8	Q. You've talked to Lacy Ford, who is an historian
9	that testifies on behalf of tobacco companies. Correct?
10	A. Yes. That's right. I've spoken with Dr. Ford
11	on the phone before.
12	Q. Have you ever talked to James Kirby Martin, who
13	also is an historian who testifies on behalf of tobacco
14	cases?
15	A. Yes. I know Dr. Martin.
16	Q. And I believe in the past you've read prior
17	deposition testimony of certain historians?
18	A. You know, I think I did once, a historian by the
19	name of Jeff Norrell. I think I did once. I -- it's
20	been quite a long time. But I'm sorry -- I'm sorry I'm
21	not able to give you a more precise answer about that.
22	I --1 might have done so. I'm vaguely remembering that
23	from seven or eight years ago.
24	Q. What would have been the reason for reading
25	another historian's deposition testimony?
242
1	A. Oh, and I can't even remember what the specific
2	case was. You know, it might have been --1 just don't
3	really remember. It might have been because I was going
4	to meet with the -- the same attorney or something and
5	just kind of curious about that attorney and what kinds
6	of questions they would have so I could make sure that I
7	had the information they needed.
8	Q. Did you read any depositions other than those
9	depositions taken in this particular case for your
10	preparation today ?
11	A. I'm sorry. What do you mean?
12	Q. Well, did you read your deposition that was
13	taken in the Belinger case, for example?
14	A. No, I did not.
15	Q. Did you read any depositions that had been taken
16	of you in prior cases, in preparation of your testimony
17	today?
18	A. No, I did not.
19	Q. Have you read any trial testimony of any
20	historians that testify on behalf of tobacco companies?
21	A. No. I don't recall doing so. I--1 just
22	don't --1 don't recall it. If I -- something may have
23	come across my desk a decade or so ago, but I just --
24	not that -- not -- not that I'm remembering.
25	Q. Have you seen a copy of your disclosure
243
1	statement that was sent to us in this case?
2	A. Yes, I have.
3	Q. Did you write that disclosure statement?
4	A. No. That disclosure statement was put together
5	by the attorneys. It's -- it's kind of a boilerplate.
6	It just says who I am. I always review it to make sure
7	that it's correct. But it's just a paragraph or two.
8	So I did not compose it personally. Been using the same
9	one for ten years.
10	Q. The one that I've got in front of me is
11	multi-paragraphs that starts out with "Area of
12	Expertise," and then there's a paragraph. It has
13	another heading, "Subject Matter of Expert Testimony,"
14	and a paragraph. It has another heading, "Substance of
15	Facts and Opinions," and a paragraph. It has another
16	heading, "Summary of Grounds for Opinions," and a
17	paragraph. It has another heading, "Fees and Sworn
18	Testimony and Other Legal Matters," and a paragraph.
19	Does that sound like your disclosure statement?
20	A. It does. I'm sorry. I just don't have it in
21	front of me like you do to remember it quite as well.
22	But, yes, it's a basic -- fairly basic statement is how
23	I think of it.
24	Q. Your area of expertise says that you are a
25	professional academic historian. Is that correct?
244
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. Can you tell me for purposes of today, and
3	you've rendered some opinions, what gives your expertise
4	for you to render the opinions that you have done so
5	today?
6	A. My expertise is that I'm an American historian,
7	meaning I'm a person who's trained, who has a Ph.D. in
8	historical research of the United States. I have done
9	significant in-depth primary research using the standard
10	historical professional guidelines for doing such
11	research. And -- and I'm fully qualified to do that.
12	That's exactly what I do in every project I've ever
13	undertaken. And I follow the exact same method.
14	Q. I understand. I think my question was a little
15	bit different. I'm asking, what is your expertise? Are
16	you an expert in the subject of tobacco and health?
17	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: Well, that's - that's too broad.
19	I'm an expert on the question of the information that
20	was available in the United States throughout the 20th
21	century on the hazards of smoking, including lung cancer
22	and -- and addiction. And that's the area of that topic
23	that I am expert in.
24	BY MR. KAISER:
25	Q. On that topic alone, you are an expert, correct,
245
1	the --
2	A. The topic of public awareness and information on
3	the hazards of smoking, that's the element of that topic
4	on which I am an expert.
5	Q. Now, in your disclosure, anywhere in there does
6	it say that you are an expert in that area, in that
7	subject matter?
8	A. To me that's the -- that's the meaning of that
9	disclosure, but I don't have it in front of me. Perhaps
10	I could be shown a copy, and then I'll be able to
11	comment better.
12	Q. Now, you talked today for several hours about
13	the different types of information to which David
14	Ellsworth was exposed. And one of the things that you
15	talked about was Reader's Digest. Correct?
16	A. Correct.
17	Q. Can you tell me the number of articles that you
18	have seen published in Reader's Digest that talk about
19	smoking and health?
20	A. I can't tell you the exact number. I don't
21	recall it. Somehow like the number 130, 150, in there,
22	is what is ringing a bell for me. It's over a period of
23	a number of decades.
24	Q. And I'm just -- just bear with me. I'm trying
25	to find one of your slides that we were provided.
246
1	Maybe we need to take two minutes. Let's take a
2	two-minute break.
3	A. Sure.
4	MR. DAVIS: Do you want to —
5	MR. KAISER: Is that okay?
6	MR. DAVIS: -- go off the record?
7	MR. KAISER: Yeah.
8	MR. DAVIS: Okay.
9	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record, the time is
10	3:58 p.m.
11	(Off record)
12	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the record, the time
13	is 3:59.
14	BY MR. KAISER:
15	Q. If you could refer to Slide 52, AIW_000371.
16	MR. DAVIS: Okay. We've got it.
17	BY MR. KAISER:
18	Q. And you've quoted on your slide that since
19	November 1924 the Reader's Digest has published 36
20	articles on smoking and health.
21	Where are the other hundred-and-something coming
22	from?
23	A. Well, I've reviewed articles after 1964 as well.
24	So there's another 30 years or so that come after that.
25	So Reader's Digest has continued to print articles on
247
1	that. And the period of time I was looking at, and when
2	I refer to the number you just asked about, was up until
3	the time of Mr. Ellsworth's death in 1994. So that --
4	that's where they are, so to speak.
5	Q. Did you actually do a content analysis to arrive
6	at the number of other articles in each of the Reader's
7	Digests published than just the one article on tobacco
8	and health?
9	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
10	THE WITNESS: You know, I'm sure - I don't - I
11	don't really understand your question.
12	BY MR. KAISER:
13	Q. Well, you've brought slides that show certain
14	Reader's Digests, and from those Reader's Digests is an
15	article on smoking and health. What I want to know is,
16	did you do a content analysis on each of these Reader's
17	Digests to see the number of other articles in each
18	Digest as opposed to just a single article about smoking
19	and health?
20	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
21	MR. KAISER: As I understand it, you're asking,
22	did I read all of the other articles in Reader's Digest
23	that appeared simultaneously alongside these?
24	BY MR. KAISER:
25	Q. No. I'm not asking if you read them at all.
248
1	I'm asking, did you look at the front cover and count
2	the number of articles, other than the one you've
3	identified as dealing with smoking and health, so that
4	you could tell us for that one article there were X
5	amount of other articles that didn't have anything to do
6	with smoking and health?
7	A. No, I did not. I did not count up all of the
8	articles that appeared in Reader's Digest on other
9	topics.
10	Q. And I'm talking about from each individual one,
11	so that from each individual Reader's Digest that we
12	were shown today, did you do a count for each of those
13	single Digests to be able to say in addition to the one
14	article I showed you, there were X amount of other
15	articles that had nothing to do with smoking and health?
16	A. No. I didn't count up the articles on other
17	topics.
18	Q. Have you ever done that so that you could tell
19	us from all of the Reader's Digest articles from 1926 or
20	1924 to 1964, how many total articles that didn't
21	concern themselves with smoking and health were
22	published?
23	A. No. I never counted up the total number of
24	articles on -- on other topics.
25	Q. Did you consider at any time the placement of
249
1	the tobacco and health articles in the Reader's Digest
2	publications, such as whether they were the first
3	article that appeared, a middle article, or a last
4	article?
5	A. Yes, I did, at different times. I noted when it
6	was a front page or, you know, appeared elsewhere.
7	Q. Do you have any records of those notations when
8	certain articles would be the first one, middle one, or
9	last one?
10	A. Well, I often would take a note on the Reader's
11	Digest copy. You know, I'd make a copy of an article,
12	and I'd -- I'd note it. But I don't have that handy or
13	right up here.
14	Q. Did you happen in the course of your research to
15	review any behavioral studies on how people react to
16	multiple articles in a publication like Reader's Digest;
17	in other words, whether they're directed or they'll look
18	to the first article, whether they'll look to the last
19	article, or whether they'll look right into the middle;
20	how people behave?
21	A. No. That wasn't the subject of my research, so
22	according to the protocol of the historical method, I --
23	I wouldn't be looking at things that didn't pertain.
24	Q. And with respect to the articles that you --
25	that you showed us beginning in the 1920s, what was the
250
1	medical evidence linking smoking to disease at that
2	time?
3	A. That's outside the subject of my testimony.
4	Q. With respect to the articles you've showed us
5	from the '30s that dealt with smoking and health, what
6	was the medical evidence linking smoking to disease at
7	that time?
8	A. I'm not a medical expert. I really can't
9	testify to what doctors were doing at that time.
10	Q. Did you not research that issue?
11	A. No, I --1 --1 did not research that issue. It
12	wasn't -- wasn't the subject of my -- of my research at
13	all.
14	Q. With respect to the articles that you showed us
15	from the '40s, the Reader's Digest, what was the medical
16	evidence linking smoking to disease at that time?
17	A. Again, I didn't research that. I was
18	researching merely what the public was being shown and
19	being presented with. I wasn't trying to verify that
20	information or -- or link it up to other studies that
21	the public may never have seen.
22	Q. With respect to the articles shown from the
23	'20s, '30s, and '40s, what was the medical evidence
24	suggesting that nicotine was addictive, beginning in the
25	'20s?
1	A. I don't know.
2	Q. What was the medical evidence suggesting that
3	nicotine was addictive in the'30s?
4	A. Well, what the things like the schoolbooks were
5	saying was that it was habit-form—
6	Q. The medical evidence.
7	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: It seems to me what the schools
9	were presenting was the medical evidence. So I don't
10	know what else you mean by "medical evidence."
11	BY MR. KAISER:
12	Q. With respect to the Reader's Digest articles
13	from the '40s, what was the medical evidence suggesting
14	that nicotine was addictive?
15	A. What the -- the doctors -- for example, Reader's
16	Digest often would have articles by doctors, who their
17	articles seemed to me a form of medical evidence, but I
18	can't answer that in a broader way.
19	Q. The articles that you showed in Readers Digest
20	from the '20s, what was the definition of "addiction" at
21	the time, in the'20s?
22	A. I think that that's too broad a question for me
23	to answer. It would --
24	Q. What was the medical definition of "addiction"
25	at the time in the 1930s, when you were showing us
1	Reader's Digest articles?
2	A. Well, it would be, I suppose, defined
3	differently by different doctors. But I can't testify
4	to that.
5	Q. What was the definition of "addiction" in the
6	'40s, when you were showing us Reader's Digests during
7	that time?
8	A. I don't --1 don't know which definition, which
9	doctor. I'm not sure there was a single definition.
10	What I'm just testifying to is something very different.
11	Q. And in the '50s, when you showed us articles in
12	Reader's Digest, what was the definition of "addiction"
13	at that time?
14	A. I don't know what you mean by "definition,"
15	honestly. In a medical dictionary, how it was being
16	used was to mean something that was very hard to -- to
17	give up once you started. And that was the definition
18	that was being put forward in schoolbooks and in the
19	Readers Digest and things like that. Now, sometimes
20	those -- they were quoting public health officials, so I
21	assume that's a kind of medical definition, but I'm not
22	sure if that's what you mean.
23	Q. When Reader's Digest was published and still
24	published, it was available in doctors' offices for
25	patients to read. Correct?
1	A. Very commonly, yes.
2	Q. While they were waiting in the waiting room.
3	Correct?
4	A. Yes. Doctors often subscribed to it.
5	Q. During '20s and the '30s and the '40s and the
6	'50s, patients, while reading Reader's Digest, were free
7	to smoke waiting for their doctor, weren't they?
8	A. I don't know. I suppose it would depend on the
9	doctor's office. But again, that's nothing I've done
10	research on, so I can't answer that question.
11	Q. Doctors were free to smoke in their offices
12	during this time period, weren't they?
13	A. I suppose so. There weren't public bans yet
14	on -- on smoking in public places. That did come later,
15	as I showed in the testimony.
16	Q. And then you mentioned that Reader's Digest I
17	believe you said was the largest subscribed magazine?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. How -- what was the percentage of households at
20	any one time that subscribed to Reader's Digest?
21	A. I just don't know that percentage. I'd have to
22	go look that up. It was -- it was the largest, and it
23	had a readership of, by the early '50s, about 30 million
24	people, as I testified. But I just don't know what
25	percentage that was of the population at that moment.
1	Q. Now, you had testified -- testified earlier that
2	the Reader's Digest was authorized for use in schools in
3	Providence. Is that your testimony?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Authorized. It was not mandated to be used in
6	any school in Providence, was it?
7	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
8	THE WITNESS: No. It was -- they -- the wording
9	in the school board minutes was "authorized."
10	BY MR. KAISER:
11	Q. And it was not -- it was not required as a
12	matter of law that it be used in schools in Providence,
13	was it?
14	A. No. The schools were merely required by law to
15	teach about the health hazards, but there wasn't any law
16	mandating a particular newspaper, or magazine in this
17	case.
18	Q. Do you have any evidence that a Reader's Digest
19	was ever used in school that David Ellsworth attended?
20	A. No. There's -- there's no way of knowing at
21	this point in history, these many years later, whether
22	the particular school had it or not. We simply know
23	that it was -- wasn't a big town and that the school
24	board authorized today.
25	Q. Correct. So you don't know whether or not it
255
1	was used in any of the schools that David Ellsworth
2	attended. Is that correct?
3	A. Yes. It's not possible to know.
4	Q. You have no evidence that David Ellsworth ever
5	saw a Reader's Digest while in school. Correct?
6	A. No.
7	Q. So you cannot say that it is more likely than
8	not that David Ellsworth ever saw a Reader's Digest
9	while he attended school, can you?
10	A. I have no basis for making that claim. All I
11	can claim is that this was one of the magazines that the
12	school board wanted children like David Ellsworth to
13	see. But I can't --1 would not --
14	Q. The answer to my question is, no, you cannot?
15	A. That's right. I cannot.
16	Q. And you mentioned and showed us a slide, King
17	James Counterblaste, a Counterblaste to Tobacco, from
18	1604. Correct?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Do you know, as you've researched these
21	Counterblastes to Tobacco, when King James's attitude
22	changed about tobacco?
23	A. I'm unaware that it did.
24	Q. Do you know that he became the largest importer
25	of tobacco from Jamestown?
256
1	A. I'm certainly aware that Jamestown exported
2	tobacco during King James's reign. They put a heavy tax
3	on it, though. It's -- it was as it is today, a product
4	that was legal in the -- in this case in Britain, but
5	they put a heavy tax on it to discourage it and -- and
6	didn't want people to use it. But, yes, you're right.
7	They were importing it at the same time.
8	Q. My question is, in your research did you become
9	aware that King James was the largest importer of
10	tobacco from Jamestown?
11	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
12	THE WITNESS: No, I'm not aware that he happened
13	to be the largest importer.
14	BY MR. KAISER:
15	Q. And by the, the Counterblaste to Tobacco doesn't
16	attribute the authorship to King James, does it?
17	A. When I read it, it seemed to do so, yes.
18	Q. How did it do it?
19	A. Gosh. Again, I'd have to have the document in
20	front of me to see it. I read it in Chicago, at The
21	Newberry Library. It just --1 think it said "King
22	James Counterblaste." But I'd have to see it, have a
23	physical copy in front of me to tell.
24	Q. The slide that you showed today, No. 4, does
25	that appear to be the cover page to the book, "A
257
1	Counterblaste to Tobacco"?
2	A. I'm sorry. I think they're going to get the
3	slide up again so I can see it again. Could you hang on
4	just one moment, sir?
5	Q. Sure.
6	A. Thank you.
7	Yeah. Thank you. I'm seeing it now.
8	Yeah, this looks like the frontest piece to one
9	of the versions of it. And, of course, there were --
10	it's been printed and reprinted many times. So, yeah,
11	that's -- that looks like the front page there.
12	Q. But the version you chose for your slide that
13	you created does not have any attribution to a King
14	James on the cover page to, "A Counterblaste to
15	Tobacco," does it?
16	A. No. His name is not there on the front page,
17	but it's very well historically established that this
18	was by King James.
19	Q. Can you establish by identifying any history
20	textbooks used in any schools that David Ellsworth
21	attended where King James's Counterblaste can be found?
22	A. I don't -- I've seen it in some textbooks. I
23	don't think it was, however, in those particular
24	textbooks. I've seen it a lot throughout the state of
25	Florida, lots of popular magazines. But I --1 don't
258
1	think it was in those textbooks. It often isn't.
2	Q. So the answer to my question was "no." Correct?
3	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: No. I was - I don't recall it
5	being in those textbooks.
6	BY THE WITNESS:
7	Q. Do you know whether David Ellsworth was ever
8	exposed to information about King James' Counterblaste
9	in his lifetime?
10	A. No. But, of course, keep in mind that this was
11	presented to show the long history of this, not to
12	assert that David Ellsworth would have seen it. So I
13	don't think he--
14	Q. Do you agree that sometimes history is
15	forgotten, isn't it?
16	MR. DAVIS: Sir, could you repeat your question?
17	BY MR. KAISER:
18	Q. Do you agree that sometimes history is
19	forgotten?
20	A. Well, yes. People forget things.
21	Q. People forget history, don't they?
22	A. They forget history. They forget what they had
23	for lunch. Yeah, they forget.
24	Q. One of your roles as an historian is to make
25	sure that people don't forget history. Correct?
259
1	A. Well, that's the goal of every historian is
2	to -- is to bring the past to light.
3	Q. And my question is, was the past brought to
4	light so that you can say David Ellsworth would have
5	been exposed to King James's Counterblaste at any time
6	in his life?
7	A. I just don't know. It's not possible to know if
8	he was exposed to that particular saying. It was
9	reprinted many places, but there's no reason to think
10	that he saw it or that he didn't see it.
11	Q. Do you have any reason to believe that David
12	Ellsworth was exposed to Benjamin Rush's quotation?
13	A. I wouldn't think so, but I have no reason to
14	think he was.
15	Q. Do you have any reason to believe that David
16	Ellsworth was exposed to the letter that John Quincy
17	Adams wrote his pastor?
18	A. No.
19	Q. You testified about various laws that were in
20	effect involving smoking and the illegality of
21	possessing or manufacturing tobacco. Correct?
22	A. Yes, that's correct.
23	Q. On your Slide 7, if you can refer to it?
24	A. Sure.
25	Q. And there were -- it indicates that there was 16
260
1	states that passed laws?
2	A. That's correct.
3	Q. And these are laws passed to somehow ban either
4	the possession or sale of tobacco at a certain time?
5	A. Yes, that's correct.
6	Q. You did not include Rhode Island in any of those
7	16 states that passed those laws, did you?
8	A. No. Rhode Island wasn't one of them. They had
9	other laws related to tobacco, as we saw. But they
10	never attempted to prohibit cigarettes altogether.
11	Q. And if we could look at Slide 9,1 believe.
12	Actually, Slide 8, that's the Rhode Island sales to
13	minors law that you referred to earlier in your
14	testimony. Do you have that?
15	A. Yeah. They're going to back it up and get it.
16	Thank you.
17	Now we have it.
18	Q. No person under 16 years of age shall smoke or
19	chew in any public street, place, or resort any tobacco
20	in any form whatsoever. Any suck person violating the
21	provisions of this section shall be fined not more than
22	$5 for each offense.
23	Did you do research to see how and if that law
24	was ever enforced?
25	A. No. I didn't look at police records, which
261
I	would be how you would -- if you wanted to see --
2	examine its enforcement, I think that's where you would
3	have to go. And I did not do that.
4	Q. Did you examine the legislative history of that
5	particular law?
6	A. Yes, I did look at the legislative history,
7	meaning the -- the statutes. I wanted to see how many
8	times it had been reiterated. And, of course, we also
9	do know from deposition testimony that -- that his older
10	brother was aware that -- of this law. So in that
II	sense, in terms of its enforcement, it doesn't tell us a
12	lot about enforcement, but it tells us something about
13	people being aware that they could get in trouble if
14	they did not follow the law.
15	Q. In any of my question that I just asked you, did
16	I ask you whether or not David Ellsworth's brother was
17	aware of this law?
18	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: No, you didn't ask me. You asked
20	me about enforcement.
21	BY MR. KAISER:
22	Q. And does enforcement of the law have anything to
23	do with whether or not David Ellsworth's brother was
24	aware of it?
25	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
262
1	THE WITNESS: Well, I - I think it does.
2	BY THE WITNESS:
3	Q. And then you said that it was the law in the
4	Rhode Island education law and curriculum guide that the
5	schools had to teach about tobacco and health. Correct?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. And you cited the law in a slide, No. 9, "The
8	curriculum shall emphasize physiology and hygiene with
9	special reference to the effects of alcohol, liquors,
10	stimulants, and narcotics upon the human system."
11	Correct?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. Nowhere in that -- in that phrase do they talk
14	about nicotine, do they?
15	A. No. But that's because they did consider
16	nicotine a narcotic and tobacco a narcotic. So that's a
17	historical context.
18	Q. Where does it say in this particular Rhode
19	Island law that nicotine is a narcotic?
20	A. It doesn't say it in the law. It's said it
21	around the law, and it's said in the legislative history
22	of it, but it's not said in that phrase.
23	Q. What particularly did the legislative history
24	say?
25	A. Well, what I saw were the -- the temperance --
263
1	the background to that law, how the law got passed, was
2	that there was what was called a temperance movement.
3	And the temperance and scientific physiology movement,
4	as they called it, put out a lot of pamphlets describing
5	the -- the legis— pardon me -- the -- the laws that
6	they wanted legislatures to pass. So that was
7	throughout the 1880s. And -- and there were many, many
8	states that passed these laws at the very same time,
9	with almost identical wording. And so by that history,
10	what I'm talking about are the -- is the organizing
11	effort and the pamphlets around this that -- that
12	describe it, that help me understand what they -- what
13	they meant. That's -- that's why historical context is
14	so important, because otherwise, you can't know.
15	Q. My question to you is, would any teacher have
16	known, by the law that you're showing us in Slide 9,
17	that nicotine is a narcotic?
18	A. I believe they would have known it, yes. They
19	would have been privy to the context.
20	Q. Tell me how they would have known it.
21	A. Well, because they were alive. They were --
22	they were in that context. They were hearing it —
23	tobacco described as a narcotic, as it was repeatedly,
24	in schoolbooks and physiology and hygiene books. So
25	I -- I'm certain -- I'm absolutely certain that they
264
1	would have understood, not from this particular short
2	phrase, but from the whole context, that -- that tobacco
3	was considered a narcotic at that time.
4	Q. Take a look at Slide 10.
5	Do you have Slide 10?
6	A. Yes, we do.
7	Q. From your quote, apparently from the textbook
8	that appears on that particular slide, is there anything
9	that suggests that nicotine is a narcotic?
10	A. They don't use the word "narcotic" here, so no.
11	Q. Is there any way for us to tell how many pages
12	were in that textbook from which you took that quote?
13	A. No. You'd have to go to the textbook to see.
14	I --1 -- I'm recalling four or five pages possibly, but
15	I --1 just don't recall offhand. I'd have to get the
16	textbook myself.
17	Q. Is there any way we could tell what was in the
18	particular chapter from which you quoted with these
19	quotes that appear on Slide 10?
20	A. Well, it's like all of the materials that
21	I've -- for which I've taken out individual quotes.
22	You'd have to read the whole article or the whole book
23	to -- to tell everything that's in it.
24	Q. So that we really don't have the proper context
25	for this textbook, do we?
265
1	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
2	THE WITNESS: Oh, I would disagree with that.
3	All health textbooks were pretty standard. They all had
4	sections on tobacco and alcohol and what they said, as
5	they put it, other narcotics. So that context is -- to
6	me is very clear.
7	BY MR. KAISER:
8	Q. So that we would not have to read the whole
9	chapter, the whole book, to understand what you're
10	quoting in this particular slide. Is that correct?
11	A. Right. You would not.
12	Q. We -- we would not need to finish reading this
13	particular chapter to understand the import of this
14	particular quote. Correct?
15	A. I think the quote stands on -- on its own.
16	There is additional information in the chapter, but the
17	quotes is clear.
18	Q. If you could look at the Slide 11, please.
19	A. Sure.
20	Q. Is that in front of you?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Is there any indication from this particular
23	slide that nicotine was referred to as a drug, as a --
24	as a narcotic drug?
25	A. No. The -- the drug -- the world "drug" and
266
1	"narcotic" is -- is not used in these phrases. It's
2	used sometimes, and it's not used other times. The
3	drug, I think, is implied in this one where it says,
4	"Once the person has the smoking habit, he often finds
5	it very hard to break the--break the habit." So the
6	idea is, as is built into most of these books, that
7	there is a druglike effect -- a drug effect, I should
8	say, of the nicotine.
9	Q. Do you know whether or not there are any other
10	references to tobacco in this Safety Every Day book?
11	A. Yes. There are other references. These are not
12	the only quotes. These are just representative ones
13	that discuss the harms.
14	Q. And how many other quotes talk about nicotine
15	being a narcotic?
16	A. You know, I --1 -- I'm not sure how many in
17	that -- in that book do. Every book is a little bit
18	different. And some emphasize drugs. Some mention
19	narcotics. Some use the words like "habit forming," as
20	this one did. So I can't count up the number of quotes
21	that would be possible.
22	Q. On Slide No. 12, if you could refer to that,
23	please.
24	A. Sure.
25	Q. Have it?
267
1	A. Yes, we do.
2	Q. On the quote on that slide, is there any
3	indication that nicotine is referred to as a narcotic?
4	A. No. Here they're calling it a poison, so --
5	which, of course, they -- they often talked about
6	narcotics as poison. So it just--they did not always
7	use that word. You have to understand that word was the
8	generic word. So a narcotic would include -- they would
9	call alcohol a narcotic as well. So they didn't always
10	call alcohol a narcotic. They didn't always call
11	nicotine a narcotic. But they -- it was a term that
12	they sometimes used. Here it's simply the emphasis is
13	on the poisonous aspect of nicotine.
14	Q. And where is your information that suggested
15	alcohol is called a narcotic?
16	A. Well, because often in the laws -- again, I
17	don't have it right in front of me -- they'll say
18	"alcohol, tobacco, and other narcotics" is a phrase that
19	comes up repeatedly in this kind of literature.
20	Q. That's on Slide 13 you read from. And we don't
21	know what the words were next to "drugs," because
22	there's three little periods after that, ellipses. So
23	we don't know what was said, do we?
24	A. You know, I'm sorry. I'm looking at Slide 13.
25	Would you like me to look at that? Because I'm looking
268
1	at -- still at 12.
2	Q. Just want you to look at 12, 13, 14, and 15 --
3	A. Sure.
4	Q. -- and 16 --
5	A. Sure.
6	Q. — and tell me where there's one reference to
7	nicotine being a narcotic.
8	A. Well, the top line of 13, it says, "Alcohol,
9	tobacco, and other narcotic drugs."
10	Q. Right.
11	A. So that's -- that's the kind of phrase that
12	was -- that was common. It wasn't always used. Not
13	every textbook used it. And sometimes the legislation
14	spoke that way, and sometimes it was slightly different.
15	But so there's -- there's an example.
16	Q. What's an example, other than they're saying
17	"alcohol, tobacco, and other narcotic drugs"?
18	A. Well, the word "other" in this sentence means
19	that tobacco and alcohol are a form of narcotic drugs,
20	and there are other ones too. They might mention opium.
21	Sometimes in that period of time, they would call
22	marijuana a narcotic too. So it's -- it was just
23	different.
24	That's what history does is it tells us the
25	context. In this particular context they did what we
269
1	don't do today, which is to call tobacco and alcohol and
2	even marijuana narcotics. So I think --
3	Q. Who determined whether or not --
4	A. -- that sentence is very clear to me.
5	Q. — nicotine was a narcotic?
6	A. I'm sorry. What?
7	Q. Who determined whether nicotine was a narcotic?
8	A. Well, this is not a matter of somebody making a
9	determination. This is simply schools repeating a
10	phrase that was in common use.
11	Q. Did you ever identify an actual textbook that
12	David Ellsworth used, at any time while he was in
13	school, that talked about tobacco and health?
14	A. No. I --1 don't have a book that has his name
15	written in it or a teacher's logbook assigning him a
16	book. It -- that's just not the kind of records that
17	are kept by schools. So I don't have that.
18	Q. Do you have any way of knowing whether or not
19	anything at all was taught about tobacco and health
20	while -- while David Ellsworth was at school?
21	A. Well, his older brother by three years said he
22	learned it in school. So as to whether David himself
23	learned it in school, I don't know. What I can say he
24	that he was exposed to this information. He was suppose
25	to learn it in school. The schools, by law, were
1	supposed to teach it, and these were the books that were
2	provided. But I --1 certainly can't put it into his
3	individual hands.
4	Q. And it's true you have no idea whatsoever
5	whether he was exposed to it, do you?
6	A. I --1 don't think --1 wouldn't agree with that
7	characterization.
8	Q. So you believe that by textbooks or otherwise,
9	he was exposed to it in school. Is that what you're
10	saying?
11	A. Yes. I think that that's a very reasonable
12	conclusion.
13	Q. And yet you base that on absolutely no evidence.
14	Correct?
15	A. That-
16	MR. DAVIS: Objection to form.
17	THE WITNESS: That's not true. I have plenty of
18	evidence.
19	BY MR. KAISER:
20	Q. Well, tell me what textbook David Ellsworth used
21	in school that talked of smoking and health, please.
22	A. I think you're making a kind of distinction that
23	I wouldn't, and I don't think any other historian would.
24	To say that I don't have a photograph or a log that
25	somebody got a particular book not to say that they
Ill
1	weren't exposed to information, especially in a
2	situation where in Providence we know the specific books
3	that the -- that the teachers were supposed to use. We
4	do know that he went to all of these grades. We know
5	his brother learned this information in school. Both
6	brothers, in fact, said they new this information very
7	early. So that's a logical deduction. That's a fair
8	historical conclusion, I believe, in my professional
9	judgment.
10	Q. And what you're saying is that at one point one
11	of David's brothers, Richard, said that in a health
12	class he learned smoking was bad. Correct?
13	A. Yes. That was his deposition testimony.
14	Q. And that was at a time that he was going to a
15	school where students were allowed to smoke on school
16	grounds before school and after school. Correct?
17	A. As I recall the deposition, and -- and maybe
18	should get it out so I can see this, but I -- as I
19	understood it, they weren't allowed to smoke on school
20	grounds. They -- but they did smoke outside around the
21	school, off -- off the school grounds. It's -- that's
22	how I recall the deposition, because that weren't
23	allowed to smoke in school, because as he put it, the --
24	the school was teaching them that was bad for them.
25	But -- but students would -- would do it.
1	Q. And, of course, you have no way of knowing if
2	any teachers that were charged with teaching about
3	smoking were smokers themselves, do you?
4	A. No. They may have been smokers. You know, some
5	adults did smoke.
6	Q. You have no idea what these teachers, if they
7	smoked, thought about smoking at the time, do you?
8	A. I don't know what they individually thought, but
9	I do know the lessons that they were charged by law with
10	teaching, which was to teach that it was harmful.
11	Q. You have no of knowing whether or not teachers
12	smoked in a teachers lounge at school, do you?
13	A. No. I --1 don't have any -- there are no
14	records that I'm aware of about there being teachers
15	lounges in which they could smoke. They may have, and
16	they may not have.
17	Q. But (inaudible) have no way of knowing that if a
18	teacher did teach his or her students about tobacco and
19	health, what the teacher actually taught, do you?
20	A. Well, I think that if the teacher was teaching
21	the curriculum, which they were supposed to do, and
22	teaching from the textbooks they were supposed to be
23	using, I think that the lessons they were giving were
24	very clear. Again, we don't have a tape recording of a
25	classroom, but -- but we have a lot of evidence about --
273
1	about the harms that they were supposed to be alerting
2	students to, and apparently did, at least according to
3	the deposition testimony.
4	Q. Well, you have deposition of one brother. You
5	did not have any testimony of David Ellsworth or anybody
6	else saying that he was taught in school, do you?
7	A. No, we don't have depositions from David
8	Ellsworth.
9	Q. And so you have no idea, regardless of whether
10	or not tobacco and health was mentioned in a textbook,
11	if a teacher actually taught from the textbook, do you?
12	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: I - I think it's - would be
14	incredibly unlikely for the teachers every year to have
15	a textbook that says one thing and to never assign it or
16	talk about it. So I just think that it's a very
17	reasonable and historical conclusion to come to that
18	they used the textbook and they taught the lessons that
19	were in it, especially since it was their legal
20	obligation --
21	BY MR. KAISER:
22	Q. (Inaudible) ever seen David Ellsworth's school
23	records to see whether or not he even took a health
24	class in school, have you?
25	A. The health classes were not offered as separate
274
1	classes. But we do not, unfortunately, have a -- we do
2	not have necessarily school records for Mr. Ellsworth.
3	The schools didn't keep them that long. So what we have
4	are the -- as I mentioned, what we have are the school
5	board meetings.
6	Q. Did not Richard Ellsworth say that it was in
7	health class where he was told by a health teacher that
8	smoking was bad?
9	A. Yes. But keep in mind that where that --
10	Q. (Inaudible) --
11	MR. DAVIS: Wait. Wait.
12	BY MR. KAISER:
13	Q. — separate class. Is that what you said?
14	MR. DAVIS: Allan, she's not finished.
15	Go ahead. Finish with your answer.
16	THE WITNESS: Keep in mind that we're talking
17	about two different levels of school. So it was taught
18	in elementary school, which is -- things were offered a
19	little bit differently than they are in the seventh and
20	eighth and ninth grade. And Mr. Ellsworth, Richard
21	Ellsworth, the older brother, had said that he
22	remembered it from a health class in junior high.
23	By the times kids got to junior high, the
24	classes were more divvied out, so to speak. You would
25	go to a separate class. In elementary school those
275
1	classes -- subjects are usually taught by the same
2	teacher. So it wouldn't be a separate class, if you --
3	if you follow me.
4	BY MR. KAISER:
5	Q. Did David -- did Richard Ellsworth ever say that
6	he was taught about smoking being bad while he was in
7	element school?
8	A. No. He only recalled his junior high school
9	experience.
10	Q. Never recalled anything about high school, did
11	he?
12	A. No, he didn't.
13	Q. No one else testified about what was taught in
14	elementary school, the one that David Ellsworth went to.
15	Correct?
16	A. No. There were only two brothers, of course now
17	much older, who were there. So they were the ones that
18	we have deposition testimony for.
19	Q. You've never seen David Ellsworth's attendance
20	records to see how much school he missed, did you?
21	A. No. Rhode Island does not keep those school
22	records. But we know he --
23	Q. You've never seen any testimony about whether or
24	not he missed school, did you?
25	A. No, but we do know he graduated. So presumably
276
1	he attended enough school to -- to make the graduation.
2	So he completed the -- the course of study.
3	Q. You way -- you have no way of knowing if David
4	Ellsworth was even at school at a time when and if his
5	teacher would have mentioned anything about tobacco and
6	health, do you?
7	A. I don't know what days he was there and what
8	days he wasn't throughout the ten- or 12-year period --
9	pardon me -- eight-year period that he was in school.
10	Q. Now, you've talked about church. And you had
11	mentioned that David Ellsworth was an active member of
12	the church. Would you identify any witness who ever
13	testified that David Ellsworth was an active member of
14	his church.
15	A. Yes. His brother -- it was Richard, his brother
16	Richard, who said that they went regularly as children.
17	I --1 classify that as an active member of the church,
18	to be in a regular attendance.
19	And then it was his stepson Rickey Maheu who
20	said that they went regularly when he was a boy. And as
21	he put it, although again I don't have the exact wording
22	in front of me, he said that his father -- stepfather
23	was baptized, but he was not. So it -- it seems to me
24	that's another indication of being an -- an active
25	member.
277
1	Q. Was there any evidence from any witness in this
2	particular case whose testimony you reviewed that said
3	that David Ellsworth ever heard a word about smoking and
4	health while in church?
5	A. No.
6	Q. Do you have any evidence whatsoever that David
7	Ellsworth ever saw any of the Baptist literature you
8	displayed on Slide 21 today?
9	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
10	THE WITNESS: No, nor was I trying to show that.
11	I wasn't testifying to that. I was testifying to the
12	message that Baptists were giving about the hazards of
13	smoking. So I wasn't trying to put those into his
14	hands. This is --
15	BY MR. KAISER:
16	Q. (Inaudible) have no idea if that message that
17	they were trying to give people who went to church was
18	ever given to David Ellsworth at any time he might have
19	gone to church in Providence Rhode Island. Correct?
20	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
21	THE WITNESS: Well, I - again, I think - I
22	believe it was his son who said he never smoked in
23	church, which would be an indication that he understood
24	he wasn't supposed to. So that's one way of -- of
25	gauging whether or not someone got the message. But --
278
1	BY MR. KAISER:
2	Q. Soby-
3	A. -- other than that, I --1 don't --1 don't
4	know.
5	Q. By refraining for a one-hour period of time and
6	not smoking, that suggests to you that somehow David
7	Ellsworth knew smoking was bad?
8	A. Well, yes, in the sense that, for example, if he
9	didn't smoke around his grandchildren, which he didn't,
10	and that might have been for an hour at a time. Or he
11	didn't smoke when his daughter was in the hospital.
12	That might have just been for an hour at a time. And he
13	didn't smoke in church. So that indicates to me that he
14	understood that -- that these bans had a reason, that
15	you weren't supposed to, because it wasn't a good
16	activity, a healthy activity.
17	Q. And you know that, and you know that that's
18	exactly what David Ellsworth thinks. Is that what
19	you're saying?
20	A. No, not at all. What I'm saying is when a --
21	what a historian does is we look at behavior and
22	statements, polls, textbooks, all of these things to --
23	to gauge the picture of -- of knowledge and common
24	awareness and opinion. That's a very different thing
25	from saying, I know exactly what's in a particular
279
1	person's head at a particular time. That, I cannot do.
2	But as a historian I think I can weigh expertly on
3	the -- the climate of information and awareness that did
4	exist and to which Mr. --of which Mr. Ellsworth would
5	have been a part.
6	Q. Was there any testimony that you read in this
7	particular case that indicated that David Ellsworth
8	heard one sermon that talked about smoking and health?
9	A. No. His -- his brother did not recall
10	particular sermons on that topic.
11	Q. In fact, it was his brother who said that they
12	were not smokers when they went to church, because they
13	were kids at the time. Correct?
14	A. Yes. I think it was --1 think it was that
15	brother who said that the parents were not smokers.
16	either. They didn't smoke or drink, like many Baptists.
17	So I don't remember that particular line from the --
18	from the testimony, but that makes sense.
19	Q. You talked about slang terms, and I'll be brief
20	on this one. But is there any evidence that David
21	Ellsworth ever used slang terms for cigarettes?
22	A. There's -- the only testimony we have in the
23	depositions is that his stepson used them in his
24	stepfather's presence and -- and commonly referred to
25	them as coffin nails or cancer sticks. But there's no
280
1	testimony that -- either that David Ellsworth used those
2	terms or that he questioned them; he didn't understand
3	them. So --
4	Q. And you mentioned that his son commonly referred
5	to these. Is that the deposition testimony that you
6	recall, that his son suggested that, more than once,
7	saying anything about slang terms?
8	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
9	THE WITNESS: Again, I - I don't have the
10	deposition right in front of me, but my impression was
11	that it was a term that he used and had used on repeated
12	occasions. But there was no attempt in the deposition,
13	I don't think, to quantify that, that I recall.
14	BY MR. KAISER:
15	Q. (Inaudible) your recollection of the deposition
16	testimony that Mr. Maheu had a very good recollection of
17	when and if he ever said anything about slang terms to
18	his father?
19	A. You know, I just don't recall them in great
20	enough specificity to comment. So it would be -- you
21	know, it would be helpful. If you would like, we could
22	perhaps get the deposition.
23	Q. Is your recollection that Mr. Maheu testified
24	that on common occasions, several occasions he would use
25	slang in front of his father?
281
1	A. I just remember him saying that he did use that
2	slang in front of his father. I just don't recall the
3	specific wording.
4	Q. Now, you had -- you've shown us many newspaper
5	articles throughout your testimony today. Do you
6	consider newspapers to be a reliable source of
7	information, including information on smoking and
8	health?
9	A. It's interesting to use the word "reliable."
10	What I consider them is a source of extensive
11	information on smoking and health. I know that their
12	attempt was to be as objective as possible and
13	certainly, you know, as reliable as the mass media
14	generally is.
15	Q. Okay. So my question is, do you consider them
16	reliable? After all, are you not relying on these
17	newspapers, among other publications, to demonstrate the
18	public awareness of the dangers of smoking?
19	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: I think that that might be asking
21	a couple of different things in that question. I
22	certainly consider them a source of information and --
23	BY MR. KAISER:
24	Q. Okay. Well, let me break it down. Are you
25	relying on newspapers in any way in your opinions that
282
1	you've offered today?
2	A. Yes. I'm -- I'm relying on them as a source of
3	information to citizens about the health hazards of
4	smoking.
5	Q. And what I'd like to know is, if you're relying
6	on the source, do you find the information in the source
7	on which you're relying to be reliable information?
8	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
9	THE WITNESS: You know, I think sometimes it was
10	more reliable than other times. You know, sometimes a
11	newspaper article wouldn't remember something that
12	happened ten years earlier and -- but I think that
13	generally they were reliable. And, you know, most of
14	the time the articles seemed to me pretty solid. But I
15	wasn't trying to analyze them, for example, for such
16	things as medical accuracy or such things. What I was
17	just looking at them for was, what was the message that
18	they were giving to people like Mr. Ellsworth?
19	BY MR. KAISER:
20	Q. Well, you would hope that the information that
21	they were giving people like Mr. Ellsworth would be
22	reliable and true. Correct?
23	A. Yes, I would hope that it was. And I think in
24	general it was.
25	Q. Now, in any of the articles that you showed us
283
1	for the Miami Herald, did you ever do a content analysis
2	and figure out exactly how many articles appeared in any
3	given newspaper where one particular article on smoking
4	and health also appeared?
5	A. No. I never -- there are, of course, many ways
6	to use the term "content analysis." But what I think
7	you're asking is, did I count up the total number of
8	articles in the newspaper in order to get a sense of
9	what the percentage of articles was that concerned
10	smoking, vis-a-vis all of the other articles. And I
11	never did that.
12	Q. In other words, yeah, I'm trying to find out if
13	David Ellsworth had a choice of hundreds of other
14	articles, other than one particular article on smoking
15	and health, in a newspaper he may have read.
16	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
17	THE WITNESS: There would be many articles in
18	any newspaper. It would depend, for example, if an --
19	if an article is above what they call the fold -- the
20	newspapers would come folded on your doorstep. And if
21	the newspaper on your doorstep, the top article said,
22	That's it; cigarettes are bad for you, I think that it's
23	very logical the person would have seen that article
24	before they saw other articles when they unfolded the
25	newspaper. So I think sometimes a person could have
284
1	easily missed the article. I think many times it would
2	have been extraordinary difficult, if not impossible, to
3	miss the article.
4	As I was trying to give you a sense for the
5	DeLand newspaper, it was a very small paper, 24 pages,
6	which means 12 sheets, you know, either side -- it was a
7	very small paper. And if you have seven articles in
8	there, as a percentage it would be a very high
9	percentage. But in any newspaper, you know, you might
10	read some things, and you might not read other things.
11	BY MR. KAISER:
12	Q. On the slides that you showed us today, is there
13	any way that we can tell from those slides where in the
14	newspapers those various articles appeared, like on the
15	first page or the last page?
16	A. Well, sometimes you can and sometimes you can't
17	because we just don't have space on the slide to show
18	you the whole page. Sometimes they appeared on page 12,
19	and sometimes they were appearing on page 1. It depends
20	on the section too. If an article was a health article
21	or Dear Abby, I don't think that ever appeared on page
22	1. I've never seen it on page 1. That would always be
23	in a section that was like family or a community
24	section. So it would depend on the type of article.
25	News -- news -- the big articles were often on the front
285
1	page. And sometimes you can see that but not always.
2	Q. Do you have any evidence that David Ellsworth
3	read a single article in any newspaper about tobacco and
4	health?
5	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
6	THE WITNESS: I have no more evidence than that
7	his children said that he read the newspaper every day.
8	That's what they said. We know he was an avid -- and he
9	subscribed. Did he not actually read it? Did he not
10	actually subscribe? I suppose that's possible. It
11	doesn't seem likely at all. But, you know, that's the
12	evidence that we do have.
13	BY MR. KAISER:
14	Q. Which of David Ellsworth's children testified
15	that he read the newspaper every day?
16	A. Oh, let's see. I think Carole Maheu said it was
17	on the table. Of course, there it's on the table, so
18	maybe it was on the table and never read. But I don't
19	think that's likely. I think it --1 can't remember.
20	One of them said that he would read the paper with a cup
21	of coffee and a cigarette. But I --1 don't remember
22	which -- which person that was, one of the children.
23	Q. Well, you testified that his children said he
24	read the paper every day, did you not?
25	A. I --1 said it as clearly as I could. It's
286
1	possible I misspoke. As I understood it, they gave me
2	the impression from them, from the depositions, that it
3	was a daily habit.
4	Q. Can you tell me which child ever testified that
5	David Ellsworth read a newspaper every day?
6	A. I would have to look at the depositions again to
7	see. I think it was --1 think it might have been
8	Rickey, but I'm not sure. Rickey Maheu.
9	Q. What was David Ellsworth's favorite part of the
10	newspaper?
11	A. I don't recall.
12	Q. Do you recall any witness of any child ever
13	saying what was David Ellsworth's favorite part of the
14	newspaper?
15	A. I don't recall that being a question. It may
16	have been, but I don't recall that.
17	Q. Is there any testimony as to what sections of
18	the paper David Ellsworth read and what sections he
19	didn't read?
20	A. I don't think that the depositions got to that
21	level of specificity. I don't recall that question
22	being asked, actually.
23	Q. You also testified about the specific --
24	Pacific Stars and Stripes. Do you have any evidence
25	that David Ellsworth read one article about smoking and
287
1	health in the Pacific Stars and Stripes?
2	A. No. All we know is that he was abroad, that he
3	was a newspaper reader, and that would have been the
4	paper made available to him. But I don't have any
5	evidence that he read it. This was the information that
6	was available. It doesn't mean that he -- he got all of
7	it.
8	Q. And simply because the information may be
9	available doesn't mean that's it's going to be seen by
10	David Ellsworth, does it?
11	A. I don't think all of it would have been seen by
12	David Ellsworth. I think much of it would have been. I
13	think there's much that wouldn't have been. Again, it's
14	to go back to this idea that there is a context, that
15	there's kind of a bombardment that's going on over a
16	period of decades about information. But I don't think
17	it's likely that any person saw it all.
18	Q. Was smoking cigarettes allowed in the military
19	in 1953?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. Was smoking cigarettes allowed in the military
22	in 1954?
23	A. Yes, I assume so, although there must have been
24	some areas you couldn't do it, like around ordnance or
25	something. But he was a supply clerk, so it's entirely
1	possible that -- that there were no places where he
2	could not smoke. But I'm just not aware.
3	Q. Was smoking cigarettes allowed in the military
4	in 1955?
5	A. Yes, under the same conditions.
6	Q. Did you see whether or not David Ellsworth saw
7	any combat when he was in the Marines?
8	A. You know, I --1 saw nothing to that effect in
9	the military record. One of his sons said that --1
10	think he said that his dad was shot six times or
11	something. But in the military regard, there's --
12	there's no -- there's no indications of, you know, the
13	kinds of decorations that -- people get for being
14	wounded in combat and that kind of thing. The records
15	simply showed that he was a supply or -- or a
16	procurement clerk. So I don't believe he saw combat,
17	but simply because it's not in the military record.
18	Q. Did you see any entries in his military records
19	where he was not eligible for combat until 1952?
20	A. I didn't see that. But -- but you -- he
21	wouldn't have been 18 until 1952. So he joined a month
22	before he turned 18. So I don't recall that comment,
23	but it -- it makes some sense. He wouldn't have been 18
24	until -- until the March after his enlistment.
25	Q. Do you recall whether or not Marines in the
1	Korean conflict were provided with free cigarettes if
2	they were in combat?
3	A. Yes. They --1 believe they would have been.
4	There were what they call combat rations. And, in fact,
5	his brother Donald testified to seeing the combat ration
6	cigarettes and ignoring them because he thought it
7	wasn't good to smoke. But if he had been in combat, I
8	think he would have been issued them.
9	Q. You mentioned magazines as a source of
10	information that would have available to the public,
11	including David Ellsworth, today. Correct?
12	A. David Ellsworth today? Not today.
13	Q. No. I was talking about your testimony today.
14	A. Oh, I'm sorry. Would you repeat the question?
15	Q. Yes. You mentioned magazines as a source of
16	information that was available to people, about the
17	health risk of smoking, today in your testimony.
18	Correct?
19	A. Yes, I did.
20	Q. And one of the magazines you talked about was
21	Life magazine. Correct?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. On the slides where you showed us Life magazine,
24	of course, you didn't show us an entire issue of a Life
25	magazine. Correct?
1	A. An entire history of Life magazine? No, I
2	didn't show --
3	Q. Entire issue.
4	A. No, I didn't show you all the pages in the
5	magazine.
6	Q. If we were shown an entire issue, invariably
7	what we would see on the last page would be a full-page
8	color cigarette ad. Correct?
9	A. I don't know --1 don't think invariably, but
10	sometimes you would. There were full-page cigarette ads
11	in some Life magazines, just as there were full-page ads
12	for a lot of products, including cigarettes.
13	Q. Would you agree that Life magazine, in almost
14	every tissue, had a cigarette ad on the back cover?
15	A. No, I don't know that it did on -- on every
16	issue. I --1 just really don't. I haven't looked at
17	all of them.
18	Q. I would like to direct your attention to your
19	trial testimony on April 10th of 2013 in the Kathleen
20	Anderson as personal representative for the estate of
21	Daniel Begley. Do you remember that case?
22	A. Yes, I do.
23	Q. Do you remember testifying in front of Judge
24	Pendino in Tampa?
25	A. I'm sorry. I don't recall the judge's name, but
291
1	I do recall the case.
2	Q. And in that particular trial, the following
3	question and answer went as follows on page 2742.
4	Question --
5	MR. DAVIS: Just -- excuse me, Mr. Kaiser. I
6	would just object, without showing the witness the
7	testimony. I don't think that's appropriate.
8	BY MR. KAISER:
9	Q. On page 2742, the question was, "In fact, I have
10	a lot of Life magazines, probably 50 or so of them here.
11	Just about every Life magazine had a cigarette ad on the
12	back cover, didn't it?"
13	"Answer: They did. They certainly did.
14	Sometimes -- sometimes on an inside cover. And there
15	were also two-page full-spread ads for other products as
16	well."
17	Do you remember that question and answer in your
18	testimony at trial on April 10th of 2013?
19	A. I --1 don't remember that specific question.
20	But you're reading it from it, so I suppose that it's
21	there. But, yes, that sounds -- that sounds like about
22	what I said today as well, so seems logical.
23	Q. Do you agree that, as well, inside the magazine,
24	the Life magazine, would be other ads for cigarettes?
25	A. Yes. They -- they did have ads for cigarettes
292
1	on occasion. It wasn't -- the ones that I've looked
2	at -- I've actually tried to analyze it a little bit.
3	And I've found that it's -- of all the ads in the
4	magazine, they range from roughly 1 percent of the total
5	number of ads up to about 5 or 6 percent of the total
6	ads. So -- so sometimes they definitely had full-page
7	ads, as they did for other products as well. And
8	sometimes it would be on the back cover, and sometimes
9	it-
10	Q. (Inaudible) that analysis for Life magazine?
11	A. Pardon?
12	Q. Did you do that analysis for Life magazine to
13	determine the percentage of cigarette advertisements
14	versus other advertisements?
15	A. I just did that for a couple of issues. I --1
16	did not do this as a survey across the board. I was
17	aware from other materials that -- that I've heard that
18	between 5 and 9 percent of advertisement in magazines in
19	that period of time was for cigarettes, which means, of
20	course, that 91 to 95 percent was for something else.
21	But in the case of a few Life magazine articles,
22	for example, like the one I showed the jury earlier, I
23	showed a Life magazine, and I was curious in the context
24	of that particular magazine how many ads were for other
25	things and how many ads were for cigarettes. So I
293
1	didn't do it overall, but I did it in the case -- on a
2	case-by-case basis.
3	And in the case of that particular one, I think
4	there were, if I'm recalling correctly, three out of 54
5	ads were for cigarettes. So I --1 -- my math was that
6	that was about 5 percent of the total number of ads in
7	that issue alone.
8	Q. Are you suggesting in any way that just because
9	there might have been more ads other than cigarettes,
10	that people that read Life magazine were not exposed to
11	cigarette advertisements?
12	A. Oh, no, no. I'm just making a point about
13	proportion and context. I'm saying as a proportion, it
14	was a -- you know, it was a relatively small proportion.
15	But certainly people would have seen the advertises that
16	were there.
17	Q. On almost any given occasion, someone could pick
18	up a Life magazine, and there would be a full-page ad in
19	the back, correct, for a cigarette company?
20	A. Again, I don't know that, that it would have
21	been on the back page.
22	Q. Did you ever do a statistical analysis that's
23	written, that we could see, where you determined the
24	percentage of ads of cigarettes versus other ads?
25	A. I have wrote -- wrote up notes for myself, kind
294
1	of, you know, how you do the, you know, dash, dash,
2	dash, and slash -- sorry, I don't know how to say this
3	to you since you're on the phone -- where you're trying
4	to count up the numbers. But, no, I haven't written
5	that up as a report or anything. I was just counting
6	them for myself because I was curious about the
7	percentage.
8	Q. Did you do any content analysis to determine how
9	many tobacco-related ads appeared in Life magazine over
10	a certain period of time?
11	A. No. I only did it on a case-by-case basis.
12	Q. Did you ever do a content analysis to see how
13	many other articles appeared along with a particular
14	tobacco ad?
15	A. So you're saying how many articles appeared in a
16	magazine in addition to -- in addition to
17	advertisements?
18	Q. No. I'm asking, how many other articles might
19	have appeared in one single issue of Life magazine that
20	contained one article on tobacco and health?
21	A. I did not add up all the other articles.
22	Q. And because there might be an article in any
23	Life magazine about cigarette and health, does that
24	necessarily mean that any reader is going to read that
25	particular article?
295
1	A. No. It -- for example, I believe in the one I
2	showed the jury, it was the centerfold article. That
3	was certainly true in some of the Life magazines. So
4	it's one of the most prominent and long articles, but
5	doesn't mean, by any means, that every reader who read
6	the magazine would have read that article. It was -- it
7	was there. It was available.
8	Q. I believe the Wynder and Graham study that
9	you're referring in the Life magazine article in 1953 is
10	found on page 21. Correct?
11	A. I don't know. I don't have the --1 just don't
12	have it in front of me. I don't recall the page number.
13	Q. Well, it's Slide No. 26. And I believe if you
14	find it, you'll see one of the page numbers is 21.
15	A. That may be true, but if we don't know the
16	entire number of pages in the -- in the magazine, we
17	don't know if 21 is in the middle or not.
18	Q. We certainly know it's not No. 1. Correct?
19	A. That's true. Right. It was --
20	Q. We certainly know there's articles that
21	appearing on 1 through 20 before we get to page 21.
22	Correct?
23	A. No, I don't think we know that, actually. In
24	fact, that would not be my experience. Usually the
25	first page would have been often an ad, and sometimes
296
1	the second page, and then there would be a page of table
2	of contents, in the magazines, that is. Newspapers were
3	set up differently.
4	Q. Do you have any evidence that David Ellsworth
5	ever saw a single Life magazine in his lifetime?
6	A. That wasn't one of the publications that -- that
7	he subscribed to. So this is a case where we know that
8	this was a widely distributed magazine and that -- that
9	the people around him would have seen this. But I have
10	no evidence that this was a magazine that he favored or
11	read.
12	Q. But my question, again, was, do you have any
13	evidence that David Ellsworth ever saw a Life magazine
14	in his lifetime? Is your answer no?
15	A. No. We have no direct evidence.
16	Q. Do you have any evidence whatsoever, direct or
17	otherwise?
18	A. I think I just answered that question. No.
19	Q. No. Your answer was, No, I don't have direct
20	evidence. Do you have any other evidence other than
21	direct evidence, ma'am?
22	MR. DAVIS: I think you're a little arguing now.
23	So I'll object to the form.
24	THE WITNESS: No, I don't have any evidence that
25	he got that magazine or read that magazine.
297
1	BY MR. KAISER:
2	Q. What, if any, evidence do you have that David
3	Ellsworth subscribed to any magazine?
4	A. I don't think he subscribed to magazines. He
5	was a newspaper subscriber.
6	Q. What, if any, evidence did you have that David
7	Ellsworth ever saw a TIME magazine in his lifetime?
8	A. Again, that --1 don't have evidence that he
9	did. It was offered to show what information was
10	available not just to him but to the general public at
11	that time.
12	Q. What, if any, evidence do you have that there
13	was ever a TIME magazine in David Ellsworth's house in
14	Miami or DeLand, Florida?
15	A. I -- no evidence -- that he subscribed to that
16	or that he purchased it.
17	Q. What, if any, evidence do you have that David
18	Ellsworth ever read a Newsweek magazine during his
19	lifetime?
20	A. Again, this goes more to the indirect evidence.
21	I guess that was a distinction I was trying to make.
22	That was something that was approved for use in the
23	school, but we don't have evidence as to him picking it
24	up or reading it. We just don't know.
25	Q. When you say it was approved for use in schools,
298
1	do you have any evidence that it was actually used in
2	schools where David Ellsworth attended?
3	A. No. That's like the question about textbooks.
4	We don't know that the textbooks were actually in the
5	classroom. There's no photographic or other evidence to
6	that effect. We simply know that they were authorized,
7	and I think it's a pretty reasonable assumption that
8	they would have been used.
9	Q. You talked about move excerpts in your testimony
10	today. Did you do a content analysis to see the number
11	of movies that actually showed actors and actresses
12	using slang terms about cigarettes?
13	A. I'm sorry I don't quite -- could you say the
14	first part of your question again? Did I --
15	Q. Yeah. I'd like to know.
16	A. Sure.
17	Q. Did you, in your research, so that we would
18	know, other than the snippets that you showed us today,
19	how many movies exist from the '30s, the '40s, the '50s,
20	the '60s where actors and actresses were using slang
21	terms for cigarettes?
22	A. I --1 can't give you a number and certainly not
23	off the top of my head. What I found is what historians
24	would find, which are occasional movies. Slang is not
25	used all of the time. It's used for effect on occasion.
299
1	So I've seen a number of movies where it was used that
2	way, whether Frank Sinatra or the Three Stooges or, you
3	know, all kinds of different people having used that
4	term. But I --1 don't have a --1 couldn't give you a
5	number.
6	Q. Do you have any idea whether David Ellsworth in
7	his lifetime saw a movie where an actor or actress used
8	a slang term to denote a cigarette?
9	A. I --1 actually don't think I have any evidence
10	that he ever saw a movie of any type whatsoever. I
11	don't remember his -- you know, this is just something
12	that wasn't asked, and I wouldn't have a way of knowing.
13	But, again, that evidence and testimony was offered not
14	to say that David Ellsworth saw this movie, but to say
15	this was the information that was available and out
16	there that surrounded him and other people like him.
17	Q. Did you do an analysis of other movies to
18	determine the number of movies that showed or portrayed
19	actors and actresses glamorizing smoking?
20	A. No, but that's one of those things I don't think
21	would have been -- it would be a very subjective kind of
22	question as to what is glamorous or not. So I'd
23	certainly -- movies often did show, as television shows
24	did as well sometimes, people smoking. And some of
25	those people were glamorous by some persons' definition,
300
1	and some of those people were very unglamorous. So it
2	was portrayed as an everyday activity, and I did not
3	attempt to count that up or categorize it. I don't
4	think that was necessary for my research.
5	Q. Similarly with television shows, and I believe
6	that you showed snippets today during your direct
7	examination, did you do a content analysis to determine
8	the number of television shows that aired at any time
9	period that made reference to tobacco and the dangers of
10	tobacco?
11	A. No. And I; again, I don't think that was
12	necessary. I certainly did not look at every television
13	show that aired over 24 hours over the past, you know,
14	40 or 50 years. No historian would. I --1 don't know
15	of anybody who would, to be honest, because in the same
16	way that, for example, I wrote a book on the history of
17	the Peace Corps, just happened to have -- happened to
18	been a book I wrote, I didn't interview every person who
19	was ever in the Peace Corps or accompany them for the
20	two years that they were there. It's simply not how my
21	profession works. So to answer your question, no, I did
22	not watch all television shows for all 50 years and then
23	count up --
24	Q. That was the question, whether or not you did a
25	content analysis, and I believe your answer is no, you
301
1	did not. Correct?
2	A. No, not -- not watching every hour of television
3	ever shown, no.
4	Q. Thank you.
5	And I didn't mean to suggest that you had to
6	watch every television show. I thought there might be
7	other means to determine, you know, by archives, by
8	library, by other information other than sitting down
9	and watching television shows or movies.
10	A. Well, to -- just to let you know, that is the
11	only way that you would know. I've done a lot of
12	research in moving picture archives. And there are no
13	catalogs detailed enough to let you know everything
14	that's in a clip or, as you call it, a snippet; or in
15	the case of a whole movie, one really must watch the
16	entire program to know. It is the only way to know.
17	Q. Do you have any evidence that David Ellsworth
18	watched Happy Days?
19	A. I believe that was one of the -- one of the ones
20	that one of his kids referred to. They said that they
21	liked to sit around as a family and watch sitcoms. I
22	think it was Rickey, if I recall right, who was the
23	stepson who recalled watching Happy Days.
24	Q. Do you have a recollection of Rickey testifying
25	when asked what his father watched, his answer was, "I
302
1	have no idea" ?
2	A. Yeah. His testimony was inconsistent.
3	Q. Well, is it inconsistent if Rickey Maheu
4	identified that shows that he watched, including Happy
5	Days, Saturday Night Live, and things of that nature?
6	A. Well, my recollection of the deposition --
7	again, we could pull it out, and that might be
8	helpful -- was that he said and I think another child
9	said that they liked to sit around and watch for two or
10	three hours of television after dinner. He remembered
11	some of what they watched. Did he know everything his
12	dad watched? He had no idea.
13	So -- so the questions as they were asked and
14	answered seemed to me fairly clear, but on the other
15	hand, you know, he was recalling something from a while
16	ago, and so he answered it as best he could.
17	Q. Do you have any evidence that David Ellsworth
18	watched Leave it to Beaver?
19	A. That wasn't a show that was mentioned or asked
20	about in the deposition, so I --1 don't, although he
21	did like situation comedies, which Leave it to Beaver
22	was one of the most famous situation comedies of all
23	time.
24	Q. Who testified that David Ellsworth liked
25	situational comedies?
303
1	A. Again, I think it was Rickey. He said, if I
2	believe -- this might not be an exact quote but
3	something similar to like, We liked all the old sitcoms.
4	I think that was the phrase that he used. Yeah, which I
5	took "old" to mean classic, well known, and that kind of
6	thing.
7	Q. Now, you -- you played a song, "Smoke Smoke
8	Smoke That Cigarette." Do the lyrics at all talk about
9	cancer?
10	A. No. That particular song from 1947 really is a
11	focus on addiction and -- and that fact that it shortens
12	life. But it's a song. It's not -- again, it's not a
13	textbook or, you know, a serious article. And the focus
14	is truly on addiction and on general health hazards.
15	Q. And the snippet that we heard, part of the
16	lyrics are him saying that "I reckon it won't kill me."
17	Correct?
18	A. Yes. That's -- I'm not dead yet, something like
19	that.
20	Q. And not only that, he said, "I reckon it won't
21	kill me."
22	A. Because he's not dead yet, right. No, it was
23	clearly --
24	Q. Is there anything in that song where he's
25	suggesting that cigarettes are dangerous to his health
304
1	and that he's going to die of cancer?
2	A. Oh, no. I think that the import of that song is
3	very clearly that he's speaking as a nicotine addict, I
4	think, is the phrase; and he's saying, They haven't
5	killed me yet, so I'm going to keep on doing it. But as
6	the -- as the -- you know, as it was shown on here --
7	I'm now, sir, holding up the same album cover I showed
8	earlier, it was a singing sermon, and in that sense
9	the -- sometimes humor is used in a way to point up
10	irony. And so when he said they -- they're not going to
11	kill me because I ain't dead yet, it was, I think, very
12	clearly a way of saying that they're hazardous.
13	Q. And when we see these snippets of movies and TV
14	shows where they use slang and they talk about
15	cigarettes, they are always seeming to be in jest,
16	aren't they?
17	A. Well, it would depend. Certainly the short
18	clips of television shows, like news shows, they're --
19	they're just never in jest. Situation comedies are --
20	they usually use irony. Like we saw the One Day at a
21	Time, and she said, When did you take up smoking, and he
22	says, I'm not smoking, and he's sitting there with a
23	cigarette, and she says, Well, your -- your mustache is
24	steaming. So it's joke. She's -- she's poking fun at
25	him but with a serious -- very serious meaning
305
1	underneath it. So irony can be, in fact, one of the
2	most effective ways of getting a message across. In
3	fact, over time the Surgeon General and the American
4	Cancer Society came to the conclusion that humor was the
5	most effective way to communicate harms because people
6	would, oddly enough, take it more seriously.
7	Q. Did you ever, in watching TV shows, movies, or
8	magazines, see irony or humor used on the subject of
9	AIDS in the'80s and'90s?
10	MR. DAVIS: I'll object to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: You know, this is -- this is a
12	very different subject, and I --1 haven't done research
13	on it, per se. I can't attest to the public service
14	announcements that might have been aired or booklets
15	that might have been written. I just --1 just don't
16	know.
17	BY MR. KAISER:
18	Q. And perhaps it's a different subject because
19	AIDS was a serious commentary because people knew of the
20	dangers. Correct?
21	A. Again, I think you're asking me to speculate.
22	It's a very different kind of disease, gained by
23	accident. Smoking was a disease where people had been
24	educated that it was a habit that if you did it over a
25	period of many, many years, it would create a harm.
1	It's such a very different thing, and I don't se any
2	parallel there.d.
3	Q. No parallel to the fact that perhaps humor was
4	used with smoking because people weren't aware that it
5	was really a deadly instrument?
6	A. No. I just don't think that that's accurate at
7	all.
8	MR. DAVIS: Allan, are you close to a stopping
9	point? We've been going about an hour, hour and a half.
10	MR. KAISER: Break?
11	MR. DAVIS: Can we take a few-minute break?
12	MR. KAISER: Yes.
13	MR. DAVIS: Okay. We'll take -- we'll take
14	five?
15	MR. KAISER: Okay.
16	MR. DAVIS: Okay. Thanks.
17	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record, the time is
18	5:11 p.m. This marks the end of Media No. 4.

20	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the record, the
21	time is 5:21 p.m. This marks the beginning of Media No.
22	5.
23	BY MR. KAISER:
24	Q. Do you believe that merely because "Smoke,
25	Smoke, Smoke That Cigarette" was a popular song, that
1	people who listened to it would have necessarily
2	memorized the lyrics?
3	A. No.
4	Q. Do you have any evidence that David Ellsworth
5	heard that song?
6	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
7	THE WITNESS: None, other than it was his
8	favorite type of music.
9	BY MR. KAISER:
10	Q. Other than that he liked country music.
11	Correct?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. There's been no one to say that David Ellsworth
14	heard the song "Smoke, Smoke, Smoke That Cigarette."
15	Correct?
16	A. I think most people weren't asked about it.
17	But, no, there isn't.
18	Q. One person was asked in particular, his brother,
19	who thought it was an advertisement. Correct?
20	A. His brother said he recalled the song and then
21	wasn't clear that he recalled the song at all.
22	Q. And, in fact, he said he thought it was an
23	advertisement for a cigarette. Correct?
24	A. Yeah. I think he might not have been recalling
25	that song, but it's not clear.
1	Q. Is it your testimony from his deposition that
2	Richard Ellsworth was not clear when he said it was a --
3	an advertisement for a cigarette?
4	A. I think -- again, I -- we'd have to look at it.
5	I think he said, I think it was or might have been an
6	advertisement. But I don't remember the precise line.
7	At first he seemed --
8	Q. (Inaudible) analyze the music from the '40s
9	through the '90s that talk about tobacco and cigarettes
10	and addiction?
11	MR. DAVIS: I'm sorry. Doctor, were you
12	finished with your last answer?
13	THE WITNESS: I think so.
14	MR. DAVIS: All right. I'm sorry, Allan.
15	You --1 didn't mean to interrupt your question.
16	BY MR. KAISER:
17	Q. Did you happen to analyze the music from the
18	'40s through the '90s and come up with a number of songs
19	that talk about tobacco and addiction?
20	A. Well, similarly to the television, I have not
21	listened to all of the music from that 50- or 60-year
22	period of time and made any kind of count. I've looked
23	at examples of where the hazards were communicated, and
24	that's -- that's exactly it.
25	Q. Did you -- you also testified about advice
309
1	columns, Ann Landers and her sister. Do you have any
2	evidence that David Ellsworth ever read a column written
3	by Ann Landers or her sister?
4	A. Again, all we know is that it was in the
5	newspapers he subscribed to. So we can't know exactly
6	what he read.
7	Q. Do you have any evidence that David Ellsworth
8	liked or read the advice columns in any newspaper?
9	A. It would have to be the same answer. I don't
10	know which articles he read of any of sort.
11	Q. You have no evidence that he ever read an Ann
12	Landers column, do you?
13	MR. DAVIS: Object to form. Asked and answered.
14	THE WITNESS: No.
15	BY MR. KAISER:
16	Q. Now, you talked about some slides with respect
17	to quitting smoking. In particular, it was No. 64, or
18	AIW_000470.
19	A. I think they're going to call that up, so let --
20	Q. Do you have that slide in front of you?
21	A. Not yet, but I will in a moment, I'm sure.
22	Our Slide 64 says about 30 million smokers
23	quitting. Is that the same one you're talking about?
24	Q. That's the same one I'm talking about.
25	A. Okay. Yeah. I have that.
310
1	Q. Can you identify the publication where you are
2	getting these figures, between '64 and '82, 30 million
3	smokers quitting smoking?
4	A. That particular -- there's an AIW number on
5	that, of course, that would allow us to pull up that
6	document. I can't remember which specific document it
7	was. It might have been one of the Surgeon General's or
8	one of the newspaper articles.
9	What I did there was to make up a -- rather than
10	show you the article itself, I'm just showing you
11	representation. So the counsel can pull up that
12	document.
13	Q. Do you have any information, as to the
14	30 million smokers that quit, how many of those smokers
15	were addicted to nicotine?
16	A. All we know is that 30 million people who smoked
17	quit. I don't know anything about the individual
18	histories of any of those people.
19	Q. Do you have any idea, of the 30 million smokers
20	who quit, how many of those 30 million smoked less than
21	a hundred cigarettes in their lifetime?
22	A. No. We just have the basic figure that
23	30 million quit.
24	Q. Of that basic figure that 30 million quit, do
25	you know how many of those people died of
311
1	smoking-related illnesses after they quit?
2	A. No. That's not the focus of the study at all.
3	Q. Do you have any information, as to the 30
4	million smokers that quit during this time period, how
5	many of them relapsed?
6	A. No. This is just the information that was
7	provided. I --1 don't --1 don't know that they are
8	aware of what subsequently happened with those
9	particular people.
10	Q. Do you think it's important for context that if
11	you're going to rely on a slide that talks about 30
12	million people quitting, you might have information
13	about how many of them relapsed?
14	A. No. I don't think that -- that's not the point
15	of this information. The point is to -- is absolutely
16	that David Ellsworth and people around him were exposed
17	to massive amounts of information about the hazards of
18	smoking, which would lead, and in fact did lead, half of
19	all living smokers to quit. How long they stayed quit
20	is -- is not pertinent to the question of what they knew
21	about the hazards.
22	Q. Well, what's pertinent is if someone was
23	addicted to the nicotine, perhaps they might have not
24	been able to stop. Do you think that might be
25	pertinent?
312
1	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
2	THE WITNESS: Well, in this case they did stop.
3	They did quit. And that's really -- that's all that's
4	relevant for the particular historical question I'm
5	asking and answering.
6	BY MR. KAISER:
7	Q. And for this particular historical question that
8	you're asking, is it your testimony that the 30 million
9	people that quit smoking quit because they were aware of
10	the dangers of smoking, and for no other reason?
11	A. No. What I'm saying is that there was a --1
12	would not try to get into the individual motivations of
13	those 30 million people in relation to anything, really.
14	What we're saying, and historians can say, is that there
15	was a great amount of information on hazards and that
16	smoking rates started to decline correspondingly and
17	that public health officials across America attributed
18	that decline to the -- to their efforts to expose people
19	to information about the hazards. So that's what we can
20	say. And I think that that's a very strong and accurate
21	point.
22	Q. In your research where your showed us that
23	30 million people quit smoking cigarettes during a given
24	period of time, did you also find any information about
25	how many people were starting to smoke for the first
313
1	time on any given day?
2	A. That's not something I looked at.
3	Q. Do you have any idea -- do you believe it's
4	pertinent -- when you say a number of people are
5	quitting, it's pertinent about the number of people that
6	are starting to smoke?
7	A. No, because it's not -- it's not a part of the
8	question I was asking as an expert.
9	Q. Do you think it might be relevant that many
10	people that might have started to smoke didn't know
11	about the health risk of smoking?
12	A. I don't think that that's true. I think that
13	people did know about the health risks of smoking, and
14	some people undertook those risks even though they knew
15	about it. In fact, there in the depositions, Carole
16	Maheu is an example of a person who said, I knew about
17	the risks, and I --1 started smoking anyway. I think
18	there was some other deposition testimony too to that
19	effect, although I'm just not remembering it as clearly
20	as I would like. But I'm sure Carole said that.
21	Q. Do you have any idea whether the number of
22	people and starting to smoke equaled the number of
23	people that were quitting each day?
24	A. No, I don't. That's not a part of my expert
25	testimony.
314
1	Q. You showed us some news shows, or they were
2	shown which we didn't see or hear, but news shows on
3	television. Did you do a content analysis to see how
4	many times the dangers of smoking was a topic on See it
5	Now with Edward R. Murrow?
6	A. No. I did not watch all the See it Nows to --
7	to undertake that. As I understand it, there were these
8	two programs where they were specials. But I did not
9	watch all of the See it Now.
10	Q. Did you do a content analysis to see how many
11	times the dangers of smoking was a topic on Face the
12	Nation?
13	A. No.
14	Q. Did you do a content analysis to see how many
15	appearances executives from the tobacco companies made
16	on television news shows where they denied that tobacco
17	was injurious to health?
18	A. Again, no, I didn't watch all news show. I did
19	do an analysis looking at the period after 1968 on the
20	Vanderbilt News Archives, as I mentioned earlier. And
21	what I found there, at least in these news archives, is
22	that it was a very tiny percentage where the tobacco
23	companies were ever featured. In fact, it was less than
24	2 percent of news stories. But I haven't, again,
25	watched all television across all time to see any other
315
1	mentions that might have been in there. This was just
2	what I could find in the news archives.
3	Q. So, then, in answer to my question when I asked
4	if you did a content analysis to see how many
5	appearances executives from tobacco companies made on
6	television news shows where they denied that tobacco was
7	injurious to health, is your answer, no, you did not?
8	A. Well, honestly, I feel like we keep getting a
9	little bit of unclarity here because I said -- if you're
10	asking if I watched all television, which is the only
11	way to do a content to analyze all shows is to watch all
12	shows, I did not do that. But then you said that's not
13	what you meant. So that's the --
14	Q. Do you think --
15	A. -- only way that I could understand to -- to do
16	an analysis of all shows that have been ever shown is to
17	watch all the shows that have been ever shown. But I
18	did do --1 did do an analysis --
19	Q. Do you know whether or not the tobacco companies
20	have records of their executives making appearances on
21	television shows in their archives?
22	MR. DAVIS: I don't think she heard the
23	question. Can you repeat it, Allan?
24	BY MR. KAISER:
25	Q. Do you have any idea whether the tobacco
316
1	companies had in their archives information about the
2	number of appearances their executives might have made
3	on television shows where they deny that tobacco was
4	injurious to health?
5	A. No. I did not look at their internal documents,
6	because it wasn't a part of the scope of my research.
7	Q. So in answer to my question it's, no, you did
8	not?
9	A. No, I did not.
10	Q. Thank you.
11	Did you do a content analysis to see how many
12	appearances were made by representatives of the tobacco
13	industry on any television news shows where they denied
14	that tobacco was injurious to health?
15	A. Well, as I just answered, I did do a numerical
16	analysis, which might be slightly different from a
17	content analysis. I did a numerical analysis using the
18	Vanderbilt archives and found that I believe it was 1.84
19	percent of the time there was some sort of feature on
20	the tobacco industry over a period of about 30 years,
21	which meant that almost 98 percent of the time, or more
22	than 98 percent of the time, it wasn't. So that's a
23	kind of analysis. But I did not watch all of the hours
24	ever broadcast.
25	Q. I'd like to know about this analysis where you
317
1	got these numbers from. Can you tell me your
2	methodology for telling us that a very, very small
3	percentage of tobacco companies were reported in
4	newspaper articles, please, after 1968?
5	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
6	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry, sir. We're talking
7	about newspaper articles?
8	BY MR. KAISER:
9	Q. We're talking about what you keep telling us
10	about the Vanderbilt news archives. And I want to know
11	what your methodology was for telling us that about
12	5 percent of comments in newspaper articles were from
13	tobacco companies, please.
14	A. Now, actually I think you're getting two
15	subjects together there. The Vanderbilt News Archives
16	are only for broadcast television. That's different
17	from newspaper articles. Vanderbilt is not a newspaper
18	article archive.
19	Q. Well, then, where did you use your methodology
20	to determine the percentage of newspaper stories where
21	the tobacco companies had a comment on rare instances?
22	A. That's -- let me tell you about that. What I
23	did -- again, I couldn't read every newspaper in the
24	whole country, so the newspaper that I focused on was
25	one I had access to, which was the Los Angeles Times. I
318
1	consider it representative not only because it's a large
2	metropolitan newspaper but because, like most
3	newspapers, many, many of the articles came from what
4	are called the wire services. So, for example, an
5	article by Associated Press would appear typically
6	verbatim, word for word, in Miami and Los Angeles and
7	New York, et cetera. So all of these newspapers did
8	very -- worked in very similar ways.
9	And with the Los Angeles Times, what I did was
10	to go through every page of the Los Angeles Times --
11	now, I did this with some research assistants as well
12	because, again, no human being, one person, can do all
13	this -- went through every page of the Los Angeles Times
14	for 50 years -- some of it I did with myself, some of it
15	I did with my research assistants -- and collected every
16	article that we could find on the subject of -- of
17	tobacco.
18	So there were 2,100 and I think 97 articles
19	altogether, and of those there were about 2 percent that
20	focused on the industry's position, which meant
21	98 percent didn't. And there was -- there, pardon me,
22	were about 5 1/2 percent where there was a passing
23	comment in some way that was on the industry's position.
24	And that's the kind of thing I tried to show the jur—
25	or did show the jury earlier when we were looking at
319
1	that Miami newspaper.
2	So that's what I would consider a passing
3	reference, where the major part of the article is about
4	Leroy Burney's warning, and then a couple paragraphs in
5	the middle, or sometimes it's just a line, but in that
6	case it was about a paragraph, maybe a long paragraph,
7	was the response; and then the rest of the article is
8	about the -- about Leroy Burney.
9	So I found that out of those 2,197 articles,
10	about 5 percent were of that sort. So this was a
11	statistical analysis that I did myself. So that --
12	that's -- that's --
13	Q. Did you ever consult the Tobacco Legacy
14	Documents for transcripts of public appearances by
15	executives and representatives of the industry?
16	A. I'm sorry. Would you mind repeating that?
17	Q. Did you ever consult Tobacco Legacy Documents
18	for transcripts of public appearances by executives and
19	representatives of the industry?
20	A. No.
21	Q. You talked about polls. I'd like to know if
22	you've ever published any articles on polling and the
23	effectiveness of polls.
24	A. No. That -- that's something that a political
25	scientist or a pollster would do, and I'm -- I'm neither
320
1	of those things, so I have not.
2	Q. I'd like to know if you've ever conducted
3	research on the biases associated with open-ended versus
4	closed-ended questions on polls.
5	A. No.
6	Q. I'd like to know if you've ever conducted
7	research on the biases associated with how questions are
8	formulated on polls.
9	A. No. I'm -- I'm familiar with that as -- as an
10	issue in polling, which is why scientific polling became
11	so important. But I've never -- I've never written an
12	article or done research into it in any depth.
13	Q. (Inaudible) ever conducted research on the
14	reliability of polls generally.
15	A. No. That's outside the scope of my research.
16	Q. Have you ever conducted a poll for any research
17	that you've done?
18	A. No. I --1 rely upon professional pollsters. I
19	have not conducted a poll myself.
20	Q. And you rely on the Gallup poll. Do you find
21	the Gallup poll organization to be a reputable and
22	reliable source of information?
23	A. Well, I consider them to be never good
24	scientific pollsters. They certainly are the most
25	respected in the country. But to use the word "rely," I
321
1	would not ever rely on any one thing out of context.
2	But certainly if I were to look for polls, I would go
3	first to Gallup. So I hope that answers your question.
4	They're very good.
5	Q. One -- one poll that you showed us was from June
6	of 1954 where the question was asked, Have you heard or
7	read anything recently to the effect that cigarette
8	smoking may be a cause of cancer of the lung?
9	Have you read any studies to indicate why you
10	would get such a high response to that type of question?
11	A. No. I'm just looking at the poll itself.
12	Q. Is this a closed-end question or an open-end
13	question?
14	A. It's a yes-or-no question. So as I understand
15	it, but I'm not an expert in this, it would be closed,
16	because it's yes or no.
17	Q. Is this the kind of question that suggests the
18	answer or not?
19	A. You know, I can't comment on that. I'm just not
20	an expert on that subject.
21	Q. Have you read any type of studies about polling
22	that suggest that people want to give the right answer?
23	A. No. I -- I've not -- have not researched
24	polling, per se.
25	Q. Do you believe that you would get a similar
322
1	response if the question were phrased, What, if
2	anything, have you heard recently about cigarette
3	smoking?
4	A. I just can't comment on that.
5	Q. Have you done any research whatsoever on that
6	issue?
7	A. No. I've not done research into polling
8	methodology.
9	Q. Have you seen a poll from January 1954 from
10	Gallup, that you say is the polls on which you relied,
11	that asked, What, if anything -- that asked, In what way
12	do you think cigarette smoking is harmful?
13	Do you recall that particular poll?
14	A. Yes, I do.
15	Q. And do you recall that 92 percent of the people
16	asked that did not say cancer?
17	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: Seventy-six percent, I think, in
19	that poll said -- that was an open-ended poll, speaking
20	of, and they said it was respiratory -- created
21	respiratory problems of some sort or another. But I
22	think you're right. Given an open-ended answer, some
23	people, and it was a small percentage, came up with
24	cancer. Many others said it would harm your lungs in
25	some way. They might have meant cancer, but I don't
2	Q. (Inaudible) there is a difference in asking a
3	question, In what way do you think cigarette smoking is
4	harmful, where the answer's not given, as opposed to,
5	Have you heard or read anything recently to the effect
6	that cigarette smoking may be a cause of cancer of the
7	lung?
8	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
9	THE WITNESS: Yes. It's just a different type
10	of question.
11	BY MR. KAISER:
12	Q. You also showed us another poll from 1954,
13	well-known facts, on Slide 33.
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. Do you see where that poll might be a little
16	misleading that you're showing us and this jury?
17	A. Do me a favor. Just give us a second so we can
18	get that particular slide back up.
19	I'm -- yes. We do have that up now.
20	Thank you.
21	Q. Do you see anything misleading about that poll
22	that you showed the jury today?
23	A. No.
24	Q. Do you see the questions; and the questions, are
25	they all the same type of questions, where they're just
1	awareness questions and not belief questions?
2	A. There -- there are different types of questions,
3	and they are phrased differently, but I don't think of
4	that as misleading at all.
5	Q. Aren't they totally different questions that
6	ask, on the one hand, belief as opposed to awareness?
7	A. No. I -- "Where was Jesus bom?" doesn't seem
8	to me a belief question at all.
9	Q. Do you think that that in any way is even close
10	to a question such as, "Have you heard or read recently
11	that cigarette smoking may be a cause of lung cancer?"
12	A. No. I honestly do believe that these are --
13	they're differently kinds -- different kinds of
14	questions and phrased differently, but they're all
15	getting at what a person knows or has heard about.
16	So-
il	Q. Do you think a similar awareness question for
18	the Jesus question would be, Have you heard or read
19	anything recently that Jesus was bom in Bethlehem?
20	Would that be a similar question, ma'am?
21	MR. DAVIS: Object to the fomi.
22	THE WITNESS: It could have been phrased
23	differently. And, of course, there are a variety of
24	questions. Another question that was phrased more
25	similarly to the last one, that Gallup actually
1	mentioned in some of his articles, was, Have you heard
2	or read recently about the Kinsey Report? which it's not
3	very familiar to people today, but that was extremely
4	controversial at the time because it was about sex.
5	There the number was, I think, 42 percent.
6	So again, what Gallup was trying to do and what
7	I'm trying to do is to -- is to show the jury that --
8	that things that were -- people -- you would expect they
9	would know about, that would be -- come readily to their
10	lips, did not, and whereas this particular fact -- and
11	as Gallup himself said about his later poll, that this
12	was a phenomenal figure. So I don't think it's
13	misleading at all.
14	BY MR. KAISER:
15	Q. Do you think you might have got a less
16	percentage if the question was, What, if anything, have
17	you heard recently about cigarette smoking?
18	A. No. I --1 don't think there's any reason to
19	think it would have been very different. This is the
20	question they chose to ask. It seems a very fair
21	question.
22	Q. You don't think there's any difference in that
23	question where it doesn't suggest an answer about
24	smoking and lung cancer. Is that what you're saying?
25	MR. DAVIS: Yeah. I think y'all are talking
1	over each other.
2	Dr. Hoffman, were you finished with your answer?
3	THE WITNESS: Well, I was finishing it, but
4	now -- no I lost track.
5	MR. DAVIS: Okay.
6	THE WITNESS: Sorry.
7	BY MR. KAISER:
8	Q. And similarly, ma'am, instead of, "What is the
9	first book of the Bible?" would it not be a similar
10	question to the one on lung cancer if it was, Have you
11	heard or read recently that the first book of the Bible
12	is Genesis? Would that be similar to the 90 percent
13	responsive question on that poll?
14	A. I don't know if the answer would have been
15	different. The phrasing would have been different.
16	Q. Are you aware, ma'am, that in 1998 the Wall
17	Street Journal accused historians like you of using
18	these polls and misusing these polls in court?
19	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form. It's
20	argumentative.
21	THE WITNESS: I'm aware that -- I'm not sure
22	entirely what you're referring to, but I think you might
23	be referring to a person at the Gallup organization who,
24	50 years later, said that one historian had
25	misinterpreted the polls. I surely know that George
327
1	Gallup -- and as a historian we're always looking for
2	material that's (sic) occurs at the same time that
3	something actually happened in time. And George Gallup
4	thought that it was a remarkable number.
5	So I --1 --1 know there was a controversy in
6	the late '90s, but I don't know much about it, and nor
7	would I --
8	Q. (Inaudible) question --
9	A. -- think it's very relevant.
10	Q. My question was, in the historical record did
11	you come across a Wall Street Journal article from 1998
12	where Gallup was accusing historians like Mr. Lacey of
13	misrepresenting their polls in court?
14	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
15	THE WITNESS: No. Actually I did not come
16	across that Wall Street Journal article.
17	BY MR. KAISER:
18	Q. Well, let me refer you to the Wall Street
19	Journal article from 1998, where it says, among other
20	things, that Gallup maintains that far from proving that
21	the link between smoking and lung cancer was commonly
22	known, his 1954 poll actually showed a high degree of
23	doubt and confusion about the dangers of smoking. Do
24	you disagree with that statement?
25	A. Yes, I do.
328
1	Q. Further in the article the Gallup organization
2	said, "Presenting selective data or distorting the
3	meaning of individual Gallup poll questions out of
4	context violates the purpose and the spirit in which
5	these surveys were originally written." Do you disagree
6	with that?
7	A. If it occurred, I --1 wouldn't disagree. But
8	I --1 don't think it occurred at all. These same polls
9	were asked many times over many, many years, and the
10	results were very consistent. I don't think there's any
11	misinterpretation here at all.
12	Q. Further, the article said, "We are outraged at
13	this, and we are going to be following up with a similar
14	effort to the Gallup organization because this is a
15	misuse of our poll." Do you agree that that was a
16	misuse of the poll by referring to this exact poll in
17	1954?
18	A. No. I don't think it was a misuse at all. I
19	mean, obviously this was a person in the Gallup
20	organization. It certainly wasn't George Gallup
21	himself. George Gallup himself said in -- in articles,
22	not just polls, himself, in his syndicated column, said
23	it was remarkable the degree to which people had heard
24	about and -- and knew this information.
25	So when I take a slide like the one I created
329
1	there, I'm using his polls, and I'm saying basically
2	what he said, not just in a poll but in an article, he
3	himself --
4	Q. This is part of --
5	A. -- George Gallup, not a staff member 40 or 50
6	years later.
7	Q. And then finally in this Wall Street Journal
8	article, they said, "Gallup tolerates people using our
9	data all the time in various forums and provides broad
10	latitude in interpreting what that data means. But we
11	felt this really crossed the time in terms of being an
12	unacceptable and inaccurate interpretation that really
13	could not be tolerated, especially given the impact that
14	it might be having." Do you disagree with that
15	statement?
16	A. Yes, absolutely. I mean, I don't disagree that
17	the person said it. You know, again, it wasn't George
18	Gallup, but that person said it. I would certainly
19	disagree with that.
20	Q. So it's your contention that the Gallup poll
21	from 1954 that you showed in Slide 33, where four of the
22	questions are fact questions, did you know questions, or
23	where questions, are similar to the question about,
24	"Have you heard or read recently that cigarette smoking
25	may be a cause of lung cancer?"
330
1	A. Well, as I said, we could substitute out the
2	Kinsey question, which would also fall -- in fact, it
3	would be to the left of the one on the Bible, and it
4	would be worded exactly as you're saying the other one
5	was. And again, it would show that something that was
6	commonly known by many people wasn't as commonly known
7	as the fact that cigarettes and cancer had been linked.
8	So I just think that it's a fair comparison.
9	Q. Did you consider advertising when you were doing
10	your research in this case?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. Did you consider advertising on the radio?
13	A. Now, radio was not something to which I was able
14	to get good archival references. I just don't even know
15	where it's been archived. Early radio changed --
16	Q. Well, did you start with the tobacco companies'
17	archives to see if they had any transcripts of shows on
18	which they sponsored their cigarettes?
19	A. No.
20	Q. Did you attempt to find out from any of the
21	Tobacco Archives or from any -- any of the tobacco
22	representatives whether they had transcripts of radio
23	shows for any given year from the '30s, '40s, and '50s
24	that indicated that they sponsored radio programs?
25	A. No, but it also doesn't seem to me a relevant
331
1	question. What I was interested in is -- and then
2	sponsorship, of course, can mean different things. It
3	can mean -- like, there was the Texaco Hour, for
4	example. And we know Texaco was an oil company. But,
5	you know, sponsorship did not always mean that there
6	were extensive commentaries on what the product was.
7	Toothpaste was a -- Pepsodent was, in fact, one of
8	the -- one of the artic— clips I have had a Pepsodent
9	toothpaste sponsor. So I just didn't think that those
10	things were relevant.
11	And also keep in mind that the period of time
12	we're looking at is a period in which television was
13	predominant. And there we do have some public archives
14	for those. So I just did not work on radio. I --1
15	didn't think it was necessary.
16	Q. Thank you for that answer, but my question, I
17	think was, content analysis as to the number of radio
18	shows in any given year from the '30s, '40s, and '50s
19	that were sponsored by tobacco companies, did you do
20	such an analysis?
21	A. No. I didn't think it was relevant. I did not.
22	Q. Thank you.
23	And an Analysis as to the number of cigarette
24	commercials per hour on any given day from the radio at
25	any period of time, did you do that?
332
I	A. No. I'm not aware that that's available. I --
2	Q. Did you -- did you try and find any primary
3	sources from the Tobacco Archives to see if, in fact,
4	they did exist?
5	A. No. I have no reason to think they did, and I
6	did not do that work.
7	Q. Did you -- did you ask anybody?
8	A. No.
9	Q. Did you ask any of the lawyers to whom you would
10	contact whether or not they had archival information of
II	this information?
12	A. As a historian, I did not do that, because
13	you -- part of your training is to understand what kinds
14	of archives and what kinds of materials would be kept in
15	different places. So that would not, to me, have been a
16	logical place to go. If I wanted to do an archival
17	investigation into radio, I would have probably gone to
18	NBC or CBS. I just -- again, I didn't think that radio
19	was the most relevant medium here. But I also just
20	wouldn't have gone, and so I did not go, nor did I speak
21	with any attorneys about that.
22	Q. That was my question, and I guess the answer is,
23	no, you did not. Thank you.
24	And you're saying --
25	A. That's correct.
333
1	Q. — saying that radio wasn't an important medium
2	for you. How was radio not important in connection with
3	the public information that was available about smoking
4	and health?
5	A. As I said, I didn't think it was as important as
6	television. It's not entirely irrelevant. And, in
7	fact, I do have radio programs on -- for example, the
8	American Cancer Society did some radio programs. And
9	they have did an analysis in one of their reports,
10	saying that --1 think it was once every three days in
11	the 1950s, one of their messages came across radio and
12	television across the United States. So I did collect
13	some information on radio, but it just --1 didn't think
14	it was as important in this period of time as television
15	became, in the era that we're talking about.
16	Q. Did you think it might be important in the '30s,
17	'40s, and '50s, before the television, whether or not
18	radios had various spot ads for cigarettes?
19	A. Well, keep in mind, you know, we are talking
20	about David Ellsworth. And so there's not a lot of
21	indication that -- that he was a heavy radio listener.
22	I think there's some, that he listened to country music
23	on the radio. But I didn't think that this was as
24	important.
25	Also keep in mind, again, it's simply not
334
1	available in the same way that the television programs
2	have been archived. So history is always about
3	filing -- finding resources that we do have, because
4	people don't save everything. So we go to what has been
5	saved. And television has been archived in a way that
6	radio has not.
7	Q. Was there evidence in the record, ma'am, where
8	David Ellsworth's family had a radio when he was a child
9	growing up in Providence?
10	A. I believe there's some reference that they
11	listened to some radio.
12	Q. David Ellsworth would have been able to listen
13	to a radio sometime in the 1930s as a child, wouldn't
14	he?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. David Ellsworth would have had an opportunity to
17	listen to the radio as a child in the '40s, wouldn't he?
18	A. Yes, like all of this information I've
19	presented.
20	Q. Is it your -- is it your testimony that
21	advertising for cigarettes was not relevant as public
22	information in the '30s and '40s to people like David
23	Ellsworth?
24	A. No, no. That's not what I'm saying. I --1
25	think advertising is relevant. And again, groups like
335
1	the FTC have analyzed television, and we've done some
2	analysis of newspapers. There's no reason to think that
3	radio would have been terribly different from other
4	kinds of media. But there -- they would have been
5	there, and they would have been a proportion of ads but
6	not overwhelming compared to, you know, the 90 percent
7	or more of advertising which is for other things. So it
8	seems to me relevant but not in the way you're
9	suggesting.
10	Q. If radio advertising represented 10 percent of
11	advertising, are you saying that's minimal?
12	A. Well, actually it was less than that. It was
13	7 percent on television. So 93 percent was for other
14	things. I'm not saying it's minimal, but I'm saying
15	that proportionately it's certainly not anything
16	approaching the majority of what people see. The
17	majority of what people see is for other things.
18	Also, of course --
19	Q. Do you disagree that the cigarette companies
20	were the largest advertiser on television?
21	A. I do disagree.
22	Q. Okay. Have you done a content analysis as to
23	the number of televisions shows at any given time from
24	the '50s and '60s that were sponsored by tobacco
25	companies?
336
1	A. Again, all I've done is I've used the records
2	provided by the federal government that say how --
3	how -- how prevalent television advertising was for
4	cigarettes. And they said 7 percent, approximately. So
5	I have not watched all shows, if that's what you mean by
6	content analysis, to see every show that was ever shown.
7	But I suppose someone in the FTC did, because that's the
8	number that they gave.
9	Q. Have you done an analysis of the number of TV
10	commercials that would air on any particular TV station
11	at any given time in the '50s and '60s?
12	A. No.
13	Q. Have you considered billboard advertising during
14	David Ellsworth's lifetime?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. Have you done any analysis of the number of
17	billboards and product placement on billboards in Miami
18	in the 1960s and '70s?
19	A. No. I'm unaware of that information being
20	available.
21	Q. Have you done an analysis of the amount of money
22	spent by tobacco companies on advertisements on
23	billboards in Miamis (sic) in the '60s and '70s?
24	A. No, but keep in mind that is outside the scope
25	of my research.
337
1	Q. Have you done any information (sic) as to the --
2	the -- the dollars spent by tobacco companies and
3	whether or not they were the largest single advertiser
4	on billboards?
5	A. No. That's, again, outside the scope of my
6	testimony, which was about information about harms that
7	was being put out.
8	Q. Did you consider ads on public transportation?
9	A. No. I'm not aware of there being any tallies or
10	any way of doing that, in fact.
11	Q. Did you do an analysis of the number of
12	cigarette ads that would appear on buses at any time in
13	a given year in Providence, Rhode Island, in the '40s
14	and'50s?
15	A. No.
16	Q. Did you consult with the tobacco industry
17	representatives to see if they had information?
18	A. No. This wasn't the focus of my research at
19	all.
20	Q. Did -- did you do -- you weren't interested in
21	the public information about ads appearing on public
22	transportation?
23	A. No. My -- my question was about what was the
24	information about harms that was available to people.
25	So that was the focus of my research, and that is what I
338
1	worked on.
2	Q. Did you do an analysis of the amount of money
3	spent by tobacco companies to advertise on various
4	public transportation during the 1940s and '50s in
5	Providence, Rhode Island?
6	A. No.
7	Q. Did you do an analysis of the amount of money
8	that -- tobacco moneys that the tobacco companies spent
9	to advertise on public transportation during the '50s,
10	'60s, '70s, and '80s in Miami?
11	A. No. And nowhere is there an indication that
12	David Ellsworth was a person who took public
13	transportation. He was a small businessman.
14	Q. Whether you take public transportation or not,
15	would you necessarily see public transportation, walking
16	outdoors?
17	A. I don't think you would see the inside of buses.
18	But I just don't know. I -- and I do think that there
19	was advertising, but in no way did it ever overwhelm
20	this larger message about the harms.
21	Q. Do you know whether or not buses had ads on the
22	outside so that they could be seen by people walking
23	down the street?
24	A. I just don't know if buses did at that time
25	have -- have ads on the outside.
339
1	Q. Do you know whether cabs had advertisements on
2	the back of their hoods that people could see?
3	A. I'm sorry. Which? The hoods of a bus?
4	Q. Do you know whether or not that taxicabs on the
5	back, on their trunks of their cars, had huge cigarette
6	ads?
7	A. I'm unaware. I -- I've never seen any pictures
8	to that -- of that in that period of time.
9	Q. Did you do any research whether David Ellsworth
10	was exposed to cigarette advertising by R.J. Reynolds
11	and any other tobacco companies by way of television?
12	A. Well, he -- in the depositions, he apparently at
13	one point when his -- and this is the only testimony
14	that we would have to this effect -- told his daughter,
15	when they saw some ads, that it was just to get people
16	to smoke, and he dismissed the ads. He -- he criticized
17	the ads. So he must have seen some ads, because he --
18	he criticized them to his daughter. But that's the only
19	evidence we have.
20	Q. So is the answer to my question, yes, he was
21	exposed to cigarette advertising by R.J. Reynolds and
22	other tobacco companies by way of television?
23	A. Well, his daughter testified that they saw some
24	ads, she didn't say how many, that they saw an ad at
25	least at one point, and he criticized it. That's --
340
1	that's the only thing we know of.
2	Q. My question was, was he exposed to cigarette
3	advertising, regardless of whether he criticized it?
4	A. Well, again, it's like your question of, Do we
5	know he watched a particular show? We do know he
6	watched a lot of television, and before 1970 -- after
7	1970 he would have seen none. So for the last 24 years
8	of his life, he wouldn't have seen any. But before
9	that, probably around 7 percent of the ads he saw --
10	now, that wouldn't have been all the programs;
11	programming would have been much longer than ads --
12	hypothetically, he would have seen that amount of ads.
13	Q. Did you research whether David Ellsworth was
14	exposed to cigarette advertising by R.J. Reynolds and
15	other tobacco companies by way of radio?
16	A. I have no way of determining that.
17	Q. Did you see whether or not or did you do
18	research whether David Ellsworth was exposed to
19	cigarette advertising through advertisements on
20	billboards?
21	A. Again, I have no way of knowing that.
22	Q. Did you see research where David Ellsworth or
23	did you conduct research where David Ellsworth was
24	exposed to cigarette advertising through ads on public
25	transportation?
1	A. No.
2	Q. Did you research to what extent the cigarette
3	companies were responsible for creating the climate
4	where smoking was seen as a normal behavior in the '40s?
5	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
6	THE WITNESS: I --1 -- I'm not even sure what
7	you mean by the question, to be honest. How would --
8	could you rephrase it for me?
9	BY MR. KAISER:
10	Q. Did you see research where the extent of
11	cigarette companies -- to the extent that cigarette
12	companies were reasonable for creating the climate where
13	cigarettes were seen as normal behavior in the '50s?
14	A. No.
15	Q. Did you see or research to what extent the --
16	the cigarette companies were responsible for creating
17	the climate where smoking was seen as normal behavior in
18	the'60s?
19	A. No.
20	Q. In the'70s?
21	A. No, other than in the sense that if that they
22	had ads, like products for any other kind of ad, the
23	person in the ad would appear to be normal, doing
24	something normal. But, no, other than that, no.
25	Q. When did David Ellsworth start smoking
1	cigarettes?
2	A. I don't think we know. The testimony was
3	unclear on that. There was no --1 think his brother
4	Richard, who I believe is three years older than him,
5	said he never saw his brother smoke, I think until he
6	came home from the Army. But -- but, you know, it's --
7	it's just not known. He might have started earlier than
8	that.
9	Q. Did you read Richard Ellsworth's sworn statement
10	where he said that his brother started smoking at 11
11	or 12?
12	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: You know, I just don't remember
14	that statement. Maybe I'm confusing Donald and Richard
15	and here.
16	BY MR. KAISER:
17	Q. Did you study whether adolescents like David
18	Ellsworth were able to make good decisions about things
19	such as trying cigarettes at the age of 11 or 12?
20	A. I'm sorry. I think we were speaking over each
21	other. Would you mind just repeating that?
22	Q. Did you study whether or not adolescents like
23	David Ellsworth were able to make good decisions about
24	things like trying cigarettes when they were 11 or 12
25	years old?
1	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: No. I'm not a psychologist. I —
3	I haven't done research into adolescent brain
4	development.
5	BY MR. KAISER:
6	Q. Did you study the reasons why people like David
7	Ellsworth tried their first cigarette in the '40s and
8	'50s?
9	A. Well, in -- in testimony what was said was --
10	and I believe, again, one of the brothers and maybe some
11	of the others said that they -- that they wanted to do
12	it because they thought it was a grownup kind of thing
13	to do. But other than that, no.
14	Q. Did you study to what extent RJ. Reynolds and
15	the other tobacco companies concealed from the public
16	material information about the health risk and addictive
17	nature of smoking?
18	A. No. I did no research at all on their internal
19	archives. I was only looking at what the public saw.
20	Q. You do not disagree, do you, that the National
21	Commission on Smoking and Public Policy reported in 1978
22	that the tobacco industry spent more in one day than the
23	National Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health spent for
24	PSAs in one year?
25	A. You know, I --1 don't remember that specific
1	report. To be honest, I'd have to look at it. I have
2	heard some similar figures, or statements anyway.
3	One thing to keep in mind about that is that
4	public service announcements were free, so the
5	Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health wouldn't have to pay
6	for those things. So free advertisement is free.
7	It's -- tobacco companies had to pay for all of their
8	ads. So it's not a very -- it's not a very good
9	comparison.
10	Q. In your depos— in your trial testimony on
11	April 10th of 2013 in the Anderson, as personal
12	representative for the Estate of Begley, do you recall
13	the question and answer on page 2770, where the question
14	was, "In 1978, if the tobacco industry spent more on
15	advertising cigarettes in one day than the National
16	Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health, the government's
17	primary agency working in this area, spent in one year,
18	do you have any reason to disagree with that?"
19	The answer, "I'm sorry. I had to get to your
20	page."
21	"Question: Page —"
22	"Answer: No. I have no reason to think that,
23	to disagree about the budget figures between the
24	National Commission on Smoking and Health and the
25	companies advertising. Again, that's certainly not the
345
1	only way people heard about harms, but I didn't research
2	their budget."
3	Do you recall that question and answer?
4	A. Not specifically, but it -- it sounds like it
5	was very much the same question and then a similar
6	answer that I gave there on both times. I certainly
7	don't recall the page number, but sounds -- yeah, it
8	sounds like pretty much the same thing.
9	Q. In that question and answer, did you hear
10	anything in the answer about the fact that the
11	Clearinghouse didn't have to pay for their
12	advertisements, because they were free?
13	A. I didn't put that in the answer at that time.
14	It's -- it's the true fact. I didn't say it then, but I
15	am saying it now. It's -- it's -- it's just how it
16	occurred to me to phrase it this time as opposed to last
17	time. But the -- the message is -- is the same both
18	times. I did not research the budget figures, no reason
19	to think their budget figures are wrong. But it is also
20	true that PSAs were free.
21	Q. Have you completed your answer?
22	A. Yes, sir.
23	Q. Have you completed your answer?
24	A. Yes, I have.
25	Q. You talked about warning labels beginning in
346
1	1966, and you talked about the AMA felt that warnings
2	were not necessary. Do you recall that testimony?
3	A. Yes, I do.
4	Q. Were you aware that the tobacco industry gave
5	the AMA $10 million in exchange for the AMA opining that
6	the warnings were not necessary?
7	A. No. I'm not aware that there was a bribe
8	involved. I don't have any evidence to that effect.
9	Q. Did you ever do research on the extent of the
10	millions of dollars that the tobacco industry gave to
11	the American Medical Association during this time?
12	A. Well, that's a -- that's a very different thing.
13	They were -- they did fund research, and some of that
14	money went to the American Medical Association. But I
15	think your first question was -- the way you phrased it
16	was that they paid them this money to opine in the
17	manner that they did, which is -- which is a different
18	kind of statement. I'm aware that they funded some
19	research by the AMA.
20	Q. And what is the amount of funding of which you
21	are aware?
22	A. Again, that's just outside the scope of my
23	research, so I did not look into the specific budgets to
24	different medical groups. I know they funded a variety
25	of medical groups, including the AMA, but I don't know
347
1	the numbers.
2	Q. Do you think the cautionary statement in 1966
3	adequately warned the public about the health risk of
4	smoking?
5	A. I -- that's not --1 don't think that that's my
6	call. I -- that was what the Congress wanted it to
7	read. Certainly the public was being warned in multiple
8	ways.
9	If that had been the only warning that the
10	public ever received at any time, it probably wouldn't
11	have been sufficient. But that warning was in addition
12	to -- as Dr. Heller said and Dr. Horn said and
13	Dr. Burney said, that was -- that warning was in
14	addition to more than a decade's worth of very explicit
15	warnings, so --
16	Q. Do you think cautionary statement in 1966
17	adequately warned the public about the addictive nature
18	of nicotine in cigarettes?
19	A. I don't have an opinion on that.
20	Q. If David Ellsworth had been a regular smoker for
21	almost 15 years at the time these cautions went on the
22	packs of cigarettes, did you consider whether he was
23	addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes when the warnings
24	went on the packs in 1966?
25	A. That's outside my professional expertise. I'm
348
1	sorry. I just can't comment on it.
2	Q. Have you studied the effects of addiction on
3	smokers?
4	A. No.
5	Q. When the packages of cigarettes -- when the
6	warnings or the cautions went on the packs of cigarettes
7	from 1966 to 1970, did the Surgeon General endorse the
8	cautions?
9	A. Well, they were the Surgeon General's warnings.
10	Is that what you mean? I'm -- I'm sorry. I don't
11	follow.
12	Q. No. My question is, on the -- on the warnings,
13	on the cautions, did the Surgeon General endorse the
14	cautions anywhere on the packs of cigarettes that
15	contained the caution?
16	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
17	THE WITNESS: I think what you're asking is, was
18	the name of the Surgeon General on that first warning?
19	And, no, it wasn't. It was on the second warning that
20	they used the phrase "The Surgeon General."
21	BY MR. KAISER:
22	Q. Where on the packs of cigarettes from 1966 to
23	1970 did the caution say that smoking cigarettes is
24	hazardous to your health?
25	A. It's -- it was printed on the side of the
349
1	package.
2	Q. And, in fact, it didn't say it's hazardous to
3	your health; it said, "Smoking may be hazardous to your
4	health." Is that not correct?
5	A. Yes. And if you like, we can bring up those
6	cautions again. I don't have them memorized. But they
7	did change, and over time the Congress made them what
8	they thought was stronger and stronger.
9	Q. Ma'am, my question was, in 1966 where on the
10	packages of cigarettes did the caution say that
11	cigarette smoking is hazardous to health?
12	A. It didn't. It said it may be hazardous to
13	health.
14	Q. Where on the packages of cigarettes did the
15	first caution advise how cigarettes could be hazardous
16	to health?
17	A. Are -- are you asking about the 1984 warnings
18	that they were -- they gave --
19	Q. Ma'am, I'm talking about the 1966 cautions.
20	Where on those packages of cigarettes, where the 1966
21	cautions appeared from 1966 to 1970, did that caution
22	advise how cigarettes could be hazardous?
23	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
24	THE WITNESS: What they advertised or, so to
25	speak, warned was that it was hazardous. They didn't
350
1	say how.
2	BY MR. KAISER:
3	Q. Okay. That was my question. So in answer to my
4	question, ma'am, is your answer it did not say on that
5	caution?
6	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
7	THE WITNESS: That's correct. It did not list
8	any specific disease.
9	BY MR. KAISER:
10	Q. Where on the packages of cigarettes did that
11	first caution advise that cigarettes were addictive?
12	A. It didn't. It said that they were hazardous to
13	health, and it did not give any further information as
14	to how they were hazardous. That --
15	Q. And, in fact, it did not say they were hazardous
16	to health, did they, ma'am?
17	A. On the 1966 warning label, it said it may be
18	hazardous to your health.
19	Q. Right. Your testimony was they said it's
20	hazardous to your health. I just wanted to make sure it
21	is "may be hazardous to your health." Right?
22	A. That's right. That's -- that's correct.
23	Q. If the public had been aware since the 17th
24	century, according to your testimony, of the health risk
25	and addictive nature of smoking, why do you think
351
1	cautions were necessary in 1966?
2	A. Well, obviously some people thought they weren't
3	necessary. Daniel Horn said, "You could stand on top of
4	a building and shout it out at the top of your lungs,
5	and you wouldn't be telling something to anybody that
6	they didn't already know." But for whatever reason, the
7	federal government felt it was important to put it in
8	writing, just in the same way that nowadays you can find
9	it on a water bottle. I'm -- I'm holding up a water
10	bottle to say that that is the -- well, that's been a
11	change in our -- our notion of public responsibility.
12	Q. So other than Daniel Horn's statement that
13	you've identified, is there any other reason why the
14	public, if they had been aware since the 17th century of
15	the health risk and addictive nature of smoking, that
16	cautions were needed hundreds of years later on packs of
17	cigarettes?
18	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
19	THE WITNESS: It just has evolved that way over
20	time. I think that the -- the dangers were known. They
21	were widely known for centuries, as you said. And, you
22	know, Congress is the institution that it is. It passes
23	a lot of laws. And in this period of time in the 1960s,
24	we began to see a process as a result of consumer
25	advocates and others saying that things should have
352
1	warning labels on them. And -- and now we have them on
2	lots things.
3	It's not that people didn't know there were
4	hazards in life before 1966. But after 1966 they felt
5	it was important to print it on a variety of things,
6	beginning with cigarettes.
7	BY MR. KAISER:
8	Q. If the public had been aware since the 17th
9	century, as you testified, about the health risk and
10	addictive nature of smoking, why do you think it took so
11	long before cautions were ordered to be put on
12	cigarettes packages?
13	A. I --1 just don't know. This was -- you know,
14	this became kind of a snowball that started rolling,
15	and -- and they felt it was a good thing to do. There
16	had been thousands of studies. And I think Congress
17	wanted to do something, and -- and so they thought this
18	would be a good way to start what Luther Terry had
19	called remedial action.
20	Q. And according to your testimony, if it was so
21	well known for hundreds of years about the health risk
22	of smoking, did you see any actions where the tobacco
23	industry, and RJ. Reynolds in particular, voluntarily
24	put warnings on their cigarettes before they were
25	mandated the by Congress in 1966?
353
1	A. No. They did not put warnings on their -- on
2	their packages before the congressional mandate.
3	Q. Do you believe that the tobacco companies had
4	just as much access to public information about tobacco
5	and health as Mr. Ellsworth?
6	A. It seems to me they would have all the same
7	information as Mr. Ellsworth would have, any member of
8	the public would have.
9	Q. What role did tobacco companies play in the
10	wording on the caution that was placed on cigarettes
11	packs in 1966?
12	A. You know, all I know is what was reported in the
13	newspaper. And there was a lot of back and forth about
14	it. Different people wanted different things. It seems
15	to me that it was an open conversation in the Congress.
16	And that's -- that's about the most I can tell you about
17	it.
18	Q. You have showed us slides and you have testified
19	that it was well known years before 1966 that nicotine
20	was not only addictive, but it was an addictive
21	narcotic. Correct?
22	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
23	THE WITNESS: Well, I believe what I said was
24	that the schools characterized it that way. I didn't
25	see it characterized that way much -- much anywhere
354
1	else. But it was as a term of art in the schools.
2	BY MR. KAISER:
3	Q. Now, you had testified that the '64 Surgeon
4	General's report was fairly important and big news at
5	the time. Correct?
6	A. Yes. That's true.
7	Q. That the Surgeon General had determined that
8	there was a correlation between cigarettes and cancer in
9	man. Correct?
10	A. That's what the 1964 report said, as -- as well
11	as some of those earlier warnings that we discussed.
12	Q. And this was the Surgeon General going on
13	national television to advise the findings of his
14	committee was that there is a correlation between cancer
15	and smoking cigarettes. Correct?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. And can you think of any reason why that
18	information was not put on the cigarettes in 1966?
19	A. No. Maybe, perhaps, because there were a lot of
20	hazards. But all I know is that Congress decided on a
21	specific wording, and that's the wording that went on.
22	Q. Did Lyndon Johnson endorse the Surgeon General's
23	report after 1964, while he was President of the United
24	States?
25	A. I don't recall a specific endorsement. There's
355
1	a report by a government agency. I don't think
2	presidents generally go through and -- and endorse them.
3	Certainly it was under his -- on his watch. And he
4	himself, as I mentioned, had quit smoking. And then he
5	also signed into --
6	Q. Are you aware of the fact that Lyndon Johnson
7	continued to smoke until the day he died?
8	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
9	THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of that from his
10	biography. It's possible that he snuck cigarettes. I'm
11	not aware of that. He may have.
12	BY MR. KAISER:
13	Q. Did you ever come across any articles or
14	research that indicated Lyndon Baines Johnson continued
15	to smoke until he died of a heart attack in 1972?
16	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
17	THE WITNESS: No, I haven't read that.
18	BY MR. KAISER:
19	Q. Have you read in connection with your research
20	that John F. Kennedy smoked cigars and never wanted to
21	be photographed smoking cigars?
22	A. I haven't read that. I've actually seen
23	photographs of him with a cigar. So if he wanted that,
24	he didn't get his wish. But I'm not aware of that.
25	Q. Are you aware, in the history of the United
356
1	States, any single president that did not smoke?
2	A. Again, I haven't -- that's not been the focus of
3	my study, presidential biography and who was smokers and
4	who weren't. I imagine some were and some were not. I
5	just don't know.
6	Q. Have you done any research to see whether, in
7	fact, the cautions on the packs of cigarettes in 1966
8	were effective?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And what did your research find?
11	A. Well, I mean, it's -- it's hard to get a
12	one-to-one correlation, but certainly the FTC, for
13	example, said that they were having an effect. Eighteen
14	months after the first warning, a million and a half
15	people had quit. And the FTC put those two figures
16	together. They thought it wasn't enough. They want
17	more people to quit. But, yeah, I think there's --1
18	think it's a very reasonable deduction historically
19	that -- that all of the warnings, not just the warnings
20	on the package, and that cumulatively all of the
21	warnings did drive down the smoking rate, which has
22	dropped phenomenally.
23	Q. Have you done any research on the number of new
24	smokers that were starting each day after the cautions
25	were placed on the packages of cigarettes?
357
1	A. No.
2	Q. Do you agree that cigarette consumption did not
3	peak until the 1980s?
4	A. I just --1 don't know what you mean. The
5	percentage of smokers, the peak was 1954, according to
6	Gallup polls.
7	Q. Now I'm talking about according to not Gallup
8	polls. Do you agree that cigarette consumption did not
9	peak until the 1980s?
10	A. I have --
11	Q. Talking hard numbers.
12	A. Do you mean the amount as the -- as the
13	population grows, the amount of tobacco consumed grows?
14	That could be the case.
15	Q. Do you agree that tobacco companies --
16	A. Percentage of people has declined.
17	Q. -- continued to make record profits in the '60s,
18	'79s, and '80s through cigarette sales?
19	A. You know, again, that's just outside the scope
20	of my research. I —
21	Q. Do you believe that the cautions on the packs of
22	cigarettes accurately reflected the information about
23	the health risk of smoking that was available to the
24	public at the time and for hundreds of years before?
25	A. I have no professional expertise to offer on --
358
1	on that subject. My -- my subject is merely and is
2	exhaustively on the amount of information that was
3	presented to the public. The accuracy of the warning is
4	not --
5	Q. (Indiscernible) --
6	MR. DAVIS: Wait. Let's - y'all - y'all
7	are --
8	BY MR. KAISER:
9	Q. — Surgeon General has determined that cigarette
10	smoking is dangerous to your health.
11	MR. DAVIS: Yeah, urn-
12	BY MR. KAISER:
13	Q. Where on the packages of cigarettes was the
14	public advised how cigarettes were dangerous to health?
15	MR. DAVIS: Yeah, I think you've asked that
16	question. But let me go back.
17	Dr. Hoffman, were you finished with your prior
18	answer?
19	THE WITNESS: Gosh. I lost track now. I was
20	saying something, and I got interrupted.
21	MR. DAVIS: Okay. I'm sorry, Allan. Go ahead
22	and ask your question.
23	BY MR. KAISER:
24	Q. My question went to the '70 warnings. I've not
25	asked one question about 1070. My questions concerned
359
1	the cautions beginning in 1966 to 1970.
2	So I will start by asking, the 1970 warning
3	label which you have, I guess, shown today said,
4	"Warning: The Surgeon General has determined that
5	cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health." My
6	question is, where on the packages of cigarettes was the
7	public advised how cigarettes were dangerous to health
8	in 1970?
9	A. They weren't told "how." They were told "that."
10	Q. My question is, where on the packages of
11	cigarettes was the public advised that nicotine in
12	cigarettes was addictive?
13	A. As I answered, they weren't told that--
14	anything about nicotine or addiction on the pack. They
15	were simply told that smoking was hazardous. So it
16	appeared nowhere.
17	Q. You -- several moments ago you talked about the
18	FTC weighing in on the effectiveness on their warnings
19	in 1966. Correct?
20	A. I --1 think it was 1967.
21	Q. Correct. I'm talking about the warnings in
22	1966, the cautions?
23	A. Oh, yes. They --
24	Q. Weighing in on those cautions, the effectiveness
25	of the cautions in 1966?
1	A. In 1967 they weighed in on the cautions of 1966.
2	1967 they talked about 1966.
3	Q. You're familiar with the FTC report to Congress
4	on June 30th of 1967?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. You've used the FTC report in support of your
7	opinions at times, haven't you?
8	A. It has information in it that I've used. For
9	example, it's the only place I've come across which --
10	it gives the number that we've talked about a few times
11	of about 7 percent of television advertising being
12	for -- for cigarettes. So I have used parts of that.
13	Q. Let me -- on page 4 of the Federal Trade
14	Commission report of June 1967, it reads, under the
15	heading "The Effectiveness of Cigarette Labeling," This
16	warning, cigarettes -- this -- This warning statement
17	must be placed, quote, in a conspicuous place on every
18	cigarette package and appearing in conspicuous and
19	legible type in contrast by typography, layout, or color
20	with other printed matter on the package.
21	Do you agree that it was the cigarette companies
22	who determined where on the packs to put the warnings in
23	1966?
24	A. I don't know.
25	Q. Do you have any reason to disagree with the
1	statement I just read -- just read to you, that the
2	warning statement must be placed in a conspicuous place
3	on every cigarette package?
4	A. No.
5	Q. The FTC report also says, "There is virtually no
6	evidence that the warning statement on cigarette
7	packages has had any significant effect." Do you recall
8	seeing that in the 1967 FTC report?
9	A. I don't remember the specific line. But what I
10	do remember about that report is that it had a number of
11	what I thought were internal inconsistencies. Certainly
12	that would be inconsistent with other lines in that
13	report, where they -- they talked about the effect that
14	they were having. So they at times were talking about
15	that there wasn't enough effect. It wasn't significant.
16	Other times they were saying, Looky, a million and a
17	half people did quit. So that is also significant. So
18	I --1 do remember the report pretty -- pretty clearly.
19	Q. My reading of that sentence, "There is virtually
20	no evidence that the warning statement on cigarette
21	packages has had any significant effect," do you agree
22	or disagree with that statement by the FTC?
23	A. Oh, I absolutely disagree with it. And I think
24	that the evidence is right --
25	Q. Cigarette sales are viewed as an index of the
I	effectiveness --
2	A. I --1 think that the evidence is right there in
3	the report.
4	MR. DAVIS: Allan. Allan you -- y'all can't
5	talk over each other.
6	Go ahead. Finish up, Dr. Hoffman.
7	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. It's very hard.
8	I --1 disagree with that statement, and I think
9	that the -- that the evidence is right there in their
10	own report.
II	BY MR. KAISER:
12	Q. If the cigarettes sales are viewed as an index
13	of the effectiveness of the warning statement, one finds
14	that in 1966 more cigarettes were sold than ever before.
15	Even during January and February 1966, the first two
16	months that the warning appeared on cigarettes packages,
17	cigarette sales were higher than they had been during
18	the same months of the preceding year.
19	Do you agree or disagree with that statement in
20	the FTC report?
21	A. I don't have a basis for disagreeing with their
22	figures. This is, of course, a time of high
23	immigration, for example. So it doesn't explain the
24	figure, but there's no reason to think that the figure
25	is incorrect. I --1 don't know it, but I accept
363
1	that -- that they're giving a reasonable figure.
2	Q. The commission's evaluation of the
3	ineffectiveness of the warning statement on packages is
4	shared both by the scientists surveyed by the commission
5	and by the members of the public interviewed by the
6	public health survey.
7	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
8	A. You know, could I have a copy of that report?
9	Because, honestly, you're reading kind of long sentences
10	that I might just agree --1 might agree with part of it
11	and disagree with part of it.
12	There were scientists that were surveyed in that
13	report that, in fact, reports said there were only --
14	the report was based on three polls, which is a very
15	limited amount of information. And one of the groups of
16	poll -- people polled were -- as they said, were
17	actively engaged as activists on the issue. So their
18	opinions are kind of a biased source. So I'd have to
19	get the whole sentence right in front of me, I'm afraid,
20	Mr. Kaiser, to -- to give you my best opinion on it.
21	Q. In 1965 sales continued their upward swing by
22	jumping 16 billion. And in 1966 they reached a new
23	all-time high of 539 billion units.
24	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
25	A. I have no basis for agreeing or disagreeing.
364
1	It's -- it's outside the scope of my research to know
2	trade figures like that.
3	Q. Failure of the warning statement on packages to
4	have any discernable effect on cigarette consumption is
5	easily explainable. The warning statement on the
6	packages alone have proved to be ineffective, mainly
7	because few people seem to pay attention to it.
8	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
9	A. I --1 disagree with it very much.
10	Q. If the public is to be effectively warned of the
11	health hazards of cigarette smoking, the commission is
12	convinced that the present cautionary statement on
13	cigarette packages is not sufficient to accomplish the
14	result. The motivations for smoking -- physiologically,
15	psychologically, and sociologically -- are complex. And
16	a mere reminder of the hazards on the cigarette package
17	cannot compete with the forces that promote cigarette
18	smoking.
19	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
20	A. I disagree with parts of that statement,
21	certainly. The -- that information was really out
22	there. And, of course, it wasn't simply the label that
23	people were hearing when they heard cautions. They saw
24	the PSAs. They saw the newspaper articles. So if it
25	had been literally only the label alone that ever
365
1	cautioned anybody, then it would have been insufficient,
2	I would think. We wouldn't have had these high poll
3	numbers that we saw saying, yeah, I've heard about the
4	American Cancer Society report, and such things which
5	continued on over the years. So I--1 think that that
6	statement is misleading in the -- in that report.
7	Q. Because cigarette smoking is so strongly habit
8	forming, it is unlikely that a mildly phrased cautionary
9	statement will have any effect on confirmed cigarette
10	smokers.
11	Do you agree or disagree with that statement in
12	the FTC report?
13	A. I just don't have a basis for agreeing or
14	disagreeing. Certainly that was not the only caution,
15	so it's such a hypothetical statement, that it's hard to
16	evaluate. If that had been the only warning smokers had
17	every received in their whole life, might not have been
18	sufficient.
19	On the other hand, it was the Surgeon General of
20	the United States. I --1 --1 think a lot of people
21	did take that seriously. Half of all people who --
22	living people who ever smoked quit. So some people were
23	taking it very seriously. In fact, Mr. Ellsworth's
24	brother quit in 1980. Soldo think that people were --
25	were hearing it.
366
1	Q. Now, ma'am, respectfully, in answer to my
2	question, because cigarette smoking is so strongly habit
3	forming, it is unlikely that a mildly phrased cautionary
4	statement will have any effect on confirmed cigarette
5	smokers, do you agree or disagree with that statement,
6	ma'am?
7	A. It's, to me, a -- it's a preposterous statement,
8	so --
9	Q. Is that an answer that, no, you do not agree
10	with that, ma'am?
11	A. If that were true, then I could agree with it.
12	But it's not true.
13	Q. And is what you're saying, ma'am, in your
14	response to my question, no, you don't agree?
15	MR. DAVIS: Object to form. It's asked and
16	answered.
17	THE WITNESS: I don't agree that that -- people
18	only received a mild warning. And I cannot opine at all
19	on the -- how addiction works in -- in human
20	consciousness. It's outside my expertise.
21	BY MR. KAISER:
22	Q. Now, due in part to the cumulative effect of
23	cigarette advertising over the years, advertising that
24	shows cigarette smoking to be an enjoyable and
25	pleasurable activity and ignores the suffering and early
367
1	death that it causes, many youngsters consider cigarette
2	smoking to be an acceptable and socially desirable
3	activity.
4	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
5	A. There are several statements in there. Which
6	statement do you -- do young -- some young people see it
7	as a desirable activity? Apparently Mr. Ellsworth did.
8	He never -- and there was no testimony that he started
9	smoking because of advertising, nor any of his family
10	numbers who smoked testified to smoking because of
11	advertising. So I'm not sure which part of that
12	question is relevant to the case.
13	Q. Current cigarette advertising constitutes a
14	strong force in our society to persuade teenagers to
15	overcome their initial distaste for cigarettes.
16	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
17	A. I don't --1 don't agree with that statement.
18	Or I don't have any basis for really getting into that
19	statement. The -- the -- the testimony we have is that
20	none of the people said they smoked for that reason.
21	And also, again, that's really outside my scope.
22	Q. Expenditures on cigarette advertising and
23	promotions increased each year during the period 1963 to
24	1966, reaching nearly $300 million in 1966. More of
25	this money was spent on television than on all other
368
1	media combined.
2	Do you disagree or agree with that statement?
3	A. I don't have a basis for agreeing or
4	disagreeing, because I did not do research on budget
5	figures.
6	MR. DAVIS: Allan, can we take another
7	couple-minute break?
8	MR. KAISER: Yeah.
9	MR. DAVIS: Okay. All right. We'll do that.
10	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record, the time
11	is-
12	MR. KAISER: Can we make it five minutes this
13	time?
14	MR. DAVIS: Yes. We will make it five minutes
15	this time. Yes.
16	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record, the time is
17	6:33 p.m.
18	(Off record)
19	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the record.
20	The time is 6:40 p.m.
21	BY MR. KAISER:
22	Q. (Inaudible) again to the FTC report. During the
23	single month of January 1967, 87 network television
24	programs were sponsored in whole or in part by cigarette
25	products of the six major cigarette manufacturers.
369
1	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
2	A. I don't have --1 haven't done research which
3	would allow me to agree or disagree.
4	Q. Demographic data relating to 60 of the 87
5	programs was obtained for the week commencing January
6	11th, 1967. An estimated 1.1685 billion viewers watched
7	the 60 programs during the week commencing January 11th,
8	1967. In this context a person who watched ten of the
9	60 programs counts as ten viewers. This means that on
10	the average, each of the 197 million inhabitants of the
11	United States viewed 5.9 cigarette-sponsored programs
12	during the week in question.
13	Do you have any basis to agree or disagree with
14	that statement?
15	A. No, I don't.
16	Q. Hello?
17	A. No. I answered. No, I don't.
18	Q. Cigarette advertising reaches virtually all
19	Americans who can either read or understand the spoken
20	word.
21	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
22	A. I think that --1 think that all people would
23	have seen some advertising. So I --1 agree.
24	Q. (Indiscernible) cigarette advertising that it is
25	virtually impossible for Americans of almost any age to
370
1	avoid cigarette advertising.
2	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
3	A. That, I just don't have a basis for. They --
4	they said 7 percent, so 93 percent would have been for
5	something else. I can't evaluate that, other than to
6	say it was a minority.
7	Q. Thus teenage smoking appears to be widespread.
8	Youth are apparently smoking at ever earlier ages. And
9	everyone, particularly teenagers, is constantly exposed
10	to cigarette advertising.
11	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
12	A. They said "is constantly exposed"? I'm sorry.
13	I just don't --1 don't have the report in front of me.
14	If you plan to quote from it at length, perhaps I can
15	have a copy of it.
16	Q. Do you agree or disagree with the statement I
17	just read, ma'am?
18	A. Which -- I'm sorry. Would you read it again?
19	Q. Thus teenage smoking appears to be widespread.
20	Youth are apparently smoking at ever earlier ages. And
21	everyone, particularly teenagers, is constantly exposed
22	to cigarette advertising.
23	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
24	A. No. There -- there are three statements of fact
25	in there, which I'm unable to evaluate.
371
1	Q. Associating cigarette smoking with persons,
2	activities, places, and things likely to be admired,
3	respected, or emulated, endowing cigarette smoking with
4	a positive association image, continues unabated in
5	current advertising.
6	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
7	A. I think all advertisement was associated with
8	positive things. So, yes, I would agree with that. In
9	that --
10	Q. Outdoor activities --
11	MR. DAVIS: Wait a minute. She's not done.
12	She's -- Allan. Allan. Allan. Allan. Allan.
13	MR. KAISER: Yeah. Yeah.
14	MR. DAVIS: She's not -- she's not done. You --
15	we have to wait till she finishes. And I know there's
16	-
17	MR. KAISER: I'm not hearing anything. That's
18	why I went on.
19	THE WITNESS: So sorry. I - I'm - I'm doing
20	my very best.
21	I Was going to add that in that particular
22	report, as I recall it, they mention that the emphasis
23	for advertisements was always on taste, and so that was
24	the emphasis of their report. But certainly there was a
25	part of the report which talked about advertisements
372
1	always being associated with, you know, positive things.
2	So that --1 agree with that.
3	BY MR. KAISER:
4	Q. In fact, what you were alluding to, I believe,
5	ma'am, was portrayal of satisfaction, particularly oral
6	satisfaction, continues to be an important element of
7	cigarette advertising.
8	Is that what you were referring to?
9	A. No, I wasn't referring to that. Again, I don't
10	have the report in front of me, but as I recall, they
11	talked a lot about taste, that that was the emphasis of
12	advertisement, was on -- on taste.
13	Q. And let me read this again. Associating
14	cigarette smoking with persons, activities, places, and
15	things likely to be admired, respected, or emulated,
16	endowing cigarette smoking with a positive associated
17	image, continues unabated in current advertising.
18	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
19	A. Again, I didn't do a thorough analysis of
20	advertising in every ad, because my emphasis was on the
21	harms that were communicated. But certainly the ads
22	that I saw, from which I could use to agree or disagree,
23	showed cigarettes, and all products I saw, as being
24	associated with pleasant things. So that -- that makes
25	sense, although I haven't done research on it, per se.
373
1	Q. Outdoor activity of an athletic nature engaged
2	in by youthful, fit, and personable-appearing models
3	serves as a positive backdrop to many cigarette
4	advertisements. This activity also suggests that the
5	smoking depicted in the foreground, if not conducive to
6	rousingly good health, is certainly not incompatible
7	with it.
8	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
9	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
10	THE WITNESS: I think that they're just
11	describing -- and I would agree with the commonplace
12	thing, that advertisements are shown in positive
13	settings, and sometimes outdoors. Of course, again we
14	need to balance that against the fact that -- that
15	people were told all the time to be aware that
16	advertisements showed things that were -- positively
17	that could actually be harmful.
18	BY MR. KAISER:
19	Q. Did my question, reading from this report,
20	necessary entail an explication by you about what the
21	other information was?
22	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: I'm just trying to give you a
24	complete answer.
25
374
1	BY MR. KAISER:
2	Q. Well, I think my question called for a yes or
3	no, didn't it?
4	MR. DAVIS: Let's just ask the question, and
5	let's -- let's not argue back and forth.
6	BY MR. KAISER:
7	Q. In addition, social events abound in which the
8	viewer is brought into the wholesome, jolly company of
9	cigarette smokers.
10	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
11	A. I think that sometimes it was.
12	Q. After the Surgeon General's report was
13	published, cigarette clinics, some similar to Alcoholics
14	Anonymous, were formed throughout the country to help
15	people stop smoking, yet most of them have now been
16	dissolved because of the poor results.
17	Do you agree or disagree with that statement in
18	the FTC report?
19	A. I disagree with that statement.
20	Q. In terms of public understanding of the health
21	hazards, knowledge of this aspect of smoking is
22	essential.
23	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
24	A. I'm sorry. What's -- what's the "this aspect"
25	that -- in that sentence? I didn't understand the whole
375
1	sentence.
2	Q. In terms of public understanding of the health
3	hazards, knowledge of this aspect of smoking is
4	essential.
5	Do you agree or disagree with that?
6	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
7	THE WITNESS: I don't understand the reference
8	of the -- of the pronoun "this aspect."
9	BY MR. KAISER:
10	Q. The commission believes that the warning label
11	on cigarette packages has not succeeded in overcoming
12	the prevalent attitude towards cigarette smoking created
13	and maintained by the cigarette companies through their
14	advertisements, particularly the barrage of commercials
15	on television which portrays smoking as a harmless and
16	enjoyable social activity that is not habit forming and
17	involves no hazards to health.
18	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
19	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
20	THE WITNESS: I would - I would have to
21	agree -- disagree with that because it's the opposite of
22	what the Public Health Service was saying. The Federal
23	Trade Commission was, in fact, saying the opposite. But
24	I disagree with it.
25
376
1	BY MR. KAISER:
2	Q. Non-cigarette smokers, particularly the
3	teenagers who constitute an ever increasing class of
4	potential customers, seem in large part to have been
5	unaffected by the warning on the package alone. The
6	cigarettes advertisements, especially on television and
7	radio, that are more frequently viewed and heard by
8	teenagers than other segments of the population, have
9	been successful in their subtle but effective attempts
10	to persuade teenagers to smoke despite the known health
11	hazards. To protect this group, the commission feels it
12	imperative that adequate health warnings be included in
13	all cigarette advertising.
14	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
15	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
16	THE WITNESS: The last --1 disagree with it.
17	BY MR. KAISER:
18	Q. Cigarette commercials continue to appeal to
19	youth and continue to blot out any consciousness of the
20	health hazards. Cigarette advertisements continue to
21	appear on programs watched and heard repeatedly by
22	millions of teenagers.
23	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
24	A. Oh, I disagree with it very much. I don't think
25	it blotted out knowledge of the dangers at all.
377
1	Q. Today teenagers are constantly exposed to an
2	endless barrage of subtle messages that cigarette
3	smoking increases popularity, makes one more masculine
4	or attractive to the opposite sex, enhances one's poise.
5	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
6	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
7	THE WITNESS: I disagree.
8	BY MR. KAISER:
9	Q. To allow the American people, and especially
10	teenagers, the opportunity to make an informed and
11	deliberate choice of whether or not to start smoking,
12	they must be freed from constantly exposure to such
13	one-sided blandishments and told the whole story.
14	Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
15	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
16	THE WITNESS: I disagree that that's what was
17	occurring.
18	BY MR. KAISER:
19	Q. If "addiction" was a term that's used hundreds
20	of years ago that you've testified about, why did it
21	take until 1988 for that term to appear in the Surgeon
22	General's report?
23	A. That was a matter of medical debate as to what
24	the technical definition should be. So apparently it
25	was something that doctors and researchers, you know,
1	felt the need to hash out more. Again, that wasn't the
2	focus of my research, however, at all. I don't know why
3	it took them to 1988.
4	Certainly I saw in the records early on that the
5	Surgeon General's committee thought that "habit forming"
6	was a more accurate term in 1964.
7	Q. If there had been such widespread public
8	awareness that cigarette smoking was hazardous to health
9	and that nicotine was addictive, why was there such
10	widespread news coverage about the 1950 epidemiological
11	study?
12	A. Well, I think you're -- you're asking about two
13	different things. The 1954 study was about lung cancer,
14	not addiction. So some of that was newer information.
15	That's why there was widespread coverage of it.
16	Q. Well, I'm asking you. You've testified that
17	there was widespread public information for hundreds of
18	years about the hazards of tobacco, the scourge of
19	tobacco. And my question is, if that were the case, why
20	was there such widespread news coverage about the 1950
21	epidemiological study? Was it necessary?
22	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
23	THE WITNESS: Oh, well, the -- like many medical
24	problems, more information has come out over time that's
25	more and more specific as doctors learn all kinds of
1	things about different disease processes. So lung
2	cancer, as a particular harm of cigarettes, was
3	something that became well known, you know, as -- as we
4	just talked about, in the early 1950s, late '40s, early
5	1950s, partly because cigarettes weren't the most common
6	form of tobacco until roughly the 1920s or so. So
7	previous to that people smoked mostly pipes. So it's
8	just a matter of historical record. As some things
9	became more well known, they entered into public
10	conversation.
11	BY MR. KAISER:
12	Q. If there was such widespread public information
13	a hundred years ago about the health risk of smoking,
14	why do you believe that 50 percent of all doctors were
15	smoking in 1960?
16	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
17	THE WITNESS: Yeah, the - I - I can't really
18	answer that other than to say that the Surgeon General
19	in 1964 said that it was what they called the search for
20	contentment, that sometimes people wanted to do
21	something even if they knew it was harmful, that it was
22	pleasurable. And so --
23	BY MR. KAISER:
24	Q. If there was so much --
25	A. And so they did it --
1	Q. — public knowledge hundreds of years ago about
2	the harmful -- harmfulness of smoking and the addictive
3	nature of nicotine, why was it that John Kennedy first
4	formed a committee to investigate health claims in 1962?
5	MR. DAVIS: I don't think -- Allan, you're going
6	to have to wait for a second. She didn't finish her
7	prior answer.
8	MR. KAISER: You know, someone's got to speak up
9	because I didn't hear one thing, and that's why I'm
10	talking.
11	MR. DAVIS: Yeah, I --I did. I did speak up.
12	It's the fact that for some reason you didn't hear me,
13	and you kept going. So I don't know if that's just the
14	nature of the beast here with this phone that we're
15	dealing with or something else, but --
16	MR. KAISER: Well, it certainly is not me
17	ignoring you. I didn't hear anything.
18	MR. DAVIS: Yeah. I mean, so any -- so I
19	understand what you're saying.
20	So, Dr. Hoffman, do you want to finish your
21	prior answer?
22	THE WITNESS: I got halfway through the answer,
23	and I guess you heard the first half and didn't hear the
24	second. Honestly, I've now sort of lost track of the --
25	the second half of the answer.
381
I	You know, the -- the committee was formed by --
2	I'll -- I'll answer this question, if that's okay,
3	because now I'm on to a new question: Why did Kennedy
4	form it in 1962? Because medical information was
5	becoming more and more specific over time. There were
6	great advances in people understanding what types of
7	harms. And, of course, the type of harm changed as the
8	type of cigarette changed -- pardon me -- type of
9	smoking product changed. When people smoked pipes,
10	it -- there was -- people talked more about lip cancer
II	or throat cancer. But as the switch was made to
12	cigarettes in the early 20th century, lung cancer became
13	the big topic.
14	So Kennedy was being responsive, it seems to me,
15	to the studies that were coming out in the 1950s.
16	BY MR. KAISER:
17	Q. Are you aware that John Kennedy formed this
18	committee in 1962 because when he was asked in May of
19	1962 to render an opinion about the health risk of
20	smoking, he said, "I'm not informed" ?
21	A. I-
22	MR. DAVIS: Object to the -- let's keep --
23	THE WITNESS: I don't remember his specific
24	quote. I do remember that he said, I want more
25	information on it. And to have an official opinion of
382
1	the federal government, of course, is a different
2	matter. So that's why he formed the committee, I
3	suppose. But I --1 haven't, again, done deep research
4	into his biography about that.
5	BY MR. KAISER:
6	Q. If addiction and the health risk of cigarettes,
7	though, were so widely reported hundreds of years ago,
8	why do you think there was a Surgeon General's report
9	that was issued in 1964?
10	A. Well, they -- they were reported, and they were
11	known for hundreds of years. But every generation, you
12	know, adds information to the world. People keep
13	writing reports. Surgeon General has continued to write
14	reports even though there was a very comprehensive one
15	in 1964.
16	Q. If there was such widespread public information
17	about the health risk of smoking, why was there such
18	widespread news coverage about the '64 Surgeon General's
19	report?
20	A. Because it was a very important report.
21	Q. If there was such public information a hundred
22	years ago about the health risk of smoking, why were one
23	third of all doctors in the U.S. still smoking in 1970?
24	A. Again, I think I just answered that question. I
25	can't fully answer the question except to say that
383
1	people do do things they know are harmful, and -- and
2	doctors did too. Although it's also true that doctors
3	quit, in proportionately greater numbers than everybody
4	else. And in the state of Florida, it was widely
5	documented that they warned their patients. But in
6	their own behavior, some doctors did continue to do
7	risky things.
8	Q. If there was such widespread information a
9	hundred years ago about the health risk of smoking and
10	addictiveness of nicotine, why was there a need for
11	these public service announcements in the '70s and '80s
12	if everyone was already informed?
13	A. Well, the public service announcements were
14	attempt to persuade people to act on what they knew.
15	Q. Why did people have to be told to act on what
16	they knew if they already knew it?
17	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: Well, sometimes people know
19	things, and they don't act upon it.
20	BY MR. KAISER:
21	Q. If there was so much public information about
22	the health risk of smoking and the addictiveness of
23	nicotine, why was there a need for the Great American
24	Smokeouts in the 70s and the '80s if everyone already
25	knew?
384
1	A. Well, for the same reason. So some of the
2	deponents said they knew smoking was harmful when they
3	started, but they started anyway. And then public
4	health groups wanted to persuade them to stop. And so
5	that's why the Great American Smokeout started.
6	Q. If there was so much information about the
7	health risk of smoking hundreds of years ago, as you've
8	testified, why were cigarette sales continuing to rise
9	over the decades of the '50s, '60s, '70s, and '80s?
10	A. Well, smoking prevalence was going down, but the
11	population size was growing going up quite a bit. So
12	proportionately fewer -- fewer people were smoking, but
13	the overall amount of sales appears to have gone up for
14	the -- for that reason.
15	I'm sorry for just one moment. I just dropped
16	something. Hold on.
17	MR. DAVIS: Yes.
18	THE WITNESS: Sorry about that.
19	BY MR. KAISER:
20	Q. Do you believe there was enough information
21	about the health risk of smoking and addictive nature of
22	nicotine such that David Ellsworth's decision to start
23	smoking at 11 or 12 was an informed choice?
24	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
25	THE WITNESS: I don't know when David Ellsworth
385
I	started smoking, so I --1 can't comment on that and --
2	at all.
3	BY MR. KAISER:
4	Q. Have you looked at the medical records in this
5	case?
6	A. No.
7	Q. You've read the depositions in this case?
8	A. I've read the depositions of the family members
9	and -- and friends.
10	Q. Do you believe that at the time David Ellsworth
II	began smoking, he had more information than R.J.
12	Reynolds about the dangers of smoking?
13	A. I just don't know. I --1 do know that he had
14	information at his disposal, but I don't know that he
15	had more information or as much information.
16	Q. Do you believe that at the time David Ellsworth
17	began smoking, he had more information than RJ.
18	Reynolds about the addictive nature of nicotine in
19	cigarettes?
20	A. I don't think he would have. I think he was
21	expensed to the idea that it was habit forming. I don't
22	know what RJ. Reynolds knew. So again, I --1 can't --
23	I just can't offer you a professional opinion on that.
24	Q. When did R.J. Reynolds first learn that the
25	cigarettes they sold could be hazardous to health?
386
1	A. I don't know. I don't know about, again, their
2	internal deliberations. Think they would have known
3	around the time that everybody else did, which was very
4	early.
5	Q. When did R.J. Reynolds first learn that the
6	cigarettes they -- they sold could cause cancer?
7	A. I don't know.
8	Q. When was there a consensus in the scientific
9	community that cigarettes were dangerous to health?
10	A. I think that's a difficult question to answer.
11	Again, we saw the public opinion polls showing that
12	70 percent of the public thought they were harmful to
13	health in 1954. I don't see any reason to think that
14	doctors weren't a part of that general public.
15	Q. When did R.J. Reynolds first learn that nicotine
16	in cigarettes they sold was addictive?
17	A. Again, I can't answer any question related to
18	internal conversations.
19	Q. Can you identify the information about the
20	health risk of smoking that RJ. Reynolds disclosed to
21	the public in the 1940s?
22	A. I'm unaware of any disclosures at that time.
23	The warnings went on the packages much later, et cetera.
24	Q. That's why my question was related to the '40s.
25	A. No, there was no warnings on the packages.
387
1	Q. (Inaudible) information about the health risk of
2	smoking that R.J. Reynolds disclosed to the public in
3	the 1950s?
4	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
5	THE WITNESS: In the 1950s, I'm only aware of
6	the Frank Statement, which, of course, ran one day. But
7	they said that there was a -- there were questions about
8	the harmfulness of the product, which they didn't think
9	was harmful, but they did put in print that there were
10	people who believed it was.
11	BY MR. KAISER:
12	Q. Ma'am, my question was --
13	A. But there were no package --
14	Q. — identify the information about the health
15	risk that R.J. Reynolds disclosed. What was the
16	knowledge that they disclosed about their knowledge of
17	the harms? is what I'm asking.
18	A. I thought I answered that.
19	Q. Have you found any information in 1950s that R.
20	J. Reynolds admitted that their cigarettes were
21	dangerous to health?
22	A. In the 1950s, no.
23	Q. Did you find any public information that R.J.
24	Reynolds disclosed to the public in the 1960s that their
25	cigarettes were dangerous to health?
388
1	A. Well, in the 1960s we saw the warning label, so
2	that would have been in the '60s.
3	Q. And who mandated that they be disclosed,
4	Congress or R.J. Reynolds?
5	A. It was a congressional -- it was a -- it was a
6	law passed by Congress.
7	Q. Right. That was not R.J. Reynolds disclosing
8	information. They continued to deny that, didn't they?
9	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
10	THE WITNESS: I think that's mincing words.
11	They put it on their packages. It was -- it's a form of
12	disclosure that they -- they didn't say anything beyond
13	that that I'm aware of.
14	BY MR. KAISER:
15	Q. Did there appear any public information in the
16	'70s where R.J. Reynolds admitted that their products
17	were injurious to health?
18	A. Other than on the packages, that's all I'm aware
19	of.
20	Q. And again, did you see any information in the
21	'70s or at any time where R.J. Reynolds agreed with the
22	information that was on the packages?
23	A. I didn't see them comment on what was on their
24	packages, for the most part. It just was on the
25	package.
389
1	Q. Did you see any information in the public domain
2	in the 1980s where R.J. Reynolds admitted that their
3	cigarettes were dangerous to health?
4	A. No, not beyond the package.
5	Q. Did you see any information in the public domain
6	that R.J. Reynolds disclosed to the public or at any
7	time in the '90s that their product -- their cigarette
8	products, were dangerous to health?
9	A. Now, I've got to warn you here. I didn't go
10	past, really, 1994 since in this case that's when
11	Mr. Ellsworth passed away.
12	I think at some point in the late '90s, various
13	tobacco companies focused on harms and health and began
14	making Web sites to that effect. But I just really
15	can't answer that question.
16	Q. In 1963 did the Surgeon General have the
17	information about the health risk of smoking that R.J.
18	Reynolds had?
19	A. I don't --1 have not done research on what R.J.
20	Reynolds knew separately from everybody else. All I've
21	done research and I can tell you about is what the
22	Surgeon General knew, which was very extensive in 1963
23	and 1964; otherwise, they wouldn't have issued formal
24	warnings in 1955, '57, and '59.
25	Q. Did the Surgeon General have the information
390
1	about the addictive nature of nicotine that R.J.
2	Reynolds had?
3	A. I don't know.
4	Q. I'm not hearing anything.
5	A. Oh. I -- I'm sorry. I said, "I don't know."
6	I -- it's so odd because I use the same volume
7	for all questions. So I don't know why. I'm very
8	sorry. I guess the -- the phone line is picking things
9	up inconsistently.
10	Did you hear that?
11	Q. I heard that.
12	I'd like to go to your awareness slides, No. 74
13	and No. 75.
14	Are those in front of you?
15	A. Not yet. They're getting -- they're almost
16	there. Takes a while for the computer to catch up.
17	Okay. Yes, we're there now.
18	Q. Rhode Island bans smoking by minors in schools
19	taught about health hazards.
20	Do you have any information that Mr. Ellsworth,
21	that that caused him to be aware of the health risk of
22	smoking?
23	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
24	THE WITNESS: Other than that they taught it,
25	did he know it? One of the -- certainly Carole Maheu
391
1	said he -- she believes he knew it. I think his
2	youngest daughter also said that. But Rhode Island, all
3	I can attest is that Rhode Island put the information
4	out there.
5	BY MR. KAISER:
6	Q. And you have no evidence that Mr. Ellsworth was
7	taught one thing about smoking in the schools he
8	attended in Rhode Island, do you?
9	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
10	THE WITNESS: Honestly, I - I think that that
11	is good evidence, that the -- that it was in all the
12	textbooks that were, you know, the authorized textbooks.
13	I think that's reasonable --
14	BY MR. KAISER:
15	Q. Do you grade textbooks, or do you grad students?
16	A. I'm sorry. What?
17	Q. Do you grade textbooks, or do you grade
18	students?
19	A. I grade students.
20	Q. So are you aware of whether or not every single
21	word in a textbook is taught just by virtue of it being
22	in a textbook?
23	A. I know some students read every word, and I know
24	some students don't.
25	Q. Mr. Ellsworth's parents warned their son smoking
392
1	was bad for them. On how many occasions did you read in
2	depositions where his parents warned him that smoking
3	was bad?
4	A. I believe the question was asked once, and -- as
5	I recall, and that was the answer. Maybe it was asked
6	by -- asked of Donald and of Richard. I don't -- as I'm
7	remembering, I don't think Donald recalls his parents
8	doing that, and I think Richard did recall his parents
9	doing that.
10	Q. And do you recall also, according to Richard,
11	that he was allowed to smoke in the house, and his
12	parents did not say anything other than it smells bad?
13	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
14	THE WITNESS: As I recall, he said that after he
15	turned 16 and it was legal, that at that point he did
16	begin smoking in the house and that his parents didn't
17	like it. I just recall the phrase "didn't like it,"
18	that they didn't approve. But —
19	BY MR. KAISER:
20	Q. They allowed him to smoke in the house, didn't
21	they?
22	A. Yes, as a legal activity, they did.
23	Q. As a legal activity because he was now of age to
24	smoke cigarettes. Correct?
25	A. That's correct.
393
1	Q. And the fact that Mr. Ellsworth's brother Donald
2	knew smoking was hazardous since 1948 and never allowed
3	it in his home, are you suggesting that David would have
4	known as well because of what his brother knew?
5	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
6	THE WITNESS: My point there is, again, the --
7	my question was, what was -- information was available
8	to Donald -- pardon me -- David Ellsworth and his
9	generation? So I think that this goes to that question,
10	not necessarily that David did or did not but that
11	people in that generation, including his older brother,
12	did know.
13	BY MR. KAISER:
14	Q. Gilbert Stuart Junior High School health teacher
15	taught that smoking was bad for your health. That was
16	Richard saying that his health teacher said it was bad.
17	Correct?
18	A. Yes. That's a direct quote from Richard
19	Ellsworth.
20	Q. Did Richard Ellsworth ever say what "bad" meant,
21	other than it was bad?
22	A. No. He just --
23	Q. So bad-
24	A. He made -- he made the generic statement that it
25	was bad for you.
394
1	Q. Right, bad not meaning whether or -- that you
2	had to reach a certain age before you could smoke?
3	A. No, just bad for your health, period.
4	Q. '50s to the '60s -- from the '50s to the '90s,
5	Mr. Ellsworth subscribed to newspapers that covered the
6	risk of smoking, including lung cancer. And I think
7	you've answered it already. You have no evidence that
8	Mr. Ellsworth read one single article in any newspaper
9	about tobacco and health, do you?
10	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: Right. He may have subscribed to
12	the newspapers and never read them; although it's
13	unlikely because his -- his daughter, for example,
14	Sherri, said she recalls reading in those very same
15	newspapers in the family home articles when she was in
16	high school about the harms. So we don't have any
17	testimony from his that he read those articles, but we
18	do have testimony from his daughter that she read those
19	articles in the very same newspaper.
20	BY MR. KAISER:
21	Q. Mr. Ellsworth watched television news and kept
22	up on current events.
23	A. Yeah.
24	Q. What -- what children of his testified that he
25	kept up on current events?
395
1	A. I--okay. I'm just not remembering this, but I
2	think he was -- a couple of different people asked, you
3	know, was he a person who kept up on current events, and
4	I believe the answer to that was yes.
5	The impression of his personality that was given
6	was that he was a person very interested in the news,
7	very with it, we would say. He was a businessman and --
8	and very active, you know, out there in the world. So
9	that was the impression I got from the depositions.
10	Q. What does it mean that he was active out in the
11	world? Where--where was your information coming from?
12	A. Well, I was -- he was described as -- as very
13	successful in his occupation and a person who had a lot
14	of different kinds of jobs, meaning work sites,
15	residential and commercial. His acquaintance and
16	colleague Donald Rhoads described him as that. I think
17	his son Rickey, it was, said that -- that they had the
18	biggest plastering business possibly in DeLand. I'm not
19	as certain of that, but that was my impression.
20	Q. He was a plasterer, was he not?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. He went on jobs and plastered for a living,
23	didn't he?
24	A. Yes. He was a small business man.
25	Q. Sherri urged her father to quit in 1982. It's
1	not healthy. He smiled and walked back out.
2	You're quoting Carole Maheu, the
3	ex-daughter-in-law. Correct?
4	A. Yes. It was Carole Maheu who -- these are her
5	words.
6	Q. And that's Carole Maheu, the same person who
7	testified that she remembers seeing ads on television in
8	the late '70s. Correct? Do you remember that?
9	A. No, I --1 don't recall that.
10	Q. You don't remember that part in her deposition
11	when she was asked repeatedly on cross-examination about
12	her recollection, and she said she recalls seeing
13	television ads in the 1970s, the late 1970s? Do you
14	remember that?
15	A. She may have said that. I just don't remember
16	that.
17	Q. And then did you remember when was told, "They
18	went off the air in 1971," she said, "Well, maybe it was
19	cable"? Do you remember that Carole Maheu?
20	A. I remember Carole Maheu. I just don't recall
21	that --1 just don't recall that part of the
22	conversation.
23	Q. And then on the next slide, 75, "Around 1969 Mr.
24	Ellsworth caught his stepsons smoking and made them
25	smoke a cigar to deter them from taking up the habit."
1	Is there any evidence that that was
2	Mr. Ellsworth's purpose, to -- to deter them from taking
3	up the habit, or that they should wait until they become
4	of age?
5	A. Well, I --1 think that that's what they were
6	saying, that --1 think, again, it was Rickey who said
7	this, that -- and essentially they -- you know, they had
8	to smoke it, the presumption, the implication of that
9	was, until they were literally sick. He did not want
10	his stepsons smoking underage. He -- you know, he was
11	enforcing the law with them.
12	And my impression from that was that he -- he
13	wanted them to make their own choice but that they had
14	to follow the law until they were 16.
15	Q. And then when they became 16, was there any
16	testimony that Mr. Ellsworth ever said a word to them
17	about their cigarette smoking?
18	A. He only told them that they would have to buy
19	their own.
20	Q. Mr. Ellsworth's daughter-in-law Carole knew
21	smoking was harmful when she started and believes Mr.
22	Ellsworth understood that too.
23	And what was the basis under which she testified
24	that Mr. Ellsworth understood the dangers in her
25	deposition?
1	A. I'm sorry. I don't understand your wording of
2	that question.
3	Q. Well, my wording is this: What facts can you
4	point to in Carole Maheu's deposition that indicates she
5	had a good basis to be able to say Mr. Ellsworth
6	understood that smoking was harmful?
7	A. She -- she simply asserted it, that -- you know,
8	that they had smoked together. And she believed that.
9	So I'm -- I'm simply telling you what she --
10	Q. Believed that based on what of evidence?
11	A. I'm simply -- I'm sorry.
12	I'm simply telling you what Carole Maheu said.
13	Q. Well, you're telling us what she said. But
14	what's the factual basis in her deposition other than
15	she said "I'm guessing"? Do you remember that?
16	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
17	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. I just don't recall
18	the specific wording. She was indicating that this was
19	what she was calling something similar to common
20	knowledge, that she had seen articles and PSAs, as other
21	deponents, like Sherri Hubbird said that she had seen as
22	well. So it was, I think, on that basis that she was
23	saying she believed he understood it.
24	Also, Of course, she was -- she was a much --
25
399
1	BY MR. KAISER:
2	Q. So Carole Maheu saw and understood that
3	cigarettes were bad; she just generally believed that
4	everybody thought it was bad. Do you remember that
5	testimony?
6	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
7	THE WITNESS: Again, she might have said it that
8	way. She also talked about a conversation where they
9	were -- in the kitchen, that took place, where they were
10	all having this conversation in the presence of
11	Mr. Ellsworth. So I --1 think that there were some
12	events that had happened in her life that also led her
13	to believe that he knew. She was also younger quite a
14	bit than he was, so, you know, she must have thought
15	that he -- he knew more than she did in general.
16	BY MR. KAISER:
17	Q. Is there -- are you saying that there's
18	testimony in Carole Mayeu's deposition where they were
19	talking about the health risk of smoking?
20	A. I believe that there was a conversation in the
21	kitchen about smoking. And this is the same place, the
22	same time, where Sherri Hubbird was cautioning her dad
23	and -- about smoking, and Carole Maheu was present for
24	that conversation. So since he was being cautioned
25	about smoking in her presence, I think that this is one
400
1	of the reasons why she said she thought he knew. She
2	heard him being warned.
3	Q. You had mentioned the historical method earlier
4	in your testimony today. And is the historical methods
5	a specific and very rigorous method that historians all
6	use?
7	A. Yes. That's right.
8	Q. And historians will travel far and wide to get
9	information. Correct?
10	A. Generally speaking, yes. Good historians do.
11	Q. Might do a lot of primary research in archives
12	that could be located anywhere in the country?
13	A. Yes, they often do, not always but often.
14	Q. And you want to understand something in context.
15	If you take something out of context, you can really
16	misunderstand it. Correct?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. Who was the founder of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
19	Company?
20	A. I --1 don't know.
21	Q.	Who was the founder of American Tobacco Company?
22	A.	I think that might have been Duke. David Duke.
23	Q.	(Inaudible) the founder of the --
24	A.	Oh, Mr. Reynolds in the case of —
25	Q.	-- Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company?
401
1	MR. DAVIS: I'm sorry. Were you finished with
2	your answer?
3	THE WITNESS: Oh, I'm sure in the case of R.J.
4	Reynolds, I assume it was someone named R.J. Reynolds.
5	But again, I haven't done company histories.
6	BY MR. KAISER:
7	Q. Who was the founder of Brown & Williamson
8	Tobacco Company?
9	A. I don't know. I assume it was named for the
10	founders, but I don't know. I --1 didn't -- do no
11	research on the --on the early history of those
12	companies.
13	Q. When was R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company founded?
14	A. I don't know.
15	Q. When was American Tobacco Company founded?
16	A. I think American Tobacco Company was in the
17	1880s.
18	Q. When was the Brown & Williamson Company founded?
19	A. I don't know.
20	Q. In what year did R.J. Reynolds begin selling
21	cigarettes to the public?
22	A. Well, machine-rolled cigarettes weren't being
23	sold until after the 1880s, so it had to be sometime
24	after that.
25	Q. When was R.J. -- what was R.J. Reynolds' first
402
1	brand of cigarettes that was sold to the public?
2	A. Oh, I don't know.
3	Q. How did R.J. Reynolds and the other tobacco
4	companies decide to respond after meeting at the Plaza
5	Hotel on December 14th, 1953, to the public about the
6	information linking cigarettes to disease?
7	A. Well, as I understand -- again, I have not
8	looked at any internal company records as to what they
9	decided to do. I certainly know that they formed the
10	Tobacco Industry Research Committee, for example, which
11	they announced. That's -- that's about the extent of
12	what I know. And they hired a public relations firm.
13	Q. Did R.J. Reynolds and the other tobacco
14	companies, 20 years later, view their strategy as a
15	success?
16	A. I don't know. I did not look at their internal
17	documents.
18	Q. Are you aware that Fred Panzer, of the Tobacco
19	Institute, in 1972 said that the strategy was
20	brilliantly conceived and executed?
21	A. I've not looked at those documents. I don't
22	know.
23	Q. Now, you've testified and you've shown us slides
24	of Daniel Horn talking about you could stand on a
25	rooftop and shout, Smoking is dangerous, at the top of
403
1	your lungs, and you would not be telling anyone anything
2	that they did not already know. Correct?
3	A. Yes. That's what Mr. Horn -- Dr. Horn -- pardon
4	me -- said.
5	Q. And you testified about Dr. John Heller and what
6	he had to say. Correct?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. And you testified about what the Surgeon General
9	had to say about his position being that the -- the
10	public has been well informed. Correct?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. Don't you think in context, as you historians
13	are like -- are apt to do, that's it's important what
14	the tobacco industry thought about their success or
15	failure in their response to the information about the
16	risk of smoking?
17	A. No.
18	Q. Are you aware that Fred Panzer -- Fred Panzer
19	said their strategy was creating doubt about the health
20	charge about smoking?
21	A. No. I did not look at their internal documents.
22	Q. So you've never seen the document written by
23	Fred Panzer in 1972. Correct?
24	A. No, I have not. That's correct.
25	Q. But are you aware of a meeting held New York in
404
1	1978 with the tobacco companies, including
2	representatives from R.J. Reynolds, where Bill Shinn
3	described the TIRC as an industry shield?
4	A. No. That's completely outside the scope of my
5	research, so I did not look at that record.
6	Q. And in context, you would not want to know what
7	the tobacco company thought about their response to the
8	allegations about the risk of tobacco. Correct?
9	A. That's correct. No. I only wanted to know what
10	the public knew and was exposed to, not the tobacco
11	companies.
12	Q. (Inaudible) aware of a meeting held in New York
13	in 1978 with the tobacco companies, including
14	representatives from R.J. Reynolds, where Bill Shinn
15	described the CTR, the Council for Tobacco Research, as
16	a front?
17	A. I'm not aware of that meeting.
18	Q. Have you that document written in 1978 by R.B.
19	Seligman?
20	A. No. It was outside the scope of my research.
21	Q. Do you know who R.B. Seligman was?
22	A. No, I don't.
23	Q. Are you aware that in 1978 representatives from
24	Brown & Williamson, which became part of R.J. Reynolds,
25	believed that very few consumers were aware of the
405
1	addictive nature of nicotine?
2	A. No. I'm unaware that they thought that. It --
3	it's an odd thing. But certainly all the evidence was
4	against that. But they may have said that. I -- I'm
5	unaware of it.
6	Q. Did you ever so a 1978 memorandum from H.D.
7	Steel to M.J. McCue about consumer reaction to nicotine?
8	A. No. I did no research in those documents.
9	Q. Are you aware that the Tobacco Institute
10	representatives in 1980 wrote that they could not defend
11	continued smoking as free choice if the person was
12	addicted?
13	A. I didn't read that document.
14	Q. You've not seen that 1980 memo written by Mr.
15	Knopick?
16	A. No, no. I did not look at any internal company
17	documents, because they weren't at all related to my
18	research.
19	Q. And they weren't important for context as an
20	historian. Correct?
21	A. No, because they weren't in the context of the
22	question I had asked. So they weren't context --
23	Q. (Inaudible) Mr. Knopick was?
24	A. They were not context for this particular
25	research question. They would have been context for
406
1	something else but not this.
2	Q. Do you know who Mr. Knopick was?
3	A. No, I don't.
4	Q. Do you know who Timothy Hartnett was?
5	A. Yes. I --1 believe he was head of the TIRC.
6	Q. Did you ever see a tape of his appearance on
7	See it Now with Edward R. Murrow in 1954 when he denied
8	the risk associated with cigarettes?
9	A. You know, I just don't recall him being on that
10	show, on the Edward R. Murrow show. There was -- you
11	know, in the course of this long documentary, basically,
12	they did have industry comment. I just don't -- didn't
13	remember that Mr. Hartnett was one of them.
14	Q. You never researched the Tobacco Archives to see
15	how many appearances people like Mr. Hartnett made, or
16	other representatives of TRC made on TV in the '50s,
17	'60s, '70s, or '80s denying claims that cigarettes were
18	dangerous, did you?
19	A. No. I didn't need to.
20	Q. Familiar with Anne Browder?
21	A. I'm sorry?
22	Q. Are you familiar with Anne Browder?
23	A. No, not really. It sounds slightly familiar,
24	but I don't -- I'm not familiar with that person.
25	Q. Did you know that she was a representative of
407
1	the Tobacco Institute?
2	A. No. As I said, I'm -- I'm not familiar with
3	her.
4	Q. Did you ever see tapes of television appearances
5	by Anne Browder on behalf of the Tobacco Institute where
6	she denied that cigarettes cause cancer?
7	A. I may have seen those. I'm just not recalling
8	them or her by name.
9	Q. And you did not seek out any internal documents
10	from the tobacco companies to see how many television
11	appearances were made by Anne Browder on behalf of the
12	Tobacco Institute where she denied that cigarettes
13	caused cancer?
14	A. To -- to repeat, I did not look at any internal
15	documents.
16	Q. Are you familiar with Ed Horrigan?
17	A. No.
18	Q. Were you aware that he was a CEO at R.J.
19	Reynolds at one time?
20	A. No.
21	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Counsel, I need to take a
22	break to change the DVD.
23	MR. DAVIS: Did you hear that, Allan?
24	MR. KAISER: I have not heard anything.
25	MR. DAVIS: The videographer says that he needs
408
1	to change the DVD player.
2	MR. KAISER: Okay.
3	MR. DAVIS: Okay. So why don't we take a -- you
4	want to do a -- well, we've been going another hour, I
5	guess, so why don't we take a couple-minute break here.
6	MR. KAISER: All right.
7	MR. DAVIS: Let's go off the record.
8	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record, the time is
9	7:25. This concludes Media No. 5.
10	(Off record)
11	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the record.
12	The time is 7:33 p.m. This marks the beginning of Media
13	No. 6.
14	BY MR. KAISER:
15	Q. Did you know that Edward Horrigan was a CEO of
16	R.J. Reynolds at one time?
17	A. No.
18	Q. Have you ever seen tapes of Edward Horrigan on
19	Nightline in 1984, and other shows, speaking on behalf
20	of R.J. Reynolds, denying claims that cigarettes were
21	dangerous?
22	A. I may have. I don't remember that specific
23	show, but I certainly saw shows -- there were
24	occasionally shows where executives from the companies
25	were interviewed.
409
1	Q. And again, you never availed yourself of the
2	opportunity to search any tobacco archives to see
3	whether or not they had records of how many appearances
4	executives like Horrigan or others made on behalf of RJR
5	and other tobacco companies, denying that cigarettes
6	were dangerous, throughout the '50s, '60s, '70s and
7	'80s. Correct?
8	A. No. I --1 did not do any research in internal
9	archives, only in the public archives.
10	Q. So in terms of the available information,
11	including the tobacco documents, would you consider
12	those a primary source of information?
13	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
14	THE WITNESS: They were - this - the
15	information that's primary to my subject is the
16	information that was available to the public, because
17	that was may research question. So anything that wasn't
18	available to the public would not be a primary document
19	that would go to answer my question.
20	BY MR. KAISER:
21	Q. My question was, is the information that the
22	tobacco industry had about their conduct be considered a
23	primary source of information?
24	A. For another topic, yes. Not my topic.
25	Q. Not your topic.
410
1	And as you said, the historical question has to
2	be very carefully framed so you know exactly what you're
3	looking for. Right?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. And in this case your historical question was
6	what information the public was exposed to. Correct?
7	A. Yes, what information about the hazards of
8	smoking that David Ellsworth and the public in his
9	generation would have been exposed to.
10	Q. Correct. And so your historical question was
11	framed in a way that did not require you to look at any
12	internal company documents. Correct?
13	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
14	THE WITNESS: Well, exactly, because they would
15	not answer that question. So I --1 was only interested
16	in that particular question.
17	BY MR. KAISER:
18	Q. Exactly. And you weren't interested in that
19	particular answer, because now you can't answer
20	questions about the content of their internal documents
21	if you're asked about them, can you?
22	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
23	THE WITNESS: Oh, that's not at all the reason
24	why I didn't look at that. I didn't look at that,
25	because it's not relevant to understanding what
411
1	Mr. Ellsworth would have been exposed to. And that's --
2	BY MR. KAISER:
3	Q. And you didn't --
4	A. -- to me the important question here.
5	Q. — look at them, because you knew what
6	information was contained in them, and you knew you'd
7	have to answer hard questions about what the tobacco
8	companies knew, didn't you?
9	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
10	THE WITNESS: No. That's not true at all.
11	BY MR. KAISER:
12	Q. And, in fact, certainly the tobacco companies
13	never helped you frame the question, I'm sure. Correct?
14	A. No, they did not.
15	Q. This is all on your own. You framed this
16	without any input from the tobacco companies. Correct?
17	A. The only input was that they asked me to
18	undertake the research they wanted to -- not the
19	companies, of course, but the attorneys representing
20	them. But, no, it was absolutely my own design as a
21	question. That's what a professional historian does
22	every time we undertake a project. It was entirely my
23	own design.
24	Q. And because your question was designed in such a
25	narrow way, you don't have information about the tobacco
412
1	companies' conduct, do you?
2	A. It's not -- it's simply not relevant. It's a
3	totally different topic. So, yes, I don't need that
4	information, and it would be -- it would lead to gross
5	misinterpretations of -- of the question itself, of the
6	information that David Ellsworth and his generation was
7	exposed to. So I did not include it at all, for that
8	reason.
9	Q. Okay. So the answer --
10	A. It would have been improp— it --
11	Q. --to my question is no. Right?
12	A. Yeah. It's, no, I did not use that information.
13	It would have been improper.
14	Q. And you wouldn't have been able to answer any
15	questions about whether or not they concealed material
16	information from the public, like David Ellsworth.
17	Correct?
18	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
19	THE WITNESS: That's - I don't - I cannot
20	answer questions about their behavior. I can only
21	answer questions about the information that was widely
22	available.
23	BY MR. KAISER:
24	Q. And don't you see the importance at all about
25	having both sides of the equation so that one can
413
1	determine whether or not David Ellsworth made an
2	informed choice to smoke when he was 11 or 12 years old?
3	A. No. I do not agree with you at all.
4	Q. So all you need, according to your testimony, is
5	information about the health risk of smoking, and that's
6	it. Correct?
7	A. No. It's -- it's not that --1 don't need
8	information of the health risks of smoking. What I was
9	looking for was information about -- the information
10	that was presented to the public and to individuals like
11	David Ellsworth. So the information, if it was locked
12	away in a cabinet, that's not information I needed at
13	all. I just needed to know what the public was being
14	told about the hazards of smoking, which it's a
15	different thing.
16	Q. Can you identify any books you've read in the
17	last several years about the history of the tobacco
18	industry?
19	A. Oh, let's see. One of the recent ones was
20	called "The Cigarette Century." That was one of the
21	more recent ones I read.
22	Q. That's David -- that's Allan Brandt. Correct?
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. That was written in 2007. When did you read his
25	book?
1	A. 2007, 2008, somewhere there.
2	Q. Did you read Dr. Proctor's book that was written
3	in 2011 on tobacco and health?
4	A. No, I did not.
5	Q. I didn't hear the answer.
6	A. No, I did not.
7	Q. Did the tobacco companies ever tell you not to
8	read his book?
9	A. No.
10	Q. Did they tell you not to read his book, because
11	you'd have to answer questions about the tobacco
12	industry?
13	A. No. No one brought up his book to me.
14	Q. Did you read any of Dr. Proctor's papers on the
15	tobacco industry?
16	A. No. My -- my -- it's outside the scope of my
17	research.
18	Q. Have you read any of Dr. Proctor's other books,
19	where he talks about the tobacco industry?
20	A. No. I wasn't researching the industry, so I did
21	not read those books.
22	Q. And you don't think it's important to research
23	the industry in connection with the topic that you did
24	research. Correct?
25	A. No, I don't.
1	Q. Are you aware of any other researchers than
2	Allan Brandt and Robert Proctor who have researched the
3	topics as extensively as they have?
4	A. Oh, I --1 think there are a variety of
5	researchers -- researchers often will research a
6	different angle of something, so it's hard to put it as
7	much as in that kind of comparison that you did.
8	There's certainly been, not a lot, but there have been
9	other books on the subject that I'm aware of, and some
10	of them I've read.
11	Q. Can you identify any other researcher or
12	historian of science with as much knowledge of the
13	industry as Dr. Proctor?
14	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
15	THE WITNESS: I really can't comment on that,
16	because I haven't read his work.
17	BY MR. KAISER:
18	Q. Are you aware of the number of times
19	Dr. Proctor's book from 2011 has been cited by other
20	scholars?
21	A. No. I --1 haven't read his books, and I have
22	not looked at the citations.
23	Q. Is it correct that you have spent 13 years of
24	your life researching about the information that was
25	available to the public about the health risk of
1	smoking?
2	A. No. It's a greater number than that.
3	Q. Is it your testimony that you still maintain
4	that approximately 25 percent of your income is from the
5	tobacco industry?
6	A. It's varied over time. Over cumulatively at
7	some point, I figured out that it was about 25 percent.
8	It would vary from year to year.
9	Q. Have you spent thousands of hours researching
10	this topic that you have narrowly construed about the
11	public and the health risk of smoking that was available
12	to the public?
13	A. I don't consider that a narrow topic at all. I
14	don't -- wouldn't agree with that characterization of my
15	work as narrowly construed. It's actually quite a big
16	topic and requires a lot of serious research. So, yes,
17	I have been researching it for quite a long time.
18	Q. It was narrow enough such that you did not need
19	to consult with tobacco industry documents. Correct?
20	A. Yes. It did not -- it wasn't a subject that
21	included that.
22	Q. So it was not broad enough to include the
23	subject whereby you would feel the tobacco documents
24	were relevant to your research. Correct?
25	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
417
1	THE WITNESS: That's right. There are many
2	topics that it wasn't broad enough to include. That's
3	one of them.
4	BY MR. KAISER:
5	Q. Since 19 -- since 1999, when Mr. Schaller
6	contacted you about coming on board and working on
7	behalf of the tobacco companies, till today, you have
8	not written one book on tobacco and health and public
9	knowledge, have you?
10	A. I've never written a book solely on that
11	subject. And I --1 don't work for the tobacco
12	companies. I have been engaged by some attorneys who
13	work for the tobacco companies. But I'm not employed by
14	the tobacco companies at all.
15	What -- the kind of work I've done is of a more
16	of a general nature, so it's been incorporated in a
17	couple of textbooks. But I've not written a book, per
18	se, on that. I've--
19	Q. Well, let me ask the question again, and
20	maybe --
21	A. -- been involved in doing other --
22	Q. — I'll get a direct answer.
23	A. -- kinds of things.
24	Q. Have you not written any books on tobacco and
25	health and public knowledge since your research in this
418
1	area beginning in 1999?
2	A. I have written information that's included in
3	books. I have not written a whole book on that subject.
4	Q. That was my question. Have you written any
5	books on tobacco and health and public knowledge since
6	you have been researching in 1999?
7	A. No.
8	Q. Have you written any peer reviewed articles on
9	tobacco and health and public knowledge of the risk of
10	smoking since 1999?
11	A. No.
12	Q. Have you lectured to any professional
13	associations on tobacco and health and public knowledge
14	of the risk of tobacco use since 1999?
15	A. No. My written scholarship has been on other
16	subjects.
17	Q. Have you not lectured -- lectured to any public
18	health agencies on the subject of tobacco and health and
19	public knowledge of the risk of smoking since 1999?
20	A. No. There's no reason to.
21	Q. Have you taught any courses solely on the
22	history of the tobacco industry, including public
23	awareness of the health risk of smoking, since 1999?
24	A. No. There's no such course in my university.
25	Q. Have you ever applied for any fellowships
419
1	directed to any research projects on the issue of
2	tobacco and health and public knowledge of the health
3	risk of smoking since 1999?
4	A. No. My scholarship has been -- written
5	scholarship has been on other subjects.
6	Q. Have you served on any review committees where
7	you reviewed any articles on tobacco and health and
8	public knowledge of the risk of smoking since 1999?
9	A. No.
10	Q. Have you written any book reviews on books
11	dealing with tobacco and health and public knowledge of
12	the risk of smoking since 1999?
13	A. No.
14	Q. Have you received any honors or awards for your
15	work done on behalf of tobacco companies these last
16	years since 1999?
17	A. No. I've been engaged in other kinds of
18	scholarship which has won awards, but I've not written a
19	book on this. So the --
20	Q. My question did not concern --
21	A. So the answer is no.
22	Q. — any other activities in which you've won
23	awards. Mine was specifically directed to any awards or
24	honors for your work done on behalf of the tobacco
25	companies in the last 13 or 14 years.
420
1	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: Yes, and so I answered no.
3	BY MR. KAISER:
4	Q. Have you had -- the only information that you
5	have provided in the last 15 years about the public
6	knowledge of the health risk of smoking has been in
7	litigation. Correct?
8	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
9	THE WITNESS: No. That's not true.
10	BY MR. KAISER:
11	Q. The -- nowhere on your C.V., ma'am, do you
12	include your work on behalf of the tobacco companies
13	from 1999 to the present. Isn't that correct?
14	A. No. Like a number of activities that I do, it's
15	not on my C.V.
16	Q. I didn't ask about other activities. I'll ask
17	you the question again. Nowhere on your C.V. do you
18	include your work on behalf of the tobacco companies
19	from 1999 to the present. Correct?
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. On your C.V., ma'am, is there one word -- is
22	there one word about tobacco on your C.V.?
23	A. No.
24	MR. KAISER: Thank you, ma'am. I have no
25	further questions.
421
I	THE WITNESS: Thank you.
3	FURTHER EXAMINATION
4	BY MR. DAVIS:
5	Q. Dr. Hoffman, I'm going to ask you some follow-up
6	questions based upon some of the issues that Mr. Kaiser
7	raised with you.
8	For starters, would your C.V. be the place where
9	you would list your activities concerning anything
10	having to do with your litigation consulting?
II	A. No.
12	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
13	THE WITNESS: No.
14	BY MR. DAVIS:
15	Q. And -- and his anyone, any of the lawyers that
16	you've worked with that have represented a tobacco
17	company, tried to control the scope of your research for
18	the question that you investigated?
19	A. No.
20	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
21	THE WITNESS: No, and no one has ever attempted
22	told control the scope of my research in any way at any
23	time in the course of 15 years.
24	BY MR. DAVIS:
25	Q. Anyone -- anyone tell you what sources to use or
422
1	not use to investigate the question you researched for
2	this case or for other cases?
3	A. No. No one has ever --
4	MR. KAISER: Form.
5	THE WITNESS: -- suggested anything about the
6	things I could or could not use. I've always gone to
7	exactly what I thought was important to use to answer
8	the question.
9	BY MR. DAVIS:
10	Q. Has every historian in the United States
11	researched the issue of public awareness of risk of
12	smoking?
13	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
14	THE WITNESS: Has every historian researched
15	this question? Oh, no. No.
16	BY MR. DAVIS:
17	Q. Has every historian spent a thousand hours of
18	research hours investigating the issue of public
19	awareness of the risks of smoking?
20	A. No.
21	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
22	BY MR. DAVIS:
23	Q. When you approached the question that you
24	investigated for this case, and to offer your opinions
25	in this case, did you approach your research in any way
423
1	that's different than what you normally do when you are
2	researching outside of when you've been retained as an
3	expert?
4	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
5	THE WITNESS: No. I --1 used exactly the same
6	process that I've used for everything I've ever
7	researched. It's -- it's again -- it's a -- it's a
8	professional process, and what makes it effective is
9	that you use the same process every time, for every kind
10	of project.
11	BY MR. DAVIS:
12	Q. If I can go to Slide 52, please.
13	You were asked some questions about whether the
14	Reader's Digest articles were effective concerning
15	public awareness of the risks of smoking. During the
16	time period that the Reader's Digest articles were --
17	about the risks of smoking were published, what were
18	people, including public health authorities, saying
19	about the effectless of Reader Digest (sic) articles on
20	the public awareness of the risks of smoking?
21	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
22	THE WITNESS: The American Cancer Society was
23	probably the leading private agency on this topic. The
24	Surgeon General, of course, is a part of the U.S.
25	government. American Cancer Society was really the
424
1	voice of public -- pardon me -- private concern about
2	this. The American Cancer Society said that the
3	Reader's Digest had had a profound influence in creating
4	public awareness of the risks involved in smoking.
5	BY MR. DAVIS:
6	Q. And during the time -- did you see during your
7	investigation research anywhere where a public health
8	authority or medical organization said that the Reader's
9	Digest articles were not effective in raising public
10	awareness about the risks of smoking?
11	A. No.
12	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
13	THE WITNESS: No, not at all. There were -- you
14	know, there's nothing but praise for the Reader's
15	Digest, over a long period of time.
16	BY MR. DAVIS:
17	Q. If I can go to Slide 10 and 11, please.
18	You were asked questions about whether slides
19	showing some of the textbooks that were approved for use
20	in the -- in David Ellsworth's schools specifically
21	mention the word "narcotic" when referencing either
22	tobacco or -- or smoking -- cigarette smoking.
23	What's the audience for these textbooks that we
24	discussed? What's -- what's the audience?
25	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
425
1	THE WITNESS: Well, in this particular case the
2	audience are third graders. And so, of course, the
3	language is very -- is aimed at a third grade audience.
4	BY MR. DAVIS:
5	Q. If we go to Slide 11.
6	Is that true for the -- for the fourth -- the
7	fourth grade textbook that's reflected on Slide 11?
8	A. Yes. Fourth graders were -- you know, textbooks
9	were written for them, which were written in very simple
10	ways that would be understood by fourth graders.
11	Q. Based upon your review of historical records,
12	would you expect to see the use of the term "narcotic"
13	when -- for a textbook used by third graders or fourth
14	graders?
15	A. No, generally not.
16	MR. KAISER: Object to fomi.
17	THE WITNESS: I wouldn't expect to see that. It
18	was usually longer and more complex words, and concepts
19	like that were generally introduced in the sixth and
20	seventh and eight grades.
21	BY MR. DAVIS:
22	Q. In any of the depositions that you've read in
23	the case for the people who knew Mr. Ellsworth, did
24	anyone testify that smoking was not taught in the
25	schools that he attended in Providence, Rhode Island?
426
1	MR. KAISER: Object to fomi.
2	THE WITNESS: No one testified that it was not
3	taught, but his brothers did not remember it. Or at
4	least one brother remembered it, and one brother didn't
5	remember it, of course, but they didn't say, no, it was
6	definitely not taught.
7	BY MR. DAVIS:
8	Q. And what did David Ellsworth's family and the
9	people who knew him whose depositions you read say about
10	whether or not he read newspapers?
11	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
12	THE WITNESS: Well, repeatedly, a variety of
13	depositions, as well as information that was simply
14	provided in a -- to -- in a verified worksheet indicated
15	that he read the Miami Herald, he read the Orlando
16	Sentinel, and he read the local DeLand newspaper, which
17	is the DeLand Sun Times. So that was a very consistent
18	piece of testimony.
19	BY MR. DAVIS:
20	Q. And what did David Ellsworth's family and people
21	who were deposed in this case who knew him say about
22	whether or not he kept up with current events?
23	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
24	THE WITNESS: His family indicated that he kept
25	up with current events, that -- yeah, and he was
427
1	somebody who sat and read the newspaper, is what they
2	said.
3	BY MR. DAVIS:
4	Q. Based upon your review of the materials in this
5	case, including deposition testimony, do we have any
6	evidence that David Ellsworth missed school every time
7	that the risk of smoking was discussed?
8	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
9	THE WITNESS: No. Again, we don't have his
10	school records, but there's no indication that he was
11	a -- a poor student or a student who skipped a lot.
12	It -- it sounded like they -- he had very responsible
13	parents and that -- neither of his brothers said he was
14	a truant student. He did graduate.
15	BY MR. DAVIS:
16	Q. Do we have evidence from the materials you
17	reviewed for this case, including the depositions, that
18	David Ellsworth missed every article that appeared in
19	the newspaper that discussed the health risks of smoking
20	over a 40-year --
21	MR. KAISER: Form.
22	BY MR. DAVIS:
23	Q. — over a 40-year period?
24	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
25	THE WITNESS: No. There's nothing in the
428
1	depositions to suggest that.
2	BY MR. DAVIS:
3	Q. Do we have any evidence from the materials you
4	reviewed in the case, including the depositions, that
5	David Ellsworth missed every TV news show or news
6	program that discussed the dangers of smoking over a
7	40-year period?
8	MR. DAVIS: Object to form.
9	THE WITNESS: No. There's no indication
10	whatsoever that he missed all of those news programs.
11	BY MR. DAVIS:
12	Q. Do we have any evidence from the materials that
13	you reviewed in the case, including the depositions,
14	that David Ellsworth missed every use of a slang term in
15	pop culture for cigarettes over a 40-year period?
16	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
17	THE WITNESS: Oh, no. In fact, we do have the
18	opposite, which is the son testified using those terms
19	in his father's presence. So we certainly don't have
20	evidence that he missed all those references.
21	BY MR. DAVIS:
22	Q. Do we have any evidence from the materials that
23	you reviewed in this case, including the depositions,
24	that David Ellsworth missed every reference to the
25	dangers of smoking that were in movies or TV shows, such
429
1	as sitcoms?
2	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
3	THE WITNESS: No. There's no indication that
4	he -- that he missed that stuff.
5	BY MR. DAVIS:
6	Q. You -- you were asked some questions about a
7	1998 statement by someone at the -- at Gallup about a
8	poll that had been taken -- done previously by Gallup
9	polls in the 1950s. Do you remember that -- this --
10	those questions?
11	A. Yes, I do.
12	Q. Now, if we can go -- when the 1954 poll was
13	taken concerning the percentage of people that had heard
14	that smoking -- heard or read that smoking was connected
15	with lung cancer, and the figure was 90 percent, what
16	was George Gallup's reaction to that 90 percent
17	awareness number?
18	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
19	THE WITNESS: Well, I'm confusing a bit, 1954
20	and 1957. I think he was saying that the 1957 figure
21	was a phenomenal --
22	BY MR. DAVIS:
23	Q. Let me rephrase that, then.
24	A. -- number.
25	Q. Let me rephrase the question, then.
430
1	A. Sure.
2	Q. With respect to the -- the results of the 1957
3	poll --
4	A. Thank you.
5	Q. — that came out by the Gallup group, what was
6	George Gallup's reaction to that 1957 poll and the
7	awareness number that was reflected in it?
8	A. Well, I think he was flabbergasted, and that's
9	what -- he said that it was a phenomenal figure in the
10	annals of polling. So here's a man who had been doing
11	polling since the 1930s. And in the course of the 20
12	years of his professional experience as the leading
13	pollster in America, he was saying that this was
14	extraordinary that so many people had heard or read
15	about the American Cancer Society report. So, you know,
16	he at the time thought that was an amazing figure. And
17	as I said, he -- he brought it up. He mentioned the
18	comparison with the Kinsey Report, et cetera. And he
19	said, Wow, this thing on sex didn't get half the
20	attention that the report of the American Cancer Society
21	got.
22	Q. Do you base your answer that you just gave on
23	your view of the historical record?
24	A. Yes, entirely.
25	Q. And at any time of your review of the historical
431
1	record, did you see that George Gallup criticized either
2	the 1954 poll or the 1957 poll in any way?
3	MR. KAISER: Object -- object to form.
4	THE WITNESS: No. I assume he was very
5	confident about it. He kept asking similar questions
6	over a period of 40 or 50 years.
7	BY MR. DAVIS:
8	Q. You were asked some questions by plaintiffs
9	counsel about the wording of the 1966 and 1970 warnings
10	on cigarette labeling. I want to come back to that.
11	Even though there was no reference in the 1966
12	and the 1970 warnings that were on cigarette packaging
13	about how cigarettes may either be hazardous to your
14	health or dangerous to health, was there publicly
15	available information about how cigarettes may be
16	hazardous to yourself -- hazardous to your health or
17	were hazardous to your health or were dangerous?
18	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
19	THE WITNESS: Yes. There was -- there was an
20	astounding amount of information that people had about
21	the specific ways that they were harmful to health. You
22	saw on the newspaper articles and the public service
23	announcements and the advice columns on, you know, the
24	Surgeon Generals and the ACS posters that there were a
25	lot of very specific references to lung cancer, which,
1	of course, was the disease from which Mr. Ellsworth
2	suffered, lots of specific information on that, as well
3	as on other diseases. So -- and on the problem of
4	addiction. That was very -- very commonly brought up.
5	BY MR. DAVIS:
6	Q. That was going to be my next question. Even
7	though there's no reference to addiction in either the
8	1966 or the 1970 warnings on cigarette labeling, was
9	there publicly available information that discussed
10	that -- that nicotine in cigarettes was addictive or
11	habit forming?
12	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
13	THE WITNESS: Yes. That was discussed in
14	movies, on television, and just multiple ways. It
15	had -- as I said, the very first harm of tobacco that
16	was identified in print in the 15th century was the fact
17	that it was addictive or hard to quit, that it enslaved
18	you. And different generations used different terms,
19	but that's always been very well known.
20	BY MR. DAVIS:
21	Q. You were asked a number of questions about the
22	1967 FTC report, and specifically about advertising and
23	effect of advertising on teenagers.
24	How old was David Ellsworth in 1967?
25	A. Bom in 1934, in 1967, 34 years old --
I	Q. So at the of --
2	A. -33.
3	Q. At the time of the 1967 FTC report, was David
4	Ellsworth a teenager?
5	A. No.
6	Q. And as part of the issue that you researched in
7	this case, was your research on the question of the
8	history of any tobacco company or its founders?
9	A. No.
10	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
II	THE WITNESS: No. I did no research on the
12	history of any particular company and its founders. It
13	wasn't -- again, it wasn't within the scope of what I
14	was looking at.
15	BY MR. DAVIS:
16	Q. You were asked a number of questions about
17	whether or not certain events -- let me strike that.
18	You were asked certain questions about whether
19	we could put in David Ellsworth's hand any particular
20	newspaper article or TV show or sitcom or news program.
21	And my question to you is, irrespective of whether we
22	can do that or not, does that effect your opinions in
23	the case?
24	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
25	THE WITNESS: No. That does not affect my
1	opinion in any way.
2	BY MR. DAVIS:
3	Q. Why is that?
4	A. Because it's not possible to be in a society and
5	be surrounded by continuous warnings in publications and
6	in media that you yourself are personally consuming over
7	a period of many decades, meaning television and
8	newspapers, which he apparently was very engaged with,
9	and to have avoided all of this information, to have
10	gone to school, to have had children in school. His
11	children actually warned him and talked with him about
12	the issue. So, no, it doesn't affect my opinions at all
13	that I can't place a particular article or particular
14	textbook in his hands. It would defy imagination and
15	defy the historical record to come to that kind of
16	conclusion.
17	Q. All right. I'm going to ask you some questions
18	about what -- based upon your review of the information
19	specific to David Ellsworth, including the deposition
20	testimony and other materials that you reviewed
21	specifically for David Ellsworth. Is there any evidence
22	that Mr. Ellsworth relied upon any statement by R.J.
23	Reynolds or any other tobacco company in deciding to
24	start smoking or continuing to smoke?
25	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
435
1	THE WITNESS: No. There's no evidence to that
2	effect at all. In the depositions, repeated individuals
3	were asked if they had heard -- ever heard of Tobacco
4	Industry Research Council or that kind of thing, and
5	they had never heard of it, no -- not one person. So
6	there's no indication at all that David Ellsworth had
7	heard that and no one else around him had ever heard it.
8	BY MR. DAVIS:
9	Q. Did you see in any of the materials you reviewed
10	on David Ellsworth, including the depositions, that
11	David Ellsworth had relied upon any statement by the
12	Tobacco Institute or the Tobacco Industry Research
13	Committee or an advertising or public relations firm
14	hired by R.J. Reynolds or another tobacco company in
15	deciding to start smoking or continuing to smoke?
16	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
17	THE WITNESS: No. There's no evidence
18	whatsoever to that effect.
19	BY MR. DAVIS:
20	Q. In the materials you reviewed on David
21	Ellsworth, did you see any evidence that Mr. Ellsworth
22	relied upon or was influenced by any advertisement by a
23	tobacco company, whether that be on billboards or on
24	public transportation, in terms of his decision to smoke
25	or to continue to smoke?
436
1	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
2	THE WITNESS: No. There was no testimony or
3	evidence of any type to suggest that he relied on that
4	information to start smoking or continue.
5	BY MR. DAVIS:
6	Q. Did you see any evidence in the materials you
7	reviewed on David Ellsworth that Mr. Ellsworth relied
8	upon or was influenced in any way by movie stars or
9	actors or athletes in deciding to start to -- start
10	smoking or to continue to smoke?
11	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
12	THE WITNESS: No. There were no references
13	whatsoever that would have suggested that.
14	BY MR. DAVIS:
15	Q. In any of the evidence you reviewed on
16	Mr. Ellsworth, did you see any evidence that -- strike
17	that.
18	In any materials that you reviewed about
19	Mr. Ellsworth, did you see any evidence that he relied
20	upon or was influenced by doctors who smoked in deciding
21	to start smoking or to continue to smoke?
22	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
23	THE WITNESS: No, no. There was no evidence at
24	all to that effect. He was -- people testified that he
25	was a very independent-minded sort of person. So there
437
1	was no evidence whatsoever to that effect and no other
2	evidence to the contrary.
3	BY MR. DAVIS:
4	Q. Based upon your review of newspapers, magazines,
5	TVs for the research you did in this case, where
6	cigarettes the only product that used movie stars,
7	actors, or athletes to market their product in the 1930s
8	to --
9	A. In the --
10	Q. -- to --
11	MR. KAISER: Object to form, beyond the scope.
12	BY MR. DAVIS:
13	Q. -- to the 1930s through the time period that
14	there was -- that -- that Mr. Ellsworth was alive?
15	MR. KAISER: Object to form. Beyond the scope.
16	THE WITNESS: Yes, there were -- as I said, as I
17	saw cigarette ads, I certainly saw some of them used
18	exactly what you're describing, and other ads did as
19	well. That was actually very common to use celebrity
20	endorsements. I saw a number of them.
21	BY MR. DAVIS:
22	Q. And what are the examples of other products that
23	used movie stars, radio stars, or athletes to market
24	their products --
25	MR. KAISER: Object to form.
438
1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. -- in the --in the time period that
3	Mr. Ellsworth was alive?
4	A. Well, gosh, I'm drawing this off the top, but I
5	remember Snoopy, the Charles Schulz Peanuts character,
6	was used, I think for insurance. Also -- oh, actually I
7	remember coming across Arnold Palmer, who was a golfer,
8	test -- using celebrity endorsements for -- for slacks.
9	Of course, you know, athletes often endorse tennis shoes
10	and shirts and things like that.
11	Also there was celebrity endorsement of
12	antismoking, which is a related topic, but it's not what
13	you were saying. It's -- it's the -- it's the opposite.
14	Mickey Mantle, for example, appeared in ads for --
15	against smoking. So I saw celebrity endorsements in a
16	variety of settings.
17	Q. And, again, with respect to the opinions that
18	you've expressed here today in response to my questions,
19	do you hold them to a reasonable degree of professional
20	certainty in your field as an historian?
21	A. Yes. These are very consistent with the
22	historical method. I'm very confident that the research
23	absolutely upholds these conclusions.
24	MR. DAVIS: Thank you very much.
25	Allan, are we finished?
439
1	MR. KAISER: God, I hope so.
2	MR. DAVIS: God, yes. I agree.
3	Okay. We'll --1 need to be on the written
4	record here but off the video.
5	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Okay. Off the video record,
6	the time is 8:07. The number of DVDs used was six.
7	(Off the video record)
8	MR. DAVIS: Yeah, Allan, what I -- what I plan
9	on doing is going ahead and providing the court reporter
10	just hard copies of the -- of the exhibit used, or we
11	can just use them off the exhibit list. I would prefer
12	to do the latter, simply because, you know, for purposes
13	of trial so we don't have to kill a bunch of trees.
14	MR. KAISER: Whatever you want to do is fine.
15	MR. DAVIS: Okay. Then I'll -- then I'll end up
16	doing that. I'll just use the -- what we'll use up at
17	trial is -- is just right off the exhibit list based
18	upon the exhibit numbers that I read off and that are on
19	the slides themselves.
20	MR. KAISER: Okay.
21	MR. DAVIS: Okay. Thanks a bunch.
22	THE REPORTER: I need to know if the witness
23	will be reading and signing?
24	MR. DAVIS: Yes.
25	(The deposition was concluded at 8:08 p.m.)
