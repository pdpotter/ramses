1	(The deposition of Louis Kyriakoudes, Ph.D.,
2	continued as follows:)
3	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: And we are on the record.
4	CONTINUED CROSS-EXAMINATION
5	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
6	Q. Good morning, Dr. Kyriakoudes.
7	A. Good morning.
8	Q. Yesterday, we broke for the evening, and now
9	we're resuming here in the morning, correct?
10	A. That's right.
11	Q. Did you -- just a couple of questions.
12	Did you -- did you review any of your former
13	testimony last evening?
14	A. No, I didn't review any of my prior
15	testimony.
16	Q. Did you look at any documents that might be
17	relevant to the subject matters of your testimony over
18	the evening?
19	A. I did review documents, yes.
20	Q. Okay. And tell me, were there any particular
21	documents that you reviewed over the evening?
22	A. Yeah. I went through the documents that you
23	had identified as cross-examination documents.
24	Q. All right. And those had been provided to
25	you by Mr. Acosta, correct?
0240
1	A. Right, yes.
2	Q. And did you -- but did you have any other
3	documents besides those?
4	A. No. I was tired, and I went to sleep. I
5	didn't --
6	Q. Did -
7	A. -- spend much time with that.
8	Q. Did you have any meetings with Mr. Acosta or
9	any other attorney about your testimony last night?
10	A. No.
11	Q. Okay. Did you do anything else to prepare
12	for this morning's examination other than what you have
13	already told me?
14	A. No. That's the only thing I did.
15	Q. Okay. Now, when we -- when we left off
16	yesterday evening, we were talking about your testimony
17	in a case called Boemer, remember?
18	A. That's correct.
19	Q. And I promised you that I would give you some
20	of that testimony so it would hopefully refresh your
21	recollection of whether you had addressed in that case,
22	the Boemer case, several years ago, some of the same
23	issues you discussed yesterday with Mr. Acosta.
24	Do you recall those questions?
25	A. Yes. And thank you for -- for providing me
0241
1	with that.
2	Q. All right. I'm going to hand you a copy of
3	the -- this is the transcript from the trial. And I
4	want to specifically refer you to page 871. And I'm
5	not going to ask you to read it out loud. I just want
6	you to, if you could, read page 871, line 12, and then
7	I would keep reading page 872 until the end of that
8	long -- you give an answer there that ends on page 873
9	at line 5.
10	And my question simply is -- I'm going to ask
11	you if that -- if that refreshes your recollection, so
12	just take your time and read it to yourself.
13	A. Okay. And just one clarification. You had
14	been asking me about the deposition yesterday.
15	Q. That's right. That's right.
16	A. Okay.
17	Q. You gave a deposition a little bit earlier,
18	but this is your trial testimony.
19	A. Yeah. Okay.
20	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
21	(A pause was had in the proceedings.)
22	THE WITNESS: Yes. Okay.
23	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
24	Q. Okay. Now, having read that page and a half,
25	or so, of testimony, does that refresh your
0242
1	recollection that at the trial in the Boemer case you
2	addressed many of the same issues that you discussed
3	yesterday with Mr. Acosta?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Okay. And, in fact, in the answer you read,
6	you made references to the "See It Now" program, which
7	you showed a clip from yesterday, right?
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. And you mentioned Timothy Hartnett, correct?
10	A. That's correct.
11	Q. And Clarence Cook Little, right?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. And you also mentioned the "Face the Nation"
14	clip, which you and Mr. Acosta showed yesterday,
15	correct?
16	A. That's correct, yes. But just to clarify,
17	you know, you were asking me about the deposition
18	yesterday and --
19	Q. And you're right. I did ask you about the
20	deposition. And my point was, though, these -- these
21	opinions you were -- you offered these opinions in
22	response to questions that the defense lawyer asked you
23	during your deposition, which was taken a couple of
24	years earlier, correct?
25	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form. Move to strike.
0243
1	THE WITNESS: Yeah. In 2000, so three years
2	earlier, yeah.
3	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
4	Q. And I have the deposition here. I haven't
5	pulled it out. But at some point during the break,
6	I'll be happy to show that to you --
7	A. Okay.
8	Q. -- if you want to look at that to confirm
9	that. But will you trust me that you discussed these
10	same issues during your deposition as well in this
11	case?
12	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
13	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
14	Q. I will tell you what, during the break --1
15	will withdraw the question. If you want to look at it
16	during a break, I will show it to you during the break.
17	A. But I'm happy to talk about this.
18	Q. Okay. I want you to just take a quick look
19	before we move on at -- if you look at page 870, line
20	15 -- read page 870, lines 15 through 19. That's the
21	page above where I had asked you to read earlier.
22	A. Where Mr. Holt asked me if I'd read Parrish's
23	materials.
24	Q. Yes. And just read that to yourself, and
25	then I have a question for you.
0244
1	A. Okay.
2	Q. Okay. And, yesterday, I asked you a
3	question, if you had read the deposition of the defense
4	historian. And at first you said that you thought you
5	had. Mr. Acosta objected. But here is my question:
6	Reading that passage now confirms that you did, in
7	fact, review the deposition of the defense historian
8	when you were first retained in the Boerner case,
9	correct?
10	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form. Move to strike.
11	THE WITNESS: Yes, yes. That was part of the
12	materials that I was given to review.
13	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
14	Q. Right. You testified in the Boerner trial
15	that that was one of the original materials that you
16	had been provided by Mr. Schultz, correct?
17	A. Correct.
18	Q. Okay. And the only point I was trying to
19	make with these questions, Doctor, is simply that the
20	opinions you expressed yesterday in response to
21	Mr. Acosta's questions are, essentially, the same
22	opinions you offered in this Boerner case when you
23	testified at the trial five, six years ago, correct?
24	MR. ACOSTA: Object to the form. Move to
25	strike.
0245
1	THE WITNESS: Yes. The Boemer trial
2	opinions, yes, the same.
3	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
4	Q. Okay. Now, one of the lawyers that you
5	worked with on this Boerner case was a lawyer we talked
6	about briefly yesterday named Woody Wilner, correct?
7	A. Yes, he was involved in that case.
8	Q. Okay. And Mr. Wilner worked to prepare you
9	for the trial testimony in the Boemer case, correct?
10	A. Well, we had a meeting before the trial,
11	yeah.
12	Q. You had several meetings with Mr. Wilner,
13	correct?
14	A. Yeah, that's right.
15	Q. And Mr. Wilner and Mr. Acosta were working
16	together with you, were they not, on a couple of cases
17	that they had, right?
18	A. In other cases, yeah. Mr. Acosta wasn't
19	involved in the Boemer trial.
20	Q. But Mr. Acosta and Mr. Wilner worked with you
21	in advance of your testimony in the Boemer case and in
22	advance of testimony you gave in one of Mr. Acosta's
23	cases called Eastman, right?
24	A. That's correct.
25	Q. All right. Now, yesterday we were talking
0246
1	about that tobacco products liability conference
2	seminar that you attended, right?
3	A. That's right.
4	Q. And where you gave a presentation to a group
5	of plaintiff lawyers, correct?
6	A. And other people, yes.
7	Q. Okay. Now, Mr. Wilner gave a presentation at
8	that case, did he not?
9	A. He -- I'm sure he did. I didn't attend that
10	presentation.
11	Q. But you -- you know that Mr. Wilner talked
12	about your testimony in the Boerner case during his
13	presentation, correct? We talked about this in the
14	past, right?
15	A. I guess so, yes, yeah.
16	Q. Okay. And --
17	MR. ACOSTA: Move to strike.
18	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
19	Q. And Mr. Wilner said that -- let me rephrase
20	that.
21	Mr. Wilner said that we have worked with
22	Dr. Kyriakoudes for over a year now, right? Did he not
23	say that?
24	MR. ACOSTA: Object to fomi.
25	THE WITNESS: I didn't attend Woody's talk; I
0247
1	only attended my talk.
2	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
3	Q. Well, let me just show you, to refresh your
4	recollection of this, what we'll mark as Defense
5	Exhibit No. 4.
6	MR. ACOSTA: I need to object, as he didn't
7	indicate his recollection needed refreshing.
8	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay.
9	MR. ACOSTA: I object to form.
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Well, he's got the document if
11	he needs it to refresh his recollection.
12	(Defendant Exhibit 4 was marked for
13	identification.)
14	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
15	Q. And what I have handed you as Defense Exhibit
16	4 is an excerpt from written materials that were handed
17	out, and those written materials were the presentations
18	given by lawyers and experts and other people who
19	attended the seminar, correct?
20	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
21	THE WITNESS: That's -- that's correct, yes.
22	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
23	Q. Okay. So when you attended this conference
24	in 2003 with these plaintiffs lawyers, you were
25	provided with a set of the written materials that were
0248
1	the presentation materials of all the other presenters
2	in addition to your own presentation, correct?
3	A. Well, as I've testified --1 recall our
4	testimony about this at a previous situation. And what
5	I pointed out then was that they did have notebooks. I
6	didn't bring the notebook --1 didn't, you know, take a
7	notebook or bring one with me, because it didn't seem
8	to have anything that I would want, and I would have to
9	carry around a heavy notebook. They later mailed it to
10	me, and I think --1 believe I delivered it unopened to
11	a deposition.
12	Q. You were --
13	A. In fact, I know I delivered it unopened to a
14	deposition.
15	Q. Doctor, you were handed these materials, were
16	you not --
17	MR. ACOSTA: Object to-
18	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
19	Q. -- during a presentation?
20	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
21	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
22	Q. That's my only question.
23	A. No, I wasn't handed these materials during my
24	presentation.
25	Q. How did you get the materials, then?
0249
1	A. They were mailed to my home.
2	Q. Okay. By the organizers of the conference?
3	A. Yes.
4	MR. ACOSTA: Object to the form.
5	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
6	Q. Okay. If you look at page 358 of the
7	materials that I have provided you, in his
8	presentation, Mr. Wilner said -- and I'm reading from
9	the second block paragraph, the line that begins with
10	"we." We have worked with him -- referring to you,
11	Dr. Kyriakoudes -- for over a year now. Correct?
12	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
13	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
14	Q. Isn't that what it says?
15	A. Yes -
16	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
17	THE WITNESS: - that's what it says.
18	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
19	Q. Okay. And then the next sentence, Mr. Wilner
20	says, Louis is fantastic, and the jury loves him.
21	Correct?
22	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
23	THE WITNESS: That's what it says.
24	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
25	Q. Isn't that what it says?
0250
1	A. (Indicates affirmatively).
2	Q. And then if you drop down to the third
3	sentence from the bottom, Mr. Wilner writes, the jury
4	loves it, and it takes the script right out from the
5	defense historian's nose, correct?
6	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
7	THE WITNESS: Yes.
8	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
9	Q. Did I read that correctly?
10	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
11	THE WITNESS: Yes.
12	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
13	Q. And that's what Mr. Wilner said at that
14	seminar about you and your testimony from the Boerner
15	case, correct?
16	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
17	THE WITNESS: I can't answer that question,
18	because I did not attend Mr. Wilner's
19	presentation. I didn't write this. This is
20	Mr. Wilner's writings. He did not review this
21	with me, you know, so this is -- really,
22	Mr. Wilner is who you need to ask about this. But
23	this was included in the conference materials,
24	that is true.
25	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
0251
1	Q. You don't deny that that's what Mr. Wilner
2	said about you and your testimony from the Boerner
3	case, do you?
4	MR. ACOSTA: And I need to move to strike the
5	portion of his answer that was unresponsive.
6	THE WITNESS: I don't deny that he wrote
7	this, but I -- because I wasn't there to hear him
8	say it, I can't say what he said.
9	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
10	Q. Okay. Now, before you ever testified in that
11	Boemer case, Mr. Wilner himself had provided you with
12	four CDs of material, did he not?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. Okay. And among the four CDs of materials he
15	provided you were thousands of documents, correct?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. Okay. And among the documents he provided
18	you were documents from The Tobacco Institute, correct?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. From the Tobacco Industry Research Committee,
21	correct?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. And from other cigarette companies, right?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. Okay. You had many, many pages of documents
0252
1	from those organizations, which you talked about
2	yesterday, among the CDs that Mr. Wilner gave you;
3	isn't that right?
4	A. That's right.
5	Q. And so now, if I'm not correct -- we have
6	three instances in which you have relied upon materials
7	that have been selected for you by plaintiffs -- excuse
8	me, counsel, lawyers who file lawsuits on behalf of
9	plaintiffs; is that not correct?
10	MR. ACOSTA: Object to fomi.
11	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
12	Q. Yes?
13	MR. ACOSTA: Object to fomi.
14	THE WITNESS: Yes. I mean, the documents are
15	the documents. They say what they say.
16	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
17	Q. Okay. All right. So that's Mr. Wilner,
18	Mr. Fondren, and Mr. Schultze, correct?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Doctor, let's talk about -- you covered a
21	wide array of subjects yesterday. Let's talk about,
22	you know, your training, your background and the areas
23	of your expertise.
24	We talked yesterday -- you're not a medical
25	doctor, right?
0253
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. Okay. You don't have any medical training of
3	any kind, correct?
4	A. No.
5	Q. And I think we established in temis of the
6	hard sciences, in temis of any real science background,
7	like biology, chemistry, you have no degree in any of
8	those subjects, correct?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. And, in fact, you have no training in any of
11	those subjects; is that correct?
12	A. Not beyond what a normal college-educated
13	person has.
14	Q. And you're not here to offer a medical
15	opinion or an opinion about any scientific matter that
16	deals with smoking and health; isn't that correct?
17	A. I'm not here to offer any medical opinions.
18	Q. Okay. You're not qualified, for example, to
19	render any opinion in the field of biology, right?
20	A. I'm not offering opinions in biology.
21	Q. Or chemistry?
22	A. Same, chemistry.
23	Q. Okay. Now, also, you're not qualified to
24	render an opinion on the state of the art of the
25	medical or scientific literature, are you?
0254
1	A. No, I don't render opinions on that.
2	Q. Okay. What we mean by that is the accuracy
3	of any statement made about an issue of medicine or
4	science, correct?
5	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
6	THE WITNESS: Yes. As - I mean, I
7	understand "state of the art" to mean, you know,
8	what, you know, the community of professionals
9	held as the current cutting edge consensus as to
10	what they know to be true in their particular
11	subfield of research. But I don't offer opinions
12	in that.
13	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
14	Q. Okay. And if I were to pick any period of
15	time from the fifties, the sixties, the seventies, you
16	wouldn't be qualified to comment on the state of the
17	art of the medical or scientific research that existed
18	at that point in time, would you?
19	A. That's right. And I wouldn't offer that
20	opinion.
21	Q. And you specifically are not an expert on the
22	state of the art as to the medical or scientific
23	connection between cigarette smoking and lung cancer at
24	any point in time, correct?
25	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
0255
1	THE WITNESS: In terms of the state of the
2	art, no, I don't --1 don't work in that area.
3	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
4	Q. Okay. And you've pointed out in your past
5	testimony that there is a distinction between what is
6	reported in the popular press about these issues of
7	smoking and health and what might be said by a doctor
8	or scientist about these particular issues in a medical
9	journal, right? You've discussed that distinction with
10	other lawyers in the past?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. Okay. And you are -- when you gave testimony
13	yesterday, you were talking about the former statements
14	that appeared in the popular press, correct?
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. You weren't intending to offer any opinions
17	about medical or scientific opinions by scientists or
18	doctors, correct?
19	A. In terms of the state of the art, no, I
20	wasn't offering anything like that.
21	Q. Right. And as a result of all that, you
22	cannot give an opinion as to whether anything that any
23	one of the cigarette companies said or anybody from The
24	Tobacco Institute or the TIRC said was or was not
25	correct from a medical or scientific point of view;
0256
1	isn't that true?
2	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
3	THE WITNESS: That's correct. I didn't make
4	any representation either way on that --
5	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
6	Q. Okay.
7	A. -- yesterday.
8	Q. So it -- just so we're clear, if the jury for
9	some reason thought that's what you were doing
10	yesterday, you were not doing that, right?
11	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
12	THE WITNESS: Yeah, that's correct.
13	MR. ACOSTA: Move to strike.
14	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
15	Q. Okay. Now, yesterday, you -- Mr. Acosta
16	handed you several large, thick volumes of cigarette
17	ads that were from different periods of time, correct?
18	A. That's correct.
19	Q. Okay. And you talked about cigarette
20	advertising for some period of time yesterday, correct?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And how cigarettes have been marketed over
23	time?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. The truth is, though, you're not an expert in
0257
1	the field of marketing, are you?
2	A. I don't currently practice marketing as a
3	profession, no. I teach the history of advertising as
4	part of my work at the university.
5	Q. Okay. My question is, you're not an expert
6	in the field of marketing, correct?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. All right. You do not have a degree in
9	marketing, right?
10	A. No degree in marketing.
11	Q. And, in fact, you've never taken any courses
12	in marketing, have you?
13	A. No.
14	Q. Okay. And the same is true with advertising
15	or communications, right? You have no degree in
16	advertising, correct?
17	A. No. I don't have a degree in advertising; I
18	have --
19	Q. You have --
20	A. -- a degree in history.
21	Q. You have no degree in communications?
22	A. No, no degree in communications.
23	Q. And you haven't taken any coursework, college
24	level coursework, in either advertising or
25	communications, correct?
0258
1	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
2	THE WITNESS: Well, college level coursework
3	in communications, yes; advertising, no. I worked
4	in the advertising industry briefly.
5	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
6	Q. Doctor, isn't it true that you haven't taken
7	any courses in advertising, marketing, or
8	communications?
9	A. Well, you asked about college. Maybe what
10	you're really meaning is graduate professional
11	training, and I haven't taken any in my professional
12	training.
13	Q. Have you taken any college courses in
14	advertising, marketing, or communications?
15	A. Communications, yes, as an undergraduate.
16	Q. An undergraduate college course, one?
17	A. I took speech. I took the rhetoric of --1
18	took two communications courses. They were part of my,
19	you know, my curriculum.
20	Q. Okay. All right. Just so we are clear:
21	You've taken one college course in communications,
22	speech, right?
23	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
24	THE WITNESS: Two undergraduate courses.
25	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
0259
1	Q. Two undergraduate courses in speech, but
2	you've taken no courses of any kind in either
3	advertising or marketing; is that correct?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. Okay. And you've never developed an
6	advertising or marketing plan on behalf of a company,
7	have you?
8	A. Except to the extent that when I worked for
9	an advertising vendor.
10	Q. Doctor, you had one job in advertising; isn't
11	that right?
12	A. Yeah.
13	Q. And the job was selling advertising space,
14	correct?
15	A. That's right. We were a vendor.
16	Q. Okay. So you weren't -- you weren't creating
17	the advertisements yourself; isn't that --
18	A. No, not the way an advertising agency would.
19	Q. Okay. So my question is you've never
20	developed an advertising or marketing plan on behalf of
21	a company, have you?
22	A. No, no, not the way -- you put it that way.
23	Q. Now, yesterday, you talked about cigarette
24	sales and whether they went up or down in response to
25	certain events. But the truth is, you have never
0260
1	evaluated the success or failure of an advertising
2	campaign in your career, have you?
3	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
4	THE WITNESS: Of a particular campaign, no.
5	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
6	Q. Okay. And, in fact, you would agree that you
7	would not be qualified to evaluate the success or
8	failure of either a marketing campaign or an
9	advertising campaign, right?
10	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
11	THE WITNESS: Yeah. I don't do contemporary
12	evaluations of those. I do, you know, look at
13	the, you know, business history of the cigarette
14	industry, and talking about total cigarette sales
15	in the United States is perfectly within the
16	purview of my work.
17	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
18	Q. Doctor, my question is you agree that you're
19	not qualified to evaluate the success or failure of
20	either a marketing campaign or an advertising campaign,
21	correct?
22	MR. ACOSTA: Object to the form. Asked and
23	answered.
24	THE WITNESS: Right. I don't do that kind of
25	work.
0261
1	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
2	Q. That's all I'm trying to establish.
3	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form. Move to strike.
4	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
5	Q. Now, in addition, you've never studied the
6	issue of why people begin to smoke or why they may
7	choose to continue to smoke; isn't that true?
8	A. Well, I have read a great deal in that,
9	particularly as a historical phenomenon, and I have
10	studied the history of that.
11	Q. Doctor, isn't it true that you've -- you're
12	not an expert in the issue of why people begin to smoke
13	or why they choose to continue to smoke?
14	A. For contemporary smoking initiation and
15	quitting and those kinds of things, no, I don't --1
16	don't work in that area. But as a historical
17	phenomenon, I do study why groups of people begin
18	smoking. I mean, that's a lifestyle-dependent
19	behavior -- I'm sorry, I meant to say
20	life-course-dependent behavior.
21	Q. Doctor, I'm going to hand you a copy of your
22	testimony from a case called Arnitz. You testified as
23	an expert for the plaintiff in the Arnitz case,
24	correct?
25	A. That's right.
0262
1	Q. Okay. And you testified in October of 2004,
2	right?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And you were under oath?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. You swore to tell the truth?
7	A. As I always do.
8	Q. Okay. Let me ask you to refer to page 1682
9	of the trial transcript.
10	A. I'm getting there.
11	MR. ACOSTA: I need to object to the form of
12	this line of questioning.
13	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
14	Q. Now, Doctor, on October the 11th, 2004, you
15	were under oath, and you were asked the following
16	question and gave the following answer, reading from
17	line 3 on page 1682.
18	QUESTION: Doctor, my question is you've
19	never studied the issue of why people begin to smoke or
20	why they may choose to continue to smoke; isn't that
21	the case?
22	ANSWER: I am not an expert in that, just the
23	history.
24	That was the question and the answer you gave
25	on October the 11th, 2004, correct?
0263
1	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
2	THE WITNESS: And that's the answer I'm
3	giving you now.
4	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
5	Q. You're not an expert on the subject of why
6	people begin to smoke or why they choose to continue to
7	smoke, correct?
8	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
9	THE WITNESS: Correct, except as a historical
10	phenomenon.
11	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
12	Q. Okay. And you haven't engaged in any kind
13	of -- well, let me back up. You know that there are
14	people who actually write on this subject, correct?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. And there are people who are experts on this
17	subject, right?
18	A. Yes. Pharmacologists, addiction specialists,
19	that practice that now, yes. All I'm saying --1 don't
20	think I'm -- you know, all I'm saying is I studied it
21	as a historical phenomenon --
22	Q. Okay.
23	A. -- just the history of it.
24	Q. My question is, simply, you're not one of
25	those people who has made it their work to study and
0264
1	write about this particular issue, correct?
2	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
3	THE WITNESS: As a contemporary phenomenon,
4	no, that's not me --
5	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
6	Q. Okay.
7	A. -- just the history.
8	Q. And you haven't engaged in any kind of
9	systematic, thorough, or comprehensive review of the
10	literature that addresses this issue, correct?
11	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
12	THE WITNESS: Well, I mean, I have read a lot
13	in smoking initiation. It does inform my work. I
14	have read the work of Jack Henningfield. I have
15	read the surgeon general's reports on this. So
16	I've read -- I've read the stuff. I have read a
17	lot of that.
18	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
19	Q. Doctor, take a look at the same page of your
20	trial testimony from the Amitz case beginning at page
21	1682. On October the 11th, 2004, you were asked the
22	following question and gave the following answer.
23	QUESTION: And you haven't engaged in any
24	kind of thorough, comprehensive, or systematic review
25	of that literature, have you?
0265
1	ANSWER: I'm not an expert in smoking
2	initiation, and the subject didn't come up until now in
3	my testimony.
4	Those were the question and answer that you
5	gave in October of 2004, correct?
6	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
7	THE WITNESS: That's correct.
8	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
9	Q. All right. So for that reason, you wouldn't
10	consider yourself to be an expert on whether
11	advertising influences people to begin smoking
12	cigarettes, correct?
13	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
14	THE WITNESS: Well, I mean, my opinion is
15	that in toto, advertising does have a critical
16	role. What I don't have an expertise in is
17	evaluating whether particular advertising has a
18	particular effect. And the marketing people do do
19	that, and I don't do that.
20	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
21	Q. Okay. Doctor, let's take a look, again, at
22	the transcript from the Arnitz case. On October 11th,
23	2004, page 1682, beginning at line 21, you were asked
24	the following question and gave the following answer.
25	QUESTION: And for that reason, you wouldn't
0266
1	consider yourself to be an expert on whether
2	advertising can help influence people to begin smoking,
3	correct?
4	ANSWER: Yeah. I don't really deal with
5	smoking initiation as they call it in the field.
6	That was the question and the answer that you
7	gave back in October of 2004 under oath, correct?
8	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
9	THE WITNESS: Yeah, that's right. And what
10	you're referring to there is you're not talking
11	about the history; you're talking about
12	contemporary evaluations of these. And I don't do
13	that.
14	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
15	Q. Doctor, the question made no distinction
16	between contemporary and history, did it?
17	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
18	THE WITNESS: Throughout this line of
19	questioning, I have been qualifying, both on this
20	testimony and now, is as a historical phenomenon I
21	do study it but not as a contemporary phenomenon.
22	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
23	Q. Doctor, you aren't qualified to talk about
24	whether advertisements encourage people to start
25	smoking; isn't that true?
0267
1	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
2	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
3	Q. Yes or no?
4	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
5	THE WITNESS: As I said earlier, just a
6	minute ago, I mean, you can -- if you could read
7	the answer that I gave a minute ago about
8	particular advertisements. Would you read that
9	back into the record?
10	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
11	Q. Doctor, are you or are you not qualified to
12	talk about whether advertisements get people to start
13	smoking, yes, or no?
14	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
15	THE WITNESS: As a contemporary phenomenon, I
16	don't do that area. That's not my area of
17	expertise, but I study the history of advertising
18	as part of my research into this subject.
19	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
20	Q. I'm going to show you other trial testimony
21	that you've given in a case called Beckum?
22	A. As I said in the Arnitz, just the history of
23	it.
24	Q. Doctor, I haven't asked you a question yet.
25	A. Well, I'm explaining my answer.
0268
1	Q. You testified on the Beckum case on April the
2	25th, 2005, correct? See the front page?
3	A. Yes, that's right. Yes.
4	Q. And you were under oath, were you not?
5	A. I was.
6	Q. You swore to tell the truth, correct?
7	A. As I always do.
8	Q. Okay. And if you will, look at page 17 --
9	1775, beginning at line 8.
10	QUESTION: So the answer to my question is,
11	yes, you are not qualified to talk about whether
12	advertisements get people to start smoking, correct?
13	ANSWER: Right. Nor do I make that claim,
14	you know. That's an area that I don't go into.
15	That was the question and the answer that you
16	gave in the Beckum trial back in 2005, correct?
17	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
18	THE WITNESS: I didn't-
19	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
20	Q. Yes or no?
21	A. I didn't hear you --
22	Q. I need an answer to my question.
23	A. I didn't hear you when you said what page. I
24	missed --
25	Q. I'm sorry. I'll do it -- we'll do it all
0269
1	over again.
2	A. No. You can just -- what page?
3	Q. 1775.
4	A. Oh, okay. Here we go. I was just --
5	Q. Okay.
6	A. -- trailing behind.
7	Q. I'm sorry. I want to make sure you're with
8	me.
9	A. Uh-huh (Indicates affirmatively).
10	Q. I want you to confirm that I read it
11	accurately. 1775, beginning at line 8.
12	QUESTION: So the answer to my question is,
13	yes, you are not qualified to talk about whether
14	advertisements get people to start smoking, correct?
15	ANSWER: Right. Nor do I make that claim,
16	you know. That's an area that I don't go into.
17	That was the question and the answer that you
18	gave back on April the 25th of 2005, right?
19	MR. ACOSTA: I invoke the rule of
20	completeness and ask you to read the answer
21	starting at line 3 as well. And I object to the
22	form of the question.
23	MR. GERAGHTY: We have already gone over
24	that, but if you want, I will be happy to read it.
25	THE WITNESS: Line 3 on page 1775, it says --
0270
1	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
2	Q. Yeah. I'll read it to you.
3	A. Well, I can read it.
4	Q. No. I'll read it. Mr. Acosta asked me to
5	read it, so we will begin -- move to 1774, line 24.
6	Sir, you're not an expert on whether ads have
7	any influence on whether people start smoking, correct?
8	You leave that to the marketing experts, don't you?
9	ANSWER: I don't know if marketing experts
10	really have the expertise for that either. I look at
11	advertisements the way historians use advertisements,
12	which is examples and also causes, things that shape
13	but also mirror public attitudes, beliefs, perceptions.
14	QUESTION: So the answer to my question is,
15	yes, you are not qualified to talk about whether
16	advertisements get people to start smoking, correct?
17	ANSWER: Right. Nor do I make that claim,
18	you know. That's an area that I don't go into.
19	Those are the questions and the answers you
20	gave, correct?
21	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
22	THE WITNESS: That's correct. And I stand by
23	that. I mean, that's exactly how I use
24	advertising, as an -- the history of it.
25	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
0271
1	Q. And you said nobody would ever hire you to
2	put together a marketing program or an advertising
3	program for a company, correct?
4	A. I don't do that.
5	Q. Right. And the only job you ever had, which
6	you mentioned a moment ago, was selling advertising
7	space, correct?
8	A. That's right.
9	Q. You were a salesman, right?
10	A. That's right.
11	Q. Now, yesterday, you talked about changes that
12	had been made to certain cigarettes over time.
13	Do you recall talking about that?
14	A. Yes. Changes in the cigarette market, yes.
15	Q. You talked about filter cigarettes, low tar
16	cigarettes, and light cigarettes, correct?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. Now, the truth is you don't hold yourself out
19	as an expert in smoking behavior, do you?
20	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
21	THE WITNESS: I'm not sure what you mean by
22	"smoking behavior."
23	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
24	Q. Doctor, do you hold yourself out as an expert
25	in smoking behavior?
0272
1	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
2	THE WITNESS: No. I only study the history
3	of this, you know.
4	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
5	Q. Okay.
6	A. Everything you're throwing at me are things
7	that contemporary public health practitioners are
8	involved in, and I don't do any of that.
9	Q. Doctor, I asked you that very same question
10	in your deposition just two months ago in November, and
11	you understood what I said when I asked you about
12	smoking behavior, didn't you?
13	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
14	THE WITNESS: I don't do contemporary smoking
15	behavior, but I do study how groups of people may
16	have smoked or not. For example, smoking behavior
17	includes how many people smoked over time, which
18	groups tended to smoke more or less. Maybe this
19	is a lack of precision in the language.
20	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
21	Q. Well, you understand -- you've been deposed
22	many times, correct?
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. And at the beginning of the deposition, you
25	walk through the ground rules of a deposition, do you
0273
1	not?
2	A. I'm talking about now, your lack of precision
3	now.
4	Q. Doctor, my question is when you give a
5	deposition in a case, the lawyer reminds you about what
6	the ground rules are, correct?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. And one of the ground rules is, very simply,
9	if you don't understand a question, you tell the lawyer
10	you don't understand the question, and the lawyers will
11	rephrase the question for you, correct?
12	A. Correct.
13	Q. Doctor, my question simply is, you don't hold
14	yourself out as an expert in smoking behavior, correct?
15	A. Not -- not in the way that the public health
16	practitioners do it today of individual, you know,
17	diagnoses and, you know, helping people quit, things
18	like that. No, I don't do any of that.
19	Q. All right. And you're not an expert in
20	cigarette design, are you?
21	A. Not an expert in cigarette design.
22	Q. And you're not an expert in how the
23	cigarettes are made or designed, correct?
24	A. No, I'm not an expert.
25	Q. You know there are people who study that
0274
1	issue, right?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. They spend their entire lives studying that
4	particular issue, correct?
5	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
6	THE WITNESS: That's not my field.
7	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
8	Q. Right. You're not one of the persons that
9	spends their life studying that particular issue,
10	correct?
11	A. That's not my field.
12	Q. Okay.
13	(Brief discussion off the record.)
14	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
15	Q. All right. Let's -- let's shift gears for a
16	second, Doctor.
17	Let's talk a little bit about what you know
18	about the particular facts of the smoker or smokers in
19	this case. All right?
20	You don't know the name of a smoker or the
21	names of the smokers in this case, do you?
22	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
23	THE WITNESS: Well, this is a generic
24	deposition, so, no, I don't know the names of the
25	particular plaintiffs.
0275
1	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
2	Q. Right. As you sit here today, you don't know
3	the name of the smoker or the names of the smokers in
4	this particular case, do you?
5	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
6	THE WITNESS: That's correct. This is a
7	generic deposition.
8	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
9	Q. All right. Move to strike the last response.
10	You haven't read the complaint or the
11	complaints in this case, have you?
12	A. No.
13	Q. Okay. You haven't spoken to the smoker or
14	the smokers in this case, have you?
15	MR. ACOSTA: Objection.
16	THE WITNESS: No, I have not.
17	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
18	Q. You haven't spoken to any of the family
19	members, have you?
20	A. No, I haven't.
21	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
22	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
23	Q. Or any of the treating doctors?
24	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
25	THE WITNESS: I have not talked to doctors.
0276
1	MR. GERAGHTY: What's wrong with the form of
2	these questions?
3	MR. ACOSTA: They're totally misleading.
4	This is a generic deposition. It involves 700 or
5	more people, you know.
6	MR. GERAGHTY: Well - and it's going to be
7	played in one case.
8	MR. ACOSTA: Right. And that's -- those --
9	those questions --
10	MR. GERAGHTY: No. I appreciate it. You
11	told me the basis.
12	MR. ACOSTA: Okay.
13	MR. GERAGHTY: Fair enough. I asked. I
14	understand what you're saying.
15	MR. ACOSTA: I know. But you argued last,
16	and it's not --
17	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay.
18	MR. ACOSTA: -- fair to shut me up.
19	MR. GERAGHTY: No, I'm not trying to shut you
20	up. I just wanted to make sure I understood what
21	you were saying.
22	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
23	Q. You haven't read the deposition of the smoker
24	or smokers in this case, have you?
25	MR. ACOSTA: Same objection.
0277
1	THE WITNESS: This is a generic deposition,
2	so, no, I haven't.
3	MR. ACOSTA: Do you want to give me a
4	standing --
5	MR. GERAGHTY: I will give you - I'll give
6	you a standing -- absolutely --
7	MR. ACOSTA: -- standing objection to this
8	line of questioning?
9	MR. GERAGHTY: Sure.
10	MR. ACOSTA: Thank you.
11	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
12	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you haven't read the
13	deposition of the smoker or smokers in this case,
14	correct?
15	A. No, I haven't.
16	Q. Okay. You haven't read any other depositions
17	taken in this case, correct?
18	A. No, I haven't.
19	Q. You haven't seen any other discovery
20	materials, right?
21	A. No, I haven't.
22	Q. And you've made it clear in a deposition you
23	gave back in November that you're not interested in
24	doing that, correct, for this particular case?
25	A. Well, yes. This and I'm not a historian of
0278
1	the plaintiff.
2	Q. Right. I was getting there.
3	A. Okay. Sorry.
4	Q. It's fair to say that you don't have any
5	knowledge of the facts of the smoker or smokers in this
6	case, correct?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. And that's because you don't consider
9	yourself to be a historian of the plaintiff or the
10	smoker or the smokers in this case, correct?
11	A. That's correct.
12	Q. You consider yourself to be a historian of
13	the larger issues; is that right?
14	A. That's right.
15	Q. All right. And for purposes of your opinion
16	today, it doesn't matter who the particular smoker or
17	smokers in this case are, correct?
18	A. That's correct.
19	Q. Okay. That fact is insignificant for
20	purposes of your opinion, right?
21	A. Yes, that's correct.
22	Q. Okay. The plaintiff -- the smoker or smokers
23	in this case are irrelevant as far as you're concerned,
24	correct?
25	A. They don't play a role in my opinion.
0279
1	Q. Okay. And that's because, as you said, your
2	opinions yesterday and today are generic opinions,
3	right?
4	A. Yes. And, also, that they -- you know, my
5	emphasis is on the industry.
6	Q. Okay. Now, you don't know anything about the
7	smoking history of the smoker or smokers in this case,
8	correct?
9	A. No, I don't.
10	Q. All right. You don't know why the smoker or
11	smokers in this case first began to smoke cigarettes,
12	correct?
13	A. No, I don't know that.
14	Q. You don't know why the smokers in -- excuse
15	me. You don't know why the smoker or smokers in this
16	case first chose to start smoking?
17	A. I haven't looked into the particular
18	plaintiffs.
19	Q. Okay. You don't know at what age the smoker
20	or smokers in this case first started to smoke, right?
21	A. No, I haven't looked into the particulars.
22	Q. All right. Or what year that was?
23	A. This is a generic deposition that could apply
24	to hundreds of people, so, no, I don't.
25	Q. You don't know what year that was, correct?
0280
1	A. Year or years, that's right.
2	Q. Move to strike the last response.
3	You don't know what brand or brands of
4	cigarettes the smoker or smokers in this case smoked,
5	right?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. You don't know why the smoker or smokers in
8	this case chose that brand or any particular brand of
9	cigarettes, correct?
10	A. That's correct.
11	Q. You don't know if the smoker or smokers in
12	this case ever switched from one brand to another,
13	right?
14	A. That's correct.
15	Q. And you mentioned yesterday low tar, light
16	cigarettes, ultra light cigarettes. But the truth is,
17	you don't know if the smoker or smokers in this case
18	ever smoked a light cigarette, a low tar cigarette, or
19	an ultra light cigarette, correct?
20	A. That's correct. When I talked yesterday, it
21	applied to the national market.
22	Q. Okay. You don't know when the smoker or the
23	smokers in this case first learned that cigarette
24	smoking was dangerous and caused disease, right?
25	A. I don't know anything about any particular
0281
1	individual plaintiff.
2	Q. Okay. You don't know what information the
3	smoker or smokers had about the health risks of
4	cigarette smoking, correct?
5	A. Not -- not applied to a particular
6	individual.
7	Q. Okay. Now, you talked at great length
8	yesterday about what The Tobacco Institute, the TIRC,
9	and cigarette manufacturers may have said about
10	cigarette smoking, correct?
11	A. Well, I talked about what they did say about
12	cigarette smoking, but, yes, I did talk about that.
13	Q. Okay. And you have acknowledged that that's
14	potentially one source of information by which a smoker
15	would learn about smoking and health issues, correct?
16	A. Yes, it is a source of information.
17	Q. Okay.
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. Okay. But there are many sources of
20	information by which smokers learn about the health
21	risks of cigarette smoking, correct?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. All right. And they learn about it --
24	smokers learn about the health risks from a variety of
25	different sources, right?
0282
1	MR. ACOSTA: I need to object to this line
2	of --1 think it's a different line of
3	questioning. I object to the form as beyond the
4	scope.
5	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
6	Q. All right. Do you need some water, Doctor?
7	A. Could I get a --
8	Q. That's fine.
9	A. I'm just getting a little dry.
10	MR. ACOSTA: Here is an unopened one right
11	here.
12	THE WITNESS: I don't want to take a break,
13	or anything, because I don't want to interrupt
14	your line. I just want to take a quick swig.
15	Thanks. I'm just drying out a little bit. Thank
16	you.
17	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
18	Q. Okay. Let me just--1 will repeat that so
19	it's clear.
20	A. Yeah. That's good.
21	Q. Smokers learn about the health risks of
22	cigarette smoking from a variety of different sources,
23	do they not?
24	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
25	THE WITNESS: That's true.
0283
1	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
2	Q. Okay. One would be family?
3	A. True.
4	Q. Family members, correct?
5	MR. ACOSTA: Can I ask if I can have a
6	standing objection about the --
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Yes, you may.
8	MR. ACOSTA: -- course and scope and going
9	beyond the scope of direct?
10	MR. GERAGHTY: You may. Absolutely.
11	MR. ACOSTA: Okay.
12	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
13	Q. One -- another would be parents and siblings,
14	correct?
15	A. Correct.
16	Q. Friends?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Teachers?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. The government?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Public health authorities?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. Published media is another source of
25	information, right?
0284
1	A. Yes, yeah.
2	Q. Okay. Let me be more clear. You talked
3	about various forms of media yesterday, right, in which
4	certain statements have been communicated?
5	A. Yes, right.
6	Q. Okay.
7	A. There are --1 only stalled because those are
8	kind of overlapping, but, yes, people learn through the
9	media.
10	Q. Let's be clear. When we're talking about
11	media, we're talking about newspapers and magazines,
12	right?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. Television?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. Radio?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. And these are all methods or means by which a
19	smoker in this country might learn about the health
20	risks of cigarette smoking, correct?
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. And doctors and other medical professionals
23	would be another important source of information for
24	smokers about the health risks of smoking, correct?
25	A. That's correct.
0285
1	Q. And you don't know to what extent the smoker
2	or smokers in this case learned about the health risks
3	of smoking from any of the sources I have identified,
4	right?
5	A. Not -- not any particular individuals or
6	plaintiffs, no.
7	Q. Okay. And if you wanted to assess a
8	particular person's -- the smoker or smokers in this
9	case, their knowledge, his or her knowledge -- well,
10	you know what, I butchered that question. Let me try
11	that again.
12	If you wanted to assess the knowledge that
13	the smoker or smokers in this case had about the health
14	risks of smoking, there are certain things you would
15	need to know, right?
16	A. I'm not sure what your question is.
17	Q. Okay. Well, let me give you some examples.
18	You would need to know their background, right?
19	A. Oh, for an individual?
20	Q. Yes, sir.
21	A. Yeah. I don't do that, but it would be
22	helpful to know their background.
23	Q. Right. If you wanted to know what the smoker
24	or smokers in this case knew about the health risks of
25	smoking, you would want to know about the background,
0286
1	correct?
2	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
3	THE WITNESS: The particular individual's
4	background, yes.
5	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
6	Q. Yes, sir.
7	MR. ACOSTA: And move to strike.
8	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
9	Q. Okay. Their education?
10	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
11	THE WITNESS: If -- if I was interested in
12	what a particular individual wanted to know, that
13	might be helpful, yeah.
14	MR. ACOSTA: Move to strike.
15	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
16	Q. If you wanted to know the answer to the
17	question I posed to you, you would want to know about
18	the smoker's education, correct?
19	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
20	THE WITNESS: That might be helpful, yes.
21	MR. ACOSTA: Move to strike.
22	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
23	Q. It would be helpful, right?
24	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
25	THE WITNESS: Sure, it would be helpful if I
0287
1	were doing an individual biography.
2	MR. ACOSTA: Move to strike.
3	MR. GERAGHTY: You can have a standing
4	objection to this, too, Howard.
5	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. Thank you.
6	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
7	Q. You'd want to know what their parents told
8	them about cigarette smoking, correct?
9	A. That would be of interest.
10	Q. All right. You'd want to know if, for
11	example, the smoker had a close relative or loved one
12	who had suffered or died from a tobacco-related illness
13	during the course of the smoker's life, right?
14	A. It would be interesting to know.
15	Q. That would tell that person a lot about the
16	health risks of smoking, right?
17	A. It might or might not. You would have to
18	look at the particular situation.
19	Q. Okay. But you don't know about that issue
20	with respect to the smoker or smokers in this case,
21	correct?
22	A. That's right, because that's not a question I
23	address --
24	Q. Okay.
25	A. -- among individuals.
0288
1	Q. And, you know, these things I have
2	identified, you don't have any of that information
3	about the smoker or smokers in this case; isn't that
4	true?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. Okay. You don't know where the smoker in
7	this case was born or where the smokers in this case
8	were bom, correct?
9	A. No, I haven't done a study of the smokers in
10	this case.
11	Q. All right. Or when, right?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. You don't know in what geographical area of
14	the country the smoker in this case was raised, or the
15	smokers in this case were raised, right?
16	A. No, I don't know that.
17	Q. Okay. You don't know, for example, what
18	newspapers would have been published in the part of the
19	country where the smoker in this case was raised,
20	right?
21	A. That's right. This is a generic deposition.
22	Q. All right. You don't know what newspaper
23	articles the smoker or smokers in this case read, do
24	you?
25	A. I don't. This is a generic deposition.
0289
1	Q. Okay. You don't know to what extent the
2	smoker or smokers in this case read articles that
3	talked about the health risks of cigarette smoking,
4	correct?
5	A. I have to give the same answer, yes, correct.
6	Q. You don't know that, right?
7	A. This is a generic deposition. That's right.
8	Q. Okay. You don't know where the smoker or
9	smokers in this case attended school, right?
10	A. Same answer.
11	Q. Okay. You don't know whether the doctor -- a
12	doctor ever advised the smoker or smokers in this case
13	to quit smoking, correct?
14	A. Same answer, correct.
15	Q. You don't know when the smoker or smokers in
16	this case first learned that cigarette smoking was
17	addictive, right?
18	A. I haven't looked into the individual
19	plaintiffs. This is a generic deposition.
20	Q. Doctor, you don't know when the smoker or
21	smokers in this case first learned that cigarette
22	smoking was addictive, yes or no?
23	A. I don't know that because this is a generic
24	deposition, and I haven't studied individuals.
25	Q. And I move to the strike the last part of
0290
1	that answer.
2	You don't know what information the smoker or
3	smokers in this case had about how hard it could be to
4	quit smoking, correct?
5	A. Not for any particular individual, no.
6	Q. Okay. You don't know when the smoker or
7	smokers in this case first chose to quit smoking,
8	right?
9	A. I don't know the quitting history, no.
10	Q. Or why?
11	A. I don't know that either.
12	Q. Okay. Or you don't know what methods the
13	smoker or smokers in this case used to quit smoking,
14	correct?
15	A. I haven't studied that, no. This is a
16	generic --
17	Q. Or how many times the smoker -- the smoker or
18	smokers in this case actually tried to quit smoking?
19	A. I haven't looked into that.
20	Q. Okay. You know that one thing that would
21	significantly distinguish one smoker from another in
22	terms of whether they are going to quit smoking is
23	their level of motivation to quit, right?
24	A. You know, I don't make judgments about
25	individuals, why they quit. That may or may not be
0291
1	significant.
2	Q. Doctor, you know that one thing that would
3	significantly distinguish one smoker from the next in
4	terms of whether they're going to quit smoking is their
5	level of motivation to quit smoking, correct?
6	A. In the abstract, motivation would seem to be
7	a significant factor.
8	Q. So the answer to the question is yes?
9	A. Yes. When people are motivated to do
10	something, as a general proposition, that usually means
11	they're more likely to do it.
12	Q. And you don't have any information about how
13	motivated the smoker or smokers in this case were to
14	quit smoking, correct?
15	A. That's correct. This is a generic
16	deposition.
17	Q. Move to strike the last response.
18	Now, with respect to the smoker or smokers in
19	this case, you don't know what their particular reading
20	habits were, do you?
21	A. My answer would be the same as the one I just
22	gave.
23	Q. You don't know what the reading habits --
24	A. I don't know of any particular individual's
25	reading habits because this is a generic deposition.
0292
1	Q. Okay. You don't know what -- whether the
2	smoke -- strike that.
3	You don't know whether the smoker or smokers
4	in this case watched television, right?
5	A. I don't know any particular individual's
6	circumstance.
7	Q. Right. Or what the television-watching
8	habits were in this case, correct?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. Okay. You don't know to what extent the
11	smoker or smokers in this case may have been exposed to
12	any cigarette advertisement on television, radio, or in
13	newspaper, right?
14	A. I haven't studied any particular individual.
15	Q. So the answer --
16	A. So, no.
17	Q. -- the answer to my question is, yes, you
18	don't know?
19	A. Yes, I don't know --
20	Q. Okay.
21	A. -- because this is a generic deposition.
22	Q. All right. You don't know whether the smoker
23	or smokers in this case ever saw or heard about the
24	Frank Statement, right?
25	A. That's correct. I haven't studied any
0293
1	particular individual.
2	Q. Okay. You mentioned that yesterday. The
3	Frank Statement ran on one day in January of 1954; is
4	that right?
5	A. Yeah, that particular advertisement. It was
6	also printed and mailed out.
7	Q. Okay. But it went -- you mentioned that it
8	ran in newspapers, correct?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. It ran on one particular day, right?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. And what day was that, if you could remind
13	us?
14	A. The 4th of January 1954.
15	Q. January 4th, 1954?
16	A. (Indicates affirmatively).
17	Q. And we talked yesterday about the fact that
18	you've testified previously in 11 trials, right?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Okay. And in a number of those trials, you
21	actually were provided information about the smoker in
22	that case, right?
23	A. In individual cases, yeah, I have looked at
24	some general things about the smoker. This is a
25	generic deposition that could apply to many cases, so I
0294
1	haven't done that in this case.
2	Q. Doctor, my question is, simply, in the 11
3	individual cases where you've testified previously,
4	you've been provided information about the smoker,
5	right?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Yes or no? Yes?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. Okay. And in all of those instances, you
10	can't recall a single instance in which any of those
11	smokers ever saw or heard about the Frank Statement,
12	right?
13	A. I wasn't --1 didn't investigate that
14	question in the -- in the materials that I was
15	provided, so I'm --1 mean, they may or may not have
16	responded to that affirmatively. I don't know.
17	Q. Okay. As you -- as you sit here today, you
18	don't recall that there was any information that
19	suggested that any of those smokers in any of those
20	past cases had ever seen or heard about the Frank
21	Statement; is that not correct?
22	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
23	THE WITNESS: I'm trying to stay on track
24	with you. I'm doing my best. Yeah, I don't
25	remember either way, because it was not a question
0295
1	that was of interest to me.
2	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
3	Q. Okay. Now -- and to the extent that you
4	talked yesterday about statements that had been made by
5	The Tobacco Institute or the Tobacco Industry Research
6	Committee and you gave -- you showed some video clips.
7	But to the extent that any of those statements may have
8	appeared in a newspaper article from any of those
9	people, you don't know whether the smoker or smokers in
10	this case ever saw or read that statement, right?
11	A. Those particular statements?
12	Q. Yes, sir.
13	A. Just so I'm clear, what you're really asking
14	me is kind of a one-on-one congruence, you know, where
15	someone might say, well, I remember seeing this
16	particular statement. Is that what you're asking me?
17	Q. No. What I'm asking you is --
18	A. Yeah.
19	Q. -- you mentioned -- you mentioned a lot of
20	statements that were made by a lot of different people
21	who you identified as having some role either with The
22	Tobacco Institute, the Tobacco Industry Research
23	Committee, or was affiliated with one of the cigarette
24	companies who are defendants in this case.
25	You recall that, right?
0296
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. Okay. And you said they made these
3	statements, quote, unquote, publicly, did you not?
4	A. They did, yes.
5	Q. Okay. And my -- my question simply is to the
6	extent that any of those statements you talked about
7	yesterday appeared in a newspaper or on television, or
8	wherever, you don't know whether the smoker or smokers
9	in this case ever saw or read any of those statements,
10	correct?
11	A. That's correct. I haven't been interested in
12	that question.
13	Q. Okay. And we discussed this in a discovery
14	deposition, but -- I'll withdraw that question.
15	Let's -- how long have we been going?
16	A. About an hour.
17	MR. ACOSTA: About an hour.
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Are you good?
19	THE WITNESS: I'm good. I just needed my sip
20	of water.
21	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay.
22	THE WITNESS: I'm with you.
23	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay. We're going to switch
24	topics again, Doctor.
25	THE WITNESS: That's fine. I'll do the same
0297
1	thing.
2	(Brief discussion off the record.)
3	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: While you're changing, we
4	can take a break to change the tape.
5	MR. GERAGHTY: You want to change the tape?
6	Okay. Might as well.
7	THE WITNESS: We're fine, but not the tape.
8	(Brief recess was taken.)
9	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're on the record.
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Are we ready?
11	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Yes, sir.
12	MR. GERAGHTY: Are you ready, Doctor?
13	THE WITNESS: I'm ready.
14	MR. GERAGHTY: Howard?
15	MR. ACOSTA: Yes. Thank you.
16	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
17	Q. We talked just a few moments ago about how
18	things that may have been said by someone who was a
19	representative of a tobacco company or The Tobacco
20	Institute was one message that was made public during
21	the period of time you talked about, the forties, the
22	fifties, the sixties, and the seventies, right?
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. Okay. You agree it's important to explore
25	all the messages that reached the U.S. public, correct?
0298
1	A. Yes. You mean like through media? Is —
2	Q. Right.
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. You talked about the fact that what a tobacco
5	company person may have said is one message, but it's
6	important to explore all the messages, right?
7	A. That's right.
8	Q. And we talked just a few moments ago about
9	the variety of different sources from which someone in
10	the United States would receive information about the
11	health risks of smoking, correct?
12	A. We talked about that, yes.
13	Q. And, yesterday, you weren't just trying to
14	show one side of the story, were you?
15	A. No.
16	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
17	THE WITNESS: I was discussing the tobacco
18	industry and their messages to the public.
19	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
20	Q. In your direct examination at the very
21	beginning, you told Mr. Acosta that you had followed
22	the historical method, correct?
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. And that the historical method is generally
25	accepted among historians like yourself as the
0299
1	appropriate way to conduct historical research, right?
2	A. That's right.
3	Q. And the purpose or goal of the historical
4	method is to derive reliable historical conclusions
5	about past events based on the evidence, right?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. And if you don't follow the historical
8	method, your conclusions won't be reliable; isn't that
9	true?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. I think you said in the past you can get into
12	trouble; isn't that right?
13	A. I may have said that, yeah.
14	Q. If you don't follow the historical method,
15	you may get into trouble, correct?
16	A. Well, yes.
17	Q. Right. And to reach reliable conclusions,
18	you really have to be as thorough as possible, don't
19	you?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. And in order to be thorough, you also want
22	your research -- strike that. In addition to being
23	thorough, you want your research to be as comprehensive
24	as possible, too, right?
25	A. Yes.
0300
1	Q. You shouldn't be selective in using one type
2	of evidence as opposed to another, right?
3	A. I agree.
4	Q. And you agree that it's also important to
5	look not only at the materials a historian reviewed but
6	also what he did not review, correct?
7	A. I'm -- I'm not sure if I follow you now.
8	Q. Well, isn't it important to consider what a
9	historian omitted from their research or their opinions
10	as well as what they did rely upon?
11	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
12	THE WITNESS: Okay. I think you have
13	changed -- now you're talking about evaluating
14	someone else's work?
15	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
16	Q. Do you want me to rephrase the question?
17	A. Yeah.
18	Q. I'll rephrase the question.
19	A. Yeah.
20	Q. In evaluating whether somebody properly
21	followed the historical method, you agree that it's
22	important to look not only at the materials the
23	historian reviewed but also at the materials he did not
24	review, right?
25	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
0301
1	THE WITNESS: Yes.
2	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
3	Q. Now, yesterday, you talked about certain
4	things being published in newspapers, correct?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. And you told Mr. Acosta that you had done
7	research in newspapers, correct?
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. Now, what you didn't say yesterday was that
10	you focused your research of newspapers primarily on a
11	review of The New York Times; isn't that correct?
12	A. Yes. That's one of the papers I have looked
13	at especially carefully.
14	Q. Okay. Well, The New York Times is the only
15	newspaper that you have systematically reviewed for any
16	extensive period of time, correct?
17	A. For the longest period of time and most
18	extensively, yes.
19	(Telephone ringing.)
20	MR. GERAGHTY: We better-
21	THE WITNESS: Yeah.
22	(Brief recess was taken.)
23	MR. GERAGHTY: Ready?
24	MR. ACOSTA: Yeah.
25	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
0302
1	Q. Okay. Ready, Doctor?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Okay. The New York Times is the only
4	newspaper that you have systematically and thoroughly
5	reviewed for any period of time; isn't that right?
6	A. No. I mean, when you phrase it that way, I
7	can't agree with that statement. The better way to
8	think of it is it is the paper that I have most
9	thoroughly looked for the longest period of time. For
10	shorter periods of time, I have reviewed other papers.
11	Q. Okay. Have you -- well, let's -- let's be
12	clear. You had -- you focused your research on The New
13	York Times from 1917 to 1974, correct?
14	A. Yes. I have pulled the -- pulled it forward
15	into the eighties and nineties a bit.
16	Q. And you have done that within the last two
17	years, right?
18	A. Yeah. That's been more, yeah, more recently.
19	Q. As of -- as of at least May 2005, you had
20	focused your research of The New York Times on the
21	period from 1917 to 1974, correct?
22	A. Yeah. That -- yeah, four years ago, May.
23	That sounds about correct, yes.
24	Q. Okay. Now, you did show at least one New
25	York Times article that I recall that was more recent
0303
1	in time than that period, correct?
2	A. You mean yesterday?
3	Q. Yes, sir.
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Okay. It was from 1985 or 1986?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Okay. And did you find that yourself, or was
8	that something that Mr. Acosta found and provided it to
9	you?
10	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
11	THE WITNESS: I think it was one I found
12	myself. I've looked at a lot of New York Times.
13	Which one --
14	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
15	Q. Well, the truth is you really don't know
16	whether that article was one that you found yourself or
17	whether Mr. Acosta found, correct?
18	A. Mr. Acosta did find some New York Times
19	articles, and I would have to look at my notes to see
20	if it was one of the ones that was in my set.
21	Q. Mr. Acosta found a series of New York Times
22	articles from the eighties and the nineties a couple of
23	years ago and provided those to you, did he not?
24	A. He did, yeah. I have since misplaced those.
25	Q. Okay. As of -- as of two years ago, the last
0304
1	time you had testified in a trial for Mr. Acosta, your
2	systematic and thorough review of The New York Times
3	had only gone up to 1974, correct?
4	A. As of '05?
5	Q. Yes, sir.
6	A. Yeah, that's right. That was really closer
7	to four years ago, but, yeah.
8	Q. And at that time, Mr. Acosta provided you a
9	series of New York Times articles he had found from the
10	1980s and the 1990s, correct?
11	A. Yes. Although, I also had articles from that
12	time period as well in my set --
13	Q. And you told--
14	A. -- that I gave you last fall.
15	Q. You've testified previously that Mr. Acosta
16	provided you with a series of articles that you had
17	never seen before, though, correct?
18	A. That's right. And I since mislaid those.
19	Q. Okay. And as you sit here today, you don't
20	know whether that 1985 New York Times article that you
21	displayed yesterday to the jury was one you originally
22	found or Mr. Acosta originally found; isn't that
23	correct?
24	A. That's right. And the only way for me to
25	answer that question would be for me to go to my notes
0305
1	and check my notes, which I can do during the lunch
2	break, and then I can give you an answer. I have
3	thousands of them in my files that I found, and I can't
4	keep them all in my memory.
5	Q. Okay. You know what it means to do a
6	systematic and thorough review of a newspaper, correct?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. Okay. And you haven't done a thorough or
9	systematic review of any other national newspaper other
10	than The New York Times; isn't that correct?
11	A. You asked me this question a few minutes ago,
12	and, you know, to be accurate, what I have to say is
13	that I have done them -- for the longest period of time
14	The New York Times, and then for shorter periods of
15	time I have done other newspapers.
16	Q. Have you done a systematic and thorough
17	review of any other national newspaper for anything
18	more than a month or six-month period?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Which paper?
21	A. I have done reviews of Hartford Courant; Iowa
22	newspapers; St. Louis Post-Dispatch, I believe is the
23	name of it; done some work in the Los Angeles Times;
24	you know. Each paper has focused on a different
25	period, but I have looked at a lot of papers. But,
0306
1	yes, the most --1 have relied most thoroughly on The
2	New York Times, so that is true.
3	Q. Let me do it this way. Have you done a
4	systematic or thorough review of any newspaper other
5	than The New York Times for the period of the
6	fifties -- the forties, fifties, sixties, and
7	seventies?
8	A. For that entire period?
9	Q. Yes, sir.
10	A. New York Times only.
11	Q. Okay. And you haven't done a thorough and
12	systematic review of any other national newspaper for
13	that period of time, the forties, fifties, sixties, and
14	seventies, correct?
15	A. That's right. I have relied on The New York
16	Times.
17	Q. All right. Now, when did you do your own --
18	when did you first do your own original research on The
19	New York Times coverage of smoking and health issues?
20	A. I began doing that in -- it's been a long
21	time, but it was around 2002.
22	Q. When?
23	A. Around 2002.
24	Q. 2002?
25	A. It's been -- it's been a long time --
0307
1	Q. Okay.
2	A. -- but --
3	Q. And as we said a moment ago, when you first
4	did that original research, you concentrated on the
5	period of time between 1917 and 1974, right?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Okay. And that was when -- when you did that
8	research, that was two years after you had given your
9	first deposition in that Boerner case we talked about
10	at the very beginning of my examination, right?
11	A. Yes. That particular research came after the
12	Boemer deposition.
13	Q. Now, you use a--you use--1 may get this
14	wrong, but you use what I understand to be a database
15	called ProQuest to do your New York Times research,
16	correct?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. Okay. And you can type in search temis and
19	search to see whether those temis appear in New York
20	Times articles for any period of time that ProQuest has
21	The New York Times available, correct?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. All right. And when you did your original
24	research back in 2002, you searched for words like
25	"cigarette," right?
0308
1	A. That's right, and it's variant spellings.
2	Q. I'm sorry?
3	A. And it's variant spellings.
4	Q. Cancer?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. Okay. Now, when you did your original
7	research back in 2002 on The New York Times, though,
8	you didn't search for the word "addiction," did you?
9	A. No.
10	Q. Or "habit"?
11	A. No.
12	Q. Or "nicotine"?
13	A. No, I didn't search that either.
14	Q. Or "difficult to quit," right?
15	A. No.
16	Q. When you did your original research back in
17	2002 on The New York Times, you searched for the names
18	of particular individuals who worked for The Tobacco
19	Institute and for the Tobacco Industry Research
20	Committee, did you not?
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. Okay. One was Clarence Cook Little, right?
23	A. That's right.
24	Q. You showed a clip from him yesterday?
25	A. That's right.
0309
1	Q. He was the fomier head of the Tobacco
2	Industry Research Committee?
3	A. That is correct.
4	Q. Okay. Another individual whose name you
5	specifically searched for on this ProQuest database was
6	a man named Timothy Hartnett, right?
7	A. Timothy Hartnett. And I'm not trying to
8	interrupt you, but Little was head of the scientific
9	advisory board, you know, minor thing, but --
10	Q. No, I appreciate that. So let me make sure
11	we get that clear. Right.
12	He was actually the head of the scientific
13	advisory board of the Tobacco Industry Research
14	Committee, correct?
15	A. That's right.
16	Q. All right. So we got that clear.
17	You also searched for Timothy Hartnett,
18	right?
19	A. That's correct.
20	Q. And Timothy Hartnett was the past chairman at
21	one point in time of the Tobacco Industry Research
22	Committee, right?
23	A. That's right.
24	Q. And you searched for Clarence Cook Little and
25	Timothy Hartnett because you were specifically
0310
1	developing files on those individuals, right?
2	A. Well, I was interested in what they as
3	representatives of the tobacco industry's research
4	effort were saying to the public or what kind of
5	coverage they were getting in The New York Times.
6	Q. You were developing specific files on those
7	two individuals, Clarence Cook Little and Timothy
8	Hartnett, correct?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. Okay. And you wanted files on them because
11	you wanted to get as much of the tobacco industry's
12	side as you could; isn't that fair?
13	A. Well, I was interested in seeing what the
14	tobacco industry had -- both what they had said to the
15	public through the press and also what kind of coverage
16	they were getting.
17	Q. But that was your goal, to get as much of the
18	industry's side as you could, correct?
19	A. Well, I just told you what I was trying to
20	do.
21	Q. Were you trying to get as much of the
22	industry's side as you could?
23	A. I was trying to get the coverage of the
24	industry's efforts.
25	Q. Now, there were dozens and dozens and dozens
0311
1	of other famous doctors and scientists and members of
2	the public health community, all of whom stated
3	publicly in the forties, fifties, sixties, and
4	seventies that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer,
5	correct?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. All right. And when you did the bulk of your
8	original research on that ProQuest database of The New
9	York Times, you didn't search ProQuest to find out
10	about any one of those specific individuals, did you?
11	A. No. Because they got caught up when I put in
12	cigarettes and cancer.
13	Q. Well, the truth is, Doctor, you didn't even
14	think to search for those individuals back in 2002,
15	right?
16	A. Well, they were well reported in the results
17	I was getting.
18	Q. Well--but you--you saw the need or felt
19	the need to search specifically for Timothy Hartnett
20	and Clarence Cook Little, correct?
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. Okay. But you didn't search, for example,
23	for Dr. Leroy Burney, right?
24	A. No, I didn't search for Leroy Burney.
25	Q. Okay. And Leroy Burney was the surgeon
0312
1	general in the late 1950s, correct?
2	A. That's correct.
3	Q. You didn't search for Luther Terry, right?
4	A. No, I didn't search specifically for him.
5	Q. Luther Terry was the surgeon general of the
6	United States when the surgeon general's first report
7	was published in January of 1964, correct?
8	A. That's right.
9	Q. Okay. You didn't search for Jesse Steinfeld,
10	did you? You've never searched for Jesse Steinfeld,
11	have you?
12	A. No. I've read extensively about him, but,
13	no, I didn't research for him --
14	Q. You never --
15	A. --in the paper.
16	Q. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Jesse Steinfeld was the surgeon general of
19	the United States in the early 1970s, correct?
20	A. That's right.
21	Q. You didn't search for Dr. Julius Richmond,
22	did you?
23	A. Not specifically for him, no.
24	Q. Okay. And he was the surgeon general of the
25	United States in the late 1970s, correct?
0313
1	A. Yeah. Late seventies?
2	Q. He was --
3	A. I'd have to check.
4	Q. He was the surgeon general --
5	A. Okay.
6	Q. — when the 1979 surgeon general's report was
7	published, right?
8	A. Yes. Okay. Yes.
9	Q. And that was the period of time that you
10	talked about yesterday with Mr. Acosta, was it not?
11	A. Yes. I was just trying to get the -- their
12	services straight in my mind.
13	Q. All right. You didn't search for
14	Dr. E. Cuyler Hammond, did you?
15	A. Not specifically by name, no.
16	Q. Right. And Dr. E. Cuyler Hammond was the
17	head of the American Cancer Society, correct?
18	A. He was a chief researcher. He wasn't
19	actually the head of it, but, yes, he was with the
20	American Cancer Society.
21	Q. Doctor E. Cuyler Hammond was with the
22	American Cancer Society for many years, right?
23	A. Oh, yes.
24	Q. And the American Cancer Society has been
25	probably the most aggressive or one of the most
0314
1	aggressive public health organizations in this country
2	telling people about the health risks of cigarette
3	smoking, right?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. And Dr. Hammond has been at the front of that
6	effort from the fifties and the sixties right on
7	through the seventies, correct?
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. Okay. You didn't search for Dr. Daniel Horn,
10	did you?
11	A. No, not at that particular time, no.
12	Q. Right. And Dr. Daniel Horn was also, at one
13	point, with the American Cancer Society, correct?
14	A. That's right. He worked with them.
15	Q. And, later -- later, he was with -- was it
16	the U.S. Public Health Service?
17	A. That's right. The specific unit was the
18	Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health.
19	Q. And he was an outspoken advocate to the
20	public, the American public, about the health risks of
21	smoking, correct?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. Okay. We will talk a little bit more about
24	him later. But another individual you did not search
25	for was Ernst -- Dr. Ernst Wynder, right?
0315
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. And Dr. Ernst Wynder -- we will show it a
3	little bit later, I think, but he was the doctor that
4	conducted the famous experiment in which they painted
5	tar condensate from cigarette smoke onto the back of
6	mice, correct?
7	A. That's right.
8	Q. Okay. And as you said, that was -- that
9	experiment and the media publicity from that experiment
10	was widely disseminated throughout the country,
11	correct?
12	A. Yes. I've testified about that in the past.
13	Q. You didn't search for Dr. Evarts Graham --
14	A. Not specifically --
15	Q. -- right?
16	A. --by name, no.
17	Q. He was the other doctor who did the
18	experiments with Dr. Wynder, correct?
19	A. That's right. He was Wynder's teacher.
20	Q. Right. They're commonly referred to as the
21	Wynder and Graham mouse skin-painting studies, correct?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. Okay. You didn't search for Dr. Oscar
24	Auerbach either, did you?
25	A. Not specifically by name.
0316
1	Q. And you know that Dr. Oscar Auerbach was a
2	famous surgeon, right?
3	A. Yes. Pathologist?
4	Q. And -- pathologist?
5	A. (Indicates affirmatively).
6	Q. He was one of the first doctors who actually
7	saw a lung cancer operation, right? Do you recall
8	that?
9	A. You're not getting him confused with Alton
10	Ochsner?
11	Q. Maybe I am. I don't know.
12	A. It's okay.
13	Q. Okay.
14	A. Think beagles with Auerbach.
15	Q. Let me -- I'll withdraw the question.
16	But you know that in the forties and the
17	fifties, Dr. Ochsner was very active, going around to
18	different states, talking to people about the health
19	risks of cigarette smoking, right?
20	A. Yes. Alton Ochsner, yes.
21	Q. And in one of those famous speeches, he
22	likened cigarette smoking to committing suicide, right?
23	A. Yes, yes.
24	Q. And you know he gave that speech right here
25	in the state of Florida, didn't he?
0317
1	MR. ACOSTA: I just want to make sure I still
2	have a continuing objection about the scope.
3	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay.
4	MR. ACOSTA: Right?
5	MR. GERAGHTY: You want to object to the form
6	of all my questions? Okay. If it's an objection
7	to the scope, that's fine.
8	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. Thanks.
9	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
10	Q. Isn't that right?
11	A. He spoke widely all over the country.
12	Q. Okay. And you didn't search for Dr. Oscar
13	Auerbach, did you, on your -- your original New York
14	Times ProQuest database searches; isn't that correct?
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. Okay. Now, one thing you didn't talk about
17	yesterday is that you have never done a systematic,
18	thorough review of any Florida newspaper, have you?
19	A. No.
20	Q. Okay. You have never lived or worked here in
21	the state of Florida, have you?
22	A. No, I have not.
23	Q. Okay. You know the smoker or smokers in this
24	case lived here in the state of Florida, do you not?
25	A. That I know.
0318
1	Q. Okay. And to get a sense of what was
2	happening here in the state of Florida in the various
3	communities here in Florida in the forties and the
4	fifties and the sixties, you would have to research
5	that, wouldn't you?
6	A. If I was interested only in Florida.
7	Q. Okay.
8	A. But smoking is a national phenomenon.
9	Q. Okay. It's a national phenomenon?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. You haven't conducted, though, a systematic
12	or comprehensive review of any Florida newspaper,
13	right?
14	A. That's right.
15	Q. And other than looking at its coverage for
16	the period of January 1964, you've never done a
17	systematic or comprehensive review of the Miami Herald,
18	right?
19	A. That's right.
20	Q. Okay. You've never done a systematic or
21	comprehensive review of the Tampa Tribune, right?
22	A. That's right.
23	Q. For any period of time?
24	A. That's correct.
25	Q. You haven't looked at the St. Petersburg
0319
1	Times, have you?
2	A. That's right.
3	Q. For any period of time?
4	A. Correct.
5	Q. You haven't looked at the Ft. Lauderdale
6	Sun-Sentinel or its predecessor, the Ft. Lauderdale
7	News, have you?
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. For any period of time, right?
10	A. That's correct.
11	Q. Okay. You haven't looked at the Pensacola
12	News Journal, have you?
13	A. I would have to check my notes on that.
14	Q. Well, when you gave your deposition in
15	November of this year, you hadn't looked at the
16	Pensacola News Journal, had you?
17	A. That's true.
18	Q. Okay. For any period of time, correct?
19	A. That's correct.
20	Q. All right. You haven't looked at the
21	Jacksonville Journal, have you?
22	A. No.
23	Q. For any period of time?
24	A. That's correct.
25	Q. You haven't looked at the Orlando Sentinel,
0320
1	right?
2	A. That's right.
3	Q. For any period of time?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. You haven't looked at the Palm Beach Post,
6	right?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. For any period of time?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. How about the Ft. Myers News-Press, have you
11	ever looked at any articles from that paper?
12	A. I don't think so, but I would have to check
13	my notes.
14	Q. You don't think you have looked at the
15	Ft. Myers News-Press, right?
16	A. No, I don't think I have.
17	Q. Is there any reason you're hesitating?
18	A. Oh, the only reason is that recently
19	available to me is a new newspaper archive that has a
20	small set of small town papers, and I have been doing
21	research in small town papers nationally, of which
22	there are a couple of Florida papers in there.
23	Q. When did you start to do that?
24	A. I have been working on that, really, since
25	Christmas, "newspaperarchive.com," signed up for that.
0321
1	It's another database that has become available.
2	Q. You've never done any systematic or thorough
3	review of the Ft. Myers News-Press, have you?
4	A. I don't think that's one of the papers in the
5	set.
6	Q. Okay.
7	A. There is --
8	Q. For any period of time, right?
9	A. Correct.
10	Q. Okay. You haven't looked at the Gainesville
11	Sun, have you?
12	A. No.
13	Q. And that's for any period of time, correct?
14	A. That's correct.
15	Q. You haven't looked at the Tallahassee
16	Democrat, correct?
17	A. No, I haven't looked at that one.
18	Q. For any particular period of time?
19	A. That's correct.
20	Q. So it's safe to say that whatever has been
21	published in those newspapers in the forties, the
22	fifties, the sixties and seventies, you haven't seen
23	that, right?
24	A. I have not reviewed those papers.
25	Q. Okay. Do you know how many stories you might
0322
1	have missed about the issues regarding smoking and
2	health because you haven't reviewed those papers?
3	A. I haven't reviewed those papers, so I don't
4	know the answer to that question.
5	Q. Okay.
6	A. It doesn't really matter to me. It's not
7	part of my opinions.
8	Q. It doesn't matter?
9	A. No. I have relied on the national press.
10	Q. Okay. You don't think local papers matter?
11	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
12	THE WITNESS: Not in this context, no.
13	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
14	Q. Okay. Well, the truth is, though, that
15	you've been involved in other cases where the
16	plaintiffs lawyer specifically asked you to look at
17	local newspapers in the community where the smoker in
18	that case grew up, right?
19	A. That's correct.
20	Q. Okay. We've talked a good bit about the
21	Boemer case in Arkansas, right?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. You looked at local newspaper articles in
24	that case, correct?
25	A. I reviewed the defense historian's newspaper
0323
1	research in that case.
2	Q. You looked at local newspapers for the
3	Boemer case, did you not?
4	A. Yes, but that's --
5	MR. ACOSTA: Object to the fomi.
6	THE WITNESS: -- that's the source of them.
7	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
8	Q. You also testified in a case called Mash,
9	which was in Missouri, right?
10	A. That's correct.
11	Q. And in that case you went so far as to hire a
12	research assistant to help you go through the local
13	newspapers in that particular case, correct?
14	A. That's correct.
15	Q. Okay. And when you testified before that
16	jury in Missouri, you actually referenced, during your
17	examination, a number of those local newspapers, did
18	you not?
19	A. That's correct.
20	Q. Okay. You also worked on a case in Iowa
21	where you suggested to the plaintiffs lawyers that you
22	should look at the local Iowa newspapers, right?
23	MR. ACOSTA: Object to the form.
24	THE WITNESS: That's right.
25	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
0324
1	Q. And you --1 think you mentioned you had a
2	case in Hartford where you looked at the Hartford
3	Courier; is that correct?
4	A. Courant.
5	Q. I'm sorry, the Hartford Courant?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Okay. But you had a case pending -- was it
8	pending in Hartford?
9	A. Yeah. I never testified at the trial. I was
10	deposed in a case.
11	Q. Okay. But in that particular case involving
12	a smoker from Hartford, you took it upon yourself to
13	review the Hartford Courant, correct?
14	A. Yes. And what I've learned is, essentially,
15	no significant difference in all these local papers
16	that I've looked at. And it's reinforced my opinion
17	that the Times is an adequate picture of the coverage
18	of this issue.
19	Q. You think there is -- there is, you know, no
20	difference between what's in The New York Times and
21	what might appear in a Florida paper; is that right?
22	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
23	THE WITNESS: No. What I said was, you know,
24	the general patterns of coverage follow the -- you
25	know, are similar enough for me to make my
0325
1	opinion.
2	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
3	Q. I'm sorry, I didn't hear that last part.
4	A. The general patterns of coverage, my
5	experience has been, are similar enough for me to make
6	my opinion.
7	Q. Well, with respect to The New York Times,
8	specifically, though, isn't it true that The New York
9	Times wasn't nationally distributed in the fifties and
10	the sixties the way it's distributed today?
11	A. Oh, that's true, yes. And I made no claim
12	that it was.
13	Q. Okay. Let's just make sure that's clear,
14	though.
15	A. Okay.
16	Q. You're not suggesting that any of those New
17	York Times papers, those articles were here in Florida,
18	right? You don't know to what extent anybody was
19	reading The New York Times in the state of Florida in
20	the forties, fifties, and sixties, correct?
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. So you don't believe that the coverage of
23	issues like smoking and health can differ from one
24	paper to the next?
25	A. No. My point was that in the broadest
0326
1	patterns, the patterns are similar.
2	Q. Okay. Well, haven't you, in fact, went so
3	far to say that you should consult local press when
4	it's available to you?
5	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
6	THE WITNESS: Yeah. I've looked at so many
7	papers, you know, my view is that the patterns are
8	similar. The broad patterns are similar.
9	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
10	Q. Well, don't you agree, though, that the
11	coverage of issues on -- the coverage of issues like
12	smoking and health can differ from paper to paper,
13	though?
14	A. You can have minor, you know, particularistic
15	differences. But, again, the broad patterns, in my
16	experience -- are you late for something? You're
17	looking at your watch.
18	Q. No, no.
19	A. Oh, okay.
20	Q. I'm adjusting it.
21	A. Okay. In the broad patterns, my -- my
22	opinion is, is that they tend to follow the same -- the
23	same waxing and waning. And my experience has been The
24	New York Times is, in fact, extremely comprehensive.
25	And so that's why I've relied on it. It's a paper of
0327
1	record.
2	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay. Let's -- why don't we
3	take a five-minute break and then pick up after
4	that.
5	THE WITNESS: Okay.
6	(Brief recess was taken.)
7	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're on the record.
8	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
9	Q. Are you ready to go, Doctor?
10	A. I am.
11	Q. Okay. I want to show you a couple of
12	newspaper articles. The first one we have marked as
13	Defendant's Exhibit 5.
14	(Defendant Exhibit 5 was marked for
15	identification.)
16	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
17	Q. I will give you the marked version. And,
18	Doctor, if you look at the cover page, this is an
19	article that comes from the December 13th, 1952,
20	edition of The Miami Herald, correct?
21	MR. ACOSTA: Could you tell me, before you do
22	this, what the exhibit number is that was given to
23	me on -- down at the bottom there?
24	MR. GERAGHTY: Oh, you know what, you may
25	not -- yours is a different copy. Let me see
0328
1	here.
2	MR. ACOSTA: It's a different -- it's a whole
3	different --
4	MR. GERAGHTY: No. It's - what it is, is
5	mine got photocopied with the cover page on the
6	back. Let's see. There you go.
7	MR. ACOSTA: Thank you. Okay. Thanks. I've
8	got it. Thank you.
9	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
10	Q. Okay. If you flip to the second page, do you
11	see there it's an article from The Miami Herald from
12	Saturday, December the 13th, 1952. And the title of
13	the article is, Study Links Lung Cancer to Smoking,
14	correct?
15	A. Let me just read it real quick.
16	Q. You want to read it?
17	A. Yeah.
18	Q. Go ahead. I should have given these to you
19	during the break.
20	MR. ACOSTA: Yeah.
21	THE WITNESS: Oh, I see. You've got two
22	copies, one that's not cut off. All right. So
23	it's not three pages. Okay. I have read it.
24	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
25	Q. Okay. Doctor, this article from The Miami
0329
1	Herald, you've never seen it before, correct?
2	A. Just to make this process a little quicker, I
3	mean, I did review the documents that you submitted for
4	cross-examination, and this was part of it.
5	Q. So you looked at it last night?
6	A. Yeah, that's right.
7	Q. Okay. Let me -- let me --1 appreciate that.
8	Let me rephrase the question.
9	Doctor, I have shown you a copy of an article
10	from The Miami Herald dated December 13th, 1952,
11	correct?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. And you had not found this article in your
14	research, correct?
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. You saw it for the first time last night when
17	my office provided a copy of it to Mr. Acosta for
18	purposes of this deposition, correct?
19	A. That's correct.
20	Q. All right. And you haven't found it, because
21	you had not done a systematic review of The Miami
22	Herald for any period of time, right?
23	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
24	THE WITNESS: That's correct.
25	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
0330
1	Q. All right. Now, the title of the article --
2	the title says, Study Links Lung Cancer to Smoking,
3	correct?
4	A. That's the title.
5	Q. And this was published in 1952?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. And the very first paragraph reads, the
8	British Medical Journal said Friday a four-year study
9	showed death from lung cancer increases as tobacco
10	smoking increases.
11	Correct?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Did I read that correctly?
14	A. Yes, you read it correctly.
15	Q. And so here we have a 1952 article published
16	here in Florida linking cigarette smoking to lung
17	cancer, correct?
18	A. Yes. It's an Associated Press story.
19	Q. Okay. And you have -- if you look through
20	the article, which you've now had time to do, right?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. All right. There is no statement or response
23	from anyone from The Tobacco Institute or anybody who
24	could be characterized as a representative for a
25	cigarette company, correct?
0331
1	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
2	THE WITNESS: No, there is no statement.
3	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
4	Q. Okay. You talked yesterday about the
5	industry having statements put in newspapers, right, or
6	being quoted in newspapers?
7	A. Yeah, particularly after their PR effort got
8	together in 1953, late '53.
9	Q. Okay. And there is no statement or response
10	from anybody on behalf of any tobacco company in this
11	particular article; is that correct?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. Now, let me show you what we have marked as
14	Defendant's Exhibit No. 6.
15	(Defendant Exhibit 6 was marked for
16	identification.)
17	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
18	Q. Do you want to take a moment to read that?
19	Just read it. And when you feel comfortable and I can
20	ask questions, you let me know. Let me know when
21	you're ready, Doctor.
22	A. Okay. Let me --
23	MR. ACOSTA: What did you call this exhibit
24	number?
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Defendant's Exhibit No. 6.
0332
1	(A pause was had in the proceedings.)
2	THE WITNESS: Okay.
3	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
4	Q. Okay. Doctor, we've marked as Defendant's
5	Exhibit 6 -- this is an article from the
6	St. Petersburg Times dated June 22nd, 1954, correct?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. And this is a newspaper article that you did
9	not find in your research, correct?
10	A. Not from this particular newspaper, but this
11	is an AP wire story --
12	Q. Okay.
13	A. -- so it would have appeared in many
14	newspapers.
15	Q. You think you've seen it in other newspapers?
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. But this article from the
18	St. Petersburg Times you never found in your own
19	research, right?
20	A. Not this particular one, no.
21	Q. Okay. And it's dated June 22nd, 1954, right?
22	A. Yes. I mean, it's -- the date is cut off on
23	this copy, but I have no doubt that that's -- yeah,
24	here it is on the last page, June 22nd, '54.
25	Q. June 22nd, 1954, correct?
0333
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. Okay. And the title of the article says,
3	Report Says Smoking Cuts Life Span, correct?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. And if you read the very first paragraph of
6	the article, it reads, quote, Smoking a pack or more of
7	cigarettes daily cuts the life span and doubles death
8	rates from cancer and heart attacks in men 50 to 70,
9	the American Cancer Society reported yesterday.
10	Did I read that correctly?
11	A. Yes, you did.
12	Q. Okay. So here is another newspaper published
13	in the state of Florida that discusses the health
14	effects of cigarettes, right?
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. And -
17	MR. ACOSTA: I need to ask you to read
18	something under the rule of completeness.
19	MR. GERAGHTY: What would you like me to
20	read?
21	MR. ACOSTA: I can --1 can -- let me --1
22	have it on my screen. Give me a second to find
23	it, and I will tell you. Okay. Under, Cause and
24	effect, please read the second full paragraph.
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Where?
0334
1	MR. ACOSTA: The sentence right here
2	(Indicating), "numerous experts." Right under,
3	Cause and effect, read the sentence "numerous
4	experts."
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay. Sorry. Sorry. Now I'm
6	with you.
7	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
8	Q. Okay. Let me read -- I'm going to read the
9	paragraph above it and that whole paragraph.
10	Their evidence -- tell me if I read this
11	correctly.
12	Their evidence indicates a cause and effect
13	between cigarettes and heart attacks and cancer, they
14	added. There have been numerous reports previously
15	linking cigarettes with an alarming rise in lung
16	cancer. Numerous experts have said that they felt that
17	there has been no proof of such a link. Atmospheric
18	pollution also has been suspected as a cause.
19	Did I read that correctly?
20	A. Yes, you did.
21	Q. Okay. And if you look at this article, there
22	is no statement from anybody on behalf of a tobacco
23	company or The Tobacco Institute in this article,
24	right?
25	A. Not in this article.
0335
1	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
2	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
3	Q. And what -- and that paragraph I referenced
4	is -- references the fact that there was a debate among
5	medical doctors and scientists in this period of time
6	about whether there was, in fact, proof that cigarette
7	smoking caused lung cancer, right?
8	A. Yes. Although, I would modify that and use
9	the -- that there was at this time a debate in the
10	public, yes.
11	Q. Okay. And in addition to, I think, what --
12	well, strike that.
13	In addition to the tobacco industry, which
14	you mentioned statements yesterday, there were other
15	doctors and scientists unaffiliated with the tobacco
16	industry who questioned whether the evidence was
17	sufficient to establish a cause and effect
18	relationship; is that right?
19	A. That's correct.
20	Q. Okay. Doctor, I'm going to show you what
21	we're going to mark as Deposition Exhibit --
22	Defendant's Exhibit 7 and 8.
23	(Defendant Exhibit 7 and Defendant Exhibit 8
24	were marked for identification.)
25	MR. GERAGHTY: This one is -- excuse me. I'm
0336
1	sorry. Seven --
2	MR. ACOSTA: Okay.
3	MR. GERAGHTY: - and 8.
4	MR. ACOSTA: Okay.
5	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
6	Q. Do you want a moment to review this, Doctor?
7	MR. ACOSTA: You know what, this one doesn't
8	have your number on it.
9	MR. GERAGHTY: We will provide that to you.
10	MR. ACOSTA: Well, I need it so I can find
11	it. That's the problem.
12	MR. GERAGHTY: Well, I've given it to you.
13	MR. ACOSTA: No, no, no. Yeah. You know, I
14	can't read --1 can't even read this, it's so
15	small. Are you getting that number for me?
16	MR. GERAGHTY: We're getting it for you. Can
17	we move on? Come on.
18	MR. ACOSTA: Well, no. I mean, I want to see
19	it. I want to get the number so I can see if it's
20	one that you actually gave me.
21	MR. GERAGHTY: Oh, okay. Well-
22	MR. ACOSTA: And then -- and then -- and then
23	get my copy, which I can actually read.
24	MR. GERAGHTY: Find it on our list.
25	MR. ACOSTA: This is in, like -- the typeset
0337
1	for this is, like, two points, or something. I
2	can hardly even see it.
3	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
4	Q. All right. Doctor, I have handed you two
5	articles which we've marked as Defendant's Exhibit No.
6	7 and Defendant's Exhibit No. 8, correct?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. Okay. Defendant's Exhibit No. 7 is an
9	article from The New York Times dated June the 5th,
10	1957, correct?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. And the title of that is --1 will put it on
13	the screen here. There you go. Maybe this will help
14	Mr. Acosta a little bit.
15	MR. ACOSTA: Well, before you ask questions,
16	I object to it until I get a chance to get the
17	number that you provided me with----
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay.
19	MR. ACOSTA: - so I can -
20	MR. GERAGHTY: Subject to that objection, we
21	will --
22	UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: It's your exhibit.
23	MR. ACOSTA: So it's my exhibit?
24	MR. GERAGHTY: It's your exhibit.
25	MR. ACOSTA: Okay.
0338
1	MR. GERAGHTY: You don't have any objection
2	to it, do you?
3	MR. ACOSTA: Well, give me a second so I can
4	find it, if you don't mind, because I can't --1
5	can't read the one that you've got, so just bear
6	with me, please.
7	MR. GERAGHTY: I mean, I didn't ask to read
8	50,000 ads that you gave to the doctor yesterday.
9	We didn't try to slow down your examination.
10	MR. ACOSTA: Well, you could have if you
11	wanted to, but you didn't.
12	MR. GERAGHTY: No. That - you wouldn't-
13	you wouldn't be done yet.
14	MR. ACOSTA: This is -- this is different. I
15	am --
16	MR. GERAGHTY: No, it's not different.
17	MR. ACOSTA: Yes, it is.
18	MR. GERAGHTY: No, it's not.
19	MR. ACOSTA: I'm asking you to give me a
20	chance to find the exhibit. And you're slowing me
21	down by objecting to it.
22	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm not-
23	MR. ACOSTA: It's going to take me a second,
24	but I will find it.
25	MR. SCHULTZ: You all are on the record.
0339
1	MR. GERAGHTY: We can agree that that doesn't
2	need to be on the record, right, arguing back and
3	forth?
4	MR. ACOSTA: I don't agree to that.
5	MR. GERAGHTY: You want the bickering on the
6	record?
7	MR. ACOSTA: Not the bickering. I wish you
8	just wouldn't bicker, and just give me the time to
9	find this thing. It's going to take me a second
10	to find it.
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Well, Doctor, we'll do our
12	best to help you get that flight.
13	I mean, the big difference is these exhibits
14	were all given to you as opposed to many of the
15	ones you used yesterday were never disclosed to
16	us.
17	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
18	Q. You're reading, Doctor, so we're -- we're
19	going to take -- you're reading while we're --
20	A. I'm just waiting for you.
21	Q. Okay. Well, why don't you read both
22	articles.
23	A. Okay.
24	Q. I'm going to ask you questions, so you might
25	as well --
0340
1	A. Right.
2	Q. — take advantage of the time.
3	A. Okay.
4	MR. GERAGHTY: I-
5	MR. ACOSTA: Hold on. I'm getting there.
6	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm asking about this. Okay?
7	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. But give me a second.
8	MR. GERAGHTY: There is no mystery.
9	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
10	Q. Did you look at these last night, Doctor?
11	A. Yes, I skimmed through this.
12	Q. Okay.
13	A. It was actually this morning.
14	MR. GERAGHTY: All right. You've got it.
15	MR. ACOSTA: Yeah.
16	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
17	Q. All right. Let's go.
18	Okay. Doctor, Deposition -- Defendant's
19	Deposition Exhibit No. 7 is a June 5th, 1957, article,
20	from The New York Times, correct?
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. It's an article you've seen in the past,
23	right?
24	A. It is, yes.
25	Q. And the title of it says, Text of the
0341
1	American Cancer Society's report on the Effects of
2	Tobacco Smoking; isn't that right?
3	A. That's correct.
4	Q. And this article specifically is referring to
5	a large --1 think it was a multiyear longitudinal
6	study done by the American Cancer Society on the
7	association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer,
8	correct?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. And this particular article, which we have
11	marked as Exhibit No. 7, was published in The New York
12	Times, and you found this in your own research,
13	correct?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And if you look to the far -- all the way far
16	right column, about three quarters of the way down,
17	does it not say there, Comment by industry?
18	A. Yes, it does.
19	Q. Okay. And it's got statements, comments by
20	members of the tobacco industry in this New York Times
21	article, right?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. Okay. Now, I want to refer you to Exhibit
24	No. 8 now. And this is an article from the
25	Fort Lauderdale Daily News dated one day later on --
0342
1	excuse me, one day earlier on June the 4th, 1957,
2	correct?
3	A. That's correct.
4	Q. Okay. And this article from the
5	Fort Lauderdale Daily News you never found in the
6	course of your research, right?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. Okay. You saw it for the first time
9	yesterday when my office produced it to Mr. Acosta,
10	correct?
11	A. That's correct.
12	Q. Okay. And the article is titled, Study
13	Stresses Danger of Lung Cancer to Smokers, correct?
14	A. That's correct.
15	Q. And the very first article -- excuse me,
16	first paragraph reads, Men who smoke cigarettes are ten
17	times more likely to die of lung cancer than
18	nonsmokers, the American Cancer Society reported today.
19	Did I read that correctly?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. All right. And this same article -- this
22	article dated one day earlier than The New York Times
23	article is talking about the very same American Cancer
24	Society study that was referred to in The New York
25	Times article we just looked at, right?
0343
1	A. Yes. Although, you don't want the listener
2	to be left with the impression that the Times did not
3	cover this -- this report earlier.
4	Q. That's not at all what I'm suggesting,
5	Doctor. What I'm suggesting is that if you look
6	through the entire text of this Fort Lauderdale
7	article, which you now have had the chance to do, there
8	is no industry response or statement by anybody on
9	behalf of any cigarette company like was found in your
10	New York Times article; isn't that true?
11	A. That's correct.
12	Q. Okay. And so this is one example of how the
13	coverage of an issue in a local newspaper, like
14	Fort Lauderdale, can be different from the coverage in
15	The New York Times; isn't that true?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. Okay. Now, let me show you two other
18	articles that we have marked as Defendant's Exhibit
19	No. 9, Defendant's Exhibit No. 10. There you go. Why
20	don't you take a moment to read those.
21	(Defendant Exhibit 9 and Defendant Exhibit 10
22	were marked for identification.)
23	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
24	Q. Just take a moment to read that, and when
25	you're -- Doctor, are you with me?
0344
I	A. Yeah, I'm with you. And just so you know --
2	Q. Okay. Are you taking notes?
3	A. No. When I read through, I took a few notes,
4	which I'll happily provide to you, if you want, at the
5	end of the day.
6	Q. You took notes, you mean, last night or while
7	you're testifying here today?
8	A. No. This is just last night when I was
9	reading through your exhibits --
10	Q. Okay.
II	A. -- because I didn't have paper copies; I only
12	had electronic copies --
13	Q. Okay.
14	A. -- just as an aid for memory.
15	Q. All right. Well, just take a moment to --
16	A. Yeah.
17	Q. --to read the articles?
18	MR. ACOSTA: Can I find out again --
19	MR. GERAGHTY: This is yours.
20	MR. ACOSTA: This is mine. Okay. And the
21	other one is yours?
22	MR. GERAGHTY: Yes.
23	MR. ACOSTA: Okay.
24	MR. GERAGHTY: Let me know when you're ready.
25	(A pause was had in the proceedings.)
0345
1	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: While he's reading, we
2	will go off the record and change the tapes.
3	(Brief recess was taken.)
4	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're on the record.
5	THE WITNESS: Okay.
6	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
7	Q. We're going to wait for Mr. Schultz to --
8	to --
9	(A pause was had in the proceedings.)
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Can we agree that we will cut
11	dead time from the video?
12	MR. ACOSTA: Uh-huh (Indicates
13	affirmatively).
14	MR. GERAGHTY: Mr. Acosta said yes.
15	MR. ACOSTA: I did say yes.
16	(A pause was had in the proceedings.)
17	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We can go off again if
18	you'd like to wait.
19	MS. SCHULTZ: I think we're all right. I
20	will send him an e-mail.
21	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
22	Q. Okay. Are you ready, Doctor?
23	A. Oh, I'm ready. Yeah. I'm just sitting here.
24	Q. Okay. Let me make sure the videographer is
25	ready and --
0346
1	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Yes, sir. We're rolling.
2	THE WITNESS: Yeah.
3	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
4	Q. Okay. Doctor, let me show you first what
5	we've marked as Deposition Exhibit No. 9, and this is
6	an article from The New York Times dated January the
7	12th, 1964, correct?
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. And you've seen this article before. You
10	found it in your research, correct?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. This is The New York Times front cover the
13	day after the 1964 surgeon general's report was
14	released, correct?
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. The title says, Cigarettes Peril Health, U.S.
17	Report Concludes; quote, Remedial Action, closed quote,
18	urged.
19	Did I read that correctly?
20	A. Yes, you did.
21	Q. And if you go down -- actually, it's going
22	to --1 don't know that I'm going to be able to
23	highlight it for you. But if you go down --1 want to
24	say it's, like, six paragraphs down.
25	A. Yeah, I see it.
0347
1	Q. All right. Several paragraphs down, the
2	paragraph begins, The Tobacco Institute rejected the
3	report saying it was not the last word on smoking and
4	health. The three major broadcasting networks said
5	they would review their policies on tobacco advertising
6	in light of the report.
7	Did I read that correctly?
8	A. Yes, you did.
9	Q. So this is an example of an article from The
10	New York Times, like what you discussed yesterday,
11	where there was an industry response in an article,
12	correct?
13	A. Correct.
14	Q. Okay. Now, I would like you to take a look
15	at what we have marked as Deposition Exhibit No. 10.
16	And Deposition Exhibit No. 10 is an article from the
17	Pensacola News-Joumal, correct?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. And it's dated the same day as the article we
20	just looked at from The New York Times, January 12th,
21	1964, correct?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. And this document is the cover page of the
24	Pensacola News-Joumal on that date, right?
25	A. That's correct.
0348
1	Q. And the title reads, Report Links Cancer,
2	Cigarettes, correct?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And the subheadline says, Smoking Said Hazard
5	to Health by Ten Scientists --
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. — correct?
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. And the very first paragraph of the article
10	reads, Heavy cigarette smoking is the principal cause
11	of cancer of the lungs and the larynx and a health
12	hazard so grave as to call for remedial action, a blue
13	ribbon science panel concluded Saturday.
14	MR. ACOSTA: And under the mle of
15	completeness, I would like you to read this
16	paragraph right next to it —
17	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay.
18	MR. ACOSTA: -- next to the picture.
19	MR. GERAGHTY: Can I finish my question,
20	first, though?
21	MR. ACOSTA: Oh, yeah.
22	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay. Show me what you want
23	to read.
24	MR. ACOSTA: But-
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Let me just -- yeah. You will
0349
1	have to -- okay. All right.
2	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
3	Q. All right. Let me repeat that question.
4	The first paragraph reads, Heavy cigarette
5	smoking is the principal cause of cancer of the lungs
6	and the larynx and a health hazard so grave as to call
7	for remedial action, a blue ribbon science panel
8	concluded Saturday.
9	Did I read that correctly?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. All right. And if you go --1 can't count
12	the paragraphs, but if you go to the far right column
13	there --
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. -- see where it says, But while?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. But while it found much physical menace in
18	smoking, the committee reported that there are benefits
19	in the area of mental health and ease, saying the habit
20	originates in the search for contentment.
21	Did I read that correctly?
22	A. Yes, you did.
23	Q. Okay. And you've now had a chance to -- to
24	read this article, right?
25	A. Yes, I have.
0350
1	Q. Okay. And just for the record, so it's
2	clear, you never found this particular article from the
3	Pensacola News-Joumal in your own research, correct?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. Because you never did any review of any
6	Florida paper, including the Pensacola News-Journal,
7	correct?
8	A. Correct.
9	Q. And in the entirety of this article, there is
10	not a single statement reported from The Tobacco
11	Institute or any representative of the tobacco
12	industry, correct?
13	A. Not in this particular article, but do you
14	have the articles that are referred to in this edition
15	of this paper, that are referred to on the first page?
16	It says, See additional stories, pages 8 and 9A.
17	Q. You know, I don't know that I do. Maybe we
18	can try to find them during the lunch break --
19	A. Okay. Great.
20	Q. — if you would like to see those.
21	But, Doctor, my point is there is no industry
22	response in this article from the Pensacola
23	News-Journal, is there?
24	A. Not in this particular article.
25	Q. Okay. And this is another example of how the
0351
1	coverage in a local newspaper, like the Pensacola
2	News-Joumal, will be different from what you've
3	encountered in your research of The New York Times,
4	right?
5	A. Yeah. It's a little bit different. It's an
6	AP story nationally distributed.
7	Q. But there is no industry response like we saw
8	in The New York Times article that you found, correct?
9	A. Not in this particular story.
10	Q. Bear with me one moment.
11	A. Sure.
12	(A pause was had in the proceedings.)
13	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
14	Q. All right. Okay. Doctor, yesterday, you
15	showed several video clips to the jury, correct?
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. Okay. You showed a Dr. DuPuis from
18	Philip Morris during the "See It Now" program, correct?
19	A. That's correct.
20	Q. And that was a program that ran in 1955?
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. You showed Mr. Coleman, also from
23	Philip Morris, on the CBS news broadcast, the Harry
24	Reasoner broadcast, publicizing the 1964 surgeon
25	general's report, correct?
0352
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. You also showed a movie that you said was
3	created by The Tobacco Institute called "The Need to
4	Know"; isn't that right?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. And each video you showed, you did not show
7	the video in its entirety, correct?
8	A. No. Those were excepted.
9	Q. Right. And of each of those videos we've now
10	mentioned, you showed only statements made by the
11	tobacco industry; isn't that correct?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. Okay. There were significant parts of all
14	three of those videos that you did not show, correct?
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. All right. We're going to show a couple of
17	examples of those. First, we're going to show "See It
18	Now" from 1955.
19	MR. ACOSTA: I'm going to have to ask that
20	under the rule of completeness you show the entire
21	show, then.
22	MR. GERAGHTY: No. We're not going to do
23	that. If you want to do it during redirect, you
24	can do it.
25	MR. ACOSTA: I'm asking you to do that.
0353
1	MR. GERAGHTY: And I'm -
2	MR. ACOSTA: You're going to have to show the
3	entire thing.
4	MR. GERAGHTY: You can do it on your
5	redirect, if you want to do it. And we will be
6	here until whenever.
7	MR. ACOSTA: It doesn't matter to me.
8	(A video clip was played.)
9	THE NARRATOR: Good evening. This is See It
10	Now, produced by the partners of Friendly and
11	Murrow.
12	Tonight, the first of two reports on
13	cigarettes and lung cancer.
14	In 1952, Drs. Hammond and Horn of the
15	American Cancer Society began an extended study of
16	the smoking habits of American men. Here is
17	Dr. Hammond reporting on the results of the first
18	two years.
19	DR. HAMMOND: It is now established in my
20	opinion beyond a reasonable doubt that cigarette
21	smoking greatly increases the probability of
22	developing lung cancer. In my opinion, people
23	should be warned of the dangers, and they are
24	being warned. What they then want to do, whether
25	they wish to or not, is their own business.
0354
1	THE NARRATOR: Next, Dr. Ernst Wynder, and
2	research assistant Adele Croninger.
3	MR. WYNDER: And this bottle contains the
4	amount of tar to which the average heavy cigarette
5	smoker is exposed to over a given year's period of
6	time.
7	We believe that the present evidence very
8	strongly indicates that tobacco smoking, and
9	particularly cigarette smoking, is a major cause
10	of lung cancer.
11	(End of video clip.)
12	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
13	Q. Okay. Doctor, what we just saw was a clip
14	from the first -- the "See It Now" program is a two-day
15	program, correct?
16	A. Yes, a two-part program.
17	Q. Two-part program that aired over consecutive
18	days, right?
19	A. It's actually consecutive weeks.
20	Q. Consecutive weeks.
21	And the clip you just saw was from the first
22	segment of the show, right?
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. And we saw -- the first gentleman that was
25	shown was Dr. Daniel Horn, correct?
0355
1	A. I -
2	Q. Or was it Hammond?
3	A. I thought that was Cuyler Hammond.
4	Q. Okay. It was Dr. Hammond, you believe?
5	A. I would have to check. I wasn't really
6	paying attention because I've watched it so many times.
7	It was one or the other.
8	Q. Okay. And what he said on the "See It Now"
9	program was published nationally on television here in
10	the United States in 1955, correct?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. And the other gentleman we saw was Dr. Ernst
13	Wynder, correct?
14	A. That's correct.
15	Q. And he was describing his famous mouse
16	skin-painting study, which we -- you referred to
17	yesterday and we talked a little bit about this
18	morning, correct?
19	A. That's correct.
20	Q. And those particular clips you did not choose
21	to show yesterday during your presentation; isn't that
22	right?
23	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
24	THE WITNESS: We did not show those
25	yesterday.
0356
1	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
2	Q. Okay. All right. Let's show another clip.
3	This is from CBS news coverage of the 1964 surgeon
4	general's report and Harry Reasoner, who you talked
5	about yesterday.
6	MR. ACOSTA: I've got the same rule of
7	completeness request, that have the whole thing
8	shown if you're going to show the witness these
9	other parts.
10	(Brief discussion off the record.)
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay. Let's go.
12	(A video clip was played.)
13	THE NARRATOR: This is a CBS News Extra on
14	smoking and health, the findings of the surgeon
15	general's committee.
16	MR. REASONER: Almost from the moment that
17	cigarettes were introduced, they were attacked.
18	But the attacks took a new turn ten years ago and
19	culminated in today's report by the surgeon
20	general's committee. This, in summary, is what
21	the committee says. Cigarette smoking is a major
22	cause of lung cancer in men, and data on women
23	smokers points the same way. Cigarette smoking is
24	a significant cause of cancer of the larynx and
25	probably the most important cause of chronic
0357
1	bronchitis. Cigarette smoking may be related to
2	other lung diseases.
3	Male smokers have a much higher death rate
4	from heart disease; although, it's not proven that
5	smoking is the cause. On the question of filters,
6	the committee says there is no evidence that they
7	do any good, but it didn't exclude the possibility
8	that an effective filter might be developed.
9	In short, the committee says if you smoke
10	cigarettes, you increase your chances of dying
11	early. The sooner you start, the more you smoke,
12	the more you inhale, the worse your chances are.
13	In this kind of a country, it comes down to
14	you, whether you like it or not. No one is going
15	to forbid an adult to smoke, and it is now quite
16	clear that no one is going to tell him it's good
17	for him either. The decision is his, the decision
18	and the health that may depend on it.
19	This is Harry Reasoner. Good night.
20	THE NARRATOR: This has been a CBS News Extra
21	on smoking and health.
22	(End of video clip.)
23	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
24	Q. Okay. That was Harry Reasoner talking on the
25	video we just saw, correct?
0358
1	A. That's right.
2	Q. You mentioned him yesterday as being a very
3	famous news anchor for CBS News?
4	A. That's right.
5	Q. And the part we just showed was the very end
6	of that special report on smoking and health, correct?
7	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
8	THE WITNESS: Yeah. The ending of the
9	program. Although, the -- the -- there was a part
10	missing, but, yeah.
11	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
12	Q. Was there a particular part missing?
13	A. Well, doesn't he at the end talk about
14	cigarettes like an old friend: You keep giving them
15	one -- one more chance.
16	Q. You think there is another clip at the very
17	end of that?
18	A. As part of the ending part, yeah. But that's
19	the end of the program. I will accept that.
20	Q. That's the end --
21	A. I'm not trying to make trouble.
22	Q. That's the end of the program, correct?
23	A. Yeah.
24	Q. Okay. And you chose not to show that part of
25	the video clip yesterday in response to the questions
0359
1	from Mr. Acosta, correct?
2	A. No. We were focusing on the industry's
3	messages.
4	Q. Okay. Now, the third thing we -- that I
5	mentioned was the movie "Need To Know." Do you recall
6	that?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. Have you seen the whole movie?
9	A. Yes, I have.
10	Q. Okay. And you know that one of the
11	individuals who appeared in the movie is E. Cuyler
12	Hammond?
13	A. In "Need To Know"?
14	Q. Yeah. Did you know that?
15	A. It's been a long time since I've seen it. I
16	have it on videotape. Just refresh my memory on that,
17	if you've got the transcript or --
18	Q. You don't recall whether Dr. Hammond actually
19	appeared in the video?
20	A. I have to refresh my memory on that. It's
21	been a long time since I watched the whole thing.
22	Q. Okay. Do you recall if Dr. Hammond actually
23	talked about his own work and the fact that they found
24	that twice as many smokers died of heart disease as
25	nonsmokers? Do you recall that at all?
0360
1	A. Again, if you've got the transcript, let me
2	just skim through it to remind myself, and then I can
3	answer all your questions authoritatively, and --
4	Q. You've watched the whole video?
5	A. Yes, I have it on VHS tape.
6	Q. Let me just show you. I'll let you take a
7	look at it, but I just want to --
8	A. Really, I just need to remind myself.
9	That's --
10	MR. ACOSTA: Can I see what you're showing
11	him so I can look at it, too?
12	THE WITNESS: Yeah.
13	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm not going to mark it.
14	THE WITNESS: I will let you look at it
15	first, and then I will look at it.
16	MR. GERAGHTY: Am I getting in the way?
17	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: No.
18	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm just going to ask him if
19	Mr. Hammond appeared on the program. That's all
20	I'm going to ask.
21	MR. ACOSTA: Well, I know, but -
22	MR. GERAGHTY: That's all.
23	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. But-
24	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm not going to-
25	MR. ACOSTA: -- I'm going to have a rule
0361
1	of --
2	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm not going to read from the
3	transcript.
4	THE WITNESS: I just want to -
5	MR. ACOSTA: Well -
6	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm just going to ask him a
7	question.
8	MR. ACOSTA: All right.
9	THE WITNESS: And - and -
10	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. Okay.
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Let's see how it goes.
12	MR. ACOSTA: Well, I'm going to -
13	THE WITNESS: Since this whole thing was
14	my -- let me get my --
15	MR. ACOSTA: If you show it to him, I'm going
16	to ask that that be marked and attached as an
17	exhibit to the deposition.
18	THE WITNESS: Since I was the one that asked
19	for it, let me have a look. Okay. I remember
20	this now. Yeah. Okay. This is --
21	MR. ACOSTA: If you would just mark it for
22	identification.
23	MR. GERAGHTY: Yeah. We'll mark this for
24	identification as --
25	THE WITNESS: Yes, that's fine, and -
0362
1	MR. GERAGHTY: We'll pick a number.
2	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
3	Q. All right. Doctor, my question is very
4	simple. You showed a small segment of this movie "Need
5	To Know," correct?
6	A. The introduction.
7	Q. All right. And on that program,
8	Dr. E. Cuyler Hammond appeared, did he not?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. All right. And we talked about him earlier.
11	Dr. E. Cuyler Hammond was -- if not the head, he was
12	the chief researcher of the American Cancer Society,
13	correct?
14	A. That's right.
15	Q. And -
16	MR. ACOSTA: Can I interrupt for a second?
17	MR. GERAGHTY: Sure.
18	MR. ACOSTA: Because I want to also object
19	that I would ask that the entire show be shown
20	under the rule of completeness so that that goes
21	in context.
22	MR. GERAGHTY: You could have shown it during
23	your direct.
24	MR. ACOSTA: No. That has nothing to do with
25	it.
0363
1	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
2	Q. Okay. Well, my question, simply, Doctor, is
3	when you showed the video clip, you did not show the
4	passages that featured Dr. E. Cuyler Hammond, did you?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. Okay.
7	MR. ACOSTA: I'm going to need that for
8	redirect --
9	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay.
10	MR. ACOSTA: -- so don't lose it.
11	MR. GERAGHTY: All right. I won't lose it,
12	Howard. There you go.
13	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
14	Q. Now, yesterday, you talked about some public
15	service announcements and something called the Fairness
16	Doctrine.
17	Do you recall that?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. And the public service announcements were
20	television infomercials, so to speak, that were
21	produced by a number of different public health
22	organizations, correct?
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. They were published by the American Cancer
25	Society, right?
0364
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. The American Lung Association, right?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And the American Heart Association, correct?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. And if I recall what you said yesterday, you
7	said those ads were pretty effective, correct?
8	A. Yes, they were effective.
9	Q. All right. And what you meant by that was
10	they were effective in communicating to the American
11	public the dangers of cigarette smoking, right?
12	A. That's what I meant.
13	Q. Okay. Now, you talked about this Fairness
14	Doctrine. I just want to make sure that we're clear.
15	The Fairness Doctrine was not created for cigarette
16	advertisements specifically, was it?
17	A. No, no. That was not -- that's not --1
18	mean, that's an accurate statement that you make. It
19	was not created just for cigarette advertisements.
20	Q. Well, yesterday, did you not testify -- let
21	me withdraw that question.
22	You said yesterday that the American Lung
23	Association, the American Heart Association, and the
24	American Cancer Society had to sue so that a Fairness
25	Doctrine would be applied to smoking.
0365
1	A. Yes. That -- that's accurate. I mean, more
2	completely, with John Banzhaf, the particular attorney
3	who handled the litigation, I mean, the story is widely
4	known.
5	Q. Okay.
6	A. But, yes, it was a pre-existing doctrine that
7	that was then applied to cigarette advertising.
8	Q. Right. So let's make sure we're clear. The
9	Fairness Doctrine was created before the issue of
10	cigarette advertisements came up, correct?
11	A. That's right. It was not something created.
12	Q. It was not created for cigarette
13	advertisements, right?
14	A. No. It was applied to, as I said in my
15	testimony.
16	Q. Okay. So if you, yesterday, suggested to the
17	jury that it was created for the cigarette
18	advertisements, that's not accurate, correct?
19	A. Reread what I said and just --1 think I said
20	it right. I think I was --
21	Q. Well, it's kind of hard. It says, Public
22	health groups like the American Lung Association, the
23	American Heart Association, and the American Cancer
24	Society were able to sufficiently sue so that a
25	Fairness Doctrine provision would be applied to the
0366
1	issue of smoking and health.
2	A. Yes. Application to, not created.
3	Q. Okay.
4	A. I think that's -- that's good.
5	Q. Okay. Let's be clear. The doctrine was
6	created before this issue came up, right --
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. -- not --
9	A. Yes, yes.
10	Q. Okay. It was not created for cigarette
11	advertisements, correct?
12	A. No, no. The action applied it to cigarette
13	advertisements.
14	Q. Okay. Now, you also said that the tobacco
15	companies voluntarily took their ads off the air,
16	right?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. And they did, didn't they? That's true?
19	A. That's why I said it.
20	Q. Okay. But what you didn't tell the jury
21	yesterday was that they agreed to do so after
22	legislation had been proposed both by the Federal Trade
23	Commission and members of Congress to ban cigarette
24	advertisements on television, right?
25	A. Well, I did mention that -- that legislation
0367
1	also was involved in this.
2	Q. My recollection of what you said yesterday
3	was, ultimately, there was a law passed after the
4	tobacco companies voluntarily agreed to take their
5	advertisements off television that enacted that ban
6	into law, right?
7	A. Yes. Soon after, about six months after.
8	Q. Okay. But my point, Doctor, is the
9	legislation that would have made that a law had been
10	proposed before the tobacco companies voluntarily
11	agreed to do so, correct?
12	A. Oh, yes.
13	Q. So there were already calls by members of
14	Congress and the federal government to ban cigarette
15	advertisements before cigarette companies agreed to
16	that voluntary act; isn't that true?
17	A. Yes. I mean, the calls to remove cigarette
18	advertising from the air waves and other places had --
19	goes back even farther than that.
20	Q. And the FTC had actually issued an advisory
21	opinion suggesting that there ought to be a law passed
22	to ban cigarette ads on television?
23	A. The FTC supported that, that's -- yes, that's
24	true.
25	Q. And that occurred before the tobacco
0368
1	companies agree; isn't that right?
2	A. Yes, that's true.
3	Q. All right. Now, yesterday, you said that the
4	public service announcements came off the air after the
5	cigarette ads were banned?
6	A. What I said was that the linkage between the
7	Fairness Doctrine --or the Fairness Doctrine linkage
8	was broken when the industry ads came off the air.
9	Q. The specific question Mr. Acosta asked you
10	yesterday was: And were they successful in having
11	those public service announcements removed from
12	television?
13	ANSWER: They were successful.
14	That's not true, is it?
15	MR. ACOSTA: I need to-
16	THE WITNESS: Read the whole -
17	MR. ACOSTA: I need to object to the form of
18	that question.
19	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay. You can object.
20	MR. ACOSTA: And I would also request that --
21	he just asked you to read the whole thing, if you
22	read --1 would like you to read it in context.
23	THE WITNESS: What I made clear to
24	Mr. Acosta, as he was asking me the questions,
25	was -- the key issue was the provision of free
0369
1	space -- or I should say free air time, that was
2	created by the Fairness Doctrine. That linkage
3	was broken.
4	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
5	Q. Well, let's just be clear. If you suggested
6	that public service announcements came off the air
7	after tobacco advertisements came off television,
8	that's not accurate, right?
9	A. Right. They could still be shown after the
10	industry removed its -- its television commercials.
11	What -- the key point is, is the linkage that the
12	Fairness Doctrine created by creating free air time
13	under the Fairness Doctrine. And I would--1 was very
14	clear. I had to explain that during those sets of
15	questions, and it's in the transcript.
16	Q. I think the record will reflect whether you
17	were clear or not. But so we are clear today, you
18	agree those public service announcements continued to
19	be aired on television here in the United States long
20	after cigarette ads were banned, right?
21	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
22	THE WITNESS: Right, right. The end of the
23	Fairness Doctrine did not bar those ads from
24	appearing on TV. What they did is break down the
25	linkage that the Fairness Doctrine had which
0370
1	provided free air time.
2	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
3	Q. Right. So, essentially, what happened was
4	once cigarette ads were banned from television, there
5	was no longer any free air time, correct?
6	A. Yes, as the -- as the Fairness Doctrine
7	provided it. I mean, other people were free to donate
8	air time. I mean, you might find a case of that,
9	but as the Fairness Doctrine linkage provided.
10	Q. And you know from your own historical
11	research that the American Cancer Society, the U.S.
12	Public Health Service, the American Heart Association,
13	and the American Lung Association continued to create
14	and publish these public service announcements, right?
15	A. Yes. They continued to try to educate the
16	American public about the dangers of smoking, and --
17	Q. Did they not --
18	MR. ACOSTA: Wait, wait. I think you
19	interrupted him.
20	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
21	Q. Okay.
22	A. Yeah. I was not saying that they were barred
23	from educating the American public through television
24	and other means.
25	Q. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that
0371
1	the public service announcements that you talked to
2	Mr. Acosta about yesterday from the American Heart
3	Association, the American Cancer Society, and the
4	American Lung Association continued to be aired on
5	television long after tobacco advertisements were
6	banned from television, correct?
7	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
8	THE WITNESS: That's correct. But just --
9	just so you're clear, the linkage with the
10	Fairness Doctrine was the key element. You had,
11	basically, a four-to-one ratio of tobacco ads to
12	public service announcements, which was quite --
13	quite extensive. So the Fairness Doctrine created
14	a space for these ads to appear quite extensively.
15	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
16	Q. Doctor, did the public announcements continue
17	to be aired on television after cigarette ads were
18	banned, yes or no?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Thank you. We're going to play a couple of
21	those for you. We're going to try to play a couple of
22	those for you.
23	MR. GARDNER: Shutting down is not good.
24	MS. FOOS: No.
25	THE WITNESS: It's -- it's the camera, not
0372
1	the computer.
2	MR. GERAGHTY: Oh, okay.
3	THE WITNESS: There is a remote control.
4	It's a Sharp video camera --1 mean, projector.
5	(Discussion off the record.)
6	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: I will go off until this
7	comes up.
8	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay.
9	(Brief recess was taken.)
10	(A video clip was played.)
11	MR. DICKERSON: I'm Eric Dickerson. And I'm
12	going to show you something that could save your
13	life. Now, say these footballs are your lungs.
14	Every time you smoke, you can damage your lungs
15	with every puff. Day after day, year after year,
16	your lungs can get more and more damaged until,
17	finally, they may not breathe at all. Your lungs
18	could end up useless. So don't smoke. Keep your
19	lungs full of clean and fresh air. Take care of
20	your lungs. They're only human.
21	THE NARRATOR: The American Lung Association,
22	the Christmas Seal people.
23	(End of video clip.)
24	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
25	Q. Okay. Do you know the athlete who appeared
0373
1	in that ad?
2	A. Eric Dickerson, the football player.
3	Q. Right. And he was a very well-known, popular
4	football player in the eighties and nineties, correct?
5	A. That's right.
6	Q. And had you ever seen that public service
7	announcement before?
8	A. Yeah, I had seen that one before.
9	Q. And you saw at the very end it was produced
10	by the American Lung Association?
11	A. That's right.
12	Q. Just like you talked about yesterday, public
13	health groups used athletes and celebrities and movie
14	stars to promote their anti-smoking message, correct?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. Okay. And these -- these public service
17	announcements continued to be played after cigarette
18	ads were banned in the seventies, eighties, right on up
19	until today, correct?
20	A. That's true.
21	Q. Okay.
22	MR. ACOSTA: Just so we can put it on the
23	record, I don't show getting that one.
24	MR. GERAGHTY: Well, if that's - if you're
25	right about that, I will cut it.
0374
1	MR. ACOSTA: Okay.
2	MR. GERAGHTY: I will agree to cut it.
3	Let's show the next one, please.
4	(A video clip was played.)
5	MR. HAGMAN: Do you know what would happen if
6	you stopped smoking cigarettes right now, right
7	this minute? Well, I'll tell you what would
8	happen. Your lungs would immediately start to
9	repair themselves. Even if you've been smoking
10	for years and years, once you stop assaulting your
11	lungs, it's only a matter of time before they're
12	healthy and in the pink again. Now you have every
13	reason in the world to stop smoking cigarettes,
14	because now you know what will happen if you do
15	and what will happen if you don't.
16	(End of video clip.)
17	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
18	Q. Do you recognize the gentleman from the
19	public service announcement?
20	A. I do.
21	Q. It's Larry Hagman?
22	A. That's right.
23	Q. And he originally became popular on "I Dream
24	of Jeannie," correct?
25	A. That's right.
0375
1	Q. It's a sitcom in the late 1960s?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And then later on he played J.R. Ewing in the
4	series Dallas, right?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. A very popular evening series that played in
7	the 1980s, correct?
8	A. That's right.
9	Q. And this was produced by the American Cancer
10	Society, right?
11	A. That's correct.
12	Q. And so public health organizations like the
13	American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association,
14	the American Heart Association used celebrities like
15	Larry Hagman to promote their anti-smoking message,
16	correct?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. And they continued to air these public
19	service announcements long after cigarette
20	advertisements had been banned from television,
21	correct?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. All right. We will show you one more.
24	(A video clip was played.)
25	THE NARRATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, the late
0376
1	Yul Brynner.
2	MR. BRYNNER: I really wanted to make a
3	commercial when I discovered that I was that sick
4	and my time was so limited. I wanted to make a
5	commercial that says, simply, now that I'm gone, I
6	tell you, don't smoke. Whatever you do, just
7	don't smoke. If I could take back that smoking,
8	we wouldn't be talking about any cancer. I'm
9	convinced of that.
10	(End of video clip.)
11	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
12	Q. And you recognize the gentleman who appeared
13	in that particular public service announcement, right?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. That was Yul Brynner?
16	A. That's right.
17	Q. And he was a famous actor, correct?
18	A. That's correct.
19	Q. He played in the movie Moses with Charlton
20	Heston?
21	A. That's right.
22	Q. And he was also in The King and I?
23	A. Yes. Although, technically, it's called the
24	Ten Commandments.
25	Q. You're right; it is the Ten Commandments.
0377
1	And as the video clip showed, he died in
2	1985, correct?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And that clip was filmed before he died of
5	lung cancer, right?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. And that was aired after his death, correct?
8	A. That's right.
9	Q. And -- so that was aired after 1985, correct?
10	A. That's right.
11	Q. And public service announcements like that
12	one continued to air on television here in the United
13	States into the eighties and the nineties and right on
14	up until today, correct?
15	A. That's correct.
16	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay. Let's take our lunch
