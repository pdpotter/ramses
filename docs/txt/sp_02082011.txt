EXAMINATION
8
9
BY MR. BASS:
name is Hardee Bass.
Q.
Good morning, Dr. Hoff.
We've never met.
I'm from the law

My
And we
How are you this morning?
13 A. I'm good.
14 Q. I know you've been deposed a number of times,
Thank you.
15 so I'll dispense with kind of the rules of the road and
16 just mention a couple of things.
Whenever you need to
17 take a break, just let me know.
Obviously we're on the
18 phone, and so there are certain challenges.
19 you all loud and clear.
20 me.
21 know and I'll be happy to repeat the question.
22 my best not to interrupt any of your answers with a
23 question.
24 if that happens, just kind of let me know.
25
I can hear
And I think you all can hear
But at any time I come across muffled, just let me
A.
I'll do
And we'll deal with that as it comes up.
And
Okay?
Yes, I will.
6
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

(212) 490-34301
Q.
And I don't know how long we're going to be.
2 know it's 10:00 where you all are.
3 lunch break by ear whenever it comes time for that.
4 Okay?
5 A. That's fine.
6 Q. Very good.
7
So we'll just play a
Dr. Hoff, if you could, tell me if you brought
8 anything with you to your deposition today.
9 what did you bring with you?
10
A.
depositions in the case.
12 for the case.
14
Q.
I brought an invoice I have
And I brought my curriculum vitae.
The notes that you brought with you, is that a
copy of the notes you have or is that the original?
15 A.
16 and scanned.
17 Q.
18
And if so,
I brought the notes from -- I took from the
11
13
I
I have the original notes, but they were copied
Okay.
Excellent.
And the reason I ask is because I would like to
19 make that Exhibit 1 to the deposition, if possible.
20 if you can mark that for me, it would be much
21 appreciated.
22 (Exhibit 1 was marked for identification.)
23 MS. BROWN:
And
Mr. Bass, if you give me your
24 e-mail address, I do have them scanned, I can forward
25 them by e-mail to you.

Not EY?
CY, correct.
THB?
I'll send it now.
And I'll
10 tell you on the other items that Dr. Hoff mentioned she
11 has, we're having scanned now.
12 but as soon as I get the scan, I'll forward those
13 materials to you, as well.
14
15
MR. BASS:
I don't have those yet,
That would be much appreciated.
Thank you very much.
16
I actually have Dr. Hoff's CV.
17 2011, and it's 31 pages.
18 then you can send that.
19 need to send that.
20 THE DEPONENT:
21 MR. BASS:
It says April
If it's a more recent one,
If she doesn't, then you don't
There is a more recent one.
Okay.
Well, then I would like to
22 see that.
23 those.
24 about those.
25 the case, just while we're talking about it, if we can
And I appreciate it.
And I'll look for
And when I get them, we can talk specifically
So I'll move on from that.
The invoice in
8
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
mark that as Exhibit 2.
2 (Exhibit 2 was marked for identification.)
3 MS. BROWN:
If we can just wait one minute.
4 you give me one minute, I can go ahead and send these
5 things to you from my Blackberry.
6
7
MR. BASS:
Okay.
If
Do you want to go off the
record for a moment and we can do that?
8 MS. BROWN:
9 MR. BASS:
Yes, let's do.
Thank you very much.
10 (Off the record.)
11 MR. BASS:
Thank you very much, Ms. Brown for
12 that accommodation.
13 for the case as Exhibit 2 and Dr. Hoff's CV as Exhibit
14 3, that would be much appreciated.
And if we could mark the invoice
15 (Exhibit 3 was marked for identification.)
16 MS. BROWN:
We're going to mark the CV after
17 the break because the copy I have right now is also
18 copied every other page.
19
BY MR. BASS:
Q.
Dr. Hoff, if you could just
20 tell me, Exhibit 2 is an invoice for this case.
21 many pages is it?
22 A. It's just one page.
23 Q. And I understand from reading previous
How
24 testimony that your hourly rate for your work in these
25 cases is $250?
9
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. That's correct.
2 Q. And that's your hourly rate in this case?
3 A. True.
4 Q. The invoice, what does the invoice reflect?
5 A. It reflects my reading of the depositions in
6
this case primarily.
7 Q. And how many hours are billed on that invoice?
8 A. 13-plus hours.
9 Q. And over what period of time does that 13-plus
10
hours represent?
11 A. From, let's see, May 6 to June 5.
12 Q. Do you have any invoices that you submitted for
13
any work done in this case prior to May 6?
14 A. No, I haven't.
15 Q. So am I correct, then, that starting May 6, or
16 starting with this invoice, this is the -- the 13-plus
17 hours is the only work you've done specifically in the
18 Buchanan case up to today?
19
A.
No, that's not correct.
I've done additional
20 work, but I have not yet submitted an invoice for that
21 work.
22
23
Q.
Okay.
So then that would be work done from
June 5 or June 6 up until today, correct?
24 A. Correct.
25 Q. How many hours of work have you done during
10
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
that time period?
2
A.
I've estimated that it comes out roughly
3 between 16, 17 hours since then.
4 now.
5
Q.
Maybe as many as 18
So the invoice, which is Exhibit 2, which is
6 for roughly 13 hours, 13-plus hours from May 6 to June 5
7 that constitutes your reading of the depositions in this
8 case?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. The 17 hours or so that you've estimated as to
11 work you've done from June 5 up until this morning, what
12 does that 17 hours represent?
13
14
15
A.
Again, primarily my review of research on
newspapers that were relevant to the case.
Q.
And when you say "review of research on
16 newspapers," does that constitute the actual research of
17 the newspapers or does that simply constitute reviewing
18 the newspapers that you already had in your possession?
19
20
21
22
23
A.
No.
This is -- it would have been original
research on the newspapers in this particular case.
Q.
And we're going to talk about, obviously, the
newspapers and the research that was done later on.
So that, by my calculation, up until today the
24 start of the deposition you have around 30 hours give or
25 take an hour or two in the case?
11
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Yes, that's correct.
2 Q. Your rate of $250 an hour change when giving
3
testimony, whether it be deposition or trial testimony?
4 A. No, it does not.
5 Q. It's a steady rate of $250 an hour regardless
6
of what you're doing in the case, right?
7 A. That's correct.
8 Q. I'll have some questions about your CV later
9
when I'm able to get a copy of it.
10
MR. BASS:
I'm not sure, Ms. Brown, if you also
11 have with you a copy of the amended notice of taking
12 telephonic deposition deuces tecum.
13 you're willing to mark that as an exhibit.
14 MS. BROWN:
15 MR. BASS:
16
If you do, if
Sure.
Thank you very much.
And I guess
we'll mark that as Exhibit 4.
17 (Exhibit 4 was marked for identification.)
18 BY MR. BASS:
Q.
Dr. Hoff, you've told us what
19 you brought along with you to the deposition.
20 don't want to spend too much time on it.
21 to run through Schedule A to the notice of telephonic
22 deposition duces tecum, and see if although you didn't
23 bring any of those things with you, if any of those
24 things.
25
And I
But I'd like
And we'll start with number one.
Do you have the Exhibit 4 Schedule A in front
12
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
of you, Dr. Hoff?
2 A. Yes, I do.
3 Q. Number one says, "Any and all data, documents,
4 papers, photographs, files and video tapes, memoranda or
5 other writing prepared by you pursuant to your work
6 employment in this case."
7
8
And you have given me what we've marked as
Exhibit 1, which are your notes in this case, correct?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. Is there anything else that you have in your
11
possession responsive to number one?
12 A. No.
13 Q. Let's talk for a moment, if we can, about
14 Exhibit 1, which are your notes in this case.
15 look at the first page, just so I get some idea because
16 it's probably formatted from early going through.
17
So looking at the first page.
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. There's a lot of information on here.
20
We'll
Obviously this is your handwriting, correct?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. And --
23 A. Unfortunately.
24 Q. At the top it says something in the far right
25 corner.
I can't make it out.
But it looks like it's a
13
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Lorillard case.
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. What does that mean?
4 A. As I read the depositions I was under the
What do you mean by that?
5 impression that the case might have been primarily a
6 Lorillard case given the cigarettes mentioned that the
7 decedent smoked.
8 to myself.
9
Q.
And so I put that down as a reminder
Does that fact, the fact that you believe it to
10 be a Lorillard case, does that have any impact on your
11 ultimate opinion on this case?
12
A.
No.
It's just a reference for my own
13 information later on in determining which cigarettes he
14 smoked primarily.
15
Q.
Does the cigarette that the decedent in this
16 case, Mr. Buchanan, smoked, does the brand of the
17 cigarette have any impact on your ultimate opinions in
18 this case?
19 A. No.
20 Q. Under that it says, "Nan Kathryn Buchanan," it
21
looks like it gives a date, March 3, 2001, 160 pages?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. I'm assuming, and correct me if I'm wrong, if
24 that's meant to represent these are your notes from Nan
25 Kathryn Buchanan's deposition, right?
14
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Yes.
2 Q. Which was taken on March 3, 2011, right?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. And it was 150 pages in length, right?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. And then down underneath where you've written
The first volume.
7 "Nan," going vertically down the page, it has numbers.
8 For example, the first one is 18, then there's 25, 26.
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. Would I be correct in assuming that those are
11 the page numbers from the deposition that you then
12 subsequently recorded notes from?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. And then would that system, for lack of a
15
better word, continue throughout the deposition?
16 A. Yes, that's correct.
17 Q. Excuse me.
18
Throughout your notes pertain to
each subsequent deposition, I'm sorry.
19 A. That's correct.
20 Q. I want to see if there's anything else I need
21 to ask you about.
22 And then obviously -- strike that.
23
24
25
No, it looks pretty self-explanatory.
What are these notes contained in Exhibit 1?
What do they represent?
A.
My notes taken in various depositions in the
15
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
3
case.
Q.
When you read a deposition do you make any
notations on the deposition itself?
4 A. No, I don't.
5 Q. So you start with a blank piece of paper, you
6 write kind of the biographical information, the person's
7 name, the date the deposition was taken, the number of
8 pages.
9 interesting page or passage, you write down the page,
10
And then as you go through you come to an
the passage, and then you keep on reading, right?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. And you were provided with all of the -- you're
13 retained by the law firm Shook Hardy & Bacon in this
14 case, right?
15 MS. BROWN:
16 THE DEPONENT:
17
For my opinions and general
awareness, yes.
18
19
Object to form.
BY MR. BASS:
Q.
Are there any opinions
besides general awareness that you expect to give?
20 A. No, I don't.
21 Q. Is there any other law firm that has retained
22 you to provide testimony in this case, other than the
23 Shook Hardy & Bacon law firm?
24
25
A.
No.
MS. BROWN:
Object to form.
16

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

(212) 490-34301
2
BY MR. BASS:
Q.
You received the depositions
in this case, correct?
3 A. Yes, I did.
4 Q. And did you receive them electronically or in
5
hard copy format?
6 A. Hard copy.
7 Q. And so just so I'm clear, as you're reading
8 them and taking your notes, you didn't make any
9 notations on the depositions themselves, on the hard
10
copies you received, correct?
11 A. That's correct.
12 Q. Is there anything not contained -- from a
13 factual standpoint, from testimony from a fact witness
14 in this case, is there anything to your knowledge not
15 contained within these notes that you base your opinions
16 on in this case, vis-a-vis the fact deposition?
17 MS. BROWN:
18 THE DEPONENT:
Object to form.
As far as I understand the
19 question, the notes are complete with respect to what I
20 thought were important facts or opinions in the
21 depositions.
22
BY MR. BASS:
Q.
And because of the length of
23 these, obviously we're not going to go through each page
24 and everything.
25 correct, then, in assuming that what you thought was
But if I look at this later, I would be
17
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 important to your opinions in the case, you jotted down
2 here on Exhibit 1 in your notes, right?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. We'll go back to Exhibit 4, which is the notice
5 of taking telephonic deposition.
6 all photographs viewed taken by you -- by or for you in
7 connection with this case.
8
9
Number two asks for
Do you have any photographs pertaining to this
case?
10 A. No, I don't.
11 Q. Number three asks for copies of all statements,
12 written or recorded, which you have examined in
13 connection with this case.
14
15
You reviewed the depositions in the case,
right?
16
17
18
A. Right.
Q. Okay.
I assumed it was the same as number
one.
Anything else that you reviewed in
19 connection with the case that you think is responsive to
20 number three?
21 A. No.
22 Q. Number four asks for all published professional
23 standards or guidelines used or referred to by you in
24 formulating your opinion in connection with this case.
25 So let me just ask a question about that.
I've read
18
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 some of your testimony in the past, and you've described
2 your methodology in formulating your opinions, correct?
3 MS. BROWN:
4 THE DEPONENT:
5 BY MR. BASS:
Object to form.
That's correct.
Q.
If you could, just summarily
6 or generally, tell me about the methodology that you use
7 in formulating your opinion in this case?
8
9
A.
Well, in this case it would be, again, the use
of material that would show general awareness about the
10 health hazardous of smoking or the addictive nature of
11 cigarettes.
12 that would consist primarily of the depositions I've
13 read.
14 general national review that I do of newspapers and
15 magazines that aren't simply local to the state of
16 Michigan or to the state of Florida.
17
And consequently, for this specific case
But also the newspapers that I read.
Q.
And the
And what I've read in the past is kind of a
18 little more mechanical than that.
19 beginning where you might explain that you were given a
20 topic to research and then kind of the steps that you
21 followed once you were given the topic to research.
22 Maybe we can just kind of start there.
23 A. Yeah, that's fine.
24 Q. Okay.
25
MS. BROWN:
It started from the
Object to form.
19
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
THE DEPONENT:
I mean, the topic is to
2 determine what kind of general awareness was out there
3 on the subject of the risks of smoking and the
4 difficulty people might have in quitting once they
5 started to smoke.
6
That's the question.
And then in this case, what I was trying to do
7 was accumulate data that was readily available to the
8 general public on the subject.
9 have very generally looked at national publications and
And that's why I would
10 magazines and newspapers.
11 have looked at the educational materials that the
12 decedent would have encountered in the school system in
13 Michigan.
14 newspapers that he read.
15 newspaper he read once he moved to Florida.
16
But in particular, I would
I would have then looked at Michigan
And also then looked at
In addition, of course, I would have been
17 looking at the activities, since I'm looking back at the
18 20th Century in doing this research.
19 looked at the activities of reform groups who were quite
20 active in the first part of that century in speaking out
21 against and writing pamphlets against smoking.
22
I would have
And then, of course, I would also have tried to
23 see how far down into the popular culture this type of
24 general awareness information seeped.
25 kind of slang terms were used to describe the health
That is, what

(212) 490-34301 risks of smoking, and the addictive nature of smoking.
2 I would have then looked at, of course, popular songs
3 and jokes which contained some of these slang terms.
4 And later on, of course, looked at movies and
5 television, and ultimately, of course, at television.
6
So in general, then, what I do in trying to
7 conduct whether it's called social and cultural research
8 is to build up a body of information, a database that
9 contains easily accessible, reliable information that
10 was in the public domain that the average person would
11 have come across, either through reading, through
12 viewing or in some instances through an educational
13 system.
14 information is gathered, I try to deduce from it some
15 general trends or patterns of information that are there
16 and considered reliable and accessible sources.
17
And from that point, then, after this

22 notice?
23 A.
25
There might only have been a notice of a WebEx
review that was going to take place.
21
24
I
I'm sorry.
The first thing you said was
Well, an e-mail giving me the date and time of
the WebEx review.
Q.
What's a WebEx review?
30
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. It's a review of the resource materials.
2 Q. I'm not sure I can conceptualize what you're
3 talking about.
4 What do you mean a review of the resource materials?
5
A.
I know what the resource materials are.
On the monitor I'm able to see the complete
6 list of the resource materials.
7 see if they're accurate with respect to what I had
8 requested in this case or what represents my general
9 review of information on the subject matter of smoking
10
11
And to go over them to
and cigarettes and addiction.
Q.
12
I see.
So was it a kind of a video conference, was it
13 something where via the Internet or the computer you
14 could see the person on the other end that you were
15 talking to?
16
17
18
19
A.
Is that what a WebEx refers to?
No.
It refers to the document itself, which is
on the screen.
Q.
So the document was on the screen, and you
reviewed the resource material?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. And were you talking to anyone while you did,
22
23
24
25
or was it just what you did individually?
A.
No.
I would have been talking on the phone, as
well.
Q.
I see.

Okay.
I understand.
Thank
you.
8
And when did that WebEx take place?
9 A. That was on June 3.
10 Q. How long was it?
11 A. It looks like it went for about an hour.
12 Q. And the way you answered that question would
13 lead me to believe that that's contained on your
14 invoice, that WebEx?
15 A. Yes, it is.
16 Q. Okay.
17
I see.
All right.
You said that an e-mail was exchanged, or you
18 thought an e-mail might have been exchanged.
19 the substance of that e-mail?
What was
20 A. Simply the date and time of the WebEx review.
21 Q. When were you initially contacted to work on
22
23
this particular case, Buchanan case?

But you think your initial contact was pretty
3 close in time to when you began your initial research on
4 this case?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. How were you initially contacted to work on
7
this case?
8 A. It would have been a contact by telephone.
9 Q. You received depositions in the case, right?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. You've received hard copies of the depositions,
12
right?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. I presume those were sent to you -- well,

How were those sent to you?
17 A. They were sent FedEx to Montana.
18 Q. Was there a cover letter or anything
19
accompanying or enclosed in the FedEx?
20 A. No.
21 Q. So as far as written communication, that e-mail
22 which was talking about the WebEx, that's the only

I appreciate that.
It's been marked as

19 defendant during the past three years.
20 you about that later on, so we'll skip that.
21
I'm going to ask
And also, all lists of cases in which you've
22 testified in expert trial and deposition, which you
23 comply pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure 26,
24 any similar state rule or any court order.

We've talked

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Have you provided testimony any other types of
2 litigation in your career besides the tobacco related
3 litigation that we talked about?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. And on how many occasions?
6 A. Just one.
7 Q. And I think I read about that before, and it
8 sounded very interesting.
9 what type of case or proceeding was that?
10
A.
But if you could just tell me
It was a case involving a Nixon estate suit
11 against the National Archives concerning the value of
12 the Nixon papers, which were about to turned over to a

I'm going
Okay.
Q.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Dr. Hoff, how did you first
become involved in reviewing for litigation purposes
36
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
issues of smoking and health in America?
2 A. I become involved back in 1994, '95.
3 Q. And how did you become initially involved?
4 A. I received a phone call asking me whether I
5 would be interested personally, or whether my graduate
6 students would be interested in doing some culturally
7 social history research on the subject of smoking.
8 again, as it got more specific, on the hazards of
9 smoking and the risk involved in smoking, including the
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
And
risk of becoming addicted.
Q.
Do you recall who originally contacted you back
in the 1994, 1995 time frame?
A.
It was an individual named Alan Purvis
(phonetic).
Q.
And where was Alan Purvis?
with anybody, do you know?
A.
Was he associated
Or...
As far as I know, he was working out of
Washington D.C.
19 Q. Was he a lawyer?
20 A. I don't know that.
21 Q. Was he associated with any law firm or anything
22
like that, if you know?
23 A. I don't recall at this point.
24 Q. Did you ever find out how Mr. Purvis ended up
25
with your name and contact information?
37
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
3
A.
I think he might have mentioned that another
historian had given him my name.
Q.
Ultimately, did you find on whose behalf
4 Mr. Purvis was calling you about -- calling you on,
5 excuse me.
6
7
8
9
10
11
A.
Well, ultimately there was a case, I think it
was the Rogers case in Indiana.
Q.
So your initial contact, then, was it to
research generally or was it for work in a specific
litigation case?
A.
Initially it was to do general, social and
12 cultural history research on the subject matter of
13 smoking, health hazards, and addiction.
14
15
Q.
And then later on it became forensic work in a
particular case, right?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. The cases that you worked -- and then I guess
18 kind of the way your testimony is in this case and what
19 I read in the past, there's kind of two identifiable
20 time periods.
21 testifying, right?
There's up to 2001 where you did some
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. And then within the past couple of years with
24 respect to these Engle, sort of Engle tobacco cases,
25 you've done some testifying, right?
38
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

(212) 490-34301 A. Yes.
2 Q. So let's talk about then since they're kind of

THE DEPONENT:
By the time of the Rogers trial,
with the law firm Shook Hardy & Bacon.
12
BY MR. BASS:
Q.
So how long after the initial
13 phone call you received did you become retained by the
14 Shook Hardy & Bacon firm?
15
16
17
A.
To the best of my recollection, it was a couple
of years.
Q.
Did you understand on whose behalf you were
18 working in doing this kind of general research prior to
19 and leading up to the Rogers case?
20
21
22
A.
Not with any specific reference to an
individual or a plaintiff or anyone like that, no.

I was doing the research to come to some kind

What
Were you getting paid for that general
research?
A.
Yes, I was getting paid for that general
research; and so were a couple of graduate students.
10 Q. And who was paying you for that work?
11 A. I think that had to come finally from Shook
12
13
Hardy & Bacon.
Q.
So is it your understanding, or is it correct
14 then, that since the initial contact, the first time you
15 got paid was from the Shook Hardy & Bacon law firm,
16 correct?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. Has any other law firm paid you for any work
19 in -- for any tobacco related work other than the Shook
20 Hardy & Bacon law firm?
21 A. No.
22 Q. So even prior to any specific individual
23 litigation cases, starting with the Rogers case, which
24 seem to be the first one, you have been retained by the
25 Shook Hardy & Bacon law firm to do the general research,

right?
A.
Well, I've been retained to come to opinions in
3 individual cases, yes, using both general and specific
4 research.
5
Q.
All right.
Each time you testified in trial
6 from 1994 to 2001, we talked about those cases, was that

It was as an expert on general
awareness on the subject matter.

12
Object to form.
BY MR. BASS:
Q.
But on whose behalf were you
testifying?
A.
I was testifying to what I discover in these
14 individual cases, simply what my opinions were as an
15 expert witness on general awareness.
16
17
Q.
And who -- when you came to trial to testify
who called you as a witness in these cases?
18 A. That would have been Shook Hardy & Bacon.
19 Q. In each of those cases you testified in trial,
20
correct?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. And each case you worked on in that time frame,
23
the Shook Hardy & Bacon law firm paid you, correct?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. During that time period, from 1994 to 2001, how
41
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 much money did you earn or how much money were you paid

3 expert work?
4 A.

7
I haven't gone back to
evaluate that or find out.
Q.
You've never been asked how much -- strike
that.
8
9
I couldn't tell you.
Have you ever been asked how much you made from
the time period 1994 to 2001 for your expert services?
10 A. I don't think I have.
11 Q. Is there anywhere for you to estimate, as you
12 sit here today, how much you may have been paid by the
13 Shook Hardy & Bacon law firm?
14 A. Not for those specific years.
15 Q. Aside doing this general research and then
16 applying it and testifying in specific cases, were you
17 doing anything else as an expert witness for the Shook
18 Hardy & Bacon law firm?
19 A. No.
20 Q. In between 2000 -- well, do you recall when you
21 were originally contacted to work or the initial
22 conversations about working in the Florida Engle tobacco
23 cases?
24 MS. BROWN:
25 THE DEPONENT:

I really don't.

13 disclosed, that would be work-product and we would

MS. BROWN:
I am.
If it involves something
13 other than cases in which she's been disclosed as a

time period, 2001 to approximately 2007?

tobacco Engle cases.
44
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
You think, although you don't recall the exact
2 time frame, the Barbanell case was one of the first
3 cases you were contacted to start working on?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. Let me ask you this:
Going back to the time
6 period of 2001 to approximately 2007, did you have any
7 communication or contact with representatives from the
8 Shook Hardy & Bacon firm?
9 A. I probably did, yes.
10 Q. Understanding you're not going to be able to
11 pinpoint how many times.
12 might keep in contact with them?
13 often during those years was there communication between
14 yourself and representatives from the Shook Hardy &
15 Bacon law firm?
16
MS. BROWN:
Was it on annual basis you
Was it monthly?
How
The same objection, Mr. Bass.
To
17 the extent Dr. Hoff was working with anyone at Shook
18 Hardy & Bacon between that time period in something
19 other than a case in which she was disclosed as an
20 testifying expert, we would assert the work-product
21 privilege.
22
BY MR. BASS:
Q.
Okay.
Let me see.
Give me a
23 moment.
24 questions that I can ask to not shove a long objection,

So that's approximately eight including the six
19 we've identified, plus the Eshbaugh and the Kershin

21 expert witness, correct?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Going back to the 2001 to 2007 time period, are

three- or four-year period.
Q.
And that's relating to work in the Florida
Engle tobacco cases, right?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. I know we're a little ways off from trial, I
16 guess a month or two in this case.
17 in trial in the past, correct?
But you've testified

Q.
And then you testified in trial of -- the trial
of Barbanell, correct?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. In between the end of your deposition of
5 Barbanell and up till the time you testified in trial,
6 what types of in things did you do in Barbanell to get
7 ready to testify in trial?
8
A.
Nothing more than simply review the material.
9 I would have read the transcript of the deposition, and
10 then simply reviewed the material that I researched for
11 the case.
12
Q.
Can you estimate how many hours you would have
13 spent doing that type of work leading up to the trial,
14 your trial testimony in Barbanell?
15 A. I have no idea.
16 Q. In preparation for your trial testimony in
17 Barbanell did you meet with any of the lawyers that were
18 trying that case?
19 A. Yes, I would have met with some.
20 Q. Would that have been in the months or weeks
21 leading up to it, or would that may have been, for
22 example, the night or weekend before you actually gave
23 your trial testimony?
24

It probably would have been closer to the trial
testimony.

Not really.
The resource materials list would

So I would have

10 the material.
11 whatever fact witness depositions were taken in that
12 case?
Did you review all the fact witnesses or
13 A. Yes.

15
deposition, I'd assume, right?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. And then you reviewed the reliance list?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. You had to travel from wherever you were down
20
Uh-huh.
to Florida for that trial, correct?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Do you or did you charge for your travel time
23
in the Barbanell trial?
24 A. You mean for the time I was in the air?
25 Q. Yeah.
From the time you left whenever you were

11 A. Yes.
12 Q. And then when you returned home your travel
13
back home, you didn't charge for your time, right?
14 A. No, I did not.
15 Q. If you were to testify in trial in this case
16 would you expect that you would follow kind of the same,
17 I guess, procedure, you know, review the deposition,
18 your transcript, the resource list, those kinds of
19 things if you were to testify in this trial?
20 A. Exactly, yes.
21 Q. And you would -- likewise you would not charge
22 for your travel time to get down to testify in this
23 case, right?
24 A.
That's correct.

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
If you can tell me what the note is.
2 A. Do you have it in front of you?
3 Q. I have the reliance list.
4 A. It's on the second page under "Selections from
5
Yes, ma'am.
The Saginaw News" from the Michigan Paper.
6 Q. And what did you note there?
7 A. That the coverage -- basically I was looking at
8 the coverage from 19 -- really from 1948 on through '59.
9 But my note says that the coverage really began in
10 earnest with the mouse study in 1953 and then continued
11 to cover the Winder and Graham studies in '55 and '56.
12 Q. That's what the note says there on the --
13 A. Yeah.
Uh-huh.
14 Q. Okay.
All right.
This resource list -- you've
15 provided resource list, not this exact one obviously,
16 but this resource list in the cases you've previously
17 given in deposition, right?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. What about in those cases prior to 2001, the
20 cases that you either sat for deposition or gave expert
21 reports and/or testified in trial, back then did you
22 also provide, you know, what we call reliance list or
23 resource material?
24 back then?
25
A.
Did you provide anything like that
I'm not sure.
I remember that we provided
54
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 exhibits at the trials.
2 that there was a resource materials list as such.
3
Q.
But I'm not absolutely sure
And this -- the resource material list in this
4 case, the Buchanan case, what's the purpose of this
5 list, what is it supposed to reflect?
6
A.
Well, it reflects my very general research
7 going back in time on the subject matter of smoking and
8 health hazards and addiction.
9 historical pamphlets and comments and publications.
10
And then it reflects some
What it also does, though, in this case, it
11 does the specific newspapers that the decedent in this
12 case would have read, along with other national
13 publications that would have had some comments on the
14 subject matter of the risks of smoking.
15 And then it goes into specific educational
16 materials, as you can see, relating to the state of
17 Michigan in this instance.
18 materials reflecting popular culture.
19 states which passed legislation with respect to laws
20 prohibiting the sale of tobacco in the early part of the
21 20th Century.
22
And then some audio-visual
The list of

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 of smoking on especially children have.
2 finally there is some more or less miscellaneous
3 materials you can see there.
4
Q.
And then
And this list aside from your background,
5 training experiences, is this list designed to
6 encapsulate the sources of material that you relied on
7 in forming your opinions in this case?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. And I have had the benefit of comparing it to
10 at least one prior resource list.
11 case because the plaintiff's lawyer is the lawyer in the
12 Gafney case.
13
And that's the Gafney
And so am I right, then, that there are some
14 kind of, as you mentioned, general research and then
15 there's also case specific items on the list, right?
16 A. Right.
17 Q. And so with respect to the general research,
18 those are things that would overlap or be used in
19 previous cases as well, correct?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. So there are things generally apply probably to
22
most cases you would testify in litigation, right?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. And then there are case specific things that
25
are individual to case.
For example, newspapers the

(212) 490-34301
particular smoker would have read for example, right?
2 A. And the educational materials, yes.
3 Q. Yes, ma'am.
4
And I'm just using the newspapers
as an --
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. There's other case specific things, like you
7 said, like the magazine educational materials and things
8 like that, correct?
9 A. Correct.
10 Q. And just so I can get a sense.
11 explained in the Gafney case.
12 devour that.
13
I think you
I didn't have a chance to
With respect to the format of the resource
14 list, you know, there's columns and rows of course, and
15 there are rows, there's a title column and then a date
16 column, right?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. The title and then the heading under the title,
19 those are self-explanatory.
20 date.
I want to ask you about the
21 A. Okay.
22 Q. For example, the first item that has a date is
23 an entry, "Rush, Benjamin" five down on the first page,
24 right?
25
A.
Yes.

So that meant to

3 year 18 hundred and six or 1806?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. And the 0000 means you don't know the exact
6
date or the month.
That's why 0000, right?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. The handwritten letter from John Quincy Adams
9
to Reverend Samuel H. Cox underneath it, the date.
If I
10 read that correctly, it would be, the year would be,
11 1845, right?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. And '08 is meant to reflect the month, right?
14 A. Correct.
15 Q. And so then the 19 is the date.
16
So it would be
August 19, 1845, right?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. That form is consistent going through the
19
remaining entries, correct?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. All right.
22
Very good.
Thank you.
I read in the past depositions that you, and
23 you've alluded to it already here, the fact that some of
24 the research, and I don't mean some to mean a little
25 bit, but some of the research that you've done in these
58
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
cases you did yourself, correct?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. And other research done in these cases you've
4
used research assistants, correct?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. So I'm going to ask you a little bit about
7
that.
8
9
Did you use research assistants to help you or
to do any research in this case, the Buchanan case?
10 A. Yes, I did.
11 Q. Can you point to me what entry you used
12
13
research assistants to research?
A.
Yes, I can.
If you look on the second page the
14 newspapers which the decedent read were all researched
15 by assistants, beginning with the Florida -- well,
16 really beginning with the Saginaw in chronological
17 order.
18
Q.
Those are the newspapers listed.
And, of course, there is a list chronologically
19 where Mr. Buchanan lived.
20 starting with the entry selection from The Florida Times
21 Union of Jacksonville, Florida.
22 a research assistant researched?
But I understand that.
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. Lake City Reporter?
25 A. Yes, same.
But
That's one that you had
59
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Q. What about The New York Times articles?
2 A. Those articles I've done research in, I
3 originally did the research myself from the very
4 beginning because The New York Times is considered
5 still, more or less at least, the paper of record.
6 consequently, when I first started doing research I had
7 to see what kind of coverage The New York Times did to
8 the health risks of smoking and the addictive nature of
9 smoking.
10
Q.
And
And so I think I read this before, but I just
11 want to make sure.
12 research you covered a certain time period and then you
13 had a research assistant research another time period?
14 Or did you do all the research pertaining to The New
15 York Times?
With respect to The New York Times
16 A. I did all of that research back before 2001.
17 Q. Meaning the articles that appear in this
18 resource list, you did all the research on yourself and
19 you did that research prior to the year 2001, right?
20
21
A.
Yes.
Well, it extends through the 1990s, but
the bulk of the research was done before 2001.
22 Q. 23 by you? 24 A. Yes.
25 Q. The News Herald of Panama City, was that done
Okay.
And The New York Times research was done
60
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
by a research assistant?
2 A. Yes, it was.
3 Q. The Saginaw News, I think you said that was
4
done by a research assistant?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. I'm going to make a note here.
7
Bear with me.
Stars and Stripes?
8 A. Yes, a research assistant.
9 Q. And what is Stars and Stripes?
10 A. It's the publication that the military puts out
11
12
13
for enlisted men and officers.
Q.
The selection from the Tallahassee Democrat,
was that research done by a research assistant?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Are there any other entries on your resource
16 list where a research assistant did research for that
17 particular entry?
18 A. Not for this case, no.
19 Q. Did you -- with respect to this case and to
20 these -- the newspaper paper articles -- excuse me, the
21 newspaper where the Buchanan lived, how many research
22 assistants did you use to do that research?
23 A. You mean in all of the newspapers?
24 Q. Yes, ma'am.
25 A. I used three.
61
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
Q.
And I'm assuming -- well, I
shouldn't assume.
3
4
Three, okay.
All three researchers didn't do all six
newspapers.
Did you split up the work between them?
5 A. Yes, I did.
6 Q. Did each researcher take two publications?
7 A. Let me look here.
Let's see.
8 correct.
9 the Panama paper was done by one.
I think that's
The Florida Times Union and the Lake City and
And then the Saginaw
10 News and the Stars and Stripes was done by other.
11 then the Tallahassee Democrat by another.
12 three, one had two, and one had one.
13
Q.
And
So one had
And I do want to ask you about, is there three
14 different ones.
15 about giving up names.
16 But I do want to try and find the easiest way.
17 going to ask you about these people, you know, their
18 background or anything or their full name.
19
I know there's kind of tortured history
I don't want to know the names.
I'm not
But to the extent you can, it would be helpful
20 for us to keep an order of record to maybe know at least
21 the first names of these researchers so I can talk about
22 the work that they did or the work that you had them do.
23 Would that be okay for you to give me their first names?
24
25
MS. BROWN:
You know, Mr. Bass, and you
obviously know our sensitivity to that.
I think maybe
62
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 what we prefer, maybe we could do it by locale, where
2 each one is located.
3
4
MR. BASS:
You mean where each research
assistant is located?
5 MS. BROWN:
6 MR. BASS:
Yes.
That's fair enough.
Any way we can
7 easily identify them, so we know who we're talking
8 about, we know the work they did.
9
BY MR. BASS:
Q.
So the researcher for The
10 Florida Times Union, the Lake City Reporter, and the
11 News Herald, where did that person reside?
12 A. She lives in Hawthorne, Florida.
13 Q. The researcher of the Saginaw News and the
14
Stars and Stripes, is that a male or female?
15 A. It's female.
16 Q. Near you?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. And the researcher of the Tallahassee Democrat?
19 A. She lives in Eugene, Virginia.
20
21
She lives in Bozeman, Montana.
And did
research out of the Library of Congress.
Q.
Now, the Florida Times Union, the female
22 researcher from Hawthorne, Florida, she researched the
23 Florida Times Union.
24
25
How did you -- well, strike that.
Let me ask this:
These particular researchers,
any of them, or some of them, have you worked with them
63
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 in the past?
2 A. Yes, I have.
3 Q. Have you worked with all of them in the past?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. Okay.
And have you worked with them in doing
6 research in other cases like the research they did in
7 this case?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. How many researchers, besides yourself, have
10 you used to assist with researchers in this Florida
11 tobacco Engle litigation?
12 A. It would have been these three.
13 Q. So these are -- and regardless of whether you
14 used all three in each case.
15 research assistants you've used in these cases, right?
These are the three
16 A. That's correct.
17 Q. And none others?
18 A. No others, no.
19 Q. Times Union done by the researcher in
20 Hawthorne, Florida.
21 criteria to conduct her research?
22
23
24
25
A.
Union?
Q.
I'm sorry.
Did you provide her with certain
Did you say The Florida Times
I didn't hear the first word.
I'm sorry.
Yes, ma'am.
Let me ask it again.
We'll take them in the order that they appear on the
64
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 resource list because that's the way they need to be
2 split up naturally anyway.
3
So starting with the Florida Times Union, the
4 researcher from the Hawthorne, Florida.
5 did you give her specific to her research in The Florida
6 Times Union?
7 A.
What criteria
It was based, of course, on when the Buchanan
8 family would have been there.
9 sometime in '59, 1959, and left around '66 or perhaps
And they moved there
10 '67.
11 back to '58 and go on really to '72 just to see what the
12 general coverage in the area would have been, what kind
13 of community information would have been available from
14 this particular newspaper.
15
16
So I gave her a time frame, as you can see, to go
Q.
So one of the criteria was a specific start
date and a specific end date, right?
17 A. Yes, uh-huh.
18 Q. Did you give any criteria or any direction as
19
20
to how the researcher was to go about finding articles?
A.
Yes.
For that particular time period, I would
21 have indicated that the researcher look for some of the
22 important, either scientific studies coming out from the
23 universities or from the government itself, and for any
24 other issues in that time period that would have
25 concerned smoking, and addiction.
65
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Because in that time period you would not only
2 have had a scientific study, but surgeon general's
3 reports, you would have had warnings going on cigarette
4 packs.
5 period that I instructed the researcher to look for.
6
So there were a number of issues in that time
Q.
I'll tell you that our firm represents the
7 plaintiff in the Gafney case.
8 deposition afterwards, we were provided a four or
9 five -- there's actually a five-page document, and
And pursuant to that
10 there's only writing on four pages and it's entitled,
11 "Select Tobacco Research Date In."
12 deposition.
13 discussion about it, and then it looks like it was later
14 forwarded to us.
15 about that and see if we're talking about the same thing
16 here.
17 to tell you that to orient you with some of the
18 questions.
I wasn't at that
But I read the deposition and there was
So I want to ask you some questions
There may be a way to short circuit.
19
So I want
But with respect to the research in the Florida
20 Times Union, the researcher in Hawthorne, Florida, let
21 me make sure I understand it.
22 was identifying some scientific studies during that time
23 period that she was to look for, right?
24
25
A.
Yes.
So the criteria you gave
And other issues that would have come up
in that time period.
66

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
3
4
5
6
7
Q.
Did you give any specific dates or was it just
scientific studies or issues?
A.
There were dates associated with some of the
studies, yes.
Q.
And so did you also ask for her to look at
newspapers from those specific dates, as well?
A.
Yes.
And before and after in any of these
8 specific dates in case the newspaper didn't carry it on
9 that particular date.
10
Q.
And on this document that I referenced, it
11 says, "Remember to look for two or three dates before
12 and after the specific date if you did not find the ones
13 listed below."
14 maybe look a couple days before or look a couple days
15 after?
Is that what you mean when you just said
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. Did you give those same instructions to her for
18 her work with respect to the Lake City paper and the
19 Panama City paper?
20
A.
Yes, I did give the very general instructions,
21 as we've just talked about.
22 Lake City Reporter, I had her do a daily search and not
23 simply look for any specific dates.
24
25
Q.
But with respect to the
And then, of course, the Panama City paper, the
time frame was different?
67
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Yes.
2 Q. Like the criteria search in the Florida Times
3 Union, is that the same criteria you gave regarding the
4 Panama City paper?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. The topics and/or the dates that you provided
7 to the research assistant, who came up with those topics
8 and/or dates?
9 A. I did.
10 Q. How did you communicate with the researcher
11
from Hawthorne, Florida with respect to her assignment?
12 A. By e-mail.
13 Q. Was it a one-time only communication or was
14 there kind of a back and forth communication while her
15 research was going on?
16
A.
It would have initially simply, again, given
17 her time frame, and she would have started the research.
18 And then by and large, there's not much communication
19 unless the researcher for some reason has a question or
20 runs into a problem, let's say, with the microfilm not
21 being complete or something like that.
22 isn't much communication until she finishes the research
23 and then sends it on to me.
24
25
Q.
Okay.
There usually
Do you recall any communications in
between the time you sent her the research criteria and
68
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 the time she sent her research back to you, was there
2 any communication in the interim?
3
4
A.
I don't think for the Florida Times Union or
the Panama paper, no.
5 Q. Was there for the Lake City paper?
6 A. In the sense that I did indicate that she
7
8
9
should do a daily search instead of simply using dates.
Q.
So aside from what I'll just say generally the
initial instruction, I guess, for each researcher
10 project, for each paper, starting then and until you
11 received the research back from her with respect to
12 these three papers, there was no communication between
13 you all in the interim, right?
14 A. That's correct.
15 Q. Did you send her -- when you sent the
16 instruction and the criteria, you said you sent them via
17 e-mail, right?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. Within the body of the e-mail that you have as
20 criteria, or did you send a Word document?
21 recall how you conveyed that information to her?
Do you
22 A. What information?
23 Q. On -- I'm sorry.
24 A. The dates were simply conveyed, you know, given
25
The information on --
Go ahead.
the inclusive dates.
69
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
Correct.
And I'm wondering the mode of
2 communication.
3 that you typed it out or was there a Word document where
4 you had this typed out and you attached it?
5 that occur?
6
7
8
9
10
A.
Was it within the body of the e-mail
How did
It occurred primarily through the e-mail in
terms of the dates themselves, yes.
Q.
I guess this pertains to maybe all three of
your researchers you used in this case:
Are they paid
for their work?
11 A. Yes, they are.
12 Q. And who pays them?
13 A. I pay them.
14 Q. Does it come out of your rate of 250 an hour,
15 or is that over and above the rate of 250, or is that in
16 addition to your rate?
17 A. It's in addition to mine.
18 Q. So do you bill Shook Hardy & Bacon separately
19
20
21
22
for their time or how did that work?
A.
Yes.
After they submit invoices to me and I
pay them, then I bill Shook Hardy & Bacon.
Q.
And when you bill Shook Hardy & Bacon in this
23 regard, are they invoiced individual invoices pertaining
24 to a specific case or how does your invoices work?
25
A.
They're individual invoices naming the case.
70
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
So much like the invoices you submit, this
2 would be submitted, the work the research assistant did,
3 would be submitted in that same vein, right?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. The female researcher in Hawthorne, Florida,
6 how many hours did she spend researching Florida Times
7 Union, the Lake City Reporter, and the Panama City
8 paper?
9
10
A.
I don't know.
I'd have to look back at her
invoices.
11 Q. You don't have those with you today, correct?
12 A. No, I don't.
13 Q. And have you submitted those to Shook Hardy &
14
15
16
Bacon yet?
A.
I think in every instance I have submitted
those already.
17 Q. Okay.
18 A. Maybe not the very last part of the Lake City
19
20
Reporter information.
Q.
And, for example, the female in Hawthorne,
21 Florida, you don't recall how many hours she spent doing
22 her work?
23 A. No.
24 Q. When you received the work back from the female
25
researcher from Hawthorne, Florida, what did you do with
71
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
it?
A.
I usually receive hard copies in which I send
3 on to Shook Hardy & Bacon.
4 because of the time constraints, the researcher sent the
5 hard copies both to me and to Shook Hardy at the same
6 time.
7
Q.
I think in this instance,
Dr. Hoff, you were telling us that the
8 researcher from Hawthorne, Florida, because of time
9 constraints she sent hard copies of what she found to
10
both you and Shook Hardy & Bacon, correct?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. When you say "time constraints," what do you
13
14
mean?
A.
Simply we're trying to put together an accurate
15 resource material list and get the dates, the inclusive
16 dates for the newspapers and the research done in a
17 timely fashion.
18 material to be scanned for the research -- resource
19 materials list to Shook Hardy & Bacon.
20
21
Q.
And there was some pressure to get the
I see.
Now, were there of the articles -- with respect
22 to the Florida Times Union, I'm not sure how many
23 articles there are.
24 I don't think you have the disk in the computer where
25 you can pull it up.
I have the list, I can pull it up.
Probably not.
72
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
But were are all of the articles that she sent
2 to you, did all of those articles make it onto the
3 resource list?
4 A. I spot check the disk, and indeed they did.
5 Q. So every one that the researcher -- with
6 respect to the Florida Times Union, every article that
7 the researcher in Hawthorne, Florida sent you made it
8 onto the resource list, correct?
9
10
A.
But I spot
checked the list and indeed it seemed to be accurate.
11
12
I didn't look at every article.
Q.
What do you mean when you spot checked the
list?
13
A.
I would simply look at the disk and see what
14 the years she had researched had come up, and I would go
15 into the specific year and look at a couple of articles
16 to make sure it conformed to the hard copy she had sent
17 me.
18
Q.
So you didn't go through each and every hard
19 copy of the article and compare it to the articles that
20 were on the disk, correct?
21 A. That's correct.
22 Q. You said you spot checked to see if -- to kind
23 of compare the list.
24 anything to spot check or to confirm the work that that
25 she had done with respect to the Florida Times Union?
Did you also -- did you do
73
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. In what sense?
2 Q. Well, I don't know.
I mean, let me ask you
3 this more generally then.
4 articles when you received them from her with respect to
5 the Florida Times Union?
What did you do with those
6 A. I read them.
7 Q. Okay.
8 A. Yes, I would go through them all.
9 Q. Did you do anything else with respect to those
10
11
You read all of them?
articles?
A.
I thought about them and tried to come to some
12 generalization about how extensive the coverage seemed,
13 whether it was local, what issues the paper seem
14 concerned with, how well in this case did it cover the
15 1964 surgeon general's report.
16 generalizations about how well The Florida Times Union
17 serve its community with respect to the subject of
18 cigarette smoking.
19
Q.
So I was coming to some
Prior to or at any other time prior to this
20 case have you, yourself, done any work or done any
21 research into smoking and health issues contained within
22 The Florida Times Union newspaper between the year 1958
23 to 1972?
24 A. No.
25 Q. The Lake City, it might be tedious, but I want
74
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 to go through each publication, each newspaper and ask
2 you kind of the same sort of questions.
3 about the Lake City Reporter.
4
So let's talk
What was different with respect to the Lake
5 City Reporter as compared to the Florida Times Union?
6 Why did you have the researcher look through daily copy?
7
A.
It turned out, and I didn't know this and
8 neither did the researcher until she started looking at
9 the paper, that it was not a daily paper, it was a
10 weekly paper.
11 out as a weekly and then going to a daily for that
12 ten-year period it would probably be more complete or
13 comprehensive to have her look at it for every day, and
14 that's what she did.
15 period of only ten years.
16 request I thought.
17
Q.
Okay.
And so I thought to myself that as coming
It was a relatively short time
So it was a reasonable
Going back to the Florida Times Union, I
18 guess I can ask you now, I'll have it later on here in
19 my outline.
20 the Buchanans lived in the Jacksonville area, right?
21 think you said 1959 to 1967?
You testified, I think, to the years that
22 A. Yeah.
23 Q. And do you recall where you obtained that
24 information?
25 A.
I
I think '66, '67, yes.
I think it was either from the depositions or
75
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
from the interrogatory.
2
Q.
I think, yeah.
The Lake City Reporter, how did the researcher
3 from Hawthorne, Florida, how did she -- I guess she sent
4 you the articles much like the Florida Times Union,
5 correct?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. And did she also send the articles to Shook
8
Hardy & Bacon?
9 A. Yes, she did.
10 Q. Did you confirm -- well, did every article that
11 she sent you from the Lake City Reporter during the
12 pertinent time period, did that make it onto the
13 reliance list?
14
15
16
17
A. I spot checked that, as well, and it did.
They
Q. Do you recall when the Buchanans live in Lake
did.
City?
18 A. They lived there between '66 and '76.
19 Q. Now, because the Lake City report -- because of
20 the instruction, for lack of a better word, the Lake
21 City Reporter was different.
22 this.

A.
The same things that she would have been

Do you know if the Buchanans took the News

18 A. No, I don't.
19 Q. I'll confess I have not read the depositions.
20 Was there any testimony whether or not the Buchanans
21 took the News Herald in Panama City?
22
A.
I don't think there was.
But there was much
23 testimony about how he read newspapers all the time.
24 And it was logical for me to assume he might have read
25 that when he was stationed there in the Air Force.

So although there was no testimony, because it
2 was the paper that was in the area you decided to
3 research it, correct?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. With respect to all the articles that the
6 research assistant pulled with the News Herald, did all
7 of those papers make it onto your reliance list?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. You confirmed that in the same way as the

How did you convey the initial instructions to
this particular research assistant in Bozeman?
6 A. As I did with others:

9 A. They were individual e-mails.
10 Q. And I'm assuming that the kind of chronology
11 was the same.
12 researcher in Bozeman.
13 her assignment she sent what she had collected back to
14 you, right?
You sent the initial instruction to this
And then when she was done with
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Was there any contact in between the initial
17 instruction and the time you got the final product back
18 from her?
19 A. I don't believe so.
20 Q. With respect to the Saginaw News in every
21 article that the research associate, or assistant
22 rather, from Bozeman that she sent to you did every
23 research article made it onto the reliance list?
24 A. I spot checked it as well, and they did.
25 Q. Prior to this case, and I didn't ask you about

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 the Lake City or the News Herald.
2 the Saginaw News, the News Herald, or Lake City
3 Reporter.
4 any research on the same topic in any of those papers?
I'll ask you about
Prior to this case have you, yourself, done
5 A. No.
6 Q. Stars and Stripes, you told us what that was, a
7
publication of the armed services, right?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. Was there any testimony that Mr. Buchanan read
10
Stars and Stripes?
11 A. No, there wasn't.
12 Q. Was there testimony that he read the Saginaw
13
14
News?
A.
Again, because he was a reader of newspapers I
15 assumed that beginning from the time he was a teenager
16 probably in Saginaw, he would have begun to read that
17 paper.
18
Q.
Why do you believe he would have started to
19 read it as a teenager?
20 in general.

was in high school or came out of high school.
Q.
All right.
Is there any testimony in the
3 deposition that speak to how old Mr. Buchanan was when
4 he started to read newspaper?
5
6
7
8
A.
No.
There was testimony that they did
subscribe to Saginaw News later on.
Q.
And when you say "they," you mean Mr. and Mrs.
Buchanan as a married couple?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. As opposed to they being Mr. Buchanan and his
11
parents or his family when he was growing up, right?
12 A. Correct.
13 Q. Was there any testimony with respect to whether
14
or not Mr. Buchanan's parents subscribed to newspapers?
15 A. Not that I can recall.
16 Q. With respect to Stars and Stripes, the article
17 that the researcher from Bozeman, Montana, did every
18 article she sent make it onto your reliance list?
19 A. When I spot checked them they did, yes.
20 Q. When you say spot check, if you can just give
21 me an idea how many entries or articles did you spot
22 check?
23
A.
Well, for example, again, since the time period
24 was so short for Stars and Stripes I went into each
25 year.
I may not have checked every article in each
81
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 year, but I did go into each year and check it against
2 the hard copy I had.
3 Q. And finally the Tallahassee Democrat.
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. That was done by a third researcher out of
6
Eugene, Virginia, correct?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. And similarly to the other two, I assume there
9
10
was an e-mail communication sending the instruction
and/or the criteria for the assignment, right?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. And it was the same here are the dates, time
13 period, I want you to search.
14 or some time, some topics, some studies I want you to
15 search around, correct?
And here are some dates
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. And then this researcher completed the
18 assignment and sent the article to you and Shook Hardy &
19 Bacon, right?
20 A. Correct.
21 Q. Was there any communication in the interim
22 between the original assignment and when you received
23 the articles back?
24
25
A.
I don't think so.
Though, as you see there,
the time period was broken up, and I may have
82
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 communicated with her about the fact that there were
2 three different time periods.
3
Q.
But that was about it.
And I was going to ask you about that.
Why are
4 there three separate time periods with respect to the
5 Tallahassee Democrat article?
6
A.
There was some confusion or some vague
7 information indicating that the family may have lived
8 very briefly in Tallahassee.
9 it would have been in that time period where they were
10 basically in Saginaw, I included the years '53 through
11 '59.
12
And so consequently since
Then, as I do very often, even though they did
13 not move to Tallahassee until '66, I included -- well,
14 actually they didn't move there until '76.
15 included coverage of the 1964 surgeon general's report.
16 Because my research has shown that very often how
17 extensively a paper, whether it's a local one or a
18 bigger one as in the case of the Tallahassee paper, how
19 extensively they cover that surgeon general's report
20 usually indicates the interest the paper has in the
21 question of the risk associated with smoking.
22
But I
And so I found that, indeed, the Tallahassee
23 paper did cover the surgeon general's report extensively
24 in that month period.
25 researcher did, skip to the period more relevant for the
Then I skipped to -- the
83
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
time in which the family lived in Tallahassee.
Q.
I notice that with respect to the other
3 publications, before The Florida Times Union the Lake
4 City Reporter -- well, the Lake City Reporter, the News
5 Herald, the Saginaw News, Stars and Stripes you didn't
6 have the researchers look for coverage of the surgeon
7 general's report in 1964.
8
9
So my question is:
Why did you have the
researchers look for coverage of the 1964 surgeon
10 general's report in Tallahassee but none of the other
11 paper because that's where they were living in 1964?
12
A.
Right.
I did it in part because of the --
13 where the family lived at that time.
14 that they left Saginaw by '59, there really wasn't any
15 need for me to have information about the paper's
16 coverage in '64.
17
And given the fact
In the case of the Lake City Reporter, since it
18 was a weekly, that also would not have given me a good
19 indication of the paper's interest in the subject
20 matter.
21 look for it in the Florida Health News.
22
Q.
And as you've said, I did, of course, have them
On your resource list on page 2, I guess it is,
23 underneath the newspaper there's magazine starting with
24 Consumer Report, on through page 2.
25 the entries on page 3, Time magazine, U.S. News, and

(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
World Report, right?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. Of those, Consumer Report, News Week, Reader's
4 Digest, Times, U.S. News, and World Report, is there any
5 testimony that Mr. Buchanan or the Buchanans subscribed
6 to any of these magazines?
7 A. No, there is not.
8 Q. Do you know if they subscribe to any magazine?
9 A. I couldn't find any listed in the depositions.
10 Q. And this question is not meant to be critical
11 because I know you've seen these entries in other
12 particular cases.
13 included selections from Consumer Report, Life, News
14 Week, Reader's Digest, U.S. News, and World Report on
15 your resource list in this case, yet there's no
16 testimony that the Buchanans subscribed to any of these
17 magazines?
18
A.
But is there a reason why you've

19 nature of my research overall.
20 historical publications, and I include those
21 publications, national publications that would have
22 covered this issue really from the late '30s forward.
23 And it's just an indication of what was available in the
24 national scene, what kind of information had entered the
25 public domain on the subject matter.
So I include the

Q.
Going back to The New York Times, was there any

3 is.

But is there any evidence that Mr. Buchanan at any
5 A. Not from the depositions, no.
6 Q. Am I correct, is it fair to say the reason for
7 inclusion The New York Times' article is because The New
8 York Times is viewed as the paper of record?
9
10
11
A.
Yes.
Very often newspapers will pick up
stories from The Times and republish them.
Q.
And it's your testimony that you performed the
12 search, the research for all The New York Times articles
13 that appear on this resource list, correct?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. What search criteria did you use?
16 A. The same the research assistants used.
I was
17 looking for specific events or dates that would show up
18 in connection with either Congressional hearings or with
19 surgeon general's reports or with ACS activity.
20 those kinds of things.
21
Q.
All
Did every article that you found during your
22 research in The New York Times make it on to this
23 resource list?
24
25
A.
I would have to say my research -- I think they
did, yes.
The Times carried so many different kinds of
86
(212) 279-9424

I notice that you stopped research for both The
20 New York Times and the Tallahassee Democrat in 1990,
21 correct?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. What's the reason for that?
24 A. Again, based on the extensive reading and
25
research that I've done, I've come to the conclusion
87
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 that general awareness by the decade of the 1980s had
2 reached such a high level on the risks associated with
3 smoking and the difficulty people had quitting smoking
4 that that general awareness level had reached so broadly
5 into American society that the research beyond 1990
6 would not really have increased my information or added
7 anything to the comprehensiveness of my research up to
8 that point.
9 But I would like to add that I think I've also
10 come to the conclusion that the decade of the 1980s was
11 a kind of watershed decade in terms of general awareness
12 and information about the health hazards of smoking.
13 Because if you think about it, it began with a very
14 extensive surgeon general's report in 1981 under the
15 Carter administration.
16 had made a good deal of publicity, then on television,
17 touting both the '79 and the '81 general surgeon's
18 report, which listed the most extensive group of
19 diseases associated with cigarette smoking.
When Joseph Califano (phonetic)
20 Then as you continue into the '80s, you get
21 surgeon general Coup (phonetic) whose 1982 report is
22 going to do the same thing.
23 reports you really have no longer a debate within the
24 scientific community on the issue of whether or not
25 certain diseases, especially lung cancer, is associated
And in both of those
88

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 with cigarette smoking.
2 extensive list of other diseases associated with
3 cigarette smoking.
4
And as I've said, you have an
So the information, then, in coming out of not
5 only those two reports, but in Coup's '86 report, his
6 '88 report, all of these reports indicate that the
7 government and even the scientific community is moving
8 over to issues of secondary smoke and to addiction
9 issues.
And in that same decade you have them because I
10 think the general awareness is at such a high level from
11 these studies that legislation begins to be passed, in
12 this case, the state of Florida, but in other states
13 with respect to smoking in public buildings or offices.
14 And you'll get ban on smoking on airlines in this time
15 period.
16
The '80s, then, is really a crucial decade in
17 terms of not only the level of general awareness, but
18 the kinds of activities going on that simply reinforce
19 the general awareness level of the public.
20 beyond 1990, I didn't think I would be adding anymore
21 information or any information that received such
22 publicity with respect to these kinds of surgeon general
23 studies in particular.
24 because I think my generalizations were well confirmed
25 by that time.
So by going
So I stopped there simply
89
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
You called the 1980s a watershed decade.
Are
2 you saying that the surgeon general's report up to that
3 point were not as comprehensive or informative as the
4 surgeon general's report that came after or starting in
5 1980?
6
A.
No, not at all.
I'm just saying that there was
7 little debate within -- no debate within these studies
8 that appeared from '79 forward about any confusion or
9 debate over the diseases caused by cigarette smoking.
10 It's just that you had in Califano, who wasn't the
11 surgeon general, but who was the secretary of HEW, made
12 a good deal of noise about the extensiveness of diseases
13 associated with cigarette smoking, and so did Coup.
14 you had Califano and Coup kind of getting the attention
15 of the press again in a way that perhaps some of the
16 reports in the earlier '70s had not.
17
18
19
Q.
So
We're going to switch gears here and talk about
your opinions in this case.
MS. BROWN:
Mr. Bass, can I interrupt you for
20 just a second.
21 some kind of idea about how much longer we're going to

I'm just wondering if you can give us

MR. BASS:
Sure.

11 BY MR. BASS:
13
But now would be a
second.
9
12
So if you
Q.
Dr. Hoff, what are your
opinions in this case?
A.
In this case my opinions are that because Ike
14 Buchanan was such an avid reader, he lived in areas
15 where the newspapers conveyed a good deal of information
16 about the health hazards of smoking and the addictive
17 nature of smoking, and that he also went to an
18 educational system that was teaching in the '30s and
19 '40s of some very pertinent information on the issue of
20 how tobacco affected young bodies, and how cigarette
21 smoking was to be avoided.
22 Additionally, from the depositions, it became
23 clear that members of his family and friends were also
24 indicating to him or saying that they either talked with
25 him or were aware of the fact that he was aware of the
91
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 health hazards of smoking.
2 accounting of his sons coming home in 1966 from an
3 anti-smoking assembly they attended in their Florida
4 school, and the family discussing what the children
5 brought back to the family about smoking.
6
In particular, there's an
In this instance Ike Buchanan's sister-in-law
7 indicated that the adults were already aware of the
8 problem, but that she in particular had gone on to
9 discuss with Ike Buchanan the dangers of smoking, and
10 the fact that he should quit.
11 that they became aware of the dangers of smoking, she's
12 not quite sure when, but she indicates that the times
13 he's tried to stop smoking she thought it was for health
14 reason.
15 beginning in the 1960s.
16
His wife also indicated
And she indicates that he tried to stop smoking
So from this and other examples I could give,
17 it seems to me that Ike Buchanan was on his own
18 initiative aware of the health hazards, and had that
19 awareness reinforced by some of his family members or
20 friends.
21
My opinion, then, is based on the research of
22 the educational system in Michigan, of the newspapers
23 that he read, and looking into the various either
24 scientific reports which came out during his adult life
25 and the activities of the major health organizations,
92
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 like the American Cancer Society, Lung Society, Heart
2 Society.

4 of these kinds of sources that there was, I think,
5 available to him credible information that relayed the
6 idea that there was a problem smoking.

8 or one of the risks of smoking.
9
Q.
10
And again, including looking at popular
Okay.
That from all
And that in this
All right.
You said that Mr. Buchanan was aware of the
11 health hazard, and an awareness that was reinforced by
12 friends and family.
13 you gave, right?
That was part of the opinion that
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Do you have an opinion as to what year
16 Mr. Buchanan became aware of the health hazard of
17 cigarette smoke?
18
A.
I don't know an exact year.
But his wife
19 testimony indicated that when he tried to quit smoking
20 she believed he was aware of the problem, and that he
21 began to quit -- or tried to quit smoking back in the
22 early '60s.
23
Q.
So is it your testimony, then, at least by the
24 early '60s Mr. Buchanan was aware of the health hazards
25 of smoking?

If he weren't already aware of them from his

you have an opinion?
A.
Do
Is that your opinion?
The educational materials to which he was
exposed would lead me to that opinion, yes.
Q.
We're going to go through those in a moment.
I'm just trying to get some of your opinions out.
15
So let me just make sure I understand.
Since
16 you can't give an exact year, do you have an opinion as
17 to the time frame when Mr. Buchanan would have become
18 aware of the health hazards of smoking?
19
20
21
22
A.
As I've already said, according to his wife as
early as the 1960s.
Q.
Right, you said that.
But then you also said
if not before based upon his --
23 A. Educational experience.
24 Q. Correct.
25
And what year did Mr. Buchanan start going to

school, do you recall?
2 A. I think it was 1935, '36.
3 Q. And do you recall what year he graduated from
4 high school?
5 A. It was '48, I think.
6 Q. So do you have an opinion -- it's your opinion
7 it was within that time frame when Mr. Buchanan became
8 aware of the health hazards of smoking?
9
10
11
A.
As far as health classes in which were taught
in Michigan, yes.
Q.
So you're saying that based upon the health
12 classes that were taught in Michigan, Mr. Buchanan,
13 because of those health classes, became aware of the
14 health hazards of smoking between 1935, when he started
15 school, and approximately 1948 when he graduated from
16 high school?
17 A.
I'm saying he would have been exposed to
18 materials discussing them, yes, as a child and as a
19 young adult.
20 Q.
So that mean, though, because your opinion is
21 that he was becoming exposed to it, does that mean he
22 became aware of the health hazards of smoking during
23 that time frame?
24 A. There's no evidence of that in the depositions.
25 Q. You do believe that whether it was before or
95
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 not, that at least by the early 1960s when he tried to
2 quit smoking, according to his wife, Mrs. Buchanan, he
3 was then at that time aware of the health hazards with
4 smoking?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. When you say health hazards, aware of the
7 health hazards, what health hazards are you talking
8 about?
9
10
11
A.
She wasn't specific on that.
She would usually
use the phrase he was trying to quit for health reasons.
Q.
What do you mean in your opinion when you say
12 that Mr. Buchanan was aware of the health hazards of
13 smoking?
14
A.
What do you mean by health hazards?
I mean that by the early '60s, again given the
15 material that he would have been reading up to that
16 point, there was information available to him through
17 newspaper accounts and in the scientific studies which
18 were publicized so widely in the 1950s, that he would
19 have been aware of the problem that began to be
20 associated smoking and lung cancer.
21
22
Q.
So when you talk about health hazards, you're
talking about lung cancer, correct?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. I appreciate the indepth answer you gave me.
25
Of course I wasn't able to write it all down.
But you
96
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 said part of the basis for your opinion was the area in
2 which the newspapers that were published in the area
3 that he lived, that was one basis for your opinion,
4 right?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. The next was the educational system that he
7 grew up in attending in Michigan in the 1930s and the
8 1940s, correct?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. So let's talk about his school curriculum.
11 know -- we've already talked about that Mr. Buchanan
12 grew up in Saginaw, Michigan, right?
We
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. And he started school in approximately 1935?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. And approximately 1948 graduated high school,
17
right?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. On your reliance -- excuse me -- your resource
20 list, third page heading, three educational materials,
21 that's the section of your resource list when you talk
22 about his educational curriculum, right?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. Now, you have Michigan material and you also
25
have Florida material, correct?
97
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Yes.
2 Q. What's the purpose of including educational
3
4
materials from Florida on your resource list?
A.
Only to the degree that his children who came
5 home with this information would have been educated in
6 Florida.
7 the American Cancer Society in Florida in terms of
8 programs and pamphlets they produced and clips they
9 produced for schools.
But also simply to indicate the activity of
And the Florida Lung Society was
10 very active.
11 Department of health called the Florida Committee on
12 Smoking and Health.
13 educational materials for the state.
14
Q.
And so was a committee of the Florida
And all of those groups prepared
From underneath the list -- and on this
15 resource material, you just have the general entry
16 material related to health education in Florida.
17 when I click on that, on the disk, there are some things
18 that open up.
19 children and their education.
20
21
So let's just talk briefly about his
Do you know the names of the schools that his
children went to in Florida?
22 A. No, I don't.
23 Q. Do you know if that information appears
24
25
And
anywhere in the deposition testimony?
A.
No, it does not.
Except for in this one

(212) 490-34301
2
instance about the school assembly.
Q.
3
Okay.
Right.
Right.
Setting that aside, I'm talking about in
4 general the years within which the Buchanan children
5 would have gone to school, elementary, junior high and
6 high school and the location, you don't know either of
7 those, do you?
8 A. No, I don't.
9 Q. And there's a listing of 12 or so entries
10 underneath or within the material related to health
11 education in Florida.
12 entries you base your opinion on that his children would
13 have been exposed to any of these materials?
14
A.
Do you know which of those
I think on most of them, given the fact that
15 those organizations would have been preparing materials
16 for schools and conducting school programs.
17
Q.
The episode you talked about the school or
18 whatever episode where one of the kids came back and
19 spoke to Mr. Buchanan about smoking.
20 that?
Which child was
21 A. Both children did.
22 Q. Do you recall what year -- well, strike that.
23
24
25
Let me ask you:
What are the Buchanan
children's names?
A.
They're Michael and Pat.
99
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Q. And who is older of the two, do you recall?
2 A. Michael.
3 Q. So naturally Michael was ahead of Patrick in
4
school presumably, correct?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. Do you recall when and which child approached
7
8
9
Mr. Buchanan as a result of what they heard in school?
A.
As I said previously, according to the
sister-in-law's deposition, they came home from school
10 sometime in 1966 and reported on this anti-smoking
11 assembly they had attended.
12 Q. Was it both of the kids?
13 A. According to her testimony, yes.
14 Q. And that's the earliest reference to the
15 children -- is that the earliest reference to the
16 children talking to their father or parents about
17 smoking?
18 A. I think so.
19 Q. And so are you able to say what they heard, the
20 kids, heard about anti-smoking assembly in 1966 with
21 respect to smoking?
22
A.
Only through the reference that's made by the
23 sister-in-law to the fact that it was an anti-smoking
24 assembly.
25
Q.
She wasn't specific.
So what then do these Florida educational
100
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 materials, in what way do they pertain to this
2 anti-smoking assembly in 1966?
3
A.
I would say, again, as I described them, they
4 were information -- they point to information that would
5 have been available in the community through these
6 organizations.
7 themselves, like the American Cancer Society, and the
8 Florida Lung Associations would have been preparing some
9 of these materials and sending them to the schools.
10
Q.
And in some instances the organizations
Do you know if any of these organizations
11 sponsored in any way the anti-smoking assembly in 1966
12 that the Buchanan children schooled?
13 A. No, I don't.
14 Q. Do you know how long the assembly was?
15 A. No.
16 Q. Is the only thing we know about the assembly is
17 that it happened in 1966 and it described as an
18 anti-smoking assembly?
19
20
21
A.
Yes.
And it prompted the sister-in-law to take
up the hazards of smoking with Ike Buchanan.
Q.
Did -- okay.
22 That information about the anti-smoking
23 assembly that's contained in the sister-in-law's
24 deposition?
25
A.
Yes, it is.

Mr. Buchanan, right?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. You have, on the disk provided to us,
11 underneath "Michigan Educational Materials" you have,
12 there are five other folders.
13 one called "curriculum guide and syllabi," the third is
14 called, "education law and regulations," and the fourth

Yes.
Okay.

Go ahead.
102
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Q. And five is textbooks.
2 A. Okay.
3 Q. The booklets.
What are the booklet -- the
4 items contained within the booklet, what are those
5 designed to represent?
6
A.
They're designed to represent two things.
One
7 is, as you can see from the dates, one gives general
8 information to school teachers about what the subject in
9 hygiene classes.
And sometimes in the hygiene classes
10 is to take into consideration the problems with smoking
11 and alcohol.
12
Some of the booklet information would also
13 contain specific references to textbooks that were
14 recommended for certain grades.
15 instances the information contained not so much
16 textbooks, but general references but to works about the
17 health hazards of smoking.
18 Michigan, there was both in the book list section and in
19 the curriculum guide and syllabi section, and in the law
20 section, references to temperance with respect to
21 cigarette use and alcohol use.
22 other school systems I've studied I didn't always come
23 across the kind of specific references to temperance,
24 and of course, the temperance movement, which was so
25 anti-alcohol and anti-smoking.
And in a couple of

2
3
Q.
So these book lists, who put these book lists
together?
A.
Who compiled these?
They would have been compiled primarily by the
4 Michigan State Department of Public Instruction.
5 seem to come more from that division rather than the
6 department of -- the Michigan Department of Health or
7 the Michigan Department of Education.
8 public instruction department.

10
Q.
They
It was a specific
Do you know who received -- "who" meaning what
schools received these book lists?
11 A. They generally went out to the schools.
12 Q. And how do you know they generally went out to
13 the schools?
14 A.
Because in some references the indication of
15 sometimes a list is preferred list of books.
16 it says books for students.
17 instances, it even gives the specific page numbers in
18 these textbooks that the -- for the teachers to take a
19 look at and study with the students.
20
Q.
Sometimes
And in a couple of
Understanding what might be contained in these
21 particular documents.
22 documents actually went to generally the schools in the
23 state of Michigan?
24 that statement?
25
A.
How do you know that these
What can you point to, to support
There is one document I think from 1941 which
104
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 indicates that the textbooks are being provided free to
2 all the schools.
3
Q.
Do you know -- I don't see a document, at least
4 label, in 1941 underneath this booklet.
5 thinking of a document that might be contained in
6 another folder from 1941?
7
8
9
10
A.
Are you
I think it's probably in the curriculum guide
and syllabi folder.
Q.
I thought that might be the next place to
check, and that's where we'll go on.
11 So aside from this document from 1941, is there
12 anything else you can point to support your statement or
13 your opinion that the documents contained under the
14 folder book list went to any of the schools that
15 Mr. Buchanan attended while in Michigan?
16
17
18
A.
Unless he attended a school outside the school
system, there would be no reason to think they didn't.
Q.
Respectfully, my question is a little bit
19 different.
20 are there any underlying fact besides this 1941
21 document, that we're going to hopefully find in a
22 moment, that supports your opinion that he would have
23 received the information contained within these book
24 lists?
25
A.
Is there anything other than your opinion,
There is one document that I think from
105
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 sometime in the perhaps early '30s that specifically
2 instructs teachers to spend a certain amount of time on
3 different subject matter.
4 health, they're instructed to spend 20 minutes a day on
5 health matter, or approximately a hundred minutes a
6 week.
7
8
Q.
And under the heading of
And does this document reflect the fact that
the teachers actually receive this document?
9 A. That they received it?
10 Q. Correct.
11
You're talking about a document from the early
12 1930s.
13 the teacher has actually received that information?
14
15
16
A.
Well, it would have been distributed by the
State Department of Public Instruction to the schools.
Q.
17
18
But is there anything to point to a fact that
Right.
I understand that that's your belief.
But my question is:
Is there anything that you
can point to that says that actually happened?
19 A. No.
20 Q. Next is the curriculum guide, the syllabi.
You
21 referenced -- what's the purpose of the entries or the
22 documents contained in this folder, the curriculum guide
23 and syllabi folder?
24
25
A.
Well, again, these -- a couple of instances
they're duplicates of the book list because they contain
106
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 both general information about what should be taught in
2 the school on the subject on the subjects health.
3 in some instances they contain, not in all, but in some
4 instances they contain a list of books, textbooks.
5
Q.
And
So the information contained here is kind of
6 similar to the information contained in the other folder
7 of the book list, in reference to the topics and a
8 reference to specific textbooks, right?
9
A.
Yes.
But it is more specific with respect to
10 what should be taught than the book list.
11 you look at it there are more headings and listings
12 under the curriculum guide and syllabi than under the
13 book list.
14
Q.
I think as
Do you know if any of these syllabi and
15 curriculum were sent to any of the schools during any of
16 the time periods -- any of the schools that Mr. Buchanan
17 attended during any of those periods that he attended
18 those schools?
19
20
21
A.
They were written for all the schools, and
presumably went out to all of the schools.
Q.
And so presumption and intents aside, do you
22 know if these actually went to any of the schools that
23 Mr. Buchanan attended at any of the time periods within
24 which he attended them?
25
A.
No.
107
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
The next one is education law and regulation.
2 What's the purpose of the entries contained within this
3 folder?
4 A.
This refers back to legislations that would
5 have been passed by the State, again, referencing the
6 teaching of health classes.
7 very early ones, the early part of the century, they're
8 going to refer to physiology and hygiene.
9 later on they'll refer to regular health classes.
10
And if you go back to the
But then
And what's interesting here, and again, one of
11 the I think maybe 1936 references, the state law
12 actually refers to the benefits to teaching temperance
13 on the subject matter of smoking and alcohol.
14 found a little unusual in the sense that it singled out
15 the temperance movement, which was then also reflected
16 in the other publications, under curriculum guide and
17 syllabi.
18
Q.
Which I
When you say temperance movement, what did
19 those head of the temperance movement, what did they
20 preach with respect to cigarette smoking and alcohol.
21 What were the types of things that temperance movement
22 taught?
23 A.
Well, in its heyday, really in the first half
24 of the 20th Century, but really up through the 1930s,
25 the Women's Christian Temperance Union which is was sort
108
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 of the lead organization in these matters.
2 the curriculum material actually refers to publications
3 by that association.
4 say, total abstinence.
5 indicated that if abstinence was impossible that they
6 recommended moderation in all things.
7 Christian Temperance Union was really a strong advocate
8 of not smoking and not drinking.
9
Q.
Okay.
And some of
They taught or preached, I should
But in their materials they also
But the Women's
So the materials -- the legislative
10 materials underneath this folder basically represent
11 legislation that talks about teaching of health classes
12 and what's supposed to be taught and things of that
13 nature?
14 A.
Yeah.
15 Q.
Under miscellaneous, let's see what we have
16 here.
17 what these are without opening them.
If you bear with me for a minute, I can't tell
18
19
Two entries, the first is, it looks like it's
labeled at least 1892?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. What's that?
22 A. Yes.
It, again, indicates an early example of
23 the fact that school teachers are being instructed to
24 teach in this case, I think, it references "the poison
25 of tobacco."
And I think it also does reference alcohol

2 history Michigan this kind of information went.
3
4
Q.
Just to show how far back into the educational
And finally we have the entry for textbooks,
correct?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. And within that there are eight textbooks that
7
are listed here?
8 A. Yeah.
9 Q. Which of these textbooks would Mitchell
10 Buchanan have learned from during his education in
11 Michigan?
12
A.
Those were the textbooks that showed up under
13 the book list information and the curriculum guide and
14 syllabi information.
15
And as I looked at them or listed them, just
16 under textbooks, most of them, perhaps one exemption are
17 nationally published textbooks, which were used in this
18 time period and have individual chapters on smoking and
19 tobacco.
20
Q.
Are you able to -- let's ask you about one by
21 one.

23 when, Mr. Buchanan would have learned from this textbook
24 during his school career?
25
The first entry, a "Brownell Health Problem,

Again, if the textbook would have been in '42,
110
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 so it would have been roughly when he was probably
2 entering high school.
3
Q.
So is it your opinion that in 1942 and
4 thereafter this was one of the textbooks that was used
5 in a class of Mr. Buchanan's.
6
7
8
9
A.
Yes.
Because remember by that time these
textbooks were provided free to the state.
Q.
But regardless of that, it's your opinion that,
yes, you can say that Mr. Buchanan learned from this
10 book starting in at least 1942 "Brownell Health
11 Problem"?
12
13
14
A.
Not that he specifically learned from it, but
it was available in the school system in Michigan.
Q.
That's kind what I want to ferret out.
Whether
15 it was recommended to be available, or it was actually
16 used in any of the classes attended by Mr. Buchanan.
17 And your opinion is the former, right?
18 based upon these lists and things that we just talked
19 about, it was a book that was available to be used in a
20 school system in Michigan starting in 1942, right?
That it was

3
4
5
A.
It's another one of these national textbooks
used in the Michigan system, yes.
Q.
But it's your opinion that Mr. Buchanan used
6 this particular book or learned from this particular
7 book at some point in his schooling?
8 A. No, I don't know that.
9 Q. The third one on the list, "Charters" --
10 entitled, "Charters Living Healthfully 1935."
11 your opinion that starting in 1935 and thereafter
12 Mr. Buchanan would have learned from this particular
13 textbook?

No.
But it was a grade school textbook used in
the school system.

11 whether or not Mr. Buchanan, during his schooling, was
12 exposed or learned from these particular textbook,

14 A. That's correct.

2 poison or how it harmed the body, he actually had a
3 section that discussed longevity and tobacco smoking.
4 And he referred to the 1938 Raymond Pearl study on
5 longevity and smoking.

Q.
And it's one of the few
Do you know if Mr. Buchanan was ever exposed to
this pamphlet or the teachings within this pamphlet
during his high school career, or school career rather?
11 A. Not specifically.
12 Q. So although it's not a textbook it's a
But it was available.
13 pamphlet, it still falls into the same general category
14 as the others.
15 and when Mr. Buchanan was ever exposed to the content?
It was available, but you don't know if
16 A. That's correct.
17 Q. You can't put any of these textbooks in his
18
hand, correct?
19 A. True.
20 Q. You can't put any of these textbooks in any of

24
25
his teachers hands, correct?
A.
Well, maybe with less conviction.
I'm assuming
they had them in their hands.
Q.
You can't put any of these textbooks in the
hands of any of the teachers that Mr. Buchanan had when
114
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
he was in there -- that teacher's class, correct?
2 A. That's correct.
3 Q. You mentioned legislation here today.
4
And I
know you've testified about it in the past.
5 What you talked about today, you talked about
6 in terms of legislation in Michigan talking about, you
7 know, what should be taught in health class or what
8 should be taught in schools with respect to health and
9 those kinds of things, right?
10
A.
Yes.
Usually they were indicating the
11 teachers, you know, should be educated on the subject
12 and be teaching it.
13
Q.
In the past I've seen you testified about
14 legislation as far as prohibition laws or laws from
15 different states that put an age limit, a minimum age
16 limit, where people can buy cigarettes and those kinds
17 of things, right?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. Now, on the resource list you listed under the
20 heading "Legislation," which is numeral five on page 3
21 of section A, that's the prohibition law that we're
22 talking about, right?
23 A. Exactly, yes.
24 Q. I've gone through this list and I don't see any
25
prohibition laws for the state of Michigan.
Is that
115
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
true?
2 A. That's correct.
3 Q. So let me ask you a couple of questions about
4 the states on that list.
5 including other state law, prohibition law, or laws
6 regarding the sale of cigarettes?
7 including those on your resource list for this case?

A.
What's the purpose of
What's the purpose of
It's a very simple answer.
When laws do get
passed, they usually are reflecting the activity on
10 certain subject matters.
11 smoking.
12 the first part of the 20th Century was such that state
13 legislatures began to take up the issue of whether or
14 not minors should smoke.
15 extensive nature of that kind of information resulting
16 in actual legislation, again indicating that very often
17 when there's information out there in the public domain
18 after a certain point, you do get a definite legislative
19 action taken on behalf of that particular group or that
20 particular position.
21
Q.
In this case cigarette
And the actions of reform groups beginning in
And so this shows is the
Is there any testimony about Mitchell Buchanan,
22 at least when he was still living in Michigan, having
23 knowledge about any other state laws with respect to
24 prohibition of sale of cigarettes or they placed a
25 minimum age on the purchase of cigarettes?
116
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. No.
2 Q. So you can't say what, if anything, the impact
Because of his age there isn't.
3 of, say for example, prohibition laws in the state of
4 Washington, what impact they might have had on Mitchell
5 Buchanan when he was growing up, can you?
6 A. No.
7 Q. And likewise, for prohibition laws for states
8 such as North Dakota, Iowa, Florida, Oklahoma,
9 Wisconsin, you don't what, if any, impact those might

17
18
have had on a teenage Mitchell Buchanan.
A.
No.
Correct?
I can't because most of them would have
been repealed by the time he was a teenager.
Q.
Do you have an opinion as to when Mitchell
Buchanan started smoking or smoked his first cigarette?
A.
It appears to be around I think 1945, '46.
think there's some reference to him being perhaps 15.
Q.
Do you recall -- and you say reference, I'm
assuming your reference from the deposition testimony?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Do you recall who testified to that?
21 A. I don't offhand.
22
23
I
Though, I think it was his
wife.
Q.
And then when you gave me your opinions, we
24 talked about the newspaper and educational system.
25 the information you gathered from friends and family
And

3 examples.
4 anti-smoking assembly.
5 started talking about it.
6 about Mr. Buchanan stopping smoking and her relating it
7 to health reasons, correct?
You gave us a couple of
The kids when they came back from the
The sister-in-law who then
Mrs. Buchanan gave testimony
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. Are there other any other specific -- excuse
10 me.
11 that you're basing this aspect of your opinion on?
12 We've talked about the anti-smoking assembly from the
13 sons.
14 as an opportunity to talk to Mr. Buchanan about it.
15 Ms. Buchanan's testimony about stopping smoking.
16 wondering if you can point me to any other examples that
17 you used to support this aspect of your opinion?
18
Is there any particular testimony in the deposition
The sister-in-law, Sally Fair, who had used that
A.
Yes.
So I'm
I think there was a coworker of his named
19 Eric Tourna, T-O-U-R-N-A, who said that he worked with
20 him, of course, noted the fact that he smoked.
21 said that he assumes he knew smoking was bad for him
22 because he was such an intelligent adult.
But also
23 Q. Is there any other testimony besides that?
24 A. There might be.
25
But I think in one instance
one of the wives, perhaps, of the son, might have been

2 that she was assuming that he knew there was -- yes,
3 it's his wife who said -- in essence says that she knew
4 it was bad for her when she started smoking in 1970, and
5 everyone knew about that time including Ike.
I'm not sure.
I think she indicated
6 Q. Okay.
7 A. There may have been a couple others.
8
9
But those
are the only ones that stick out.
Q.
Would you expect that if there are other --
10 it's certainly not a memory test.
11 others you would have noted them on Exhibit 1, which is
12 the notes -- your notes from this case?
But if there are
13 A. Very definitely.
14 Q. Let's go through your expert disclosure, and
15 that probably the best way if we cover everything.
16 We'll show you the expert disclosure in this case.
17 A. Okay.
18 Q. And just so we're talking about the same thing,
I've got it in front of me now.
19 your entry number 6 on page 5 of defendant's U.S.
20 Phillip Morris, Inc.'s expert witness disclosure.
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. And, of course, the first paragraph is just a
23 quick summary of your experience and the course of
24 extensive -- I want to skip over that because it is
25 contained in your CV, correct?
119
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Yes.
2 Q. Pretty lengthy CV.
3
And it also makes me tired looking at it.
Page 6 says, "Dr. Hoff is expected to testify
4 that the public has long been aware of the health risks
5 of smoking cigarettes as well as the habit forming of
6 the addictive nature of cigarette."
Period.
Correct?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. Now, as far as I interpret it, that's a little
9
10
11
bit different than talking about Mr. Buchanan
specifically, correct?
A.
Well, it, again, shows the comprehensive
12 research I did outside of the specific research for this
13 case, yes.
14
Q.
So, yes, this instance is talking about the
15 public at large and not yet, at least, specifically
16 Mr. Buchanan, correct?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. So can you tell me what your opinion -- I mean,
19 is that your opinion, then, with respect to the public
20 at large that they've long been aware of the addictive
21 health risks of smoking cigarettes as well as the habit
22 forming or addictive nature of cigarettes?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. "Long been aware."
25
subjective term.
Long is certainly a

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 what year are you saying that there was general

A.
Well, it depends on how far back you want to
4 go.
5 studies.
6 the late part of the 19th Century and the 1880s, 1990s,
7 again, you have the health risks being talked about in
8 newspapers, you have these reform groups that I've
9 already mentioned agitating for or against cigarette
But that's why I included some of those historical
But if you just go back to the 20th Century or
10 smoking, and you have legislation being passed where the
11 legislators themselves are recognizing the health risks
12 in passing the legislation.
13
You have the prohibition laws we talked about.
14 And so you've got an abundance of information of
15 activities and available information in the public
16 domain on the health risks of smoking and the habit
17 forming and addictive nature of cigarettes.
18
19
20
Q.
So when, then, did the public become aware of
the health risks of smoking cigarette?
A.
They would have been aware in these very
21 general terms of the health risks from the -- at least
22 from the beginning of the 20th Century forward.
23 that awareness simply increased in the course of the
24 20th Century.
25
Q.
And
What about as far as the habit forming or the

(212) 490-34301 addictive nature of cigarettes?
2 become aware of the habit forming or addictive nature of
3 cigarettes?
4
A.
When did the public
The same answer would apply.
Again, you would

7 these stories.

11
It was used in connection with the
So the same
the early part of the 20th Century.
Q.
And you base that opinion on the materials on
12 your resource list and, of course, your education,
13 training and experience, correct?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. The next sentence says, "Dr. Hoff's testimony
16 will address historical methodology, general awareness
17 of the health risks and habit forming or addictive
18 nature of smoking in both national and local sources of
19 awareness."
20
And I think we've talked about that.
And the
21 sources at least -- the national local sources are at
22 least reflected in your resource list, correct?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. And we talked about your methodology.
25
And I
know you testified about your specific methodology in
122
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
the past, right?
2 A. Correct.
3 Q. And the last sentence in that paragraph, "She
4
is also expected" -- well, strike that.
5
With regard to the second paragraph -- excuse
6 me, second sentence is there anything else you'd like to
7 add or you would like to add over and above what we've
8 discussed today?
9
A.
10
11
Let me look it again.
I don't think so.
Q.
The last sentence in that paragraph, "She is
12 also expected to testify to both types of awareness have
13 long been reflected and reinforced in virtually every
14 aspect of American society."
15 types of awareness.
16 local awareness?
17
18

20
A.
The reference to both

I'm referring there to the risks and the habit
forming.
Q.
I see.
Okay.
Both types meaning health
risks --
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Okay.
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. And that sentence is incorporated in the things
25
I got you.
we've been talking about today, that it's your opinion
123
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 that the public has been long aware of these things,
2 right?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. Is there anything beyond what we've discussed
5 today or in addition to what we've discussed today with
6 respect to that sentence that you would like to add?
7 A. No.
8 Q. Next paragraph, "Dr. Hoff may also opine about
9
the nature, source and extent of awareness of the risks
10 of smoking, including the fact that it's difficult to
11 quit throughout the country, and even in the environment
12 in which Mr. Buchanan lived."
13 today?
Have we talked about that
14 A. I think we have.
15 Q. Is there anything else you would like to add
16
pertaining to that sentence --
17 A. No.
18 Q. -- beyond --
19 A. No.
20 Q. No problem.
21
Sorry to interrupt.
I'm surprised.
That sounds like
the first time that has happened today.
22 The last paragraph, "Dr. Hoff may also offer
23 opinion and testimony in response to issues raised by
24 plaintiff and plaintiff expert witnesses and may be
25 asked to comment on the testimony and opinions of other
124

2 expertise."

4
Have you read any depositions in this case in
any of plaintiff's expert?
5 A. No, I have not.
6 Q. You talked about generally in the work you've
7 done in this type of tobacco litigation.
8 point in time, you estimated eight or so years ago, you
9 might have read something of Louis Kyriakoudes, right?
That at one
10 A. That's correct.
11 Q. Have you seen plaintiff's expert witness
12
disclosure in this case?
13 A. No, I have not.
14 Q. Have you seen a plaintiff expert witness
15
disclosure in any of the cases you've been disclosed in?
16 A. Any of these Engle cases?
17 Q. Yes, ma'am.
18 A. No, I have not.
19 Q. Bear with me for with one second.

I didn't

21
Have you ever heard of Michael Cummings?
22 A. I don't believe so.

6
I don't think I have, no.
What about the gentleman by the name of David
If it's the Burnes that wrote a book about
tobacco, I'm familiar with the name.
7 Q. I don't know if that's the Burnes that --
8 A. I think it's probably not.
9
10
I think his name is
Burnhem, I'm sorry.
Q.
Okay.
To your knowledge have you read any
11 prior litigation related testimony or reports of a David
12 Burnes?
13 A.
No, I haven't.
14 Q.
Same question with respect to Dr. Alan
15
Steingold?
16 A. No, I have not.
17 Q. William Farone (phonetic), same question.
18 A. No.
19 Q. "Dr. Hoff, also with respect to reviewing
20 interrogatory responses, deposition testimony and other
21 material identified through ongoing discovery on which
22 she may rely for her opinions in this case."
23
I guess we haven't really fully explored what
24 you relied on.
25 testimony, correct?
But I know you relied on deposition
126
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Yes.
2 Q. And also interrogatory responses in this case,
3
right?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. Is there any other case specific discovery
6
material in this case that you relied on?
7 A. Not that I can think of.
8 Q. Medical records, for example, have you seen any
9
medical records of Mr. Buchanan?
10 A. No.
11 Q. Your research in this case is ongoing, correct?
12 A. True.
13 Q. And I don't have a date in which this expert
14 disclosure was filed.
15 the date the expert disclosure was filed, correct?
But I assume that was true as of
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. Is it true of today, are you still doing
18
19
research in this case?
A.
Basically in this case I've been reviewing
20 research, but nothing that we haven't previously
21 discussed.
22
Q.
And when you say reviewing research, you mean
23 the newspaper articles that you or your research

And as far as we sit here today, have you done

I believe so.
As it's reflected in that

It says, after the semicolon, "Consequently she

And I know, again, this was written a while
But do
10 you expect to review any additional materials in the
11 course of your research in this case?
12 A. Not as of today.
13 Q. And the last paragraph talks about the sources
14 of your opinion, what you base it on.
15 you've discussed that, and is also reflected in your
16 resource list, correct?
17
A.
18
19
And I think
Yes.

14 those polls if we can.
15 including those three polls in your reliance list on
16 this case?
17
A.
What's the significance of
I include them only when I came to my general
18 awareness conclusions, from the date that I've indicated
19 previously to see if my opinion about the availability
20 of this type of information, and its accessibility to
21 the general public and its existence in the public
22 domain was corroborated by some early polls, which as
23 you can see taken in '54 and '57.

11
12
A.
Let's talk about the January 19,
Do you know when this poll was
I think it was conducted, the first one was
conducted in January.
Q.
Yeah.
I think it indicates that.
I think within the month.
Do you know
what day within the month of 1950?
13 A. Offhand I don't, no.
14 Q. Certainly --
15 A. It looks like it was conducted on zero date.
16 Q. Is that what it says on --
17 A. That's what it says here.
18
19
I'm sorry, I don't
know the exact date.
Q.
20
Okay.
No problem.
Is there a specific question within the poll --
21 I know there were numerous questions posed to the
22 respondents.
23 materials from that poll that you feel corroborates your
24 opinions in this case?
25
A.
Is there a specific question and specific

question about awareness that I'm referencing there.

8
9
A.
I think, if I'm not mistaken, there's only one
question dealing with awareness in that poll.
Q.
Let me pull it up.
When you say "awareness,"
what type of awareness are you talking about?
A.
It's very general question in both of those
10 polls in January and June.
11 the relationship of cigarette smoking to lung cancer?"
12
Q.
Okay.
It was, "Were you aware of
I pulled it up, the actual entry on your
13 resource list.
14 anything recently that cigarette smoking may be a cause
15 of cancer of the lung?"
16 referring to?
It says, "Have you heard or read
Is that the question you're
17 A. Yes, that's the question of awareness, yes.
18 Q. Okay.
19 A. Read it to me again.
20 Q. Yes, ma'am.
21
From here on this document I have, which is
22 Gallop Poll January of 1954, it says, "QK 15.
23 heard or read anything recently that cigarette smoking
24 may be a cause of cancer of the lung?"

(212) 490-34301
Q.
And underneath that it says, "83 percent, have
2 heard or read."
3 the question you're talking about?
And then it says, "18 no."
And that's
4 A. Yes, I am.
5 Q. What does that question and the resulting 83
6 percent to answer yes they have heard or read, what does
7 that tell you, if anything?
8
A.
Well, it tells me is that because of this
9 explosion of information based on scientific studies
10 from the early '50s until '54 that these studies did
11 indeed get into the public domain through the materials
12 that I've already talked about.
13 instance 83 percent of Americans sampled in this study
14 had read or heard about the connection between smoking
15 and lung cancer.
16
And that in this
What I was trying to do is to test how
17 widespread this information was, because these early
18 studies received a good deal of publicity.
19
Q.
Underneath that I asked you a question about
20 when it was conducted.
21 benefit of having this up.
22 says, "Methodology:
23 January 9 to January 14, 1954.
24 interviews with an national adult of sample of 1500."
25
But I don't think you have the

(212) 490-34301 from January 9 to January 14, 1954.
2 your recollection about when the poll was conducted?
Does that refresh
3 A. Yes, it does.
4 Q. Now, the question itself I'll read to you
5 again.
6 cigarette smoking may be a cause of cancer of the lung?"
7 Does the word "recently" have any impact or any
8
9
"Have you heard or read anything recently that
import to you at all as it pertains to this question?
A.
I'm not a poll expert.
But what I was trying
10 to determine was how widely this information on these
11 early studies had been spread or had been introduced
12 into the public domain.
13 would have been referring to the largely to the '53 and
14 '54 studies.
15 Q.
16
So "recently" in this instance
You're familiar with the Frank statement to
cigarette smokers, correct?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. And you're familiar that that was an ad, for
19 lack of a better word, that appeared in many newspapers
20 across the country, right?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. And are you familiar with what date the Frank
23
statement ran in the newspapers across the country?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. Of what year?
It ran on January 4.
133
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. I'm sorry.
2 Q. Do you know if in between January 4, 1954 and
Of 1954.
3 January 9, 1954 if there were any other articles
4 appearing in any of the newspapers that you've cited
5 here in your resource materials:
6 Union, the Lake City Reporter, Stars and Stripes,
7 Saginaw News?
8 dealing with cigarette smoking and health hazards on
9 January 5, 6, 7 or 8, 1954?
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
A.
The Florida Times
Do you know if there's any articles
I don't know specifically for those dates.
But
I can certainly look it up.
Q.
As you sit here right now, do you know off the
top of your head?
A.
No, I don't.
Because it's so time specific.
But as I said I certainly could look it up.
Q.
Let's talk about the next poll, Gallop Poll
June 17, 1954.
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. Again, you've included this.
Would it be fair
20 to assume you included this for the same purpose you
21 included in the January 19, '54 poll?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. I'll represent to you I've pulled it out and
24 the question that's asked, let me make sure.
25 me ask you this:
Well, let
Do you know off the top of your head

2

4
how many questions were important to you from this poll?
A.
Again, as with the previous one, it's the first
question on awareness.
Q.
At least the first question that pops up here,
5 which is similar to the one asked in January 1954, "Have
6 you heard or read anything recently to the effect that
7 cigarette smoking may be a cause of cancer of the lung?"
8 Is that the poll question you're thinking of?
9 A. Yes, it is.
10 Q. 90 percent yes, 10 percent no?
11 A. Correct.
12 Q. And finally, Gallop Poll July 1957, let me see
13 if we can identify the question or questions that you
14 were looking for.
15 1957 Gallop Poll, "Did you happen to read or hear about
16 the recent report of the American Cancer Society
17 reporting the results of a study of the effect of
18 cigarette smoking?"
The first question that appeared July
19 A. Yes, that's the question.
20 Q. Is that the only one from this poll that you
21
are utilizing in your opinion?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. And it says "yes 78 percent, no 23 percent"?
24 A. Yes, that's correct.
25 Q. Now, these three poll questions that we've just
135
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 identified, these are what you would call awareness
2 questions, right?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. They don't answer what a certain person
5
believes, correct?
6 A. True.
7 Q. It doesn't speak to from what source a person
8 may have heard or read about the information about
9 cigarette smoking and health hazard, right?
10
11
12
A.
Well, in the '57 poll it does refer to the
American Cancer Society study.
Q.
Right.
But even then it doesn't say where this
13 person might have read or heard about the American
14 Cancer Society, right?
15 A. That's true.
16 Q. So for example, it could have been in a
17
newspaper article, right?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. It could have been -- well, were or was the
20 result of the American Cancer Society study that this
21 question is talking about, was that reported on the
22 evening news anywhere that you know of?
23
A.
Well, in terms on the '57 study, you would have
24 had, by that time you would have had, the '57 expert
25 reports coming out of the government and you would have
136
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 had, by that time also, another Hammond and Horn report,
2 which would have been sponsored by the American Cancer
3 Society.
4
5
So what was the question?
Q.
The question was:
We don't know -- these
6 questions, all these questions, don't identify, they
7 can't identify the source of where the respondent heard
8 the information, right?
9
10
11
12
A.
No.
But there would have been television
coverage also in '55 on some of these studies.
Q.
Did you do any research into cigarette
advertising when you were doing research in this case?
13 A. No.
14 Q. And your work in any of the Florida tobacco
15 Engle cases have you done any research into cigarette
16 advertising?
17 A. No, I have not.
18 Q. In your research did you ever come across any
19 information that addressed how much monetarily companies
20 like Phillip Morris spent on advertising their
21 cigarettes?
22
A.
I may have come across some articles reporting
23 on sales of cigarettes in my research in newspapers.
24 But other than that, just to include it in the resource
25 materials, I didn't do anything else with it.

The response would depend on
12 perhaps the study or the article in which the response
13 occurred.
14 little general.
15
So ask me the question again.
BY MR. BASS:
Q.
Yeah.
It was a
I was just wondering
16 during any of your research in this case, if you come
17 across any public statement attributable to any of these
18 entities, Tobacco Institute, Tobacco Industry Research
19 Committee, Counsel For Tobacco Research, wherein
20 statement was to the effect of we agree cigarette
21 smoking is dangerous to your health?
22 A. Not in those terms, no.
23 Q. In any statements that you found attributable
24 to any of these entities impact your opinion in this
25 case?

4 in my mind as I was coming to some of my general
5 opinions.
6
BY MR. BASS:
Q.
So no public statement
7 attributable to any of these entities -- well, strike
8 that.
9 Dr. Hoff, if you can just give me one moment.
10 If we can go off the record I can run through my notes
11 and see if we're all done.
