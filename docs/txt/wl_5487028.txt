EXAMINATION BY
MS. BUCHANAN:
Q. Good morning, Professor Dáiz. My name is Christine Buchanan, and I represent R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in the
lawsuit of Blanca Nieves Rodriguez versus R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company that we're here about today.
Did you receive a Subpoena to come here today?
A. No. I received a call.
Q. From whom was the call?
A. (Indicating).
MS. ROTGERS: I was the first?
THE WITNESS: Yes.
Q. That's fine.
Have you ever been deposed before?
A. No.
Q. I'll go over a few ground rules, since you haven't been deposed before.
If you don't understand a question I ask, please say so. If you notice, the deposition is being taken in English because this
particular lawsuit is filed in the Federal Court in San Juan, so proceedings have to be in English.
We do have a translator here for you. Please feel free to use him whatever you want, either to translate my questions or your
answers. Whatever you're most comfortable with.
If you need to take a break at any time, please let me know. If you like some water, something to drink or go to the rest room,
Just say so and we will take a break.
A. Okay.
Q. Also, it is very important, for the sake of the court reporter, that you answer verbally to every answer as opposed to nodding
or shaking your head. And to the best of your ability, answer as loudly as possible -
A. Okay.
Q. -- so that her microphone can pick it up and she can hear what you're saying.
During the course of the deposition, the Plaintiff's attorney in this case may object to a question. If she does object, we will deal
with the objection. Usually you can go ahead and answer the question, but we will deal with that as we come to it.
First of all, are you taking any medication or anything today that would affect your ability to testify truthfully?

3Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. I don't think so. I do drink Glucotrol for my diabetes; just small quantity.
Q. Does your diabetes affect your ability to remember?
A. No.
Q. Were you contacted about bringing certain documents with you to your deposition today?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you bring some documents today?
A. I send them.
Q. You sent them?
A. Yes.
Q. Where did you send them?
A. To (indicating).
MS. MARTÍNEZ: To our office?
THE WITNESS: Yes.
MS. MARTÍNEZ: I haven't been in the office, Christine, so I would have to ask the secretary.
MS. BUCHANAN: We really need his documents before we can complete his deposition. So, we may have to go as far as his
deposition today and finish it later because I cannot complete his deposition without the documents.
MS. MARTÍNEZ: ‘??Que completo eran?’
THE WITNESS: ‘La deposición, un curriculum vitae’.
THE INTERPRETER: The deposition, curriculum vitae and some exhibits.
Q. Is that what you sent to the lawyers at Plaintiffs' office?
A. Yes.
Q. Let's mark this as the first exhibit, and I'm going to ask you if this is what you sent them.
(Defendants' Exhibit 1, Dr. Díaz' report with attachments, marked for identification, as of this date.)
Q. These are things we received from Plaintiffs' counsel. I know It has a cover letter from her. I'll ask you to look through it
and tell me if that's what you sent to her.

4Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
(Witness reviewing document.)
A. (Via Interpreter) Yes. This was it.
Q. Is this everything that you sent to Plaintiffs' counsel?
A. Yes.
MS. MARTÍNEZ: So that solves your problem.
A. With photocopies of some diaries.
Q. With a box of some photocopies of diaries?
A. Yes. Diaries. Journals.
Q. Like articles?
A. (Via Interpreter) Newspapers.
Q. Articles from magazines, newspapers?
A. Yes. Yes.
Q. That box of documents, you sent that to Plaintiffs' counsel?
A. It's at the office.
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Okay.
MS. BUCHANAN: That's what we need that we cant complete the deposition without.
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Okay.
MS. BUCHANAN: Well need to have that.
Q. In that box of documents, what was in there? Generally describe it.
A (Via Interpreter) There were some articles related to smoking from the 1930s, some things to 1970s. But they didn't have
much of an impact on me because that was not what I was looking for.
Q. Where did you get those documents?
A. I found some of them at Ms. Arocho's law office, and the others from the archives at the library of the Catholic University.
Q. You got some of these from Ms. Arocho's office?
A. Yes.

5Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. How did that come about?
A. During the first meeting that we had when they called me to see if I would accept this appointment.
Q. So, Ms. Arocho gave you these documents?
A. Yes.
Q. What specifically did she tell you about the document, if anything?
A. That these were some of the documents that previously some other person had utilized for their law firm.
Q. Did you review those documents that Ms. Arocho gave to you?
A. Yes.
Q. How many documents did she give you?
A. There are quite a lot. I think that there must be 300 to 400. Three to 400.
Q. Is that most of what was in the box?
A. Yes.
Q. Then you said you found some articles yourself in the library in the university in Ponce?
A. I started to search on my own from newspapers that maybe had not been searched through.
Q. What newspapers?
A. The El Mundo newspaper, and some issues of El Imparcial, and one for El Día. Not El Nuevo Día, but El Día.
Q. How many articles did you find yourself?
A. Well, I found some -- in reality, I didn't find articles as such. But I did find some publicity, some advertising for the tobacco
companies and cigarette companies.
Q. Was everything you found advertising for cigarettes?
A. Yes.
Q. Is that all you were looking for?
A. I was looking for any notice by the Government of Puerto Rico or any of the pertaining agencies of the Government of
Puerto Rico notifying people of the fact that tobacco may cause any damage to health, that tobacco may be harmful to health,
notifying the people in Puerto Rico.
Q. Were you looking for any information from anyone other than the Government of Puerto Rico or one of its agencies?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
6Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. Any information related to this.
Q. So, you were looking for any information related to smoking and health?
A. Yes.
Q. And you say all you found were some tobacco advertisements?
A. Well, not only that. There were some articles in relation to the tobacco industry, the farming, agriculture and funding for
the tobacco crops and things like that.
Q. Did you find any articles at all about smoking and health?
A. I found -- yes. I did find one or two in relation to the possibility of scheduling seminars to give guidance to people so they
would not smoke or advice.
Q. Is that this?
A. Yes, that's it.
Q. I'm referring to the first attachment to Exhibit No. 1, called, ‘Dr. Isadora Martinez Recomienda Campaña Educativa Para
Evitar Escolares Se Inicien En E Habito De Fumar’. Is that it?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you find articles other than that one?
A. No.
Q. For what time periods were you looking at these newspapers?
A. I was notified that I should do so from the '30s up until 1969 or '70.
Q. Was your review of those three newspapers, El Mundo, El Imparcial and El Día for that time period, was your review
complete?
A. No, not completely, because many of them were not complete in the archives.
Q. Do you think there were articles on smoking and health in those newspapers during that time period that you didn't find?
A. I don't think that they were.
However, if there were, it would be my mistake on the safe side. But I don't think that there were many as such. Because it is
my belief that during that period of time, the Government of Puerto Rico and its agencies were not as concerned about this in
particular. Because for that period of time, during the '50s and the '60s, smoking was in.
Q. Why do you say that? What is your proof of that?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
7Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. Well, first of all, the movies and on TV and at the movie houses always would show somebody smoking, and not necessarily
advertising smoking, you know. But it was a life-style.
Then there were some important people and leaders in Puerto Rico who at that time, during that period, were smokers.
Q. You talked about movies. What movies did you see people smoking in?
A. I can't remember the titles right now. But Casablanca for one.
Q. Did you review movies as part of your study for this--
A. Not necessarily, no.
Q. So you're just relying from your recollection-
A. Yes.
Q. -- from having lived in Puerto Rico --
A. Yes.
Q. -- during the '50s and '60s?
A. Yes. Because I'm also involved in this matter because of history. I am a history professor, so I need to study not only the
old and antiquity part, but also the newer portions of our history.
Q. We will get to that kind of a study in just a moment.
Before we go any further, I want to ask you: You said what was in that box of documents didn't have any impact on you because
it was not what you were looking for. What do you mean by that?
A. Well, first of all, I read all of them. And what I found did not fulfill what I was looking for.
Q. What were you looking for?
A. Any notices by the government or any government agency asking or advising people that smoking may be harmful to their
health.
Q. We talked about most of the documents in that box, and I think you said that you didn't find yourself, that someone else
had found or Ms. Arocho had provided them to you.
A. Yes. I was not able to find any there, and neither was I able to find any in the search that I conducted myself through the
newspaper issues.
Q. Do you know anything about who collected the documents that Ms. Arocho provided to you?
A. No. No. I don't think so. I don't know. But I believe that it must have been the person who was working with this previously.
Q. Do you know anything about how that person conducted his or her research?

8Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. No.
Q. Do you know anything about whether his or her research was complete?
A. I would not be able to state, so unless I were to see a report or something.
Q. That box of documents, is that everything you reviewed in preparation for forming your opinions In this case?
A. No. I told you that I also went to the archives of the library of the Catholic University, and I also tried to visit the archives of
the Health Department. I requested to see whether the documents were available for that period. But apparently, either they're
not there or they threw them out or they just didn't want to show them.
Q. What I'm trying to find out, I'm trying to find out the universe of all of the sources that you considered in forming your
opinions. Would they all be included in that box?
A. Well, that completed quite a lot, because it avoided me from having to go to another archive, you know. For example, this
article apparently was not there. And then I conducted interviews of people who were smokers or the children of smokers. The
children. The thing is that children, you really think that they're small children. And I always asked whether they had received
any notice from the government or any agency for them not to smoke.
Q. What I'm trying to figure out, Professor. In forming your opinion, I want to understand all of the sources.
I think you talked about the interviews that you conducted, you talked about your contact with the Health Department, is that
right, and the box of documents? Is that everything that you considered?
A. The newspapers in the archives.
Q. The newspapers in the archives that you found ourselves?
A. (Witness nodding.)
Q. Those newspapers in the archives that you found yourself, are they also included in the box that you sent to Ms. Arocho?
A. No.
Q. Do you know where they are?
A. (English) At the university.
(Via Interpreter) At the university. At the library of the university.
Q. Did you not make photocopies of those?
A. No. Because these were not what I was looking for.
Q. What was it that you saw that you didn't make copies of because it wasn't what you were looking for?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
9Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. I saw some or rather a lot, a lot of advertising, publicity regarding smoking. You know, smoke and smoke and smoke. Well,
here was Chesterfield and Camel. There was a Cavalier, which I didn't know about, and a Lark.
Q. Would that be the entire universe of sources that you considered?
A. It was a sample of that universe.
Q. I'm trying to understand everything that you reviewed in arriving at your opinions.
Everything that you described to me, the documents in the archives, your contacts with the Health Department, the interviews
that you conducted plus what was in the box of documents, that everything you considered in reaching your opinion?
A. In that box of photocopies, there were some photocopies of journals of medicine, the articles from the magazines. And those
magazines did mention, they did talk about the harm that cigarettes could cause. However, those magazines were not within the
reach of the mass of people in Puerto Rico. They were known among the peers. You know, among the doctors in that community.
MO MS. BUCHANAN: I'm going to move to strike as nonresponsive.
Q. I want to understand all of the information that you considered in reaching your opinions today.
I want to make sure I have everything. The interviews you conducted, your contacts with the Health Department, the documents
that you looked at in the archive, the newspaper articles and such, and then the box of documents that was provided you by
Ms. Arocho.
Is that everything that you considered in reaching your opinions?
A. Did you mention the interviews?
Q. I did.
A. Yes. Yes.
Q. So that would be everything?
A. Yes.
RQ MS. BUCHANAN: We're, obviously, going to have that box before we finish his deposition, so we will need you to get
that to us as soon as possible.
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Okay.
MS. BUCHANAN: We probably have to stop part way through today and reconvene in order to finish his deposition, because
we have to have the documents so we can ask him specifically about the documents.
Q. For this deposition today, did you do anything to prepare for it?
A. I'm sorry. Could you repeat your question?
Q. Certainly. Did you do anything to prepare for your deposition here today?

10Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. Yes. I read and reread some of those things, and I also read the deposition in order to refresh my recollection.
Q. You said you read a deposition, what deposition did you read?
A. My deposition.
Q. Do you mean what's been marked?
A. Yes.
Q. So, your expert report?
A. Yes.
Q. What else did you read?
A. For this today? Only that and the documentation.
Q. I think you told me earlier that you had met with Plaintiffs' counsel several times. How many times did you meet with
Plaintiffs' counsel?
A. Yes. There was one time and there was another. One time I met with her at the law firm. And the second time I met with
Ms. Arocho was when I took the documents. And then she told me that everything was ready for the 21st. And then there were
also some telephone calls.
Q. So, you had two meetings and some telephone calls?
A. Yes.
Q. When were you first contacted by Plaintiffs' counsel?
A. My first contact was when I received a fax at the university, that they were looking for some people who knew about these
matters, who were historians who might be interested in working, if they were interested, in these tobacco cases.
Q. What did you do after you received that fax?
A. I was interested. I was interested in this. Because although it was not related with tobacco as such in history, it was related
with farming in the case of coffee.
Q. So, did you call Ms. Arocho?
A. I called. I didn't know who it was, but I called the law firm.
Q. When you called the law firm, with whom did you speak?
A. Well, first it was the secretary, and I think from there it went to Counsel Adi Martinez.
Q. What were you told about this job?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
11Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. I was told that they were looking for a person, for someone who knew about tobacco in Puerto Rico, and who would be able
to testify in a particular case as an expert in that sense, a historical expert or a historian expert.
Q. Were you told what kind of questions, what kind of historical questions you would be dealing with?
A. Gosh, I don't remember if we spoke about that in particular. But I was advised that I would be asked about the possibility of
the government in Puerto Rico having an interest in advising people about the dangers of smoking.
And I was advised about three points in particular, which are included in my deposition, which are on page 2. It's Paragraph
1,2,3, numbered 1, 2,3: “Whether the Puerto Rican people were warned about the damages associated with tobacco use before
1969; whether the common mass of citizen knew or should know that smoking cigarettes was and/or caused addiction”; and
“Whether it was common knowledge of the general mass of citizens between 1930 and 1969, about the health damage related
to tobacco use (smoking).”
Q. It seems in your response, that you were relating this to whether the government had an interest in advising people and
whether the government was warning people.
Is that specifically what your question means, “Whether the Puerto Rican people were warned about the damages associated
with tobacco use before 1969, because the government warned them?
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
Q. You can go ahead and answer.
A. Yes. It has to be so. Because if the people were not advised, who would advise them?
Q. So, all of your questions would be directed to whether the government had specifically warned the people; is that right?
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
A. Not necessarily. It was whether people were advised.
Q. That first telephone conversation you had with Ms. Martínez, did you discuss anything else?
A. No. She told me that the deposition and the report, the study needed to be done quickly. And the research, the investigation
needed to be done quickly, and the report needed to be ready before August 30th.
Q. Is that all you discussed in that first all, to the best of your recollection?
A. No. We also spoke about the historical aspects. I spoke about the idiosyncracy of the Puerto Rican people and its relation
with tobacco and history, at least in the period of the '30s through the '70s, which was a period that I knew firsthand because --
well, at least the period of the '50s and '60s. And I knew that cigarettes were very much ingrained into Puerto Rican society.
Q. Is that all that you talked about during that first telephone call?
A. Counsel here also asked me, or rather she advised me, that in addition to any research conducted in the archives and in the
reading of those photocopies, I could also access the Internet and look for information there, which I also did.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
12Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. Anything else in that first telephone conversation?
A. There may have been some other information.
Q. To the best of your recollection?
A. But we never spoke of any particular case. Now I just remembered that she told me that there was going to be a deposition,
and that there could be a possibility that I would be called to testify at trial. And we also spoke -- now I just remembered some
other things, about how much this job would pay.
Q. And how much did you ask for?
A. Well, in all honesty, I didn't make a request as such at that conversation because I was not aware -- you know, knowledgeable
in these matters. What I did was that I consulted with some friends who are attorneys, and I was told more or less.
Q. And what were you told?
A. Then later I informed them that it was going to be $275 per hour. And although I was told to charge more for the research,
I decided to only charge $2,000.
Q. Why did you decide to just charge $2,000?
A. (English) Pardon me?
Q. Why did you decide to charge only $2,000 for the research?
A. Maybe because of the idiosyncracy of the Puerto Rican people that we don't want to be too much... you know. But I believe
that the work and my lifetime experiences and my academic foundations -- I mean, more or less, when there is a conference
or something, there is a certain request that you make. And in that aspect, I am more or less familiarized. But since this was a
different experience for me, that's why I asked for some advice.
Q. I'm asking specifically: Why did you decide to ask only $2,000 for preparing this expert report?
A. I felt that that was sufficient for the work that I did and the hours that I dedicated to this particular work. Because I had a
person who also helped me in the investigation, in the research of the checking the newspaper.
Q. How many hours did you spend doing this research to prepare this report?
A. I have that written down. I have that in an agenda which I don't have with me now, but I believe it may have been about
30 to 35 hours.
Because as a matter of fact, the same day that I had the meeting at the law office in Utuado, although it is very far from Ponce,
it is about an hour or two, I started working right away. I started reading this. Because I had been asked for this report to be
very quickly done, very expedited.
Q. You said you had another person helping you. Who was that?
A. He's a co-worker, another professor. Professor William Marini is his name.

13Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. What exactly did he do?
A. (English) Pardon me?
Q. What exactly did he do for you?
A. I asked him to go to the archives and check the newspapers. But specifically looking for that notice, notices from the
government or a government agency. As a matter of fact, he was the one who went to the Health Department to try to find
their documentation there.
It was not education, it was the Health Department. But for that, during that particular period of time, there was a problem at
the Department that there were some documents that had been misplaced or lost because of a political matter. There was an
investigation of the former governor of Puerto Rico, and they were trying to find out whether he had worked a certain period
of time at the Health Department or not. And I think that that matter may have had some effect on our search.
Q. So, you think there may have been documents that existed that would have been useful to you but were no longer there
because of that problem?
A. Well, at least statistics.
Q. Which statistics do you think?
A. Statistics about smokers and about people who may have had their health affected.
Q. After that first telephone call that we talked about that you had with Ms. Martínez, was the next contact you had a meeting
In Utuado at Ms. Arocho's office?
A. After the first meeting --
Q. Actually, after the first phone call
A. Well, after the first phone call, what would you like to know?
Q. When was your next contact with them? Was it that meeting that you talked about in Utuado?
A. Well, afterwards, there was another telephone call placed by me because I was a little concerned about all of this. And
when I was preparing the report, I sent her some faxes with rough drafts. And she told me that this was more or less what
she was in need of.
And she asked me to have many of the details, precisely of what we did during the first meeting, to not put them in the report.
Because I read the directions, the instructions that there were to prepare a report, and it said that the details needed to be included.
But I mean, and there are some there, but they're not as specific right now.
Because I expected to include in that report everything that had been said and everything that was spoken about during that
meeting, because she had told me that this was how it was going to be requested. But later, apparently, these were not important.
Q. Let me make sure I understand. I'm trying to put this in chronological order.

14Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
It sounds like what you're telling me occurred after the first meeting. Was there anything that happened after that first telephone
call and the meeting in Utuado? Did you have an contact with Plaintiffs' counsel?
A. No. No.
Q. So, after the first telephone call, you went to meet with her in Utuado?
A. After the first telephone call, I continued working. And then when I had a rough draft more or less ready, I sent it to her. And
she then saw that and she said that it was okay, that I should correct some - it was editing. Some words that were improperly used.
And then I called to schedule a meeting in order to turn this in. Because I could have faxed this or e-mailed it, but then there
was a concern. I mean, I did e-mail it, but, you know, if this didn't go through, I wanted to be sure that I was there in person to
deliver it. And I took it there myself and I met with her. It was a quick meeting because everything was already set. And she
told me that everything was scheduled for September 21st.
Q. By the time you met with Ms. Arocho the first time in person, you already had drafted your report? You had already done
a draft of your report?
A. After the first meeting?
Q. No. Before the first meeting.
It sounds Like what you're describing is that when you went to the first meeting with Ms. Arocho, you already had a draft
of your report?
A. No. I didn't know.
Q. Let me make sure I understand because I'm getting confused.
We talked about the first phone call that you had with Ms. Martínez, right?
A. Well, okay. Right.
Q. Between that first phone call and your first meeting when you went to Utuado, did you have any contact with Plaintiffs'
counsel?
A. No. I then went to Utuado for that meeting.
Q. How long was It between the phone call and the meeting?
A. I think the call was Wednesday and the meeting was Friday.
Q. Then you went to the meeting In Utuado; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. What were you told to do at the meeting while you were in Utuado?

A. They gave me an overview, a description of what was happening with this, and they asked me whether in spite of what they
were telling me, or knowing what they had just informed me, whether I was interested in taking on this job.
Q. What did they tell you specifically?
A. Well, the case was about they were litigating a case about someone who had died from cancer. I don't remember exactly
what it was, but it had to do with this. I mean, I didn't even have the name yet. And there was this need to conduct this research,
that this deposition needed to be prepared, and that there was a possibility that I would need to go to court to testify.
Q. What research were you told needed to be done?
A. The research about whether the people of Puerto Rico knew about the harm caused by cigarette smoking, or whether they
knew that it was addictive, smoking also, and that it could cause, I don't know, heart problems, lung problems.
Q. So, you were generally asked about what Puerto Ricans knew about smoking and health and about addiction or it being
hard to quit?
A. Whether cigarettes caused, or whether they knew that cigarettes could cause an addiction.
Q. Anything else?
A. That was in relation to the three points that we mentioned previously. And it was about that that I started my search.
Q. Did you talk about anything else at that meeting?
A. To tell you the truth, I don't. Maybe throughout the conversation I might be able to remember.
Q. That's fine. If you remember anything, please just let me know.
A. Okay, yes.
Q. Were you given the box of documents at that meeting?
A. Yes. In the first. The first. As a matter of fact, I started reading them that same night.
Q. So, after the meeting you went home and read the box of documents?
A. Yes. I mean, not completely. But at least halfway through that night because, you know, I developed an interest in this.
But we need to remember that my interest in this was from a historical point of view. My interest was not so much as to the
health concerns, but whether the people were informed, whether the government and its agencies had notified, had advised the
people about the possibility of the harmful effect.
Q. Where did your emphasis on whether the government had advised the people come from? Was that something Plaintiffs'
counsel told you or something you came up with yourself?
A. Well, no. The thing is that the government needs to be there to ensure the health of the people of any country. In this particular
case, Puerto Rico. They're the ones who are in charge of the welfare of the people and the education of the people.

And if the government and the health authorities were aware that this could cause harm to people's health, then the government
was responsible. And the government is there by the people and for the people.
Q. Is the government the only source of Information that people have?
A. In Puerto Rico, I would think so.
Q. What Is the basis for that opinion? What do you have to show that opinion to prove that?
A. Well, in Puerto Rico, history has told us that we are a people who follow specific leaders. We are not a people who develop
and were guided in a democratic fashion from the beginning, and we are still learning how to use democracy. But then we
look to our leaders for examples.
And in this case, the leader throughout the '40s, '50s and '60s, who people would see as being the person who was capable of
involving everything was a smoker.
Q. I understand what you're saying. I'm asking you: What proof do you have?
I understand you're saying this is your opinion, but in a court of law you have to have proof and you have to have documentation
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
MS. BUCHANAN: That's fine.
Q. What kind of documentation do you have to support that?
A. Well, the documentation is not primary. It is secondary, and it would be from Puerto Rico history books.
Q. What books?
A. “History of Puerto Rico” by Fernando Pico. “Five Centuries of History: History of Puerto Rico” by Francisco Carano.
“Economic History of Puerto Rico,” James Dietz. There are a lot of books on the history of Puerto Rico and a lot of books
about sociology and politics.
Q. And you believe those books would support your opinion that people here in Puerto Rico would only get information from
the government?
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
A. Not necessarily in that sense. Because now, I mean, nowadays or rather in the last 30 or 40 years, people have become
very much addicted to the media, you know, radio, television, and more so with radio. And those projections through radio
and television create a public opinion.
Therefore, in this case, in the last few years, the government -- it's no longer the same thing. Because like in the '40s and '50s,
not many people read the newspapers or books, and that is why the government took upon itself to inform the people.
For example, there were some newspapers from the political party that was in power to educate the people about democracy
and ho to vote. And in addition, government agencies were created to provide guidance to people as to how to live better.

For example, the Department of Education had a division called the Division of Community Education, which did not consist
of classrooms and schools, but through movies that they would take into the hills and the country where no such thing existed.
MO MS. BUCHANAN: I'm going to move to strike your response as nonresponsive.
Q. I'm going to ask you to listen very carefully to my question.
My question is: Those books that you listed for me, are those the books that you say support your opinion during this period
we're talking about-
A. Yes.
Q. - where Puerto Ricans learned only from their government?
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
Q. You can answer the question.
A. Can you please repeat the question again?
Q. Absolutely.
My question is: Those books that you listed a few minutes ago, are those the support, the documentation for your opinion that
during this time period we're talking about, Puerto Ricans learned things only from their government?
A. Well, in part. What I was trying to say is that after the appearance of radio and TV in strength, it was then that people began
to listen more and to be more fanatical about radio and television. They would hear the radio and the media more, they would
listen to it more than any other notice from the government.
Q. So, you're changing your opinion about what you said?
A. No.
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
A. All I told you was that the government began to be the adviser of the people. But with the arrival - or more specifically during
the mid-'50s, television and radio began to be more proactive, or active in the guidance of people and also advertising their
products. And people became very much addicted to soap operas and certain programs. And with these favorite soap operas
and programs, they would hear the advertising for the products that they were attempting to sell.
Q. I think you expressed to me a few minutes ago that during the period of the '40s and '50s and '60s, the only source of
information that the Puerto Rican people would have had about smoking would have been from the government; that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. I asked you then to list for me what your documentation was to support that opinion; is that right?
A. Yes.

18Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. And you listed several books for me; is that correct?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. Were those books your source for that opinion? Is that your basis for that opinion?
A. Yes.
Q. Is there anything else that was the basis for that opinion?
A. Seriously, it would be the books. Although there are certain magazines, but magazines of a social nature which would only
reach a certain elite in Puerto Rican society.
Q. So, you think people wouldn't learn anything about smoking and health from their family members?
A. Could you repeat your question, please?
Q. Sure. Do you think that people here in Puerto Rico would not be able to learn anything about smoking and health from
family members?
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
A. Well, apparently not. Because the person who smoked was the father, the parent or older people, and the children did not
have any authority to question -- at least back in that time.
Q. Do you think they wouldn't have learned anything from their doctors?
A. No. There was not much contact of the people with doctors, medical doctors. And the doctors were simply placed in some
places where people would go to get prescribed certain medication for certain illnesses
It was mothers who would take the children there, and the doctors did not deal much with elderly people or the older people on
a daily basis. Only in cases that were grave illnesses of high intensity, then the hospitals would get involved.
Because at that time, during the 30s and '40s and '50s, older people would go to the hospitals basically just to die.
Q. So, you think people here in Puerto Rico wouldn't learn anything about smoking and health from school?
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
A. Can you repeat your question, please?
Q. We're talking about sources of information where people could learn about smoking and health.
Do you think that people here in Puerto Rico during that time period, the '40s, '50s and 60s, learned about smoking and health
from school?
A. No.
Q. What about churches?

19Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
A. No. There may have only been some cases, like in some churches that were either Adventist or Pentecostal churches which
as part of their religion include no smoking, no drinking, etcetera.
Q. Do you think some of them may have told people not to smoke?
A. Yes, I do - I mean, they possibly did, yes.
Q. And told people not to smoke because of health reasons?
A. Yes. Yes.
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
A. But not only for their health, but because of a religious matter, that it was a sin. Yes, it was a sin.
Q. We talked about the first meeting that you had with Plaintiffs' counsel Did you have any other meetings with Plaintiffs'
counsel after that first meeting?
A. With them? No. I had a meeting where there were three attorneys present which was the first meeting. That was my first
orientation. Then I had contact once or twice over the telephone. And then there was another meeting that I had with Ms. Arocho
in which she received the report from me and she told me about the dates for the holding of the depositions.
Q. You said you met with three attorneys. Who is the third attorney?
A. It's another person, a male. I don't remember his name.
Q. Mr. Muriel?
A. Oh, yes. Muriel. I remember that I told him that he had a certain relation with tobacco here because of his name. Muriel
Cronell or something like that.
Q. So, after that first meeting, you went back and you read through the box and you did your research, you and the gentleman
who was helping you.
Then did you draft a report, was that the next step?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you draft that yourself?
A. Yes. Well, first of all, we discussed it. I spoke with him, with this other person.
Q. With this other person, you mean Mr. Muriel?
A. No. My helper.

20Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. Your assistant?
A. I mean, not a helper in such. It was collaborating with him.
Q. With your colleague who helped you?
A. Pardon me?
Q. With your colleague who helped you, you discussed it with him?
A. Yes.
Q. What did the two of you discuss?
A. We spoke about -- well, he's a smoker himself, but he's a very heavy smoker. And we spoke about that and about his father
and his grandfather. And one of the things that I always insisted on with him during these conversations w whether they had ever
received any advice or any notices from the Department of Health, or the government, about the harm that cigarette smoking
caused.
Q. Was he one of the smokers that you interviewed that you referenced in your report
A. No. He's more or less my age.
Q. Now, in drafting this report, did you do numerous drafts of it?
A. Yes. I did make one or two. And I think that I still keep one where the corrections were made.
RQ Q. I'm going to ask you to produce it to counsel, so counsel can produce to us, all of your previous drafts of your report.
A Okay.
MS. MARTÍNEZ: I will have to see if that is appropriate by law, but I will check.
MS. BUCHANAN: You're entitled to make an objection but we are formally requested. But if need be, we will follow-up the
request.
Q. After you did your first draft, did you send it to Ms. Arocho or Ms. Martínez?
A. I prepared one for myself, and then I started cleaning it up. And it was that draft that was sent to the Arocho law firm.
Q. Then did you get that draft back with some comments on it?
A. Yes. Well, no, not the draft with the comments. Just the comments regarding it, and then I corrected it myself.
Q. How did you get these comments? Did you get them --
A. By phone.
Q. Did you make notes as to those comments?

21Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. Yes.
Q. Do you have a copy of those notes still?
A. I think so.
Q. I'm going to ask you to -
A. Yes, I have. If I have them, I will bring them.
RQ Q. I would like you to make sure and produce them to Plaintiffs' counsel so they can produce them to us, along with any
drafts you may have of this, any notes of this particular report.
A. Okay.
Q. After you got the revisions from Plaintiffs' counsel, was that the final draft or did you do another draft?
A. After I made the revisions and then I made a clean copy, and it was sent.
Q. Was that the last draft that you did? Was that final?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you remember what changes you were asked to make between your first and final draft?
A. I told you previously that there were some details from the first meeting.
Q. What details did you take out?
A. Well, that I had traveled from Ponce to Utuado, I had been at the law office, I had met with three attorneys there, that they had
advised me about this, that they asked me if I was willing to work with them and how much was I going to charge for all of this.
Q. That's what you took out?
A. Yes. There is one thing that I failed: to do at the beginning, which I later added.
Q. What is that?
A. Which is the last page, the conclusion. The last page.
Q. Meaning the last paragraph or the entire--
A. No. The entire page.
Q. The entire page then?
A. (Witness nodding head.)

22Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. So, from “Final Historical Conclusion” down?
A. Yes.
Q. You were asked to add that after you submitted the first draft?
A. No. I think that I did this on my own. Because in reality, this was a historical report.
Q. In doing your research in this case, did you make any notes or any memorandum or anything regarding your research?
A. Yes. Notes in pencil. Yes.
Q. Do you have copies of those still?
A. If I can find them, I can provide them. I think there might be some. I mean, maybe they're just scribbles.
RQ Q. I'm going to ask you to look for those and provide all of your notes that you took in doing your research --
THE WITNESS: ‘??Lo esta apuntando?’
MS. MARTINEZ: ‘Sí.’
Q. -- in this case. Please provide them to Plaintiffs' counsel so they can provide it to us.
A. Certainly.
Q. Did you exchange correspondence with Plaintiffs' counsel in this case?
A. No. The only thing I did was the telephone calls.
Q. Before this deposition today, did you meet with Plaintiffs' counsel regarding your deposition?
A. No. Not before this, no.
Q. Did you receive any instructions form Plaintiffs' counsel regarding your deposition?
A. No. As a matter of fact, I was the one who had to call there to see whether this was still standing, because I had not received
any summons or anything.
Q. Other than Ms. Arocho, who you mentioned you spoke with about your deposition here today, have you talked with anyone
else about your deposition here?
A. No. About the deposition, the official deposition today, only with the people from the Arocho law firm and my colleague,
my colleague last night, late last night, we spoke a. little about this.
Q. Was this a colleague who helped you with the research?
A. Yes.

23Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. What did you talk about last night?
A. Well, I simply called him and told him, “I'm going to have the deposition tomorrow.” And I told him that the findings that
we had found confirmed that there had not been anything by the government or any government agency advising people not
to smoke.
Q. Have you reviewed any of the depositions taken in this case?
A. (English) Can you repeat the question, please?
Q. Sure.
Have you reviewed any of the depositions that have been taken in this case of, for example, the Plaintiffs, family members
of the decedent?
A. No.
Q. Do you plan on doing that?
A. I should do so if I'm going to go to trial.
Q. So, you think that's something that you will do then?
A. Excuse me?
Q. Do you think that's something that you will do?
A. Well, yes, I should, just for general knowledge.
Q. Have you reviewed the Complaint in this case?
A. No.
Q. Have you reviewed any documents specifically related to the claims made in this case?
A. No.
Q. Do you know what year the decedent in this case was born?
A. The only thing that I'm aware of, or not that I'm aware of but that I was told, was the name of the person, the name of the
person who was suing, which I had to include. I had to put it somewhere here.
(Witness reviewing document.)
A. But it is not here. It must be over there. I don't know. There is something with the name of the person. In all honesty, it
was the name and case No. X.
Q. This? (Handing.)

24Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
(Witness reviewing document)
A. Yes, this one. It says, Blanca Nieves versus R.J. Reynolds. This is all I know about this case.
Q. Blanca Nieves Rodriguez, do you know who she is?
A. No.
Q. But that's all you know about this case, that you've seen her name in the case title?
A. Yes.
Q. But you don't know who she is?
A. No.
Q. Is there any additional research that you plan on doing to support your opinions in this case?
A. Yes. If I want to remain in this case -- which I do want to remain -- I would like to see if I can find something, if I can
get something from the Health Department. And I would also like to follow up on that news from Exhibit 1 to see whether
anything was actually done. Because what I found was that nothing was actually done. Because for that entire period, up until
1970, nothing was done.
Q. Is that all the research that you think you have to do?
A. At this moment, yes. At this moment, I think so. However, what I did find in this, and piqued my interest, is that historically
speaking about tobacco, there are not many books or articles or anything speaking about specifically tobacco in Puerto Rico.
Because tobacco originated here in the Caribbean and Puerto Rico was a tobacco producer, the third largest tobacco producer
in the world up through the '40s.
Q. With this additional research that you plan to do, do you think your opinions are going to change at all?
A. Well, you never know.
Q. So, you just don't know?
A. You have to find things first. In history, you have to look at things as they are. As a matter of fact, there are times when
history has changed a lot.
Q. Because people found information that was previously undiscovered?
A. That's right.
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.

A. Yes.
Q. Was it a regular type of school where you go to class every day?
A. Not regularly. Because doctoral work was more of research in nature.
Q. Can you describe what kind of training you received during that phase of your education?
A. I would attend seminars. I had a thesis director, although I already had more or less of an idea on what I intended to do. They
asked me to do some work on the topics of philosophy and history. And the majority of my work was dedicated to research
for the monographs that I would have to present.
Q. On what kind of topics?
A. Theory of history. Research regarding the economic history of Latin America. Because that had a certain relationship with
the topic of the thesis that I intended the write. And then the interviews, the common interviews I would have wit professors.

Council. That was prepared - and that's an old photograph.
Q. Did you provide the information for this?
A. No.
Q. Do you know who did?
A. I don't know. Maybe they read some old curriculum vitae. But Professor Vargas is doing this through the Catholic University
library, but it is for all of Puerto Rico.
Q. I was showing you this because it specifically talks about your academic preparation and it says that you received a doctorate
in philosophy and letters from the Universidad de Navarra en Pamplona. Is that not right then?

Q. So, the doctorate you received was called a doctorate in philosophy and letters?
A. Yes.
Q. While you were doing your doctorate degree, did you receive grades? Were you graded

established the Academy of History and Archeology of Puerto Rico.” Was that while you were pursuing your Ph.D. in-
A. No. That was a gathering of intellectuals and we created and established an academy. This was an academy that would
collect and would gather intellectuals in the field of history, art and archeology.
Q. Who is the “we” you were discussing? You said “we.” Who is “we”?
A. A group of professors from different universities.
Q. Are you still involved with that group?
A. Yes.
Q. And what do you do?
A. What is done on a yearly basis is an activity in which a new member is received, the person who wants to join the academy.
And that person develops a conference, a magistral conference, and someone from the academy receives it. It is more of a
ceremony.
Q. Are there any academic things that you have to do with regard to this society, any work in the academic field?
A. Well, yes, it can. I mean, we have published some books, and sometimes the conferences get published. It has been some
time that the conferences have not been published because they're costly.
Q. Have you been involved in the publication of any of those?

30Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. Yes.
Q. On what topics?
A. There was a conference that I gave when I joined the academy, and that one was published. I don't remember where it was
published. But my conference and the reception conference were published.
MS. BUCHANAN: Let's take a break and go off the record.
(Whereupon, a recess was taken from 11:45 a.m. to 11:52 a.m.)
BY MS. BUCHANAN:
Q. Before we go forward just a little bit, I want to go back and ask you a couple of questions about your previous testimony.
I believed you told me - but correct me if I'm wrong -- that you were provided some facts by Plaintiffs' attorney in this case;
is that right?
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
A. Can you repeat the question again.
Q. I believe you told me earlier that you were provided some facts by Plaintiffs' attorney in this case.
A. What do you mean by “facts”?
Q. Information or facts. I'm trying to find out what that is. Was that written documents or --
A. Facts about what?
Q. Facts about this case.
A. The orientation that she gave me, what I informed you. What I remember just now is that they told me that there was another
person working on this in a particular case, in a separate case.
Q. Did they tell you anything about that person?
A. Not in particular, no.
Q. Do you know who that person is?
A. But I read something about her, something that she prepared. A report that she prepared.
Q. So, you read one of her reports?
A. Yes.
Q. And what did that report say? Do you remember?

31Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. There was a lot of particulars about -- the deposition. I think it was the deposition.
Q. Was it a report like this, or was it an actual deposition where the court reporter takes down the deposition?
A. It was something like this (indicating).
Q. So, it was something like your report?
A. Yes. But without these things (indicating).
Q. When you say “these things,” what do you mean?
A. The attachments, the addendum.
Q. So it had no attachments, it was just a written report?
A. Yes.
Q. What do you remember about that report?
A. What I remember is some data in particular about her. One thing that drew my attention was how she became involved in
this matter of being deposed for participating in these cases.
Q. Did it strike you as odd?
A. Well, it's not that it struck me, you know, but -- let me think how I should say this. It was something like fortuitous, you
know. The case just fell on her lap like fortuitously.
Q. Do you know if this other person was a historian?
A. From what I saw in the information, it didn't appear to be much of a historian. As a matter of fact, she worked with the Puerto
Rico General Archives from what I could read, and I didn't know her. But I directed the Puerto Rico Institute of Culture and I
never knew her. And I know the director, and she didn't know that she was there either.
Q. Do you know anything about the research that this individual did?
A. Which individual?
Q. The individual whose report you were reading that we're talking about.
A. This person?
Q. Yes, that person.
A. The question was what?
Q. The question is: Do you know anything about the research she did or the Investigation that she did?
A. No. Only from reading her report.

Q. Do you know that the box of documents that you received from Ms. Arocho were documents that this individual had found?
A. It seems to be.
Q. Was that all that you were told about this individual or that you know about this individual?
A. No. No. I didn't know anything about her. I just learned about her when I saw the report. Because the people from the law
firm told me about this person and that name, but that was it.
Q. Were you provided with any other expert reports by Plaintiffs' counsel in this case?
A. Yes. There was a report from a historian in New York, a Puerto Rican from Rutgers.
Q. Do you remember who he was?
A. I think his last name was Vargas or something.
Q. Is it Luis Martinez?
A. Luis Martinez Vargas?
Q. Was it Luis Martínez Fernández?
A. Yes, I think it is. I don't know why I thought of Vargas.
Q. Did you read any trial testimony from a case called Vargas?
A. I read his testimony and his curriculum.
Q. Did you read the trial testimony from a case called Cruz Vargas?
A. That was it.
Q. That's why you're thinking “Vargas”?
A. Yes.
Q. So, you read his trial testimony in a case called Cruz Vargas?
A. Yes. I read it.
Q. Then you read his report from some case?
A. Yes. It was a much more complete report.
Q. Much more complete than what?
A. Than the other report that I read.

33Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. Was there anything else that you were given by Plaintiffs' counsel specifically regarding historical matters in this case?
A. No. I remember that because it was part of the box of documents that I received, and it helped me a lot reading both of
those reports.
Q. Did you read any affidavit from Dr. Luis Martínez Fernández?
A. If it was an affidavit. I don't know if that was part of the curriculum vitae that he had. I don't know if it was an affidavit,
but there were two documents that I read from him.
And what impressed me was how detailed he was with all of the articles and everything. You know, if I was going to prepare
one, I would also have to include all of my articles. And the conferences on TV, radio, everything. It was very well prepared.
But all of that material that you reviewed, it's in that box that Plaintiffs' counsel has.
A. Yes.
Q. Do you still have the fax that you first received from Ms. Arocho that got you involved in this case, the fax?
A. Well, I don't know. But I might have it maybe.
RQ Q. I'm going to ask you to look for it. If you find it, please provide it to Plaintiffs' counsel so they can produce it to us.
I believe we were talking about a colleague of yours who assisted you with some of the research.
A. Well, in all honesty he was helping me. He was checking the newspapers.
Q. Has he been paid by Plaintiffs' counsel or s he being paid by Plaintiffs' counsel?
A. No.
Q. So, is he doing that for nothing?
A. He's a colleague of mine. Someone who has collaborated with me for a long time. We work together here in San Juan with the
Institute of Culture, and now we're working at the university. He also works at the university. He works part-time there, though.
MO MS. BUCHANAN: I'm going to move to strike as nonresponsive.
Q. Is he being paid or has he been paid by Plaintiffs' counsel?
A. No.
Q. When you were pursuing your Ph.D., did you publish any books or articles?
A. Yes. Before. Before, yes.
Q. Before you began your Ph.D.?
A. Yes.

34Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. What did you publish before you began your Ph.D.?
A. In journals and newspapers, history matters, about historical topics and geographical, and also travel topics.
Q. So, you wrote newspaper articles?
A. Yes.
Q. Were any of your articles peer reviewed?
A. I'm sorry?
Q. Do you know what peer review is?
A. Peer review? No.
Q. Are you familiar with the process whereby academics in various fields, before they publish articles in academic journals and
things like that, there is a process through which other objective people who are experts in that area will look at the material
that they write --
A. Yes.
Q. -- will review it and determine whether it is accurate and correct?
A. Yes. Yes.
Q. That's the process I'm talking about
A. Yes.
Q. So, you're familiar with what peer review Is?
A. Yes. Yes. As a matter of fact, I myself have reviewed work by other people.
Q. Those articles of yours that you were talking about that you wrote --
A. These articles were for magazines, for journals. But for newspapers, no.
Q. Were any of your articles peer reviewed?
A. Yes.
Q. Which ones?
A. One of them was one I did about the history of Ponce talking about that period of time, you know.
Q. Who published it?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
35Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. The Horisontes magazine. It is a magazine by the Catholic University.
Q. Do you remember what the title of that was?
A. The title of the article?
Q. Yes.
A. I don't remember. But it had to do with Ponce history, Origins of Ponce. ‘Origenes de Ponce’.
Q. Do you have a copy of that still?
A. I might have an issue of that magazine, yes, possibly. But a copy could be obtained.
Q. Do you know what issue it was published in?
A. I don't remember.
RQ Q. I'm going to ask, if you don't mind, to try to find a copy of that and provide it to counsel. Any other article that you've
written that has been peer reviewed?
A. Well, the articles that appear in newspapers.
Q. But those weren't peer reviewed, were they?
A. No.
Q. So, the only peer-reviewed articles that you were writing --
A. For that period of time, yes.
Q. I know you did a thesis for your Ph.D., and you made a reference to it, to coffee plantations?
A. Yes.
Q. How did you pick that subject?
A. I met with some friends from the university. And there is a person who came from Costa Rica -- he's a Spaniard, a professor
from Spain -- and he asked me whether I had chosen any topic for my thesis. And he asked whether anything had been done
about coffee in Puerto Rico. And nothing large had been done about it, so he suggested that I should select something related
with coffee here in Puerto Rico.
Then the problem was whether the documentation existed for that work to be done. So, we did find some documentation for
a coffee plantation which were complete from 1868 through 1930, the journals, the diaries. So, we did our work about that
plantation.
It was a very particular hacienda, a very particular plantation. Because in Puerto Rico, the economic development was connected
with the arrival of immigrants who came from the Mediterranean during the 19th century, early 19th century, and in this case,
they were Majorcans.

36Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. How much time did you spend working o your thesis?
A. I don't know. Maybe about a year and a half.
Q. Full-time work?
A. Well, full-time work as such, about six months.
Q. How much time did you spend, for example, researching the subject?
A. Well, what happened was that I needed to go to the place where the documents were because they wouldn't allow them to
be removed. So, I would go on Saturdays the whole day.
Q. How many days do you think you spent researching?
A. Well, I don't know. As far as days, I was there for a whole year, so I would say about 50. Maybe 50 days, 50 Saturdays doing
the research on site or in the archives here in San Juan, the general archives of Puerto Rico.
Q. When you were doing that research, did you take notes and make copies and things like that?
A. Yes. Yes. A lot.
Q. So, you had extensive notes then?
A. I had.
Q. You have?
A. I had, I had a lot.
Q. How much time did you spend writing the thesis?
A. In the editing of the thesis? Maybe about three or four months.
Q. As part of your work in that, did you conduct oral history?
A. What was the question again?
Q. As part of your work in preparing your thesis and doing your research, did you conduct oral history?
A. Whether I conducted what? I'm sorry. I couldn't hear.
Q. Did you conduct oral history?
A. Oral history?
Q. Yes.

37Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. Yes. Yes.
Q. How did you go about doing that? Did you have a particular procedure that you followed?
A. No. What I did really was, I went to the place where the plantation was. And you must remember that the thesis covered
up to 1914, but the documentation was available up to 1930.
So, I interviewed some of the old people who had a relation with coffee in that place, and that complemented my investigation.
Q. In interviewing these elderly people, was there some particular procedure that you would use to make sure that you did
it properly?
A. Well, first, the people needed to be identified as being people from the place. That it was people who were old, and that they
had some knowledge about what had transpired there 50, 60 years ago.
Q. Did you have any particular procedure you followed in talking with these people, a particular list of questions? Or did you
tape-record it? What kind of procedures did you use?
A. I used notes. I had notes. I had some guideline questions. And I would approach all of them in the same way.
Q. So, you had a set procedure you use with everybody?
A. I had my guideline questions for all of them, but then I had separately, for each one of them, you know, I would write down
their age, their name, etcetera. And of course, there were people that you would interview and you would get nothing out of it.
Q. Let's talk about some of your publications. I think some are mentioned in at least some of these biographies and in your
CV as well, things that you have published.
Have you published something called ‘Diario de un Hermano Cheo’?
A. Yes. The book is about to come out.
Q. So, it hasn't been published yet?
A. It has not been published up to this date. It was supposed to come out in June, but some corrections needed to be made. The
thing is that I don't know, I mean, the editor has already been paid. And when you have already paid - you know, apparently
I will need to go there.
But already saw the proofs, I saw the books, I made some corrections, but it is about to come out.
Q. When you say the editor has already been paid, you've already paid the editor?
A. Yes.
Q. So, you're going to get your book?
A. I hope so. No. I think so. But the problem is that this book was supposed to be for December last year.
Q. Who's the editor?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
38Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. So, I made that mistake.
Q. Who's the editor?
A. It is Father Santaella and me. He is a clergyman, a priest. In all honesty, this clergyman, this priest is there -- the involvement
of this priest is there because the bishop of Ponce asked for this priest to be included because this book is of a religious nature
and it needs to have the permission of the bishop in order to be published.
Q. Is this going to be peer reviewed?
A. No.
Q. What is it about?
A. I found a diary of a person who was an Hermano Cheo, which is an organization from early in the last century in Puerto
Rico, in the 20th century. Cheo means -- it is short for José, Hermanos José. And this was a group that was attempting to defend
the Catholic faith against the protestants who invaded Puerto Rico at the beginning of the 20th century.
So, then, I found this documentation. And I had an interest in this because Father Santaella wrote the history of Hermano Cheo
25 years ago. So, I found this. I did some research with the children, the offsprings. And the diary covered from 19 something,
I don't remember right now, up to 1951.
And we corrected that diary. We prepared some historical background. And then Father Santaella prepared a personal
background for that person, for this Hermano Cheo. And it's about to be published. It should already be published.
Q. Is t going to be available for sale after it's published?
A. Yes. We might actually give it out.
Q. Give it out to whom?
A. The people from the towns of Villalba and Juana Diaz who are elderly and who had some sort of connection with them.
Because the objective of this book is to really project, you know, spread the life of this man. He was a simple man, he was
a poor man.
Q. The next publication I have listed for you is ‘Castañer, Una Hacienda Cafetalera en Puerto Rico’?
A. Yes. That's part of the thesis.
Q. Was this particular book peer reviewed?
A. No. Well, I mean, by the publisher.
Q. And who --
A. One publisher rejected it because it was not within their scope. You know, they covered political topics, and this one was
not a political book. But I took it to them because this was a. publisher that sold well.

39Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. Who was the editor of this book?
A. Me. I was the editor.
Q. Did you have to pay to get it published?
A. No.
Q. How did it get published? Who paid for it?
A. I took it to the publisher. They were interested and they made me an offer and it was sold. There were two editions.
Q. Who was that publisher?
A. Editorial Edil. And I'm still waiting for payment.
Q. You've never been paid on that one?
A. No. They gave me 25 copies.
Q. Do you know how many copies were sold
A. About 4,000.
Q. The next publication I have for you is ‘Catalogo de temblores y teremotos en Puerto Rico del 1524 hasta 1994.’
A. Yes. This is a book that more or less indicates chronologically all of the occurrences of earthquakes. And not only
chronologically, but it also includes a description of what happened and the events and what parts were affected with a historical
background.
Q. Is this it?
A. Yes. That's one edition.
Q. It looks like there is a listing of dates and time?
A. Yes.
Q. Was this peer reviewed?
A. No. Well, not officially, but there was a group of professors, you know, friends who did see it.
Q. So, you had some professor friends look at it for you?
A. Yes.
Q. Who published this one?
A. Which one is that one, Temblores y Teremotos? This one was published by me. I mean, I paid a publisher.

40Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. It says “Copyright,” your name, “1999, Tercera Edición, third edition. So, you were the publisher of this one. Okay.
The next publication I have for you, I'm not even going to try the name, it is from ‘Curanilahue a Yumbel (Pro-Memorias de
Chile)’
A. Yes.
Q. Can you pronounce it for me?
A. Curanilahue a Yumbel. That's an Auracanian word. It means ‘lugar de la tierra negra’.
THE INTERPRETER: It means “the place of a black earth.”
THE WITNESS: (English.) Black stone.
A. These are two towns that I lived in back in Chile.
Q. Was this book just --
A. It is over there. I published that book - I was a member of the Peace Corps and it was dedicated to my colleagues from
there. And the majority of people who have this book are colleagues throughout the United States who were in the Peace Corps,
and it was made for them.
But 500 copies were made. And I may have given out 100 of them, but about 400 of them were sold here. But I have not
printed it again.
Q. I read through it. It looked like a collection of short little articles about your experiences?
A. Yes. From newspapers.
Q. So, these were articles that were published in the newspaper and you just collected them together and put them in a book?
A. Yes. Yes. All about Chile.
Q. All about your experience in the Peace Corps In Chile?
A. Yes.
Q. Was this peer reviewed?
A. No.
Q. Did you publish this yourself?
A. Yes.
Q. The next document we have listed for you is, ‘Documentos Para El Estudio De La Historia de Puerto Rico 1868 hasta 1900.”
What is that?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
41Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. It is a collection of documents, originals, for a synthesis -- for a study by students in the History Department. These are
original documents, which are documents that historians use to prepare history.
Q. What kind of documents?
A. These are documents from the Government of Puerto Rico, letters from important people in the history of Puerto Rico,
government statistics and reports in general.
Q. Is this something that's publicly available?
A. Yes.
Q. Because we tried to find it and we couldn't find it?
A. It's in the Catholic University. Oh, what happened is that they ran out. But I think I might have some copies available.
RQ Q. Would you mind producing a copy to Plaintiffs' counsel?
A. If I can find it, yes, I will. But I think there should be. It's 1868 to 1900. I prepared that one with a colleague who is now
the Dean of Arts and Humanities.
Q. Was it published?
A. Yes.
Q. Who published it?
A. The Catholic University.
Q. Was it peer reviewed?
A. No, I don't think so. Because these were documents. So, we made an introduction to this.
Q. So, you did an introduction, and after that it was just copies of the documents?
A. Yes. Exactly.
Q. The next publication I have for you is -- looks like some of the words are in Spanish, Ponce, then ‘Die'--
A. ‘Die perle del sudens.’ Yes, it's a travel guide for Germans. It's like a booklet.
Q. So, it's a little pamphlet kind of thing?
A. Yes.
Q. Was that published?
A. Yes.

42Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. Who published that?
A. The Municipality of Ponce.
Q. And it is specifically directed at Germans?
A. Yes.
Q. Why Germans?
A. Well, because at that time they had a campaign to attract people from Europe. And what we did was like a tourist guide
book, you know, where you can go to eat, where to go, where not to go. That type of thing.
Q. So, that was a guide book, nothing historical?
A. Well, it did have a historical background, you know, in the background. But the thing is that this was mostly addressed
for tourists.
Q. So, it wasn't a historical academic type of book?
A. No, it wasn't.
Q. The next publication I have for you is ‘Peñuelas: Notas para su historia’?
A. Yes. But that was not actually published.
Q. So, that's something that was not published?
A. Yes. I mean, it was not actually published completely. Pieces have been published but not in a book as such. It's in the
process of being published. It has just been difficult to find some documents in particular, and a book should not be made with
documents missing.
Q. What is this about?
A. This is the history of the Town of Peñuelas. It is local.
Q. You say parts of it have been published. Who published it?
A. Yes, in newspapers, some parts have been published. It has been published in a magazine that the History Academy used to
publish For example, one of the articles was, “Immigrants who arrived at the Peñuelas port.” But it is mostly of a local interest.
Q. Has any of it been peer reviewed?
A. By the academy, yes. By people in the academy. At least the article that was published there.
Q. And what was the name of the journal?
A. The name of the magazine, the journal, was ‘Revista De Historia y Ednología’. It is no longer published.

43Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. Do you know when it was published?
A. It was somewhere in the '80s. '81 or '82.
Q. Do you have a copy of it somewhere?
A. I should have one. But the thing is that I moved and they don't want my books at home.
RQ Q. I'm going to ask you again to look. If you find this, please give a copy to Plaintiffs' counsel so they can produce a
copy to us.
A. Okay.
Q. The last document I have for you is, ‘Documentos Básicos De Historia De Puerto Rico’
A. Siglo 15 al 18.
Q. No. I have 19.
A. 19?
Q. ‘Documentos básicos de historia de Puerto Rico'--
A. No. It is Siglo 15, 15th century, to the 18th.
Q. Is that just a general history of Puerto Rico during the time period?
A. No. It is just documents. For example, it includes the contract that Christopher Columbus signed with the king, the royal
king of Spain. There is a letter there that says that prior to coming to America, Columbus had already been in America, and
curious and particular things like that, reports regarding Puerto Rico, like the other one that we already saw.
Q. So, it's just a collection of historical documents?
A. Yes.
Q. Has that been peer reviewed?
A. Yes, I think so. Back at that time, it was '79 or something. I don't remember well whether it was maybe '81. It was published
by the university. The university published this.
Q. Was this the Catholic University in Ponce?
A. Catholic University, yes.
Q. That was the group that reviewed it?
A. Yes. I think it was professors. But this was not a book of an opinion or anything like that. It was more like a collection of
documents a compendium.

A. I don't know. But probably in the 40's.
Q. I know you don't ask ladies their age, that's not polite.
A. No. But I can ask.
Q. No. It Is fine. You don't need to ask her. I just wanted to try and get a rough estimate of how old she was.
Before lunch we were talking about some of the material you reviewed in that box and you talked about the individuals who
had been working in some other cases with Plaintiffs' counsel. You said you reviewed her report.
Did you ever review any e-malls from her or to her about her report?
A. No.
Q. Are you aware whether she ever stated in any place as to whether there were problems wit her report?
A. No.
Q. Did you see problems with her report?
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
A. No. The only thing I noticed was that she was not -- I do not consider her, if I was in a case, an expert.
Q. We also talked about how much time we spent working in this case and some additional research you thought you might do.
How long do you think it would take you to do a complete investigation in this case, to completely investigate this issue?
A. I don't know. But, you know, I have to travel to San Juan, the archives, and the Department of Health here. Probably a
month or two.

Q. Do you plan on trying to do a complete job in this case?
A. Yes.
Q. Until such time that you do a complete job in this case, are your opinions in this case preliminary?
A. No. It's complete. It is complete right now. However, a researcher should never cease in the task of trying to search for
information elsewhere.
Q. Can you say right now whether your opinions are going to be the same as they are right now after you do a complete
investigation?
A. I cannot say that.
Q. Let me refer to your invoice in this case. I believe you told me earlier that in setting an hourly rate for your work in this case,
that you had gone and talked to some lawyer friends of yours; is that right?
A. Yes. I asked a friend of mine.
Q. He told you $275 an hour?
A. Around that.
Q. Have you ever been paid $275 an hour for everything you've ever done?
A. Around 200, yes.
Q. What have you been paid $200 an hour?
A. I work as a member of the Board of --
(Via Interpreter) The people who prepare the examinations for the fourth year of high school students, the College Board.
Q. How much work have you done with them?
A. I work around a year with them.
Q. When was that?
A. Pardon me?
Q. When was that?
A. Probably in the '80s.
Q. You were paid $200 an hour for that?
A. Yes.

49Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. Are you familiar with the term “historical method”?
A. Yes.
Q. What does that mean to you?
(Whereupon, the testimony continued via the interpreter.)
A. It is the way that you should approach a historical problem, you know, in a scientific -- scientifically.
Q. Is that something that you were taught how to do as part of your formal education?
A. Yes. In history theory.
Q. What, basically, were you taught? If you can give me a little synopsis of what you were taught about historical method?
A. Well, how to approach a thesis, a problem, a hypothesis, you have to look at all the angles and then reach your conclusions.
Q. I'm going to give you a list of things that I associate with the historical method and I'm going to ask you If you agree with
those steps.
The first step that I have is creating the historical question or questions. Do you agree with that?
A. Yes.
Q. The next step I have is identifying primary and secondary sources of information of topic.
A. Also.
Q. And the third step I have is determining if there is sufficient information to answer the questions that you have posited as
your historical questions.
A. Yes.
Q. The next step I have is reviewing the available information on the topic.
A. Yes.
Q. The next step I have is analyzing the available information on the topic.
A. Yes.
Q. Then the final step I have is drawing conclusions based on your review and analysis of the available documents.
A. That is also something you do, yes.
Q. So, would you agree those are the basic elements of the historical method?
A. Generally speaking, yes, they are.

50Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. Is there any other step that you would add in that I didn't include?
A. Not that I can recall right now. But these are the basics.
Q. Do you know if there are various schools of thought used by different historians?
A. Yes.
Q. Can you name some of them for me?
A. There is a school -- well, there are different schools. One of those schools -
(English) Jesus, I forgot the names now.
(Via Interpreter) Well, for example, do you want them for Puerto Rico or in general?
Q. Wherever. Just any you can name.
Have you heard of the school of thought called new social historians?
A. No. Well, yes and no, because I have not delved in that one. But I know that that school exists, but I have not dealt with it.
Q. Do you belong to any particular school of thought?
A. Well, I believe that my training is general. And it is more related to the Puerto Rican school of thought. I have my guide
in this matter of Puerto Rican school which is Arturo Morales Carrion. It might be a little paradoxical for me not to remember
because right now I am doing a course on historiography.
Q. So, as part of your course, you would teach your students about the various schools of thought?
A. Yes, of course.
Q. This historical method that we generally described just a few minutes ago, is that generally recognized in the field of history
s a proper way to do historical research?
A. When we're doing research, yes. And especially any research for a thesis.
Q. Or for academic writings?
A. (English) Yes. Well, not for academic writing, not monographies, per se.
(Via Interpreter) But for thesis, and monographs and that type of research, yes.
Q. What would you do differently for a monograph?
A. In this sense, they are a smaller work for a particular topic. But in these, we don't try to prove anything in particular.
Q. But when you are actually doing research to try to answer questions that you have, you would use these steps?

51Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. They should be used, yes.
Q. If somebody is doing a research where they are questioning and they are trying to arrive to conclusions, if they deviate from
this methodology, what is going to happen?
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
A. What the professor does is they try to get you back on track.
Q. So, for example, if you have a student who is working on a thesis and they get to a step where they're supposed to identify
all the available sources and, say, they miss some of the sources, the professor would try to get that person back on track?
A. Yes. If the professor knows, he will do so.
Q. Is that because if they miss some of the sources, there's going to be problems with the conclusions?
A. Yes. I mean, you can imagine.
Q. We talked a little bit about the questions that you looked at in this case. Did you come up with these on your own or did
Plaintiffs' counsel give them to you?
A. Can you repeat your question, please?
Q. Sure.
The questions that are included in your report, questions one, two, and three -
A. Yes.
Q. -- did you formulate these questions yourself or were these given to you by Plaintiffs' counsel? How did these questions
come about?
A. No. This was something suggested by the law office.
Q. Let me ask you: Were these the original questions or did your questions change?
A. More or less.
Q. After you received these questions, what did you do to determine what all the available evidence was?
A. I started to read all of the documentation available. And after I finished with that documentation, I went to other sources
that had not been touched upon.
Q. So, the first thing you did was read that box of documents --
A. Yes.
Q. -- that was provided to you by Plaintiffs' counsel?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
52Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Then the next thing you did was go to the library at the Catholic University?
A. Yes.
Q. And look at journals and newspapers?
A. Especially newspapers.
Q. Especially newspapers?
A. Yes.
Q. Why especially newspapers?
A. I wanted to see some dates that had not been included among the photocopies I have. Because apparently what had been
done before was about one single paper.
And in addition to that newspaper, among these documents there were some copies of some recordings that had been made
during baseball games of the Puerto Rico Winter League. And these had to do with the advertising for tobacco smoking.
Q. Anything else that you reviewed?
A. Well, I also saw copies of medical magazines, medical journals for certain dates that were within that box, which covered
that period, those dates. And that was where I noticed that studies had been conducted regarding the harm caused by smoking.
But these were scientific studies, and that this was exclusively available to the peer community.
Q. Can you tell me what the difference is between a primary and secondary source?
A. Yes. A primary document is when a person produces that document himself, and the secondary is when someone else
produces it pertaining to that original. A book could be a secondary source and a letter from a person could be primary.
Q. I think you told me a minute ago that you wanted to go look at the newspapers yourself because there are some more dates
that you didn't see in the box of documents, that you wanted to look at
What dates in specific did you want to look at?
A. Not dates. It was more like some newspapers. Because apparently, the majority of these photocopies were from one single
newspaper, one or two.
Q. And you thought you needed to look at other newspapers?
A. Yes. Although in these newspapers that I saw, I didn't find as much propaganda. For example, El Día didn't have any.
Q. Now, In the information that you reviewed, do you think you had ?? information to answer the questions that you have
here in your report?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
53Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. Yes. From what information I had and from what I was able to see, I can determine and opine that the Government of Puerto
Rico and its agencies were not concerned enough to advise, to warn the people about the harm that could be caused to people's
health by smoking and by cigarettes.
Q. Now, as you were going through and reviewing the documents that you looked at, did you take notes?
A. Yes.
Q. Before we go any further, I notice that you brought in a folder with you. What is in that folder you brought with you today?
A. These are some documents related to Congress. I mean, this is a letter that was sent to me by Ms. Arocho.
MS. MARTÍNEZ: He said Rotgers.
THE INTERPRETER: Sorry. Rotgers.
A. And I have some notes that I took.
Q. Are these some of the documents that you reviewed and some of the notes that you took?
A. Some notes. Yes. Yes. I have some here.
Q. Do you mind f we made a copy of what you have in that folder and then give it back to you?
A. No problem. You can.
MS. MARTÍNEZ: ‘El folder completo’.
A. The folder?
Q. The complete folder.
MS. BUCHANAN: Let's go off the record for a moment.
(Discussion off the record.)
BY MS. BUCHANAN:
Q. Professor, do you believe a person needs to have special training n order to conduct historical investigation and arrive at
accurate conclusions?
A. Yes.
Q. What specific training do you think is necessary?
A. Well, the training in how to be a historian and how to research specifically, following those details, you know, the scientific
method of the investigation and research.
Q. Are you familiar with the term “common knowledge” as it is used in social sciences?

54Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. Can you repeat that, please?
Q. Are you familiar with the term “common knowledge” as it is used in social sciences?
A. No.
Q. Do you have any understanding that you attach to the term “common knowledge”?
A. Yes, I do have a notion of what “common knowledge” is.
Q. What is your understanding of “common knowledge”?
A. What common people know about something.
Q. Do you equate it with what most of the common people know, or some of the common people know?
A. Just common people.
Q. What do you think are the sources of common knowledge in the society?
A. Tradition, and what your parents, your grandparents may tell you. The community in general.
Q. Like school?
A. Yes.
Q. Church?
A. Yes.
Q. Media?
A. Now you have to add the media.
Q. Are you a member of any professional historical organization?
A. I think so.
Q. Which one?
A. Phi Alpha Zeta, it's a history society. The Latin-American historical Association.
Q. Any others that you can remember?
A. Asociación de Historiadores de Puerto Rico.

55Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. Anything else?
A. I don't remember.
Q. That's fine.
Are you familiar with an association called the American Historical Association?
A. Yes.
Q. What is that?
A. The association that groups professors and people who are in the field of studying the history of the United States.
Q. Is it a large professional organization?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know if it has any guidelines that it has for its members to follow regarding historical research and how they conduct
that?
A. I don't know. But should be.
Q. Have you ever heard of a group called the National Council in Public History?
A. No.
Q. Have you ever seen any of the guidelines that any of these groups, like the American Historical Association, would have
for its members?
A. No. What happens with this is that I am in the Latin-American Association because I teach that history course. You know,
other professors who are involved in the teaching of American history, United States history, are members of the American
Association.
And one of the things that these organizations do is that they hold conferences every year, people exchange information, they
present their work, and then they enjoy a week of a Congress.
Q. Do you know if any of the historical organizations to which you belong to have guidelines for their members on how to
conduct research and how to do their work?
A. The Latin-American historical Association does have them.
Q. Do you know what those guidelines are?
A. No.
Q. Have you ever looked at them?
A. No.

MS. BUCHANAN: Let's mark this as the next exhibit.
(Defendants' Exhibit 3, Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct, marked for identification, as of this date.)
Q. I'm going to let you take a minute and look through this.
(Witness reviewing document.)
Q. Did you get a chance to look through those guidelines or standards?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you basically agree with these guidelines or standards?
A. Yes.
Q. That these are appropriate and historians should follow this?
A. Yes. And the Latin-American Historical Association should have the same ones.
Q. So, these would be standard guidelines?
A. Yes.
Q. Now, as a historian researching what was commonly known about the health risks of smoking during a particular period,
would you consider it important and appropriate to consider the information that would have been appearing in newspapers
regarding smoking and health?
A. Could you repeat the question if you would be so kind?
Q. Absolutely.
As a historian researching what was commonly known about the health risks of smoking during a particular period, would you
consider it important and appropriate to look at, and consider, information that appeared in newspaper articles during that time
period on the topic of smoking and health?
A. Yes. It should be so.
Q. Would it also be Important to consider information that might have appeared in magazines?
A. Yes.
Q. Would it have been Important to consider information that voluntary health organizations or public health organizations
would have been putting out there for the public on the issue of smoking and health?
A. Yes.

57Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. Would it have been important to consider information that federal and state governments might have been communicating
to the public?
A. Yes.
Q. And it would be important to consider information that was being communicated on radio or television?
A. That, too. Yes.
Q. Would it be important to consider information that was being taught to students in school?
A. Yes.
Q. Would it be important to consider polling or survey data on the topic of what people now about smoking and health?
A. Yes.
Q Would It be important to consider popular cultural type things, like slang expressions or movies?
A. Yes. That, too.
Q. Wold it be important to look at information that religious organizations might have been communicating to their members?
A. It is important, yes.
Q. Would it be important to consider what people's doctors might have been telling them?
A. That, too.
Q. Would it be important to consider what people in society were saying, for example, to their neighbors, their family members?
A. That's all part of history, yes.
Q. In doing your research In this case, did you try and identify each of those sources?
A. Not necessarily. But I tried to do the best possible within the time that I had available.
Q. Let's go back through then and see what you didn't have time for.
Do you think you looked at all the newspaper articles?
A. (English) Not all, but most.
Q. So you think you looked at most. Did you look at any magazines?
A. Copies of magazines for that period.
Q. Was it just the medical magazines you told me about?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
58Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. Yes.
Q. So, it was just medical magazines?
A. Yes.
Q. You didn't look at any popular magazines that the average person might have had?
A. No.
Q. What about voluntary health organizations? Did you do anything to determine what they were saying?
A. Yes. I spoke with people who belong to groups like the Lung Association and the other one about cancer. It's about cancer.
And these people were -- I mean, these people had campaigns but just in later years, you know, recent years, not back at that time.
I would say that it was after the Act of Congress in '65 stating that smoking could be hazardous to your health.
Q. Would it be of interest to you that the Puerto Rican Anti-Cancer League was doing anti-cancer campaigns back in the 1940s
in Puerto Rico?
A. Yes, they were doing so. But it seemed that they were not reaching the public. At least I have read that they might have
been doing so.
Q. Where did you read that?
A. In the copies of those documents that Ms. Arocho provided me in her office. 121
Q. Do you remember a specific document that made you think that they weren't reaching the public?
A. No. I could not be specific.
Q. If there were documents indicating that the campaigns were well publicized, would that be of interest to you?
A. Well, the campaign apparently was not publicized for masses.
Q. If there was information that it was, would that be of interest to you?
A. Could you repeat your question?
Q. Certainly. If there was information indicating that these anticancer campaigns conducted by the Puerto Rico Anti-Cancer
League back in the 1940s were publicized and reaching the masses, would that be of interest to you?
A. We cannot prove that it was reaching the masses. I would say that it was mostly connected with the scientific group. Because
there were medical researchers who had a lot of interest in that topic. Some. But apparently they did not have the support of
another group of their peers because of certain reasons that I cannot explain.
Q. This is my question: If there was evidence that these campaigns were reaching the masses, would that be of interest to you?
A. Sure.

59Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
Q. Did you do anything to determine what kind of information was being communicated on radio or television about smoking
and health?
A. No. The only communication on radio and television was promoting smoking for different brands.
Q. Did you do anything to ascertain whether students in school were being taught about smoking and health?
A. From my point of view of my historical research in the newspapers, there is nothing in particular about that except for that
particular article that was there. But I can speak from personal history because I was part of those students, the group of students
in the '50s. And never was anything ever brought about quitting smoking.
Q. To the best you can recall, anyway?
A. Yes. To the best of my recollection.
Q. Did you go to the Department of Education or to curriculum guides or to textbooks to see what the schools had set up for that?
A. Yes. I mean, in textbooks, there is a minimal reference to tobacco, but from the economic and the agricultural point of view.
Because, as I said, tobacco was important to Puerto Rico economy because it provided currency to the public trust.
Q. Did you consider any polling or survey data? Did you find any of that?
A. No.
Q. Did you consider any popular items like movies or slang expressions?
A. For what?
Q. For your research In this case.
A. No. I only utilized my memory from the point of view of remembering seeing that the actors, artists, would smoke on screen
and, as a matter of fact, they would even blow the other smoke on the other person.
Q. Do you remember if there were movies that were shown that said bad things about smoking?
A. I do remember there being some, but I just don't remember the titles of any.
Q. Did you consider those movies, too?
A. No. I just remembered now when you asked me. But I didn't consider it at that point.
Q. Did you consider any information from religious organizations?
A. From what?
Q. Did you consider any information on the topic of smoking and health from religious organizations?

60Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. Yes. I read from the Adventist surge or -- well, it was protestant. But it was not addressed to the general public. It was
addressed to the members of that church.
Q. Did you do anything to try and determine what people were saying to each other back in the '30s, '40s and '50s about smoking,
what they would say to their family members or friends?
A. I think it is the same thing that they tell their children now.
Q. What is that?
A. Well, that you should not smoke because it's a sin.
Q. Do they tell them they shouldn't smoke because it is a ‘vicio’?
A. Yes. Yes. And a vice is a sin.
Q. Does vice have a health connotation that it's bad for you?
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
A. I never pondered that question. But now that I'm thinking of it, if it's a vice, it could be that it is harmful in a certain aspect,
but just not specific, not for health.
Q. Did you do anything to determine what the government here in Puerto Rico was doing with regard to smoking during that
time period?
A. Yes. I considered it. I considered it to be important, yes. But what happens is that the government was receiving taxes. They
were collecting taxes on cigarette sales.
Q. Do you know if the government here in Puerto Rico ever prohibited smoking among minors
A. Well, there were never any -- there was never any mining here.
Q. No. I mean, among minors, people below legal age.
A. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought--
Q. Not miners.
A. No. Because there was a mining business here, but not now. Could you please then repeat your question? I'm sorry.
Q. Absolutely. It's my fault for using the word that I used.
Do you know if the government here in Puerto Rico ever passed a law prohibiting smoking by people under the age of 21 or 18?
A. Yes.
Q. Yes, you know?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
61Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. Yes, it is so. It is in effect.
Q. Do you know when that law was first passed?
A. No.
Q. Is It of interest to you when that law was first passed?
A. Yes. I would like to know.
Q. Do you know if the Government of Puerto Rico ever prohibited smoking in public places?
A. Yes. But that has been later, after the '60s and the '70s. And I did not touch upon that, but I know that there are laws that do so.
Q. I want to talk to you a minute a little bit more about the witness interviews.
Did you have a specific list of questions that you used with the witness interviews that you did?
A. I did not have a list of questions, but I knew what questions I would ask.
Q. What questions did you ask?
A. The questions I asked was whether at any time he, as a smoker, had received any orientation, any guidance from the
Government of Puerto Rico, or from a Puerto Rico government agency, for him to stop smoking because smoking was hazardous
to your health.
Q. Did you ask if anyone other than the Puerto Rican government, or a government agency, ever told him he shouldn't smoke
because it was hazardous?
A. No, I did not ask that question.
Q. Why not?
A. Because I was referring to people in Puerto Rico.
Q. Well, did these two smokers live in Puerto Rico?
A. Yes.
Q. If there were people here in Puerto Rico telling them that they shouldn't smoke because it was harmful to their health, even
if these people weren't part of the Puerto Rican government, wouldn't that be important?
A. Could you repeat your question, please?
MS. BUCHANAN: Can you read the question for me, MayLeen?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you think you should have asked that question?
A. Yes. I should have. I could have used that, yes. But the question that I asked at the beginning encompassed that question also.
They never received from anyone, any Government of Puerto Rico or any agency, any notice, any indication that this could
happen. And you're bringing the case of someone from outside of Puerto Rico having said so.
Q. No. Someone inside of Puerto Rico who is just not part of the Government of Puerto Rico. Like a neighbor, a friend, or a
family member, or a colleague saying, Hey, you shouldn't smoke because it's bad for you?
A. Oh, I see.
Q. Did you ask them that?
A. The thing is that you must remember that I told you that in Puerto Rico, the government was the one who gave the example
and people would follow that. And they would not follow whatever any friend or anyone who wanted to help may have said
or relatives, in fact.
Q. So, it is your opinion that people here in Puerto Rico would not listen to what their friends or family members said, only
what the government said?
A. In the case of cigarettes, that's the way it was.
Q. Do you think they -
A. And it is still.
Q. Do you think they listen to the cigarette companies?
A. Now they do because I imagine that they can read the warnings, the labels. But even so, they are not following them, they
are not paying attention. Let me tell you, I don't smoke. And if I were to consciously look at what it says there and officially,
this being so, I would never smoke.
Q. Let me ask you: Do you think people do things that they know is bad for them?
A. Yes.
Q. So, do you think that people could know that smoking is bad for them and still do it?
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
A. Can you repeat the question, please?
Q. Do you think that people could know that smoking is bad for them but they still do it?
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
A. Yes.

Q. Do you think people today know that smoking is bad for them?
A. Could you please repeat?
Q. I'll even change it a little bit.
Do you think that the average Puerto Rican today knows that smoking is bad for him or her, that it is harmful to their health?
A. I would not be able to answer that question.
Q. Why not?
A. Well, because I can answer that particular question based on my experience, but you must remember that I am not a smoker
myself. And then there are certain things, certain characteristics that smokers have that we just don't know how they might act.
Q. Remember, when we're talking about common knowledge, it is not limited to smoking. It is the average person in Puerto
Rico. Do you think they know today that smoking is harmful to their health?
A. Well, I just can't say. There is many people who smoke, and I just could not answer that question because of that. Because
people continue smoking.
Q. I think you agreed with me a few minutes ago that people do things that they know are bad for them?
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
A. Can you have that question again?
Q. Sure. I said, I think you agreed with me a few minutes ago that people do things that they know are bad for them?
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
A. Yes, that's true.
Q. Let's go back to the oral history for a minute.
Are you familiar with any guidelines that historians are supposed to follow when conducting oral history?
A. Yes, I had to.
Q. What guidelines are you familiar with that you use?
A. Approaching the person and follow a list of questions. And after having received those responses, compare those with another
person who may have been at the same place or had the same experiences.
Q. Do you tape-record your interviews?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you tape-record these interviews?

64Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. No.
Q. Why not?
A. It was an answer to one single question.
Q. So, this interview consisted of one question?
A. Yes.
Q. Let me ask you: Because you were interviewing the children of people who had smoked, how do you know that the children
knew everything that had happened to the smoker in his or her life?
A. Well, in all honesty, it is quite difficult to assert that. But I was supporting my questions based on the good faith of these
people.
Q. I understand. I'm not suggesting they were not acting in good faith. But they were acting with limited knowledge because they
were obviously born at some point after this other person, their parent was born, and they could have no personal knowledge
of anything that went on their parents life before they were born?
MS. MARTÍNEZ: Objection to form.
A. Yes. But possibly, you know, in Puerto Rico, parents around children -- the children know a lot about their parents history
in their life. If they have not learned it from them, they learn of it from friends and relatives and people in the community.
Q. Is that because the oral tradition in Puerto Rico is very strong and people talk a lot about a lot of different topics?
A. Yes.
Q. Is that a major source of information for people here in Puerto Rico, that oral tradition?
A. Yes.
Q. Why did you select these two particular people?
A. I didn't select them. They came to me and I took advantage of the situation to ask the questions. Because I asked other people.
I did ask other people, but they didn't know anything.
Q. When you say you asked other people but they didn't know anything, what do you mean by that?
A. That they didn't have any knowledge about tobacco or anything about it.
Q. How many other people did you talk to?
A. Possibly five or six others.
Q. Did you ask them that same question?

65Virginia Prado ALVAREZ, et al., v. R.J. REYNOLDS..., 2004 WL 5487028...
A. Yes. Well, first of all, I would ask whether their parents or they smoked, or whether they had discussed smoking and why
they smoked.
But my interest was whether they had received any information or any advisory from the government or an agency of the
government for them to stop. And not only from the government, whether they had received any advisory from anyone. But
what happens is that anything from the government would be official, you see.
Q. Do you think that in doing oral histories, particularly like this where you're asking questions about what people knew, is It
important to make sure you get a representative sample of the population?
A. Excuse me. The question again?
Q. Sure. In doing oral histories like you did with this and asking what people knew on a particular topic, do you think that it's
important that you get a representative sample of the population?
A. If something official is done and with time, that is so. That is how it should be.
Q. Do you think you got a representative sample of the population?
A. No. That would be a broader study and it would take a lot more time. But it can be done. It is not a representative sample,
but it is an example.
MS. BUCHANAN: Can we take a break?
(Whereupon, a recess was taken from 2:16 p.m. to 2:21 p.m.)
BY MS. BUCHANAN:
Q. Professor, are you available on either the 4th, 5th or 6th of October?
A. I would have to check my agenda.
Q. Would you mind checking?
A. I will call her.
Q. Please call her. We're trying to reschedule the continuation of this deposition. Since you've been noticed as an expert in the
De Jesús Rivera case as well, we thought we would try and finish the deposition in this case and begin the deposition in the
other case and try to kill two birds in one stone on the same day.
Thank you very much.
(Time noted: 2:22 p.m.)
