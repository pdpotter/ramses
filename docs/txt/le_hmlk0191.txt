DIRECT EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Good afternoon, Dr. Kyriakoudes.
A. Good afternoon.
MS. BROWN: Gary, do you want to put your presence on the record?
MR. McPHARLlN: No. That's fine. I'm kidding. This is Gary Paige assisting Todd McPharlin on the handling of this deposition. Jenny, my understanding is that this is going to be on the updated reliance materials only?
MS. BROWN: Any case-specific opinions he has in the Naugle case, things beyond his generic testimony.
MR. MCPHARLIN: Right.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Okay. So you understand, Dr. Kyriakoudes, what we're here this afternoon is on the Naugle case?
A. Yes. I understand that.
Q. When were you first contacted to work on the Naugle case?
A. it seems to me sometime in the --
144
MR. MCPHARLIN: Jenny, just so I understand, I
apologize, but did you take a deposition already on the Naugle case?
MS. BROWN: No. This is our one and only deposition on the Naugle case.
MR. PAIGE: Oh, okay. Because -- okay. I thought you took a depo in the Naugle case and you had some updated reliance materials. That's not correct?
MS. BROWN: No. What happened was when Dr. Kyriakoudes was disclosed in the Naugle case, he was disclosed as a generic expert.
MR. PAIGE: Right. But the thing about when he was retained in Naugle, I'm assuming you already did that with him?
MS. BROWN: No. This is my first time to Dr. Kyriakoudes about the Naugle case.
MR. PAIGE: Did somebody else talk to him about it or no?
MS. BROWN: Gary, honest, I am not mincing words with you. This is the one and only deposition of Dr. Kyriakoudes in the Naugle case.
MR. PAIGE: I apologize.
MS. BROWN: No. That's okay. I just want you
to know, I am not splicing your words. This really
145
is it.
MR. PAIGE: Okay. Sorry.
MS. BROWN: That's okay.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. And if you answered my question,
Dr. Kyriakoudes, I have to apologize because I have forgotten what your answer was.
A. No. it was sometime over the summer and I believe I was asked for deposition dates. That was the initial contact.
Q. Okay. And who made that initial contact?
A. Mr. Todd McPharlin.
Q. Now, at that point, did you know that you had already been listed as an expert in the Naugle case?
A. I don't really keep track of that particular
aspect of it. I've worked with Mr. McPharlin on previous cases and we have an understanding that of working, you know. If he sees my testimony as being relevant to his case, that he can list me. So I don't know if I had been listed or not.
MS. BROWN: I'm going to have marked as -- can we mark this as Naugle 1. Let's mark this as Naugle 1.
(Naugle Exhibit No. 1 marked for identification.)
146
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, what's been placed in front of you is Deposition Exhibit Naugle 1. Have you seen this document before?
A. No.
Q. Okay. And this is the notice of service of plaintiff's expert disclosures in the Lucinda Naugle case; correct?
A. Yes. That's what it is.
Q. And if you turn -- the pages aren't numbered,
Dr. Kyriakoudes, I apologize for that. If you turn to the third page from the end.
A. The one with my name on it?
Q. No. Actually it's a couple pages after that, it says: Certificate of service.
A. Okay.
Q. So this was served by the Kelley, Uustal Firm in January 2009; correct?
A. That's what it says.
Q. Okay. Now, if you go to -- I think the page you were on has your name on it. You see that?
A. Yes.
Q. And that's, I think, page five of the disclosure. Have you reviewed this disclosure, the substance of this disclosure before?
A. Well, let me take a look. I mean, I've not seen this particular document, but let me read the disclosure and I will give you an answer.
Q. Okay.
A. This is the standard boilerplate language that has appeared many times.
Q. Okay. And under your name it says: Opinion type, generic; correct?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. Now, when Mr. McPharlin contacted you this summer, did he tell you what he wanted you to do for this case?
A. He said would I -- or, you know, I've got another case coming up, can you give me some dates for the deposition, which I supplied to him. That's the extent of it.
Q. Did he outline for you what areas of testimony he wanted to elicit from you for the Naugle case?
A. No.
Q. Did he describe the case for you?
A. Subsequent to that we have -- I asked him a series of questions to provide me with some context. So that would be a discussion. Yes.
Q. And when you say subsequent to that, do you
for deposition dates?
A. Yes.
Q. And do you remember when that was?
A. No, I don't. And, I believe, the first contact was probably through e-mail, just to be precise.
Q. is that a copy of an e-mail that you still have in your possession?
A. I might. I can look if you want it.
Q. Okay. Dr. Kyriakoudes, can you get your e-mails today so that we can ask you about them at the deposi tion?
A. if I -- if I have access to a computer terminal I could.
Q. Okay.
A. You mean this particular e-mail that we just mentioned?
Q. Right.
A. I could see if that's -- if that's in there.
Q. Okay.
MR. PAIGE: There's going to be e-mails from Todd to Louis, I just prefer we wait 15 minutes until Todd gets back.
MS. BROWN: Okay. We will. I just wanted to know whether Dr. Kyriakoudes had the ability to get those e-mails today.
149
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Okay. So subsequent to the e-mail, you had a telephone conversation with Mr. McPharlin?
A. Yeah. I've had a phone call about this. Yes.
Q. And do you recall when that phone call was?
A. I mean, I really don't. I mean, it's -- I'm very busy and I don't recall.
Q. Now, you said you asked Mr. McPharlin questions about the case; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. what kind of information did you tell
Mr. McPharlin you needed about the case?
A. well, the information that I always ask, I ask -- I'm interested in knowing, you know, following my general procedure of not the biographer for the plaintiff, but rather a historian of the cigarette industry and smoking as a cultural and social and political phenomenon in American life. I was really just interested in locating the smoker in question, in historical time and space.
Q. So what kinds of -- what information do you need in order to do that?
A. Well, historical time would be, you know -- you know, what generation or, you know, what birth year, for example, would supply that information. And space would
150
be, you know, an explanation of where the person spent their life or at least -- at least a portion of it that is most relevant to me.
Q. And what portion of it is most relevant to you?
A. The point -- the portion, you know, up to
smoking initiation.
Q. Is information after the person started smoking relevant to you?
A. Yes. That's relevant, too. But, you know, I'm particularly interested in locating the smoker in historical time and space, you know, particularly at the point where they -- they undergo the process of becoming a smoker.
Q. Now, do you recall what Mr. McPharlin told you, as far as where Ms. Naugle was in time and space?
A. Yes.
Q. And what did he tell you?
A. She was born in the late 1940's and lived in the Fort Lauderdale area.
Q. Did he tell you whether she had always lived in the Fort Lauderdale area?
A. if he did, I'm not recollecting.
Q. what did Mr. McPharlin tell you about Ms. Naugle's smoking initiation?
A. That's it. That's what he told me. Those are
my questions and those were the answers he gave me. It wasn't any more discussion about it.
Q. So you didn't ask him when she started smoking?
A. Oh, I see. I think she started smoking -- I did ask that. And his response was the late '60s.
Q. Do you know how old she was when she started smoki ng?
A. Well, doing the math, she would have been anywhere between 18 and 21, in that range. But I don't know the exact year.
Q. In addition to your conversation with Mr. McPharlin, did you do anything else to learn about the plaintiff in this case?
A. No.
Q. Have you reviewed any depositions?
A. No.
Q. So everything you know about Ms. Naugle comes straight from Mr. McPharlin?
A. Yes. That would be fair.
Q. Has Mr. McPharlin provided you any documentation related to Lucinda Naugle's date of birth, where she lived or when she became a smoker?
A. No. I haven't requested that. I don't need
it.
Q. Will you be providing opinions specific to
152
Lucinda Naugle in this case?
A. Well, my testimony would be -- will be consistent with all the prior testimony I've given. The way you framed that question is a little vague to me.
So let me give you little more precision on that.
I've often been asked if I will talk about what -- whether a particular message had a particular impact on a particular person at a particular point in time. And I don't make those fine-grained connections.
I don't think anybody can, at least, as a historical -using a historical analysis.
My opinions will relate to the -- you know, the time in which she was born into and the history of the
national cigarette culture as it emerged at the point where she was born into this world and grew and developed, whether that is specific to her is, you know, that's -- that just depends on how you define specific. I'm not trying to parse words here.
As I said many times, I'm not the biographer for the particular plaintiff, but rather a historian of the industry in America's history with the cigarette.
And the plaintiff's -- or the smoker, to be more precise, it's not always the plaintiff -- comes into it simply in that somebody born in 1920 is going to be experiencing a different phase of this process of
153
historical development compared to someone born in 1950.
So to the extent that 1950 or '47 is my recollection of roughly her birth year, is there's -that's in a different period of the development of America's smoking culture than, say, someone born in 1920. I am not trying to muddle things up. But that's -- that's how I see it.
Q. But in your opinions, you can't distinguish -or your opinions won't distinguish Lucinda Naugle from anybody who is in her birth cohort; is that true?
A. Yes. Yes. That would -- I mean, you said it a little more succinctly than I did. I will only -- or, you know, I will discuss her as part of her generation, her cohort, you know, her position in historical time.
Q. Have you reviewed any interrogatory responses in this case?
A. No.
Q. Did you review the complaint?
A. No.
Q. Have you reviewed any pleadings associated with the Naugle case?
A. No. Pleadings don't play into my expert opinions, just, you know, as a point.
Q. And just so the record is clear, have you reviewed any documents whatsoever specific to the Naugle
case?
A. Well, here when you say documents, if what you mean are things generated, like, deposition testimony that are generated through the process of the actions of the court and its work, I've not reviewed any -- any material related to that. I did, by way of historical context, review visual materials relating to the history of the Fort Lauderdale area. And, you know, basically, you know, the 40's through the '60s, which I brought with me.
Q. Okay. Well, Dr. Kyriakoudes, why don't you show us what you brought with you today.
A. Okay. I brought two things with me today, two sets of things. One, my curriculum vitae, which I can't remember if you asked me about that earlier. And then I brought a series of photographs, which I've supplied photocopies for you.
MS. BROWN: Let's go ahead and mark this as the next Naugle exhibit, Naugle Exhibit No. 2.
(Naugle Exhibit No. 2 marked for identification.)
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, would you mind if I flipped through Exhibit 2?
A. Absolutely not. Here you go.
155
Q. Now, Dr. Kyriakoudes, the first page of Exhibit 2 -- well, first of all, let me ask you this.
Strike that for a second.
Are all of these photographs from the same
source?
A. I did not acquire them from the same source.
No. They're from different sources.
Q. Okay. Let's start with the first page and we'll probably need to mark each page. Can you tell me what this page that's marked Naugle 2 depicts?
A. Yeah. This is a picture of the Philip Morris bellhop character, Johnny Robitini, sometimes nicknamed Johnny Philip Morris, on a promotional visit to Fort Lauderdale in the 1950's.
Q. And where did you locate that page?
A. From a historical work called Historic Photos of Fort Lauderdale. I believe the author's name is Turner.
Q. And how will you make use of that at trial in the Naugle case?
A. well, I think this is an -- an example of Philip Morris marketing efforts in the Fort Lauderdale area in the 1950's. And the picture illustrates Mr. Robitini in his bellhop uniform standing around some children, and those are the Junior Johnnys, and he is
156
there for a parade. And they are -- they are holding Philip Morris advertisements, printed advertisements, and cartons of Philip Morris cigarettes in their hands.
Q. And you said that's from the 1950's. Can you be more specific?
A. I can't, it's indicated as 1950's in the -- in the document itself. And that's the best information I have.
Q. Do you consider this book from which you pulled
this page to be an authoritative source?
A. Yes. I mean, the pictures that it provides would be authoritative, I mean, a fair and accurate depiction of those photographs. Yes.
Q. How can -- how can you determine whether this is a fair and accurate depiction of an event that happened in Fort Lauderdale in the 1950's?
A. well, it's a case where the picture speaks for itself.
Q. Do you see anywhere where it indicates it's Fort Lauderdale in the 1950's -MR. PAIGE: Excuse me, Jenny.
MS. BROWN: Yes.
MR. PAIGE: I just want to be clear. When you're using the word authoritative, it seems like he's using -- he means authentic because he's saying
fair and accurate. So I would just like the record to be clear what he was talking about when he is
saying authoritative.
A. Yes. I think it's an accurate depiction of the photograph.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. My question to you, Dr. Kyriakoudes, is how do you know that this is an accurate picture of something that occurred in Fort Lauderdale in the 1950's?
A. There's a caption in this, you know, quite lavish and expensively-produced coffee table sized folio book that indicates such, it has a caption that tells you.
Q. And there's nothing in the picture itself that identifies it as having been taken in the 1950's in Fort Lauderdale; correct?
A. well, there's -- no. Not within the picture itself.
Q. I mean, looking at this picture, this could have easily been taken in Los Angeles; correct?
A. why would it appear in a book on historic photos of Fort Lauderdale with pictures taken, as I recall, for that one from the Fort Lauderdale Historical
Society? You know, you're getting to a point here of -of conspiracy that, I mean, someone could have snuck
into the archive and stuck the picture in there. But I don't think that's likely. I -- I trust the book, it's a reasonable and accurate depiction. And so, you know, that's my response to that. I rely on it. It's a -
Q. Now, who did you say the author was? I'm sorry, were you finished?
A. Turner is, I believe, the last name. I mean, do you want me to get the book?
Q. Do you have the book with you?
A. Yeah, it's in my suitcase.
Q. Okay, well, we don't need to take a break right now, but at some point, yeah, get the book.
A. Yeah.
Q. Okay. But my question for you was, are you familiar with Mr. Turner's work beyond this coffee table book that you took this page from?
A. No. No. It's -- when you're researching
historic photos, relying on these standard pictorial histories of local communities is a normal and accepted method used by historians to expeditiously come at photographs and acquire photographs.
Q. I have a question that escaped, we'll come back to Naugle 2.
MS. BROWN: Let's mark this as Naugle 3.
(Naugle Exhibit Nos. 3 through 12 marked for
159
identification.)
MS. BROWN: And, in fact, while we're doing that, why don't we just mark each one as a separate exhibit so we know in the deposition what we're talking about. Gary, just so you understand,
Dr. Kyriakoudes has provided a stack of black and white photos that have been -- either been copied or printed from the computer. So we will mark each one of those so we can address them separately.
MR. PAIGE: I'll object to that.
the VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the video record.
MS. BROWN: Okay, we're back on the record.
And just so the record reflects, Mr. McPharlin is not in attendance right now in the deposition. He's given permission for it to go forward without his presence. And if Mr. Keane, who is still here on behalf of Dr. Kyriakoudes believes there's an issue that Mr. McPharlin needs to address, he will track down Mr. McPharlin who is in another room involved in a deposition -- in another deposition in the Naugle case, is that correct?
MR. KEANE: That fairly represents the happeni ngs.
MS. BROWN: Okay. Now, when we broke, one of
160
the things that I asked to be raised with Mr. McPharlin, since he's not here right now, was whether we could have produced to us the correspondence asked for in the deposition duces tecum request. Specifically, correspondence between Mr. McPharlin and/or his office and Dr. Kyriakoudes and correspondence between Dr. Proctor and
Dr. Kyriakoudes. And Dr. Kyriakoudes was able to print his e-mails from one of the computers located here at the law firm. And, Mr. Keane, do you know what Mr. McPharlin's position is on production of those e-mails?
MR. KEANE: I don't. However, I will say that I think you're probably looking at a bunch of innocuous scheduling and communications across with Stacy from Shook, Hardy & Bacon, copies of which were forwarded along. And there's one that -there's one e-mail that he's going to have to pass on with Mr. Proctor. I think the recent e-mail probably is. And there's a -- there's an e-mail dated October -- there he is -- October 8, 2009 that has reference to Dr. Kyriakoudes securing his own counsel. So that probably is ruled off.
MS. BROWN: And, I'm sorry, the date on that was what?
MR. KEANE: That's October 8, 2009. They
needed you to pass on some. This one is mine, we had printed -- they had asked for the correspondence that had gone back and forth. This one of October 8th has reference to prospective counsel.
MR. MCPHARLIN: Okay.
MR. KEANE: And the rest of them, I think, are just scheduling. So if you want to take a look at those, I wasn't purporting to pass on.
MR. McPharlin: These are being produced or
not?
MR. KEANE: These -- these were requested incident to the -MS. BROWN: Deposition duces tecum.
MR. KEANE: -- document request. And the good doctor has printed them off of his e-mail off of our computer. And the question is, are you going to produce those?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Well, I will have to consult with Professor Kyriakoudes.
MR. KEANE: Okay.
MR. McPharlin: So you want to take a break.
MS. BROWN: Okay.
THE WITNESS: You want to -- okay.
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're off the video record.
162
(Discussion held off the record.)
the VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the video record.
MS. BROWN: Now, Todd, we took yet another break so that you could go over the e-mails printed by Dr. Kyriakoudes with him. Are we now going to have those e-mails produced to us?
MR. McPharlin: These I don't have a problem producing. These are objectionable. They don't relate to -- I'm not sure what part of the duces tecum you guys are talking about. But these are private communications between Dr. -- between Professor Kyriakoudes and the recipients and I don't believe that they are to be required to produce, the personal e-mails.
MS. BROWN: Okay.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, on one of our earlier breaks you went to your computer and printed certain e-mails; correct -- or not your computer. A computer here at the law firm and printed certain e-mails; correct?
A. That's right.
Q. And what -- as a category, what e-mails did you print? What were you looking for in your e-mail box that you were going to hit print on?
163
A. Correspondence related to the Naugle trial between myself, Mr. McPharlin and his office.
Q. Okay. Anything else?
A. And then I printed out a recent communication from Robert Proctor.
Q. From -- or from Dr. Proctor?
A. From.
Q. And this morning you also referenced an e-mail that you had received from Dr. Proctor sometime in the
winter that listed a bunch of evening Engle Progeny trials. Did you print that document?
A. Well, that's not -- that's not actually -- I didn't print that document, it was a discussion of past -- past activity.
Q. From Dr. Proctor?
A. To Dr. Proctor.
Q. what was the date of that e-mail?
A. It was in February. I don't have it in front of me. I don't know the exact date.
Q. So you do have that e-mail in your e-mail box?
A. Yes.
Q. And you could have printed it when you went out to print the others?
A. Yes.
Q. Now, this recent communication with
164
Dr. Proctor, what was the date of that communication?
A. Last week.
Q. And did that communication relate, in any way,
to the Engle Progeny cases in your involvement or his involvement in the Engle Progeny cases?
A. No. Not in any way.
Q. what was the substance of that communication?
A. A research matter relating to the history of the tobacco industry.
Q. Now, the correspondence that you have in front of you, Dr. Kyriakoudes, is this all of the correspondence that you have between you and Mr. McPharlin or anyone in his office?
A. Yes.
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, why did you not print your February e-mail from Dr. Proctor -- or to Dr. Proctor, I'm sorry?
A. I reviewed it with the attorneys.
Q. And by the attorneys, you mean Mr. Keane and Mr. McPharlin?
A. Yes. I mean, they -- I mean, they reviewed it.
Q. When you say they reviewed it, did you print R or they were looking at the screen?
A. No. I printed it out. I don't want you to
of it.
Q. Okay. So you did, in fact, print your February e-mail with Dr. Proctor?
A. Yes.
Q. And that's one of the two e-mails that Mr. McPharlin has in his hand or had in his hand is those he's not producing?
A. Possibly. Yeah. I mean, I think he has them.
I don't have them.
Q. And you just printed them while we were on break?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. And you printed this e-mail from last week that you had with Dr. Proctor?
A. That's correct.
MS. BROWN: On what basis are you not producing either of those e-mails?
MR. MCPHARLIN: I think they're -- our objection was made earlier. They're overly broad, harassing and they're not relevant. I think that's the -- hang on a second.
MS. BROWN: Well, Todd, while you look for whatever objections you may have filed previously -BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, is it on the instruction of
166
counsel that you are not producing these e-mails?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Hold on, Professor Kyriakoudes.
I want to review it before we proceed so -MR. KEANE: You need to be more precise. You need some copies?
MR. MCPHARLIN: okay, we will -- well, like I said, the requests are overbroad. I don't think these e-mails are relevant and I think they are personal nature between Professor Kyriakoudes and the recipient. And I think he has a right to assert a privacy objection to requests that are made of him
to produce documents. Not every -MS. BROWN: So it's your -MR. MCPHARLIN: Not every time, you know -- if he corresponds with somebody, it doesn't entitle you to look into everything he does just because you're deposing him or just because he is an expert witness. That doesn't entitle you to take a microscope and look into every little thing he does so -BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, the October e-mail, the one from last week with Dr. Proctor, does that make reference to your intent to retain an attorney to represent you?
167
A. No.
Q. Well, there was reference at one point to one of these e-mails making reference to an attorney -retention of an attorney. Have you produced that e-mail to us?
MR. KEANE: I think you have it.
MS. BROWN: it's this one? well, Todd, I mean, I hate to delay the deposition any further, particularly when we've already lost more than an hour while you were involved in the other Naugle deposition. But I do think that communications between Dr. Kyriakoudes and Dr. Proctor, particularly communications that relate to this litigation, as he says the February e-mail does and that are contemporaneous with all these events that are unfolding related to Dr. Proctor and the University of Florida issues, that those communications between Dr. Kyriakoudes and Dr. Proctor are relevant.
MR. MCPHARLIN: Okay. How can -- how can an e-mail that took place before any of this took place be relevant to that? How could it possibly be relevant? it can't be because it happened beforehand. So the February e-mail would have nothing to do with the Proctor situation.
MS. BROWN: Right. Which is what I said.
MR. MCPHARLIN: Okay. Right? You knew that?
MS. BROWN: Mr. McPharlin, which is what I said yeah, we do, Mr. McPharlin, which is why I said one e-mail, which would be the February e-mail relates to this litigation. Not this issue, but this litigation generally, the Engle Progeny litigation.
And I'm basing that on Dr. Kyriakoudes' representation of what's contained in the February e-mail and then the October e-mail, the one that came last week.
MR. MCPHARLIN: It has nothing -- it has nothing to do with -- has nothing to do with the Proctor situation. So it's not relevant.
MS. BROWN: I think any communications between Dr. Kyriakoudes and Dr. Proctor, particularly right now, are relevant. So what I'm suggesting -- we can battle this out all day. I haven't seen the e-mail, so I don't really have a basis to argue with you.
what I am suggesting is we may need to get Judge Streitfeld on the phone because we are about to go to trial and this is going to be my one and only opportunity to talk to Dr. Kyriakoudes about any of these issues.
MR. MCPHARLIN: So what are you saying?
169
MS. BROWN: I'm ready to get Judge Streitfeld on the phone to discuss production of those e-mails.
MR. MCPHARLIN: if you want to call him, it's your deposition. You can call. I certainly can't stop you from calling Judge Streitfeld.
MS. BROWN: Well, I hate to do this, we're going to have to take another break.
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the video record.
(Telephone conference with Judge Streitfeld.)
MS. BROWN: This is Jenny Brown and I'm here with Todd McPharlin, Dr. Kyriakoudes and others in attendance at the Dr. Kyriakoudes' deposition.
the COURT: Sounds like a long day. Go ahead.
MS. BROWN: it has been. As part of our duces tecum request, we requested from Dr. Kyriakoudes any written correspondence he's had with Dr. Proctor, including any correspondence that relates to the Engle Progeny litigation. Dr. Kyriakoudes has produced a few e-mails to us, but there are two e-mails which Mr. McPharlin is refusing to produce.
One -- and I haven't seen those e-mails, so Mr. McPharlin could probably do a better job of representing what they are. But based on what we've been told, my understanding is one is an e-mail to Dr. Proctor from Dr. Kyriakoudes from February,
170
which discusses past activity in the Engle trial -I mean, the Engle Progeny cases. And the other is a communication between Dr. Proctor and Dr. Kyriakoudes dated last week.
THE COURT: Okay.
MR. McPharlin: Afternoon, Judge. This is Todd McPharli n.
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. MCPHARLIN: Professor Kyriakoudes has posed an objection to producing the two e-mails. They are, to him, a personal correspondence to Professor Proctor. One e-mail is from, I believe, February of this year prior to any of the issues that related to Dr. Proctor and the University of Florida. It happened well prior to that. So it has nothing to do with the university of Florida or Dr. Proctor's contact with the Professor there, it has nothing to do with the business that we have on Friday, obviously 'cause that took place long before that.
The second e-mail is more recent, it's about a week old. And it also has nothing to do with the University of Florida issue or Dr. Proctor contacting the University of Florida or the business that we have on Friday. Dr. Proctor has a -Professor Kyriakoudes, rather, has asserted a -- an
objection that these are personal correspondence between himself and Professor Proctor. And I explained to defense counsel that just because he is an expert witness in this case, it doesn't mean that they can take a microscope and look into every personal thing that he's done or been involved in, even if it's related to Dr. Proctor. They take a different perspective and think that -- and have taken the position that they can obtain whatever they want from him because he is an expert witness in this case.
I think he has a right to privacy. I think he has a right to assert a privacy objection to matters which are unrelated to this university of Florida issue, like any other witness who is being deposed. You know, they have the same privacy rights.
THE COURT: Thank you. Response?
MS. BROWN: This deposition -- I mean, this morning we deposed Dr. Kyriakoudes about issues related to, I'll call it the Proctor matter. I think you know what we're talking about. And now
we've moved on to the Naugle portion of the deposition. This is my opportunity to question Dr. Proctor -- I mean, I'm sorry, Dr. Kyriakoudes about any of his biases or any relationships that he
172
has with the other witnesses in the case.
THE COURT: Okay. Well, is there any objection to just bringing those along with you to the hearing on Friday?
MR. McPharlin: No. if I'm being asked to, of course I wi11.
THE COURT: Well, that is the only way for me to resolve it because I can't determine the discoverability of those e-mails unless I see them.
MR. MCPHARLIN: Okay.
MS. BROWN: And Judge Streitfeld -THE COURT: What you're telling me is that there is communication between the two historian experts listed in this case and the historian is saying, well, they're private and they're unrelated
to their testimony or their -- anything that might be germane to their testimony. But the only way to determine whether or not there's a privacy privilege attached to the e-mails is for me to see them. So bring them with you on Friday.
MR. MCPHARLIN: Just so it's clear, Your Honor,
I think they're unrelated to UF issue, but I will bring them.
THE COURT: Well, I don't agree with you that the inquiry is limited to this specific matter or
173
with regard to what occurred with Professor Michel and with the four graduate assistants at the University of Florida. I don't -- I would agree with you that that is a primary issue, but whether it is or is not part of the greater issue remains to be seen. So bring them with you on Friday.
MR. MCPHARLIN: Okay.
MR. KEANE: Judge, this is Michael Keane speaking. I have recently been hired to represent
Dr. Kyriakoudes.
THE COURT: Okay.
MR. KEANE: We -- my assistant called your chambers, we just learned of the hearing scheduled for Friday.
THE COURT: Uh-hum.
MR. KEANE: And we're requesting for an opportunity to appear by phone.
THE COURT: You were told the answer is no. It takes a long time -MR. KEANE: I know, Judge.
THE COURT: -- and you're going to hang up my phone line.
MR. KEANE: I know. But I have a summary judgment hearing in Tampa.
THE COURT: Mr. Keane, let me make this clear
to you. This issue needs to be addressed before this -- Ms. Naugle's trial.
MR. KEANE: I understand, Judge.
THE COURT: So if you can't be there and Mr. -the Professor wants a lawyer to be there, it's going to have to be somebody else.
MR. KEANE: I understand. I was just trying to explain a hopeless scheduling conflict that I have. And I will work it out another way. I was just trying to get your ear and see if there was a way -THE COURT: It can't be worked out another way.
MR. KEANE: Not with your court I'm talking about.
THE COURT: Okay.
MR. KEANE: Working it out with the other court. I hear you loud and clear, Judge.
THE COURT: I conduct this hearing.
MR. KEANE: Is it scheduled for an hour?
THE COURT: I hope it won't take an hour.
MR. KEANE: Okay.
THE COURT: I got the day set aside for motions on this trial that begins the following Wednesday.
I will be out Monday and Tuesday. And I'm sure the
lawyers want to know what is going to happen with these two witnesses.
MR. KEANE: Do you have any feel for where this -- I am just asking where this -- where this motion would fall on your -THE COURT: That is not an appropriate question. I tend to take this stuff -MR. KEANE: Chronologically. I am asking about chronology.
THE COURT: The issues with regard to Dr. Proctor and Dr. Kyriakoudes are the first on the agenda.
MR. KEANE: That's what I needed to know.
Thank you.
THE COURT: Okay.
MS. BROWN: Judge Streitfeld, just one other thing I wanted to raise while we have you on the phone. Earlier today when we were doing the deposition portion related to the university of
Florida issue, there were several times when plaintiff's counsel advised Dr. Kyriakoudes not to answer the question, because in Mr. McPharlin's view, my question re-plowed old ground or had been asked and answered in prior depositions. I assume that's something, without you having a transcript in front of you, I assume that's something that we could also bring up with you on Friday as well.
176
THE COURT: Well, if time permits. If time permi ts.
MS. BROWN: Okay.
THE COURT: Anything else?
MS. BROWN: No. I think that's it, Your Honor.
THE COURT: Thank you very much.
MS. BROWN: Thank you.
(End of phone conference with Judge Streitfeld.)
the VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the video record.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, what I have in front of me are the e-mails that you have produced in response to the duces tecum request; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. I'm going to mark those as the next Naugle exhibit. And then in particular, I want to talk to you about the top page.
(Naugle Exhibit No. 13 marked for identification.)
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Now, Dr. Kyriakoudes, since we only have one copy, I'm going to look off your copy as well. This has been marked as Naugle Exhibit 13. And it appears to be
177
an e-mail dated October 8, 2009; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And it's an e-mail from you to Mr. McPharlin; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And to Chris Carlisle; correct?
A. Yes. That's correct.
Q. Now, who is Chris Carlisle?
A. He's an attorney.
Q. And why did you want him included in your correspondence related to this scheduling of your deposition in Naugle?
A. I was, at the time, considering him as possibly someone who could represent me.
Q. Had you retained Mr. Carlisle to represent you?
A. what do you mean retained? You mean paid him a fee and signed a contract with him or something like that?
Q. Had you paid Mr. Carlisle a fee?
A. No. No.
Q. Had you hired Mr. Carlisle, in your mind, to be your attorney?
A. In my mind, yes. That was my -- that was my understanding. That's why I thought it would be important for him to have knowledge of scheduling.
Q. Is Mr. Carlisle still your attorney?
A. No.
Q. When did your attorney relationship with Mr. Carlisle end?
A. Sometime after that e-mail pretty -- probably over the weekend or something like that.
Q. So this was Thursday October 8th. So sometime over the 10th or 11th?
A. Yes.
Q. And why did you end your relationship with Mr. Carlisle?
MR. McPharlin: Don't answer that, Professor Kyriakoudes.
MS. BROWN: On what grounds are you instructing the witness not to answer, Mr. McPharlin?
MR. KEANE: Anything he talked about is privi1ege.
MR. MCPHARLIN: Give me a break. You're asking him about communications he had with somebody he
considered to be his lawyer. You've got to really be kidding me.
MS. BROWN: I asked him why. I didn't ask him what he said to Mr. Carlisle. I merely asked him why.
MR. MCPHARLIN: Any discussions with
179
Mr. Carlisle are privileged and you can't ask him about them.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you understand that your communications with Mr. Carlisle are privileged; correct?
A. Yes. I understand that.
Q. Okay. Answer this question without reference to anything that you said to Mr. Carlisle. Okay?
A. Okay. I will try.
Q. Okay. Why did you end your relationship with Mr. Carlisle?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Professor, you don't have to
answer that. She's asking you about matters between you and Mr. Carlisle. That's an attorney-client privilege with him and you're not required to answer those questions about it.
A. Yeah. I have to agree with him on that.
MS. BROWN: So are you instructing him not to answer?
MR. MCPHARLIN: I'm doing just exactly what I just did.
MS. BROWN: But that was not an instruction not to answer; is that right, Todd?
MR. MCPHARLIN: You were sitting right there.
180
You heard me.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. So, Dr. Kyriakoudes, did you understand Mr. McPharlin to instruct you not to answer that questi on?
MR. KEANE: Let me make it simple. I'm -- I'm
his lawyer and I'm instructing him not to answer the question. Okay.
MS. BROWN: Okay.
MR. KEANE: it's privileged, it's attorney-client privileged. That is one of the only areas you can give that instruction, absent extraordinary circumstances like today and I'm giving it. He's not going to answer any more questions about his communications with Carlisle.
MR. McPharlin: Did you want to get Judge Streitfeld back on the phone for that question?
MS. BROWN: No. We can raise it with Judge Streitfeld tomorrow -- on Friday, Todd, if that's okay with you. Is raising it on Friday okay with you? Mr. McPharlin, is it okay with you if we raise it with Judge Streitfeld on Friday?
MR. MCPHARLIN: It would be okay with me if we fi ni sh.
MS. BROWN: Huh?
MR. MCPHARLIN: It would be okay with me if we fi ni shed.
MS. BROWN: Well, none of the rest of us took an hour or more this afternoon to go attend another deposition, Mr. McPharlin. Okay.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Now, Dr. Kyriakoudes, one of the e-mails that you told me that you were going to go print was one where Mr. McPharlin first made contact with you in the Naugle case. Can you identify which of those e-mails is that one?
A. This would be the first one.
Q. Okay, what you've handed me is the page that's dated August 20, 2009; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And Mr. McPharlin e-mailed you and said: When is a good time to talk? I have the other matter resolved. Correct?
A. That's what it says. Yes.
Q. Prior to this e-mail, had you and Mr. McPharlin talked about the Naugle case?
A. I don't think so. No.
Q. So as far as you know, this was the first you knew of the Naugle case was getting this e-mail from Mr. McPharlin?
182
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Dr. Kyriakoudes, before we took one of our breaks, we were working through the photos that you produced this morning; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Now, one of the photos was from a book that's called Historic Photos of Fort Lauderdale; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And that's this one marked Naugle 2; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. You are not going to testify in the Naugle trial, are you, that Ms. Naugle was aware of this event?
A. I don't know either way. All I can say is that it happened in Fort Lauderdale in the 1950's.
Q. And when you say the 1950's, could have been
1951?
A. 1950, it could have been '51. It could have been '59.
Q. And, again, you have no reason to believe that Ms. Naugle either saw or attended or knew anything about this event that's depicted in this photo; is that correct?
A. I have no evidence either way. I mean, it was in relation to -- as it described, some type of parade or festival. But, you know, that's the extent that I
183
can say it happened in Fort Lauderdale in the 1950's.
Q. And -- okay. Let's move to Naugle 3.
Dr. Kyriakoudes, I'm showing you what's been marked Naugle 3. That's another photo you produced to us this morning; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Can you tell us what's depicted in that photo?
A. well, this is a downtown street scene from Fort
Lauderdale from the 1960's. And so that's what in that pi cture.
Q. where did you get that photo?
A. From the same source, which is the Historic Photos of Fort Lauderdale.
Q. Now what -- how does this photo pertain to your opinions in the Naugle case?
A. All it does is provides an image of Fort Lauderdale in the 1960's for historical context.
Q. And do you intend to show this picture to the jury?
A. I might. Maybe. I don't know for sure. But I might show it. That's why I brought it with me.
Q. And you would show it to the jury for what purpose?
A. For historical context as I just described.
Q. To show them what a street scene looked like in
Fort Lauderdale in the 1960's?
A. Yes.
Q. I'm going to hand you now what's been marked Naugle 4. This was another photo you produced to us this morning; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. And where did you get this photo?
A. From the Fort Lauderdale Historical Society.
Q. Have you visited the Fort Lauderdale Historical Soci ety?
A. Not in person. I got this from their online archive.
Q. And what is the -- or how does this photo pertain to your opinions in the Naugle case?
A. well, this is, again, historical context from the time period in this case, sometime either in the 1940's or perhaps into the early '50s, indicating social situations in which cigarettes were used among young people at that time.
Q. Now, knowing that Lucinda Naugle was born in 1948, what relevance did this photo have to her?
A. Well, she was born into a world with values, practices, culture, ways of doing things. And so these
predecessor historical trends, this would be an example of that, are very relevant because this is the -- these
are the people that -- this is the world that she was born into in essence. One could also explain how if the values of the people around Ms. Naugle, perhaps parents and the like matter, or older people, you know, the next cohort, this would be an example of that cohort. And so that, you know, history is not -- doesn't begin with the birth of Ms. Naugle. it is a seamless web of development. And so you have to have context. That's what historical context is.
Q. And the likelihood is, Ms. Naugle may have been an infant, or at best, a toddler when this photo was taken; correct?
A. Well, that's true. That would likely be her age bearing there. But, again, it's relevant for understanding the world into which she was born.
Q. Now, I'm handing you what's been marked Naugle 5, Dr. Kyriakoudes. Can you identify for us what
that is?
A. This is a similar photograph to Exhibit No. 4. it is -- looks like it's seven people, four men, three women sitting around a table enjoying themselves at the Fort Lauderdale Servicemen Center socializing.
Q. And your intent would be to use this photo for the same purpose as the last one; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
186
Q. Did you tell me the date that that picture depi cts?
A. it doesn't have a specific date on it, but it's -- it's likely from the 1940's.
Q. I am now handing you what's been marked Naugle 6. Can you tell me what that depicts?
A. Again, this is just a mid 1950's restaurant scene just for historical context.
Q. Is there anything in that photo significant to your opinions in this case?
A. Well, just that it provides an example of, you know, public places and the like. I should point out, just so you know, in case you missed it, on Exhibit No. 5, the woman in the dark dress in the center of the picture is smoking. I just wanted to make sure that you were clear on that because you may want to --
Q. That was on Naugle 5?
A. Yeah. Naugle 5.
Q. You don't see anyone in Naugle 6 smoking, do
you?
A. it's hard to tell from that perspective of the pi cture.
Q. But my question to you, Dr. Kyriakoudes, was whether you saw anyone in this photo smoking. Do you see anyone in that photo smoking?
187
A. No, I don't. It doesn't mean they're not smoking, it's just the resolution of the photograph and the angle make it difficult to tell.
Q. Now, this is Naugle 7. Can you tell me what is
significant -- well, first, tell me where that photo comes from.
A. This also comes from the Fort Lauderdale Historical Society, their online archive.
Q. Tell me the significance of that photo to your opinions in this case?
A. well, this is a 1959 dated picture. This one has a firm date and it shows spring breakers, college students, three women in their -- in their disheveled hotel room playing cards and smoking.
Q. where do you see smoking in that photo,
Dr. Kyriakoudes?
A. I see an ashtray with what appears to be a cigarette in it, right there.
Q. You believe this is an ashtray?
A. Yes.
Q. Is that what you're pointing to?
A. Yes. That would be a glass ashtray.
Q. was the resolution better on the computer?
A. it's pretty clear to me here.
Q. You brought Naugle 8. Can you identify what
A. This is a theater marquis indicating a film from 1960 Where the Boys Are. That is a spring break adventure that was filmed in Fort Lauderdale.
Q. And what is the significance of that photo to your opinions in this case?
A. Historical context. Just, you know, taking the jury back in time to understand an earlier time in the history of the United States.
Q. I'm showing you what's been marked as Exhibit 9. Can you identify that for us, please.
A. Yes. This is a downtown department store in -or I should say a department store in Fort Lauderdale.
And, again, much like Exhibit No. 8, I've included it as an indicator of historical context.
Q. Again, there's no one in that photo smoking, is there, Dr. Kyriakoudes?
A. Not that I can tell. I mean, there are people walking along the street, but the resolution of the
photograph doesn't allow you to tell.
Q. I'm handing you what's been marked Naugle 10.
Can you, please, identify that.
A. This is a -- again, another example of historical context. Mid 1950's, a photograph of women shopping in a Sears Roebuck Store.
189
Q. And what's the significance of that to your opi nion?
A. Again, as with the previous two, historical context.
Q. I am now handing you what's been marked Naugle 11. Can you identify that for us.
A. Yes. This is a photograph of spring breakers as they call it. That is people in a -- what appears to be a Thunderbird, a 1955 Thunderbird. Young people in town for spring break.
Q. And what's the relevance of that picture to your opinions?
A. Again, just historical context. You know, the flavor of the past.
Q. And now Naugle 12. Can you identify that, pi ease.
A. Yeah. This is -- this one actually is relevant to Exhibit No. 8. This is a photograph of the filming on the street on Highway AlA in Fort Lauderdale of the film, where the Boys Are.
Q. And what year was that?
A. They list it as 1960.
Q. Now, with all of these photos that we've just run through, with the exception of the first one because we already talked about the first one, can you verify
190
that the dates listed on any of these photos are accurate?
A. well, I rely on the documentation provided by the source of the photographs. That's what I rely on.
Q. Now, Dr. Kyriakoudes, in the past in preparation for your testimony, you have reviewed
depositions and other plaintiff-specific materials in the case; correct?
A. Yes. Some cases I have.
Q. Is there a reason why you didn't do that in this case?
A. No. it -- just to the extent that I didn't feel it necessary. Again, as I've always said, I've only really sought to locate the smoker in question, in historical time and place. And that's really all I need to know for my -- you know, for my opinions.
Q. Have you prepared any kind of a report for this case or any kind of summary of your opinions for this case?
A. No, I have not.
Q. Do you -- do you know what publications Lucinda Naugle testified she read?
A. No, I do not.
Q. Do you know what television programs Lucinda Naugle testified she watched?
A. No, I do not.
Q. Do you know what brand of cigarettes Lucinda Naugle smoked?
A. I don't know.
Q. Do you know the circumstances under which Ms. Naugle had her first cigarette?
A. No, I don't.
Q. Do you know what brand was her first cigarette?
A. Excuse me. No. I don't know what her first brand was.
Q. So you don't know why she chose the brand she chose to smoke her first cigarette?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. is that correct?
A. No. I don't know about her -- her brand choi ces.
Q. Do you know if Ms. Naugle is still smoking?
A. I don't know about her personally in regard to her current condition at all.
Q. Do you know if she's alive?
A. I don't know.
Q. Do you know if she's married or single?
A. I don't know that either way.
Q. Do you know what her occupation is?
192
A. No. I don't know her occupation.
Q. Do you know if she's a registered nurse?
A. I said I didn't know her occupation.
MR. MCPHARLIN: Object to form.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Would that have any relevance to your opinions in this case?
A. No.
Q. Now, in advance of your deposition in this case, you produced, or Mr. McPharlin produced on your behalf, a set of supplemental reliance exhibits. Are you aware of that?
A. Yes.
Q. And some of those supplemental reliance
exhibits included articles from the Miami Herald and the Miami News; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you know if Ms. Naugle read the Miami Herald or the Miami News?
A. I don't know what she read.
Q. is it your intent in this case to testify about articles that ran in the New York Times?
A. I might, as an example of the national media coverage on this issue.
Q. Do you know if Ms. Naugle ever read the New
193
York Times?
A. No. I don't know whether she read it or not.
Q. Do you intend to testify about cigarette advertising in this case?
A. I have in the past and so I expect I'll probably discuss it again in this case. Yes.
Q. what cigarette advertisements do you intend to testify about in the Naugle case?
A. I haven't sat down to make my choices. I mean, you have all of my ads as part of my reliance documents.
So you have the universe from which I will select. But to be honest with you, I have not sat down and put together my presentation in this case. As I sit here now, I think it would be probably similar to what I've testified to in the past.
Q. would knowing what brand of cigarettes Ms. Naugle smoked be relevant to your opinions about cigarette advertising?
A. Not particularly. My testimony has always been that cigarette advertising, first and foremost, shapes public understanding of the product category of the cigarette and then does make an appeal to brand pitches.
So it's -- it's not really that important to me.
Q. Now, have you ever worked with Mr. McPharlin before this case?
194
A. Yes.
Q. And when was that?
A. A case called Ferlanti versus Liggett.
Q. in that case, did you review depositions of fact witnesses?
A. I skimmed them. Yes.
Q. But you don't intend to do that in this case; is that correct?
A. No. I'm trying to be more efficient in my use of time.
Q. Now, did you meet with Mr. McPharlin in preparation for your deposition today?
A. Very briefly as he walked in. I think he got here about maybe a quarter of 11:00 and we started at 11:00. So we exchanged greetings in the hallway.
Q. Other than that, any meetings you've had with Mr. McPharlin or others related to your Naugle specific opi nions?
A. No.
Q. In preparation for your deposition this afternoon related to the Naugle case, did you review any documents to prepare for your deposition?
A. No. I didn't -- I didn't do any special review
of documents. No.
Q. Have you -- have you billed the plaintiff's
counsel yet for your work on this case?
A. No. No, I haven't.
Q. How much time have you -- not billed -- but how much time have you accrued so far working on the Naugle case?
A. Not very much. I spent some time hunting down photographs. That's really in terms of the substantive work. A couple of hours maybe at the most.
Q. Did you charge Mr. McPharlin a retainer in this case?
A. No. No.
Q. In the past you charged a retainer when you've been retained in a case; correct?
A. well, I did a long time ago receive a retainer from Mr. McPharlin as part of the Ferlanti case. And that's enough. I don't -- I haven't charged a second
retainer for this particular case.
Q. So for the Naugle case, whatever you get paid in the Naugle case will depend on what you bill Mr. McPharlin?
A. Yes. That's right. But, you know, that's true of all -- just so you're clear -- and this word retainer maybe it leads to some confusion. I may not use it the same way lawyers use it. it's -- when I accept a retainer, it's essentially a deposit on the work that I
196
will I do. So I deduct it from the hours.
Q. But you don't have any kind of running deposit left over from Ferlanti that you are still billing against in the Naugle case, do you?
A. No. No. No. I bill for the hours in Ferlanti and was paid for that. And now this is another case.
Q. At what hourly rate do you plan to bill plaintiff's counsel for your work on this case?
A. $400 an hour.
Q. Prior to your deposition today, did you talk to
Mr. McPharlin about what documents you should or shouldn't produce in response to the document request attached to the notice?
A. when I received the schedule A, I went -- I went over it with him.
Q. And when was that?
A. About a week ago maybe.
Q. And at that point did you discuss all of the e-mails that you've either produced or Mr. McPharlin has withheld today?
A. No. we didn't discuss those particular e-mails, we just discussed that -- we went down the list and went -- went by the numbers of the schedule A and he mentioned some things were going to be objected to.
197
Q. Now, just for clarification on the e-mails, the two e-mails that Mr. McPharlin has possession of, are those the only two e-mails in your possession to or from Dr. Proctor that you have not produced to defendants?
Q. Yes.
A. No. I have -- I have many personal e-mails with him or some personal e-mails with him in professional matters unrelated to anything here. I have other e-mails, conversations -- or e-mail correspondence I should say.
Q. So in your e-mail box, you have more than the February e-mail to Dr. Proctor and the October e-mail from Dr. Proctor?
A. Well, I have e-mails discussing, you know, other matters. Yes.
Q. Do you have any e-mails to or from Dr. Proctor discussing matters at all related to the Engle Progeny litigation other than the one we've discussed earlier today?
A. No. And that's why I identified that one.
Q. Since May 1st of this year, how many e-mails generally crossing all topics have you received from Dr. Proctor?
A. Not many. Maybe -- maybe four or five total,
at the most.
Q. If we were to expand that to a year, how many have you received in the year of 2009 from Dr. Proctor?
A. At the most, maybe -- maybe six, seven or eight at the most.
Q. And that's in total for 2009?
A. In 2009. Yeah.
Q. How about e-mails from you to Dr. Proctor for the year 2009. How many of those are there?
A. Fewer.
Q. So somewhere under eight?
A. Yeah.
Q. And so prior to Friday's hearing,
Dr. Kyriakoudes, could you print the remainder of the e-mails to and from Dr. Proctor and provide them to Mr. McPharlin?
A. Well, I've given you the ones that -- I've identified the ones that relate -- the one that related
to anything to do with Engle. I mean, I have some in there that are personal nature. I can do this with you.
I don't have a problem with that.
Q. Okay.
A. That would be in addition to what I've already provided to you.
Q. I understand, Dr. Kyriakoudes. Now, the
199
materials that you brought with you today, which include your C.v. -- let's go ahead and get this marked as the next Naugle exhibit.
(Naugle Exhibit No. 14 marked for identification.)
MR. MCPHARLIN: You referred to two e-mails that you gave me. Is that what you're referring to, the e-mails you gave me that I'm bringing to the judge; right?
THE WITNESS: Right. And then she asked me about other e-mails with Robert. And I reminded her that I've supplied three e-mails that we talked
about earlier today related to this Florida busi ness.
MR. McPharlin: okay. Because you mentioned one particular -- you said there was one e-mail pertaining to Engle and the others didn't. Those are the two e-mails you gave to me; right?
THE WITNESS: That's right.
MR. MCPHARLIN: Those are the two e-mails I'm giving to the judge?
THE WITNESS: Yes.
MS. BROWN: Mr. McPharlin, he -Dr. Kyriakoudes was identifying that there are additional e-mails that he did not print on the
200
break.
MR. MCPHARLIN: I just wanted to know what he was referring to.
MS. BROWN: Oh, okay.
MR. McPharlin: Because he mentioned e-mails that he hasn't produced. I wanted to know if he was
talking about the ones that he give me or the ones
that he gave to me to give to the judge.
MS. BROWN: Okay.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Okay. Dr. Proctor -- I apologize,
Dr. Kyriakoudes, you know, it's getting late.
Dr. Kyriakoudes, we've handed you what's been marked Naugle Exhibit 14. And that's your C.V.; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you produced that in response to the duces tecum; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And then you provided these photos that we spent some time going through this afternoon; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And we talked about the fact that in advance of the deposition, you produced to us supplemental reliance materials; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And that was a supplement to those reliance materials that have been produced at the preservation deposition that you took part in back in January; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you have anything else in your Naugle file that you have not produced?
A. No.
Q. Do you have any notes that you've taken either as you've prepared your opinions for this case or you've had conversations with Mr. McPharlin related to the Naugle matter?
A. No. I've taken no notes.
Q. Now, Mr. McPharlin previously notified us that one of your supplemental opinions in this case will have to do with youth marketing.
A. Yes.
Q. what opinions about youth marketing do you intend to testify to in this case?
A. well, generally and broadly, the recruitment of
younger smokers was an essential part of the cigarette business. When I say younger smokers, smokers under 18.
And that not only was it an essential part of the business of running a cigarette company, that it was openly acknowledged within the cigarette manufacturers
202
that knowledge of youth smoking patterns and habits was an important part of the company's ability to know the smoking public and to know its current customer base.
Q. Are you aware that Ms. Naugle testified that she started smoking after the age of 18?
A. I'm generally aware that it was around 18.
Q. were you aware that she, in fact, testified that she started smoking at the age of 20?
A. I wasn't aware of that. But that doesn't impact my opinions.
Q. So she would not fall into this group of, quote, younger smokers that you were just talking about; correct?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
A. Well, I still -- you know, I look at it a little differently than you do. The industry is wel1-documented, well-known. Marketing efforts toward teenagers shaped the context of the cigarette culture into which Ms. Naugle lived. And so that's -- that's the way I -- I deal with it in my opinions.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Do you have, in your possession, any documents from Philip Morris that show a plan to market their products to individuals under the age of 18?
A. Not a plan, per se. No. I have other kind of
203
documents.
Q. So you've come across no marketing plans by Philip Morris that describe the market they're targeting as those under the age of 18?
A. Well, when you put it that way, no. Philip Morris has a significant amount of material, which I've included in my reliance, in which they are looking carefully at underage smokers with the goal towards
So in that regard, is that a plan? I mean, I haven't thought of it that way. But it's certainly an indicator of their acquisition of knowledge about underage smoking to inform their -- you know, their marketing efforts.
Q. These documents that you're referring to, were those created by individuals working in the marketing for Philip Morris?
A. They intended to come from their research arm.
I'm thinking of Myron Johnson, demographer. But, you know, the information flows upward and informs company strategy. That's why they have research.
Q. You're aware, aren't you, Dr. Kyriakoudes, that Philip Morris documents are available related to marketing from their marketing department?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
A. Yes. I mean, there are many, many documents
available by Philip Morris.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. And you can't identify today a single document created by anyone in Philip Morris' marketing department that discusses directing their marketing to individuals under the 18; isn't that correct?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
A. The documents I rely on are in essence -- I mean, demographers serve as marketers even if you're not in a marketing department. But demographic analysis is essential for understanding one's market. And in that regard, the work by Johnson informs that.
it's not significant to me that he isn't listed strictly in the marketing department because, I mean, the whole institution is geared towards either the manufacture or the marketing of the product. I mean, that's -- that's what cigarette manufacturers dedicated themselves to doing, those two business activities, at least in terms of what we're talking about here.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. what other opinions are you going to testify to in the Naugle case related to youth marketing?
A. I've described -- I've described my opinions fairly to you. That's it.
Q. This recruitment of younger smokers under the
205
age of 18 being essential to their business?
A. Yes. And that knowledge was widely known and that it helped shape industry activity.
Q. On what do you base your opinion that it helped shape industry activity?
A. Well, I mean, they're going out, they're doing marketing surveys, trying to understand the social science, the psychology of smoking, smoking initiation. They're identifying the manufacturer as a group.
They're identifying the importance of recruiting younger smokers to maintain the market. And that -- so that's -- that's what I focus on.
Q. Are you planning on giving an opinion in this case that any of Philip Morris' marketing activities had an impact on Lucinda Naugle?
A. Her as an individual distinct from the
population?
Q. Yes.
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
A. I don't have the evidence to single her out. I can only talk about, you know, her generation, her cohort, you know, groups of people. So the answer to that, given that qualification, would be, no. I'm not going to talk about her as an individual, distinct and separate from the general population of young women in
206
the 1950's and '60s.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Because you haven't read depositions in this case, I assume it's safe to assume that you are not going to testify about the vehicles by which Lucinda Naugle received information about the health risks of smoki ng?
A. Again, her as an individual?
Q. Yes.
A. No. My answer would be similar to the one that
I just gave earlier. I can only talk about groups and the national debate and the kinds of information that were circulating in the country.
Q. And specific to her, Dr. Kyriakoudes, you don't have any opinions as to anything that was published in the press or carried on television that have an impact one way or the other on Lucinda Naugle; correct?
MR. McPharlin: Objection to form. He's already testified that he's not offering a specific opi nion.
A. Yeah. I mean, my answer would be the same that I just gave in the two previous questions you just asked me. So I'd just refer to those two previous answers, it would be the same general position.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. I'm going to represent to you that Lucinda Naugle is, in fact, living. Okay. Can you accept that representation?
A. Yes.
Q. Knowing that Lucinda Naugle is a living plaintiff in this case, would it be relevant to your opinions to interview her?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
A. NO.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. So nothing Lucinda Naugle would have to say about what she knew or didn't know about the health risks of smoking would have any relevance to your opinions in this case?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
A. No. In my -- in this case I'm going to talk about the history of the tobacco industry and the elements that led to the creation of a cigarette culture, as I've described it many times today, and in prior testimony. So that's -- she can speak for herself.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Now, on the opinion you just said you're going to give, this generic opinion related to, I think, you
cigarette culture; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Will you be giving any different opinions on that topic than you have in previous trials, including Hess, Sherman, Barbanell?
A. No. No. My testimony -- I mean, my opinions have not changed. And so my testimony will be consistent with prior testimony.
Q. in the Barbanell case, Ms. Barbanell started smoking in the '50s; right?
A. I'm not recollecting exactly on that. If you're willing to represent that to me, I might accept that if you're willing to do that.
Q. She certainly wasn't a plaintiff who started smoking after the warnings went on cigarette packages; correct?
A. That may have been the case.
Q. You don't recall --
A. I don 11 recal1.
Q. -- Ms. Barbanell?
A. Yeah. But, I mean, you can get -- I think, you know, you can work on that and get -- I think I see where you want to go with that. So just, I mean --
Q. Well, Dr. Kyriakoudes, the question was, I was going to ask you is whether your opinions are any
209
different in the case of someone who started smoking years before warnings went on the cigarette packages versus somebody who started smoking years after the warnings went on the cigarette packages?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
A. Well, let's -- we're dealing with -- you know, if she started smoking around 1967, let's keep in mind we're dealing with year. So, you know, we don't want to -- we want to be precise on that. They actually appeared on the packs in '66. No. in this case there would be no difference in my opinions.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Okay. And just so we're clear,
Dr. Kyriakoudes, if, in fact, Lucinda Naugle testified that she started smoking in 1968, that would be years, plural, after the warnings went on the label; isn't that correct?
A. That would be the case. Yeah.
MR. McPharlin: Objection to form, it could be less than two years; right?
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Do you intend to talk in this case about the advertisement, a "Frank Statement", to cigarette smokers?
A. I might. I mean, I have in the past. I might
210
in this case, if I'm asked about it. Yes, I will talk about it. Yes.
Q. Do you have any information as to whether Ms. Naugle -- or excuse me, Ms. Naugle, ever saw the advertisement, a "Frank Statement" to cigarette smokers?
A. I don't know either way. And, you know, I didn't intend to offer an opinion on that.
Q. Do you know if the "Frank Statement" to cigarette smokers was an ad that was taken out in the Fort Lauderdale papers?
A. I'm not recollecting right now. I mean, there's a document that lists where it was placed in my reliance documents that I have to refresh my memory.
Q. So it may very well be the case that that advertisement didn't even run in the Fort Lauderdale papers; correct?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
A. it's possible.
MR. MCPHARLIN: You can answer.
A. it would run in other Florida papers, but of course it was discussed on television, it had multiple, multiple media exposure.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Now, we talked a little while ago about the supplement to your reliance list that's made up of Miami
Herald and Miami News articles; that's correct, right?
The supplement includes those?
A. Yes.
Q. when did you do that research?
A. Those are the same articles that were appended to my -- or included in my Barbanell exhibit list.
Q. Have you done any additional research into the Miami Herald or the Miami News since the Barbanell case?
A. No. I haven't had that opportunity.
Q. And your supplement of Miami Herald and Miami News articles ends in 1966; correct?
A. Yes. That's right.
Q. But based on my representation that Ms. Naugle started smoking in 1968, you haven't researched up to the time when she actually started smoking; correct?
A. No. No. I haven't seen the need to do that.
Q. Why did you supplement your reliance materials in this case with the Miami Herald and the Miami News arti cles?
A. Well, I -- you know, I just keep adding to my
reliance materials when I acquire new things. That's been my practice. And they kind of increase. And although I had given them over in the Barbanell, I mentioned it to Mr. McPharlin, just to make sure it's -like, for example, I didn't anticipate you would be back
212
here involved in this case. But you -- in the Barbanell case you had also been involved in that. So, in fact, you've been exposed to those materials. Just to kind of, you know, to make sure that I've given it over to you guys. Just, you know, to -- better to be, you know, to be sure than to overlook it.
Q. If I understand what you're saying,
Dr. Kyriakoudes, would it be fair to say that the Miami Herald and Miami News articles don't bear any specific relevance to the Naugle case?
A. No. No. They're just additional materials that I've acquired.
Q. Do you intend to provide any opinions in this case about Philip Morris USA's conduct that you have not
provided in prior Engle Progeny cases?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
A. No. I mean, including what we've discussed today, no. I anticipate my testimony will be consistent with what I've previously testified about.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. And that would be true for organizations such as the Council for Tobacco Research, the Tobacco industry Research Committee and the Tobacco institute; correct?
A. That's correct.
213
Q. You have no additional opinions on those organi zations?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
A. No. I mean, my position on those are well-known. I've testified in a large number of trials and I've been consistent, you know, in my evaluation of that.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. How many Engle Progeny trials have you testified in thus far?
A. Just Engle Progeny would be the Hess case, the Sherman case.
Q. It might help you. I know in Broward five.
And Barbanell is the fifth Engle Progeny case you testified in in Broward.
A. For Ferlanti, are you counting --Q. I'm counting Ferlanti.
A. There's some -- you know, I'm not qualified to judge whether that's an Engle Progeny case.
Q. I was counting that. I was counting Ferlanti.
A. Yes.
Q. However you label it. I was counting Ferlanti.
You testified in five trials in Broward; right?
A. That's right. And two in Escambia County.
Q. And do you know at this point what the total
number of cases is, Engle Progeny cases, are that you
A. I don't keep track of that. So I don't know.
MS. BROWN: if you give me a minute to take a break so I can skip through my outline, we are probably pretty close to wrapping this up.
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're off the video record. (Discussion off the record.) the VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the video record.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Now, Dr. Kyriakoudes, we just took a break for close to an hour so that you could print and review with Mr. McPharlin and Mr. Keane -MR. MCPHARLIN: It wasn't anywhere close to an
hour.
A. Maybe -- maybe 20 minutes at the most. That would be a generous -- I mean, not to disagree with you, but it hasn't been an hour.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. well, the record will reflect that we went off the record at 5:16 and it's now 6:05. But, anyway, so
that you could review the e-mails that you printed out with counsel in this case. Let me ask you first,
Dr. Kyriakoudes --
215
MR. KEANE: Wait. Wait. wait, we weren't reviewing e-mails that we printed out. we were -we were getting the rest of his e-mails that you asked for printed. He was sitting at a computer printing. We were at the copy machine copying.
That's what we've been doing.
MR. MCPHARLIN: The majority of the time was trying to get the e-mails. So your characterization is incorrect.
MR. KEANE: if you're concerned about somebody schooling him or counseling him or woodshedding him, none of that happened.
MS. BROWN: That was not my concern, Mr. Keane.
I'm really noting that it was a lengthy amount of time.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. And my question for you, Dr. Kyriakoudes, is you said prior to the deposition you had reviewed the duces tecum that was served in the Naugle case; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And did you talk with Mr. McPharlin about documents that you had that may be responsive to those requests?
A. Well, we went over the -- we went over the duces tecum and he mentioned that he was lodging
216
objections on certain items and advised me not to bring items to which they were lodging objections.
Q. And had Mr. McPharlin reviewed with you, in any detail, those documents to which he was lodging objections?
A. No. No. I mean, I had not supplied him any documents for his review. No.
Q. Okay. So these e-mails that you're about to produce were documents that you had not previously
discussed with Mr. McPharlin; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay.
MR. MCPHARLIN: He is producing them even though I maintain that they're totally irrelevant, they're personal e-mails which are none of your business. But it's his decision to do it. Not mine. So, I mean, if I were in his shoes, I wouldn't produce them. But that's what he's doing.
That is his decision not mine.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, when you came into the room, you were about to explain what these e-mails are as a category.
A. I went back to 2008 and at the beginning of 2008 and printed out all the e-mails, correspondence
217
between me and Robert Proctor.
Q. Okay. And included in this stack of e-mails are the two e-mails that we've discussed earlier that
Mr. McPharlin was maintaining an objection to; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. So there are no e-mails going back to 2008 between you and -- or Dr. Proctor which you are not producing right now?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay, if you go ahead and -A. Keeping in mind this doesn't include the ones that we discussed earlier this morning, just for precision sake.
Q. Okay. So the only ones missing from here, from this stack of communications you've had with Dr. Proctor going back to 2008 are those e-mails that you either already produced today or that we attached as exhibits from other depositions today; correct?
A. Or more specifically, the ones that you attached as exhibits.
Q. Okay.
MS. BROWN: So you brought multiple copies of this. So we can get one set marked and I can look
at a set; is that correct? Okay.
MR. KEANE: Trying to be helpful.
MS. BROWN: I appreciate that, Mr. Keane. I really do.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. And, Dr. Proctor, just so I understand how these are organized, you have pages that are going different directions. I assume that means that, for example, this two pages is one e-mail chain?
A. That's correct. So that you can understand the individual e-mails.
MS. BROWN: I'm going to go ahead and hand these to the court reporter.
(Naugle Exhibit Nos. 15 through 28 marked for identification.)
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Bear with me just one more second,
Dr. Kyriakoudes. I'm almost through the stack.
A. Don't feel rushed. I'm just leaning back to
relax.
MR. MCPHARLIN: why don't we start, you can ask him as you go.
MS. BROWN: Mr. McPharlin, you produced to me like 20 some pages of e-mails. I am going to take a few minutes to read them. This is my only chance to depose Dr. Kyriakoudes before we start trial next
219
week. Mr. McPharlin, did you, in fact, go attend another deposition this afternoon by phone?
MR. McPharlin: I'm not going to stay here all night. So let's get going.
MS. BROWN: Well, you're going to stay as long as it takes to complete, we could have been done a couple of hours ago but -MR. MCPHARLIN: That's not actually true.
MS. BROWN: Well, it is.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, we've marked everything that
you've produced to us as Naugle Exhibits 15 through 28. Okay. But I'm not going to ask you about every one of these e-mails, so I'm going to pick out the ones I have some questions about. Okay?
A. That's fine.
Q. I'm going to hand you what's been marked as Naugle Exhibit 18. Could you identify that for me, pi ease.
A. This is an e-mail dated Thursday,
February 12, 2009.
Q. And it's to whom from whom?
A. Oh, it's to me from Robert Proctor.
Q. And what does it say?
A. victory.
220
Q. with an exclamation mark?
A. That's right.
Q. And what is that in reference to?
A. Probably a -- I would guess a plaintiff's verdict. I think there was -- the Hess trial was
decided about that time.
Q. Now, I'm going to hand you what's been marked as Naugle 19. Can you identify that for me?
A. This is an e-mail, no subject, one message, February 12, 2009 from Robert Proctor to Louis Kyriakoudes with a link to a website.
Q. And do you know what that link -- you said to a website, but do you know more specifically what that link is to?
A. well, while I was printing out this e-mail just moments ago, I clicked on that link and it didn't bring anything up. it just said Associated Press and it said, you know, article not available or something like that.
Q. So it was an AP article, but it's no longer on the website?
A. Right.
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Okay. I'm going to hand you now what's been marked as Naugle 22. I want you to have a copy in front
of you. And I'd like one in front of me.
A. Thank you.
Q. Can you, please, identify what that is.
A. This is an e-mail from me to Robert Proctor dated Saturday, February 7, 2009. Subject, your cross, comma, attached.
Q. And what is the subject of this e-mail?
A. I read Robert Proctor's cross-examination.
This must have been the Hess trial. And I made some observations about it.
Q. is this the first time that you have reviewed Dr. Proctor's testimony and provided him feedback about that testimony?
A. Yeah. This is the first and only time I've done that.
Q. You said it's the only time you've done that?
A. That's right.
Q. Now, attached to this e-mail it shows two attachments at the bottom; correct?
A. That's right.
Q. And one says: Dr. Proctor -- Dr. Proctor, cross, it appears to be 2/3/09 would be the date of that cross; is that right?
A. That's right.
Q. in the body of the e-mail you note that you
222
have made comments or noted things in the cross in red font color; is that right?
A. That's what I said, yes.
Q. So I take it you printed this e-mail, but the attachment is still there. You could print the attachment as well?
A. Well, I tried. And something must have happened, it's only got one kilobyte file size, it wouldn't come up.
Q. What kinds of things do you recall noting in Dr. Proctor's Hess cross?
A. well, I think it's summarized in the -- in the body of the e-mail.
Q. Now, has Dr. Proctor reviewed your testimony and provided you feedback on that?
A. No. I don't think so. And I just want to be -- point out that there was something wrong with how I sent this e-mail. So I don't think he ever got the cross. There's something -- some problem happened with the file attachments. So the file never went to Robert.
But the -- of course, the text of the e-mail did.
Q. Did you and Dr. Proctor discuss this any further after you sent him this e-mail?
A. No. Because he couldn't -- he didn't get the actual noted cross. I don't believe I have that

anymore. But, no, we didn't talk about it.
Q. Did he ask you to look at his cross and give you -- give you -- give him your feedback?
A. No. I did that on my own.
Q. Have you done that for any other plaintiffs' experts who are testifying in the Engle Progeny litigation?
A. NO.
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I'm going to hand you what's been marked Naugle 23 and 25. Can you identify those for me, please.
A. Yeah. This is an e-mail to me from Robert Proctor to Louis Kyriakoudes, Friday, January 4, 2008.
And then my response right after that.
Q. And what was the subject of Dr. Proctor's e-mai1?
A. A colleague of ours had gotten a big promotion and it had made the news.
Q. And that's the news article that's attached?
A. That's correct. The colleague is a gentleman by the name of Alan Brant, a historian, and he was appointed, if I recall, I think it was dean of the graduate school at Harvard, it's a very prestigious job. And so that was big news and good news for Alan.
Q. Now, Dr. Kyriakoudes, I'm going to hand you
Naugle 24. Could you, please, identify this for me.
A. Okay. This is the most recent communication I've gotten from Dr. Proctor that came up earlier in the discussion. And it says: Another one. it's dated Thursday, October 15th. it's from Robert Proctor to me.
Q. What -- I'm sorry.
A. Sure. No, go ahead.
Q. what is the subject of this e-mail?
A. in the course of his research into the legacy tobacco documents database, he discovered approximately 15 years ago another historian that had served as an expert witness for the tobacco industry.
Q. And what is the purpose, as far as you understand, for sharing that information with you?
A. Well, as I said many times, he and I maintain a scholarly, and one can say even a journalistic research interest, in this particular topic of, you know, historians serving as expert witnesses for law firms defending the tobacco industry in these trials, we both published on that. And so that's -- that's a piece of historical research that he found and shared with me.
Q. Do you currently have any plans to author,
either on your own or in conjunction with Dr. Proctor, another article related to historians who testify as experts for the tobacco industry?
225
A. Right now I don't have those plans. No. I've written the piece that I wrote for tobacco control.
That's -- you know, that's that. I keep up, I'm interested, but right now I'm -- I don't have plans to go beyond that.
Q. And do you know whether Dr. Proctor is currently in the process of or has plans to write an article similar to that?
A. I don't know what his scholarly plans are.
Q. He hasn't shared that with you?
A. No.
Q. Okay. Now, I'm going to hand you what's been marked Naugle 26. If you could identify that for me.
A. This is an e-mail from Thursday,
February 14, 2008. It says: Caught another fish. And
it indicates, just like the previous e-mail, a document in the legacy tobacco documents database, historical database, indicating another person who was serving as an expert for the tobacco industry.
Q. Okay. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I'm going to hand you what's been marked Naugle 27. Can you, please, identify that?
A. it's -- it's an exchange of correspondence.
The first e-mail is from Robert Proctor to me dated Saturday, September 13, 2008. Then there's a follow-up
226
e-mail sent to me right after that. And then I reply the same day, Saturday, September 13th, to the document that he sent me that was in the tobacco industry database. Then the exchange goes on, 4:38, 5:05 and then 10:53 later that week in that thread of discussion.
Q. Okay. And, Dr. Kyriakoudes, if you go to your e-mail to Dr. Proctor dated Saturday, September 13th:
Hi, Robert. Wednesday went fine, what was Wednesday?
A. I believe -- I believe that was my first
deposition with Gary Paige.
Q. And when you say he's a greenhorn in this, who are you referring to?
A. Gary Paige. He had never -- I meant that only to mean that he had never done a tobacco case to me.
And if you can see what I say is, Paige was amazed that day -- referring of course to the people asking the questions at the deposition -- didn't ask me any questions about my opinions. So and then I say: He's a greenhorn -- a greenhorn in this because it's, in fact, often the case. You don't really ask me about my opi nions.
Q. Now, you also say: I taunted the RJR attorney and lectured him as to why, quote, difficult to quit is meaningless. Did I read that correctly?
A. Yes. You can go back and read the original
227
deposition and I guess get a fuller -- fuller view of that exchange. But you did read it correctly. Yeah.
Q. Do you believe that the role of an expert
witness in a deposition is to taunt the opposing counsel?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
Argumentative.
A. No. It's not my role. My role is to answer the questions posed to me. But it has been my experience that questions are often unfair, posed in ways that are designed to confuse the issues that are at hand. At least in tobacco litigation, my experience -you know, I mean, I can only talk about my experience, but rarely in this venue, in fact, have I been asked what I consider to be a question that is sought to determine what my opinions really were.
And so there was a long discussion between myself and whomever that was that was asking the questions, I can't exactly recall, about the difference between difficult to quit and addiction. And, you know, I kept answering the question and answering the question and it was -- we weren't getting anywhere. So that's how I recall that event. I would have to go back to the original document to fully flush that out, but you could
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. And that is your characterization of what you were doing, taunting the RJR attorney; correct?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
A. Yes. Because I thought a lot of his questions were unfair.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Okay. Now, if we look further in that e-mail chain, Dr. Kyriakoudes, please look with me at the e-mail dated Saturday, September 13, 2008 at 5:04 p.m.
A. Yes.
Q. This is another e-mail in the chain from you to Dr. Proctor; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And in it you say: Robert, this difficult to quit business is an old yarn, much like the awareness of the hazards of smoking without actually knowing that it
causes cancer, it muddles the issue. I give no ground on this one. How hard is difficult? Another case of setting the bar so low to allow the industry a pass for their murderous actions. Addiction is physical dependence and the public had almost no understanding of the issue at all until the very recent times. Even now the public fails to understand the addictive qualities of cigarettes. This is the end game of litigation and I
229
have no patience for these goons. I berate and lecture them -- I assume that's them and not then; right?
A. Yeah.
Q. I berate and lecture them as often at I can and will continue to do so. Best, Louis. Did I read that correctly?
A. Yes, you did.
Q. when you say this is the end game of litigation, what is the end game of litigation?
A. Oh, I think -- I think this is the end of tobacco litigation. I mean, this Engle Progeny issue
is -- is the end of tobacco litigation. I think after this passes, my own personal opinion, that there will not be any other significant liability risk to the tobacco industry in the United States in this kind of venue. That's what I mean by that.
Q. And on what do you base that opinion?
A. Just my opinion as a citizen, not as an expert opinion, it's not an expert. I mean, I don't predict the future of litigation. But just for me, just, you know, what I know as a general citizen.
Q. And why do you believe that this is it for tobacco litigation?
A. well, it's based on my personal experience, you know, when I started doing this, there was a lot of
230
tobacco litigation going on, or it seemed there was, it was in the news. And this was back in the late '90s.
And it kind of went on and then it pretty much stopped in 2005, at least from my personal experience. And I thought it had ended. You know, a lot of the issues
seemed to have kind of played themselves out. There was talk of a nicotine regulation bill. I mean, the one that ultimately was passed, but, you know, there was talk about that, you know, three years ago. So those kinds of things made me think that this is, you know -you know, I don't have predictive power, you know. But it just seemed to me this is the last bit of it.
Q. And what significance is there to you that this is the last bit of it for tobacco litigation?
A. No real significance. Just an observation.
You know -- you know, what are the -- that's it. Just, you know -- that's just -- this is the last -- you know, I mean, I might be wrong, you know. But, you know, at that time I felt like this was the last round of civil litigation risk that the tobacco industry would face. I mean, you're in a better position to assess that than I am because you see the whole forest. I just see the trees.
Q. Does the fact that you believe this is the last bit of tobacco litigation mean to you that this
litigation is of greater significance?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
A. Well, I don't know if it's of greater significance. It's coming to -- you know, it's coming to the end of these things. That was my opinion that I expressed back then. I had no idea that -- that what has transpired in the year since this e-mail was written, what happened in terms of the scale and scope of this. I really was completely unaware of that.
But -- and so in some ways, I'm erred on the side of miss -- under-appreciating what this phenomena has been. But, no. There's no special significance, it's just -it's just an observation.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. When you say you have no patience for these goons, who are you referring to as goons?
A. Oh, in this case I'm referring to the attorneys who have, you know, treated me the way you're treating me today for quite a long time. And this is not an easy
activity. Rarely, as these e-mails indicate, have you showed a sincere interest in my actual opinions and the methods and materials to support them. You're always interested in -- in other issues. And so that's what that means.
Q. And when you say the attorneys, you're talking
232
about the attorneys who represent the tobacco defendants in these cases; correct?
A. That's right.
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. And you go on to say: I berate and lecture them as often as I can and will continue to do so; correct?
A. That's correct. I did write that.
Q. And so that's how you approached testifying in this litigation?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
Mi scharacteri zation.
A. Well, again, I -- when asked, you know, fair and honest questions, I give -- you know, I will answer them to the best of my ability. But, you know, this was written after a deposition where the person asking me the questions, you know, was not interested in my opi nion.
He was interested in, you know, trying to get me to agree with his definition of the public's understanding of the risks of addiction in historical time. And, you know, you answer the question and then they ask the question again and again. And I answer.
And they ask it again and again. And when I don't give
233
an answer that seems to satisfy the person asking the question, they get agitated. They, you know -- you know, are persistent, you know, intimidating sometimes.
And so all I can do to get my opinions across in a fair way is say, look, you know, this is why I believe this and this is -- this is the issue and this is my opinion.
And if that's lecturing and berating, then sometimes I
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. And that's your intent; correct?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
A. Well, my intent is -- is to give the person that's asking the questions an understanding of what my opinions are and how I derive those opinions as a scholar. That's always my intent. But that's rarely your intent to ask. And when I say you, I mean defense attorneys. That's rarely their intent to understand actually what my -- my opinions are.
And I find that very, very dispiriting because, you know, the kind of fair aspect of people putting the evidence down -- you know, I give my direct testimony in a trial. Your person gives his or her direct testimony at trial. The jury is the decider. I really respect that. And a lot of this kind of manipulation in the deposition is, you know -- I'm the one that's berated,
so I berate back. I'm often the one that's lectured.
So I lecture back. And that's -- that's the environment I find myself in in depositions. And that's just a reality.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. So you believe that what should happen is you come to court and give your opinions, defendants' witnesses come to court and give their opinions, and then it's left in the jury's hands as to how to sort out those opinions; correct?
A. Well, yeah. I believe that the jury is the one that makes the decisions. They get -- I'm just one tiny piece of the puzzle. I don't -- I don't have the full view. The jury does. They sit through the whole trial.
I've never sat through an entire trial of any sort whatsoever. So I -- you know, I have one area that I am expert in and I talk about that. But it's up to the jury to decide whether -- you know, the outcome of the lawsuit. That's not mine. I would never presume to do that.
Again, I'm just one piece of a puzzle or one
portion of a picture. And so I have to say, I have found the experience of going through these depositions to be quite difficult and stressful and really at odds with what I think is a fair attempt to get at what the
235
objective bases of my opinions are. So if you're unhappy with that, I'm sorry. But that's -- that's how I see it. And that's been my experience.
Q. So, again, ideally the way you understand the process should work is that you do your research and form your opinions and present those to the jury and defendants' expert does his research, forms his opinions and presents those opinions to the jury and then the jury decides; correct? That's how the process should work?
MS. BROWN: We're going to be done in ten minutes. So if that is the kind of questions you want to ask, that's fine, we are going to be done in less than 15 minutes. If that is how you want to use your 15 minutes, fine.
A. Yes. I mean, I agree that's how the process should work with -- with the addition of, you know, everybody should have the opportunity to understand the evidentiary and intellectual and research basis of those opinions, you know, the methods, the materials that the various experts rely upon so that they can be evaluated by the other side, by -- you know, by people like you. That's -- you know, just add that part into it. That seems to me fair. That's how it seems to how I understand, in my layman's term, the way the civil
236
justice system should operate and largely in many ways does.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. And any efforts to interfere with that process of conducting the research and forming those opinions in order to present to the jury would really fall outside maintaining the integrity of that process; correct?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
A. Interfere? And what do you mean by interfere?
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. if someone engages in activity that frustrate or interfere with an expert's ability to complete his research and form his opinions, that is not a part of this process as you understand it or shouldn't be; correct?
A. You mean like -MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
A. -- holding a deposition in where I feel personally intimidated and feel the need, at significant personal expense, to hire an attorney to represent me so as to preserve my good name? Is that what you're referring to?
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, what I was referring to was any efforts to discourage research assistants of
defendant's experts from engaging in that research assi stance.
A. Well, I agree. I have never sought to contact, interfere or otherwise discourage research assistants. I've testified about that extensively. And there's an extensive record on that, we've seem to gone back to the subjects that were brought up this morning, which I thought we had wrapped up. But, no. I agree with you on that. I'm not interested in and have no desire to and have not ever interfered with anybody's ability to get their research done.
Q. Now, if we look further in this e-mail in response to your statements, Dr. Proctor responded on September 16th at 10:53 a.m.: Nice. I like it. Keep it up. Too few academics have anything like an actual backbone; correct?
A. Yeah. That's what he wrote.
Q. So you and Dr. Proctor kind of cheer each other on; is that correct?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
Argumentative.
A. No. I mean, that's -- he is just responding to the note that I wrote.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. You encourage each other in this litigation;
correct?
MR. McPharlin: Objection to form, vague.
A. what do you mean by encourage?
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. well, you provide support for each other and encouragement in this litigation; correct?
MR. McPharlin: Objection to form, vague.
A. well, I have a friendship with him, a professional relationship. I think we both believe in the value of what we do. we both think that we are doing the right thing in terms of our role in this litigation and in terms of the opinions. I mean, we don't -- we have differing areas of expertise, but we believe that our -- you know, that our opinions are correct, we disagree with the opinions of the testimony provided so far. Never say never, but at least up until this point by experts retained by the defense. So to
that regard, we have some common commonalities.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Now, Dr. Kyriakoudes, you testified before that you consider yourself to be an unbiased expert in this litigation; correct?
A. Oh, yes. I do. Yes. I mean, my -- my historical analysis, I think, is very unbiased.
Q. Do you consider use of terms like goons and
239
intent to berate and lecture opposing counsel, referring to defendants' conduct as murderous, are those -- is that language that an unbiased expert uses?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Object to the form.
A. Well, I am unbiased when it comes to the methods and materials, you know, the research conclusions, the opinions that I draw from the historical material. I mean, if you're going to say that I have a bias towards truth, towards openness and a bias towards life, I do have those biases. That's true.
I am biased in those ways.
I mean, let's not forget, this is a defendant -- your client, you know, is a defendant that in a federal court has been found to commit -- to have committed a deadly fraud. I mean, the toll of tobacco-related disease is -- is absolutely -- it's enormous. One out of five deaths this year in the United States will be due to the products or the types of products that your clients manufacture. That's -there's no question about that. Tobacco-related disease takes one in five people in the United States. One in ten globally. This is one of the most pressing public health issues around.
So if -- if you're going to take my values towards life, towards health, towards openness and
240
truth, I mean, the documentary record is unambiguous in terms of the behavior of your client.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Are you done?
A. Well, I'm -- you know, those are my -- I mean, if that's biased, I mean, how can you not come up with an alternative conclusion given the scope of research that I've done and the documents and the data that I've looked at.
MS. BROWN: Move to strike as non responsive.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, is it your intent at trial to work in, wherever you can, the Rico opinion of the federal court?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
A. Work in? what do you mean by that?
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Is it your intent to inject, when you get an opportunity in front of the jury, the Rico case?
MR. MCPHARLIN: We're done. Listen, if you are going to ask him questions like that at ten minutes to 7:00, we're done. Ask him questions about the documents that he produced. I'm serious. This is ridi culous .
MS. BROWN: Todd, you spent a good chunk of the
afternoon -MR. McPharlin: Listen, I'm not going to argue wi th you.
MS. BROWN -- attending a deposition in another case while we all sat here and waited.
MR. MCPHARLIN: while you went forward.
MS. BROWN: Huh?
MR. MCPHARLIN: while you went forward.
MS. BROWN: we didn't go forward because Mr. Paige was unable to stay on the phone.
MR. MCPHARLIN: Well, I wasn't aware that you weren't going forward. But, nevertheless, it's 10 minutes to 7:00. If you are going to ask him questions like that, we are going to finish, we are going to leave. So ask him about the documents that he's given you that he didn't have to give you in the first place. So ask him.
MS. BROWN: And I have been asking him and there is a question pending.
A. No. I've only -- I mean, when you asked me a question that's relevant to that issue, you know, I have to give a full and fair answer. You know, I don't intend to work in anything. I just answer the questions that are asked of me. That's true of cross-examination as wel1.
242
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Now, Dr. Proctor -- I mean, Dr. Kyriakoudes, earlier today you produced a few other e-mails and there was one I still had a question about.
A. Okay.
Q. But now we need to find the one -- I guess we marked these all as a composite exhibit. So I don't know how we're going to keep track of this now. it's Naugle Composite Exhibit No. 13, which is the e-mails that you produced earlier in the deposition. And there's an e-mail dated August 20, 2009 at 2:51 p.m. from Mr. McPharlin to you. And it says: When is a good time to talk? it says: I have the other matter
resolved. Do you know what the other matter is?
MR. McPharlin: Asked and answered. Objection.
A long time ago.
MS. BROWN: No. I don't think we've asked the Doctor that question.
MR. MCPHARLIN: Yeah, you have.
BY MS. JONES:
Q. Well, then I apologize, Dr. Kyriakoudes. I must have forgotten your response to that question. Do you mind reminding me.
A. I can't remember what that referred to, I'm sorry.
243
Q. Okay.
MR. MCPHARLIN: That is what he told you before.
MS. BROWN: it must have been the huge gaps in the deposition that caused me to forget it.
MR. KEANE: You're doing good though.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Okay. Just to wrap a few more things up. One thing, as far as health textbooks, have you done any research on health textbooks that would have been used in the schools attended by Ms. Naugle?
A. Again, I don't know what schools she went to.
So although I've done a lot of research in health textbooks, I can't make a connection between what I looked at and what was assigned at her school district.
Q. Have you formed any opinions as to what health textbooks were used in the Fort Lauderdale area in the late '50s, early/mid '60s?
A. No.
Q. Do you see, as part of your opinions that you plan to offer in this case, an opinion as to the information environment Ms. Naugle finds herself in as a smoker in the -- starting in 1968?
A. Yeah. I've heard that term used and have been asked about that term. I don't anticipate talking about
that in that way. I think it's kind of a -- there's vagueness attached to that that I don't feel comfortable with. No. I will talk about what appeared in national media and what, you know -- what composed or compromised the content of the smoking and health debate at the relevant times.
Q. Do you think an important piece of understanding what information Lucinda Naugle may have been exposed to, facts related to what she was told by her friends, her family, her doctors, about the risk of cigarette smoking?
A. well, I'm not going to offer opinions about what she herself knew. So that wouldn't be relevant to my analysis in this case. I intend to offer, you know, broader opinions about the historical context of the rise of the cigarette and the broad patterns of public knowledge and understanding and the broad patterns of information. So that's not important -- or that's not relevant to my opinions in this case.
Q. Now, earlier we had talked about the fact that at some point in time you had retained Chris Carlisle as
your attorney; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And was Chris Carlisle the first attorney that you retained to represent you personally in this
245
litigation?
MR. MCPHARLIN: We're not doing that. It's 7:00. You're asking him about -- ask him about his opinions in this case. This is the Naugle case, remember? Ask him about his opinions. Not about that. So I'm moving for protective order on that question. If you don't have another question, then we can pack up and go. But I'm moving for protective order on that at five minutes to 7:00.
MS. BROWN: So you're instructing him not to answer any questions related to whether Mr. Carlisle was the first attorney he retained?
MR. MCPHARLIN: I'm moving for protective order. I'm asking Dr. Kyriakoudes not to respond to that question because it's harassing at this point.
It has nothing to do with this case. It certainly has more to do with the two hours that you had before. Nothing to do with Naugle.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, who referred you to Mr. Keane for representation?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Don't answer that. I am moving for protective order.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, are you paying Mr. Keane's
246
fees or is someone paying Mr. Keane's fees on your behalf?
MR. MCPHARLIN: Don't answer that. I'll move for a protective order.
MS. BROWN: So, Todd, when you say you're moving for a protective order, is that something you'll view -MR. MCPHARLIN: That means I will file the
motion -- that means I file a motion with the judge for a protective order on these questions.
MS. BROWN: Okay, we'll leave the deposition open until you file and get that motion.
MR. MCPHARLIN: Ask your questions.
MS. BROWN: That is what I am doing, but I first want to clarify.
MR. KEANE: I will solve that for you. He's paying me. No one else is paying me. Okay, it's none of your business. But there it is. So let's go. Move on. If I had a third-party payor, there would be a written agreement. And if and when there came a time you were entitled to see it, you could see it. But there isn't. He's my client. He's paying me. Okay.
MS. BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Keane.
BY MS. BROWN:
Q. You agree with Mr. Keane's answer,
Dr. Kyriakoudes?
A. Yes. I'm paying him.
MS. BROWN: I think that's all the questions that I have.
MR. KEANE: He'll read.
