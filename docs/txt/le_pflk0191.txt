8	a witness called for examination by counsel for
9	the Plaintiff, being first duly sworn, was
10	examined and testified as follows:
12	DIRECT EXAMINATION
13	BY MR. WICHMANN:
14	Q. Please tell us your name.
15	A. My name is Janette Thomas Greenwood.
16	Q. And what is your current business
17	address?
18	A. I teach at Clark University,
19	Department of History, 950 Main Street,
20	Worcester, Massachusetts 01610.
21	Q. Doctor, I know you have had your
22	deposition taken before, correct?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. Have you ever had your deposition
0006
1	taken by VTC, the manner in which we are doing
2	it now?
3	A. No, I have not.
4	Q. The rules are simple but a bit
5	different.
6	There may be a lag between my question
7	and your answer because of the technology.
8	Could you bear with us if that's the case?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. Please, the rules in a VTC deposition
11	are the same as the other depositions that you
12	gave, and that is if I ask a question that you
13	do not understand, please let us know so that we
14	can rephrase it. Okay?
15	A. Okay. Sure.
16	Q. Ma'am, have you been hired as an
17	expert witness in the case of Pamela Ciccone
18	versus R.J. Reynolds?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Have you received a copy of the notice
21	of deposition that was filed to bring you here
22	today?
23	A. Yes, I have.
24	Q. Now, I received in my office a large
0007
1	box of material courtesy of the R.J. Reynolds
2	lawyer that included tapes, disks and a hard
3	drive.
4	Are you aware of that?
5	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
6	Go ahead and answer.
7	A. I'm aware that you had asked for the
8	basis of some -- the materials that I used as
9	the base of my report. That's about all I know.
10	Q. Did you provide that information that
11	I received in the box to the lawyers for R.J.
12	Reynolds?
13	MS. LAWSON: Object to the form.
14	BY MR. WICHMANN:
15	Q. To the best of your knowledge?
16	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
17	A. Again, I know that you asked for the
18	materials, and I was told that they were being
19	given to you, so that's about all I know.
20	Q. Well, you do know that you produced a
21	Janette T. Greenwood resource list that is
22	marked as an exhibit to this deposition,
23	correct?
24	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
0008
1	You can answer.
2	A. I know I have a resource list that
3	contains the materials that I have researched
4	and used as a basis for my conclusions.
5	Q. Is that document marked as an exhibit
6	to this deposition?
7	A. Yes. It is marked as Exhibit Number
8	1.
9	Q. Does that document list all of the
10	material that you have relied upon to reach your
11	opinions in this case?
12	A. As far as I know, yes.
13	Q. Have you reached your final opinions
14	in this case?
15	A. Yes, I have.
16	Q. Have you written those opinions down
17	in the form of a report?
18	A. No, I have not.
19	Q. Do you have any notes that you have
20	written that went into the formulation of your
21	final opinion in this case?
22	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
23	Mr. Wichmann, we're getting some noise
24	on the line, and could we ask whoever's talking
0009
1	to put the mute button on so we don't hear it on
2	the conference.
3	MR. WICHMANN: I'm all alone, it's
4	not happening on my end.
5	MS. LAWSON: It's happening
6	somewhere else. It's here. Someone else is on
7	the line that's apparently making noise, and
8	we're hearing that here, and it's making it
9	difficult to understand you.
10	BY MR. WICHMANN:
11	Q. Did you understand my last question,
12	ma'am?
13	A. I'd like you to repeat it, please.
14	MR. WICHMANN: I'd like the court
15	reporter to read it back, please.
16	(Record read)
17	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
18	A. As I understand it, any notes that I
19	have I've already given to my attorneys, and
20	they've passed on to you.
21	I had a few notes regarding the
22	chronology of Mr. Ciccone's residency, and I
23	think that's pretty much it.
24	Q. When you say "my attorneys," you mean
0010
1	the attorneys for RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company,
2	correct?
3	A. Yes, that's what I meant.
4	Q. When you say "residency," ma'am, you
5	are not going to testify at trial as to whether
6	or not George Ciccone was a Florida resident
7	during the Engle class membership period, are
8	you?
9	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
10	A. I've been asked to determine a very
11	specific question, which was public awareness
12	regarding issues of smoking and health as well
13	as addiction, and so that is what I will be
14	testifying to.
15	Q. So the answer to my previous question
16	is no?
17	MS. LAWSON: Same objection.
18	A. Again, I'm testifying as a historian,
19	as an expert witness regarding public awareness.
20	MR. WICHMANN: Madam court
21	reporter, would you please read back that
22	question that I asked the doctor about
23	residency, her opinions regarding Engle class
24	membership, please.
0011
1	(Record read)
2	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
3	BY MR. WICHMANN:
4	Q. Simple answer, can you give me a
5	yes-or-no answer?
6	A. No, I'm not talking about his specific
7	residency. I'm talking about public awareness.
8	Q. Thank you, Doctor.
9	Again, if my questions are not clear,
10	please feel free to let me know that, and I will
11	try my best to rephrase them.
12	A. Okay.
13	Q. Are you ready to proceed?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. Did you play any part in preparing the
16	expert witness disclosure that was filed in this
17	case?
18	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
19	A. I guess I would just like to ask what
20	you mean by "play a part." Could you define
21	that for me, please?
22	Q. Sure.
23	Is there a document marked as an
24	exhibit to this deposition provided to you by
0012
1	R.J. Reynolds' lawyers that is a disclosure of
2	your opinions?
3	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
4	A. I have an exhibit in front of me
5	that's marked Exhibit 3 that talks about my
6	background and what I'm expected to testify.
7	Q. Have you seen that document before
8	coming down for this deposition today?
9	A. Yes, I have.
10	Q. When did you first see that document?
11	A. I don't recall exactly.
12	Q. Was it prepared by the law firm that
13	retained you as an expert in this case?
14	A. I don't know.
15	Q. Do you know which law firm retained
16	you as an expert in this case?
17	A. Chook, Hardy & Bacon were the first
18	people who contacted me about getting involved
19	in this case.
20	Q. They are no longer involved in this
21	case, are they, Doctor?
22	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
23	A. I'm not sure.
24	Q. What part, if any, did you play in
0013
1	providing the information that is contained in
2	the expert witness disclosure marked as
3	Exhibit 3 to this deposition?
4	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
5	A. Well, I certainly would have provided
6	information regarding my background, my degrees,
7	my teaching awards.
8	And in terms of my conclusions
9	regarding public awareness, I certainly would
10	have passed on that information to them for this
11	particular report.
12	Q. Okay. Directing your attention to
13	Exhibit 3, Doctor, the expert witness
14	disclosure. Would you look, please, at the
15	first paragraph.
16	A. Okay.
17	Q. Would you give us briefly the benefit
18	of your educational background?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you mean
21	by "benefit." I'm not sure what you're asking.
22	Q. Ma'am, let me ask it to you in simple
23	terms.
24	A. Thank you.
0014
1	Q. Is paragraph one of the expert witness
2	disclosure marked Exhibit Number 3 accurate in
3	terms of your educational background?
4	A. Okay. Well, I understand that
5	question.
6	Just give me a moment here to read it
7	just to make sure it's accurate.
8	(Pause)
9	A. Yes, it seems accurate to me.
10	Q. Do you in addition to that information
11	have a current CV ?
12	A. Yes, I do.
13	Q. Is your most current CV marked as an
14	exhibit for this deposition?
15	A. It is marked as Exhibit Number 2.
16	Q. Is that your most current version?
17	A. Let me just look at it again to make
18	sure.
19	(Pause)
20	A. Yes, this is my most current version.
21	Q. Moving right along, Doctor, these
22	should be pretty simple questions, but if they
23	come at you too fast, let me know.
24	Is it fair to say that you're working
0015
1	now as a professor at Clark College?
2	A. No, I'm a professor at Clark
3	University.
4	Q. I stand corrected. Thank you.
5	I reviewed your CV, and it says you
6	are affiliated with the women's studies and race
7	and ethnic studies programs, correct?
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. You would agree, would you not, that
10	George Ciccone was a man?
11	A. As far as I know, yes.
12	Q. Okay. What, if anything, do women's
13	studies have to do with your opinions in this
14	case?
15	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
16	A. Sir, I've been asked to research a
17	particular question regarding public awareness.
18	I'm trained as a social historian. I have a
19	Ph.D. in US social history is my major field. I
20	teach historical methods. My research is,
21	again, largely in social history.
22	Most historians have specializations.
23	Mine happens to be in the history of the
24	American South, as part of that study issues of
0016
1	race.
2	Women and gender studies, I should
3	point out, includes men as well as women, and
4	it's one particular way of looking at the past.
5	I would say, again, my training as a
6	social historian, again, with a doctorate in
7	that particular field of study is what I believe
8	best prepares me as an expert witness in this
9	case.
10	MR. WICHMANN: Madam court
11	reporter, could you read back my question,
12	please?
13	(Record read)
14	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
15	BY MR. WICHMANN:
16	Q. That question is meant to be specific,
17	not general.
18	Specifically as to the George Ciccone
19	case, could you tell me what effect, if any,
20	women's studies and race and ethnic studies had
21	on your final opinions in the case?
22	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
23	A. Again, those are particular subfields
24	in this larger field of history as a discipline.
0017
1	I would say, though, that both of
2	those subfields of historical study still adhere
3	to the same rules of historical inquiry as any
4	other study of history, whether it be diplomatic
5	history, presidential history, military history.
6	They also go by, they meaning women
7	and gender studies, as well as race and ethnic
8	studies, adhere to the same standards of
9	historical inquiry in terms of framing a
10	question, in terms of the way one proceeds with
11	research in terms of the way one weighs
12	evidence, in terms of the way one draws
13	conclusions.
14	So in that sense it is related as the
15	practice of historical method.
16	Q. I'm sorry, I don't mean to talk over
17	you. Are you finished?
18	A. Yes, I am.
19	Q. Okay. My simple question to you is is
20	that the only relation that women's studies,
21	race and ethnic studies have to your opinions in
22	the Ciccone case?
23	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
24	A. Again, only -- you know, certainly my
0018
1	general knowledge of history that I may have
2	developed through looking at some of those
3	subfields, my general understanding of
4	chronology of American history were probably
5	influenced by readings that I've done in these
6	particular fields.
7	So, again, I stand by my original
8	answer that it's a subfield of history and
9	historical knowledge.
10	Q. Well, we lawyers always try to be
11	specific.
12	I read over your CV. It's always
13	difficult to characterize someone's professional
14	specialty, but would you agree that the focus of
15	your teaching, articles, books, and
16	presentations has been the American South and
17	race and ethnicity in the American South? Is
18	that a fair statement?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. I don't think it is quite a fair
21	statement, sir.
22	If you look at my teaching fields,
23	again, US social history is first. The
24	historical discipline, like every other
0019
1	profession, requires specialization.
2	In terms of my own -- much of my
3	research and writing, the focus has been on the
4	American South and race relations. But, again,
5	one can't teach or write about that particular
6	field without having a much larger kind of
7	specialization in American history, and in my
8	case, US social history.
9	If you look at the courses I teach,
10	which, again, is on page one of Exhibit 2, you
11	can see that I teach at a university. We have a
12	reasonably small sized department. We don't
13	teach in our specialty alone. I teach a number
14	of broad courses in US history, including US
15	history since 1865, a course I'm teaching this
16	semester. I teach graduate courses that are
17	much broader. I teach other areas in fields.
18	Baseball in American society, for example, is
19	another one of my courses.
20	So I do teach quite broadly, and so I
21	don't accept your characterization of me as only
22	being someone who knows about race and ethnic
23	relations or southern history.
24	Q. Have you ever taught a course
0020
1	regarding historical smoking behavior?
2	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
3	A. No, I haven't.
4	Q. Ma'am, I looked at many of your
5	publications here. You wrote a book called
6	first Fruits of Freedom: The Migration of
7	Former Slaves and Their Search For Equality in
8	Worcester, Massachusetts, correct?
9	A. Yes, I have written that book.
10	Q. Did I pronounce Worcester correct?
11	A. You did a very good job with that.
12	Thank you. Most people don't.
13	Q. You're welcome.
14	And your first book was called the
15	Bittersweet Legacy, and it concerned the
16	interaction of black and white middle class ina
17	new south city, is that fair to say?
18	A. Yeah. Actually, I prefer the term
19	better classes rather than middle class, but,
20	yeah, you're close.
21	Q. Okay. You also wrote a book called
22	Southern Black Migration and Community Building
23	in the Era of the Civil War. Or I should say
24	you authored a publication, correct?
0021
1	A. Yes. That was a chapter, an article
2	in a book.
3	Q. Okay. How about this Gilded Age: A
4	History in Documents, where did that come from?
5	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
6	A. I'm sorry, where did it come from?
7	Could you explain, please, what you're asking
8	exactly.
9	Q. Was that a chapter in a book, a book?
10	What was it?
11	A. It's a book. It's a documents book.
12	It's an edited documents book where I chose
13	primary sources from The Gilded Age, a variety
14	of sources, and introduced each one of them for
15	Oxford.
16	Q. Were all those publications peer
17	reviewed?
18	A. Certainly First Fruits of Freedom,
19	Bittersweet Legacy and Gilded Age was peer
20	reviewed. I'm not sure about -- well, all of
21	the ones that you mention, yes, they were.
22	Q. And what in your field does peer
23	reviewed mean?
24	A. It means that your publications,
0022
1	something you submitted for publication is given
2	out to some other person in your field, an
3	expert in your field.
4	It's usually what we call a blind
5	review. You don't know who's doing the
6	reviewing for either the press or the
7	publications that you submitted the particular
8	manuscript to.
9	And then they give their particular
10	feedback on the manuscript, whether they feel it
11	should be published or not.
12	Q. Is that important to have publications
13	peer reviewed in your field of expertise?
14	A. Yes, it is.
15	The expectation for one to get tenure
16	and promotion is certainly related to one's
17	peer-reviewed publications.
18	Q. So to your credit, ma'am, you have
19	authored publications that have been published
20	and they have been peer reviewed, correct?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Can you tell me one -- can you give me
23	one book, one article or one publication that
24	you have authored that deals with the subiect of
0023
1	tobacco?
2	A. Well, now that I think about it,
3	Bittersweet Legacy, it's about North Carolina.
4	I think there is maybe -- as I recall, I wrote
5	the book in 1994. There is some discussion
6	about tobacco culture. Charlotte was in the
7	midst of the textile cotton belt. There may be
8	some reference there to tobacco.
9	Q. Aside from that publication, have you
10	written anything else dealing with the subject
11	of tobacco generally?
12	A. No, I have not.
13	Q. Did that chapter in that book that you
14	just referred to have to do with smoking
15	behavior in the United States?
16	A. No.
17	Q. Have you ever written anything on
18	smoking behavior in the United States?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. Anything meaning expert witness
21	reports?
22	Q. Anything published.
23	A. No, I have not.
24	Q. So obviously nothing peer reviewed
0024
1	either, correct?
2	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
3	A. No, not on the topic of tobacco.
4	Q. Okay. Outside -- I'm sorry. I didn't
5	mean to cut you off again.
6	A. No, you didn't.
7	Q. Outside of the work that you have done
8	for the law firms for the tobacco companies,
9	have you given any presentations anywhere
10	regarding smoking behavior in the United States?
11	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
12	A. No, I have not.
13	Q. Other than the work you have done for
14	the law firms and the tobacco companies, have
15	you ever held yourself out as an expert
16	historian on the subject of smoking behavior in
17	the United States?
18	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
19	A. I'm not sure what you mean by hold
20	myself out.
21	I'm a social historian. I've been
22	asked to answer this question about public
23	awareness regarding smoking and health and
24	addiction.
0025
1	And as a social historian, one who has
2	published and peer reviewed publications and
3	articles, I have answered that question, again,
4	as someone who has a doctorate in social
5	history.
6	Q. Let me ask the question to you another
7	way.
8	Your CV is attached as an exhibit to
9	this deposition; is it not?
10	A. Yes, it is.
11	Q. Is there anywhere on your CV where you
12	claim to be an expert in the history of tobacco
13	use in the United States?
14	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
15	A. No, there is nothing specific on my
16	CV. I do claim to have a Ph.D. in social
17	history -- US social history, excuse me.
18	Q. Ma'am, do you claim to be an expert on
19	public opinion surveys and statistical analysis?
20	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
21	A. No.
22	Q. Is it fair to say that you are not
23	going to give any opinions in the Ciccone case
24	concerning public opinion surveys or statistical
0026
1	analysis?
2	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
3	A. I do know that if polls; for example,
4	Gallup polls, I do know that if a Gallup poll
5	appeared in a newspaper, again, that would have
6	been regarding issues of smoking and health,
7	that would have been information I would
8	include, have included, I should say, on my
9	resource list and would, you know, feed into,
10	again, be part of this large body of information
11	that I've researched in order to draw my
12	conclusions.
13	Q. Aside from that Gallup poll you just
14	referred to, are you going to give any opinions
15	on any other public opinion surveys in this
16	case?
17	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
18	A. No, I'm not.
19	Q. Are you going to give any opinions
20	concerning statistics and an analysis of
21	statistics in this case?
22	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
23	A. Again, just to be clear, I want to say
24	that there are, for example, health textbooks
0027
1	that I've looked at that talk about lung cancer
2	statistics amongst smokers.
3	Again, that would be, again, from my
4	perspective as a social historian, someone who's
5	been asked to determine public awareness, that
6	kind of statistical information is part of my
7	resource base upon which I'm drawing my
8	conclusions.
9	Q. You don't hold yourself out as an
10	economist, do you, ma'am?
11	A. No, I'm not.
12	Q. That's a separate area of expertise,
13	and that will be a separate expert in this case,
14	correct?
15	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
16	A. I don't know who the other experts
17	are, but I am not an economist, and I will not
18	be talking about -- holding myself out, as you
19	put it, as an expert economist.
20	Q. Do you have a colleague named
21	Dr. Richard Seltzer?
22	A. I don't know Dr. Richard Seltzer.
23	Q. Okay, fine.
24	Ma'am, we asked earlier about
0028
1	articles, and you told us you had never written
2	an article on the history of smoking or
3	historical smoking behavior.
4	My question is aside from the work
5	that you've done in this case, have you done any
6	research into historical smoking behavior?
7	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
8	A. In addition to this case, have I done
9	research, is that your question? I just want to
10	be sure I understand the question.
11	Q. Let me rephrase the question, please.
12	A. Thank you.
13	Q. This is not the first tobacco case
14	that you have participated in, correct?
15	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
16	A. I have been an expert witness for
17	other cases, that's true, yes.
18	Q. In how many other cases have you been
19	an expert witness for the tobacco companies?
20	A. I have been -- are you asking me
21	about -- again, I just want to make sure that
22	I'm answering the question correctly or
23	answering what you're asking is what I'm trying
24	to say.
0029
1	Are you asking me cases that I have
2	been deposed in where I've actually been cited
3	already as an expert witness?
4	I'm not sure -- would you please just
5	repeat the question? That would be the easiest
6	thing.
7	MR. WICHMANN: Madam court
8	reporter, could you read the question back,
9	please?
10	(Record read)
11	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
12	A. Again, I've been an expert witness.
13	I've been asked as a historian to be --1
14	haven't been hired directly by the tobacco
15	companies. I think that's an important
16	distinction.
17	I have been involved in -- I've been
18	an expert witness in, I guess, three other cases
19	to this point, three or four other cases.
20	Q. All testifying on behalf of the
21	defendant tobacco companies, correct?
22	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
23	A. Again, I've been asked as an expert
24	witness to give my findings regarding smoking
0030
1	and health addiction, and I've been an expert
2	witness in that particular way.
3	Q. An expert witness for the tobacco
4	companies as opposed to the cigarette smoking
5	victims, correct?
6	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
7	A. I have testified, or I have not
8	testified yet, I have been hired as an expert
9	witness to determine the level of public
10	awareness regarding these issues in three or
11	four cases. And I have not testified on behalf
12	of the plaintiff in these cases.
13	Q. You've always been hired, in your
14	mind, by a law firm, correct?
15	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
16	BY MR. WICHMANN:
17	Q. Is that your testimony?
18	(Pause)
19	Q. Did you hear my question, ma'am?
20	A. Yes. May I have a few minutes or
21	seconds here to answer?
22	Q. Sure.
23	A. Thank you.
24	I have been approached by attorneys
0031
1	from time to time in different situations to
2	serve as an expert witness regarding my
3	assessment of public awareness regarding smoking
4	and health.
5	I don't think I've ever been directly
6	contacted by a tobacco company. I know I've
7	never been directly contacted by a tobacco
8	company.
9	Q. We'll get to that in a second. I just
10	wanted to clearly understand what you perceive
11	your role in this case as being.
12	Do you perceive -- do you believe in
13	your mind that you're hired by a law firm that
14	represents the tobacco companies? Simple
15	question, yes or no.
16	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
17	A. I have been asked to address a very
18	particular kind of question, and I have pursued
19	that question, as I would any other question, as
20	a social historian.
21	And I've been asked, again, to do the
22	research, to come up with expert findings and
23	conclusions based on the question that I've been
24	asked to research.
0032
1	Q. Well, let me make it easy for you.
2	Someone's paying for your time today, correct?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. That would be me, right?
5	A. No.
6	Q. I'm paying for your time during the
7	deposition. Do you understand that?
8	A. Honestly, I don't. I just know that I
9	keep track of my hours, and I'm paid for my
10	research and my work.
11	Q. Earlier you referred to, quote,
12	unquote, my lawyers. Do you recall that
13	statement?
14	A. Yes.
15	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
16	A. Again, I corrected myself on that.
17	It's not what I clearly meant. I didn't imply
18	that they were my personal lawyers. I meant the
19	lawyers that I've been working -- have asked me
20	to do this kind of research for them.
21	Q. Okay. And in this case, the George
22	Ciccone case, who are the lawyers that have
23	asked you to do the work?
24	A. Again, I was first approached to do
0033
1	the work in this case, to, again, do research on
2	this question of public awareness by Lori
3	McGroder at Chook, Hardy & Bacon.
4	Q. At the time you were first approached
5	by her, who did you understand that firm to be
6	representing?
7	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
8	A. I wasn't sure who specifically they
9	were representing, which companies. I didn't
10	know.
11	Q. But you knew they were representing a
12	tobacco company, correct?
13	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
14	A. I assumed that they were.
15	Q. And who do you believe that you're
16	working for currently in the Ciccone case?
17	A. Again, I don't see myself as working
18	for someone. I see myself as an expert witness
19	brought in to do research, to do this
20	objectively, to approach this particular topic
21	as I would any other historical topic and to
22	draw my conclusions and to present my findings.
23	Q. Which law firm are you working with as
24	you sit here today?
0034
1	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
2	BY MR. WICHMANN:
3	Q. In the George Ciccone case?
4	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
5	A. Again, I've been asked to be an expert
6	witness, again, as I've said several times
7	already, on the issue of public awareness as a
8	social historian.
9	Again, I've worked --1 was contacted
10	by Chook, Hardy & Bacon to do this work. I was
11	asked by them if I would, you know, pursue this
12	question.
13	Q. At some point in time were you
14	contacted by another law firm, a different law
15	firm than Chook, Hardy & Bacon to participate in
16	the George Ciccone case?
17	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
18	A. No. I -- again, Lori McGroder was the
19	person who asked me to do this. She's the
20	person who I submitted my expert findings to.
21	Q. When was the last time you had a
22	conversation with any lawyer concerning the
23	George Ciccone case before today?
24	A. I had spoken with --1 had a brief
0035
1	meeting yesterday.
2	Q. And who did you have a brief meeting
3	with?
4	A. With Christine Lawson.
5	Q. And who is she?
6	A. She's an attorney with Jones Day.
7	Q. When did you understand that Jones day
8	as opposed to Chook Hardy were involved in the
9	case?
10	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
11	A. Again, it really hasn't been my
12	concern.
13	I really as an expert witness here
14	focused on my questions, my research, drawing my
15	conclusions. That's really what my focus has
16	been.
17	Q. Well, simple question for you, and
18	we'll move on, and the simple question is can
19	you tell me as you sit here today which side of
20	the case you're going to testify for, the
21	plaintiff, Pamela Ciccone, or the defendants,
22	R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?
23	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
24	A. Again, as I see my role, I am not
0036
1	testifying for or against anyone.
2	I feel like my research is objective,
3	that my findings and conclusions stand on their
4	own, and it will ultimately be up to a jury to
5	determine, you know, what they believe in the
6	end.
7	Q. Who have been submitting your bills
8	to?
9	A. I send my bills to Lori McGroder.
10	Q. When did you send Lori McGroder your
11	last bill?
12	A. Probably March 1 st.
13	Q. Of which year?
14	A. Of this past year, 2011.
15	Q. And have you been paid on that
16	billing?
17	A. Not yet, no.
18	Q. Have you been paid any money to date
19	in this case for your work?
20	A. Yes, I have.
21	Q. How much have you been paid to date
22	for your work in the George Ciccone case?
23	A. I'd have to give you a rough estimate.
24	I would guess around between 15 and $20,000.
0037
1	Q. Can you tell me how much you have been
2	paid total, in total for all the work you've
3	done as an expert witness in a tobacco-related
4	case to date?
5	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
6	A. Again, I'd have to give you a pretty
7	rough estimate.
8	Q. I'll take it.
9	A. I'm guessing around $200,000.
10	Q. For how many years have you been doing
11	this work?
12	A. I first started in the spring of 2005.
13	Q. And how much are you charging for your
14	work in the Ciccone case?
15	A. I charge $200 an hour for research and
16	$275 an hour for depositions.
17	Q. Can you tell me how many hours you
18	have spent to date on this case?
19	A. To date, I'm sorry, did you say to
20	date on this case?
21	Q. Yes, to date, as of today.
22	A. Okay. I can't always hear very
23	clearly.
24	That's a good question. Let's see.
0038
1	I'm guessing between 20 and 30 hours.
2	Q. Have you ever testified in court?
3	A. No, I have not.
4	Q. You have given depositions before,
5	correct?
6	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
7	A. I've been deposed once.
8	Q. And that is the light cigarette case
9	in St. Louis, correct?
10	A. It's the Kraft case. It's a Missouri
11	class action case.
12	Q. Aside from the Kraft case and this
13	case, have you testified in deposition in any
14	other case?
15	A. No.
16	Q. So is it fair to say that for the
17	Ciccone case and the Kraft case, your total
18	income to date has been approximately $200,000?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. I'm sorry, would you repeat the
21	question?
22	MR. WICHMANN: Madam court
23	reporter, could you read that back?
24	(Record read)
0039
1	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
2	A. No.
3	Q. Are there other cases that I'm
4	missing?
5	A. Yes. I mentioned I think earlier this
6	morning that I have been working on several
7	other cases.
8	Q. Can you tell me as you sit here today
9	which cases? What are those cases?
10	MS. LAWSON: Counsel, I'm going to
11	object to the extent that she hasn't been
12	disclosed as an expert in those cases.
13	When she's not been disclosed, she is
14	still a consulting expert, and I believe there's
15	a work product privilege. But to the extent
16	she's aware she's been disclosed, and she can go
17	ahead and respond.
18	A. To the best of my knowledge, I've been
19	disclosed in the Haglan case which is here in
20	Massachusetts and the Donovan case which is also
21	a Massachusetts case.
22	Q. To your knowledge have you been
23	disclosed as an expert witness by the tobacco
24	companies in any case in Florida other than
0040
1	Ciccone?
2	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
3	A. Have I been disclosed?
4	Q. Correct.
5	A. I'm not sure. I hesitate to say just
6	because I'm not sure.
7	Q. As you sit here today, do you know if
8	you have been hired by the tobacco companies or
9	their lawyers in any other case in Florida other
10	than Ciccone?
11	A. I have been working on a case, a
12	Down's case.
13	Q. Is that a Florida tobacco case, to
14	your knowledge?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. But you have not given a deposition in
17	that case, correct?
18	A. No, I've not.
19	Q. Ma'am, the last several minutes -- by
20	the way, if you need to take a break, please let
21	me know.
22	A. Okay. Thanks. Maybe pretty son.
23	We're almost at the hour mark. I can make it
24	until then.
0041
1	Q. What I think we've been going over so
2	far has been your work in the legal arena,
3	correct?
4	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
5	A. Again, I don't see my work as being
6	work in the legal arena. I'm not an attorney,
7	I'm a historian, and I would say my work has
8	been in my discipline and my area of expertise,
9	which is history.
10	Q. Before I move off of the subject that
11	we discussed earlier, aside from the legal
12	related work that you've just told us about in
13	detail, have you ever done any research in
14	historical smoking behavior in the United
15	States?
16	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
17	A. Aside from the work that we've talked
18	about -- I'm sorry, I didn't get the first part
19	of your question. If I could have that
20	repeated, please?
21	MR. WICHMANN: Madam court
22	reporter.
23	(Record read)
24	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
0042
1	A. I have done -- again, I want to be
2	careful here. I have done work in researching,
3	you know, the history of smoking and health and
4	related issues for cases, again, in which I have
5	not been disclosed that we haven't talked about
6	specifically.
7	Q. Forget about that work in those cases.
8	My question to you is apart from legal
9	related work, have you done any research into
10	historical smoking behavior in the United
11	States?
12	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
13	A. It does come up occasionally in my
14	teaching in lectures when I talk about the -- it
15	certainly comes up in southern history when I
16	talk about the development -- the invention of
17	the bond sack smoking or cigarette machine and
18	the roll of tobacco, the tobacco industry in
19	southern history.
20	So I think, yes, I have done work that
21	has -- on these issues that isn't directly
22	related to some of these cases that I've been
23	asked to work on.
24	Q. Have those results ever been
0043
1	published?
2	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
3	A. Again, other than what I mentioned
4	earlier, I know I talk about Buck Duke in my
5	book about Charlotte.
6	No, these would be the kind of
7	research I do for the lectures that I present in
8	class.
9	Q. Would you like to take a break? This
10	might be a good point.
11	A. I would, actually. Thank you.
12	Q. Sure.
13	(Recess taken)
14	BY MR. WICHMANN:
15	Q. Did you have a discussion with the
16	lady tobacco lawyer during the break?
17	A. If you're asking if I had a discussion
18	with Ms. Lawson, no.
19	Q. Yes.
20	A. I'm sorry, lady tobacco lawyer. I
21	think we're specifically talking about
22	Miss Lawson, and no, I did not have a discussion
23	with her.
24	Q. Fine.
0044
1	Ma'am, are you going to testify in
2	this case about the history of science?
3	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
4	A. Certainly scientific developments as
5	they appear in the press and are disseminated to
6	the public is something that I would testify
7	about.
8	Q. What qualifications do you believe you
9	have to testify in the area of the history of
10	science?
11	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
12	A. Again, I didn't say I would be
13	testifying in the history of science.
14	I said that there are many scientific
15	studies that are disseminated to the public in
16	newspapers, magazine articles and television
17	news, radio reports and things like that that
18	are part of, you know, the research that I've
19	done that impact public awareness. So I will be
20	talking about those.
21	Q. So you have no special qualifications
22	in the area of the history of science, correct?
23	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
24	A. I'm a US social historian. Scientific
0045
1	developments certainly impact social history, so
2	I certainly incorporate those into my own
3	research when they're relevant.
4	Q. What is the history of science?
5	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
6	A. In general, you want a definition of
7	it or how it's viewed in the historical
8	discipline? I'm not sure exactly what you're
9	asking.
10	Q. Well, all of the above.
11	First of all, what is your definition
12	of the history of science?
13	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
14	A. Again, I would say that it's a
15	subfield, it's a specialization in the larger
16	discipline of history that focuses on various,
17	you know, changing conceptions of the natural
18	world and how some of those ideas change over
19	time.
20	Q. Did I understand you to say that you
21	believe that it is a subfield of history?
22	A. It's a specialization within history,
23	within the larger discipline of history, just
24	like social history is.
0046
1	Q. I'm going to use that term that you
2	dislike, and if you can think of a better term,
3	please let me, but have you ever held yourself
4	out as a specialist in the field of the history
5	of science?
6	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
7	A. I have never claimed to be a historian
8	of science.
9	Q. I'm writing claimed to be down, ma'am.
10	Thank you very much. I'll try to use that
11	instead of held yourself out. I agree that's a
12	better term.
13	A. Okay.
14	Q. So you've never taken any specialized
15	courses in the history of science, correct?
16	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
17	A. I don't believe so, no.
18	Q. You've never written any articles
19	concerning the history of science, correct?
20	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
21	A. No, that's true, right.
22	Q. Do you have any qualifications in the
23	field of medicine?
24	A. No, sir. I'm not a doctor, that kind
0047
1	of doctor.
2	Q. But you would agree as you sit here
3	today that smoking cigarettes causes diseases?
4	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
5	A. Again, I'm not sure if you're asking
6	me my personal opinion or my opinion as an
7	expert witness and consultant as a social
8	historian in this case.
9	Q. So you would have a different opinion
10	on that subject for the tobacco companies in
11	litigation than you would have personally, say,
12	at home with your spouse or significant other,
13	is that what you're saying?
14	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
15	A. No, that's absolutely not what I'm
16	saying.
17	I'm just saying I'm not sure what
18	you're, you know, in what respect you're asking
19	me to answer the question.
20	As I understand it, I'm here in this
21	deposition as an expert witness as a social
22	historian who's been asked to determine public
23	awareness regarding smoking and health and the
24	addictive nature of cigarettes.
0048
1	Q. Well, my simple question to you is do
2	you agree that smoking cigarettes adversely
3	affects human health? Simple question. I'm
4	asking for a simple answer, yes or no. Can you
5	do that?
6	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
7	A. Are you asking me whether I believe
8	that public awareness regarding that issue, or
9	are you asking me as an individual my personal
10	opinions?
11	I'm not saying they're different. I'm
12	just --1 just want to know what you're asking,
13	I guess.
14	Q. Well, my question is why would you be
15	coming to court and testifying about public
16	knowledge of smoking cigarettes and health if
17	you didn't believe that smoking cigarettes
18	caused disease?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. My personal opinions about any of
21	these issues are irrelevant.
22	Again, I've been asked to determine as
23	a social historian who has approached this topic
24	the questions as I would any other historical
0049
1	question that I would pursue, you know, trying
2	to seek out the answers to work through the
3	historical method, to come to conclusions.
4	And so my personal opinion is not part
5	of that story. The historical method is very
6	clear that in trying to make sure that personal
7	bias does not enter into the actual analysis of
8	the sources and the conclusions that one draws.
9	Q. Let's talk for a moment, please, about
10	historical methods.
11	Who is William W., and I hope I
12	pronounce this correctly, Stueck, S-T-U-E-C-K?
13	Do you know?
14	A. S-T-U-E -
15	Q. U-E-C-K from the University of
16	Georgia.
17	A. Could you just give me a minute here?
18	(Pause)
19	A. I'm sorry, that name doesn't ring a
20	bell.
21	Q. Are you familiar with a text called
22	Reading and Writing American History, An
23	Introduction to the Historian's Craft? Are you
24	familiar with that publication?
0050
1	A. I don't recall that publication
2	exactly. I look at quite a few. I teach
3	historical method. I look at a lot of different
4	texts about reading and writing history. That
5	one does not ring a bell with me at the moment.
6	Q. Do you know any of the historians
7	personally or by reputation that are affiliated
8	with the University of Georgia?
9	A. I can't think of anybody directly at
10	the moment, no.
11	Q. Are there any texts that you are aware
12	of dealing with historical methods that you
13	consider authoritative?
14	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
15	A. I'm not sure what you mean by
16	authoritative. How would you define that
17	particular term?
18	Q. First of all, important in your field
19	of expertise?
20	A. Yeah. There's a book I use by Marius.
21	It's a text I've used in historical methods
22	courses. I think that's the one I've used most
23	often. I can't remember the exact name of it,
24	but I think it might just be call Writing
0051
1	History.
2	Q. Would that be the best source for me
3	to look at to learn how the historical method
4	works ?
5	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
6	A. Again, I don't know if it's the best
7	source without doing, you know, a very thorough
8	survey of everything that's out there.
9	It's certainly one that I've used with
10	undergraduates. It seems very comprehensive and
11	comprehensible.
12	Q. Have you ever cited that work in any
13	works that you have done?
14	A. You mean in my own scholarship?
15	Q. Let's start with your own scholarship.
16	A. No. And it wouldn't be necessarily
17	relevant to my -- to cite a source like that in
18	my scholarship.
19	Q. Is it a required textbook for your
20	students in any of the classes that you teach at
21	Clark University ?
22	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
23	A. Again, I'd have to look back and my
24	records, but I'm pretty sure I do assign it, as
0052
1	I said, in my writing history class.
2	Q. Does that text, as far as you can
3	recall, set out how the historical method should
4	be employed?
5	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
6	A. Again, I think it sets out the
7	historical method, the steps of it.
8	Again, as I recall, it does set out
9	how one constructs a good research question, how
10	one proceeds with research first and secondary
11	sources, and then in primary sources, how one
12	weighs evidence or one analyzing sources and how
13	one draws conclusions.
14	Q. Would the work that you have done so
15	far in Ciccone be in accordance with that
16	textbook?
17	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
18	A. Again, I'm not sure about the textbook
19	on the whole. I think in terms of my memory of
20	the way he sets out the historical method.
21	Again, if I'm recalling correctly, I
22	do look at a lot of these books, and I kind of
23	used a number of them over time, yes, I would
24	say that I did follow his steps.
0053
1	Q. I'm sorry, did you finish your answer,
2	ma'am?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. Just so that it's clear, you would
5	have followed his steps as contained in that
6	textbook in the work that you did in the Ciccone
7	case, correct?
8	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
9	A. Again, I just want to emphasize, you
10	know, I don't have a photographic memory about
11	what's exactly in that text.
12	I do know that I've used that text,
13	and as I recall, to the best of my knowledge, it
14	laid out those kinds of questions in a good way,
15	in ways that I certainly agree with and in ways
16	that I think I've proceeded in to do my research
17	in this particular case.
18	Q. Could you spell the name of the author
19	of that book for me, please?
20	A. Sure. It's M-A-R-I-U-S, I believe,
21	Marius.
22	Q. And is that gentleman affiliated with
23	a university?
24	A. I believe he was at Harvard, but I'm
0054
1	not sure.
2	Q. I believe you told us earlier that you
3	were first contacted by a lawyer for Chook Hardy
4	to do work on this case, correct?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. How were you contacted?
7	A. I'm not quite sure. Probably --1
8	probably got a phone call from her.
9	Q. Had you worked with her on any cases
10	before the Ciccone case?
11	A. With Ms. McGroder, no.
12	Q. How do you suppose she knew to call
13	you?
14	A. I don't know. You'd have to ask her.
15	Q. Have you ever claimed to be an expert
16	witness in the history of tobacco for the
17	purpose of testifying in court?
18	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
19	A. I don't claim to be anything more than
20	I've already stated. I'm an expert witness as a
21	social historian.
22	I think my credentials speak for
23	themselves. I have a Ph.D. in US social
24	history. I've taught 20 years at Clark
0055
1	University. I teach everybody from first year
2	students through Ph.D. students.
3	And, again, I was asked to research
4	and draw conclusions, again, about the very
5	particular questions that I've already stated
6	several times, which was about public awareness
7	regarding smoking and health and addiction
8	issues relating to cigarettes.
9	Q. I apologize. My question was poorly
10	worded.
11	What I meant to ask you, Doctor, was
12	have you ever advertised yourself as a social
13	historian expert for litigation purposes?
14	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
15	A. Advertised, no.
16	Q. We've had a moment or two. Have you
17	thought anymore about how Chook Hardy came to
18	find Janette Thomas Greenwood at the Department
19	of History for Clark University to work on the
20	Ciccone case?
21	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
22	A. Again, I think you'd have to ask
23	Ms. McGroder.
24	Q. Do you routinely employ research
0056
1	assistants?
2	A. No.
3	Q. Have you in the past in any of your
4	litigation-related work employed research
5	assistants?
6	A. Yes, I have.
7	Q. Did you employ any research assistants
8	in the Ciccone case?
9	A. Yes, I did.
10	Q. Who?
11	A. I asked a -- I'm really terrible with
12	last names. Her name is Inga, I think it was
13	Johnson.
14	I needed --1 used her very
15	specifically to collect some information that I
16	could not get to, again, because of where this
17	information was located and, again, demands on
18	my own time.
19	I interviewed her to make sure that
20	she had the proper credentials. I supervised
21	her.
22	I very specifically asked her to
23	collect some items, particularly in the Navy
24	Times, it was in the Library of Congress which I
0057
1	couldn't get to in a short period of time.
2	Q. How did you find Miss Johnson?
3	A. I got a list of names from Chook, from
4	people who had -- they gave me, again, a list of
5	names of possible research assistants.
6	I got CVs from all of them. I
7	interviewed the ones that I felt were, you know,
8	had the strongest credentials, and I chose on
9	that basis.
10	Q. Okay. Let me clearly understand your
11	answer.
12	In the Ciccone case you received a
13	list of names of potential research assistants
14	from the law firm of Chook Hardy. Is that your
15	testimony?
16	A. I would fine tune that a bit. I asked
17	for a list. The initiative came from me.
18	I was looking for--1 was looking for
19	a research assistant for this particular slice
20	of research that I could not conduct on my own.
21	Q. And you asked the lawyers for the
22	tobacco companies for that list of research
23	assistants, correct?
24	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
0058
1	A. Again, I asked Chook, Hardy & Bacon.
2	My understanding is they do other litigation
3	too. They are not in-house counsel is the way I
4	would define tobacco lawyer, but maybe we have
5	different definitions. I did ask for a list of
6	researchers.
7	And I want to make it clear it was up
8	to me who to choose based on credentials, based
9	on my interviews with them, based on my sense of
10	their abilities.
11	Q. Okay. So you asked for a list of
12	potential research assistants from the tobacco
13	lawyers, but you had the right to choose which
14	research assistant. Is that fair to say?
15	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
16	A. Again, I asked Chook, Hardy & Bacon
17	for a list. I got background information on all
18	of them. I interviewed them. I carefully, you
19	know, teleconferenced with them -- the person I
20	chose several times.
21	Yes, I did have the choice. I had the
22	right to choose my own. I certainly insisted on
23	the right to choose my own research assistant.
24	Q. Okay. So the law firm for the tobacco
0059
1	companies gave you the list of potential
2	research assistants.
3	Did they also provide you with a list
4	of CVs for those potential research assistants,
5	or did you get the CVs on your own?
6	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
7	A. Again, as I recall, I got the CVs on
8	my own.
9	Q. Okay. Are you paying Inga Johnson out
10	of what you are charging for your work in this
11	case, or is Chook Hardy paying Inga Johnson, if
12	you know?
13	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
14	A. Again, I believe that she keeps her
15	own hours and sends off her bill to whoever.
16	I'm not sure. All I know is that I do not pay
17	her directly.
18	Q. But somebody pays her? She's not
19	working for free, correct?
20	A. That's true, she not working for free.
21	Q. Did you ever on your own look for a
22	list of potential research assistants outside of
23	the list that was provided to you by the
24	attorneys for the tobacco companies?
0060
1	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
2	A. Again, for this, are you talking about
3	this particular case?
4	Q. For this particular case, for the
5	Ciccone case.
6	A. I don't believe I did for this case.
7	Q. Ma'am, in this case you have provided
8	us with a resource list, correct? And I believe
9	it is marked as an exhibit for this deposition,
10	right?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. What number does it have on it?
13	A. Mine says Exhibit Number 1.
14	Q. Okay. As to Exhibit Number 1, looking
15	at pages -- well, subcategory one, under
16	description has books, pamphlets, posters and
17	reports, correct?
18	A. Yes, Mm-hmm.
19	Q. And it contains one, two, three, four,
20	five pages, correct?
21	A. Let me count. Yes, it does, Ah-huh.
22	Q. Would you read number one?
23	A. One under Roman one is King James I, a
24	Counter-Blaste Against Tobacco.
0061
1	Q. When was that first printed?
2	A. 1604.
3	Q. As you sit here today, ma'am, do you
4	have any evidence that George Ciccone ever read
5	this King James I, Counter-Blaste Against
6	Tobacco?
7	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
8	A. No, I don't.
9	And that's not what I was asked to
10	research, whether George Ciccone ever read this.
11	I was asked to research public
12	awareness regarding the risks of smoking and
13	cigarette addiction. And that's why this
14	particular item is on this list.
15	Q. Okay. Under item number one, books,
16	pamphlets, posters and reports on your reliance
17	list you have a total of 105 publications,
18	correct?
19	A. Yes, I do, Mm-hmm.
20	Q. Do you have any evidence as you sit
21	here today that George Ciccone ever read any one
22	of those 105 documents under category one on
23	your resource list?
24	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
0062
1	A. Again, I'll repeat what I have said I
2	think several times this morning, that I have
3	been asked as an expert witness to determine
4	public awareness regarding smoking and health
5	issues and addiction.
6	And I would say, again, that, you
7	know, this is part of the information,
8	environment that was -- much of this was out
9	there when George Ciccone was -- started to
10	smoke and continued to smoke.
11	And, again, this information is the
12	research I've done to try to determine, again,
13	public awareness regarding these issues.
14	So, again, you see the long kind of
15	historical coverage here showing that, you know,
16	as early as 1604 starting with the example that
17	you brought up, there was, again, this awareness
18	growing at such an early point about smoking and
19	health issues and the addictive nature of
20	tobacco.
21	Q. Ma'am, did you review any depositions
22	in this case?
23	A. Yes, I did.
24	Q. Which depositions did you review?
0063
1	A. I think they're here on my resource
2	list on the last page. I think they're all
3	listed there, ones that I've read.
4	Q. Okay. You don't need to read them to
5	me.
6	My simple question to you is can you
7	point to any portion in any one of those
8	depositions where a witness testified that
9	George Ciccone read any of the 105 publications
10	you have listed under section one on your
11	resource list?
12	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
13	A. Well, I do know that based on his
14	brother -- George Ciccone's brother Paul's
15	deposition that they discussed the Surgeon
16	General's report of 1964.
17	And, again, I think my point as a
18	social historian here is that I've been asked to
19	discuss public awareness. And this information,
20	much of this information was information that
21	was, again, readily available to someone like
22	George Ciccone or any American living in this
23	period.
24	Q. Well, which publication under section
0064
1	one of the 105 listed can you point to that
2	George Ciccone actually read?
3	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
4	A. Well, again, I know he discussed the
5	Surgeon General's report in 1964.
6	Again, my point is in listing this
7	information, I was researching and drawing
8	conclusions about the question that I was asked
9	to research, which was public awareness
10	regarding smoking and health and addiction to
11	cigarettes.
12	If I may finish?
13	Q. Sure.
14	A. Thank you.
15	This was part of the information
16	environment that, you know, again was out there,
17	part of the environment that George Ciccone and
18	other Americans at this time, you know, had
19	access to. This was information that was
20	repeated and reiterated and echoed in all kinds
21	of ways.
22	If people didn't read the Surgeon
23	General's report in 1964, they were certainly
24	talking about it. It shows up in songs, in
0065
1	cartoons of the era. It shows up in all kinds
2	of ways.
3	So, again, this is part of this
4	information environment.
5	Q. Okay. Aside from the Surgeon
6	General's report that you saw Paul Ciccone said
7	he discussed with his brother George, are there
8	any other publications under your section one on
9	your resource list that you can show George
10	Ciccone directly read?
11	A. Well, again, I think just following up
12	on the Surgeon General's report, I do know that
13	Mr. Ciccone was in the Navy between '64 and '67
14	and that at that time the Navy Surgeon General
15	talked a lot about the Surgeon General's report,
16	required lectures to sailors.
17	And also the Navy Times reported that
18	if you bought cigarettes at the PX in the
19	military at this time, there was a big poster on
20	the counter that basically quoted the Surgeon
21	General's report.
22	So, again, my point is in citing some
23	of this information that even though, you know,
24	perhaps Mr. Ciccone didn't read the Surgeon
0066
1	General's report from cover to cover, that that
2	information was disseminated in all kinds of
3	ways, that he certainly would have had access to
4	that information.
5	Q. Well, what evidence do you have that
6	George Ciccone while he was alive read the Navy
7	Times that you just referred to?
8	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
9	A. Again, I didn't say that he read the
10	Navy Times. I said the Navy Times reported that
11	any sailor buying a cigarette, buying a pack of
12	cigarettes at any PX in 1964 had to confront a
13	big sign at the counter that basically
14	reiterated the Surgeon General's warning in 1964
15	that the evidence in his view was that there was
16	a causal relationship between smoking and lung
17	cancer in men.
18	Q. Simple question. Do you know as you
19	sit here today whether George Ciccone while he
20	was alive read any of the publications under
21	your subsection one, the total 105 of them?
22	A. Again, I will say that my job as a
23	social historian here, what I was asked to do,
24	the question I was asked to address was to
0067
1	assess public awareness on these issues and with
2	the particular focus in the life span of
3	Mr. Ciccone from 1946 through 2002.
4	And, again, my conclusions were that
5	there was so much information on here. Again,
6	that's why there are like 105 of these as part
7	of my resource list, again, which to me shows
8	you sort of the extent, the breadth of this kind
9	of information that was out there.
10	And if you didn't read a Surgeon
11	General's report in 1964 or you didn't read
12	perhaps this specific American Cancer Society
13	pamphlet, that information about the hazards of
14	smoking and the addictive nature of smoking was
15	still being repeated in many, many different
16	ways.
17	Q. Aside from the depositions in the
18	case, have you performed any personal interviews
19	with any other witnesses who may have known
20	George Ciccone when he was alive?
21	A. I have not, no.
22	Q. Okay. So is it fair to say, ma'am,
23	just to wrap it up, I know your position on the
24	issue, that you don't know as you sit here today
0068
1	whether George Ciccone in fact while he was
2	alive read any of the publications under your
3	subsection one?
4	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
5	A. Again, my question -- the question
6	I've been asked to research and draw conclusions
7	about was public awareness regarding these
8	issues.
9	I can definitely say and feel very
10	confident in saying that in George Ciccone's
11	lifetime, between 1946 and 2002, there were
12	many, many messages reiterated, repeated, echoed
13	in a variety of ways, in a variety of forms,
14	everything from television news, to newspaper
15	reports, to public service announcements, to
16	textbooks, to popular songs, to movies that were
17	referencing the dangers of smoking and sending
18	that message out, the dangers of smoking and the
19	fact that smoking itself could be addictive.
20	I feel very confident in saying that
21	that was the information environment within
22	which Mr. Ciccone lived.
23	Q. One more question, and we'll move on.
24	Here's a good one. Cotton Mather Manudictio ad
0069
1	Ministerium -- I'm sorry, my daughter takes
2	Latin, and I'm not good at it -- reproduced from
3	the original, 1726.
4	That's number seven on your resource
5	list, right?
6	A. Yes, it is.
7	Q. Do you know if George Ciccone read
8	that?
9	A. Again, my point in including this is
10	not whether or not George Ciccone read it.
11	My point is that as early as Cotton
12	Mather, and even earlier than Cotton Mather,
13	he's almost a latecomer in this story in 1726,
14	that he was talking about the enslaving
15	qualities, the bewitching qualities of tobacco.
16	And so my point in including Cotton
17	Mather and King James I or Rush and others is
18	that almost from the very beginning, almost from
19	the moment that tobacco was first introduced to
20	Columbus and his crew by native Americans,
21	people seemed aware that there were problems
22	relating to this product, that not only was it
23	enslaving, as people talked about at the time,
24	and bewitching and intoxicating were the words
0070
1	that people used in the Sixteenth, Seventeenth,
2	Eighteenth Century, but it also made people
3	cough. It seemed to slow them down. It seemed
4	to have negative -- it made their throat hurt.
5	It seemed to make their bodies slow down.
6	So that's my point here. And, again,
7	it's part of this information environment. And
8	my point is just to show how long that kind of
9	discussion has been out there regarding tobacco.
10	Q. Have you been able to determine George
11	Ciccone's level of education?
12	A. I do know from the depositions that he
13	dropped out of high school. It sounded like he
14	went through at least eleventh grade.
15	Q. Would you expect most eleventh graders
16	that drop out of high school to be familiar with
17	King James I, Counter-Blaste Against Tobacco?
18	Is that your testimony in this case?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. Obviously that's not my testimony. I
21	think I've gone over this several times about
22	why I have included these particular examples.
23	Talking about public awareness, the
24	way it's generally defined is thinking about the
0071
1	messages that get repeated over and over again.
2	They get reiterated, get echoed in lots of
3	different forms, repeated over a long period of
4	time.
5	And my point here, as I just said, is
6	that, you know, King James in 1604, you know, he
7	and many others, as I've already noted here, are
8	already talking about the negative effects, the
9	ill effects of tobacco and its ability to
10	enslave people, to bewitch them. That's my
11	point.
12	In other words, this is not something
13	that people begin to talk about in the 1950s or
14	in 1964. These are ideas that go back a long
15	way, and that's my point as a historian is to
16	show that.
17	Q. Do you believe as you sit here today
18	that tobacco enslaves people?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. Again, are you asking me as an expert
21	witness, or are you asking me as my personal
22	opinion?
23	Q. Well, according to the Surgeon
24	General, cigarette smoking has resulted in
0072
1	400,000 dead Americans a year for years. So I'm
2	asking you, one, as an expert witness and, two,
3	as a human being. Do you have an answer?
4	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
5	A. The question, again, if I go back and
6	remember, was tobacco enslaving?
7	Q. Those were your words, not mine.
8	A. No, those were not my words at all. I
9	was quoting Cotton Mather, which seems to be one
10	of your favorites on this list. He used the
11	word enslaving.
12	Q. So you don't believe the nicotine in
13	tobacco is addictive, is that what you're
14	saying?
15	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
16	A. No, I'm not saying that.
17	Q. Okay. And you're not saying that
18	smoking cigarettes doesn't cause disease, are
19	you, ma'am?
20	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
21	A. Again, I'm here to testify as an
22	expert witness. I am not a medical doctor. I'm
23	a Ph.D. in history and social history. I'm here
24	to testify or speak to you today regarding my
0073
1	findings based on my research on a topic of
2	public awareness.
3	Q. Let's talk a little bit about George
4	Ciccone's social history.
5	Were you able to determine when he
6	began smoking cigarettes?
7	A. There's some disagreement on that.
8	Based on the depositions, his sister said --
9	Pauline said she thought he began sneaking a
10	cigarette or two from their father at age six.
11	His brother Paul on the other hand
12	thought that he and George really had begun
13	smoking at around age 10 or 11.
14	So, again, there's some sort of
15	discrepancy there.
16	Q. Were you able to determine whether
17	George Ciccone became a regular smoker?
18	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
19	A. Again, I'm not sure how you define
20	regular, but in the depositions it seemed --
21	again, there's some variation in terms of exact
22	years, but it certainly seems that he was
23	smoking on a regular basis by the time he was in
24	high school, junior high or high school for
0074
1	sure.
2	Q. Were you able to determine when George
3	Ciccone became nicotine addicted?
4	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
5	A. Again, that's -- the depositions did
6	not give me that information.
7	And, again, my main focus was on
8	researching this information environment
9	regarding public awareness and smoking and
10	health and addiction.
11	Q. Dr. Michael Hirsch's deposition is on
12	your reliance list, isn't it?
13	A. Yes, his doctor, yes.
14	Q. Was that important to forming your
15	opinions, reading that deposition?
16	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
17	A. Again, not important in forming my
18	opinions because my opinions are, again, about
19	public awareness, again, this information that's
20	readily available to the public on these issues
21	and sort of the weight of that, public awareness
22	regarding these issues.
23	It was relevant in a sense that I
24	think he told -- as I recall in that deposition,
0075
1	he told Mr. Ciccone that he really needed to
2	quit smoking.
3	Q. He also wrote down in his chart in
4	1990 that Mr. Ciccone was nicotine addicted.
5	You read that, didn't you?
6	A. Yes, I did.
7	But, again, my charge here, what I was
8	asked to research was public awareness regarding
9	things like addiction.
10	And, again, I would argue, if you want
11	to refer back to my resource list, that I think
12	I feel very strongly that the weight of my
13	evidence here that I presented stands on its
14	own, that people talked about addiction for
15	years or were first talking about it as being
16	bewitched or enslaved and then later using the
17	term addict to describe people who could not
18	quit cigarettes.
19	Q. So is it your testimony that a doctor
20	telling his patient not to smoke constitutes
21	public awareness of the risks of smoking
22	cigarettes?
23	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
24	A. No, that's not what I'm saying at all.
0076
1	Again, I'm not a medical doctor. I've
2	been asked, and I keep saying the same thing,
3	but I think I need to make it clear what exactly
4	my role is here, and that was to research the
5	issue of public awareness regarding smoking and
6	health issues and addiction.
7	And to do that, I did a lot of
8	research, as you can see here in my resource
9	list, in newspapers, in magazines, in textbooks,
10	in various kinds of educational materials, TV
11	news programs to get a sense of how people
12	understood these kinds of issues, what they were
13	aware of at this time.
14	So that's really what I am testifying
15	about.
16	Q. Okay. So Dr. Hirsch's deposition is
17	not really important to your opinions in this
18	case, is that what you're saying?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. It's important in the sense of me
21	getting sort of an understanding of the sort of
22	the overall story of Mr. Ciccone's life.
23	But in terms of the drawing
24	conclusions regarding public awareness, again,
0077
1	that's information that is generally available
2	to the public. Again, this is publicly
3	disseminated information, and that's what I drew
4	my conclusions on.
5	Q. And how many packs of cigarettes a day
6	did George Ciccone smoke over his lifetime? Do
7	you know?
8	A. How many packs over his lifetime, like
9	sum total?
10	Q. Correct.
11	A. I have no idea. I know he was an
12	extremely heavy smoker. All of the depositions
13	I read certainly refer to him that way. He
14	smoked as much as four packs of cigarettes a
15	day.
16	Q. For many years, right?
17	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
18	A. Again, I think that varied over the
19	time, and the depositions varied a bit on that.
20	I don't think it was always consistent in terms
21	of the way people understood his smoking
22	history. But he --1 think everyone agreed in
23	the depositions that he was a heavy smoker.
24	Q. And I may have asked you this before,
0078
1	and if I did, I apologize. You read in
2	Dr. Hirsch's deposition that he diagnosed George
3	as being addicted to nicotine, you read that,
4	didn't you?
5	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
6	A. I think, again, what I remember, I
7	think that came from Mrs. Ciccone's deposition
8	where she talked about Dr. Hirsch. She
9	mentioned I think at that point that
10	Dr. Hirsch -- what I remember most is that
11	Dr. Hirsch told him that he needed to quit
12	smoking at that time.
13	Q. So you don't remember Dr. Hirsch
14	saying anything about George being addicted to
15	nicotine?
16	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
17	A. Again, I generally remember that, how
18	Mrs. Ciccone described it.
19	But as far as, again, drawing my
20	conclusions, they are based on the publicly
21	available information. Again, this information
22	is available to anyone on these issues.
23	So, again, a private conversation
24	between a doctor and his patient isn't
0079
1	information that I would -- that would influence
2	my opinions regarding public awareness.
3	Q. Getting back to your resource list,
4	Doctor. All of the items that are under
5	category one that we have discussed, could you
6	tell me, who located all that material?
7	A. I know I located a lot of it, probably
8	I would say I located at least most of it.
9	Yeah. I mean, a lot of these things, again, are
10	in the libraries that I researched.
11	I did research -- Mr. Ciccone was bom
12	in Worcester County, lived there until 1970. I
13	lived in Worcester County for 20 years, still
14	teach in Worcester County.
15	I did this research in Worcester
16	Public Library, Clark University Library, Boston
17	Public Library, State Library in Massachusetts,
18	University of Massachusetts Med School in
19	Worcester.
20	So, yeah, I would say almost all of
21	this I found on my own.
22	Q. What did you not find on your own that
23	is listed on your resource list under section
24	number one?
0080
1	(Pause)
2	A. I think, to the best of my knowledge,
3	almost everything. I can't think of anything
4	offhand that I didn't find on my own.
5	Q. Did Inga Johnson find anything under
6	subsection one for you?
7	A. No. As I said, I used her in a very
8	limited way, Navy Times mostly at the library of
9	Congress. That's in the newspaper section.
10	Q. Did the tobacco lawyers provide you
11	with any of the 105 documents listed under
12	section one of your resource list?
13	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
14	A. Again, to the best of my knowledge,
15	this is research that I conducted.
16	Q. Nobody but you, is that your
17	testimony?
18	A. I think for this, yeah, yeah.
19	Q. Okay. Let's go to section two,
20	please. We'll move it along.
21	A. Okay.
22	Q. Section two of your resource list
23	contains newspaper articles and magazine
24	articles, correct?
0081
1	A. That's right.
2	Q. Who got those documents? Who found
3	those documents?
4	A. I know I did a lot of the periodicals
5	the old-fashioned way. Reader's Guide to
6	Periodicals, I collected those.
7	Worcester Telegram and Gazette I did.
8	I went to Miami, worked on the Miami
9	Herald and News. I did my research in Florida.
10	I know some of the Boston Globe, but
11	not all of it, I did a lot of that myself, but
12	there were some years, maybe like 1950 to '65,
13	I'm guessing, where I had actually requested
14	some of this information.
15	Q. Who did you request it from?
16	A. When I first started working, asked to
17	do this kind of research as a consultant, I was
18	first approached by Julia Tyler in Washington.
19	And I was first approached to do some
20	research as a consultant on a Massachusetts
21	case, and I remember asking at the time whether
22	any of the newspaper research had been done
23	previously, and so I asked, you know, if they
24	had any copies of the Boston Globe.
0082
1	And I should say then that I did my
2	due diligence on that. I went to the Library of
3	Congress with some of those copies that they had
4	done, I double checked them. I felt very
5	strongly after doing careful checks on them that
6	they had been collected properly.
7	Q. Who's Julia Tyler?
8	A. Julia Tyler was an attorney for a firm
9	in Washington by the name of Johnson Tyler &
10	Pervis.
11	Q. And that firm represents the tobacco
12	companies, correct?
13	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
14	A. Again, when Julia --1 understand that
15	they were sort of a consulting firm to various
16	organizations, corporations. I know they had
17	done some work for the tobacco companies.
18	Q. Okay. So it was your understanding
19	that the material provided to you by Julia Tyler
20	was being provided to you on behalf of the
21	tobacco companies?
22	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
23	A. No, that's not my understanding or
24	what I'm saying.
0083
1	Again, when I was approached to
2	work -- to do some research as an expert on a
3	particular Massachusetts case, I asked her if
4	any of the Globe microfilms had been done.
5	And some of them had been, not all of
6	them, because I did quite a few of them myself,
7	but I did get some copies of microfilms or
8	microfilm copies.
9	And as I said, I was very careful,
10	again, treating it as I would any source to, you
11	know, double check. And I double checked a lot
12	of these sources. I did my due diligence on
13	them so that I was sure that they had done a
14	thorough job.
15	Q. What evidence do you have that George
16	Ciccone read sections from Ebony Magazine,
17	number 11 on your section two, newspapers,
18	magazines and periodicals?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. Again, Ebony is part -- of course it's
21	an African American magazine generally.
22	It's part of the information, you
23	know, a universe of information regarding
24	smoking and health and addiction that is part of
0084
1	public awareness.
2	And, again, that's what I was asked to
3	determine, public awareness regarding smoking
4	and health issues and addiction to cigarettes,
5	and Ebony is part of that information
6	environment, and that's what I was researching
7	here, again, the larger information environment.
8	Q. I understand that, ma'am. And I think
9	we're going to be here way longer than we need
10	to be.
11	I have a simple question for you, and
12	it is do you have any direct evidence that
13	George Ciccone while he was alive read any
14	sections from Ebony Magazine? Yes or no, and
15	we'll move on.
16	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
17	A. No, I do not have any direct
18	information regarding that.
19	But, again, Ebony, and I think if you
20	look at the dates I have here for Ebony, '74 to
21	'86, this was part of the information
22	environment, again one piece, and I have quite a
23	few pieces here, I think, of the information
24	environment that could be accessed easily by
0085
1	anyone regarding issues of smoking and health
2	and addition.
3	Q. Number 15, Ladies Home Journal, was
4	George Ciccone a reader of Ladies Home Journal
5	to your knowledge, yes or no?
6	A. Not to my knowledge.
7	But, again, I would say that Ladies
8	Home Journal is part of this larger information
9	environment. That's what I was asked to
10	research. That's what I was asked to draw my
11	conclusions about, public awareness. And Ladies
12	Home Journal is part of that story.
13	So I could take something like Ladies
14	Home Journal or Ebony and that's where you see
15	discussions of the Surgeon General's report,
16	discussions of how to quit smoking, smoking is
17	bad for you.
18	Again, it's a good example of how
19	widely and how deeply these messages regarding
20	smoking and health and addiction were
21	disseminated to the public.
22	Q. Simple question, yes or no, do you
23	have any direct evidence --
24	A. I answered it.
0086
1	Q. This is another question.
2	A. I'm sorry. I apologize.
3	Q. Simple question, and then we can move
4	on, yes-or-no answer, if you can, do you have
5	any direct evidence that George Ciccone read
6	while he was alive any of the publications
7	listed under your section two on your resource
8	list?
9	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
10	A. Well, again, going back to
11	depositions, his brother Paul said that they did
12	get the newspaper when they were living up in
13	Leominster. The Worcester Telegram would have
14	been the newspaper that likely -- almost likely
15	they would have -- pretty much the only
16	newspaper in Worcester County, as far as I know
17	at that time. So I do know that much. So yes,
18	the answer is yes.
19	Q. That would be the only evidence you
20	have, or do you have other evidence?
21	A. He just said that there were
22	newspapers in the home at that time.
23	And, again, I assume it would be the
24	Worcester Telegram because that was the
0087
1	newspaper for Worcester County where they lived.
2	It could have also been the Globe or
3	the Herald.
4	If I may finish because I'm not quite
5	finished. I guess my point would be, again,
6	that my very specific question that I was asked
7	to research was to talk about public awareness
8	in this period with particular focus on the
9	years between 1946 and 2002.
10	Mr. Ciccone's life span and all of
11	these newspapers and magazines and periodicals
12	that I have noted here were part of that
13	information environment where I would argue,
14	again, or I would contend certainly based on my
15	research that, you know, there was awareness
16	regarding the risks of smoking and the addictive
17	nature of smoking.
18	Q. I know you've repeated that several
19	times, and I think I clearly understand your
20	position. What I'm trying to get at is as to
21	George Ciccone specifically, what evidence do
22	you have that he read, listened to, saw, checked
23	the Internet on any of the items listed on your
24	resource list?
0088
1	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
2	A. Again, you know, I know I'm repeating
3	myself, but I need to, apparently.
4	Mr. Ciccone was part of the public in
5	this time period. He is part of this -- he
6	would have had access to this kind of
7	information.
8	Again, this is something that's not --
9	these are not obscure discussions going on in
10	this time period. People are talking about
11	smoking and health, they're joking about it
12	sometimes, they're writing songs about it, it
13	shows up in cartoons, all different forms, I
14	think, are reflected in my resources.
15	So I would say in answer to your
16	question is Mr. Ciccone was part of the public
17	that had access to this kind of information and
18	public awareness regarding these issues.
19	Q. Are you aware, ma'am, of the Waxman
20	hearings?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Did you include those in your
23	research?
24	A. Yeah. They were in the '90s, and I
0089
1	certainly, you know, did my newspaper research
2	and magazine research, et cetera, through that
3	period, yeah.
4	Q. If everybody knew that smoking was
5	addictive and caused disease, why do you suppose
6	the seven CEOs of the tobacco companies swore
7	under oath in front of Congress that it didn't?
8	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
9	A. First of all, I don't make the claim
10	that everybody knew. What people choose to do
11	with knowledge -- what people choose to do with
12	information that's out there is a very personal
13	matter.
14	In terms of George Ciccone, his
15	brother said that they talked about the Surgeon
16	General's report, as an example of what one
17	chooses to believe or not to believe, they
18	talked about the Surgeon General's report, they
19	talked about labels. His brother Paul said we
20	decided to ignore them.
21	So you can have that information out
22	there, public awareness can be out there
23	regarding these issues, and what you choose to
24	do with them is another matter. Again,
0090
1	that's -- I'm talking about the public
2	awareness.
3	The second part of your question, why
4	the tobacco executives said what they did?
5	Again, that's belief. I don't know what was
6	inside their heads. I don't know what they
7	believed at that time. And, again, it's beyond
8	my area of expertise as a historian to speculate
9	about that.
10	Again, I can tell you what I feel
11	public awareness was regarding smoking and
12	health and addiction at the time of the Waxman
13	hearings, you know, but again, why the tobacco
14	industry chose to do that I can't tell you.
15	Q. As a historian, can you tell me, was
16	there a point in time in history when the
17	tobacco companies knew or understood that
18	cigarettes were addictive and caused disease?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. Again, you know, I keep repeating this
21	ad nauseam, and I apologize if it's feeling ad
22	nauseam to you, but my question was about public
23	awareness. And so my role as a historian was to
24	research information that was available in the
0091
1	public domain.
2	So I don't know what the tobacco
3	industry was doing or thinking. Again, that was
4	not in my -- part of what I do as a social
5	historian, which is about public awareness.
6	Q. What is the Frank statement?
7	A. The Frank statement was published in
8	almost every national newspaper in the mid '50s,
9	I think it was '54, but in the mid '50s from the
10	tobacco industry. I think it was maybe the
11	Tobacco Industry Research Council at that point
12	saying -- well, it was published in newspapers
13	in the mid '50s.
14	Q. And what significance does the Frank
15	statement have to your opinions in this case?
16	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
17	A. Well, I included the Frank statement,
18	again, as part of the information environment
19	that was out there. It's certainly part of the
20	story. I include it, again, as a voice that's
21	out there that the public has access to
22	regarding these issues.
23	Again, I look at it within the much
24	broader context, the broad context of
0092
1	information that was out there, the way people
2	are talking about smoking and health issues, the
3	way these things are being reported.
4	In terms of impacting public opinion
5	or impacting public awareness regarding smoking
6	and health, I see it as one voice and, again, in
7	my expert opinion is a singular voice and really
8	did not have any major impact in terms of
9	changing public awareness regarding smoking and
10	health or addiction.
11	Q. I noticed on your reliance list,
12	ma'am, that you did not include one single
13	internal tobacco document. Why was that?
14	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
15	A. Again, the question I was asked to
16	research was public awareness regarding these
17	issues.
18	And public awareness is, again, based
19	on the knowledge or the information that's out
20	there, the public information that's readily
21	available to people regarding these issues.
22	I didn't look at internal documents
23	for the tobacco industry, just as I did not look
24	at internal documents for the American Cancer
0093
1	Society or the Massachusetts Department of
2	Public Health or the Florida Department of
3	Public Health.
4	If there were statements made by the
5	tobacco industry that appeared in the press,
6	appeared in newspapers, appeared in Reader's
7	Digest, appeared on national news, news
8	programs, I included them, again, because
9	they're part of this information environment,
10	this wealth of information that's out there
11	regarding these issues.
12	Q. Well, you know that the tobacco
13	industry has many historical documents relating
14	to the subject we're talking about here today,
15	you know that, right?
16	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
17	A. Again, my focus is on the publicly
18	disseminated information. That's how I as a
19	historian was asked to determine public
20	awareness regarding these issues.
21	This is information, again, that's out
22	in the public. That is what is, you know,
23	shaping this notion, creating this notion of
24	public awareness regarding these issues. So
0094
1	that's what I focused on. That's what I looked
2	at.
3	Again, if the tobacco industry made a
4	public statement, I included that, again, as
5	part of the information of the environment.
6	Q. So did you include Ed Horrigan, the
7	CEO for R.J. Reynolds, Nightline interview with
8	Ted Koppel in 1984 when he said there was no
9	proven link between smoking cigarettes and lung
10	disease? Did you include that in your research?
11	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
12	A. I have reviewed that 1984 Nightline
13	with Ted Koppel where Ed Horrigan is
14	interviewed. Yes, I included that. Again,
15	that's public information. The public watches
16	Nightline. It's information they get.
17	Again, I view that program and even Ed
18	Horrigan's testimony within the larger or
19	conversation with Ted Koppel within the larger
20	context, and even that program, as I recall, the
21	head of the American Cancer Society was also on
22	that program, there were a number of doctors, a
23	couple people from Sloane-Kettering.
24	Ed Horrigan is one voice. He's
0095
1	actually, you know, one of only about five or
2	six people that are actually on that program.
3	He's one voice, you know, again, giving his
4	opinions. And, you know, again, in terms of
5	impacting public awareness, he's a singular
6	voice.
7	And I conclude, again, in my findings
8	that the tobacco industry is one voice. Their
9	voice regarding -- is not reiterated or reechoed
10	or supported from other -- in other sources.
11	And they're a voice that, again,
12	looking at this whole issue of public awareness
13	over decades, it seems very clear to me as a
14	historian, again, in looking at the tobacco
15	industry voice that in the '50s, when the
16	scientific studies first began to be publicized,
17	the Mount Pinning studies and things like that,
18	you know, the Frank statement comes out, that
19	oftentimes newspapers would give the tobacco
20	industry a whole article, be side by side
21	sometimes with the scientific findings.
22	That voice in my opinion of the
23	tobacco industry, again, as it's disseminated to
24	the public declined significantly over time. By
0096
1	the 70s, the tobacco industry often has
2	statements, you know, regarding some of the
3	scientific studies asking sometimes for more
4	research.
5	It's a voice that I think really
6	diminishes over time in terms of the information
7	that's out there for the public. Certainly by
8	1984 I think the tobacco industry's voice is one
9	that has diminished significantly.
10	Q. Is it important to tell the truth?
11	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Is it important to tell the truth in
14	public statements?
15	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
16	A. Again, you're asking me personally or
17	as an expert witness?
18	Q. As an expert witness, is it
19	important -- as an expert witness, is it
20	important for you to rely upon truthful
21	information when you make your decisions in
22	cases?
23	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
24	A. As an expert witness, and I think I've
0097
1	gone over this a couple of times, I follow the
2	historical method, which, again, is about, you
3	know, seeking out a wide variety of sources,
4	making sure that you are approaching a
5	particular topic without bias, to try to be
6	aware if there is any bias, to be very conscious
7	to make sure that there isn't bias in the way
8	you approach a particular topic and, again, you
9	know, as a historian, as an expert witness to,
10	again, look at -- do as thorough job in your
11	research as you possibly can.
12	Q. Well, Mr. Horrigan was not telling the
13	truth in that Nightline interview with Ted
14	Koppel in 1984, was he?
15	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
16	A. Again, I'm a historian. I don't know
17	what Mr. Horrigan believed. I can't attest to
18	what he believed or didn't believe at that time.
19	Again, I think public awareness was
20	such that, again, if you read that -- see that
21	interview, you know, Ted Koppel seems rather
22	astonished at some of the things that
23	Mr. Horrigan is saying, and the other experts
24	seem just as -- you know, that public -- as I
0098
1	recall and certainly have read about in my
2	research in 1994, when the tobacco executives
3	said they didn't think tobacco was addictive, it
4	became a joke, you know. People like David
5	Letterman and the late night kinds of comics
6	were making jokes about it.
7	So, again, as a historian, I see that
8	and say, well, you know, if people think it's
9	ridiculous to make that kind of statement, that
10	seems to be the public reaction to, you know, a
11	statement that tobacco is not addictive, then
12	that's telling me that public awareness is such
13	that they think that tobacco is addictive and
14	cigarettes are addictive.
15	Q. You are not implying that 400,000
16	deaths per year according to the Surgeon General
17	from smoking cigarettes is a joke, you are not
18	implying that, are you?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. No, that's not what I said at all.
21	And that's certainly not what I meant to say.
22	I'm saying that when one looks at the
23	public reaction to the Waxman hearings, the fact
24	that the tobacco executives who said that were
0099
1	ridiculed. They were ridiculed by late night
2	comics. They were ridiculed in political
3	cartoons. They were ridiculed in Doonesbury,
4	the comic strip. That tells me that public
5	awareness is such that they discount that kind
6	of statement, that they believed smoking was
7	addictive.
8	Q. Do you know if George Ciccone knew
9	about the --
10	MS. LAWSON: I think the TV froze.
11	(Technical difficulties)
12	(Recess taken)
13	BY MS. LAWSON:
14	Q. I'm going to go a little quicker
15	because I don't want to take up necessarily too
16	much of your time, but I would like to continue
17	where we left off briefly.
18	Do you know of any evidence that
19	George Ciccone knew about the 1984 Nightline
20	interview with Ted Koppel?
21	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
22	A. Again, I don't know whether he watched
23	it. I know his wife mentioned that she had
24	watched it. I can't quite recall if they both
0100
1	watched it or not. I know it's mentioned in his
2	deposition. That's all I can recall at the
3	moment.
4	Q. Do you know whether George Ciccone
5	chose to believe the R.J. Reynolds executive
6	Horrigan or the doctors that were on that
7	program as to the risks of smoking? Do you know
8	one way or the other?
9	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
10	A. Again, you know, I don't know what
11	George Ciccone, you know, chose to believe or
12	not regarding that particular program.
13	I do know, again, based on his brother
14	Paul's testimony that they talked about the '64
15	Surgeon General's report. They talked the about
16	warning labels. And according to Paul, they
17	chose to ignore them.
18	Again, getting into belief. An
19	individual's belief is not my particular role in
20	this case. I'm talking about -- I've been asked
21	to research and come to conclusions about public
22	awareness.
23	George Ciccone is part of the public,
24	again, and I stress that, but what he chose to
0101
1	do with that information, again, is not in my
2	area.
3	Q. You would agree that there's a
4	difference between common knowledge and belief?
5	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
6	A. I think there is a difference between
7	common knowledge and belief, yes.
8	Q. What is your definition of common
9	knowledge?
10	A. I would define it the same way as I
11	defined public awareness, that it's based on,
12	you know, the information that's readily
13	available to people, that it's information,
14	again, that's broadly disseminated, deeply
15	disseminated, messages that are repeated,
16	echoed, reiterated over time.
17	And that common knowledge as well as
18	public awareness is really evident, again, in
19	the way that people talk about these issues.
20	The actions that they take also, again, are
21	evidence of things like public awareness or
22	common knowledge.
23	Q. Is there any scientific basis to your
24	definition of common knowledge and public
0102
1	awareness?
2	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
3	A. Again, I'm not sure what you mean by
4	scientific. I guess I'd ask you to define that.
5	I think of science as a different
6	field. I guess I just would like to know what
7	you mean by science, by scientific.
8	Q. In a history of science context, do
9	you know of any basis in a history of science
10	context for your definition of common knowledge
11	and public awareness?
12	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
13	A. Again, I think I've already said I'm
14	not a historian of science.
15	Q. Is there any historical basis for your
16	definition of common knowledge and public
17	awareness?
18	A. Yes.
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. It's a concept that I certainly use in
21	my own research. It's certainly a concept that
22	I use in my teaching.
23	Q. Did you just make it up, or is it
24	based on something else?
0103
1	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
2	A. No, I didn't make it up. It's
3	commonly used by historians.
4	Q. Commonly used by which historians?
5	A. Well, again, I'll speak for social
6	historians because that's what I am, that,
7	again, is my area of expertise, so I would say
8	it's commonly used by social historians.
9	Q. Okay. Can you point to a document,
10	any scholarly literature that supports your
11	definition of common knowledge and public
12	awareness?
13	A. I think it's something that is so
14	deeply embedded in social history. I think one
15	way that it's often portrayed or the label that
16	is sometimes put on it is mentalitie, which is a
17	concept, again, that comes from French
18	historians in the early Twentieth Century which
19	is a sense of, you know, recreating, and this is
20	crucial in social history, kind of recreating
21	the mental universe of people in any given, you
22	know, particular historical moment, again, what
23	kind of information was out there, what
24	information, you know, shaped their actions.
0104
1	Q. Is there any peer reviewed basis to
2	your definition of common knowledge or public
3	awareness that you are aware of?
4	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
5	A. Peer reviewed. I'm just not sure
6	right now. I can't come up with a title of a
7	book right at the moment.
8	Q. Other than that French book you just
9	talked about, can you point to any other
10	scholarly literature, articles of any sort that
11	support your common knowledge, public awareness
12	definition?
13	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
14	A. Again, just to clarify, it's not a
15	French book. This is a historical theory that
16	was actually constructed, conceptualized by
17	French historians. It's been used very widely
18	ever since in the early Twentieth Century.
19	Again, it's not a book that does this. It's a
20	concept.
21	I would say that I use it in I think
22	my own historical writing, I certainly, you
23	know, reference public awareness in the sense of
24	the book that you mentioned very early on this
0105
1	morning, my most recent book, First Fruits of
2	Freedom. You know, one of the things --1
3	certainly use the concept of public awareness in
4	that book when I am talking about sort of public
5	awareness regarding African Americans in the
6	North at the time of the civil war.
7	Again, I look at what kind of
8	information was out there. Uncle Tom's Cabin is
9	a big part of that universe of knowledge, of
10	information that's out there that help shape
11	people's ideas about African Americans and
12	slaves.
13	And one of the things I do in that
14	book is talk about how white soldiers who
15	marched South, you know, what their sort of
16	public awareness is or their common knowledge,
17	either one, about black people. And I show, you
18	know, what they -- how they thought, you know,
19	what their common knowledge was about African
20	Americans. And I show over the course of my
21	book how some of that changes over time and why
22	it changes over time.
23	So certainly that concept is deeply
24	embedded in my own research and writing.
0106
1	Q. Aside from this French theory from the
2	1800s, are you aware of any other commonly
3	accepted definitions of common knowledge?
4	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
5	A. Again, it's not from the Eighteenth
6	Century. I'm sorry to keep correcting you. I
7	don't want to be a nickeling historian here, but
8	it really was from the 1920's and '30s that
9	mentalitie is actually being -- that idea is
10	being disseminated among historians and
11	historians have adopted it ever since.
12	Q. Let me try the question a different
13	way.
14	Other than this French theory from the
15	1920s, are there any other commonly accepted
16	definitions of common knowledge that are widely
17	used in the social sciences?
18	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
19	A. Again, I use it in my --1 speak out
20	of my experience as a professor and writer. I
21	use it all the time when I teach.
22	I tell students -- one of the hardest
23	things we have to do as students of history is,
24	you know, trying to transport ourselves back
0107
1	into kind of the mental universe of any given
2	historic period and not to impose our own ideas
3	upon them.
4	And the way we do that is to look at
5	the information environment that was out there,
6	the information that people had access to.
7	So it's something I teach all the
8	time. It's probably the hardest thing that we
9	do as students of history is trying to recreate
10	that mental universe. It's crucial to
11	understanding people in the past because they
12	didn't think the same way we do. They didn't
13	have access to the same knowledge, same
14	information that we do. They didn't take away,
15	you know, their various kinds of beliefs from
16	that information that we have.
17	So, again, I think it's something
18	that's just deeply embedded in the study of
19	history.
20	Q. I don't respectfully think you
21	answered my question, but I'll try it one more
22	time.
23	MR. WICHMANN: Madam court
24	reporter, could you read back my last question
0108
1	to the doctor, please.
2	(Record read)
3	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
4	A. Again, I speak as a historian. I'm
5	not a sociologist, I'm not an economist, again,
6	thinking about other aspects of social sciences.
7	I have defined the term I think very
8	clearly. I have shown, I think, how I've used
9	it and how historians use it. I certainly am
10	not alone, I hope I've made the point, in using
11	this concept and teaching it.
12	I cannot speak to the other social
13	sciences because I'm not, you know, an expert in
14	those particular disciplines.
15	Q. Other than this French theory from the
16	1920s, are there any other commonly accepted
17	definitions of common knowledge used in the
18	historical context?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. Again, I think I've explained how I
21	define it, how I use it, how other social
22	historians use it, and that's what I can speak
23	to.
24	Q. Okay. Are you aware of any other
0109
1	possible definitions out there for the term in
2	your area of expertise, or is what you have
3	described for us today the black letter law when
4	it comes to the definition of common knowledge?
5	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
6	A. No, I don't think there is a black
7	letter law when it comes to common knowledge.
8	I think any historian, and I think
9	it's probably true in any discipline, it's
10	crucial that you define your terms, and it's
11	clear in your research and your -- the
12	conclusions that you draw how you define your
13	terms.
14	And I think I have. I think it's very
15	clear how I've defined my terms, and I think --
16	again, I think I've given you some good examples
17	as to how I incorporate the notion of common
18	knowledge or public awareness in my own
19	research, how I've incorporated it in my
20	teaching and how other social historians
21	incorporate it.
22	Q. Let's talk about what we can agree on.
23	A. Okay.
24	Q. Can we agree that historians should
0110
1	consider wide variety of sources?
2	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
3	A. Again, I think that's generally true,
4	that you do look at a wide variety of sources.
5	But it's very much dependent upon the
6	research question that you're pursuing. Some
7	sources are obviously going to be relevant,
8	others are not. That's part of what you have to
9	do as a historian.
10	Q. Can we agree that as a historian, it's
11	important for you to approach a subject without
12	bias?
13	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
14	A. I would agree that historians should
15	approach topics without bias.
16	Q. And we've already agreed, I think,
17	that there is a difference between common
18	knowledge and belief?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	BY MR. WICHMANN:
21	Q. Correct?
22	A. Yes, I do think there's a difference.
23	Q. You did list the Surgeon General's
24	report on your resource list, correct?
0111
1	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
2	A. Several of them. Which one are you
3	referring to?
4	Q. I think it's Exhibit 1 to this
5	deposition.
6	MS. LAWSON: I think the question
7	was which Surgeon General's report.
8	A. Which Surgeon General's report?
9	Q. Did you not list the Surgeon General's
10	report on your resource list?
11	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
12	A. I listed a number of them. I was
13	asking which one you were referring to
14	specifically.
15	Q. How about the 1989 one.
16	A. Yes, I did.
17	Q. Did you read chapter four of the 1984
18	Surgeon General's report?
19	A. I did read that Surgeon General's
20	report, so I assume that I did read that
21	chapter.
22	Q. Do you agree or disagree with the
23	Surgeon General where he wrote in 1989 that
24	there was little data to support the idea that
0112
1	people believe the US Surgeon General determined
2	cigarette smoking was dangerous to health?
3	Would you agree with that?
4	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
5	A. And I don't agree -- no, I don't agree
6	with that statement.
7	Again, I would have to look at the
8	Surgeon General's report. I am not sure --1
9	don't know what the context of that particular
10	quote is. So, again, you know, I would have to
11	see it and see the context.
12	But, again, based on my research, I
13	think my research stands on its own, again,
14	about how broadly disseminated this message was.
15	So much so that in 1964 when that report came
16	out, when the Surgeon General Terry says there's
17	a causal link between smoking and lung cancer in
18	men, the Worcester Telegram says, you know, this
19	wasn't anything -- anything that anyone didn't
20	expect.
21	And, again, that's something that gets
22	repeated in a number of places, a number of
23	editorials. The Boston Herald also has some
24	responses that way. Time Magazine says the same
0113
1	thing, well, we knew, this just confirms it,
2	this is now just coming from the Surgeon General
3	sort of making it official. So, again, in terms
4	of your specific quote, I would need to look at
5	that in context.
6	But, again, given the research that
7	I've done and in a wide variety of sources, the
8	fact that Ann Landers, Dear Abby, Dear
9	Dr. columns are constantly telling people to
10	quit smoking, it's bad for them, it's addictive,
11	my conclusions are that there was public
12	awareness regarding the dangers of cigarette
13	smoking.
14	Q. So is it fair to say you would
15	disagree with this statement, that statement
16	being in 1989, substantial numbers of smokers
17	were still unaware of or did not accept
18	important health risks of smoking?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. Again, I'll say I would need to see
21	where that sentence is in the Surgeon General's
22	report, what the context of that particular
23	statement was before I would comment on it.
24	And secondly, I'm not sure how
0114
1	substantial is being defined there. There would
2	be too many questions there for me to say yes or
3	no.
4	Again, I think I've made it clear
5	where I stand and where my research led me --
6	the conclusions my research led me to.
7	Q. Exhibit Number 3, your disclosure,
8	would you refer to that, please?
