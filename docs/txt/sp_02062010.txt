MR. KOETHE:
Why don't we -- we'll go
2 on the transcript and then after we get a
3 few things on the record, we'll pause and
4 let the video start.
5
We're here today for the trial
6 preservation testimony of Dr. Lisa Cobbs
7 Hoffman in the Lucille Soffer versus
8 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco case.
9
Professor Hoffman will be out of the
10 country during the trial in this matter, so
11 we are seeking to preserve her testimony on
12 videotape today.
13
I've spoken with plaintiff's counsel,
14 and I think we've agreed that objections,
15 except as to form -- all objections, except
16 as to form, will be reserved, and those can
17 be made later at the time of trial.
18
We have provided today plaintiff's
19 counsel with a set of the demonstrative
20 exhibits that we intend to use during the
21 course of the presentation, as well as a
22 set of the documents which underlie the
23 presentation.
24
25
We've agreed that after the
completion of the testimony, I will -- and
229
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 off video, I don't think we need to be on
2 video for that -- I will read into the
3 record and provide the court reporter a
4 copy of all of the underlying documents
5 that we have used with the witness today.
6 And, again, I think subject to the pretrial
7 agreement, all other objections would be
8 preserved with respect to those documents.
9
Likewise, we have requested that
10 plaintiff's counsel provide to us copies of
11 the documents that they intend to use on
12 cross-examination, and we would preserve
13 all objections to those separate and apart
14 or at least outside of what we've agreed to
15 in a pretrial statement.
16 preserve our objections to documents that
17 are used on cross for which we do not
18 have -- are not provided copies of.
19 going to try to work that out over lunch
20 and get a set of materials that plaintiffs
21 are going to use on the cross.
22
23
24
25
And I want to
We're
Cal, is there anything else you want
or need to add to that?
MR. WARRINER:
No.
The only thing is
that my request is -- it appears, I've been
230
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 told that we're going to have one camera on
2 a big video screen that's going to be
3 playing various things on the video,
4 PowerPoint slides, tapes, videos,
5 et cetera, and another camera on the
6 witness, and for trial purposes it's my
7 request and I would argue to the judge our
8 right to have the witness on the screen at
9 all times while testifying as if in a
10 courtroom.
11 trial presentation out of that, that's
12 fine, split screen, two screens, whatever
13 the case may be, but what I want to avoid
14 is having a screen with a video or a
15 PowerPoint and just a talking head
16 somewhere not on camera, because that's
17 just not right.
18
However they want to make a
MR. KOETHE:
I think that's it for
19 our preliminary statements, and we can go
20 ahead and start the video.

Why don't we set forth for the record

EXAMINATION
BY MR. KOETHE:
6 Q. Good morning.
7 A. Good morning.
8 Q. Professor Hoffman, could you please state
9
10
your name and tell the jury what you do for a living.
A.
Yes.
My name is Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman,
11 and I'm a professor of history, so I teach history,
12 and I'm also a historian, which means I write books
13 of history.
14 Q. Okay.
15 A. I teach history at San Diego State
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
And where do you teach history?
University in California.
Q.
And how long have you been teaching
history?
A.
I've been teaching history for
approximately 22 years.
Q.
And do you hold a special position in the
history department at San Diego State University?
23 A. Yes, I do.
24 Q. Could you tell us --
25 A. I am the Dwight Stanford professor of
233
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 history, and that's an endowed chair at San Diego
2 State.
3
4
5
Q.
Okay.
Professor, could you briefly tell
us what you're here to talk about today.
A.
Yes.
I'm here to talk about what people
6 knew about the hazards of smoking during Mr. Soffer's
7 lifetime, including the hazard of addiction and lung
8 cancer and the risks of heart disease and other sorts
9 of health problems, and also how they came to know
10
11
that information.
Q.
And did you research in this case the ways
12 in which information was communicated to the public
13 during Mr. Soffer's lifetime about the dangers of
14 cigarette smoking?
15
16
17
A.
Yes.
I did extensive research on how
people came to know this information.
Q.
And is the topic of public attitudes and
18 awareness something that you studied in your other
19 historical work?
20
21
22
A.
Yes, it is.
I have studied that quite a
bit, depending on the topic.
Q.
Could you briefly explain or give us an
23 example of how you have looked at the issue of public
24 attitudes and awareness in connection with some of
25 the other work that you've done as a historian?
234
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
A.
Sure.
I can give you a couple of examples
that come readily to my mind.
3
I did some research a while ago on
4 World War II, for example, and how attitudes towards
5 U.S. involvement in that war changed during the
6 1930s.
7 Congressional testimony and polls by Gallup and
8 magazine articles and that kind of thing.
And so I looked at newspapers and
9
In addition, I wrote a book on the history
10 of the Peace Corps, and there I also looked at the
11 various ways that people came to have the same idea
12 around the same time.
13
Q.
Now, in doing your work in this case,
14 looking at public attitudes and awareness about the
15 dangers of smoking, did you generally follow the same
16 type of procedure that you used to study public
17 attitudes about -- in the World War II work and the
18 Peace Corps work that you did?
19
A.
Yes, I would use exactly the same methods,
20 in fact.
Every project starts, in a way starts out
21 the same.
You have the same process by which you
22 proceed to develop expertise in a subject so that you
23 can, you know, come to reasonable and verifiable
24 conclusions.
25 Q.
Now, before we get into your actual
235
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 opinions today, let's talk a little bit about your
2 credentials and experience.
3 degree and a Ph. degree in the field of history; is
4 that correct?
5
6
7
8
9
10
A.
Yes.
You have a master's
I have both a master's degree and a
Ph.D. in American history.
Q.
And where did you get your master's degree
and Ph.D.?
A.
I got both degrees at Stanford University
in Stanford, California, Palo Alto.
11 Q. And when you did you get your Ph.D.?
12 A. I received my Ph.D. in 1988.
13 Q. And you've been a practicing and teaching
14
professional historian since 1988, I take it?
15 A. Yes, I have.
16 Q. And as part of your duties at San Diego
17 State, do you teach courses on the history of the
18 United States?
19 A. Yes, many courses.
20 Q. Could you briefly describe just a few of
21 them for us?
22 A.
Sure.
Well, the most basic I've taught
23 over the years, we would call American Civilization,
24 which is the fir -- and I've taught both first half
25 and the second half, and so that would be from the
236
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 founding of the country all the way up to the
2 present.
3
I've also taught some specialized topics
4 like the history of the 1960s, which includes both
5 the '50s and the '60s, and I've taught classes on
6 women in the family, racism and nativism in American
7 history, U.S. foreign relations, historical methods,
8 that kind of thing.
9
10
11
12
13
Q.
Have you taught courses in U.S. business
and economic history?
A.
Yes, I have also taught U.S. business
history.
Q.
Have you taught courses in college in
14 which the history of tobacco and cigarettes have been
15 a part of the class?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. Now, in addition to teaching U.S. history
18 courses, have you held any other positions of
19 responsibility at the university level?
20
A.
Yes, I have.
To give you an example, I've
21 been at San Diego State for approximately ten years,
22 and the ten years before that, I was at the
23 University of San Diego, and there I became chair of
24 the history department.
25
Q.
Can you tell us briefly about some of the
237
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
books that you've written in the field of history?
A.
Yeah.
I've written several books in the
3 field of history.
4 Yale University Press.
5 and that was called The Rich Neighbor Policy.
6 about U.S. relations with Latin America during
7 World War II.
8
9
My first book was published by
That won actually two prizes,
It was
I've written a book on the history of the
Peace Corps, as I previously mentioned.
That was
10 published by Harvard University Press in the year
11 2000, was the paperback edition.
12
I have also published a textbook, and I
13 just completed a third edition of that textbook.
14 It's called Major Problems in American History.
15 major problems, what we would mean is large issues in
16 American history such -- on the scale of
17 World War II, World War I, the Civil War,
18 progressivism, the 1960s and things like that.
19 that's a textbook that I published, and we're just
20 finishing the third edition.
21
By
So
And most recently, I'm on the verge of
22 publishing a historical novel on the Civil War, and
23 that will be published by Random House next April.
24
25
Q.
And the textbook on U.S. history that you
mentioned, is that something that is used by college
238
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
students in courses on U.S. history?
2 A.
3 widely.
4 that textbook.
5
6
Q.
Yes, it is.
It's used actually very
We've sold over a hundred thousand copies of
And have you also written scholarly
articles and essays in the field of history?
7 A. Yes, I have.
8 Q. And have these articles appeared in
9
peer-reviewed journals?
10 A. Yes, they have.
11 Q. And have you yourself served as a peer
12 reviewer and judge of the written work of others in
13 the field of history?
14 A. Oh, yes, many times.
15 Q. And can you just briefly describe a little
16
bit about that for us?
17
A.
Sure.
Well, probably most exciting
18 version of that would have been when I sat on the
19 Pulitzer Prize committee, the jury for the Pulitzer
20 Prize in American history about a year and a half
21 ago.
22 sat down and read 120 books.
23 So that's where you judge the quality of a work.
That's a three-person jury nationwide, and we
24
25
It was quite daunting.
For articles, I'm often sent articles to
review.
I just did this about two weeks ago where a
239
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 major journal -- I think this one was the Journal of
2 American History -- asked me, can you please vet this
3 article and see if it stands up.
4
Q.
And when you're serving as a peer reviewer
5 or a jury member on the Pulitzer Prize, what
6 generally are your responsibilities in that regard?
7
A.
Well, the responsibility of a reviewer is
8 to analyze the work in the context of how well it
9 would meet the standards of the historical
10 profession, the standards in terms of research, the
11 standards in terms of evidence, and whether or not
12 its conclusions can be verified and would stand
13 scrutiny from a jury of peers.
14
Q.
And do you belong to any groups or
15 organizations in the field of history, and give us a
16 few examples?
17
A.
Sure.
I belong -- I'm a member of the
18 American Historical Association, the Organization of
19 American Historians.
20 Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations,
21 Pacific Council on International Policy and groups
22 like that.
23
24
25
Q.
That's a separate group.
The
That's what I can recall offhand.
And have you served in any professional
capacity for the United States government?
A.
Yes, I have.
240
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Q. And can you tell us briefly about that?
2 A. Sure.
I was -- for six years, I was a
3 member for two terms of what's called the Historical
4 Advisory Committee to the U.S. State Department, and
5 that's a committee appointed by the U.S. Congress to
6 essentially rule and evaluate the Department of
7 State's process for declassifying secret documents so
8 that the American public has an open and transparent
9 record of what our government has done over the
10
years.
11
Q.
And have you received any grants,
12 fellowships, or other awards for your work as a
13 historian, and can you describe a few of those for
14 us?
15
16
17
A.
Sure.
Yes, I've received a number of
awards for my work as a historian.
Probably the first of those was a prize I
18 read for writing what was considered the best
19 dissertation in American history during the year that
20 I graduated from college from my Ph.D. program.
21 won a few book prizes.
So I
22 I also was granted a Fulbright.
23 a distinguished Fulbright position, and I was invited
24 to teach American history in Ireland.
25 several years ago.
This was
That was
241
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
I've also received grants from such a
2 variety of groups such as, you know, the government
3 of Canada, the Organization of American States, the
4 American Philosophical Society, the Woodrow Wilson
5 Center, International Center for Scholars and
6 organizations like that.
7
8
Q.
Have you previously testified as an expert
historian in smoking and health cases?
9 A. Yes, I have.
10 Q. And how many times have you testified at
11
trial?
12 A. I've testified once before at trial.
13 Q. Now, in the previous work that you've done
14 in smoking and health cases, what was the subject
15 area of your testimony?
16
17
18
A.
The subject area of my testimony is
precisely the same subject as it is today.
Q.
And for how many years have you been doing
19 research on the topic of public awareness of the
20 health risks of smoking?
21 A. Approximately 11 years, since late 1999.
22 Q. And do you charge for the time you spend
23
doing historical research?
24 A. Yes, I do.
25 Q. And what is your hourly rate?
242
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. My hourly rate is $250 an hour.
2 Q. Over the course of the past 11 years or
3 so, approximately how many hours would you say you've
4 spent researching and analyzing this issue of public
5 awareness of the dangers of cigarette smoking?
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
A.
Over the last 11 years, well more than a
thousand hours.
Q.
Now, Professor Hoffman, is there a
recognized method that's used by historians to study
and analyze the past?
A.
Yes, there is a recognized method.
It's
called the historical method.
Q.
Could you briefly describe for the jury
the steps involved in the historical method?
A.
Certainly.
The historical method -- I
16 will try to be brief, because this is a class I
17 actually teach and have taught to graduate and
18 undergraduate students, so it can take months.
19
But essentially it's a method that you use
20 to achieve consistency in results.
21 question, and this is actually -- it sounds like a
22 simple part of the process, but it's probably the
23 hardest part of the process.
24 carefully formulate your question so you know the
25 exact parameters of what you're looking for.
You start with a
You have to very
I tell
243
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 students that when you're doing research, you are
2 searching for something, and if you don't know what
3 you're searching for, you can wander all over the
4 map.
So you have a very careful question.
5
Then the question itself tells you --
6 suggests what sources you'll need to answer the
7 question.
8 identify sources and you identify where they are.
9 They might be -- if they're kind of a one-of-a-kind
So that's the next thing you do is you
10 sort of thing, they might be in a dusty archive, you
11 know, on the other side of the country.
12 you have to go to archives.
13 of us, of course, get some information even over the
14 Internet or in libraries.
15
So sometimes
Other times, today many

21 source came from, whether that source -- how reliable
22 that particular source was.

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

(212) 490-34301 you look at the bulk of the information and what the
2 trends suggest, you can then come to conclusions
3 about the materials, and that's when you answer your
4 question.
5
Q.
Now, by following the historical method,
6 does this permit you as a historian to reach accurate
7 and reliable conclusions about the past?
8 A. Yes, it does.
9 Q. And I think you mentioned you actually
10 teach a course on historical research methodology to
11 students; is that right?
12 A. Yes, I do.
13 Q. And I think you mentioned as part of the
14 historical method, you analyze and evaluate various
15 historical sources; is that right?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. And did you review and evaluate historical
18
sources in this case?
19 A. Yes, very, very many historical sources.
20 Q. Are you familiar with the term "historical
21
context"?
22 A. Yes, I am.
23 Q. And what does historical context mean?
24 A. Historical context means the environment
25
in which something happened, so that if you look at a
245

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 document, for example, or if you look at some -- an
2 expression, a slang expression, let's say, you have
3 to look at it in the context in which it occurred.
4 One of the probably easiest dangers of historical
5 research by amateurs is to take something out of
6 context and not understand, you know, how it either
7 supports or is not supported by the context.
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
Q.
Looking at things in context, is that the
same as looking at the bigger picture?
A.
Yeah.
I'd say looking at the bigger
picture is a good way of saying it.
Q.
And why is context or the bigger picture
important to a historian?
A.
Well, because I think we've all heard the
15 phrase "taking something out of context."
16 take something out of context, it's very easy to
17 misunderstand what occurred in that period of time.
18
Q.
If you
Did you follow the historical method here
19 to study the information that was available to people
20 like Mr. Soffer about the dangers of smoking during
21 his lifetime?
22
A.
Yes, I did.
I started with the same basic
23 process. In a way, it's kind of almost a clean sheet
24 of paper. You -- to formulate your question and then
25 you follow the procedure that you followed in all
246
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
other cases of historical research.
Q.
So the work you did here, you followed the
3 same approach that you used to do historical research
4 on topics other than smoking?
5
6
7
A.
Yes.
It would be the same procedures I
have used for my books and for my articles.
Q.
Professor, did you bring a chart with you
8 today that describes some of the different ways that
9 information about the dangers of smoking were
10
communicated to people during Mr. Soffer's lifetime?
11 A. Yes, I did.
12 Q. And would you please step down and show
13
the jury the chart that you put together.
14
15
MR. KOETHE:
could pull up Hoffman 1, please.
16
17
THE WITNESS:
20
Thank you.
I'll carry
my wires here with me.
18
19
And, Deverick, if you
This is my first chart, and I put it
up over here on the easel.
And this --
BY MR. KOETHE:
21 Q. Could you describe --
22 A. Yes, I'd be delighted to do so.
This
23 chart essentially gives you the sweep of information
24 that I considered in this particular case.
25 said, it's similar to information I might consider
As I
247
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 for other kinds of topics, depending on the topic.
2 In my case what I was looking at is what the public
3 knew about the hazards of smoking, including
4 addiction and lung cancer and such things, but also
5 how they found out, how they knew that.
6 sometimes we know something and we're not even quite
7 sure how we know.
8
9
Because
So in this case, I started out with family
and friends.
Well, that's because that's where we
10 all start is in a family, and we learn things from
11 our parents.
12 children.
13 generals found over the years and other researchers,
14 that a lot of what people learned about smoking was
15 something they learned at home.
16
Sometimes we learn things from our
This was certainly true, our surgeon
And this was also true for Mr. Soffer.
17 His family testified that -- his wife, for example,
18 told him that it was harmful for him -- harmful for
19 him, both of his wives, that his children told him it
20 was bad for him, but also that he educated his own
21 five children not to smoke.
22 are very important for understanding how people learn
23 things.
24
25
So family and friends
Schools came next because, of course,
where we go after our family is into school.
I think
248
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 there's some popular book like, you know, I Learned
2 All I Ever Needed to Know About Life in Kindergarten.
3 So taking off on that theme, schools are important,
4 and there I research school laws, school policies,
5 school textbooks to see the kinds of things that
6 Mr. Soffer and the people of his generation would
7 have known about smoking or would have been told by
8 schools, because schools are where we intentionally
9 educate people, where we tell them the things that
10 we've decided are important as a -- as a society and
11 then we try to inculcate in our children.
12
Popular culture is another important part
13 of this.
14 this case the popular culture would include things
15 like movies and television, slang words, all the
16 things that happen to us all the time all around us.
17 And so that was an important part of that.
18 also, again, this is something I've looked at for
19 other topics I've done, and of course, the
20 Peace Corps would have been a good example of that,
21 how young people become idealistic, what are the
22 ideas that they held at that time.
23
We all live and swim in a world, and so in
That's
Newspapers and magazines, this is also
24 very useful because -- and especially, by the way, in
25 the period of time I'm looking at here in the 1950s,
249
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 the 1960s, we didn't have computers, we didn't have
2 Internet, so people went for information to places
3 that are a little different from what we do today.
4 And so to avoid the, what historians call presencism,
5 we try to look at the actual documents from that
6 period of time.
7
And so newspapers and magazines.
This also, by the way, fits for
8 Mr. Soffer, because he was a very avid reader.
9 wife testified that he would read his magazines and
10
11
His
then hers.
Television, of course, is another part of
12 this and especially beginning in the 1950s,
13 television was critical for public awareness, public
14 knowledge, public understanding of events.
15 were only a couple of news -- pardon me, couple of
16 networks at that time.
17
There
Public health and private organizations,
18 now that's another thing where this reflects our
19 history as a nation, and so that's the context in
20 which Mr. Soffer grew up and matured.
21 context private organizations are really important,
22 much more important than most other countries around
23 the world, in fact.
24 as Americans in the fact that groups like the
25 American Cancer Society, American Lung Association,
And in this
We kind of take a little pride
250
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 American Medical Association and groups like that
2 have a big sway in our lives.
3
Religious organizations are also
4 important.
5 Mr. Soffer himself was a very observant Jewish
6 person, and so that was important to look at too.
7
Americans tend be very religious.
And lastly, government.
Government makes
8 these larger laws.
9 for much of what happens in a society and they
10
11
Government again sets the tone
regulate, so I look at government as issues as well.
Q.
12
Okay.
Thank you.
Have you prepared another chart which
13 summarizes in a little more detail the specific
14 sources of materials that you looked at in this case?
15 A.
Yes, I have.
16 Q.
Could you pull that up for us, please?
17 A.
Get it out.
18 things.
19 those pictures I showed you, but also to be a little
20 bit more specific pertaining to the actual materials
21 that I looked at.
22 in general, although I did that in a number of
23 states, but in this case I wanted to look at
24 Pennsylvania educational materials because Mr. Soffer
25 was born and grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
These are large, awkward
I made up this chart again to reinforce
So I didn't look at just schools
251
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 So I looked at both state documents for the whole
2 state of Pennsylvania but also Philadelphia
3 educational materials.
4
In addition, I looked at popular culture
5 focusing, of course, on this period of time.
6 Magazines, some of the magazines in particular that
7 the Soffer family subscribed to and took on a regular
8 basis.
9
Same with newspapers.
Here with
10 newspapers, these are a few examples of the places
11 that Mr. Soffer lived and his family lived in the
12 course of his lifetime, Philadelphia, Texas,
13 California, New York, of course Florida, most
14 importantly, or at the end of his life.
15
Polls and surveys, that's another part of
16 the historical record.
17 kind of polls, Gallup polls, Harris polls, et cetera.
18
And I looked at those various
Television and film, as I mentioned, and
19 there I looked at especially the programs that I knew
20 that Mr. Soffer's family had testified watching
21 together often, so CBS, NBC, et cetera, ABC.
22
Religious organizations, I've mentioned
23 that before.
24 looked at a lot of records from the American Cancer
25 Society and groups like that.
Voluntary health organizations.
I
U.S. government and
252
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 state government materials, and, of course,
2 importantly, the Soffer case materials.
3 would be primarily depositions that I was given that

A.
down so I'm ready to go the next time.
Q.
Thank you.
Now, the materials that you've shown us in
10 these first two slides, are these the types of things
11 that a historian would typically rely upon to study
12 historical questions like the ones that you were
13 asked to research here in this case?
14 A. Yes, very much so.
15 Q. And do you rely solely on any one of these
16
17
sources of information for your opinions?
A.
No, I don't, and I wouldn't.
That would
18 not be a professional method.
19 back to the question of context.
20 thing, you're taking it out of context, so it's very
21 important to put all the evidence together to see as
22 a mass what it -- what it leads you to conclude.
23
Q.
And again, that goes
If you take any one
Now, you mentioned that you looked at some
24 of the case materials and depositions in the case.
25 Can you tell us just very generally what did you
253
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 learn about the kinds of information available to
2 Mr. Soffer during his life from your review of the
3 case materials?
4
A.
Well, I learned quite a bit actually.
One
5 thing I learned is that Mr. Soffer was a very avid
6 reader, apparently he read all the time.
7 reading the daily newspaper.
8 daily newspaper many places that they lived, and he
9 lived all over the United States.
Enjoyed
He liked -- took the
Sometimes he would
10 take two newspapers in a day, would go down and get
11 the Sunday edition of another paper when -- you know,
12 when he ran out of things to read, I suppose,
13 so -- and he read a lot of magazines.
14 watched television.
15
He also
And, you know, he seemed -- and he also
16 seemed a very gregarious person too, from all the
17 descriptions that I read, which goes back also to the
18 question of question of the context of family and
19 friends.
20 in particular I recall testifying that he warned
21 Mr. Soffer, for example, about his smoking.
22 looked at -- I learned a lot from those depositions.
23
Q.
And his neighbors testified -- one neighbor
Thank you.
And so I
Professor Hoffman, based on
24 your historical research, have you formed an opinion
25 to a reasonable degree of professional certainty
254
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 about the information that was publicly communicated
2 and available to people like Mr. Soffer during his
3 lifetime about the health risks of cigarette smoking?
4 A. Yes, I have.
5 Q. And what is your opinion?
6 A. My opinion is that based on the voluminous
7 evidence that I have is that there was a massive
8 amount of information available to Mr. Soffer, to his
9 family and to his generation about the hazards of
10 smoking, including the risks of addiction, of lung
11 cancer, of heart disease, of circulatory problems and
12 any number of other ailments, small birth weight, the
13 list could go on, and that this information was
14 presented from a wide variety of sources throughout
15 this period of time, and that therefore, this
16 generation was very well informed about the problems
17 of smoking and addiction.
18
19
20
Q.
summarizes these conclusions?
A.
21
22
23
24
25
And did you prepare a chart which
Yes, I did.
MR. KOETHE:
Deverick, could you pull
up Hoffman 3, please.
BY MR. KOETHE:

And why don't you just briefly go through
the chart that you prepared here.
255
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
A.
Well, this summary of my opinions I think
2 says it more concisely than I probably just did, that
3 there has been a massive amount of information from
4 many different sources that was communicated very
5 openly, very clearly, very explicitly to Mr. Soffer
6 and people like him about the serious health risks of
7 smoking.
8 serious diseases, including lung cancer, premature
9 death, and that smoking could be addictive or some
And this could include many diseases,
10 people would have called it habit-forming and
11 difficult to quit.
12
Q.
Thank you.
Based on the amount and type
13 of information that you discovered in your research,
14 do you have an opinion as to how difficult it would
15 have been for someone living in the time period and
16 the places that Mr. Soffer did to have missed this
17 information?
18 A.
It would have been extremely difficult.
I
19 think it would have been impossible.
20 been like being out in a rainstorm, walking down the
21 street.
22 it was like the air people would breathe.
23 from every source, so much that people often, again,
24 don't necessarily remember when or where or how they
25 learned it, but they just know it.
It would have
It -- you know, it would have -- you know,
It came
256
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Q. Now, when was Mr. Soffer born?
2 A. He was born in 1935.
3 Q. In doing your historical research, did you
4 find any public discussion or opposition to tobacco
5 even before 1935 when Mr. Soffer was born?
6
A.
Yes.
There is actually a very long
7 history of opposition to tobacco use, and it goes
8 right back to 1492 virtually and 1493, a short few
9 months after the discovery of the New World, which is
10 where tobacco was first cultivated and used.
11 Spaniards began smoking it and found right off the
12 first -- the first thing they learned about it is
13 that once they started, they had a hard time
14 quitting.
15 were the first health hazard that was well known.
16 And from the beginning, government came out against
17 it.
18
So the addictive properties of tobacco
So lots of long history of that.
And that's true also in the United States,
19 to give one important example, to me at least, of
20 this was our very first surgeon general, who was the
21 surgeon general of the Continental Army under George
22 Washington, and that man was Dr. Benjamin Rush of
23 Philadelphia.
24 it's addictive and that it's bad for your health.
25 there have been a lot of movements and government
And he said smoking is carcinogenic,
So

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

(212) 490-34301
2
reports over the years.
Q.
Now, as a result of this opposition to
3 tobacco, were any prohibition laws passed in the
4 United States relating to cigarettes?
5
A.
Yes, there were a lot of prohibition acts
6 that were passed.
7 well known, right around the time that states were
8 prohibiting alcohol, there were 16 states that
9 prohibited cigarette smoking for everybody, for
For example, this is often not
10 adults, for children, and that banned cigarettes
11 altogether.
12 states considered doing it, so an even greater number
13 debated this subject.
14 in Florida as well, so a number of states prohibited
15 smoking.
16
Q.
So 16 states did that.
Twenty-two
So that was true, by the way,
Did Florida pass a law which prohibited
17 the manufacture and sale of cigarettes back in the
18 past?
19
20
A.
Yes, Florida did pass -- Florida did pass
such a law.
21 Q. And when did that law take place?
22 A. In Florida, it took place in 1899.
23 Q. Were you able to determine from your
24 research why states like Florida enacted such
25 prohibition laws?
258
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Yes, I was.
2 Q. And what did you find?
3 A. I found that all of the statements were
4 that essentially, or almost all the statements were
5 that tobacco was injurious, as they put it,
6 poisonous, noxious, that it was bad for people's
7 health and that the state felt that they should
8 prohibit it.
9 Q.
10
Now, Mr. Soffer grew up in Pennsylvania,
you mentioned?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Did Pennsylvania have any laws relating to
13 the sale of cigarettes to minors, and can you briefly
14 describe that for us?
15
A.
Yes, they did, and in fact, what happens,
16 because your jury's probably asking themselves why
17 don't we still have those laws, over time they
18 found -- the states decided essentially to prohibit
19 it to minors, and so the prohibitions for adults were
20 taken off, but they kept it on minors, on children.
21 And so in Pennsylvania the first law to prohibit the
22 sale or gift of tobacco to minors was in 1913.
23 law also provided, by the way, that if a minor was
24 caught with tobacco and the minor refused to say who
25 gave it to him or sold it to him or her, that that
That
259
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 minor could be arrested for misdemeanor and fined and
2 imprisoned, so it was a very serious law.
3
Q.
And were these laws against the sale of
4 cigarettes to minors in effect when Mr. Soffer was
5 growing up in Pennsylvania?
6
A.
Yes, they were in effect and they were
7 periodically refined and strengthened.
8 throughout Mr. Soffer's boyhood, this -- cigarette
9 smoking by minors would have been illegal.
10
Q.
So all
Let's talk about the educational materials
11 that you reviewed.
12 school?
13 A.
Where did Mr. Soffer attend
Mr. Soffer grew up and attended school and
14 graduated from high school in Philadelphia,
15 Pennsylvania.
16
Q.
When Mr. Soffer was going to school in
17 Philadelphia, were there any requirements that the
18 health risks of smoking be taught in the schools?
19
A.
Yes, there were such requirements.
And
20 Philadel -- pardon me, Pennsylvania in this respect
21 is similar to all of the other states, including
22 Florida, which required that from the -- actually the
23 late 1900s, or the 1800s, pardon me, from 1885
24 forward to the present, Pennsylvania has had a law
25 requiring students to be taught the hazards of
260
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 smoking, the, you know, medical risks of it, and also
2 to be educated not to smoke, to choose not to.
3
Q.
Now, pursuant to these laws, did the
4 boards of education throughout Pennsylvania adopt
5 specific school books that were to be used in the
6 schools to teach about the dangers of smoking?
7
A.
Yes.
Pennsylvania -- the states can be
8 kind of grouped into two groups, states where the
9 state mandates a specific textbook and states where
10 the state gives a small range of textbooks that
11 teachers can choose from.
12
Pennsylvania and Philadelphia fall into
13 that second category, so the school board of
14 Philadelphia would decide on what books would be
15 allowed for teachers to use.
16 small universe of books that kids were supposed to
17 read and teachers were supposed to use by law.
18
Q.
Okay.
And so you have a very
Now, do you have a slide that shows
19 some of these early educational requirements in
20 Pennsylvania?
21
A.
22
23
24
25
Yes, I do.
MR. KOETHE:
Can you pull up Hoffman
4, please.
BY MR. KOETHE:
Q.
And why don't you briefly describe this
261
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
slide.
A.
Okay, yes, I'd be happy to.
This
3 law -- and I'm going to use my handy-dandy little
4 pointer here.
5
There it is.
This is the school laws of Pennsylvania,
6 and this is from the year 1937.
7 well, why this year?
8 born in 1935, so this sets the context, that
9 all-important historical context.
10
So you might say,
Well, of course, Mr. Soffer was
And what this educational requirement
11 says, and this is the school law again of
12 Pennsylvania, is that when teaching physiology and
13 hygiene, which is a mandated subject, each time that
14 that subject is taught, there must be references,
15 specific reference to the effect of alcoholic drinks,
16 stimulants and narcotics upon the human system.
17
Now, I realize probably you're all
18 thinking narcotics, what does that mean, certainly
19 tobacco's not included in that, but actually tobacco
20 was, which gives us a little peek into the -- to the
21 world view of people at that time.
22 strongly about tobacco, and tobacco was classified
23 often as the first in the list of narcotics that
24 teachers were supposed to tell students about.
25 you might have tobacco and then opium and heroin and
They felt very
So
262
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 such things like that.
2 alcohol is also classified occasionally as a
3 narcotic, but tobacco was very high on the list.
4
Q.
So sometimes, by the way,
Now, this law is from 1937.
Was this the
5 first law in Pennsylvania that required the teaching
6 of the dangers of tobacco?
7
8
9
A.
No, it wasn't.
As I just mentioned, this
begins in 1885.
Q.
Okay.
And do you have another example of
10 Pennsylvania educational materials that you'd like to
11 show the jury?
12 A. Yes, I do.
13 Q. Okay.
14 A. And again, this is also from the state of
That would be Hoffman 5.
15 Pennsylvania.
16 and then the question became how -- how do you make
17 programs that are responsive to the laws that exist.
18 And so this would have been --
19 course of study from Pennsylvania.
20
And the state, of course, had laws,
this is in fact a
Again, you see the Department of Public
21 Instruction on my handy-dandy little pointer there.
22 This is from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
23 says is that -- that there be outcomes, they expect
24 there to be outcomes for the -- from the educational
25 process and programs.
And what it
And one of those desired
263
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 outcomes was to avoid the use of tobacco for health
2 and mental efficiency.
3 not just know about why they shouldn't use tobacco,
4 but actually not to do it.
So again, they wanted kids to
5 And then here under suggest teaching
6 content over here, you see again narcotics, and
7 tobacco is an example of narcotics.
8 talk about what are some of the problems.
9 constricts the blood vessels.
10
pressure.
11
There they also
It
It raises the blood
It affects the lungs and the kidney.
So that was, you know, their way of
12 describing what -- what teachers should have been
13 telling students.
14
Q.
Now, would this course of study have been
15 in effect when Mr. Soffer was attending school in
16 Pennsylvania?
17 A. Yes, it was.
18 Q. Were you able to determine from your
19 research why Pennsylvania had these types of
20 educational requirements and what did you find?
21
A.
Well, they had these kind of requirements
22 because the belief was that the schools are, you
23 know, the place where we try to start out right in
24 relation to children, to educate them about the
25 values and knowledge that the society has

Q.
Teachers are on a
Based on your research, were you able to
6 identify the specific school books that were selected
7 for use in the Philadelphia schools when Mr. Soffer
8 attended school?
9
10
11
12
A.
Yes, I was.
I identified that very
carefully.
Q.
And did you locate and examine those books
in your research?
13 A. Yes, I did.
14 Q. And did you bring some examples of the
15
16
Philadelphia school book materials that you found?
A.
Yes, I did.
And these, again, I'm glad
17 you said Philadelphia, because these were specific to
18 Philadelphia.
19 state of Pennsylvania had its own list about what
20 books kids were supposed to get.
21 reach over and get those.

Well, before you do that, let me ask you a
few more questions.
24 A. Oh, okay.
25 Q. So the materials you brought were school
Sorry.
265
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 books that were selected for use in the Philadelphia
2 schools when Mr. Soffer was attending school?
3
A.
Yes.
I identified them by year, so I
4 looked at what Philadelphia was requiring of teachers
5 and students in the particular years that Mr. Soffer
6 was a student in a particular grade.
7
Q.
And based on your research, tell us
8 generally what were students in the Philadelphia
9 schools being taught about the risks of cigarette
10
smoking back when Mr. Soffer attended school?
11 A.
12 things.
13 covered all of the bases, the teachers did.
14
The students were being taught a number of
They were -- again, they very carefully
So they would talk about that cigarettes
15 are something which are habit forming, that you
16 should be very, very careful not to pick up habits
17 that are going to be very hard to lose later in life
18 and that will be very deleterious, very injurious to
19 your health.
20
So they were taught that.
They were taught to be careful consumers,
21 to be wary of things that they would be told in
22 commercial, by commercial vendors of all different
23 kinds of products.
24
25
They were also told about it could have an
effect on your heart.
I remember one school book
266
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 talked about sudden death in middle age, you know,
2 that that was a possible consequence of using tobacco
3 because of its effects on the heart and that kind of
4 thing.
5
Q.
Okay.
Now, did you bring a slide which
6 shows us one of the educational materials from
7 Philadelphia?

Okay, great.
Thank
Could you briefly describe this for the
Tell us what it is and what it talks about.
A.
Yes.
This is one of the texts that pupils
17 were -- was recommended for pupils in the
18 Philadelphia schools, the very schools that
19 Mr. Soffer grew up in.
20 so he would have been about six years old then.
21 this is -- again, this is the context into which, you
22 know, he's entering as a young school student.
23 it says right here in 1941 that a heavy tobacco
24 smoker inhales about nine pounds of tobacco tar in
25 ten years and that people suffering cancer of the
This is actually from 1941,

2 smokers.
So this was a 1941 document.
3 This, by the way, was used in a lot of
4 places around the country but had been identified
5 specifically by the school board of Philadelphia.
6 says, the net conclusion is clear, the smoking of
7 tobacco was statistically associated with an
8 impairment of life duration and that this increased,
9 this amount or degree of impairment increased as the
10
11
It
habitual amount of smoking increased.
Q.
Thank you.
Now, Professor, did you bring
12 with you today some of the actual Philadelphia school
13 books from the 1940s that you found in your research?
14 A. Yes, I did.
15 Q. And why don't you hold those up and show
16
those to the jury for us.
17 A. Right.
18 Q. Now, we're going to go through these, but
Let me get those out.
19 why don't you show the jury, just tell them very
20 briefly each of the books that you brought.
21
A.
Yes.
This is a sampling, of course.
This
22 is a fourth grade health textbook, and fourth grade
23 is where the, generally speaking, where schools began
24 hitting specifically on tobacco.
25 talked to kids about being healthy and doing what
Before that, they

2 developing good health habits, so -- but it's the
3 fourth grade that they really start to hone in on
4 tobacco.
5
Now, by the way, this was true in
6 Mr. Soffer's generation, it was true in his youngest
7 daughter's generation.
8 example, testified learning about this kind of thing
9 in a fourth grade science class in her case.
10
His daughter Rochelle, for
So this is Health By Doing, and Health By
11 Doing, if I could show you another slide on that,
12 essentially what it tells you is that tobacco is very
13 poisonous, that it's habit forming, et cetera,
14 et cetera.
15
16
17
Q.
So that's the fourth grade textbook.
Show us the next book and then we'll go to
a slide.
A.
Okay.
All right.
Yes.
The next textbook
18 is -- these are very, so old-fashioned looking --
19 this is the -- called Active and Alert.
20 Q. Hold that up.
21 A. Yeah.
This was by Brownell and Williams.
22 This particular book was for sixth grade, so what you
23 see here is the progression.
24 to understand, as the law said, every time you teach
25 health, you must talk about tobacco as a narcotic and

Q.
And why don't you briefly tell the jury
what you found in these books.
A.
Well, what I found in these books --
16 again, this is the fourth grade and then the sixth
17 grade health textbook -- is that warnings were very
18 clear, they were very explicit, they were age
19 appropriate to the language development of those
20 children.
21 my little handy-dandy pointer, tobacco contains a
22 very poisonous substance that is called nicotine.
23 Nicotine is habit forming.
24 It gets worse.

So it's not just
It's actually Philadelphia as well.
10 here -- that tobacco contains substances that
11 ordinarily are not taken into the body except as
12 drugs.
13
The chief one of these is called nicotine.
And they point out that the smoke of
14 tobacco also contains monoxide gas.
15 monoxide, which is generally unsuited for breathing
16 into the body.
17 kids learn very early that carbon monoxide will kill.
18 You should never be in an enclosed car in a garage,

So these were all in his year
7 So this particular book, it will also tell
8 you essentially that -- again, they vary it slightly.
9 This time they emphasize that how tobacco irritates
10 the lungs, the mucous membranes of the lungs.
11 they also emphasize, as a lot of books did in this
12 period of time, because we're now talking the '40s,
13 the 19 -- and going into the 1950s, that America is a
14 place where you have to decide what's the right thing
15 to do.
16 United States at this time, historically speaking, on
17 the United States as a free country, as a country in
18 which, you know, the individual citizen must take
19 responsibility.

And
And there's a lot of emphasis in the
The other book I brought that's from this
21 what they call the primary, primary level, in this
22 case, junior high school.
23 Modern Ways to Health, very dull cover, I'm afraid.
24 But this -- in this particular book what they talked
25 about, a statistic that kids actually heard a lot,
This was a book called
272
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 which was about longevity and that if you smoked, it
2 was very likely that your life would be shorter than
3 those of other people around you who did not smoke.
4 So in fact, what they were often saying
5 without saying it, they were quoting a very famous
6 study by Raymond Pearl of Johns Hopkins University.
7 And this information by Dr. Pearl, which he described
8 in 1938 and published in 1938, very, very big news.
9 In fact, even in Florida two years after he made that
10 study, it was in the school textbooks.
11 textbooks were very up to date.
12 careful and concerned about giving people correct
13 information.

So the school
They were very

for the jury.

in this particular textbook -- now, this is the
273
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 seventh grade textbook that was in the year that
2 Mr. Soffer was also in seventh grade in Philadelphia.
3 It says that tobacco substance -- pardon me, tobacco
4 smoke contains substances which irritate the
5 membranes of the breathing passages.
6 we all know that breathing is like the most important
7 thing we do.
8 whether to smoke or not, remember to ask yourself
9 whether you want to form a habit which will do you no

And of course,
When it comes time for you to decide
good and may do you harm.
11
Now, by the way, again, context here is
12 that kids were being told in kindergarten, first
13 grade, second grade, third grade that they should
14 practice good habits, good hygiene habits, and so
15 this, you know, piled up on top of that.
16 second book, this, of course, is the eighth grade
17 book, and the longevity studies.

12 Q. And briefly describe this for the jury.
13 A. In addition to the general textbook like
14 the book Crisp, by Crisp, the one you just saw, they
15 also identified some additional resources for
16 students on specific topics.
17 I've described, the -- it was very important to the
18 state of Pennsylvania and to the schools and to
19 educators to get across the dangers of tobacco,
20 alcohol, and various other, quote/unquote, narcotics.

Here it says that when tar is applied
3 repeatedly locally to the skin of a rabbit's ear, it
4 could cause a cancer to develop at the point of
5 application.
6 smoke is a means of applying tar to the delicate
7 tissues of the lung.

(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 passing on this information to students about the
2 health dangers of smoking?
3 A. Yes, I was.
4 Q. And what did your research show?
5 A. My research showed that young people were
6 overwhelmingly aware during Mr. Soffer's generation,
7 his school generation, that smoking was linked to
8 lung cancer, that it was a very harmful substance in
9 a number of different ways.
And I found that in all
10 kinds of materials that I looked at, including polls,
11 including other popular culture and other types of
12 evidence.
13
Q.
Sure.
Were polls and survey data one of
14 the types of evidence you looked at in reaching that
15 determination?
16 A. Yes, they were.
17 Q. Okay.
And is polling and survey data
18 something that historians typically rely upon in
19 doing historical research?
20
21
22
A.
Yes, they do.
It's very common to rely
upon polling data.
Q.
Okay.
And have you yourself relied upon
23 polls and surveys to assess public awareness and
24 attitudes in other historical work that you've
25 conducted?
278
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Yes, I have.
2 Q. And can you give us an example?
3 A. Well, an example -- I hope I didn't
4 mention this already before, but when I was looking
5 at the Peace Corps, for example, I was interested in
6 how widespread was common knowledge or awareness of
7 the Peace Corps and found that polls showed that they
8 had a name recognition up there with Smokey the Bear.
9 So that was an example of where you're trying to see
10 how well they know something compared to other things

15 historian in assessing the reliability of polling and
16 survey data?
17 A.
Yes, I do.
18 Q.
Now, as part of your research, did you
19 locate polling and survey data that you considered
20 reliable in assessing whether students in the 1950s
21 were receiving information about the dangers of
22 cigarette smoking?
23
A.
Yes.
I found a number of policies that I
24 thought were very reliable by well-established
25 polling organizations using the -- at that time what
279
(212) 279-9424

Q.
They
Did you bring a few examples of the
policies?
5 A. Yes, I did.
6 Q. And do the slides that you brought here
7 today accurately reflect the survey results that you
8 found?
9
A.
I -- yes, they very much corroborate all
10 of the other contextual information I have showing
11 that 96, 95, 94 percent of students in high school in
12 the generation that Mr. Soffer was in believed and
13 understood that there -- or had heard that there was
14 a link between tobacco smoking, particularly
15 cigarettes, and lung cancer.
16
Q.
Let's take a look at the first slide of
17 the Hoffman 11, and can you describe this for jury,
18 please.
19 A.
Yes, I'd be happy to do that.
This is
20 from a survey by a man named Eugene Gilbert, who was
21 president, like George Gallup, of a large polling
22 organization, a very reputable organization.
23 was featured in, you know, various national magazines

2
So in this particular survey, it showed
3 that 94 percent of young people in 1956, high school
4 students, felt that there must be a definite link
5 between tobacco and lung cancer in 1956.
6 is -- this is the general group in which Mr. Soffer
7 would have proceeded through high school with.
8 Sometimes people call it, sort of a technical word
9 there meaning cohort.
So this
It's sort of a group of people
10 he, you know, would have been in, his age group, so
11 these were people who were still in high school when
12 that survey was taken, although he had very recently
13 graduated.
14 must be a definite link between tobacco and lung
15 cancer.
16 Q.
And do you have another example to show
18 A.
Yes, I do.
19 Q.

20 A.
This is another example.

also subscribe to it.
2 Anyway, in their poll in 1959, they found
3 in a poll of high school students that of the 10,763
4 students polled, 97.3 percent said they believed
5 there was a link between smoking and lung cancer.
6 this, as you see -- and again, it is the era -- you
7 know, we tend to think that people in the past
8 don't -- didn't know as much as we know today, which
9 is often not true.
In this case, a very high number

I looked quite a bit at slang
There are quite a number
I also looked at music, popular music, and
15 movies and of course television over here, all of
16 which reflect the cultural understandings that people
17 have and have gotten from these previous kinds of
18 public awareness we talked about from the schools and
19 from their families.
20
Q.
And were the dangers of cigarette smoking
21 expressed in popular culture over the years and
22 during Mr. Soffer's lifetime?
23
A.
Yes.
During his lifetime there were many,
24 many, many, many expressions of an awareness of the
25 hazards of cigarette smoking in all of these media,

Q.
And why was it important to look at
popular culture?
4
A.
Popular culture is very important to look
5 at.
6 course, what historians, one of our primary tasks is.
7 And so in this case, I wanted to know what did people
8 understand and how did they express their knowledge
9 or their understanding of the hazards of cigarette
That's how we describe a society and that's, of
10 smoking, hazards of addiction and that kind of thing.
11 So I found that reflected in many, many forms.
12
Q.
And you mentioned slang terms.
Have
13 people used slang terms over the years to refer to
14 the dangers of cigarette smoking?
15
A.
Yes, very much so.
There are all kinds of
16 slang, lists and lists of slang.
17 well-known ones are "cancer stick" for a cigarette or
18 "coffin nail."
19
Some of the most
There are all kinds of other ones.
Mrs. Soffer actually used a term I -- it
20 wasn't -- a new one for me, "air brakes."
21 -- it's -- slang is a constantly evolving thing as
22 our language evolves.
23
Q.
So it's
Now, one term you mentioned was coffin
24 nail.

A.
That particular term goes back to the late

So in this case you know it's
Now, we have a smoker here being nailed
into a coffin and smoking a cigarette; is that right?
A.
That's right.
So he's holding the
cigarette, and as you see, it's the same shape as the
coffin nails, that machine-made cigarette.
Q.
Okay.
Now, I think you also mentioned

Q.
So you found evidence in your research
2 that the Soffer family was familiar with the slang
3 terms like coffin nail and cancer sticks?
4
A.
I did.
Quite a number of the depositions
5 reflected that awareness and people were able to
6 define what it meant.
7 particular referred to that and testified that she
8 and her husband both used that term.
9
Q.
And as I said, Mrs. Soffer in
And did popular culture contain slang
10 references to the habit forming or addictive nature
11 of tobacco?
12
A.
Yes, it did.
And of course, that reflects
13 the very long, ancient awareness really of how
14 addictive tobacco could be.
15
Q.
And do you have a slide showing some of
16 the terms that have historically been used to
17 describe the habit-forming or addictive nature of
18 tobacco?

A.
Yes, much, much before he was born.
And
3 he would have been born into a culture which was very
4 aware of this problem.
5
Q.
In your research, did you ever see any
6 slang terms indicating that cigarettes were good for

12 A. Yes.
13 Q. And did you bring an actual vinyl record
14 from 1947 that contains a song about the dangers of
15 smoking?
16 A. Yes, I did.
17 Q. And can you pull that up for the jury?
18 A. I'd actually like to show you this.

(212) 490-34301 interesting about this is you see him dressed in a

Q.
So Smoke, Smoke, Smoke That Cigarette is a
song by Tex Williams from 1947?
14 A. Yes, it's a song that he co-wrote in 1947.
15 Q. Now, does this song include references to
16 the dangers of cigarette smoking and the
17 habit-forming nature of cigarette smoking?
18
A.
Yes.
Again, you know, you could still use

Yes, Roundup
Well, since we don't have an old record
player, did you bring along a recording of this song
for us to listen to?
11 A. Yes, I did.
12 Q. And is this a version that shows some of
13 the different artists who performed this song over
14 the years?
15
A.
Yes, it does.
And I wanted to give you a
16 sampling so you can see how this is something -- this
17 is not just old knowledge, but something that's
18 revivified and brought back periodically.

20 that I know of of the song was in 1995.

8 movies?
9 A.
I do.
And again, I wanted to give the
10 jury some examples.
11 but just some short clips that will show the ways in
12 which a lot of very famous people actually were in

9 in which his generation was being exposed to this
10 information.
11 three-year-old, although The Three Stooges, you know,
12 started out in movie theaters and then ran on
13 television for many decades, all the way through
14 1987, which was near the end of his life when he was

Did the
23 A. Yes, it did, very similarly to movies.
24 Q. Were the scientific developments on
25
smoking and health covered on the TV news in the

2
3
1950s?
A.
Yes, they were -- it was covered on the
news in the 1950s.
4 Q.
5 It Now?
6 A.
Are you familiar with a program called See
Yes.
See It Now was a pioneering
7 journalism show on CBS News, and it was a program
8 hosted by Edward R. Murrow, who was probably the most
9 famous journalist of his time and also in some ways
10 seen as a bit of a hero because he had broadcast from
11 London during what was called the Blitz when the
12 Nazis were trying to bomb London to heck and gone.
13 This has also, by the way, been the subject of a
14 recent movie with George Clooney called Good Night
15 and Good Luck.
16
17
18
Q.
And did Mr. Murrow have a television
program in the '50s called See It Now?
A.
Yes.
That was a show for which he was
19 very, very well known.
20 first wife, Lorraine Allison, recalls watching that
21 show in the 1950s.
22
23
Q.
And in fact, Mr. Soffer's
And you reviewed See It Now in forming
your opinions in this case?

(212) 490-34301 1955 have to say about the dangers of cigarette
2 smoking?
3
A.
Well, this was a very serious and lengthy
4 program.
5 and again, it talked quite a bit about the connection
6 with lung cancer and the most recent scientific
7 findings on lung cancer.
8
9
In fact, it ran over two nights prime time,
And it -- again, it's sort of like the
school books.
The idea was to try and get the
10 freshest, most up-to-date news out to people about
11 the hazards as they were being unveiled.
12 people came to know them better and better as
13 scientists understood more and more about the human
14 body over time.
15 but the specific ways became clearer and more
16 scientifically, you know, developed, if you will.

BY MR. KOETHE:

Now, did popular television programs such
as sitcoms also address the dangers of cigarette

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301

smoking?
A.
Yes, they did, very similarly to the
3 movies and, you know, other forms of public and
4 popular culture.
5
6
7
Q.
Did you bring a few examples to show the
jury?
A.
I did.
I wanted to give some examples
8 again that would be from, you know, a longer span of
9 time beginning in the 1950s when lung cancer became
10 very prominent, and partly because the disease before
11 the '50s was a relatively unknown disease, and it's
12 something that became more and more prominent in the
13 1940s and '50s.
14
So I start with Leave It To Beaver, a
15 favorite, which was a very popular show in the 1950s
16 and ran through the '60s and in reruns for many, many
17 generations.
18 and as you can see from my slide here, the Brady
19 Bunch, which has actually been redone in a movie form
20 in recent years.
And then coming up to the Brady Bunch,
Then All In The Family.
21 These were very -- these were top shows in
22 their eras, and so -- and this -- throughout all this
23 time, Mr. Soffer and his family watched television
24 and, you know, had children who probably would have
25 wanted to see some of these shows as well as adults.

2 Happy Days, another top show in its era from 1979.
3
4
5
Q.
And did these programs address the dangers
of cigarette smoking?
A.
They did.
And what you'll see in them is
6 that people understood, both the actors and the
7 audience hearing this would have accepted this as
8 common knowledge that cigarettes were addictive and
9 harmful.

BY MR. KOETHE:
Q.
Let's switch gears and talk about
15 magazines, another source that you mentioned earlier.
16 Did popular magazines also discuss the dangers of
17 smoking throughout Mr. Soffer's lifetime?
18 A. Yes, they did.
19 Q. And why were magazines important as a
20 source of information in your research during the
21 1940s, '50s and '60s?
22
A.
Well, the magazines had a much more
23 important role than they do now, and it's important
24 to understand that difference.

6 people read magazines much more commonly, and

8 that he really enjoyed reading magazines.
9
10
Q.
There weren't computers.
For a time, there were only two
Then the third, ABC, came on-line.
So
And did you research a magazine called
Reader's Digest in this case?
11 A. Yes, I did.
12 Q. And did you bring an actual copy of
13
There
Reader's Digest from the 1960s to show the jury?
14 A. Yes, I did.
15 Q. Why don't you hold that up for us?
16 A. This is a Reader's Digest from April of
17 1964, so this is that era.
18 this, by the way, particular volume comes right after
19 the surgeon general's report, so this is their really
20 big coverage of the surgeon generals report of 1964,
21 the one at which the federal government, you know,
22 compiled all the studies and said, yes, cigarette
23 smoking's definitely bad for you.
24
25
This is -- of course,
So -- and on the back it has the list of
contents, and right at the top of the list of
298
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 contents, the third and fourth article Cigarette and
2 I Quit Smoking, so this has two articles in it.
3
Q.
Tell us, what kind of magazine was
4 Reader's Digest back in the 1950s?
5 flavor for what that magazine was.
6
A.
Give us a little
Well, Reader's Digest was -- and this is
7 not an exaggeration -- was the most important
8 magazine in the world, if you looked at it as a
9 source from which many, many people got information.
10 To give you a sense of this, in the middle
11 of the 1950s, 1957, and this -- this magazine, by the
12 way, was -- it's been testified was in the Soffer
13 home and it was something that the family subscribed
14 to, and his children said -- recalled him reading.
15 Anyway, there were approximately 40 million readers
16 in 1957, 40 million readers.
17
Now, the population of the U.S. at that
18 time was about 170 million, which translates into
19 one-fourth of the population read Reader's Digest,
20 which is just huge.
21 publication today where we could say that about it.
22 So it had -- not only was it an important
23 publication, but it also focused extensively on
24 cigarettes, had a lot of information on that and also
25 carried no cigarette advertising.
I don't -- I can't think of one

3
Q.
How far back did Reader's Digest cover the
health risks of cigarette smoking?
A.
The magazine was started in 1922, and they
4 began covering the problem of cigarette addiction and
5 the hazards of smoking in 1924, so right away.
6 they covered it, in fact, in the period that
7 Mr. Soffer, you know, was alive, in his generation.
8 There were 36 articles from, you know, 1924 to 1964
9 and another 89 additional articles.
And
So I'm not going
10 to try and do the math that quickly for you, but a
11 lot of articles, 120 something.
12
Q.
And these were articles that dealt with
13 the dangers and the habit-forming nature of
14 cigarettes?
15 A. Yes, and also how to quit.
16 Q. And how did Reader's Digest treat the
17
18
issue of the dangers of smoking in its articles?
A.
They were very serious on this subject,
19 and they told people that they shouldn't smoke, that
20 it was addictive, that they should quit, that it was
21 possible to quit, that if you quit, you would start
22 to feel better, you would start to get better and you
23 would lessen your -- the hazard of dying young.

Hoffman 23.
BY MR. KOETHE:
Q.
And, Professor, could you just briefly
7 describe the articles that are appearing on this
8 slide?
9
A.
Yes, I will.
So here is the
10 Reader's Digest from 1920s and 1940s, so, you know,
11 some of this, of course, was before Mr. Soffer was

Q.
Now, do you have a few slides that focus
in on some of these particular articles?
A.
Yes, because I wanted to show the jury,
15 not just tell you but show you how these articles
16 conveyed the issue.
17 this is -- these are ones of, you know, quite a
18 number of articles on that subject.

MR. KOETHE:
23
Why don't we pull up
slide 24.
21
22
And again, I should emphasize
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.

Now, tell us about this one.

It looks

(212) 490-34301
A.
That's right.
Now, this is the article
2 that is the start of their coverage of this topic in
3 1924, again, shortly after the newspaper -- pardon
4 me, after the magazine was founded.
5 right here, tobacco is injurious to the human body,
6 meaning it does injury to the human body.
7 resistance to tuberculosis and other diseases.

And it says
It lessens
Now, let me mention here, by the way,
tuberculosis at this time was sort of like we would
10 talk about cancer today.
11 extremely serious disease.
12 It was called the white death because people, you
13 know, became so bleached out by the end of their
14 lives that -- you know, that they looked white when
15 they died.
16 and it could -- smoking lessens your resistance to
17 it.
18 cancer and it probably shortens life.

It was considered an

So this was a terrible, terrible disease
It also, as they put it here, sometimes induces
Q.
Do you have one more slide from this early
grouping?
A.
Yes, I did -- I do.
And this is the one
22 called Nicotine Knockout or the Slow Count.
23 was a sports figure.
24 a positive and demonstrably bad effect on longevity
25 and general health.

(212) 490-34301 reference in a way, a sideways reference to Raymond
2 Pearl's.
3 actuarial -- there were a lot of insurance companies
4 which did studies, which were also published and
5 talked about out there in the general public that
6 showed that life span was shortened, that your
7 chances of living long were not very great.
8
And also there were a lot of
Q.
I think you mentioned earlier that there
9 came a time around 1950 when the public media began
10 to focus more on this question of cigarette smoking
11 as a cause of lung cancer; is that right?
12 A. That's correct.
13 Q. And what was happening at that time to
14 cause this increase in publicity about smoking and
15 lung cancer?
16 A.
What was happening, probably the most
17 important thing to know is that the incidence of lung
18 cancer was going way up.
19 but it was true all around the country.
20
So it was true in Florida,
And for a disease to suddenly in a way
21 appear, you know, it meant that it attracted a lot of
22 attention.
23 because cancer was what one historian has called the
24 dread disease.
25 that people didn't even want to say the word.
It attracted attention particularly
It was a disease that was so scary
They

might say "the big C" or something like that.
2
To give you a sense of this, by the way,
3 the survival rate for breast cancer in the early
4 generations was five percent.
5 are practically reversed.
6 a -- you know, a new disease, a new version of cancer
7 that was becoming very prevalent, and researchers
8 like Hammond and Horn and Dahl and Hill, British
9 researchers and American researchers, were talking a
Today those statistics
So in this case, it was
10 lot about it.
11 you know, they're talking about bad effect on
12 longevity, but after the 1940s, we really see a lot
13 of talk focused on lung cancer.
14
Q.
So here in the Reader's Digest thing,
Some of these researchers you mentioned
15 who were doing work on the issue of smoking and lung
16 cancer, did their studies get picked up in the more
17 general media, such as Reader's Digest, let's say?
18
A.
Yes, they did.
And it's an example of
19 where science people, you know, really glommed onto,
20 if you will, the scientific discoveries because they
21 were so amazing and people felt like that science was
22 finally getting real answers to some important
23 questions.
24
25
Q.
How widely were these studies on smoking
and health covered in the popular magazines of this
305
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 time period?
2 A.
The were covered very widely in
3 Reader's Digest, but as I hope to discuss later, they
4 were covered in newspapers, magazines, you know,
5 around the world, by the way, because these studies
6 were being done around the world as well.
7 you know, Toledo to Tokyo, there were major
8 headlines.
9
Q.
So from,
And did these publications provide
10 detailed coverage of the studies for the ordinary
11 person?
12 A.
Yes.
And in fact, Reader's Digest is
13 probably our best example of that.
14 was a publication which digested the news, meaning it
15 would take articles, scientific articles, and put
16 them in everyday person's language.
17 I mean, that's probably one reason why the Soffer
18 family carried it, as so many Americans did, because
19 it took important scientific findings and made them
20 accessible to everyone.
21
22
Q.
Reader's Digest
And as we know,
Did you bring some examples of
Reader's Digest coverage beginning in the 1950s?
23 A. Yes, I did.
24 Q. Why don't -- why don't you step down and
25
explain this exhibit, which would be Hoffman 26.
306
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
A.
All right.
So this -- these are some
2 examples from the years between 1952 and 1964 from
3 the Reader's Digest where they talk about these
4 hazards.
5 subject is right there in the title, and again, it's
6 an example of popular awareness, not quite slang but
7 you have Cancer by the Carton.
8 by the carton?
9 carton.
And as you'll see in these -- the -- the
Well, what do you get
People would get cigarettes by the
So even the headline shows that the
10 reader -- it's understood that the reader will
11 recognize right away that we're talking about
12 cigarettes and cancer, those two are linked.
13
So Cancer by the Carton is from December
14 of 1952, and, you know, said a variety of things
15 about it.
16
Then here from 1954, this was the facts
17 behind what they call the cigarette controversy.
18 in this case, by the way, this is July 1954, so
19 that's only one month after the very famous Hammond
20 and Horn study for the American Cancer Society that
21 was released in June of 1954.
22
And
Here in 1957 the Reader's Digest will not
23 rest.
24 the facts behind the filter tip cigarettes.
25 one question is, you know, is there a way to make
They talk about this all the time.
Here is
Well,
307
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 cigarette smoking safer, and so filter tips became
2 very predominant in the marketplace actually and went
3 to -- from almost none to almost half of all
4 cigarettes sold right in this period of time because
5 people knew and were concerned.
6
Here we see in June of 1962 the lung
7 cancer and cigarettes, here are the latest findings.
8 So you get the sense of the story's being constantly
9 updated and embellished and fleshed out.
The
10 Cigarette Controversy, A Storm is Brewing.
11 from August 1963.
12 know, this is a very controversial topic, this is a
13 major industry and, you know, cigarettes are being --
14 are going to be blamed by -- it talks here about the
15 surgeon general of the public health service of the
16 United States.
17 That is the important article.
18 issue of the Reader's Digest I just showed you had
19 that article in it, Cigarettes, Tried and Found
20 Guilty of Causing Major Damage to People's Health.
21
Q.
This is
So this is a recognition of, you
Cigarettes Tried and Found Guilty.
All right.
In fact, that was the
Thank you.
Did you bring a
22 few additional boards which describe a few of these
23 specific stories?
24
25
A.
I did.
MR. KOETHE:
Will you put up Number

(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
27, Hoffman 27?
2 THE WITNESS:
3 board here, right?
4
Thank you.
So this
BY MR. KOETHE:
5 Q. Yes.
6 A. Okay.
I guess we're showing it two
7 different ways to the jury.
8 particular board, this shows that Reader's Digest
9 article I just pointed out, the Cancer by the Carton
All right.
So in this
10 where, you know, you're supposed to know what the
11 title means even before you get to the content.
12 it says quite a number of things, but one of the
13 things it says is that no one questions that tobacco
14 smoke aggravates hoarseness, coughing, chronic
15 bronchitis.
16 the term that was most commonly used to reference
17 what we today more commonly call emphysema.
18 chronic bronchitis was that.
19 person smokes, the greater is the risk of developing
20 cancer of the lung.
21 that there's a relationship between the quantity a
22 person ingests and the dangers that they're exposing
23 themselves to.
Here
And by the way, chronic bronchitis was
So
It says, the more a
So there's this understanding
24 Q. Great.
25 A. Yes, I do.
Do you have another one --
309
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
3
Q. -- from Reader's Digest?
A. I'm sorry.
This would be
28.
Forgive me for speeding ahead.
4 I always have to remind myself in class not to do
5 that.
6
Q.
All right.
So this is a Reader's Digest,
7 another of the articles that I showed you a little
8 clip of.
9
A.
What year is this from?
This one is June of 1962.
And it says,
10 lung cancer and cigarettes, here are the latest
11 findings.
12 cause of lung cancer and bronchitis.
13 smokers have the greatest risk of dying from these
14 diseases.
15 statistically speaking that the people who tended to
16 die from these diseases were smokers.
And it says again, cigarette smoking is a
Cigarette
So that was the understanding that
17 Now, again, these articles are at a time
18 when Reader's Digest has a readership of 40 million
19 people reaching approximately 25 percent of the
20 American public, and it's also, by the way, worldwide
21 the largest subscriber magazine of that period.
22 Q. Do you --
23 A. -- around the world.
24 Q. Do you recall, Professor, was this article
25
discussing a specific scientific study that was being
310
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
done around that time?
A.
Well, in 1962 it also -- there it's
3 talking about a British report, by the way.
4 again, I mentioned when Reader's Digest is worldwide.
5 The British medical societies were also doing
6 parallel studies to the U.S.
7 1962, the British government formally concluded
8 that -- and the Royal Medical Society concluded
9 rather that smoking was very harmful to you, for you
10
11
12
13
14
Q.
And that study was being picked up in the
Reader's Digest here in the U.S.?
A.
Yes, exactly.
So they're sharing
information very rapidly, really instantaneously.
Q.
16 time period?
17 A.
18
20
And at that time in
and people should quit.
15
19
So
And do you have one more board from this
I do.
MR. KOETHE:
that one up?
Great.
Why don't we put
It's 29.
BY MR. KOETHE:
21 Q. And tell us a little bit about this story.
22 A. Well, this is the article from April of
23 1964 where Reader's Digest, you know, delivers the
24 surgeon general's report of that year and basically
25 saying, now we know cigarette smoking causes lung
311
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 cancer in men.
2 articles referred to a controversy, scientists
3 debating with one another, everybody being warned
4 that this is a possibility and some people think it
5 is definitely true, but here it's saying, okay, you
6 know, the U.S. government has said it causes lung
7 cancer in men.
So you saw some of those earlier
8 Q. Who was the surgeon general in 1964?
9 A. In 1964 that was Dr. Luther Terry, who, by
10 the way, was later on a resident of Philadelphia,
11 Pennsylvania during the time that Mr. Soffer was
12 there.
13 Q. Great.
14 A. Thank you.
15 Q. Based on your research, Professor, what
Why don't you return to your seat.
16 role did Reader's Digest play in creating public
17 awareness about the health risks of cigarette
18 smoking?
19
A.
Well, I am -- I'm not the only one to
20 think that Reader's Digest was -- had a profound
21 effect on public understanding, public knowledge.
22 And in fact, the American Cancer Society, which was
23 and of course still is the primary nonprofit public
24 organization devoted to cancer issues, they
25 themselves said in April of 1964 that the
312
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Reader's Digest had had a profound effect on
2 Americans' understanding of the hazards.
3
Q.
And did you bring a slide describing that?
4 Why don't we pull up 30, Hoffman 30.
5 describe this slide to the jury.
6
A.
Yes.
Thank you.
Just briefly
My little pointer.
We
7 can see that here, by the way, American Cancer
8 Society note -- took note that it had been since
9 November 1924, and you saw that article, the jury
10 just saw that -- it says, the Reader's Digest has
11 published 36 articles on smoking and health.
12 American Cancer Society has termed them a profound
13 influence in creating public awareness of the risks
14 involved in smoking.
15
16
17
Q.
The
And is this is other story that appeared
in the issue of the magazine that you brought today?
A.
Yes, it is.
I mentioned that there were
18 two articles.
19 two articles in the Reader's Digest.
20 passionately they felt about this subject.
21 is the one that told people, you know, you can quit,
22 people do quit and you should.
23
Q.
Sometimes, you know, there could be
That's how
And this
Now, were there popular magazines other
24 than Reader's Digest that covered the issue of
25 smoking and lung cancer in the 1950s?
313
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Yes, very much so.
2 Q. And let's start with Life Magazine.
Did
3 you -- is Life Magazine one of the magazines that
4 covered this issue?
5 A. Yes, Life Magazine covered this issue.
6 Q. And did you bring an actual cover of Life
7
Magazine from the 1950s with you?
8 A. I did.
9 Q. Why don't you display that for the jury?
10 A. All right.
Thank you.
Yes.
Life
11 Magazine -- Life Magazine was probably -- well, it's
12 certainly one of the best known magazines of this
13 time period, in part because it was a pioneer in
14 photojournalism.
15 term that became very prevalent as a result of Life
16 Magazine, gorgeous photos.
17 buy, you know, Life Looks at the 1920s or Life Looks
18 at the 1960s, and they're great, glossy magazines, or
19 pardon me, books in this case.
20 was a monthly magazine, and July 5th of 1954, they
21 talked about smoking and lung cancer.
22 was an example where, you know, again, the public is
23 being warned that they should do something about this
24 problem.
25
Q.
And in fact, that was kind of a
And even today you can
But at the time, it
And so that
Now, did you also bring a slide with you
314
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

Yes, I did.

MR. KOETHE:

Okay.
Why don't we pull
up 31.

Life Magazine.
Well, now, this is a different
It's from 1950 -- 1953 in December.
10 So in 1953 was the same year that Evarts Graham and
11 Ernst Wynder published their mouse skin painting
12 results.
13 back here in the -- I showed you the news clip from
14 See It Now, and that was a bit later.
15 interviewed Ernst Wynder, and he talked about, you
16 know, how they were doing this.
And by the way, this -- you might remember
17
But they
So that was Wynder.
Graham is the other fellow who was very
18 important.

21 experiment.
22 it.
23 different things.
24 course, you remember Ernst Wynder picked up that
25 beaker full of tar and said, you know, this yucky
He was a very prominent lung surgeon,
This is Evarts Graham here, an older
And in 1953 they did this mouse skin painting
And Life Magazine did a big spread on
And you see, you know, pictures of all the
And this was, by the way, of
315

www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 stuff is what you put into your lungs every year.
2 that's an example from Life Magazine.
3
4
5
Q.
So
And the pictures now at the bottom show
the mice with some of the tumors; is that --
A.
Yes.
They were -- it was gross.
I mean,
6 they -- they had very graphic depictions that if
7 you're reading Life Magazine and looking at that, you
8 would -- you know, you would see that it was very
9 harmful.
You know, these mice were terribly diseased
10 as a result of the tar being painted on their skin.
11 And again, this is the sort of thing that appeared in
12 textbooks and on television and all kinds of other
13 places.
14 Q.
15
Now, did you review Time and Newsweek
magazines for this case as well?
16 A. Yes, I did.
17 Q. Why did you look at those magazines?
18 A. I looked at them both because they were
19 the two primary news magazines of their era.
20 were some others, you know, Business Week and U.S.
21 News and World Report, but the really prominent,
22 largest magazines were Time and Newsweek.
23 was particularly important to me for this case
24 because in several of the depositions and the
25 testimony that Mr. Soffer's family gave, they said he
There
And Time

(212) 490-34301 subscribed to Time.
2 reading Time.
3 important.
4 lifetime, the period I'm looking at right now when
5 lung cancer becomes very well known, between 1950 and
6 1992 when he passed away, there were 163 articles in
7 Time magazine about this subject.
8
9
Q.
His children recalled him
So Time magazine was particularly
And in the period of Mr. Soffer's
And did you bring some actual copies of
Time and Newsweek with you today to show the jury?
10 A. Yes, I did.
11 Q. Why don't you hold those up and briefly
12
13
tell them what they're seeing there.
A.
Yes.
This is an article -- this is a
14 magazine obviously, Time magazine, and this
15 particular date is June 17th of 1957.
16 particular one contained an article on smoking and
17 lung cancer.
18 number of years between 1954 and 1960, these years
19 where this topic was so hot, they ran a regular
20 column called Smoking and Cancer Continued.
21 again, the kind of headline like you saw in
22 Reader's Digest where the reader is supposed to look
23 at it and recognize, oh, right, this is what you've
24 being telling me for quite a long time, Smoking and
25 Cancer Continued.
And this
By the way, I must tell you that for a
So
So for seven years that was a
317
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 column that they had that they ran periodically.
2 so that's Time magazine.
3 of Newsweek magazine.
4 now?
5 Q. Sure.
6 A. Okay.
And
And I also brought a copy
Would you like me to show that
This is Newsweek magazine from
7 November of 1963, so November 1963 means that it
8 preceded by two months the surgeon general's famous
9 1964 report.
So even before the, you know, the
10 federal government puts its stamp on this, Newsweek
11 is saying smoking and health.
12 knows smoking means poor health.
13 lighting up a cigarette.
14 covered this extensively in this period of time.

And it says a man
Can you pull the Newsweek up again and
16
18
Again, the reader
This is a picture of a man
It's kind of got that blue dark look.
He's
So this was a cover story from Newsweek in
1963; is that right?
24 A. Yes, it was a cover story.
25 Q. Great.

A.
Well, what these show is the article from
13 1952 here.
14 Now, Dahl and Hill, those were the British physicians
15 who did a study earlier than the Dahl -- than the
16 Hammond and Horn study here in the U.S.
17 December 1952, they said there is a definite
18 relationship between smoking and lung cancer, so that
19 was from that period of time.
This is about the Dahl and Hill Study.
And In
20 Q. How about the second one?
21 A. The second one, this is the Time magazine

Okay.
So here what it shows, this is
3 from 1950, and it's an article that talked
4 about smokers' lungs.

In this particular case, I wanted to make
11 sure that I followed the newspapers where Mr. Soffer

2 Now, this, by the way, is from the Philadelphia

A.
No, not at all.
This is a small

Okay.
Now, Mr. Soffer also lived in Texas

12 also publish stories about the health hazards of
13 smoking in the 1950s?
Did the newspapers in Texas
14 A. Yes, they did.

(212) 490-34301 very first states to formally warn citizens and

in 1959.
Q.
Now, in addition to these news stories
18 that you've shown us, did the issue of smoking and
19 health appear in other parts of the newspaper?
20 A. Yes, it did.
21 Q. Tell us a little bit about that.
22 A. Well, I thought it was very important to
23 look because people are all different and some people
24 like to read one section of the newspaper and other
25 people read other sections of the newspaper, although

A.
Yes, they did.
Of course, probably the
13 most famous of American advice columns was Ann

also carry advice columns written by doctors?
18 A. Yes, they did.
19 Q. And do you have a few examples to show the

21
jury?
A.
I did.
Now, doctors' columns were
22 something I found in every newspaper I've looked at
23 anywhere around the country from Gainesville, the
24 Gainesville Sun to the Los Angeles Times to the
25 Philadelphia Inquirer.
And essentially what
332
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 happened, a lot of these columns were syndicated and
2 there would be someone who would write on all
3 different subjects, but frequently they came back to
4 lung cancer and advised people who would write in,
5 and even if people weren't writing in, they would
6 say, you've got to stop smoking.

9
Q.
Let's pull up slide 39.
And can you
briefly describe this one for the jury.
A.
Yes.
All right.
In this slide what
10 you'll see here is this is a family doctor they're
11 calling.
12 by that time, he's on the verge of going to New York.
13 He moved around quite a bit, but again, this is the
14 community to which he's moving.
15 was actually a doctor who was syndicated nationwide,
16 so I saw him in Florida newspapers as well.

18 Philadelphia Inquirer.
19 Inquirer, also in the New York Daily News, the
20 New York newspaper.

(212) 490-34301
A.
Yes.
Now, this is a column by Dr. Frank
2 Faulkner, who is in Philadelphia, whose articles
3 appeared both there in and New York.
4 is, I'm an eighth grader and our health class is
5 studying about drugs, smoking and alcoholism.
6 again, here what you see, the typical report is by a
7 student as we've seen reported by members of
8 Mr. Soffer's family themselves.
9 student and I'm learning this in school as we go.
The question
So
You know, I'm a
10 And so the answer is, you know, what do you do about
11 these things.
12 you do and continue, the chances of your developing
13 lung diseases of all kinds, including cancer, is much
14 greater than if you don't smoke.
15
16
17
Q.
The main thing is not to start.
If
Now, did the issue of smoking health also
appear in letters to the editors?
A.
Uh-huh.
That would with another place to
18 see the ways in which public opinion and knowledge is
19 reflected.
20 because again, some people love to read the letters
21 to the editor, and these are statement by citizens.
22 They're just folks off the street who send in their
23 comments and opinions, so I have some of those as
24 well.

And I put in letters to the editor partly

Great.
So these are just a

Q.
He called
Now, you're showing us some advice
15 columns, doctors' columns and letters to the editor.
16 Why did you consider these to be important in your
17 conclusion about public awareness?
18
A.
I included all of these things because
19 they show the myriad ways in which people were being
20 informed and in thousands of articles, in all
21 different kinds of media, magazines and newspapers
22 and on the television telling people that it was bad
23 for them.
24 of bounce that information back, you know, yes, the
25 public's hearing it, they're taking it in.
And things like letters to the editor kind
335
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
Now, did some of the newspaper stories
2 that you reviewed have comments from the tobacco
3 companies?
4 A. Yes, they did.
5 Q. And how often did you see tobacco
6 companies' statements in the newspaper and magazine
7 articles that you researched?
8
9
A.
I saw those on rare occasions.
They did
have them, but they did not have them very often.
10 To -- you know, to give you a sense of that, at one
11 point I did an analysis of the Los Angeles Times and
12 looking at these 2,000 articles, more than 2,000
13 articles in the period of Mr. Soffer's lifetime and
14 found that of articles that made some reference to
15 the tobacco companies' position, it was roughly five
16 percent of the time, which meant that 95 percent of
17 the time there was no mention at all.
18 simply that smoking is very harmful and you should
19 stop.
20
Q.
The point was
And when you saw these statements by
21 tobacco company representatives, where they did
22 typically appear in the news stories?
23
A.
Most frequently they would appear towards
24 the end of the story.
25 focus on them at the beginning of the story but
A very tiny percent they would
336
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 extremely tiny, and mostly it was towards the end and
2 they would always let the American Cancer Society or
3 Dr. Luther Terry have the last word and say, and even
4 though they say this, smoking's bad for you.
5
6
Q.
Now, on occasion did you see stand-alone
stories which set forth the industry's position?
7 A. Yes, I did.
8 Q. Okay.
9
10
11
And typically when you saw the
companies' statements, what -- what did they
typically say?
A.
They probably -- the most typical
12 statement I saw was that more research was needed to
13 show a biological connection between smoking and lung
14 cancer.
15 Q.
16
Now, did you consider these types of
statements in reaching your conclusions in this case?
17 A. Yes, I did.
18 Q. How about cigarette advertisements?
Did
19 you see cigarette ads in the newspapers and magazines
20 that you reviewed?
21 A. Yes, I did.
22 Q. And did you see ads for consumer products
23
24
25
other than cigarettes in the materials you looked at?
A.
Oh, yes.
In fact, the vast majority of
advertising was for other products.
Ninety-eight to

Q.
Did you see cigarette ads that contained
celebrities or sports figures?
5 A. On occasion.
6 Q. And did celebrities and sports figures
7
appear in ads for products other than cigarettes?
8 A. Yes, on occasion.
9 Q. And did you see ads in which celebrities
10
11
endorsed products to help people quit smoking?
A.
Yes, absolutely.
Celebrity endorsement of
12 antismoking also has a long history going back to
13 Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb, but I saw those as well.
14
Q.
And did you consider the presence of
15 advertising in reaching your conclusions in this
16 case?
17 A. Yes, I did.
18 Q. Okay.
Let's talk briefly about internal
19 tobacco company documents.
20 tobacco company documents as part of your research in
21 this case?
Did you review internal

11 meaning anything that a company owned and didn't
12 release, wouldn't have been in the public domain.
13
Q.
So anything that was proprietary,
However, if a tobacco company's statement
14 did reach the public, for example, in a newspaper or
15 magazine article, would that have been something that
16 you did consider in reaching your opinions?
17
A.
Yes, very much.
As I just indicated, I
18 looked at in -- you know, whenever they appeared,
19 which wasn't often, but I certainly considered them.
20
Q.
Now, we talked a little bit earlier about
21 polling and survey data as something that you looked
22 at in this case.
23 surveys showing that smoking and health information
24 was getting through to the public?
25
A.
Did you find additional polls and
Yes, I did.
I came across those as

Yes.
Thank you.
The Gallup organization that was
20 founded by George Gallup, one of the largest and a
21 very reputable polling organization in the
22 United States, probably many people have heard of
23 that name, Gallup.
24 June, and this -- of course, by the way, the timing
25 of this, it's timed precisely with the release of the

10
So they announced their report in June of
Gallup asked immediately, have you heard or
So in other words, have you
Ninety percent said yes.
Only ten percent said no.
11
Q.
Now, how does the result of this poll,
12 this 90 percent figure, compare to the public's
13 knowledge on other issues?
14
A.
Well, it's an amazing figure.
It really
15 is.
16 says it's an amazing figure.
17 the fact that people have gaps in their knowledge.
18 Not everybody knows everything.
19 always find kind of astounding is that only -- in one
20 poll showed that only 79 percent of Americans knew
21 that the earth revolves around the sun.
22 you know, a figure where you go, my gosh, doesn't --
23 doesn't everybody know that and yet what interesting
24 it is cigarette smoking, it is the so consistent that
25 so many people know it, have heard it, have read it.
And in fact, George Gallup himself, you know,
And it compares with
One of the figures I

It's an extraordinary figure.
Q.
Do you have a chart that helps further
illustrate this point?
4 A. Yes, I do.
5 Q. Why don't you step down and we'll put up
6 45, and if you could put up the board and describe it

A.
Thank you very much.
All right.
So this is another little poster board,
10 hand-dandy demonstration.
11 interesting, as you can tell, to compare knowledge of
12 this particular topic with knowledge of other facts
13 which most people think are common knowledge or many
14 people would consider common knowledge, but just show
15 that not everybody knows everything, except when it
16 comes to cigarettes it seems.
17
I just thought it was
So this Gallup poll in 1954, this is
18 representation of the poll that I just showed you.
19 And so this is from Gallup in 1954, and it says, have
20 you heard or read that cigarette smoking may cause
21 lung cancer.
22 compare that with another poll in 1983, can you name
23 George Wash -- who was our first president.
24 89 percent could correctly identify George
25 Washington.
So the figure is 90 percent.
Well,
Well,
So fewer than the number of people who

(212) 490-34301 A. Thank you.
2 Q. Now, did you examine other polls from the
3 1950s dealing with the public's awareness of the
4 risks of smoking?
5
A.
Yes, I did.
You know, I wanted to --
6 again, I felt it was important to explore this aspect

Thank you.
Well, in this survey what you
19 see again is this awareness of a very specific
20 American Cancer Society study.
21 mentions of that in the newspaper so you say may,
22 okay, well, how did -- how is the public hearing this
23 and, oh, they're hearing it through the newspaper

So there's -- you know,
Well, however they found out, they found
4 out.
5 smokers had read about this very recent and very
6 specific report in July of 1957.

13 George Gallup, the head of the Gallup polling
14 organization says, this is a phenomenal figure in the
15 annals of polling.
16
Q.
So smokers were really --

poll for the 1950s?
23 A. Yes, I do.
24 Q. Why don't we pull up Hoffman 47.

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 this is a poll taken in January of 1954 that precedes
2 the -- that comes right before, six months before the
3 famous Hammond and Horn study we've talked about a
4 few times.
5 adults, you know, do you think cigarette smoking is
6 harmful or not, and of that group 70 percent said
7 yes.
8
9
So in January of that month, Gallup asked
Now, 70 percent is a very high figure.
They're talking about, of course, all different kinds
10 of harms, and we don't know because the question is
11 worded very broadly.
12 talking about, lung cancer or circulatory problems or
13 heart disease because harmful in general.
14
You don't know what they were
And by the way, this is a figure that has
15 persisted over time.
16 studies earlier on even.
17 in the 1930s which showed 75 percent of students
18 thought it was harmful, so this is a consistent
19 figure.
20 Q.
You know, there was other
I saw one of students again
So back in 1954, Americans weren't only
21 aware but 70 percent already believed that smoking
22 was harmful to health?
23

A.
Yes, that's right, they believed it.
They
heard it and believed it.

A.
Yes, it preceded the surgeon general's
report by quite a bit.
Q.
Now, did you research belief polls that
dealt specifically with the question of lung cancer?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. And do you have a chart describing some of
8 those polls?

A.
In 1964 the surgeon general Luther Terry

Q.
Now, following the 1964 surgeon general's
8 report, did newspaper coverage of the health risks of
9 smoking stop or did it continue?
10
A.
No.
This was a steady drum beat
11 throughout the entire period of time in which
12 Mr. Soffer was alive.

15
Q.
Now, do you have a few examples from the
Philadelphia newspapers?
A.
Yes, I do.
And again, Philadelphia is
16 important because it's home base for Mr. Soffer.
17 he moved away and moved back and moved away and, you
18 know, moved back two or three times so -- and his
19 family was continuing to be there, so they continued
20 to continued to cover it very vigorously.

9 Q.
10
11
So respecting that, I brought
And
And why are articles like these important
to you in this particular case?
A.
Well, in this case they're important to me
12 because they continue to establish that in Mr.
13 Soffer's generation that people were exposed to these
14 dangers, that they were exposed consistently and in a
15 variety of ways to information about addiction and
16 quitting and the health risks that you continue to
17 persist in smoking.
18 that he lived in.
19
Q.
And of course, these are towns
Let's talk briefly about voluntary health
20 organizations such as the American Cancer Society,
21 the American Lung Association.
22 of, the public activities of these groups something
23 that you researched?
Were the activities
24 A. Yes, I did.

(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 information to the public about the dangers of
2 smoking?
3 A. Yes, they were very active remarkably.
4 Q. And what types of things did they do?
5 A. Well, they really had remarkable campaigns
6 going back to into 1950s, but certainly after the
7 1950s as well.
8 Society was responsible for a lot of the major
9 reports.
And as you saw, the American Cancer

10 very involved.
11 1960s of informing people was through public service
12 announcements.

To give you just a sense of this tip of
15 the iceberg, the American Cancer Society alone, not
16 even bringing those others into account, in the -- in
17 the three years between 1964 and 1967, they created
18 982 different PSAs to educate people like, you know,
19 like the one you saw about Bill Talman and Perry
20 Mason.
21 produced and showed on television and recorded on
22 radio.
23
Q.
That was one, just one of the 982 that they

25 of these groups?
361
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
A.
Yes, I looked into that, and I also paid
2 attention to what newspapers and polls said about
3 whether people were hearing these things.
4 the year I just mentioned, 87 of teenage girls
5 reported that they had seen a PSA within the last
6 week.
7
Q.
In 1969,
And did you compile a short collection of
8 some of the public service announcements that were
9 shown on television during Mr. Soffer's lifetime?
10
A.
Yes, I did.
Again, just a very sort
11 collection.
12 know his daughter, oldest daughter Joyce Soffer as
13 well as his second wife Lucille, both recall seeing
14 PSA's, and these would be examples of some of the
15 sorts of things that the general public would have
16 seen.
I could go on and on for hours.

Now, some of our jurors may recognize the
21 gentleman who appeared in that third PSA, but for
22 those who may not, can you tell the jury who that
23 was?
24
25
A.
Yes.
That actor was Larry Hagman, who was
a very, very well-known television actor from the
362
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 1960s through the 1980s.
2 called Dallas, which was a very, very big show in
3 that period of time and earlier in other shows as
4 well.
5 Society, helped to lead their crusade against
6 smoking.
He was a star of a show
So he was a chairman for the American Cancer
7 Q. And when did these PSAs run on television?
8 A. Those PSAs, they run from the 19 -- late
9
1950s up through the present.
They're public service
10 announcements.
11 actually a federal agency communica -- Federal
12 Communications Commission requires broadcast media to
13 carry public service announcements.
14 doing it for a really long time.
15 like Larry Hagman are a part of it.

So they've been
And celebrities
Now, in your research for this case, did
17 you also look at materials put out by various
18 religious organizations?
19 A. Yes, I did.
20 Q. And why did you review those materials for
21
22
this case?
A.
Again, I'm looking at the context so not
23 only Mr. Soffer but his neighbors and family and
24 people across the street and, you know, across town
25 and that kind of thing.
So I looked at a variety of
363
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 religious materials.
2 Jewish religious materials because he was a very
3 observant Jew, in fact, orthodox.
4 there are different groups, as there are within
5 Christianity, of course, within all the major
6 religions, Muslim, et cetera, so I looked at orthodox
7 materials.
8
9
Q.
I also looked specifically at
Within Judaism
And were you able to determine through
your research whether the dangers of smoking were
10 discussed in various orthodox Jewish religious
11 publications?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. And what did you find?
14 A. Well, I found that here again that they
15 were echoing what is a common message of religious
16 authorities among -- in the Jewish faith and in other
17 faiths, that your body is something is that's given
18 to you by God and you have no right to defile nor the
19 right to damage it, no right to create -- to commit
20 suicide by doing things which are suicidal, for
21 example, and so they opposed cigarette smoking.
22
Q.
And do you have an example to show the
23 jury about religious publication on the dangers of
24 smoking?
25
A.
Yes, I do.

BY MR. KOETHE:
3 Q. Can you describe this one for the jury?
4 A. Yes.
Again, this is a journal related to
5 orthodox Jewish thought.
6 the Jewish community of which he and his family were
7 members for a long, long time going back to his
8 grandparents through both sets of children all raised
9 as orthodox Jews.

12 called Smoking and the Halakhah, which is Jewish law
13 basically, the representation of traditions that Jews
14 adhere to.
15 he says, cigarette smoking represents a serious
16 hazard to health causing cancer of the lungs,
17 coronary disease and other fatal illnesses.
18 therefore, it has been estimated that every minute of
19 cigarette smoking reduces one's life expectancy by
20 that much.

BY MR. KOETHE:
8 Q. And again, briefly describe these for us.
9 A. Okay.
These are taken from different, you
10 know, newspapers from different cities where
11 Mr. Soffer lived and where he was a very avid reader
12 of the newspaper, so Los Angeles Times.
13 New York Daily News.
14 newspapers, the Evening Bulletin and the Sunday
15 Bulletin.
16 how can you do it, you know, try breathing exercises.
17 This is particular -- it might have to do with
18 relaxation.
19
We have the
These are two Philadelphia
And here they basically show, you know,
By the way, I should mention that the
20 foremost quitting program was devised by Wayne
21 McFarland, who was a resident of Philadelphia.
22 this is -- the five-day program was held all across
23 the world, and he was an innovator of it and a
24 cofounder.

3 talks about classes that were offered freely in this
4 area at this time.
So here's psyching yourself up, ways to get

And this
By the way, in Los Angeles to give you an
6 example of that within -- between 1962 and 1970, a
7 lot of those were years that he was there, the --
8 there were 300 free clinics offered in Los Angeles
9 for people who wanted to quit.
10
11
12
Q.
How does that relate to the issue of
public awareness of the dangers of smoking?
A.
Well, by telling people they should quit
13 this activity, they were also telling them that it
14 was a dangerous activity and you should stop.
15 worked into the awareness, even if people were
16 reading articles about how to quit, you know, they
17 might have been focusing on that part of it, although
18 those articles typically also contained an
19 explanation as to why every person should quit.
20
Q.
So it
Now, as part of your research, did you
21 come across something known as the Great American
22 Smokeout?
23 A. Yes, I did.
24 Q. And what was that?
25 A. Great American Smokeout was started in
367
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 1976 in California but the very next year spread
2 quickly to all parts of the United States.
3 you a sense of this, the very first year that it went
4 nationwide 1977, the mayor of Gainesville, Florida,
5 Mayor Aaron Green, announced he was going to do the
6 Great American Smokeout.
7 quit smoking for a day to show people that if you
8 could quit for a day, you could quit for a lifetime.
9 And so that was covered very widely in the press.
10
11
Q.
And that was a program to
And was that an event that occurred every
year?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. And did large numbers of people

participate in the Great American Smokeout?
15
A.
Yes.
To give you a sense of this, in that
16 very early time by 1978, there were 14 million -- 14
17 million participants in the Great American Smokeout.
18 And by the way, at some point Lucille Soffer also
19 participated in the Great American Smokeout.
20
Q.
And what kind of publicity did the Great
21 American Smokeout receive in the newspapers, let's
22 say?
23 A. Extensive publicity.

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 American Cancer Society that started in the 1970s.
2 And as I mentioned, Mayor Green of Gainesville was a
3 participant, as was Mrs. Soffer at some point.
4 this was a day where all of the news about the
5 hazards of smoking seemed to come together and
6 crystallize in one day and people across the country
7 took the pledge to quit.
8
9
10
11
Q.
And
Now, are these some examples of the
newspaper coverage concerning the Great American
Smokeout?
A.
Yes, they are, and they're just -- again,
12 I'm showing you here the Philadelphia Inquirer, the
13 Bulletin, et cetera, et cetera.
14 smokers taking the pledge, and it's timed right
15 before Thanksgiving, by the way, which probably also
16 made it a very memorable event.
17
18
Q.
These are all
Now, did the Great American Smokeout also
receive publicity on television?
19 A. Yes, it did, considerable publicity.
20 Q. And were celebrities active in promoting
21
the Great American Smokeout?
22 A. They were.
23 Q. Okay.
And did you bring a few television
24 clips showing publicity and promotion for the Great
25 American Smokeout?

here.
A.
Well, one of the first celebrities was who
5 drawn upon was Sammy Davis, Jr., you know, very
6 important American entertainer, very, very well
7 known, member of the Rat Pack, as they were called.
8 And he joined and was a spokesman for the Great
9 American Smokeout the very first year that it went
10 nationwide.
11 who -- very well-known actor who had starred in top
12 shows like the Mary Tyler Moore Show and Lou Grant,
13 and in fact, by the way, was just in a movie called
14 Up, which won an Academy Award last year and he
15 played the old grizzled grandpa person.
16 well-known characters.

You're also going to see Ed Asner,
(Recording played.)
BY MR. KOETHE:
Q.
Now, did you also see stories in your
22 research on whether smokers could reduce their health
23 risks by quitting smoking?
24 A. Yes, I saw many like that.
25 Q. And do you have a few examples to show the
371

A.
3
4

I have a few.
MR. KOETHE:
Okay.
Let's pull up
Hoffman 66.
BY MR. KOETHE:
6 Q. And just briefly describe these for us.
7 A. Thank you.
Well, as you see, one of the
8 earlier ones I've picked out is from 1967.
9 from Philadelphia and then 1975, the New York Post,
This is
10 and then again the Philadelphia Bulletin in 1980.
11 But these are typical of articles that were in every
12 town, every newspaper that I examined for this case.
13 And they said basically if you quit, you will start
14 to undo the harm that you've done to yourself.
15 example, you remember that PSA about the ashtray that
16 just got emptier and emptier by magic.
17 heals itself.
18
For
So the body
And again, this information was taken in.
19 Mr. Soffer eventually did quit he reported because he
20 was smoking -- coughing too much and, you know,
21 intended to limit the harm that was done to himself.
22 And he said it was easy to do, similar I suppose to
23 Ed Asner there.
24 thing that was very well publicized and people were
25 advised.
But in any case, this is the sort of
372
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
Now, did you also see publicity that
2 smokers in fact did quit after the 1964 surgeon
3 general's report?
4
A.
Yes.
There were repeated newspaper
5 stories that in a way showed the success of the
6 programs and the efforts of groups like the American
7 Cancer Society and many, many others who were
8 encouraging people to stop, so millions of people.
9 And every now and again, they'd update the article.
10 It's 13 million, no, now it's, you know, 20 million,
11 now it's 50 million, so lots.
12 Q. Okay.
13 A. I do.
14 Q. Let's pull up Hoffman 67.
15 A. Yeah.
Do you have a slide to show us?
I picked this one because this
16 happens to be from the period right after they put
17 the warning label on the packages for cigarettes,
18 which was as of January 1st, 1966.
19 of time, as you see, between 1966 and 1970 after the
20 warnings went on, 13 million Americans kicked the
21 habit.
22
Q.
So in that period
Let's talk briefly about warning labels.
23 I think you indicated that warning labels first
24 appeared on cigarette packages in 1966; is that
25 correct?
373
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. That's correct.
2 Q. And did you find discussions about warning
3 labels and awareness even before the 1966 time
4 period?
5 A.
Yes, there was -- you know, there was a
6 question about whether to put warning labels on.
7 have to remember, products -- today we're used to

That was
So in 1957, did Surgeon General Leroy
17 Burney address the issue of public and warning
18 labels? 19 A. Yes, he did.
20 Q. And what did your research show?
21 A. My research showed that Surgeon General
22 Burney, who was the immediate predecessor to Luther
23 Terry, believed that they had informed the public and
24 that the excellent media coverage, newspapers,
25 magazines and television had really saturated really

Q.

in the picture?
A.
Yes.
This is picture of Dr. Burney, who
11 was surgeon general for a number of years in the
12 1950s.
13 again, and his position was that the surgeon general
14 had informed the public through the excellent
15 coverage, as this says, of the press, radio and
16 television networks.
17
Q.
And as you see, in 1957 that question came up
Are you familiar with the National Cancer
18 Institute and who was the head of the National Cancer
19 Institute in 1957?

22
23
A.
Yes.
Dr. John Heller was the head of the
National Cancer Institute in that year.
Q.

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Dr. Heller addressed the issue of awareness and
2 warning labels back in 1957?
3
A.
Yes, he did.
And he, similarly to
4 Dr. Burney, believed that the press had done a great
5 job of letting people know about the link between
6 smoking and ill health and that additional labels
7 weren't necessary by that point, which was in 1957.

16 his belief in 1957, and so this was a period of time
17 when Mr. Soffer was still a young man and in fact in
18 the military, that Mr. Heller believed that the
19 newspapers, the radio, the television had done a
20 fabulous job, he says an excellent job of covering
21 the problem and in a very objective way he felt, and
22 he thought it was quite valuable.
23
Q.
And it was
After the surgeon general released his
24 report in 1964, did the American Medical Association
25 address the issue of warning labels and public

awareness?
A.
Yes.
The American Medical Association, of
3 course, is the largest organization of physicians,
4 doctors in the United States, and they believed in
5 1964 that the coverage had been so extensive that the
6 public had known for at least ten years about a

21 trends.

23 the health hazards of excessive smoking have been
24 well publicized for more than ten years and are now

Q.
Now, when Congress eventually passed the

12
Yes.
MR. KOETHE:
Let's take a look at 73.
BY MR. KOETHE:
13 Q. And again, tell us what this is.
14 A. Well, this is the first cigarette health
15 warning label, and this is the one that went on the
16 packages in 1961, so very shortly after that first
17 surgeon general's report, I mean, the report from
18 1964, Congress acted very -- the next year and then
19 the year after that, they were a put on on
20 January 1st.
21 know, members of the public widely saw, as we saw in
22 those statistics, including, by the way, Lucille and
23 Maurice Soffer.
24 and concluded they weren't ready to stop smoking yet,
25 but they did see them.
These were the labels that lots of, you
They discussed the warning labels
380

(212) 490-34301
Q.
Okay.
Let's go into the next slide.
Is
2 this is the warning label that appeared on cigarette
3 packs in -- beginning in 1970?
4
A.
Yes.
And what this partly shows, by the
5 way, is the ways in which the federal government also
6 smoking -- antismoking groups, they're refining their
7 approaches to how to get people to stop smoking.
8 know, they want to convince them to do it.
9 this is the next one.
And so
The surgeon general has
10 determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to
11 your health.
12 Q.
Okay.
Let's go to the next slide.
And
13 are these the set of rotating warnings that have
14 appeared on cigarette packs beginning in 1985?
15
A.
You
Yes, and as you see, again these are
16 further refinements of the warning labels.
17 went on all the packages rotating it, mixing it up so
18 that people be will looking for what the newest label
19 is.
20 note went on written or printed ads, so to speak,
21 after 1972.
22 that people saw in print.
23 1971, there were no ads on radio or television.
24
25
So these
And these also, by the way, it's important to
Q.
So these labels were also on any ads
I say print because after
So beginning in 1972, call print ads for
cigarettes had a warning label; is that correct?
381
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. That's correct.
2 Q. And all cigarette packs have carried the
3
warning label since 1966; is that right?
4 A. That's correct.
5 Q. Now, following the 1964 report and onward,
6 did the public continue to have high awareness levels
7 about the dangers of smoking?
8
9
10
11
A.
Yes.
The public has had continuously high
levels about the dangers of smoking.
Q.
And are you familiar with the National
Clearinghouse, Smoking and Health?
12 A. Yes, I am.
13 Q. And what was that?
14 A. Well, that was a part of this very broad
15 government effort to coordinate all the activities of
16 antismoking groups to marshall and coordinate their
17 resources.
18 was Dr. Daniel Horn.

awareness about the dangers of smoking at that time?
A.
Yes, he did.

4 top of your lungs and not tell anybody anything they
5 didn't already know about smoking.

Yes, I did.
MR. KOETHE:
Let's pull up 76.
BY MR. KOETHE:
11 Q. Just describe that briefly for us.
12 A. Well, this is a picture of Dr. Horn, and
13 you've seen Cuyler Hammond several times now, so I
14 suppose it's time we see Dr. Horn.
15 1968, you could stand on a roof top and shout smoking
16 is dangerous at the top of your lungs and you would
17 not be telling anyone anything they did not already
18 know.
19
Q.
As he said in
Professor Hoffman, just a few more
20 questions.
21 conclusions about the amount of information that has
22 been publicly available regarding the dangers of
23 cigarette smoking during Mr. Soffer's lifetime and in
24 the various locations where he lived?
25
A.
Can you sum up for the jury your
Yes.
To sum it up, I would say that there
383
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 was a spectacular amount of information available to
2 the public that members of the general public in
3 Mr. Soffer's lifetime heard, read, saw, and that this
4 information would have been impossible to avoid, and
5 that it came from all directions, really truly all
6 directions.
7 to avoid because little children could tell you about
8 it and grandpas and grandmas might tell you about it,
9 and their school teachers would tell you and your
And one reason why it was so impossible
10 preachers or rabbis would tell you and the newspaper
11 and the TV and the movies all talked about this all
12 the time from 19 -- in this period of time.
13 result of this is I believe that he would have known
14 it, and in fact he said he knew it.
15
Q.
The
And whether someone lived in Philadelphia,
16 Texas, California, New York, Wichita, St. Louis or
17 Gainesville during Mr. Soffer's lifetime, would they
18 have received a large amount of information about the
19 health risks of smoking and whether smoking could be
20 difficult to quit, habit-forming or addictive?
21
A.
Yes, he would have heard this and members
22 of this generation would have heard it wherever they
23 were in the United States, including the particular
24 cities in which Mr. Soffer lived.
25
Q.
How difficult would it have been for
384
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 someone living in the areas where Mr. Soffer lived
2 during his life to have avoided this information?
3 A. I don't think it was avoidable in any way.
4 Q. Any question in your mind about that?
5 A. None.
6 Q. Now, Professor, I know that you would have
7 preferred to be here in person live to speak with the
8 jury, but could you just tell us briefly what has
9 prevented you from doing that?
10
A.
Yes.
I must say I'm very disappointed not

CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WARRINER:
6 Q. Good afternoon, Dr. Hoffman.
7 A. Very well, thank you.
8 Q. The last sort of five minutes of your
9
How are you?
testimony was conclusory in nature, and it seemed to
10 me, the impression I got is it's your belief and
11 opinion that virtually every American alive over the
12 age of, say, six or seven years old from the '50s
13 until today has been inundated with information about
14 the risks of smoking.
Would that be fair?
15 A. Yes, that's fair.
16 Q. And are you familiar with -- jury's
17 already heard that, but are you familiar with the
18 fact that this year alone about 400,000 Americans are
19 going to die in smoking-related disease?
20
21
22
23
24
25
A.
I am familiar with that statistic being in
the newspapers, yes.
Q.
Okay.
Do you have any reason to dispute
that as an accurate number?
A.
No, but not being a, you know, a
statistician or public health official, I couldn't
386

www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301

3
verify it either, but I do know that's reported.
Q.
But that's Google-able from the Centers
for Disease Control in two seconds, right?
4 A. That's correct.
5 Q. And those 400,000 people that are going to
6 die this year from a smoking-related illness, the
7 majority of those people are going to be up in years
8 a little bit, correct?
9
A.
I don't know.
I would -- you know, I know
10 that it's a more common disease among the elderly
11 than amongst very young people.
12
Q.
Right.
Well, there are not a lot of
13 20-year-olds dropping over dead from lung cancer
14 because of smoking cigarettes, correct?
15
A.
Lung cancer is not only caused by
16 cigarettes.
17 killed from it, but I do believe that you're right,
18 it's a disease of middle age and older.
19
Q.
There are some young people who are
So those people would be among the people
20 that you've testified, those 400,000 people that are
21 going to die this year alone from smoking cigarettes,
22 would have been exposed to all of the things in
23 various forms or another that you showed the jury in
24 three or four hours of testimony, correct?
25
A.
Yes.
Most of those people would have been
387
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 living or many of them would have been living in the
2 same time period.
3
4
5
Q.
And they would have seen many of those
things that you showed the jury?
A.
They would have been exposed to all kinds
6 of information similar to them.
7 all read the same articles, not living in the same
8 parts of the country.
9 learned about this in school.
They may not have
But yes, they would have all
They would have heard
10 it from family and friends -- pardon me -- and they
11 certainly would have seen it on television and in
12 movies.
13 Q.
And despite all of that information, each
14 of those that will die this year continued to smoke
15 cigarettes in sufficient quantities and for a
16 sufficient period of time of time to cause them fatal
17 disease or the illness, correct?
18
A.
Well, the people who are dying of lung
19 cancer, those of who were smokers, yes, they
20 continued to smoke despite this information.
21
Q.
This is 2010, and if 300,000 people die a
22 year, that means approximately a thousand people die
23 a day from smoking-related illnesses.
24 during the period of time that you've been on the
25 witness stand today, there have probably be a hundred
And that means
388
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 people that have succumbed to smoking-related
2 illness; would that be fair?
3
A.
You're the one doing the math on that, but
4 yes, people die all the time and, you know, every day
5 there's some sort of fatality.
6
Q.
And that's just 2010.
If we go back -- I
7 don't believe the statistics on this.
8 them and I'm sure the jury will have heard a lot
9 about them during the plaintiff's side of the case.
We could check
10 But last year approximately 400 people -- 400,000
11 people have died from smoking-related illness and
12 disease.
13 they likewise were exposed to years and years and
14 years of the kind of information that you showed the
15 jury?
16
A.
Would it be similarly your testimony that
Well, my research revealed that people
17 were, yes, exposed for many decades to information
18 about the hazards of smoking and the importance of
19 quitting.
20
Q.
And currently as we speak today, if you
21 take those 800,000 people that will die -- have died
22 in 2009 and will die in 2010 away from the smoking
23 population, that still means that today in the
24 United States of America there are over 50 million
25 smokers.
You're aware of that, correct?
389
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
A.
I don't know the current number on the
2 number of smokers.
3 does remind -- what pops out at me is my own
4 knowledge that it's very important that 50 million
5 quit as well.
6
Q.
Of course, the number 50 million
I understand that, but if you know that,
7 then I'm sure because of your thousands of hours of
8 work in this case, you also know that there are
9 approximately 50 million smokers today in the
10 United States of America.
11 at the CDC, correct?
12
A.
That's easily Google-able
That may be, but you have to understand
13 that's outside the scope of my research in this case,
14 which is looking at the years that Mr. Soffer was
15 alive and that he and his cohort, if you will, were
16 exposed to this information.
17
Q.
Well, okay.
Then I'll be fair to you
18 then.
19 were about 60 million smokers in 1950, correct?
20
21
22
Let's go back to 1950 when he started.
A.
There
I know the percentage, but I don't know
the number offhand.
Q.
You already told us in your direct
23 examination there were about 175 million people
24 living in the United States in 1950, correct?
25
A.
I actually think there was 1955, '56, '57.

4
Q.
Would the number be substantially
different for 1950?
A.
I don't know.
It actually increased by
about two to three million every year, I believe.
5 Q. Okay.
6 A. So it would be different.
7 Q. The percentage in 1950 was about
8
9
10
11
50 percent, correct?
A.
I'm sorry, the percentage of what was
50 percent?
Q.
The percentage of people in the
12 United States who smoke d in 1950 was about
13 50 percent, correct?
14
A.
Actually the majority of Americans never
15 smoked and of those, about half quit.
16 highest it ever got was about 45 percent in the mid
17 1950s.
18
Q.
It was -- the
My question, ma'am, respectfully was in
19 1950 was the percentage of people that smoked about
20 50 percent.
21 or how many quit.
I didn't ask you anything about who quit
22 A. Then the answer is no.
23 Q. Okay.
24
25
What was the -- what was the
percentage in 1950 then?
A.
Oh, you know, I just don't recall the
391
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 percentage in 1950, but since 1954 was the peak, it
2 would have been less than 1954.
3 Q. In absolute --
4 A. I mean, 1950.
5 Q. In absolute numbers, your testimony is
6 that 1954 is the peak number of smokers in the
7 United States?
8 A. No.
9 Q. I didn't think so.
10
you're trying to say then, please.
11
12
Could you tell me what
A.
I was saying that it was the peak in terms
of the percentage of people smoking.
13 Q. Let's talk --
14 A. So that's -- by peak, that's what I mean.
15 It's not absolute numbers because of course the
16 population of the country has grown.
17
18
Q.
In absolute numbers, how many people
smoked in 1950?
19
A.
As I told you, I don't know the -- I don't
20 know either the percentage or I don't recall right
21 now.
22 look back at my Gallup polls.
23
24
25
I've seen it before, I'm sure, but I'd have to
Q.
Would it be fair to say it was millions
and millions of people?
A.
Yeah, I think it would -- you'd have to
392
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

(212) 490-34301
say it was millions.
2 Q. And in 19 --
3 A. Forty-two percent out of a hundred and --
4
5
let's say 150,000 -- 150 million, then yes.
Q.
All right.
And in 1960 would it be fair
6 to say there were millions and millions of Americans
7 that smoked?
8 A.
I'm sorry, 1950, did you say?
9 Q.
1960.
10 A.
1960?
11 Q.
In 1970 was it -- would it be fair to say
Yes, that would be true then also.
12 to millions and millions and millions of Americans
13 smoked? 14 A. Millions smoked, millions didn't.
15 Q. And in 1970 would it be fair to say that
16
millions and millions of people smoked?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. 1980?
19 A. Millions smoked, millions didn't.
20 Q. In 1990 millions and millions of Americans
21
22
23
24
25
That would be the same answer.
smoked, correct?
A.
Yes, millions smoked and millions have
quit.
Q.
And as we sit here today, with respect,
ma'am, I am not asking how many quit.
I haven't

MR. KOETHE:
You said
Object to the form.
BY MR. WARRINER:
Q.
In 2010, as we sit here today, do you know
in absolute numbers how many people smoke cigarettes
on a daily basis?
A.
No.
And again, that was outside the scope
of my research in this case.
Q.
Would it be fair to say it's millions and
millions?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Every single one of those people that has
17 smoked cigarettes in the United States of America
18 since 1950 according to your testimony has been
19 inundated with information about the health risks of
20 smoking, correct?
21 A. Yes, that's correct.
22 Q. And those people, especially the ones that
23 end up dying from a smoking-related disease continued
24 to smoke despite all of that information; is that
25 correct?
394
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
A.
Yes, they smoked despite the repeated
warnings.
3
Q.
And cigarette manufacturers despite the
4 fact that all of these people are dying from smoking,
5 have continued to sell cigarettes, correct?
6 A. Yes, they continue to sell cigarettes.
7 Q. What kind of cigarettes did Mr. Soffer
8 smoke?
9 cigarettes did Mr. Soffer start smoking in the early
10
When did he -- excuse me.
What kind of
1950s?
11
A.
Now you've stumped me.
I just don't
12 recall the brand.
13 brand, but I don't recall whether -- which one it
14 was.
15
16
I mean, I know it was a Reynolds
It might have been Pall Malls.
Q.
Can I refresh your recollection by showing
you this red pack of Pall Mall cigarettes?
17 A. Thank you.
18 Q. And that's what Mr. Soffer started smoking
19
20
Yeah, okay, it was Pall Malls.
in 1951, '2, '3, somewhere around there?
A.
You know, his children said he started
21 smoking in the service as a result of the stress of
22 being in the military, so he would have -- that would
23 have been after 1954.
24
25
Q.
Did you read Hermione Soffer's deposition,
ma'am?
395
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Pardon me.
2 Q. Did you read Hermione Soffer's deposition?
3 A. Yes, I did, but you'd have to refresh my
4
recollection about it.
5 Q. Who is Hermione Soffer?
6 A. I think that that was an aunt actually.
7 Q. What was her testimony about when her
8
9
nephew started smoking cigarettes?
A.
And I just am not remembering what her
10 testimony was about that.
11 more vividly what his wife and his children said.
12
Q.
I'm reading -- remembering
None of which knew him when he started
13 smoking cigarettes, correct, neither his wife nor his
14 children?
15
A.
Yes, although you -- I do recall that
16 Hermione Soffer didn't live near them and they didn't
17 have a lot of contact, so that's the part I do
18 remember.
19
Q.
Would it be fair to say that Mr. Soffer's
20 children were not around when Mr. Soffer started
21 smoking cigarettes?
22 A. Absolutely.
23 Q. Would it be fair to say that Mr. Soffer's
24 wife was not around when Mr. Soffer started smoking
25 cigarettes?
396
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. I think that that's true.
2 Q. During the direct examination, you showed
3 many news clips and you showed some movie stars and
4 you showed some music stars, all of whom contributed
5 one way or another to the debate or the discussion
6 about smoking and health, correct?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. And one of the people that you showed was
9
Harry Reasoner, correct?
10 A. That's correct.
11 Q. As a student and teacher of American
12
history, who is Harry Reasoner?
13 A. He's a television reporter.
14 Q. Was he a famous person?
15 A. Oh, yes, you know, one of the better known
16
17
18
19
television reporters.
Q.
I mean, he's like in the top five or six
all time with Cronkite, Huntley, Brinkley, Murrow?
A.
I don't know.
I'm not an expert on that,
20 but I would rank him high.
21 in the top five, but he certainly is very well known.
I'm not sure he would be
22 Q. Part of Americana, was he not?
23 A. Yes, I think so.
24 Q. And he was an eager and willing
25
participant in the debates back in the '60s about
397
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 smoking and health, right?
2 newscasts right after the surgeon general issued
3 their report in '64 on the issue of smoking and
4 health, right?
5
A.
He ran hour-long
I wouldn't characterize him as a
6 participant in the debate because he was a reporter,
7 which is a little different, in fact quite different
8 from being a participant; but he was reporting on
9 that subject, and yes, he did two hour-long specials
10
11
on the subject.
Q.
And at that point in time because of his
12 position, his knowledge, he was as up to speed on the
13 current knowledge about smoking and health as anybody
14 at that time, correct?
15
16
A.
I think he was one of the best informed
members of the general public on the subject.
17 Q. Are you aware of the fact he was a smoker?
18 A. Yes, I am.
19 Q. Are you aware of the fact he died of lung
20 cancer? 21 A. Yes, I am.
22 Q. He was taken away from us at what age of
23 lung cancer?
24 A. I don't recall what age he was.
25 Q. Do you remember you showed during your
398
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 direct examination some pictures of Edward R. Murrow
2 and you gave some glowing accounts of what a famous
3 and honorable man he was?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. He was a war correspondent, correct?
6 A. That's correct.
7 Q. And if you Google Edward R. Murrow and put
8 in the word "photograph," you will be hard pressed to
9 find a picture of Edward R. Murrow without a
10
11
cigarette sticking out of his mouth, correct?
A.
Oh, I don't know that.
I think, you know,
12 you would find somewhere he was smoking because he
13 did smoke on television, but there would be other
14 pictures probably where he wasn't smoking.
15 Q.
16 strike that.
17
And are you aware of the fact -- well,
Mr. Murrow in 1955 ran a very extensive
18 two-part program on the issues of smoking and health.
19 Do you remember that?
20 A. Yes, I do.
21 Q. And Mr. Murrow, similarly to Mr. Reasoner,
22 would have been because of his position and knowledge
23 as up to speed in 1955 as anybody with respect to the
24 issues regarding smoking and health; would you agree?
25
A.
Yes, I would agree with that.
399
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
And despite the fact that he was as
2 knowledgeable as he was, he also continued to smoke
3 four packs of cigarettes a day until he died of lung
4 cancer in the '60s, correct?
5
6
A.
I don't know how much he smoked, but he
did die of lung cancer, yes, and continued to smoke.
7
Q.
Bill Coleman, who you showed from the
8 Perry Mason show, do you remember you showed him not
9 only before he succumbed or got sick from lung cancer
10 but also after he got sick and before he died doing a
11 PSA.
Remember that?
12 A. 13 It's Talman.
14 Q. Say it again, please.
15 A. Talman, Bill Talman, T-a-l-m-a-n.
16 Q. Oh, I'm sorry.
17 A. It's all right.
18
19
Yes, but I think you have his name wrong.
I'm sorry, what was the
rest of your question?
Q.
Bill Talman being a member of the American
20 public was as exposed to all of the information that
21 you showed the jury as anyone else, correct?
22
A.
I believe he would have been just -- he
23 was a member of the general public.
24 been aware of the risks he was taking.
25
Q.
He would have
And you showed us a picture of him looking
400
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 fairly haggard probably after his cancer diagnosis
2 telling people on television not to smoke, correct?
3 A. Yes, that's right.
4 Q. Did he ever repent before he was diagnosed
5 with lung cancer and give that message to anybody, or
6 was it only after he was dying of lung cancer that he
7 told people not to smoke?
8 MR. KOETHE:
9 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
Are you asking did he
10 make other PSAs like the one he did when he
11 was dying?
12
13
BY MR. WARRINER:
Q.
Did he ever make a public service
14 announcement warning people to not smoke before he
15 was diagnosed with lung cancer?
16 A. No, I don't believe he did.
17 Q. How about Yul Brynner?
18
Did Yul Brynner --
he also did PSAs, right?
19 A. Yes, Yul Brynner also did a --
20 Q. While he --
21 A. -- rather similar PSA.
22 Q. While he was dying of lung cancer,
23
24
25
correct?
A.
Right, after he was diagnosed and was very
sick, he made a PSA.

4 MR. KOETHE:
5 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
You know, I don't know

Sammy Davis, Jr., you showed us a picture
He was singing Smoke, Smoke, Smoke That
14 A. Right.
15 Q. And then you showed us a PSA of him after
16
17
he was sick, correct?
A.
18 sick.
19 was sick.
Well, we also saw a PSA before he was
It wasn't after he was sick.
It was before he

21 A. Well, I am pretty sure, but I'm not a
22 hundred percent.
23 not a part of the PSA.
24 with lung cancer, but my understanding anyway was
25 that he made that PSA beforehand.
I don't recall -- it certainly was
He did become sick, however,
402
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
All right.
And Bill Talman, just going
2 back, we forgot to mention that I think you -- he
3 finally died from his lung cancer, correct?
4 A. Yes, he did die.
5 Q. Sammy Davis, Jr. likewise was taken from
6 us early because after lung cancer because he smoked,
7 right?
8 A. Yes, he died of lung cancer.
9 Q. And Peter Jennings.
Do you know who Peter
10 Jennings is?
11 A. Yes, I do.
12 Q. Tell the jury of what -- you know, what
13
14
position Pete Jennings plays in Americana.
A.
Well, probably many of you would have seen
15 Peter Jennings.
16 I played some clips from ABC news, since that's --
17 that was a channel that Joseph Soffer said that his
18 father watched.
19
Q.
I assume he's a recognizable face.
Peter Jennings in the line of preeminent
20 and respected journalists took his place behind
21 Huntley, Brinkley, Cronkite, Rather, then came
22 Jennings, correct, sort of in that line?
23
A.
I think that Rather and Jennings were on
24 different -- different channels.
25 anchor, and so the anchormen, you know, always have a

lot of play, and yes, he was an important one.
Q.
No.
He was a little more contemporary
3 obviously than Morrow was and Reasoner, right?
4 was the next generation?
He
5 A. That's correct.
6 Q. So by the time Jennings was in his adult
7 male smoking status, he had heard even more intense
8 message, a more intense message about the dangers of
9 smoking and health than had Murrow and Reasoner,
10
11
correct?
A.
Yes.
Jennings was a member of that gen --
12 little bit later generation.
13 about that.
14 generation, he chose to smoke and he did.
15 suffered terrible consequences and he died of lung
16 cancer.
17 Q.
You're quite right
And like some members of that
And he
So Peter Jennings, despite the fact he was
18 exposed to much of the stuff that you have showed the
19 jury today, continued to smoke cigarettes in
20 sufficient quantities and for a sufficient period of
21 time to cause him to a contact lung cancer and die
22 prematurely, correct?
23 MR. KOETHE:
24 THE WITNESS:
25
Object to the form.
Well, what I can tell
you, I -- you know, I didn't ever follow

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 his particular diagnosis that clearly, but
2 yes, he did engage in risky behavior.
3 made poor choices.
4 we're still talking about Jennings here --
5 was actually Canadian, so he would have
6 gotten that from his government.
7 have laws very similar to ours.
8 quite right.
9 eventually died of lung cancer.

He chose to smoke anyway and
BY MR. WARRINER:
11 Q. Have you ever smoked cigarettes, ma'am?
12 A. No.
13 Q. Have you ever been addicted to any
14
substance?
15 A. No.
16 Q. Do you remember the PSA where Mr. Jennings
17 in 1988 said to the American public, even people in
18 their seventies can quit now and reduce their risk of
19 contracting a smoking-related illness?
20
A.
I don't believe that was a PSA.
I think
21 that was a news -- a news account.
22 we just saw, in other words or we're talking about --
Is that the one
23 Q. Maybe -- maybe I misspoke.
24 A. That's right.
25 Q. You showed it.
No.
You remember him --
405
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Okay.
2 Q. -- mentioning some like that?
3 A. Oh, absolutely.
4
I just -- you said a PSA,
so you confused me a little bit right then.
5
Q.
Now, let's -- you mentioned this during
6 your direct testimony, but I just want to set the
7 record 100 percent straight.
8 A. Sure.
9 Q. Mr. Soffer quit smoking cigarettes, did he
A. Yes, he did.
10
11
not?
He told his wife it was easy
12 once he had made up his mind to do that, and he -- he
13 did quit smoking a year before he was diagnosed.
14
15
Q.
Mr. Soffer quit smoking cigarettes before
he was diagnosed with cancer, did he not?
16 A. Yes, he did.
17 Q. And much of the public service message to
18 smokers for years and years and years was if you
19 smoke -- stop now, it will greatly educe your risk of
20 contracting disease, correct?
21
A.
Yes, that was the message because it
22 accompanied the other message that he'd also been
23 getting consistently, which is that the greater the
24 dose that you're given yourself and the longer period
25 of time that you give yourself this dose, the harder

www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 it is own your body.
2 smoking, the better.
3
Q.
So yes, the sooner you stop
But Mr. Soffer -- had he not gotten
4 cancer, had he quit at the age he did, he would have
5 reduced his dose far less -- to a far less degree
6 than if he'd have kept smoking into his sixties or
7 seventies, correct?
8
9
10
A.
Well, he would have gotten a greater dose
if he had smoked another 20 years.
Is that what
you're saying?
11 Q. Yes, ma'am.
12 A. Yeah.
13 Q. I mean, he quit in his fifties, right?
14 A. He quit, yes, when he started coughing a
15 lot, and his wife, who had been a nurse for many,
16 many decades, said that yes, he finally did it, he
17 finally quit.
18
Q.
He did exactly what the public health
19 people had been telling him to do for years, possibly
20 not as soon as he should have, but he did what they
21 told him to do, did he not?
22
A.
Yeah.
But I don't think it's fair to
23 characterize by saying that he followed their advice
24 because their advice was don't start smoking.
25 had that advice when he was a kid, well before he
And he
407
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 started smoking, whenever he did start smoking.
2 he didn't follow that advice.
3 follow the advice after he started smoking, which was
4 given for so many decades before he stopped that I
5 think it's pretty hard to characterize him as having
6 followed advice.
7
Q.
So
And then he didn't
The predicate question that I asked you
8 was the public health people had been telling smokers
9 for years stopping now will greatly reduce your risk
10 of contracting disease.
11 the message?
12 A.
13
14
Yes.
Do you remember that part of
Smoking will reduce your -- quitting
smoking will your susceptibility.
Q.
Right.
I'm not asking you about when he
15 started.
16 I'm not asking you about what messages he had before
17 he started.
18 I'm asking you to direct your attention to, please,
19 is the public health message that stopping now will
20 greatly reduce your risk of contracting disease.
21 you focus on that for a second, please?
I'm not asking you about why he started.
The part of the public service message
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. With regard to that part of the public
24 service message, which actually is one of the
25 rotating warnings on the packs of cigarettes,
Can
408
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
correct?
2 A. That's right, after 19 -- mid 1980.
3 Q. Mr. Soffer did what the public health
4
service had told him to do in that regard, correct?
5 A. Eventually, he did.
6 Q. Do you remember during your direct
7 examination showing us the sort of handsome picture
8 of cowboy Tex Williams right before you played the
9 song Smoke, Smoke, Smoke That Cigarette?
10 A. Yeah, I sure do.
11 Q. He was another one of our American sort
12 of -- I wouldn't actual him a treasure, but he was a
13 prominent country/western kind star in his day,
14 correct?
15
A.
I'm not sure -- he became prominent
16 because of that song.
17 break-through.
18 but that song made him famous.
19
Q.
That was his, you know,
He wasn't probably the best known,
And he, like everybody else that we've
20 talked about in here today was exposed to the public
21 health message about the risk of smoking and disease,
22 correct?
23
A.
Yes.
You know, different -- different
24 part of it, but yes, he certainly, you know, would
25 have -- in school and in popular culture.
Of course,
409
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 that was -- that song was from 1947, so he was
2 talking about the general harms that people have been
3 told about for many generations, and he should have
4 been exposed to that too.
5
Q.
And you showed us a montage or collage or
6 whatever you want to call it of many people who had
7 sung that song.
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. How many people that you showed on the
10
11
screen, ma'am, died from smoking cigarettes?
A.
I don't -- I don't know.
I know some of
12 those people are still alive and with us, of course.
13 Tex Williams himself died, I think it was pancreatic
14 cancer.
15 I know there's one other.
16 So in that montage of 11 people, I'm aware that two
17 died of cancer --
I'm not a hundred percent of that and -- oh,
Oh, Sammy Davis, Jr. died.
18 Q. Okay.
19 A. -- and some are, of course, still alive.
20 Q. I just wanted to make sure that we talked
21 about Tex Williams, another one of the people that
22 you put up there that was exposed to the message who
23 died from smoking cigarettes early, correct?
24 A. Yep.
25 Q. I want to go through a couple more people.
It's a dangerous thing to do.

(212) 490-34301 Obama has been exposed throughout his life to the
2 warnings against risky behaviors of all types,
3 including smoking.
4
Q. And he has two young children, does he
6 A. Yes, he does.
7 Q. Went to Harvard law school?
8 A. Yes, he did.
9 Q. Very educated man, is he not?
10 A. Yes, he is.
11 Q. Would you expect him to know that smoking

not?
is not healthy?
13 A.
14 expect.
15 Q.
16
17
He has said he knows this, so yes, I would
You're also aware of the fact that he's
tried many times to quit and cannot?
A.
I don't know.

I know he has talked
20 about quitting.

Q.
-- your professional training is in
history correct?
3 A. Yes, that's true.
4 Q. You are not trained at all in the science
5
of addiction medicine, are you?
6 A. No, I'm not a physician, nor a scientist.
7 Q. And as a result of that, you are not
8 prepared because of your lack of expertise to give an
9 opinion as to how smokers receive messages about the
10
11
ill effects of smoking and health, are you?
A.
I can testify as to the messages that they
12 receive about the ill health -- ill health effects of
13 smoking, yes.
14 quite a while now.
15
Q.
I have been talking about that for
That's not my question, ma'am.
You are
16 ill prepared because of your training to talk about
17 how the smoker receives all of the messages and
18 processes that information that you have been showing
19 us all day long, are you?
20 A. I would not agree with that statement.
21 Q. And would you please explain to me what is
22 it about being trained as a history professor that
23 would allow you to get into the minds of smokers and
24 testify as to how they perceive messages given to
25 them?

Object to the form.
I'm not a psychologist

4 brain functioning or synapses or any of
5 that sort of thing.
6 communicate and I think I have a very
7 strong bedrock of evidence to ascertain and
8 to claim is that this message was given and
9 the message was received.
What I can, however,
You saw some
10 polls, for example, where smokers were
11 actually more attentive to the messages
12 that the government aimed at them than
13 nonsmokers were.
14 very much of a message received.
15
16
So to me that is evidence
BY MR. WARRINER:
Q.
I didn't ask you about whether they
17 received the message or not.
18 this message has been out there for a long time and
19 it has been heard by everybody in this room,
20 everybody that you put up on the screen, all the
21 people that I just talked about that have died of
22 lung cancer all over the years.
23 that.
24
25
I will grant you that
I will stipulate to
My question to you, though, is very
pointed.
You are not equipped being trained as a
432
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 historian to talk about how smokers and people
2 receive the messages in their brain regarding smoking
3 and health, are you?
4
A.
Receive the message in their brain,
5 it's -- you know, if what you're talking about is a
6 neural process, then no, I'm not an expert on that.
7
Q.
And forget the biochemistry of it.
Let's
8 talk about the psychology or psychiatry of it.
9 you equipped because of your training as a historian
10
Are
to give this jury an expert opinion about that?
11 A. No, not on psychology and psychiatry.
12 Q. So what you are equipped to do, if I can
13 sum this up, is to do research, go to archives and
14 libraries and to collect all of the information and
15 to tell this jury what was out there, how pervasive
16 it was, and whether or not people received it, but
17 you are not equipped nor are you attempting today to
18 try to suggest to this jury that you know how people
19 receive and process that information; is that
20 correct?
21
22
23
A.
I don't think that's a fair
characterization.
Q.
Well, you tell me then how it is a history
24 professor is equipped to give an expert opinion on
25 the subject of how people perceive and react to
433
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 information?
2 A.
Well, this is actually a very important
3 part of what historians do all of the time in our --
4 in my profession, which is to explain how the world
5 changes and how people take information and start to
6 behave differently, start to talk differently, start
7 to act and feel differently.
8 cause and effect, not just here's information, but we
9 explain the effect of the information as well very,
10
And we explain so that
very much so.
11
And I think that my testimony shows that
12 there was a tremendous effect on smokers, 50 million
13 of whom have quit.
14 not prepared to say why they didn't quit, but I know
15 that many of their fellow smokers did.
16 show you how even nonsmokers changed their behavior
17 and attitudes over time.
18 in the interest of brevity, I won't go on and on, but
19 there are a lot of examples that I could draw upon to
20 show you that.
21
Q.
Yes, some did not quit.
All right.
And I am
And I can
You know, I could -- again,
Then I want you to explain to
22 this jury, since you're not equipped nor trained to
23 talk about addiction, I want you to explain to this
24 jury how it is that millions and millions and
25 millions of people have continued to start smoking
434

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

9 families and yet they continue to do it.
People do lots of things that reflect poor

12 tell you that however even despite that, behaviors do
13 change.

That's sort of the human dilemma in a way.

The smoking went way, way down.

How many children will start -- children,
17 well I'll define that by kids under the age of 18.
18 How many kids under the age of 18 will start smoking
19 today?

22
A.
I don't know.
That wasn't -- again, that
wasn't within the scope of my research.

It's in hundreds of governmental

6 recall, what I was interested in is with

I doubt that document has
But again, if you
BY MR. WARRINER:
Q.
Do you know what the statistics show with
12 regard to how many children under the age of 18 start
13 smoking every day?
14
A.
I don't know what the current statistic is
15 nationwide or, you know, in Florida, for example.
16 varies.
17 Q.
It
Have you known ever for any jurisdiction
18 what the number of people under the age of 18 is that
19 start smoking every day?
20
A.
Well, every day varies over time.
I mean,
21 we -- this is an historical question, so yes, I did
22 some research at one time on what we call prevalence
23 for the 1990s.
24 but it has become quite low.
25 different now in this year and in this generation
I honestly don't remember the figure,
It's very, very
436
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 from preceding generations, but there is some number.
2 I don't recall the number that exists that would be
3 correct currently.
4
Q.
Would you consider 4,000 children under
5 the age of 18 starting smoking on average on a daily
6 basis in the 1990s to be very low?
7 A.
8 figure.
9 Q.
10 figure.
11 A.
I don't know that that is the correct
Assume for me that it's the correct
Would you consider that to be low?
Historically as a percentage of the
12 population, yes, it would be very low.
13 has declined very -- very, very considerably.
14
Q.
I mean, it
In order to make that statement, I assume
15 that you can quote me a statistic from an earlier
16 period of time.
17
A.
Please do.
Oh, I think we had as one of the documents
18 earlier today something like 49 percent had tried
19 smoking or started smoking, and that was 1956, I
20 believe.
21 you look at these prevalence statistics, I -- we
22 always look at these things in context.
23 know that in the one year I was doing very specific
24 research on in California that more children tried
25 marijuana than tried tobacco.
Of course, keep in mind, by the way, when
I happen to
And of course, that's

3 always.
4 Q.
5
I won't argue with you with that one.
Prior to being contacted in this case by
6 another paid cigarette witness, had you ever
7 consulted with any tobacco company before?

9 THE WITNESS:

Before I started this

Q.
We -- have you forwarded a copy of your CV
to us?
16 A. Uh-huh.
17 Q. Are you familiar with your current CV?
18 A. Yes, I am.
19 Q. For those on the jury, they probably heard
20 people explain what a CV is before, your testimony
21 will go on, but is that basically a professional
22 resume? 23 A. Yeah.
24 Q. And for people in academia as you and even
25
It's a -- it's a kind of resume.
professional people, often they will have a CV and
438
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 over time they will update it and they will add to
2 it, and it has your publications, your professional
3 associations, your positions at the university,
4 things like that, correct?
5
6
7
A.
Yeah.
It will contain some of what you
do, much of what you do.
Q.
All right.
The R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
8 Company called you to this courtroom today as an
9 expert on issues relating to smoking and health.
10 This is your CV.
11 the word "tobacco" or "cigarette" in that resume,
12 please.
13 A.
Would you do me a favor and find
That doesn't appear in my resume.
There
14 might -- those words would appear in some of the
15 books I've written, but they would not appear in my
16 resume.
17 Q.
So in your professional resume, which
18 talks about your accomplishments, your writings, your
19 presentations, your speeches and all of those things,
20 the word "tobacco" or "cigarette" does not even
21 appear?
22 A.
No, it's not in my resume.
23 Q.
Let's take a quick look at the
24 University -- sorry, San Diego State University bio
25 for you.
That's available on the web, correct?
439
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Yes, that is.
2 Q. That's quite a flattering picture, I might
4 A. Thank you.
5 Q. That's what the university basically
3
add.
6 suggests your expertise and some of your credentials
7 are, correct?
8
9
10
A.
Oh, no, I would be incorrect to say the
university suggests that.
People write their own
introductions.
11 Q. So you wrote this?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. And is there a mention at all in there
14 about this expertise that you have in issues of
15 smoking and tobacco and health and stuff like that?
16
A.
Well, as you can see, this is a brief
17 paragraph, and no, it doesn't talk about that.
18 also doesn't talk about some other things that I do
19 professionally as well that are important parts of my
20 everyday life and work.
It
21 Q. You have a personal website too, correct?
22 A. Yes, I do.
23 Q. Is that a picture of it as it appears

currently?
A.
I believe that's probably -- yes, that's

3
current.
Q.
And if I'm not mistaken, this talks about
up an upcoming novel you have?
4 A. That's correct.
5 Q. That's currently titled In the Lion's Den?
6 A. That's correct.
7 Q. And that's a novel about the civil war,
8
right?
9 A. Yes, it is.
10 Q. That doesn't have anything to do with
11
smoking and health, does it I?
12 A. No.
13 Q. And --
14 A. I do many projects that don't.
15 Q. -- I notice that you are going to rename
16
this book.
No.
You're going to call it Broken Promises.
17 A. That's correct.
18 Q. And you have many links in there.
There
19 are several of those.
20 that go to your other presentations you've given,
21 other opinion articles you've written, other books
22 you've written, none of those anywhere are specific
23 to the issues that you've testified about today, are
24 they?
25
A.
No.
If we follow those links out
They go to things that are related to

www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 that book and to that project.
2 things like, for example, my cruise lectures.
3 lecture very frequently on cruises, and that's not on
4 my CV either and nor does this go to my CV.
They wouldn't go to
5 Q. Did you say cruises?
6 A. Yes, I give historical lectures.
7 Q. You mean you go on cruises and give
8
9
10
I
lectures or you lecture about cruises?
A.
No.
I go on cruises and give lectures
about --
11 Q. I see.
12 A. -- historical destinations.
13 Q. Okay.
Now, you were first contacted by
14 another historian who was already working for
15 cigarette companies, correct?
16 A. Yes, that's correct.
17 Q. And prior to that time, had you done any
18
19
work at all in the smoking and health field?
A.
I'm trying to think about the timing here.
20 I was -- I got involved in this project around the
21 same time I got involved in my first textbook
22 project.
23 on smoking and health in it as a -- as an issue
24 during the progressive era that's the late 19 and --
25 19th Century, early 20th Center.
And my textbook does have some information
So I -- they're
442
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
almost simultaneous.
2 Q. Let's be fair about the textbook.
3 A. Okay.
4 Q. If we were to open it up and look chapter
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
by chapter, is there a chapter on smoking and health?
A.
No.
It's -- it's on major periods in
American history like a whole time period.
Q.
Right.
So it's not specific?
Not even
does it has a chapter that's specific to the issues
of smoking, right?
A.
Well, that -- not the whole chapter.
It
12 would have -- it would have sections of a chapter,
13 but not the whole chapter because it would again be
14 about World War I or something.
15
Q.
Have you even till today, having been
16 involved in this project for ten years, written a
17 scholarly article that you have subjected to peer
18 review on the issues that you've testified about
19 today?
20
21
22
A.
No, I have not done any article on that
subject.
Q.
Have you, other than subjecting your
23 opinion to the courts, subjected the opinions in the
24 methodology by which you reached those opinions to
25 your peers in any way in any publications?
443
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
3
A.
I haven't done any published articles on
this subject.
Q.
Have you ever been asked by -- having done
4 all this work and amassed all of this information and
5 data, have you ever been asked by, say, the surgeon
6 general or any agencies of the surgeon general to
7 consult with them?
8 A. No, nor would I expect that to occur.
9 Q. How about the State of California?
10 they asked you to come in because of your vast
11 knowledge in the area of smoking and health to
12 consult with them on those issues?
13
14
15
16
A.
Have
They have never expressed an interest in
the history of this subject.
Q.
How about the Food and Drug
Administration?
17 A. Same.
18 Q. How about the Federal Trade Commission or
19
the Food and Drug Administration?
20 A. No.
21 Q. How about the Department of Health and
22
They're not historically oriented.
Human Services?
23 A. That would be the same answer.
24 Q. If you had not been recruited by another
25
witness who testifies for the cigarette companies,
444
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 you wouldn't have done all this work on your own,
2 would you?
3 MR. KOETHE:
4 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
I don't think recruited

12 done any of those three projects, had I not
13 been asked if I would do them, two
14 different textbook projects plus this.
15
And I might not have
So, you know, it often happens in
16 life that somebody asks you, you know,
17 would you consider doing this or that, and
18 as a professional historian, that is
19 especially true.

Q.
Let's stick specifically to this and
22 ignore the academic textbooks for a minute.
23 your testimony that absent having been reached out to
24 by another witness who testifies for tobacco
25 companies, you would have spent the thousand plus
Is it
445
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 hours you have spent digging through archives and
2 coming up with all this information on your own?
3
A.
I would have done some research because as
4 I said, I was writing a textbook so there -- you
5 know, that's just integrated into that.
6 certainly would not have done research on Mr. Soffer
7 or this much longer, broader history because it
8 really pertained to a specific project.
9
Q.
But I
Do you think you've come to this courtroom
10 today and given the jury a fair and balanced account
11 of the information that's in the public domain with
12 regard to smoking and health?
13 A. Yes, I do.
14 Q. You wouldn't purposely have not shown the
15 jury any information that's in the public realm that
16 is or speaks poorly of cigarettes or the cigarette
17 companies, would you?
18
A.
I would try to give you what I thought was
19 a representative sampling, so in that sense, that was
20 what I felt was important to show what was the bulk
21 of information the public had, and so no.
22 I've collected the whole gamut of information, some
23 of which is flattering, some of which would be
24 unflattering, et cetera.
25
Q.
I mean,
Tell me which of the articles, news
446
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 stories, magazine stories, television clips you
2 showed that suggest that the tobacco industry was
3 putting out a message contrary to the public health
4 message of smoking and health.
5
A.
Well, for example, I mentioned the
6 textbook.
7 textbooks would say, be wary of advertisers and they
8 would sometimes mention tobacco advertising in that
9 same connection, so that's an example.
10
11
Q.
And certainly sometimes in textbooks, the
I don't think we're communicating.
I've asked a bad question.
12
Maybe
I'm sorry.
You've got all this information on this
13 side of the fence that says smoking's bad, smoking's
14 bad, smoking's bad, the link's clear, the link's
15 clear, the link's clear, everybody knows it everybody
16 knows it, everybody knows it.
17 A. Right.
18 Q. Right?
19 A. Right.
20 Q. I heard a lot of that, okay?
Point to me
21 one thing you shoed this jury, because they've
22 already seen a bunch of it, I promise you, that
23 suggests that the tobacco industry was attempting to
24 diffuse that message.

THE WITNESS:
What I could show you
2 and what I've already testified to is that
3 there was a small percentage, for example,
4 of newspaper articles.
5 roughly one to two percent that from which
6 the industry's position would have been
7 mentioned first.
8 95 percent in cases that I've found, after
9 very careful and very thorough study, were

But in most cases,
10 just the opposite.
11 you a representative sample, and it makes
12 sense to me.
13 but there was that additional percentage,
14 but the bulk of the evidence is very
15 heavily weighted.

17 not because of anything I've picked.

Q.
With all due respect, ma'am, my question
21 was very simple, and it was tell me what you showed
22 us that is representative of the other side of the
23 story.
24 A.

You mean representative of that one or
I think there probably in some of the

(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 articles and certainly, as I mentioned I think in one
2 of textbooks I just also mentioned, there would be

4 other side implies that they're like equal in weight

So I've pointed to some, I do believe,
10 and -- but I also try to show a representative
11 picture.
12 Q. Tell me which one, please.
13 A. The school book I think I mentioned to
14 you.
15 those articles.
16 pick out specific ones.
17 their titles.

And honestly, we'd have to go back through all
Q.
That would be the best way to -- to
I can't remember all of
But just to sum up, because the jury's
19 already seen plenty of it, just to sum up, you
20 believe you came in here and gave a fair and balanced
21 account of what I will call the debate about smoking
22 and health?
23
24
25
A.
Yes, I do believe I've given a very fair,
very balanced account.
Q.
I note that with some interest you
449
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 neglected the tell the jury during your direct
2 examination that during your lifetime, three of your
3 siblings have smoked and two of them are current
4 smokers.
That's correct, isn't it?
5 A. Yes, that's true.
6 Q. One of your sisters started smoking at age
7

10
11
40, did she not?
A.
Yes, she did, or I'm not sure if it's 40
but in there.
Q.
Two of your sisters smoked for 30 years
and one continues to smoke, correct?
12 A. Yes, that's trued.
13 Q. A 30 plus year smoker.
14 A. Yes, that's true.
15 Q. Did your sisters grow up in a loving
16 family? 17 A.
Oh, they grew up in a family, a difficult
18 one, but they -- yes, they both -- they -- two of
19 them started smoking as teenagers.
20
21
22
Q.
One of them as early as age 16, I believe
you told me in deposition, correct?
A.
Yeah, I think that that would be a
23 reasonable approximation, although I don't know the
24 specific year, as I mentioned to you then.
25
Q.
Do they have children, the smokers?

A.
Well, the one who started smoking so late
2 lost her son tragically and started smoking for that
3 reason, I think.
4
Q.
That's what she said.
You neglected to tell me that when I asked
5 you if you'd ever asked her why she started smoking
6 in your deposition.

MR. KOETHE:
Object to form.
BY MR. WARRINER:
9 Q. Is there a reason for that?
10 A. I belive if you'd check the deposition,
11 you didn't ask me about that sister.
12 focused on the sisters who started at 16.
13 that's what I recall your asking me.
14
Q.
You were
At least
You don't remember me asking you a very
15 extensive series of question about whether you
16 because of all of your work in smoking and health had
17 had a discussion with each of your smoking sisters as
18 to why they started smoking?
19
A.
Mr. Warriner, we could look at those
20 questions and I can tell you I'll be happy to --
21 would have been happy to tell you this information,
22 but it just didn't -- wasn't asked of me, as I recall
23 in that form.
24
25
MR. WARRINER:
Why don't we go off
the record for a moment so we can get a
451
(212) 279-9424

I think it's
10 improper.
11 And I've allowed it to go on and will allow
12 it a little bit longer, but I don't think
13 we ought to be going into depth in her
14 family and why her siblings started
15 smoking.

It's bordering on harassment.
I think we're trying to get off
MR. WARRINER:
I don't think I've
asked a question about anybody dying.
MR. KOETHE:
This is what this whole
20 thing is about that she didn't tell you
21 that her sister started smoking because of
22 a tragic death in her family, and that's
23 what you're following up on.
24 it's getting into dangerous territory.

A.
Yes.
It started on page ten where you
2 asked me about my youngest sister and my oldest
3 sister and when they began smoking in 1980, so those
4 were the sisters that we were talking about at that
5 time.

Considering the fact
14 now you've been involved as a paid witness in
15 cigarette litigation for approximately ten years,
16 during that period of time, have you ever gone back
17 in any discussions with your sisters and asked them
18 why it was they started smoking in 1980.
19 an objection.
20 with them why they started smoking or at least not
21 with -- not with my oldest or my youngest sister.
There was
Then you said, I've never discussed it
22 A. Right.

Do you see that answer?
A.
Yeah.
I can't recall how I knew that.
20 Just left out a word, and I think it was my mother
21 who told me that.
22
Q.
Is there anywhere in that question or that
23 answer that you see that you told me that your sister
24 started smoking because she had a loss in her family?
25
A.
You know, to be honest, if you reread out
455
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 loud the preceding page and all of those pages, I
2 honestly did not think you were asking me that
3 question.
4 she -- and she starting smoking.
5 she started smoking two years ago, and I said yes.
6 And you said, she started smoking in 2007 or 2008,

9 started smoking.

You said, tell me about the discussion and

And you said, tell
And I didn't have a conversation
with her initially.
11
I mean, it was really my mother who said,
12 you know, gosh, did you know that Lori was smoking.
13 And at the time she said to me, gosh, that is really
14 terrible sounding, but she -- you know, she said --
15 this was before my -- I'm sorry, it's just is a
16 really difficult subject.

3 Q. And I believe you told me in the
4 deposition that I took from you that she has tried to
5 quit several times but has relapsed.
6

A.
Yes.
She's tried to quit at least twice
that I'm recalling.

9 A. Yes, she does.

11 A. No, he quit.

15 she was 16, smoking for over 30 years about whether
16 or not she feels she is addicted to nicotine and
17 cigarettes?

A.
You know, we just -- we don't talk about
19 it in quite those ways, those terms.

21 discussed it with her a few times, several times.

Why she doesn't quit is

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 not -- is it in fact she agreed that it's a matter of
2 making a decision and deciding you want to quit.
3 I think that that's very much, by the way, related to
4 the topic of my research, which is Mr. Soffer, who
5 similarly said at some point, I want to quit,
6 regardless what everybody's telling me to do.
7 often don't like to be told what to do.

With due respect, Dr. Hoffman, that
14 question didn't call for any discussion about the
15 Soffer family.
16 specifically, have you had a discussion with your
17 sister about whether or not the reason she cannot
18 quit smoking is because she is addicted to nicotine
19 in cigarettes?
My question to you is very

Maury Soffer was born in 1935.
Who was
President in 1935?
12 A. Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
13 Q. Who's this fellow that we're showing the
14
15
16
17
jury?
A.
On the board over here in front of me is
the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Q.
And at the time from 1935 and for the
18 ensuing very many years, was President Roosevelt the
19 most important and prominent authority figure in the
20 United States of America?
21
A.
Those were war years and depression years,
22 so I'd say yes.
23 time, yes.
24
25
Q.
Maybe not normally, but at that
And because of the culture at the time, it
was not infrequent to see and for President Roosevelt

www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
to be photographed smoking cigarettes, correct?
2 A. He smoked.
3 Q. And during the Second World War, during
4 which President Roosevelt continued to be our
5 president -- this is a cover from Life Magazine.
6 you recognize that picture?
7

9
Do
A. I don't recognize that particular picture,
Q. That's one of the more famous pictures
no.
10 from World War II along with the lifting the Iwo Jima

17 photograph.

There are several that are very
19 Q. Both --
20 A. -- I should say.
21 Q. I'm sorry.
Both during World War I and
22 II, cigarettes were given to our military people
23 free, correct?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. And there was a famous quote from General
They were in combat rations.
461
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Pershing from the First World War that said, give me
2 cigarettes more than bullets, if I want to win this
3 war.
4
You remember that quote?
A.
Oh, I don't remember that particular
5 quote, but that's been a refrain in the armed forces
6 over the years.
7
Q.
And how many men served in the military
8 who were given free cigarettes during the First World
9 War?
10
A.
I don't know how many would have gotten
11 combat rations, and to be completely honest, I'm not
12 entirely sure that they were issued with -- in combat
13 rations in World War I.
I know they were given free
14 and they were provided.
I'm not sure they were in
15 the, you know, the kits that by World War II that the
16 soldiers were getting.
So, you know, more than a
17 million people served.
Not all of them would have
18 been in combat, but a lot, quite a few.
19
20
Q.
And then similarly in World War II, how
many people served --
21 A. I think --
22 Q. -- in all theaters?
23 A. Approximately 12 million Americans served
24
25
in World War II.
Q.
And --
462
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Not all in combat, of course.
2 Q. Have you ever heard it said that because
3 of the prominence of cigarette smoking during the
4 Second World War by our military that an entire
5 generation of our young men came out of that war
6 addicted to cigarettes?
7
A.
I don't think I've heard it formulated in
8 the way that you are.
9 and more popular.
Certainly smoking became more
World War I was part of
10 popularizing and then it also -- it remained popular
11 throughout World War II.
12
Q.
Well, I think you told me a second ago
13 that by the time 1950 rolled around around the Second
14 World War, 48 percent or almost half of all Americans
15 smoked cigarettes, correct?
16 A. I think I said 45 percent in 1954.
17 Q. And would you not agree with me that if
18 you go back and look at the culture of smoking in the
19 '40s and '50s, it was quite glamorous?
20
A.
Oh, I don't know that it was quite
21 glamorous.
22 circumstances, so I know some kids thought it was a
23 cool thing to do.
24 Mr. Soffer thought it was cool.
25 it was glamorous.
Lots of people smoked under all kinds of
Our -- it's been reported that
So I don't know that
463
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

(212) 490-34301
Q.
And if Mr. Soffer was born in 1935, his
2 younger years between, say, 1935 and the end of the
3 Second World War, he would have been from, you know,
4 toddler age up to about an 11-year-old, right?
5 A. That's approximately right.
6 Q. And, you know, if you'd have gone to the
7
movies, have you ever seen Now Voyager?
8 A. Now Voyager?
9 Q. Now Voyager.
10 A. No, I don't recall that movie.
11 Q. If you talk to people from that
12 generation, you've never heard anything talk at the
13 final scene from Now Voyager?
14
15
A.
You know, that's really before my time.
No, I just don't -- I don't know that scene.
16 Q. Do you recognize --
17 A. I've not had anyone from that generation
18 tell me about it, which is what your specific
19 question was, of course.
20 Q. Do you recognize this actress?
21 A. Yeah.
22 Q. Right.
That looks like Bette Davis to me.
I'm going to play this for you and
23 see if it refreshes your recollection and see if

you ever seen that scene from that movie?

5 Q. Would you agree with me that at the time,
6
7
Bette Davis was a very, very prominent actress?
A.
I honestly -- I don't know what year it
8 would be she became very prominent, but I'm not sure
9 if that was the height of her prominence or not.
10 Q. How about Frank Sinatra?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Was Frank Sinatra popular?
13 A. Yes, he was.

She was
very, very popular as well, correct?

4 people doing both things.
5
Q.
So yes, you saw on television and in films
And it was not infrequent during the day
6 that this was shown for all of TV to be very, very
7 heavily involved in the advertisement of cigarettes
8 as well, correct?
9
A.
There were cigarette advertisements.
I
10 don't -- you know, there were advertisements for a
11 lot of things too, so yes, they were involved in it.
12 I would have difficulty quantifying it.
13

21 Q. He also was a famous actor, correct?
22 A. Yes.
He was very well known, not on the
23 scale, of course, as some of these others we're seen,
24 but very well known television actor.

7
Go ahead, please.
BY MR. WARRINER:
Q.
And do you remember -- I know that was
8 probably a little before your TV time, but do you
9 remember because of your study of history -- the
10 history of American culture and the study of tobacco
11 in American culture, do you remember it was not
12 infrequent at all for these TV shows to have
13 commercials like that to be the sponsored by
14 cigarettes, cigarette manufacturers, correct?
15
A.
There were definitely cigarette ads on
16 television and on radio up until 1971 when they were
17 all, of course, removed.
18
Q.
Now, Mr. Soffer was growing up during the
19 era that we saw those two clips like that.

12 there would be more cigarette ads.

13 wouldn't include Lucky Strikes, Phillip -- Herbert
14 Tareyton, the other brands that were made by American
15 at that time.
This
16 A. Okay.
17 Q. This is the advertising budget that runs
18 from 1936 through 1956, and that would be from the
19 time that Mr. Soffer is one year old until Mr. Soffer
20 is 21 years old, correct?

I'm pretty good on

At the bottom left-hand of that page is
17 the total, and I believe it's probably even easier to

Do you see that?

22 A. I'm sorry.
Mine looks different from yours.
I'm trying to see this.
I see

11 Q. Can we agree to that?
12 A. Well, I agree that's what it says.
13 Q. I know you're not is a math major, you're
14 a history person, but I had our accountant at our
15 business run a present value of that stream of

10 pervasive and far reaching Pall Mall's advertising
11 was on behalf of American Tobacco?

10
Q.
Dr. Hoffman, before we had to change
11 videotapes, I was asking you questions about the Pall
12 Mall famous cigarette advertising budget.
13 on your last answer, can I assume that you cannot
14 tell the jury how much Pall Mall advertising
15 Mr. Soffer was exposed to between the ages of one and
16 20.
17
A.
And based
No, I can't tell you how much advertising
18 he would have been exposed to a lot compared to other
19 things, but yes, he would have been exposed to it,
20 but I don't know the exact amount.
21
Q.
And likewise, you can't tell the jury what
22 Pall Mall's message was, what their advertising theme
23 was?
24
25

Oh, I'm not sure that they had an overall
theme, particular theme or message.

8 clear that it was your opinion that throughout the
9 1950s, even that early the messages with regard to
I think earlier you made it
10 smoking and health were pervasive and Mr. Soffer, as
11 well as others, would have been exposed to them,
12 right?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. And I believe that you told us that I
15 think an estimate was there were about between 50 and
16 60 million people smoking in 1954, was it?
17 the year you picked?
18
A.
I talked about the percentage of smokers.
19 I didn't give a numerical figure.

Anyway, the message was
12 pervasive throughout the '50s, and according to your
13 testimony, people should have gotten the message,
14 correct?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Do you know how -- well, strike that.
17
It seems to me that it would follow that
18 if this message was as strong and pervasive as you
19 say it is, the cigarette companies would have
20 struggled.
21
A.
I don't know that they would have.
This
22 was a strong, pervasive message, and people started

9 April 1958.

Almost the same percentage of
However, in March 1957, two-thirds of

fairly short period of time, but, yeah.
Q.
Despite that fact would you agree with me
15 that this study commissioned by the cigarette
16 industry for the cigarette industry found in 1959
17 that still despite this message that was going on,

19 surveyed were active smokers?

Q.
Well, in 1957 then, if -- to the corollary
12 of what you just said, in 1957, despite all the years
13 of smoking and health-related news that had been
14 pouring out even in the early '50s, in '57,
15 two-thirds of the doctors in this country smoked
16 cigarettes.

that two-thirds were.

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
smoked smoking.
Q.
All right.
And the corollary is well to
3 what you said a second ago is despite all this
4 information in 1959, according to this survey, more
5 than half of the doctors in this country remained
6 smokers.
7
A.
Right, and -- you're right.
They were
8 still -- so it had gone from two-thirds down to half,
9 and in 19 -- that's where it was in 1959, and it was
10 still falling and fell considerably more very soon
11 afterwards.
12
Q.
So if we take a look back at what we've
13 just looked at, if we look at the decade of the '50s,
14 despite the information that came out, you would
15 agree, because you just saw it, that the cigarette

And at the end of the decade, more than
24 half, according to that survey, more than of the
25 teenagers in the country were smokers?

Yeah.
They were

5 Q. And more that -- excuse me.
6 A. Sorry.
7 Q. More than half of the doctors in this
8
9
country were smokers as well?
A.
Yes.
And they were quitting too in
10 gigantic numbers.
11 what you showed to me tells me how fast that behavior
12 changed, which for an historian is a very significant
13 thing.
14 that ship -- that big ship was shifting and going --
15 starting to go in a new direction, but it -- you
16 know, it didn't happen instantaneously.
And I mean, I guess to me that
No human activity turns on a dime exactly, so
17 Q. Well, actually --
18 A. I wouldn't expect it to.
19 Q. Well, actually it's not -- that's not
20 true.
21 parse it out, in one year they went from two-thirds
22 to 50 percent, but in the last two years of the
23 survey, it remained steady, correct?

If you look at that report and you really

You know, could you show it to me again?
I -- you're restating it, and I'm not exactly sure.
486
(212) 279-9424

(212) 490-34301 I know it was coming down incrementally.
2 that -- you know, it kind of jig -- zigzags a little
3 bit, but let's look at it.

MR. KOETHE:
Cal, is this one that
5 you have a copy of?
6 document.
7
Maybe
THE WITNESS:
It looks like a large
Yeah, it would sure --
8 it would be helpful to see the larger
9 document because there might be other thing
10 in it -- other information that would
11 interpret this in the same light I am.
12
MR. KOETHE:
This goes to my earlier
13 objection.
14 witness, it's really not fair to question
15 her about it and to tell she's saying
16 something untrue, when you haven't given
17 her the document.
18
If we don't have a copy for the
MR. WARRINER:
The rest of the
19 document has nothing to do with the
20 interpretation of this paragraph.
21 THE WITNESS:
22 MR. KOETHE:

25
Well, I --
The witness and I
disagree with that.

Yeah.
I have to be the
judge of that myself.

Q.
All right.
Well, let's -- let's just look
3 at this one more time, and I don't want to spend too
4 much time on it.
5
6
Slightly more than half of physicians were
smokers in August of 1959.
7 A. Uh-huh.
8 Q. Almost the same percentage of physicians
9
indicated that they were smokers in April of 1958.
10 A. Uh-huh.
11 Q. So for a year and five months, there was
12
13
no change, correct?
A.
Yes.
Now, keep in mind that in 1957 was
14 when that second big Hammond and Horn study came out,
15 so it did tend to, you know, lurch.
16 were times it would sort of stay steady state, and
17 then some other big report would come out and more
18 people would quit.
19 a little lull, I mean, based on the study, which I
20 haven't seen, that says what it says.
21
Q.
I mean, there
But you're right, that looks like
Well, if you really study the numbers
22 carefully, which the jury's already been presented
23 with in the plaintiff's case in this thing, when some
24 of the early what's termed the cancer scare came out
25 in the early '50s, cigarette consumption dropped, did
488
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 it not? 2 A. I think it dropped momentarily.
3 Q. Right.
And then it started going right
4 back up with the introduction of filtered cigarettes,
5 correct?
6
A.
I don't know that that coincided with the
7 introduction of filtered cigarettes because they had
8 been in production for a quite a while.
9 this is -- these kind of graphs look like this in
10 terms of smoking.
11 overall trend is down.
12 bounced up again, yes.
13
14
Q.
But yeah,
It goes up, it goes down.
All right.
The
Were there moments where it
Well, let's go back to my
question.
15 A. Uh-huh.
16 Q. Following the cancer scare of the early
17
'50s in 54, cigarette consumption dropped, correct?
18 A. Yes, it dropped initially briefly.
19 Q. Then it came right back, correct?
20 A. I'm not sure if it came right back, but,
21
22
yeah, it did tend to bounce back up a bit.
Q.
Well, by 1957 at least American Tobacco
23 Company and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company are
24 enjoying record profits?
25 correct?
I think that's their words,

(212) 490-34301
A.
I'm not sure if it's record, but, yeah,
2 they're enjoying a greater profits.
3 in the summary that you're just showing me, in other
4 ways, that consumption is really declining.
5 for -- to -- for physicians to go from two-thirds, 66
6 percent, down to 50 percent in the course of a little
7 more than two years is, you know, is also
8 significant.
9 Q.
Anyway, going back to this, just to --
10 A.
Uh-huh.
11 Q.
-- sum this up --
12 A.
Okay.
13 Q.
-- if you read at least this paragraph
But as you see
From --
14 honestly from 1957 March through April 1958, there
15 was a drop from two-thirds to one-half
16 approximately -- slightly more than one half of
17 doctors smoking cigarettes, correct?
18 MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
19 THE WITNESS: Well, you said an
20 honest reading of it.
21 honest reading of it, and hones -- and I
22 think an even more honest reading would be
23 to have the whole document so I could see
24 what the context is for these statements.

What spurred you to read The Cigarette

Well, it was on the subject I've been

11 to find out is what other historians have said about
12 what people knew about the hazards of smoking.
13
And so one of the things I wanted
In that particular book, by the way, one
14 of the things that really struck me when I first read
15 it was that the author starts out by saying -- it
16 might be the first paragraph or the first -- it's the
17 introduction anyway, perhaps the first chapter.
18 he says, I was in Times Square and I saw a tobacco
19 advertisement when I was six years old and I thought
20 how dare they because it's so bad for you.
21 it'll kill you.
22 sentiment.
23
And
You know,
I'm paraphrasing, but that was his
And then the rest of the book is about
24 how -- how this information was squelched by the
25 tobacco industry.
And I actually thought that those
495
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 two parts of the book didn't go together very well

3 even as a young child, this information had gotten
4 through to him.
5 Allan Brandt.
6 it into account in my findings.
So I mean, that's what I know about
I simply have read his book and took
7 Q. Two questions about that.
8 A. Uh-huh.
9 Q. Do you find Dr. Brandt's recitation of a
10 hundred-year history of the cigarette manufacturers
11 to be disingenuous?
12
A.
Oh, I don't think I could use the word
13 "disingenuous."
14 at the end of the book, he describes himself as an
15 activist almost, somebody who, you know, is a kind of
16 crusader on this topic and feels very passionately
17 about it.
18 I think he -- he came across to me as very sincere.
19
Q.
I think he's very sincere.
In fact,
So to me disingenuous means unsincere, and
Because you read the book, you're familiar
20 with the fact and you know about the activities of
21 the cigarette industry in the early '50s where they
22 got together and had a meeting at the Plaza Hotel and
23 formed the Tobacco History Research Council.
24 aware of that, right?

16 called Creating Controversy that deals with the
17 issues of the formation of the Tobacco Industry
18 Research Council.
19 generally speaking, what's the gestalt of that
20 chapter and why was the TIRC formed?
I'm talking generally
There's an entire chapter in the book
It's like 60 pages long.
21 MR. KOETHE:
22 THE WITNESS:
Just
Object to the form.
I would summarize his
23 work because I thought you were asking
24 about what was the stated purpose at a
25 specific meeting, he alleges that the
497
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 attempt was to create a controversy.
2 know, he -- at the same time in other parts
3 of his book, he acknowledges that there was
4 a scientific controversy, so he's kind of
5 saying two things there.
6 that the general intent of the industry was
7 to suppress information that somehow didn't
8 get out even though he knew this
9 information, you know, when he was six.
10
11
You
But he is saying
BY MR. WARRINER:
Q.
Do you remember in that chapter the
12 formation of the TIRC being for the purpose of
13 creating a controversy with regard to the smoking and
14 health issue?
15 A. That is what Mr. Brandt alleges, yes.
16 Q. And if you read the book, you also have
17 seen in the book excerpts from documents which would
18 be primary sources, correct?
19
A.
The documents would be; but this isn't the
20 collection of documents, and so therefore, it is a
21 true secondary source in that he's read documents and
22 chosen what he thinks are the important things for us
23 to see and, you know, so the reader gets to only see
24 what he's chosen for us, so we don't see the universe
25 of documents.

You know, I don't recall that it was a

18 vary quite considerably on how much they footnote.
19 If you hand me the book, I'll be delighted to comment
20 more on it, but at the time, it struck me as, you
21 know, a very, very thick, heavy book, you know, which
22 would include a lot of documentation.
23
Q.
Right.
I have seen

5 it not?
6 MR. KOETHE:
7 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
Well, first of all, I
8 read this book, and you keep saying if you
9 read it and if you even scanned it.
And I
10 want to let you know I read it word for
11 word, so to just address that first point
12 you're making.
13
And secondly, that is what he
14 alleges, that the Tobacco Industry Research
15 Council was formed to do.
16 course, people who say something very
17 different, who say that it was formed to do
18 research on the hazards of smoking.
19 that's -- that was also a purpose that has
20 been stated in relation to the TIRC.
21 Brandt alleges something different, very
22 different.

That was a document
10 I have to stack that up against much, much more

So yes, the Frank Statement -- and I

17 we've provided to you showing you that I considered
18 it.
19 was much more important to show you what I think is
20 really the true and accurate and full story, which is
21 that people knew about the hazards and had known
22 about the hazards for many generations.

25
But in the limited time we have, I thought it

7 they would say -- and I saw this in more than one
8 textbook -- when advertisers tell you that their
9 product is less irritating, what they're telling you
You know, there were --
10 is that your -- their product is irritating and kids,
11 watch out and beware and as you read these ads, look
12 for what it means.
13 interpretation.
14 interpretation, but I do think it is a reasonable one
15 that could have been given to people reading it who
16 had said, oh, my, gosh, you know.
So I think that it's a reasonable
I don't think it's the only
17 Q. Now, let's look at --

Sure.
It says, "Distinguished authorities

Q.
Right.
According to your research, was
that a true or false statement?

A.
I think many is probably not -- wouldn't

9 press about the fact that, for example, not everyone
There was -- there

11 didn't get lung cancer, so that did bring about --
12 yes, there were articles on other possible causes of
13 cancer, why it's triggered in some people and not in
14 others.
15 about genetic triggers, other assaults on the
16 respiratory tract like smog.

18 right.

Ninety percent of the people who smoked
And there was some discussion in the press
So those things came
Again, the word "many" doesn't strike me as
Q.
It's technically true, but not totally
forthcoming; would you agree with me?
A.
Oh, I wouldn't characterize it that way.
22 I would just say it's -- it's -- they're stating what
23 is true on the record.
24 thinking was, I'm not sure about that.
25
Q.
How frank it is, what their
Let's look at number two, please.
505
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Okay, sure.
2 Q. What does it say?
3 A. It says that, quote:
That there is no
4 agreement among the authorities regarding what the
5 cause is.
6
7
8
9
Q.
I assume they're talking about cancer;
would that be fair?
A.
Yes.
I think that from context, again,
context being the first point.
10 Q. Do you agree with that statement?
11 A. In 1954 there was preponderance evidence,
12 and it was statistical evidence that smoking caused
13 lung cancer.
14 Hammond initially expressed skepticism.
15 Evarts Graham initially expressed skepticism that the
16 two were related because it was a statistical
17 correlation.
18 lung cancer parallels the rise in cigarette use.
19 he said, but it also parallels the rise in use of
20 silk stockings.
21
Even, by the way, people like Cuyler
And even
Evarts Graham had said that the rise in
And
So what he was just saying is we have to
22 be careful and statistical evidence isn't the same as
23 biological evidence.
24 know, passionately wanted to get down to a better
25 understanding of, and that's why they worked so hard.
But they passionately, you

(212) 490-34301
So in 1954 in January, which is when this
2 was published, this was six months before the release
3 of the, you know, the final full Hammond and Horn
4 report, so at that time they -- they were
5 expressing the on -- they were saying there's --
6 there's a good possibility.
7 finally, conclusive, yes, we're sure.
8 important message kids were hearing, had been hearing
9 that there was a link to cancer.
They hadn't yet said
So it was an
You know, they
10 weren't sure if it was definite, but they knew they'd
11 been warned.
12 Q.
Do you agree or disagree with the
13 statement that there is no agreement -- excuse me,
14 you have to put the preface in here.
15 authorities point out that there is no agreement
16 among the authorities regarding what the cause --
17 I'll insert this -- of cancer is?
18
A.
Distinguished
You know, I don't want to parse their
19 sentences totally, but I would say again, it's like
20 the word "many," and I think that there was limited
21 agreement about the authorities at that time.
22 American Medical Association, for example, wasn't
23 ready to come on board yet that smoking was the cause
24 of cancer, that they were a little bit later on that.
25 So, you know, there wasn't complete agreement amongst
The
507
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 authorities, but some authorities definitely agreed
2 with that and agreed with one another that it was the
3 cause of lung cancer.
4
5
6
Q.
Was the lack of agreement among
authorities, was that also published to the public?
A.
Well, yes, it would have been reported in
7 the newspaper.
8 Reader's Digest article earlier on that said how
9 harmful is smoking.
You know, for example, I showed a
So there was a question, and
10 they kept trying to answer it and get better and
11 better answers about it, and they knew it was
12 harmful.
13 the -- lung cancer wasn't the only harm associated
14 with cigarettes.
15 now call emphysema, those were things that were also
16 associated with it.
17
And, of course, keep in mind, by the way,
Chronic bronchitis, we -- which we
So when kids were told, you know, it's bad
18 for you, bad for you, bad for you, they were told,
19 you know, a lot of reasons why it was bad for you.
20 think in January 1954, as best I read it from the
21 articles I read, you know, that wouldn't have been
22 that crazy a statement to make.
23
Q.

Q.
My question is is it a reasonable
15 statement, not whether people believed in or nor or
16 it affected people's beliefs, so I'll ask it again
17 respectfully.
18 A. Uh-huh.
19 Q. The quote is:
We believe the products we
20 make are not injurious to health.
21 study of the available evidence that was out there at
22 the time, is that a responsible statement for the
23 manufacturer of a product to make?

16 was injurious.

That's what the majority of people

19 A. Apparently not everybody thought that.

21 A. Oh, no, I'm sorry.

23 A. No.
Did I say that?
I said -- no, it doesn't seem a

7 companies -- I'm sorry, there's one other -- there's

There's a statement here:
"We accept an
12 interest in people's health as a basic responsibility
13 paramount to every other consideration in our
14 business."

are -- generally make the advertiser look good.
Q.
Do you consider the Frank Statement to
cigarette smokers to be an ad?
A.
Yes, it was an ad.
I -- yeah, it was a
paid advertisement.

You don't --

4 customers?

It was an
7 advertisement.
8 advertisements by other advertisers about
9 products, so, you know, Frank's statement
10 on toilet paper and things like that that
11 you and I have discussed previously.
12 Advertisers would take out what today we'd
13 probably call infomercials, and they

15 know, they try to make themselves look
16 good.

Q.
The fact that the title of it says A Frank
2 Statement to Smokers, there's two things we can draw
3 from that.
4 are implying they're being honest, are they not?
By saying it's a Frank Statement, they
5 MR. KOETHE: Object to form.
6 THE WITNESS: I don't know.
I also
7 remember the Frank Statement on baldness.
8 This was a fairly common advertising
9 device.
Again, if we were in that period
10 of time, saw this in context, we would see
11 this as something that advertisers did.
12 This would -- would be one.
13 and in fact at the bottom -- if you
14 could -- I think this you could make that
15 bigger, it lists the companies, I think.
16
And I believe
And so again, I believe that the
17 public would have seen it as that.
18 also keep in mind too, those articles spoke
19 about it as an ad by the industry.

Q.
I'll ask my question again.
With due
2 respect, ma'am, my question is very simple, and it is
3 by including the word "frank" in the bold title of
4 this, are they not suggesting that this is an honest
5 statement?
6
7
MR. KOETHE:
Asked and answered.
8
9
Object to the form.
THE WITNESS:
The word "frank," if we
were to define it, means candid, you know,
10 forthright, honest, probably all of those
11 kinds of things, in other words, let's
12 talk -- let's to each other openly, you
13 know, that kind of thing.
14 that was a statement that was used
15 repeatedly in advertisements in the 1950s
16 and the 1960s.
17 your question.
18
19
And as I said,
Did I -- I hope I answered
BY MR. WARRINER:
Q.
And the second part of the title is:
It's
20 a Frank Statement not to the public, it's a Frank
21 Statement to smokers, correct?
22 A. Correct.
23 Q. Can it be concluded that the tobacco
24 industry by joining together was attempting to make a
25 frank or honest, or whatever adjective you want to
515
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
use, statement to smokers?
2
A.
I think it was along the lines of saying
3 this is what we're up to in that kind of informal
4 way.
5 almost informally.
6 other things they listed was, you know, we're giving
7 money to this and this is what we're doing.
8 were, as you said, directly addressing cigarette
9 smokers, although other people would have read --
10
When you say, let's speak frankly, it means
And they
could have read easily the ad.
11
12
In there, the Frank Statement,
So did I answer your question?
It was an
awfully long question and a little convoluted.
13 Q. I'll make it simpler then.
14 A. Uh-huh.
15 Q. I'll break it down in two parts.
Just the
16 title, A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers, to me
17 that suggests these companies are trying to be honest
18 to their customers.
19 of that title?
20
21
22
A.
Is that a fair characterization
I think that they're saying, we want to
give you the straight poop, we might say.
Q.
And they say in there that respected
23 authorities say that the link between cigarettes and
24 cancer is unproven.
25
A.
They say that, don't they?
Well, that's one of the things they say.
516
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 They also say that there are very serious charges
2 that have been leveled and need to be investigated.
3
4
Q.
Ma'am, that's not my question, ma'am.
I
didn't ask you what else it said in there.
5 A. Oh, well --
6 Q. My question's very simple.
7 A. Okay.
Well, we have talked about that.
8 Yes, they said the sentence.
9 before. 10 Q. Let me ask the question again --
11 A. Sure.
12 Q. -- please, with respect.
You had me look at it
My question is
13 they make the statement in this document that the
14 charges suggesting that cigarettes cause cancer are
15 unproven, correct?
16 A. Right.
17 Q. They also say in there that they believe
18 that their products are not injurious to health,
19 right?
20
21
22
A.
Yes.
That's in that second sentence there
on the board.
Q.
And following the issue of the Frank
23 Statement, there was some press coverage for this at
24 some time down the road, correct?
25
A.
Well, the press coverage I saw was
517
(212) 279-9424

5 the president, the acting then president of the TIRC
6 and also the president of Brown and Williamson
7 Tobacco Company, Timothy Hartnett -- have you ever
8 seen his on national TV representation about what
9 they meant in this statement?
10 A. I may have.

519
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 think that he did believe that at the time he said
2 it.
3
Q.
And he's speaking at this time on behalf
4 of the TIRC, or the Tobacco Industry Research
5 Council, correct?
6
A.
Yes, that's right.
And he was one of
7 those people that felt it was a genetic thing, that
8 it was likely that cancer was triggered by some
9 predisposition.
10
11
Rightly or wrongly, that's what he
said.
Q.
My question, ma'am, is simply at the time
12 he was speaking, was he speaking on behalf of the
13 Tobacco Industry Research Council?
14 A. I thought I said yes, and I do say yes.
15 Q. Yes, ma'am.
And the companies, we saw
16 them a minute ago, all of the major tobacco companies
17 were part of the Tobacco Industry Research Council,
18 correct?
19
A.
I believe they were.
I think all of the
20 American companies were.
21 that wasn't, but I think they were all members.

23
Q.
There might have been one
The defendant in this case, Reynolds, was
a signatory on the agreement, correct?

3 Tobacco was likewise on that agreement, correct?

6
A.
Again, if I could review the signatures,
believe they were.
Q.
And as you sit there today, you don't know
7 whether or not in the possession of the members of
8 the turf there was evidence that there were in fact
9 documented cancer-causing agents in tobacco smoke?

A.
I did not research the records of the
11 Tobacco Industry Research Council, so I don't know

Q.
Do you know, ma'am, as you sit there
6 today, whether or not cancer-causing substances were
7 identified in tobacco smoke in the -- say in the
8 '50s?
9
A.
Well, you remember -- and this is from See
10 It Now, which was a two-hour program, and the tobacco
11 industry responses were a small, very small part of
12 that program, but yes, you recall the beaker that
13 Ernst Wynder held.
14 of the scientific and most of the medical community
15 thought were cancer causing.

Q.
Those were substances which much
So that had been done, it's your testimony
17 before Dr. Little got on national TV as a
18 representative of the Tobacco Research Council and
19 said that no cancer-causing agents had ever been
20 found in cigarette smoke, none whatever?
21
A.
Again, please don't ask me to speak to the
22 science of it, but what he was arguing and I think

That's as best as I can do for you.

A.
Yes, that's -- that's precisely what it
just said.
Q.
I don't think he's -- he doesn't sound
4 like he's much in accord with your thesis that there
5 was a consensus among the medical community by 1955
6 that cigarette smoking was causative of lung cancer,
7 do you?
8 MR. KOETHE:
9 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
I think that you might
10 be mischaracterizing what I said.
11 I think I said several times that there was
12 discussion, especially at this level at the
13 level of physicians talking, you know,
14 about the findings, and you would have some
15 physicians who -- and it seems odd to us
16 today, so we just have to -- again, we have
17 to put ourselves back in context.
18
In fact,
And this was a context in which up to
19 this point, all the major medical
20 discoveries had been made on the basis of
21 biological experiments.
22 you find a germ.
23 It causes a disease.
24 one-to-one correspondence, and then you
25 find the things that cures that disease.
In other words,
It's in the test tube.
It's almost a
525

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 And that was all wrapped around a late 19th

10 Association, as you see, it wasn't just the
11 TIRC was saying I don't believe it.
12 course, that's very different, again,
13 that's quite different from my thesis,
14 which is that despite this conversation
15 that was ongoing, that the public in -- for
16 example, in elementary schools, you saw
17 those textbooks.
18 and by the way, you know, so-and-so says
19 that's not true.
20
But of
They weren't saying, oh,
They did acknowledge that it wasn't
21 conclusive yet, but that there were strong
22 reasons to believe and there were
23 statistics.
24 this particular person felt that statistics
25 were not as good as biological evidence.
And a medical authority like

Q.
So I'm trying to understand putting your
testimony in direct in context of the president of
10 the American Medical Association saying that there's
11 no link between smoking and cancer.
12 telling this jury that say Mr. Soffer who in '55 was
13 20 years old should have known more about cigarette
14 smoking and cancer causation than the incoming
15 president of the American Medical Association?
16
A.
And are you
Are you saying I -- that he should have
17 known more about medicine than the AMA?
18 course not.

20 A. Okay.
21
22
No, of
Well, I'm -- maybe you can just
simplify your question for me.
Q.
So are you saying then that that
23 Mr. Soffer at 20 should have accepted because of what
24 he had been exposed, to the link between smoking and
25 cancer while the president, incoming president of the

In

4 with is.
5 that some of the medical authorities like this fellow
6 were saying it's not conclusive.
7 what is, students and 20-year-olds like Mr. Soffer at
8 that time were being warned that regardless of
9 whether or not it's conclusive, this is a danger, a
10 potential danger and if you care about your health,
11 you won't take that risk.

We try to deal

He's not a tobacco

5
A.
No.
That's when the TIRC said there was
6 not -- people are not a whole lot in agreement,
7 here's the evidence of that.
8
9
Q.
So we've got a government scientist.
We've got the chest physicians.
We've got the
10 incoming president of the AMA all within a two-year
11 period of time saying that cigarettes are not
12 implicated in lung cancer, right?
13
14
A.
Yeah.
There is a debate that's ongoing in
this period of time.
15 Q. It's controversy, isn't it?
16 A. Well, at the highest levels it is, and
17 it's reported, of course, in newspapers like the
18 New York Times.

By the way, of course,
17 again, this is outside the area that Mr. Soffer was
18 living in at that time, and I did focus my research
19 on him, where he was.
20 Q. Well, let me ask you this question.
21 A. Sure.
22 Q. Do you think people at the New York Times
23 in New York City were writing stuff different than
24 they were in Los Angeles?
25 science going on in Los Angeles than they had going

on in New York?
A.
No, no, of course not, but not every
3 newspaper has as much stuff in it.
4 Times is famous for having much better coverage of
5 many, many, many issues than a lot of other
6 newspapers.
7 way, you said was a -- was a New York doctor talking
8 to a New York audience.
9 backwards, I could tell you it was some -- I think
The New York
Also that particular article, by the
I think if you took it
10 one, what they called the Finger Lakes in New York,
11 so it looked to me a bit like a local story.
12 know, the science is the same.
13
14
15
Q.
You
There were no doctors that diet -- that
doubted the science and cancer link in Los Angeles?
A.
In Los Angeles there was again, because in
16 Los Angeles smog has been such an issue and was a
17 really big issue in the 1950s and '60s.
18 some scientists who were concerned that smog was the
19 primary causative agent.
20 talking about it.
21 they were -- I think even in that process, they were
22 alerting people who were prudent about their health
23 that they're a way to found out because it was scary.
There were
But again, they were
They were raising the issue and
24 Q. Next.
25 A. Okay, yeah.
I don't see a date on this one.
Could we see the date on

Okay.
Q.
So again, New York Times, 1957.

15 that's another indication they're not
16 giving as much coverage to this as the

Q.
It didn't seem

10 issue a report, actually did issue a report and
11 worked on it for how long, about two years?

A.
The sort of thing they were saying.
It's,
you know, a long document, many statements but.
3
Q.
Right.
Do you know whether the
4 United States Surgeon General reached out to the
5 tobacco companies while they were doing their
6 research that formed the basis of the '64 report and
7 asked them to give them all of the information they
8 had that was pertinent to the issue of constituents
9 in tobacco smoke, the biological effects of tobacco

smoke and the effectiveness of filters?

22 A. In some -- am I aware that they reached
23 out?

I

(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 reached out in the selection of committee members.
2 But to ask them for their -- specifically for all
3 their research, I don't recall that.
4
Q.
Right.
That's -- that's all bottling
5 stuff and a lot of language, so let me -- let me at
6 the -- on the chance that my question was inartfully
7 phrased and confused you, let me ask it again.
8
Are you aware of whether or not, once
9 established, the surgeon general's select committee
10 reached out to the tobacco companies and asked them
11 to provide to the surgeon general information they
12 had with regard to the constituents of tobacco smoke,
13 the biological effects of tobacco, and the
14 effectiveness of filters?
15
16
17
A.
I don't recall a specific letter asking
that.
Q.
Would you likewise then be unfamiliar with
18 whether or not the tobacco companies cooperated fully
19 with the federal government as they had promised they
20 could do in the Frank Statement?
21 MR. KOETHE:
22 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I can't comment on that
23 because again, it's something that would

Q.
When the '64 surgeon general's report was
6 issued, you would agree with me that was sort of
7 another -- a second watershed moment for the issue of
8 cigarette smoking and the causation of disease first
9 being back in the early '50s with the succession of
10 reports that came out linking smoking to cancer?
11 That was the first sort of the first watershed
12 moment, correct?
13
A.
I think it was a watershed moment.
I
14 think Dr. Raymond Pearl's findings were also
15 watershed moments.
16 was certainly a very important moment in 1954 and
17 then again 1964.
18
Q.
There were some others, but that
Right, '64.
And I'm sure that you made an
19 attempt to be fair in what you showed the jury about
20 the industry's response to 1964, but I'm curious to
21 know why you didn't show them the president of a
22 major tobacco company on national TV when Harry
23 Reasoner did his special.
24 Howard Coleman talking to the nation about the
25 surgeon general's report?

I think what I -- I'm sorry, are
5 Q. Yes.
6 A. Oh, okay.
Well, all right.
Harry
7 Reasoner interviewed a number of people about it.
8 felt that the overwhelming message they came across
9 and you even saw that concluding statement that
I
10 Reasoner said. 11 tell you it's good for you. 12 whether it's bad for you or something like that. 13 I felt that that covered the idea that there were
14 different stigmas that were being made but that the
15 overall pitch, the overall intent of Mr. Reasoner's
16 talk was to educate people to the charges, to let
17 them know three, you know, had been some controversy
18 about the charges, he indicates that in his final
19 statement, but you should be very careful. 20 America, no one's going to tell you what to do. So I
21 felt that it was fair, my representation of it. I
22 didn't select that because I felt that the point was
23 covered by Mr. Reasoner and we are limited in time.

Q.
I think he said, no one's going to

12 Company.

14 you know what the state of the science was internal
15 to the tobacco companies about whether there were
16 cancer-causing constituents in tobacco smoke?

Do you know -- and now we're in 1964, not
No, I did not do research.

Q.
1967.
What's the cigarette industry now
2 coming out and saying about a report that's critical,
3 filters not doing what people say filters do?
4
A.
All right.
This is an article that says,
5 page 24 New York Times, cigarette industry condemns a
6 report critical of filters.
7 read on?
Would you like me to
8 Q. I'm sorry.
9 A. I'm sorry.
10 Q. Yes, the first paragraph will be enough.
11 A. Okay.
Would you like me to read on?
The cigarette industry today
12 denounced as deceptive, distorted and unreliable a
13 cancer researcher's finding that many filter
14 cigarettes were at least as hazardous to health as
15 nonfilter brands.
16
Q.
All right.
When do you think the tobacco
17 industry knew exactly what that paragraph says, that
18 filtered cigarettes are no safer than nonfiltered
19 cigarettes?
20
A.
Okay.
Again, you're saying what did I
21 know from their internal documents that would
22 establish when they knew what?

4 condemning the report which says filters aren't
5 better.
6 expert their internal thinking.
7
Q.
But I don't know, and I can't answer as an
Do you know whether or not by this time
8 when the federal government was telling people to use
9 filtered cigarettes whether or not the tobacco
10 companies and industry had withheld from the
11 government important information that they held
12 proving that filters don't work?
13
A.
No, I don't know that information.
I have
14 not done any assessment of their internal documents
15 which would help me answer that yes or no.

document?
A.
The title of the document says, "I do not
3 believe that your position pertaining to cigarettes
4 is justified," an open letter to the New York Times
5 from Phillip Morris, Incorporated.
6
Q.
Right.
And what was their reasoning?
7 Let's just look at the first paragraph there and see
8 what they say is unreasonable about the New York
9 Times.
10
A.
Okay.
It says, "The New York Times in its
11 editorial of August 29, 1969, announced unusual
12 policy with regard to cigarette advertising.
13 continue to accept cigarette advertising but will
14 require that it carry a health warning and tar and
15 nicotine contents.
16 any policy you choose, I do not believe that your
17 position pertaining to cigarettes is justified."
18
Q.
It will
While I respect your right to set
So the tobacco -- excuse me, at least this
19 company didn't want the New York Times -- excuse me,
20 didn't want to have to put a health warning in their
21 advertisements for cigarettes in the New York Times,
22 right?
23
A.
I'm not sure I -- this sentence -- yes, it
24 says that -- it says and tar and nicotine contents.
25 One thing to know is that -- and I don't know.
I'd
564
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 have to -- I would prefer to read the whole letter
2 and then I'd be able to comment more thoroughly.
3 this is a time when the Federal Trade Commission
4 actually had told the cigarette companies, I believe
5 it was 1960, that you must not advertise tar and
6 nicotine content.
7
But
Later on the FTC changes its mind about
8 that and roughly ten years later, I think it was
9 1970, says, would you please put the tar and nicotine
10 on there.
11 tar and nicotine on there, so -- and they're
12 disagreeing with the New York Times telling them they
13 should.
14 Q.
My question --
15 A.
I don't know why.
16 Q.
My question, Dr. Hoffman, is exceedingly
17 simple.
18 nothing to do with the government's doing with tar
19 and nicotines, when they put it on, when they took
20 off, when they wanted it on --
So they're saying they don't to put the
It has nothing to do with the FDC.
21 A. Uh-huh.
22 Q. -- when they want it off.
It has
My question to
23 you is from reading this paragraph right here, does
24 it indicate to you that the New York Times is going

3 health warning.
4
A.
Yes, I think that they're saying that
5 that's a policy.
6 opinion, but he also says in that same sentence that
7 it's policy.
8 what you're asking me to is to confirm that that's
9 what they're saying?
10
Q.
Editorial, sometimes it's just
So yes, I'd like to confirm?
Is that
I just want to know if this -- I just know
11 if it appears to you from this letter written by the
12 tobacco companies to the New York times, whether or
13 not it appears that New York Times is going to
14 require this cigarette manufacturer to put a health
15 warning on its ads if they're going to go in the New
16 York Times.
17 A. Yes, that's what it says.
18 Q. And the cigarette company is disagreeing
19 with the New York Times.
20 do they?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Okay.
23
They don't want to do that,
That's the first thing that we read.

12 Q. And with regard to his statement that

19 question -- my question -- I don't want to know what

5 side to that, that people thought that it was bad for

It's clear to you, though, even though

MR. WARRINER:
It's
Can you highlight that
and blow it up a little bit, please?
BY MR. WARRINER:
6 Q. Would you read that for me, please?
7 A. It says, "Based upon an analysis of all
8 the data reviewed in its entirety, the staff has
9 concluded that there appear to be such significant
10 gaps in consumer knowledge that a substantial portion
11 of the population does not know how dangerous smoking
12 is or whether the dangers of smoking apply to them
13 and therefore does not have an understanding of the
14 health hazards of smoking.
15 data suggests that, A, a large number of consumers do
16 not know what diseases are related to smoking; B, a
17 substantial number seriously misunderstand and
18 underestimate the extent of the increased risk of
19 suffering these health problems as a result of
20 smoking; and C, many seriously underestimate or are
21 unaware of the severity of those health consequences
22 and the increased risk of premature death from these
23 illnesses; and D, a significant number of consumers
24 incorrectly do not believe that these health
25 consequences have any personal relevance to

2 Q.
All right.
And the next page, please.
3 This section of the report, if you look at the first
4 sentence, deals with the overall risk and reduction
5 in life expectancy.
6 are several discrete areas that we talked about in
7 your direct your attention about consumer knowledge.
8 One was in the actual appreciation of the risk of
9 contracting lung cancer, contracting other diseases

10 and it also shortening your life.
11 reading a lot of the textbooks talking about --
Do you remember
12 A. Right.
13 Q. -- shortening your life?
14 A. We talked about all those.
15 Q. This is what the FTC wrote after reviewing
16 all of these polls and surveys of over 8,000 people
17 with regard to consumers' appreciation of a reduction
18 in life expectancy.
19 again the first is sort of a lead-up to that.

A.

Q.

It's
not -- he's going to have to highlight it for you.
A.
You have to show it to me.
Okay.
"The
15 data projected nationwide indicate that some
16 Americans still do not even know that smoking is
17 hazardous to health."
18
Q.
And then the conclusion sentence at the
19 bottom of that paragraph, please.
20 data and statistics in there.
21
A.
There's a bunch of
"Given that there are approximately 54
22 million smokers in this country, these data suggest
23 that millions of Americans who smoke still do not
24 know that smoking is harmful to their health."

Right.
This is
We were trying to figure out which
date the number applied to.
Q.
We're in 1981 and now we now at least the
6 government -- according to the government, there are
7 54 million smokers in the country in 1981, correct?
8 A. Yes, that's -- that's what it says.
9 Q. All right.
Again, moving along.
Two
10 pages later on 3-13, this actually I do want to start
11 with the where somebody else had highlighted where it
12 says Yankelovich in the middle of the page and go
13 down to the rest of that paragraph.
14 you will remember, was the study that was
15 commissioned by a tobacco company that they took into
16 account.
17
A.
Yankelovich, if
Could you read that, please.
"Yankelovich found that 15 percent of the
18 sample and 24 percent of smokers did not believe that
19 smokers die younger than nonsmokers.
20 suggests thus that substantial numbers of people do
21 not know that smoking reduces their life expectancy.
22 The data also indicate that most people seriously
23 underestimate the number of years one's life

Q.
All right.
Moving on the page 3-17, which
3 will be section three deals with the issue of cancer
4 now, not life expectancy.
5 starting with the survey data indicate.
6
A.
Okay.
The second sentence
I see it.
"The survey data
7 indicate that consumers evidence greater knowledge
8 about the smoking cancer link than about the other
9 health hazards of smoking.
However, the data also
10 indicate that some and perhaps many people remain
11 unaware of the cancer risk.
12 suggest that substantial numbers of consumers who may
13 know that smoking is related to cancer seriously
14 underestimate the extent to which smoking increases
15 their cancer risk and the extent to which a smoker
16 increases his/her risk of death from cancer."
In addition, the data

18 A. "While most consumers know that smoking is

18 Q. Next page, first sentence.

Well, to sum up without going
back through this report line by line by line --
19 A. Uh-huh.
20 Q. -- would you agree with me at least that
21 in 1981, the FTC having reviewed many, many, many
22 polls found that a very large percentage of people
23 did not understand that cigarettes were addictive?

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

(212) 490-34301 having reviewed the 1981 FTC staff report that a very

6 A.

I can tell you that that's what the FTC is
Right.
And then in addition, people
didn't appreciate in nearly the numbers you suggested
10 earlier that smoking cigarettes reduces life

12
A.
That's what the FTC was saying in the

14 certain group of staff members who interpreted the
15 polls in the way they did.

10

Q.
Did the 1981 FTC staff report look at
2 television news or public service announcements about
3 the dangers of smoking?
4 A. No it.
5 Q. It looked at a small number of polls; is
6
that correct?
7 A. That's correct.
8 Q. Including Gallup and Roper polls?
9 A. Yes, that's right.
10 Q. And in -- let me ask you this.
How does
11 that 1981 FTC staff report square with your research
12 and the conclusions that you reached?
13
14
15
A.
It's completely at odds with what I found
in my research.
Q.
Now, in the course of your research in
16 this case, have you come across any information about
17 how the Roper organization responded to the 1981 FTC
18 staff report, which used some of its surveys in its
19 report?
20 A.
Yes, I did.
21 Q.
And what did your research find?
22 A.
I found that Mr. Roper himself of the
23 Roper organization was very distressed and asked
24 Congress to take note of the fact that he felt that
25 the report by the staff members of the FTC had
591
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 misrepresented his survey relates, that the numbers
2 they used were correct but that the conclusions they
3 drew from them were the precise opposite in fact of
4 what Roper himself thought that those statistics
5 showed.
6 Q.
And was that made part of the
7 congressional record that you looked at in your
8 research?
9
10
11
A.
Yes.
Mr. Roper asked explicitly if it
would be -- could be included.
Q.
Okay.
I'm going to put up -- well, let me
12 ask you this.
13 research had the opportunity to examine various Roper
14 polls on the issue of the publics awareness?
Have you in the course of your
15 A. Yes, I have seen some.
16 Q. Okay.
I provided you with a copy of a
17 1970 Roper poll, Exhibit Number AZR 372, and I'd like
18 to ask you to -- study of attitude, public attitudes
19 towards cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry in
20 1970, the Roper research organization at the bottom.
21 I'd like you to turn to page three of that document,
22 at least numbered page three and tell me -- at the
23 top of the page, it says summary of major findings.
24 A. Yes, I see that.

All right.
I'm going to

"We only have two editorial comments to

7 the antismoking campaign has been extremely heavy for
8 some time and particularly so in the past two years
9 and that there has been little, if anything,
The first is that we feel all results of this

11 that correctly?

13 Q. And how does that statement square with
14
15
16
17
the research that you've done in this case?
A.
I think it's very consist with the results
that I got.
Q.
Now, following it says, "The percentage of
18 people who smoke has decreased since 1968 from
19 41 percent to 39 percent and the percentage of
20 smokers who have tried to stop smoking has increased
21 from 59 percent to 64 percent.

Are you there?
4 A. Yeah, I'm there.
5 Q. Okay.
6
I'm there.
I've highlighted the second bullet
point on that page.
7 A. Okay.
8 Q. "When asked if they had read or heard
9
something in the past year that had made them more
10 worried or less worried about smoking, 38 percent
11 said they had read or heard something that made them
12 more worried but only two percent said something had
13 made them less worried."
Did I read that correctly?
14 A. Yes, you did.
15 Q. And tell me based upon your research and
16 weighing the different stories that you saw talking
17 about the dangers of smoking versus maybe some of the
18 stories that Mr. Warriner showed you where the link
19 may have been questioned, how does that statement
20 square with your research?
21
A.
This statement very much is in accordance
22 with my findings, which were that when you looked at
23 the broad universe of information that was being
24 presented as this Roper report says, very little was
25 getting through to the public that refuted the idea
594

Only three percent, which meant 97 percent
did not identify them as reliable on this issue.
Q.
How does this finding fit in with your
research findings?
A.
Well, again, it's very consistent with my
23 findings.
24 industry for information, and you can tell this
25 partly because the newspapers, even though there were
People were not looking to the tobacco
597
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 occasional articles that you saw, for the most part,
2 this information wasn't out there at all, which tells
3 me that even the newspapers s didn't think these were
4 reliable sources.
5
Q.
Now, you were shown on cross-examination
6 about a dozen or so newspaper articles from the
7 New York Times in the early 1950s and early 1960s.
8 Do you recall that?
9 A. Yes, I do.
10 Q. Now, was Mr. Soffer living in New York
11
City at the time when those papers ran?
12 A. No.
13 Q. And you were also shown actually a New
For the most part, he was not.
14 York Times article from 1910, Smoking Good For
15 Health. 16 A. Yes, I do.
17 Q. And certainly Mr. Soffer wasn't living in
18
Do you recall that?
New York City in 1910.
19 A. No, he wasn't born.
20 Q. I notice that the beginning of that
21 article talks about, quote, all of the abuse which
22 has been hurled at the practice of tobacco smoking.
23
A.
Obviously this doctor felt he was, you
24 know, overwhelmed by the other people saying what
25 they were saying and he wanted to get a different
598
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 point of view across.
2 view, as that article indicates, as that doctor
3 indicates, is that people think it's injurious.
4
Q.
But the predominant point of
Even back in 1910, did your research
5 indicate whether folks were hurling abuse at the
6 practice of tobacco smoking?
7
A.
Very much so.
This is the period of time
8 in which 16 states voted to, you know, prohibit
9 tobacco and cigarette use.
10 Q. Okay.
11 A. So it was a lot -- and the schools started
12 all these laws and passed -- passed new laws and
13 created courses of study.
14
Q.
Mr. Warriner also showed you a copy of the
15 1967 Federal Trade Commission report.
16 that?
Do you recall
17 A. Yes, that's right.
18 Q. Now, in looking through that during the
19 cross, I noticed that on page 14 of the report, they
20 make reference to a 1959 Newton, Massachusetts
21 survey, and I'm wondering if that is a survey that
22 you've come across in your research in this matter?
23 A. Yes, I have.
24 Q. And I'm going to put up a small chart from
25
that.
Well, first tell us about that survey.
599
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
A.
This was a survey that was conducted by
2 Harvard University at -- in Newton, Massachusetts.
3 They were following up on the Portland survey, and
4 they were interested in knowing what young people
5 thought about smoking.
6 Q. And this was a survey conducted when?
7 A. 1959.
8 Q. Okay.
9
I'm going to put up the results,
and I'd like to ask you if these are accurate
10 representations of the survey results that you found
11 in your research.
12 heard that lung cancer may be caused by smoking, a
13 1959 Harvard survey of high school students.
14 you read off the results to the jury?
15
A.
Yes.
The question being, have you ever

17 study, one of the famous early studies.
18 "Have you are ever heard that lung cancer may be
19 caused by smoking."
20 students, that means the older students in the 1950s,
21 95 percent said that yes, they had heard that, five
22 percent said no.
23 ten percent said no, 90 percent said yes.
24 end of the 1950s, all of these high school students
25 were reporting that they had heard about lung cancer
It's also called the Newton

and its connection to cigarette smoking.
Q.
Is this survey consistent or inconsistent
3 with the earlier surveys you showed in your direct
4 examination?
5 A.
Yes, it's very consistent.
There were a
6 couple of other surveys and again, another one in
7 1959 by Senior Scholastic.
8 97 percent, so extremely close.
9 bit earlier, the Gilbert study 1956 was I think 95
10
11
percent.
Q.
That number was
And then a little
So these numbers were all right together.
Another document that counsel showed you
12 on cross-examination was this 1959 doctors and
13 smoking document.
14 A. Yes, I see that.
15 Q. I'd like to just put up a couple of quotes
16 that weren't shown on cross, and I'm going to -- can
17 you read that?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. I'll read through and you can follow
20
The yellow?
along.
21 A. Okay.
22 Q. "Approximately three-fifths of the
23 physicians in August 1959 advised a patient or
24 patients with a cardiovascular condition to give up
25 smoking and two-thirds of the physicians gave this
601
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 same advice to a patient or patients with respiratory
2 conditions."
3 A.
Yes, you did.
4 Q.
Let's going to page Roman numeral six.
Did I read that correctly?
5 "More physicians place reliance on information
6 concerning smoking and disease from the American
7 Cancer Society than from any other group."
8 consistent with your research?
9
A.
Yes, it is.
Is that
And of course, that's
10 corroborated by the last poll we just talked about as
11 well.
12
Q.
"More than two-thirds of the physicians
13 rated this source as a good one.
14 of the research conducted in laboratories of tobacco
15 companies, all sources were rated higher in
16 August 1959 than they were in April 1958.
17 three-fifths of the physicians feel that research
18 conducted in laboratories of the tobacco companies is
19 a poor source and half feel that independent research
20 supported by funds from the tobacco research
21 committee is a poor source."
With the exception
Almost
22 A. Uh-huh.
23 Q. What does that tell you about the state of
24 if this was sent to doctors how they were reacting to
25 information coming from the tobacco companies versus
602
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
groups like the American Cancer Society?
A.
I think they were treating, as this shows,
3 that information from tobacco companies with great
4 skepticism and like consumers everywhere were saying
5 that it's better to looking to a disinterested source
6 for your information.
7
Q.
Now, you were shown a number of these
8 tobacco company statements on your cross, and I'm
9 wondering in the course of your research, did you
10 ever come across a tobacco company statement in any
11 of the school books that you examined?
12 A. No, none.
13 Q. Did you ever see the tobacco companies'
14 statements presented in the advice columns that you
15 looked at?
16 A. No, never.
17 Q. How about the doctors' columns?
18 A. Never, not once.
19 Q. And did you see the tobacco company
20 position expressed in any of the public service
21 announcements by the American Cancer Society or the
22 American Lung Association?
23 A. No, never.
24 Q. And in connection with the various news
25
articles from the New York Times that you were shown
603
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 on cross, did -- would you consider those to be
2 representative of the larger body of stories that you
3 came across in your research?
4
A.
No, not at all.
The -- as I said, I
5 looked very carefully at this and found that they
6 were relatively rare.
7 looked at every single article and made all the
8 calculations, it was about one percent, maybe
9 1.5 percent of the time, which means, you know,
Los Angeles Times where I
10 85 percent of the time, it was -- it was quite
11 different.
12
Q.
Now, we spent a little bit of time looking
13 at the Frank Statement during your cross-examination.
14 Do you recall that?
15 A. Yes, I do.
16 Q. Did you see any evidence in the case
17 materials that you looked at that Mr. Soffer ever saw
18 the Frank Statement?
19 A.
20 recalled it.
21 Q.
No.
No one in the group of depositions
Did you see any evidence in all the
22 research that you did that suggested that the Frank
23 Statement somehow reassured smokers that smoking
24 might be all right?
25
A.
No, I never saw in evidence to that
604
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 effect.
2 Q.
3
Now, you're not -- you're not a scientist,
are you?
4 A. No.
5 Q. You're not a medical doctor?
6 A. No.
7 Q. And would it be fair to say that you're
8 not in a position to offer any expert opinions on the
9 scientific merits of any of the statements that were
10
being made in these newspaper articles?
11 A. No, I cannot offer that kind of opinion.
12 Q. In other words, you're not able to offer
13 an expert opinion on what the scientific consensus
14 was at any point in time, are you?
15 A. No.
16 Q. You were asked some questions and read a
17 few portions from the cover and the back cover of a
18 book by someone named Allan Brandt.
19 that?
Do you recall
20 A. Yes, I do.
21 Q. And that's a book that you've taken a look
22 at as what you called a secondary source; is that
23 right?
24 A. That's correct.
25 Q. This was something that was written quite
605
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
recently?
2 A. Oh, yeah.
3 Q. It's not something that was written back
4 in the 1950s and 1960s, the time period that you
5 researched, is it?
6
7
A.
No, not at all.
It's definitely a
secondary source --
8 Q. Okay.
9 A. -- meaning written much af -- long after
10
11
the fact.
Q.
Do you consider the Brandt book to be an
12 authoritative or accurate account of public awareness
13 back in the 1950s and '60s?
14 A. No, I don't think so.
15 Q. Early on in the examination, counsel went
16 through a long list of various actors and newspersons
17 and celebrities that may have suffered -- may have
18 smoked cigarettes and may have suffered diseases
19 potentially related to cigarette smoking.
20 recall that?
21 A.
Yes, I do.
22 Q.
Now, in your research, did the newspapers
Do you
23 and magazines draw attention to the fact that some of
24 these famous people were suffering from diseases
25 related to smoking?
606
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Yes, they typically did.
2 Q. And did that publicity add fuel to this
3 issue of awareness that the public was receiving
4 about the dangers of smoking?
5 MR. WARRINER:
6 THE WITNESS:
Objection.
Well, I think very much
7 so.
8 mind are Natalie Cole talking about her
9 father, Nat King Cole, and the way in which
Two examples that come right away to
10 he died.
11 this quite a bit when he first contracted
12 lung cancer and said in many interviews,
13 and of course he's very famous, that he had
14 been, you know, an excessive smoker, smoked
15 several packs of cigarette every day.
16
17
18
19
And also John Wayne talked about
BY MR. KOETHE:
Q.
Was John Wayne actually a spokesperson for
the American Cancer Society at one point in time?
A.
I don't recall.
He might have been.
20 There was a long list of celebrities who were
21 participants in that.
22
Q.
I just don't remember.
And when Humphrey Bogart died or when
23 Edward R. Murrow died, did these deaths get publicity
24 in terms of linking their death to cigarette smoking?
25
A.
Yes, they did.
607
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
And what role do you believe based on your
2 research this issue played on the issue of public
3 awareness?
4
A.
I think that it very much pulled the
5 people's heartstrings and convinced them, further
6 convinced them that cigarette smoking was dangerous
7 and that if they didn't quit, they might very well
8 get it, you know, as Mr. Soffer himself said.
9 added to this what Time magazine called an Everest of
10 information on smoking and its hazards.
11 stories were a part of that Mount Everest.
12
Q.
And it
So those
There was a series of questions that asked
13 you about whether you could assess how smokers
14 receive messages about the dangers of smoking and how
15 the addicted smoker would receive messages.
16 recall that?
17 A.
Yes, I do.
18 Q.
Now, based on your research, can you tell
Do you
19 us all the publicity that you showed to us, was that
20 information made available to nonsmokers?
21
A.
Yes.
The school books and all that, if
22 that's what you were referring to, yes.
23 was made available to nonsmokers.
24 Q. Newspapers?
25 A. Pardon?
Everything
608
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Q. Newspapers.
2 A. Newspapers, movies, television.
3
The
general public received that information.
4 Q. So nonsmokers got this information?
5 A. Oh, yeah.
6 Q. And smokers got this information --
7 A. Absolutely.
8 Q. -- is that right?
9
And even addicted
smokers got this information; isn't that right?
10 A. Everyone got this information.
11 Q. And in fact, over the course of time tens
12 of millions of smokers quit smoking; isn't that
13 right?
14 A. That's right.
15 Q. And that includes addicted smokers; isn't
16
17
18
19
that right?
A.
Yes, it includes all types of smokers, 50
million at least and growing, of course, in number.
Q.
And then there was a series of questions
20 about whether Mr. Soffer in fact did what he was
21 told.
22 community was telling the public that they ought to
23 quit and that by quitting, they could improve their
24 health and avoid bad health consequences; is that
25 right?
Do you recall that?
The public health
609
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Yes.
2 Q. And I believe that Mr. Smoker --
I remember those questions.
3 Mr. Soffer did quit smoking shortly or some period
4 before his cancer diagnosis; is that right?
5 A. Yes, he did.
6 Q. And I want you to assume that -- or do you
7
8
9
10
know what year he quit smoking?
A.
1992.
I believe he quit smoking in -- he died in
I think he was diagnosed in '91, which would
mean he quit smoking in '90 -- I'd have to --
11 Q. Okay.
12 A. I'll look again in my --
13 Q. Okay.
14 A. -- my notes to --
15 Q. That's fine.
16 A. -- ascertain it.
17 Q. Let's assume that Mr. Soffer quit sometime
18 around 1990.
19 A. Yeah.
20 Q. Was 1990 the first time the public health
21 community was telling the public that you ought to
22 quit smoking?
23 A. No.
24 Q. How many years before 1990 was the public
25
health community advising the public that smoking was
610
