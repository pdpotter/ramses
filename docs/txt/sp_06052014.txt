DIRECT EXAMINATION
8 BY MR. CABANISS:
9 Q.
10
Ma'am, would you please tell us your
full name?
11 A. My name is Janette Thomas Greenwood.
12 Q. And it's Doctor Greenwood, correct?
13 A. Yes, it is.
14 Q. Doctor Greenwood, before we started
15 the deposition, the court reporter was talking to
16 us -- primarily to me -- since I'm conducting the
17 deposition by telephone, I'm going to do my very
18 best to make sure that you have completed your
19 answer to any questions by myself or other
20 counsel before I begin to ask the next question.
21 At the same time if you would please listen
22 carefully and make sure that I have completed my
23 question before you begin to answer.
24 have the habit of talking slowly and I may pause

Sometimes I7
1 before I finish the question.
2 with you, we'll work together and make sure we
3 get a good record.
4

6
So if it's okay
All right?
A. Sure.
That sounds good.
I'll do my
Q. Now, can you tell me if you are
best.
7 prepared at this point in time, Doctor Greenwood,
8 to tell us your final opinions that you intend to
9 give in the case involving the Lourie family?
10 A. Yes, I am.
11 Q. What are those opinions?
12 A. My opinion based on my research is
13 that there was public awareness regarding the
14 issues of smoking and health as well as the
15 addictive nature of cigarettes at the time during
16 Mrs. Lourie's lifetime.
17
Q.
When you say there was public
18 awareness concerning the issues of smoking and
19 health and the addictive nature of smoking, I
20 assume you're referring to the smoking of
21 cigarettes, correct?
22 A. Yes, I am.
23 Q. You said that this opinion was with
24
respect to Mrs. Lourie, Barbara Lourie's
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34088
1 lifetime.
2 A.
At what point of her lifetime?
Well, I looked, again, as a
3 historian, I am most interested in context.
So
4 my research actually preceded her birth date,
5 which is 1945.
6 larger the question of whether there was public
7 awareness regarding the, you know, smoking and
8 health issues relating to cigarettes and their
9 addictive nature mainly focusing on those
But I looked at, again, this
10 particular years of her life from 1945 through
11 1997, but also as a historian I delved deeper
12 into the past to tease out the context.
13
14
Q. How far back did you go into the
A. Well, I have researched back to the
past?
15
16 time when tobacco was actually introduced to
17 Europeans by Native Americans which is in
18 Columbus's voyage.
19 ways.
20
Q.
So I've gone back quite a
When it comes to the issue of smoking
21 and health, then, am I to assume that you looked
22 at that particular issue from the time Columbus
23 discovered the Americas almost back when people
24 thought the world was flat then up until
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34089
1
Mrs. Lourie's passing in September of 1997?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. Can you tell me, please, with respect
4 to -- let me just pick a time period -- let's say
5 the 1920s what was the public awareness when it
6 came to the issue of smoking and health during
7 that particular decade?
8
9
A.
Well, certainly there seems to have
been awareness that smoking was not healthy; that
10 it could cause all kinds of problems.
11 for example, that in Massachusetts beginning in
12 the 1890s this state mandated that children
13 should be taught about the dangerous nature of
14 tobacco and that, you know, by the 1920s and
15 '30s, actually by the 1920s as I recall, the
16 state mandates that children be taught about the
17 risks of tobacco, you know, beginning in second
18 grade.
19
I know,
So there certainly was an awareness
20 of this is something that's not good for you.
21 There was sports heros like Walter Johnson, a
22 great pitcher for the Washington Senators in the
23 1920s who spoke out against smoking.
24 Reader's Digest begins in the 1920s to talk about
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-3408
The10
1 the dangers of smoking and continue to do so up
2 through this period.
3
It's in the nineteen teens and
4 certainly through the twenties that some great
5 industrialists, people like Henry Ford in
6 particular, are speaking out against what he
7 calls "the little white slaver" and the
8 destructive nature of cigarettes; and he and some
9 other people like Thomas Edison would not even
10
hire smokers.
11
So certainly people are talking about
12 these issues at this time and the message of
13 Henry Ford's book, "The Little White Slaver."
14 gets replicated in parenting guides and magazines
15 for women and through other sources in the 1920s.
16
Q.
It
Was there any counter-information?
17 Information, in other words, that ran counter to
18 there being adverse health effects from smoking
19 cigarettes in the 1920s?
20
A.
As I recall there really -- I don't
21 recall many sort of people saying that this is
22 something that's good for you.
23 know, mostly the emphasis is on, you know,
24 shortness of breath and what they call tobacco
I think, you
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340811
1 heart at that time and throat irritation and
2 things like that.
3 Q.
Were there any messages put out in
4 the 1920s -- and why don't we just expand this
5 into the 1930s also -- were there any messages
6 put out that would suggest that smoking
7 cigarettes did not cause a shortness of breath?
8
MS. DABOLL:
Object to form.
9 A. I don't recall any at the moment.
10 Q. Were there any messages put out in
11 the 1920s or 1930s by anyone with respect to
12 certain cigarettes not irritating the throat or
13 being less irritative of the throat?
14
A.
Yes.
There were advertisements in
15 this era that did talk about, you know, a
16 cigarette being, you know, less irritating to the
17 throat and things like that, yes.
18
19
Q.
You mentioned the sports figure last
name was Walter Johnson?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. Can you tell me, please, with respect
22 to Walter Johnson, or not with respect to
23 Walter Johnson, but with respect to other
24 athletes.
Were any other athletes putting out
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340812
1
2
messages on behalf of smoking cigarettes?
A.
Certainly some athletes were
3 spokesman, spokespeople for cigarette companies
4 and cigarette products.
5
There were also in addition to
6 Walter Johnson, I'm thinking on the other side,
7 too, Gene Tunney, the boxer, wrote an article
8 roughly in this era as I recall that was about,
9 you know, about the dangers of cigarettes.
10 Something about the knockout punch of cigarettes,
11 or something like that.
12 boxing metaphor to talk about the dangers of
13 cigarettes.
14
15
16
He used some kind of
So I think, you know, athletes were
used on both sides of this issue.
Q.
Well, we have Walter Johnson and
17 Gene Tunney talking about the risk of smoking.
18 Name all the athletes, if you would, please,
19 promoting smoking at that time.
20
A.
Well, I don't think I could name all
21 of them.
But, as I recall, there were people
22 like I think Ty Cobb might have been one in this
23 era as well as -- well, you know, I'm just not
24 sure, but I'm, you know, I think -- well, I think
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340813
1
Babe Ruth did from time to time.
2 Q.
3 into the 1960s.
4 that, are you aware of any additional athletes,
5 sports heros, that promoted smoking cigarettes?
6
7
A.
Let's expand this on to -- let's go
So from 1920 to 1960 if I expand
Just to be clear, are you asking in
the period 1920 and 1960?
8 Q. Yes, ma'am.
9 A. Okay.
10 Q. Including the 1960s?
11 A. Well, there are some regulations that
12 go into effect in the late 1950s in which, you
13 know, it's clear that athletes and movie stars
14 and things like that are not to be used in
15 cigarette advertising.
So that ends.
16 Q. And it ended when?
17 A. In the late 1950s.
18 Q. Do you have a specific year?
19 A. I believe it's around 1959.
20 Q. Up until the point of 1959, any
I'm sorry.
21 additional athletes that you can name that
22 promoted smoking cigarettes?
23
24
A.
Well, let's see.
Williams did.
I think Ted
I'm a Boston Red Sox fan here.

888 811-340814
1
And, again, you know, there were
2 those voices out there.
3 stress as a historian who has been asked to be an
4 expert witness on public awareness that
5 advertisements were one voice of many voices in
6 this era.
7 stressing the dangers of cigarettes, especially
8 with the scientific studies that really begin in
9 the early 1950s.
10
But I just want to
One voice among many that are
So I just want to make that clear
11 that this is one message that's being put out
12 into, you know, the information environment, but
13 it's only one.
14 are scientific studies that are being widely
15 publicized.
16 immediately incorporating these scientific
17 studies.
18 for example, in Time magazine called "Smoking" --
19 "Cancer and Smoking Continued," an ongoing column
20 that was reporting on the latest scientific
21 evidence.
And certainly in the 1950s there
There are textbooks that are
There are columns, a regular column,
22 It's in the '50s as well, 1954 that
23 the American Cancer Society makes -- ten years
24 before the famous Surgeon General's report of
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340815
1 1964 that the American Cancer Society comes out
2 and talks about smoking being the principal cause
3 of lung cancer.
4
There are two major Surgeon General
5 statements in 1957 and 1959 in which the Surgeon
6 General first states that there is, you know,
7 there is a link between smoking and cancer.
8 years later in '59 the Surgeon General says that
9 smoking is a causative factor of cancer.
10
Two
So I just, you know, as a historian
11 and someone who's researched this information
12 environment, I just want to make it clear that,
13 you know, athletes who are representing tobacco
14 companies are one voice amidst this, you know,
15 whole massive amount of information that's coming
16 out from very many different sources in the 1950s
17 regarding the dangers of smoking.
18
Q.
Would you agree with me, Doctor
19 Greenwood, that with respect to the years that
20 hear the various messages that it is the type of
21 person that has the years that will pick up on
22 messages from particular authors or people who
23 give those messages?
24
MS. DABOLL:
Object to form.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340816

MR. CABANISS:
2 that.
3 BY MR. CABANISS:
4 Q.
I'm going to withdraw
That was too awkward.
If we're talking about youngsters,
5 Doctor Greenwood, in the 1950s and they get
6 messages from their heros, athletic stars, about
7 smoke this brand or smoke that brand of cigarette
8 as opposed to scientific articles that received
9 media attention, do you not agree that youngsters
10 are more likely to listen to the message of their
11 hero than the message given in some scientific
12 article or articles?
13
14
MS. DABOLL:
A.
Object to form.
Well, I want to make it clear I don't
15 think I can answer that question, or I won't
16 answer it because I'm not -- I can't answer it I
17 should say, because I'm not an expert on consumer
18 behavior.
19 you know, what particular impression, message,
20 that individuals take away from advertising.
21 That's a whole area of expertise that's outside
22 of my area of expertise.
23
24
I'm a social historian.
I don't know,
What I do know, however, if I may
continue, is that the 1950s we see, again, this
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340817
1 message of the dangers of smoking really being
2 aimed at young people.
3 American Cancer Society statement comes out about
4 the dangers of smoking and that there is a link
5 between cigarettes and cancer, the Cancer Society
6 doesn't stop there.
7 to target young people.
8 campaign which is actually evident in
9 Massachusetts in particular where Mrs. Lourie
That when in 1954 the

12 system.
13 film strips.
14 coloring books and all kinds of information
15 that's targeted at young people in the 1950s to
16 talk about the dangers of cigarettes.
17
It's evident in the kinds of materials
You see it in pamphlets.
You see it in
You see it in comic books and
The other thing that's going on, too,
18 is that you see it in the textbooks.
19 stated, Massachusetts very early on mandated
20 health education that emphasized the dangers of
21 tobacco.
22 this only gets strengthened over the course of
23 20th century.
24
And, as I
Again, going back to the 1890s, and
In the 1950s the Newton Public
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340818
1 Schools where Mrs. Lourie went to school actually
2 had a special committee, and this is in the
3 school committee records for the Town of Newton,
4 had a special committee that went out and, you
5 know, basically gathered information that was
6 available from organizations like the American
7 Cancer Society and cataloged this information.
8 We know -- I know from having looked
9 at the textbooks that were actually used in the
10 Newton school system when Mrs. Lourie was in
11 elementary school as well as when she was in high
12 school talk about the dangers of smoking.
13
The elementary textbook which she
14 would have used in the mid 1950s talks about, you
15 know, teach -- you know, in the text itself it
16 says, Stay away from tobacco it's bad for you.
17 And in the Teacher's Edition of that textbook it
18 directs teachers to emphasize the dangers of
19 smoking; stay away from cigarettes.
20
The textbook that was used in the
21 Newton schools and senior high when Mrs. Lourie
22 was at that grade level incorporated the latest
23 scientific studies about cigarettes; about
24 longevity, about smokers and the risk of cancer
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340819
1 being ten times greater for lung cancer, being
2 ten times greater for smokers as opposed to
3 non-smokers.
4
The textbook also emphasized that if
5 you start smoking, you are very likely to become
6 addicted -- and that's the word that they used --
7 to smoking.
8
9
So this message, again, is something
that the American Cancer Society is stressing.
10 It's showing up in the textbooks.
11 publication called Senior Scholastic which is a
12 weekly news magazine used in public schools.
13 an indication I think of how much this message
14 was getting through is that they do a pole in
15 1960 asking students if they think that, you
16 know, cigarettes are dangerous; there is a link
17 between smoking and cancer.
18 97 percent of students who were polled say yes to
19 that.
20
There is a
And
And something like
So that indicates to me again, you
21 know, as a social historian, as someone who has
22 been asked to draw conclusions about, you know,
23 whether there was public awareness, that these
24 messages are coming from many, many different
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340820
1 sources.
2 are, you know, by this point certainly talking
3 about cancer sticks and making references to
4 being, you know, a cigarette fiend and even in
5 music people talking about the addiction of
6 cigarettes.
7
Even reflected in movies where people
So, again, messages coming from lots
8 and lots of different places.
9 answer to your question, but I hope it gives you
10 a sense of how I've drawn some conclusions here.
11
Q.
So that's a long
You mentioned during your answer,
12 probably about three pages ago, about the dangers
13 of cigarettes being known in the 1890s.
14
15
Do you recall that?
A.
I said there is certainly discussion
16 about, you know, things like tobacco heart.
17 I do recall that.
18 Q.
19
20
21
Yes,
In the 1890s were modern cigarettes
being produced at that time?
A.
Yes, they were.
Well, let me -- I'm sorry, let me
22 just ask, if I may.
I'm not sure -- let me ask
23 you what you mean by "modern" cigarettes, because
24 we may have different definitions of "modern."
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340821
1 So I just want to make sure what you mean by
2 that.
3
Q.
I'm talking about modern cigarettes
4 that are mass-produced by cigarette
5 manufacturers.
6
A.
Yes, I believe the Bonsack cigarette
7 machine, which mass-produced cigarettes for the
8 first time, was invented and first used in the
9 late 1880s.
10
Q.
All right.
So it's your testimony
11 that in the 1890s the articles talking about the
12 risk of smoking cigarettes was referring to
13 modern cigarettes, correct?
14
15
16
A.
It was certainly referring in most
cases I think to mass-produced cigarettes.
Q.
You also mention something about a
17 discussion of longevity in the textbooks that
18 were in the Newton, Massachusetts, schools.
19 you recall that?
20 A.
Yes.
21 Q.
And did the textbooks say that
22 smoking cigarettes would lesson the smoker's
23 longevity?
24
A.
Yes.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-3408
Do22
1
2
Q.
In other words, it would lesson how
long they lived, right?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. I believe you also said, with all due
5 respect your somewhat lengthy response to my
6 question, that there was a poll or survey
7 conducted in 1960 and that 97 percent of the
8 students at Newton, Massachusetts, believed there
9 was a link between smoking and lung cancer.
10
Was that your testimony?
11 A. No, it was not.
12 Q. What was your testimony in that
13
14
regard?
A.
I was referring to Senior Scholastic,
15 which was a weekly news magazine publication that
16 was widely distributed and used in senior high
17 schools in that era.
18 the senior high version of Weekly Reader
19 basically which informs students of current
20 events.
21
It's sort of the, you know,
And what I was referring to was a
22 poll done by Senior Scholastic.
It was not done
23 in Newton.
24 poll that said that 97 percent of students felt
It was done, you know, a national
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340823
1 that, you know, smoking was dangerous and, you
2 know, was related to lung cancer.
3
Q.
Are you aware of any surveys or polls
4 that were conducted in the Newton, Massachusetts,
5 area which referred to beliefs by high school and
6 middle school students concerning whether smoking
7 was in fact related to lung cancer?
8
9
A.
I do know -- well, again, I want to
stress that I'm talking -- I really researched
10 and was, you know, and have drawn my conclusions
11 about public awareness which, again, I think I
12 want to make clear is distinct from belief.
13
But there was a survey done in 1959
14 by Doctor Eva Salber, who was a professor in the
15 School of Public Health at Harvard, and she did a
16 massive study in Newton which got a lot of press
17 in Boston and I think across the country.
18 might have been one of the first of its kind,
19 where she did, you know, had a questionnaire I
20 believe that something like 7,000 students in
21 Newton, everyone in junior and senior high
22 school, filled out.
23 questions were about whether they were smoking,

smoking.
2
Q.
Did that particular study address
3 whether students were aware or had heard about
4 smoking being related to lung cancer?
5
A.
I know that she -- one of the
6 questions she asked was about some of their
7 attitudes about smoking and health issues, yes.
8
9
Q.
it did?
10
11
12
So the answer to my question is, yes,
A. I'm sorry.
Would you repeat it
Q. My question is simply did that
again?
13 particular study address whether or not those
14 students had heard about smoking being related to
15 lung cancer?
16
A.
Again, I don't know exactly how the
17 question was framed.
I don't know if we saw
18 where they heard about it, what their attitudes
19 were; but I do know, again just from reading the
20 reports that were in the Boston Globe in
21 particular, that she was interested in students'
22 attitudes about smoking.
23 I can be.
24 Q.
That's as particular as
Now, the Boston Globe would be what
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340825
1 you would consider a secondary source in your
2 research, would it not?
3
4
5
A.
No.
I would call that a primary
source.
Q.
Well, wouldn't the primary source
6 actually be the report by the person who
7 conducted the survey or poll?
8
9
A.
Well, the Boston Globe is a primary
source in my research on public awareness because
10 it is a document that is being created in that
11 particular time period.
12 interpretation of events.
13 by that.
14
Q.
It's not an
So that's what I mean
It is, however, the interpretation of
15 the actual study and the study's report and
16 conclusions, is it not?
17
A.
But it is a primary source as a
18 document in evidence of public awareness as all
19 newspaper sources are that I used in my research,
20 again, as an attempt to understand various
21 messages that the public was receiving on these
22 issues and as part of this information
23 environment that is being created at that
24 particular time.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340826
1
Q.
My question, however, remains:
And
2 that is the newspaper reports were an
3 interpretation of what was contained in the
4 study, true?
5
A.
No, I object to "interpretation,"
6 that word.
I think maybe we're using it --
7 you're thinking about it in different ways.
8 historian, I'm thinking of a secondary source as
9 being an interpretation drawn; where a historian
As a
10 draws on primary sources on a particular topic
11 and then draws conclusions and then interprets
12 them based on, you know, extensive research.
13
As I recall, the best of my memory of
14 the articles that talked about Doctor Salber's
15 research is that it, you know, quoted her
16 directly.
17 talked a bit about some of her conclusions.
18
Q.
They interviewed her and, you know,
Over the course of history, we have
19 seen a lot of newspaper articles about a lot of
20 different subjects that include even some things
21 in quotation marks, correct?
22
23
24
MS. DABOLL:
A.
Object to form.
Again, I'm not sure what your
question is.
The newspapers quote people.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340827
1
Q.
You just mentioned with respect to
2 Doctor Salber's study that the report even
3 included quotes from Doctor Salber.
4 recall just saying that?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. And my question is:
Do you
Over the course
7 of history, we've had many newspaper articles
8 about many subjects which have included
9 quotations from the source of those particular
10
articles, correct?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Now, does that mean because we have
13 those reports in a newspaper that that somehow
14 makes the reporting accurate?
15
16
MS. DABOLL:
A.
Object to form.
Again, I'm not quite sure what you're
17 asking.
18 that what you're asking?
19 unclear.
20
Are all newspaper reports accurate?
Q.
21
22
I'm just
Do cell phones cause brain cancer?
MS. DABOLL:
A.
I'm sorry.
Is
I'm sorry.
Object to form.
I'm -- as I understand
23 it, I'm here to -- I've been asked to be an
24 expert witness regarding public awareness.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-3408
So as28
1 an expert witness, I can't really answer that
2 question.
3 Q.
4
Was the public at one point in time
aware that cell phones cause brain cancer?
5
6
It's outside of my area of expertise.
MS. DABOLL:
A.
Object to form.
Again, with all due respect, that's
7 not a topic that I have researched and I
8 certainly do not feel, you know, confident or
9 willing at this point to draw any conclusions
10
11
about that.
Q.
Well, even though you haven't
12 researched that subject in depth, you have seen
13 and in fact probably heard or saw on television
14 the claim that the use of cell phones causes
15 brain cancer in humans, have you not?
16
17
MS. DABOLL:
A.
Object to form.
Again, are you asking me as an expert
18 witness or as just as a lay person?
19 again, I think I want to make my role here very
20 clear and I don't feel, you know, that I should
21 answer a question that is beyond my area of
22 expertise.
23
24
Q.
Because,
Your area of expertise is not then,
what, cell phones causing brain cancer?
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340829
1
A.
I'm a social historian.
That's my
2 area of expertise.
3 have a doctorate in and I've taught for over 20
4 years.
5 most confident, you know, answering questions.
6 And it's my understanding that's why time here
7 this morning, is to talk about my findings
8 regarding public awareness and cigarette smoking
9 and addiction.
10
That's the discipline that I
So that's where -- the area that I feel
Q.
And I understand that.
My question
11 is simply you hold yourself out as an expert from
12 the perspective of social history when it comes
13 to public awareness, correct?
14
A.
In this particular case, yes.
Public
15 awareness, again, quite specifically based on the
16 research, extensive research, that I've done on
17 the issue of smoking and health and the addictive
18 nature of cigarettes.
19
Q.
To do this research, I would assume
20 that you had to first identify the sources to
21 which you would go to find out the information
22 you wanted to find to help you answer your
23 question, correct?
24
A.
Yes, the first -- I mean I applied
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340830
1 the historic method to this research as I would
2 any historical question, and the first step of
3 that is to identify sources.
4 actually.
5 have a question that you're pursuing, and then
6 second step is to identify sources that help you
7 answer that question.
8
9
Q.
Or the second step
After you have a question -- sorry --
And then once you have identified
sources, you go about collecting the information
10 you need to be able to draw your conclusions,
11 true?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. How did you -- well, let me ask this
14 question.
15
You have done this before for some of
16 the, or at least one of the cigarette companies
17 that's a Defendant in this case, correct?
18 A. Yes, I've --
19 Q. I want to say before this specific

case.
22 witness to explore this question and to draw
23 conclusions, yes.
24 Q.
When were you first asked to do that
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340831
1 sort of thing?
2 looking for a specific date.
3 A.
4 actually.
5 Q.
6
And when I say "when," I'm not
Approximately when?
Well, I can be pretty specific,
I was first asked in about March 2005.
And did you just refer to something
with which to answer that question?
7 A. No.
8 Q. That is something that you are just
9 able to remember?
10
A.
Yes.
Because it was right around the
11 time I met my husband.
12 about it, or remember it.
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
Q.
So that's the way I think
And can you tell me when you then
first began your work?
A.
I first began my work right soon
after that.
Q.
Now, when you first began that work,
who were you working for?
A.
I was approached by Julia Tyler from
20 a firm in Washington called Johnson, Tyler &
21 Purvis.
22
23
24
Q.
Do you know if this lady and her firm
represented a cigarette or tobacco manufacturer?
A.
I didn't know it initially.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-3408
I wasn't32
1 sure about that, but subsequent conversation it
2 was clear that they had -- that that firm had
3 done some work for Philip Morris.
4
Q.
Now, how many specific cases since
5 you began your work in this area have you worked
6 on?
7
A.
I'm thinking probably about six or
8 seven of them.
9 to go through them and each one at a time to
10
I'd have
count them up I think.
11
12
Maybe more like eight.
Q.
How many depositions have you given
so far?
13 A. This would be my fourth deposition.
14 Q. Do you recall the names of the other
15
cases in which you gave testimony?
16 A. Yes, I do.
17 Q. And what were the names of them, the
18
Plaintiff's name, please?
19
20
A.
The first one was the Craft case,
C-r-a-f-t.
21
Q.
That would have been in May of 2010
22 according to my records.
23 right?
24
A.
Does that sound about
That sounds right, yes.

And when was the next deposition you

gave?
3
4
Q.
and that's spelled C-i-c-c-o-n-e.
5
Q. And then the third deposition you
7 A. Was a case called Cohen, C-o-e-h-n.
8 C-o-h-e-n, sorry.
9 first said it.
6
gave?
That didn't sound right when I
10 Q. And your fourth deposition?
11 A. Is right now.
12 Q. Is right now?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Have you testified at trial before?
15 A. One time.
16 Q. In what case?
17 A. That was the Ciccone case.
18 Q. When you selected the sources that
19 you would go to to help you answer your questions
20 concerning public awareness of the risk of
21 smoking cigarettes and the addictive nature of
22 smoking cigarettes, how did you go about
23 selecting those sources?
24
A.
Well, I went about it the way I do
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340834
1 any other historical question.
2 familiarized myself with secondary sources, other
3 people have written about, you know, the history
4 of tobacco.
5
6
Q.
I first
And what were those secondary
sources?
7
A.
Oh, well, I know -- I'm going to look
8 at my resource list here to be a little more
9 exact.
10
I know I looked at a book by Iain Gately
which is about the history of tobacco.
11
I looked at some other --
12
Q.
You say you "looked at."
While
13 you're looking through there, Doctor, when you
14 say you "looked at," did you read the entire
15 book?
16
17
A.
Yes.
Yes.
lot more specific.
I'm sorry.
Yes, I read the book.
18 Q.
19 together.
20 understood what you were saying.
21
A.
22
I should be a
That's all right.
We'll work
I just wanted to make sure that I
No, I appreciate the prompt there.
Yes, I read that.
I read Iain
23 Gately's book is called "Tobacco: A Cultural
24 History."
It's on my resource list.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340835
1
I looked at Richard Kluger's "Ashes
2 to Ashes."
I looked at -- I can't find it off
3 the top -- a Sobel book.
4 here.
Give me just a second
5 Q. Sure.
6 A. Robert Sobel, "They Satisfy:
The
7 Cigarette in American Life."
8 good examples of books that I read to, again, to
9 understand the sort of larger context, the larger
10
Those would be some
history of tobacco in this country.
11 Q. Did you read "The Cigarette Century"?
12 A. The Brandt book, yes.
13 Q. How about Doctor Proctor's book, the
14
"Golden Holocaust," did you read that?
15 A. I have not read that.
16 Q. Any particular reason why you have
17
18
19
20
21
not read that?
A.
No, not really.
It's fairly recent.
I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
Q.
And did you read the entirety of "The
Cigarette Century"?
22 A. Yes, I did.
23 Q. Pretty long book, isn't it?
24 A. Yes.
As I recall, it is, yeah.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340836
1
Q.
Let me ask you while we're at it, you
2 referred to your resource list, and counsel for
3 Philip Morris was kind enough to send me a hard
4 drive that I believe has your material, all of
5 your material on it.
6 your file to your knowledge that would not be
7 on -- why don't we just let me get my computer
8 working.
9
10
And is there any part of
You have mentioned your resource
list.
And do you have a copy of that handy?
11 A. Yes, I do.
12 Q. All right.
I would ask that that
13 resource list be marked as Plaintiff's Exhibit
14 Number 1 to your deposition.
15
16
17
(Document marked for
identification as Greenwood Exhibit 1.)
Q.
All right.
Another thing that was on
18 the hard drive, Doctor Greenwood, was marked
19 "Resource Material."
20 folders that have the following:
21 Educational Films, Educational Materials,
22 Florida-Specific," the abbreviation for
23 miscellaneous, "Misc, Movies, National Magazines,
24 News Programs, Newspapers, PHC-Government."
Under that, there were file
"Cartoons,
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-3408
The37
1 letters "PSAs."
2 Another folder, "Statutes & Laws," and the last
3 folder is "TV."
4
5
Another folder, "Songs & Audio."
Did I just go over and cover all of
your resource material for this case?
6 A. Yes.
As far as I know, yes.
7 Q. In addition to your resource list and
8 the resource materials, the other thing on the
9 hard drive that was sent to me was your current
10
curriculum vitae.
11
Are you aware of any other parts of
12 your deposition that are not contained on -- or
13 any other parts of your file that are not
14 contained on the hard drive?
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
MS. DABOLL:
you mean by "file"?
Q.
Object to form.
What do
Can you just clarify that?
I assume you brought with you your
entire file on the Lourie case, did you not?
A.
You mean my research?
My files of
research that you just went over?
Q.
No, ma'am, I'm not talking about your
22 law research files.
23 files -- well, let's just start from the top.
24
I am talking about the
We have marked as Greenwood number 1
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340838
1
your resource list, correct?
2 A. Okay.
3 Q. Correct?
4 A. Yes.
5 Greenwood 1, yes.
6 Q.
Yes, it's my resource list,
Tell me the next thing in whatever
7 order you might have it that you brought with you
8 to the deposition today.
9
A.
I have the list that you just went
10 over, just the list of my files beginning with
11 "Cartoons" and ending with "TV" that you just
12 read through.
13 Q. All right.
14 A. I have my CV.
15 Q. All right.
16 A. I have depositions that I read in
17
18
this case.
Q.
Those would consist of the
19 depositions of James Lourie, the depositions of
20 Steven Lourie, the deposition of Michael Lourie,
21 the deposition of David Lourie.
22 The deposition of Linda Coven.
23 Elaine Berman.
24
Let me think.
The deposition of
Any other depositions?
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340839
1
A.
No, that's the deposition list.
And
2 I should also say in addition to the actual
3 depositions, I have a list of the depositions
4 that you just read, again, for reference purposes
5 to make sure I, you know, remembered all of them
6 that I looked at.
7 Q.
While we're on that subject, Doctor
8 Greenwood, with respect to the copies of the
9 depositions that you have, did you make any marks
10 on or in them?
11 anything of that description?
12
A.
Any writing?
Any notes or
I highlighted certain things in some
13 of the depositions.
Several of the depositions I
14 received electronically and so they were in PDF
15 form, and I marked them with just a little, I
16 guess you call them little bubbles that just,
17 again, highlight particular parts of the
18 depositions.
19 Q. And those were in electronic form?
20 A. Some of them are.
21 Q. Well, since they are highlighted, I
Not all of them.
22 am going to ask that the court reporter mark
23 these depositions for those that are in hard copy
24 form.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340840
1
Why don't we mark them as Exhibit 2
2 and we can then for those in electronic form, do
3 you happen to have a thumb drive or do you
4 already have them copied onto some device, some
5 sort of drive that we could give to the court
6 reporter.
7 A.
I actually have them printed out.
8 Q.
Oh, so you have hard copies of
9 everything, including the ones you received
10 electronically on which you placed a little
11 bubble?
12 bubble?
13
14
15
16
17
And did you type any notes in that
A.
No, I didn't.
But the answer to your
question is, yes, I have everything printed out.
Q.
And when you printed them out, did
you have the little bubbles also printed out?
A.
18
Yes.
MR. CABANISS:
All right.
Well,
19 let's just mark all of the depositions, then, as
20 a composite Exhibit 2.
21 MS. DABOLL:
I'm just clarifying, she
22 hasn't highlighted all of the depositions she ran
23 through.
24 deposition the depositions that she highlighted?
You just want marked as exhibits to the
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340841
1
MR. CABANISS:
Well, if we could go
2 back on the record, please.
3 BY MR. CABANISS:
4 Q.
Doctor Greenwood, would you please
5 tell me what deposition transcripts you did not
6 place any kind of marks in.
7
8
9
10
11
A.
Sure.
That would be David Lourie,
Linda Coven, Elaine Berman, and Steven Lourie.
Q.
Now, why did you not place any marks
in David Lourie's deposition?
A.
I didn't find any information that
12 was particularly relevant to the question that I
13 was asked to answer, draw conclusions about,
14 which was about public awareness.
15
Q.
And would the same answer be true,
16 then, for the other depositions you placed no
17 marks in, that being Linda Coven's, Steven
18 Lourie's, and Elaine Berman?
19
A.
Yes.
And also just to explain a
20 little bit further, I mean sometimes I also
21 didn't make marks because people were replicating
22 information or I had, you know, that information
23 down already and it wasn't anything new based on
24 the previous depositions I read.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340842
1
2
3
So that was the other reason I didn't
necessarily mark them.
Q.
All right.
Did you make any type of
4 a summary or anything of that nature from these
5 depositions concerning what family and friends
6 may have had to say that bears upon your
7 opinions?
8 A.
A written summary, no.
9 Q.
Any other type of summary?
10 A.
Well, I certainly, you know, kept in
11 mind some of the things that they said, you know,
12 attesting to her particular public awareness --
13 or her awareness, again, within this larger realm
14 of public awareness.
15
16
17
Q.
Certainly, but you didn't put it
down, so to speak, on paper?
A.
No.
18 MS. DABOLL:
Ron, can you --
19 MR. CABANISS:
All right.
Madam
20 Court Reporter, we can then mark as a composite
21 exhibit, I'll change it one more time, those
22 depositions in which Doctor Greenwood did place
23 some sort of marks --
24
THE WITNESS:
That would be all of
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340843

them.

MR. CABANISS:
-- and leaving to one
3 side those in which she did not.

We don't need

Doctor Greenwood, what is the next
8 thing that you brought with you to the

A.
Okay.

12 depositions.
So we talked about the
We talked about my list of
13 Q. And your list of resources?
14 A. My resource list.
15 that are on the hard disc.
16 already talked about.
17 through my file here.
18
Q.
Excuse me.
My list of files
I brought my CV we've
I'm sorry, I'm going
While we're at it, let us
19 mark your list of the files that are on the hard
20 drive under your resource material.
21 folders that I went through starting with
22 "Cartoons" ending with "TV," it's my
23 understanding, Doctor Greenwood, you have a list
24 of those folders, correct?
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-3408
The file44

A.
2
3
That's correct.
MR. CABANISS:
please, as Exhibit 3.
4
5
Let us mark that,
(Document marked for
identification as Greenwood Exhibit 3.)
6
Q.
Doctor Greenwood, let me ask you do
7 you have with you at the deposition today any
8 electronic copy of the files contained in the
9 file folder starting with "Cartoons" ending with
10
"TV"?
11
THE WITNESS:
Do we have the hard --
12 I don't know whether we have the hard disc here
13 or not.
14
15
16
17
18
19
MS. DABOLL:
I have a copy of the
hard drive, but you didn't bring one with you.
THE WITNESS:
Yeah, I don't have a
copy of it.
MR. CABANISS:
Let's go off the
record for a second.
20 MS. DABOLL:
21 (Proceedings recessed at 10:10 a.m.,

Let's go45

By agreement of counsel, we're going
2 to reserve a place in the deposition for
3 Exhibit 4.
4 electronic disc or file of some type, or drive,
5 rather, of some type on which will be contained

Exhibit 4 will consist of an

9 Q. And I assume that research in
10 addition to national material that's on your
11 reliance list and in your reliance material would
12 have included material that was from the State of
13 Massachusetts?
14
15
16
A.
I'm sorry.
Could you rephrase that?
I'm not quite sure what the question was.
Q.
17
Yes.
My question is the research that you

23 research?
24 A.
Yes.

3
Q.
And what sort of research did you do
in the month of March?
A.
Well, it included newspaper research
4 into South Middlesex News, The Middlesex News the
5 Newton Tab.
6
It also included looking at -- going
7 up to Newton and looking at the school committee
8 records for the time that Mrs. Lourie was in
9 school.
I think that's -- also finding some
10 textbooks that had been mentioned as being
11 adopted into the Newton Public School system in
12 the relevant time period.

14
Q.
And the total amount of that bill was

4 Q.
Doctor Greenwood, this chart that you

I wrote it

ranges.
You had basically date
I assume these date ranges and
residences prefer to Barbara Lourie, correct?
11 A. That's correct.
12 Q. And then you have Education and
13
Employment, another column, correct?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. And then you have sources.
And the
16 first one, for example, with respect to Newton,
17 Massachusetts, you have Boston Globe,
18 Boston Herald, Massachusetts textbooks, Newton
19 school committee documents, and list of
20 authorized textbooks, correct?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Those would be the sources where
23 there was a discussion of the risk of smoking
24 cigarettes?
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340857
1
A.
Well, more than -- not that
2 specifically.
I mean some of these sources deal
3 with, you know, again, the school committee talks
4 about the textbooks.
5 specifically talk about the risk of smoking
6 cigarettes, but the textbooks themselves
7 authorized by the school committee did.
It doesn't necessarily
8 So there is, you know, the subject
9 matter is in some of these cases is certainly
10
11
more broad than that.
Q.
Do you have any information that
12 Barbara Lourie actually used any of these
13 authorized textbooks?
14
A.
Well, I think, you know, the school
15 committee authorized in this era two textbooks
16 that did match up with her particular time in the
17 Newton Public Schools; one was a fifth grade
18 textbook and another one was one that was used in
19 high school.
20
So certainly they were used in the
21 Newton schools at the time she was in those
22 grades.
23
24
Q.
But do you know whether or not she
actually used those textbooks?
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340858
1
A.
Well, given the fact that those were
2 the textbooks authorized by the school committee,
3 those were the ones that would have been used in
4 the schools when she was there.
5
Q.
But my question, nevertheless, is:
6 Do you have any source of information in any way,
7 shape, or form, that she used those textbooks and
8 that she read the portions of those textbooks
9 dealing with smoking cigarettes?
10
A.
Again, I can't say that she
11 particularly read those textbooks.
12 safe to say, again, that these were used in the
13 Newton schools at the time she was in elementary
14 school and at Newton North High.
15
I think it is
And, again, this is part, you know,
16 part of what I've, you know, concluded is really
17 about public awareness; and it's about, again, I
18 want to stress the information environment that
19 was readily available to anyone, you know, living
20 in this, you know, in this time period.
21 know, the Globe, the Herald, the textbooks, these
22 are all sources, individual sources, that are
23 often conveying the same kind of message.
24
So my point would be that the
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-3408
So, you59
1 information environment for these particular
2 sources that you've referenced was rich with
3 numerous warnings about the dangers of cigarette
4 smoking and the addictive nature of cigarettes.
5
Q.
Would you agree that I have given you
6 in your deposition so far ample opportunity to
7 state your opinion and the basis for your
8 opinion?
9 A. Have you given me ample opportunity?
10 Q. Yes, ma'am.
11
12
13
MS. DABOLL:
Object to the form of
the question.
A.
I'm not sure what you're asking.
14 Could you maybe -- Mr. Cabaniss, maybe could you
15 restate that?
16
17
Q.
Certainly.
I'd be happy to.
I am asking a specific question, and
18 let me see if I can ask it in a different manner
19 so that I can get a specific answer to my
20 specific question.
21
You do not possess any information
22 that Barbara Lourie actually used, read, any
23 portions of a textbook --
24
MS. DABOLL:
Object to form.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340860
1
Q.
-- in the public schools in Newton,
2 Massachusetts, that discussed smoking and health;
3 that's true, is it not?
4
5
A.
Okay, let me break that down because
I think you asked me a couple of questions there.
6
First of all, as I said, I cannot
7 tell you whether Barbara Lourie read the
8 textbooks.
9
10
11
12
Q.
I can tell you --
That is, is it not, the specific
answer to my specific question?
A.
Well, there were two parts to your
question, as I understood it, if I may continue.
13
So I think I've answered one part of
14 it which is I do not know whether -- I have no
15 evidence that she read it.
16
The second part was about the
17 textbooks used in the Newton school system, as I
18 understand it, was the second part of your
19 question.
20
And, again, I read the school
21 committee documents.
Traced very carefully when
22 the school committee adopted particular texts,
23 when they would have been used, and I feel
24 confident in saying that I know which textbooks
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340861
1 were used at the time she was in elementary
2 school and the time that she was at Newton North
3 High School.
4
But, again, if I may -- may I
5 continue?
6 Q.
7
8
9
10
11
Well, if you aren't finished yet, by
all means.
A.
Thank you.
Again, I just want to emphasize this
is one source of information.
My conclusion would be that Barbara
12 Lourie -- the public awareness, the information
13 environment was so rich at this time in the late
14 '50s in Massachusetts -- in the United States in
15 general and Massachusetts in particular in a very
16 highly educated affluent suburb like Newton,
17 Massachusetts, that was full of doctors and
18 public health people, that awareness, public
19 awareness, was not dependent upon reading one
20 particular textbook.
21 other sources of information out there; whether
22 it was coming from the American Cancer Society,
23 whether it was in Senior Scholastic, as I talked
24 about before, that news magazine.
That there were so many

2 studies were all --
3
Q.
Doctor Greenwood, Doctor Greenwood,
4 are you about to go on for another three pages
5 restating your opinions which I already gave you
6 ample opportunity to state a long time ago?
7
MS. DABOLL:
Brian, she's got to be
8 allowed to answer the question and you've got to
9 let her finish her answer.
10
MR. CABANISS:
Well, you know what,
11 Bonnie, you know what, I've been doing this a
12 long, long time.
13 intend to get specific answers to specific
14 questions.
15 deposition will be adjourned.
I ask specific questions and I
And if I don't get them, this
16 MS. DABOLL:
Well, like I said --
17 MR. CABANISS:
But we will resume the
18 deposition after we go in front of Judge Levens
19 and discuss this.
20
MS. DABOLL:
That's your prerogative.
21 What I'm saying is Doctor Greenwood is answering
22 the question and you just need to let her finish.
23
24
MR. CABANISS:
If it continues, if it
happens one more time, I am going to do that.

MS. DABOLL:

your prerogative, but I'm just saying --
3 MR. CABANISS:
4 MS. DABOLL:
Thank you.
-- I don't think her
5 answering the question to the extent that she
6 thinks she needs to answer it, there is anything
7 inappropriate with that.
8 BY MR. CABANISS:
9 Q.
Doctor Greenwood, is it your
10 intention, ma'am, in response to specific
11 questions that I have to continuously go beyond
12 those questions and simply restate over and over
13 again what your opinion is as opposed to giving
14 me a simple straight answer to a simple straight
15 question?
16
17
18
MS. DABOLL:
Object to the form of
that question.
A.
With all due respect, Mr. Cabaniss, I
19 understood there were two parts to your question,
20 and I answered the first part.
21 court reporter could probably go back and point,
22 you know, verify that I said that I didn't know
23 if she had read it.
24 to your question which is about the use of the

Not that it was a

Q.

11 read that textbook that you refer to in your
12 chart, do you?
13 A. No, I do not.
14 Q. You don't know whether Barbara Lourie
15 read any of the articles in the Boston Globe that
16 you referred to in your chart between 1940 to
17 1967, do you?
18
19
20
A.
No, I do not.
But I do know that she
read the Boston Globe.
Q.
You do not know, you do not know
21 whether Barbara Lourie read any of the articles

Q.
Going down to the University of

10 smoking and health or the addictive nature of
11 cigarettes, if there were any in there, in

1
don't.
You and I both know it, Bonnie.
2
MS. DABOLL:
I don't think that's
3 right.
I think that's a pretty broad question
4 whether she has any evidence, and she's answering
5 that question.
6
So, you know --
MR. CABANISS:
Well, do you want me
7 to ask the question differently?
8 BY MR. CABANISS:
9 Q.
Let me ask it this way, Doctor
10 Greenwood.
11 that Barbara Lourie read any articles in the
12 Beacon, do you?
13
You don't have any direct evidence
MS. DABOLL:
Object to the form.
14 A. No, I do not.
15 Q. Moving down, then, to the next part
16 of your chart from 1967 to 1968, you have Dedham,
17 Massachusetts.
18
19
Where is Dedham, D-e-d-h-a-m,
Massachusetts?
20 A. It's a suburb south of Boston.
21 Q. You had two sources there.
And let
22 me see if I can move through this a little more
23 quickly.
24 '68.
One is the Boston Globe from 1967 to
One is the Boston Herald from 1967 to '68.

888 811-340867
1 And, again, you have no direct evidence that
2 Barbara Lourie read anything in either of those
3 two papers dealing with smoking cigarettes,
4 correct?
5
MS. DABOLL:
Object to the form.
6 A. No, I do not.
7 Q. Moving on down to Framingham 1968 to
8 1973, you have four sources; the Boston Globe,
9 the Boston Herald, The Framingham News and South
10
Middlesex News, correct?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. You don't have any direct evidence
13 that Barbara Lourie read anything in any of those
14 papers, do you?
15 A.
No, I don't.
16 Q.
Then we have 1973 to 1994 and
17 sources; Boston Globe, Boston Herald, Natick Tab,
18 South Middlesex News, Middlesex News.
19 question again is:
20 evidence she read anything about smoking
21 cigarettes in those papers, do you?
22
A.
And the
You don't have any direct
Well, if I may, the family
23 depositions said that she was a voracious reader
24 and was very well aware, as her husband always
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340868
1 said, she knew the issues.
2 these newspapers in their home.
3
Q.
And they received
Do you have any other direct evidence
4 that she read any particular article from any of
5 those five papers?
6 A. No, I don't.
7 Q. And we get to the Tampa Tribune 1994
8 to 1997.
9 evidence that Barbara Lourie read any particular
10
Again, you don't have any direct
article in the Tampa Tribune, do you?
11 A. No, I don't.
12 Q. And then your last source Florida
13 Cancer News 1994 to 1989, and Hotline from 1975
14 to 1976, you don't have any direct evidence that
15 Barbara Lourie read Florida Cancer News, do you?
16
17
A.
No, but that wasn't necessarily the
point of that research.
18 Q.
19 Hotline, correct?
The same would be true for the
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. Then the Florida Health Notes 1970 to
22 1976, you have no direct evidence that Barbara
23 Lourie ever looked at the Florida Health Notes,
24 do you?
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340869
1 A. No.
2 Q. Florida Public Health Advisor 1984 to
3 1992, again, no direct evidence that she ever
4 looked at that, correct?
5
MS. DABOLL:
Object to the form.
6 A. I have no direct evidence.
7 Q. You have Comprehensive Cancer Center
8
9
10
11
for Florida.
A.
That's a place, right?
Yes, it is.
And I think also there
was a publication that came out of that.
Q.
And you have no direct knowledge that
12 Barbara Lourie ever saw any of those
13 publications, correct?
14 A. Correct.
15 Q. The Wolfson Collection, pre-1985.
16 Again, no evidence, direct evidence, that Barbara
17 Lourie ever looked at any of that, correct?
18 A. That's right.
19 Q. And finally, ACS, standing for the
20 American Cancer Society annual report for Florida
21 Division 1973 to 1974, you have no evidence
22 Barbara Lourie ever looked at any of those
23 reports, correct?
24
A.
Yes.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340870
1
Q.
It's true, is it not, that Barbara
2 Lourie wasn't even in Florida in 1973 to 1974,
3 was she?
4 A. That's true.
5 Q. I just asked you whether she was
6
there.
7
8
But if I may --
MS. DABOLL:
interrupt her, okay?
9
Ron, she -- don't
If you have a specific --
MR. CABANISS:
If you want to ask --
10 if you want to ask follow-up questions, Bonnie,
11 you certainly have that right.
12
MS. DABOLL:
She answered your
13 question, but she's allowed to explain it if she
14 feels that it's necessary.
15
16
MR. CABANISS:
Well, it's necessary
if it's in response to the question, I agree.
17
MS. DABOLL:
That's what I'm saying.
18 If she feels like she's responding to your
19 question, then you need to let her respond.
20 BY MR. CABANISS:
21 Q.
22
23
24
Go ahead and respond, Doctor
Greenwood.
A.
Thanks.
Again, the reason I looked at those
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340871
1 things, the particular sources before she was in
2 Florida, this is what social historians do.
3 was the way I collected evidence to be able to
4 draw conclusions about, again, the context of
5 various kinds of actions and activities in
6 Florida.
7
Q.
This
So that's all I wanted to say.
Okay.
Context is important.
In
8 other words, for a historian to do a historian's
9 work, they have to put things in the total
10 context that existed at the time period they are
11 researching and studying, correct?
12 A. Yes.
I think that's fair, uh-huh.
13 Q. You had mentioned earlier with
14 respect to the 1950s there were all sorts of
15 things that came out with respect to the risk of
16 smoking.
Do you recall saying that?
17 A. Yes, I do.
18 Q. Well, tell us about all of the things
19 that came out that stood for the proposition that
20 there wasn't that risk with respect to smoking
21 cigarettes.
22
23
24
MS. DABOLL:
A.
Object to the form.
Well, there certainly was in the
early 1950s especially a lot of debate over --
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340872
1 among scientists.
Certainly you see in some of
2 the early articles about whether this very, you
3 know, massive increase in lung cancer.
4 evidence by the 1940s and early 1950s was the
5 direct result of cigarettes or whether there were
6 other factors.
7 air pollution as a factor.
8 whether somebody lived in the country versus the
9 city.
There was
I mean people talked a lot about
They talked about
Things like that.
10
So there certainly is debate among
11 scientists at this time about, you know, a direct
12 link between cigarette smoking -- or if that is
13 the key factor in this massive increase in lung
14 cancer.
15 a discussion that takes place at this time and
16 the sense that, you know, despite some of the
17 early studies, that it was still an open
18 question.
19 certainly with research that's done by Doctors
20 Hammond and Horn where they factor in those kinds
21 of issues.
That would be one example of, you know,
22
23
24
And some of those get resolved
Again, that's one example.
Q.
Well, do you have any other examples,
or was anybody else besides scientists debating
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340873
1
2
the issue?
A.
Yes.
There were -- there were
3 certainly the tobacco industry itself as a trade
4 group, you know, questioned some of the early
5 findings, again, saying that there was a lot more
6 research that needed to be done.
7
8
9
Q.
What was the name of the tobacco
industry group that questioned it?
A.
The first, among other things, the
10 first -- the name of the first organization was
11 the TIRC, Tobacco Institute Research Council, I
12 believe the C is for.
13 Q.
14 industry group?
15 A.
All right.
Yes.
It was organized in 1954.
Was there another
The TIRC ends up dividing into
16 a research group I think called -- if I remember
17 my abbreviations -- Committee for Tobacco
18 Research I believe is the CTR, and then -- which
19 was the research wing.
20 Institute which was sort of the trade
21 organization for the tobacco industry.
22
23
24
Q.
And then the Tobacco
What do you mean by "trade
organization"?
A.
To my understanding, it was an
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340874
1 organization of all the tobacco manufacturers.
2 So, you know, they have spokespeople for that
3 particular industry.
4
Q.
Did either of these tobacco industry
5 groups make any kind of public statements whether
6 orally or in writing concerning their beliefs
7 with respect to the risk of smoking cigarettes?
8 A.
9 in my research.
10 Q.
11
12
Yes.
And I certainly included them
So, yes, they did.
So those are reflected where in the
material that you have?
A.
Several places.
Certainly in the
13 newspapers, the magazine articles that I
14 collected, television reports through the years.
15 That's mostly -- that's where their voice shows
16 up in, you know, the public -- to the public and
17 the information environment that the public has
18 access to.
19
Q.
All right.
How long did the industry
20 groups continue to debate the relationship of
21 smoking cigarettes to health?
22
MS. DABOLL:
23 A.
24 them debating it.
Object to form.
Again, I guess I'm -- you talk about
Could you just clarify a bit?
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340875
1 I'm not quite sure what you mean by "debate."
2 just want to make sure we're on the same page.
3
Q.
Well, it's true, is it not, that the
4 tobacco industry groups disputed or questioned
5 whether smoking cigarettes caused health risks
6 such as lung cancer, correct?
7
A.
I
Yes, they do.
And lots of times they
8 argue, again, that it's sort of an open question.
9 More research needs to be done.
10 Q. How long did that continue that?
11 A. Well, they -- I think it's in the
12 1990s where, at least Philip Morris for sure and
13 I think that Reynolds was a little bit later,
14 did, you know, acknowledge the risks of smoking,
15 the health risks of smoking.
16 Q. You say that was in the 1990s?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. When in the 1990s?
19 A. Well, Philip Morris I think was '96
20 or '98 -- I have to go back and look exactly --
21 and I think R.J. Reynolds was a few years after
22 that.
23 Q.
24 with lung cancer?
When was Barbara Lourie diagnosed
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340876
1 A. I believe around 1994.
2 Q. It's true, is it not, that Philip
3 Morris, who you were just speaking of, then
4 continued with their debate as to whether or not
5 smoking caused lung cancer until a point in time
6 after Barbara Lourie already had lung cancer,
7 correct?
8
9
MS. DABOLL:
A.
Object to form.
Again, I -- they come out publicly,
10 as I said, in the mid to late '90s and talk about
11 the health risks of smoking after she was
12 diagnosed.
13
14
15
But, again, if I may, and I really
feel like I need --
Q.
No, you do if you want to just
16 continue with your opinions.
17 asked a simple question.
And, you know, I
18 A. And I think --
19 Q. You said they did until they came out
20 and acknowledged it in the mid to late '80s,
21 before -- 22 A. No, I didn't say '80s.
23 Q. -- before I believe you said 1996 or
24
1998, did you not?
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340877
1
A.
No, I think you misunderstood me.
2 said the '90s both times.
3 record.
4
Q.
I
We could check the
So it's your testimony that the
5 Philip Morris, USA, Inc., publicly acknowledged
6 that smoking cigarettes could cause lung cancer
7 in some individuals by what date?
8
9
10
A.
I said, as I've said I think several
times now, the late 1990s.
Q.
So you said, I believe, that based on
11 your information from I guess reading the
12 verified answers to the worksheet and the
13 depositions that Barbara Lourie was diagnosed
14 with lung cancer in 1994, correct?
15 A. Yes, that's my recollection.
16 Q. So it would be, then, your
17 understanding that Philip Morris did not publicly
18 acknowledge that smoking could cause lung cancer
19 in some people until after Barbara Lourie was
20 diagnosed with lung cancer, correct?
21
MS. DABOLL:
Object to form.
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. And you just said '98 I believe, did
24
It was after she was diagnosed.
you not?
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340878
1 A. I said '98?
2 Q. You said '98 was when they publicly
3
I'm sorry?
acknowledged that, correct?
4 A. It was in the late 1990s, yes.
5 Q. So even if Barbara Lourie was
6 diagnosed with lung cancer in 1996, Philip Morris
7 would still have acknowledged that smoking can
8 cause lung cancer in some people after she was
9 diagnosed with lung cancer, correct?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. And if in fact Barbara Lourie passed
12 away on September 16, 1997, it wasn't until after
13 she died that Philip Morris, USA, Inc., publicly
14 acknowledged that smoking cigarettes could cause
15 lung cancer in some people, correct?
16 A. That's correct.
17 Q. How about R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
18 Company, do you know when they publicly
19 acknowledged that smoking cigarettes could cause
20 some people to develop lung cancer?
21
A.
As I recall, I believe, as I've said
22 already, a couple of years after Philip Morris.
23 So around 2000.
24 Q.
So R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-340879
1 would not have publicly admitted that smoking
2 cigarettes could cause some people to develop
3 lung cancer until not only after Barbara Lourie
4 had been diagnosed with lung cancer but also
5 after she had died from lung cancer, correct?
6
MS. DABOLL:
Object to form.
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. How about Lorillard Tobacco Company?
9
10
MR. BROCK:
Q.

When did they publicly admit that
11 smoking cigarettes could cause some people to
12 develop lung cancer?

A.

17 time period.

19
20
Q.
Do you plan on doing any additional
work in this case, Doctor Greenwood?
A.
I don't, but I guess I would just
21 say, you know, if something new, you know, I came
22 across a source that I felt was relevant, I would
23 ask that that be, you know, admitted; but I don't
24 plan to at this point.

13 MR. BROCK: No questions.
14 MR. HATCH: No questions.
15 MS. DABOLL:
I do want to say before
16 we go off the record I now have a physical copy
17 of what we'll mark as Greenwood Exhibit 4 which
18 is the hard drive of Doctor Greenwood's resource
19 materials.
20 a copy of that.
21
I'm going to give the court reporter

8 there on the notice there somewhere, Laurie
9 Briggs.
And
Send her the bill.

MS. DABOLL:

11 all Defendants we have a standing order with
12 Veritext.

We don't need it
I'll just join in what
Bonnie said.
MR. BROCK:
