EXAMINATION (resumed)
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Good morning, Dr. English.
A. Good morning.
Q. Are there any changes or additions you want to make to your testimony yesterday?
A. Not that I can think of.
Q. Okay. I was reviewing the rough transcript, and I realized that I left out an adjective in one of my first questions. I had asked if cigarette smoking was the principal cause of death and illness in the United States, and I think you answered it was, and I meant to put in — I meant to put in the adjective "preventible." It's the principal cause of — I, mean all those deaths are preventible, if people just didn't smoke, right?
A. Well, for example, in heart disease, there
are eight risk factors. Cigarette smoking is one of those. So let's say every person who eventually died of a heart attack stopped smoking, they still might die of a heart attack because of the other risk factors. So that has to do with how these deaths are apportioned using the attributable risk formula that the CDC came up with, but — so that, I'd have to qualify that statement in that fashion.
Q. But certainly, if everyone in the United States who smokes today stopped smoking, there would be a very substantial decrease in death from smoking.
A. Yes, I would think so.
Q. Now, I noticed in your report you, I think, unvaryingly used the phrase, smokers who "would not" quit, and never once used smokers who "could not" quit. And I wanted to ask you about that.
Many smokers, it's not a question of choice; they are addicted and they tried multiple times to quit and they just can't, right?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, when I — when you look at what the Surgeon General talks about, people who quit, there is really — there seems to be a spectrum of analysis there. I mean, they often talk
about 50 million people who have quit, and many of those, in fact I think the majority of those 50 million, do so without any particular kind of aid.
They just decide they are going to quit.
And then I think there are other, you know, there are other comments in the Surgeon General's reports about people who try and fail. So I think —
I think there is a spectrum of smokers who want to quit and have — have difficulty and some just do it. BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Well, you don't mean to suggest, do you, by the phrase, smokers who would not quit, that it’s just a voluntary choice for all or even a majority of smokers; they just want to keep on smoking. Are you aware of surveys that the majority of smokers would like to stop smoking?
MR. ROSENTHAL: There are two questions
there.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Are you aware of the fact that there are a majority -- there is a lot of surveys that the majority of smokers in the United States would like to stop smoking?
A. I am aware of those surveys. I think the
Surgeon General has reported on those on a number of occasions.
Q. Okay. And then we also had some examination on some testimony you originally gave in the Miles case that the tobacco companies in your view were admirable companies, and we looked at the transcript, and the reason they were admirable, according to your testimony in 2002, was because they sold legal products. And you had kind of misremembered the context in which you had -- you had testified that tobacco companies were admirable companies, and I realized I should have followed up.
Is it your view today that Philip Morris and other tobacco companies are admirable companies?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form and mischaracterization of the prior testimony.
THE WITNESS: Right, I don't think I said it quite the way you did. I think the context in 2002, I believe it was, was this was a deposition on low-tar cigarettes, and I had that on my mind in responding to that question, but the question that you just asked me about now is, you know, I really am not in a position to make that kind of judgment in the sense that I haven't studied Philip Morris in its entirety. I'm
not even sure I would know how to do that in its entirety.
Do I think that they cooperated with the public health community when they produced low-tar cigarettes? Yes, I do, and I think that's admirable from that point of view, but that's really the extent of my thoughts on that.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. What you referring to, Dr. English, when you say they cooperated with the public health community in low-tar cigarettes?
A. Well, the public health community, beginning with the technical report that I mentioned, wanted to encourage tobacco companies to produce lower-tar cigarettes. The Surgeon General picked that -- picked that up. In fact the whole purpose of the tobacco working group, that cooperative venture, in the 1960' s and 1970's, was to try to engineer a safer cigarette, which they concluded would be a lower-tar cigarette.
And so the public health community wanted manufacturers to produce lower-tar cigarettes.
Q. The view that Philip Morris cooperated with the public health community to produce a lower, lowered tar and nicotine cigarette is a topic you do
not have any expert opinions on because you have no clue why Philip Morris launched Light cigarettes, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I have not studied Philip Morris. I don't know why they produce low-tar cigarettes. My view is sort of looking at the outside is, you know, that public health community wanted them to do it, it happened, and that's what the — that's the extent of my knowledge.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Right. But actually if you would go on to tobaccodocuments.org you would have found that your nonexpert view is profoundly ahistorical.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Is that a question or a
statement ?
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Well, let's explore it. Philip Morris knew and took advantage of the fact that, following the early reports in the 1950's and the Surgeon General's Report in 1964, that smokers were concerned about the health risk of smoking. Are you aware of that?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
Morris's documents, so I don't know what they were aware of or what they were not aware of.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. And so Philip Morris knew that lowered tar and nicotine signaled to smokers it's better for you. Are you aware of that?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Same answer. I haven't studied Philip Morris's documents on that, so I'm not able to have an opinion.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Are you aware that Philip Morris advocated continued use of the FTC Method for the purpose that it would continue to understate smokers' actual intake of tar and nicotine?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Are you aware of that?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Same objection.
THE WITNESS: I haven't studied Philip Morris's views on that, so I'm not able to give you an expert opinion.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Okay. Now, we also discussed yesterday
somewhat about how you framed -- well, about the importance of framing a historical inquiry and how you went about framing your historical inquiry in this case. And I think it would be fair to say that in this case that your historical -- the historical inquiry you would research in answer was identified for you by Philip Morris's lawyers, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: The broad outlines, yes, that I was asked to look at what the scientific and public health community knew about the risks of smoking and what they recommended about -- to lessen those risks. BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Okay. Good. Now, you've testified for Philip Morris on almost probably 20 times in 20 cases, and so you have a good deal of experience working with the Philip Morris lawyers, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form and characterization of his testimony.
THE WITNESS: I'm not sure how many depositions I've had, but I have some familiarity with working with their attorneys -- with attorneys.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Right. And so if the Philip Morris lawyers
had said, Dr. English, there's a view — there's a claim in this -- strike that. Let me ask you.
Do you know what Plaintiffs — I understand you're a medical historian and pediatrician and not a lawyer, and so I'm not asking you as a lawyer, but as an expert witness who has been retained in this case, do you have an understanding about what Plaintiffs claim Philip Morris did wrong in this case?
A. Only in a general sense, not any specific
sense.
Q. And what is that general sense?
A. Generally that they marketed cigarettes in a way that was — that -- in a fashion that misled the public.
Q. Okay. And it misled -- and do you understand the claim is that Philip Morris knew, based on consumer research, that consumers had a general feeling and particularly health-conscious consumers, that lowered tar and nicotine meant better for you?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. But Philip Morris knew, in fact, for many years that Marlboro Lights were as risky or more risky from a health perspective than Marlboro Reds? You
could have researched that claim, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form, compound.
THE WITNESS: If I understand all of the question is, that was not my task. I assume that there would be others that would be -- are going to -are addressing that particular set of problems. It's just simply not something that I did. And, further,
I'm not sure I have the expertise to do it.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Well, let's explore that.
A. In the sense that, you know, corporations are huge entities. I mean, there are business historians who are trained in that. I'm a medical historian and public health historian. I'm not a business historian. So I don't think I would even have the tools to evaluate that.
Q. Well, you could have -- you could have said, what did Philip Morris believe about consumer behavior and what did it know about compensation and addiction versus what the public health community knew about those topics. You could have done that comparison.
A. No, I don't think I could have, and -- but whether I could have trained myself in that way is, I
think, doesn't get to the heart of the issue, that that is simply not something that I did.
Q. Okay. Are you concerned that the jury could really misunderstand your testimony in the following way:
You've testified 20 minutes ago, 10 minutes ago, that Philip Morris acted in an admirable way by cooperating with the public health community in producing a lowered tar and nicotine cigarette, but you in fact have no idea why Philip Morris developed and marketed Marlboro Lights. Isn't there -- aren't you concerned that the jury is really going to misunderstand and think your testimony means that Dr. English is saying that Philip Morris developed and marketed Marlboro Lights because it was cooperating with the public health community?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I think in response to a follow-up question, what I said was the public health community wanted them to produce them. Tobacco companies did produce them. I don't know why they did it. So now the issue of what the jury — how they process information from a lot of witnesses and from the attorneys representing each side, I don't -- I
don't know how they do that.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Let me ask it somewhat differently. It would be wrong for the jury to interpret your testimony to mean you know anything about why Philip Morris developed and marketed Marlboro Lights, correct?
A. I don't know why they did that.
Q. Okay. And it would be wrong for the jury to interpret your testimony to mean that Philip Morris did not mislead the public health community or the FTC because you haven't studied that topic either other than ad hoc documents that Plaintiffs' lawyers have shown you, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I haven't done a systematic study of that. In all the documents that I have been shown I haven't seen a document that I thought would fit into that category. I'm happy to look at any document that you want to show me or either now or at trial, but I simply have not seen that kind of evidence.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Now, your testimony is that the FTC and the
public health community knew about the possibility of compensation and there was some linking of the possibility of compensation with the smoker maintaining nicotine levels. Do you know if Philip Morris had additional and material information about those topics?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form and characterization.
THE WITNESS: A couple of things. I wanted to be stronger with the view about compensation than your question implied in the sense that — I think I tried to explain this yesterday -- was that the reason smokers compensate the public health community believed in the 1970's was because of nicotine. I have not seen any other explanation in the public health community about why cigarette smokers would change their smoking behavior in response to a low-tar cigarette other than nicotine.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Okay.
A. So —
MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him finish.
MR. SURPRENANT: I'm sorry.
THE WITNESS: So I think it's stronger than
your question implies. Now, the question is do I think Philip Morris had some -- had information that was materially — was it superior, is that -BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Materially different and -A. Materially -- I have not seen a document like that. I have seen a lot of documents, especially in the Miles-Price case, but I have not seen a document that would fall into that category.
Q. Well, and then I take it the FTC and the public -- the FTC and the public health community knew that FTC measurements might not track how smokers actually smoked and the tar and nicotine they would get, correct?
A. They definitely knew that. They knew that from the beginning. In fact, the FTC Method doesn't even attempt to measure a smoker, an average smoker.
I mean, FTC has been very clear about it. It's the machine drive number that is useful in terms of comparison.
Q. Okay. Did the FTC and the public health community know that the FTC measurements were affirmatively misleading for two reasons: That a smoker would smoke to get the same nicotine level and
consumers understood lowered tar and nicotine to mean safer?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: When you talk about deceive, I don't believe that the FTC ever thought it was deceiving anybody, but, you know, I certainly have not seen that. What were the other components of your question?
MR. SURPRENANT: Miss Reporter, would you go
back?
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. My question was, did the FTC and the public health community know that the FTC measurements were affirmatively misleading for two reasons: That the measurements as an actual matter would substantially understate the amount of nicotine smokers as a general matter actually got, they would get the same amount in most cases or comparable amounts because they were addicted to nicotine, and consumers, however, misunderstood lowered tar and nicotine to mean less risky?
MR. ROSENTHAL: That's, A, not the question you asked before, but you're obviously entitled to ask a new question, and I object to form.
MR. SURPRENANT: I added an element.
MR. ROSENTHAL: At least one.
THE WITNESS: Let's go, you know, what did the FTC say about compensation. They knew that it is possible for some smokers to compensate, so I think your question implied that they knew that all cigarette smokers would get more of something than — more tar in smoking a low-tar cigarette -BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. I'm listening, Dr. English. Just trying --
VIDEOGRAPHER: It's underneath the table.
MR. SURPRENANT: Please continue. I'm
sorry.
THE WITNESS: -- than a high-tar smoker.
Secondly, the question is about deception of the public. I don't know what the American public perceived of the FTC Method. You asked whether the FTC deceived the public. You know, I certainly don't know the intent of the FTC nor do I know that the public was actually deceived. So I don't have a way of answering that, the final part of your question.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Okay. The reason I got the board out, and I appreciate your putting up with my rearranging
things while you were answering —
First of all, Dr. English, I'm not suggesting that the FTC and the public health community meant to deceive anyone, but they were manipulated by the tobacco industry. So just to be clear, I am not suggesting that the FTC knew what Philip Morris and the tobacco industry knew. I think in fact they didn't. Okay. But there is three aspects that I want to focus on — four. Okay. I'll put a title on this.
What exhibit number are we on? Lucky 13.
(Exhibit No. 13 marked for identification and attached hereto.)
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Dr. English, it reads: Did the PHC, public health community, FTC know:
A) generally smokers would smoke Light cigarettes to get the same amount of nicotine.
A) was driven by addiction — it goes like this. Small (a), generally smokers would smoke Light cigarettes to get the same amount of nicotine.
A. Should we just stop there --Q. I want to put the whole thing on the record and then we'll go on.
A. Oh, okay.
Q. B. A) was driven by nicotine — by nicotine addiction;
C.	Consumers understood lowered tar and nicotine to mean better for you;
D.	PM, Philip Morris, knew C was false;
E.	Philip Morris advocated continued use of the FTC Method because it misled smokers, and it's not on the chart, but it led smokers to believing that Marlboro Lights were less risky when in fact they were just as risky and Philip Morris knew it.
Okay. Now, which of those do you claim that the public health community and the FTC know? And then I'm going to ask if you can identify a single document for me that shows the public health community understood this.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Okay. What the public health community understood was that some smokers could smoke a Light cigarette and get the same amount as a higher tar cigarette. And I said "light" and I shouldn't. A low-tar cigarette because "light" is not a public health term.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. I'll change "Light" to lowered tar and -lowered tar and nicotine.
A. In other words, they knew that it was -that it was possible and some did. If you want to have an example of that, I think the Surgeon General Julius Richmond's preface to the 1979 Surgeon General's Report is pretty emphatic about that, that it was a possibility for some smokers. I don't think that they believed that was the case in every smoker. And the reason for that is, of course, that we've been focusing on compensation, but the other piece of -the huge area of scientific knowledge that the public health community was relying on in making low-tar recommendations as a third-tier recommendation was the epidemiological evidence, which in this period dramatically showed that smokers of lower tar and nicotine cigarettes had less risk.
So I don't agree with A because I don't generally -- to me would mean like all smokers or most smokers. I think it's my — my understanding of what the public health community was saying was that they understood that some smokers could, but, you know, because of the epidemiology they would not think that all smokers did that.
Q. Okay. So let's spend some time on this. I think this is helpful. What I wrote -- obviously what Plaintiffs' position is Philip Morris knew A, B, C, D and E as documents available on documentstobacco.org show and the public health community didn't know it. And you made a crucial difference, Dr. English, in the verb. The verb is "would," generally would.
Generally smokers would smoke lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes to get the same amount of nicotine. You used some smokers could smoke, a possibility for some smokers.
So if Philip Morris internally in sum or substance determined in the 1970's that generally smokers would smoke lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes to get the same amount of nicotine, that would be something different than the public health community understood, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Let me — first of all, I object to the preface. I object to the form of the question. I'd always like to point out for the record that the preceding question -- and this is the problem with multi-part questions — was essentially asking Dr. English to respond to all five. Dr. English started an answer on the first of the five things on
the chart. Dr. English has not had an opportunity to answer any -- express any views of B, C, D and E.
MR. SURPRENANT: I'm going to provide him. We're going through these one at a time.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Okay. I want to make clear he has not completely answered.
MR. SURPRENANT: Absolutely. Absolutely. Believe me, I want to get through all of them.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. So let me just ask the question. So if Philip Morris understood internally in the 1970 's generally smokers would smoke lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes to get the same amount of nicotine, that was something different and importantly different than what the public health community understood, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form, vague.
THE WITNESS: You know, I would have -- as you know, I haven't done a systematic search of what Philip Morris knew, and, of course, that's a very vague comment in itself. Because is it a scientist at Philip Morris? Is it someone else in a corporate -- I mean, I don't -- that's a hard question to answer, but I haven't done that. I haven't seen documents that would indicate that they were in the position to say
that all smokers would smoke, but I -- but, beyond that, I can't go.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Well, let me try to get a direct answer.
My question, which I think the answer is yes, is, assuming Philip Morris -- and when you say you don't know what Philip Morris means -- if -- Philip Morris is a corporation, correct?
A. I assume. I didn't know whether that was how you were using the term.
Q. Right. And so Philip Morris is responsible for the knowledge of its agents including its scientists and its executives. So that's how I'm using Philip Morris.
A. Okay. I don't know that, and that may be some kind of legal sense. I do know, as a practical matter, for example, Duke University is a corporation.
I don't think that the president of Duke University feels himself responsible for the thoughts of every member of the faculty.
So I don't know -- that's one of the reasons I would have difficulty doing research in corporate history is because the nature of the -- of some of the legal aspects of it that I don't understand.
MR. ROSENTHAL: And I object to the incorrect characterization in my view of agency law.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Well, let me see if I can get my arms around this. Yesterday you and I had a number of exchanges on how it is that you, as a medical historian, could say something about what an amorphous and large community as the public health community understood, and you stuck by your guns and you said, nope, as a medical historian, I can reach expert conclusions on what the public health community understood, but now you're having trouble understanding what a much more discrete and legally distinct entity, Philip Morris, understood. Isn't that something of a contradiction, Dr. English?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form and characterization.
THE WITNESS: None whatsoever. One is, I think I can make comments about the public health community because I've studied that. I've studied, you know, all the Surgeon General's reports. I've studied hundreds of scientific articles. I know what the American Cancer Society has said and the Heart Association, Lung Association and countless other
organizations have said.
So, you know -- and they give explanations of their positions, and so I feel very comfortable in saying what the public health community knew, I mean -- and, of course, I think we covered this briefly yesterday. It doesn't mean everyone is on the precise same page on this, but I do — I feel very comfortable about that. I have not done research on Philip Morris, and for me to make a comment about that is, you know, I simply can’t make any kind of generalization.
Now, what I have done, and we talked about this yesterday as well, is that occasionally there have been claims that a particular document represents knowledge which was superior, that was meaningful, and it would have had some significant impact on the public health community, and I’ve been shown those documents and asked for my opinion about that. And I suspect that that may happen in this case as well.
And I'll do the best I can to respond on that.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Okay.
A. In other words, I don't think I have to know everything about Philip Morris to be able to say how a
particular document, how that -- how the public health community might have looked upon that particular document.
Q. Many things to follow up there. You can testify as an expert what the public health community understood because you've extensively studied that issue, but you can’t say what Philip Morris understood because you have intentionally not studied that issue, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
THE WITNESS: I have not studied the issue of that, and, again, other than the proviso that I have been shown documents, but you are correct that I have not made an extensive systematic study of Philip Morris documents.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Okay. So let’s go back to my question. If Philip Morris scientists and executives charged with these tasks concluded, not that some smokers could smoke or there was a possibility some smokers could smoke to compensate and get the same nicotine levels, but rather concluded and reported internally at Philip Morris that generally smokers would smoke lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes to get the same amount of
nicotine, that is something different than what the public health community knew, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form, vague.
THE WITNESS: Well, the only way I could respond to that would be actually to look at the document and to see, and then I would be able to make some kind of comment about how this document might relate to what the public health community's understanding was.
Without the document that you may be referring to, you know -- and there are lots of things about a document -- is it based on a study? Is it a scientific study or a series of studies that would compare to the kinds of studies that were available in the scientific and public health communities? Is this just a general off-the-cuff comment that someone is making? Would that have made any difference to the public health community? You know, without the actual evidence there, I simply can't make a characterization about what Philip Morris knew or did not know.
MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. Objection, move to strike, nonresponsive.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I oppose the —
strike Dr. English as an expert testimony -- as an expert witness -- if he continues to refuse to answer hypothetical questions.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Dr. English, I am asking you a hypothetical question. You were to assume it is true and answer it.
If Philip Morris executives and scientists charged with these tasks concluded in the 1970's that generally, not possibly, that generally smokers would, not could, smoke lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes to get the same amount of nicotine, assuming that statement to be true, that is something materially different than the public health community understood, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: First of all, I object to your motion to strike. Second, I object to your motion to strike on hypotheticals because your hypotheticals are incomplete. And I object to the form of that question.
MR. SURPRENANT: Fine. I'm going to make my motion. You have to answer hypotheticals, and I think that objection is encouraging the witness to continue to improperly avoid answering hypothetical questions.
MR. ROSENTHAL: You ask a complete hypothetical, Dr. English can feel free to answer it. There is nothing wrong in the rules with Dr. English —
MR. SURPRENANT: That's going to be II of my motion in limine.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Dr. English, are you going to answer my question or not?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I'm not sure I can answer it any fuller than — I would just simply have to know more about the nature of, you know, who's concluding it, what they are concluding it on, you know, whether it's based on scientific studies, whether it's based on, you know, just a general comment that's floating around, you know.
If they did a study that was, let's say, comparable to the American Cancer Society's CPS-I study that had a million smokers over 12 years, if they had studies comparable to Michael Russell's studies, which had hundreds of smokers, you know, if that's the kind of — and were reaching different conclusions in the public health community, if all of
those were there, then that would be different from what the public health community did.
But one of the things the public health community did was they knew how to -- they knew how to evaluate scientific information, and so they would have been able to distinguish a, you know, conclusions based on a million-person studies versus, you know, a comment.
So without a particular document in front of me I'm -- I can't go much further than that.
MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. Move to strike in
part.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. I agree it would have been importantly different than what the public health community knew.
Dr. English —
MR. ROSENTHAL: And I oppose the motion to
strike.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Dr. English, let me try to make my question clear. You are an expert. Hypothetical examinations of experts are proper. I am asking you, as a medical historian, to assume that Philip Morris scientists and executives in the 1970's, based on tests that they had
done, doing them as competently as they believed they could be done and believing they were competent, understood that, generally, not possibly, smokers would, not could, smoke lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes to get the same amount of nicotine. That was something importantly different than what the public health community believed.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: And I would answer in the same -- the same way, you know. Now you're adding some description of the type of studies that they would have done, and, again, I would need to know more about — I realize this is a hypothetical question, but I think it's an important hypothetical question, in that there were established, you know, scientific studies that had certain kinds of evidence that the public health community was relying on. And so that's the kind of evidence I think the public health community would have been looking for in that statement.
So you want to say competently perform studies -- I would need to know more about -- are we talking about an epidemiological study? Are we talking about a compensation study like Michael
Russell was doing? I just simply would need to know more information.
If you're saying there are comparable studies, if we agree on that and there are comparable studies to what the public health community knew, reached a different conclusion, then I agree, it's a different conclusion.
MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. Move to strike in part, in large part, to the last sentence.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I oppose the motion to
strike.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. You believe that you have an understanding, as used in your expert report, about what the public health community understood, right?
A. I think I do, yes.
Q. Okay. Using that definition of understood, if Philip Morris understood in the 1970's that generally, not possibly, smokers would, not could, smoke lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes to get the same amount of nicotine, that was something importantly different than what the public health community understood, correct?
THE WITNESS: Again, I know how the public health community understood information because I've studied them. I don't know how Philip Morris understood anything. I mean, I know that the public health community was basing theirs on huge epidemiological studies. They were basing their notions of compensation on studies that had hundreds of smokers. So I know how they understood.
I don't know how Philip Morris reached conclusions. I haven't studied it. And so I don't know what they understood or how they understood it.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. I'm asking you to assume they understood what I have put up as sub-A. They understood it in the same way you mean, with the same definition, the same scope, the same depth that you have testified that the public health community understood compensation issues.
And with that definition of understanding, I will ask you one more time. If Philip Morris understood in the 1970's that, generally, not possibly, smokers would, not could, smoke lowered tar and cigarettes to get the same amount of nicotine, that was something importantly different than what the
public health community understood.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: If I understand the way you've rephrased the question is that, if Philip Morris was basing their — this hypothetical -- because, you know, I just want to know that it is a hypothetical and I don't know -- have any facts behind it -- but if your hypothetical, as I understand it now, is if Philip Morris was basing its knowledge, its understanding on the same types of information that the public health community did, such as large epidemiological studies and compensation studies, for example, like those of Michael Russell, and had reached different conclusions, that would be different from what the public health community understood.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. And so since A is embedded into my B, if Philip Morris understood that, generally, smokers would smoke lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes to get the same amount of nicotine, and that that was driven by nicotine addiction, that was something importantly different than what the public health community understood, correct?
THE WITNESS: I think the public health community understood in the '70s that what was driving compensation was to maintain a level of nicotine, and in the 1970's -- I think we went over some of those statements by Michael Russell yesterday -- was that they viewed the compensation -- that's the only explanation that I’ve seen in the public health literature that striving to get a nicotine level is what smokers who compensated, what they were doing.
So I don't -- I don't know what Philip Morris knew about, but I think that the public health community knew that compensation was driven by nicotine.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. That's not my question. My question is:
Did the public health community understood -- strike that.
If Philip Morris understood, not that compensation was driven by nicotine, but that, generally, smokers would smoke lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes to get the same amount of nicotine because of nicotine addiction, that was something importantly different than the public health community understood.
THE WITNESS: Are you saying that the word "addiction" is the important word here? Because, you know, I think when the public health community was talking about compensation being driven by nicotine, they may not have used the word "addiction," although I think they did in some points used the term "addiction." I think, you know, that's what maintaining a level of a substance, a constant level means. It's like keeping the same level of caffeine.
I mean, it's driven by an addiction. And so I have seen no other explanation of compensation in the period that we're talking about, the 1970's, that has -- is anything other than driven by nicotine.
MR. SURPRENANT: Move to strike, nonresponsive.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I oppose.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. I'm not asking about compensation. I'm not asking about compensation. I understand what compensation is. I'm not asking about that. I'm asking something much more specific, whether the public -If Philip Morris understood, not that some smokers could possibly compensate, not that some
smokers could possibly compensate, but that nicotine addiction would drive, as a general matter, smokers to actually smoke cigarettes to get the same amount of nicotine, that was something that was importantly different than the public health community understood, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, I haven't studied Philip Morris's documents, so I can't give you an understanding of what Philip Morris understood about that. If you have a document, I'd be happy to take a look at it. But what I can tell you is how the public health community understood nicotine and its role in compensation, which is part of the addiction story.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Okay. Let's go to C. If Philip Morris understood -- understood -- that consumers understood lowered tar and nicotine to mean better for you, is that something the public health community also understood?
MR. ROSENTHAL: First of all, it's not actually what -- your chart in C says nothing about what Philip Morris knew. It just says consumers understood --
MR. SURPRENANT: I've been adding Philip Morris. These are — did the public health community and FTC know these facts. Anyway -MR. ROSENTHAL: In C you're specifically referring to, not just what consumers understood, but what Philip Morris's understanding of consumers -MR. SURPRENANT: Yes. My question was very
precise.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. If Philip Morris understood that consumers, the public, class members, understood lowered tar and nicotine to mean better for you, is that consistent with the public health community's understanding at the time?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, your question has two parts to it and something that I have no opinion on, expert -- I don't know how consumers understood these terms. We've been over that. And I don't know what Philip Morris knew. And so I'm really not in a position to make any comments about that.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Did the public health community know that Philip Morris knew that it was false, that consumers
understanding that lowered tar and nicotine meant better for you was false?
A. Wait a minute.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Now I'm confused. Now did the public health community know what?
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. That Philip Morris -- Philip Morris knew consumers would read "lowered tar & nicotine" on the bottom of a Marlboro Lights box to mean better for you and Philip Morris knew that was false.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form and
compound.
THE WITNESS: I don't — I don't know the answer to that question.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Did the public health community know those
facts?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Knew which facts?
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. That Philip Morris understood that, as a general matter, smokers, consumers, would read "lowered tar & nicotine" to mean better for you.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Same objection.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. And knew that that was false because -because, due to addiction, they would smoke the lowered tar and nicotine cigarette in such a way as to get the same amount of nicotine.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't know the answer to that question. I certainly have not seen in the public health literature that I have read any discussion of that, so I don't have an opinion.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Okay. Do you have an opinion on this: If the Marlboro Lights box, rather than say, "lowered tar & nicotine," said, "better for you," would that have been false and misleading?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I'm not an expert in how people process consumer packaging, so I don't have an opinion.
MR. SURPRENANT: Okay.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Did the public health community and the FTC, did they know that Philip Morris advocated
continued use of the FTC method precisely because it misled smokers into thinking Marlboro Lights were better for you?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I have certainly not seen any discussion of that in the public health literature.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. So let's just kind of stay there. If the public health community knew in the 1970's, '80s and '90s, that Philip Morris and other tobacco industry -other tobacco companies -- were advocating the continued use of the FTC testing method because they knew it misled smokers into thinking lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes were better for them when they weren't, that is something that would have been new and different and that the public health community did not know, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: The way I'd approach a question like that is that the FTC did reevaluate their — its method in the 1970's, 1977, 1978, it re-evaluated it in the 1980's and it re-evaluated again in the 1990's. They knew at every point that what the FTC Method was, was a machine-derived numbers
that were good for comparisons. They understood compensation so that they knew that some smokers would get a different amount for that.
I'm unaware of — I mean, I read all of the annual reports of the FTC. I'm unaware of any discussion in there that they thought that these — these numbers were in any way misleading the American public. They had some comments about if someone used a different system, that might mislead the public.
So, I mean, they were worried about that, but I didn't see them saying — comment about theirs and I don't see any comments in there particularly about Philip Morris's behavior.
MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. Move to strike, nonresponsive.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Oppose.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. I know, Dr. English, that you are having trouble answering hypothetical questions. I understand that. You may have trouble answering this one. But do you think in the 1990's if Philip Morris told the FTC, FTC, we have scientists, we have marketing people, we do surveys, we've done a lot of work on compensation and addiction and public
perception, and we want you to continue the FTC testing method because it's favorable to our business in the following way: It misleads Marlboro Light smokers into thinking that "lowered tar & nicotine" on the Marlboro Light box means better for them than Marlboro Reds and we know that's false. Don't you think the FTC would have said, hmm, let's look into that?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, again, the way I can answer that is I have seen a submission of Philip Morris in the discussion in 1957 — 1997 — of changing the FTC method. And so I know what -- what is in that. We talked about that a little bit yesterday.
Certainly the FTC was, once again, in 1997 concerned about that their method -- but beyond that I don't know what Philip Morris believed. I don't know if they believed what you said, what it was based on, whether it would have changed the FTC's view of their system, which they were already calling into question. Beyond that I simply can't go.
MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. Move to strike, nonresponsive.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I oppose.
MR. SURPRENANT: Mr. Rosenthal, I really would urge you to instruct your witness that his responsibility as an expert witness is to answer my questions, including my hypothetical questions, and not give speeches that are designed to avoid making troubling admissions.
MR. ROSENTHAL: He actually — he answered that question.
MR. SURPRENANT: You can choose not to do that and I will cite to this portion of the transcript in my motion to strike Dr. English as an expert witness. I leave it up to you.
MR. ROSENTHAL: He answered that question. At the end of the answer, he said, I don't know what the FTC would have done. Your asked question was what would the FTC would have done and he said I don't know. I don't know how more directly he could answer that question.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Okay. So if Philip Morris — let me -- if Philip Morris had said, FTC, whatever we said early on about the FTC Method, by the '70s we understood it was good for us because it was misleading consumers. It
was generating lower numbers than we know they -- the actual smokers would get, but it would give them a health reassurance message that lowered tar and nicotine was better for you.
So we want you to continue, FTC, to use the FTC Method precisely so it can assist us in misleading our customers. Are you telling me you don't have an idea what the FTC would have done?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't know what the FTC would have done. They knew about what some of the limitations were of their testing method. They knew that from even before they started it. They reiterated in the '70s, '80s and '90s their understanding that, you know, that -- about the FTC Method, the limitations of that method. They kept it because they thought that it was of benefit to smokers to know of comparable values. They knew that compensation would permit some smokers of low-tar cigarettes to get a higher amount, but, I mean, I don't know what they would have done with a representation by Philip Morris of that -- the way you describe.
know.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. So let me ask you this question. Do you want the jury to judge your credibility on your not being able to offer an opinion on what the FTC would have done if Philip Morris in the 1990Ts had said, since the 1970's we have known that the FTC numbers mislead consumers because consumers understand "lowered tar & nicotine" to mean better for you, and we know that's false, you want the jury to judge your credibility on the fact that you, as a medical historian, would just be at sea to understand if the FTC would have had any interest in pursuing that, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form, vague, mischaracterizes his testimony and argumentative.
THE WITNESS: I would let the jury make its own decisions based on my testimony and others.
MR. ROSENTHAL: And tempers are getting a little hot. Why don't we take a break. We've been going about an hour.
MR. SURPRENANT: Sure.
VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record at 10:02.
(Proceedings recessed.)
VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the record at 10:08. BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Okay. When we broke your counsel,
Dr. English, or Philip Morris's counsel, said things were getting, I don't know, contentious. If I were getting contentious, I apologize to you, sir.
But I have done another graph or illustrative, and it's perfectly possible we agree on this. There is no reason to be contentious at all.
Dr. English does not have an opinion on what the FTC would have done in the 1990's if Philip Morris told the FTC that, since the 1970's, Philip Morris knew, quote, "lowered tar & nicotine" as measured by FTC method was misleading consumers.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Is that a question or a
statement ?
MR. SURPRENANT: Yeah, that that's correct.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You misspelled "opinion."
MR. SURPRENANT: You know, I do that.
That’s the danger -- opinion -THE WITNESS: I mean, I suppose what the FTC would have done would have been to investigate it, but what they would have done beyond that, how they would
have decided at the end of the investigation, no, I don't know what they would have done.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Why do you suppose they would have investigated it?
A. Well, certainly from time to time, you know, I think I mentioned the FTC on a number of occasions re-evaluated the method when ventilation holes in filters became a prominent way of low-tar cigarettes.
So in 1978 they opened the discussion about whether the FTC method accurately measured that cigarettes with ventilation holes, the Barclay incident in 1980's raised issues, and they had a big discussion about Barclay cigarettes and whether they had any relevance to other forms of low-tar cigarettes. And then in the 1990's there was a big push in the second half of the 1990's to figure out what to do with the FTC Method.
So, you know, in general, I think the FTC has re-evaluated its method on a number of times. And so I would suppose, this would just be a guess, that, you know, if someone -- if a company came in and said something like that, they probably would have investigated it and see if that would change their opinion about what the method was and how it should be
used.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Dr. English, do you have any views that, if Philip Morris, based on internal research it didn't disclose, knew that lowered -- the consumers would generally understand "lowered tar & nicotine" to mean better for you than Marlboro Reds and knew that was false because they were just as bad for you, do you have a view on whether that would have been misleading?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, I don't know — I'm not someone who studies consumer perception, so if I don't know how the public would view that statement or that logo or words on a package one way or another, so I simply can't answer that question.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Okay. I think we missed each other. We established yesterday -- and I wasn't meaning to reopen the topic -- that you are not an expert in consumer behavior, understanding, and you don't know and you haven't studied how consumers would have understood "lowered tar & nicotine." I understand that. My question is slightly different.
My question is, assume with me that Philip Morris, based on their internal research, understood that, as a general matter, consumers would understand "lowered tar & nicotine" on the Marlboro Light box to mean better for you than regular cigarettes, and Philip Morris knew that that was false in that Marlboro Lights was just as bad for you as Marlboro Reds, assuming those things are true, do you have an opinion one way or another whether that would have been a misleading marketing strategy by Marlboro?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Many parts to that question. See if I can — you know, I understand it's a hypothetical question, and so, you know, I haven't studied what Philip Morris knew or didn't know, and I don't study consumer perception, as you mentioned. So I sort of have two feet in quicksand in trying to respond to your question.
I mean, if you're saying that they had conducted extensive marketing research, which I don't understand, but let's say that they did, and that's assuming that that marketing research said something that all smokers of Marlboro Lights get more tar and nicotine than another, you know, Marlboro Reds, you
know, and if they -- and if they had research that said that all -- marketing research or consumer perception research -- that all smokers who looked at that, those words, on the bottom of the package understood that as being safer, if sort of all those things are there and the studies are good, that would — that would be different from, you know, you know, I would think that that was information that people would want to know.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. How about if you substitute "generally" for all the all's in your last answer?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, generally, I don't know what "generally" means in this case, in your definition there. I'm taking that as, you know, as most.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. And then what would that do to your answer?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: It's, you know, the same thing. Again, once again, it's a hypothetical. Historians don't do well with hypotheticals. But, again, if all of that were known through, you know,
extensive marketing research, that would be something that I think the public would need to know.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. So do you know — have you studied what happened when Light cigarettes were introduced in terms of how rapidly they displaced regular cigarettes in terms of market share?
A. I can't give you the precise numbers, but Americans very rapidly shifted to filtered cigarettes and then to lower tar filter cigarettes. So let's say in 1950 there would be like half a percent filter cigarettes and the numbers became, you know, just flipped on that as time went on. I'm not sure I know the precise numbers for 1971 when Philip Morris introduced Marlboro Lights.
Q. And so there was a rapid swing between unfiltered and filtered, and then, once Marlboro Lights were launched, there was a rapid and substantial shift from filtered regular cigarettes to Light cigarettes; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form, characterization.
THE WITNESS: I'm not sure that Marlboro Lights was the pivot there. I mean, I think there was
a movement towards filtered cigarettes before Marlboro Lights, but certainly that was part of the trend, yes. BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. And do you have any views as a medical historian whether the rapid shift from unfiltered to filtered and then the rapid shift from regular to light indicates or supports the conclusion that there was a broad need for some sort of health reassurance by smokers so they could continue to smoke but somehow convince themselves they weren't killing themselves?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't have — I don't have an opinion on that. That gets into consumer perception, and that's not an area that I have expertise.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Okay. Let's go back to your report in this case. And we were — we were going through section 7 beginning at page 18, and the topic of our disagreement, Dr. English, was I was asking where there was recognition that smokers would compensate, would compensate, as a general matter, to get the same level of nicotine from their lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes as they got from the higher tar and
nicotine cigarettes they switched from, and that that phenomenon was driven by nicotine addiction.
And your testimony was, I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, that that is inherent or implicit in the studies that you cite — strike that. Strike that.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Just for the record I do not agree at all with the characterization of what the dispute was yesterday.
MR. SURPRENANT: I just struck it.
MR. ROSENTHAL: You can ask whatever questions you want.
MR. SURPRENANT: I just struck it. It is metaphysically gone.
MR. ROSENTHAL: It is still on the transcript. I object.
It's gone.
MR. SURPRENANT: You know, I realize that there is actually two parts to my question, and that's how come I stopped, Dr. English.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Is there anywhere in paragraph 7, in Section 7, anywhere, where, in sum or substance, one of these sources states smokers, as a general matter,
will smoke their lowered tar and filtered -- and nicotine cigarette in such a way as to get comparable amounts of nicotine as they got from their higher tar and nicotine cigarettes and that they are going to do that because that phenomenon is driven by nicotine addiction?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Object —
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. I don't think that that sentence shows up in Section 7. Please tell me if I'm wrong.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I think that Julius Richmond's statement comes close to that. I mean, do they put -- would they have phrased it exactly the way your question did? I'm not sure each one of the quotes does. I think that the —
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. I'm sorry, but what statement are you referring to?
A. Talking about paragraph 53.
Q. Okay. 53.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I have the wrong expert report. I don't want to show up on the screen, so —
MR. SURPRENANT: Let the record reflect Mr. Rosenthal is coaching his witness. No, he's not. That was a joke.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Okay. So you identify Surgeon General Julius Richmond quote from the '79 Surgeon General Report as coming close to that; is that right?
A. I think so.
Q. Okay. Let's look at that. Surgeon General Richmond says, it is possible for a low tar and nicotine smoker to inhale in one day much more of these constituents than a smoker of cigarettes with a higher tar and nicotine content. So he says that's possible, right?
A. He does.
Q. He doesn't say as a general matter that's what's going to happen.
A. He said it's possible.
Q. And then he said, some studies suggest that individuals who smoke low tar and nicotine may inhale more deeply or smoke the cigarette further down to the butt to compensate for the lower concentration of nicotine. So he says there are some studies that suggest that to be true, correct?
A. That's what that particular paragraph says,
yes .
Q. And he doesn't mention addiction.
A. No, but, again, my understanding of what — how the public health community understood compensation in the 1970's was it was driven by nicotine to get a constant level. And that's a measure of addiction. Sometimes they use the word; sometimes they didn't.
For example, Michael Russell, we've -- I've cited his studies in this same section yesterday and we were talking about it. I mean, he worked at a unit which was -- had the term "addiction" in the unit, and he was in an addiction research unit at Maudsley Hospital in London.
So, I mean, it's clearly there, you know. He published in journals, like the British Journal of Addiction, but whether, you know, whether they put the term in the text is not always the case. I mean, we have, I think, later on in the report I talk about some "Consumer Reports" studies about the same time.
Do you want to take a look at that?
Q. We'll get there. Let's keep that in mind, but I do want to follow up. Do you know if the
Tobacco Institute immediately slammed this report saying it was bad scientists, what was the Surgeon General doing sticking his nose in the business, this is America, you know, essentially just slamming this report ?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't know that.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. And I take it, if the Tobacco Institute immediately and vigorously, with Philip Morris's active participation, immediately slammed the Surgeon General for daring to suggest cigarette smoking was harming people or was addictive, that would not have any effect on your report, on your expert opinions?
A. Well, this report talks about what the scientific and public health communities knew. I've never seen any evidence that they were swayed by comments, at least not in their reports, that they were swayed by comments by Philip Morris or the Tobacco Institute. Beyond that I can't go.
Q. Okay. If I could direct your attention to paragraph 56, the last sentence. It says, researchers studied this issue and generally concluded that switchers to lower-yield cigarettes did not increase
the number of cigarettes smoked.
Is that — is that the conclusion that researchers in the field reached according to your research?
A. Yes. And then in 57 I give some citations to that.
Q. And so it's your view, as a medical historian, that the public health community generally concluded that, when you switch to lower tar and nicotine cigarettes, over time your cigarette consumption would be essentially the same as it was before, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Same number of cigarettes.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Yes.
A. Right. In fact, now that doesn't mean that there weren't some smokers who would smoke more cigarettes and some that would smoke fewer cigarettes. I think what Dr. Garfinkel was saying there was that, when he analyzed the data from the CPS-I study, which that's the million-person study, that he concluded from that, that, in the general sense, they -smokers -- on average did not increase the number of
cigarettes smoked.
Q. Okay. You had mentioned that there was some later part of your report that you wanted to draw attention to.
A. Well, yeah. If I can find it here, there is a section there on — yeah, I think it would be on page 35, paragraph 87.
Q. Now, would you classify the "Consumer Reports" as being in the public health community?
A. I think in the area of tobacco, in the 1950's, in particular, early 1960Ts, the "Reader's Digest" and the 1950's and '60s the "Consumer Reports" were certainly ways that public health information was being conveyed. So in that particular sense, I'm not sure I can say that with all topics, but I think that this is an area where the information was being translated for the public.
Q. I mean, "Consumer Reports" isn't like the British Medical Journal of Medicine. I mean,
"Consumer Reports" is a consumer-oriented magazine, correct?
A. Right. It's not a medical journal, no.
Q. Right. And so "Consumer Reports" is a lot -- is much closer to being, like, say, "The
Washington Post" than it is to being like the medical journal, right?
A. I'm not sure I would agree with that. I don't read "The Washington Post," and so I'm not -but what both "Reader's Digest" and the "Consumer Reports" did was actually report to, in their studies, what various scientific and public health bodies were saying. And so — and in my reading of the "Consumer Reports" and my reading of the public health information that there is a congruence there. In other words, I think that what "Reader's Digest" was talking about in some ways in the 1950’s, but we're talking here about "Consumer Reports," I think this "Consumer Reports" article in 1976 and then there is,
I think, I mentioned another one beginning on paragraph 90, they return to that same subject in the '80s, you know, I think reflects, you know, what the public health community was thinking at that moment.
Q. Yeah. I mean, I notice, you see you have "Consumer Reports" and you have "Newsweek" in paragraph 92, you know, but I thought you were just studying the public health community.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
and, again, I think this is just evidence that, you know, how the public health community was educating the American public. In other words, these ideas in the public health community were picked up in consumer magazines. I'm not saying what the public understood from the "Consumer Reports." I'm just pointing out that they are saying roughly what the public health community is saying.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. If I can direct your attention to paragraph
6 6?
A. 6 6?
Q. You state in 1977 Secretary of Health, Education -MR. ROSENTHAL: Can you hold on and wait until we actually get there?
THE WITNESS: Okay.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Okay.
MR. SURPRENANT: You know, I think I have a
copy.
MR. ROSENTHAL: If you have an extra copy, that would be great.
MR. SURPRENANT: I think I do.

Q. In 1977 Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Joseph A. Califano, and Surgeon General Julius Richmond disbanded the TWG, that is, the Tobacco Working Group. Do you know why that happened?
A. I don't. When they disbanded it, they did not give a reason.
Q. If you could look at footnote 92.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Page 30.
THE WITNESS: Yep.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Do you know how that document came to your attention?
A. Hold on a second here. I'm not entirely sure. I don't remember.
Q. Okay. Paragraph 73. Yeah, this is -- you cite the St. Louis County Medical Society suggestion to its readers in 1990. This is really in a very different era than Light cigarettes. I mean, this is really in the era where it was going from unfiltered to filtered, right?
A. And it was also -- in part it was going from unfiltered to filtered, but there were also a period of -- this was also a period where tar was being
reduced as well.
Q. Now, in paragraph 78 at page 32 you state, in addition, in the mid 1970's the Department of Health, Education and Welfare issued a health education poster providing the FTC measured tar and nicotine yields of major U.S. cigarettes. This poster told smokers who would not quit to switch to a lower yield brand.
The cigarette world is divided into the bad and worse. You can buy as much as 34 milligrams of tar in a cigarette or as little as 2, as much as 2.1 milligrams of nicotine or as little as .02. There is a tar and nicotine list below that tells you which is which. Look them up. If you must smoke, at least bad is better than worse.
Isn't that exactly what is being communicated on this box, Marlboro Lights, "lowered tar & nicotine"? It's not saying it's good, but bad is better than worse?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't have any — I don't know how people would interpret that. I think this poster is -- speaks, you know, for itself. In other words, what it means is the cigarette world is divided
and it's based on -- its division into bad to worse based on FTC measured tar and nicotine yields, and it's referring smokers to that list, and then it's saying, if you must smoke, which is actually a phrase from the federal government's program on, "If You Must Smoke," but at least bad is better than worse.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Okay. Let's go back to paragraph 8 7 where we were.
A. I'm sorry. 87?
Q. Yeah, page 35. So here we have in 1976 a consumer report saying, nicotine is an addictive agent for most smokers. Philip Morris disagreed with that in 1976, right?
A. I don't know.
Q. Well, Philip Morris -- you don't know?
A. I haven't studied -- I don't know what Philip Morris was thinking about addiction in 1976.
Q. Well, you know in 1994 the CEO,
Mr. Campbell, swore under oath that it wasn't addictive, right?
A. You know, we talked a little bit about that yesterday, you know. He said that in reference to a -- referring back to the 1964 Surgeon General's
Report, but, beyond that, I can't go.
Q. Right. But then the next day there was a full-page ad by the Tobacco Institute in "The Washington Post" where it says, facts, facts, and the fact that said, just all by itself, without reference to the 1964 report, without any reference to, we know people have difficulty stopping, we don't think it's addictive, smoking is not addictive, it continued to put that message out to the public. So it continued to try and dispel any suggestion that nicotine was addictive, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: I object to the long preface without foundation. I also object to the form of the question.
THE WITNESS: I haven't seen that newspaper ad or statement. I'd have to do that and we could take a look at it.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. In paragraph 128 you cite -- at page 51 — you cite a 2004 report that noticed a striking difference between the UK and the United States.
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know if that study held constant the impact of air pollution, the greater air pollution in
the UK than in the U.S.?
A. I don't know that.
Q. Do you have an opinion that, if the cigarette industry responds to the growing health concerns about health and smoking had said, folks, you got to understand, smoking is addictive, you're going to smoke the same amount whether it's lower tar or not, and we just want you to understand that, that rather than Light cigarettes taking off and becoming a marketing phenomenon, that more people would have successfully quit smoking?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't have an opinion about
that.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Okay. What's going on -- I'm going to ask some questions about -- let me tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to ask questions about paragraphs 133 to the end and then we can -A. 133, okay.
Q. Yeah, to the end. And then we'll take a short break. I'll probably be finished, but let me look at my notes.
Okay. Could you remind me, Dr. English,
what the IARC, the I-A-R-C, is?
A. It's the International Agency on Research on Cancer. It's part of the World Health Organization.
Q. And where is it headquartered?
A. Well, the World Health Organization is in Geneva. I'm not sure where IARC is located.
Q. Geneva is a very pretty town. And so they issued a monograph on tobacco smoke and involuntary smoking in 2004, correct?
A. Right. IARC has had a number of monographs dealing with cigarette smoking. This is one in a long series of those.
Q. You will recall I told you I had just recently gotten this case and I felt like I was speaking a foreign language. What is the scholarly -what is the definition of a monograph? Is that just like a fancy word for report?
A. I think in this case, yes.
Q. I mean, it sounds pretty special, a monograph. I'm interested, at the bottom, the monograph's caution that the introduction of cigarettes that can be misperceived as, quote, safe, closed quote, may have adversely affected, closed quote, then you add "smoking prevalence."
Is that saying that the introduction of cigarettes, such as Marlboro Lights, the kind of point I was trying to make a few moments ago, may have caused people who otherwise would have quit or tried to quit to keep smoking?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, in this particular IARC monograph, of course, they aren't -- they didn't talk about Marlboro Lights. I mean, they are talking about Light cigarettes. They raise that as an issue. I don't believe they concluded that it did, but they certainly raised that that was an issue.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. Okay. Do you know if the vast majority of underage smokers smoke Light cigarettes as opposed to regular cigarettes?
A. I don't know that, but other -- that most smokers smoke Light cigarettes, so -- but other than that I don't know exactly how -- the answer to your question.
Q. And so then we go on paragraph 13 to the American Cancer Society website.
A. I'm sorry. We're up to what now?
Q. Paragraph 135. I think I misspoke.
MR. ROSENTHAL: You said 13.
THE WITNESS: You said 13.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q. And you quote the American Cancer Society's website. This is the current website?
A. It was as of February when I turned in the report. The reason I say that is that they have actually -- they do modify their website from time to time and I think an earlier -- I built this on a prior report. We actually had to change the wording of that to reflect the website as of February 2010.
Q. You know, that's so true. We're all now so addicted to Google and Internet, but you have this false security born of a paper age that it's going to be there tomorrow -A. Uh-huh.
Q. -- and then it's sometimes not. You do the same Google search and what you had there yesterday is not there.
Okay. And it says -- this is the American Cancer Society website.
Is there a safe way to smoke? No. All cigarettes can damage the human body. Any smoking is dangerous. Cigarettes are the only legal product
whose advertised and intended use, smoking, is known to harm the body and cause cancer.
Can you think of any other products that would not make that claim unique to tobacco and smoking?
A. As I sit here today, I can't think of any.
Q. I mean, you state it more bluntly, which is, cigarettes are the only product that, if used as intended, will likely either kill or harm the consumer, right?
A. Well, "will likely," I'm not sure -- I mean, most smokers don't get diseases from them, but, I mean, certainly cigarettes have been -- are dangerous. They can kill. The public health community has known that for half a century.
Q. Yeah. Like alcohol is not a fair candidate because you can use alcohol moderately and can enjoy your appreciation of meals and things like that.
Would you agree?
A. I don't have an opinion on that.
Q. Okay.
MR. SURPRENANT: I am probably done, so let's take a short break and I'll think if I can manufacture any more mischief.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Okay.
VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record at 10:46.
