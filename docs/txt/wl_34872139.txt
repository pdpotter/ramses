EXAMINATION BY MS. CHABER
MS. CHABER: Q. State your full name for the record, please.
A. Joan Hoff.
Q. Spell it.
A. H-o-f-f.
Q. And is it Dr. Hoff?
A. Yes, it is.
Q. And that's Ph.D.?
A. Yes, it is.
Q. Have you been -- You have been deposed at least one time previously?
A. Yes, I have.
Q. Have you been deposed more than one time?
A. I've been deposed twice.
Q. And can you tell me what cases those were?
A. The first time was with respect to the Dunn and Wiley case and the second time was with respect to a civil action involving
the Nixon papers.
Q. And where and when was that latter one? I know about the Wiley.
A. It was in the fall of 1998.

2Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. As you know, I'm an attorney representing Leslie and Leonard Whiteley throughout this action against Philip Morris and
R.J. Reynolds.
This deposition is being taken under oath. Do you understand that?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. And that's the same oath that would be given in a court of law?
A. Yes.
Q. And if you do not understand any questions that I ask, or terms are used incorrectly or they are unclear, would you please
ask me to rephrase it or to repeat the question?
A. Yes, I will.
Q. Okay. And again, Counsel may interpose some objections during the course of this deposition. You're not represented here
by counsel other than appearing as an expert witness, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. And I would ask that you respond to the question and leave the legal maneuverings or whatever to a judge or a court to decide.
A. That's my pleasure.
Q. Okay. All right. Can you tell me what your current employment is?
A. I am directing the Contemporary History Institute at Ohio University and I'm a professor in the History Department there.
Q. And Ohio University is located where?
A. Unfortunately, in Athens, Ohio.
Q. I spent two years in Columbus, at Ohio State. How long have you been there?
A. I've been there two years now.
Q. And you said you're a professor?
A. Yes, I am.
Q. What does being the director of the Contemporary History Institute entail?
A. It means that I teach only graduate students and we specialize in a Ph.D. that's multidisciplinary. It's given in history, but
it teaches the students different methodologies in other disciplines so that they can go on to government work, or teaching, or
to business work related to anything in contemporary foreign policy, economics, even the study of women's history, women's
legal status. All kinds of contemporary issues.
Q. And when you say different methodologies, what do you mean?

3Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. Well, different disciplines use techniques that we don't always use in history. And consequently, if we can train our students
to be familiar with, for example, economics and the procedures that are used to analyze economic data, or if we can teach them
to use polls as sociologists use polls, sometimes that helps them in their research. What we try to do is help them to learn as
many different interdisciplinary methodologies as possible so that their research can be as comprehensive as possible.
Q. And who would be in charge of teaching the methodologies related to economics, for example?
A. We have what we call a contemporary history sequence. It's a quarter system, and there are three quarters in this sequence, and
what we do is bring in economists, bring in political scientists, bring in sociologists to lecture to them about the methodologies.
And then we provide them with bibliographies that they can further study, if they want to.
Q. Okay.
A. So we don't pretend that we are an expert in all of those disciplines, by any means. In fact that's why I use the word
“multidisciplinary” more than “interdisciplinary.”
Q. And do you consider yourself to be an expert in economics?
A. No.
Q. Do you consider yourself to be an expert in polling data?
A. No.
Q. Two years would have brought us back to 1997. Is that about when you started there?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. Was it in a particular term?
A. The fall.
Q. The fall of 97?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. And prior to that what were you doing?
A. I was in New York City heading the Center for the Study of the Presidency.
Q. And that was from November of 1995 --
A. Yes, it was.
Q. -- until you left to go to Ohio University?
A. Uh-huh.

4Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. What is the Center for the Study of the Presidency?
A. It's better to ask what was the Center for the Study of the Presidency.
Q. Did it cease and desist on your leaving?
A. That's right.
Q. You were the center. Okay.
A. I inherited it from a fellow who established it 30 years ago, and it was more or less on its way out and down. I preserved
the journal that it published, and by and large it simply had run out of steam and purpose, basically. And I don't like to manage
things that are senseless or serve no purpose, and so we quietly folded the tent and went away.
The best thing about it was I was able to keep a rent-controlled apartment in New York as a result.
Q. And still have, I hope?
A. Yes.
Q. One does not give those up?
A. No. I was there two weeks ago.
Q. Okay. So then I guess the question is what was the Center for the Study of the Presidency?
A. It actually was established by Gordon Hoxie on Long Island in the mid-'60s because of problems that he had with a small
college there and student demonstrations.
Q. What college?
A. I'm trying to think of the name of the small -- It's got an odd name.
Q. C.W. Post?
A. Yes, that's it. And I momentarily forgot it. And so he, because of those troubles, and ultimately he was relieved of his duties
as president, he went on to establish the center for students to come together and discuss modern politics and evaluate presidents
as an alternative to demonstrating in the streets.
So it was a good purpose at the time and I think it served a good function for a number of years, but it slowly got out of touch
with reality and what students want or think that they need today.
Q. So, during the two years that you were involved with it, what were you doing?
A. We were trying to shore up first the subscription list for the journal.
Q. What was the name of the journal?
A. The journal is Presidential Studies Quarterly -- it's now coming out of Texas -- which was not yet computerized in 1995.

5Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
And we were also then trying to see if there were certain functions of the organization that we could continue to do. Put on an
annual conference in Washington, D.C., for students from -- who were nominated from their individual colleges and universities.
And so we continued to do that and see if there were some other kinds of lobbying activities, and the whole idea was to move
the operation to Washington.
He never affiliated with a university or another institution, and that's why it was very, very difficult to keep this funding going
over this length of time, because Ford Foundation and Rockefeller, who originally came and funded this, were no longer making
that a top priority.
So we were trying to figure out how to salvage it, how to wind it down and make it more focused and specific, and finally I
concluded, over certain objections of my board of directors, which included at that time head of NASDAQ, that, really, the
journal is the only viable part of it, and so that's what we ended up salvaging and preserving.
Q. And the journal, you said, then moved its headquarters?
A. Oh, operations, to a presidential study center in Texas under the editorship of Edward George, III.
Q. And have you published in this Presidential Studies Quarterly?
A. Actually, I did. I published -- The only thing -- I wrote editorials, but I basically published a couple of pieces on Nixon.
We had a special issue on Nixon the second year I was there, and I had worked on Nixon, so I contributed what I couldn't
get other people to contribute.
Q. How often -- You said it's a quarterly.
A. Right.
Q. Even I figured that out, with my bad math.
A. Okay.
Q. During the time that you were involved in it, what other topics were published in the presidential studies --
A. We did a special issue on First Ladies. And what I try to do with all of the issues, because I was editing at the same time
that I was heading the organization, I tried to broaden its perspective.
It had been dominated for years by political scientists using statistical quantitative data, and basically that's kind of boring
and doesn't have a general appeal. And Hoxie had originally thought that the quarterly should appeal to decision-makers in
Washington, and the Foreign Policy Council in New York, and these kinds of important influential organizations, and I tried
and I think succeeded in convincing him that unless it broadened its appeal, had a more general appeal, these people were never
going to read this kind of stuff. So that's what I did most of the seven or eight issues that I edited.
Q. Okay.
A. I brought in historians, among other things, and then broadened the topics. They never had done anything on women to speak
of, let alone First Ladies, and so I tried to make it more diverse and more appealing to a broader audience.
Q. What other women's issues have you worked on?

6Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. I've done extensive work -- Even though it wasn't an issue, what I was trained to do at Berkeley, I have done extensive work
on women's legal status in this country, but I also, since the field was new in the '70s, when I went into it, I did individual
studies of colonial women.
I was determined, coming out of Berkeley, to find revolutionary women during the American Revolution who were important,
and there turned out to be none, so I studied women during the revolutionary period and came up with a theory that, basically,
I think, has proven true, that women don't benefit, basically, immediately, especially from revolutionary situations, and -- you
can look at this country and other countries -- they simply get lost in the process of codifying the law and institutionalizing
the revolution.
I did that initially because I was teaching over Sacramento and it was easy to come back here and do research.
Q. Where were you in Sacramento?
A. Sacramento State.
Q. Speaking of which, is there a CV someplace?
A. Yes.
MS. MASON: Yes.
MS. CHABER: Since I ran here from court, I don't have my Notice with me.
MS. MASON: I'll make a couple copies.
MS. CHABER: All right.
THE WITNESS: I went on to do a lot of women's research --
MS. MASON: Dr. Hoff, wait a second.
THE WITNESS: Okay.
(Discussion off the record.)
MS. CHABER: Q. So colonial women, revolutionary women, we have -- Betsy Ross doesn't count?
A. No, not really. I was hoping -- Because I had majored initially in European and Slavic history, I was hoping to find
revolutionary women who were participating in the revolution in a real physical and intellectual sense, as they did in the French
Revolution, and it just didn't happen.
But it was the bicentennial of the American Revolution, so I contributed this lengthy essay expressing my disappointment to
this collection of essays which has continued to sell and be reprinted from that time down to the present. It was not simply
because of mine, but we had a good collection of historians working on that.
Q. And did you reach conclusions as to why there were no women that rose to the level of prominence and involvement, such
as you described the French women did?

7Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. It's complicated, and that's what got me into this field. It was also opening up at the time, what we called the social and
cultural history, which is a subfield of U.S. history.
In most national histories, you had to go back and look at how women were socially conditioned from the colonial period
forward, and what, for example, one of the major religious revivals -- the First Grade Awakening it was called in the 1740s
-- did to women in terms of their own self-perception and their own sense of what we would call today self-esteem, purpose
and role in life.
And that had -- it prompted the men to become rebellious and to question government, if they got involved in this First Grade
Awakening revival movement, but it did the opposite for women, and -- so that intellectual and religious phenomena set women
in a position or set them back, compared with the men.
Up to that point, they were -- because of the colonial economy and because of just the colonial situation, there, they were more
on a par, and even the laws were a little more equitable with respect to women up to the 1740s, 1760s.
And then once we get into that pre-Revolutionary period, women simply aren't the decision-makers and they aren't motivated
to become the decision-makers, and that's one of the reasons. It's complex, but there are a variety.
And the economy was changing, so that they weren't encouraged to do that; and, as in most countries, the men assumed the
leadership positions for the revolution itself, which I could appreciate from my participation in the movements over in Berkeley.
Q. And you were in Berkeley?
A. During the golden years.
Q. The '60s?
A. Yes. I was in the state from the early '60s until 1976.
MS. MASON: Let me step out again.
(Discussion off the record.)
MS. CHABER: Q. So after your involvement in studying the revolutionary women, what other women's issues?
A. Well, in studying them, I looked at economics, politics, religion, education and the laws, and in that time -- remember, this
is the mid-'70s -- the area that was least studied --
Q. This is the mid-1970s that you're talking about?
A. I'm talking about the mid-1970s.
Q. I don't want to confuse the record.
A. The area that was the least studied was the legal status of women, so I chose then to go on and look at that, and ended up
writing two books, one with an English barrister, Albie Sachs, who's now the head of the Constitutional Court in South Africa
-- he's a white ANC member who was a Lawyers League person here in this country -- because he was in exile, on English
and American status of women, English status of women.

8Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
And then in the mid '90s, I ended up writing a book that covered the legal status of women until the early '90s.
Q. The titles of your books and so forth are listed on your CV?
A. Yes.
MS. CHABER: Which we will mark as Plaintiff's 1.
(Exhibit 1 marked.)
MS. CHABER: And we will mark as Plaintiff's 2 the Notice of Deposition.
(Exhibit 2 marked.)
MS. CHABER: Q. You were shown, I take it, the Exhibit A on the items you were requested to bring?
A. Yes, uh-huh.
Q. And you have brought with you those items you believe--19
A. Yes, I have.
Q. -- were responsive?
And I see that sitting before you is some sort of a notebook.
A. Uh-huh.
Q. And can you tell me what that is?
A. It contains the notes I took on the five boxes of material that I looked through.
Q. And the five boxes of materials, those are the boxes that are here in the room with us?
A. Yes.
Q. When did you take these notes?
A. I took them over the last two-week period in Big Sky, Montana.
Q. And when did you complete them?
A. Actually, the day I was flying in here, on Wednesday morning.
Q. And what -- when you refer to the five boxes, what is contained within those five boxes? And we can get more specific
afterwards, but I want to get a general idea first.

9Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. About two and a half of them contain Xerox copies from the San Francisco Chronicle and the L.A. Times. The bulk of them
would be newspaper material.
There's also a large section of Xerox copies from Newsweek, Time Magazine, U.S. World & News Report.
That kind of covers the mass media material.
There are much smaller amounts of material from Better Homes & Gardens, Easy Riders, Mother Jones News, and an even
tinier amount of material from the annual -- What do they call them these days? We used to call them “annuals.” The high school
publications, yearly publications. Yearbooks, right. And from the Nordhoff High School newspaper and it was called the Range.
And then a considerable amount of material on California legislation pertaining to rules and regulations for classes in hygiene,
phys ed, and the textbooks that would have been used in the period of, say, from the '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s.
There was a miscellaneous folder of material that I had seen previously because of the other testimony I had given in the two
other trials.
There was a video of public service announcements for the '60s, '70s and '80s.
I think that's the bulk of it.
Q. Did you yourself find and have copied the two and a half boxes, approximately, of the San Francisco Chronicle, L.A. Times,
and the things that you did?
A. No, I did not.
Q. Where did that come from?
A. It came from Shook, Hardy & Bacon.
Q. Who in particular? Do you know?
A. I met in October in New York City with James Arnold from Shook, Hardy & Bacon.
Q. In the past, you've met with Mr. Ohlemeyer?
A. Yes.
Q. Who else have you met with from Shook, Hardy?
A. I mainly dealt with Ohlemeyer in the previous cases, and I've met now and dealt with Gene Peck here, and Ms. Mason. But
basically, I dealt previously with Ohlemeyer.
Q. And when did you first form a relationship with Mr. Ohlemeyer? And I do not in any way mean to imply that on any -- I
know he's happily married, and I don't mean to imply anything untoward by that.
A. It was -- I've been thinking about it. I think it's within late '94. I've been saying '95, but I think he contacted me in late '94.
Q. And what was the nature of that contact?

10Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. I was teaching at Indiana University, Bloomington, and there was a case, a trial, that was going to take place in Indianapolis.
Q. And that was the Wiley case?
A. No, that was the Rogers case. And so he contacted me about that.
Q. And what did he tell you?
A. He -- I should say that Alan Purvis, representing Shook, Hardy in terms of the research part of it, contacted me first, and
I ended up talking to Ohlemeyer.
Q. And what were you told when you were first contacted?
A. I was given the information about the case and was asked if, because of the kind of social and cultural research I had been
doing on other topics, historical topics, if I would be interested in looking into the history of tobacco.
And I thought the request somewhat odd, since I didn't do tobacco, but I found myself in a position where, for two reasons,
I became interested.
One, it was an extremely, I thought, important social and cultural topic to investigate, and I had graduate students in that area,
and it offered them immediate compensation for doing some research. So that was a major consideration.
The other one was more personal. I had a friend with whom I had gone to graduate school in Berkeley who was dying of lung
cancer in San Diego, a professor at San Diego State, and we had been talking about the question of tobacco and how we viewed
or responded to it in the '60s and '70s when we were there.
And so for personal reasons, I decided that it would be interesting to find out more about the history of tobacco and attitudes
toward it, because we were talking, and -- we were talking with him, and he had married one of my best friends, and they were
then divorced, but all three of us were talking about how we perceived the risks of tobacco and the dangers of it as we all started
to try to smoke back in the '60s. They continued to smoke and I never did.
Q. You tried it, though?
A. Oh, yeah.
Q. Did you try it while you were a minor?
A. While I was?
Q. A minor; someone under the age of 18.
A. No. I tried it in Missoula, Montana when I went to college there as an undergraduate. Though I went there at 16, so maybe
I did try it as a minor. And then I tried it, obviously with greater gusto, as I got older, but it never was something that I could
do with ease.
Q. Because you didn't like it?
A. Yeah.

11Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. And your friend continued to smoke?
A. The friend who died had stopped smoking ten years before. His ex-wife continues to smoke.
Q. Freely?
A. Most of my friends continue to smoke.
Q. Freely, volitionally and totally with full knowledge?
A. Yeah.
Q. And do you believe that addiction plays any role in affecting people's volition?
MS. MASON: Objection, if you're calling for an expert opinion, outside of her area of expertise.
THE WITNESS: I don't know. I've had friends who have quit, so it's a mystery to me. Some quit, some don't.
MS. CHABER: Q. Do you have friends who say, “Boy, I know this stuff is bad but I just can't stop”?
A. They say it's difficult to stop. I think everyone -- We all knew, I think, from the beginning of any kind of smoking that we
were doing, that it would be difficult to stop.
Q. So when you were attempting to smoke, you were doing it knowing that you might have difficulty stopping later?
A. If one had formed a habit, yes. But I think that's just a given about what was the common sense knowledge about tobacco
at the time. This was in the '60s.
Q. And you're saying while you were at UC Berkeley in the 1960s, that it was common knowledge that if you smoked cigarettes,
you could become addicted to them such that it would be difficult to stop?
MS. MASON: Objection.
You're asking for her personal experience?
THE WITNESS: That's all I can attest to.
MS. CHABER: Q. That's where I thought we had gone.
A. Okay.
MS. MASON: I'm making sure.
THE WITNESS: I think mainly we thought about the health risks of it, which were very commonly known, and I think,
personally, that most of us probably thought that we were so bright and independent that we could never be hooked on anything.
But I think, obviously, we knew that it was habit-forming, because that kind of information was just out there.

MS. CHABER: Q. But there were people that you knew that were of the mind-set that you were bright, independent, and of
course you would be able to smoke cigarettes and be able to stop when you wanted to?
A. I think so, yeah. I think there was an arrogance that goes with youth.

government, there are certain uses of marijuana that are permitted by law?
A. Yes, though usually subject to some kind of jurisdictional litigation, my impression is. I really haven't followed that.
Q. The Medical Marijuana Act?

Q. Okay.
A.
Q.
A. [DELETED PERSONAL INFORMATION]
Q.
A.
Q. And you actually read the literature at that time?
A. Yeah.
Q. And what literature did you read at that time?
A. Underground newspapers of all kinds. You just walked on campus and people handed things to you.
Q. That said “Cigarette smoking causes lung cancer”?
A. Any idea, from the big bang theory to whatever would be at the low end of that scale, the information was available on the
Berkeley campus as you walked to your class.
Q. And not all that information was correct, was it?
A. Probably not.
Q. And some information is information that one might call folk wisdom?
A. We didn't call it folk wisdom, I don't think, at the time. I don't quite know what you mean by the term “folk wisdom.”
Q. I'll give you an example. For example, I know that when I was growing up, which wasn't that much different from when
you were growing up, what my parents told me was that you shouldn't smoke cigarettes because it could stunt your growth.
That's what I would call folk wisdom.
A. I would call it common knowledge or common-sense information that parents pass on to children.
Q. Are you aware of any data, any truth to that statement that smoking cigarettes could stunt your growth?
A. You found it in early textbooks, and so it was believed by a portion of the so-called scientific community in, say, the '30s
and '40s in this country.
You also would find, in the same textbooks, that it would affect your breathing. So that if we are talking about common
knowledge of not simply this subject but other subjects, what you find is that sometimes it proves true and sometimes it doesn't.

14Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
But the important thing about this kind of information, or perception of rules of behavior or of how we should act in this society,
those perceptions, whether true or not, condition very often how we act, or our parents hope they would condition how we act.
Q. Right, and as youth, very often when that type of information is given and then does not comport with your reality, it's
easily dismissed?
A. Well, I'm not so sure that you can say that. Take another example. My mother thought that flies caused polio.
Q. It was very common in the 1950s to believe that, correct?
A. Right. And then the Salk vaccine came out and we all marched up and got it, and I don't think it made me think less of my
mother or more favorably disposed toward flies.
It's something, when science disproves one of these common aphorisms, that we grow up with, it disproves it.
When science confirms it, it bolsters the position, and I think with respect to when you say the risks or dangers of smoking,
common knowledge or common sense about smoking was ahead of the scientific studies, which then finally appeared in the
late '30s and went into the '50s and down to the present. So it depends on the issue.
Q. And so, in your opinion, then, the common knowledge of the average person would be advanced above the common
knowledge of, say, tobacco executives with respect to whether or not cigarette smoking caused any of the myriad of health risks?
MS. MASON: Objection, incomplete hypothetical, argumentative and misstates testimony.
THE WITNESS: I couldn't comment as an expert witness on the mind-set of executives. I can only attest to and ultimately
will attest to what was out there for the average person and what the average person was exposed to in this country in terms
of common knowledge about smoking.
MS. CHABER: Q. Let me ask you: Contained within these five boxes, are there documents, newspapers, things that were put
out by the tobacco industry to the public denying the health hazards of smoking cigarettes?
A. The word “denying” is a little bit difficult for me to exactly answer. Most -- If we are talking, obviously, about statements
by companies, perhaps -- or more likely, you're talking about, I think, advertising?
Q. No, this was not addressing advertising.
A. That's what I need to know.
Q. These are public statements, press releases, ads, but not in the traditional sense of advertising, where you're advertising a
brand or something like that, where the health risks of smoking were denied.
A. In terms of just the way you've stated it, I'd say no.
The term “denial” is what is bothering me. Very seldom are you going to find a statement which absolutely denies, in the
common way we normally use that term, the health risks. The statements that are in those boxes are statements which say,
usually, that the evidence is not all in, or it's inconclusive, or the issue is still being studied.
You framed it in a way that I can't say that they actually deny health hazards.

15Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. Contained within those five boxes, are there public statements from the tobacco companies or their agents that indicate that
there is a controversy as to whether or not cigarette smoking causes lung cancer and other health risks?
MS. MASON: Objection as to the term “agent” as vague and undefined and may not be understood by this witness, and there's
no time frame. I object as overbroad on the time frame.
MS. CHABER: I'm talking about the five boxes.
THE WITNESS: But the time frame there goes from the '50s through the '80s.
MS. CHABER: Q. Whatever time frame exists in those boxes, are there things within those boxes?
A. Say it again.
MS. CHABER: Can you read back my question?
(Record read.)
MS. MASON: Same objections.
THE WITNESS: It's hard, because the question is so complicated. There are statements by the -- I don't know whether they
are representatives, statements that are quoted where the representatives of the companies are quoted or where the Tobacco
Institute is quoted. There are very few of these.
There are statements where scientists who have worked on some of the cancer studies, the American cancer studies, are quoted
saying that the evidence is inconclusive, and if that's what you mean by controversy, yes, there are those kinds of statements.
But they are coming not simply from tobacco representatives, but from, for example, Tyler Hammond himself, who, right after
the '64 report, wrote a Reader's Digest piece in which he said that the evidence was inconclusive.
So if you're talking about a controversy based on inconclusive evidence, that is contained in some of these documents. But it
certainly doesn't prevail. It's contained primarily through the period of the '50s.
MS. CHABER: Q. And you do not have within these boxes tobacco industry statements, say, after the Surgeon General's report
of 1964?
MS. MASON: Assumes facts.
THE WITNESS: There are statements from the Tobacco Institute saying the same thing that I've just said, and they are coming,
again, from -- they are talking about the inconclusiveness of some of the conclusions of the Surgeon General's report of '64.
They exist, but they exist in very small number, if you're looking at total coverage.
MS. CHABER: Q. Now, did you yourself review all of the sources that there were for information with respect to what was
out there and available with respect to tobacco, yourself?
A. In terms of what's in these boxes?
Q. In terms of any of the work that you've done.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
16Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. Yes. I mean, it's very easy for -- when we are talking about the newspapers, to do that, because they are indexed on microfilm,
so you can look up subject matter.
Q. Have you checked to see that what's in these boxes is every reference to tobacco that appears in publication or any available
source?
A. I have not checked these boxes against a microfilm index. What I was able to do with these boxes and the newspapers in
them was because I had done previous research in the Indianapolis newspapers and Ohio newspapers, I knew what the dates
were of the important events involving tobacco, and the important Surgeon General reports, and the important propositions here
in California which were on the ballot periodically concerning tobacco.
And so I zeroed in on those dates to make sure that it looked as though or that it appeared as though those important dates were
covered in terms of these xeroxed copies. And I would do the same thing if I went back to the index for these newspapers. I
would zero in on the dates that are important for this particular case and for my testimony as an expert witness.
Q. What dates are those?
A. Well, in this case, because of the age of the plaintiff -- The previous cases involved me in looking at these scientific reports
which began to appear, the dates of them at least, when they began to appear in the late '30s, early '40s, and in the early '50s,
and going on through that decade, so I previously had done that.
Then, obviously, everyone zeros in on the Surgeon General's report of '64. But again, that's a little early for this case.
And so I was trying to look at what had happened in terms of reports or Surgeon General's statements after '64. And you end
up having, you know, a statement in '71, 1971, where the Surgeon General is saying that he's recommending a ban on smoking
in public places. And then here in California you get a proposition in 1978, you get another proposition in 1988, involving
tobacco, and then a variety of legislative debates here in California.
In other words, I was trying to use the newspapers, and then use of the local newspapers as well for Ventura County, to see how
-- what the state legislature was doing when it began to discuss a ban on cigarette advertising, for example, as early as 1969.
And so that's what I focused on, looking at very specific dates where it became a debate, public debate, either through legislature
or through the ballot process with propositions.
Q. Did you look at what the tobacco industry was doing in response to any of these events?
A. Naturally, as these events occurred, you would have, in some of the stories, but not all of them -- You have to keep in mind
what the press does is to focus on what they think is the hot or the buzz issue of the day, and what became the important issues
were these reports coming from the national government, coming from the Surgeon General. Or when, for example, Congress
forced the FTC to look more closely in the late '70s at cigarette advertising claims with respect to filtered cigarettes, you look
at what -- the press then focuses on that, and that's what the headline talks about.
The first couple of paragraphs in these stories will talk exclusively about that. Occasionally -- And, of course, since I was doing
the research, I would read the entire article. Whether the average person would is questionable.
Then you might find in the last paragraphs a couple of statements indicating quotes from the tobacco industry or the Tobacco
Institute. Occasionally, when there was a major report in '64 -- again, not so applicable in this case -- the Tobacco Institute did,
several days later, in the L.A. Times, have the L.A. Times carry a one- or two-inch piece on their response.

17Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
But by and large, the responses from the tobacco people are in the last half or the very end paragraphs of these stories. The
headlines and what people would notice immediately are the reports of the studies.
Q. And how far along would you follow what was then put out subsequent to those key dates?
A. Several days.
MS. MASON: Assumes facts.
THE WITNESS: Or several weeks. If you're a historian doing that, you would look for a follow-up within a reasonable length
of time.
MS. CHABER: Q. So you wouldn't necessarily -- If there was, say, the Surgeon General's report in 1964 and it came out on a
Saturday in January, how long did you follow the information in, say, the newspapers with respect to that?
A. It's very easy to do it, because of the indexes. All you do is look for the key words, “tobacco,” “cigarettes.”
And in the case, for example, of the Indianapolis Star -- now, I didn't look at it so intensely for this case, because, again, of the
age of the plaintiff -- the Indianapolis Star had maybe -- I'm just thinking of the printouts I had -- maybe two or three pages,
single spaced, of reports relating to the study from January through maybe the middle part of February.
And then, bang, they disappeared, and those reports were largely statewide responses to it. Occasionally, they carried statements
from cigarette companies. But by and large, the statements from the cigarette companies are going to show up if you just do
a simple index search.
Q. But I'm asking you how far you followed that.
A. Again, you follow it as far as the index leads you. In the case of Indianapolis, they had a person who had been on the '64
commission which came up with the report, and so they had endless kind of local detail about it. It didn't appear that anybody
prominent in California, at least, had served on that commission in '64.
Q. Do you know in California how far beyond, say, February of 1964 the issue of tobacco appeared in newspapers, for example?
A. I don't know, because I was zeroing in on key dates. I do know that the indexes would clearly indicate that. Anybody could
find it out.
Q. But you yourself did not go beyond those key dates and whenever the hot news of the day got dropped?
A. That's true.
Q. And so would it be fair to say then, between key dates, you didn't necessarily look to see what information, propaganda,
statements by the tobacco industry were put out there in the -- in between these key events?
MS. MASON: Object to the term “propaganda” as vague and undefined.
THE WITNESS: Outside of whatever “propaganda” may mean, I didn't, but anyone could.
It's not so important for this particular case to show the follow-up for '64. It would seem to me that you want to show that
follow-up for events in the '70s and '80s.

18Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
MS. CHABER: Q. Isn't it important to know what an individual is growing up in and what their family members may be looking
at who may have influential impact on the person?
A. Oh, yes, and I think you can knowledgeably state that her parents would have been subjected, through either the Ventura
paper or through the Ojai paper, to exactly what I've said here, a two-week heavy dose.
And then if you look at the Ventura paper, you can see that they do -- and this I read very carefully for the '70s period --
they do follow up on both state debates and local incidents. They have local columnists who are commenting, doctors who are
commenting periodically on tobacco. So there's a good deal of material there on the local level.
I can't assume one way or the other whether the parents would have been reading the L.A. Times.
MS. MASON: I want to interrupt you. When it's convenient, could we take a five-minute bathroom break?
MS. CHABER: Sure. Now is fine.
(Recess taken.)
(Record read.)
MS. CHABER: Q. Beyond the two weeks that you're talking about, the post-1964 Surgeon General's report, when was the next
time frame that you looked at?
A. Probably for California specifically.
Q. For any opinions you may render in this case, what's the next time period you looked at?
A. I then jumped to the 1969 debate here in California over TV ads. Now, there was national coverage in the L.A. Times, and
all this national coverage tends to be uniform over -- after the '64 report, over what to do about ads about cigarettes.
And there were, again, certain follow-ups with respect to other aspects of health hazards, expanding it to heart conditions or
respiratory conditions, as opposed to simply lung cancer. So there were stories off and on between '64 and '69.
But here in California, they take the issue up specifically in '69, and here in the state legislature over in Sacramento.
Q. And, so, between the beginning of 1964 when the Surgeon General report is released and the two-week time period
subsequent to that, the next time period --
A. That I focused on?
Q. -- was 1969?
A. But I took notes on what some of the other related health issues were that were being discussed nationally. And I mean
nationally, because these are AP stories that are picked up nationally in the L.A. Times, much more in the L.A. Times than
in the Chronicle.
Q. And then for what time period in 1969 did you look at the materials?

19Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. The legislative session was in the fall of '69.
Q. And then when is the next time you looked at?
A. The next time, you have the Surgeon General making a statement in '71 that he's recommending that smoking in public
buildings be banned.
And, curiously enough, in the Ventura paper in 1970, they take up the issue, and the Ojai Valley News is taking it up, because
it involves what the policy should be at the high schools in both Ventura and Ojai and at Nordhoff.
And in between '69, the legislative session, and the '71 announcement by the Surgeon General, there's a fire at the Nordhoff
High School caused by a senior smoking in a smoking lounge that's been set aside for seniors. And at that point, they stop all
smoking for seniors at Nordhoff High.
Q. They stop permitted smoking in a specific room, correct?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. You're not suggesting, for example, that Nordhoff High students didn't go outside the building and smoke?
A. Not at all.
Q. And you're not suggesting that people didn't go into the restrooms, in the bathrooms, and smoke?
A. Not at all. It's a raging controversy, from -- really, between '73 and '76 at Nordhoff, anyway, according to the local paper,
over how to handle the problem of smoking at the school.
Q. And the stopping of having a smoking lounge at the school has to do with the fact that there's a fire?
A. There's a fire.
Q. There are no statements that the smoking lounge was being shut down because these children who were smoking are going
to get lung cancer in the future, was there?
A. There would be no reason for the story to say that. The question was the school had already established a restrictive policy
on smoking for health reasons, and it wouldn't make sense for a story to say that.
Q. Well, there was a smoking lounge for seniors, was there not?
A. Uh-huh, there was.
Q. And the reason they were shut down was not the health reasons, but the fact that fire --
A. But the reason it had been set up was the health reasons.
Q. Explain that.
A. Well, if you think back to any smoking ban, the reason behind the ban is that somehow it will deleteriously affect either the
direct smoker -- that is, the smoker -- and the person in the area around the smoke. And so these bans were established on the
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
20Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
basis that both direct smoke for the person smoking and the indirect smoke or the passive smoke would be harmful, and that's
why you had, then, separate areas set up for smoking.
Q. And where is that information contained about the Nordhoff High School smoking lounge?
A. I think it's logical to assume that all of the debates in the legislature over ads or over public space and the statements by the
Surgeon General in '71 about smoking in public buildings were based on the assumption that there was a risk for both smokers
and nonsmokers coming from cigarettes.
Q. Do you have any information other than an assumption that the smoking lounge in Nordhoff High School was set up to
protect others from environmental tobacco smoke?
A. Say the question again. The first part of it, I lost.
MS. CHABER: Please reread it.
(Record read.)
THE WITNESS: Maybe I'm misperceiving the word “assumption” here.
MS. CHABER: Q. I used your word.
A. Yeah. In this instance, you've got since, what, the 1950s scientific evidence questioning cigarettes in terms of their health
hazard, and schools and public buildings and state legislatures were trying to come up with rules and guidelines based on these
scientific facts and figures about smoking.
So it seems to me that in the case of Nordhoff and Villanova High School and others, they were using their knowledge, in this
case knowledge from a scientific report, to set up these separate smoking areas. That's --
Q. Let me see --
A. Maybe I'm just not getting the word “assumption.”
Q. The first question is, you don't have any direct evidence or any information other than what you are surmising from what
you call a logical conclusion from other facts to state that the smoking lounge that was set up at Nordhoff High School was set
up because it was well-known that cigarette smoking caused health problems in nonsmokers?
A. Right, there would be no other reason to set up a separate area.
Q. That's not my question.
My question is: Do you have any specific evidence, discussion, document or otherwise, that says that?
A. Says what? That the individuals responsible for setting up the smoking lounge -- what they discussed before they set up
the smoking lounge?
Q. That the smoking lounge was set up because people were concerned at the school about the effects of second-hand smoke
on nonsmokers.

21Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. I guess the smoking lounge story in 1970 was a story about a fire, and so it wasn't about the setting up of the smoking lounge.
So the answer to your question would be that that story did not carry the information you're talking about.
Q. And you have no other information that states the purpose of the setting up of the smoking lounge?
A. Of this particular smoking lounge?
Q. Of this particular smoking lounge.
A. That's correct.
Q. And the school, up until 1970 when there was a fire as a result of somebody smoking, allowed its students to smoke, albeit
in a special room?
A. Yes.
MS. MASON: Objection, presumes facts.
MS. CHABER: Q. Now, you were a teacher?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. Did you have like a faculty room?
A. Some of the schools I taught I did.
Q. Were you allowed to smoke in class?
A. In most of the schools I taught in, you could.
Q. When you went to high school, which was where?
A. In Montana.
Q. Were you allowed to smoke in class?
A. Students were. Are you asking if students were?
Q. Was the teacher?
A. It's Montana.
Q. What does that mean?
A. It means we more openly smoke and drink down to the present day without any shame or guilt. So, no, but we were talking
just about the 1970s.
Q. The smoking lounge that existed at the high school, was there one -- you mentioned another high school?

22Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. Villanova had a much more restrictive policy. They -- From the story, at least, it appeared -- this is again for this one year
of 1970 -- they had banned smoking, period.
Q. In the building?
A. In the building.
Q. But they did not ban smoking on the school grounds, did they?
A. I don't know. That story didn't reflect that.
Q. So is it fair to say you don't have -- I take that back. Was there information given in that story relating to Villanova as to
why they had banned smoking?
A. No.
Q. Banned it, that is, in the building?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. And other than the story relating to the fire and the banning of smoking, the smoking lounge --
A. Lounge.
Q. -- you do not have any other specific information with respect to either of those two schools and their smoking policy?
A. For 1970.
Q. Do you have for other years?
A. Again, I read the local newspapers for the entire decade, and between 1973 and 1976 there is discussion, especially in the
Ojai Valley News, about the discussion going on at Nordhoff High School among the administrators over how to implement
state guidelines on smoking.
Q. And what were the state guidelines at the time?
A. The guidelines --
Q. Go ahead. I'm listening.
A. -- were complicated, because they -- as far as the high schools themselves were concerned, because they were -- they reflected
this state policy on high school hygiene, and textbooks, and consequently, the discussions -- it was actually brought out in some
of the newspaper accounts that what the teachers were teaching the students from these hygiene textbooks about the risks of
smoking was perhaps contradicting the school's smoking policies, and especially contradicting the teachers who were smoking,
and so it was a fairly interesting and thorough discussion that the local paper reported on about the administrators going round
and round over these issues.

23Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
And in this instance, between '73 and '76, when the plaintiff was at this particular high school, they discussed smoking laws and
other areas or specific designations for where one could smoke, and the student newspaper itself also commented on the fact
that the bathrooms were becoming unbearable because of the smoke. They seemed to prefer, in this time period, a smoking law.
Q. So the smoking was something that was going on at the school?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. The plaintiff wasn't the only teenager who was doing that smoking at the school?
A. No.
Q. In fact, there were -- sounds like enough teenagers doing it that there actually needed to be a place designated for them to do it?
A. I think the answer is yes.
Q. And the students weren't stopped from smoking other than in certain places, is that correct?
A. Yes. But there were very strict rules and regulations that Nordhoff had established for first time caught, second time caught,
third time caught. There were suspensions handed out.
Q. But that was if you were caught in an undesignated place, correct?
A. Right.
Q. But there were places that were designated on the school grounds where students could go and smoke, correct?
MS. MASON: Objection, presumes facts.
THE WITNESS: They were discussing setting up a designated area. Apparently, it had become a real problem.
MS. CHABER: Q. And from that you would imply that there was more than one person who was doing the smoking at the
school?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Do you know what the most popular brand of choice among teenagers in the 1970s was?
A. I don't. I could venture a guess, but I don't know specifically.
Q. Do you know what brands Philip Morris makes?
A. I know roughly what brands they were making.
Q. What do you know?
A. I think probably I should back off from that. I don't want to guess about the specific brands for the '70s.

24Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. Do you know whether any of the brands that Philip Morris made in the 1970s -- not whether, but what percentage of teenagers
smoked those brands?
A. Teenagers, at least in this particular case, seemed to be smoking Camels, by and large.
Q. And what's the basis of that?
A. Simply from the depositions that I read.
Q. You don't see anywhere where the plaintiff said that all the teenagers were smoking Marlboros?
A. Marlboros as well, but she went on to smoke Camel Lights, and Marlboros were mentioned, but I think she started with
Camels.
Q. You read the plaintiff's deposition?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. Is that what your notes -- some of your notes are?
A. No. I highlight the deposition. The notes are largely from the material in the boxes.
Q. I see notes here that relate to the deposition.
A. Yeah, the Leonard Whittaker deposition, I decided to take some notes on, but largely because I didn't have access to a
highlighter.
Q. And do you have the highlighted testimony with you?
A. I don't have it with me, no. I have it back at the hotel.
MS. CHABER: Can that be provided, Counsel?
MS. MASON: Yes.
MS. CHABER: And it probably won't come up, but I may need to do some further questioning on the significance of the
highlighting. So if there's some way on some break we can get somebody to get it, that might speed things up.
MS. MASON: I'll see if we can't do that. I don't know if I agree to a further deposition, but I'll see if I can't get you that depo.
MS. CHABER: Q. And the notes that you took on the materials in the boxes are going to have to be discussed, since, no criticism
intended, but would you agree that one looking at that this particular page might not know what it says?
A. It's a flaw in my note-taking. This isn't unusual.
Q. So you didn't just do it to annoy me?
A. No, not at all.

A. You can look back at my research on Nixon or any other topic and find similar notes. The computer has made me slightly
tidier.
Q. Do you have any computer notes related to this case?
A. No, I don't.
Q. No such luck?
A. No.
MS. CHABER: We will mark this as Plaintiff's 3.
(Exhibit 3 marked.)
MS. CHABER: Q. I need to go into this because I can't read most of it, but let's go back to the time frames.
You said the next time frame was the '70, '71. Did you look at the entire decade of the 1970s with respect to that index you
can go to and get the word “tobacco” or “cigarette”?
A. I looked at it for the L.A. Times, seeing if it's something -- in this instance, if there was something -- I was using --
When one does this kind of research, you try to be as efficient as possible, and I focused first -- Well, I knew what I was looking
for in the L.A. Times and the Chronicle in terms of national issues, and so then what I did was say, “Well, what was being
reported or what was happening in the local newspapers,” which were more apt to have been read by the plaintiff; and looking
at those, then, I went back to the L.A. Times to see how they covered these same issues.
I tried to see if there was much coverage of what was happening in Ventura, either the county or the city, or in Ojai, but that
didn't seem to be the case. So I used the local newspapers for that decade to see what was being commented on there and then
worked backwards to the national ones.
Q. And is there a copy of every one of the articles from the local newspapers contained within these five boxes that relates
to tobacco or cigarettes?
A. I can't absolutely say that every one, but it seemed a fairly good selection of articles on tobacco, especially local issues that
wouldn't have made any kind of international event or headlines.
Q. What other local issues besides this fire at Nordhoff High School?
A. Some of this sounds silly, but I think it's important if you're living in a small community, and it's probably the kind of thing
you would read:
There were two local doctors in the Ojai paper, a Dr. John Nelson, and a Dr. George -- Meldig was the name, M-e-l-d-i-g. There
was also one for the Ventura paper, Dr. Lamb. And they were like “Dear Abbies” for the day, or that local area, and they would
take questions on anything. And those -- the columns, or the answers they wrote on tobacco questions, were in this collection.

26Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
That's fairly obscure, but I think people tend to read those columns, as opposed to reading a news story. You tend to go to
“Dear Abby” and read it.
Q. Do you know whether the plaintiff did?
A. Not to my knowledge, from the ones I read. I tend to look at the names, and her name, the birth name nor the married
name, appeared.
Otherwise, it was a local couple -- this was in Ventura -- who went around with a portable fan, once the passive smoke issue
became an issue, turning the fan on people who were smoking in restaurants.
Q. Do you know whether the plaintiff ever read any of those articles?
A. As an expert witness looking at this material, no. One never knows what is being read by anyone. But all I can report on
is what was being talked about in these newspapers.
Q. Which may or may not have been read by the plaintiff or any of her family members?
A. Yes.
Q. And what other depos, besides the plaintiff and her husband?
A. I read hers. I read her father's. I didn't read as carefully the first husband's -- Dean Moore, I guess it is -- and then I looked
at the three siblings' depositions, Rebecca, Kenneth and Michael.
Q. Did you look at Christine's?
A. I don't think I had Christine's, or I would have looked at it. It might have been missing. I didn't have it.
Q. Did you take any notes on those other depositions?
A. Huh-uh, huh-uh.
Q. Are they highlighted?
A. I think the husband's might not be, first husband's might not be. I think the others are.
Q. And those also would be back in your hotel room?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. What's the next event time period that you looked at?
A. Well, as I say, I was looking at the local coverage, which was extensive, on the American Cancer Society's branch unit,
which was very active. There were ads about -- on smoking clinics.
MS. MASON: The question is, what was the next time period?
THE WITNESS: And so the next time period was 1978, Proposition 5.

27Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
MS. CHABER: Q. And do you know where the plaintiff was in 1978?
A. She had just -- She left high school in '76, and may have at that time still been with her husband in Virginia.
Q. And what was Prop. 5?
A. Well, it was the proposition to deal with passive smoke in public buildings.
Q. And did you look at only the proponents of Proposition 5 materials?
A. No. Going to the Chronicle and the San Francisco -- or the Los Angeles Times, you would see more or less full coverage
of the pros and cons of the issue.
Q. And there were cons of the issue that were widely publicized?
A. Widely publicized during a very short period of time just before the vote.
Q. Do you know how much the tobacco industry spent on anti-Prop. 5 announcements, releases?
MS. MASON: Objection, it presumes facts.
THE WITNESS: Presumes what?
MS. MASON: Facts not in evidence.
THE WITNESS: I don't know the exact figures. The stories were quite clear that they spent money.
MS. CHABER: Q. A lot of money?
A. Yeah, in that concentrated time.
Q. A lot more money than the health community was spending during that same time period?
MS. MASON: Objection, presumes facts not in evidence.
THE WITNESS: That I wouldn't know.
MS. CHABER: Q. Do you know whether there was any television time devoted to the tobacco industry's position on Prop. 5?
A. No, I don't.
Q. Have you looked at any documents, books, articles that discuss the tobacco industry's response to initiatives such as Prop.
5 with respect to tobacco?
A. I have read most of the major secondary source literature on the tobacco industry -- that is, books that have come out in
the last, what, 25 years -- and the very last one, that I read at least, by a fellow named Hills, is his last name, I think his first
name is called Phillip Hills, called “Smoke Ring.”

28Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. The one that won the Pulitzer prize?
A. Yes. The New York Times reporter is the only one that I know of that deals with propositions in California.
Q. Have you gone to the University of California San Francisco library and looked at their tobacco archives with respect to
tobacco industry responses to Prop. 5 or any other tobacco initiative?
A. No.
Q. Are you aware that they have an archive of information that relates specifically to the tobacco industry's response to various
initiatives in California with respect to tobacco?
A. Yes.
Q. And you have not looked at any of that?
A. I have not.
Q. And are you aware that it's available over the Internet?
A. Yes.
Q. And you have not looked at that?
A. I have not looked at that.
Q. And have you ever met with any of the people who are studying and researching those issues at UCSF, such as Stanton
Glance or others in his department?
A. No, I have not.
Q. Have you discussed with anyone involved in California in the politics of tobacco initiatives, anyone on either side?
A. In any time period?
Q. In any time period. That would have related to those issues. I don't mean -- There might be somebody that company --
A. I left the state in '76. I think the answer to that is no, the props came after that.
Q. And have you read any journal articles that discuss the tobacco industry's political response to any of the California initiatives?
A. Journal articles as opposed to monographs or books?
Q. Right.
A. No is the answer.
Q. And the books, the only one that you could cite me to was “The Smoke Screen”?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
29Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. That's the only one that I've read of the material I've looked at that does discuss the propositions here.
Q. Okay. And you mentioned monographs, so I should ask you about that, as well.
A. Well, the standard works on tobacco that we are all in this room, I think, familiar with.
Q. I don't know what ones you're familiar with, and I don't want to presume, so why don't you tell me which ones you mean.
A. All right. As far as what historians consider to be either legitimately researched and historical studies of tobacco industry,
there weren't many before the 1970s, and so you do -- I looked in earlier periods for monographs on tobacco, but by and large
they are anecdotal, they are before the scientific evidence begins to come in, and they are not important, I think, for a witness
like myself to gather hard data from.
So I started in the 1970s with Susan Wagner's book on “Cigarette Country.”
Q. I didn't hear you.
A. “Cigarette Country” is the name of it.
That was in 1971. In 1971, a fellow named Thomas Whiteside also published a book called “Selling Death.” It was mainly a
diatribe against tobacco advertising.
So that until the 1990s --
And there are books in between, if you want me to mention them --
Q. Any ones that you --
A. Until the 1990s, Susan Wagner's book was considered the kind of standard history of the industry.
Q. And do you know how much access Miss Wagner had to internal tobacco company documents?
A. She had some access for early records, because she does go back to the 19th century. And the book coming out in 1971
would have meant that her research would have stopped probably in 1965.
Q. And do you know whether or not she had any internal tobacco industry documents --
A. For the what period?
Q. For the period before she wrote her book.
A. She had access to private papers, I think, such as existed on what's his name, Washington Duke, for the late 19th century.
I doubt very much, because most company records are not open for the contemporary period, that she had any access for the
'50s and '60s.
Q. And do you know if she had any access to any of the documents of the -- of the advertising agencies related to the tobacco
industry?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
30Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. The question's a little broad for me to answer. I don't know what documents she would have wanted from them, from the
advertising agencies, or would have been necessary for her to have.
Q. Do you know what documents she would have had as to the tobacco company's actions with respect to the 1964 Surgeon
General's report?
A. No, not offhand. I mean, she would have had the normal kinds of reports and studies, but other than that, I don't know if she
had any particular privileged access, if that's what you're asking.
Q. Do you know whether or not she had any internal tobacco industry documents that related to the actions that they took with
respect to the 1964 Surgeon General's report?
A. No, I don't know.
Q. And I think you'd gotten to 1970. What other monographs or books?
A. Maybe -- To make a long story short, what happens from the '70s forward into the '80s is that if you look at Whiteside's
relatively simplistic interpretation that it's the advertising that's driving the smoking, to Wagner's relatively even-handed history,
historians and political scientists who get interested in this begin to make the picture look more complex. That's what we are
largely paid to do.
That is, you start with a simplistic thesis and you say, no, the issue must be more complex than that. And so the books that
began to come out then in largely the 1980s, by Michael Schudson or Robert Sobel, ending in 1993 with John Burnham's book,
“Bad Habits,” tended to be -- to represent the new -- the relatively new field of history known as “cultural social history.”
And so what they did, and others like them, were to write articles and ultimately monographs showing how complex the factors
are which enter into the picture for why people either start to smoke or how they perceive tobacco products.
And they, in essence, turn the cigarette into a cultural icon. That's a shorthand way of saying that it represents all kinds of very
interesting things to a society and its use in cultural and habitual cultural ways that tell us a lot about how we live.
And so that was the trend within history until the 1990s, when you begin to get then a slightly different type of literature, though
it still contains this cultural and social element with Richard Kruger's book with Glance -- which isn't really an interpretive
book; it's a publication based on documents, reprints the documents -- and then this one I mentioned earlier, Phillip Hill's book,
“Smoke Screen.”
Q. And the reason that those books in the late 1990s have a different bent is because all of a sudden for the first time millions
of internal cigarette company documents are now available to be analyzed, correct?
MS. MASON: Objection, foundation, argumentative, presumes facts.
THE WITNESS: Some of them focus on those. Kruger's book doesn't really focus that much on them. Glance is just a
reproduction of them.
MS. CHABER: Q. You're talking about the cigarette papers?
A. Yeah, uh-huh.
Q. Stan Glance has written other things, as well, hasn't he?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
31Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. Yeah.
Q. And you've read those on tobacco?
A. I've only read one article that he wrote in '95 in the Journal of the American Medical.
Q. Which one is that?
A. It's on passive secondary smoke.
MS. CHABER: Can I have my earlier question read back that was then objected to?
(Record read.)
THE WITNESS: Are you asking me to answer that question again? Did I answer it?
MS. CHABER: Q. You gave an answer which I didn't think was responsive. I think you answered a slightly different question.
MS. MASON: Same objections, and I'm going to add asked and answered. All right.
THE WITNESS: With respect to those three books, one could only say that's true of Glance.
MS. CHABER: Q. With respect to this even-handed history that you say Susan Wagner wrote, what makes you call it “even-
handed”?
A. Within the profession, and my own career has had to deal with this, we try to teach and then we try to practice using facts
and data that we gather. And keep in mind, as historians, we gather aggregate data. We are not interested in the exception as
much as we are in the generality that we can gather from data.
When, in some instances, you find a set of facts that perhaps surprises you in terms of maybe some original hypotheses, that
you honestly and fairly evaluate that and report it. And on those grounds, her book initially and Kruger's, as well, which has
now superseded hers to a large degree, was considered to be, again, a fairly even-handed account, in that it wasn't either pro or
antitobacco necessarily, or pro or antismoking. It falls somewhere in the middle, based on the evidence that they have gathered.
And that's what I mean by “even-handed.”
Q. You would agree that Ms. Wagner did not have available to her any of the internal documents of the tobacco companies
that weren't released until the late 1990s?
A. Oh, yes, but that doesn't necessarily disqualify the book as a fairly accurate account of the industry and of smoking habits
-- or smoking statistics -- anyway, up to the 1950s.
Q. But having access to certain information can change one's perception of events that occur, correct?
A. Generally speaking. But again, within the historical profession, we are trained not to overreact to, you know, single
documents, or a particularly flamboyant or let's say controversial set of documents. Let me give you an example that has nothing
to do with the case.

32Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
The current books and controversy over McCarthyism in this country and documents recently received from or gotten out of
the Soviet Union, these are probably almost completely undigested documents on which these very popular books are being
based right now.
This is not considered good historical practice. You want to be able to know the context of a document, whether it's complete,
whether it was bought, whether it was stolen, how -- its provenance, really.
And without knowing that, I don't know -- As a professional historian, I would suggest that these millions of tobacco documents
have not been thoroughly digested by anyone. And so they exist, they are controversial, and they have influenced some of the
works, but not all of them.
Q. And when you say they haven't been digested by anyone, are you speaking specifically of the books that you've mentioned
or is that a general statement?
A. It's both general and specific. The amount of material is so large, as you've mentioned, and the fact that these books were
written when they were makes -- there hasn't been time for that kind of digestive process for that to go on.
Q. Haven't there been articles written by medical doctors in the medical journals that have analyzed the internal previously-
unavailable tobacco industry documents with respects to certain issues like nicotine and whether or not it's addictive?
A. I don't know. I haven't read those articles.
Q. You'd agree, though, as a general proposition, that it would be important to consider the information that exists out there,
whether or not ultimately you reject it as being valid or --
A. I'm only speaking of the time factor involved. It's very difficult to analyze vast quantities of raw data quickly, as a historian.
Maybe scientists can do it better or more quickly, but historians can't.
Q. Have you looked at, gone to, gone on the Web or otherwise looked at internal documents of the tobacco industry located
at the Minnesota repository?
A. No, I have not.
Q. Have you looked at any documents with respect to an organization called “Hill & Knowlton”?
A. No.
Q. Have you looked at any documents with respect to an organization called the Tobacco Industry Research Committee?
A. Start the first part.
Q. TIRC, T-I-R-C?
A. I know that.
Q. Have you looked at any documents related to TIRC?
A. In what time period? This time period?

33Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. Ever.
A. Well -- No, I haven't looked at any documents. I have seen some published reports or -- published reports on the institute,
Tobacco Institute.
Q. What have you seen?
A. Only what the newspapers of the '50s reported.
Q. Have you looked at any documents from the Tobacco Institute?
A. Internal documents or private documents?
Q. Documents from the Tobacco Institute.
A. Maybe we are having a problem with the term “documents.”
Q. Whether they are internal or external documents --
A. Well, documents are private documents. Newspaper accounts are public reports. They are not considered documents.
Q. Do you know whether or not the Tobacco Institute released pamphlets to the public?
A. Not specifically.
Q. I take it you've never seen one, if that's the answer?
A. Yes.
Q. And have you ever looked at any Tobacco Institute documents, whether available to the public or not?
A. I think I should say no to that.
Q. Have you looked at any Council for Tobacco Research documents?
A. No.
Q. Have you looked at any publications from the Tobacco Institute?
A. Again, “publications” meaning?
Q. Something --
A. Pamphlets?
Q. Published in whatever form. I don't want to restrict it to pamphlets.
A. No, outside of newspaper reports or statements by them.

34Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. And generally there's some effort made by journalists to give two sides to a story, if there purportedly are two sides?
A. We go back to what I said earlier. There is a formula for writing stories. I was once a journalism major, and the formula I
think still applies today, and that is the most important information first, and what you consider less important dribbles off to
the last part of it, and that means then that very seldom does a headline-making story contain, in an “even-handed” or equal
fashion, both sides.
If you've got a headline that says “Surgeon General Reports Cigarettes Cause Lung Cancer,” that story is going to be dominated
in the very first part and in the second page coverage of it by what that headline says.
Q. And then if you have a headline that says “The Tobacco Institute Says That the Scientific Evidence Has Not Proven That
Cigarette Smoking Causes These Diseases,” there might be something further down in that article by a health official, saying
“That's a lot of baloney,” that won't get read?
A. Well, if that's the headline, then that story will largely concentrate on the statement from the Tobacco Institute, and probably
at the end say “This is in response to a Surgeon General's report,” or some other -- the recommendation for banning smoking
in public places.
Q. Do you have contained within any of these five boxes any articles on which the headline is the tobacco industry's viewpoint?
A. I saw several in the L.A. Times right after the '64 report. They were, you know, back in the back section of the paper. They
didn't make the front page, they weren't the headline of the day, but they did carry a couple of what would be considered short
items on the tobacco industry's position with a headline. The Tobacco Institute, I'll correct myself.
Q. Did you see any advertisements or statements by the Tobacco Institute or any of the tobacco companies setting forth the
reason that the Surgeon General was incorrect?
A. That's a broad question. You mean immediately after the '64?
Q. At any time after the '64.
A. At any time?
Q. Like even a month ago.
MS. MASON: Can I have that question read back? I just missed it.
(Record read.)
THE WITNESS: Again, it's such a broad question, I almost have to have a time frame on it. I don't -- It's worded somewhat
extremely, that the Surgeon General was incorrect. I think that that would be very unlikely for even the Tobacco Institute to
contemplate. It's too extreme. Their statements tended to be, I think, much more subtle than that.
MS. CHABER: Q. What statements have you seen?
A. The one I think that comes to mind, and again has little to do with this case, is the Frank statement of January 1954.
Q. What do you think is intemperate about it?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
35Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. It isn't. That's what I'm saying. So that's why I answered “no” to your question about saying that the Surgeon General was
wrong, incorrect.
Q. You believe that a statement that says “Our products are not injurious to health” is a moderate statement?
A. I think in the context of that entire statement, it is, yes, because you're citing only one sentence from it.
Q. Why do you say that? Explain what you mean.
A. Well, I had to look at the document very carefully, and for one thing, it was in part written by Gaylord Hill, who had been
one of the doctors in England conducting the studies which led to the publicity in the 1950s over the health risks.
And the statement says very specifically that “Distinguished scientists have participated in these studies, and we think that their
conclusions are inconclusive.”
And you have to read -- I practically have the thing memorized -- fairly far down in the document, to get the statement you're
saying. It is both, I think, mild-mannered in its wording and absolutely boring in its content, if you were just the average citizen
looking at that one-shot statement in 1954.
Q. What's your evidence that Gaylord Hill wrote that document?
A. It came from Susan Wagner's book.
Q. Are you aware of any archives that have been opened subsequent to Susan Wagner's book that establish who exactly wrote
that document?
A. No.
(Ms. McFadden leaves deposition.)
MS. CHABER: Q. But in your mind it was written by a scientist, correct?
A. No. I'm saying that he was consulted in the writing of it and he was consulted in the setting up of the Tobacco Industry
Research Committee and, in fact, I think he was one of the first scientists that pointed to it to work on it.
Q. And the source of that information is Susan Wagner's book?
A. It's one of the sources. I mean, I do specifically -- I know specifically the Hill connection with the '54 report.
I think the other information about him and other prominent cancer scientists being involved in the committee's work could
have come from other sources.
Q. Do you know who John Hill is?
A. Well, I do know a John Hill, but it's from -- or I know of a John Hill, but the name in connection with my research on
tobacco comes from the year 1761.
Is that the one you're thinking of?

36Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. No.
A. Okay.
Q. And you're not familiar with an organization called “Hill & Knowlton”?
A. You mentioned it before, and I'm not.
Q. And I take it, then, you've never looked at the archives of Hill & Knowlton specifically with respect to the Frank statement?
A. No, I have not.
MS. CHABER: Now I need a bathroom break.
MS. MASON: Sure.
(Recess taken.)
MS. CHABER: Q. We've got three exhibits already marked and I guess this is a fourth, which is your 1999 billing records. I
see you've listed some hours and the information --
A. Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Q. -- that those hours entailed, is that correct?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. What rate are those hours charged at?
A. 125 an hour.
Q. Since beginning -- Since your beginning business relationship with Shook, Hardy & Bacon, attorneys on behalf of the tobacco
companies, how much either time or money have you billed?
A. I can't say time, but it's been between 23, $24,000.
Q. Each year, or total?
A. No, no, no, total.
Q. And those 23 to 24,000 were -- does that include the 42.9 hours listed --
A. It actually does, yes.
Q. And does that 23 to $24,000 reflect basically your work on the three cases?
A. Yes.
MS. CHABER: You didn't by any chance get somebody to get the depos?

37Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
MS. MASON: I didn't think about it.
THE WITNESS: There's a slight problem there. They are probably scattered in a large handbag that I'm carrying and my
suitcase. They are easily retrievable, but they may not all be together. I just kind of dumped them in two different places this
morning. You can have them any time.
MS. CHABER: We will figure out --
MS. MASON: Maybe we should step outside and talk about it. Let's take a real quick break.
(Recess taken.)
MS. CHABER: Back on the record.
Q. Why, I was curious about a comment you made in one of your prior -- I'm not sure if it was testimony or deposition, when
you were talking about the two Quaker presidents that you had particularly studied, and you gave a “Thank God” comment that
there sort of were only two Quaker presidents, and I was curious as to what that was about.
A. It wasn't just that they were Quaker. They were Republican, Quaker, unpopular presidents, and I have a monopoly on that
field. I don't think we will ever get any more that have those qualifications or those characteristics.
Q. I wasn't sure what the “Thank God” was.
A. Presidential studies are hard to do, and especially if you do unpopular presidents.
MS. MASON: You just don't want to have to do another study of those guys?
THE WITNESS: No.
MS. CHABER: Q. When you did your studies on Nixon, you had the benefit of internal papers?
A. Yes, as long as they weren't related to foreign policy, which are classified.
Q. And you had the benefit of the tapes?
A. Some tapes were opened. It's complicated. They began to open them in 1991. My book came out in '94, so I had access to
early tapes; not the ones, obviously, since '91.
Q. Did you find internal papers to have some impact on your ideas?
A. Generally, yes, because what you do when you study a president or write a biography -- I was studying presidential policies
-- you want to find out how decisions were reached, and that's next to impossible to do from public statements.
And the only reason you want to find that out is, depending on the president, he is either in charge of matters or he's not in
charge of matters, and in this case I found out that Nixon was, indeed, in charge.
Q. How much analysis have you done into tobacco industry advertising?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
38Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. I really haven't. My job, so to speak, in these cases, has been to look at and try to analyze and interpret common information
and perceptions about the product and about the industry, and not the industry itself.
Q. Doesn't advertising have an effect on information --
A. It does. I'm not an advertising expert, and so I looked at ads like any average person would, to get a reaction or respond
to them.
Q. But you cannot render expert opinion about what the effect of advertising is vis-a-vis knowledge with respect to tobacco?
A. No.
Q. Do you look at cartoons as a basis for popular information?
A. I did, especially for the earlier cases. I looked at more then than I have for this one. There were time constraints on what I
was looking at here. But yes, I have looked at cartoons.
Q. Have you looked at any cartoons with respect to tobacco and any tobacco industry positions or viewpoints, as opposed to
information about health risks?
A. I don't think I understand what you're saying. Cartoons -- What kind of cartoons?
Q. That relate to tobacco industry statements or viewpoints or perceptions of the world.
A. That would have been issued or drawn by the companies themselves?
Q. No. You're right, that was confusing.
Well, first of all, have you looked at any cartoons drawn by anybody or made by anyone? Cartoons could be more than a
newspaper-type thing. It could be -- My kid watches Saturday morning cartoons. Have you looked at any cartoons with respect
to smoking and public smoking?
A. Print cartoons and audio or audio-visual cartoons, cartoon cartoons?
Q. Yes.
A. Animated cartoons?
Q. Yes, that was the word I was looking for.
A. I've looked at both, but not for this case.
Q. What ones, in terms of animated cartoons, have you looked at?
A. What I looked at several years ago were the old, I think they were Goofy cartoons, among other things, beginning in about
the late '30s, that directly addressed the subject of smoking.
Q. Do you ever watch the old cartoons of the Flintstones during the time period when there was tobacco advertising on TV?

39Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. No, I have not.
Q. Can you state for me in some summary form what your opinions are with respect to this case?
MS. MASON: Objection, that's pretty vague and overbroad.
But you can answer that, to the best you can,
MS. CHABER: That's how Jeff first started out his questioning to Alan Smith yesterday.
THE WITNESS: Again, it is hard to answer it. The reason I'm here is to try to indicate what I think the mass media material
and other evidence that I've looked at says about common knowledge for the decades, basically, of the '70s, '80s, and maybe
into the '90s. So I don't have an opinion about the case. I simply have an opinion about what was out there during the time
period that would be relevant to this plaintiff.
MS. CHABER: Q. Well, tell me that.
A. That there was an abundance of evidence or indication of -- from popular media, from newspapers, from material we normally
look at, to determine common knowledge or mainstream interpretations.
That if you look at California and then narrow it to Ventura County and Ventura and Ojai, there was an abundance of information
out there about the hazards of smoking, and it gets more abundant as you go more local.
Q. And presumably, it gets more abundant as you get closer in time to the present?
A. Yes.
Q. And the materials from which you have gathered this opinion are contained within the five boxes sitting in this room?
A. Plus the earlier work I did, because all research is cumulative, and so I would have had some ideas from earlier materials. I
mean, they are still in my head. From that, and from what I knew of the other cases and other evidence I looked at.
Q. And does there exist somewhere the documents and materials upon which you relied in those two other cases?
A. Not that I have access to right now.
Q. And what did that consist of, that material?
A. Well, some of it was material gathered by my graduate students when I was at Indiana, a couple of whom went on to write
articles actually on the subject, and so I would not have kept that material.
Q. Who wrote articles and what were they?
A. I have one graduate student named Gayle Fischer who published, in a cultural history magazine, an article that had to deal
with women reformers and their activities in the last quarter of the 19th century. And she was interested in dress reform, and
after that she got interested in political reform and the position of women on a variety of topics like alcohol and tobacco.
Q. And what's the name of the article?

40Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. I don't know the name of the article. Her name is Gayle Fischer.
Q. G-a-i-l?
A. G-a-y-l-e.
Q. Fischer?
A. Fischer.
Q. F-i-s-c-h-e-r?
A. Yes.
Q. There's a C?
A. Yes.
And I have a graduate student --
Q. Before you go on, is this a journal?
A. It's a -- Journal of Popular Culture, I think is the title of it. It's not one of the major national journals, but I think it's called
the Journal of National Culture.
And I have a graduate student working now, named Matthew Flynn, who may or may not publish something from the Ohio
material. He helped me do the research for the State of Ohio.
Q. But he hasn't published anything to date?
A. Huh-uh.
Q. And have you published anything?
A. On?
Q. These issues.
A. No.
Q. Why not?
A. I haven't published on a lot of topics I've researched, largely for reasons of time constraints, or simply that I move on to other
topics before there's time for me to really digest and go over the material.
I have a lot of material on the origins of the Cold War. I have a lot of material comparing Nixon to Andrew Jackson. And when
you have a career like I do, you have to be kind of savvy about the field and the area that you're researching, and the tobacco
area is one where you have -- it's such an abundance of information out there, that it's like the origins of the Cold War: There

41Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
was such an abundance of information and publications, that there was no point for me to try to step into that and compete
in any significant way.
So you go on from topic to topic, and occasionally you'll hit a topic that you think you can fill a gap. And with respect to this
research and the Cold War research, I didn't think I'd be able to contribute significantly to an area that's so well-researched
and published.
Q. Now, you've looked at women's issues. Have you looked at women's issues specific to tobacco?
A. I have not -- No, is the answer.
Q. Have you looked at whether or not there was a cultural phenomenon related to women beginning to smoke?
A. That, I looked into. It jumps out at you, if you've done any research on women, how sexist the textbooks may be, or the
stereotypes about women and smoking. So in that sense, in reading this material, especially from the 20s and '30s, it was really
-- or even the 1890s -- it's basically very offensive, because women are stereotyped with respect to smoking.
Q. Have you looked at the issue of women and smoking with respect to things in this century? I guess we won't get to say that
very much longer. For example, the rise of women smoking in the 1930s and 1940s?
A. Yes, I did, for the previous cases.
Q. Okay. To what do you attribute women beginning to smoke in the 1930s and '40s?
A. They actually began to smoke in the 1920s because of, largely, the cultural phenomenon known as the Jazz Age, the flappers
and all of the cultural changes that came after the First World War affecting women.
And what you find is, in some of the studies I mentioned earlier, where they are looking to advertising, is that women began
to smoke before ads encouraging women or showing women smoking ever appeared, and they did so because of that Jazz Age
era in which the flappers and the music and the smoking and the drinking of illegal alcohol became a way of life, for younger
women, especially.
Q. Have you looked at the issue of women and smoking with respect to the point in time when consumption of cigarettes by
women begins its rise?
MS. MASON: I'm going to object on the time period, assuming that we know when that --
THE WITNESS: Say it again. I didn't get the first part.
(Record read.)
THE WITNESS: Have I looked at women smoking in terms of consumption -- I guess the answer is yes. I mean, I only looked
at women when I was looking at materials which clearly either spoke about women or implicitly discriminated against them
in some way.
MS. CHABER: Q. Have you looked at any information with respect to at what point in time the percentage of women smoking
begins to increase?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
42Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. The answer is no, because I wasn't doing a gender-based analysis any time for my work here. If I saw polls or if polls
indicated the gender difference, then I might have noted that, but I wasn't looking for that specifically.
Q. Have you looked at women and smoking with respect to the women's movement in the 1960s?
A. No.
Q. Have you looked at advertising campaigns by any of the tobacco companies geared towards the feminist movement in the
1960s and '70s?
MS. MASON: Objection, foundation.
THE WITNESS: I've looked at ads for that time.
MS. CHABER: Q. I mean, you're familiar with the Virginia Slims?
A. And “You've Come A Long Way Baby,” yes.
Q. Would you agree that whole campaign of Virginia Slims and “You've come a long way baby” is addressing the cultural
phenomenon of the feminist movement in the 1960s and '70s?
A. The cultural phenomenon of the feminist movement in the 1960s. It certainly addressed women very generally in the 1960s.
I hesitate to say it addressed the cultural phenomenon of feminism. For one thing, “You've Come A Long Way Baby” is sexist,
and I think most conscious feminists in the '60s did not like that slogan.
Q. But it was used by them?
A. Well, it was dropped, too. So, generally speaking, those ads were geared to women: Whether they were geared towards
feminists of the period is another question. You're looking at one of them, so I resented most of those ads.
Q. With respect to the influence of religion on tobacco use in this country, would you agree that religion, at least at the beginning
of the century, played a role in negative articles about tobacco?
A. That religion played a role?
Q. Yes.
A. Religion certainly did, yes, but not necessarily always geared toward women.
Q. No, no. There was no semicolon between those.
Can you tell me, in your opinion, given the abundance, I believe was your terminology, of evidence that was available, what
would account for the increase of consumption of cigarettes over the same time period that this information was available in
the '70s and '80s?
A. So we are talking about the '70s and '80s?
Q. And let's be clear, since somebody may be reading this in some other time period, the 1970s and 1980s.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
43Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. So say the question again.
Q. What would you -- In your opinion, what accounts for the increase in consumption of cigarettes in the 1970s and '80s, given
the abundance of evidence that you say exists on the health risks?
MS. MASON: I'm going to object. Speculation, beyond her area of expertise.
THE WITNESS: I guess it is. You'd have to break it down, and even then I couldn't answer it in terms of age groups, whether
you're talking about teenagers or older. It's really something I can't answer.
MS. CHABER: Q. With respect to the 1970s and people under the age of 18 during that time period, what would account for
the increase in the amount and incidence of smoking among those teenagers, given the abundance of evidence regarding the
health risks?
MS. MASON: Same objections. I'm also going to add foundation and presuming facts.
THE WITNESS: Again, it would be hard to say. You could only -- From the literature I looked at, if you look at Senior
Scholastic, they indicate in the 1970s why teenagers say they are smoking.
MS. CHABER: Q. And why do they say they are smoking?
A. For all of the same reasons they said they were smoking back, really, in the earlier periods. Peer pressure is the largest or
the most important reason. They say it's because -- and occasionally this does reflect answers from girls more than boys -- it's
part of the costume, it's part of the “look,” it relaxes them, it makes them feel adult, makes them feel mature.
It's amazing how consistent these are over time when students are actually asked. And in the earlier time period, in the '20s and
'30s, very often they would say it was for diet, to diet, and I think that's still a reason today, but it doesn't come out as clearly.
Q. Do you know where the concept that smoking a cigarette might help with dieting comes from?
A. It goes back to the 1930s -- or 1920s, I should say, in that time period. It fit the flapper costume.
Q. And also didn't it fit the advertising of the time, which said “Reach for a cigarette instead of a treat”?
MS. MASON: Objection, foundation.
THE WITNESS: It fit that example that you gave, yes. But again, keep in mind women started smoking before those kinds
of ads were around.
MS. CHABER: Q. How many women started smoking before those ads were around? What was the percentage of the population
that were women that were smoking before those ads were around?
A. I don't know.
Q. Do you know what the percentage was of the population of women that were smoking after those ads were around?
A. No.

44Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. Do you know what the root of teenagers -- teenage women who started smoking in the birth cohort of 1959 to 1965, do you
know what percentage of women within that birth cohort began smoking?
A. No.
Q. Do you know what percentage of women in that birth cohort continued to smoke?
A. No.
Q. Do you know whether or not teenage smoking has been on the rise in the 1990s?
A. Do I know -- Again. I sort of blocked on the first part of the question.
Q. Do you know whether teenage smoking has been on the increase in the 1990s?
A. From what I've read, yes is the answer.
Q. And if I understood your answer earlier, it's not within your expertise to opine as to why that is?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. Is that correct?
A. That's correct. Yes.
Q. So your opinions with respect to the availability of this common knowledge and information regarding the health risks does
not extend to your determining why it is then that, given all of that, there has been a rise in teenage smoking, is that true?
A. That's true.
Q. What was the Organization of American Historians of which you were the chief executive officer?
A. Well, it still exists, at least.
Q. Okay.
A. It's the largest national organization representing historians of U.S. history.
Q. But you're not still --
A. No.
Q. -- the head of that?
A. Huh-uh.
Q. Are you still an editor of the Journal of Women's History?
A. No.

45Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. And I take it that your CV would have the years of which you were involved in those things?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. And presently you deal only with graduate students?
A. Yes.
Q. And are you presently writing something for publication?
A. I am. I'm writing two books, one of which is technically in press -- I'm doing the copy editing of it now -- on a study that
involves cultural and social issues in Ireland in 1895, when a young peasant woman was killed by her loving husband, father
and family because they thought she was a fairy.
They thought she was changing, that she'd been possessed by the fairies, so it's a great study for showing what common
knowledge, at least among the peasant class were, or common knowledge was at that time, as opposed to the official colonial
government of England and Ireland at that time, and the middle class Anglo-Irish. Just a tremendous story.
Q. Would you agree that what is “common knowledge,” as you're using that phrase, may be different across different
socioeconomic groups?
A. It varies. I think we all start out in any society with the same -- similar common knowledge, because parents do -- Societies
are what? Societies do determine a general culture or do pass on a general culture to all children as they grow up.
As you rise or fall in socioeconomic status, it may affect some of those views, but basically, at least in this country, most of
us start out pretty much the same.
Q. Would you agree that with respect to issues of health risks of tobacco, what is common knowledge may differ between
smokers and nonsmokers?
A. No, I wouldn't agree. Their common knowledge would differ?
Q. Yes.
A. As a smoker and nonsmoker?
Q. Yes, as to what health risks are with respect to the cigarettes.
A. Not at the very basic lowest common denominator of perception or information. I would say, no.
Q. Have you looked at any studies or analyses of perceived risk with respect to health risks among smokers versus nonsmokers?
A. I've seen some differences on polls just in terms of response levels, not so much about risks, but -- well, I guess maybe it
was about risks -- about the linkage between --
No, there are some differences. Sometimes nonsmokers will be slightly more or less ahead or behind what smokers do, but if
you're looking for the margin of error, I haven't seen any polls that show it very great.

46Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. What polls are you talking about, and are they contained within these boxes?
A. A couple of them are. Again, some of this would come from previous research.
MS. CHABER: I would ask to have whatever polls she's talking about be produced.
Q. You, I thought at the beginning of this, indicated you didn't think yourself to be an expert in polling data.
A. I don't. But anyone who does contemporary social and cultural history since 1935, you have to use them as a portion of our
evidence or look at them as a portion of our evidence.
We didn't have polls before then, so it makes it easier to do the 1895 study in a way, but -- so we use them as partial evidence
for determining this basic level of common knowledge about topics. But we also look at them very carefully. You can't just use
them -- Even as a historian, as a non-polling expert, you can't just look at them and take them at face value.
Q. You would agree there's a difference between people being aware of something and people believing something?
A. Yes.
Q. And at what point in time did the majority of smokers believe that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer?
A. If -- Again, many of these polls do not break down smokers and nonsmokers, so when you're looking at the general figure,
you're assuming that you've got a mixed group. And if you start with the 19, what, 50 poll, where, overall, 41 percent, when
asked these specific question about the linkage between lung cancer and cigarettes, it was at I think 41 percent.
Q. What was the specific question?
A. The specific -- I've looked at the specific question. I think it asked a series of questions, but the question that in this instance
received the lowest percentage of positive responses was the linkage between, the connection between -- I don't know quite
what the word was that was used -- between cigarettes and lung cancer.
The other questions had to do with had they seen literature or recently seen literature on the same subject, and a much higher
percentage--4
Q. Had seen something?
A. -- had seen something.
But in that mixed group, you have to assume the data behind them aren't always as complete as we like. Assuming that the
figure -- that the percentage represented by smokers and nonsmokers, it was 41 percent --
Q. To whatever that specific question was?
A. It was with the linkage.
Q. But I'm asking you what the specific question was, because linkage --
MS. MASON: She can't recall.

47Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
THE WITNESS: I might not be quoting it exactly, but it was a question that did use the term “lung cancer” and use the term
“cigarettes,” and the verb in the middle was either “connected,” “linked,” “caused,” or whatever.
MS. CHABER: Q. Or a cause?
A. Or a cause.
Q. And was it heard or was it believed?
MS. MASON: If you can recall.
THE WITNESS: Was it what?
MS. CHABER: Q. Was it heard that cigarette smoking was a cause --
A. No.
Q. -- or was it believed?
A. I'm separating out the question that simply asked them if they thought there was a connection, and this next set of questions
asked them whether they had recently heard or seen or read, or whatever, material. A much higher percentage answered yes
to that.
Q. That they had seen something?
A. That they had seen something, uh-huh.
Q. So at what point in time did the majority of smokers believe that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer?
A. I don't know specifically on nonsmokers. I can tell you when it tips in the direction of the general answer to the question
which contained both the words “cigarette” and “lung cancer.”
It goes up to 51 percent in 1957, goes up to percent after the 1964 Surgeon General's report, and then it continues to rise.
Q. And the specific wording of the question makes a difference as to how you interpret?
A. I wouldn't say how you interpret, but you do have to look at the wording of the question. I once worked for Princeton
University and put together the ETS exams, and it was the closest --
Q. You were the one?
A. Yes, I was.
Q. A lot of people don't like you.
A. And we had to figure out, in multiple choice at least, where you place the correct or incorrect answers, because it does make a
difference. And so as historians and as a nonexpert on polls, we train our graduate students to look at the questions. Sometimes
you get them and sometimes you don't.

48Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
So, yes, we look very carefully at the wording. And what I did with respect to these particular Gallup polls was to make sure
I knew when the question linked cigarettes to lung cancer and when the question simply said “Have you heard or read about
material with respect to this.” And the more specific the question, usually the lower the percentage. The more general the
question --
Q. And the questions that come before and after have an effect, as well, on the way these polls are answered?
A. Yes. And that's why they are -- You know, it's an interesting piece of evidence, but it's one piece of evidence that we use
and try to corroborate with other evidence.
Q. And there's people who are polling experts who do this --
A. For a living.
Q. -- analyze this for a living, and you are not one of them?
A. I am not one of them.
Q. All right. Let me -- I'm going to want you to do what is going to become a fairly tedious -- but maybe it will go faster than
I hoped -- exercise in a minute in relation to Exhibit 3, which are your notes.
But first I want to get an idea from you more specifically what's in these boxes. You gave me a generalized answer. The folders
are marked, or -- You have them open. They are marked, numbered and in order?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. Do you know, without me pulling these in front of you, what's in each of these boxes?
A. I don't know them by box number, so you'd have to just --
Q. All right.
A. I did put them back, so I have some sense of the order.
Q. Okay. This is two pages of a yearbook?
A. Yes.
Q. And I'm looking at a folder that says “Nordhoff High School Ranger”?
A. Yeah.
Q. Is this Ranger the yearbook?
A. The Ranger is the newsletter. I think the yearbook was the TOPA TOPA.
Q. And how many pages is The Ranger in general? In other words, I'm showing you the first one, dated November 1975. Does
this represent the entire issue?

49Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. I doubt it. I don't know, but I doubt it.
Q. Do you know whether Leslie Whiteley ever read this?
A. I don't. I gathered, I think from one of the depositions, that she worked for the newsletter.
Q. Do you know what she did?
A. No.
Q. Do you know, if she worked for the newsletter, whether she was mimeographing and stapling or whether she was researching?
A. My knowledge of high school newspapers is limited to my own. I assume she probably wrote for it.
Q. But that's an assumption?
A. It is an assumption.
Q. You were not given that information?
A. (Shakes head negatively.)
Q. And you did not see that information anywhere in her deposition?
A. I thought I gathered from her deposition that she did -- as I said, worked for the high school newsletter in some capacity.
Q. But that she wrote for it is not a piece of information that you have a source for?
A. Correct.
Q. And looking at this first issue, November 1975, and the one page that is attached to the cover, what is the significance of that?
A. The significance of it is simply one of the short blurbs in it, “New sign on Nordhoff's girls' bathroom door: ‘Welcome to
Marlboro Country,’ ” reflecting the controversy about the smoking policy of the high school.
Q. Or reflecting that the girls smoked Marlboros in the bathroom?
A. Both.
Q. And the fact that there was a sign on the door indicates that it was something that was known to the school?
A. I can't presume to say that. One would assume the faculty must have seen it.
Q. And certainly probably did if they read The Ranger, correct?
A. More likely if they read the Ojai newspaper, because that's where they were reporting on the controversy in this time period.
Q. However, the fact that there's a sign on the door to the girl's bathroom, that wasn't reported in the Ojai paper, it was reported
in the school paper, correct?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
50Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. Correct.
Q. And February 1976, the next issue.
Oh, by the way, in -- was Leslie Whiteley in Nordhoff High School in November of 1975?
A. Yes. She didn't graduate until '76.
Q. Okay.
A. I don't know whether this one I used for any particular purpose. I'm not seeing here any reference to the smoking question.
I may be missing it here in scanning it, but I don't think so. There are some cartoons -- No, the cartoons don't apply, either.
Q. I'm going to actually give you the folder, and maybe we can -- as we go through them, you can put them back in so they
remain in the order that they were in.
A. That's fine.
Q. Assuming that they were in date order.
The third one is The Ranger. It says “Graduation 1975,” and that's handwritten at the top. Do you know who wrote that?
A. No, I don't. It came with it. Since you can read it, you know it's not my handwriting.
Q. I wasn't going to point that out, but you did.
What's the significance of that?
A. The significance here is more self-evident, because there is an article by one of the students, it appears, on “Smoking Area,
Good or Bad.” That simply refers back to the controversy I mentioned.
Q. Okay. There's The Ranger, Fall 1972, Volume 1, Number 1. Do you know if Leslie was at Nordhoff High in 1971?
A. She graduated in three years, so I'm assuming she was there between '73 and '76. This is fall '72. Probably not.
Q. Do you know how old Leslie was in the fall of 1972?
A. Whatever -- she would have been normal-aged, I think, for entering high school. I don't remember what that is.
Q. Do you believe she was in high school in 1972?
A. No, I don't think so, given the fact she graduated in '76 and only spent three years.
Q. Okay. And the significance of the Nordhoff Ranger for a year that Leslie was not at that school is what?
A. Simply to give me an impression, or anybody looking at this, what the local high school newsletter tended to talk about. In
this instance, there is an article on marijuana smoking.

51Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. And it gives pro and con?
A. It doesn't give the pro and con that the previous article did. It simply says that it should be kept illegal. So it's an antimarijuana-
smoking --
Q. Does it talk about health risks?
A. It talks about instilling fear of death, delusion, and paranoia, percentage of students smoking it.
Q. Was what?
A. 14.2 percent of the 9th to 12th graders who experimented with drugs at least twice. And the author says, “I think that
marijuana would be used for the effect, not for the habit, like cigarettes.”
Q. And the significance of that?
A. The fact that they are simply saying -- he's comparing or contrasting them, regular cigarettes with marijuana cigarettes.
Q. Again, as to any of these Rangers, you don't know how many pages the full magazine was?
A. No, I don't. It's partially mimeographed, so that indicates it's fairly short, I think.
Q. There's certain issues that -- Were there certain issues in these where it was noted that the teachers were all smoking?
A. In the article we just talked about, when they discussed the areas for smoking, they indicated the teachers had a smoking
lounge.
Q. Do you know what the availability to a teenager was in the 1970s of cigarettes?
MS. MASON: I'll object to vague as to “availability.”
THE WITNESS: Availability in terms of legal purchasing?
MS. CHABER: Q. Getting them.
A. Any way?
Q. Any way.
A. Not really. I don't have any expert knowledge on how they got them.
Q. Do you know whether there were vending machines that were accessible to --
A. Yes, because they come up in the discussions of teenagers.
Q. And other than there being a picture of Leslie in this 1975 TOPA TOPA, is there any other significance to this?
A. No. The significance is simply the picture, and the same for the 1976 yearbook.

52Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. And did that have any bearing at all on any opinions in this case?
A. No, but it is something that cultural and social historians look at, if there are photographs or pictures of the people specifically
or in general or of specific individuals.
Q. Were you shown pictures of Leslie smoking that were attached to her deposition?
A. No. I read about them in the deposition, I think you asked her about them, but I haven't seen them.
Q. You haven't seen the videotape that was taken?
A. No, no.
Q. And were some of these of such significance that there were duplicates in here?
A. Conceivably.
Q. Just in case you missed them the first time around?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. And there's a folder -- We are again in Box 1 of 5, and excuse me for standing up --
A. That's okay.
Q. -- Ventura Star Free Press.
A. Uh-huh.
Q. What time period did this cover?
A. If I'm not mistaken, it went from maybe 1969 -- maybe '68 through the '70s. Could I check my notes?
Q. Sure. Of course. Feel free to refer to them.
A. Some of the papers differ. That's why I'm saying that. '64 -- I was wrong. '64 through '78 or '9. Through the Carter
administration, basically.
Q. And I see that they are mixed in. Amongst them are some Ojai Valley News --
A. Yeah. The file was somewhat corrupt, and rather than separate them out, I decided to leave them as I -- so I took separate
notes on that. But I did have a run of the Ohio Valley News from, let's see, '73 through '88.
Q. And is it possible for you to determine how many pages the Ojai Valley News was?
A. Not unless I physically saw a copy.
Q. And how many sections it had?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
53Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. It did not seem to have sections, per se, though it had columns I noted that appeared on the same pages, so that a local person
reading it would know where to turn to page so and so to get Dr. John Nelson's column.
Q. Well, and again, these were all provided to you, correct?
A. Yes, they were.
Q. And, for example, in this Ojai Valley News the front page is “Ojai Readies for Another Tennis Event”?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know who sponsored that tennis event?
A. I don't.
Q. Then there's a reference to -- It's hard to read, but page B2.
A. Uh-huh.
Q. Does that imply to you that there's sections?
A. Yeah, uh-huh.
Q. And whatever this is appeared on the second page?
A. Of B2. What year is that?
Q. 1960.
A. Okay.
Q. You were saying before we started changing paper that it went back --
A. My notes go back to '72, but you're correct, the file went back before that.
Q. Have you ever looked at the questionnaire that's being referenced in this article from 1960 looking at cancer habits study?
A. No.
Q. Do you know who Dr. Blossom is?
A. No.
Q. Tell me where this page 16 -- what is “Family Weekly” in the Ventura Star Press?
A. I just assumed it was a section of probably a weekend edition. I think it's a weekly section in the local newspaper.
Q. Do you know whether this device that's being advertised on page 16 of this paper ever worked?

54Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. No. No, I don't.
Q. Did you ever hear of Breck's of Boston?
A. I have heard of it, but I'm not sure what it is. I may just have heard it there.
Q. Doesn't this say that even without quitting you can cut down, using this device?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. And then you can go on smoking harmlessly?
A. Yes, it does say that.
Q. And that was from the 60s, right? 1971.
A. '71, okay.
Q. And I guess one of the editorials in the school paper was that the real problem with the smoking ban is that kids were getting
suspended, and then they wouldn't be as smart. They were losing out of some education?
A. That might have been one of the implications. Also, I think implied -- the implication I drew from it was they thought the
suspension was too strict, too rigid. Too extreme, I guess is the word.
Q. By the way, do you know what the success rate of stop smoking clinics are?
MS. MASON: At any given time?
MS. CHABER: Q. At any given time.
A. I don't.
Q. There's no point in getting specific if she doesn't have an idea. In fact, do you know what the success rate of any clinics that
were available from Leslie's treating doctors were.
A. From Leslie's what?
Q. Treating doctors?
MS. MASON: Objection, foundation.
THE WITNESS: I don't understand.
MS. CHABER: Q. Do you know what the success rate was of any stop smoking clinic that was available from specifically
any of Leslie's treating physicians?
A. No, no.

55Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
MS. CHABER: Q. In one of these articles discussing the Nordhoff issue of the smoking area are noted 57 suspensions in just
the year as of March 1976?
A. Yes. I have that in the notes.
Q. Do you know whether smoking destroys Vitamin C?
A. I don't.
Q. I see there was a note from the Ojai Valley News in 1978 that marijuana use was “widespread and estimated as high as 45
percent of adults in California enjoying this means of altering consciousness at least occasionally.”
A. And if you look at it, it talks about laced marijuana. It's just not regular marijuana.
Q. That was also gradually gaining legal sanction and growing acceptance?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. And you would agree with that? Well, “laced.” You mean paraquat that the United States Government was spraying on it?
A. Yeah.
Q. And that's what the big concern at the time?
A. The concern?
Q. It wasn't the marijuana, it was the paraquat.
MS. MASON: We might be able to speed things up if we weren't pulling comments out of a paper and asking her whether they
are in fact in the paper. But it was just a suggestion.
MS. CHABER: I wasn't asking if they were a fact in the paper.
MS. MASON: Several of those last questions were.
MS. CHABER: Q. These things that I'm looking at now do form part of the basis of your opinion, correct?
A. The basis of my what?
Q. Opinions.
A. Yes.
Q. And what was the significance of this article on clove cigarettes?
A. On what? Clove cigarettes?
Q. Yes.

56Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. Possibly as an alternative to regular cigarettes. I'm not sure.
Q. Do you know what year it was that Leslie Whiteley switched to a light cigarette?
A. I really don't. I thought I read it in the deposition, in either her current husband's or her deposition, but it was when she
was with him.
Q. Are you aware of any information available to the ordinary consumer that said smoking low tar, low nicotine cigarettes
would be safer?
A. I think that would be implied in some of the ads, but also the congressional hearings which were held on it would have
highlighted that.
Q. Do you know whether those congressional hearings were televised?
A. I don't.
Q. Did you watch the conventional hearings, by the way, in 1994?
A. On -- Oh, with the tobacco executives?
Q. Yes.
A. Yes.
Q. These didn't seem to be in quite the same date order, but I put them back the way they were.
A. I did, too.
Q. What did you include in the Life magazines? What's the selection?
A. I looked at Life for other -- the other cases. And so again, with this, I just went in -- This one starts back in 1920, and I
jumped to the end of it to see what was occurring again in the later years. But with respect to that, there wasn't much information
in the decades concerning this case.
Q. Do you know how much tobacco advertising is in any of those issues that you have there?
A. No, no, I don't.
Q. And what was the significance to you of -- Why don't I just hand you the stack of these Easy Riders.
A. Oh, yeah.
MS. MASON: Will you restate the question, Madelyn, or read it back? I didn't hear the complete question.
MS. CHABER: Q. What was the significance of the stack of Easy Rider magazines?

57Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. It was mentioned in one of the depositions that she either read or subscribed or was acquainted with this, and so I took a
look at it.
It's basically of very little significance for this case, simply because it has very little to do with the issues involved here. It's
basically a sexist and soft porn publication.
Q. And not much there on the health hazards of cigarette smoking?
A. That's right.
Q. In fact, one of the issues has a woman on the front with a cigarette dangling in her mouth?
A. Uh-huh. I found it interesting.
Q. Would you agree that -- Well, it's also somebody's very bad copying job, but would you agree that it's interesting for its
lack of information about health hazards?
A. Until, I think, you get into the '90s. It then begins to talk about health hazards.
Q. In the 1990s?
A. Yes, in the 1990s. I did note that.
Q. Can you show me which issues you're talking about that talk about health hazards?
The men at the other end of the table can't wait to come over and see these.
MR. PECK: Spare us.
MS. CHABER: You may not want to be spared.
THE WITNESS: They tended to put the statements in these -- I don't remember what it looked like. I didn't take the exact date
down, but I noted not until 1990s.
I don't think this was it. They tended to have short stroke things, I think, where it tended to be mentioned. I am not finding it here.
I think it might be in this section called “Take It Easy” that I came across a few references there were to the fact that there may
be problems with smoking. Reference here to smoking being tougher in Turkey because they behead you, but there's something
about celibacy -- not celibacy, but impotency, with respect to smoking. But they are few and far between.
My notes just say there were beginning to be some references to it, and I could probably find them.
MS. CHABER: Q. But you'd have to pore through --
A. “Need to recruit to replace the smokers dying each day,” that's one of them.
Q. This is 1996?

58Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. This is 1992. It begins then, and I don't know why I didn't see some later ones, but these are the kinds of references, just
these little short things.
Q. Can you tell a how-many-page magazine that is?
A. No.
Q. And where that part of it appears?
A. This is on page 4.
Q. And do you know how many cigarette advertisements are in that magazine?
A. I don't. I wondered about advertising in this, who would advertise, but I don't know.
Q. Do you know what the readership of that magazine is?
A. I don't.
(Discussion off the record.)
MS. CHABER: Q. Do you know what the time frame of this video on the public service announcement is?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. Can you tell me?
A. '67 to '88, if I'm not mistaken. I know the first one was '67.
Q. And do you know how many there are on the tape?
A. How many on there?
Q. Yes.
A. They vary from -- some were ten seconds -- 30 seconds to a minute and a half.
MS. MASON: Not how long, how many.
THE WITNESS: How many? No.
MS. CHABER: Q. Do you know at what time any of them were broadcast?
A. No.
Q. And do you know whether any of those were broadcast during any time period that Leslie Whiteley was watching TV?
A. I know the dates, yes. They started in '67 and were lumped primarily from '72 through '79, the greater number of them, the
greatest number at that time.

59Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. Do you know if any of them were broadcast during a time period when Leslie Whiteley was watching television?
A. I assume so.
Q. Do you know whether any of them were broadcast specifically when Leslie Whiteley was watching television?
A. No, sorry.
Q. Do you know whether any of them were broadcast when any of her family members were watching television?
A. No.
Q. Do you know what channels they were broadcast on?
A. No.
Q. Do you know whether they were broadcast in Ventura County?
A. No.
MS. CHABER: Will you make me a copy?
MS. MASON: I'll make you a copy.
MS. CHABER: Q. This doesn't happen to be the marked copy of the deposition, does it?
A. No, it is not. Sorry.
Q. And the San Francisco Chronicle that was here, do you know whether Leslie Whiteley or any of her family members read
the San Francisco Chronicle?
A. No, I don't.
Q. And the same thing with the Los Angeles Times?
A. Yes, that's correct.
Q. That you do not know?
A. I do not know.
Q. How about Time magazine? Do you know whether Leslie Whiteley read Time magazine?
A. Again, there might have been a reference in one of the depositions to her having access to a couple of those national news
magazines.
Q. Do you know whether or not Leslie Whiteley ever read Newsweek?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
60Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. No, I don't.
Q. Do you know whether any of her family members read Newsweek?
A. No.
Q. Do you know whether Leslie Whiteley read --
A. U.S. News & World Report.
Q. Thank you. -- U.S. News & World Report?
A. No, I don't.
Q. Do you know whether any of her family members read U.S. News & World Report?
A. No.
Q. Did I cover the magazines?
A. Better Homes & Gardens.
Q. I didn't see those. Do you know where those are?
A. They are in there someplace. It's a single folder.
Q. Do you know how big?
A. Not too big. About two inches, maybe.
Q. Do you know what time period they cover?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. Okay.
A. My notes are from '67 to '97, but it could start a bit earlier.
Q. Do you know if it's in a folder marked “Miscellaneous”?
A. No, it was in a separate folder, but I do recall I had trouble -- when I put it back, I had two sections of it, and I think I finally
combined them in the one folder. I think it's a complete folder, but I got it in two pieces when I read it.
Q. In Box 2, there was a folder labeled “Better Homes & Gardens,” and could you tell me the time frame?
A. My notes take it from '67 to '97. It could have started in the early '60s.
Q. Do you know how many tobacco ads were in these magazines?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
61Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. No.
Q. Do you know how many tobacco ads showing thin, attractive women smoking long, thin cigarettes appeared in Better Homes
& Gardens?
A. No.
Q. Tell me again the beginning time frame.
A. '67 to --
Q. That's what I thought you had said, and now I'm looking at an April 1945, so there's some mixed in here?
A. No. My notes -- As I said, I was concentrating on the time period I thought most relevant. So, yes, they went back a ways.
Q. Okay. And then there's some reprints. There's some portion without a cover?
A. Yeah, a couple of times that occurred.
Q. And you don't know whether that covers any of these where there was a cigarette advertisement, do you?
A. No, I don't.
Q. And at least up to 1966 -- at least up to 1970, none of the tobacco advertisements, if there were any in this magazine, would
have contained warnings on them?
A. That's correct.
(Pause in proceedings.)
MS. CHABER: Q. And can you tell me what this miscellaneous file that came out of Box 4 is?
A. Yeah. It had, as you can see -- I looked mostly at the -- It had some of the Gallup polls scattered throughout it with the backup
data -- that is, the questions -- and it had some of the popular songs really antedating, again, this case, which mention smoke.
It had a few public transportation legal decisions coming from the late 19th century which I had used or read for one of the
previous cases. And there's another decision.
It was truly miscellaneous. There's some Good Housekeeping articles here which I didn't look at again because they came so
early and they hadn't appeared -- the names hadn't appeared in the deposition.
Q. Do you know how many movies in the 1970s featured stars smoking?
A. No, I don't.
Q. Do you know what percentage of movies in the 1970s had smoking as occurring --
A. No, not in the statistical sense at all.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
62Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. Do you know whether or not there were movies in the 1970s and 1980s in which brand placement of cigarettes appeared?
A. Do I just know generally this occurred?
Q. Yes.
A. Yes, I do.
Q. Do you know any specific movies where you're aware of there being brand placement of cigarettes?
A. No, I don't know the names. I just realized as an individual that in the '70s and '80s all kinds of products were being advertised
in the movies, because they were showing the labels or the brands.
Q. But you don't know to what extent that's true with respect to cigarettes?
A. No. I think it just was one of the many products they started to advertise.
Q. Are you aware of any movies that were actually rewritten so that a cigarette brand could be placed within the star's fingers?
A. No.
Q. Are you aware of whether or not the majority of movies today have cigarette smoking done by the stars of the movies in
the movie?
A. That the stars are smoking?
Q. Yes.
A. I've just read as a private individual that there seems to be a return of smoking scenes in movies.
Q. You had made some mention at the beginning of this about high school textbooks?
A. Yes.
Q. Could you tell --
A. That's a separate file.
Q. Do you know what it's labeled?
A. It may be labeled “State Legislation” or may be labeled “Textbooks,” but they are both in the same file.
I have it here as “State Legislation.”
Q. You read the deposition of Elizabeth Whalen?
A. For another case, yes, uh-huh.
Q. And what did you conclude from that deposition?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
63Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
MS. MASON: If anything.
THE WITNESS: Not much, simply because the data she used didn't relate to the kind of common knowledge evidence that
I was looking for.
MS. CHABER: Q. And what did her opinions relate to?
A. The -- She detailed the early studies from the '50s and then highlighted the internal memos which were released before she
wrote or gave a statement and gave her deposition.
Q. Can you tell me whether that is one poll? Numerous polls?
A. Let me just take a quick look.
This looks to be by the -- There was a number up here. Just from the cover page, I would say it's 1, because the end number
is only 1400.
Q. And what year?
A. That is for '54.
Q. And does it have the entire poll or just a question?
A. The interview method was personal, so that means they actually talked to people, and it took them, looks like here, a week
to do it. And they talked to about 1400 people. And the subject was health information. So what it is, these are probably from
primitive IBM cards that they got, and this shows you the entire poll.
Q. It has all the questions?
A. It would appear to have all the questions, yeah.
Q. Do you actually have all of the questions from the Gallup polls?
MS. MASON: From this Gallup Poll?
MS. CHABER: That's not a Gallup Poll, that's Roper.
THE WITNESS: It's a Gallup Poll survey, but then it's a Roper poll that they ultimately record on to Roper Center.
MS. MASON: Is the question does she have all the questions from all Gallup polls, or that Gallup Poll? Will you please repeat
the question?
MS. CHABER: That might be easier.
MS. MASON: Yes.
MS. CHABER: Q. How many Gallup polls have you looked at?

64Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. Oh, I'd say half a dozen to eight, spaced over time.
Q. And what years?
A. Beginning in -- basically, beginning in 1950, although I recall seeing something from '49. But 1954, 1957, in the 1960s, and
a couple of later ones. They are clustered largely, the ones I looked at most carefully, in the '50s and '60s.
Q. Did you have, for whatever years' polls you looked at, the entire poll or just certain questions?
A. For the -- and this was for a previous case -- I had a graduate student look up the entire poll for '54 and '57, because I couldn't
understand the summarized data that was published in the newspapers.
And I had -- I think I looked at the complete poll in -- after the Surgeon General's report in '64, but not for this case.
Q. And those are polls that you're referring to that are not contained within these boxes?
A. Well --
Q. Other than what you have in front of you?
A. I think that was the only one I came across this time around.
Q. And are you relying on the information that you gathered, or that was gathered for you, rather, that was reviewed for another
case in this case?
A. The complete polls I saw I had gathered for myself for those other cases, yes, and I relied on them, on my memory of them.
Q. Correct. I would ask that those be produced, then, if you're relying on them. There seems to be something from -- regarding
Gallup polls. What is that?
A. I think -- Well, it's a preface, I think, to a publication that they put out about their polling from '35 to '71, and they tried to
explain how they do it, sampling procedures.
Q. And is that --
A. And this is from August '72 by George himself.
Q. Have you read the entire publication or only that preface that's provided there?
A. No, I have used this publication for a variety of purposes. I was studying politics or foreign policy in this same time period,
so I've read in it selectively.
Q. Have you read in it about tobacco other than the preface that --
A. Yes.
Q. -- is there?
A. Yes, I mean, because it's such a great source. It's an easy-to-use source. But it doesn't contain those questions.

65Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. It does not contain the backup data?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. It's an interpretation --
A. It's a handy reference.
Q. And is this something that's available --
A. Everywhere.
Q. Everywhere?
A. Yes. I mean, in libraries, obviously.
Q. Not in the supermarket?
A. Not in the supermarket.
Q. How about turning to your notes, and let's try and do some interpretation here.
MS. MASON: Madelyn, you may have already done this. We should take a break?
MS. CHABER: I've worked through as far as I can work through, and I can't really work through, and I think it's going to take
more time to do it that way than I need to go through.
MS. MASON: Okay.
MS. CHABER: Q. Your first page, hopefully, is my first page.
A. Yeah.
Q. Somehow yours looks thicker than mine.
A. I have an extra notebook that's blank. The pages are blank.
Q. You've taken some notes here?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. Looking at this page, can you tell me what -- what's the source of these notes?
A. Yeah. I don't know what you're technically calling it, but it came with a cover sheet like this and then had a lot of family
data and medical data behind her on it.
Q. And do you know where that is?

66Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. That's at the material back at the hotel -- No, actually -- No, it's in the material at the hotel, because I kept it with the
depositions.
MS. CHABER: All right. We'd like that, too.
MS. MASON: You'll get what she has at the hotel that she's reviewed.
THE WITNESS: I was just trying to quickly fill myself in.
MS. CHABER: Q. And there's a phone number. Is that personal?
A. Yes, it's personal.
Q. Okay. I will consider it crossed off. And below that, is that personal, as well?
A. I had dinner with them last night.
Q. Okay. But there are some questions off onto the right. Can you read those? That's where I'm running into problems.
A. Oh, these were questions of things that I didn't understand as I was looking at the material.
Q. Don't add to your notes right this second as you're doing it.
A. The first one says, Why so many companies involved ...,” it's an ellipsis involved in the case.
And the other one refers to “Is there anything on pipefitters?” That is -- I come from a union family, and I was thinking that
there were union publications that the father would have received as a pipefitter.
And then my next question relates to the textbooks, and I said --
Q. It says “why” --
A. “Why no textbooks for the 1970s,” because I wasn't clear from the list I had when the third, fourth and fifth editions went
into the '70s. I assume they had, but the only dates I had were earlier than that.
Q. Where are these textbooks?
A. They are in there, in the boxes.
Q. Maybe you can put your hands on them.
A. Okay. That's the box that may start with the title “Legislative.”
MS. MASON: I saw that one. I'll get it.
THE WITNESS: “State Legislation.”
MS. MASON: Yes.

67Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
THE WITNESS: Okay.
MS. CHABER: Q. And were you able to find anything from pipefitters?
A. I had a graduate student check into it. We contacted the national headquarters in Washington, D.C., only to find they kept
the national journal and no local or state publications.
Q. And so you don't have anything here upon which you're relying?
A. No.
Q. Okay. And did you eventually find textbooks from the '70s?
A. Not for the time frame in which I looked at this material. I made the assumption that the third and fourth editions of what
seem to be the most popular textbooks were the most used -- one by this Oliver Bird, et al., went into the '70s -- because there
were so many editions of it.
You'll see it there. It's called -- Well, just called “Health.”
Q. Do you know whether that textbook was used at any of the schools Leslie attended?
A. No. The state issued a list of acceptable or recommended textbooks, and this was definitely one of them.
Q. The state did not mandate that any of these particular books be used, isn't that true?
A. That's true.
Q. And my question is, do you know whether or not any of them were used at any of the schools that Leslie attended?
A. No.
Q. “Health For All”? Is that the textbook you're talking about?
A. I don't think it's “Health For All.” Is it Oliver Bird? You can tell by the authors. It's a list of authors. I thought it was just
called “Health.”
Q. I don't see anybody named on that.
Do you see any evidence in any of the testimony that you read that Leslie received instruction on smoking health hazards in
school?
A. I believe it was mentioned in one of the ... most likely, her deposition, that she had. It was required or she had attended
health classes.
Q. And wasn't she asked whether or not there was a portion or a section on tobacco education?
A. That I don't recall right now.
Q. I see a cover sheet that says “Health Three: Health, Safety, Fitness.”

68Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. Uh-huh.
Q. Oliver Bird. Is that the text that you're talking about?
A. That's the text. This was a teacher's edition, I'm fairly sure. That came out in at least four different editions. They are all
in there.
Q. And do you know whether or not any of those were used at Leslie's school?
A. No.
Q. Or whether ... Well, which section of this is the section? All I see is a table of contents.
A. You'll see there are specific pages on whatever chapter would have dealt with drugs, narcotics, alcohol and tobacco.
Q. Do you know how long, how many weeks the section that dealt with drugs, tobacco, alcohol and narcotics would have been
during Leslie's time in school?
A. If you look at this particular text carefully, it looked to me perhaps that they might have spent a couple of weeks on it, given
the teacher's notes that accompany the text.
Q. Assuming that the teacher taught everything that was in the book?
A. Exactly.
Q. And have you talked to anyone, including the lawyers representing Philip Morris, as to whether they actually went and talked
to the teachers at Leslie's school to find out how long tobacco education ... how long a time period during Leslie's school years
tobacco education was taught?
A. That question was have I asked them?
Q. Or have they told you.
A. The answer is “No” to both.
Q. Would you be interested to know if Philip Morris' attorneys or investigators have gone to Leslie's school and talked to the
principal of her school or any of the teachers?
MS. MASON: Objection, presumes facts.
THE WITNESS: I don't really have an opinion about it.
MS. CHABER: Q. Do you think that would be a source of useful information, to know whether or not and to what extent
tobacco education occurred in Leslie's school while she was there?
A. I think from a legal standpoint; not from necessarily my standpoint.

69Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
MS. CHABER: Q. What was the significance to you of there being other companies involved in this case?
A. It had no significance for me. It just was a question that occurred to me, that there seemed to be an abundance of companies
or more than the normal number of companies.
Q. Do you understand that there's allegations that asbestos exposure --
A. I understood that, and it seemed to be construction companies, and company after company.
Q. And you have no specific opinions that you're prepared to render in this case vis-a-vis asbestos or knowledge about asbestos?
A. No.
Q. Do you have any specific opinions vis-a-vis common knowledge of hazards of asbestos and smoking in combination?
A. No.
Q. Do you know or have any information or awareness of any increased health risk with respect to lung cancer to individuals
who were exposed both to asbestos and cigarette smoking?
A. No.
Q. Volume 1, you didn't take notes on?
A. No, because I highlighted it.
Q. Okay. I was going to feel insulted, because I happen to know Volume 1 is my questioning.
A. Okay. All right.
Q. And then you started taking notes in Volume 2?
A. I started taking notes in Volume 2, given the fact I didn't have a highlighter.
Q. And what was your criteria for writing down the information that you put down?
A. I read these as a historian, and with my kind of social history hat on, and I'm trying to figure out what -- First, I do look just
peripherally at medical history, if it shows up, if anything; and then what I'm really looking for is what she may have read, what
she may have perceived about cigarettes, either from what she read or from some of the things she's going to say in answer to
your questions, or what her relatives might say about their perception of cigarettes in this time period.
So I'm looking for -- at the questions where you would ask her if her father or mother had told her not to smoke, or if she had
smoked in front of them openly, or if she -- anything that would indicate to me that she had some awareness that there was a
problem with smoking, either because her parents didn't want it done or because she might have had some sense that it was
-- she was taking a risk to do it for other reasons.
Q. And what was your perception with respect to Leslie as to what she perceived the risks of smoking were in the 1970s?

70Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. I couldn't -- You're asking for my perception of it, of her perception?
Q. Yes. What did you conclude was Leslie's perception?
A. That it was strikingly absent, that her perception was strikingly absent, and I thought that curious.
Q. You saw that Leslie indicated that she thought that cigarette smoking could give you a cough?
A. At most, yes.
Q. Was there any significance to her being a truck driver in any of your opinions here?
A. Not from my opinions in the case. I just privately found it interesting that she would have trained to be a truck driver.
Q. And why would you find that interesting?
A. It's still a relatively unusual occupation for a woman. Usually shows some gumption or independence that is just interesting
to me.
Q. I see you underlined that she had seen “testimony before Congress”?
A. Yeah, uh-huh.
Q. Why did you underline that?
A. You saw I've got a question mark after it, because I was assuming -- I'm not sure you specifically asked about the 1994
testimony, but I'm assuming that's what she saw.
Q. And that's what the question mark is?
A. Yes.
Q. And you've underlined “addictive”?
A. Yeah.
Q. Why?
A. Because of her use of the term repeatedly. The first time, I underlined it, and then you'll see I write it a couple of times.
Q. And what is significant to you about the use of the term?
A. Because up until 1994, it wasn't the most common way to refer to a smoking habit.
Q. But she wasn't being asked in 1994. You understood that?
A. Yes, of course.
Q. In hindsight, when people are being asked to evaluate behavior, they may use current terminology?

71Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. Uh-huh.
Q. And you'd agree back in at least as of 1994 the tobacco companies were denying that cigarette smoking was an addiction?
A. Did you ask if I agree with that?
Q. That they were doing that, yes.
A. No, no, in the very general sense that you represented it.
Q. You don't agree that in 1994 the tobacco companies were denying that cigarette smoking was an addiction?
A. And using that terminology?
Q. And using that terminology.
A. I guess the answer to that -- I mean, this is getting me into some speculation.
There's a problem with the term “addiction.” I think you're as aware of it as I am, that it wasn't, up to that point, commonly
applied to a tobacco habit or a smoking habit. So, conceivably, then, you would have company officials saying that it wasn't
addictive in the scientific or previously scientific definition of what an addiction was.
That's all -- That's why I'm a little --
Q. You mean they were splitting hairs in front of the U.S. public in terms of whether or not cigarette smoking was addictive?
MS. MASON: Objection, argumentative.
THE WITNESS: Yeah, I think it is argumentative, because both sides are splitting hairs.
MS. CHABER: Q. And you believe that that was a valid and legitimate thing for the tobacco executives to say, that cigarette
smoking was not addictive, in 1994?
A. In 1994, I think in terms of the use of that term, yes, it was valid for them to say what they said.
Q. Did you think it was valid in 1994 for a cigarette company to claim that it had not been proven that cigarette smoking caused
lung cancer?
A. Again, it's hard to answer, because are you talking about at any time period, or just in that 1994 testimony?
Q. 1994. Not even in that 1994 testimony. In 1994, would it have been valid for a cigarette company to claim that it had not
been proven that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer?
MS. MASON: You're asking for a personal opinion?
THE WITNESS: Or is she asking for a scientific opinion?

72Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
MS. CHABER: Q. No. I'm asking you, in terms of viewing information out there that can come into the common knowledge
of people, whether or not that could be viewed as a valid statement, that it had not been proven that cigarette smoking caused
lung cancer?
A. Well, the operative word there is “proven,” and if you're looking for a clinical test that proved that as of '94 or as of right
now, the answer is there is no clinical test that proves it.
Q. That's not what I'm asking.
A. I don't know what you mean by the word “proven.”
Q. Would it be reasonable, Doctor -- For an individual who was watching the congressional hearings, reading things, hearing
things said by tobacco company officials, would it be reasonable for that individual to conclude that it had not been proven
that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer?
MS. MASON: Objection, calls for speculation beyond her area of expertise, improper subject area for her expert testimony.
THE WITNESS: I can't answer it.
MS. CHABER: Q. You do not have opinions as to what the ordinary -- what is reasonable for the ordinary person to believe?
A. I have -- Well --
MS. MASON: Objection, misstates testimony.
THE WITNESS: According, again, to this lowest common denominator of common knowledge or information that individuals
-- the average individual, average reasonable individual, would have had, is that the reasonable individual would have known
there was a risk in smoking, and that the major risk for most people would have been associated with the term “lung cancer.”
A reasonable person in 1994 would have, I think, that kind of gut level reaction to the question of the hazards or risks of smoking.
MS. CHABER: Q. How vigorous?
A. It's up to the individual.
Q. What would the reasonable common denominator have been? What would the reasonable person have believed was the risk
vis-a-vis lung cancer of cigarette smoke?
MS. MASON: You're asking her to quantify it? I'll object as vague.
THE WITNESS: I think it is too vague.
MS. CHABER: Q. The extent, the risk.
A. I think --
MS. MASON: I think it's still vague.
MS. CHABER: I don't think it is.

73Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
THE WITNESS: By 1994, again, the reasonable person would have known it was a serious risk, I think.
MS. CHABER: Q. What does that mean, “serious risk”?
A. Because the evidence, both the scientific evidence and the popular sayings of the dangers of smoking through the media since
1950, had accumulated, and there is a kind of collective memory that goes along with common knowledge, and so probably
the average reasonable person in 1994 would have had a greater sense of the risk, because of the intervening media attention
and studies, than the average reasonable person in 1954.
Q. Would the average reasonable tobacco company executive have knowledge and awareness of the extent of the risk to people
from cigarette smoking vis-a-vis lung cancer?
MS. MASON: I object as speculation.
THE WITNESS: I mean, I can't comment on the personnel in the tobacco companies.
MS. CHABER: Q. Well, you can comment, though, about the truck driver on the street, correct?
A. Well, because the truck driver on the street is more directly under the influence of what is the common parlance or common
information about any product.
Q. Than a cigarette company executive who has at their resources scientists, doctors, and so forth?
A. And all of that information is not part of the common knowledge information.
Q. Are you suggesting that individuals, through whatever common knowledge sources, have more information than tobacco
company executives?
A. Not at all.
Q. Would you agree that the tobacco company executives have, at a minimum, the level that the ordinary person on the street
has? I mean, you wouldn't put them in some other class in terms of common knowledge?
A. No. As I said earlier, we all start out with the kind of same basic common knowledge, and that expands or contracts depending
on where we end up later in life, personally and socioeconomically.
Q. And do you know what level of education -- whether the level of education has an effect on people's awareness of health risks?
A. It should have. But you see very educated people taking abnormal risks all the time, not simply with respect to cigarettes,
but with all other kinds of risk-taking activity.
Q. Do you know specifically with respect to cigarette smoking whether perception of risk changes based on educational status?
A. No, because educated and uneducated people in this and other societies take risks knowing they are risks. Even though the
common knowledge is telling them not to, they sometimes don't act on the basis of it.
Q. Taking risks and knowing extent of risks, you would agree, are different?

74Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. Semantically, yes.
Q. You don't think they are different in terms of real life?
A. Well, those, again, are hard terms to deal with, “taking” them and “knowing” them. Obviously, usually, when you take the
risk, you know the risk.
Q. If you take a risk, for example, of walking into the street, there's some risk you might get hit by a car, correct?
A. Right or -- Yeah, there are a lot of --
Q. Do you know to what extent people understand the difference between there being some risk from an activity like walking
into the street and knowing that one out of every three people who walk into the street get hit by a car?
A. No. You'd have to know the individual to know how that particular individual was processing that information, assuming
the individual had both types of information.
Q. Wouldn't you also need to know what that meant, knowing that there was a risk, vis-a-vis extent?
A. I guess so. I don't see the distinction.
Q. Let me give you an example. Do you know about data, for example, looking at people who viewing risk of lung cancer
from asbestos?
A. What's the question again?
Q. Are you aware of data looking at people's awareness of risk of lung cancer from substances like asbestos?
A. Am I aware of data?
Q. Yes.
A. That people could get lung cancer?
Q. No. Are you aware of data that looks at what people's awareness of risks or perceived risks are from substances such as
asbestos?
A. No. Am I personally aware? No.
Q. Have you looked at any data that deals with people's perceived risks of potential causes of lung cancer other than smoking?
A. Very generally, but not for any of the work I've done here for this case or other cases.
Q. Do you know what the perceived risk data is with respect to, for example, asbestos, and what the common knowledge of
the risk of asbestos vis-a-vis lung cancer is?
A. No.

75Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. Do you know how the perception of risk of a substance like asbestos vis-a-vis lung cancer, do you know how that compares
to the actual risk?
A. Do I personally?
Q. Yes.
A. No.
Q. Are you aware of information looking at people's perceived risk of cigarette smoking vis-a-vis lung cancer compared with
the actual risk?
MS. MASON: I'm going to object on foundation.
THE WITNESS: Did it start do I know of studies or know of data?
MS. CHABER: Q. Right.
A. No.
Q. That's not something you have looked at?
A. That's correct.
Q. You would agree that people's perceptions can either overstate a risk or understate a risk vis-a-vis actuality?
A. Yes.
Q. And then you went on to Leonard Whiteley's?
A. Yes, because I read then the rest of that deposition, yeah, and then I picked up with his again, because I was -- whatever
I was doing, I didn't have a highlighter.
Q. And what was the significance of that he can't even spell his mother's name or when his father died or when they moved
to Ventura?
A. I just was surprised at how little he knew about his own life. I have done a little bit, not with really family histories, but with
family situations where you're interviewing people about their families, and this seemed unusual to me.
Q. What did you interpret from that?
A. I really didn't know what to interpret. I just took it down. Because, again, I think most people you randomly talk to about
their family background would know most of that information, and it just seemed unusual to me.
Q. Well, did that cause you to conclude that he was lying, stupid or something else?
A. I really didn't conclude anything. What I take down or what I highlight -- and this is just something -- if it isn't specifically
related to what I'm looking for in terms of the case, I take it down simply as a reminder that this is what he didn't know. It's
unusual, I think.

76Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. On the side, it says “Look up addiction in old notes.” What does that mean?
A. This is getting back to our discussion or question earlier about the use of the term “addiction.”
Q. I don't know what that means.
A. I found the term -- It appeared to me to be used somewhat excessively in answers in these depositions, and it's not a term
that has in the past been commonly applied to cigarettes or the habit of smoking.
Q. And so what did you conclude from that?
A. I again, as with the other deposition, I really concluded nothing, except I noted the use of this term, and then I reminded
myself that I should look up what had been the previous definition of addiction, when it didn't apply to tobacco.
Q. And when did it start to apply to tobacco?
A. As far as I can tell, in the public's mind, anyway, in 1994.
Q. Didn't the Surgeon General come out in 1988, and wasn't that publicized?
A. Not as much as the 1994 statement.
Q. Wasn't the 1988 statement publicized?
A. It was publicized, yes.
Q. And wasn't it disputed by the tobacco companies?
MS. MASON: Objection, assumes facts, argumentative.
THE WITNESS: I really didn't look into it as much as -- I mean, look into the dispute over it.
MS. CHABER: Q. Did you look into the tobacco industry coming out with something actually the day before the Surgeon
General came out in 1988 with a statement that cigarette smoking was, indeed, an addiction, an addiction that was as bad as
addiction to heroin?
MS. MASON: Same objections. That question is vague and compound.
THE WITNESS: I can't answer it. The day before?
MS. CHABER: Q. Yes.
A. I don't have any knowledge, either expert or personal.
Q. Did you look through some of the magazines, newspapers, articles to see if there was anything included in there with respect
to whether the tobacco industry in 1988 made statements with respect to addiction or the Surgeon General's report?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
77Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. Yes, I did. I don't recall any statement prior to the Surgeon General's statement, or report, in '88 by the tobacco companies,
any statement that preceded it. I -- Obviously, in there you find statements coming after it.
Q. And I think you have some notations of “the lawyers” --
A. The lawyers disagreeing over whether or not the deponent is being coached.
Q. And what was the reason you wrote that down?
A. Just to note. It seemed -- Again, given other depositions I read, it was somewhat -- peculiarly acrimonious.
Q. For the record, we would note that I was not at that deposition.
A. Yes.
MS. MASON: Nor was I.
THE WITNESS: You're both off the hook.
MS. CHABER: Q. And then there's something circled.
A. Uh-huh.
Q. And I can't read any of that. On the left.
A. The answer was from Leonard Whiteley that either he -- I'm not quite sure of the context here -- didn't believe it would kill,
or the government would have taken it off the market. Referring to cigarettes.
And then I have written over to the side that the lawyer for the defendants -- and when you say see the circled me, that's me --
that the government doesn't pull all products off the market that kill. Otherwise, you'd have very few products on the market.
But, anyway, I just noted that for myself. I thought that was an interesting statement that he would make.
Q. What other products do you know on the market, Dr. Hoff, that kill as many people as cigarettes?
MS. MASON: Objection, vague and argumentative. Assumes facts.
MS. CHABER: Q. You just said, otherwise, all products would be off the market, and I believe --
A. I said a lot of products.
Q. Let's put a list of those products that would be pulled off the market because they kill.
A. You said “kill as many.”
Q. I've changed it.
A. You've changed it now to just “kill”?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
78Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. Yeah.
A. Automobiles come to mind. Guns come to mind. A number of products come to mind that we know can be detrimental to
your health if used or misused in some way.
Q. Automobiles aren't designed, at least hopefully not designed, for the purpose of killing?
A. No, but you still lose about 55,000 people a year.
Q. And do you know how many you lose with respect to cigarette smoking?
A. I know, that was back to your first question. But we are just talking now about products that can kill in one way or another.
Q. Are you aware of it being a perception of at least some people in the population that the government wouldn't allow a product
that killed people to remain on the market?
I'm not asking if you agree with that. I'm asking if you were aware that there is some portion of the population that believes
that government wouldn't allow a product that killed to remain on the market.
MS. MASON: I'm going to object on foundation.
THE WITNESS: I couldn't answer that as an expert witness.
MS. CHABER: Q. You don't know of any studies, data, information as to people's perception of government vis-a-vis consumer
products?
A. Not that specifically. I'm aware of various perceptions that people have of the government, not of the government in relation
to consumer products.
(Discussion off the record.)
MS. CHABER: Q. Are you aware of a perception in the public of lung cancer being an old persons' disease?
MS. MASON: Could I have a foundation objection to all of these “are you aware of” questions?
MS. CHABER: Sure.
THE WITNESS: Not really, no. Some of this was, I must confess, news to me.
MS. CHABER: Q. Did you think that -- Did you have like opinions about the credibility of these people?
A. No, I just was trying to put it into context of interviews I've done with living individuals, obviously, and of previous ones
I've read, and this just seemed to me a bit odd.
Q. How many people have you interviewed with respect to their beliefs about cigarette smoking?
A. None.
Q. How many have you interviewed with respect to their beliefs about the government and cigarettes?

79Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. None.
Q. Besides Ms. Whiteley and Mr. Whiteley's depositions and the brothers and sisters, how many other depositions have you
read with respect to the issues of tobacco?
A. I've read the ones for the two cases I've been involved in.
Q. I don't know how many that would have entailed.
A. There are roughly usually maybe four to six, with respect -- maybe as many as eight with each case.
Q. And those two cases would be Rogers and then the Wiley case?
A. And the Wiley case, yeah.
Q. And Rogers was a living individual?
A. No, he was dead. But we had the deposition.
Q. He had been deposed before he died?
A. Obviously.
Q. What was his socioeconomic status and educational level? Give me a short little summary.
A. He was a lawyer in Indianapolis.
Q. And Ms. Wiley was a nurse?
A. She was a nurse at the vets' hospital.
Q. And had she been deposed prior to her death?
A. Yes.
Q. And, obviously, Mr. Rogers was college-educated, and law school, as well?
A. Yes.
Q. Was Ms. Wiley college-educated?
A. She was college-educated to the degree she had a nursing degree.
Q. How many other truck drivers or individuals -- working class individuals' -- depositions have you read with respect to
tobacco?
A. It's hard to say. I don't know whether any of the relatives of the other individuals might fall into that category.

80Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. None come to mind, though?
A. No, none come to mind.
Q. And you've got something circled, some notes over on the left-hand side.
A. Yeah, the circle is -- The statement was “You don't hear things when you are addicted,” and then I said -- over to the side
I've got a note -- that is, note to myself -- and “ask,” which means reflect on this for whatever --
I mean, I thought it was an interesting answer. I was just wondering what it meant.
Q. And have you reflected on it?
A. I haven't come to any conclusion about it. I still have it in front of me here.
Q. Do you believe that, if someone is addicted to a substance, that they might filter out such messages?
A. It's conceivable.
Q. What's this “influx of celebrities”?
A. “Influence of celebrities.”
Q. And Leonard's a truck driver, too?
A. Yes.
Q. And he, in fact, didn't graduate --
A. With her.
Q. He didn't graduate high school?
A. That's right. He was graduated from the class of truck drivers.
Q. But high school, he didn't graduate?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. And again, your notes on the side pointing to safety regulations with respect to truck drivers --
A. Yeah, let's see. I've noted that she might have helped him pass the test. She was sharp and intelligent, he said. And since it's
documented by the pages, were these government regulations?
I think the attorney asked this, “were just nonsense-created jobs,” because it had been stated earlier, either in this deposition
-- it must have been in this deposition -- that he thought, Leonard Whiteley thought, the warning labels were put on there to
give bureaucrats jobs.
Q. Did you ever hear people express things about government interfering in business, big business?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
81Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. Yes, in that very general sense. I don't think, personally, I've ever heard someone say that government safety regulations
were put on or issued to give bureaucrats jobs, when it involves health and hazards. OSHA, maybe. But, no, I think it's still --
Q. You never heard any working class people be very skeptical about the government with respect to hazards and risks and
warning labels?
A. My brother's a mechanic, and he is subjected to a lot of these safety regulations in his work, and as far as his health is
concerned, he thinks that it goes far beyond giving government bureaucrats jobs. He think it's protecting him.
Q. And is that your answer with respect to the rest of the working class population?
A. No, I don't make any generalizations. I'm just saying that viewing safety regulations as simply to give bureaucrats jobs is
something that I found interesting to note and I took it down.
Q. Are you aware of any beliefs within the working class population that government warnings are government interfering
in big business?
A. Not really with respect to government safety warnings. I am aware of other antigovernment interference attitudes, not simply
among the working class.
Q. Do you find that not believable, that Mr. Whiteley, at age 40, didn't know anyone less than getting sick from cigarettes?
A. Not really. I didn't find it unbelievable.
(Discussion off the record.)
MS. CHABER: Q. At the bottom of the page that has -- we are still in Leonard's depo, around page 144 --
A. Okay, I've got it.
Q. Okay. It says “Reynolds Tobacco”?
A. Okay.
Q. “New attorney Escher”?
A. Yes, he entered the deposition. I was noting his name and who he was representing.
Q. Have you ever met with any attorneys or people involved with Reynolds Tobacco?
A. No. Just the Shook, Hardy people. I mean, individuals there.
Q. And then we get to your nightmare page, as I would call it.
A. Yes. This didn't come immediately after reading this, but after I'd gone over the rest of the depositions. And I was just
starting to put down a number of things, not exclusively in connection with the deposition, but to a certain degree relating --
I was trying to organize, although it doesn't appear to be things about the depositions, and then about the time period. And I
started to think in terms of decades.

82Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
And so you see the top there, it says “1950” -- I mean, I have the American Cancer Society report, '57, the first congressional
hearing, a few things to remind myself what was happening, but I decided, well, if some of this doesn't -- how am I going to
make sense maybe of the later decades, since I've already done the earlier decades?
So I started to list things about decades, '50s, 60s, '70s, '80s, '90s. I don't put in anything, but that's what most of that is about,
and just to refresh my memory about what was happening in those decades and what was interesting about the time period
other than the issue of tobacco.
Q. One of the things was in 1964 we were in the middle of the Vietnam war?
A. And Kennedy had been assassinated.
Q. And as you well know from your time at Berkeley, there was quite a bit of skepticism of the honesty of our government
during that time period?
A. Very definitely, with respect to foreign policy.
Q. And how about --
A. That was also a time period in which we were very supportive of government action with respect to civil rights and with
respect to reform issues.
Q. Maybe on the Berkeley campus, but you wouldn't generalize that to the south, for example?
A. Generalize what?
Q. That we, whoever that “we” was, were supportive of government actions with respect to civil rights?
A. Well, civil rights, pro civil rights groups, were positive toward the government and urging the government to take action on
civil rights and on desegregation, and we were very hopeful about Johnson coming in.
Q. No, I'm trying to define the “we.”
A. Okay. The “we.”
Q. Who is the “we”?
A. I would say most people in the civil rights movement at that time. We were divided in our opinion of the government, because
we felt that as the war escalated, it was being mishandled and the foreign policy was not being well thought out.
On the other hand, we were at the same time trying to see to it that EEOC and other agencies were going to be enforcing
affirmative action, and we were concerned about desegregation, I must confess for the south and not for the north. So we were
a little schizoid on the question of government.
Q. And when you say “we,” what percentage of the “we” were supportive of the government vis-a-vis involvement in civil
rights?
A. I think most active civil rights -- members of active civil rights groups in the north were.

83Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. Right, and I'm trying to understand, vis-a-vis the general population, how many people are we talking about? Are we
talking about the majority of the people of the United States were supportive of the civil rights movement in the 1960s and
the government involvement?
A. I wouldn't want to bring it down to percentages. You never have a reform movement that's supported largely by the majority
of the people, even when you have revolutions, so there's always a smaller-than-majority percentage.
Q. So the common belief was not necessarily the government was doing the right thing with respect to its involvement with
civil rights?
A. I don't know. I haven't looked at any material on that, really.
MS. MASON: I just have to tell my secretary something. Let me step out for a minute.
(Discussion off the record.)
MS. CHABER: Q. Down in the right-hand side, can you read?
A. Okay. The very right-hand side. I was starting to think about --
Q. Actually, I think your right and my right might be different.
A. Okay. I brought with me the deposition I had given in '77, just to see how that had gone.
Q. In '77?
A. I'm sorry, in '97, and I was just looking back at that, because, obviously, there's always room for improvement, and I was
looking at some of the topics that had come up there that I was anticipating might come up in either this deposition or at the trial.
And so there were a few things, and you raised one of them already, about my publishing in the field of tobacco. So, you see,
I started to refresh my memory on what subjects --
Q. I might cross-examine you about?
A. I had researched and not published on. So that's what that long little thing over in the corner is.
Then I noted that Ohlemeyer had indicated -- and in the deposition that we've just gone over -- that the attorneys would
occasionally talk about compound questions and usually interject or object. And so I noted that I wasn't very good at not
answering compound questions. I would just usually jump in. So that was in the memo to myself.
And then a couple other things just along the same line.
Q. And let me just jump in for a second. The “listen, slow down,” is also part of your instructions?
A. That '97 deposition I thought left a bit to be desired.
Q. “Don't use ‘might’ and ‘okay,’ ” those are more instructions from the lawyer?

84Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. Yeah -- No. In this case, I had the deposition with me, and I was looking at it. And I thought, now what was it that Ohlemeyer
had interjected, or -- when he stopped and I had gone ahead?
And then I started to say, well, it's these compound questions, which I never recognize as compound, and then that I'm talking
too fast most of the time. So I'm saying, you know, think about this.
Q. But these are things that were as a result of objections made by Mr. Ohlemeyer?
A. In the deposition itself, yeah.
Q. Yeah. So they were, in essence, information you were reacting to from the lawyer?
A. At the time?
Q. Yes.
A. Yes, exactly.
Q. I'm not that clever to make that be something more.
A. Okay.
Q. Word, “opinion,” what does that mean?
A. Where is it?
Q. Next to “Why I don't publish on tobacco.”
A. I tend to -- If this constitutes my opinions, I should think sometimes of saying “no” to that, because of the term “opinions,”
if it doesn't relate to the expert testimony, if I have an opinion about the painting of the Bay Bridge or something. I should be
alert to every time an attorney then would ask me about my opinion, if it weren't my expert opinion.
Q. And what's this about “consumer expectation”?
A. That was a term that came up that I didn't know what it meant, and in this case I put it down as something to ask what it
meant, and I did ask.
Q. And what were you told?
A. I was told that it was a term that was now used in California law.
Q. And were you told what it meant?
A. That it had to do with um -- I do remember vaguely what it meant. Expectations about the harm that could normally be
expected from a product. Isn't that what it's about?
Q. I'm just asking you what your understanding is.
A. That's my understanding.

85Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. Or what you were told.
And then what does this say, “don't agree”?
A. Then it came up -- no -- this was in relation, forget “consumer expectation” -- that if there might be problems with the
1997 deposition, that I should make sure to ask to see the context of the quote that was being given to me about what I had
previously said.
Q. Did you have an opportunity to review and correct that deposition after it was given?
A. You mean originally?
Q. Yes.
A. Yes, I did.
Q. And did you make any changes or corrections?
A. I only made spelling-type errors or changes.
Q. And that was your testimony that was given at that time?
A. Yes. Yeah.
Q. “No sound bites”?
A. That comes from the fact that -- I don't know what it comes from exactly. I think it comes from teaching, and also I've been
doing some television, and I tend to be a bit glib and maybe come up with a phrase that sounds good, but that from a legal point
of view might not be the best thing to have said in such a flippant or flamboyant manner.
Q. And what kind of television have you been doing?
A. I just did C-Span on the Nixon presidential series. And I've done McNeil-Lehrer, but I've been out of favor with them ever
since I didn't agree on Kosovo.
Q. And “only” something?
A. The difference between a deposition and a trial in terms of, say, catchy phrases.
Q. And what was the difference?
A. Apparently, the difference appears to be that it's, what, not as vulnerable, from a legal point of view, to use them in trial as
it is in a deposition. That's what that means. There should be a little “versus” there.
Q. Why did you understand that to be the case, or what did you understand to be the case?
A. That simply because the defense attorneys would have had occasion to look at the deposition and could zero in on some
term or some phrase I might use and then bring it back at me in trial.

86Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. And if you use it in trial?
A. I couldn't tell you. It seems to me that because that's a give and take back and forth, that it's -- that the attorney would not
have the time to think about it or to maybe zero in on it as much.
Q. And then on the right-hand side down there when it says “Topics”?
A. Those are the topics we went over that I was listing. I had to kind of refresh my own memory about the topics I hadn't
published on. It says “Topics I have not published on,” and then it lists them. And I mentioned some of those earlier to you today.
Q. Now, “cognitive dissonance” you have?
A. I was trying to think about why the depositions I have read would indicate that those being deposed knew so little about
the risks of cigarettes, and this was a trendy term at some point, I think, for explaining the -- why people -- explaining why
people take risks when they know they are risks.
Q. And what does it mean?
A. I haven't a clue. I mean, I don't know this terminology that well, but it seemed that it was a trendy term at one point to be
throwing around about how people -- why people took risks, when I think it's just human nature to take risks. It makes it sound,
what, more -- I don't know what it makes it sound like.
It makes it sound more like an acceptable rationale for why people take risks when I think it's hard to explain why people
take risks.
Q. Do you consider yourself an expert on the issue of why people take risks?
A. No. I just know that we do, as human beings, and it is just interesting to me that we are risk-taking human beings.
Q. Then the next pages, these are your notes on --
A. These start with the boxed material. What do you have, the Star Free Press?
Q. Yes.
A. Okay.
Q. You have written down on the second page “I'd rather fight than,” and -- you actually wrote “I'd rather die than switch,”
and you wrote “fight” over it?
A. In that issue of the paper, and they had, in a number of the issues of the Ventura paper, the Art Hoppe column, and he had a
satirical column in which the conclusion was “I'd rather die than switch.” And I was thinking to myself, “What was the slogan?”
And I said, “I'd rather walk” -- “I'd walk a mile” -- and it's, no, “I'd rather fight than switch.” And so I wrote in, after the fact,
“fight,” to remind myself what the slogan was.
Q. You had mentioned this earlier, and I see you have a note on this local couple using this fan to blow smoke?
A. Yeah.

87Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. Do you know what the reaction in the community was to these people?
A. I took it down because I thought it might be something that the local community people might need and remember. I mean,
you've taught, I've taught, and largely what the students remember are immaterial anecdotes you tell them about famous people
or issues, and I thought, you know, if I were reading that, then I might have remembered it now.
Q. And if you were reading that then, you might have thought that these were pretty silly and foolish people?
A. I could have.
Q. I see you have a note “1977” about antismoking groups used the word “addiction”?
A. Where is that, on that same page?
Q. Yes.
A. Okay, yeah, I noted there -- and again, because it was in my mind from the depositions, that during the smokeouts, which got
a lot of coverage, too, one of the things I focused on in terms of the other newspapers, that the people promoting those smokeouts
used the word “addiction,” and it was to remind me that there had been some use of it before 1994. That is, in a very public way.
Q. So did that change your astonishment at Mr. and Mrs. Whiteley using that terminology in 1999?
MS. MASON: Objection, misstates testimony, argumentative.
THE WITNESS: It just reminded me of the problem I was having with the word “addiction.” I mean, I didn't know any more
how they were using it than I did when I had read the depositions.
MS. CHABER: Q. And what is this about “Pat Buchanan”?
A. He had a column taking on Joe Califano for the way in which he was promoting antismoking, because he was a three-
pack smoker at the time, and he came out very publicly, I can remember this, and made these very self-righteous, ostentatious
statements.
Q. Pat Buchanan?
A. No, Califano. And Buchanan was taking him on for doing that, and, “Look, you've got, whatever, Dr. Whatever from the
National Health Institute who has made sensible statements about how to cut back and why you should cut back,” but he
thought Califano was just taking advantage of the issue to the benefit of the Carter administration. It was a Republican and
Democratic thing.
Q. Didn't Carter fire Califano?
A. I don't think he fired him. I think he did leave.
Q. He fired him. By the way, did you watch “The Tobacco Wars”?
A. “The Tobacco Wars”?

88Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. The recent three-part series on the history of tobacco.
A. How recently? Obviously, I didn't. How recent was it?
Q. It was done by the BBC within the last year. It was done sometime this year by the BBC, and was rebroadcast on U.S.
television very recently.
A. No, I did not.
Q. Have you seen “The Insider” yet?
A. I haven't seen it. I've read a lot about it.
Q. You have some notation here about what smoking -- I'm on the next page. Ventura Star Free Press?
A. They are slightly out of order. I lost a page there. It's where it says --
Q. What does it say next to “1976”?
A. Does it say “continued” on the top? Yeah. “1976 smoking clinic in Oxnard at St. John's Hospital,” because I was noting all
of the stories or ads that were being presented in both local newspapers about smoking.
Q. Do you know whether or not Leslie Whiteley was able to smoke while she was in the hospital in the 1980s?
A. No, I don't specifically know.
Q. What does the next line say?
A. It says it's “December,” I don't know why I took the month, “smoking.”
Q. “Despite warnings”?
A. Figures on smoking you raised earlier going up despite warnings.
Q. What does it say on the left-hand side?
A. That says “Recorded in all local” -- Oh, both local newspapers went out of their way to report all fires started in homes
from cigarettes. They just highlighted them.
Q. The next page seems to be about the videos.
A. Video, yeah, and it just runs down -- I was trying to see what the different topics were.
Q. You'd agree that the Easy Rider magazine, I think your words are, was pro-smoking until the 1990s?
A. Uh-huh.
MS. MASON: I don't think -- Objection. Misstates testimony.

89Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
MS. CHABER: I'm reading them, Counsel. You might look over her shoulder.
MS. MASON: I thought you meant her previous testimony. I didn't realize you were reading from the notes.
THE WITNESS: The note also says “totally sexist.”
MS. CHABER: Q. That part, I thought we noted oftentimes. I know they are going to open the boxes, those guys down the
end of the table, as soon as we leave.
(Discussion off the record.)
MS. CHABER: Q. Now, on the back here, we've got these textbook --
A. You've skipped over Mother Earth News?
Q. Yes, I skipped over the “state legislation.” I couldn't read most of the stuff.
A. On the back of the “state legislation”?
Q. Yes.
A. Got you. Okay.
I was noting or reminding myself the very top -- in 1960, over two dozen books were listed by the Department of Education
on hygiene, and then I started to look into them.
The first one was by W.W. Bower, et al, and then I jumped over to Julius Richmond, et al, “Health and Growth,” and then the
one that caught my eye, in part because it was so much better than some of the textbooks I'd seen in Indiana and Ohio, was this
Oliver Bird one, “Health.” And so then I started to note how it laid out the material.
Q. We talked about the fact that you didn't know whether that book had actually been used?
A. Yes.
Q. And then what's this, “Again no textbooks for the 1970s?”
A. That's the question I had in the first page, that I transferred to the first page, but I asked myself that here.
Q. Did it get answered?
A. At the moment, I'm just assuming that at least the Bird textbook went into the '70s, but I don't know. I'd have to find out.
Q. And what's below that?
A. The Nordhoff High School library had a number of books on tobacco and on smoking, and in that particular box there were
Xerox copies of the titles of the books, and in some cases how many times they've been checked out of the library. You know,
those little library cards?
Q. Yeah. It gave a title. Or did it give the actual information from the book?

90Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. I had the title and sometimes a couple of pages into the book, but not much information on the book. And then the checkout.
Q. And did you count in total how many times all of the books added to be checked out to?
A. Well, I can note there one of the books called -- I don't know, I can't read my own writing, it might have been “Today and
Your Health,” was checked out the most in the 1970s, by a man named Harold Piehl, P-i-e-h-l, and I did look at the checkout
slips. It was interesting to see.
Q. Did you ever see any names that you recognized as being involved in this case?
A. I did not.
Q. And did you count how many times these health books had been checked out in total?
A. Not precisely. I mean, I looked, and you could see at a glance that they were, what, I don't know, checked out maybe -- I'm
trying to think -- maybe half a dozen times in any given year.
Q. And this one in particular by this same person?
A. Yeah, his was the most, and I assumed, even though I looked at the names of the people checking them out, that these would
have been used more likely by the teachers themselves.
Q. And you don't know whether he's a teacher or not, that name that you noted?
A. No, huh-uh.
Q. You didn't see any reference anywhere to Leslie or any of her family members reading Reader's Digest?
A. No.
Q. Or Consumer Reports?
A. No.
Q. I don't know if I'm either learning your handwriting or it's improving or both.
A. It varies, given where I am, especially if I'm on some kind of public transportation.
(Pause in proceedings.)
MS. CHABER: Q. Did you ask the attorneys for Philip Morris whether or not they confirmed that Senior Scholastic was made
available to the students at this school's --
A. I did not ask that. It's a good question to ask. I would be awfully surprised if it were available here in California to the schools.
Q. Do you know whether it was actually available in any of the schools that Leslie was in?
A. No, I don't.

91Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
Q. “Jerry Seinfeld”? “Steinfeld”?
A. Steinfeld. I didn't know who the Surgeon General was who said in 1971 they should be banned in public places, so I looked
that up and noted that.
Q. “1974, more teenage girls smoking than boys”?
A. From the Senior Scholastic, yeah, and you see the percentages up there.
Q. And that's the same time period that Leslie's in high school and smoking cigarettes?
A. Yes.
Q. Smoking Marlboro cigarettes? I didn't hear an answer. It has to be verbal.
A. I'm sorry, yes. Sorry.
Q. That's okay. And the reasons stated why teens smoke is because “it's cool, it's adult, action”?
A. “Part of the costume.” This is what I was really quoting from memory earlier. “More mature, gives you power, relaxes
you, reduces tension, teachers smoke,” and the gross pictures that they were being shown in the hygiene classes didn't -- it
wasn't defined, but I assume those pictures were of the lung operations -- mean nothing. As a young person, it says, “I will
not get cancer.”
Q. Diet and ads?
A. I note for myself “diet and ads,” advertising. Neither was mentioned.
Q. And what does it say below?
A. This is what I indicated to you earlier, that the reasons really were so similar to reasons, what, 25, 30 years ago, with the
exception that we would call this peer pressure, most of this peer pressure today, and they didn't then.
Q. What's this 10,000 by 65?
A. Oh, they had a little -- after this article, it gave reasons the students had given for smoking. The article went on to say how
expensive it was for them to smoke, and that they would spend, comes back to me now, at 50 cents a pack, 182 packs a year
by the time they were 65, they would have spent $10,000. And then, which isn't in my notes but it was in my head, you could
buy, for $10,000, in 1965, a yacht or a Jaguar. I thought that was interesting.
Q. But kids don't think that way, do they?
A. What?
Q. That if they spent that money or didn't spend that money on something like cigarettes, that they would be able to own a
yacht or a Jaguar?

92Leslie WHITELEY and Leonard Whiteley, Plaintiffs, v...., 1999 WL 34872139...
A. I don't know. I think the yacht and the Jaguar might have raised -- hit them as interesting even if they didn't want a yacht
or a Jaguar. Maybe I wanted a yacht or a Jaguar.
MS. CHABER: Maybe we have the answer.
I have to end this.
We have the issue of those depositions, and so forth. If there are any additional items or any additional questions, I'd be happy
to leave the deposition open and get the deposition done by telephone.
I ask you make them available, and if we get copies of these boxes made --
MS. MASON: You want them all?
MS. CHABER: Yes.
MS. MASON: The additional materials that were going to be provided to you, if we have a telephone deposition, the deposition
will be limited to those materials and questions about those materials that are provided to you.
MS. CHABER: Or any further work, if Dr. Hoff does any further work or reviews any further materials.
MS. MASON: Okay.
MS. CHABER: Thank you.
(Exhibit 4 marked.)
(Whereupon the deposition was adjourned at 5:12 p.m.)
