12	Thereupon,
13	PETER C. ENGLISH,
14	the Witness, recalled for continued examination by
15	counsel for the Plaintiff, and, having been previously
16	sworn by the notary, was examined and continued to
17	testify as follows:
18	BY MS. KURTIN:
19	Q Good morning, again, Dr. English.
20	A Good morning.
21	Q On Friday you were sworn in, and this is
22	a continuation of your deposition.
1	Do you understand that the oath that you
2	took on Friday is still applicable for today?
3	A Yes, I do.
4	Q And we went over a series of — excuse
5	me — instructions on Friday. The same holds true
6	for today.
7	If you don't understand any of my
8	questions, please ask me to repeat them. Is that
9	okay?
10	A That’s fine.
11	Q Okay, verbal answers.
12	If you need clarification according to
13	Order 150, you should ask me for clarification, not
14	your attorney.
15	If you need to take a break, just please
16	ask me, and we would be happy to go off the record.
17	The only time that we can't do that is if there is
18	a question pending.
19	A I understand that.
20	Q Have you taken any drugs or medication
21	today that would impair your ability to give
22	testimony?
1	A No.
2	Q Are there any other medical — any
3	medical conditions or problems that might affect
4	your ability to answer?
5	A No.
6	Q Since the close of the deposition on
7	Friday, have you met with anyone in preparation for
8	today’s deposition?
9	A No.
10	Q Have you reviewed any additional
11	documents?
12	A No.
13	Q And have you prepared in any way for
14	this day's deposition?
15	A Only that I reread my expert disclosure.
16	Q Okay. Dr. English, on Friday we marked
17	a copy of your expert report as Exhibit No. 3, and
18	just to confirm, this is the expert report prepared
19	for this case; correct?
20	A It is.
21	Q Dr. English, if you could please turn to
22	Page 11, and starting with subtopic F: The public
1	health community's efforts to develop safer
2	cigarettes.
3	When you discuss the term "residual
4	smokers" in this paragraph, what do you mean by
5	residual smokers?
6	A These are smokers who continue to smoke
7	despite the public health community’s effort to get
8	the message out that smoking kills, causes major
9	disease.
10	Q And at the top of Page 12, the last
11	sentence states: The public health challenge was:
12	What about the millions of Americans who heard but
13	chose not to heed this advice?
14	When you talk about such Americans who
15	heard, but chose not to heed this advice, were
16	there smokers who were unable to stop smoking if
17	they wanted to?
18	A Well, I — I think that you have to
19	almost go down to the level of asking individual
20	smokers why they continued to smoke. It’s hard, I
21	think, to — to generalize why smokers who, having
22	heard the health message, decided not — not — not
1	to quit.
2	Q Dr. English, do you believe that smoking
3	is addictive?
4	A I accept the 1988 Surgeon General’s
5	conclusion that smoking is addictive, using that
6	set of definitions that we talked about in — in
7	detail, you know, on Friday.
8	Q And in your experience, have you
9	encountered patients who have been addicted to
10	smoking?
11	A My experience as a —
12	Q I'm sorry, as a pediatrician.
13	A As a pediatrician?
14	I certainly have encountered patients,
15	teenagers, who say it’s hard to quit. Whether
16	they’re addicted or not, is hard to say, but
17	certainly there are those who are saying they are
18	having difficulty quitting.
19	Q Have you ever diagnosed a patient with
20	an addiction to smoking?
21	A I've never used that term actually. You
22	know, I certainly identify smokers in my practice.
1	I counsel them to quit. Those who are interested
2	in quitting I, you know, I usually suggest quitting
3	on their own. If they want some help, I have
4	occasionally prescribed nicotine patches,
5	occasionally Zyban.
6	Q And have you — have those methods, the
7	nicotine patches and the Zyban, have they assisted
8	those patients who have decided to quit in
9	quitting?
10	A I think so. I think the issue of
11	quitting is a hard one as a — as a practitioner to
12	evaluate. In my experience, the teenagers who want
13	to quit seem to quit, without any particular aid,
14	and I mean that sort of, I think, goes along with
15	the national statistics, that most people who
16	decide to quit do it without counseling, do it
17	without any particular aid.
18	You know, when I asked teenagers about
19	why they — the few that I have that are smoking,
20	why they smoke, they tell me that, you know, that
21	they started smoking because their family did, or
22	they met a girlfriend or a boyfriend and they —
1	and they started to smoke in some sort of a peer
2	setting.
3	The reverse is also true, that when I
4	ask someone, you know, well, last year you were
5	telling me you were smoking, and all your friends
6	were smoking why are you — you say you are not
7	smoking this year when I see you for your annual
8	visit, what happened? What they tell me is, well,
9	I have a new girlfriend, and she hates smoking, or
10	1 have a new boyfriend, and he hates smoking, and
11	they are no longer smoking. So it is sort of like
12	peer pressure is important in the initiation of
13	smoking in teenagers, and it's I think very
14	important in stopping smoking, as well.
15	Q And when you say quitting is hard to
16	evaluate, could you just explain that a little bit
17	further?
18	A What I — well, why does someone do it,
19	or how does the actual quitting take place?
20	I think there is a step in there where
21	someone just says this is something I want to do,
22	for a variety of reasons, this is something I want
1	to do, because I want to date this girl, and I need
2	to do something like that, or I want to get my
3	parents off my back or something — something along
4	those lines. And then, you know, if there is a
5	nicotine patch, how much that helps, I think it's
6	hard for me to judge, if I am taking — if the
7	patient is taking Zyban for a while, I think that’s
8	also hard to, for me anyway, to sort out exactly
9	what are the — what are the important components.
10	Q And with respect to your pediatric
11	practice, what — what is the age range of your
12	patients?
13	A I see patients up to 22.
14	Q And when you do encounter patients who
15	smoke, what has been the general age range of most
16	patients?
17	A I don't have a breakdown. I would say
18	for the most part, they are 16 and older.
19	Occasionally, I will encounter patients younger
20	than 16 who are smoking.
21	Q Do you think your patients are honest
22	with you when you ask questions about their smoking
1	habits?
2	A Well, I think so. I mean there is
3	always — always a question here, but I start
4	talking to kids about smoking when they're — when
5	they're four and five years of age.
6	They know where I’m coming from on that,
7	and I talk to them about a lot of things, and when
8	they get to be teenagers, I talk to them about
9	issues like this when their parents aren't present,
10	and we have a deal that it's confidential, and I am
11	not going to be passing this information along.
12	I think they are amazingly open and —
13	about all sorts of issues, and I suspect about
14	cigarette smoking as well.
15	Are there some of my patients who want
16	to give me the answers that they know I want to
17	hear? I mean, I think that's possible, too.
18	Q And for those patients that do smoke, is
19	it your experience that they smoke for a number of
20	years, or is it a limited experience; you said it
21	changed sometimes year to year?
22	A Certainly it goes year to year. I don’t
1	have a sense of how many of my patients continue to
2	smoke after 22, when I — when I stop seeing them.
3	Sol don't have a sense of that. I do know that
4	kids who are — who are smoking at 15, 16, 17 are
5	just as likely the next year not to be smoking.
6	Q And do you think it’s harder to quit the
7	longer somebody smokes?
8	A I think that’s probably fair to say.
9	Q On Page 12, your paragraph, the first
10	full paragraph begins: In 1966, the public health
11	community seized on promising insights from
12	research in experimental biology, which indicated
13	that cigarettes with lower tar and nicotine were
14	less prone to cause cancer.
15	Dr. English, can you just tell me a
16	little bit about what happened in 1966?
17	A Well, 1966 is a — a date I chose for
18	two reasons: One is that it’s two years after the
19	first Surgeon General’s report. But secondly, it
20	was the year that the National Institutes of Health
21	had a meeting of scientists and public health
22	officials, in the areas of smoking and health.
1	The meeting was held on June 1 si. at the
2	National Library of Medicine, and they reviewed the
3	whole issue of low tar, low-yield cigarettes.
4	I use the term "low tar" and "low yield"
5	sort of interchangeably here. I don't have a
6	different definition for the two of them. So it
7	was -- so it was — at that where they reviewed
8	these — scientists and public health officials
9	reviewed the science on lower tar and nicotine
10	cigarettes, and came up with a statement, and
11	that's the very famous preponderance of evidence
12	that would indicate that the lower the tar and
13	nicotine, the less likely would be the chance to
14	cause cancer.
15	And that preponderance -- first of all,
16	it is sort of an awkward statement, and certainly
17	the word "preponderance" we don't encounter that,
18	but it’s interesting how that particular word
19	"preponderance of evidence" and connecting it with
20	the benefits of low tar and low nicotine cigarettes
21	continued to be part of the public health
22	community’s — it was the key phrase that continued
1	all the way through.
2	In fact, it’s — you know, it's
3	continued certainly through the '81 Surgeon
4	General's report, so that's why I chose 1966,
5	because it was an effort of the public health
6	community and scientific community to come together
7	and actually decide the issue of low tar.
8	Q And when you say the statement that was
9	issued, is that the report that you discussed
10	later?
11	A The Technical Report.
12	Q The Technical Report?
13	A Yes.
14	Q Is that the statement you are talking
15	about?
16	A Yes.
17	(English Exhibit No. 18 - document titled
18	Public Health Service, Technical Report on
19	Tar and Nicotine, Bates numbered
20	1003042043-046 - was marked for
21	identification.)
22	BY MS. KURTIN:
1	Q Dr. English, I am handing you what's
2	been marked as Exhibit 18. Is this the Public
3	Health Service report that we were just discussing?
4	A I’ve never seen it in this format
5	before. Where I have seen it is in a published
6	form, rather than this, and so I — I assume it is
7	the same as the published one.
8	Q Okay.
9	A I mean I — just out of curiosity, my
10	own curiosity, where did you get this in this form?
11	Q From the documents produced by
12	defendants in this case. This was part of the
13	collection of documents that have been produced in
14	this case.
15	A From the defendants, not from the
16	government?
17	Q Mm-hmm.
18	A Okay.
19	Q Well, turning to Page 3 of this report,
20	and I won't want to mischaracterize it, if you have
21	not seen it in this format, but it does look
22	familiar in terms of the information contained in
1	it?
2	A It does, and when you ask the specific
3	questions, when you ask me those, I can probably be
4	more explicit.
5	Q Okay. The conclusions reached in this
6	report and this study, turning to Page 3, any
7	conclusions about lower tar cigarettes, didn't they
8	also come with certain caveats that are discussed,
9	on Page 3 of this document —
10	MR. NARKO: Objection -
11	BY MS. KURTIN:
12	Q — about any alleged benefits?
13	A Okay. In a general sense, the public
14	health community always said that it was much
15	better to stop smoking cigarettes and not to start.
16	The — the — the recommendations for
17	low-yield cigarettes were always for people who
18	chose not to stop or not start.
19	Now, are you referring to a particular
20	thing on Page — sentence on Page 3?
21	Q Number one states that, in this document
22	it states that: It is possible for a cigarette to
1	be altered in such a way that its tar and nicotine
2	content is reduced, but certain other harmful
3	effects, for example, the effect of the gaseous
4	phase may be increased.
5	As a consideration for studying the
6	potential — any potential benefits of low
7	tar/yield cigarettes, is this concern about an
8	increase in the gaseous phase an important
9	consideration in evaluating any alleged health
10	benefits?
11	A It could be. I think we have to put
12	this in the context of 1966, and that where —
13	where did scientists believe the dangerous
14	components of — of cigarettes to be.
15	It -- the tars, of course, are not the
16	gaseous stage, and -- and the tars had been
17	identified, largely identified as the — as the
18	component of cigarettes that were most likely to
19	lead to cancer. Certainly that’s what the skin
20	cancer painting studies had indicated, painting,
21	skin painting studies.
22	But the scientific community was also
1	aware that there might also be harmful effects in
2	the gaseous phases as well, so I suspect that’s
3	what they are saying here, because they were
4	particularly here addressing the issue of reducing
5	the tars.
6	They weren’t as much talking about
7	modifying the gaseous stage, and that may be what
8	they are referring to here.
9	Q Are there any potential health effects
10	that have been associated with smoking and
11	components of the gaseous phase that you are aware
12	of?
13	A In 1966? When they wrote this?
14	Q Well, let's go first to 1966 when they
15	wrote this.
16	A Well, they certainly knew, in effect, if
17	you go in the Surgeon General's report or in
18	other — other reports earlier, that there were
19	lots of chemicals in the gaseous phase.
20	And so, I --1 mean I can’t, as I sit
21	here --1 think carbon monoxide was known in 1966
22	as an issue, as a component of the gaseous phase,
1	and certainly there were hypotheses that carbon
2	monoxide might be important in the development of
3	heart disease.
4	I would have to refresh my recollection
5	on other components of the gaseous phase in 1966 to
6	give a fuller answer.
7	Q And in the years after 1966, has — was
8	there — were there studies that discussed the
9	potential effects of exposure to carbon monoxide in
10	cigarette smoke?
11	A There have been.
12	Q And what diseases have they been
13	associated with?
14	A Again, from my reading of the Surgeon
15	General's report, carbon monoxide has been
16	particularly related or at least speculated upon as
17	being a component of heart disease risk, but,
18	beyond that, I can’t go too far.
19	Q Thank you.
20	Number two of this report says that:
21	The potential benefit to the individual consumer,
22	who might shift to a lower tar and nicotine
1	cigarette, would be negated if shift were
2	accompanied by an increase in the number of
3	cigarettes consumed, or in the length of each
4	cigarette used.
5	Does this statement indicate that there
6	was a recognition that the way a person smoked
7	could also impact the health effects of smoking?
8	A Yes. I think that is, and I think this
9	is an early recognition of compensation by the
10	pub he health community.
11	Q When you talk about compensation, what
12	do you mean by’'compensation"?
13	A Compensation occurs when a smoker alters
14	smoking behavior, in response to a low-yield
15	cigarette.
16	Q And what are the ways that a smoker can
17	change their smoking habits?
18	A Well, I think — what you have here is
19	sort of a — has a — is a 1966 understanding of
20	that, which means that smokers could — could
21	increase the number of cigarettes or it could
22	actually increase how a cigarette, individual
1	cigarette was achieved — was smoked.
2	Now, information about compensation,
3	obviously, has — you know, that was an area of
4	fairly intense research, from this period onward,
5	and in compensation, the understanding of
6	compensation actually became much more complex. I
7	don’t know if that's something — what you were
8	getting at.
9	Q I would certainly like to talk further
10	about compensation. In 1966, was the term
11	"compensation" used?
12	A I'm not certain I’ve seen the word
13	compensation used as early as 1966.
14	Q From your recollection, when do you
15	first recall the term compensation being used, in
16	discussions such as this?
17	A I — I would — I would put it in the
18	early 1970s.
19	Q And do you recall who first used the
20	term compensation?
21	A I can't recall when I first — you know,
22	who — it could be Michael Russell, the British
1	researcher who was -- whose name is prominently
2	associated with it. There is a footnote in the
3	1972 Surgeon General’s report, and as I sit here, I
4	can’t recall what are the terms — whether the word
5	compensation occurs in that footnote, but it's
6	certainly — the phenomenon, I think, was
7	recognized, the potential of the phenomenon was
8	recognized as early as Dr. Wynder's 1957
9	experiments, but I can't be precisely sure when the
10	term actually was first used.
11	Q And in Dr. Wynder’s 1957 experiments, is
12	he — does he really discuss compensation in his —
13	A Yes. We know that this statement here,
14	the one we have in front of us, was written by
15	Dr. Wynder, and Cuyler Hammond, and we know that
16	because they tell us that in the Banberry report.
17	This number two here: The potential benefit to a
18	consumer who might be — who might shift for — you
19	know, we're talking to a lower tar and nicotine
20	cigarette, would be negated if this shift were
21	accompanied by an increase in the number of
22	cigarettes consumed, or the length of the cigarette
1	that was used, is actually very close to what
2	Wynder said in the 1957 paper. So just looking at
3	that, I suspect he may be the person that actually
4	penned that sentence.
5	But I think — but, yes, I think Wynder
6	clearly understood that the benefits of going to a
7	low tar cigarette could be negated if a smoker
8	smoked more cigarettes or smoked a cigarette to a
9	different butt length.
10	Q I just would like to go through each
11	component of that.
12	An increase in the number of cigarettes
13	consumed, that would expose the smoker to a greater
14	amount of tar?
15	A Yes.
16	Q And how does the length of each
17	cigarette smoked, how does that correspond with —
18	why does that matter?
19	A Because if more of a cigarette is
20	consumed, there is more tar involved, and so
21	it's — you know, if the smoker smokes, you know,
22	20 — you know an extra five or so millimeters of a
1	cigarette, there is going to be more tar in those
2	five or so millimeters.
3	Q Is the amount of tar variable — strike
4	that.
5	If you have a cigarette, is it a steady
6	decrease or a steady amount of tar through the
7	smoking of the cigarette, or are there different
8	parts of the cigarette where there would be higher
9	concentrations versus lower concentrations?
10	MR. NARKO: Objection.
11	THE WITNESS: You know, I'm not
12	a, you know, cigarette technology expert, but what
13	the public health community, I can tell what you
14	their concern on this issue was.
15	There's an equal amount of tar potential
16	in unsmoked tobacco, but as the — but as cigarette
17	smoke is pulled through the lip portion of the
18	cigarette, moving backwards, there was a thought
19	that the last parts of the cigarette would have
20	perhaps more tar in it; the last part, closer to
21	the filter.
22	MS.KURTIN: Closer to the
1	filter, okay.
2	THE WITNESS: At least that was
3	the concern. As I said, I am not a tobacco — I am
4	not a cigarette technology person or a tobacco
5	chemist, but that was a concern.
6	BY MS. KURTIN:
7	Q And have you studied cigarette design at
8	all?
9	A I have studied it insofar as the public
10	health community was very interested in it,
11	especially the Tobacco Working Group. I mean
12	that's what they did they did, thousands of
13	experiments, trying to come up with cigarettes that
14	would produce less tar and nicotine. So from that
15	point of view, I did, not from the point of view of
16	how cigarettes are put together or manufactured —
17	not at all.
18	Q So no independent study on how a
19	cigarette is engineered?
20	A No, mine is — my understanding of that
21	comes from how the public health community
22	evaluated cigarette design, in terms of health
1	risks.
2	Q Would you know if it's possible to
3	engineer a cigarette that could — strike that. We
4	will get into that a little later.
5	Number three on Page 3 of this report
6	states that: Promotion of a low tar and nicotine
7	cigarette might lull the consumer into believing he
8	could smoke this kind of cigarette without any
9	accompanying risk.
10	Discussing this concern, what is your
11	opinion about how valid this concern was for
12	informing the public about potential benefits of
13	low tar cigarettes?
14	MR. NARKO: Objection.
15	THE WITNESS: Well, I - you
16	know, I think the next sentence there, I think is
17	sort of the answer to that is that: The presence
18	of warning label on the package, control over
19	advertising statements which are permitted, and the
20	continuing educational efforts of the public health
21	agencies on this subject should minimize this
22	likelihood. I think that's how they looked at it.
1	Now, in other words, the pub he health
2	community was very clear that the primary message
3	was don’t smoke and stop if you do.
4	It was if you — you know, and then the
5	public health, in fact, the federal government's
6	program, which came -- started in 1968, was if you
7	must smoke.
8	If you must smoke, five ways to reduce,
9	and one of those ways was low tar and nicotine, so
10	1 think we always have to — we always have to —
11	when we talk about low yield, we always have to
12	understand that that was way down on the list. The
13	first message was always stop and don't start.
14	BY MS. KURTIN:
15	Q And when you compare the alleged
16	benefits of smoking lower tar products versus not
17	smoking at all, what kind of risks are associated
18	with smoking low tar cigarettes?
19	A Well, at what point we’re talking about?
20	Q Let’s start in 1966.
21	A Okay, in -- because, in 1966 the human
22	epidemiology studies were not in yet, to talk about
1	the benefits. It was — but even in some of the
2	earlier epidemiological studies — studies,
3	certainly not smoking or — was — certainly had a
4	much, you know -- let me start, let me start back
5	on this, again. I think I have a way that might be
6	easier to understand.
7	The benefits in 1966, the benefits of
8	low tar were based on animal experiments only. The
9	epidemiological studies began in the following year
10	and years afterward, the human studies, where that
11	answer could be done.
12	But at the time that they wrote this, it
13	was — they were basing this on animal studies.
14	Q And going back to a discussion we had on
15	Friday, did animal studies have certain limitations
16	about their applicability of evaluating the data
17	compared to how humans smoked?
18	MR. NARKO: Objection.
19	THE WITNESS: Of course animal
20	experiments did. I mean these were based on skin
21	tar painting studies. Skin is not the same as
22	lung. Painting is not the same as inhalation.
1	But what Wynder and others found
2	promising was that when the concentration of
3	cigarette tar that was being painted on the backs
4	of mice was reduced and, in fact, in his
5	experiments reduced by 40 percent, he was no longer
6	able to produce skin tumors, and so his hypothesis
7	was that if — you know, if cigarette tar could be
8	lowered 40 percent or more, it might lower the
9	risk.
10	BY MS. KURTIN:
11	Q Now, when Wynder does his experiments in
12	1957, is Dr. Wynder investigating the effects of
13	lowered nicotine or is he concentrating on the
14	potential effects of lower tar?
15	A In tobacco, tar and nicotine is a fixed
16	concentration, and so, as the concentration of tar
17	is reduced, the nicotine reduces at the same time.
18	But primarily, Wynder, I think, was
19	interested in tar. In other words, the — only in
20	a few instances in the history of smoking and
21	health have I come across examples where scientists
22	thought that nicotine was related in any way with
1	lung cancer.
2	Occasionally that would come up as a
3	potential, as a co-carcinogen, or some sort of
4	promoting — co, C-O, carcinogen, but for the most
5	part nicotine was not thought to be a component of
6	the cancer concern, so — so — but as I say,
7	because it was a fixed percentage of concentration
8	of nicotine in tobacco, the lower tar cigarette
9	would have lower nicotine.
10	Q When you say that nicotine was not
11	associated with cancer, lung cancer, was nicotine
12	ever associated with other diseases?
13	A At what time period?
14	Q Let’s start in 1966.
15	A In 1966, nicotine — one hypothesis was
16	that nicotine might have been associated with the
17	heart disease. And that's because nicotine can
18	increase the heart rate, and it can increase blood
19	pressure transiently. And so the thought was that
20	perhaps this was the way that smokers could develop
21	heart disease, but it was really a sort of
22	hypothesis in 1966.
1	Q And did that view come to change over
2	time?
3	A It did. In that certainly, I think, by
4	the 1980s, the thought that nicotine was involved
5	in the heart disease, I think had dropped down.
6	Q And by the 1980s, was nicotine
7	associated with any other diseases?
8	A I — as I sit here this morning, I don’t
9	know if I can — I mean nicotine was — by the
10	1980s, was being hypothesized as the drug that
11	was — that was habituating. So if you look at
12	habituation as a disease, nicotine was associated
13	with that.
14	Q And by the 1980s was the term — was the
15	term "addiction" being used?
16	A Well, yes, addiction — I was — I was
17	using that in that sense. I mean certainly the
18	concept of the possibility of nicotine addiction
19	was used by some members of the public health
20	community even then.
21	Q Back to your description of the tar and
22	nicotine content, it's a fixed correlation?
1	A That's my understanding. Again, I am
2	not a tobacco chemist, but my understanding is — I
3	think the fixed percentage differs with the —
4	there are many, many different kinds of tobacco,
5	and I think it differs, depending on the tobacco
6	plant that's being used to produce the cigarette.
7	Q Could the tar and nicotine ratio be
8	manipulated in any way?
9	MR. NARKO: Objection.
10	THE WITNESS: In 1966?
11	BY MS. KURTIN:
12	Q Let’s try 1966, yes.
13	A I — well, certainly by lowering or
14	changing the type of plant that was used to produce
15	the tobacco, it was possible to lower tar and
16	nicotine ratings in a given cigarette, but I get
17	the thrust of your question is, was nicotine ever
18	added to cigarettes; is that what you are saying?
19	Is what you are —
20	Q No, you don’t need to read too much into
21	it.
22	Just could a cigarette be engineered —
1	maybe one potential way would be to add nicotine,
2	but could you have a low tar and a high nicotine
3	cigarette?
4	MR. NARKO: Objection.
5	THE WITNESS: My knowledge of
6	this comes, again, from the Tobacco Working Group.
7	One of the things that the Tobacco
8	Working Group wanted to do is produce a safer
9	cigarette, and what it found was, as they remove
10	more and more tar, and so nicotine also goes
11	because of the fixed concentrations from
12	cigarettes, it got to a point where smokers
13	weren’t — weren't interested in smoking those
14	cigarettes any longer.
15	And so the issue — and acceptability
16	was a key component of the Tobacco Working Group.
17	In other words, they realized that if they
18	engineered a cigarette that no one smoked that they
19	really hadn't accomplished their public health
20	goal.
21	And so — so one of the hypotheses that
22	the public health community came up with, and it’s
1	associated with again with Michael Russell, was
2	maybe it would be possible to engineer a cigarette
3	that was low in tar, as that was the lung cancer
4	risk, but would have a relative increase in
5	nicotine, and that would satisfy the taste and
6	physiological needs of smokers.
7	And this was widely discussed in the
8	Tobacco Working Group for many years, many
9	meetings. I've read the minutes, and it was — in
10	fact, the Institute of Medicine had a conference on
11	it, too, as well as other groups, and there are
12	many possibilities of how this was going to be
13	done. One was sort of a genetic engineering of
14	tobacco plants, because different plants, as I
15	mentioned, had different ratios, and it was thought
16	that it might be possible, by breeding tobacco
17	plants selectively, that it would be possible to
18	increase the relative amount of nicotine.
19	Another was in the process of
20	reconstituted tobacco sheets, which was something
21	that the Tobacco Working Group did extensively,
22	that it might be possible for nicotine — to end up
1	with a nicotine — set nicotine in a cigarette that
2	had a higher concentration, but certainly this was
3	something the public health community was very
4	interested in in the 1970s, probably up to the
5	early '80s, and was widely discussed as a potential
6	strategy for safer cigarettes.
7	BY MS. KURTIN:
8	Q And was that strategy — you talk about
9	it in the '70s and '80s, was that strategy
10	continued?
11	A I don’t know — I don’t see the idea of
12	having a relatively high nicotine, low tar
13	cigarette. I don’t see that in the 1980s, no.
14	I am not saying that there weren't
15	people out there who were saying it but it -- it —
16	1 don’t see a lot of discussion in the public
17	health community at that point.
18	Q And you mentioned something just a
19	little earlier, that the accept ability — talking
20	about acceptability of the product — and I don't
21	want to mischaracterize what you said, but I would
22	just like to flesh out this idea — that if they,
1	meaning the Tobacco Working Group, didn’t produce a
2	product that people would smoke, they wouldn’t be
3	successful?
4	A That's right.
5	Q Isn't it a little ironic to have a
6	public health community incentive for people to
7	smoke — a public health community's goal to have a
8	product that people will continue to smoke? If the
9	message is don't smoke, and there are still a
10	number of diseases associated with smoking any low
11	tar product, isn’t it a little counterintuitive to
12	create a product that will allow people to continue
13	to smoke, if it's still a dangerous —
14	MR. NARKO: Objection.
15	MS.KURTIN: - activity?
16	MR. NARKO: Objection.
17	THE WITNESS: Let me tell you
18	what — I mean this issue was actually discussed
19	widely, and I will go back to Dr. Wynder. And—
20	and he — he just addressed this, you know — in
21	fact, he even put the question very similar to
22	himself, in sort of a rhetorical way, in a number
1	of articles he wrote.
2	What his view was that this was what he
3	called the managerial approach, public health
4	approach. And his sense was that some -- some
5	people, for whatever reasons, were going to
6	continue to smoke; a lot of them were going to
7	continue to smoke.
8	And so for these people who chose to
9	smoke, he thought that rather than just leaving
10	them to cigarettes that might be more harmful from 11a public health point of view, that it might be
12	possible to, if they weren't going to change the
13	behavior, would be able to change the product so
14	that the health risks would be less, never —
15	nothing that I've read from any member of the
16	pub he health community ever thought that the
17	disease risks would be — would be zero.
18	Occasionally they thought it might become
19	acceptable, whatever "acceptable" means.
20	But -- but Wynder — Wynder’s hope, what
21	his — in fact, when he said: Why am I
22	participating in this, is that it was — this was
1	good public health strategy for the millions of
2	people who decided to continue to smoke.
3	BY MS. KURTIN:
4	Q So there was a level of acceptable risk
5	of — I guess my — my confusion over this area is,
6	by definition, there was no — there was no safe
7	product ever identified; is that correct?
8	A That's correct. And no claim, by the
9	public health community, there really was one.
10	Q But there was a movement toward finding
11	what an acceptable level of risk might be?
12	MR. NARKO: Objection,
13	objection.
14	THE WITNESS: That’s a - that’s
15	a hard question because it gets to the nature of
16	risk and how risk would be measured, and acceptable
17	level of risk is the only way I can think, sort of
18	in a speculative sense, is you would have these
19	products. And then you would compare them with a
20	smoking — divided up into groups, into smoking,
21	and 30 years later you would be able to sort out
22	which was safer. And there are all sorts of
1	ethical components and reasons why such and such an
2	experiments wasn’t — wasn’t — wasn’t — but I
3	think the — the idea was they wanted to have a
4	cigarette as low in tar, using a variety of
5	different fashions, that would also be acceptable
6	to smokers. I think that would be -- that was a
7	goal.
8	BY MS. KURTIN:
9	Q And just to clarify, when we talk about
10	this lower tar, the evaluation is as compared to
11	the levels of lung cancer —
12	MR. NARKO: Objection.
13	BY MS. KURTIN:
14	Q — or are there other diseases
15	associated with exposure to lower tar cigarettes?
16	A Certainly lung cancer was the major
17	concern because tar — you know, based on skin
18	painting experiments, tar was the component of
19	cigarettes that people were most — were most
20	worried about, so that was — so tar and lung
21	cancer were the primary concerns of the Tobacco
22	Working Group.
1	They also had an arm that dealt with
2	heart disease, and — but the — the main concern
3	was tar and lung cancer, yes.
4	Q I’m sorry. There was a component of the
5	Tobacco Working Group that dealt with heart
6	disease?
7	A There was. There was a group of people
8	who worked on heart disease.
9	Q When they worked on heart disease —
10	Let’s talk a little bit about the
11	Tobacco Working Group. What were they doing with
12	respect to studying heart disease? Were they also
13	looking at cigarette modifications?
14	A They were. That component of the
15	Tobacco Working Group was less well developed, at
16	least in the — at least in all the things that I
17	have read.
18	I think part of that was they hadn’t
19	developed a good animal model, the equivalent of
20	the skin painting experiments, from which to be
21	able to assess which modifications would lower a
22	heart disease risk, but it was certainly something
1	they were interested in. They didn't make as much
2	progress in that direction as they did in some of
3	the others.
4	Q In addition to lung cancer and heart
5	disease, did they explore any other diseases
6	associated with smoking?
7	A Of course it was disbanded in 1977. I
8	don’t — I don't believe so. I think that their
9	primary focus was lung cancer, and as I said, they
10	were also working on heart disease, but I don’t
11	believe they were working on any -- any others.
12	Q On Page 14 you talk about the mission of
13	the Tobacco Working Group. And you state, first:
14	The identification of individuals at high risk to
15	developing tobacco-related diseases; two,
16	development and evaluation of pharmacologic and
17	behavioral intervention approaches toward smoking
18	cessation; and, three, development of a less
19	hazardous cigarette program.
20	Am I correct to say we have been
21	discussing — what we have been discussing has been
22	part of the development of the — of a less
1	hazardous cigarette?
2	A Yes, and even though this was the--
3	these three was the mission statement, what they
4	did primarily was a less hazardous cigarette.
5	Q Okay. So my question was, are you aware
6	of any research or — that they conducted, relating
7	to identification of individuals at high risk?
8	A There were hundreds of papers that came
9	out of the Tobacco Working Group, and I can't
10	recall this morning how many dealt with the first
11	two here. I mean that's something I could, if you
12	are interested in, I could go back and look at, but
13	I can’t — I can't think at the moment how many.
14	Most of them had — most of the, I
15	think, the energy of the Tobacco Working Group was
16	in the lower — low-yield cigarettes.
17	Q And when you say hundreds of papers came
18	out of the Tobacco Working Group, the papers that
19	you're talking about, were they attributed to the
20	Tobacco Working Group, or were they by authors who
21	had participated in the Tobacco Working Group?
22	A Both. I mean there were a number of —
1	the publications that came out of the Tobacco
2	Working Group are in several forms. Some of them
3	were very large status reports, and the reports of
4	the experimental cigarettes, status reports that
5	would probably be hereon every six months, so there
6	probably would be nine or ten of those anyway.
7	The experimental cigarette series, there
8	were five. Those are very thick, and I forget how
9	many experimental cigarettes they had, you know,
10	50-, 60,000 they had. They were trying quite a
11	few, various combinations, to see about the disease
12	potential of those, and so those — and then
13	they -- the Tobacco Working Group held countless
14	workshops and seminars, both for members of the
15	Tobacco Working Group and for other people who
16	were — who joined them.
17	Those publications, the seminars,
18	workshops, the — the status reports, and the
19	experimental cig — those are federal government
20	publications.
21	Then there were — one of the things the
22	Tobacco Working Group did, is sort of if you look
1	at them, they were a policy group, so they decided
2	which way they wanted to go.
3	They also passed on — on grants from
4	scientists who were working, you know,
5	independently from the Tobacco Working Group, and
6	so there is a group of papers that were done by
7	people, basically they applied for grants and they
8	did the research and they published it. And there
9	are papers in that series.
10	The Tobacco Working Group itself, who
11	had very distinguished scientists on it, and those
12	people, in addition, some of them got money from
13	the Tobacco Working Group and others, they also
14	published in this mode, so — so altogether in this
15	group, there are at least 300 publications and I
16	think — I think more, because in looking at some
17	of the documents that have been produced in the
18	federal case, the administrator of the Tobacco
19	Working Group was something called Enviro, and
20	Enviro published a four-volume report, at the end
21	of the Tobacco Working Group. I think it was
22	published a few years later, 1980, 1981, and the
1	fourth volume, I believe, is a bibliography, and I
2	believe that that indicates there are probably more
3	than 300 publications.
4	Q Just to clarify, what was the role that
5	Enviro played with the Tobacco Working Group?
6	A I think it's — my read of this, the
7	Tobacco Working Group started in 1968. Enviro came
8	in to sort of help administer the program, I think,
9	somewhere around 1974.
10	Q And when do you say Tobacco Working
11	Group was disbanded?
12	A In June 30th, 1977.
13	Q So Enviro administered the program for
14	approximately three — over three years but —
15	A As you would imagine, nothing--I mean
16	the Tobacco Working Group were out of existence on
17	that date, but research projects that had been
18	started continued, and so — so I believe — I
19	think from reading the report, it seems like they
20	were also involved, you know, up through 1980.
21	Q Up through 1980?
22	A '80, yes.
1	Q And that was the continuation of
2	projects that had begun before the Tobacco Working
3	Group had disbanded?
4	A Yes. The best I can tell, yes.
5	Q And where did the funding come from
6	those projects; if the Tobacco Working Group had
7	disbanded in 1977, how did the research continue?
8	A I haven't studied the funding
9	completely, but I would imagine that the — that
10	these moneys have been committed by the federal
11	government, and they just continued until the end
12	of the project. That’s often how science grants
13	are. They give a three-year granting cycle, and so
14	1 assume that's where the money — the money
15	continued, because it had already been
16	appropriated, but I am not sure.
17	Q And the status reports that you talked
18	about that were put out every six months, were they
19	pub he documents; were they circulated to the
20	general public; were they internal status reports?
21	If you could have a number of status reports, would
22	these be —
1	A They have Department of HEW numbers on
2	them. They are cited as documents. I guess you
3	could, if you wrote to the superintendent of
4	documents, you could — you could get them.
5	How widely they were circulated, I don't
6	know. You certainly see status reports and also
7	the reports of experimental cigarettes. You —I
8	see them in footnotes of scientific articles, so I
9	think that they were available, but how widely
10	available, I don’t know.
11	Q And your review of the material related
12	to the Tobacco Working Group, can you just describe
13	for me what your research methodology was, in
14	researching this topic?
15	A Mm-hmm. Well, the first thing I did was
16	I — when I got ahold of the names of the people
17	who were on the — on the board of the Tobacco
18	Working Group, these scientists, I put together
19	their CVs, and I put together what they had
20	published, and began looking, especially in the
21	years that the Tobacco Working Group was -- because
22	these scientists obviously had a career before and
1	a career after, and I was looking for what they had
2	done, you know, during the years that the Tobacco
3	Working Group was in existence.
4	And as you would expect, that many of
5	these people actually dealt with the work of the
6	Tobacco Working Group, and I was looking for
7	particular statements about how they were
8	organized, what they were -- what their philosophy
9	was, what they were learning.
10	What was particularly helpful was that
11	they would go into a professional group, for
12	example, and tell them what they were doing, and
13	that often gave me sort of a historical window in
14	which to view that. In doing this, I became aware
15	that the Tobacco Working Group had publications
16	itself, status reports and the experimental
17	cigarettes.
18	Up until the federal case became — you
19	know, discovery process, I had a handful of the
20	status reports, and some of the experimental
21	cigarette reports.
22	Since the discovery of the federal case,
1	I think now I have all of the status reports, and
2	the — and the experimental cigarette series.
3	Also in the discovery of the federal
4	case, there are minutes of every meeting. There
5	are subcommittee reports, so it's really — it's
6	possible to put together a much fuller picture of
7	what the Tobacco Working Group was doing.
8	Q So in coming to your opinions about the
9	Tobacco Working Group and your report that you are
10	talking about, Exhibit 3, did the material that you
11	reviewed, produced in this case, in this federal
12	case, was that material you reviewed after the
13	preparation of this expert report?
14	A Yes.
15	Q And did your review of that material
16	influence your opinions about these issues?
17	A It gives me a much broader range of
18	examples, but the — my conclusions are the same.
19	Q And are you continuing to review
20	material related to the Tobacco Working Group?
21	A I am.
22	Q And how is that happening? Are you
1	asking for material; is material being forwarded to
2	you on a regular basis; are you asking for
3	particular information and that is provided to you?
4	MR. NARKO: Objection.
5	THE WITNESS: What I have done
6	is I’ve asked for all material that relates to
7	Tobacco Working Group. Some of that, I think, is
8	continuing to be brought forth, so I am looking at
9	that. As I go through material, it also raises
10	questions. Someone will refer to a document in
11	their — and I'll ask, has this one been produced,
12	and that gets additional material, in that respect.
13	BY MS. KURTIN:
14	Q But prior to this federal case, when you
15	had researched the Tobacco Working Group, did you
16	attempt to get any of the material independently,
17	going to medical libraries, the National Archives?
18	A Well, the publications of the Tobacco
19	Working Group, I — I had. I don’t know if I had
20	all of them, but in the status reports, especially
21	the one from, I believe, December of 1978, there is
22	a bibliography of publications, and that's why I
1	had gotten those publications. And those are
2	all — you know, you can get those in medical
3	libraries. And I — as I said, I had a few of the
4	status reports, and I had some of the experimental
5	cigarettes, but I have a much fuller understanding
6	now than I did when I wrote this.
7	Q And going through the experimental
8	cigarettes, you said that there were five reports.
9	Can you tell me a little bit about these
10	experimental cigarettes? What was — what was the
11	program with respect to these experimental
12	cigarettes, your understanding of it?
13	A Well, okay, it’s — it's fairly
14	complicated, and these are very, very thick
15	reports, but what the Tobacco Working Group did was
16	it started with standard research cigarettes. In
17	the beginning they are produced by the University
18	of Kentucky, and then they made many, many, many
19	modifications of these experimental cigarettes, and
20	then would test to see what the two were
21	producing — capabilities were on rodent skin.
22	And so they would modify the tobacco,
1	they would modify filters, they would modify paper,
2	they would modify additives. They would do many,
3	many components, trying to come up with, you know,
4	cigarettes that would be -- would have less
5	cancer-producing capabilities.
6	So it is just page after page after page
7	of all of these modifications being done.
8	Q And these modifications, was the common
9	denominator testing it against the tar painting
10	experiments?
11	A Yes, yes.
12	Q And -
13	A And there were also — another arm was
14	also working on inhalation. We talked about this
15	on Friday afternoon. I think the scientific
16	community thought inhalation experiments would be
17	closer to the gold standard, and they were working
18	on models of inhalation -- you know, unsuccessful,
19	as we talked about, but that was certainly a
20	component. Their testing arm was skin painting.
21	Q And what animals did they use for the
22	attempts in the inhalation experiments; do you
1	recall?
2	A Well, one --1 know one of the
3	outsourced one was to Auerbach and beagles, which
4	led to a very famous paper about that, but the
5	in-house inhalation, I — I can't — I don't
6	recall. I think a rodent of some kind, but whether
7	it is what kind of mouse or what kind of rat or
8	rabbit, I don't know.
9	Q When you say "in-house" versus
10	"outsourcing," what was — how was the program
11	organized, in terms of the conducting of these
12	research experiments?
13	A I'm not — well, I -- I think every —
14	I'm not sure exactly how the decision was made,
15	how -- of what was done by — I think most of the
16	work was done, was commissioned by places like
17	Oakridge, and — and — at least some of it, and
18	some was done by individual investigators that had
19	no federal connection.
20	How they decided, I don't know, other
21	than, I suspect, that they — they awarded grants
22	to people they thought had the expertise to perform
1	the experiments.
2	Q And the standard research cigarette that
3	you talked about, you said first it was designed or
4	produced — I don't want to say designed, it was
5	produced by the University of Kentucky?
6	A Yes.
7	Q At a later point, did the production
8	change?
9	A I think there were all — they were all
10	based on the University of Kentucky. The reason
11	they used these standardized cigarettes, because I
12	think cigarettes in a pack can be a little bit
13	different from all the rest. They aren't — they
14	aren’t totally uniform, and so for experimental
15	purposes, they use experimental cigarettes, because
16	great effort is made to make sure every cigarette
17	is the same, and that's the purpose of using a
18	research cigarette.
19	And I — I believe at least the
20	beginning products were all made by the University
21	of Kentucky, but I'm not completely certain about
22	that.
1	Q At any later point did any of the
2	cigarette manufacturers produce the experimental
3	cigarettes?
4	A I don’t know.
5	Q Do you know in their experiments if any
6	commercial brands of cigarettes were actually
7	tested?
8	A Tobacco Working Group, no, because that
9	wasn't the purpose. They were — they were mod —
10	commercial cigarettes were already done. They were
11	the process of coming up with something new, and so
12	as far as I know, they never used a commercial
13	cigarette.
14	Q So there was no investigation how one
15	brand compared with another brand on the market?
16	A I don’t think that that was ever a
17	component of the Tobacco Working Group that I've
18	seen, no.
19	Q And the production of these experimental
20	cigarettes, the modifications that — were
21	modifications proposed and then variations
22	produced, of all these different variables, and
1	then you would — different types of cigarettes
2	then tested for various tests and skin paint tests
3	or inhalation tests?
4	A Yes.
5	Q And how is the decision reached as to
6	what the standard would be? You talk about varying
7	components, but you have to vary it from something,
8	so how did they reach a decision about what the
9	baseline was?
10	A How did they know when they had gotten
11	there?
12	Q Well, where did they start from?
13	A Well, they started from the standard
14	cigarette, which was — was -- my understanding was
15	that — is that the standard cigarette was
16	something close to, you know, a — popular
17	cigarettes, when this started to be done in the
18	early 1970s.
19	But I'm not — I'm not any — not trying
20	to mimic any given cigarette, but it started there.
21	Q A compilation; you don't know?
22	A I don’t know.
1	Q Do you know if it was a standard
2	cigarette based upon a regular product or a low tar
3	product?
4	A I don’t know.
5	And the reason I am being kind of vague
6	there, between 1968, when the Tobacco Working Group
7	started and '77, commercial cigarettes were —
8	that’s one of the periods where they had the most
9	change in tar in commercial cigarettes, too, so
10	what was considered high tar in one stage, you
11	know, or low tar in one stage, would be considered
12	moderate tar five years later. So it was a very —
13	it was much of a -- it was a very moving target
14	during this period.
15	Q Wouldn't it be hard to come up with a
16	standard to propose these variations, if the
17	moving — if there was such a moving target and
18	what—
19	MR. NARKO: Objection.
20	THE WITNESS: Well, let's look
21	and see what the recommendations were. The use of
22	filters, especially ventilated filters, those, of
1	course, can be used for any particular kind of, you
2	know, tobacco.
3	Porous paper that surrounded the
4	cylinder was another. Using the process of
5	reconstituted tobacco sheets, again that can start
6	with, I believe, you know, any type of tobacco. I
7	may be wrong about that.
8	Using parts of the tobacco plant that
9	had less tar in them, so the stems and other parts
10	had less tar potential. Using a puffed and
11	expanded tobacco. I mean these are the — these
12	are — that's the kind of recommendation that the
13	Tobacco Working Group was doing.
14	BY MS. KURTIN:
15	Q Now, if you use a ventilated filter, I
16	just want to clarify, what do you mean by a
17	"ventilated filter"?
18	A A ventilated filter is a filter that has
19	dilution devices. I mean — devices, I guess the
20	device, depending on how you want to define a
21	device, but basically it was to dilute the
22	cigarette smoke with air.
1	Q Is it possible for a smoker to cover up
2	or counteract a filter, if — for instance, you
3	poke a hole in a filter, could a smoker cover up —
4	MR. NARKO: Objection.
5	THE WITNESS: Well, I mean,
6	ventilation — ventilated filters, of course,
7	became one of the major components of filter
8	cigarettes. I mean, in the late 1970s, and the
9	public health community became aware fairly quickly
10	that — at least of the possibility that smokers
11	could cover — could cover vent holes.
12	Lynn Kozlowski is a person whose work is
13	associated with that, and his paper was in — the
14	first paper on this, I beheve, was in 1979 or
15	1980, and it was even mentioned in the Surgeon
16	General's report, either in 1980 or 1981. So the
17	pub he health community was concerned about the
18	issue of smokers inadvertently covering at least
19	some of the holes in the ventilated filter, either
20	with their fingers or with their lips.
21	BY MS. KURTIN:
22	Q Or could they crush the filters also,
1	just like covering up or somehow —
2	A Well, I suppose if you crushed the
3	filter, you wouldn’t get smoke through it.
4	Q I don’t smoke.
5	A I think what they were saying is you
6	pick up a cigarette and there would be an element
7	of pinching and you might — I don't think it's
8	possible to cover up all the ventilation holes on a
9	cigarette filter. I don't think that's possible.
10	Q And could that lessen the effect of the
11	filter and the exposure to tar —
12	MR. NARKO: Objection.
13	THE WITNESS: At least that was
14	the concern. Whether that is actually the case, I
15	think is a matter of some debate. In other words,
16	do — and I am not actually sure that Kozlowski in
17	his paper ever measured that there was more tar
18	getting to the smoker of — you know, with one of
19	these — with a cigarette that had been -- where
20	the ventilation filters had been partially covered.
21	I think it was a theoretical concern.
22	BY MS. KURTIN:
1	Q Do you know is there a current concern
2	over that phenomena?
3	A I don’t know whether there is still a
4	concern about that or not.
5	Q Who comprised the board of the Tobacco
6	Working Group? Well, let me start with what was
7	the structure of the Tobacco Working Group?
8	MR. NARKO: Objection.
9	MS.MOLTZEN: Is this a good
10	place to take a short break?
11	MS.KURTIN: Yes.
12	MS.MOLTZEN: Because I need a
13	short break.
14	MS.KURTIN: Let’s take a break.
15	VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the
16	record at 10:23:55.
17	(Thereupon, a recess was taken.)
18	VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the
19	record at 10:34:55.
20	BY MS. KURTIN:
21	Q Dr. English, turning to Page 13 of your
22	report, the first paragraph, you talk about: The
1	public health community realized that the
2	development of a less hazardous cigarette would
3	require the creative interaction among scientists
4	from many disciplines, pubhc health officials from
5	within the government, and from national voluntary
6	groups, and from members of the cigarette industry.
7	And my question is, our discussion about
8	the Tobacco Working Group, are you talking about
9	the Tobacco Working Group here?
10	A In — in part, yes.
11	Q Okay.
12	A Right, but that's the largest component
13	of that. It was a--you know, for an historian,
14	it's really striking that the public health
15	community really wanted an all-inclusive group, in
16	working on this particular project, and so
17	virtually all the comments about this, in this
18	early period, identified that they wanted everyone
19	involved, they wanted--especially industry. They
20	wanted industry and independent scientists, the
21	various governmental agencies, government,
22	scientists. They wanted this to be a broad —
1	broadly conceived group of people working towards
2	this end.
3	Q Why would the involvement of the
4	cigarette industry be desirable?
5	A I — because they had the knowledge of
6	how to manufacture cigarettes, and I think that one
7	of the contributions that they would be able to
8	make would be — is that these ideas that people
9	were coming up with, whether this would be — would
10	be feasible.
11	Plus they had been in the -- you know,
12	the business had a lot of experience in this, in
13	the making of cigarettes, so I think it — knowing
14	tobacco chemistry and things like that, so I think
15	they looked at these scientists as being crucial to
16	the — to the development of this — of a safer
17	cigarette.
18	Q But at some basic level were the
19	interests of the public health community and the
20	tobacco industry dissimilar, in that pub he health
21	community is interested in the well-being of the
22	pubhc; the tobacco industry was selling products
1	that were harmful to the public’s health?
2	How do you reach a common ground, if at
3	some basic level their interests are divergent?
4	MR. NARKO: Objection.
5	THE WITNESS: The public health
6	community, of course, was — their primary message
7	was stop and don't start.
8	But their next message was, for smokers
9	who, you know, chose not to stop smoking, to smoke
10	a cigarette that was less hazardous. And so it—
11	and so at least people with this managerial point
12	of view that Wynder espoused, working
13	collaboratively with the tobacco industry
14	scientists to explore ways to make a hazardous —
15	less hazardous cigarette, I think, was perfectly —
16	made perfect sense.
17	Now, parts of the public health
18	community decided it didn’t want to collaborate,
19	and I think that’s — led in part — led in part to
20	the disillusion of the Tobacco Working Group in
21	1977.
22	BY MS. KURTIN:
1	Q At some point, was it — well, strike
2	that.
3	Was it beneficial for the tobacco
4	industry to become involved in this effort to keep
5	people smoking?
6	MR. NARKO: Objection.
7	THE WITNESS: I have-I don’t
8	have any comment about that.
9	I mean I don't — I don't know. I
10	haven't studied tobacco industry documents that
11	would indicate, you know, anything along those
12	lines.
13	BY MS. KURTIN:
14	Q In reviewing material related to the
15	Tobacco Working Group, have you ever reviewed
16	internal industry documents, commentaries about the
17	participation of the Tobacco Working Group?
18	A No, I have--is the short answer. I
19	have reviewed reports and subcommittee meetings and
20	things like that of participants of the Tobacco
21	Working Group from the tobacco industry, but I have
22	not — I have not reviewed tobacco industry
1	documents in — of any kind, except those that have
2	been produced in cases in which I have been shown,
3	and so -- and that includes any internal documents
4	that might relate to the Tobacco Working Group.
5	Q In being comprehensive of a review of an
6	area, would it be important to review documents
7	that reflected the cigarette industry’s perspective
8	of their participation in the Tobacco Working
9	Group?
10	MR. NARKO: Objection.
11	THE WITNESS: Well, I do have
12	some of those, because they are part of the -- you
13	know, part of the tobacco — you know, in the
14	discovery process, I mean they are participating in
15	the minutes. I have what they are saying in
16	committee meetings, and so I think I have a good
17	sense of what these — of what these individuals
18	were thinking, and what their -- and how they were
19	contributing, so that gives me a -- a fairly clear
20	picture from that point of view.
21	BY MS. KURTIN:
22	Q For instance, if an individual
1	participated, might they not have kept individual
2	minutes or notes about their participation,
3	reflections upon their meetings, their — not the
4	public contribution, but their internal reflection,
5	their own thoughts? My example is, you reviewed
6	Dr. Robbins daily log —
7	A Mm-hmm.
8	Q — and I would expect that Dr. Robbins
9	log contained his personal opinions about the
10	conclusions that were reached, for instance,
11	with — was it the 1959 report, and it was a public
12	statement, but Dr. Robbins’ log contained his
13	personal reflections on what the report said or the
14	conclusions reached. And earlier, on Friday, you
15	testified that it was important, or you used his
16	logs to reach conclusions about the state of the
17	report. Is that correct?
18	MR. NARKO: Objection.
19	THE WITNESS: It is correct. I
20	have — in part, I reached my conclusions based on
21	Louis Robbins’ log, yes.
22	BY MS. KURTIN:
1	Q And those were personal reflections as
2	opposed to the public statements issued by —
3	A Yes.
4	Q — the Public Health Service?
5	So in this instance, in order to get a
6	comprehensive view of what happened during the --
7	or while the Tobacco Working Group was together,
8	would it be important to also review personal
9	reflections of participants in the Tobacco Working
10	Group?
11	A Of the many people who participated in
12	the Tobacco Working Group, I haven't done
13	individual papers for any of them. I haven't
14	seen — at this point, I haven't seen the need to
15	do that.
16	Q Do you think at some point in the future
17	that is something that you would consider
18	researching?
19	MR. NARKO: Objection.
20	THE WITNESS: It’s conceivable.
21	But at the moment, I don't have any plan to do
22	that.
1	BY MS. KURTIN:
2	Q And when you say members of the
3	cigarette industry, were members of the cigarette
4	industry participants of the Tobacco Working Group?
5	A Yes.
6	Q And do you know who?
7	A You know, I don't have a listing of all
8	of them here in front of me. I don’t know whether
9	you have — do you have any Tobacco Working Group
10	documents?
11	Q I don’t happen to have a report with me
12	here.
13	A But there were always two, three, four
14	members of the tobacco industry on the Tobacco
15	Working Group. As far as I know, there was no
16	point — there was rotating membership, and as far
17	as I know there was no point, with the possible
18	exception of the very first meeting, but it was
19	remedied by the second meeting, but there was no
20	point where there were not members of the tobacco
21	industry on there.
22	Q And their participation with the Tobacco
1	Working Group, they obviously had -- that wasn't
2	their full-time job; they were members of industry,
3	industry scientists, and participated in the
4	meetings or in discussions with the Tobacco Working
5	Group?
6	A Well, it was — it was not a full-time
7	job for any of the members — participants of the
8	Tobacco Working Group, so as far as I could tell,
9	they all had a day job.
10	Q Following up, the government scientists
11	that you talk about in your report that you give
12	examples of, were those government scientists
13	exclusively assigned to Tobacco Working Group?
14	A No, they had other assignments.
15	Q Do you know percentage-wise how much of
16	their time was spent on matters related to the
17	Tobacco Working Group, as opposed to their other
18	duties?
19	MR. NARKO: Objection.
20	THE WITNESS: I don’t have a-
21	I don’t have a calculation on that, no. As far as
22	I can tell — I mean that was — that particular
1	consideration was never brought up in any of the
2	documents that I've seen.
3	BY MS. KURTIN:
4	Q On Page 15, when you state: In
5	July 1977, Califano disbanded the Tobacco Working
6	Group at TWG, and its governmental members were
7	assigned to other duties.
8	When you say "assigned to other duties,"
9	they were — they already had other duties?
10	A Right.
11	Q So assigned to other duties, they just
12	continued — do you know what other duties they
13	were assigned to?
14	MR. NARKO: Objection.
15	THE WITNESS: What I meant was
16	they -- maybe perhaps more correctly they went back
17	to their other duties.
18	BY MS. KURTIN:
19	Q They went back to —
20	A Back to — continued what they were
21	doing, and the one person who was publicly
22	reassigned was the leader of the Tobacco Working
1	Group, Gio Gori.
2	Q What was he publicly reassigned to, do
3	you know?
4	A Some other responsibilities within the
5	National Cancer Institute.
6	Q And do you know why Gio Gori was
7	assigned to other duties?
8	A I can't tell you precisely why. I have
9	a theory, but I can't tell you — I mean the person
10	who was assigned doesn't explicitly say that, but I
11	have an idea of why he was reassigned.
12	Q Let’s hear your theory about why Gio
13	Gori was assigned — reassigned?
14	A Well, as the Tobacco Working Group
15	progressed through the 1970s, it — they began to
16	reach conclusions, make recommendations about
17	what — what a safer cigarette might look like.
18	And Gio Gori published this in a paper in 1976 and
19	again in 1978.
20	And in the 1976 paper, it drew a lot of
21	press coverage. And I think the press perhaps
22	overstated what the actual paper was about. And I
1	think that the publicity surrounding the
2	publication of that paper and the -- and the
3	concern that the public might — might push aside
4	the real recommendation, the first recommendation
5	of the public health community that it was stop and
6	don’t start, and might focus on the less hazardous
7	cigarette component of it, I think that that led to
8	the demise of the Tobacco Working Group, and Gio
9	Gori was the leader of that.
10	There was a controversy about the
11	publication of the paper, whether he had gotten the
12	appropriate approval. Apparently government
13	scientists are required to presubmit papers.
14	There’s a lot of documents that have actually been
15	discovered as part of discovery in this case that
16	indicate, yes, he did have permission to publish
17	the paper, but it does appear that that produced a
18	lot of concern about higher-ups in the National
19	Cancer Institute, and perhaps in the Public Health
20	Service as well.
21	Q Dr. — not Dr. — Gio Gori’s paper, did
22	Gio Gori's paper deal with the experimental
1	cigarettes that were the subjects of the Tobacco
2	Working Group's research?
3	A It was a — it was based on the research
4	of the Tobacco Working Group, and then putting,
5	like, the prescription of what a safer cigarette
6	would look like, how much nicotine, how much tar,
7	things like that, what kinds of filtering.
8	Q Did it talk about commercial products?
9	A I don't believe it talked about any
10	commercial products.
11	Q And it's your theory that the
12	controversy surrounding the publication in 1976 and
13	'78 of these papers led to the demise of the entire
14	Tobacco Working Group?
15	A Mm-hmm, but that’s my sort of a —
16	that's my — that’s a theory that I’m
17	contemplating.
18	Q Contemplating?
19	A Mm-hmm.
20	Q Do you know if there were budgetary
21	concerns in 1977 that affected the entire National
22	Cancer Institute?
1	A In my reading of — I mean there are
2	budget — it's budget material every year of the
3	Tobacco Working Group, and every year there are
4	budgetary concerns.
5	I didn't get the sense that in 1977
6	there was any more of that than in any given — at
7	any earlier point. And certainly — well, I will
8	just leave it at that. I didn’t know — in fact,
9	the surprising thing is that, you know, in meetings
10	that were held in the spring of 1977, I can’t tell
11	from the minutes that there's any concern that they
12	are about ready to get the ax.
13	Q Do you know if there are other programs
14	that were terminated or canceled within the
15	National Cancer Institute in 1977?
16	A I am not aware of any.
17	Q And when you talk about on Page 15:
18	Members of the Tobacco Working Group sponsored and
19	participated in many national and international
20	conferences.
21	When such members participated in these
22	national and international conferences, were they
1	participating in their capacity as members of the
2	Tobacco Working Group, or were they participating
3	as — in their individual capacity?
4	A They certainly would -- would often
5	mention that they were members of the Tobacco
6	Working Group. I don’t know whether they were
7	appearing as officials, members of Tobacco Working
8	Group or as individuals.
9	Q And then in the middle of that
10	paragraph, you state: As a result of these
11	efforts, many prominent members of the public
12	health community encouraged manufacturers to
13	develop cigarettes with reduced tar and nicotine
14	yields.
15	Do you believe that the manufacturers
16	should have been encouraged to develop such
17	cigarettes?
18	MR. NARKO: Objection.
19	THE WITNESS: Well, the public
20	health community, in this period, was — was — was
21	very enthusiastic about low-yield cigarettes, for
22	the residual smokers, the ones who, you know, chose
1	not to stop.
2	And so from that point of view, taking
3	the — what Wynder called the managerial approach,
4	I think it made sense for them to do that, the
5	public health community.
6	BY MS. KURTIN:
7	Q Did the cigarette industry have a
8	responsibility to the public —
9	MR. NARKO: Objection.
10	BY MS. KURTIN:
11	Q — to follow those recommendations?
12	MR. NARKO: Objection.
13	THE WITNESS: I don’t know
14	whether they had a responsibility or not. You
15	know, I think that they were responsive to the
16	pub he health community in that respect.
17	BY MS. KURTIN:
18	Q In what sense? In creating products?
19	A Yes. In creating products. I mean the
20	pubhc health community encouraged them to make
21	lower yield cigarettes, and they did.
22	Q Could it also be interpreted that it was
1	a self-serving response in that if they created
2	products that complied with the public health
3	community's recommendations, that would cause
4	people to keep smoking?
5	MR. NARKO: Objection.
6	THE WITNESS: I don’t know
7	exactly how to -- I mean I haven't come across any
8	documents that would indicate that -- I mean
9	certainly the public health community was
10	encouraging smokers to smoke low-yield products,
11	and so in that sense, I guess, the tobacco industry
12	may have been — I mean, this is -- I am getting
13	perhaps afield from -- of that, but they, perhaps
14	responding to consumer demand for lower yield
15	cigarettes, I don't know.
16	BY MS. KURTIN:
17	Q Where did this consumer demand for lower
18	yield products come from?
19	A I think the — the consumer was
20	responding to the public health message to smoke
21	lower yield cigarettes. I mean certainly if you
22	look at the trend in — in cigarettes, from the
1	late 1950s on, it’s for cigarettes, first of all,
2	to become almost universally filtered and steadily
3	decreasing, you know, tar and nicotine content, and
4	that, in a sense, that the public was responding to
5	the — to the public health community's concerns.
6	Q So the public and the consumers were
7	responding to the public health community's
8	message, and then the industry was responding to
9	the consumer's desires, by creating low —
10	MR. NARKO: Objection.
11	THE WITNESS: Well, this is
12	getting beyond — I haven't looked at internal
13	company documents. I mean I think that's -- there
14	is a certain logic to that, but I don’t know, you
15	know, I don't know what — what led to certain, you
16	know, manufacturing decisions.
17	BY MS. KURTIN:
18	Q And going to--when we talked about, on
19	Friday, the declining rate of smokers, we go from
20	close to 50 percent, before the 1964 Surgeon
21	General's report; is that correct?
22	A Yes.
1	Q To, I believe it was 32 percent, I
2	believe you said in 1989, according to the public
3	opinion polls. And then — could one reason why
4	the high number of residual smokers be the choice
5	of these lower tar products on the market, so that
6	people would continue to smoke, despite being aware
7	of the health risks associated with smoking?
8	MR. NARKO: Objection.
9	THE WITNESS: I don't have an
10	opinion on that.
11	BY MS. KURTIN:
12	Q Okay. When you say: In 1971, the
13	Second World Conference on Smoking and Health
14	recommended that the manufacturers should be
15	encouraged to produce cigarettes with increasingly
16	lower tar and nicotine yields, was there some sort
17	of publication put out by the Second World
18	Conference on Smoking and Health?
19	A Yes.
20	Q Do you know what that publication was?
21	A There is a report on it and it was
22	covered also in medical journals, and I’m sorry, I
1	can’t -- I can get it for you.
2	Q Okay. But there was a publication put
3	out by —
4	A Yes, yes. There is a publication put
5	out on that, yes.
6	Q Do you know when Califano became
7	Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare?
8	A I assume it was January, 1977.
9	Q And when did the Tobacco Working Group
10	disband?
11	A June 30th,'77.
12	Q And was there material that you reviewed
13	that led you to the conclusion: These scientific
14	findings had hard policy ramifications and the
15	current Surgeon General, Julius Richmond, and
16	Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Joseph
17	Califano, came to believe that the success of the
18	Tobacco Working Group, less hazardous cigarette
19	project would overwhelm the primary message of stop
20	and don’t start?
21	A A year later — well, a year after
22	Califano became Secretary of HEW, he started his
1	own program, to much -- much — much public press
2	and media fanfare was launched in January 1978.
3	And in, you know, all of the press in there, he --
4	what he clearly stated was that the message should
5	now be: Stop and don't start. And that — and in
6	that he eliminated the safer cigarette as — as
7	something that the federal government was not going
8	to be participating in.
9	Q But I — but that's after the Tobacco
10	Working Group was disbanded?
11	A Right, I have no —
12	Q So going to the decision to disband?
13	A I have no documents about--at this
14	point about — you know, contemporary documents
15	stating precisely why he disbanded the Tobacco
16	Working Group.
17	Q So just to clarify, your opinion about
18	the disbanding of the Tobacco Working Group, you
19	are looking at a 1978 campaign by Secretary
20	Califano?
21	MR. NARKO: Objection.
22	THE WITNESS: The beginnings of
1	that — that plus the global reading that I've done
2	on this subject, is what I'm basing this on.
3	BY MS. KURTIN:
4	Q And when you talk about the optimism —
5	and I believe optimism of assessing what a less
6	hazardous cigarette product — less hazardous
7	cigarette would look like, when you say it was
8	published widely in the scientific and medical
9	literature and covered enthusiastically in the
10	popular press, what types of articles were
11	available in the public press concerning these
12	matters?
13	A That, you know--that there was a safer
14	cigarette that was — that was potentially
15	producible, and so I think there was a lot of —
16	lot of enthusiasm that this managerial approach was
17	going to be successful.
18	Q In newspaper articles?
19	A Newspapers; right.
20	Q Magazines?
21	A Right.
22	Q And these articles that covered this
1	potentially less hazardous cigarette, did the
2	articles discuss the residual or -- not the
3	residual, the actual effects, though, of what
4	smoking those products would be, that they were
5	still dangerous that —
6	A I think in all of these publications,
7	including the ones in both the scientific and the
8	popular press, all mentioned that the — it was far
9	better not to smoke, and to — and if you were a
10	smoker, then to stop. It was never touted as an
11	alternative to stopping.
12	Q I guess there is a difference, though,
13	between stop, and if you must smoke, then smoke
14	these products, and then discussing the actual
15	health effects of smoking these new products?
16	A Oh, I see. Okay —
17	MR. NARKO: Objection.
18	THE WITNESS: I think I
19	understand your question now.
20	I'm not sure that the Tobacco Working
21	Group or Gio Gori, when he published this, knew
22	what the long-term health consequences of smoking,
1	even these proposed products would be. I mean
2	those are — the only way to do that would be
3	long-term epidemiological studies, which were not
4	done, had not been done.
5	BY MS. KURTIN:
6	Q So I guess my question is, it couldn’t
7	quantify how much better these -- well, could the
8	studies quantify how much better these new products
9	might be?
10	MR. NARKO: Objection.
11	THE WITNESS: I’m - I don't
12	believe that they ever made that quantification.
13	BY MS. KURTIN:
14	Q So for the information that the public
15	was receiving, would the public be able to
16	understand the ramifications of, okay, I know I
17	should stop, if I am not going to stop, I should
18	smoke a lower yield is what they are telling me,
19	but how dangerous are these lower products — lower
20	yield products to me?
21	MR. NARKO: Objection.
22	THE WITNESS: Okay, let me
1	understand your question.
2	Are you thinking particularly of the
3	hypothetical cigarette? Which, of course, Gori
4	wasn’t talking about any particular cigarette, when
5	he — or are you talking about in general about
6	what the public’s perception was of low-yield
7	cigarettes? I mean that's what I am having a
8	little —
9	BY MS. KURTIN:
10	Q I'm sorry for the confusion. Let's see.
11	You’re talking about the Tobacco Working Group's
12	work was widely covered in the scientific and
13	medical literature. And I am trying to figure out
14	what message the public was able to take away from
15	this widely covered material about what the Tobacco
16	Working Group was doing?
17	MR. NARKO: Objection.
18	THE WITNESS: Well, I am not
19	aware that -- I mean there's — for example, any
20	public opinion poll that said, you know, that in
21	any way tried to measure the Tobacco Working
22	Group's work, so I can't give you a specific number
1	on that.
2	BY MS. KURTIN:
3	Q Had there been public opinion polls
4	about the health risks of low — we talked about on
5	Friday the public perception of the health
6	consequences of smoking.
7	Have there been similar public opinion
8	polls on the consequences of smoking low tar and
9	nicotine products?
10	A I — I’m not — I'm not aware that the
11	Gallop organization conducted a poll like that, as
12	I sit here. I can’t recall one.
13	And I can’t recall that the federal
14	government conducted a poll, as I'm thinking back,
15	you know, through the polls that they’ve — that
16	they -- that they decided in individual Surgeon
17	General's reports, so I'm not — I'm not aware
18	exactly what — I'm not sure I know what the public
19	opinion awareness was on that, as I sit here. I
20	can't recall.
21	Q And going to the 1981 Surgeon General's
22	report that does discuss low tar — strike that.
1	Just for a point of clarification, we
2	have been using a lot of terms and I just want
3	to — earlier you said "low yield." You meant that
4	to be synonymous with "low tar"; is that correct?
5	A For the most part. Low yield can — it
6	usually means low tar, low nicotine.
7	Q Is there a difference between filtered
8	cigarettes versus non-filtered cigarettes, or are
9	filtered cigarettes also low-yield cigarettes?
10	A Well, certainly we are, in this period
11	now, in the 1970s, virtually all cigarettes are
12	filtered cigarettes, so I look at the low yield
13	movement as filter and lower tar and nicotine.
14	Q Okay.
15	A Both.
16	Q So you include the filter —
17	A It includes it; right.
18	Q And is there a requirement that the
19	cigarette industry use filters on their industry?
20	A A requirement?
21	Q Mm-hmm.
22	A Not that I am aware of.
1	MS. KURTIN: Going to the 1981
2	Surgeon General's report —
3	(English Exhibit No. 19 - January, 1981
4	portions of the Surgeon General’s report,
5	"The Health Consequences of Smoking" - was
6	marked for identification.)
7	BY MS. KURTIN:
8	Q Dr. English, I am handing you what's
9	been marked as Exhibit 19. This is portions of the
10	Surgeon General’s report entitled, "The Health
11	Consequences of Smoking: The Changing Cigarette."
12	I believe it’s the preface and the first chapter.
13	Are you familiar with this document?
14	A I am.
15	Q Excuse me while I turn to the page I am
16	looking for.
17	MS.KURTIN: Could we take a
18	break for a moment?
19	VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off record
20	for tape change. This is the end of tape number
21	one. The time off the record 11:09 and 50 seconds.
22	(Thereupon, a recess was taken.)
1	VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the
2	record at 11:21:52. This is the start of tape
3	number two.
4	BY MS. KURTIN:
5	Q Dr. English, right before we broke, we
6	started to talk about the 1981 Surgeon General's
7	report.
8	A Yes.
9	Q You state in your report that: And
10	notwithstanding Secretary Califano’s decision to
11	disband the TWG, 18 months later the Surgeon
12	General announced anew study of the low-yield
13	cigarette, in essence reviewing the conclusions of
14	the 1967 Public Health Service Technical Report.
15	The 1967 Public Health Service Technical
16	Report is the report we discussed earlier this
17	morning?
18	A The preponderance, yes.
19	Q The preponderance.
20	A Yes.
21	Q And then you quote part of the 1981
22	Surgeon General’s report.
1	I have a question. You state: The new
2	conclusions pubhshed as "The Health Consequences
3	of Smoking: The Changing Cigarette,’1 a report of
4	the Surgeon General 1981 — despite the wishes of
5	the bureaucratic readership — largely reaffirmed
6	the earlier Technical Report.
7	Can you please elaborate on what you
8	mean by "despite the wishes of the bureaucratic
9	leadership"?
10	A Well, Secretary Califano was very clear
11	that he thought that the appropriate message was
12	stop and don’t smoke.
13	As I mentioned earlier, Dr. Gori had
14	pubhshed two papers, in '76 and '78, and
15	especially one in the '78, the Department of HEW
16	and the Public Health Service actually came out and
17	condemned that paper, and so we — I — we do know
18	from the public record what officials in the Public
19	Health Service, in the National Cancer Institute
20	thought about — of that low-yield safer cigarette
21	approach, and that’s what I'm drawing that from.
22	Q But "despite the wishes of the
1	bureaucratic leadership," meaning that the 1981
2	Surgeon General's report was published despite
3	those wishes?
4	A No, let me be clear. After the
5	disbanding of the TWG, Congress actually asked that
6	the Surgeon General review the low tar — reveal
7	the low tar situation, because after all, the
8	government had spent eight or nine years in the
9	business of — of working to produce this, and then
10	it had been disbanded, and the disbanding itself
11	was an event that was covered in the media.
12	That happened in the summer, as I
13	mentioned, the fall, I believe in October, Congress
14	asked that — in fact they had a hearing and
15	Dr. Gori appeared in the hearing, and I think as a
16	consequence of the hearing, there was a request
17	that the Surgeon General review the low tar issue
18	which it did indeed happen, which — which it
19	subsequently ended — came to fruition with the
20	1981 Surgeon General’s report.
21	In the interim, between 1977 and 1981,
22	many of the leadership, you know, had a chance to
1	comment on this whole safer cigarette program. And
2	I think it’s clear from my reading of these is that
3	they were hoping that the — that the review
4	would — would — would lead to different
5	conclusions, and that's what's meant by that, lead
6	to the conclusion that, you know, that stop and
7	don’t start was really the only message.
8	Q In the 1981 report, though, the part
9	that you quote states that: Overall, our judgment
10	is unchanged from that of 1966 and 1979. Smokers
11	who are unwilling or as of yet unable to quit are
12	well-advised to switch to cigarettes yielding less
13	tar and nicotine, provided they do not increase
14	their smoking in other ways.
15	Doesn’t the report go on to state
16	though: But our new review raises new questions
17	and suggests an even more cautious approach to the
18	issue?
19	A It does. And I was — you know, I
20	quoted that sentence which — that you just read
21	and — but it’s a big report; I didn't quote the
22	whole report.
1	Q Understood. Number one, the first
2	finding of the report states that: There is no
3	safe cigarette and no safe level of consumption.
4	A Mm-hmm.
5	Q And number two, talking about smoking of
6	cigarettes with lower yields of tar and nicotine,
7	it says however — at the end of number two:
8	However, the benefits are minimal in comparison
9	with giving up cigarettes entirely. The single
10	most effective way to reduce hazards of smoking
11	continues to be that of quitting entirely.
12	A Absolutely.
13	Q And does this differ in any way with
14	Califano's message in 1978 that the focus should be
15	on stopping smoking?
16	A I don’t think that Cahfano's approach
17	took into account the millions of residual smokers,
18	other than to give them the advice to stop smoking,
19	and I think what Wynder and others in the pub he
20	health community, even after the demise of the
21	Tobacco Working Group, continued to say that there
22	were going to be — there were people that were
1	going to continue to smoke, and for them it was
2	not — in fact, Wynder got more colorful in his
3	phrasing as time went on. He said it wasn't a
4	humane thing to do, to basically give them no
5	alternative. In other words, he thought there were
6	going to be people who weren’t going to stop
7	smoking on their own, and if there was a way to
8	lessen their risk, even if it says in the report
9	here, you know, to some extent, that was a
10	worthwhile endeavor.
11	Q Could more effort have been put into
12	investigating smoking cessation and going back to
13	the original mission of the Tobacco Working Group,
14	which was, number one, identification of those at
15	high risk; and, number two, exploring smoking
16	cessation? As opposed to continuing in effort into
17	low tar, low nicotine cigarettes, could more effort
18	be placed in identifying people at high risk and
19	smoking cessation to combat the problems of
20	smoking?
21	MR. NARKO: Objection.
22	THE WITNESS: Well, certainly,
1	in reading the Surgeon General’s reports, virtually
2	all of them talk about the — where the medical
3	community was in smoking cessation medicines, where
4	other types of — of smoking cessation modes of
5	treatment, such as, you know, group therapy and
6	individual therapy, and a workplace related, and so
7	it was not an area that was neglected that I can
8	see. As I say it wasn't primarily a focus of the
9	Tobacco Working Group, as it evolved.
10	But areas of smoking cessation were
11	widely discussed in the public health community.
12	BY MS. KURTIN:
13	Q But you mentioned — was it Wynder?
14	A Wynder.
15	Q Who got more colorful and said a more
16	humane --
17	A Wynder never — I don't want to
18	misrepresent him at all. Wynder was always: Stop
19	and don’t start. Nobody, I think, comes across in
20	the public health community says we are going to
21	abandon this stop and don’t start. That was a
22	given and every statement said that.
1	But Wynder’s view of the humane approach
2	was what about people, you know, who are electing
3	to continue to smoke? Was there a way to — was
4	there a way to — again, using his term "managerial
5	approach" was there a way to lessen the risk by
6	producing a less hazardous cigarette?
7	I mean Wynder — I don’t want to —
8	Wynder's papers also — he was a very, very much a
9	public figure here, and he wrote lots of chapters.
10	1 mean he was all for cessation devices. Everyone
11	was. The less hazardous cigarette was in no way to
12	take the place of smoking cessation. No one
13	advocated that that I am aware of.
14	Q So in terms of the message of the public
15	health community, where along the continuum would
16	be the emphasis on low tar and low-yield
17	cigarettes? Would the primary message be stop and
18	don't —
19	MR. NARKO: Objection.
20	BY MS. KURTIN:
21	Q — start?
22	A Always.
1	Q Stop and don’t start?
2	A I’m sorry, yes.
3	Q So the next level, would that be smoking
4	cessation or low tar, low-yield products?
5	A Well, that's stopping is cessation so
6	that would be —
7	Q So stop would be smoking cessation;
8	don’t start, we're going to educate you —
9	A Would be the primary prevention of it, I
10	know that, and then those are the headlines and
11	then beneath that, would be for those people who
12	elected to keep smoking, a low smoke — low tar.
13	Q When you talk about the eight to nine
14	years the Tobacco Working Group was in operation or
15	meeting, do you know what their budget was during
16	that time frame?
17	A I can't recall as I sit here. Certainly
18	in the materials I reviewed there are budgetary
19	figures.
20	Q And you referred to testimony, when
21	Congress — it was Congress that mandated the
22	1981 — the review of the issue that led to the
1	1981 Surgeon General’s report?
2	MR. NARKO: Objection.
3	THE WITNESS: I am not sure it
4	was a mandate. I think they recommend — they
5	asked. I don't know whether it was a vote of
6	Congress. I think it was sort of the consensus of
7	the committee, as I recall.
8	BY MS. KURTIN:
9	Q And you said — you said Dr. Gori
10	testified?
11	A Yes.
12	Q Did — was Gio Gori — did he have a
13	PhD, was he a Dr. Gori or was he —
14	A Yes, he was Dr. Gori, and I can’t
15	remember whether he was a — he may be an MD.
16	Q And do you know what — did Gio Gori
17	continue to remain employed by the government,
18	after his reassignment, following the disbandment
19	of the Tobacco Working Group?
20	A It's been a while since I reviewed his
21	career course.
22	My understanding was he worked for about
1	another year for the National Cancer Institute.
2	Then he took a sabbatical at Johns Hopkins, and
3	then I believe he returned to the National Cancer
4	Institute, at somewhat of a lesser position,
5	working with areas of nutrition and cancer.
6	Q And did he ever leave federal government
7	employ -- employment?
8	A I believe he did, but I can't remember
9	at what point.
10	Q At any point did he become a consultant
11	for the tobacco industry?
12	A I don’t know whether he did or not.
13	Q Going back to the 1981 Surgeon General's
14	report, number three states: It is not clear what
15	reductions in risk may occur in the case of
16	diseases other than lung cancer. The evidence in
17	the case of cardiovascular disease is too limited
18	to warrant a conclusion, nor is there enough
19	information on which to base a judgment in the case
20	of chronic obstructive lung disease.
21	We talked a little bit about the Tobacco
22	Working Group's efforts on varying cigarettes or
1	mostly in the field of the tar, and that's
2	primarily associated with the diseases — lung
3	cancer; correct?
4	A Correct.
5	Q Was there an understanding about what
6	the health effects were for other diseases, by the
7	time of the 1981 Surgeon General’s report came out,
8	how effective these new products were for those
9	others — for the other diseases?
10	A Well, the major study that had been —
11	that came out in 1976 was the result of the Cancer
12	Prevention Study 1, CPS-1 of the American Cancer
13	Society.
14	It was published in 1976, and this was
15	one of the studies that got the public health
16	community very excited, because it showed that
17	there was a — with lower yield cigarettes, that
18	there was a reduction in overall mortality, and
19	reduction in the lung cancer rate, and a reduction
20	in cardiovascular disease, all three.
21	Now, I think the Surgeon General’s
22	report is fair here, saying there were other
1	studies that were not as enthusiastic about
2	lowering the disease rate from cardiovascular
3	diseases, as the original CPS-1 was, and I think
4	that’s probably why they are saying it's mixed
5	here, but certainly in CPS-1, which, of course, was
6	an unprecedented study of a million people, which
7	is a huge study, is there was indication that
8	there — that cardiovascular disease rate was
9	somewhat lessened among smokers of low-yield
10	cigarettes.
11	Q When the 1976 study was undertaken, was
12	it undertaken specifically to study the health
13	effects of low-yield cigarettes; was that its
14	primary question?
15	A First of all, it wasn’t just in 1976.
16	It was a 12-year study that began 1959 and
17	continued up through the early 1970s.
18	And it had — dealt with — I mean I
19	think it had a number of hypotheses it began with,
20	but one of the things that it — one of the
21	components was to study the effects of low-yield
22	cigarettes. Low yield as defined in the period of
1	the study. Of course, a low-yield cigarette in
2	1959 to 1970 became sort of a — a moderate to high
3	yield sort of on the end of the study, just because
4	cigarettes were changing so rapidly during the
5	process of that 12-year study.
6	Q So was it possible then to take the
7	findings of that study and meaningfully interpret
8	them for an assessment of the new products
9	available on the market by the time you got into
10	the '80s?
11	MR. NARKO: Objection.
12	THE WITNESS: Well, they - in
13	fact, they addressed that issue, but they addressed
14	it in, I think, an enthusiastic way, was that we
15	were basing these benefits on cigarettes, which you
16	know are now considered high yield, and cigarettes
17	are becoming even lower yield, that perhaps the
18	benefits in the future might even be better.
19	BY MS. KURTIN:
20	Q You mentioned other studies, though,
21	that weren't as enthusiastic. Would you
22	classify — strike that.
1	On Friday we talked about a raging
2	debate, and moving into what the 1964 — a
3	consensus on the issue of smoking and lung cancer.
4	By the time you get to 1981, the Surgeon General is
5	not as enthusiastic in this report on the benefits
6	for heart disease.
7	Where would you say the state of the
8	scientific and medical community was, with respect
9	to opinions on lower tar and lower nicotine
10	cigarettes and heart disease?
11	MR. NARKO: Objection.
12	THE WITNESS: In 1981? Well, as
13	I mentioned, CPS-1 would indicate that there was
14	some benefit. There were other long-standing
15	programs in cardiovascular disease, particularly
16	the Framingham study, coming out of Massachusetts,
17	which was — which were beginning to publish
18	reports that smoking low-yield cigarettes might not
19	have an effect in those studies. But I think in
20	1981, I think this is a -- is a fair assessment
21	that there were — that it was a mixed — it was a
22	mixed set of conclusions.
1	BY MS. KURTIN:
2	Q In the present day, 2002, is there a
3	current state of opinion — what is the current
4	state of opinion on the health effects of low tar
5	and low nicotine cigarettes on diseases other than
6	lung cancer?
7	A I'm not sure. I don't think I could
8	answer that question. I mean I think all
9	cigarettes are thought to be — to be harmful for
10	cardiovascular.
11	I am not sure I know the answer of
12	whether a very low-yield cigarette is better or
13	worse for heart disease.
14	Q In 1981, you said that this was a fair
15	assessment, that there were still outstanding
16	issues. I guess my question is, is -- is there
17	still a current debate about how effective the use
18	of low tar and low nicotine products are with
19	respect to diseases, such as heart disease?
20	MR. NARKO: Objection.
21	THE WITNESS: I’m not sure I can
22	answer that question.
1	BY MS. KURTIN:
2	Q Going back to number three, the 1981
3	Surgeon General's report also states: In the case
4	of smoking effects on the fetus and newborn, there
5	is no evidence that changing to a lower tar and
6	nicotine cigarette has any effect at all on
7	reducing risk.
8	Is that statement an accurate reflection
9	to your opinion on the state of evidence or the
10	state of medical — scientific and medical opinion
11	in 1981?
12	A I haven’t read all the studies that
13	dealt with smoking regular versus low tar
14	cigarettes on the fetus, so I can't say whether
15	that's fair.
16	I mean certainly I think that’s what the
17	pub he health community recommendation is, and so I
18	have no reason to doubt it. I just haven't read
19	the background papers on it.
20	Q So you are not aware of any controversy
21	or debate over —
22	MR. NARKO: Objection.
1	THE WITNESS: I am not aware of
2	a controversy, but that doesn’t mean there wasn't
3	one. I’m sure there was debate. It is a very
4	difficult research to do on fetuses, and so I would
5	imagine there might be a controversy, but I don't
6	know.
7	BY MS. KURTIN:
8	Q Okay. Going down to number seven: A
9	final question is unresolved, whether the new
10	cigarettes being produced today introduce new risks
11	through their design, filtering mechanisms, tobacco
12	ingredients or additives. The chief concern is
13	additives. The Public Health Service has been
14	unable to assess the relative risk of cigarette
15	additives, because information was not available
16	from manufacturers as to what these additives are.
17	In a — in the big picture of assessing
18	the potential benefits of using low tar, low
19	nicotine cigarettes, in your opinion, how important
20	is the question of additives?
21	MR. NARKO: Objection.
22	THE WITNESS: Well, this will
1	take a moment to at least explain, from my point of
2	view.
3	MS. KURTIN: Sure.
4	THE WITNESS: If that's okay.
5	The Tobacco Working Group was very
6	concerned with the issue of additives in this way,
7	and that is, tar and nicotine levels decreased,
8	smoker acceptability also decreased, and the reason
9	smokers gave for that was issues of flavor.
10	And so, the Tobacco Working Group
11	understood that things would have to be added to
12	cigarettes in order to give a flavor that a smoker
13	would be — would find acceptable, and a whole
14	variety of things were added. Things hke licorice
15	and chocolate and coffee and all -- and other
16	substances.
17	In response to this concern of the 1981
18	Surgeon General’s report, my understanding is that
19	the government did request of the tobacco industry
20	that a list of additive ingredients be produced.
21	And I beheve that list was submitted in the
22	mid— starting in the mid-1980s.
1	The analysis of those, the list, is — I
2	think it's a long list. I think there's--1 think
3	there are 500 or maybe almost 600 items that have
4	been added to — not all in one cigarette. My
5	understanding, and again this gets me — you know,
6	I'm not — I don't really know much about the
7	manufacture, but my understanding is there is only
8	a handful that might be added to any given
9	cigarette — is that this list is virtually —
10	almost every item on the list comes from the
11	so-called GRAS list, and that is an acronym for
12	generally recognized as safe, and these are all
13	common elements that have been used in food and
14	other products in the past. And that this list has
15	been submitted, I believe it is on an annual basis,
16	since the mid-1980s.
17	BY MS. KURTIN:
18	Q Have you yourself ever seen the list?
19	A The list was analyzed a couple of times,
20	and I’ve — I think the man who did it did, Doeur,
21	D-O-E-U-R, I may be wrong about the spelling of
22	that.
1	I think there have been two analyses of
2	this in the '90s, and I have seen the list and also
3	the representation that these are all on the
4	generally recognized as safe.
5	Q And who made the representation that
6	these were all on the list?
7	A The author of that document.
8	Q Who is the author of that document?
9	A I don't know who — as I say, I'm
10	dredging from memory here, and I can’t be more
11	specific than that.
12	Q Do you know if a document was prepared
13	by an employee of the federal government or an
14	employee of the tobacco industry?
15	A I believe he was an employee of the
16	tobacco industry, but I am not 100 percent sure of
17	that.
18	Q Do you know if the list was — sorry,
19	publicly available — was publicly available; that
20	is, could the public access the list?
21	A I don’t know.
22	Q Do you know if the tobacco manufacturers
1	were forthcoming with the list, or did they
2	voluntary turn over the list, or were they hesitant
3	about turning over the list?
4	MR. NARKO: Objection.
5	THE WITNESS: I don't know.
6	BY MS. KURTIN:
7	Q And when you talked about the list, you
8	said it’s not every additive is in every cigarette?
9	A That's my understanding. Again, I—
10	again in looking at these — when I did some
11	research on additives, my understanding is that in
12	any given cigarette there are a handful, but I
13	don't —
14	Q Would it make a difference — you have a
15	composite list. We will just pick a number, I
16	don't know if it's 500, but a given cigarette only
17	uses 50, would it matter in the analysis of those
18	additives how they interact, if you know which 50
19	are being used for a given product, versus the
20	potential all the different variables of 500?
21	MR. NARKO: Objection.
22	THE WITNESS: My understanding
1	is that, you know, if you mix items from the list
2	of the generally recognized as safe together, you
3	end up with something that is safe, but that —
4	beyond that, I really can't — can’t go.
5	BY MS. KURTIN:
6	Q In general, with diseases associated
7	with smoking, is lung cancer more prevalent or is
8	it heart disease that's more prevalent overall?
9	Looking at all the diseases associated
10	with smoking, what would the chief cause of
11	disease — the chief type of disease be associated
12	with smoking?
13	A Well, I think the proportion has changed
14	over time. It was probably — it has probably —
15	heart disease has probably always been numerically
16	superior, but there has been a tremendous — one of
17	the real success stories in the twentieth century
18	has been a decline in myocardial disease and so —
19	but I probably think it is probably the case that
20	heart disease has probably been — has been
21	attributed to cigarette smoking in greater numbers.
22	Q Than lung cancer?
1	A Mm-hmm.
2	Q So again, going to conclusions, based
3	upon the evaluation of the low tar, low nicotine
4	products, primarily associated with the decrease in
5	lung cancer, when you look at the big picture, if
6	there are greater numbers of heart disease
7	associated with smoking, I guess how does that fit
8	in with the big picture, if greater number — if
9	heart disease is the primary disease, and if low
10	tar, low nicotine products have been found to —
11	are attributed with lower numbers for lung cancer,
12	isn't — aren’t we missing the bigger picture of
13	heart disease?
14	MR. NARKO: Objection.
15	THE WITNESS: Well, the clearer
16	picture is with lung cancer, or at least the pub he
17	health community thought.
18	With the concern about heart disease, it
19	was always mixed, and so people who are trying to
20	make this assessment, not only in the Surgeon
21	General's report in '81, but later in the '80s and
22	'90s, there were still — there were still mixed
1	numbers there. And so another way of looking at it
2	is if there are a great of number of people with
3	heart disease that you are concerned about, even a
4	lesser percentage of disease risk would still end
5	up with perhaps a bigger number than the lung
6	cancer group. I mean I don't know — it gets —
7	but the point was that — the long-term hope was
8	that perhaps low-yield cigarettes might be
9	beneficial from the point of view of heart disease
10	as well.
11	BY MS. KURTIN:
12	Q But this is all going back to Wynder's
13	managerial approach —
14	MR. NARKO: Objection.
15	BY MS. KURTIN:
16	Q — to public health, that there is no
17	safe level of smoking?
18	A Right.
19	MR. NARKO: Objection.
20	THE WITNESS: I’m sorry.
21	Yes, the issue, the public health
22	community was very clear, stop, don't start, no
1	safe level, but for that group of people who were
2	going to continue to smoke, the idea would be to
3	produce a cigarette that would be — that might be
4	safer.
5	BY MS. KURTIN:
6	Q You state in your report: Promising
7	leads uncovered during the TWG's productive years
8	shaped many of the developments in low-yield
9	cigarette manufacture that continued for decades
10	after the NCI group was dissolved.
11	What other leads uncovered by the
12	Tobacco Working Group have appeared in — or that
13	continued for decades?
14	A I cite there a very good article by
15	Dietrich Hoffmann, who was very much involved in
16	the whole issue of smoking and health for 40
17	some-odd years, for specifically there, but just to
18	give you an idea, I went through a few of these an
19	hour or so ago, but the idea of using ventilated
20	filters, porous paper, reconstituted tobacco sheet
21	technology, using other parts of the tobacco plant,
22	genetically using -- genetically selected types of
1	tobacco, sort of the puff tobacco technologies.
2	These are all ones that Hoffmann listed that had
3	continued to be used in the making of cigarettes.
4	And he actually cites in his article the Tobacco
5	Working Group.
6	Q And the use of these techniques were
7	then utilized by the cigarette manufacturers in
8	designing these new products?
9	A I can't tell you exactly how that went,
10	but the technologies themselves were used. How
11	they continued to be developed, I can’t — I can't
12	state.
13	MS.KURTIN: Going to that
14	Hoffmann article --
15	(English Exhibit No. 20 - "The Changing
16	Cigarette, 1950-1995" by Dietrich Hoffmann
17	and Ilse Hoffmann - was marked for
18	identification.)
19	BY MS. KURTIN:
20	Q I have a question. On Page 319,
21	Hoffmann has an observation, the smoker of
22	cigarettes — from 319 carrying over to 320, so
1	it's at the bottom of the page: The smoker of
2	cigarettes with low nicotine yields will usually
3	compensate for the low nicotine dehvery by smoking
4	more intensely. However, in doing so, the consumer
5	of such cigarettes will experience relatively
6	greater exposure of the respiratory tract to
7	nicotine, and also to tar and other toxic and
8	carcinogenic agents.
9	Are you familiar with this observation?
10	Well, I guess let's take it one sentence
11	at a time. The compensation — and I believe we
12	talked a little bit about compensation this
13	morning. He states: Will usually compensate for
14	the low nicotine dehvery by smoking more
15	intensely.
16	Is that a controversial statement?
17	MR. NARKO: Objection.
18	THE WITNESS: Well, it’s
19	certainly — as I mentioned, the public health
20	community was concerned with the issue of
21	compensation. You know, going back a long time
22	before 1997, when this article was written, so I
1	mean, it certainly — the question, one question
2	the pubhc health community had was the degree of
3	compensation.
4	You know, in other words, a cigarette
5	smoker may, might — might compensation but not
6	completely, in the sense that it would not be —
7	inhaling the same amount of tars, even if they were
8	compensating.
9	BY MS. KURTIN:
10	Q I'm sorry. I am a little confused.
11	A In other words, let's say a cigarette
12	had reduced nicotine by 50 percent. A cigarette
13	smoker would be completely compensating if he
14	basically smoked two for one, but what happens if a
15	cigarette smoker smoked one and a half cigarettes
16	to — you know, in response, there would still be a
17	benefit because there would be less — there would
18	be less tar overall smoked.
19	Q Okay.
20	A So that's incomplete compensation, and
21	there was a debate in the public health literature
22	whether compensation — how complete compensation
1	was.
2	Q Okay. And then also we had talked about
3	if the smoker smoked the cigarette to varying
4	lengths, so if a smoker of a low nicotine product
5	smoked that cigarette completely or further down,
6	that would also increase the exposure to —
7	A Right.
8	MR. NARKO: Objection.
9	THE WITNESS: Okay. You need to
10	back up. Compensation is a very difficult — a
11	very difficult problem.
12	There are two forms of compensation,
13	because we are now moving to 1997, as opposed to we
14	talked earlier, when you asked me about this
15	earlier this morning, we were talking about what
16	the public health community knew in 1966.
17	There are two forms of compensation.
18	There is the — one within the cigarette, which is
19	basically smoking an individual cigarette more
20	intensely, which is taking more puffs, deeper
21	puffs, holding puffs longer, crushing the
22	ventilation filter tips. Those are — that's
1	within the cigarette, and that’s the most common
2	form, it turns out, the public health community
3	decided on compensation.
4	There is a second form of compensation
5	and that is actually smoking more cigarettes —
6	BY MS. KURTIN:
7	Q The number --
8	A — or at least the potential of that.
9	Although, you know, whether cigarette smokers, when
10	they move to a low tar cigarette, actually smoke
11	more cigarettes, you know, there is a long history
12	on that question as well.
13	Q Is there a current debate in the
14	scientific and medical community on the resolution
15	of that issue of whether smokers of low nicotine
16	products smoke more — larger numbers of
17	cigarettes?
18	A Yes. It has — there is one, and it has
19	been raised — in part, by monograph — NCI
20	Monograph 13 that came out at the end of 2001.
21	Q And would you classify that as a debate
22	going back to when we talked about the 1964 Surgeon
1	General's report, you had called it a raging debate
2	with people on different sides. For this issue,
3	what would your classification be of this issue?
4	MR. NARKO: Objection.
5	THE WITNESS: I'm not sure-I
6	mean the debate leading up to the 1964 report is
7	a — is a different category. There was just an
8	incredible discussion especially — both within the
9	scientific public health medical communities and
10	also within the public at large.
11	I think that the debate that may emerge
12	from the 2001 NCI-13 is I haven't seen much in the
13	way — in the media, other than the announcement of
14	the report when it came out. In the scientific
15	community, there is some — I haven't really seen
16	much — too much discussion yet about that, so I —
17	it's — I suspect there — I mean I could predict
18	there might be debate in the future, but there
19	isn't in the past.
20	But the point I was specifically
21	alluding to is did do smokers of low-yield
22	cigarettes smoke more cigarettes? Dr. Garfinkel,
1	who was the coauthor of the CPS-1, you know,
2	analyzed CPS-1 data in 1979 and 1980 and determined
3	that smokers of low-yield cigarettes, at least as
4	he analyzed that data, did not smoke appreciably
5	more cigarettes.
6	And that was an opinion that was — that
7	was shared in the Surgeon General's report of 1984,
8	I believe, and also in 1989. The authors of NCI
9	Monograph 13 have reanalyzed the CPS-1 in 19 — in
10	2001, and they think that there may have been -- at
11	least that there is a potential of a confounding
12	variable of smokers smoking more cigarettes, a very
13	small number, but I think that’s probably going to
14	be a controversial component of the NCI-13.
15	But as a historian, I think we have to
16	look at that particular monograph as an interesting
17	twist to this story that — in 2001, and we can't
18	use that to color the way the public health
19	community appreciated CPS-1 when it was published
20	in 1976.
21	BY MS. KURTIN:
22	Q But the — we don't know the end result
1	of what’s going to happen with the publication of
2	Monograph 13 in 2001. That history is still to be
3	written.
4	MR. NARKO: Objection.
5	THE WITNESS: I think that’s
6	fair to say, yes.
7	BY MS. KURTIN:
8	Q In going back to — you mentioned
9	Garfinkel.
10	Was there any difference in Garfinkel —
11	I'm sorry.
12	In Garfinkel’s studies, did he note any
13	difference between smokers starting their base
14	rate, the number of cigarettes they smoked? And I
15	guess my — to clarify my question, did Garfinkel
16	notice any difference between smoking rates of
17	smokers who were two packs a day at the start
18	versus less than a half a pack a day?
19	Were there differences in his
20	conclusion? Was it dependent upon the initial
21	number of cigarettes the smoker smoked?
22	MR. NARKO: Objection.
1	THE WITNESS: I can't remember.
2	BY MS. KURTIN:
3	Q Going back to the two forms of
4	compensation, we talked a little bit just now about
5	the number of cigarettes smoked, but the first form
6	of compensation you mentioned was within the
7	cigarettes, smoking more puffs, deeper.
8	In Hoffmann's article, when he states:
9	However, in doing so, the consumer of such
10	cigarettes will experience relatively greater
11	exposure of the respiratory tract to nicotine and
12	also to tar and other carcinogenic agents.
13	Was there any concern when a smoker —
14	if a smoker of lower nicotine products inhaled
15	deeper, that they would be exposing different parts
16	of the lung to the tar and nicotine and that could
17	have possible consequences?
18	MR. NARKO: Objection.
19	THE WITNESS: That concern, and
20	I am basing this sort of on the public health
21	community, as opposed to reading the individual
22	studies, that's a concern that emerged in the late
1	’90s.
2	BY MS. KURTIN:
3	Q In the late '90s?
4	A Yes.
5	Q And is there a current —
6	A So he is really not saying that here.
7	Q He is not saying that here?
8	A No.
9	Q What does he mean by that statement?
10	A He is just saying greater exposure of
11	the respiratory tract. He is not saying it is a
12	different part of the respiratory tract.
13	Q Okay. But there is a current thought?
14	MR. NARKO: Objection.
15	THE WITNESS: Again, basing it
16	on public health community statements, there is a
17	thought that smokers who inhale very, very deeply,
18	might actually be exposing the periphery of the
19	lung field and smaller airways to tar and nicotine.
20	BY MS. KURTIN:
21	Q Going to Page 355, Hoffmann's article,
22	at the bottom of the page, he states: The public
1	will constantly need to be reminded that the only
2	way to avoid smoking-related diseases is to refrain
3	from tobacco use. For those who cannot or will not
4	stop smoking, a strong social case must be made for
5	pressuring the manufacturers to produce products
6	that have the utmost reduced toxicity.
7	Did the tobacco manufacturers have an
8	obligation to develop products that had the utmost
9	reduced toxicity?
10	MR. NARKO: Objection.
11	THE WITNESS: I can’t answer
12	that directly, but I think that statement right
13	there is: And the pub he needs to be reminded that
14	the only way to avoid is to refrain from tobacco
15	use, and then the next statement is, is part of
16	this, you know, smoke cigarettes of, you know,
17	low-yield cigarettes.
18	BY MS. KURTIN:
19	Q But whose responsibility are the design
20	and introduction of the low-yield products? Is
21	that the public health community’s responsibihty;
22	is that the tobacco industry, the cigarette
1	manufacturer's responsibility?
2	MR. NARKO: Objection.
3	THE WITNESS: You know, that’s
4	hard to assess. I mean that’s one of the reasons I
5	liked the Tobacco Working Group, because I think
6	in — you know, people working collaboratively, at
7	that point.
8	You know, I can’t really decide, as an
9	historian whose — whose — whose responsibility it
10	is. Of course, it is the public health community’s
11	to point the way in that respect.
12	BY MS. KURTIN:
13	Q During the time frame of the Tobacco
14	Working Group, did the tobacco industry pubhcly
15	acknowledge that there were diseases associated
16	with smoking?
17	A In the 1970s?
18	Q You gave the years of the tobacco group
19	'68 to'77.
20	A Mm-hmm. Again, I have not studied
21	tobacco company statements in a systematic fashion,
22	but I do know in a general way, and that is the
1	tobacco industry recognized the — and I am
2	thinking specifically of Philip Morris, because I
3	think I know that a little better — recognized the
4	statistics of associating cigarette smoking with
5	lung cancer later called a risk factor. They —
6	because of issues that we talked about on Friday,
7	the failure of inhalation experiments, and the
8	issue of precisely how -- what the mechanism was
9	for a carcinogen — a cell into a cancerous cell, a
10	normal cell into a cancerous cell, they didn't
11	think that from a scientific point of view that
12	causation had been proved, but they thought that
13	cigarette smoking was only a risk factor for those
14	diseases.
15	Q What time frame are you talking about
16	when you talk about Philip Morris acknowledging it
17	was a risk factor?
18	A The statistics — I can't put a precise
19	date on that. I know you asked me the question
20	specifically in the time frame of Tobacco Working
21	Group, but I'm sorry, I can't give you a precise
22	date on that.
1	Q But by 1964, we talked at great length
2	on Friday that it was generally accepted in the
3	scientific and medical community that the causation
4	had been sufficiently proven, and that there was no
5	longer a debate?
6	MR. NARKO: Objection.
7	THE WITNESS: Well, certainly
8	the public health community made that
9	determination. I think we also pointed out that
10	there was — there's been lots of science since
11	then of — about that, but, yes, from the public
12	health community, from 1964 on, has said
13	unwaveringly that cigarette smoking is a cause of
14	lung cancer.
15	BY MS. KURTIN:
16	Q In addition to the public health
17	community, we talked about, I think it was three
18	different communities; the public health community,
19	the scientific community, and the medical
20	community. After the 1964 Surgeon General’s
21	report, was there any debate left in the scientific
22	community on the establishment of causation?
1	A Well, again —
2	MR. NARKO: Objection.
3	THE WITNESS: That gets
4	complicated here, and, again, I think there is a
5	public health message there, and then there is a
6	scientific message.
7	I mean the issue of inhalation, for
8	example, the Tobacco Working Group worked very hard
9	to try to find an inhalation model, and they were
10	not able to do that. And so in that line of
11	experiments, it was a failed line of experiments,
12	but I still think — I’m pretty sure that every
13	member of the Tobacco — I can’t say that. I would
14	say most members of the Tobacco Working Group were
15	on record as believing that cigarette smoking was a
16	harmful event, but there were lots of scientific
17	questions that remained unanswered. But that
18	doesn’t mean that a scientist couldn't accept the
19	public health message.
20	In other words, knowing that the precise
21	mechanism wasn't there, knowing that inhalation
22	experiments hadn't worked, for example, I think
1	that many scientists, vast majority of scientists,
2	would say that cigarette smoking was the cause of
3	lung cancer.
4	BY MS. KURTIN:
5	Q You are saying that many scientists
6	would say?
7	A Would say. Right.
8	Q And when you just said the members of
9	the Tobacco Working Group all believed that smoking
10	was a harmful event —
11	A As I was saying that, I was thinking
12	could I go down the list and actually pull out a
13	publication. I am not sure they all were on the
14	record, so I think — I can’t say that.
15	Q Do you know if the Tobacco Working Group
16	started from a premise, with the belief that
17	smoking caused lung cancer, and then conducted
18	their experiments based upon that starting premise?
19	A You know, I think that’s — I think
20	that's probably fair to say, even though I can’t be
21	able to necessarily find individual statements on
22	all of them. Yes, I think that’s a fair statement.
1	Q And the Tobacco Working Group did
2	include members of the cigarette industry?
3	A It did.
4	Q And my question earlier was, during this
5	time frame, 1968 to 1977, what was the tobacco
6	industry's position, with respect to smoking and
7	disease, during the time of their collaboration on
8	the Tobacco Working Group?
9	MR. NARKO: Objection.
10	THE WITNESS: And that’s the
11	answer I gave to their -- and —
12	BY MS. KURTIN:
13	Q You noted that Philip Morris had
14	acknowledged risk factors?
15	A Had acknowledged the statistics, later
16	calling it a risk factor, but on issues of
17	causation, that they did not think it had been met.
18	MS. KURTIN: Like to take a
19	break?
20	MS.MOLTZEN: It is probably a
21	good time to take lunch. It is 12:15.
22	MS. KURTIN: Go off the record.
1	VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the
2	record at 12:14:15.
3	(Thereupon, at this point in the proceedings
4	a luncheon recess was taken.)
5	VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the
6	record at 1:22:54.
7	BY MS. KURTIN:
8	Q Good afternoon, Dr. English.
9	A Good afternoon.
10	Q I would like to go back to Page 12 of
11	your expert report. In the first full paragraph,
12	the last sentence, you state that: The public
13	health community was confident that a less
14	hazardous cigarette, filtered and lower in tar and
15	nicotine yields, would provide a greater benefit to
16	cigarette smokers.
17	When you used the term "confident,"
18	first of all, I just want to confirm, what time
19	frame are you talking about?
20	A I think the public health community was
21	confident probably from around 1966 on, but that
22	the confidence soared with the publication of CPS-1
1	in 1976.
2	Q Is that confidence level still
3	soaring — well, I don't want to put words in your
4	mouth.
5	What would you consider the confidence
6	level in the present day, 2002?
7	A 2002?
8	MR. NARKO: Objection.
9	THE WITNESS: I mean the public
10	health message throughout the period has been stop
11	and don’t start, but we are talking about here the
12	low — the less hazardous cigarette.
13	Certainly the American Cancer Society,
14	through the end of the '80s and into the '90s, was
15	actually explicitly recommending low tar and low
16	nicotine cigarettes for smokers who didn’t want to
17	quit.
18	And I think the message was actually
19	implicit throughout the '90s, but, in the end of
20	the 1990s, there began to be voiced in the public
21	health community concerns that lower tar cigarettes
22	might not be safer, or let me just backtrack a
1	little bit there.
2	Was — I think it’s a httle different.
3	That perhaps the evidence wasn't sufficient to make
4	a public health recommendation that -- that --
5	that — that low tar cigarettes were — had — were
6	safer.
7	And I think that emerged at the end of
8	the 1990s, and, I think, would crystallize with the
9	publication of NCI-1.
10	BY MS. KURTIN:
11	Q And that was at the end of 2001 ?
12	A End of 2001.
13	Q The next paragraph of your report
14	begins: In promoting low-yield cigarettes, the
15	pub he health community, including the federal
16	government, was aware that the benefits of smoking
17	low-yield cigarettes might be offset if the smoker
18	smoked more cigarettes each day, or smoked the same
19	number of cigarettes more intensely. And your
20	sentence continues, but my question really has to
21	do with the first part of that sentence: In
22	promoting low-yield cigarettes.
1	Did the federal government actually ever
2	promote low-yield cigarettes?
3	A I think so. Not — again, always after
4	the basic message, but I think the "If you must
5	smoke" campaign, beginning in 1968, five ways to
6	cut down, one of the recommendations were for
7	smokers to smoke low-yield cigarettes. But it is
8	not just in that one particular pamphlet, which I
9	under — which had really a wide distribution.
10	I think I found five or six different
11	pamphlets designed for public health clinics,
12	doctors' offices, all government, recommending
13	low-yield cigarettes. The Technical Report, for
14	example, that the arm of the federal government is
15	talking about low-yield cigarettes. You know,
16	again, we talked about Surgeon General report 1981,
17	even with all the provisos and concerns, some newly
18	raised, some old, that we're still saying for
19	people who refuse to quit, that low tar cigarettes
20	was — was — the way to go.
21	Q So the — any promotion you might
22	attribute to the federal government was all with
1	the caveat that stop, don't start —
2	A Yes. You know, there is a great poster,
3	you know, I don't have a picture of it here, but,
4	you know, cigarettes go from bad to worse, and it
5	was a 1974, Department of HEW, and it had the
6	picture there, all these cigarette butts falling
7	out of ashtrays and the whole Gestalt of the thing
8	is it is just gross. You have all these pictures
9	there, and on the bottom is the federal
10	government's measurement of tar and nicotine, and
11	the caption is, cigarettes can have as much as
12	34 milligrams of tar or as low as 1 milligram of
13	tar, you know, it goes from bad to worse.
14	And I mean again that’s — in essence,
15	capturing the fact that they are all bad, but some
16	are worse than -- than — than others.
17	Q And there was never a time that the
18	federal government advocated that low-yield
19	cigarettes were safe?
20	A No.
21	Q Is that correct?
22	A In fact, I’ve --1 have not come across
1	any public health literature that would indicate
2	that the public health community or the federal
3	government thought that low-yield cigarettes were
4	safe.
5	Q Dr. English, in this paragraph, and this
6	may be a construction of your report question, but
7	you’re talking about smokers smoking the number of
8	cigarettes, or smoking more intensely, and then you
9	state: This concern about individual smoking
10	habits in response to cigarette modification became
11	known as compensation. And we've talked about
12	compensation today.
13	And then you cite to--you say: For
14	example, Ernst — and it’s Wynder or Wynder?
15	A Wynder.
16	Q You say it is 1957 paper, a study of
17	tobacco carcinogens, three filtered cigarettes.
18	Does Wynder talk about compensation in
19	this 1957 report?
20	A I don’t believe he uses the word
21	"compensation." But the idea of a reduction to
22	such a level will be followed by a significant
1	reduction in cancer, provided the number of
2	cigarettes smoked is held constant. That’s a
3	concern for what became known as compensation.
4	And then, later on, the length of which
5	a cigarette is smoked is an important factor.
6	Again, is a — is a term -- I mean is a concern for
7	what later became known as compensation.
8	As I mentioned this morning, I am not
9	precisely sure when the word "compensation" was
10	first used in this respect.
11	Q But the two types of compensation we’re
12	talking about are reflected, talking about the
13	number of cigarettes and then—
14	A I think so.
15	Q — the length?
16	A Yes.
17	Q On the top of Page 13, you state that:
18	Wynder's remarks were reflected in several articles
19	in the media, including a widely cited one in
20	"Reader’s Digest." In the "Reader’s Digest"
21	article, was the concept of compensation discussed?
22	And I'm — sorry. This is not a memory game, so I
1	would like to show you —
2	(English Exhibit No. 21 - "Reader's Digest"
3	article "Wanted — And Available --
4	Filter-Tips That Really Filter" by Lois
5	Mattox Miller and James Monahan - was marked
6	for identification.)
7	BY MS. KURTIN:
8	Q Dr. English, I am handing you what's
9	been marked as Exhibit 21. It is an article
10	entitled, "Wanted — And Available — Filter-tips
11	That Really Filter," by Lois Mattox Miller and
12	James Monahan.
13	A A couple of things in response to your
14	question.
15	I don’t want you to leave the impression
16	that it was only the "Reader’s Digest" that picked
17	up — what the press picked up was the 40 percent,
18	that if it were possible to reduce cigarette tars
19	by 40 percent, that this might have some kind of
20	health affect. That was what was largely picked
21	up.
22	Q Okay.
1	AY our question has to do with whether the
2	part -- the — the — Wynder's specifically stated
3	concern here about smoking more cigarettes or
4	smoking them more intensely picked up here, and --
5	and I — in the section that deals with Wynder,
6	which is on Page 2, I don’t — I don't see that —
7	that particular concern, going through, and as I
8	sit here, I can't recall whether articles that
9	appeared in other media about the 40 percent
10	reduction included that or not.
11	Q And this is in the time frame of 1957?
12	A This is'57; right.
13	Q At any point after 1957, was -- did the
14	pubhc media report on the issue of compensation?
15	MR. NARKO: Objection.
16	THE WITNESS: It did, and in
17	some ways in a common-sensical point of view, in
18	other words, oftentimes it would be in a phrase
19	something like or more — as long as you don't
20	smoke more cigarettes, or something — something
21	like that.
22	I mean in some ways compensation, in and
1	of itself, is, I think, common — you know,
2	common-sensical is that as you reduce tar and
3	nicotine, that smokers might smoke for the tar and
4	the nicotine.
5	I think it's there in some of the public
6	health messages. It’s — in — becomes more
7	explicit as time goes on.
8	BY MS. KURTIN:
9	Q As time goes on, when would you estimate
10	that the message about compensation became more
11	explicit?
12	A Well, the pub he health community was
13	certainly talking about compensation in the 1972
14	Surgeon General’s report.
15	It’s mentioned in the '19, '81, '84,
16	'89, a number of places, you know.
17	Q And these are examples from the public
18	health community?
19	A Mm-hmm.
20	Q In your view of the public media
21	coverage of the issue, did you encounter
22	discussions of compensation in the public media?
1	A It's in some — in some — in some
2	detail in, I think, things like "The New York
3	Times." It’s — I mean there’s coverage there.
4	It’s — was not — the pub he health community did
5	not make it an overwhelming concern, but it's
6	there.
7	I mean I've seen public service
8	announcements, you know, with vent hole blocking,
9	for example, TV spots, where there was a concern
10	about that. I mean it’s out there. But it—
11	perhaps not to the level that cigarettes are —
12	cause disease, can produce death. I mean the basic
13	message.
14	Q And the public health spot that you
15	mentioned, do you recall if that was a — a spot
16	prepared by a voluntary public health organization
17	or by the federal government?
18	A I can't remember.
19	Q On Page 13, going further, when you
20	discuss the Federal Trade Commission's announcement
21	of its plan to measure tar and nicotine yields —
22	yields in cigarettes in 1967, you quote part of a
1	news release by the FTC, talking about -- it starts
2	out: No two human smokers smoke in the same way.
3	Is the FTC release that you quote here,
4	is that discussing compensation or individual
5	smoker variation?
6	MR. NARKO: Objection.
7	THE WITNESS: I think it's doing
8	both.
9	The — although the word "compensation"
10	does not appear in that. One of the issues, of
11	course, was measuring cigarettes and tar and
12	nicotine as — at varying levels of tar and
13	nicotine.
14	And the issue of how a smoker smokes a
15	certain cigarette, the number of puffs, how long
16	they hold the puff, how long the butt would have to
17	be, how big a puff, these are all issues that are
18	part of the compensation story, and certainly
19	became part of the compensation story over time,
20	especially in the issues of whether the Cambridge
21	Method took into account compensation, and also
22	some modifications in cigarette, especially
1	cigarette filter design. So I think it’s all
2	imphcit there, and I think it is an important part
3	of the story.
4	BY MS. KURTIN:
5	Q But at the beginning of the time that
6	the Federal Trade Commission began measuring tar
7	and nicotine, was the concern that the method
8	didn’t take into account compensation of low-yield
9	products, or was the concern that the FTC method
10	didn't smoke -- didn't measure an accurate
11	reflection of what the smoker took in when they
12	smoked cigarettes?
13	MR. NARKO: Objection.
14	THE WITNESS: I think in some
15	ways both of those is correct.
16	I mean there was a wide recognition that
17	the — that — including from submissions of the
18	tobacco industry, that this particular method was
19	not going to characterize, you know, what a given
20	smoker smoked, or even what an average smoker
21	would — would — would do. Or I think it's
22	implied in this discussion here what a smoker would
1	do, if a smoker were smoking different cigarette
2	products, whether it was going to be a higher or
3	low tar. I mean that wasn't — that wasn’t --1
4	mean I think they — the express of concern that
5	this method was not going to do it.
6	The purpose of the Cambridge Method and
7	the FTC method was a comparison, so they provide
8	smokers with information, so basically saying, you
9	know, these cigarettes smoked in this particular
10	way, this one yields 15 milligrams and that one
11	yields 8, and therefore you can make a difference.
12	And as the FTC stated a few years later, the hope
13	was even that that might even spur competition,
14	there might even be rivalry, for example, who could
15	produce, I think, from the FTC point of view a
16	lower — you know, a cigarette that had a lower FTC
17	yield on it.
18	BY MS. KURTIN:
19	Q But a cigarette that would be measured
20	by the machine as having a lower --
21	A Of course. I mean it's always by the
22	machine. I mean that's something that, you know —
1	Q Taking into consideration that the
2	method couldn’t measure how an individual smoker
3	smoked a cigarette, or as you said, even an average
4	smoker, was there a benefit to having the products
5	rated by the FTC method?
6	MR. NARKO: Objection.
7	THE WITNESS: Well, the public
8	health community thought it saw a benefit. In
9	fact, I think we mentioned — I think we talked
10	about this on Friday.
11	The FTC had explicitly said the tar and
12	nicotine yields were health claims, and from their
13	point of view, an unsubstantiated health claim
14	based on the 1955 set of guidelines, and so in
15	1959/ 60 said to the tobacco industry that
16	basically even printing tar and nicotine yields was
17	a health claim that they forbade.
18	That particular ruling was petitioned by
19	members of the public health community, especially
20	the American Cancer Society. The Surgeon General
21	himself said that he thought it was in the public
22	interest that people know what the tar and nicotine
1	levels of the cigarettes were, so they could make
2	an informed choice.
3	And again, I mean, every — people knew
4	that it wasn't — and the FTC knew it wasn't
5	actually measuring how any given cigarette smoker
6	smoked or an average, but the idea was that it was
7	a comparison, so that smokers could, you know, make
8	an informed choice.
9	BY MS. KURTIN:
10	Q I guess my confusion then is, how can
11	you make an informed choice, if the measurement
12	wasn't accurately reflect what people —
13	MR. NARKO: Objection.
14	THE WITNESS: Well, each of
15	these cigarettes were smoked the same way in the
16	machine, so that's how you could make a comparison.
17	BY MS. KURTIN:
18	Q And then an informed choice, in terms of
19	choosing a product with a different level?
20	MR. NARKO: Objection.
21	THE WITNESS: I think you would
22	have to ask an individual smoker how he or she
1	would make a decision, but I think the public
2	health communities hoped that smokers would choose
3	a lower tar product. But without the message —
4	without the measurement, they wouldn’t know which
5	were the lower tar products.
6	BY MS. KURTIN:
7	Q To go along with the information
8	disclosed by what the FTC method resulted in, would
9	a second component of the message need to be
10	education about compensation, in order to make a
11	fully informed choice?
12	MR. NARKO: Objection.
13	THE WITNESS: The - certainly
14	the public health community didn't make that
15	recommendation. Whether they might have is
16	something I can’t comment on.
17	They never included that as part of a
18	recommendation putting that in FTC measurement, for
19	example.
20	BY MS. KURTIN:
21	Q Then in your next paragraph, when you
22	say, "One measure of this public health thrust was
1	petitioning the Federal Trade Commission," you
2	mentioned the American Cancer Society.
3	Do you know who else petitioned the
4	Federal Trade Commission to reverse its ban on tar
5	and nicotine content?
6	A Yes. There are quite a number. There’s
7	actually a series of letters to the head of the FTC
8	chairman — his name is Dixon — that actually he
9	lists for us on all the people who did it, but it
10	was widely done, the National Interagency Council,
11	which a lot of public health organizations were
12	part of it. It was a widely — I mean — I think
13	it is an expression of the enthusiasm of this
14	particular thrust of the public health community’s
15	campaign was that this was a widely viewed step,
16	viewed positively, so it was — it wasn’t just the
17	American Cancer Society, it was many more, the
18	Surgeon General, as I already pointed out.
19	Q Did members of the tobacco industry
20	petition to have the ban reversed?
21	A I'm not aware if they did or not.
22	Q When we talked this morning about the
1	disbanding of the Tobacco Working Group, was there
2	efforts by the pubhc health community to continue
3	research on less hazardous cigarettes, once the
4	Tobacco Working Group was disbanded, other areas of
5	the pubhc health community?
6	A Yes. And, in fact, one of the best
7	places to see that is in the Banbury Conference
8	that took place in 1979. I think the title of the
9	conference was: A safe cigarette with a question
10	mark. It was a two-day conference, and many
11	members, former members of the Tobacco Working
12	Group, presented papers there.
13	It’s a conference. Cuyler Hammond has a
14	paper and in the very beginning there he said, you
15	know, we all met in 1966 and we came up with this
16	preponderance statement, and he — and he goes on
17	to say, well, what we know now in '79 is even
18	stronger, and so he says, rather than just
19	recommend, we should very strongly recommend.
20	He modified the wording in that to
21	indicate that that was a positive thing to do.
22	And, of course, the science of the benefits of
1	low-yield cigarettes did not stop with CPS-1 in
2	1976.
3	I mean there are many, many
4	epidemiological studies published, both in this
5	country and Britain and in Europe that continued to
6	show, in the '70s, '80s, '90s, of low-yield
7	cigarettes almost always with the case of lung
8	cancer and with heart disease being a somewhat
9	mixed bag of conclusions.
10	Another example was there was the
11	Scarborough Conference, in 1984/'85, you know,
12	review the whole issue of low tar, and they
13	concluded at the end of that conference that there
14	was a — still a public health need for advocating
15	the production of low-yield cigarettes.
16	Q Who participated in the Scarborough
17	Conference?
18	A Well, Dr. Wynder was there.
19	Dr. Kozlowski that we mentioned. I can’t remember
20	whether Dr. Samet was there. Many of the prominent
21	members of the — of people evaluating smoking and
22	health issues from this country, as well as other
1	countries, were there.
2	Q And were there publications resulting
3	from the Scarborough Conference?
4	A Yes, I mean there was a report of the
5	conference that was published in 1985.
6	Q And were the conclusions of that report
7	carried in the press?
8	A I’m not certain about that.
9	Q Going back to the Banbury Conference —
10	A Banbury Conference.
11	Q — Banbury Conference, who had
12	participated in that conference? You had mentioned
13	many former members of the Tobacco Working Group.
14	For instance, who in particular comes to mind?
15	A Virtually everyone on the hst that I
16	gave you here, at least many of these people, list
17	on Page 14, presented papers there.
18	Do you have the Banbury report here?
19	Q No, not with me.
20	A The table of contents would give you —
21	would give you a full list there.
22	Q Did members of the tobacco industry
1	participate in the Banbury Conference?
2	A I think so. But I'm not — I'd — I
3	would have to refresh my recollection on that.
4	Q All right. After the Tobacco Working
5	Group was disbanded, were there other instances of
6	collaboration between the public health community
7	and the tobacco industry, on the issue of low-yield
8	cigarette products?
9	A I'm not aware of any.
10	Q Are you aware of any collaboration
11	between the public health community and the tobacco
12	industry, on general issues of smoking and health?
13	A Well, certainly as the public health
14	community changes recommendation on warnings, I
15	mean those were obviously printed on the pack of
16	all cigarettes.
17	Q Were the warning labels a collaborative
18	effort between the pubhc health community and
19	tobacco industry?
20	MR. NARKO: Objection.
21	THE WITNESS: Congress decided
22	on the wording of the warnings.
1	BY MS. KURTIN:
2	Q And when you mentioned many
3	epidemiological studies in the '70s, '80s, '90s,
4	discussing low-yield cigarettes, and its effects on
5	predominantly lung cancer rates, how many studies
6	would you say were conducted in the '70s?
7	A I think the best place to — place where
8	you can get a listing of those is in Monograph 13,
9	in chapter four there is actually a table that
10	lists the epidemiological studies. And I can't
11	break them down by decade for you, but there is a
12	listing there.
13	Q So do you know relatively were there
14	more in the '70s than in the '80s?
15	A I can't tell you. I would hazard a
16	guess. I would say that there probably--were
17	probably more published in the '80s than in the
18	'70s but, again, I would refer to that list.
19	Q And in reviewing the popular press
20	coverage of such studies, did those studies receive
21	attention in the public media?
22	A Some did.
1	Q And do you have one or two that come to
2	mind as receiving coverage in the pubhc media?
3	A I — I can't, as I sit here, remember
4	which ones received coverage.
5	Q Of the ones that did receive coverage,
6	was it something that was widely covered in the
7	press or was it small mention reporting on the
8	results of a particular study?
9	MR. NARKO: Objection.
10	THE WITNESS: I can’t - I can't
11	comment. I don’t remember.
12	BY MS. KURTIN:
13	Q And discussing these studies that we
14	just mentioned, when you say: These
15	recommendations were based on credible laboratory
16	and epidemiological evidence suggesting that lower
17	yield cigarettes had a reduced risk of disease,
18	these studies that you just mentioned you listed in
19	Monograph 13, these were the credible laboratory
20	and epidemiological evidence?
21	MR. NARKO: Objection.
22	THE WITNESS: The ones I'm
1	referring to are the credible epidemiological
2	evidence. The credible laboratory evidence would
3	come from studies such as Wynder's that was done in
4	the 1950s, and the TWG skin painting studies.
5	BY MS. KURTIN:
6	Q Was there any credible laboratory
7	evidence after the disbanding of the Tobacco
8	Working Group?
9	MR. NARKO: Objection.
10	THE WITNESS: I am sure that
11	there is but I haven’t studied it.
12	BY MS. KURTIN:
13	Q On Page 16 you discuss the CPS-1 study.
14	And my question here, Dr. Enghsh, is your sentence
15	in the second paragraph on Page 16: So when CPS-1
16	concluded that low-yield cigarettes were less
17	likely to cause lung cancer, it took into account
18	this form of compensation. And then you cite to
19	Jonathan M. Samet's chapter, "The Changing
20	Cigarette and Disease Risk: Current State of the
21	Evidence," NCI Monograph, 1996. I would like to
22	show you a copy of Dr. Samet's chapter.
1	(English Exhibit No. 22 - "The Changing
2	Cigarette and Disease Risk: Current Status
3	of the Evidence," by Jonathan M. Samet - was
4	marked for identification.)
5	BY MS. KURTIN:
6	Q Dr. English, I am handing you what's
7	been marked as Exhibit 6, that's chapter six, "The
8	Changing Cigarette and Disease Risk: Current
9	Status of the Evidence."
10	Dr. English, I read through this
11	chapter, and I didn't see Dr. Samet talking about
12	compensation. Could you point me in the direction
13	of how you -- why you cited this reference for that
14	particular sentence of your report?
15	A I would have to find it. Should I take
16	the time to do it now?
17	VIDEOGRAPHER: Can we go - it's
18	up to you. Continue.
19	THE WITNESS: I think one of the
20	things he states, beginning in Paragraph 2: Only
21	epidemiological studies can provide information on
22	my indication of the risk of smoking as the
1	cigarette has evolved, and only epidemiological
2	data can measure the risk of cigarettes under
3	natural circumstances of use. However dynamic, the
4	nature of exposure challenges the epidemiological
5	to class — so I think that's part of it there, his
6	statement that it takes -- no matter how a
7	cigarette is smoked, the natural use, only
8	epidemiological studies can take that into account.
9	BY MS. KURTIN:
10	Q But was he specifically referring to
11	CPS-1, or was that a general statement about
12	epidemiological studies?
13	A That’s — okay, if I understand your
14	question, he was referring to all epidemiological
15	studies.
16	Q So do you know if Dr. Samet specifically
17	analyzed the results of CPS-1 and formed a
18	conclusion about whether CPS-1, in particular, took
19	into account compensation?
20	A Well, he certainly cites it in his
21	bibliography. It is the one, two, three, fourth —
22	fourth item down.
1	Q He cites a number of articles in his
2	bibliography.
3	A He does, but I assume it is in the
4	bibliography, because that's one of articles -- one
5	of the studies he's taking into account.
6	Q And I guess my question is then: Did
7	Dr. Samet specifically reach any conclusions with
8	respect to CPS-1, in this chapter, of Monograph 7?
9	MR. NARKO: Objection.
10	THE WITNESS: I mean-on
11	Page 80, I mean: The ACS's Cancer Prevention Study
12	1 provided early evidence on the risk of lower tar
13	and nicotine cigarettes.
14	I mean he is certainly discussing it.
15	BY MS. KURTIN:
16	Q I agree he is discussing the study.
17	Is he specifically talking about
18	compensation?
19	A Well, not in that particular section. I
20	think he’s been talking about that in the earlier
21	sentences that I quoted to you. You may —you
22	probably realize that Dr. Samet has been deposed on
1	as many times, and I have read a few of his
2	depositions. In reading those — we can defer to
3	those depositions, but he’s of the view that
4	epidemiological studies take this first form of
5	compensation into account.
6	Q Oh, I was just trying to clarify how you
7	reached that conclusion. Do you think that the
8	conclusion in your report is from review of his
9	deposition testimony?
10	MR. NARKO: Objection.
11	THE WITNESS: No. I mean I read
12	this long before I read any of his depositions.
13	I think it’s based on his introductory
14	section, and going on to discuss the various
15	studies that he mentioned in his article.
16	BY MS. KURTIN:
17	Q Did you review Dr. Samet's testimony in
18	this case?
19	A Not yet.
20	Q Do you plan on reviewing Dr. Samet's
21	testimony in this case?
22	A Probably.
1	Q Dr. English, on Page 17 of your report,
2	you state on the second paragraph: Federal, state,
3	and local governments regulated cigarettes and
4	smoking in response to the evidence suggesting a
5	link between smoking and disease.
6	Dr. English, can you tell me what other
7	federal regulation of cigarettes has there been,
8	aside from the specific examples that you referred
9	to for the FTC?
10	A Well, of course, there is the warning
11	labels, which are not part of the Federal Trade
12	Commission. There is smoking in, you know — of
13	federal buildings is another regulation. There is
14	smoking on transportation is another. There —
15	there are quite a few, and, again, I would refer to
16	the 1989 Surgeon General's report, which goes into
17	some detail on that.
18	Q And Dr. English, are you aware of any
19	efforts on behalf of the tobacco industry to resist
20	the regulations that you just described?
21	MR. NARKO: Objection.
22	THE WITNESS: That’s not
1	something I’ve studied.
2	BY MS. KURTIN:
3	Q Did you review any material related to
4	the FDA's proposed regulation of tobacco products?
5	A I have reviewed some, yes.
6	Q What type of material did you review?
7	A There was — when the FDA proposed in
8	them — I assume you are talking about in the
9	mid-'90s —
10	Q Yes, I'm sorry, in the mid-’90s.
11	A — when the FDA proposed regulating
12	cigarettes as a drug? I did read a number of
13	things, both in the popular media and the public
14	health media, to that effect.
15	Q Did you come to any conclusions about
16	the FDA’s proposed regulation of tobacco products?
17	A Well, in what respect? I mean it was
18	certainly widely discussed. I believe there were a
19	number of court cases that came out of this, and I
20	followed the news story, and I believe the Supreme
21	Court eventually decided that the Federal Trade —
22	I mean the Food and Drug Administration did not
1	have jurisdiction over tobacco products. I mean
2	that’s —
3	Q The part of the FDA's proposed
4	legislation or proposed regulation of tobacco
5	products was finding that tobacco products were a
6	drug.
7	Did you come to any opinions with
8	respect to the classification of tobacco products
9	as a drug?
10	MR. NARKO: Objection.
11	THE WITNESS: No, no, I don't.
12	BY MS. KURTIN:
13	Q Were you — are you — excuse me, strike
14	that.
15	Are you aware of any efforts by the
16	tobacco industry to fight the FDA’s proposed
17	regulation of tobacco products?
18	MR. NARKO: Objection.
19	THE WITNESS: Well, I assume
20	that they were a party to the suit that went up to
21	the Supreme Court, but that’s all I can say.
22	BY MS. KURTIN:
1	Q What are some examples of state and
2	local governments regulating tobacco?
3	A There are quite a few. For example,
4	what's going to be taught in schools, that's a
5	state regulation, dealing with education. The
6	ability to — or the restrictions on smoking in
7	state and local buildings. Ordinances and local
8	community ordinances of whether you can smoke in
9	restaurants, in bars, in public buildings. Those
10	are the things I'm thinking of.
11	Q And are you aware of any efforts on
12	behalf of the tobacco industry to prevent such
13	proposed legislation on the state and local level?
14	MR. NARKO: Objection.
15	THE WITNESS: That’s not
16	something I studied.
17	MS.MOLTZEN: I would like to
18	take a break.
19	VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the
20	record at 2:05:45.
21	(Thereupon, a recess was taken.)
22	VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the
1	record at 2:13 and 10 seconds.
2	BY MS. KURTIN:
3	Q Dr. English, on Page 17, you say that:
4	For example, the FTC Commission — FTC actively
5	regulated cigarette advertising.
6	When you say "actively regulated," are
7	you comparing this to regulation of other
8	industries' advertising?
9	A No.
10	Q And how do you reach the conclusion or
11	what do you mean by "actively regulated"?
12	A Well, I have read the annual reports of
13	the FTC and that’s certainly something that is —
14	that was covered regularly in their annual reports,
15	and I have also kept a media file on FTC regulation
16	and that’s — was one of the most closely followed,
17	of — aspects of the smoking and health problem is
18	the FTC regulation of ads, and so that’s what I
19	based — primarily those two is what I base it on.
20	Q And have you reviewed any FTC documents?
21	A Well, their annual reports are FTC
22	documents.
1	Q I'm sorry, any other FTC documents
2	besides the annual reports?
3	A I have also looked at some of the
4	subsequent guidelines on tobacco advertising, and I
5	can't remember whether it was actually part of the
6	annual reports or issued separately from them, but
7	I have looked at some of those subsequent reports.
8	Q And have you reviewed any documents that
9	have been produced in this litigation, pertaining
10	to the FTC regulation of tobacco products?
11	A Not yet.
12	Q Do you intend to review?
13	A I suspect to.
14	Q When you state that: In 1971 the FTC
15	required that these yields — and I believe you are
16	referring to the tar and nicotine yields — be
17	included in all printed advertisements, were
18	cigarette manufacturers required to print tar and
19	nicotine yields on the packages of their products?
20	A No. They were not.
21	Q Are they currently required to advertise
22	the tar and nicotine yields on their products?
1	A I don’t believe so.
2	Q Dr. English, I believe we've discussed a
3	little bit today the alleged weaknesses of the
4	Cambridge Method.
5	But could you explain in a little
6	further detail what the perception is about the
7	Cambridge Method?
8	MR. NARKO: Objection.
9	THE WITNESS: In which time
10	period?
11	BY MS. KURTIN:
12	Q Let’s start in 1967.
13	A We've already talked about that, and
14	that's, I think, in the examples I cite in the
15	expert report here, that the Cambridge Method was
16	recognized not to really capture what any
17	individual smoker or even how an average smoker
18	smoked.
19	Q And have there been changing concerns
20	about the Cambridge Method?
21	A Yes. The — on a number of occasions,
22	there have been concerns about the Cambridge
1	Method, in some respects, dealing with the issue of
2	compensation, given methods about how the machine
3	actually works, especially in regards to
4	compensation. And on each occasion where the FTC
5	has revisited the Cambridge Method, in the end, it
6	has decided to keep the Cambridge Method, as it
7	still does today, based on the same understanding
8	that it had in 1967, and that is that cigarettes
9	are all smoked by the machine in the same way, and
10	so therefore smokers can use it as a comparative
11	method.
12	There is — and I think I cite an
13	article, if I -- if I didn't, by Peeler in the same
14	NCI-7 that Dr. Samet’s article — Peeler is an FTC
15	employee who has — who very nicely reviews this
16	whole issue.
17	Q Dr. English, do you have an opinion on
18	the effectiveness of the Cambridge Method, for the
19	pub he’s — strike that.
20	Do you have a personal opinion on the
21	effectiveness of the Cambridge Method?
22	MR. NARKO: Objection.
1	THE WITNESS: I do not.
2	BY MS. KURTIN:
3	Q Dr. English, just to confirm, you
4	described on Friday and today that you did review
5	additional documents, from the time that this
6	report was prepared, to the beginning of your
7	deposition on Friday; is that correct?
8	A That is correct.
9	MS.KURTIN: And those documents
10	were not provided to the United States prior to
11	Dr. English's deposition. We have put a request on
12	the record that those documents be provided, and we
13	will follow that up with a letter requesting that.
14	BY MS. KURTIN:
15	Q Also, Dr. English, I just want to
16	confirm that you gave deposition in the Bullet case
17	prior to this deposition?
18	A Yes.
19	MS. KURTIN: And that deposition
20	testimony was not provided to the United States
21	before this deposition. The United States would
22	just like to reserve its rights to recall
1	Dr. English as a witness once those materials are
2	provided. I would hke to go off the record.
3	VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the
4	record at 2:20:22.
5	(Discussion held off the record.)
6	VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the
7	record at 2:21:45.
8	MS. KURTIN: The parties have
9	just agreed that the United States has used three
10	hours and 35 minutes of today's deposition of
11	Dr. Peter English, and the United States has no
12	further questions at this time.
13	MR. NARKO: We have no
14	questions.
15	VIDEOGRAPHER: This deposition
16	concluded. The time off the record, 2:22 and 10
17	seconds. This is the end of tape number two.
18	(Thereupon, at 2:22 p.m. the deposition was
19	concluded.)
20	(The witness reserved signature.)
