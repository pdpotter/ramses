1	LOUIS KYRIAKOUDES, Ph.D.,
2	the witness herein, continued:
3	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. Let's go back the record.
4	CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I handed you Plaintiffs
7	Exhibit 1583, which was a composite exhibit of
8	newsletters from the Tobacco Institute. Can you tell us
9	what the purpose of those newsletters was?
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: The purpose of Tobacco and
12	Health was to disseminate to doctors, political
13	leaders, congressmen, other parties that the
14	Tobacco Institute was interested in opinion shaping
15	what their side of the story was on smoking and
16	health, namely that the -- that cigarettes were not
17	the cause of disease.
18	BY MR. ACOSTA:
19	Q. Let me ask it a different way. What kind of
20	information was contained in the Tobacco Institute's
21	newsletter?
22	A. Summaries of research reports, reprints of
23	newspaper stories, and items like that, all indicating
24	that cigarettes were not the cause of serious disease or
25	identifying other causes for the serious diseases that
0113
1	were associated with cigarettes.
2	Q. And were they sent to anyone in particular?
3	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: Yeah, Tobacco and Health was
5	disseminated widely. It was sent to medical
6	doctors, political leaders, congressmen and other
7	interested parties like that.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. I want to show you another -- before we leave
10	the 1950s, I want to show you another set of
11	advertisements. And I'm going to mark these as
12	Plaintiffs Exhibit Number 50.
13	(Plaintiffs Exhibit 50, Advertisements, was
14	identified.)
15	MR. GERAGHTY: You are marking them as number
16	50?
17	MR. ACOSTA: Yeah.
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Is there any method to the
19	numbering system?
20	MR. ACOSTA: No.
21	BY MR. ACOSTA:
22	Q. Would you look at Plaintiffs Exhibit Number
23	50 and look through those and identify them for us?
24	While you are doing that, we'll go off the
25	record for a second.
0114
1	(A discussion off the record.)
2	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. Back on the record.
3	MR. GERAGHTY: Just for the record, to the
4	extent that it's not clear to me from looking at
5	the document, so I can't tell you I know for sure,
6	but to the extent that any of the materials within
7	this voluminous set that you have marked as Exhibit
8	60 were not part of the Amitz or Hall sets, we
9	would object to their use.
10	BY MR. ACOSTA:
11	Q. Can you identify what's in Exhibit 50, please?
12	A. Yes. This is a collection of print
13	advertisements for various cigarette brands from the
14	'40s and the '50s and perhaps even the early '60s, but
15	is seems mostly from the '40 and '50s.
16	Q. And can you look through them and tell us what
17	company may be involved with those brands?
18	A. Sure. There is Benson & Hedges, which was
19	originally an independent company, then was purchased or
20	merged with Philip Morris. Philip Morris brand
21	cigarettes. Philip Morris brand cigarettes.
22	Q. Do you see anything other than Philip Morris
23	in there?
24	A. As I review this, I see the Parliament brand.
25	Alpine. That's a Philip Morris brand. Marlboro. So it
0115
1	appears to be a collection of strictly Philip Morris
2	advertisements.
3	Q. Okay. And are those advertisements of the
4	type that were published in various magazines and
5	newspapers in the country back in the '40s, '50s and
6	perhaps the '60s before 1969?
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: Yes.
9	BY MR. ACOSTA:
10	Q. And do any of those advertisements contain any
11	warnings in them that cigarette smoking might be
12	hazardous to your health?
13	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
14	THE WITNESS: No, no warnings.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. Do those Philip Morris advertisements suggest
17	to people that smoking is addictive?
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Object to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: No, nothing in here suggests
20	that it's addictive to smoke.
21	BY MR. ACOSTA:
22	Q. Let me ask you this. Did any of the
23	advertising before 1969 suggest ways that people might
24	stop smoking if they wanted to?
25	MR. ACOSTA: Objection to the form.
0116
1	THE WITNESS: No, I've never seen any
2	advertising indicating ways to quit smoking.
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. How about after 1969 through 2000, did you
5	ever see any cigarette company advertising that offered
6	to assist smokers in stopping to smoke?
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: No, I've not seen any
9	advertising from the cigarette industry from these
10	defendants offering any kind of smoking cessation
11	help during that period.
12	BY MR. ACOSTA:
13	Q. And have you looked through a large variety of
14	their advertising?
15	A. Advertising, public statements. Yes. All
16	kinds of materials.
17	Q. Did the cigarette companies make any public
18	statements at any time before the year 2000 that they
19	would assist people to quit smoking if people wanted to
20	quit?
21	A. No.
22	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm sorry. Objection to the
23	form.
24	THE WITNESS: No, they did not make any -- any
25	of those statements.
0117
1	BY MR. ACOSTA:
2	Q. Did they ever make statements indicating that
3	they had done anything to their cigarettes to make it
4	easier for people to quit smoking?
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
6	THE WITNESS: No, I've not seen any kind of
7	advertisement or statements by the defendants
8	indicating that their cigarettes were -- were less
9	addictive or easier to quit.
10	BY MR. ACOSTA:
11	Q. In fact, at some point in time did any of the
12	cigarette company defendants go on national TV and tell
13	the public that they, in fact, did not offer them any
14	assistance in stopping smoking?
15	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
16	THE WITNESS: Yes. Tobacco industry officials
17	have made those statements that they offer no
18	anti-smoking or smoking cessation help.
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. Did any of the cigarette company defendants
21	ever take steps or make efforts to prevent others from
22	helping people to quit smoking?
23	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
24	THE WITNESS: Yes.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0118
1	Q. And in the 1980s, is that the first time that
2	Nicorette gum appeared on the market?
3	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: Yes, Nicorette. Yes, a nicotine
5	gum in the 1980s.
6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. Do you know if any of the cigarette company
8	defendants did anything to prevent the sales or
9	manufacture or marketing of Nicorette gum?
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: Well, I'm aware of a defendant's
12	efforts to cease doing business with the
13	manufacturer of Nicorette gum over the issue.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. Who was that? Who was that?
16	A. I believe it was Dow.
17	Q. And who was the cigarette company that ceased
18	doing business with Dow?
19	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
20	THE WITNESS: Philip Morris.
21	BY MR. ACOSTA:
22	Q. And based on your investigation of what was
23	going on with Philip Morris and Dow, did you learn of
24	any reason why Philip Morris would cease doing business
25	with Dow?
0119
1	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: Yes. I've reviewed - I've
3	reviewed evidence on that. And Philip Morris's
4	issue was that they didn't want Dow -- they saw the
5	Nicorette gum as a threat to their business.
6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. And did they eventually start doing business
8	again with Dow?
9	A. I'm not sure if they resumed a business
10	relationship or not.
11	Q. Okay. Let's go back to 1960. Who was the
12	president of the United States in 1960?
13	A. Dwight Eisenhower.
14	Q. And was there an election that year?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. And who won the election?
17	A. John F. Kennedy.
18	Q. And did John F. Kennedy have any involvement
19	with determining whether or not cigarette smoking was
20	hazardous to your health?
21	A. I'm not sure what you are asking. Run that
22	one -- try that one again.
23	Q. Did John F. Kennedy ask the Surgeon General to
24	investigate smoking and health?
25	A. Yes.
0120
1	Q. And he did that when he first became
2	president?
3	A. Yes. Early in his presidency.
4	Q. And so what happened when he directed the
5	Surgeon General to do that? What happened next?
6	A. Well, an advisory committee to the Surgeon
7	General was appointed of a -- staffed by leading
8	scientists.
9	Q. Let me stop you. Who was the Surgeon General?
10	Not his name, but what is the Surgeon General?
11	A. Okay. The Surgeon General is the head of the
12	U.S. Public Health Service. He is the chief medical --
13	the chief medical officer in the federal government.
14	Q. All right. And does he advise the president?
15	A. Yes, he advises the president on medical
16	matters. The Surgeon General at this time was Luther
17	Terry.
18	Q. Did Luther Terry smoke cigarettes?
19	A. He had. He -- yeah, he did, at one point in
20	his life was a smoker.
21	Q. Did President Kennedy smoke?
22	A. Kennedy did smoke, yes.
23	Q. Did his wife smoke?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. What was her name? Jackie?
0121
1	A. Jackie Bouvier Kennedy. Yes. Jackie Kennedy.
2	Q. And so President Kennedy asked the Surgeon
3	General to investigate smoking and health as a
4	governmental matter?
5	A. That's right.
6	Q. And did he do it?
7	A. Yes. The Surgeon -- a Surgeon General's
8	advisory committee was appointed to review the evidence
9	and was charged with compiling a report on smoking and
10	health.
11	Q. And did he ultimately come up with a report?
12	A. The Surgeon General's committee did put
13	together a report, and that report was released in 1964.
14	Q. Was that before or after President Kennedy was
15	assassinated?
16	A. It was released relatively shortly afterward.
17	Kennedy, of course, was killed in October -- I'm sorry,
18	November 22nd, 1963, and the Surgeon General's report
19	was released on January 11th, 1964.
20	Q. And did the cigarette industry agree with the
21	Surgeon General's report?
22	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: No. They disputed the findings.
24	BY MR. ACOSTA:
25	Q. Okay. Let me rephrase that. Did any of the
0122
1	cigarette company defendants in this case agree with the
2	Surgeon General's report?
3	A. No, they disputed the findings.
4	Q. Did they dispute the findings in the public
5	media?
6	A. Yes, they did.
7	Q. Prior to the Surgeon General's report, do you
8	recall whether there was any controversy about whether
9	or not smoking was addictive?
10	MR. ROSENSTEIN: I'm going to object as vague.
11	THE WITNESS: Some -- yeah. That was an issue
12	that was debated. It wasn't nearly as prominent as
13	the lung cancer issue.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. Did the Surgeon General in 1964 determine that
16	smoking was addictive?
17	A. No, they did not make that determination in
18	their findings. They deemed it a habit.
19	Q. Do you know if any time prior to that report
20	whether or not any of the cigarette company defendants
21	had determined that cigarette smoking was -- was
22	addictive?
23	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
24	THE WITNESS: I do know that, yes.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0123
1	Q. Do you know who, a particular, if any,
2	cigarette company defendant felt that cigarette smoking
3	was addictive?
4	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
5	THE WITNESS: Yes. The addictiveness of
6	nicotine in cigarettes was something that was
7	understood certainly, for example, by Addison
8	Yeaman who was a vice-president at the Brown &
9	Williamson Cigarette Corporation.
10	BY MR. ACOSTA:
11	Q. Do you know if the cigarette companies
12	assisted the Surgeon General's committee in coming up
13	with its final report?
14	A. They did. They helped select the members of
15	the committee, the advisory committee, and they also
16	supplied technical and scientific information to the
17	committee.
18	Q. Did any of the cigarette company defendants
19	tell the Surgeon General's committee that they thought
20	that nicotine in cigarettes was addictive?
21	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
22	THE WITNESS: I've not seen anything to that
23	effect, so no.
24	BY MR. ACOSTA:
25	Q. Did any of the cigarette companies that are
0124
1	defendants in this case tell the Surgeon General's
2	committee that they had found carcinogenic substances in
3	cigarette smoke?
4	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
5	THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of them informing
6	the Surgeon General of that information.
7	BY MR. ACOSTA:
8	Q. If that had in fact been done, is that
9	something you would be aware of?
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
11	THE WITNESS: Yes, I would have - I would
12	know that if it had happened.
13	BY MR. ACOSTA:
14	Q. The same with the addiction question. Is that
15	something you would have been aware of if they had told
16	the Surgeon General that they felt that cigarettes were
17	addictive?
18	A. Yes. I mean in both of those cases that would
19	have been a newsworthy piece of information, given the
20	very strong public position that the industry had taken
21	on both of those issues, that it was not a cause of
22	cancer, for example.
23	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm going to object and move to
24	strike the answer.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0125
1	Q. Now, after the Surgeon General's report was
2	issued, were the results given to people on national
3	television?
4	A. Yes. This was big news. And there were
5	special television news reports about the Surgeon
6	General's report. Yes. Its findings.
7	Q. And do you remember specifically what the
8	finding was with respect to lung cancer?
9	A. Yes. The Surgeon General's report concluded
10	that cigarettes were causative of lung cancer in men,
11	and that the evidence leaned in that direction for
12	women.
13	Q. All right. Did it also find that cigarette
14	smoking caused cancer of the larynx?
15	A. Larynx, yes.
16	Q. That's the voice box, right?
17	A. Yes, right.
18	Q. And do you have -- well, let me strike that.
19	Do you remember seeing the Harry Reasoner news
20	back in that time frame?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Maybe you weren't old enough, but have you
23	seen clips of it?
24	A. I've seen clips of it. I was --1 was seven
25	months old when the Surgeon General's report was
0126
1	released, so I don't have a direct memory. But that
2	evening CBS News aired a special report on smoking and
3	health over their -- over their news network.
4	Q. And did -- who was Harry Reasoner, by the way?
5	A. Oh, Harry Reasoner was an eminent CBS newsman
6	who was prominent really in the '50s through the 1970s.
7	Q. And did he have any guests on his show?
8	A. Yes, he did. He interviewed leading
9	scientists and tobacco company officials.
10	Q. Was it his associate, Hockett, that did the
11	interviewing of someone special?
12	A. Well, Howard Cullman, who is a -- was a
13	director of the Philip Morris Corporation and a relative
14	of Joe Cullman, the head of Philip Morris, was tapped to
15	speak for the tobacco industry. He was one of a couple
16	of industry officials that were featured on this
17	program.
18	Q. And did he appear on the program itself?
19	A. Yes. He appeared on the program and gave the
20	industry's position on the Surgeon General's report and
21	its findings.
22	Q. And what did he tell the public at that time
23	about the cigarette industry's position?
24	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
25	THE WITNESS: Well, he told the public that -
0127
1	that the industry did not accept the findings of
2	the Surgeon General's report; that the industry's
3	research had indicated that cigarettes were not the
4	cause of cancer; and that the Surgeon General's
5	report was flawed in some respects. And he
6	particularly pointed to the fact that they did not
7	adequately account for the role of filter
8	cigarettes in -- as a product, you know, as a type
9	of cigarette. And then he concluded by suggesting
10	that if there was anything that may be harmful in
11	cigarettes that they would take it out through
12	filter or other some such means.
13	BY MR. ACOSTA:
14	Q. Was that the same position that Dr. DuPuis
15	took back in 1955?
16	A. Yes, essentially the same position that DuPuis
17	from Philip Morris took in '55, yes.
18	Q. And was it the same position that Clarence
19	Cook Little, the head of the Tobacco Industry Research
20	Committee, took?
21	A. Yes, same position.
22	Q. Do we have a clip of Mr. Cullman's interview?
23	A. Yes. I brought a clip with me.
24	Q. Or at least part of the interview?
25	A. Yes, we have the --
0128
1	Q. Let me put that on the screen for everybody to
2	see.
3	Why don't we go off the record for just a
4	second while I get this thing to come up.
5	(A discussion off the record.)
6	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. Back on the record.
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Do you want to identify this?
8	MR. ACOSTA: We'll give it a number. We'll
9	make it Plaintiffs Exhibit 45.
10	(Plaintiffs Exhibit 45, Video Clip of a
11	Howard Cullman interview, was marked for
12	identification.)
13	MR. GERAGHTY: Are you sure you haven't used
14	that one already?
15	MR. KOETHE: 45?
16	MR. ACOSTA: 45. Okay. Here it goes.
17	(A video clip was played.)
18	FIRST SPEAKER: This is a CBS News extra on
19	smoking and health, the findings of the Surgeon
20	General's committee.
21	MR. REASONER: In our studio this afternoon,
22	following the Surgeon General's news conference,
23	CBS News correspondent Richard C. Hotlet put some
24	questions to one the leading spokesman for the
25	industry, Howard Cullman, president of the Tobacco
0129
1	Merchants Association and a long-time director of
2	the Philip Morris Company. Mr. Cullman, prominent
3	in the New York Theater and civic affairs, is a
4	third generation member of a tobacco family.
5	MR. HOTLET: Mr. Cullman, their conclusions
6	are very stark and pretty solid. They say quite
7	flatly the -- express the judgment that cigarette
8	smoking contributes substantially to mortality from
9	certain specific diseases and to the overall death
10	rate. And they have the rate at 10 times as high
11	for smokers in the case of lung cancer and rather
12	higher in other cases.
13	MR. CULLMAN: Well, that's awful hard to
14	define the word substantial. I don't believe that
15	most people who smoke get lung cancer. We are now
16	in an era, as you know, of moderation. We eat more
17	carefully, we have cholesterol habits, we have
18	drinking habits of lighter whiskey, we have smoking
19	habits, which incidentally are today changing the
20	type of cigarettes from regular cigarettes to
21	filters.
22	Now, I was surprised at the beginning of the
23	conference when Dr. Terry was supposed to have said
24	that there is very little evidence, if any, on the
25	effect, if any, of filter cigarettes. So when we
0130
1	have today 60 percent of the business in the filter
2	field compared to 3 percent 10 years ago, I think
3	we need a little more research.
4	I'm convinced that eventually they will find
5	some element through a filter or through leaf
6	growing or a special type of seed growing that will
7	eliminate the mysterious thing they are looking
8	for. We want to be the detective just as much as
9	the Surgeon General or as the AMA, and we'll
10	cooperate in every way.
11	MR. HOTLET: Well, are you saying then, sir,
12	that there is something toxic about tobacco which
13	is removable by filter?
14	MR. CULLMAN: Well, obviously a filter takes
15	out certain tar and nicotine. I don't think the
16	industry admits there are any bad elements. If
17	there are bad elements, through our laboratories,
18	through the Surgeon General, through the AMA,
19	through acts of God and luck, we hope we may find
20	them. And if they are found, they will be removed.
21	But at this point we do not know.
22	MR. HOTLET: Does any of the research that the
23	tobacco industry has been engaged in refute any
24	part of the findings here or the conclusions as a
25	whole?
0131
1	MR. CULLMAN: Well, without reading the,
2	report, I couldn't answer that to begin with. I
3	don't think the company industry as a whole agrees
4	with the conclusions.

6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, was that Mr. Cullman?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. And after -- after his statement on national
10	TV there, did the cigarette companies continue to
11	publicly disagree with the Surgeon General's report?
12	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
13	THE WITNESS: Yes, they did.
14	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm sorry. Objection to form.
15	THE WITNESS: Yes, they did.
16	BY MR. ACOSTA:
17	Q. How about the Tobacco Institute? Did it take
18	a position with respect to the Surgeon General's report?
19	A. Yes, it did.
20	Q. And what was the Tobacco Institute's position?
21	A. It disputed the findings and conclusions of
22	the Surgeon General's committee, as expressed in the
23	report.
24	Q. And how about the governors of the states
25	where cigarettes were made? Did they take a position?
0132
1	A. They too disputed the report. Governors of
2	North Carolina and Virginia, for example.
3	Q. Okay. Do we have a clip of that?
4	A. We do.
5	Q. Okay. Let's see if we can show that. That
6	will be Exhibit Number 46.
7	(Exhibit 46, Video Clip of comments of state
8	governors, was marked for identification.)
9	MR. ACOSTA: It will start here. It's not
10	going to start where it just did.
11	(The video clip was played.)
12	GOVERNOR TERRY SANFORD: The report says that
13	no simple cause-and-effect relationship is likely
14	to exist between a complex product like tobacco and
15	a specific disease in the variable human organisms.
16	This to me says exactly what many others believe,
17	that this report raised a lot of questions but
18	didn't find the answers.
19	GOVERNOR ALBERTUS HARRISON, JR.: If there b<
20	anything in a cigarette that's harmful, there is no
21	doubt in my mind that that thing can be discovered
22	by doctors, by research people, and that the
23	tobacco industry will eliminate it.
24	GEORGE V. ALLEN: If it's something in tobacco
25	or the smoke that is the causative factor, that can
0133
1	be remedied.
2	(The playing of the video clip was concluded.)
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. Who was that last person that spoke?
5	A. That was George Venable Allen, president of
6	the Tobacco Institute at that time.
7	MR. KOETHE: We are going object to Exhibit 46
8	on foundation grounds.
9	MR. GERAGHTY: Where is that from?
10	MR. ACOSTA: It's from TV.
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Well, what program?
12	MR. ACOSTA: It's from the program that it
13	showed in.
14	MR. GERAGHTY: Which would be?
15	MR. ACOSTA: I don't know what program it came
16	from. I really don't know. I could find out
17	someday.
18	BY MR. ACOSTA:
19	Q. Okay. Dr. Kyriakoudes, have you seen those
20	three clips before?
21	A. I have.
22	Q. And does the Tobacco Institute keep old
23	television clips of newsworthy events regarding its
24	statements to the public?
25	A. Yes. The Tobacco Institute kept extensive
0134
1	video files. Is that what you are referring to?
2	Q. Yeah.
3	A. Of their statements. Yes, it did do that.
4	Q. Were things like this in their video files?
5	A. Things like that would be in their video
6	files.
7	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm going to object to the
8	form.
9	BY MR. ACOSTA:
10	Q. Have you seen photographs of Mr. Allen and
11	these governors in the national newspapers?
12	A. Yes, I have.
13	Q. Are those the people that are in that clip?
14	A. Yes, they are.
15	Q. And, in fact, after this announcement was made
16	on -- or after these announcements were made, did the
17	cigarette industry through the Tobacco Institute
18	continue to deny the Surgeon General's report?
19	MR. ACOSTA: Objection to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: Yes, the Tobacco Institute
21	consistently disputed the findings of the Surgeon
22	General's report.
23	BY MR. ACOSTA:
24	Q. Did the Tobacco Institute specifically deny
25	the Surgeon General's finding that smoking caused
0135
1	cancer?
2	A. Yes. Specifically they disputed the finding
3	that cigarettes were causative of cancer.
4	Q. And did the cigarette company defendants
5	continue to deny after this report that smoking was a
6	cause of cancer?
7	A. Yes, the defendants individually as well
8	denied that smoking caused cancer.
9	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm sorry. I object to the
10	form of that last question.
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. Now, after the Surgeon General's report was
13	released, were there any plans taken by the government
14	to take remedial steps regarding smoking and health?
15	A. Yes. After the report, states proposed
16	various actions at the state level, and then federal
17	actions were proposed as well.
18	Q. Did the cigarette companies go along with
19	them?
20	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm going to object to the
21	form.
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. Did the cigarette companies agree with them?
24	MR. GERAGHTY: Just on the grounds that it's
25	vague. I don't know what you are talking about.
0136
1	BY MR. ACOSTA:
2	Q. Did the cigarette companies agree with the
3	government's steps to take remedial action?
4	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
5	THE WITNESS: They did not, and they opposed
6	them.
7	BY MR. ACOSTA:
8	Q. And what kinds of things did the cigarette
9	company defendants do to oppose the steps that the
10	government wanted to take?
11	A. Well, there were multiple fronts. First, you
12	had action coming from the states. For example,
13	Massachusetts was proposing a labeling law. New York
14	also was discussing that in its state legislature.
15	Also, the Federal Trade Commission was moving to enact a
16	labeling law where they would -- a warning would be
17	placed on cigarette packs. And so the industry lobbied,
18	used its political pull, its influence in the federal
19	government to help shape legislation.
20	Q. In fact, had Mr. Allen, who was the head of
21	the Tobacco Institute, had he been affiliated with
22	government before he became affiliated with the Tobacco
23	Institute?
24	A. Yes. He had been an ambassador. He had held
25	a number of government posts. Was a prominent political
0137
1	figure from the south.
2	Q. And then after he left his post as head of the
3	Tobacco Institute, who was hired next?
4	A. His successor was a gentleman from Kentucky by
5	the name of Earl Clements.
6	Q. And who was -- was Mr. Clements formerly
7	associated with the United States government?
8	A. He had been a senator from Kentucky.
9	Q. And were there witnesses that the tobacco
10	industry used to oppose the steps the government wanted
11	to take?
12	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
13	THE WITNESS: Yeah. There were hearings in
14	1965, cigarette labeling hearings, in which
15	Congress heard testimony from cigarette industry
16	witnesses, public health witnesses, scientists, a
17	variety of people on the issue of smoking and
18	health.
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. And was the cigarette company position
21	published in the national news?
22	A. Yes, it was. It was covered widely. This was
23	a major event.
24	Q. And ultimately, was there steps taken by the
25	government with respect to these -- a remedial measure
0138
1	of some kind?
2	A. Yes. The Cigarette Labeling Act was the
3	legislative outcome of these hearings, and the result of
4	that was a congressionally mandated caution label that
5	would appear on the packs of cigarettes.
6	Q. When you say congressionally mandated, what do
7	you mean?
8	A. It was the result of legislation through
9	Congress as opposed to what had been the original
10	proposal, which was through the regulatory power of the
11	Federal Trade Commission.
12	Q. Now, did the caution label that was finally
13	put into place contradict the finding of the Surgeon
14	General in any way?
15	MR. KOETHE: Object to form.
16	THE WITNESS: I wouldn't say it contradicted.
17	It was --1 think the better description would be
18	thin brew, given the Surgeon General report's
19	conclusion.
20	MR. GERAGHTY: I object to the--1 object to
21	the form and move to strike.
22	I didn't hear what you -- thin brew? Thin
23	brew?
24	THE WITNESS: (Indicating affirmatively).
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay. Thank you.
0139
1	BY MR. ACOSTA:
2	Q. Did the Surgeon General's report determine
3	that cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Did the caution label tell people that
6	cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer?
7	A. No, it did not.
8	Q. Did the caution label say that cigarette
9	smoking may be a hazard?
10	A. That's what it said. It may be hazardous to
11	your health.
12	Q. But the Surgeon General said it would cause
13	cancer?
14	A. That's right. That cigarettes were causative
15	of lung cancer in men and likely so in women.
16	Q. Why did the caution label simply say it may be
17	a hazard?
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: Well, my opinion is that it was
20	the product of a very successful lobbying effort,
21	the quiet victory of the cigarette lobby to enact a
22	mild caution label as opposed to more stringent or
23	more accurate warning labels as proposed originally
24	by the Federal Trade Commission.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0140
1	Q. Why don't you think something that says it
2	might be hazardous is contradictory to something that
3	says it is?
4	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
5	THE WITNESS: Well, the difference is in the
6	former case, it might not be hazardous. It
7	certainly doesn't tell you that the use of the
8	product leads, you know, to diseases like lung
9	cancer, heart disease, emphysema and the other
10	diseases that cigarettes have been associated with,
11	or that cigarettes cause.
12	BY MR. ACOSTA:
13	Q. Did the cigarette company defendants agree
14	with the caution label?
15	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
16	THE WITNESS: No. They disputed the - they
17	disputed the caution label. But in the end it was
18	better than what the alternatives were for them in
19	a political sense.
20	BY MR. ACOSTA:
21	Q. What do you mean by that?
22	A. Well, they were able to forestall a more
23	accurate warning label, at least in 1965. But
24	nonetheless, they still disputed the fact that
25	cigarettes were hazardous to health.
0141
1	Q. Did they make statements in the media that
2	indicated they disagreed with the caution label?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. After this caution label was issued, did
5	cigarette companies -- cigarette sales continue to rise?
6	A. Yes, cigarette sales continued to rise through
7	the 1960s and 1970s.
8	Q. And then at some point in the late 1960s, did
9	certain medical groups start putting ads on television
10	against cigarettes?
11	A. Yes. Public health groups like the American
12	Lung Association, the American Heart Association and the
13	American Cancer Society were able to successfully sue so
14	that a fairness doctrine provision would be applied to
15	the issue of smoking and health. And this is no longer
16	in service today, but at the time the fairness doctrine,
17	what it held stipulated that on any item of controversy
18	of interest to the public, the public airways had to
19	essentially debate both sides of the issue. And this
20	created a space whereby public health groups could air
21	anti-smoking messages.
22	Q. When you say air, you mean put them on
23	television?
24	A. Broadcast them, yes, for free without having
25	to pay for it.
0142
1	Q. And these public health messages, who were
2	they by?
3	A. Well, as I mentioned earlier, mostly the
4	American Heart Association, the American Lung
5	Association and the American Cancer Society. They were
6	the principal promoters of those messages.
7	Q. Did the cigarette companies who are defendants
8	in this case agree with them?
9	A. No, they did not --
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form. I'm sorry.
11	Objection to form.
12	THE WITNESS: No, they did not agree with the
13	position of those organizations on smoking and
14	health.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. And did they take steps to take those public
17	service announcements by the American Cancer Society and
18	the American Heart Association and the American Lung
19	Association, did they take steps to take those messages
20	off the air, to take them off of TV ?
21	A. Well, they did.
22	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
23	THE WITNESS: They did, in fact. Since the
24	fairness doctrine linked --
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0143
1	Q. Let me reask the question. Did the defendants
2	in this case, either individually or through the Tobacco
3	Institute, take steps to have the American Heart
4	Association, the American Lung Association and the
5	American Cancer Association's public service messages to
6	the public taken off the television?
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Object to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: They did take steps to do that.
9	BY MR. ACOSTA:
10	Q. And were they successful in having those
11	public service announcements removed from television?
12	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
13	THE WITNESS: They were successful.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. And how did they go about getting those public
16	service announcements removed from television?
17	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: They did it this way. The
19	public -- the public service announcements were
20	provided -- or the slots on the airways were
21	provided to the public health groups we mentioned
22	earlier by virtue of the fact that the cigarette
23	industry advertised on television. And the reading
24	of the fairness doctrine, as it was determined at
25	the time, was that since there was lots of
0144
1	television advertising for cigarettes, there needed
2	to be, in fairness, equal time -- although it
3	wasn't quite equal -- for public service
4	announcements informing the public of the hazards
5	of smoking.
6	So what the tobacco industry did was, in 1970
7	they voluntarily agreed to remove their advertising
8	from the public airwaves, from television. And
9	once they did that, they severed that relationship
10	or that linkage with the fairness doctrine.
11	Because now, if you didn't have TV commercials
12	advertising cigarettes, you wouldn't have the free
13	time provided to the public health groups to air,
14	in fairness, their anti-smoking messages.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. Have you seen information indicating -- in
17	fact, have you seen information originating from
18	cigarette company defendants that that was their intent?
19	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
20	THE WITNESS: Yes, I have. I have seen them
21	discuss that, yes.
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. And the purpose of their removing their own
24	television ads from television was what?
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Object to form.
0145
1	MR. KOETHE: Objection.
2	THE WITNESS: To sever the connection between
3	their TV advertising and then the free spots -- the
4	free time provided to the public health community
5	to air their anti-smoking spots.
6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. Why did they want to sever it?
8	MR. GERAGHTY: Object to form.
9	THE WITNESS: Oh, because the spots were
10	effective.
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. And the fact that they were effective meant
13	what?
14	A. Well, the fact --
15	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
16	THE WITNESS: Well, the fact that they were
17	effective meant that they actually helped curtail
18	cigarette consumption for a brief period of time.
19	And when the spots were taken back off of the air,
20	at least under this fairness doctrine mechanism,
21	cigarette consumption recovered and increased.
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. Was that the plan of the cigarette company
24	defendants?
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
0146
1	THE WITNESS: Yes.
2	BY MR. ACOSTA:
3	Q. Do you know any other reason why the cigarette
4	companies would take their television commercials off
5	the air in 1970 or so?
6	A. That's the only reason why I know that they
7	voluntarily took them off. This was later mandated by
8	legislation, but the industry made the offer first.
9	Q. Do you know if they offered to take their
10	television advertising off the air for any reason other
11	than to stop the public service announcements?
12	MR. KOETHE: Object to form.
13	THE WITNESS: I don't know of another reason.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. And after the public service announcements
16	were taken off the air, did cigarette company --
17	cigarette sales continue to rise?
18	A. Yes. Consumption recovered.
19	Q. And in 1970, did the government take any
20	additional steps to remediate the harm caused by
21	smoking?
22	A. Well, the industry's offer to remove
23	themselves from the airwaves was then later written into
24	law.
25	Q. All right. Aside from that, did the
0147
1	government ask the industry to do anything with the
2	label on its packages?
3	A. Yes. The caution label that had -- regime
4	which had lasted from 1966 to 1970 essentially was
5	changed. A new warning label was -- a new warning label
6	was instituted.
7	(Plaintiffs Exhibit 21, Warning Label, and
8	Plaintiffs Exhibit 30, Warning Label, were marked
9	for identification.)
10	BY MR. ACOSTA:
11	Q. Okay. Let me show you what's been marked as
12	Plaintiffs Exhibit 21, which was also a Defense Exhibit
13	000001, and let me show you Plaintiffs Exhibit Number
14	30, which was also marked as Defendant's Exhibit 000002.
15	Are those the caution and warning labels that we have
16	been talking of?
17	A. Yes. Exhibit 21 is the first labeling regime
18	from '66 to '70, and Exhibit Number 30 is the one that
19	prevailed after that.
20	Q. Okay. And what does the one in 1970 say?
21	A. Warning. The Surgeon General has determined
22	that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health.
23	Q. And did the cigarette company defendants deny
24	that that was true?
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
0148
1	THE WITNESS: They disputed the meaning of
2	that label. Yes, they did. They disagreed with
3	it.
4	BY MR. ACOSTA:
5	Q. By dispute, what do you mean?
6	A. They objected to its meaning. They claimed
7	that cigarettes were not dangerous to health, that it
8	was unproven.
9	Q. Did they do that publicly in newspapers?
10	A. Newspapers, television, yes.
11	Q. Did one of the CEOs or presidents of one of
12	the defendant companies go on national TV shortly after
13	that warning label went on the package?
14	A. Yes. Joseph Cullman, who was head of the
15	Philip Morris Company and chairman of the Tobacco
16	Institute Board, went on Face the Nation, a news
17	program.
18	Q. And did Face the Nation have a national
19	audience?
20	A. Yes. A nationally broadcast news program.
21	Q. And was he interviewed on that show?
22	A. He was interviewed.
23	Q. Do we have a clip of that?
24	A. We do.
25	Q. Let's show that one. That will be Exhibit
0149
1	Number 47. That's Exhibit 47.
2	(Exhibit 47, Video Clip of a Joseph Cullman
3	interview, was marked for identification.)
4	(A discussion off the record.)
5	(A video clip was played.)
6	UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: From CBS Washington, ii
7	color, Face the Nation, a spontaneous and
8	unrehearsed news interview with Joseph Cullman,
9	III, chairman and chief executive officer of Philip
10	Morris, Incorporated, and chairman of the Executive
11	Committee of the Tobacco Institute.
12	MR. CULLMAN: We have no program that I know
13	of to try to help people stop smoking. We do talk
14	to the question of whether or not cigarettes are
15	hazardous. We do not believe that cigarettes are
16	hazardous. We don't accept that. And that this
17	industry can face the future with confidence
18	because when, as, and if any ingredient of
19	cigarette smoke is identified as being injurious to
20	human health, we are confident that we can
21	eliminate that ingredient.
22	-- tell you that I did read that report, and I
23	concluded from that report that it's true, that
24	babies bom from women who smoke are smaller. But
25	they are just as healthy as the babies bom from
0150
1	women who do not smoke.
2	UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: What about the higher
3	rate of deaths?
4	MR. CULLMAN: And some women would prefer
5	having smaller babies.
6	UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: What about the higher
7	rate of deaths?
8	MR. CULLMAN: I don't -- I'm not familiar with
9	that I don't --
10	(The playing of the video clip was concluded.)
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. All right. Dr. Kyriakoudes, was that doctor
13	Cullman? I mean, was that Joseph Cullman?
14	A. That's right.
15	Q. Now, was his position that if something
16	hamiful was found in cigarette smoke that it would be
17	removed, the same position the cigarette company
18	defendants, at least some of them, took back in 1964?
19	A. That's correct.
20	Q. And was that the same position they took back
21	in 1955?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. And after this Meet The Press interview, did
24	the cigarette company defendants continue to deny that
25	cigarette smoking was hamiful?
0151
1	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to fomi.
2	THE WITNESS: Yes, they continued to deny that
3	cigarettes were the cause of disease, that it was
4	harmful to human health.
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. And did the Tobacco Institute also do that?
7	A. Yes, the Tobacco Institute also did that.
8	Q. And did the Tobacco Institute create its own
9	messages that it presented to the public?
10	A. It did. The Tobacco Institute produced its
11	own films, informational films to get its message
12	across.
13	Q. And do we have a clip of one of those films?
14	A. We do. We have a clip from Smoking and
15	Health, the Need to Know.
16	MR. GERAGHTY: We are going to object to this
17	as not having been properly disclosed. It was
18	disclosed to us on Saturday evening.
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. Did the Need to Know, was it a movie?
21	A. It was. It was an informational film.
22	Q. And did it have actors in it or real people?
23	A. No, it featured medical doctors and
24	scientists.
25	Q. And did it state what those doctors' and
0152
1	scientists' opinions were about smoking and health?
2	A. It did.
3	Q. And did they dispute the Surgeon General's
4	report?
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
6	THE WITNESS: They did. They disputed any
7	connection between smoking and disease.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. And was this movie shown to individuals around
10	the country?
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
12	THE WITNESS: Yes. It was shown across the
13	country to a wide variety of audiences.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. What type of audiences was it shown to?
16	MR. GERAGHTY: Object to form.
17	THE WITNESS: It was shown to adults. It was
18	shown to children. It was shown at churches and
19	hospitals and other public places.
20	BY MR. ACOSTA:
21	Q. Okay. Why don't we show that clip, and I'll
22	ask you maybe another question or two about it in a
23	second.
24	MR. GERAGHTY: Is this one Number 2? 48?
25	MR. ACOSTA: Let's see. We'll make this one
0153
1	48. When Reynolds did this, they would always let
2	me use their media guy.
3	MR. GERAGHTY: We don't have media guys here
4	today.
5	MR. ACOSTA: Yeah. Well, I know. Tomorrow
6	you will.

8	UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: This is America
9	today -- the pace fast, the competition great. We
10	live with more tension, more emotion, more concern
11	about our health, more everything than ever before.
12	--is perhaps our very health involved.
13	For the next few minutes we will be examining
14	our stressful society, what it's doing to us, and
15	the impact of our total behavior on our health.
16	Specifically, we will be looking at one of the more
17	controversial aspects of modem life -- tobacco and
18	its use, particularly in cigarettes.
19	So it goes on many different scientific
20	fronts. About lung cancer, Dr. Langston.
21	DR. LANGSTON: I cannot point to anything that
22	I would consider the cause of cancer of the lung,
23	but the behavior of the disease does not support
24	the idea of cigarettes being the causal agent in
25	the production of this disease.
0154
1	UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: About heart disease,
2	Dr. Seltzer.
3	DR. SELTZER: I think where we stand now, the
4	best we can say is that we do not know whether or
5	not there is a causal relationship between smoking
6	and heart disease. Neither does the Public Health
7	Service know, nor do I.
8	UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: About emphysema, Dr.
9	Levine.
10	DR. LEVINE: There are large numbers of us
11	who have some background in this field who do not
12	believe the evidence is sufficient for the
13	statements that have been made.
14	UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: About general
15	statistical associations of health and smoking, Dr.
16	Ober.
17	DR. OBER: I think we have a great deal to
18	learn, and I think far too many people have rushed
19	to a premature judgment based upon very inadequate
20	evidence, chiefly because there is a tremendous
21	emotional need to oversimplify it and make things
22	easy and palatable, for the public, for medical
23	students, as well as legislators.
24	UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: All of us are
25	quite humanly attracted to easy answers. We are
0155
1	not permitted to be satisfied with them for long.
2	As our society accelerates at an increasingly
3	faster pace and grows more complicated, we are
4	forced to seek true answers based not on
5	statistical coincidence but on meaningful research
6	into causes.
7	(The playing of the video excerpt was
8	concluded.)
9	MR. ACOSTA: That's the end of the clip.
10	Okay. We need to switch the tape, videotape, so
11	let's go off the record.
12	(A pause was had in the proceedings.)
13	MR. ACOSTA: Are we back on the record?
14	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Yes.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. Okay. Now, Dr. Kyriakoudes, that video clip
17	from the Tobacco Institute, did that -- that showed that
18	it was made in 1972. Do you know for how long it was
19	shown to people after that?
20	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm going to object to the
21	form.
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. Well, let me ask it a different way. Dr.
24	Kyriakoudes, do you remember when that video clip was
25	made?
0156
1	A. 1972.
2	Q. And do you know for how long after 1972 it was
3	continued to be shown to the various groups, church,
4	school, whatever the groups were that you mentioned
5	before?
6	MR. GERAGHTY: Object to the form.
7	BY MR. ACOSTA:
8	Q. Do you know how long the video was continued
9	to be shown to the groups you mentioned before?
10	A. At least until 1978.
11	Q. Now, during the early 1970s, did the cigarette
12	companies come out with a new kind of cigarette in
13	addition to their filter cigarettes?
14	A. Yes. Low tar light and ultra-light cigarettes
15	came onto the market.
16	Q. And did all of the cigarette company
17	defendants make low tar, and what did you say? Ultra
18	low tar?
19	A. No. I said light and ultra-light.
20	Q. Light and ultra-light. Did all the cigarette
21	companies come out with new light and ultra-light
22	versions of their cigarettes?
23	A. Yes. Either light and ultra-light versions of
24	established brands, in the case of Marlboros, or new
25	brands that were light and ultra-light.
0157
1	Q. And did those cigarettes boost their sales in
2	any way?
3	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
4	BY MR. ACOSTA:
5	Q. Well, let me ask it this way. Did those new
6	brands, the lights and ultra lights, affect cigarette
7	sales in the late 1960s and 1970s?
8	MR. GERAGHTY: Just so you know, Howard, I'm
9	objecting to the foundation and speculation, so
10	it's not -- not anything wrong about the way you
11	are actually forming the question from my
12	perspective.
13	MR. ACOSTA: Thank you very much.
14	THE WITNESS: They were part of the mix of
15	cigarettes that were sold in the -- you know,
16	beginning with Carlton in 1964 and going onward,
17	and they accounted for an increasingly larger share
18	of the cigarette market.
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. Was this at a time when cigarette sales
21	continued to rise?
22	A. Cigarette sales did continue to rise in the
23	1970s.
24	Q. Now from -- well, let me ask you this. Did
25	the cigarette, any of the cigarette company defendants
0158
1	ever tell the public that their light and ultra-light
2	cigarettes were no safer than their regular cigarettes?
3	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
4	THE WITNESS: Not during the time period you
5	are discussing, the 1970s, no.
6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. So in the 1970s did any cigarette companies
8	tell smokers that light and ultra-light cigarettes were
9	no safer than the regular full-flavored brands?
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
11	THE WITNESS: That's correct. They did not
12	tell them that they were not safer.
13	BY MR. ACOSTA:
14	Q. In the 1980s, did any of the cigarette company
15	defendants tell any of the people who purchased light
16	and ultra-light cigarettes that they were no safer
17	smoking them than they were smoking the full-flavored
18	brands?
19	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
20	THE WITNESS: Same is -- the same as true with
21	the 1980s. In fact, it's only been very recently,
22	in recent times that tobacco manufacturers have
23	informed the public that lights and ultra lights
24	are in fact no safer than regular full-flavor
25	cigarettes.
0159
1	MR. GERAGHTY: Move to strike the response.
2	BY MR. ACOSTA:
3	Q. Has Philip Morris since 2000 told smokers that
4	smoking lights and ultra lights is no safer than smoking
5	regular brands?
6	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection, form.
7	THE WITNESS: Yes, since 2000 they have
8	informed the public on that.
9	BY MR. ACOSTA:
10	Q. At any time between -- well, let me ask you
11	this. What was the first light cigarette marketed, if
12	you remember?
13	A. Well, I would say the Carlton cigarette by the
14	American Tobacco Company, which was released in 1964,
15	was the first.
16	Q. Between 1964 and 2000, did any cigarette
17	company, including American Tobacco, acknowledge that
18	smoking lights or ultra lights was not any safer than
19	smoking a regular brand full-flavored cigarette?
20	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
21	THE WITNESS: No. None of them said that
22	light cigarettes posed the same risks as regular
23	cigarettes. Their position was there were no
24	risks.
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Move to strike as
0160
1	nonresponsive.
2	BY MR. ACOSTA:
3	Q. Has since the year 2000 any of the cigarette
4	company defendants advertised to smokers that, in fact,
5	lights and ultra lights are no safer than a regular
6	full-flavored cigarette?
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Object to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: Since then Philip Morris has.
9	BY MR. ACOSTA:
10	Q. Is that information on Philip Morris's
11	website? Or has it been on -- excuse me. Has that
12	information been on Philip Morris's website?
13	A. Yes, it has.
14	Q. Do you know how long defendant Liggett & Myers
15	was a member of the Tobacco Institute?
16	A. They dropped in and out of TI and the CTR. I
17	don't have the exact dates at hand.
18	Q. Were they members in and out in the 1960s?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Were they members in and out into the'70s?
21	A. I believe so, yes.
22	Q. And were they also members of the Tobacco
23	Industry Research Committee, which became the CTR?
24	A. Yes, they were. Although not initially in
25	'54, they did later join.

1	(Exhibit 32, Document titled Liggett Gram,
2	dated September 26, 1978, was marked for
3	identification.)
4	BY MR. ACOSTA:
5	Q. Let me show you what has been marked
6	Plaintiffs Exhibit Number 32 and ask you if you would
7	identify that exhibit.
8	MR. KOETHE: I would object to the
9	introduction of this document.
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Yeah. Just for the record,
11	this document was produced on Saturday afternoon,
12	and that was after Judge Terrell had ruled that at
13	that point the only documents that could be
14	disclosed by plaintiff were those documents that --
15	additional documents that plaintiff believed he or
16	she might need for redirect examination.
17	MR. ACOSTA: Well, I'm not sure that I agree
18	with you. But anyway, we can proceed with the
19	document.
20	BY MR. ACOSTA:
21	Q. Can you identify Plaintiffs Exhibit Number
22	32?
23	A. Yes. This is a Liggett & Myers press release
24	called a Liggett Gram. It's dated September 26, 1978.
25	Q. And does that -- is that Liggett Gram a
0162
1	statement of defendant Liggett & Myers?
2	A. Yes, it is.
3	Q. And does that Liggett Gram state what Liggett
4	& Myers' position is on the issue of smoking and health?
5	MR. ROSENSTEIN: Objection.
6	THE WITNESS: Yes, it does state their
7	position on smoking and health.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. Would you let me put that on the screen? And
10	we'll display it and then read from it.
11	A. You might want to adjust the overhead light.
12	I don't know if that's possible. No, I can read it. I
13	can read it.
14	MR. ACOSTA: I'm displaying it so I'll get to
15	display it later. So that's why I am displaying it
16	now.
17	MR. KOETHE: I understand.
18	MR. ACOSTA: If you want to let me display it
19	later, that would be fine, and I won't have to do
20	this.
21	MR. KOETHE: As long as we have an objection
22	on the record, and we'll deal with that later, you
23	can.
24	MR. GERAGHTY: You are just going to read from
25	the document, aren't you?
0163
1	MR. ACOSTA: I'm going to ask Dr. Kyriakoudes.
2	BY MR. ACOSTA:
3	Q. Can you read it from there?
4	A. Yeah, I can read it.
5	Q. Would you read it, please?
6	A. Special Edition. Liggett Responds to Press
7	Report on New Tobacco Research.
8	As it was reported in the press today, Liggett
9	& Meyers Tobacco Company has received a US patent
10	concerning the development of a catalytic process which,
11	when applied to tobacco, reduces the biological activity
12	of smoke condensate on the backs of mice in laboratory
13	experiments. The report gave the misleading impression
14	that Liggett & Myers in its patent made the admission of
15	a link between smoking and cancer. Liggett has made no
16	such admission. The fact is that for more than two
17	decades scientific researchers have produced tumors on
18	mouse skin by the application of enormous dosages of
19	smoke condensate. Neither the industry nor Liggett has
20	denied these results. Liggett and the cigarette
21	industry continue to deny, as they have consistently,
22	that any conclusions can be drawn relating to such test
23	results on mice in laboratories to cancer in human
24	beings.
25	I think I might have bungled that a little
0164
1	bit. It's hard to read.
2	It has never been established that smoking is
3	a cause of human cancer.
4	MR. ROSENSTEIN: Objection. Move to strike.
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. Do you want to just read the last paragraph to
7	be complete?
8	A. Yeah. The laboratory experiments reported in
9	the patent were conduced for Liggett by an independent
10	researcher, the Life Sciences Division of Arthur D.
11	Little, Incorporated.
12	Q. Who is Arthur D. Little, Incorporated?
13	A. Arthur D. Little, Incorporated, is an
14	independent contract research organization that had for
15	some time conducted research for the Liggett & Myers
16	Company.
17	MR. KOETHE: Can you read the date of that, by
18	the way?
19	MR. ACOSTA: Yeah. The date is September 26,
20	1978.
21	MR. KOETHE: Thank you.
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. Did defendant Liggett & Myers continue after
24	December of 1978 to deny that cigarette smoking was a
25	cause of cancer?
0165
1	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection.
2	THE WITNESS: Yes, they continued to deny that
3	cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer.
4	BY MR. ACOSTA:
5	Q. Now, did Senator Clements, who you mentioned
6	earlier who was the president of the Tobacco Institute,
7	did he leave and was his job filled by another person?
8	A. Yes. He was eventually succeeded by Horace
9	Komegay.
10	Q. And who is Horace Komegay?
11	A. Horace Komegay was a fomier representative in
12	Congress from North Carolina and, you know, by the 1970s
13	had moved to the Tobacco Institute.
14	Q. And did Mr. Komegay -- what position did he
15	take with respect to smoking and health?
16	A. Oh, his position was that we simply don't
17	know; that it's unproven; that cigarettes are not a
18	cause of disease.
19	Q. It's unproven they are not a cause or unproven
20	they are a cause --
21	A. Oh. I'm sorry.
22	Q. — the way I understood you?
23	A. Okay. Let me rephrase that. Korengay's
24	position was that cigarettes were not a cause of disease
25	in humans and that we simply don't know.
0166
1	Q. And did he take that position publicly?
2	A. He did. He did take that position publicly.
3	Q. And do we have a video clip of him taking that
4	position?
5	A. Yes, in Congress.
6	Q. Let's show that one. It will be Exhibit
7	Number 49.
8	(Exhibit 49, Video Clip of Horace Komegay
9	testifying before Congress, was marked for
10	identification.)
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Object, because this was not
12	properly disclosed to us, I don't believe.
13	Are you going to identify it beyond that? Or
14	is it just Komegay testifying before Congress?
15	MR. ACOSTA: Would you like some more info?
16	MR. GERAGHTY: Well, I've got some objections.
17	Lack of foundation as well.
18	MR. ACOSTA: Well, I'll see if I can help you
19	in a minute.

21	UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Do you agree that
22	people are dying prematurely as a result of smoking
23	cigarettes?
24	MR. KORNEGAY: No, sir, I do not -- cigarettes
25	cause the death and disease that have been
0167
1	attributed to them. My position is simply they may
2	or they may not, but that until we get better --
3	and I'm sincere that we really don't know at
4	this -- nobody knows the -- you know. Science
5	doesn't --
6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. Was that Mr. Komegay?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. And do you remember the year that was done?
10	A. Oh, that was 1978.
11	Q. And was he telling someone what his position
12	was with respect to smoking and health?
13	A. Yes, his position and the position of the
14	Tobacco Institute.
15	Q. Was he speaking on behalf of the Tobacco
16	Institute?
17	A. Yes.

20	Q. And was the -- again, was the Tobacco
21	Institute the organization that spoke for the industry,
22	the cigarette industry?

24	public face of the cigarette manufacturers.
25	Q. And did that include all the defendants who
0168
1	are defendants in this case?
2	A. Yes, it did.
3	Q. Now, did the defendants in this case continue
4	to make public denials regarding the cause-and-effect
5	relationship between smoking and cancer into the 1980s?

16	BY MR. ACOSTA:
17	Q. Did the cigarette company defendants -- well,
18	let me strike that.
19	Did any of the cigarette company defendants

9	Million Yearly on Search For a Safe Cigarette, was
10	marked for identification.)
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. I'm going to show you Plaintiffs Exhibit 36
13	in just one second. Would you identify plaintiffs
14	Exhibit 36 for us?
15	A. This is an April 15, 1985, story from the New
16	York Times. And the title is U.S. Spends $5 million
17	Yearly on Search For a Safe Cigarette.
18	Q. Okay. Then do you see a photograph in the
19	middle of that particular document there?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. Let me take it and put it on the screen.
22	Okay. Would you look toward the bottom of the
23	first column there? It says, The tobacco industry
24	continues to maintain that no scientific connection has
25	been established linking cigarette smoking to illness
0170
1	and death.
2	Asked about the federal research and reports
3	that his company was doing similar research on a "safe"
4	cigarette, David Fishel, a spokesman for R. J. Reynolds
5	Tobacco Company, a major cigarette manufacturer, said,
6	"I don't know anything about it. We don't know of
7	anything that makes a cigarette unsafe, so how could we
8	be working toward a safer cigarette?"
9	In 1985, do you know if that statement was
10	correct?

12	THE WITNESS: I'm not-
13	BY MR. ACOSTA:
14	Q. Do you know if his statement -- well, let me
15	ask you this. Do you know if in 1985 R. J. Reynolds
16	Tobacco Company was working on a safer cigarette?
17	A. Well, they, in fact --
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form. I'm sorry.

24	Q. Was this called the Premier?
25	A. That's right. Premier.
0171
1	Q. And so Mr. Fishel, a spokesman for Reynolds,

3	make a safe cigarette because there was nothing wrong

9	THE WITNESS: That's what he said in the
10	paper. Yet they were working on Premier.
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. Do you know who Dr. Rodgman was?
13	A. A scientist at the R. J. Reynolds Company.
14	Q. Do you know if Dr. Rodgman had determined back
15	in the early 1960s that cigarette smoke was probably a
16	cause of cancer?
17	MR. KOETHE: Object to form.
18	THE WITNESS: Yes, he had identified that.
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. Did you see that in documents that he had
21	authored?
22	MR. KOETHE: Object to form.
23	THE WITNESS: Yes, I saw that in documents
24	that he had authored.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0172
1	Q. Can you compare what David Fishel, the R. J.
2	Reynolds Tobacco Company spokesman, said when he said we
3	don't know of anything that makes a cigarette unsafe, so
4	how could we be working toward a safer cigarette, can
5	you compare that with what you learned that Dr. Rodgman
6	at R. J. Reynolds had found back in the early 1960s?
7	MR. KOETHE: Object to form. Lack of
8	foundation.
9	THE WITNESS: Yes, I can compare that. And
10	they are contradictory statements.
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. And was the New York Times a national paper?
13	A. At this time and still, yes, the New York
14	Times is a national paper.
15	Q. In 1985, did it have -- how significant was
16	the readership in 1985 of the New York Times?
17	A. A significant readership in New York and also
18	nationally distributed.
19	Q. After 1985, did R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company
20	continue to deny that smoking was a cause of cancer?
21	MR. KOETHE: Object to form.
22	THE WITNESS: Yes, they continued to deny that
23	smoking caused cancer.
24	BY MR. ACOSTA:
25	Q. And did R. J. Reynolds publish a statement in
0173
1	a national magazine in 1984 on the issue of smoking and
2	health?
3	A. Yes, they did. Let's Have an Open Debate on
4	Smoking and Health. Yes, they did.
5	Q. I have a copy of something similar to this.
6	This is what I used before. I just couldn't --1 didn't
7	have the ability to scan it in and get it to you. But
8	you all know what this is.
9	MR. GERAGHTY: Does the Doctor have copies?
10	MR. ACOSTA: I'm going to put it on the
11	screen, and we will have to make a copy of this and
12	add it later.
13	What exhibit number is available?
14	(A discussion off the record.)
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. Let me show you what I am going to have marked
17	as plaintiff s Exhibit 51.
18	(Exhibit 51, Advertisement from Time Magazine,
19	dated February 6, 1984, was marked for
20	identification.)
21	BY MR. ACOSTA:
22	Q. And let me ask you to identify this, if you
23	would.
24	A. This is a full-page advertisement placed in
25	the February 6, 1984, issue of Time Magazine. And it's
0174
1	entitled Can We Have an Open Debate About Smoking?
2	Q. And you --
3	A. And it's signed R. J. Reynolds Company.
4	Q. Is this an original?
5	A. That is a bound original, yes.
6	Q. Okay. Is this the cover of the magazine?
7	A. That's the cover.
8	Q. Who is that?
9	A. That is then-President Ronald Reagan.
10	Q. And then would you read what it says starting
11	with --
12	A. Over the years?
13	Q. Well, let's start with the first, first
14	paragraph. And would you read the first four
15	paragraphs?
16	A. Okay. Well, the title says, Can We Have an
17	Open Debate About Smoking? The issues that surround
18	smoking are so complex and so emotional, it's hard to
19	debate them objectively. In fact, many of you probably
20	believe there is nothing to debate. Over the years
21	you've heard so many negative reports about smoking and
22	health and so little to challenge these reports that you
23	may assume the case against smoking is closed. But this
24	is far from the truth.
25	Q. Did R. J. Reynolds take the position at this
0175
1	time that smoking was not a cause of lung cancer?
2	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
3	THE WITNESS: That was their public position,
4	yes.
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. In fact, that's what their spokesman,
7	Mr. Fishel, said the following year. Is that your
8	understanding?
9	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
10	BY MR. ACOSTA:
11	Q. Let me ask you this.
12	A. Excuse me. A bit of a cough there. Okay.
13	Q. The year after the open debate, did Dr. Fishel
14	indicate that R. J. Reynolds was taking the position
15	that smoking was not a cause of disease?
16	A. That's the position --
17	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: - Mr. Fishel took.
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. And was that the position that R. J. Reynolds
21	took in 1990 in the Jo Spach letter that we previously
22	looked at which we identified as Plaintiffs Exhibit --
23	let me start over with that one.
24	Okay. And the position that Mr. Fishel took,
25	was that also the position taken by the manager of
0176
1	public relations, Ms. Spach, at R. J. Reynolds in 1990?
2	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
3	THE WITNESS: Yes, those positions are all
4	consistent and the same.
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. Now, do you know the year that the Surgeon
7	General first determined that cigarette smoking was, in
8	fact, addictive?
9	A. Yes. The Surgeon General came to that
10	conclusion in the 1988 Surgeon General's report.
11	Q. Did any of the cigarette company defendants in
12	this case agree with the Surgeon General --
13	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. -- at that time?
16	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm sorry. Objection to form.
17	THE WITNESS: No. They disagreed with the
18	Surgeon General report's conclusion that smoking
19	was addictive.
20	BY MR. ACOSTA:
21	Q. Did any representative of the cigarette
22	industry through the Tobacco Institute make public
23	statements about the finding of the Surgeon General that
24	cigarettes were addictive in 1988?
25	A. Yes. The Tobacco Institute, like the rest of
0177
1	the industry, challenged the conclusion that cigarettes
2	were addictive.
3	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form and move to
4	strike.
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. Did the Tobacco Institute continue to
7	challenge the idea that cigarette smoking was addictive
8	into the 1990s?
9	MR. ACOSTA: Objection.
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
11	THE WITNESS: Yes, they continued to challenge
12	the idea that cigarette smoking was addictive into
13	the 1990s.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. And did each of the tobacco company cigarette
16	companies -- excuse me. Did each of the cigarette
17	company defendants in this case continue to challenge
18	the idea that cigarette smoking was addictive into the
19	1990s?
20	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
21	THE WITNESS: Yes.
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. And did they do that publicly?
24	A. They challenged it publicly, yes.
25	Q. Did they challenge it through advertising?
0178
1	Did any of them challenge it through advertising, I
2	should say. Let me strike that and start over.
3	Did any of the cigarette company defendants
4	challenge the idea that cigarette smoking was addictive
5	by advertising it was not?
6	MR. ACOSTA: Objection.
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
8	THE WITNESS: Yes, that is the case. In fact,
9	the Philip Morris company ran a series of ads in
10	1994 making the claim that smoking was not
11	addictive.
12	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection, move to strike.
13	BY MR. ACOSTA:
14	Q. Did the chief executive officers of the
15	cigarette company defendants in this case take the
16	position before Congress that cigarette smoking was not
17	addictive?
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
19	THE WITNESS: Yes. They took that position
20	while testifying before Congress in the spring of
21	1994. And that position was that cigarettes were
22	not addictive.
23	MR. GERAGHTY: Do you need some water?
24	THE WITNESS: I've got some. Thanks. I
25	appreciate it. Got something in my throat.
0179
1	BY MR. ACOSTA:
2	Q. Did you know who Andrew W. Tisch is?
3	A. Yeah. Yes. He was head of Lowe's
4	Corporation, which was the holding company that held the
5	Lorillard Cigarette Company.
6	Q. And do you remember statements that Mr. Tisch
7	made in 1994 about smoking and health?
8	A. Yes. Tisch denied that cigarettes were
9	addictive and denied that they were causative of
10	disease. Walker Merryman at the Tobacco Institute and
11	other heads of the companies made the same and similar
12	kinds of statements.
13	Q. Do you know if Mr. Tisch knew of anyone that
14	had died as a result of smoking?
15	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
16	BY MR. ACOSTA:
17	Q. Strike that. Let me ask it a different way.
18	Do you know if Mr. Tisch stated publicly that
19	he didn't know that anyone had ever died of cigarette
20	smoking in 1994?
21	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
22	THE WITNESS: That's, in fact, what he said.
23	He said he did not know anyone that had died from
24	smoking-related disease.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0180
1	Q. And who was Mr. Merryman?
2	A. Walker Merryman was an official with the
3	Tobacco Institute.
4	Q. And in the 1994 time frame, did he also take
5	the position, that it had not been established that
6	cigarette smoking was the cause of disease?
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
8	THE WITNESS: That's right, that cigarettes
9	did not cause lung cancer or other diseases.
10	BY MR. ACOSTA:
11	Q. Other than defendant Liggett & Myers, before
12	the year 2000, did any of the defendant cigarette
13	companies tell the public in the media, through the news
14	media or their advertising or in any other manner that
15	they believed that cigarette smoking was dangerous and
16	would cause cancer?
17	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
18	THE WITNESS: No. None of the firms as you
19	have described before 2000, with the exception of
20	Liggett, informed the public of the fact that
21	cigarettes caused cancer and other serious
22	diseases. They continued to deny it up to that
23	point.
24	BY MR. ACOSTA:
25	Q. And did they continue to deny that cigarette
0181
1	smoking was addictive up through 2000?
2	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
3	THE WITNESS: Yes. And they continued to deny
4	that cigarette smoking was addictive.
5	MR. ACOSTA: Why don't we take a break, our
6	afternoon break right now.
7	(A pause was had in the proceedings.)
8	MR. ACOSTA: Dr. Kyriakoudes, I don't have any
9	further questions at this time, and so I'll turn
10	you over to the defense lawyers. Thank you.
11	THE WITNESS: You are welcome.
12	CROSS-EXAMINATION
13	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
14	Q. Good afternoon, Dr. Kyriakoudes. How are you
15	doing?
16	A. I'm well.
17	Q. Let me ask -- start by asking you a couple of
18	questions. First of all, you are an associate professor
19	of history at the University of Southern Mississippi,
20	correct?
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. All right. You do not have a medical degree,
23	do you?
24	A. No, I don't.
25	Q. You do not have any kind of medical background
0182
1	whatsoever, right?
2	A. I'm not a medical doctor.
3	Q. You do not have a science degree, do you?
4	A. Social science but not hard science.
5	Q. You don't have a hard science degree, do you?
6	A. No, I'm not a biologist or anything like that.
7	Q. Or anything kind of background in any of the
8	hard sciences; is that correct?
9	A. No. That's not my professional area.
10	Q. So my question is correct, right?
11	A. That's right.
12	Q. You have no background in the hard sciences?
13	A. Not any different than any other college
14	educated person.
15	Q. You are here today serving as an expert
16	witness in a lawsuit, correct?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. An expert witness on behalf of the plaintiff,
19	right?
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. Would you agree with me that an expert
22	witness, someone sitting in your shoes, should be
23	neutral?
24	A. What do you mean by neutral?
25	Q. Well, you told us that you followed the
0183
1	historical method, right? You are here to tell the jury
2	what you understand and what you believe to be the
3	facts, right?
4	A. That's true.
5	Q. And in telling the jury those facts, don't you
6	think an expert witness should be neutral?
7	A. Well, they should be neutral as to the facts,
8	yes. Or -- well, let me rephrase that.
9	They need to be true to their methods and true
10	to the data and true to their analysis, yes. Honest,
11	forthright.
12	Q. I'm sorry. I don't mean to interrupt you,
13	Doctor. My question is very simple. Should an expert
14	witness be neutral?
15	MR. ACOSTA: I think he just answered that
16	question. I object to the reasking of it.
17	MR. GERAGHTY: I don't think he answered my
18	question.
19	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
20	Q. Should an expert witness be neutral?
21	A. Well, again, as I said earlier, I need to be
22	true to my methods and to the data that I've analyzed
23	and fair and honest in my judgments, professional
24	judgments and opinions.
25	Q. Well, but are you neutral? Do you think you
0184
1	are neutral?
2	A. Yes. I mean I'm a neutral witness in the
3	sense that I don't have a stake in the outcome of
4	anything. I'm simply compensated for my time here.
5	Q. Let's -- let's talk about that for a few
6	moments. This is not the first time you are testifying
7	in a lawsuit involving the tobacco companies as
8	defendants, correct?
9	A. That's true.
10	Q. And since about 2000 you have testified
11	against tobacco companies on a number of occasions, have
12	you not?
13	A. Do you mean at trial or trial and deposition?
14	Q. Well, let's be specific. Prior to today,
15	you've testified in 11 separate trials in which one or
16	more of the companies who are defendants in this case
17	were defendants in that case, right?
18	A. That sounds about right, yeah.
19	Q. And in all 11 of those cases, you were an
20	expert witness on behalf of the plaintiff. In other
21	words, a person who is filing a lawsuit against one or
22	more of the tobacco companies, correct?
23	A. Yes, in cases in which tobacco companies have
24	been party to the lawsuit, I have been on the
25	plaintiffs side.
0185
1	Q. Right.
2	A. In the sense that, to be more accurate, I have
3	been asked by the plaintiff to testify.
4	Q. Doctor, in the 11 cases previously in which
5	you have testified at a trial, you have testified as an
6	expert witness for the plaintiff, correct?
7	A. At the request of the plaintiff, yes.
8	Q. Okay. You were an expert witness on behalf of
9	the plaintiff, right?
10	A. At the request of the plaintiff.
11	Q. In addition to that, you've given a deposition
12	in probably twice as many cases, right?
13	A. Yes. I have been deposed very many times. By
14	you at least four or five times, and probably that many
15	by Mr. Paul Koethe, who is also here in this room.
16	Q. Doctor, my question isn't about who took your
17	deposition. My question is have you not given a
18	deposition, just as you are giving today, where you are
19	sworn under oath in which you testified as a witness for
20	a plaintiff in a lawsuit against one or more of the
21	companies who are defendants in this case?
22	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
23	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
24	Q. Yes or no?
25	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
0186
1	THE WITNESS: Yes, I have been --1 have been
2	deposed many times.
3	(Defendant's Exhibit 1, List of testimony of
4	the witness, was marked for identification.)
5	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
6	Q. I'm going to just display what we'll mark as
7	Defendant's Exhibit Number 1.
8	Doctor, what we've marked as deposition
9	Exhibit Number 1 are a list of all of the cases in which
10	you have testified either at a trial or in a deposition,
11	correct?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. Okay. Now, you made a comment in response to
14	one of Mr. Acosta's questions this morning, you said
15	that you had testified on behalf of defendants on more
16	than one occasion; is that right?
17	A. I had been -- at the request of defendants I
18	had testified in a trial, yes.
19	Q. Just so the record is clear, so the jury
20	doesn't get any misimpression when they are watching
21	this videotape, of all those cases that are listed up
22	there, there is only one case in which you were hired by
23	a party other than a plaintiff, correct?
24	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form and move to
25	strike.
0187
1	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
2	Q. You can answer the question, Doctor.
3	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form and move to strike
4	that.
5	THE WITNESS: Yes. But that list is
6	incomplete.
7	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
8	Q. Doctor, the list is incomplete? How so?
9	A. Well, I've, at the request of defendants in
10	other litigation, I have been asked for expert reports
11	and have been disclosed as a witness. So they've never
12	deposed me, but I have been disclosed in other cases.
13	Q. Doctor, what I have put up here are a list of
14	all the cases in which you either gave a deposition or
15	testified at a trial. The list is accurate and
16	complete, is it not?
17	A. Yeah. For the ones where I gave testimony,
18	yes.
19	Q. Right.
20	A. It seems so.
21	Q. And the one case, there was only one case you
22	were referring to earlier where you testified on behalf
23	of a defendant, and that's the case called Martin on the
24	right-hand column, right? Do you see that?
25	A. Yes.
0188
1	Q. That was a case in which you testified in a
2	trial in June of 2007 on behalf of asbestos companies;
3	is that correct?
4	A. That's right. Keasby Pipe Fitting Company.
5	Q. I just wanted to make sure that was clear. In
6	the one case in which you testified on behalf of a
7	defendant, it was on behalf of asbestos companies,
8	correct?
9	A. Yes. The same testimony.
10	Q. And those asbestos companies wanted you to
11	talk about the conduct of the defendants in this case,
12	the cigarette companies, correct?
13	A. Yes. I said about the same thing I've said
14	today.
15	Q. Your testimony, if we were to go back, you
16	have been testifying as far back as 2000, correct?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. And as far as you are concerned, your
19	testimony has been consistent from 2000 right on up
20	until now, correct?
21	A. Yes, in the broadest outlines. I've learned
22	more over time.
23	Q. Has your -- Doctor, my question is simply is
24	your testimony the same today substantively as it was
25	back in 2000, the first time you ever testified under
0189
1	oath?
2	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form. He's already
3	answered that question. He said yes and then gave
4	an explanation.
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Howard, we don't need to give
6	speak objections. All you've got to do is say
7	objection to form, and if I want to know what the
8	basis of it is, then I will ask you.
9	MR. ACOSTA: Well, I don't want you to badger
10	him by continuing to press him for answers, because
11	I think that's objectionable. And you are going to
12	get a speaking objection when you do that.
13	MR. GERAGHTY: And, you know, Howard --
14	MR. ACOSTA: Sorry.
15	MR. GERAGHTY: --1 didn't make any speaking
16	objections during your testimony.
17	MR. ACOSTA: And I didn't badger the witness.
18	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm not -- you know what?
19	Howard, I'm not badgering the witness. I think the
20	record will show that.
21	MR. ACOSTA: I think you are.
22	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
23	Q. In addition -- so, Doctor, if we put this back
24	up, by my count, prior to today, you've testified under
25	oath in 29 separate cases over the course of the last
0190
1	approximately eight years; is that right?
2	A. That sounds right.
3	Q. And with the exception of the Martin case
4	which we just talked about, in all of those cases you've
5	testified as a witness for the plaintiff, correct?
6	A. At the request of the plaintiff, yes.
7	Q. You were a witness for the plaintiff? Yes or
8	no.
9	MR. ACOSTA: Object to the form. He answered
10	yes.
11	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
12	Q. Were you a witness for the plaintiff,
13	Dr. Kyriakoudes? Yes or no.
14	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
15	THE WITNESS: I testified at the request of
16	the plaintiff.
17	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
18	Q. Okay. Now, you have known Mr. Acosta, who is
19	the counsel who asked questions of you on direct
20	examination, for several years, correct?
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. You've known Mr. Acosta for more than six
23	years, right?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. You met him back in 2002, did you not?
0191
1	A. That's right.
2	Q. And as of today, you've testified in cases in
3	which Mr. Acosta has been the lawyer for the plaintiff,
4	a plaintiff who has filed a lawsuit against one or more
5	of the cigarette companies, on more than six occasions,
6	correct?
7	A. That sounds about right, yes.
8	Q. Okay. And in each of the cases in which you
9	have testified for a plaintiff in the past, you charge a
10	fee for your services, do you not?
11	A. That's right.
12	Q. Today you are charging $400 per hour for your
13	testimony?
14	A. That's correct.
15	Q. And if the day takes six or seven hours or
16	more, you will charge at least a flat fee of $3,200 per
17	day; is that right?
18	A. For the day, yes.
19	Q. Okay. And did you arrive -- we're here in
20	Tampa, correct?
21	A. Yes, we are in Tampa.
22	Q. And you arrived here yesterday?
23	A. I actually came in Saturday evening.
24	Q. You came in Saturday evening. And you met and
25	prepared with Mr. Acosta yesterday?
0192
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. And how many other attorneys were present
3	during the meeting you had yesterday?
4	A. Me and Howard.
5	Q. Did Mr. Schultz, another lawyer who has filed
6	lawsuits against tobacco companies, did he participate
7	in that meeting?
8	A. He came late in the evening, and no, he played
9	no role in our preparations.
10	Q. But you will charge $3,200 for the time spent
11	yesterday, correct?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. You will charge $3,200 for time you spend
14	today, right?
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. And you are going to spend -- assuming we go
17	into tomorrow and spend some time tomorrow, you will
18	charge another $3,200 for your time tomorrow; is that
19	right?
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. And that's in addition to the $5,000 you have
22	already been paid by Mr. Schultz for reviewing records
23	and being prepared to give your deposition which you
24	gave, a discovery deposition which you gave back in
25	November; is that right?
0193
1	A. That's right. That was for earlier time spent
2	working.
3	Q. And that $400 per hour rate is the same, you
4	charge that same rate whether it's preparation work,
5	conversation with plaintiffs lawyers, gathering
6	materials, testifying in deposition or testifying in a
7	trial, correct?
8	A. That's right. My practice has not to --
9	been not to charge for research, so I charge for things
10	related to -- directly related to litigation and
11	testimony.
12	Q. When you say you don't charge for your
13	research, there was a point in time when you did charge
14	for your research, did you not?
15	A. Only at the very beginning when I was asked by
16	a guy name Jerry Schultze to review a large amount of
17	defense documents in a case called Boemer versus Brown
18	& Williamson.
19	Q. Okay. Let's go over your billing procedures a
20	little bit. When you first started working, as you just
21	told me, on behalf of plaintiffs in tobacco cases, you
22	were charging $100 per hour for research, correct?
23	A. That's right. That's what I just referred to,
24	that -- the case that I just referred to.
25	Q. And then there was a period of time when you
0194
1	actually were charging $500 an hour or $5,000 a day for
2	testimony at a deposition or in a courtroom, correct?
3	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
4	THE WITNESS: That's correct. And then I
5	lowered it at the request of one of your
6	colleagues.
7	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
8	Q. Right. Because counsel in another case
9	complained that you were charging too much money per
10	hour for your qualifications and credentials, correct?
11	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
12	THE WITNESS: Well, he complained that it was
13	too much, so I --1 rethought that decision and
14	thought, Well, you know, maybe I'll lower that.
15	And I did.
16	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
17	Q. Okay. And then so now you are charging $400
18	per hour; is that right?
19	A. That's right. I lowered it to $375 and kept
20	it there for a considerable period of time, and have
21	recently raised it in the last -- in the last year.
22	Q. And as you sit here today in January 2009,
23	over the last -- if we were to go back over the last
24	six, seven, eight years, you've made in excess of
25	$200,000 testifying on behalf of plaintiffs in tobacco
0195
1	litigation. Isn't that right?
2	A. Well, that would include -- yeah, that's about
3	right.
4	Q. As we sit here today --
5	A. Yeah, that's correct.
6	Q. — and the amount of money that you are going
7	to make for three days that you spend here in Tampa,
8	you'll have earned over $200,000 over the last seven or
9	eight years, correct?
10	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
11	THE WITNESS: That's correct, yes.
12	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
13	Q. And I think as you told --1 believe you said
14	this in response to a question from Mr. Acosta, but over
15	the last -- if we were to go back over the last six or
16	seven or eight years, about 30 percent of your annual
17	income is derived directly from money you earned
18	testifying on behalf of plaintiffs in tobacco
19	litigation, correct?
20	A. That's about right. Yeah. That's what I told
21	Mr. Acosta.
22	Q. Now, in addition, we talked about --1 showed
23	you the chart that showed the number of cases and the
24	names of the cases in which you had testified in either
25	a deposition or a trial. Do you recall this document?
0196
1	Right?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And you know that in addition to this
4	testimony, you have been disclosed as an expert witness
5	on behalf of more than 70 or 80 plaintiffs who've filed
6	lawsuits here in the State of Florida, correct?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. Okay. And you have been retained by several
9	lawyers, in addition to Mr. Acosta, who've filed
10	lawsuits against tobacco companies; is that right?
11	A. That's correct.
12	Q. And several of them were in the room here
13	today and are still in the room, right?
14	A. One of them is.
15	Q. Okay. Well, you have been retained by Matt
16	Schultz, who is a lawyer who has file lawsuits against
17	tobacco companies, right?
18	A. That's correct.
19	Q. You have been retained by Todd McFarland. He
20	is another lawyer who has filed lawsuits against tobacco
21	companies, correct?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. You have also been retained by Mr. Gary Page,
24	who has also filed lawsuits against tobacco companies,
25	correct?
0197
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. And these lawyers, in addition to Mr. Acosta,
3	have disclosed you in the cases they filed as someone
4	who will testify as an expert on behalf of the plaintiff
5	in those cases, correct?
6	A. At the -- yes. At the request of these
7	plaintiffs attorneys, I have agreed to testify on
8	issues relating to the conduct of your client.
9	Q. Right. And you expect then that you will
10	continue to have work testifying against the companies
11	who are defendants in this case in the future, do you
12	not?
13	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
14	THE WITNESS: Well, I have been asked -- when
15	you say future, you mean the immediate future?
16	What -- what's your definition of future here? I'm
17	not sure what you are talking about.
18	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
19	Q. Well, don't you plan on testifying in about a
20	week or two in a case that Mr. Page has in Ft.
21	Lauderdale, Florida?
22	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
23	THE WITNESS: Yeah. That's what I am
24	referring to. Yes. I have been asked to testify
25	next week in a case.
0198
1	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
2	Q. And you know that Mr. Schultz has other cases
3	that may be set for trial in the future, right?
4	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
5	THE WITNESS: Yes. They may or may not. You
6	know, my experience has been that, you know, people
7	will disclose me on things and I never hear from
8	them. So --
9	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
10	Q. Right. But you agreed to be retained by these
11	lawyers with the expectation that one or more of their
12	cases may require you to be deposed and to actually
13	testify in a trial, right?
14	A. Yes. If the process gets that far, yes,
15	absolutely.
16	Q. And you expect to be compensated each time you
17	do that at the rate of $400 a day or 3,200 -- excuse
18	me -- $4,000 an hour or $3,200 per day, correct?
19	MR. ACOSTA: Excuse me. I think you misstated
20	there. I object to form.
21	MR. GERAGHTY: I'll rephrase the question.
22	What did I say?
23	MR. ACOSTA: $4,000 an hour.
24	THE WITNESS: That's okay.
25	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
0199
1	Q. Let me rephrase the question. And you expect
2	that if you sit at a deposition or testify at trial in
3	one of those cases, that you will be paid $400 an hour
4	or the equivalent of $3,200 per day, correct?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. And you are actually, are you not, looking to
7	do additional work as an expert witness in the future,
8	right?
9	A. What do you mean by looking?
10	Q. Well, aren't you interested in finding out
11	about lawsuits that are filed against tobacco companies?
12	A. People call me and ask me to testify. I
13	explain to them the content of my testimony and my
14	opinions, and if they want to retain me, they are free
15	to do so.
16	Q. Well, that's not really what I was referring
17	to. What I mean is isn't it true that you are actually,
18	on your own, on your computer at home, looking at
19	whether lawsuits get filed against tobacco companies?
20	A. I keep up with tobacco litigation as a news
21	item.
22	Q. You -- you gave a deposition in this case back
23	in November, right?
24	A. That's right.
25	Q. And you told me at that time that you set up
0200
1	your computer -- you went onto Google, correct?
2	A. That's correct.
3	Q. — website, and Google has a feature called
4	Google Alert, correct?
5	A. Google News Alert.
6	Q. Google News Alert. And you can receive any
7	news alert for any key words that you are interested in.
8	Is that not right?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. And you told me back in November that you
11	would set your computer with the key words "tobacco
12	litigation" so that any time Google picked up a news
13	alert or a story that talked about a lawsuit against
14	tobacco companies, you would be alerted to it on your
15	personal home computer, correct?
16	A. That's correct. But the reason why I do that
17	is not the one that you've represented in the question.
18	You never did ask me why I did it.
19	Q. Doctor, I think I did ask you why you did that
20	in your deposition.
21	A. I do it because I keep up on litigation. Not
22	because it affects me personally, but I keep up on
23	litigation against the tobacco industry because it's a
24	global phenomena that --1 see it as an extension of
25	public health activism to people who are involved in
0201
1	that. And it's a newsworthy item that I am involved in.
2	Q. Okay. Well, you have previously said, for
3	example, that your specialty is the public's
4	understanding of the health risks of tobacco, right?
5	A. I have been asked to testify on that, yes,
6	many times.
7	Q. And your, for example, your Google Alert isn't
8	"public awareness tobacco", "public awareness of
9	cigarettes", is it?
10	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
11	THE WITNESS: No, although my -- my key word
12	search in the NCI documents -- public health
13	database is set up for that.
14	MR. ACOSTA: I need to also object that it's
15	beyond the course of -- it's beyond the scope of
16	direct.
17	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
18	Q. Okay. Dr. Kyriakoudes, isn't it true that you
19	have set up your computer to get a Google News Alert
20	about tobacco litigation at least in part because you
21	are interested in finding out whether lawsuits get filed
22	against tobacco companies because you are interested in
23	serving as an expert witness in those cases? Yes or no.
24	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
25	THE WITNESS: No, that's not why I have it set 0202
1	up.
2	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
3	Q. Now, you also have Google News Alerts for
4	Philip Morris, right?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. And for R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. Because you want to, as you said, monitor the
9	actions of the industry; is that correct?
10	A. Yes. I'm interested in what your clients do.
11	Q. All right. Now, Doctor, let's talk a little
12	bit about how you originally got involved in litigation
13	against the tobacco companies. You obtained your Ph.D.
14	back in 1997; is that correct?
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. Your Ph.D. in history?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. And then within a few months thereafter you
19	were contacted by a plaintiffs lawyer from Louisiana
20	named Louis Fondren, correct?
21	A. Well, he's not from Louisiana.
22	Q. I'm sorry. Where is he from?
23	A. Paskagoula, Mississippi.
24	Q. I'm sorry.
25	A. That's all right.
0203
1	Q. But within a few months of obtaining your
2	Ph.D. in history, you were contacted by Mr. Louis
3	Fondren, right?
4	A. Yeah. After I moved to Mississippi to take my
5	position at Southern Mississippi.
6	Q. You had only obtained your Ph.D. within a few
7	months after he first contacted you. Isn't that right?
8	A. That's right.
9	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form. Asked and
10	answered.
11	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
12	Q. And Louis Fondren at that time was an attorney
13	who was filing lawsuits against tobacco companies.
14	Isn't that right?
15	A. He was. And he was interested in talking to
16	me about that.
17	Q. And, in fact, not only was he interested in
18	talking to you about it, but at that time he gave you a
19	bunch of documents, did he not?
20	A. He gave me the Minnesota Blue Cross/Blue
21	Shield versus Philip Morris, et al, trial exhibits in a
22	big box.
23	Q. Okay. Just so the jury understands what you
24	are referring to, what he gave you was a set of exhibits
25	that had been used by a plaintiff in another lawsuit
0204
1	that had been filed in Minnesota; is that right?
2	A. That's right. The Blue Cross -- excuse me.
3	Blue Cross/Blue Shield Health System in Minnesota.
4	Q. All right. Now, we mentioned it just a few
5	moments ago, but the very first time you ever testified
6	in a case in which you discussed cigarette smoking,
7	tobacco and health, the conduct of the companies who are
8	defendants in this case, was in a case called Boemer,
9	B-O-E-R-N-E-R, correct?
10	A. (Indicating affirmatively).
11	Q. That was a case -- you have to say yes or no.
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. You nodded your head.
14	A. Yes. Correct.
15	Q. You gave a deposition in the Boemer case back
16	in 2000. Isn't that right?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. And you testified in that case and in your
19	deposition to a number of the same things you talked to,
20	with Mr. Acosta here today. Isn't that right?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Okay. And as you said just a moment ago, your
23	opinions haven't changed on that subject since you gave
24	that deposition back in 2000, right?
25	MR. ACOSTA: Object to fomi.
0205
1	THE WITNESS: Well, you know, when you --1
2	mean, I know -- you know, I'm constantly doing
3	research. I know significantly more. I have
4	branched out. So when you say opinions, be a
5	little bit more specific. Like read an opinion and
6	I'll tell you if it's changed or not.
7	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
8	Q. Well, is your opinion about what you said
9	earlier, that the tobacco companies knew about the
10	health risks of smoking and didn't disclose it to the
11	public, did that change? That's what you said on direct
12	here today, right?
13	A. No, no. That hasn't changed. I just want to
14	be precise, because I'm not exactly -- you know, opinion
15	is a broad term, and I have --1 hold many opinions or
16	views about -- about the subject.
17	Q. Doctor, you know what it means when in
18	litigation somebody asks you what your opinion is,
19	right?
20	A. That's right.
21	Q. You have been asked to give your opinions in
22	11 trials, have you not?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. Okay. Plaintiffs lawyers disclose your
25	quote/unquote opinions in writing to the other side do
0206
1	they not?
2	A. They do.
3	Q. Okay. That's a term you understand, correct?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Because you have been involved in litigation
6	for eight or nine years now, right?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. Your opinions on that subject have not changed
9	since you gave that deposition back in February of 2000,
10	right? That's all I was asking.
11	MR. ACOSTA: Object. Object to form. Move to
12	strike.
13	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
14	Q. I will rephrase the question. Doctor, my
15	question is, very simply, your opinion on that issue has
16	not changed since you gave your deposition in the
17	Boemer case back in February of 2000, right?
18	A. No, it's not changed.
19	Q. Now --
20	A. Although my testimony in the Boemer
21	deposition didn't focus on that issue that you just
22	described. So I --1 cannot recall if I actually
23	testified on that specific issue, if I was asked about
24	that in the Boemer case.
25	Q. Doctor, you don't remember whether in the
0207
1	Boemer case you actually addressed whether you believed
2	the tobacco companies were aware of -- that smoking
3	caused disease and did not say that to the public?
4	MR. ACOSTA: I'm going to object and insist
5	that you show him his deposition or the testimony
6	from the Boemer that you are asking about. He is
7	entitled to look at it and read and understand it
8	before he answers your questions.
9	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
10	Q. Okay. Doctor, can you answer my question? Do
11	you recall or do you not recall?
12	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
13	THE WITNESS: My recollection of the Boemer
14	deposition is that was my first deposition, and to
15	be honest with you, my recollection is the main
16	thrust of the questions that the attorney was
17	asking me concerned strictly public awareness
18	issues.
19	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
20	Q. Doctor, I'm not asking you what the main
21	thmst of your opinion was in the Boerner case.
22	A. Yeah.
23	Q. My question is very simple. My question is
24	did you not offer an opinion about the same subject you
25	addressed here today during your direct examination with
0208
1	Mr. Acosta? Wasn't that one of the things that you
2	talked about in the Boemer case?
3	MR. ACOSTA: Object to fomi, move to strike.
4	THE WITNESS: And I'm telling you, I can't
5	exactly remember if I -- if that issue came up in
6	that particular deposition. If -- if you've got
7	it, let me remind myself of it, and I'll happily
8	refresh my memory. But it was eight years ago.
9	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
10	Q. I'll be happy to bring it out and we'll go
11	over it with you. Now, Doctor --
12	MR. ACOSTA: Move to strike.
13	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
14	Q. Doctor, in fomiing your opinions in the
15	Boemer case, isn't it tme that you did no original
16	research of your own?
17	A. In that case I --1 had done some original
18	research on my own, but most of the research was done
19	through a review of the defense documents that had been
20	supplied over the course of that trial.
21	Q. Okay. Let's be clear. The plaintiff s lawyer
22	who hired you in the Boemer case, he handed you a set
23	of materials did he not?
24	MR. ACOSTA: Object to fomi. Move to strike.
25	THE WITNESS: Yes, he -
0209
1	MR. GERAGHTY: What's the basis?
2	MR. ACOSTA: Let's be clear. That's not a
3	question.
4	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
5	Q. Doctor, did the plaintiffs lawyer who hired
6	you in the Boerner case give you a set of materials?
7	A. He did.
8	Q. A set of documents, correct?
9	A. Yes, documents, photocopies.
10	Q. There were newspaper articles, right?
11	A. Newspaper articles.
12	Q. There were magazine articles, right?
13	A. Magazines, yes.
14	Q. There were tobacco industry documents, were
15	there not?
16	A. No, not -- not in that.
17	Q. Let me -- okay. Let me be clear then. The
18	tobacco industry documents you had been provided were
19	provided to you earlier by Louis Fondren, correct?
20	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form. Move to strike.
21	THE WITNESS: That's true. There were tobacco
22	industry documents in the -- in the set that I
23	received from Fondren.
24	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
25	Q. The lawyer, you mentioned his name earlier.
0210
1	What's the name of the lawyer who hired you in Boemer
2	case?
3	A. Jerry Schultze. S-C-H-U-L-T-Z-E.
4	Q. Okay. Mr. Schultze, the documents he gave you
5	was not your own research, was it?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. Okay. Those were documents that had been
8	collected by an expert who had actually been retained by
9	the defense, correct?
10	A. That's correct.
11	Q. Okay. And you reviewed those documents, did
12	you not?
13	A. I did.
14	Q. Okay. And Mr. Schultze hired you on January
15	the 15th of 2000, right?
16	A. That sounds about right, yeah.
17	Q. He gave you -- was it how many boxes of
18	materials? Do you recall?
19	A. It was--1 don't remember the exact number of
20	boxes, but it was, you know, more than two. Maybe two
21	or three.
22	Q. Two or three. Two or three boxes worth of
23	materials, none of which was your original research,
24	correct?
25	A. That's correct.
0211
1	MR. ACOSTA: Object to fomi.
2	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
3	Q. And when he hired you, the defense historian
4	in that case, the expert for the defendant, had already
5	been deposed, right?
6	A. I guess so. Yeah. I guess that's how he got
7	the documents.
8	Q. That's how he got the documents, right?
9	A. Yeah.
10	Q. And he provided you those documents --
11	MR. ACOSTA: I need to move to strike his
12	answer.
13	MR. GERAGHTY: You are moving to strike your
14	own witness's answer?
15	MR. ACOSTA: Yeah.
16	MR. GERAGHTY: As what? Untruthful?
17	MR. ACOSTA: No.
18	MR. GERAGHTY: What's the basis?
19	MR. ACOSTA: He was guessing.
20	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
21	Q. All right. Mr. Schultze hired you on January
22	the 15th, 2000, correct?
23	A. Correct.
24	Q. And he gave you two, maybe three boxes of
25	materials that had been collected and gathered by the
0212
1	expert for the defendant, right?
2	A. That's correct.
3	Q. Okay. You spent 30 hours reviewing those
4	materials, correct?
5	A. I did.
6	Q. And you testified in your deposition on
7	February the 1st to essentially many of the same things
8	you said to Mr. Acosta here today, right?
9	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form. Again, I insist
10	that you show him this transcript.
11	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
12	Q. Can you answer the question, Doctor?
13	A. I'll refer to my prior answer on that one.
14	Q. I'm sorry. I don't know what -- your prior
15	answer?
16	A. When you asked me earlier what I testified at
17	that first deposition, my recollection is that most of
18	the questions, nearly all of them concerned public
19	awareness and public understanding and common knowledge
20	and those related issues. And so that -- that was the
21	content of that testimony.
22	Q. Doctor, at the very beginning of this
23	discussion you told me you were fairly certain that you
24	had addressed the conduct of the tobacco companies and
25	whether they were aware of the health risks of cigarette
0213
1	smoking during the course of your testimony in that
2	Boemer deposition. Is that tme or is that not tme?
3	A. I'm telling you that I've not read that
4	deposition transcript in a very, very long time. And it
5	was eight years ago. And I -- without refreshing my
6	recollection, I just can't give you a complete,
7	honest -- or I'm sorry, a complete and effective answer
8	as to what the nature of the questions that I was asked
9	at that deposition. It was a very long time ago.
10	Q. All right. We'll pull it out maybe tomorrow
11	and I'll- we'll go over that.
12	MR. ACOSTA: Move to strike.
13	THE WITNESS: Yeah. I'm not trying to be
14	obstructionist^. Really, I'm not. I know you've
15	got to get through your list, and I want you to do
16	that.
17	MR. GERAGHTY: There is no question pending.
18	MR. ACOSTA: Move to strike.
19	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
20	Q. Let me ask a question. At the time you gave
21	your deposition in the Boemer case in February of 2000,
22	you had not done your own original research on many of
23	the issues that you testified to in that deposition.
24	Isn't that tme, doctor?
25	MR. ACOSTA: Object to fomi. I think he's
0214
1	answered that a half a dozen times.
2	MR. GERAGHTY: That question has not been
3	asked.
4	MR. ACOSTA: I think so.
5	THE WITNESS: I - I had reviewed the
6	documents that we've discussed so far in this line
7	of questioning. I had reviewed other materials.
8	For example, the cigarette papers and the secondary
9	literature. So that's the research I had done.
10	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
11	Q. But you had not, at the time you gave that
12	deposition in February of 2000, done any of your own
13	original research of any primary sources, correct?
14	MR. ACOSTA: Object to fomi.
15	THE WITNESS: Outside of what we've just
16	talked about, no.
17	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
18	Q. And what we've talked about was you had been
19	given a set of exhibits from a trial by a plaintiffs
20	attorney selected by that plaintiffs attorney, correct?
21	MR. ACOSTA: Object to fomi.
22	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
23	Q. Mr. Fondren?
24	A. Well, I don't know if he selected them. I
25	think probably the attorneys in Blue Cross/Blue Shield
0215
1	versus Philip Morris had chosen them. But yes, they
2	nonetheless were trial documents.
3	Q. They were lawyers who had filed a lawsuit
4	against Philip Morris and other tobacco companies,
5	right?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. You personally did not select them.
8	A. I did not select them.
9	Q. And the same is tme with the set of materials
10	that had been given to you by the other plaintiffs'
11	lawyer, Mr. Schultze, right? You did not select those
12	documents, did you?
13	A. No. Those were selected by the defense
14	expert.
15	Q. So when you first gave an opinion on issues
16	related to the issues in this particular case, you
17	relied primarily upon materials that had been selected
18	by plaintiffs lawyers, correct?
19	A. Well, I also relied --1 did review the
20	secondary literature on the subject and read in those
21	areas. So I did do a review of secondary literature
22	on -- on this issue.
23	Q. Doctor, my question is at the time you gave
24	that deposition in February of 2000 and first offered an
25	opinion on many of the subjects you have discussed here
0216
1	today, you were relying primarily upon materials that
2	had been selected by plaintiffs lawyers. Isn't that
3	true?
4	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
5	THE WITNESS: I did --1 did rely on materials
6	at my first deposition, materials provided to me by
7	plaintiffs attorneys, yes.
8	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
9	Q. That's not original research, is it?
10	A. Well, it was a review of those documents.
11	Q. Okay. But it wasn't original research because
12	you didn't conduct it, correct? That's what original
13	research means.
14	A. No. It was research into those documents that
15	I was asked to review.
16	Q. You know what original research means, right?
17	A. Yes. I didn't --1 reviewed those documents,
18	yeah.
19	Q. You are a historian. You know what original
20	research means, correct? Yes or no.
21	A. Yes, I know what it means.
22	Q. Okay. And at the time you gave that
23	deposition, you had not done original research, right?
24	A. I had reviewed those documents. I had done
25	other research in secondary literature and other
0217
1	materials. So no, I had done -- yes, I had done some
2	original research, but also had reviewed a large amount
3	of material provided by plaintiffs attorneys.
4	Q. But no original research of any primary
5	sources. Isn't that right?
6	A. Outside of reviewing the primary sources
7	supplied as we've discussed, no.
8	Q. And what you had was not what you would
9	characterize or any historian would characterize as
10	unbiased or neutral research, correct?
11	A. My opinion was -- was unbiased and neutral.
12	Q. Well, it was based on materials that had been
13	picked by two plaintiffs counsel, right?
14	A. Well, actually, some of it -- half of it was
15	picked by the defense historian in the Boemer case.
16	So, you know --
17	Q. And you knew when Mr. Schultze hired you that
18	he wanted you to say -- to offer an opinion that was the
19	opposite of what the defense historian said, right?
20	MR. ACOSTA: Object to fomi.
21	THE WITNESS: Well -
22	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
23	Q. Yes or no, Doctor.
24	MR. ACOSTA: Object to fomi.
25	THE WITNESS: I explained to Mr. Schultze
0218
1	that -- my position, and he asked me to review the
2	documents. And I said, Send me all the documents
3	that the defense historian had supplied you and
4	I'll review them.
5	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
6	Q. Right. And so when he called you, before he
7	sent you any of the materials, he told you that he was
8	looking for a historian who would give an opinion
9	contrary to the one that had been given by the defendant
10	historian in the case. You knew that, right?
11	A. Yes. I told them that my opinions on the
12	subject were consistent with the literature on health
13	communication and, you know, in the -- consistent with
14	the Surgeon General's report in 1989 on public
15	understanding of the risks of smoking. And so that was
16	the position I was coming from.
17	Q. He told you what opinion he wanted from the
18	historian he was going to hire in that case, right?
19	A. I told him my view on the subject.
20	Q. Doctor, now, besides --
21	A. Then he asked me to review documents. Sol--
22	just to be complete.
23	Q. Okay. So you told him what your opinion was
24	before you had really done virtually any research other
25	than review of the materials that Mr. Fondren gave you
0219
1	from the Minnesota lawsuit you talked about earlier,
2	right?
3	A. Well, I had reviewed some of the later Surgeon
4	General reports. I had looked at the secondary
5	literature on this. I had looked at material in -- by
6	scholars like Ken Warner and Ronald Davis on this issue.
7	So I had reviewed the secondary literature as well.
8	Q. And when you say secondary literature, that's
9	a temi of art for a historian, is it not?
10	A. Yeah. That means peer reviewed studies in --
11	in journals.
12	Q. But that's not -- you referred several times,
13	maybe a half dozen times with Mr. Acosta to having
14	reviewed primary sources, right?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. Okay. At the time you were hired by
17	Mr. Schultze in January of 2000 and told him what your
18	opinion was, you hadn't done any research on any primary
19	sources, correct?
20	A. Well, I had reviewed the documents we've
21	talked about.
22	Q. Other -- right. The only primary research you
23	had done was the documents that had been provided to you
24	by Mr. Fondren, right?
25	A. Yes. But that's a significant amount of
0220
1	material.
2	Q. Okay. A significant amount of material that
3	was selected by a plaintiffs lawyer to give to you just
4	a few months after you had graduated and obtained your
5	Ph.D. in history, right?
6	A. That's true. I was a new Ph.D.
7	Q. Okay. Now, Doctor, let's -- in addition to
8	testifying in cases against tobacco companies, you have
9	also given a presentation at a meeting for plaintiffs
10	lawyers who file lawsuits against tobacco companies,
11	haven't you?
12	A. I was invited to give a talk at the
13	Northeastern University School of Law. That's correct.
14	Q. Okay. You have given a presentation at a
15	meeting for plaintiffs lawyers who file lawsuits
16	against tobacco companies. Yes or no.
17	A. Well, there were people from the public health
18	community there as well. Plenty of non-lawyers.
19	Q. Doctor, my question simply is you gave a
20	presentation at a meeting at which plaintiffs lawyers
21	attended, and those plaintiffs lawyers file lawsuits
22	against tobacco companies. Yes or no?
23	A. That -- no, I'll answer yes to that question.
24	Yes.
25	Q. And the presentation was at a conference which
0221
1	was called the 20th Conference of the Tobacco Products
2	Liability Project, right?
3	A. That's correct.
4	(Defendant's Exhibit 3, Documents regarding
5	the 20th Conference of the Tobacco Products
6	Liability Project, was marked for identification.)
7	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
8	Q. What we are going to mark as Defendant's
9	Exhibit Number 3 I'm going to show here on the screen.
10	You have seen this document before, right, doctor?
11	A. Yes, I have.
12	Q. This is the -- the registration form for the
13	conference, correct? I'll show you. It's on the last
14	page.
15	A. It looks like it's from the web, yeah. I
16	mean, with the outline of the speakers and stuff like
17	that. Yeah, I've seen that.
18	Q. This document explains what the purpose of the
19	conference is and how you go about registering to
20	attend. Isn't that right?
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. And the conference was titled Learning From
23	Wins and Losses, right?
24	A. That's correct.
25	Q. And Learning From Wins and Losses is
0222
1	specifically referring to learning from wins and losses
2	in a courtroom, right?
3	A. That's correct.
4	Q. Okay. And they are talking about wins and
5	losses in lawsuits filed by plaintiffs lawyers against
6	tobacco companies, correct?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. Before juries like the jury who is going to
9	watch this videotape in this case, right?
10	A. That's correct.
11	Q. You know that the purpose of the conference
12	was to encourage lawsuits against tobacco companies,
13	correct?
14	A. That's true.
15	Q. And let's take a look. You made a reference
16	to it, but if you go down to where I'm reading, it
17	says -- let me just give you a copy.
18	A. Yeah. That's not very well focused.
19	Q. Yeah. It's hard to read.
20	A. Yeah. I can see this just fine.
21	Q. The document, if you look at that time where
22	I'm indicating on the ELMO, it says, This conference
23	will bring together leading plaintiffs attorneys,
24	experts and public health advocates, correct?
25	A. Correct.
0223
1	Q. Okay. So there were plaintiffs lawyers in
2	attendance, right?
3	A. That's correct.
4	Q. There were people who are -- who serve as
5	experts witnesses in lawsuits like yourself, right?
6	A. Well, I was there. Yeah.
7	Q. And you knew there were other people who serve
8	as experts in lawsuits against tobacco companies there
9	as well, right?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. Okay.
12	A. I didn't get to meet very many people, but I'm
13	sure they were there.
14	Q. All right. And you mentioned --it also makes
15	reference to the fact, as you said, that there were
16	public health advocates in attendance as well, right?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. And you know that Mr. Acosta was a sponsor of
19	that program, correct? I can show you. If we go to --
20	A. I see it on the next page.
21	Q. If you turn to page 2, there were several
22	sponsors of the program?
23	A. I see that, yes.
24	Q. Correct? Howard Acosta, who asked you
25	questions on direct examination, was listed as a silver
0224
1	level sponsor of the program, right?
2	A. I see that.
3	Q. In addition, if you look above to the gold
4	level sponsors, one of them is Woody Wilner, right? You
5	know Mr. Wilner?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Mr. Wilner is a lawyer who has filed lawsuits
8	against tobacco companies, correct?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. And you have testified at a trial for
11	Mr. Wilner, have you not?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. And you have known Mr. Wilner for as long as
14	you have known Mr. Acosta. Isn't that correct?
15	A. I think I met him on the same day.
16	Q. Okay. Let's flip back to the first page for a
17	moment. Well, before we do that, you have also been
18	hired by one of the other lawyers who is been listed
19	here as a gold level sponsor, Michael DuPuis, correct?
20	Michael DuPuis. Excuse me.
21	A. Yes. I was deposed in a case. I never
22	testified.
23	Q. He retained you as an expert witness, did he
24	not?
25	A. He did.
0225
1	Q. And you gave a deposition in his case, right?
2	A. I did.
3	Q. And for whatever reason, unbeknownst to you,
4	you never actually testified in the trial, right?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. If we go back to the first page, if you look
7	under the part in the middle that begins with "this
8	conference" where we had read previously, do you see
9	where it says "the agenda will include"?
10	A. Yes, I see it.
11	Q. It says, The agenda will include keys for
12	winning cases, right?
13	A. That's what it says.
14	Q. And that's keys your winning cases filed
15	against tobacco companies, correct?
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. Right below that it says, Updates on the
18	newest litigation strategies, right?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Litigation is a reference to lawsuits, is it
21	not?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. So they were going to talk about strategies
24	for the latest litigation -- or excuse me -- updates on
25	the latest litigation strategies against cigarette
0226
1	companies, correct?
2	A. That's correct.
3	Q. And then right below that it says, The use --
4	I think it should be, The use of experts and evidence to
5	create the best advantages, right?
6	A. Yes. Good catching of a typo.
7	Q. And you would be one of those experts. Isn't
8	that correct?
9	A. I'm an expert, yes.
10	Q. And so one of the subjects of the seminar or
11	the conference was to talk about how best to use experts
12	like yourself to gain an advantage in the courtroom.
13	Isn't that right?
14	A. That I don't know, because I didn't attend any
15	of the seminars, save for my presentation.
16	Q. Well, Doctor, but you do know that because it
17	says so right here on the document we have been talking
18	about.
19	A. That's right.
20	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
21	THE WITNESS: But I couldn't tell you what
22	they actually talked about at that seminar because
23	I didn't attend.
24	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
25	Q. All right. You didn't attend that part of the
0227
1	meeting, but you know that a part of the meeting was
2	devoted to plaintiffs lawyers sharing how best to use
3	experts like yourself to gain advantages in the
4	courtroom. Isn't that right?
5	A. That's what it says.
6	Q. Okay. And you know that there were a bunch of
7	plaintiffs lawyers who attended the seminar, correct?
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. Now, in order to attend this seminar you had
10	to sign an affidavit, did you not?
11	A. That's correct.
12	Q. And the affidavit required you -- hang on one
13	second here.
14	A. I can help you out on that if you want me --
15	Q. No. I've just --1 got my documents mixed up
16	here. Hang on one second. I've got it. I'm sorry.
17	And conference participants like yourself had
18	to sign an affidavit that said they would not do any
19	work for a tobacco company. Isn't that correct? For
20	the tobacco industry?
21	A. Something like that. I don't remember the
22	exact language. Basic --1 thought that what it said
23	was that you wouldn't agree to testify at the request of
24	a tobacco company in ongoing litigation to a certain
25	date.
0228
1	Q. Let me -- I'll just --1 only have one copy.
2	I apologize. Hopefully I'll just try to blow up this
3	top portion so you can read it a little bit better. Can
4	you read that from there?
5	A. Yeah. I can read that.
6	Q. The top paragraph.
7	A. Yep.
8	Q. Okay. This is -- this is a copy of the
9	affidavit you signed?
10	A. That's right.
11	Q. Okay. And if you read at the top, it says, I
12	understand that the 20th Conference of the Tobacco
13	Products Liability Project, Learning From Wins and
14	Losses, is intended to encourage and support litigation
15	against the tobacco industry, and that information
16	acquired at this conference is to be considered
17	confidential in keeping with these interests.
18	Did I read this correctly?
19	A. You read it correctly.
20	Q. And in order to attend and participate at this
21	conference, you had to sign this affidavit, correct?
22	A. That's right. Ongoing litigation such as the
23	racketeering trial against your client were discussed at
24	this conference.
25	Q. Doctor, I thought you didn't attend any of the
0229
1	presentations about what the lawyers were talking about.
2	A. I didn't, but that was also something that was
3	discussed.
4	Q. Okay. You are referring to a lawsuit that was
5	filed against the cigarette manufacturers, correct?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. Okay. So another piece of litigation, right?
8	A. Filed by the federal government.
9	Q. Lawyers filed a lawsuit against the cigarette
10	manufacturers. They were also in attendance at this
11	meeting, right?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Now, we talked a little bit about Mr. Wilner
14	who had hired you in a case earlier, right?
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. Okay. And you know that Mr. Wilner gave a
17	presentation, right?
18	A. He -- yes, he was on the schedule of speakers.
19	MR. GERAGHTY: I don't actually have the next
20	document, so I'm going to suggest we break right
21	now and pick up at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.
