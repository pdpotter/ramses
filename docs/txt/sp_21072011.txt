It's a hyphenated name.
And have you given depositions in any of those

No.
As of today, approximately how much money have
19 you been paid by Shook, Hardy & Bacon for the work that

Sure.
You can still answer the question.
You know

5 reason, the lawyers there thought that the question was
6 vague or something was wrong with it.
I think you understood the question, though,

Unless they instruct you not to

I understood.
You're asking me about what

12 total figure for the time I've been working on this
13 subject and researching it, or just in this case?

15
Q
And are you asking for a
No, the total figure for now, since you've
started working for Shook, Hardy & Bacon until today.
16 MS. MILLNER: Object to the form.
17 THE WITNESS: I began to do research on this
18 subject matter back in 1994, '95, and since that time,
19 I've earned approximately $268,000, which works out to
20 be 15- or $16,000 a year.

Dr. Hoff, with all due respect, things will be

Things will go quicker today
Prior to 1994, '95, you hadn't done any
5 research or investigated the question of the public's
6 awareness of the health hazards of smoking, had you?

10
And the research that you started in 1994,
Hardy & Bacon, correct?
A

I had not.

14
That's correct.
It was at the request of whom?
Lawyers from Shook, Hardy & Bacon.
Lawyers.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I didn't hear the
word.
Q
And you have not done any research into the
16 question of the public's awareness of the health hazards
17 of smoking unrelated to your work for Shook, Hardy &
18 Bacon, have you?
19 MS. BROWN:
20 THE WITNESS:

Again, unrelated to the research

19 can read me off the names of the witnesses in those
20 depositions, okay?
21

All right.
To begin with, of course, there
22 would have been the decedent's first wife, Evelyn; his
23 second wife, Marvine; his brother, Frank; a sister named

25 of Marvine named Robbie, I'm forgetting the last name on

BY MR. GDANSKI:
Q
In other words -- let me just -- maybe I can
help save some time a little bit.
I know you've given depositions in cases just
4
5 like this, and I know that some of the issues that
6 you've discussed in the cases that you've been deposed
7 in have been very similar to the issues that you and I
8 are prepared to discuss in this case.
9 some of the materials that you rely upon are the same
10
And I know that
from, for example, the Tullo case and this case.
So what I want to know is what new research
11
12 you've done to prepare for this case, for the opinions
13 you're prepared to give in this case.
14
15
16
A
That is, you're asking for new research that
I've done.
This case required me to look at newspapers
17 that I had not looked at for Tullo, and those newspapers
18 were, of course, one in Hattiesburg, Mississippi,
19 another one in -- I looked at the Chicago Tribune
20 because the decedent had lived very briefly in Chicago.
21 Then I looked at the Melbourne Times because
22 he read it after he moved to Florida from Mississippi.
23
I then had to look at the Miami Herald because
24 it was referenced in the depositions that he had read
25 that newspaper as well.
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 19
1
And then finally I had to review research I'd
2 previously done and to add to the time period of
3 research for the Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel newspaper.
Q
4
Okay.
Thank you.
So, for example, on your reliance list, in the
5
6 folder "Books, Pamphlets, Posters and Reports," those
7 are all the same from prior cases, and you didn't do any
8 original new research into that type of material, did
9 you?
10
A
Under the "Books, Pamphlets and Posters,"
11 there was some new research on the American Cancer
12 Society and new research on the Florida Lung
13 Association.
14 listing there is information from the Florida Committee
15 on Smoking and Health.
16
17
18
Q
And not necessarily new, but in that
What new research did you do into the American
Cancer Society?
A
I looked more closely at their records with
19 respect to the kinds of information they were giving out
20 from the time period that I thought was relevant for
21 this particular case.
22
Q
What were the time periods that you thought
23 were relevant for this particular case from the American
24 Cancer Society?
25
A
Well, I looked at records going back to the
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 20
1 '60s simply because Johnny Calloway would have been
2 reading newspapers that might have -- that would have
3 contained information from the American Cancer Society.
4 He might have seen posters that they put out or ads for
5 the pamphlets they were putting out.
6 So I took a closer look at that simply because
7 the cancer society also began to pay more attention at a
8 certain point in time to getting information out to the
9 black community.
So I thought that I should investigate
10 that just simply to see what they were saying and how
11 they were approaching that issue.
12
Q
Okay.
Do you have any evidence in this case
13 to support the proposition that Johnny Calloway saw any
14 statement by the American Cancer Society in a pamphlet,
15 booklet or poster?
16 A
17 Q
No, I don't.
The Florida Lung Association, tell me what
18 additional new research you've done for purposes of this
19 case with regards to that organization.
20
A
The Florida Lung Association, I think
21 partially because of the fact that it was dealing with
22 and still does deal with an older population of
23 retirees, was concerned very early on with bronchitis,
24 chronic bronchitis and emphysema issues.
25
So it was quite active in terms of not only,

24 case on what diseases he suffered from, what caused
25 those diseases, or what caused his death, do you?

2 Q
No, I don't.
And did you do any research into the public's
3 awareness specifically of bladder cancer as it relates
4 to smoking cigarettes?
5
A
Only to the degree that it began to show up in
6 the Surgeon General's reports and in some newspaper
7 accounts of -- let's say for the beginning of the late
8 '70s going into the '80s.
Q
9
For example, did you go back to the New York
10 Times and type in "bladder cancer smoking" to see what
11 articles came up?
12 A
13 Q
No, I didn't in this case, no.
So any research that you have and any reliance
14 materials that you have that deal with the subject of
15 bladder cancer are there incidentally; you didn't search
16 for them specifically; is that right?
17 MS. BROWN:
18 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I didn't search for them
19 specifically, but in reading, as I said, either accounts
20 of the Surgeon General's reports or certain studies,
21 scientific studies that began to come out in the '70s
22 and '80s, bladder cancer was referenced.
23 also, of course, talked about in certain Reader's Digest
24 articles.

BY MR. GDANSKI:
Q
What's the earliest Reader's Digest article
3 you're familiar with that mentions bladder cancer as
4 being caused by smoking cigarettes?
5
A
Off the top of my head I don't recall which
6 one, but I think you could find a couple for the late
7 '70s and early '80s.
8
9
10
Q
Is there any evidence in this case at all that
Johnny Calloway ever read Reader's Digest?
A
No.
One of the -- or two of the depositions
11 indicated that it may have been in the home, but we
12 don't -- I don't know from that reference whether he
13 actually read it.
14 decided it was, again, worth reviewing.
15
Q
But because it was referenced, I
And so just so I understand what you said,
16 there's no evidence in this case that Johnny Calloway
17 ever read any edition of Reader's Digest, correct?
18 A Correct.
19 Q All right.
Moving on to the next folder on
20 your materials, I think it's called "Educational
21 Materials."
Did you do any new educational materials
22
23 research for purposes of this case and include any new
24 materials in your reliance list?
25
A
Yes, I had to, because he was educated in
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 24
1 Mississippi.
2 Q
So can you tell me what you did for purposes
3 of adding to your reliance materials and the development
4 of your opinions as it relates to educational materials?
5
A
Yes.
I had to look, of course, at what the
6 Mississippi State Board of Education was putting out in
7 terms of ideas and recommendations for how to teach
8 health classes in the state.
9 of material for the time period that was relevant for
So I looked at that kind
10 his education, which would have been in the '30s and
11 '40s.
12
Then I had to look at more local information
13 that would have been coming out of the -- partially out
14 of the state, but out of local educational councils,
15 when they would put out manuals, specifically indicating
16 textbooks and how the health materials should be handled
17 in the classroom.
18
So there are two distinct areas in which I
19 looked:
20 these educational manuals that the state sometimes put
21 out and local educational councils put out.
22
The general state recommendations, and then
Then, of course, I had to check to see which
23 textbooks were listed in those two kinds of -- two sets
24 of documents, and then to look at some of the textbooks
25 themselves.
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 25
1
I also looked at state legislation for
2 Mississippi to see what the state was -- what kind of
3 legislation or laws the state was passing that mandated
4 that health classes be taught.
Q
5
How did you go about finding the state
6 materials, the first issue that you discussed there, the
7 first category you discussed?
8
9
A
I requested that material from Shook, Hardy &
Bacon.
Q
10
Did you do any original research of your own
11 or make any effort to find the materials on your own
12 with regard to state requirements and health education
13 classes?
14 A
15 Q
You mean other than request material about it?
Yeah.
Other than requesting materials from
16 the law firm, did you do any research on your own to
17 obtain that?
18
A
I did the original research in the material I
19 received.
20 state was doing.
21 it.
22
Q
I had to go through that to look at what the
But I requested it and then researched
Let me ask it this way:
Did you undertake any
23 investigative efforts personally or through a research
24 assistant under your direction to look at or find any
25 state health education materials for Mississippi during
United Reporting, Inc

the period of time that Johnny Calloway was in school?
2 MS. BROWN:
3 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
No, I didn't personally gather
4 the material, but I did personally research the
5 material.
6 BY MR. GDANSKI:
7
Q
When you say "research," do you mean read?
8 What you mean there is you read what Shook, Hardy &
9 Bacon sent to you, right?
10 MS. BROWN:
11 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Yes, I read the state documents,
12 the legislation, which are all -- it is public
13 information, in the public domain.
14 and tried to decide then what the state was requiring
15 and how intensively -- or how interested the state was
16 in this issue of health.
17 BY MR. GDANSKI:
18
Q
That's a little more than I asked you,
19 Dr. Hoff.
20 you're saying.
21
I read that material
So I just want to make sure I understand what
The research that you did into the state's
22 health education programs or health education
23 requirements was limited to reading what Shook, Hardy &
24 Bacon sent to you on that subject matter, correct?

Did you make any efforts to find anything else
5 that was in the public record outside of what Shook,

7 A
8 Q
9
10
No.
So the reading that you did for purposes of
health education in this case was limited to what Shook,
Hardy & Bacon sent to you, correct?
11 MS. BROWN:
12 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Yes, it was limited to the years
13 where he was in school, and the legislation and the
14 guidelines coming from the state and local school
15 councils pertained then to those years.
16 BY MR. GDANSKI:
17
Q
I deposed you on a number of occasions,
18 Dr. Hoff.
19 I don't want to have a situation where I'm asking
20 questions and I'm getting answers that are not
21 responsive to the question, or answer some other
22 question, or answer the question and go on on some
23 tangent unrelated to the question.
24
25
This is I think my third time.
And I just --
So I'd just appreciate it if you'd answer just
the question, okay?
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 28

MS. BROWN:
I think probably some of the
2 confusion is being created by the fact that she's
3 offering you more information perhaps because you keep
4 asking the same question.
5
MS. MILLNER:
I just want to point out that I
6 thought her response was completely related to the
7 subject matter and responsive to the question.
8 would object to your commentary.
9 BY MR. GDANSKI:
10
Q
So I
Dr. Hoff, I'm just going to ask you a yes or
11 no question:
For purposes of the state health education
12 materials that you reviewed in this case, all of the
13 materials that you reviewed were sent to you by Shook,
14 Hardy & Bacon, correct? 15 MS. MILLNER: Objection.
16 THE WITNESS: As I've indicated, that's the
17 material I reviewed, yes.
18 BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q
Asked and answered.
Thank you.
The local educational manuals, did you
20
21 research those on your own or were those also sent to
22 you by Shook, Hardy & Bacon?
23 A
24 Q
25
They came from Shook, Hardy & Bacon.
Did you give them specifications that you
wanted them to include in the materials that they sent
United Reporting, Inc

What high school did he go to?
Mr. Gdanski, I think she was still
in the middle of an answer.
MR. GDANSKI:
I heard her say "I don't know."
I'm not sure what else there is to the answer.
Q
15
16
I don't know.
MS. BROWN:

13
What elementary school did Johnny Calloway go
What else is there to the answer?
MS. BROWN:
You would have known had you not
cut her off.
17
THE WITNESS:
I don't know because it wasn't
18 clear from the testimony.

20 Q 21 A 22 Q Okay.
23 A No.
24
25
What high school did Mr. Calloway go to?
That also wasn't clear from the testimony.
So you don't know, correct?
I do know he went to the tenth grade,
which would have included high school.
Q
I'm saying, you don't know what high school he
United Reporting, Inc

went to, correct?
2 A
3 Q
I don't.
You do not know any of the specific health
4 education textbooks that he was -- used or he was shown
5 in either elementary school or high school, correct?
6 MS. BROWN:
7 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I know what textbooks the state

Q
But I do know what books
Dr. Hoff, you do not know the specific
14 textbooks with regard to health education that Johnny

Q
And you mentioned legislation, that you did
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 31
1 some original research into Mississippi state
2 legislation; is that right?
3 A
4 Q
Um-hum.
Okay.
Yes.
The materials that you reviewed that
5 are new on your list with regard to Mississippi
6 legislation, were those sent to you by Shook, Hardy &
7 Bacon?
8 A
9 Q
Yes.
Did you do any of your own investigation or
10 look on your own for legislative materials from
11 Mississippi?
12 A
13 Q
No.
What criteria did you give to Shook, Hardy &
14 Bacon for the materials that you wanted them to send you
15 with regard to local educational manuals?
16
A
As I said, I told them that what I needed
17 again was the state legislation, I needed the state
18 Board of Education general position on health classes
19 and how much time they -- how important they might have
20 thought these health classes were.
21
I then asked them, of course, for any other
22 kind of manual that might have appeared in the time
23 period of when he was in school, and that was the kind
24 of material then that I received.
25
I had to look at those documents, as I said
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 32
1 previously, for textbooks.
2 under both "Textbooks" and "Book Lists" the texts
3 which -- on health which then were listed by the state
4 and then were used in the primary and secondary schools.
Q
5
Okay.
So you will find on the disk
Just going back for a minute to the
6 "Books, Pamphlets, Posters and Reports" section of your
7 reliance materials, the additional research that you
8 performed in that category, was that material sent to
9 you by Shook, Hardy & Bacon or did you find it on your

11
12
own?
A
question?
13 Q
14 A
15 Q
Would you repeat the first part of the
I obviously --
Sure.
Go ahead.
I just didn't hear the first part.
I'm just backing up for a minute.
We had talked about the new research you did
16
17 for the American Cancer Society materials and the
18 Florida Lung Association, which is under your "Books,
19 Pamphlets, Posters and Reports" heading on your reliance
20 list, right?
21 A Yes.
22 Q Okay.
And I'm asking, those additional new
23 items that you referenced from the American Cancer
24 Society and the Florida Lung Association, were those new
25 materials sent to you by Shook, Hardy & Bacon or did you

Those were sent to me from Shook, Hardy &

No, I asked specifically -- I had looked

8 on Smoking and Health.

It had come up previously in my

10 on the disk, and then the additional material from the
11 lung association and the American Cancer Society.

Under -- and we've covered books,
Yes.
And for any new materials you've reviewed,
we've covered those three categories, right?

Yes.
Litigation, you have a section on litigation.
11 There's just two documents, Austin v. State and then

18 A
19 Q
No.
No.
I'm going to skip newspapers for now and go to
20 other materials.

7
8
9
I don't think so, but you list Ayers -- list
There's Ayers.
Yes.
And there's eight documents in there.
What is
Ayers?
A
Ayers is simply -- it gives publication
figures for national newspapers and magazines.
10 gives me a sense of how widely distributed these
11 publications were.

14
15

18
Q
So it
Did you include any of the publications that
we know Mr. Calloway read or looked at?
A
What he looked at were primarily newspapers.
So the --
Q
For example, did you see any testimony in the
case that he would read Jet or Ebony magazine?
A
There was an indication in I think two of the
19 depositions that Jet and Ebony may have been subscribed
20 to by his second wife, Marvine.
21
Q
And did you check the Ayers statistics on Jet
22 and Ebony magazine for the periods of time that he would
23 have had that subscription coming to his home?
24
25
A
No, I did not.
I had previously done research
on Jet and Ebony, but I didn't check the exact number,
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 36
1
2
3
the publication number for those years.
Q
Prior to this case, have you done any research
for Jet or Ebony magazine?
4 A
5 Q
6 A
Yes.
Which case did that relate to?
I think it was primarily one case which never
7 went to trial called Standish, and I did original
8 research at the Schomburg Black History Center in Harlem
9 on both of those magazines.
10
Q
Under the folder "Frank Statements," you have
11 those same sections or the same three Frank statements
12 from the last deposition.
13 original research and include any new or additional
14 reliance materials for purposes of your opinion in this
15 case or the materials that you reviewed in this case as
16 it relates to other Frank statements?
17 A
18 Q
Did you do any new or
No.
Since the Tullo deposition, has your opinion
19 changed with regard to the reason why you include other
20 Frank statements in your reliance materials?
21 A
22 Q
No, it has not.
And then you have three Gallup polls.
I know
23 that you've included those in the past, too.
24 you reviewed or received or looked at and did you rely
25 upon any new or additional polling data other than those
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
So havePage 37
1
three Gallup polls that you had on there in the past?
2 A
3 Q
No.
Under "Newspapers, Magazines and Periodicals,"
4 there's a whole lot of them.
5 through each one, I'd like you to tell me, did you do --
6 or review any new materials that you had not previously
7 seen or reviewed as it relates to newspapers, magazines
8 and periodicals for purposes of your opinions in this
9 case?
10 A
11 Q
And so instead of going
Yes, I did, as I've said previously.
Can you tell me what newspapers, magazines or
12 periodicals you reviewed for the first time for purposes
13 of this case?
14 A
The Hattiesburg American newspaper and the
15 Melbourne Times.
16 the Miami Herald, and likewise extend the research on
17 the Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel paper.
18 did a very brief review for a five-year period of the
19 Chicago Tribune.
20
Q
And then I had to extend research on
And I guess I
We'll get to those in detail then.
I'm going
21 to go through the ones that you did not just list.
22 Under "Consumer Reports," Florida Health
23 Notes, New York Times, Newsweek, Reader's Digest, Time,
24 U.S. News and World Report, those are all the same
25 materials that you've used in the past for purposes of
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 38
1
your opinions, correct?
2
3
4
A
Yes, to show national coverage on the topic of
the health hazards of smoking.
Q
And the methodology that you used to obtain
5 those materials for those papers is the same as the
6 methodology you and I went over in the Tullo case?
7 A
8 Q
9 A
10 Q
Yes.
Is that right?
Yes.
You didn't go back and look at the original
11 magazines or do any kind of new investigation into those
12 magazines or those periodicals or those newspapers; is
13 that right?
14 A
15 Q
That's correct.
Okay.
Now, I see also that on the list of
16 materials that you reviewed that you did not mention is
17 Ebony and Jet magazine; is that right?
18
19
20
A
We just discussed that.
Yes.
I looked at
those.
Q
Okay.
So in this case, you didn't perform
21 original research into those because you had already
22 researched those for purposes of a prior case; is that
23 right?
24
25
A
That's correct.
I did review material from
those two publications, but it wasn't clear to me from
United Reporting, Inc

the depositions that he would have read them.

MS. BROWN:
Mr. Gdanski, just for

Those materials did
MS. MILLNER:
And I think her notes from
Essence, right?
13 MS. BROWN: 14 THE WITNESS: Yes, I do.
15 MS. MILLNER: They're included.
16 THE WITNESS: I do have notes from Essence.
17 MS. MILLNER: They've been sent.
18 MR. GDANSKI: Are you all agreeing after you
Do you have notes from Essence?
19 supplement the material with regard to Essence magazine
20 to put her up for deposition again to discuss those
21 materials?
22
MS. BROWN:
I mean, Mr. Gdanski, we can take
23 it up at that time.
24 if you really think it's necessary to reopen the
25 deposition, we can certainly discuss it at that point.
You can look at the materials, and

What
Sorry.
Were you ever deposed in the Standish case?
4
5
We can figure it out.
A
I don't believe I was.
I can remember doing
the research, but I don't think there was a deposition.
Q
Okay.
Do you know where that case was
pending, state, federal court, what state?
A
It was in New York.
She I think lived in
Brooklyn, worked in New York City.
11 Q

13 Q
I assume that was an African-American smoker.
Yes, it was.

Exactly.
No, I didn't.
Okay.
When did you do the research for the
Standish case in Jet and Ebony magazine?
A
I would say it was probably back in maybe
2000, 2001.
Q
Do you know who the plaintiff's lawyer was in
that case?

4 Q
5
No, I don't.
Do you know what happened to the case?
No.
What were the years that you researched Jet
and Ebony magazine before in the Standish case?
6
A
Well, in that case, I went back, as would be
7 applicable in this case, to the 1950s and went forward.
8 But for this particular case, given Johnny Calloway's
9 age and given the fact that I don't think he would have
10 seen Jet and Ebony until he married Marvine in 1972,
11 that was the relevant time period for this case, though
12 I looked at articles or information going back to the
13 '50s.

Dr. Hoff, since your last deposition, have you
15 undertaken to review any of the internal tobacco company
16 documents from any company at all?

No, I have not.
Have you read Ashes to Ashes?

I'm saying since then,
No, I have not.

4 A No.
5 Q
By Allan Brandt?
So in this case, you took the materials from
6 your Jet and Ebony research that you did in the Standish
7 case and you confined it from 1972 going forward; is
8 that right?
9
10
11
A
That's what I concentrated on because of the
facts of the case.
Q
The materials from Jet and Ebony magazine that
12 you included, did you find those on your own or were
13 those sent to you by Shook, Hardy & Bacon?
14
A
Both.
I found them in my original research,
15 and then Shook, Hardy & Bacon sent the disk of articles,
16 including mine, on both magazines.
17
18
19
Q
What do you mean by that?
I'm sorry.
I don't
quite understand.
A
Well, I had an original list of articles that
20 I had looked at almost ten years ago, and then I
21 requested from Shook, Hardy & Bacon disks on both
22 magazines so that I could compare and contrast what I --
23 the original research I had done with any other articles
24 they may have had from those two magazines.
25
Q
When you researched Jet and Ebony magazine on
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 43
1 your own ten years ago, what search terms did you use to
2 find the materials that you found?
3
A
It wasn't possible to use search terms because
4 those -- I looked at the original magazines at the
5 Schomburg Black History Center.
6
7
Q
So you would actually sit there and pull out
the original magazine onto a desk or a shelf?
8 A
9 Q
10 A
They had bound volumes of Jet and Ebony.
Do they still have them there?
As far as I know.
It isn't the most updated
11 research center, but they did have the bound volumes.
12 They have very little that's been digitized at the
13 center itself.
14
15
Q
So let's say you sat with a magazine from --
let me back up.
After you looked through the magazine, what
16
17 would you do?
18 was interesting, or you would make photocopies of the
19 pages you wanted to include in your materials?
20
A
You'd create an index of what you thought
Well, I did both.
But largely I took notes,
21 as I do on all these print media that I look at.
22 notes, took down the headlines, took down a few details
23 about what the article may have said.
24 looked like it was important enough for my purposes, I
25 would make Xerox copies.
I took
And then if it
So I have a very selected
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 44

group of Xerox copies of both the magazines.
Q
And then from that selected group, you sent
3 the list of the articles corresponding to your select
4 group of documents to Shook, Hardy, and then they sent
5 you back a CD with those materials and other materials?
6
A
Yes.
I don't think I actually sent my -- you
7 have my notes, and I brought my notes for this
8 deposition.
9 requested the disks on Jet and Ebony.
10
Q
I did not send them my notes before I
And when you sat in the library in New York
11 City and took notes on the original Jet and Ebony
12 magazines, would you take those notes handwritten or on
13 a computer?
14
A
They were always handwritten.
They had so few
15 electrical outlets that worked, I couldn't use my
16 computer.
17
Q
Did you bring the notes that you took with
18 you, that you made back ten years ago when you did the
19 original research into Jet and Ebony, did you bring
20 those notes with you today?
21 A
22 Q
23
24
25
Yes, I did.
And those are on the notes that have been sent
to me?
A
Yes.

Gotcha.
I'll
look through those when we print them out.
Q
6
And you would include in there the articles
7 that you thought were relevant to your purpose and your
8 opinions; is that right?
9 A
10 Q
Yes.
And then you sent that list to Shook, Hardy &
11 Bacon, not your notes, but the list of the articles that
12 you had amassed; is that right?
13 A
14 Q
15
A
17 Q
19
So I'm a little confused.
What did you send
to Shook, Hardy & Bacon --
16
18
No, I did not send that.
I sent my --
-- that had your Ebony and Jet materials on
it?
A
20
I'm sorry to have interrupted you.
I simply asked them for the information they
21 may have had on Jet and Ebony to compare it with what
22 research I had previously done.
23
Q
And when you say "the information they had on
24 Jet and Ebony," you don't mean the internal documents
25 that may have referenced their advertising expenditures
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 46
1 or theirs goals and purposes in advertising in those
2 magazines, you mean the magazines that they have amassed
3 for their collection of public statements regarding the
4 health hazards of smoking, right?
5 MS. MILLNER:
Object to the form.
6 THE WITNESS:
That's basically correct.

BY MR. GDANSKI:
Q
Did the list they sent you back, did it
contain additional information above and beyond what you
had found on your own?
A
As I started to compare, again, for the time
12 period of the '70s and '80s, I had taken down maybe four
13 or five articles that didn't show up on the disk itself.
14 But as I looked at those articles, they really
15 probably -- or I knew they really weren't relevant to
16 this case.
17
Sometimes -- when I initially did that
18 research, I was naturally interested in what information
19 the black community, in this case in New York, was
20 receiving on the subject matter.
21 showing perhaps my own ignorance of the subject, I took
22 down sometimes anecdotal information, which had really
23 nothing to do with the topic of the health hazards of
24 smoking.
25
Q
So I took down --
Ebony and Jet were not limited to New York,
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 47

were they?
A
No, not at all.
3 distributed.
4 Q
They were nationally
So I think I heard you say that your interest
5 was in figuring out what was in New York.
6 mean by that?
7 A
8
9
What did you
Well, I did the research for a New York case.
That's all I'm saying.
Q
Gotcha.
Did you go back to the library in Harlem to do
10
11 any new or additional research as it relates to Jet or
12 Ebony magazine?
13 A
14 Q
No.
Is it fair to say you have not seen any
15 communications between Phillip Morris or any of the
16 tobacco companies and Jet or Ebony magazine regarding
17 their advertising in that magazine or their efforts to
18 get certain statements made in publications in the
19 magazine?
Is that right?
20 MS. BROWN:
21 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
That's correct if you mean
22 correspondence with the editors of Jet and Ebony.
23 BY MR. GDANSKI:
24
25
Q
In all the materials that are on your reliance
list, is it fair to say you cannot point to any one
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 48
1 piece of paper, any one article and say that Johnny
2 Calloway certainly saw this?
3 A
4 Q
That's correct.
The same is true with the AV materials, the
5 television commercials or movie clips; you cannot point
6 to any of those materials and tell us with certainty
7 that Johnny Calloway ever saw any of those; is that
8 correct?
9 A
10 Q
Again, that's correct.
And you do not include and you did not include
11 in this case any advertisements on your reliance list
12 unless those advertisements happened to have been on the
13 same page or near one of the articles that you found
14 relevant; is that still correct?
15 A
16 Q
Yes.
So, for example, you didn't include the Frank
17 statement in this, in your reliance list, unless the
18 Frank statement was mentioned in an article; is that
19 right?
20
21
22
23
24
25
A
Or whether the ad itself was published by the
newspaper.
Q
So is the Frank statement included in your
reliance materials?
A
Yes, it is, to the degree that it shows up in
the publications I researched.
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 49

2
Which publication that you researched for
purposes of this case contained the Frank statement?
3
A
It showed up in the -- we're talking about

6 ad itself, but a story about the ad showed up in the
7 Hattiesburg American.
It showed up in the Chicago Tribune.

It showed up
Actually, it showed up -- not the

So it varied depending on
And in the paper that Johnny -- in the
community paper -- let's back up.
Where did Johnny Calloway live in

17 A
18 Q
He was still in Hattiesburg.
And in the Hattiesburg community paper, there
19 was an article that referenced the issuance of the Frank
20 statement and the promises made by the tobacco companies
21 in that statement; is that right?
22 MS. BROWN:
23 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
It was an article that said that
24 this ad had appeared and that the issue -- of course,
25 the issue was the -- the reason the ad appeared was

9
That wasn't my question right
Dr. Hoff, can you tell me -- let's talk about
10 the Hattiesburg press.
11 that you reviewed and included on your reliance list
12 from the Hattiesburg newspaper?
13
14
15
A
How did you obtain the materials
I actually sent a researcher to look the paper
up.
Q
16
Okay.
Who did you send?
MS. BROWN:
Mr. Gdanski, we're not going to
17 disclose the name of Dr. Hoff's researchers for reasons
18 I'm sure you understand.
19 about her research assistant, but we won't be providing
20 you the research assistant's name.
21
22
23
24
25
MR. GDANSKI:
So you can ask her, of course,
I don't know what you're talking
about.
MS. BROWN:
I'm happy to elaborate,
Mr. Gdanski.
I thought you were aware, but maybe you're
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 52
1 not, that some experts that I think have been retained
2 by you perhaps in this case, Dr. Kyrakoudes and
3 Dr. Proctor, have been involved in situations where once
4 a research assistant for a defense expert is identified
5 by name in a deposition, Dr. Kyrakoudes shared that
6 information with Dr. Proctor, and Dr. Proctor then makes
7 efforts to interfere or intimidate those research
8 assistants.
9
So for that reason, we're not providing the
10 names of our research assistants or Dr. Hoff's research
11 assistants.
12 BY MR. GDANSKI:
13
Q
Dr. Hoff, was this research assistant someone
14 that you paid?
15 A
16 Q
17 A
Yes.
How did you know this research assistant?
She had been a graduate student at Montana
18 State University, and I had advised her on her master's
19 dissertation and given her advice about whether or not
20 she should go on for a Ph.D. in history.
21
22
23
24
25
Q
Did you advise her to go ahead and get a
Ph.D.?
A
Actually, I told her to get a law degree
because it was quicker than getting a Ph.D.
Q
However --
She could become a lawyer and then work for

And then she could go on and get a Ph.D.
She didn't follow your recommendation?
She did not follow my recommendation.
Okay.
When was this student a graduate
student of yours?
A
She was never my graduate student.
I didn't
12 sit on her MA committee.

I think they're representatively comprehensive

16 made sure that I didn't eliminate anything that would be
17 either prejudicial to the tobacco companies or
18 prejudicial to the plaintiffs in this case.

15
Q
What was the assignment that you gave to your
graduate student who went down to Hattiesburg?
A
Well, I indicated to her, obviously, this was
16 a black man who had lived in the area and who would have
17 been able to read the Hattiesburg paper from really
18 roughly '55, let's say, to '56.
19 or maybe starting to read perhaps at 16 or 17 to the
20 time he left when he was 22.
He would have been 18,
21 So she looked at the time period from
22 roughly -- or not roughly -- from 1950 to 1956.
23
Q
And for purposes of the Hattiesburg paper, I
24 only see materials that were included with regard to the
25 years 1951, '54 and '55.
Is that correct?
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 56
1
A
That's correct, because while she researched
2 the time period I gave you, she came up with articles
3 for those years.
Q
4
5
So she researched from, if I understood you,
1950 to 19 -- what year?
6 A '56.
7 Q Okay.
And she didn't find any articles that
8 she felt were relevant in, let's say, 1956; is that
9 right?
10 A
11 Q
That's correct.
And you didn't go and look to see if there
12 was, in fact, anything from 1956 that was relevant, did
13 you?
14 A
15 Q
No, I did not.
What criteria -- what was the methodology that
16 you advised her to use in selecting articles to include
17 on your reliance list?
18
A
It's the same instructions I give all research
19 assistants whether it's for my own purposes or whether
20 it's for a case like this.
21
In this instance, she was looking at every
22 single issue of the Hattiesburg American for those
23 years, from 1950 to 1956.
24 reference to tobacco, to smoking, to health hazards, to
25 diseases related to smoking, to the idea that smoking

included cigarette advertisements?

For example, is one of the categories that was
No.
Did she include an article if it was about
tobacco companies?
A
She would have if the article mentioned
10 tobacco companies in relation to hazards of smoking or a
11 scientific study.
12 the Hattiesburg paper that referenced the Hammond and
13 Horn studies in '54 and '55.
14
15
16
Q
She actually found two articles from
And then she found the article that referenced
the Frank statement, right?
A
Yes.
She found one earlier that referenced a
17 kind of use of the term "coffin nail," which was
18 anecdotally kind of interesting.
19
20
Q
When did this research assistant go down to
Hattiesburg to do this research?
21 A
22 Q
23 A
24 Q
25 A
Sometime last year.
Did you pay her or did Shook pay her?
I paid her.
What was her hourly rate?
Her hourly rate was $25 an hour.
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 58

2
Q
Did you pay her out of the money you received
from Shook or did you bill that back to the law firm?
3 A
4 Q
I billed it back.
Did you tell them that you were sending a
5 graduate student to do research in the Hattiesburg paper
6 for you?
7
A
I probably did.
I can't remember specifically
8 saying that, but if I didn't tell them, they would have
9 known once I got the material.
10
Q
Without the research she did for you in this
11 case, you could not have come to your opinions as to
12 what Johnny Calloway's local newspaper said about the
13 health hazards of smoking in the early to mid '50s; is
14 that right?
15 MS. BROWN:
16 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I'm not sure what you're asking.
17 Obviously to find out what it said, I had to have
18 research done on the paper.
19 BY MR. GDANSKI:
20
Q
Right.
And without the research that she did
21 for you in this case, you would not know what it said,
22 right?
23 A
24 Q
25
That's correct.
Let's move to the Melbourne Daily.
I have here the Melbourne Daily from 1955

8 read was the Melbourne paper, and then I think
9 subsequently he did move to Melbourne.

Dr. Hoff, since your last deposition, have you

22
In terms of the print publications or --
In terms of any publications or any materials.
In other words, you told me in the two
23 locations that your cut-off date was 1990, and we had a
24 discussion about some cases you looked a few years
25 later, maybe some cases earlier.

17 tobacco, on smoking hazards, any kind of information

You mentioned that one of the areas you had
her research was filter and low tar and nicotine.
10 You're saying that any articles which referenced

13 A Yes.

How about advertisements that
15 referenced low tar, low nicotine or filtered cigarettes?
16 Would she have included those in her materials?

They could have been seen by him, but they

Did you ever go and double-check her work to
No.
You trusted her work, right?
Yes.
And you also trusted the work of the
researcher who did the research in Hattiesburg, right?
8 A
9 Q
That's correct.
Of the materials that were sent to you by the
10 researcher from the Hattiesburg paper or the researcher
11 from the Melbourne Daily Times, did you omit anything
12 they sent you --
13 A
14 Q
15 A
16 Q
No.
-- for purposes of your reliance list?
No.
I omitted nothing.
How soon after you received the materials from
17 the researcher in Hattiesburg or Melbourne did you
18 submit those materials to Shook?
19
A
The usual procedure is that as soon as I
20 receive the material, whether it's hard copy or in
21 electronic form, I send it on to Shook, Hardy & Bacon.
22
Q
The materials you received from Hattiesburg
23 and Melbourne, were they in electronic form, on a flash
24 drive or CD or -- I don't know what they could be on --
25 or were they hard copies?
United Reporting, Inc

In the case of the Hattiesburg American, they

4 I'm not quite sure that -- I don't think there were
5 electronic scanned copies on that one.
6
7
Q
In the case of the
So you got a big box, I imagine, of paper from
the Melbourne Daily Times, right?
8 A
9 Q
Yes.
I prefer to see the hard copy.
Did you immediately forward those hard copies
10 to Shook or did you look through them first and then
11 forward them?
12 A
I usually forward them immediately, within a
13 day, long before I look at them, particularly if they're
14 very voluminous.
15
Q
And then what happened?
Shook sent you back
16 your copies or they scanned them and sent you back the
17 digital copies?
18
A
They have double copies.
So if I send the
19 hard copy, they have a copy and I have a copy, and then
20 it goes on to the reliance list.
21
22
23
24
25
Q
So the researcher sent you two copies, one for
Shook and one for you?
A
Yes.
The Hattiesburg researcher did not, but
the researcher I used for the Melbourne paper did.
Q
Okay.
Did you tell her to do that?
United Reporting, Inc

1 A
2 Q
3 A
4 Q
5
Yes.
And has Shook in the past told you to do that?
To do what?
To get double copies from researchers you use
so they can get one and you can get one.
6
A
I think so.
At one point I was doing the
7 copies myself, but it didn't prove to be an efficient
8 way to handle it.
9 copies if it was hard copy.
10
Q
So I instructed them to make two
And the paper from Hattiesburg, after you got
11 three years' worth of materials that were selected, did
12 you send it to Shook and then they sent you back an
13 original copy or they sent you back a digital copy?
14 did that work?
15 A

I sent them a second copy of the hard copy and
16 I sent them the disk that she had provided me, a copy of
17 the disk.

I'm sorry.
So my question is, did Mr. Calloway ever live
3 with Evelyn Calloway in Miami or South Florida, Broward,
4 West Palm Beach or Miami?
5 A
6 Q
7 A
Not that I know of.
When did Mr. Calloway move to South Florida?
I assume for business purposes.
8 MS. MILLNER: No, when, he asked.
9 THE WITNESS: I'm sorry.

I heard "why," too.

Q Would you describe Mr. Calloway as an educated
A He had, as I said previously, only a tenth
man?
17 grade education, but all the testimony indicates that
18 with that education, he still was a reader of a number
19 of newspapers.
20 Q
21 A
22
23
And to that degree --
And as a reader -- I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
To that degree then, I think he was a
self-made man professionally and a self-educated person.
Q
As a reader of a number of newspapers, he
24 would have come across information regarding smoking and
25 health, correct?
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 82
1
A
Yes, especially once he moved to Florida.
2 That's true.
3 Q
And as a reader of newspapers, he would have
4 also come across information or statements from the
5 tobacco company or the representatives that it was not
6 yet conclusively proven that smoking caused disease or
7 that more testing was needed; is that fair?
8
9
10
A
If it appeared in some of the articles which
dealt with the health risks of smoking.
Q
And in the same way he would have seen
11 articles on smoking and health, he would have seen
12 articles that contain quotes or the position of the
13 tobacco companies; is that fair?
14
15
16
A
Well, of the TIRC or the TI, not necessarily a
specific tobacco company.
Q
Or if there was a quote from a representative
17 of Phillip Morris or Reynolds, he would have seen those
18 in the newspapers that he read, right?
19
20
21
A
He would have, but those were very, very
infrequent.
Q
Since your Tullo deposition, did you go and
22 watch the Ed Horrigan interview on 20/20 News with Ted
23 Koppel?
24 A
25 Q
No, I did not.
We discussed this in your Tullo deposition,
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 83
1 and you talked a little bit about the fact that the
2 position of the tobacco companies was that filtered
3 cigarettes or low tar light cigarettes would remove any
4 of the harms or dangerous elements if there were any in
5 cigarettes; is that an accurate statement?
6
A
I don't think it is quite accurate.
They
7 would advertise, or did up to a point advertise low tar
8 in cigarettes, but the ad itself would never have said
9 that it was less injurious.
10
11
Q
I didn't say "less injurious."
Did the
tobacco companies --
12 A
13 Q
Or injurious at all.
Right.
I didn't say that, either.
Did the tobacco companies come out, through
14
15 their spokespeople, the TI, TIRC, or CTR, or
16 individually through representatives of the company, and
17 publicly maintain that filtered, light or low tar
18 cigarettes would remove any of the harmful elements from
19 cigarettes if there were any?
20
A
They really didn't say it in those terms
21 because to have said that they were removing injurious
22 material would indicate that it had been -- it was in
23 cigarettes.
24
25
So what they said usually is that they had --
that they were putting out cigarettes that were low in
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 84
1 tar and nicotine, and indicating that this was a better
2 kind of cigarette to smoke.
3
Q
Okay.
And if that were the case, Mr. Calloway
4 in the newspapers or through public mediums would have
5 been exposed to that message, correct?
6
A
Exposed to it to the degree that that message
7 appeared in the articles that he was reading.
8 a message that was carried to any great degree in any of
9 the -- at least in the Melbourne papers.
10 Q

Do you know when the Calloway family first had

16 A He went to some movies, but he wasn't a

movie-goer.
18
There is, to get back to your other question,
19 an indication that he watched the news on television and
20 primarily watched what in Florida would have been CBS.
21
Q
Have you done any research in this case into
22 the companies' -- the tobacco companies' use of sampling
23 cigarettes, providing free cigarettes to consumers on
24 the street or through mail?
25
A
What was the first part of the question?
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
DidPage 85

2
I --
Q
Sure.
Have you done any research in this case
3 into the tobacco companies' use of sampling free
4 cigarettes through the mail or giving them out on the
5 street?
6 A
7 Q
No, I haven't.
You are aware of testimony in this case that
8 Mr. Calloway and his wife, the plaintiff, Marvine
9 Calloway, did receive free cigarettes through sampling;
10
is that right?
11 MS. BROWN:
12 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I remember them using coupons.
13 I'm not sure I remember them using the free cigarettes
14 through sampling.

19
20
Q
When did Johnny Calloway meet Marvine
Calloway?
A
I think he met her a couple of years perhaps
before they were married in '72.
Q
The additional research that you did in the
21 Miami Herald and the Sun Sentinel, did you do that
22 research or was it done for you by a research assistant
23 or somebody else?
24
25
A
As I said, I had originally done research in
the Florida -- the Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel, and
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 86
1 then I had research done by -- additional research by an
2 assistant on that paper, and then I had the Miami Herald
3 done by another research assistant.
4
5
6
Q
So it's two separate people, one did the
Herald and one did the Sun Sentinel?
A
Yes.
In the case of the Miami Herald, I
7 actually had three research assistants working on it
8 because initially the deposition indicated that he'd
9 only read the Sunday Herald; then it came out that he
10
probably bought the Miami Herald.
11
So I had the woman in Florida do an online
12 research for the time period involved, and then I
13 finally had the woman in Washington DC look at the
14 microfilm copy of the Miami Herald to make sure that
15 I -- the articles that were searched online were the
16 only ones available.
17
18
Q
I got lost there a little bit.
So
let's start from the beginning.
At some point you read a deposition that
19
20
Okay.
indicated that he read the Miami Herald, right?
21 A Yes.
22 Q Okay.
23 A
Whose deposition was that?
It would have been -- let me just back up on
24 the time frame.
25 reading when he was in Melbourne.
The Miami Herald he would have been
So it was his first
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 87
1
2
wife's deposition, I think.
Q
So your testimony is that Evelyn Calloway said
3 that he read the Miami Herald when they lived in
4 Melbourne; is that right?
5
A
That's what I'm recalling, though as I said
6 earlier, it might have been coming from the second wife.
7 But there's a reference to the fact that he read the
8 Sunday Herald, Miami Herald.
9
Q
After you read that deposition, whatever it
10 is, that referenced the Sunday Herald, you assigned a
11 new researcher, not the same person who did the
12 Hattiesburg, not the same person who did Chicago, and
13 not the same person who did Melbourne, to look at the
14 Sunday Herald; is that right?
15
A
No, I assigned the woman in Bozeman, Montana,
16 who had done the Hattiesburg paper, I had her do an
17 online search of the Sunday Miami Herald.
18 Q
19 A
20 Q
For what years?
For the years that they were in Melbourne.
So you were going under the assumption for
21 purposes of that that it was the deposition of Evelyn
22 Calloway who testified that it was Johnny who read the
23 Sunday paper, right?
24 MS. BROWN:
25 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
If indeed it was Evelyn.
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 88
1
2
3
BY MR. GDANSKI:
Q
Right.
But you restricted the years to the
years that he lived in Melbourne?
4 A
5 Q
Yes.
So you had to be going off of Evelyn, right?
6 MS. BROWN:
7 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I didn't restrict the years
8 actually to the Miami Herald since the paper is
9 distributed throughout the state.
I looked at it
10 obviously beginning in the -- from really the '50s
11 through 1990 simply because of the fact he was such a
12 reader of newspapers, it was conceivable that he had
13 seen other issues of the newspaper other than when they
14 were in Melbourne.
15 BY MR. GDANSKI:
16
17
18
19
20
Q
So prior to this case, what years of the Miami
Herald had you already researched?
A
I don't think I had researched the Miami
Herald prior to this case.
Q
So you found out he read the Herald, the
21 research assistant from Montana did a research project
22 to look at the Sunday Miami Herald from 1955 to 1990?
23 A
24 Q
25
Yes, she did.
It's the same researcher who did the
Hattiesburg paper, right?
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 89
1 A
2 Q
That's correct.
Then at some point it occurred to you or
3 deposition testimony revealed that he may have read the
4 Herald more than just on Sunday but every day of the
5 week?
6
A
Not every day, but there was testimony to the
7 fact that he did buy it, and so it's hard to know
8 whether it was every day or how much he bought it.
9
Q
And after you learned of that testimony, you
10 assigned the project of looking at all of the Miami
11 Herald between 1955 and 1990 to the Washington DC based
12 Lithuanian researcher; fair?
13
14
A
I did that after I had the researcher in
Florida do an online search for those years.
15 Q
When did the researcher in Florida start her
16 work and why?
17 A
Because I went to her after I came to the
18 conclusion that he probably read it more.
19 time frame I was looking at, I thought that the quickest
20 and most efficient way to have that done was to have her
21 just do an online research.
22
23
Q
But given the
How did you come to know of or learn about
this researcher in Florida?
24 A
25 Q
I think I've answered that question.
Was this someone that Shook, Hardy recommended
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 90
1 to you?
2 A
3 Q
4
right?
5
Yes.
But this is now a fourth researcher; is that
This is not the same person?
A
There are three researchers involved:
One in
6 Bozeman, Montana; one in Gainesville, Florida; and one
7 in Washington DC.
Q
8
9
10
Okay.
So the one who did the second set of
research in the Miami Herald is the same person who did
the research in the Hattiesburg newspaper, right?
11
A
No.
She would have done the online research
12 for the longer time period for the Miami Herald.
13 the one who did the Melbourne paper.
Q
14
I'm sorry.
The Melbourne paper.
I misspoke.
15 The person who did the second set of online research
16 into the Miami Herald is the same person who did the
17 Melbourne research, right?
18 A Yes.
19 Q Okay.
She's
After the person -- this individual
20 finished her online research of the Herald between '55
21 and '90, you then had the Washington DC based Lithuanian
22 researcher do a full review of the paper between '55 and
23 1990?
24
25
A
Looking for the subject matter that she was
looking for in the other newspapers.
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 91
1
Q
Right.
And again, using the same methodology
2 you used not to include an article about tobacco
3 companies unless it referenced smoking and health, and
4 also not to include advertisements unless it appeared on
5 the same page and would be copied on the same page as an
6 article you thought to be relevant, right?
7 MS. BROWN:
8 THE WITNESS:
9
10
11
Object to form.
It's a long question, but I
think the answer is yes.
BY MR. GDANSKI:
Q
Your researchers have used the same
12 methodology you used which we discussed in the Tullo
13 deposition; fair?
14 A
15 Q
16 A
17 Q
Yes.
And they do that at your request, right?
Yes.
Have any of your researchers ever looked at
18 tobacco company internal documents or tobacco company
19 advertisements because they were curious and wanted to
20 take a look at them?
21
22
23
24
25
A
I wouldn't know that, but they certainly
haven't done it at my request.
Q
You would not have asked them to do that,
right?
A
That's right.
United Reporting, Inc

relevant for purposes of your opinions, right?

And that's because you don't deem those things
A
Yes.
For determining general awareness, I do
not.
Q
As we sit here today, you cannot tell me when
6 Mr. Calloway began to either be a Sunday reader or a
7 daily reader, if he ever was one, of the Miami Herald,
8 right?
9
10
11
A
That's correct.
The depositions aren't clear
on that point.

I think I do.
What's the heading of the

Q
There is no heading.
It's within the
21 "Newspaper, Magazine and Periodicals" section, but
22 they're just loose documents.
23 A
24 Q
25
Okay.
One is "Cigarettes LA Times," the next one is
"Coffin Nails" --
United Reporting, Inc

2 Q
And they have individual dates, don't they?
Yes.
'64, 1920, 1964.
What are those materials?
3
I can go through
4 them one by one, but if they're a specific subset of
5 materials, it might make it a little easier.
6
A
I can say about them, as you can see there,
7 they vary by year.
8 indication of how the Times covered the '64 Surgeon
9 General's report.
The '64 LA Times simply was an
And if you see different dates, they
10 are how newspapers covered specific events or studies or
11 how they were talking about it in any given year.
12 If you give me another one of the headlines, I
13 might be able to recall it or I could look it up myself.
14
15
Q
One is from the Syracuse Herald.
Mr. Calloway
never lived in Syracuse, right?
16 A
17 Q
That's for sure.
And there's no indication at any point in time
18 he was ever exposed to the LA Times, Syracuse Herald, I
19 think one is called the Boy Magazine; is that right?
20
A
That's true.
These represent either national
21 or local coverage of the issue of -- of anti-smoking,
22 basically.
23
The Syracuse one, for example, is where you
24 have Dr. Horn commenting on how well informed the public
25 was at that point.
I think it's what the -- what's the
United Reporting, Inc

date on that one, the Syracuse one?
Q
2
3
It's okay, Dr. Hoff.
I didn't ask you any
question about it.
4
A
Well, you're asking questions, though, about
5 why this is relevant, and I can tell you why most of
6 them are relevant.
7
MS. BROWN:
Mr. Gdanski, that was the question
8 that you asked her.
9 question about why those materials were on her CD.
10
11
So I think she was responding to a
MR. GDANSKI:
I just asked if Mr. Calloway had
ever seen those papers.
Q
12
The second CD that I have that contains
13 materials that you reviewed is I guess titled "AV," and
14 I know that it contains video files.
15 with what I'm talking about?
16 A
17 Q
Are you familiar
Yes, I am.
Okay.
Did you add any additional video files
18 to this case since your last deposition in the Tullo
19 case?
That wasn't a very clear question.
For purposes of this case, did you add any
20
21
22
23
24
25
video files or media files to your reliance list?
A
I don't think so, but if you read the list to
me, I can probably tell you.
Q
There's a lot.
"Cartoons."
There's a folder called
Did you add any cartoons?

Did you add -- strike that.
advertisements?
7 A
8 Q
9
Did you add any movies?
Did you include any cigarette television
5
6
That remains the same.
Is there a category there that says that?
No.
I'm asking if that's included in this
case.
10 A
11 Q
No.
Let's say, for example, there was a television
12 show on TV -- because you have one called "Television,"
13 and one of the shows was Cheers, and you have an episode
14 called "My Fair Clavin."
15 about?
16
17
A
Do you know what I'm talking
I do in some cases.
What category is that
under?
18 Q
19 A
20 Q
"Television."
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
So this episode of Cheers, "My Fair
21 Clavin," are you familiar with that television clip that
22 you include on your reliance list?
23 A
24 Q
25
Yeah.
And you include it because you think it's
relevant obviously, right?
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 96
1
A
Well, I think it was just a popular program.
2 Again, given the fact that he -- the decedent would have
3 been watching television, he might have seen some of
4 these programs, yes.
5
6
7
Q
And did you include the whole entire episode
or just the portion that you thought relevant?
A
Usually it's just the portion relevant.
If
8 you look at Sanford and Son, for example, it's the
9 portions where they're talking about the son trying to
10
11
get the father to stop smoking.
Q
And so you don't know if any cigarette
12 commercials or commercials produced by the Tobacco
13 Institute or the TIRC or any tobacco spokesperson
14 agency, you don't know if any cigarette commercials
15 occurred during the commercial breaks on any of these
16 television shows; is that accurate?
17 MS. BROWN:
18 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
It's not really accurate because
19 it depends on the date.
20 after 1970 in any case '70, '71.
21 BY MR. GDANSKI:
22
Q
Okay.
There wouldn't have been any
For example, Password, did you include
23 the entire Password show or did you include just the
24 clip that you thought relevant?
25
A
Just the clip that's relevant.
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 97
1
Q
Okay.
You don't know what commercials there
2 were before, after or in between the clips that you
3 thought to be relevant, right?
4 A
5 Q
6
7
8
A
10 A
13
14
15
16
I'm asking you to refresh my memory.
What's
the date on that?
Q
12
Do you know the date of the clip that you
included?
9
11
What's the date on the Password?
It's 1963.
Okay.
I thought it might have been '68.
I didn't review the ads.
Q
Are you familiar with a clip that you've used
in the past from Password in 1968?
A
No.
I just couldn't recall the date of the
Password program.
Q
Okay.
So it's entirely possible that there
17 were cigarette advertisements on the Password program
18 and you just wouldn't have included those, right?
19 A
20 Q
That's correct.
Putting all that aside, for purposes of the
21 television materials, did you include any new ones in
22 this case or is it all the same as prior?
23
24
25
No,
A
I think it's all the same.
Again, would you
run through the list for me of the subtitles?
Q
Sure.

I simply came
16 across some and ultimately asked for specific ones or
17 were provided specific ones by Shook, Hardy & Bacon.

19 that's on your reliance list on your own or were some
20 supplied to you by Shook, Hardy & Bacon?

There are other shows that appeared on
10 television but they're not under the "Television"
11 subheading.

For example, one is "Cartoons."
Yes, but don't you also have CBS programs and
NBC programs, news programs there?

17 A
Yeah, that's under "News."
Okay.
Did you find the news programs on your own?
I found initially the news programs on my own,

19 Museum in New York City.
20 Q
21 A
22 Q
23
What other ones?
Well, the '55 and the '64, but you have ones
here from '68, '69, '77, '78, '79, '81, '83.

Did you do any research in this case
20 specifically with regard to the African-American
21 community and their awareness as a subgroup of American
22 population with regard to the health hazards of smoking?
23
A
I certainly had to think about it in this case
24 as I had to in the previous case I mentioned.
25 was one of the things I looked for in terms of the

1 reports of the American Cancer Society.
2 that organization did begin, in the late '70s and
3 primarily in the '80s, to concern itself with getting
4 more and better information out to the black community.
5 And obviously the research I did on Jet and Ebony and
6 Essence involved my thinking about how well informed the
7 community was.

Q
And they --
Would you agree that the African-American
community was not as well informed as the Caucasian
community on the health hazards of smoking?
A
I don't know if you could say they were not as
12 well informed.
13 smoking with respect, for example, to hypertension that
14 was more commonly seen in Ebony and Jet and Essence in
15 the '70s than the issue of lung cancer, per se.
16 late '70s, all of the magazines were considering this.
17
They were -- there was information about

And Essence, for example, as early as 1975 had
18 a lengthy article on smoking and pregnant black women,
19 and I reference that simply because Marvine Calloway
20 indicated in her testimony that she thought about and
21 ultimately did give up smoking because she was pregnant
22 with her child.
23
Q
On or around the same time in the mid '70s,
24 are you familiar with the CEO of Phillip Morris stating
25 on national television that some women prefer to have

Okay.
Under "PSAs and Educational Films," is
12 all of that material that you've used or relied upon in
13 the past or did you include anything specific for this
14 case?

I think if you look at the first maybe three
16 or four items there under "PSAs," they're exclusively
17 educational materials for schools.

That one is new as well.
And those four PSAs you just spoke of or

3
Q
Did you request them or were they just sent to
you for your review?
A
Well, because I was looking more closely at
4 the American Cancer Society activities and the PSAs they
5 put out, I requested additional PSAs just to refresh my
6 memory about what the PSAs might have looked like for
7 that time period.
8
9
Q
The other PSAs that you have on your list, did
you find them on your own or were they sent to you by
10 Shook, Hardy?
11 A
12 Q
13
They were sent to me by Shook, Hardy & Bacon.
Songs, you have about six songs on your list.
Were those sent to you by Shook, Hardy & Bacon?
14 A 15 Q Right.
16 A Yeah.
17 Q
18
Yes, they're all the same song.
"Smoke, Smoke That Cigarette"?
When did Mr. Calloway first become aware that
smoking cigarettes causes bladder cancer?
19 A
20 Q
I can't answer that.
Can you tell me specifically when Mr. Calloway
21 first became aware that smoking cigarettes has adverse
22 health consequences?
23
A
I think I can be more specific about that
24 because of the testimony of his son, Harry James, and
25 because of the testimony by his brother, Frank.
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
Do youPage 104
1
2
want me to detail that?
Q
Well, we'll go through that in a second.
3 But can you tell me specifically at what point
4 in time Mr. Calloway -- and as a result of what exposure
5 Mr. Calloway became aware that smoking cigarettes has
6 adverse health consequences?
7
A
Again, according to the testimony, it was as
8 early -- could have been as early as 1964 when he took
9 his son aside and indicated to him that cigarettes could
10 kill him, and he gave him a kind of simple demonstration
11 of blowing cigarette smoke into a handkerchief.
12
13
Q
unfiltered cigarette?
14 A
15 Q
16
Do you know if that was a filtered or
I have no idea.
Have you tracked down or traced what brand of
cigarette Mr. Calloway smoked at any given time?
17
A
It was almost impossible to do so from the
18 depositions.
19 various times that I really couldn't make much sense out
20 of it.
21
Q
He smoked so many different brands at
Have you made yourself aware or familiarized
22 yourself with the manufacturers of the different brands
23 of cigarettes that Mr. Calloway smoked over the course
24 of his life?
25
A
I am generally aware of the companies

And who makes Kool?
That I'm not sure -- I'm not sure about.
Who makes Salem?
Again, I'm not sure about the manufacturers.
10 I know the companies involved in this case, but there
11 were so many cigarettes, I just didn't try to pin them
12 all down.

15 Q
16 A
17 Q
Who makes Newport?
I don't know offhand.
Do you know who makes Marlboro?
Marlboro is Phillip Morris.
During the Tullo deposition, I asked you a
18 series of questions relating to the caution and warning
19 labels on cigarette packages, and you indicated you
20 couldn't tell me offhand what each of them were.

When did the second set go on?
'71.
What was contained in the second set?
Second set said, "Warning:
The Surgeon
General has determined that cigarette smoking is
hazardous to your health."
11 Q What was the first statement that went on?
12 A It said simply a caution that cigarette

smoking may be dangerous to your health.

What was the third set?
The third set consisted of rotating messages.
Do you know the four rotating messages?
One had to do with pregnancy, one had to do
with lung disease, one had to do with carbon monoxide.
Q
Did any of them say smoking cigarettes causes
bladder cancer?
A
Bladder cancer was not one of the diseases
listed in those rotating messages.
Q
Was cancer as a standalone disease unrelated
24 to a particular organ one of the diseases listed in the
25 rotating warnings?
United Reporting, Inc

2 Q
Well, lung cancer certainly was.
Right.
I'm asking -- in other words, there's
3 different types of cancers.
4 bladder cancer, kidney cancer, brain cancer.
5 lung cancer was on there.
6 any point in time smoking cigarettes causes cancer.
7

A
There's lung cancer,
So I know
I'm asking if it ever said at
I think it was more specific than that in the
rotating messages.
Q
Can you tell me the first time -- strike that.
Can you tell me if Mr. Calloway at any point
10
11 in his entire life was ever exposed to any public health
12 message that smoking cigarettes causes bladder cancer?
13 A

That he personally was?
Yes.
No, I can't.

2 A Oh, it's a reference to a black Broadway
3 performer.
4 that on Broadway, because of the cancer scare that
5 occurred in that decade, as of that year, she's saying
6 that actors on Broadway either stopped smoking or
7 stopped mooching cigarettes.
8 Q
9 A
10 Q
11
And what she's relating in that article is
Right.
"Mooching" is the word.
In the first line, I think you crossed out the
words "cigarette controversy"; is that right?
12
A
I didn't cross it out.
It's about the
13 cigarette controversy.
14 about what's happening on Broadway with respect to it.
Q
15
16

So this is meant to be underlining or crossing
out?
A
It's meant to be really basically an
underline.

It's not crossed out.

None whatsoever.

maybe four.

What did you talk about?
We went over the notice for the deposition in
13 terms of material that I had brought with me so that
14 they could copy it and send it on to you.
Q
15
16
What else did you do?
I can't imagine that
took four hours.
17
A
We generally talked about the case.
We went
18 over with Dawn in particular to make sure that I had all
19 the depositions because there were quite a few in the
20 case.
21
So we talked generally about the confusion,
22 for example, over whether he smoked filters or
23 non-filters and how many cigarettes -- cigarette brands
24 he smoked, generally trying to clear up some confusion
25 that I had after having read the depositions about the

he would smoke a filtered cigarette?

That what?
That there were periods in his life where he
would smoke a filtered cigarette?

Would you agree that for periods of his life,
Apparently so, yes.
Okay.
And you also agree that there were
periods of his life where he would smoke a light

Are you aware and familiar with any testimony
14 in this case that Mr. Calloway believed and, in fact,
15 told family members that the cigarettes he was smoking,
16 either filtered or lights, were a safer alternative to
17 unfiltered or non-light cigarettes?
18 MS. BROWN:
19 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Not in that specific fashion.
20 He I think referred -- it was said that he referred
21 several times to the fact that he thought the filters
22 were safer.

6 Q
Star, is it?
Yes.
I want to go -- on August 17th, you made a
7 call to St. Ruth Missionary Baptist Church and the First
8 Baptist Church of Southwest Broward and the
9 African-American Research Library and Cultural Center.
10
Do you see that?
11 A
12 Q
13 A
Yes, I do.
Why did you call those places?
Because I was -- in Marvine Calloway's
14 testimony, she indicated that she had obtained
15 information from bulletins from churches about these
16 tobacco cases.
17 churches, the Baptist churches preached against smoking
18 because it did bodily harm.
19
But also, she had indicated that the
So I made this call which turned out to be
20 futile to these various churches, and then to the
21 African-American Research and Library Center to see if
22 they had any of these church bulletins, which they did
23 not.
24
25
Q
Did you tell them who you were and what entity
you were doing research on behalf of?
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 123
1
A
No, I told them I was doing research on
2 tobacco and that I wanted to see if they had any of
3 these previous bulletins that would have been given out
4 to the parishioners.
5
Q
Are you going to offer any opinions in this
6 case relative to what the Calloways' family church or
7 religious organization's position was on smoking and
8 health at any point in time?
9 A
10 Q
Say the question again.
I didn't --
Are you going to offer any expert opinions in
11 this case on what the Calloway family's church or
12 religious organizations that they were affiliated with,
13 what those entities' positions were on smoking and
14 health at any point in time?
15
A
Only to the degree that I've just said, that
16 Marvine maintained that the Baptist churches that she
17 attended did oppose smoking.
18
Q
Right.
But you're not going to say, "And, in
19 fact, I know from researching the Baptist liturgy or
20 whatever that that was, in fact, their position," and
21 talk about it in that sense, are you?
22 MS. BROWN:
23 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Well, I know personally, though
24 I didn't research it professionally, that the Baptist
25 churches in general are against smoking.
United Reporting, Inc

BY MR. GDANSKI:
Q
Right.
But are you going to offer any opinion
3 about churches being against smoking from a professional
4 expert point of view in this case?
5 A
6 Q
No.
You also called the Mt. Olive Baptist Church.
7 I suppose that was for the same purposes as your call to
8 St. Ruth Missionary Church?
9
A
Yes.
It might have been my confusion on
10 exactly what churches she had attended, but I think it
11 ended up that the Mt. Olive Church was the main one.
12
13
Q
Then you flew to Kansas City on
September 15th; is that right?
14 A
15 Q
Yes.
How many times have you -- I think I asked you
16 this in the Tullo deposition, but I'm not sure because
17 they run together.
How many times have you been to the Kansas

19
20
21
City office of Shook, Hardy & Bacon?
A
I couldn't tell you offhand.
You mean total
number of times?

Yeah.

No, not more than 20.

or they were all to meet, review, talk?
A
I think they were all to meet and review.
I
don't think any deposition was taken in Kansas City.
Q
And is today your first time at the
San Francisco office of Shook?
A
No, I've -- in this office building it's the
13 first time because they've moved, but I was here before.
14 I was here at the offices.
15
Q
How many times have you been to the
16 San Francisco office, whatever location it was in, of
17 Shook, Hardy & Bacon unrelated to the actual taking of a
18 deposition like today?
19
20
21
A
I don't know because I would have been here
before 2001 on a couple of California cases.
Q
So other than times that you were physically
22 in the office to give a deposition, you think you've
23 been to the California, San Francisco office of Shook,

She no longer uses that e-mail address, but it
is the woman in Florida.

10
11
Who is Shame@netzero.net?
Okay.
What was she sending you?
Her scans
from October 1990?
12
A
Yeah.
She sent me a series -- this is a
13 representative sample -- a number of scans from her
14 research on the Miami Herald.

15
16
Then you just go ahead and forward that later
on that evening to Ms. Thompson; is that right?

Dr. Hoff printed out an example of

10 through and print out every example of this kind of
11 thing.

16 the court ruled on any disputed issue, all of the
17 e-mails, whether you sent them to the research
18 assistants or whether the research assistants sent them
19 to you so I can take a look at all those e-mails to see
20 what assignments were given, if any, the scope of the
21 assignments, the language used in the assignments,
22 responses from them perhaps.
23
I'm not going to
I'm going to keep it open

7 that's why I didn't bother to bring them.

MS. BROWN:
And Mr. Gdanski, she wasn't
informed ahead of time because we're working off the

2 that appear on her reliance list?
3
I mean, for example, the e-mails that you're
4 looking at, I don't have them in front of me, but
5 they -- from what I gather from the testimony, they're
6 just simply a forwarding of, you know, an e-mail with an
7 article to the Shook offices which has no substance to
8 the e-mail other than simply forwarding an item that's
9 on her reliance list.

A
She was his daughter who visited him while he
7 was in Florida, and she testifies that he told her not

Is that the only aspect of the deposition that
is significant to you?

12 it.

14 the information.

16 told her that, she already knew about the health hazards
17 of smoking.

I could refer to the deposition or my notes if you

And, of course, her attitude toward

1960s and '70s were sponsored by tobacco companies?
A
No, I don't really retain that information.
I've read which ones, but I don't have it in my head.
Q
Would you agree that the depositions reflect
23 that Mr. Calloway smoked more cigarettes as he aged,
24 more cigarettes per day as he got older?
25
A
He seemed to have smoked more cigarettes after
United Reporting, Inc

2 think, or testified, that she thought he only was

4 '72 and into the '80s, he seems to be smoking much more
5 heavily.

Q
But by the time he remarries in
For how many years had Johnny Calloway been
7 smoking at the time the first Surgeon General's report
8 came out?
9
A
I don't know.
You'd have to calculate it.

I perhaps expected more from it than

I'm sorry.
Her deposition is significant to
you because she helped Marvine fill out legal papers?
3
A
Well, it's only significant to that degree.
4 She, for example, indicates that she really didn't
5 discuss with the decedent the hazards of smoking even
6 though I thought that as a registered nurse she might
7 have.
8 this lawsuit itself was to both encourage and then to
9 help Marvine fill out the papers.

And she simply -- her function, it would seem, in

Are you going to offer any opinions in this
11 case about who encouraged Marvine to file a lawsuit, who
12 helped her fill out papers, anything of that sort?
13 A
14 Q
Beyond what I've just said, no.
I understand that you just told me that within
15 the deposition of Marvine Calloway's sister, she
16 discussed the fact that she helped her fill out papers.
17 I'm asking if you're going to offer any expert opinion
18 in this case regarding that.
19 A No.
20 Q Okay.
21 A
You asked me what the significance of the
22 deposition was, and that's the only significance I could
23 perceive in it.
24
25
Q
So for purposes of your opinions in this case,
that deposition was not significant to you; is that

A
It wasn't as significant as some of the other
3 depositions, like his brother, Frank, or his son, Harry
4 James.
5

I understand.
That's fine.

Q
Dr. Hoff, can you tell me, please, what your
opinions are that you plan to offer in this case?
A
Yes; that very specific to this case, after
23 having read the depositions, that the educational
24 background of Johnny Calloway indicated that the school
25 system in Missouri did provide adequate information on
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 141
1 tobacco and smoking for -- at least through the tenth
2 grade where he attended, and that, again, given the fact
3 that he read so many different newspapers -- I
4 researched them very carefully -- and what's I think
5 important about the research I did in newspapers is that
6 he went from Missouri where the Hattiesburg American
7 informed him a bit about the newspapers (sic), but what
8 really happened when he got to Florida is that he
9 entered a newspaper arena with the Miami Herald and the
10 Sun Sentinel and Fort Lauderdale papers, both of which
11 were what I consider to be quite progressive on the
12 issue of the health hazards of smoking.
13 mean they both took the issue up seriously.
14 had a number of editorials that supported anti-smoking
15 campaigns.
16 and Fort Lauderdale paper which reported extensively on
17 the smoke-outs beginning in the late 1970s.
18
And by that, I
They both
It was particularly true of the Sun Sentinel
But even more important perhaps was that the
19 Miami Herald, as the sort of statewide newspaper,
20 carried as much information in my opinion on the risks
21 of smoking and on the addictive nature of cigarettes and
22 on the scientific studies which were coming out in the
23 '50s -- really four or five years after he began
24 smoking -- it carried as many articles and carried as
25 much information in my opinion as the New York Times.
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
IPage 142

was a little surprised by the extent of the coverage.
For example, if he had been reading the Miami
3 Herald in 1964 in January, he could have read over 100
4 articles in that single month on the 1964 study, the
5 Surgeon General's study.
6
So in terms of my opinion then, looking at his
7 reading habits, his educational background, and what
8 I've already indicated, of course, was in national
9 publications, I came to the conclusion that he was
10
indeed on his own aware of the problems with smoking.
11 But more particularly, in the testimony of his
12 son, which I've already indicated as of 1964 he gave the
13 son a demonstration about cigarettes and told him they
14 could kill him, but in particular, in the testimony of
15 his brother, Frank, Frank apparently had seen some of
16 the PSAs which appeared on television and discussed one
17 of them directly with his brother Johnny.
18
In that particular testimony, you find Frank
19 indicating that he told Johnny that indeed cigarettes
20 could kill him and them both, and that Johnny at that
21 point in time, in the mid '60s, agreed.
22
And that testimony alone indicated to me that
23 through his reading and through his family testimony,
24 that Johnny Calloway was aware of the health hazards of
25 smoking and obviously aware of the fact that even though
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 143
1 he told Frank he would quit, he never did -- he smoked
2 even after his bypass surgery -- that he, for all
3 intents and purposes, had been made aware then of the
4 information about the health risks of smoking, and
5 actually had passed that information on in some cases to
6 his son and daughter.
Q
7
Are you going to comment on the attempt made
8 by Mr. Calloway to quit smoking over the course of his
9 life?
10
A
They were very -- only referenced very
11 briefly.
12 systematically attempted to stop smoking.

14 Mitchell, indicates that he did.

And what year did Frank recall seeing the PSA
and talking to his brother?
A
It was difficult to know exactly what year.
17 The closest I was able to come from reading the

19 have been -- could have been as late as '68, it could

The
4 Surgeon General reports came out every year, and I think
5 you have definite references to bladder cancer in the
6 Surgeon General's report for 1979, which would have been
7 under Surgeon General Richmond because Joseph Califano,
8 who was head of HEW at the time, publicized it a lot.
9
And then when Surgeon General Koop comes in in
10 the '80s, one of his first Surgeon General's reports
11 covers every possible disease that might occur as a
12 result of cigarette smoking, and bladder cancer was

There was a report in 1978.
This is the
11 one that he was associated with.
12 that actually indicated all of the things I've just
13 said.
14
And it was a report
And the tobacco representatives were so put
15 out with his attitude towards smoking that they didn't
16 comment on the report, but they commented on his
17 personality, and that he was a zealot on this -- in this
18 instance, and that the Richmond report, Surgeon General
19 report, really didn't carry anything new.
20
But they attacked Califano personally because
21 they felt he was not unbiased in representing the
22 cabinet position he held.
23 Q
And they attacked him publicly in the public
24 press, right?
25 A
Yes.
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221Page 147

Q
And those public attacks, they maintained that
2 smoking cigarettes had not yet been adequately proven to
3 cause any adverse health consequence, right?
4
A
They didn't concentrate as much on that as

6 unbiased representative of the issue.

Mr. Califano's statements on smoking and health, right?
