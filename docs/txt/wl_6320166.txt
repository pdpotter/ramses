3Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A I asked for all of the depositions I asked for the complaint that had been filed by the plaintiff. I asked for any interrogatories
that had been filed either initially or in consortium.
Q Anything else that you asked for?
A No.
Q Was that first meeting by phone or was it in person?
A By phone.
Q Prior to that first contact, had you received any written materials concerning the Ferlanti case from anybody?
A No.
Q How long did that conversation with Mr. Ball last on that first occasion?
A Relatively briefly. Maybe three or four minutes.

Q Let me stop you there Who gave you those materials? Who sent you those materials?

Q Mr. Ball sent you those.
A Yes.
Q Please continue.
A After I received those, I indicated, that I had finished the materials and that I was prepared to do research with respect to
this case.

MR. FEIWUS: Objection.

4Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
THE WITNESS: I had no opinions at the time. I asked that in looking through the life of Mr. Ferlanti that there would be
materials that I had collected that I would rely upon in terms of my opinions, and I asked Mr. Ball to facilitate in the reproduction
of any of these materials so that they might be available for this case.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q These materials -- first of all, let me ask you this, what did you understand Mr. Ball to want you to do in the Ferlanti case?
MR. FEIWUS Objection.
THE WITNESS: As I understood, he asked me to look at the particular materials that I had requested, the depositions, and
to ascertain whether or not I was willing to do research to ascertain the extent to which Mr. Ferlanti had been exposed to the
widely disseminated information during the course of his lifetime about the health risks of smoking.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So you understood from your first conversation with Mr. Ball that what he was interested in knowing was whether or not you
were willing to serve as an expert witness regarding smoking and health information and how it might relate to Mr. Ferlanti?
MR. FEIWUS Objection.
THE WITNESS That is correct, provided, of course, that I found that there were materials in that time period to which Mr.
Ferlanti would have been exposed in terms of widely publicly disseminated materials.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q You used the words materials to which Mr. Ferlanti was exposed.
A That is correct.
Q And I want you to tell me, sir, what you mean by exposed.
A In other words, during his lifetime, during the course of his daily activities, there would be materials concerning newspapers,
magazines, television, movies, educational materials that were part of his culture to which he would be exposed by virtue of
having lived during that period.
Q Do you mean when you say “exposed to,” that these are things that Mr. Ferlanti would have seen?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Not necessarily. I have no way of knowing that.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q In fact, sir, you don't know what in fact Mr. Ferlanti himself personally saw, is that correct?
A Only that information to which the deponent and his family indicated that he may have been exposed to That is correct.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
5Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q And only to the extent that they say that he may have seen a particular item, is that the only way you would know that Mr.
Ferlanti saw that item?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And did you understand that you were being asked to determine what Mr. Ferlanti had learned during his lifetime or at any
specific time in his life about any health hazards associated with cigarette smoking?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: The answer to that is, no “Learned” is a word that is not the one that I would use. I would say exposed to.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And I'm trying to understand the difference So correct me if I'm wrong, what I think I understand you to be saying is “exposed”
means that there may have been information that may have been available, but you have no information to know whether or
not Mr. Ferlanti saw that information, number one.
A That is correct.
Q And, number two, you have no information to know what Mr. Ferlanti may have believed to be accurate about any health
hazards associated with cigarette smoking. Is that true?
A Only to the extent that the deponent indicated what he believed.
Q So you're relying solely upon his family members as to what Mr. Ferlanti may or may not have believed about the health
hazards associated with cigarette smoking.
A In terms of belief, yes In terms of exposure, only apart from the family, apart from the environment to which he lived in.
Q So that's what you understood your assignment was going to be from, at least the time after you got the depositions, the
complaint, and the interrogatories.
MR. FEIWUS: Object to the form.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q That you accepted that assignment and you understood what it was.
A No. Not until I read all the materials, the interrogatories, the complaint and the depositions.
Q That's what I meant to say After you reviewed all those materials, then you accepted that assignment to do further research
regarding the issue that we talked about.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
6Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A Yes And that is the issue of whether or not and to what extent Mr. Ferlanti was exposed to the health risks of smoking during
the course of his lifetime.
Q What was your next contact with any attorney or anyone from their offices concerning the Ferlanti case?
A I met with Mr. Feiwus on January 12, 2005.
Q You met with Mr. Feiwus then in person?
A Yes.
Q Where did you-all meet?
A We met in New York.
Q At his office?
A At his office, yes, and Mr. Ball was also present.
Q Was anybody else there?
A No.
Q Did you understand at the time that Philip Morris was not a defendant in the Ferlanti case?
A I did.
Q You had seen the complaint by then.
A I had read the complaint and I had seen that, yes, sir.
Q Do you know why Mr. Ball was present at the meeting with Mr. Feiwus?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I asked Mr. Ball, since he would be the facilitator of the documents that I would need, to be present at that
particular meeting.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q You say Mr. Ball was the facilitator of the documents Can you tell me what -- strike that You had done previous research
in the area of smoking and health in other tobacco cases, correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That's correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
7Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q And during the process of going through and doing that research you had collected a lot of documents.
A That is correct.
Q And those documents were stored somewhere I assume.
A Yes.
Q Where were they stored?
A Some were stored in my house Some were stored at Johnson, Tyler & Purvis.
Q When you say Mr. Ball being a facilitator of those documents, are you talking about the documents that were being held
at the Purvis office?
A Documents that I had reviewed in prior cases or I had reviewed before I had ever done any deposition or trial work, and
which I had reviewed and which they served as a repository for it The Johnson, Tyler & Purvis law firm was a repository, a
library, and, as a library, one of many which I visited over the years, they had, of course, the facility for storing these for me.
Q And, in fact, they had collected, over the years, a number of the articles involving smoking and health before they ever
retained you in 1995.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection Lack of foundation.
THE WITNESS: They had as had I When they first contacted me in 1995, I had already done substantial work in this field In
fact, my work predated that of Johnson, Tyler & Purvis.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q But you had not yet begun the task of collecting and copying specific articles or books relating to cigarette smoking and
health as it was -- let's just leave it there Had you begun that process before 1995?
A Well, before 1995.
Q Why were you collecting those before 1995?
A Because I taught social history of the United States Social history of the United States is a field dealing with the ordinary
American everyday life, and I was one of the few professors to have initiated this field in the early 1960's.
Q So what had you collected? What newspapers had you surveyed before 1995?
A I had written several articles dealing with the issue of the health risks of smoking historically.
Q If you could, it would help us, doctor, if you don't mind, when I'm asking a question if you could answer it, and the question
I'm asking you right now is specifically what newspaper had you surveyed prior to 1995 concerning smoking and health issues?
A New York Times.
Q When did you do a survey of the New York Times concerning smoking and health for the first time?

8Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A Smoking and health, which were related to other issues, not solely on smoking and health, but everyday life, which included
smoking and health I began that when I received my first sabbatical from the American University in 1972, spring of 1972, for
a manuscript that would later be developed into a book.
Q Did you undertake the same methodology back in 1972 of reviewing each and every newspaper at the New York Times
for some period of time to ascertain each and every article in that newspaper concerning smoking and health? Did you begin
that type of analysis in 1972?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I did.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q For what years did you do that?
A I did it from the years of Franklin Roosevelt's administration from March 4, 1933 until his death on April 12, 1945.
Q So you were reviewing the New York Times during that period of time for their information on smoking and health.
A In addition to other topics Remember, I was dealing with the history of everyday life, and of that segment, smoking and
health was part of it.
Q And did you publish anything regarding that research?
A I published, subsequently, several articles that were derivative from that research in newspapers I also published a textbook
that was published in 1991. I also published a trade book in 1987 that had a chapter dealing with tobacco, as well as references
to it throughout, and I did, subsequently, a film for the University of Notre Dame in 1996, which dealt in part with the issue
of smoking risks or the health risks of smoking.
Q What conclusions did you reach in your textbook concerning smoking and health in the 1991 textbook that you had written?
A I had three references to smoking and health in that textbook, which was designed for high school students. In that textbook,
I referenced King James' counterblast for tobacco, which was published in 1604 in which he criticized tobacco in terms of its
adverse effect on the lungs.
Q Did you find any references as to the this King James counterblast in the New York Times newspaper that you were
researching in the period from 1933 to 1945?
A To the best of my knowledge, yes, there were references. This is a widely disseminated early work on the health risks of
smoking.
Q Can you tell me which one of those newspaper articles referenced King James?
A I cannot, but there were articles dealing with tobacco and I don't know which ones.
Q I wasn't asking about articles that dealt with tobacco I was asking about articles which specifically referenced the King James
counterblast, I believe, you referred to it as.

9Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A Right.
Q I want to know if you saw it in the New York Times newspaper between the years 1933 and 1945, references to that, and
where you saw them.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection. I think that was asked and answered.
MR. REYES: He objects a lot.
THE WITNESS: And the answer is I did recall it. To the best of my knowledge, I recall it. On which issue, I don't know.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q What other references did you make to tobacco in your 1991 text?
A These texts, the references to tobacco was also made with regard to the distribution and selling of tobacco and advertising for
tobacco in the late 19th century, and, in particular, cigarettes, in which there was a cartoon in Pub Magazine, which advertised
cigarettes as “Sure Death Cigarettes”.
Q And that was in your 1991 text?
A That is correct.
And, finally, I made a reference to a famous first, which had never occurred, to my knowledge, in the history of the United
States, and that is the Surgeon General's Report of 1964, which was the first time that the Surgeon General of the United States
had disseminated widely a public health report.
Q And what did you say about the Surgeon General's Report in your 1991 text?
A I indicated that it was a widely distributed book for the first time by the Public Health Service on smoking and health risks.
Q How did you know it was widely disseminated?
A Because I had done the research.
Q What research?
A I had done research in terms of the period of 1964, as I wrote that textbook, to make sure it was.
Q Tell me specifically where did you research to find out how widely disseminated the Surgeon General's Report was?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I looked, for example, in terms of the New York Times and other newspapers and magazines, which indicated
how many copies were sold, where it was distributed Matters of that sort.
BY MR. VENABLE:

10Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q How many copies were sold?
A Actually, it was a best seller, I believe in the range of approximately 300,000 as I recall.
Q Where were they distributed?
A Every physician in the United States was sent a copy according to the Surgeon General, Luther Terry, of that particular book
Plus it was sold for a dollar and twenty-five cents at the Government Printing Office.
Q How many were sold by the Government Printing Office to the public at large?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: To the best of my knowledge, about 300,000.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Where did you get that figure from?
A From the New York Times and other corroborating newspapers that did stories on it.
Q Where in the New York Times did it say that there were 300,000 copies sold?
A In subsequent editions published after January 11, 1964.
Q You don't know which ones.
A No, I do not.
Q You didn't bother to make notes on the work that you were doing”?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: None at the time, I did not. That's all publicly available material. It can be easily researched.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q It can be easily researched where we would find a statement in the New York Times that 300,000 copies of the Surgeon
General's Report were sold?
A You can go back to the period of 1964 and look at those newspapers, as I did, and if you do a search, either through the index,
which is published and in print, or if you do an on-line search and you attach key words, you can find out how many copies
were sold, and, to the best of my knowledge, that is the figure that I recall.
Q And you are certain that that was in the New York Times.
A I'm reasonably certain that there was reference to the number of copies sold, yes, sir.
Q Any other references in your 1991 text to cigarettes and health?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
11Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A No.
Q How about in your 1987 text?
A That book had a chapter on early American tobacco, a particular tobacco planter by the name of William Bird, II.
Q Any references in that chapter concerning smoking and health?
A Yes. There was a reference in which Mr. Bird believed that smoking was very helpful and beneficial, and it was a view that
Virginia planters tried to promote during the 16th and 17th centuries.
Q How did you come to the conclusion that Mr. Bird believed that smoking was very healthy?
A He left a diary. The diary was published I looked at the diary and examined it, as historians do, with respect to contemporary
worth.
Q Where is that diary located?
A You can buy it You can actually go on line and you can ask for it on amazon com You can go to the library.
Q It's available in the libraries?
A Yes. It's the diary of William Bird, II of Westover.
Q Any particular library you found it in?
A I own it I own the book I bought the book.
Q Do you have it here with you?
A. No, I do not.
Q You said something about Virginia planters What did you say about that?
A He was a Virginia planter.
Q You said something else about Virginia planters in general.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I indicated that he was a Virginia planter who represented the view of other Virginia planters that tobacco was
beneficial. It should be used as an antidote to bad air in the house. That it was useful in terms of dealing with certain diseases.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q How did you know that he was a spokesman for other Virginia planters?
A Because he referenced others.

12Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q Referenced in what way?
A In his diary.
Q In what way so we would know that he was speaking for other people?
A He indicated that indeed “My associates, my fellow planters,” and I believe there were words to that effect or reasonable
inferences to that effect.
Q And you accepted Mr. Bird's view of what other planters thought?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I only accepted it to the extent that indeed he indicated it. I could not corroborate it, but it wasn't necessary
for the purpose of the chapter that I was writing because it focused primarily on Mr. Bird.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q You took Mr. Bird's word for it in his diary.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I reiterated his words That is correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q What else was in your 1987 text concerning smoking and health?
A I believe there was a reference to James Buchanan Duke and the attempt on the part of Duke to promote his product, but
I believe that was it.
Q The Surgeon General's Report that you referenced in your 1991 text, you didn't find that referenced in the New York Times
research that you had done concerning the period of 1933 to 1945, correct?
A No, of course not. When I did my research for the textbook, I updated it to include, of course, sources other than those.
Q And the references to “Sure Death Cigarettes,” did you see those in the New York Times? Did you see that reference in the
New York Times from the period of 1933 to 1945?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No I found that in magazines in the appropriate period.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And the Bird diary, did you see references to that in the New York Times research that you did from 1993 to 1945?
A No. I had already bought that book and used it in classes long before I started that work.

13Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q I'm trying to understand You told me initially that this research that you did at the New York Times in 1972 for the period
of 1993 to 1945 was research you were doing for your textbooks, and I'm trying to find out where that was utilized in your
textbooks Can you tell me again, sir?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That was one area. You asked, I believe, for areas I have not finished all the areas where I had done research
prior to my meeting with Mr. Purvis.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I'm just trying to get to this one.
A I used that particular research from 1993 to 1945 and the part of my textbook dealing with everyday life in America during
those years.
Q And we've identified each and every reference in those textbooks having to do with smoking and health, have we not”?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: To the best of my knowledge, there were references to the period from 1933 to 1945 in terms of everyday
life, but there were no references specifically on cigarettes in that chapter.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Before you met with Mr. Purvis in 1995, you had done the work on the New York Times What else had you done?
A I had done work in terms of old books that I had collected, such as Horatio Alger books I collected over the years some 5,000
books and magazines, and I had done work on collecting those magazines for columns that I would write for various newspapers.
Q Were those books and magazines collected specifically regarding their content concerning smoking and health?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No. Sometimes they were dealing with other topics, such as education, and in the midst of those particular
books, you would find references to smoking and health risks.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So you didn't collect those books or magazines as part of some research project on smoking and health. That's my question.
A No. I collected those as a research project on everyday life of ordinary Americans, which would encompass many, many
topics, including recreation, what people ate, what kind of medicines they took, what they did with respect to their leisure time,
and smoking was part of that.
Q What other research had you done prior to being contacted in 1995 concerning smoking and health?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
14Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A I had written several articles for newspapers. I believe there was an article in the New York Times that I did on the early
20th century and women smoking.
Q Let me stop you there, if you don't mind What did you say about women smoking in the New York Times article that you
authored?
A There was a law that New York passed that prevented women from smoking in public, and that led to some discussion of
the risks of smoking.
Q What comments did you make about the risks of smoking in that article?
A I don't recall that I merely pointed out that this was, at the time, a concern.
Q When was that published in the New York Times?
A I don't recall It can be readily accessed by looking at the New York Times index, but sometime, I believe, in the 1980's.
Q Can I reference it under your name?
A You can I think it's called “No If's, And's or But's”.
Q What other research on smoking and health had you done prior to meeting with Mr. Purvis?
A I had written several other articles on the history of tobacco with a reference to smoking and health I think the one that Mr.
Purvis saw was in USA Today in July of 1995.
Q What did you publish in USA Today in 1995?
A There's an article on the Food & Drug Administration and their attempt to regulate tobacco products more than already had
been the case.
Q What did you write about concerning the FDA's attempt to regulate tobacco products?
A That's publicly available to the best of my knowledge. I pointed out how early Americans looked at tobacco in a very critical
light in terms of its effort and its health effects.
Q When you say early Americans, how early, what time frame?
A 18th and 19th centuries.
Q And you believe Mr. Purvis saw that article and that's what led him to contact you?
A That's what he indicated.
MR. FEIWUS: Would you read the last question back.
(Thereupon, the last question was read back).
MR. FEIWUS: I just want to state an objection to that previous question.

BY MR. VENABLE:
Q When you went to research the New York Times newspaper in the period 1993 to 1945, did you make copies of various
articles?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, I did not It was very expensive and we did not have in those years, in 1972, we did not have copy facilities.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So you just looked at them and made notes on them?
A I made notes and those notes were incorporated into the material I just indicated to you.
Q You told me that Mr. Ball was present at your meeting with Mr. Feiwus on, I believe you said, January 12th of this year --.
A Yes.
Q -- and that he was there because he could facilitate certain documents that may be in the repository at his law firm. Is that
correct?
A Facilitate I find it useful to be able to deal with one person as opposed to the many lawyers who are involved in litigation. From
reading the depositions, it's clear that Clarke, Silverglat has a role here, another firm here I found that in my prior experience to
be very difficult to work under so many different umbrellas So Mr. Ball, Johnson Tyler & Purvis, could serve in that function.
Q And you copied certain documents involving smoking and health and you had those documents sent to the Purvis law firm
for storage, is that correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No. That's not correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q How did they get there?
A From my previous research that I began in 1995 I had gone through documents and they were able to provide me with
documents that I needed, and I had gone through those and they were part of their repository.
Q Have you ever visited their law firm?
A Oh, yes, many times.
Q They have a big repository of documents, don't they?
A Indeed they do.

Q And it's a good source of information for you to review concerning issues regarding smoking and health.
A It's one of many sources It's one It's not the only one It's one source, but I have to verify that information because it is paid
for by tobacco companies with independent research. So I verify that information in other repositories.
Q So they have some copies of newspaper articles in that repository, correct?
A That is correct.
Q And if you need copies of the New York Times, for instance, for a particular case, you can request copies be made from
that repository and sent for that particular case.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Is that fair?
A That is correct I would add the caveat that I had gone through the New York Times, in addition to their having collected it, on
my own initiative So I have done a double check, in other words, to make certain that my independence as a researcher is clear.
Q Did you go through any particular newspaper and make a new set of copies of all of these articles or did you spot check
the articles?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: It depends On some of these articles, for example, I had not done much research and so I needed research to
be done by individuals who are assistants to me in the past to do that research, and so in that instance I asked that that research
be done and that I audit their results.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I want to start with the New York Times so I can keep it all straight, and I know there were other papers. Have you personally
yourself sat down and have reviewed for some period of time all of the articles that appeared in the New York Times? Have
you done that? Have you surveyed that paper, you yourself personally?
A Yes, I have.
Q What period of time did you yourself sit down looking at the microfiche --.
A No Not microfiche. That's an incorrect term.
Q You didn't look at microfiche at the New York Times.
A Microfilm. Totally different.
Q I'm sorry. You looked at microfilm at the New York Times?
A Microfilm of the New York Times.

17Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q Microfilm of the New York Times.
A Not of the New York Times.
Q Where was the microfilm located?
A At the Library of Congress And I might add also, at other repositories, because it's often very difficult at the Library of
Congress to use their microfilm readers because they're so heavily used. So I used several repositories for looking at the New
York Times and other newspapers, and I personally went through the New York Times for periods of time --.
Q If you don't mind, let me ask a question, because I think I'm straight now You went to the Library of Congress.
A Yes.
Q You sat down at a booth. Is there a booth there that you can look at the microfilm?
A There is no booth There is a little cubicle.
Q You sat down at a cubicle, requested microfilm, put it in the machine Did you turn it?
A You turn it. Some of the pewer versions are just a bottom.
Q And it goes on the screen page by page of the newspaper.
A That's correct.
Q At the Library of Congress, when did you go there to do this?
A Well, I began doing that in October of 1995, and I did that for various newspapers. I started with the New York Times.
Q Excuse me, sir. I just want to know when you started that at the Library of Congress.
A October, 1995.
Q October, 1995 you went to the Library of Congress At that time, did you begin your review of the New York Times?
A I began the review of newspapers, I believe it was the New York Times, but it may have been -- well, I started with newspapers.
I'm not certain if that paper was the first one. It may have been the Washington Post, but I began a review of several newspapers
and the New York Times was one of them.
Q So you might not have started with the New York Times in October of ‘95, but shortly thereafter you began some review
of the New York Times at the Library of Congress.
A And others.
Q And others, I understand, but the New York Times is the one I'm trying to get at first.
A Absolutely.

18Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q For what years did you personally load the microfilm and review it for the New York Times in October and November of
1995?
A Well, I can't recall the specific years, but I have looked at the New York Times during the period from 1950 until approximately
1965, and I did that over a period of several years.
Q Several years?
A Yes.
A And I may not have done all of the years in that time period, but I looked at several years at the time, maybe in groups of
three, depending upon the news of the particular time. There were critical times during which information relating to the health
risks of smoking were published. So those may have dictated, of course, the starting points and the ending points.
Q Did you pick and choose as you went to the New York Times as to which pages to read?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q You would read each and every page of the New York Times when you did that work?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Absolutely.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Did you, for instance, would you include the sports page --.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q -- to make sure there was nothing in there about smoking and health?
A Absolutely.
Q And classified ads?
A Indeed.
Q Cover to cover, the New York Times every page you read.

19Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
THE WITNESS: That is correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And you did that for the period between 1950 and 1965.
A I did that for the period from 1965 for various years. I may have omitted certain years as I indicated to you before, but I
did that in terms of that era.
Q Well, between 1950 and 1965, can you tell me which years you omitted?
A No, I cannot, because I also had the assistance of other people to do that.
Q I'm trying to find out what you did first and then I'll get to your assistants. Do you know which years you personally omitted
during the period of 1950 to 1965?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection Asked and answered.
THE WITNESS: I do not.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Did you have assistants that helped you with the New York Times?
A Yes.
Q Who were those assistants?
A My wife, Dr. Mallory V. DiBacco. Jeff Jeche, J-E-C-H-E, and Shirley Allen.
Q Did anybody else help you with the New York Tmes?
A Not to my knowledge at this point.
Q I assume that each of these people were being compensated for their time.
A Yes.
Q And who was compensating your wife for her time?
A Could be the tobacco companies through Johnson, Tyler & Purvis.
Q Who was compensating Mr. Jeche?
A I believe Johnson, Tyler & Purvis.
Q And Shirley Allen?
A I believe Johnson, Tyler & Purvis.

20Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q I assume that you asked your wife if she would assist you in this I assume you knew her and you asked her to help you out.
A Indeed I did She has a doctorate. I did.
Q I understand.
Did you contact these other people to see if they would help out or how did they get involved in this?
A I knew from talking to Johnson, Tyler & Purvis that they had researchers whom they had trained and used over the years,
and I asked that I have the availability of assistants, just as I have graduate students in the university assist me in research, and
they supplied me with these two individuals.
Q When did they start working as your assistants?
A I don't recall when In terms of the dates, it was a long time ago, but they have worked with me over many years of this,
including this case, so I cannot designate to you the specific times when they had worked, but they have worked over the several
cases I've been involved in.
Q They've been your assistants on most of the cases in which you've been involved so far?
A Yes.
Q Where do they live? I assume your wife lives with you.
A She does, yes.
Q Where do your other assistants live?
A I believe they live in Washington.
Q Do they have offices at the Purvis law firm?
A I don't know if they have offices, but they are, to the best of my knowledge, employed by them.
Q Were there any other assistants that you ever had assist you in any other papers?
A Oh, yes In fact, I've had professors assist me.
Q Which ones?
A I had a professor at Florida State University. His names escapes me right now He assisted me. One at Louisiana State
University This was during another case.
I had a professor at Florida Atlantic University That was Professor Mark Rose. I had graduate students at Florida State University
when I did research at the Florida State University Library Several of them.
Q Did Professor Graham assist you in any of the research?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
21Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A No.
Q How did you come to have these professors assist you? Did you contact them and ask for their assistance?
A No I asked Johnson, Tyler & Purvis They had some names. I asked them to assist and they found additional ones.
Q So they were hired by the Purvis law firm?
A I don't think “hired” is the correct term I think they were engaged as consultants.
Q They were being paid.
A They were being paid. That's correct.
Q Does Michael Shaler, by any chance, right a bell?
A No. I know Michael, but he was not involved in that.
Q How about Lacy Ford?
A No Lacy was not involved in this.
Q You know Otis Graham, correct?
A I talked to him. I don't know him personally.
Q Tell me how you came to talk to Mr. Graham.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: He wrote a book called “The Old Progressives and the New Deal” I've used that book in one of my classes. I
came to talk to him, maybe, over that book, and then I eventually also talked to him because I knew that he was also engaged
in research for tobacco litigation.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q When did you talk to him after you knew that he was engaged in research on tobacco issues?
A I think I had one conversation with him several years ago.
Q It's 2005. Was it five years ago?
A I would say it's probably been three or four years to the best of my memory.
Q What did you discuss with him?
A I discussed his book. I discussed his leaving the University of California. I did not discuss tobacco litigation, except for the
fact that I knew he might be involved, and that's it.

22Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q Did you ask him if he was involved?
A I think he indicated that.
Q Did he explain to you the nature of his involvement?
A No.
Q Did you understand that he was doing research in the area of smoking and health?
A I assumed that to be the case.
Q Did you assume that he was doing basically the same thing that you were doing?
A I assumed that as well.
Q Did you discuss with him the possibility of comparing your research?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Did you discuss with him any of the opinions that he had been able to formulate regarding his research?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Did he indicate to you that he was also sharing the repository at the Purvis law firm as a source of information regarding
smoking and health?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: He was indicating that he had been asked by the law firm to engage in research and that was the extent of it.
So I assumed that he would have some relation to the firm.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And you had been doing it longer than he had been doing it, correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I don't know that I don't know whether he was involved in earlier cases or not before 1995 So I don't know.

Q Michael Shaler?
A I met Michael and knew that he was involved in tobacco litigation.
Q Where does he live, do you know?
A I believe he teaches in the west, the University of Arizona, Arizona State I'm not sure.
Q Did you meet him at the Purvis law firm?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I met him at a restaurant in Washington near the Purvis law firm as I recall.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Was Mr. Ball there?
A No. I don't recall Mr. Ball.
Q Was Mr. Purvis there?
A He may have been, yes.
Q He was there?
A To the best of my knowledge, he may have been there, yes. There would be a representative, but I don't know if it was Mr.
Ball or Mr. Purvis I think it was Mr. Purvis.
Q What was the purpose of you meeting Mr. Shaler?
A Conversation. He was another historian who was engaged in research. Merely to meet him I had never met him before, and
it was just a restaurant meeting.
Q Was he already engaged in the research when you met him?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I don't know the extent to which that was true.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q What year was this?
A Again, a few years ago. I would say two or three years ago, maybe longer, to the best of my recollection.
Q Do you know if he was considering whether or not to engage in this research at the time that you had these discussions with
him or that he had already been retained for that service?

24Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A I don't remember.
Q Did you discuss with him at all your experience with the Purvis law firm?
A No.
Q Did you meet with him again after 2002?
A I don't think I ever met with Michael again. I may have seen him He's done work for PBS for the history channel, and I may
have seen him on that, but I don't believe I met him again I may have talked to him again.
Q Have you spoken with him by phone?
A I think I may have talked to him by phone once.
Q What was the nature of that conversation?
A I don't recall. It was a conversation based upon my asking him, I believe, or he was asking me about a certain repository.
It's been so long ago I really don't know. As I recall, it was a call related to where I could find certain materials or where he
could find certain materials.
Q And this call occurred after you met him in 2002?
A I believe so, yes.
Q And you didn't know him before 2002, correct?
A I knew of him.
Q But never met him.
A I had never met him, no.
Q Was it a year after you met him, three years after you met him?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Two years?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I don't know I can't recall.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q No idea whether it was six months ago or a year ago?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
25Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A I know it wasn't six months ago or a year ago. It was longer than that.
Q So probably sometime during 2003.
A I don't know. It may have been 2002 or 2001 I'm not certain.
Q That was then before you met him. It was after you met him, right?
A Then the call may have come subsequent to that, immediately subsequent. I'm not sure.
Q And the purpose of that call was one of you wanted to check where you could find certain documents. You can't remember
whether it was him or you?
A I don't recall that.
Q And the repository that you-all were discussing was the Purvis law firm?
A No, it was not the Purvis law firm. It may have been something that I needed information relative to a repository he had
visited or one that I had visited, and I don't recall which one.
Q And did you talk with him again?
A No.
Q Have you ever read any trial transcripts or depositions that he may have given”?
A No.
Q Have you ever read any trial transcripts or depositions that Mr. Graham may have given?
A No.
Q Have you ever met Lacy Ford?
A Never met Lacy Ford.
Q Have you ever spoken with him on the phone?
A I've spoken with him on the phone.
Q Can you tell me when you first spoke to him?
A I spoke to him, I guess, prior to the Engel case probably in 1999, 1998.
Q Did you call him or did he call you?
A I don't recall.

26Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q What was the purpose of the conversation?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Again, I don't recall. It may have been similar to that which I had with Mr. Shaler, or Dr Shaler, and that
it was something about a repository information, but I had one conversation with him It's been so long ago. It's been longer
than that that I had with Shaler.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Is that the only conversation that you ever had with him?
A Only one.
Q Is it your understanding that he has also been retained to provide services in tobacco litigation?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That's my understanding, yes.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And he's an historian as well.
A Yes. At the University of South Carolina, I believe.
Q So you were having your second meeting with Mr. Feiwus and Mr. Ball, and I believe that was at Mr. Feiwus' office, correct?
A No. That wasn't my second meeting.
Q I'm sorry. That was your first meeting with Mr. Feiwus. Is that correct?
A That is correct.
Q January the 12th?
A That's correct.
Q And Mr. Ball was present.
A That is correct.
Q Now, at that time, did you discuss with him what your intentions were as far as your research was concerned in the Ferlanti
case?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: We discussed two matters I wanted to see him and he wanted to see me and introduce ourselves and talk.
See whether we had a fit.

27Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
The second thing was I asked for more materials. I had not gotten all of the depositions. From reading some of them, there was
reference to others being taken. So I asked him to see if he could get those. So that was essentially what we did in that meeting.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Did Mr. Feiwus discuss at all with you what he would like for you to research in the Ferlanti case?
A No. I had already indicated from having read the depositions what I needed and what I was researching.
Q How did you know what questions Mr. Feiwus needed answered?
A The questions with respect to just finding out who I was. That's it. It wasn't a question and answer session.
Q My point is this, you were being retained to do research to offer testimony in the Ferlanti lawsuit. That's what you understood
from the beginning, correct?
A Yes.
Q How did you come to know what opinions you would be asked to formulate in the Ferlanti case?
A I came to know that after I was contacted by Mr. Ball and I had done my research, my initial research with the particular
depositions.
Q So you were not asked to go out and do any special investigation or any special research in order to ask any specific questions
with regard to Mr. Ferlanti?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No. You mean specific? I'm sorry. I don't understand.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Let me rephrase it. You were asked whether or not you would be billing to serve as an expert and to do research in the
Ferlanti case by Mr. Ball, correct?
A That is correct.
Q At that point you asked to have certain information sent to you.
A That is correct.
Q Depositions, complaint, and interrogatories.
A That is correct.
Q You received those materials.
A That is correct.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
28Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q You reviewed them.
A That is correct.
Q You advised Mr. Ball that you would accept the case and you would do research in that case.
A That is correct.
Q And then you met with Mr. Feiwus and Mr. Ball.
A That is correct.
Q When did someone, either from Mr. Ball's office or Mr. Feiwus' office, when did they say, “Doctor, we need for you to look
at these particular issues with regard to the case of Ferlanti”?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: They didn't ask me. I asked them. After I read the depositions, the four depositions I had received, I said “I
have gone through them. I have a feel for the life span of Mr. Ferlanti. These are the materials that I need” Some of which I had
in my own home. Some of them, of course, I did not have them. And I asked that these be sent.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And being sent, you mean sent from the Purvis law firm.
A That is correct Or researched Additional research that will be done.
Q Here's what I'm having trouble understanding How did you know what the scope of your opinions would be if none of the
lawyers ever discussed that with you?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Because I've done this on several cases That is correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So you assumed that in this case you would be doing the same things you had done in the other cases involving tobacco
litigation.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That is correct.
(Thereupon, a brief recess was taken ).
MR. FEIWUS: I just want to note for the record that Dr DiBacco has brought with him today about seventeen boxes of documents
in response to the duces tecum request that he was given So I just wanted to note that.

MR. VENABLE: We're going to go through the duces tecum.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q You had told me before, doctor, about a Professor Mark Rose.
A Yes.
Q And he's at Florida Atlantic University?
A Yes.
Q What involvement have you had with Mr. Rose?
A Professor Rose did research for the Engel case when I testified with respect to that case There were numerous newspapers
that had to be researched and we used several individuals, among whom were university professors and he is one.
Q Was he assisting you or were you-all working together on it?
A He was assisting me.
Q And he was under your supervision?
A He was under my supervision indirectly.
Q Did you check his work?
A I checked the work of many of those individuals. I don't know if I checked his specifically.
Q Can you remember anybody specifically where you went back and checked their work?
A Yes. I did random checks of Jeff Jeche and Shirley Allen, and I did random checks of graduate students at Florida State
University, at the University of Florida, at the Library of Congress to name the three that come to mind.
Q When you would do your checks of their work, explain to me the process that you would use.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I would look at the years or the dates that they surveyed and the articles they would find that dealt with
smoking and health risks, and then I would randomly select dates and see whether or not I found any more and what the error
rate was in terms of my finding more articles than they had identified.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Can you estimate for me the amount of time that you spent checking the work of those individuals?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, I can't, but it was considerable.

BY MR. VENABLE:
Q More than days?
A Per individual, it would be probably several hours per individual.
Q How many years did they review, let's say, for instance, the New York Times, how many years were they in charge of?
A That was not a major newspaper for the bulk of cases that I've been involved in. That was done mostly by my wife, Jeff
Jeche, Shirley Allen and myself They were involved in other newspapers.
Q For the New York Times, how many years do you think that they did the actual survey work on?
A I can't estimate that I don't recall that, because that was done way back in 1994.
Q You looked at the period 1950 through 1965, but you omitted some years, is that correct?
A Yes, because these were done by assistants.
Q Did the assistants go back and do the years you omitted?
A Yes.
Q Did they do the time period before 1950?
A I believe they did too, but that was the time in which I was mostly involved.
Q So your assistants did the period of time before 1950.
A That's correct.
Q They did the omitted years that you didn't cover between 1950 and 1965.
A That's correct.
Q And they did the years of 1965 forward, correct?
A Yes. I may have done some of that myself I don't recall.
Q But your best recollection is that you limited yourself to the period of 1950 through 1965.
A For that newspaper.
Q For the New York Times. That's all I'm talking about here.
A That is correct.
Q For how many years did you-all look at the New York Times?

31Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A Actually, the law firm of Johnson, Tyler & Purvis had done work all the way back to the 1860's.
Q If they already had the article at Johnson, Tyler & Purvis in their archives, did you feel it necessary to go get another copy
of the article?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, but I had to verify it That is correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So you wouldn't make another copy if they already had it. You would just go verify and spot check the work, is that correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, that's not correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Tell me so I understand.
A I would indicate the actual dates and articles, as would the assistants, and if those articles were in the Johnson, Tyler & Purvis
file, fine If they were not, these were obviously added There was verification to make sure that whatever was done was done
in the most comprehensive fashion possible.
Q So Johnson, Tyler & Purvis had an archive that included the New York Times, for instance, from the 1890's you said?
A Yes Even earlier, I believe.
Q All the way through when?
A I don't know. It may be up to the present.
Q But it was certainly up through the '80's?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I'm not certain.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q You're certain that it covered at least through the 70's?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I'm sure of that.
BY MR. VENABLE:

32Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q Through the 70's at least.
A Yes.
Q And you would from time to time find an article that they didn't already have in the archives'?
A From time to time that would happen.
Q And if you did that, you would make a copy of it and make sure it got included in their archives, is that correct?
A That is correct.
Q So if you're at, for instance, the Library of Congress and you're reviewing the microfilm of the New York Times and you're
reading an article, how do you check to see if the Purvis firm already has it?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I often got the entire New York Times that they had done That was available I looked through that Then I
would look to do research on my own with these assistants to ascertain whether or not these were true copies and whether or
not others had been omitted.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Would you-all physically take the copies that were from the repository of the Purvis law firm down to the Library of Congress
and match them up?
A NO.
Q So did you have any of the articles, the copies that are deposited in the Purvis law firm, did you have those with you at the
Library of Congress?
A No.
Q When you were at the Library of Congress and you were looking at the microfilm and you were reviewing a New York Times
paper and you came across an article on smoking and health, how would you determine whether or not it was already one that
had been copied and was in the Purvis law firm?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: We wrote all of them down and then we would check them.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So you made notes.
A I made notes that were for the time used I don't have those notes Those were notes that were done ten years ago.
Q So you made notes of which articles were in the New York Times.

33Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A That's correct. For these periods of time.
Q At least 50 years'?
A The researchers who assisted me actually made copies What I would do is I would check with what I actually did and I would
put down what I found and I would check that with respect to the Johnson, Tyler & Purvis law firm.
Q When you looked at the microfilm at the Library of Congress and you were looking at the New York Times and you came
across an article that had to do with smoking and health, would you make a copy of it?
A I wouldn't physically. The assistants would make a copy. I would make a note for myself to check to make sure that these
were in fact part of the record.
Q So every one you made a copy of.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That's correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And you also made a note about every one.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: The ones that I looked at.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q The ones you looked at you made a note about it. So you had a note and a copy.
A That is correct.
Q Then did you take all those copies back to the Purvis law firm and match them up to see if they fit?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Yes, or added to. That's correct And, in addition to looking at other repositories, I would find new materials
that had not been added, that had not been included in any of their libraries.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And as far as the New York Times was concerned?
A Not for the New York Times.
Q I'm just concentrating on that right now.

34Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
And then once you made these notes, then you just threw them away.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That is correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q There's a series of tapes that says “Reliance List For Professor Mark Rose. Educational Films”. Do you know what those are?
A No, I don't. There are a lot of materials that I found here yesterday that were not relevant Mine are in here There are additional
materials that are in here that must have been used in other cases For example, the Philadelphia Inquirer is in here I did not rely
upon that This has not been pruned to include only mine This includes, I think, others.
MR. FEIWUS: Let me see if I can address that We received a letter from Danny O'Shea about this going back many months
ago. So what is in here are not only his specific reliance materials, but also all of the exhibits and materials that appear on the
exhibit list of Ferlanti that relate to sort of his testimony, Professor Graham's testimony. So it's broader than just what are his
narrow reliance materials, but it may be the case, because of the subject matter, that those things may come into the case and
he may be asked questions about them. So that's why they were being produced here today in connection with his testimony.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Professor, have you reviewed the materials that are necessary for you to formulate an opinion in the Ferlanti case?
A Yes, I have.
Q Do you need to review anything additional to formulate your opinions in the Ferlanti case?
A No, I do not.
Q I'm here to take your deposition today for purposes of use at trial and it's important for me to know what you're going to
testify about Are there materials that have been produced here today that you have never seen?
A No. There are no materials here that I've never seen. There are some that are not relevant, and that's what Mr. Feiwus just
indicated.
Q For instance, this reliance list for Professor Mark Rose, have you seen that? Can you tell me what it is? It says “Educational
Films “ Can you tell me what that is?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Here it is.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q What does reliance list mean to you?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
35Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
THE WITNESS: Those materials on which I based my opinion.
MR. FEIWUS: Just so the record is clear, what Professor DiBacco identified is on the back of the VHS type. There is a sliver
of paper on the tape that refers to “Reliance List for Professor Mark Rose, Educational Films,” and then on the back of the list
it identifies eight specific items that are contained on the list. And, so the record is clear, I'll state what they are. 1 “Tobacco
and the human body,” Encyclopedia Brittanica, 1954, 2 “One in 20,000,” 1954, 3 “Smoker to Nonsmoker?,” American Cancer
Society, 1960, 4 “I'll Choose the High Road,” American Cancer Society, 1963, 5 “Smoke Anyone?,” American Cancer Society,
1964, 6 “Warning From Outer Space,” American Cancer Society, 1967, 7 “Smoking and Doesn't Smoke Yet,” American Cancer
Society, 1970, 8 “Let's talk Tobacco,” American Cancer Society.
So those are the particular items that he was referring to when you asked him.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Where are the videotapes that you've made, doctor?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: These are videotapes that I have reviewed.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Where are the videotapes that you personally have created?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: My videotapes that I have personally created, they're not here. I asked that these be reproduced.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q You asked that these by reproduced?
A That is correct. The ones that I have identified. I don't know what these are. These are Professor Mark Rose's.
Q Where are the ones that you asked to be reproduced?
A There is a list there. Do you have the reliance list, and then I can show them to you.
Q I have no idea which boxes they will be in.
A Let the record indicate that I'm looking at these.
MR. FEIWUS: Well, let the record indicate that on the table there is a set of about eight or ten VHS tapes that are marked
“Reliance List for Professor Mark Rose” Each of those tapes contains on the back an identification of very specific program
materials that are contained on the tapes, and now Professor DiBacco is producing an additional, perhaps ten or twelve, VHS
six-hour tapes and on the back of each of those tapes, I believe -- well, on the back of these we don't have specific items
identified or on some of them they are identified Okay On some of them there are additional items listed on the back For several
of them, they're just single item videos.

36Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
We're up to about 18 tapes for Dr DiBacco.
Seek and we shall find.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Doctor, I've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve VCR tapes. And, sir, if you could, do
those twelve all indicate Johnson, Tyler & Purvis, PC?
A Yes, sir, they do.
Q Are these tapes kept at Johnson, Tyler & Purvis?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: They are I have some copies of my own, yes.
MR. FEIWUS: Actually,, I think this present set is kept at Clarke, Silverglat, so the record is clear.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Do you know why they have the name Johnson, Tyler & Purvis on them?
A Yes They reproduced them.
Q Do they have a master set of these at Johnson, Tyler & Purvis so they can be reproduced?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
MR. VENABLE: There's nothing objectionable about my question.
MR. FEIWUS: Yes. There's a lack of foundation.
THE WITNESS: I don't know.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q You don't know.
A I don't know.
Q Did you provide them with these tapes?
A Some of them I did Others whether they have a copy or they have a master list, but they do reproduce them.
Q So if they reproduce them, wouldn't it make sense that they have got a copy of them?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.

37Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
THE WITNESS: I would assume, but I don't know for sure. I'm not an expert on that.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Is there any way that you know of to make a copy of it if you don't have another copy?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection. You asked him originally if they had a master copy.
THE WITNESS: That's what you said.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q A master copy. So let me clarify. Do they have a copy of each of these twelve tapes that we just identified, do they have a
copy of each of these at the Johnson, Tyler & Purvis law firm?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And you can contact them, I assume, and say “I need for you to make a copy for me of a tape,” and they'll make a copy
and send it out.
A That is correct.
Q And that way you can take this set of tapes to a particular case you're involved with and use them at trial.
A That's correct.
Q When did Johnson, Tyler & Purvis first get copies of these tapes?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection Lack of foundation.
THE WITNESS: I don't know when they got them The dates vary. So we would have to look at the dates Some of these I found
for them I did a lot of the work at the American Cancer Society and found public service announcements, educational films.
There is a master index called the Vanderbilt Archives, which has the transcripts of all of the three major networks from 1968
to the present, and that may have been the basis by which they got these.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q You know how they got some of them, because you furnished them to them, right?
A That's correct.
Q And others you don't know how they got them, because you didn't furnish them.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
38Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
THE WITNESS: That's correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q You were telling me about how you methodically went through the New York Times to check each and every paper, either
you or one of your assistants, each and every page to determine whether or not there was information about smoking and health
in the paper, is that correct?
A That's correct.
Q For instance, on this tape, identified as “Special News Reports 2 of 2, Johnson, Tyler & Purvis P.C.,” the back says “Special
News Reports,” and Number One is “CBS 60 Minutes, No Smoking, January 29, 1984”.
My question to you, sir, is did you survey the programming at CBS with the same methodology that you used to survey the
New York Times? In other words, did you examine everything that appeared on CBS television for the period of the 1940's
through the 1980V.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q How did you decide what to look at and what not to look at?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I did it through the process of verification, which means that when you look through a newspaper you look
through all areas of the newspaper and it will indicate when there are programs that deal with smoking and health. You identify
that That is a corroborative way of identifying that there is a particular program on smoking and health.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q That would have to be a program that was entitled something about smoking and health, wouldn't it?
A Absolutely. Or it might well be a reference made through the Vanderbilt archives it was recorded.
Q Well, the Vanderbilt archives, did they make the transcripts of all the movies that ever played on CBS? Are they all at the
Vanderbilt archives?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No. These are news As I indicated to you, these are the three major nightly news programs.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So it's the 6 30 news that we see every night?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
39Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A Or seven o'clock.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Or seven o'clock. It's the nightly news.
A That's correct.
Q Does it have in there the morning news?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: no.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Does it have the Today Show?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Does it have Johnny Carson?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Does it have the Cher Show?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I'm looking at a tape that says Johnson, Tyler & Purvis and on the back it says “Television Shows,” and one of them is Cher,
Show Six, March 16, 1975. Now, what I want to know, sir, is have you reviewed all of the Cher Shows?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. VENABLE:
Q How did you come to review Cher Show Six of March 16, 1975?
A That was found by Johnson, Tyler & Purvis, and it was made available through them for me to see.
Q Let me ask you the same about Welcome Back Cotter Did you review all the Welcome Back Cotter shows?
A No, sir.
Q How did you come to know about the Welcome Back Cotter show December 16, 1976?
A Because they had found this in their research and they made it available to me.
Q And how about Good Times, did you review all the Good Times shows?
A No, sir, I did not.
Q How did you come to see a show Good Times March 30, 1977?
A The same way They had found this segment They put it on tape and made it available to me.
Q Same true for All In the Family, 1978?
A That is correct.
Q The same is true for Happy Days, 1979?
A Yes.
Q Same is true for One Day At A Time, 1984?
A That's correct.
Q Same for Cheers, 1987?
A That's correct.
Q Same for Roseanne, 1989?
A That is correct.
Q Same for Hill Street Blues, 1986?
A Yes.
Q Same for Walt Disney, 1951?

41Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
THE WITNESS: Don't know about that I would have to know what that is.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Did you review all the Walt Disney shows?
A No, I did not. I reviewed some.
Q How did you search the Walt Disney shows?
A Because there were some references in the newspaper to shows that Walt Disney produced that induced me to want to look
at them.
Q How did you go get the Walt Disney show that you wanted to look at?
A I'm not certain. I think Johnson, Tyler & Purvis had some of these.
Q Are you aware of any other source where you could go and say “I would like to see the Walt Disney show from 1961”?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Yes. There are sources.
In fact, I've done some of this. There's the Wolfson Media Center right here in Miami There's the Vanderbilt Archives Center.
You can go to those two and you can find clips, for example, of local news programs, as well as national news programs.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I'm not talking about news programs I'm talking about Walt Disney shows.
A No I don't know of that I don't know how that would be done.
Q So you would have to rely upon Johnson, Tyler & Purvis to get you that.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That is correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q How about Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, did you rely upon them to provide you with that?
A That's correct.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.

Q How about Password, 1963, did you rely upon them to provide you with that?
A Yes, I did.
Q And Bill Cosby Revenge, in 1967, did you rely upon them to provide you with that?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That is correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q How about the Eisenhower Press Conference July 31, 1957, did you find that or did you rely upon them to provide you
with that?
A I found that in the newspaper on August 12th, I believe, or August 7, 1957. I found reference to that in the New York Times,
and I may have asked whether they had a copy of that.
Q But you got it from them. You may have asked if they had it.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That's correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I'm looking at another tape It's “Public Service Announcements, Johnson, Tyler & Purvis PC” Did you go out and research
the public service announcements?
A No. I found some of these on my own from my work with the American Cancer Society. I found some of these in my work
with the American Lung Association. The bulk of them were provided to Johnson, Tyler & Purvis through an historian at
the University of Missouri, Kansas City, by the name of Gregg Black, who had done research in the field of public service
announcements.
Q Did you go back and verify the work of Professor Black?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I did not verify the work in terms of all of his public service announcements What I did was to make certain
if I used any of them as demonstratives in the trial, that they would in fact be verified by other evidence. For example, Tony
Curtis made an American Cancer Society p.s.a., public service announcement, entitled “I quit”.
To ensure that that was authentic, I looked at the reports from the American Cancer Society in the year in which he did it to
see if indeed he was listed as one of theirs, and I also may have looked at a web site or a research book dealing with Tony
Curtis to see if there was any reference to this.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Let's take Tony Curtis “I quit” I think it's Tony Curtis listed as “I Q,” 1969. Am I right? Is that the one you're talking about?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
43Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A Yes.
Q Let's talk about that one for a second When did that air?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: It aired, according to the corroborative sources, in 1969. It may have aired subsequent to that.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q What corroborative sources told you that that went on the air?
A The corroborative sources were the American Cancer Society that in their annual report referenced that he made a p.s.a.
Q Anything else?
A It may have been in newspapers I'm not certain.
Q You don't remember it specifically.
A I don't remember, no, sir.
Q So you verified this Tony Curtis “I Quit,” by going to the American Cancer Society and you verified that in fact Tony Curtis
made such a public service announcement first?
A I looked at the American Cancer Society annual reports, and they usually listed at the end of their report what they had done.
For example, I found over the course of my research that they were very proud to indicate, whenever they did a p.s.a., that
they gave some estimates as to when it was aired, and, maybe, how many stations it was aired They did the same thing with
educational materials.
Q Let me stop you for a second If I could look at the 1969 American Cancer Society annual report, your testimony is it's going
to tell me that this aired on television and it's going to tell me how often, correct?
A That is not the case.
Q What are you telling me?
A It will indicate, for example, that there was a p.s.a. done by certain celebrities, and Tony Curtis would be included in that
They will not indicate how many times it aired It would indicate, for example, that it aired.
Q It will?
A I believe so to the best of my recollection.
Q How many times did Tony Curtis “I Q” or “I Quit,” 1969 -- well, it was recorded, I assume, in 1969?
A That's correct.

44Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q How many times did that air on television?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I have no idea.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Did it air at one o'clock in the morning or nine o'clock in the morning or at any other time? When did it air?
A I have no idea.
Q On what station did it air?
A I have no idea.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Do you have any information as regards to the number of persons who viewed that p.s.a?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Is the same true as to each and every one of the p.s.a.'s that are listed on this tape --.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q -- entitled “Public Service Announcements, Johnson, Tyler & Purvis PC” that begins with “Don't Be A Loser”?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Do you know if any of those public service announcements, in fact, were aired?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Only from corroborative evidence.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Let me stop you there. If you got corroborative evidence, I want to know what it is.

45Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
Can I just see that for a second? Just so the record is clear, we're talking about -.
MR. VENABLE: I've identified it, counsel. You don't have to read every one now.
MR. FEIWUS: I'm not going to read every one of them, but we are talking about 33 different p.s.a.'s that are identified on the
back of this particular videotape. So you're asking him, I think, what is a compound question. So just give him an opportunity
to answer it.
MR. VENABLE: I am. And if he's got corroborative evidence, I'm happy to hear about each and every one of them.
THE WITNESS: I don't know, except for the fact that, again, I can identify two of these as having been written about in the
press extensively as having aired.
When Bill Talman died in 1967, reference was made to the p.s.a.'s that he in fact did on behalf of the American Cancer Society,
because he was dying from lung cancer in his obituary. Subsequently, his wife set up some sort of association to promote the
work that he was doing, his p.s.a.'s. So those that were very much in the news, you have corroborative evidence.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Which ones are those?
A I'll do each one First is Bill Talman He was well known as Perry Mason's losing attorney in a very popular television show in
the 1960's His was probably the most outstanding one in the 1960's, but it wasn't the only one. If I can go through these slowly.
Q Let me make sure I understand. You're going to tell me, because my question to you right now is which one of these do you
have corroborative evidence actually aired on television?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection As he sits here in this room --.
MR. VENABLE: Counsel, do you know if it's going to change, because you have an objection as he sits here today, and I'm
here to take his deposition to find out what he's going to say at trial.
MR. FEIWUS: You have 17 boxes of exhibits in this room. I highly doubt that this witness is going to move into evidence
17 boxes of documents and 30 videotapes of evidence. So, as he sits here today, you can plumb his knowledge about what
he knows about corroborative materials for any number of these materials. He may or may not do additional research on the
foundational requirements or the authenticity requirements of any of these videos, but you're certainly welcome to plumb his
knowledge about the 17 boxes of documents and the 30 videotapes that are in this room, as he sits here today, with no other
assistance before him.
MR. VENABLE: Counsel, just so the record is absolutely clear, if any further research is done to establish the authenticity of
these videotapes or that they actually aired or if he does any further research about anything that has to do with this case, I would
ask that you advise our office immediately and then make the doctor again available for deposition and we will determine,
at that time, whether we can accomplish that discovery without being unduly prejudiced. The doctor should be here ready to
testify today.
MR. FEIWUS: He is ready to testify, and it may very well be that he will not have to do additional research.

46Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
MR. VENABLE: Counsel, you know my position If he does anymore, I expect to find out about it.
MR. FEIWUS: And I note for the record that it may be a matter for the doctor to refresh his recollection about some of the
exhibits and videotapes for which he already has done the research and independent knowledge. You're asking him a question
that is not an easy one to answer as he readily sits here.
MR. VENABLE: Well, I think you may be right Let me have this, doctor, and I'm going to go one by one, doctor, and I want
you to tell me what information you have.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q “Don't Be A Loser” by Bill Talman, 1967 Is that the one you were talking about earlier?
A That's correct.
Q “Surfer” I want you to tell me what information you have that that one entitled “Surfer,” 1968, actually aired on television?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: As I sit here today, I don't recall, because it was not one of the leading ones.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Do you have any information as to how often “Surfer” aired on television?
A As I sit here today, I do not.
Q Do you have any information as to when it aired on television?
A As I sit here today, no.
Q 1968, “Showdown,” do you have any information as to whether or not that in fact aired on television?
A As I sit here today, no.
Q 1968, “Yogi Bear On Smoking,” do you have any information that that aired on television?
A Corroborative evidence As I sit here today -- is that the information that you're asking?
Q Yes.
A The answer is as I sit here today, no, I do not.
Q ‘Tony Curtis Tip,” 1969, any information that suggests that that in fact aired on television?
A My recollection of that, as I indicated to you before, since that was a very popular p.s.a. and Tony Curtis got a lot of news
about it and it was reported in the news that he had done this, and there was only one way that this could be reported in the
news and that is if it had aired. A reporter looks at television, makes conclusions, writes a story. Tony Curtis received a great

47Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
deal of publicity, and he also, subsequently, became a leader of the American Cancer Society Annual Smokeout, which was
held on the third Thursday of every November.
So my testimony is, as I sit here today there were numerous stories written about Tony Curtis at the time, which would
corroborate that that p.s.a. was aired.
Q Or that the American Cancer Society supplied this p.s.a. to news organizations.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q That can explain it as well, could it not?
A That's less likely the case.
Q How do you know?
A Well, it's less likely the case, because the reporter who does the story will examine that based upon the actual knowledge
of having seen it on television.
Q He could have also actually seen it on a videotape just like you did, couldn't he?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: It's unlikely. A reporter doesn't base a story based upon that.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q How do you know? It would be an accurate story, would it not, that Tony Curtis did this p.s.a. He did in fact do it.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: If he says “Aired on television,” it would be inaccurate if he said that.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So did they say it was aired on television?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: To my knowledge.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Where did it say that was aired on television?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.

48Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
THE WITNESS: To my recollection, that was included in the news stories.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q In what news stones?
A I can't recall at the time, but there were news stories that indicated that this aired widely.
Q Do you think those news stories might have occurred in 1969 when the p.s.a. was done?
A I think so.
Q Where would you find those news stones?
A In the relevant newspapers of the time in terms of the New York Times, Washington Post You find them in Time, Newsweek.
Q Did you make copies of those that made reference to this area?
A There may well be copies that I have reviewed, but, to the best of my knowledge, this was widely known about and distributed
and aired.
Q When did it air? What stations did it air on?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Again, I don't know that.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q What time did it air?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I don't know that.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Would it matter to you if it aired at one o'clock in the morning or one o'clock at night? would that make any difference to you?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: It would.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Why would it make a difference?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.

49Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
THE WITNESS: Because there's a larger viewing audience at nine o'clock at night.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q What if it aired at three o'clock in the morning? What effect would that have?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: It would have some.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q A minimal impact if it was aired at three o'clock in the morning.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: It would.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q What if it only aired on an independent station as opposed to a regular network station Would that matter to you?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I would have to go back in 1969 and look at how many independent stations there were.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q What if it was on an educational channel?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Would that make a difference?
MR. FEIWUS: Let me note for the record that I really like educational channels.
THE WITNESS: It would make a difference, yes.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q In other words, you need to know when it airs, you need to know where it airs if you're going to evaluate what impact it
might have had on the American public.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, that's not correct.

50Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Well, explain to me how it is that you would know the impact of this p.s.a. on the American public if you have no idea
when it aired or where it aired?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Because it was written about in other sources. That's the point that I'm trying to make.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So --.
A May I finish?
This material that you have supplied in a videotape is part of what we call an information environment. This information
environment does not exist independently of other parts of this information environment. When you watch the CBS evening
news at night, chances are very good that the information that is being disseminated in that program has already been aired on
television in the morning. It's probably on the internet at the same time. It may well be the object of a talk show in the morning.
The same thing happens with regard to the public service announcements or even movies or educational materials. They are
part of a large information environment. There is no way to gauge how many people read a particular article or see a video,
but there is a reasonable assumption that historians make when they look at the information environment to see to what extent
that particular part of the information environment is replicated by others. So if Tony Curtis makes a particular p.s.a. and that
p.s.a. is written about by other organs as having been aired or having had an influence in terms of being distributed, that is
sufficient reasonable information to illustrate that it has been corroborated. That's what the historian does There is no way to
answer the questions that you are raising about how many people viewed this when, in fact, there's no measure that anybody
could provide to determine that.
MR. VENABLE: Move to strike as nonresponsive.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Are you testifying that there is no means by which to determine how many people are watching a given show at a given
time in this country?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: There are means to estimate.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q There are.
A There are. And that's rarely done except in instances where there is a bona fide instance of trying to find out, and for public
service announcements that would not be something that the American Cancer Society would spend money on.
Q Well, not necessarily having the American Cancer Society spend money on it. Don't the television stations spend money on it?

51Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
MR. FEIWUS: Objection Lack of foundation.
THE WITNESS: Television stations provide public service announcements as part of their public service. Every three years
they're up for renewal and they have to provide information to the Federal Communications Commission that they have in fact
provided public service announcements.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q My point is that there are ratings for television shows all the time, aren't there?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: There are ratings for television shows all the time based upon estimates. There are not ratings for specific
shows when those shows are continuing ones.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q They're are not ratings for specific shows. So there is no rating system for how many people watch the Letterman Show?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Today there is.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Today there is.
A Yes.
What you're asking me to do is try to ascertain how many people watch the Welcome Back Cotter show on that particular date,
and I don't think there is any foundation or any means by which to do that.
Q So we don't know -- well, you believe by corroborative evidence that the Tony Curtis Tip p.s.a. aired sometime somewhere,
correct?
A I do.
Q But you don't know and have no way of knowing how many people saw it.
A No.
Q You do believe that on the nightly news shows there was some reference to this Tony Curtis p.s.a.
A That is not what I said What I said is that there are other means of corroboration, and the illustration I provided you with
was very clear. I said there were news stories written about it.
Q Newspapers?
A Newspapers and magazines. That's correct.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
52Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q So people in newspapers wrote about Tony Curtis' p.s.a. “Tip”.
A To the best of my knowledge, yes, it was corroborated in newspapers, as well as magazine coverage.
Q In 1969.
A Thereabouts.
Q How would you, as an historian, evaluate the news coverage of Tony Curtis' Tip in 1969? How would you go about evaluating
the impact of this p.s.a. without knowing who saw it?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I explained that to you in my answer that you said was unresponsive. I viewed it as part of the information
environment.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q If I can stop you so I understand. I'm only talking about what actually was on the p.s.a. We can talk about the impact of the
other things, the newspaper articles about the p.s.a. So what I'm trying to get to is the impact on the American public of the
p.s.a. if we don't know who saw it, if anyone.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: And, as I indicated, we would do that on the basis of how well it was covered in other media.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So if it played at two o'clock in the morning to a virtual nonaudience on an independent network that has virtually no viewers,
if that is where this show was aired, and it was written about in the New York Times or in some magazine. Is that fair?
A No, it's not fair.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: It evades the issue of common sense.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Well, you help me then.
A I will help you.
Common sense suggests that if, indeed, a celebrity is going to devote his time to make an announcement and it is covered in the
media as something that is part of the celebrity's public service, common sense would dictate that, yes, it may run at three o'clock
in the morning, but common sense also suggests it was probably aired a long time at times when individuals were watching
television. That is the common sense end of this As far as the ability to find out when it was specifically aired, I don't know.

53Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q So you have no basis other than your common sense to suggest what you just described.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection, because that mischaracterizes his prior testimony.
MR. VENABLE: Well, I think he said it's based on common sense.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection. It mischaracterizes his prior testimony.
THE WITNESS: Common sense as an historian and as a professional.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Are you offering that as a professional opinion that this aired at numerous times when lots of people saw it? Are you prepared
to offer that professional opinion?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That isn't what I said.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I just want to make sure If you're offering that professional opinion, I need to ask you about that.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I did not say that.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q ‘Tony Curtis Pay,” how often did that air and where did it air?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Again that was associated with his other p.s.a.'s. Whatever date is there, again -.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q 1969.
A I believe it was. And I believe the same thing happened.
To make a long story short, since we got quite a bit of these, I would identify only one other one on that long list that received
enormous coverage In fact, it received publicity just a few weeks ago in the New York Times.
Q Well, I'm going to run through this list and you just tell me My question to you on each one of these is do you have any
information to demonstrate that the p.s.a. actually aired and when it aired?
MR. FEIWUS: Before you answer, I want to state my objection. As he sits here, he can answer.

54Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
THE WITNESS: As I sit here, my recollection is that it's not possible for me to demonstrate that it did air, except in the two
instances that I indicated, one for Tony Curtis and one for Yule Brenner, which is the last one.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And the one that you said you got, the Tony Curtis “I Quit,” that's the one that got the press coverage.
A All of his did.
Q All three of these did?
A All of them.
Q So all three of these got press coverages that corroborate to you that it must have aired sometime.
A As I sit here today, I recall that it was corroborated in the press.
Q And that's ‘Tony Curtis I Q,” “Tony Curtis Tip,” and ‘Tony Curtis Pay”. Now, what's the other one on this list?
A The “Yule Brenner ACS 1985 “.
Q “Yule Brenner ACS 1985”. And you believe that there's information that corroborates that that p.s.a. actually appeared on
television.
A Yes.
Q Could you tell me the corroborating information to that?
A Yule Brenner was, again, a very famous celebrity who was dying of lung cancer and who was best known for his work in the
film “The King and I,” which starred Yule Brenner and Deborah Kerr, and Yule Brenner's very dramatic p.s.a., like William
Talman's p.s.a. earlier, attracted a lot of news attention and it was written about at the time as having not only aired, but aired
so much so that certain people were moved to be influenced by it There was an article just recently in the New York Times
by a young doctor who mentions Yule Brenner and his p.s.a.'s as having influenced him, and that was in the New York Times
within the last couple of months.
Q Do you have any information as to when in 1985 Yule Brenner's p.s.a. ran?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection Asked and answered.
THE WITNESS: I can't here today, no.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q As to the 1985 Yule Brenner p.s.a., do you have any information as to what channels it aired on?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection. Asked and answered.
THE WITNESS: As I sit here today, I cannot.

BY MR. VENABLE:
Q As to the 1985 Yule Brenner p.s.a., do you have any information regarding at what time the Yule Brenner p.s.a. ran?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: As I sit here today, no.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And as to all the other ones that are listed on this tape, you don't have any information at all that would corroborate that
they were aired.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: As I sit here today, I do not.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q This one is titled “Evening News Clip Johnson, Tyler & Purvis P C” and it's got 82 CBS evening news shows on it.
MR. FEIWUS: You mean from 1982 or 82?
MR. VENABLE: No. There are 82 listed there.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Beginning with the CBS Evening News, September 16, 1968, and ending with the ABC Evening News from May 23, 1990.
My question to you is did you prepare this VHS tape and provide it to Johnson, Tyler & Purvis?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, but it was corroborated.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q It was corroborated.
A Yes.
Q Who prepared the tape to begin with?
A Johnson, Tyler & Purvis.
Q Did you get a copy of this tape?
A Yes.

56Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q What did you do with it?
A Checked it with the Vanderbilt archives.
Q How did you do that?
A There is an index You can go through it and all of the particular nightly news shows are there I checked those with respect
to whether or not those were in fact the transcripts, and they were.
Q So these you were able to validate.
A Absolutely.
Q CBS News See It Now, May 31, 1955, June 7, 1955, Johnson, Tyler & Purvis PC, who created this VHS?
A They prepared it.
Q Did they give it to you to review?
A Indeed I knew about that and asked them to get the entire two segment program.
Q And were you able to go to an archive and verify it's existence?
A Yes.
Q And you were able, I assume, at the archives to verify that it in fact ran on CBS News.
A Indeed I did That is correct.
MR. FEIWUS: Just so the record is clear, I think that's the show that we showed the May 31, 1955 portion of it as part of the
direct case in the Davis versus Liggett litigation I think the defendant showed the June 7, 1955 portion of it at the Davis litigation.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I have one entitled “Laugh In,” February 16, 1970 Who made this one?
A Johnson, Tyler & Purvis made that.
Q Did you independently review all the Laugh In shows to select appropriate information that might have appeared on that
show for consideration by the jury?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Who selected this one, Johnson, Tyler & Purvis?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
57Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A They found it. That's correct.
Q And they asked you to look at it?
A Yes.
Q And did you look at it?
A I did.
Q This one “Television p.s.a.'s and Movies,” says Ferlanti case on it, Johnson, Tyler & Purvis.
A Yes.
Q Did you ask if they prepared this one for you for this case?
A Yes, I did.
Q It says “All In The Family, 1978”. Did you review the All In The Family shows that were ever shown on television to
determine which ones would be of assistance to the jury in this case?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Who selected the one that appears on this tape?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I would have to see it They selected that They found that.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q They being Johnson, Tyler & Purvis?
A That's correct.
Q And Bridge over Troubled Sonia, a Roseanne show, who selected that?
A I believe they did that.
Q Did you review all the Roseanne shows to determine which ones would be appropriate and assist a jury in this case?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Movies Educating Rita, 1983, who caused that to be on this VHS tape?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I asked that it be put on the tape It was indicated in the depositions that Mr. Ferlanti and Mrs. Ferlanti went
to the movies at least once a week and they liked movies. So I asked that that be brought.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Why did you pick Educating Rita?
A Because there is a reference to smoking and health in there.
Q How many movies have you reviewed to determine whether or not there was some reference to smoking and health or
smoking and safety or smoking and good looks or smoking and whatever? How many movies have you reviewed with an eye
towards how that impacted the American smoker?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I reviewed movies to ascertain whether or not there are any references to smoking and health, and I include
that as part of this large information environment.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Well, how many?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q How many movies have you reviewed?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I don't know the number, but, certainly, a great number of them. I keep reviewing them in terms of watching
them, old movies.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q What methodology do you use to ensure that you scientifically analyzed the movies that have been presented to the American
public over the last 60 years?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: There is no methodology in movie assessment, because the type of movies that are made are so diverse. What
essentially happens, because movies are not classed or put into any segment of the transcripts, you can't find transcripts of

59Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
movies as readily as you can television programs, so you watch a lot of movies. I continually watch movies, and it is the one
area in which you work on the basis of availability.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And Johnson, Tyler & Purvis, they look at a lot of movies too and found a lot of movies, haven't they, and they provide
those to you to look at.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: And I have found some for them.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Do you have any information that the Ferlanti's ever saw Educating Rita?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I have no information.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Why would you include that if you don't have any information they ever saw it?
A Because it's part of the information environment in 1983, and it's part of an environment that is composed of many, many
segments, as I indicated before -- movies, educational matenals, television, newspapers -- and that's why it was included.
I might also add that it's also included because having looked at the depositions of the Ferlantis, from my research they appear
to be like ordinary consumers and Americans elsewhere who were part of this information environment they were exposed to.
Q Were you able to ascertain what Mr. Ferlanti knew about the hazards of cigarette smoking at any point in time?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, except for the statement, I believe, in the answers to interrogatories.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q What statement?
A And in the complaint.
Q What statement was made in the answers to interrogatories that helped you in that regard?
A I think there was a statement to the effect, as well as in the deposition, I think where Mrs. Ferlanti indicated that in the last
10 or 15 years they knew about the risks of smoking.
Q What other information did you utilize to evaluate what knowledge Mr. Ferlanti had about the dangers of cigarette smoking
at any particular point in time?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
60Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Anything other than the depositions and the interrogatories?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: As I would research and look at what he did throughout the course of his life, the information that he was
exposed to. He read newspapers. He was a subscriber to the Sun Sentinel. He watched television according to the depositions.
So the historian goes back to recreate what was television like in his period, what the newspapers were like. So you try to
recreate the information environment at the time.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Are you able to determine at any particular point in time what Mr. Ferlanti knew about the health hazards of cigarettes?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Not in any particular point in time, no.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Are you able to evaluate when in fact he knew about the dangers of cigarette smoking in a decade, for instance, in the 1950's?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I'm not able to evaluate it, except as I related it to the statements made in the depositions with regard to
attempts to quit on his part, information he received from a Dr Lorrie about being told to stop smoking, information relative to
a conversation that he had with his son, Joseph, as well as Louis and Linda, with respect to stopping smoking.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q As far as the deposition testimony and the medical records are concerned, you're just reading those and repeating what was
said in them, are you not?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No I did not look at any medical records. I looked at depositions of family members, and those depositions
provided information relative to a particular point in time to discussions that were made with respect to the health risks of
smoking.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Do you have any information which would suggest that Mr. Ferlanti knew anything other than what was set forth in those
depositions about the dangers of cigarette smoking and health?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
61Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
THE WITNESS: No, because my research was not based upon what people know, but what they were exposed to. What people
know or believe, that's beyond the knowledge of the historian.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Let's talk about that. So you didn't undertake in your research and in the work you were performing in this case, you did not
undertake to try to determine what Mr. Ferlanti knew. Is that correct?
A That is correct.
Q And you didn't undertake to try to determine what it is that any segment of the public knew at any point in time about the
dangers of cigarette smoking and health. Is that correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That is correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And you undertook an exercise in determining what information was available to the American public at different points
in time, is that correct?
A I would use the term information to which they were exposed. I think that is a bit of a slant from availability, because the
availability says it's here if you go after it. Being exposed suggests that it's part of an environment where it is incorporated in
Slang. It's incorporated in television It's incorporated in movies. It's written about in newspapers, in magazines, and exposure
is a far different word than availability Availability suggests you have to go out there.
Mr. Ferlanti's son, Joseph, the elder son, put it well -- “The information was all around you,” he said, and that's a good way
to talk about exposure.
MR. VENABLE Move to strike as nonresponsive.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q My question is did you determine what information Mr. Ferlanti specifically saw?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.

THE WITNESS: I made a study of the extent to which Americans were exposed to the health risks of smoking, the ordinary
American, and it's my opinion that Americans were increasingly exposed to the health risks of smoking, including the risks of
death, disease, shortened life, addiction, increasingly in the periods since 1950.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Did you make any effort whatsoever to determine whether or not if an American saw the information, or the group as a whole
saw the information, whether or not they accepted it as true?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I made no attempt.
There's no way to do that.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Did you make any attempt whatsoever to find out the opinion of the American public regarding smoking and health issues
in the 1950's, '60's, and 70's?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: There were some polls, which you'll see on my reliance lists, that would indicate the extent to which Americans
expressed their views about what they had heard and whether or not they believed it, but, other than those, no.
MR. VENABLE: I think it's a good time to take lunch, and if we could get those polls, we'll start with that when we get back.
MR. FEIWUS: They're in here. Your best bet is to ask Dr. DiBacco during the deposition.
MR. VENABLE: I was going to give him some time.
MR. FEIWUS: That's fine. I just thought you wanted me to fish them out.
MR. VENABLE: Counsel, I wouldn't ask you to do that.
MR. FEIWUS: That's fine Just let me know how long you want to take.
MR. VENABLE: We can go off the record for this.

data, and I asked you to find that Were you able to do that over lunch?

A I didn't have much time, but I found one example with regard to the William Talman p.s.a.
May I identify it so we can put it in the record?
Q I'll ask you questions.
A Okay.
Q What you've shown me is “Why Actor's Widow Battles Cigarettes” It's got a Number 6634 It has “Bergen County Record “.
What is the Bergen County Record?
A It's a newspaper in Bergen County.
Q Where is Bergen County?
A New Jersey.
Q And it's dated August 12, 1969.
A Yes, sir.
Q Thank you, sir I appreciate you finding that Did you find any others?
A May I identify it more specifically?
Q I don't need for you to do that.
MR. FEIWUS: I'm going to mark it.
MR. VENABLE: Well, you can ask him, if you want to, in cross-examination. He's identified the document, counsel.
MR. FEIWUS: I just wanted to state for the record that this does bear exhibit numbers from the exhibit list. It comes from
6634 1969 0812, and it's one of the materials that was available from our exhibit list and one of the materials that is available
in the boxes.
MR. VENABLE: That's very helpful, counsel.
THE WITNESS: Can I also expand -.
MR. VENABLE: No, you may not, sir You're here to answer my questions.

BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Now, polling data.
Thank you, sir.
Could you tell me what is commonly meant by the term survey or poll?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I might indicate that this is a field that the historian relies upon only indirectly, because it's a whole different
field by itself, polling, but it is a sampling of individuals as to their views on a matter.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Is it an attempt to try to identify what people may believe about a particular subject at a particular time?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Tell me why it is not. What's wrong with that statement?
A It is often an attempt to find out what people know about a specific subject, and the reason it's the matter of knowing as
opposed to belief is because belief may be based upon a variety of factors that are difficult for the pollster to ascertain.
Q A poll can be constructed to ask a sampling of individuals, “Do you believe that George Bush will win the next election?”.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: And those are very, very unreliable polls That's why the historian relies upon the polls that look at exposed
to what you know as opposed to what you believe.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Do you claim to be an expert in polling?
A No. That's why I do not rely upon polling, only as it relates to the issue of what people know as opposed to what they believe.
Q There are people who are trained in utilizing polls to determine how the populous at large may consider or believe on a
particular issue, are there not?
A There are, and that's an expertise outside of my area.
Q If it's outside of your area, do you feel qualified to offer opinions regarding which polls are reliable and which polls are
not reliable?

MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I indicate that with respect to the historian relying upon those that are very obvious, and the obvious ones are
what people know as opposed to what they believe.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q What is the difference between what somebody knows and what somebody believes?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Knowing is they've heard about it, and believing is they accept it.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Is it important to you in your work in the tobacco litigation to ascertain what people believe as opposed to what they know?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection Asked and answered.
THE WITNESS: It's important to ascertain what they know.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Why is it not important for you to try to ascertain what they believe?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: There's no way to do that I do not have the expertise, nor do I know a way to do it.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And you don't believe that there's any polling technique that can reach the issue of what people believe.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: What I have read, and, again, I'm not an expert, leads me to the conclusion that this is a field that historians,
trained as I have been, are not capable of fathoming.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I wasn't asking you as to historians I'm asking you whether or not you accept that there are methodologies of polling to
ascertain what people believe.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.

A I don't know.
Q But, in fact, as part of your reliance, you have listed certain polls.
A I have listed polls with respect to what people have heard about.
Q And you also know, do you know not, sir, that Philip Morris, in the late 1950's, commissioned an organization to go out and
ascertain the beliefs of persons concerning cigarette smoking and health.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, I do not know that.
It was not widely disseminated material.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q You never saw it?
A No.
Q You never heard about it in a trial or any other time?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q It's not something that Philip Morris chose to share with you if it in fact exists?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: My role is to look at publicly available widely disseminated materials. In all of the materials that I looked
at, I did not see that.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So I am correct, Philip Morris, if that document exists, never shared it with you.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I have no relation with Philip Morris I deal with publicly available materials that are distributed in the ordinary
media. I do not have a relationship with Philip Morns.

Q Yet you have a long-term relationship, however, with Philip Morns' counsel, the Purvis firm.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: With the repository represented by Johnson, Tyler & Purvis, that is correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And Johnson, Tyler & Purvis, the attorneys for Philip Morris, have provided you with a great deal of information from the
repository, have they not?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Which I have asked for.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Has the Purvis firm ever told you that Philip Morns had commissioned a study of what people believed about the health
effects of cigarettes in the 1950's?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I have not been exposed to that review, nor did I ask about it, nor did I come across it in my own publicly
available information.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Would it be anything of interest to you?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Not if it wasn't publicly disseminated, no, sir.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So you have no interest in attempting to ascertain what people believe about the dangers of smoking in the 1950's.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I have an interest in finding out what is publicly disseminated widely to Americans about the health risks
of smoking.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I take it then the answer to my question is no?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Thank you.
Could you give me your definition of the term “common knowledge “.
A Yes. Common knowledge is a term which refers to information that is so widely distributed over long periods of time that it
becomes part of the culture, that is to say, that when the knowledge is referenced, it doesn't need to be explained.
Q Where did you get that definition?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That definition was devised over a period of time in my research.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Is that published anywhere in any historical treatise or text?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I think you would find a similar definition, if not in major definitions of it, in historical terms, but it's the term
that I've used over the years in teaching and I was using that term which I've used.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I want you to assume for a moment that the term common knowledge as being used in this case means knowledge that is
accepted as true by a vast majority of the population.
A That's not my definition.
Q I understand that's not your definition I want you to assume that definition. All right, sir? I want you to assume that definition.
Now, I want to ask you whether or not you have made any analysis of any data to answer the question of what the common
knowledge was regarding tobacco or cigarette smoking and health during any period of time?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I don't understand the question.
MR. FEIWUS: I don't understand it, and I think it's very misleading and it goes to creating a very misleading record.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Let me rephrase it When I ask you to assume something, you understand what you're to do with that, you assume that it's
accurate and you're to apply it as I ask you to assume?
MR. FEIWUS: If he can do it.

MR. FEIWUS: Yes, I do.
MR. VENABLE: Then object to the form then, and that's all you need to do.
MR. FEIWUS: You're asking him to assume that X is not X, and then opine on it, and I think that that's misleading.
MR. VENABLE: Counsel, you're objecting to my form, I assume.
MR. FEIWUS: I have an objection to form, but I also have an objection beyond that It's stated for the record and you can proceed.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Doctor, do you understand that I can ask you to assume certain things as being true?
A If I can understand it, yes.
Q I'm asking you to assume that for purposes of my question that common knowledge means facts that are accepted as true
by the vast majority of a population All right, sir I'm asking you to assume that's the definition that I'm using And I want to
then ask you whether or not you're able to determine the common knowledge as it existed in this country concerning cigarette
smoking and health during any specific period in time?
MR. FEIWUS: I've stated my objection.
MR. VENABLE: As to form.
MR. FEIWUS: No I'm stating my objection to form and beyond that.
MR. VENABLE: Counsel, if your speaking objections don't stop, we'll go to court and find out whether or not you can do this.
MR. FEIWUS: I'm not making a speaking objection.
MR. VENABLE: Yes, you are.
MR. FEIWUS: No, I'm not I'm stating my objection If you want us to leave and have a colloquy as to why I think that's an
improper question, I'll be happy to do it outside.
MR. VENABLE: You can object to the form That's all you can do in Florida.
MR. FEIWUS: I'm objecting to form, and I've an objection beyond form, but I'm allowing you to proceed If you want to know
the basis --.
MR. VENABLE: I don't want to know.
MR. FEIWUS: If you don't want to know the basis, then you proceed at your preference.

Q Now, can you answer my question?
A I don't understand it You're asking me to assume that black is white and accept that, and I can't assume that.
Q You can't even operate and make any determinations whatsoever if common knowledge means a fact that is accepted by the
vast majority of the population as true You cannot even apply that concept to anything you've done. Is that correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I've never heard common knowledge being defined in that term, and I've spent 35 years working in the field.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Yes or no, sir, can you apply that term as I have defined it?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I cannot apply it, because it's a misconception of the term.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q That's your opinion.
A That's my opinion.
Q Correct And you cannot apply it, and you cannot make such a determination based upon the research that you have.
A I cannot make an assumption that your definition of common knowledge is true You've asked me to accept that assumption
You're redefining what I have worked with for 35 years in your definition, which is not an accurate definition.
Q Sir, common knowledge is also used as a legal term, is it not? Do you know that as an historian?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I'm not working as a legal person I'm working as an historian As an historian, that is not defined in those terms.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I understand And if it is defined that way in the law, then you have no opinion to offer concerning what common knowledge
is in the United States concerning cigarette smoking and health if that's the way it's defined as I have done it in this deposition.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I'm not a lawyer. I don't know You're asking me a legal question. I don't know.

apply that definition and render any opinions based upon your research in this case, and, as I understand it, you told me you
could not Am I correct? Yes or no.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection Mischaracterizes prior testimony.
THE WITNESS: That isn't what I said You're asking me to assume a statement that in my profession is contrary to a proper
definition, and I can't do that.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And so you cannot utilize the definition I've given you to evaluate anything in this case, am I correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, that is not correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Then do it.
A Yon asked me an assumption, and I do not happen to accept an assumption that is not based upon my historical methodology.
Q You won't accept it. When I ask you to make an assumption, you refuse to do that.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I can't do that based upon my profession.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Why can't you do that?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Because I don't understand your definition of it.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q If that's the legal definition of common knowledge, then you wouldn't understand what common knowledge is meant in a
legal sense.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No I think that's untrue as well I think my definition of common knowledge, which I have rendered as a
professional historian, is the one that would be substantiated by members of my profession What your definition is is your
business, and what you are asking me to do is render it in your terms and I am not prepared to do that.

were exposed, including Joseph Ferlanti, to the health risks of smoking through widely publicized materials indicating the

of my definition of common knowledge That's what you're asking me to do.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q These are Gallup polls, correct, that you showed me earlier?
A Yes.
Q And there are other Gallup polls too Did you look at those?
A I looked at Gallup polls as they related to this matter of what people know. I looked at very few Gallup polls.
Q Why not?
A Because most of these Gallup polls look at what people believe That's correct.
Q And you don't look at them if they talk about what people believe. You just don't look at them?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No. I didn't say that I said I'm not a professional pollster, and I'm not able to examine the reliability and the
veracity of these with respect to the polling techniques.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And you did not review any poll data done by the Gallup poll interviews that were taken between 6/12 through 6/17 of
1954 concerning the question of “What is your own opinion -- do you think cigarette smoking is one of the causes of lung
cancer or not”?

A They may well have been included in there I think there are more polls.
Q Well, I'd like to see any that you have.
MR. FEIWUS: Let the record reflect that the witness is now going to the boxes to try to retrieve the polling material.
THE WITNESS: Here's a 1957 poll.
MR. FEIWUS: Note for the record that the exhibit list in this case was available to plaintiffs firm in advance of this deposition
and they had an opportunity to review these materials as well.
MR. VENABLE: Let the record reflect that the witness has handed me something entitled “Gallup Polls” with a number on
it, 19570000.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Do you understand that this exhibit consists of Gallup polls that were done in the United States?
A Yes.
Q One of the questions is “What is your opinion -- do you think that cigarette smoking is one of the causes of cancer of the lung?”.
Did I read it correctly when the answer “Yes” is 50 percent?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Would you agree with me that according to this poll, that as of July 2, 1957, according to this poll, at least, only 50 percent
of the people in this country believed that smoking was a cause of lung cancer?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That's what the poll indicated, yes.

BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Did they then divide the population up into just cigarette smoking only, those people that just smoked cigarettes?
A Yes Cigarette smokers and nonsmokers, I believe.
Q And the cigarette smokers, looking at just cigarette smokers only, only 38 percent of the population believed that cigarette
smoking was a cause of lung cancer. Is that correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Yes. Seven years before the Surgeon General's Report, that's correct, percent.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And for men cigarette smokers between the ages of 50 and 70 years, only 32 percent believed that cigarette smoking caused
lung cancer in 1957, is that correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Yes, and 46 percent of those between 60 and 70.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Do you have any reason to doubt any of the polling data that we've discussed since the first one?
A No 1957, no.
Q In 1957 had the American Cancer Society reported the results of a study on the effects of cigarette smoking?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: It had begun and reported on, in 1957, depending upon the date, a study of veterans, about 187,000 veterans,
in terms of their health records and the causes of illness and death.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q well, let me ask you this According to your testimony, there had been a great deal published in the newspapers and magazines
in this country concerning the relationship between lung cancer and cigarette smoking as of July of 1957 Isn't that true?
A There had been a statement on July 12, 1957 by the Surgeon General of the United States Burney, the results of several studies,
including one by seven experts, led him to believe that all available evidence, that's the term he used, points to the relationship
of cigarette smoking and lung cancer and he relayed that information to every public health officer in the United States.

Q I wasn't talking just 1957. During the period of time from 1950 until June of 1957, is it your understanding from the research
that you've done that it was widely disseminated in the United States information concerning the relationship between lung
cancer and cigarette smoking?
A No. That was not my testimony I indicated that between 1950 and 1965, or ‘64, when the Surgeon General's Report was
published, that an increasing crescendo of scientific reports came out By 1957, there had been several published, and there
would be more published by the time the Surgeon General's Committee met beginning in May of 1963.
Q So despite whatever was published in the literature, magazines, newspapers, appeared on television, concerning any
relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer, 50 percent of the people in the United Stated did not believe there was
any such relationship at that time, did they?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That's not accurate.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Explain to me why it's not accurate.
A It's not accurate, because you have the poll in front of you and you're not reading it correctly.
Q Tell me why I'm not reading it correctly.
A You're not reading it correctly, because what it says is that 50 percent were definitely thinking it was one of the causes, 24
percent said no, and 26 percent were undecided.
Q So 50 percent of the people had not formulated the belief that cigarette smoking was the cause of cancer by July, 1957, correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That's correct, but 50 percent had, and that's a majority when you look at the fact that 24 percent were
undecided.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Now, of cigarette smokers, despite all the information that had been published in the literature in magazines, in newspapers,
T.V., all the things that you've looked at, all the sources that you've looked at, only 38 percent of cigarette smokers believed
that cigarette smoking is one of the causes of lung cancer in 1957. Isn't that true?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: May I also look at the poll? And you'll note that that 38 percent was the highest of the three votes. There
was a “no” for 36 percent and undecided 26 percent So that is still a plurality with respect to individuals And this was, at the
time, mind you, if this poll was in June of 1957, which you indicated it was, then it did not have the most significant report
leveled in July of 1957 by the Surgeon General.

Q Did that change things a lot?
A It was a very significant one. It led the Surgeon General to contact every public health officer in the United States.
Q Did that change what people believed about the relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I think what it did is it had an impact with respect to building on this crescendo of scientific information that
had been publicly disseminated.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I want to show you another Gallup poll It asks the exact same question again in 1958. This was after that report that you
just mentioned, correct?
A Yes.
MR. FEIWUS: So the record is clear, I'm going to ask you, after you question him, since this is a document that is not from his
reliance materials, to mark it as an exhibit to the deposition. So you can do it whenever you want.
MR. VENABLE: It's right here, sir.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Is that the same question that they asked in 1957?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Yes. A year later.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And how many people, a year later, believed that cigarette smoking was one of the causes of lung cancer?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Forty-four percent, with the admonition that there is an error range of plus or minus four points.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And that's the same error in this poll, is it not?
A They're about the same.
Q Well, they're about the same, except that it appears that the number of people who believe that cigarette smoking is one of
the causes of lung cancer has actually gone down.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.

79Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
THE WITNESS: Not really When you look at the error range, you still have a plus and minus of 4 and that still gives you the
same barometer either way of around 40 to 50 percent.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q The public's belief that cigarette smoking was one of the causes of lung cancer did not become greater as a result of this
study that you were just discussing, did it?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, that's not so. It was within the same realm, the range. It could have been greater It could have been a
little less. You're still within the error range.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q About the same?
A About the same, but it's only a few months difference.
Q But it was after this important report you just told me about was then published.
A Just a few months That's correct.
I'd like to see what the number of “undecideds” were That would also bear on it.
Q These polls are available throughout what period of time? For what period of time did you find these Gallup polls?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Gallup polls were initiated in 1935. They are publicly available They are printed in a big volume, and they
are also found in newspapers as they print them. There is a big volume entitled “Gallup Polls “.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Did they continue to ask questions concerning people's belief regarding the causation of cigarette smoking and cancer?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: And continued to ask questions, yes, about what they know about it.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And you reviewed those polls, did you not, sir?
A I reviewed those polls, that is correct, as one of many indicators of exposure to the public to health and smoking risks.
Q Did you get those polls from Mr. Purvis --.

Q You didn't get those from Mr. Purvis.
A I may have gotten copies, but I had already looked at those polls.
Q Do you have any recollection of requesting the polling data from Mr. Purvis?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No. I do not have any recollection at this point, no.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And you don't have any recollection of Mr. Purvis providing that polling data to you without it being requested by you.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: If I requested it.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q That wasn't my question It wasn't very artfully done Do you have any recollection of Mr. Purvis' office providing you with
polling data even though you did not request it?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No. Mr. Purvis' office never provided me with information unless I requested it.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Have you ever seen this document?
A May I look at it?
Q Yes.
A You're holding it so tightly, I didn't know whether you wanted me to see it.
No. This was not disseminated in the media.
MR. FEIWUS: Can we just identify what it is for the record or mark it as an exhibit?

MR. VENABLE: It's a study of attitudes towards cigarette smoking and different types of cigarettes, January 1959.
MR. FEIWUS: Is that a J. Walter Thompson document?
MR. VENABLE: I don't know anything about J. Walter Thompson.
MR. FEIWUS: Is there a Bates number on it?
MR. VENABLE: 1001754030.
MR. FEIWUS: It's not in here This is something different then.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q There are a number of news clips, VHS tapes here.
A Uh-huh.
Q And my question is whether or not you were the person who determined which news clips to be utilized?
Let me see if I can find them.
Evening News clips.
A Yes. These came from the Vanderbilt archives The Vanderbilt archives begins in 1968 That's why this beginning date is
1968 They go beyond 1990 now And, yes, I had segmented those that were related to smoking and health out and they were
put on this table.
Q So you were the one that said, “I want you to make me a videotape with each of these evening news clips on it”.
A That's correct. And I asked that it be not necessarily in that form in terms of all on one tape, but they're relatively short so,
basically, you can look at them.
Q Did you make any tapes or requested any tapes be made wherein positive statements were being made about cigarette
smoking?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: In terms of evening news segments?
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Yes.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection What do you mean by positive?
THE WITNESS: I don't understand what that means.

Q Did you seek to identify statements being made by persons on evening news shows that sought to disseminate the concept
that the relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer had not been established?
A Oh, yes. In fact, as I did my reliance materials and as part of it, you will find statements in the press and in the magazines,
and I think on some of these in which there are statements they are putting in the position of the tobacco industry or a scientist
who works for the tobacco industry.
So every attempt was made to deal with every aspect of the matter of smoking and health, whether it came from a source such
as the Surgeon General or whether it came from the tobacco industry.
Q So if I watch this tape I'm going to see statements on there from representatives of the tobacco industry wherein it is argued
that the relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer had not been established.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I'll find that on here?
A You may find some reference to it You will certainly find it, more likely, in print media, and the reason for that is those are
largely 30 minute segments per total news segment and the tobacco issue may only be 30 seconds. In a news story that relates to
smoking and health, it can be extensive and the tobacco industry's position is put there So there may be some of that. Although,
by 1968, the tobacco industry's position was getting relatively little space and limited news segment time. The position of the
industry would more likely appear in print media.
Q So you don't know if there are any of those statements by the tobacco industry spokesman that are contained in any of the
82 excerpts from the evening news.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I don't recall whether there are or not, but, as I said, I'm certain that in the media presentation, print media,
that there is evidence because there's more room to do it.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q If there had been statements by representatives of the tobacco industry on an evening news show wherein it was contended
that the relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer had not yet been established, if such statements were made on
the evening news, would you have included them on this tape?
A Absolutely.
Q So you did not edit them out in any way.
A Absolutely, nor did we edit out all the materials in which the tobacco industry's position is given.
Q So when you collected the articles from the various newspapers, you always would collect statements made by or on behalf
of the industry?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
83Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A Absolutely, and there were a few cases in which the tobacco industry's position was the lead part of the story in which a
particular tobacco industry spokesman or a tobacco institute person would be interviewed.
Q And the tobacco industry continued to maintain that position well into the 1990's, did they not?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: What position?
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q That the relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer had not been established.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I think the position of the tobacco industry was not accurately stated by you The position of the tobacco
industry, throughout these years, as referenced in the publicly disseminated materials, which I relied on, was, one, that the
scientific causation had not been determined, that the determination that had been made by studies had been statistical and that
more research needed to be made.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And they maintained that position up until, at least, through the 1990's, did they not?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: They maintained the position with respect to the position of scientific causation, more research and statistical.
That is correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And they maintained the position up through the 1990's that cigarette smoking, and, particularly, nicotine, was not addictive.
Isn't that true?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: The tobacco industry, as I see the publicly disseminated information, with regard to the tobacco industry as
it was publicly disseminated, widely disseminated, was that tobacco smoking was not addictive.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And they maintained that position up until the late 1990's, did they not?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I believe that is the position that the tobacco industry maintained, although there were some breaks in terms
of specific companies.
BY MR. VENABLE:

84Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q Well, do you recall seeing all of the CEO's of the major tobacco manufacturers in this country standing before the
congressional hearing and swearing to tell the truth and testifying that nicotine and cigarette smoking is not addictive?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
Mischaracterizes prior testimony.
THE WITNESS: I do recall that the tobacco industry spokesman did have their views on tobacco smoking and that many of
them believed that it was not addictive, yes.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And the concept that had yet to be demonstrated that cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer, that idea had been
disseminated by the tobacco industry throughout the time that there was information also being disseminated that there was a
relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer Isn't that true?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That was disseminated, but the press that it got was relatively nothing compared to the information coming
from the scientific community that there were health risks In other words, I did a demonstration in one case in which the number
of articles and the number of videos that pointed out that there were health risks in smoking established a pile that was three
feet high and the number of articles that were disseminated giving the tobacco industry's position was very, very small, in terms
of an inch or so.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q During the 1950's, and even into the 1960's, did the tobacco industry often comment and their comments recorded in the
newspaper articles, for instance, that were published at the time?
A The general trend was that in the early 1950's the tobacco industry got some space in the newspapers and in the media As
time went on, as the scientific publications were widely disseminated, the tobacco industry's position declined to such an extent
that sometimes when the tobacco industry gave a particular contrary view, it was not reported in the press at all.
Q Now, the tobacco industry did utilize advertising to communicate messages to the public, did they not?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: They used what was called position paper advertising. In other words, they paid for space, as o??l companies
did in the 1970's and ‘80's, to state their position, because their position was not being picked up by the general press.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Did you make any attempt in your analysis to determine what impact advertising by the tobacco industry had on the beliefs
of the American population concerning cigarettes and their likely cause of lung cancer?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
85Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
THE WITNESS: Again my particular focus of research was not on beliefs of Americans with regard to their health risks of
smoking, but the extent to which they were given widely disseminated information about the health risks of smoking.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q One of the things that they were given were advertisements, was it not?
A Are you talking about the position paper advertisements?
Q No. I'm talking about the advertisement of cigarette manufacturers that appeared in magazines, particularly, and other media,
concerning the desirability of their product. That's some of the information the American public received about cigarettes, is
it not?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: During what time period?
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q During the 1950's.
A Yes.
Q The 1960's.
A Yes. Anything that dealt with tobacco was examined with regard to advertisements The assumption of the researcher and
the assumption, I think, of the ordinary American is that advertisements are designed to sell products They are not designed to
provide health information with respect to the risks of certain items.
Q Did you do any study of the American population to determine whether or not they believed that cigarette advertisements
were not an accurate source of information regarding health risks?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I have a poll to that effect I think there's one here on Gallup with regard to commercials, television commercials.
This is a Gallup poll of 1959, which points out “How do you feel about television commercials? Do you think they are untruthful
arguments or not?” Sixty-seven percent said yes, 19 percent said no, and 14 percent had no opinion.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And did you rely upon this poll?
A I did.
Q This poll is about what people think.
A That's right.
Q I didn't think you relied upon polls about what people think.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
86Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A There is a differentiation here in terms of the matter of television advertisements This is what they know, what they think
I think that is perfectly legitimate.
Q So this think question is okay for you, but most think questions and polls are not okay for you.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I gave you polls that also looked at belief.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And you're relying upon them.
A I'm relying upon them Indeed I am Absolutely.
Q After you had your meeting on January 12th of ‘05 with Mr. Feiwus and Mr. Ball, when is the next time that you met with
anyone concerning the Ferlanti case?
A Yesterday.
Q Who did you meet with at that point?
A I met with Mr. Ball only to make certain that all my reliance materials had come. Mr. Feiwus came late in the day, and he
saw that I had gotten all my materials We met very briefly.
Q So Mr. Ball came down to make sure you got everything from the Purvis law firm?
A Yes.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: He made certain that all the materials that I had requested had come and had been put in boxes and were
available for my deposition.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And they had come from the Purvis law firm, hadn't they?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: All of these were duplicated either by the Purvis firm or by the Clarke, Silverglat firm in terms of having
them ready for you.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So everything in this room was furnished by lawyers, am I correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
87Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
THE WITNESS: No. They were duplicated by lawyers Much of the material that you see in these boxes was attained by me
through my research at several repositories throughout the United States, and these materials were so designated and they were
for facilitation purposes provided for you today.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Have you gone through to verify the accuracy of what we have here today that this is in fact what you gave to the Purvis
law firm?
A That's what I did yesterday.
Q And you went through each and every box and verified each and every document yesterday.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I had done that, yes.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q How long did that take you yesterday?
A Several hours.
Q And what were you using to compare it to? Let's take this box right here This is an example. Would you show me how
you did that yesterday. You don't have to do the whole box Just give me an illustration of how you went through it and what
you compared it to.
MR. FEIWUS: By the way, I have an additional objection You again have characterized it as materials from the Purvis firm
and he has testified that some of it came from Purvis, was reproduced by the Purvis firm, and some of it was produced by the
Clarke, Silverglat firm.
THE WITNESS: These are materials from the Bergen County Record that I had identified in terms of going through the Bergen
County Record Then I went through them chronologically to make sure that they were all here and they had been reproduced.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Is the date on them every day?
A Yes Not every day Only those that relate to smoking and health.
Q How do you know, for instance, you tell me what you would compare it to if this one wasn't here? How would you know
that that one wasn't here?
A I wouldn't know if it was there, except for the fact that I had a rough count and took a number.
Q So you have somewhere a list of numbers?
A No. I had a relatively reasonable list in terms of how many of these things by number are here.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
88Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q Well, how many were in this box?
A I have no idea in terms of numbers, but I do know that this particular box contains the Bergen County Record from July 16,
1970, or, rather -- yes, July 16, 1970 up through and including November 18, 1977.
MR. FEIWUS: Just so the record is clear, we're talking about a box that's marked Exhibit 6671-6882, and I believe that they
correspond to an exhibit list that has been provided to plaintiff So if you have a question about whether or not a particular
document in that box is actually marked as an exhibit on the exhibit list, show him the exhibit list and show him the documents.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q My question to you, sir, is what did you nave available to you?
A I had an exhibit list that I had devised and which the Purvis firm, on my request, did devise.
Q Where is that?
A It is a list I thought it was publicly available.
MR. FEIWUS: I don't have one with me I assumed that one has been made.
THE WITNESS: I thought that was made available to you.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Did you create an exhibit list?
A I asked that it be created, an exhibit list -- excuse me It's not an exhibit list A reliance list.
Q A reliance list?
A That's right.
MR. VENABLE: Do we have a reliance list?
MR. FEIWUS: I assume that was provided to you.
THE WITNESS: These are all the materials. Everything that I have in here is on a list.
MR. FEIWUS: My understanding is that the reliance materials are identified on the exhibit list Whether or not they have been
separately broken out for you or not, is a question that you can answer.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q My question to you is did you tell them which items were going to be on the reliance list?
A Yes, I did.

89Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q Did you tell them verbally?
A Yes I told them the years of the Bergen County Record. I told them the years of the Gallup polls. And I assumed that was
given to you.
Q So for all these documents in here that are on your reliance list, you verbally told them to put those documents on your
reliance list, correct?
A I verbally told them to put the Bergen County Record that I had identified, and Readers Digest, these lists I had prepared
for other cases that were used by me, in those cases, and which I asked for from previous exhibit lists and reliance lists to
be put on there.
Q Did you give them a list or did you just call them up and tell them?
A Called them. They know, indeed, those areas which I've used in the past I did a massive reliance list when I did my first case
in Engel, and that was the basis for these From that, I've extracted those that are relevant for the other cases.
Q What did you take off of your list from Engel?
A Well, the Tampa Tribune There was no indication that the Ferlantis lived in Tampa The St Petersburg Times. There was a
plaintiff that lived in St Petersburg. The Orlando Sentinel There are other newspapers.
Q So you took other newspapers off the list.
A Yes. And other documents in terms of the time that would have no relevance to this case.
Q Did you conduct any research concerning newspapers for this particular case that had never been done before?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Yes The Bergen County Record I had started on with Engel, because I thought that we would have a plaintiff
from Bergen County So the Bergen County Record was the one that I spent most of the time on.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Did you prepare that for Engel or did you do that solely for this case?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: For this case.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Why did you pick the Bergen County Record?
A Because Mr. and Mrs. Ferlanti lived in Bergen County from 1960 to 1977.
Q What information had you ascertained concerning Mr. Ferlanti's habit of reading the newspaper?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
90Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A According to the deposition testimony, there was deposition testimony that he did read newspapers, particularly when he
came to Florida on occasion He also read the newspapers in New Jersey and in Brooklyn, in New York, where he lived.
Q Does it matter for your opinions in this case as to whether or not Mr. Ferlanti read the newspaper or not?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I treat Mr. Ferlanti, from all the evidence that I've been provided for in terms of the depositions, as an ordinary
American. He watched television. He read newspapers He went to movies. He had children, who went to school, and received,
by this time, instruction with respect to the health risks of smoking. So it did matter only in the sense that location was important
So I would not use a paper, such as the Tampa Tribune, which would have no relevance.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q My question to you, sir, is, if I understand your opinion correctly, you have no opinion as to what Mr. Ferlanti knew or didn't
know about the health risks associated with cigarette smoking Am I incorrect in that?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I have an opinion to the extent that Mr. Ferlanti was exposed to the health risks of smoking during the period
of that time That's my opinion.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q When you say exposed, let me make sure I understand -- what's the name of this paper again, the Bergen County Record?
A That is correct.
Q When you say exposed to it, do you mean it was in his house?
A No.
Q Do you mean that he looked at it?
A No.
Q Do you mean it was in the county where he lived?
A That's right.
Q So for the purposes of your opinion, it doesn't matter whether he saw this paper ever or not, does it?
A It's part of the information environment. It is one of many, many parts of that information environment that is part of his
culture in the world in which he lived at the time.
Q Well, that's a very long answer, but I think there's a yes or no Does it make any difference, yes or no, to your opinion in this
case as to whether or not Mr. Ferlanti actually saw and read the Bergen County Record?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
91Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
THE WITNESS: It makes no difference relative to a specific article or a specific story. It does make a difference in terms of
the fact that it was part of the information environment in the area in which he lived which was around him. It was the same
for television programs. It was part of that environment.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Here's what I'm trying to get to I want to know what difference it makes, if any, whether or not he actually read and saw this
newspaper, the Bergen County Record, to your opinion, does that matter or does that not matter in your opinion if he actually
saw it? Not that it was in the county, not that it was part of the information that he was exposed to, but whether he actually,
in fact, saw this newspaper.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection Asked and answered.
THE WITNESS: My answer is the same as it was before. It's part of the information environment. The historian has no way
to take a camera into Mr. Ferlanti's house to know what he reads or sees. The historian recreates an environment in which a
person lives, and by virtue of recreating that environment, makes assumptions, and the assumption is that this information, in so
many areas -- newspapers, magazines, television, physician materials, educational materials, movies, popular culture, slang -
this was part of the information environment, and that information environment played a role in exposing him. To what degree
any one played a greater part than another, the historian can't recreate.
So it does make a difference in that Mr. Ferlanti was part of this environment Every indication was that he was literate He
read. He watched television According to his children, he did read. He did watch television He did go to the movies So it does
make a difference.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q You said that you were making an assumption, but I never heard it What assumption are you making in this case?
A The assumption is that this information is there The historian does not have a video camera to go into a person's house and
know what they read or saw, but the historian recreates the community around him, and, therefore, by recreating that community,
it gives the historian insight as to whether or not this information, in one form or another, was part of his environment, and
my conclusion is that it was.
Q Was part of his environment Does that mean that he saw it?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I've answered that question, and the answer is no.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Okay I just want to make sure So you're not making an assumption that he saw or read anything that you've seen or read.
A I'm making an assumption that specific things that I have read, no. What I'm saying is that he's part of this environment in
which there is a multitude of the environment aspects. This was part of his life.
Q Within that environment that you have now defined with this information, how many people believed the information was
true and how many people didn't believe the information was true?

MR. FEIWUS: Objection Beyond the scope Asked and answered.
THE WITNESS: Again, I've answered that question before. My research was designed to ascertain the extent to which this
information was disseminated, widely disseminated information regarding the health risks of smoking.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q You don't know what percentage of the people believed the information that was part of this environment or didn't believe it.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Well, you make inferences, you make assumptions, and, obviously, if 50 million Americans quit smoking
in the period of 1965 -- I mean a smaller proportion of Americans smoke today than did in 1942. There are all sorts of rules
and regulations that make it extremely difficult for people to smoke today. There is, without doubt, a significant movement
with regard to the health aspects of nonsmoking in the United States Of course, you can measure the impact Whether you can
measure it one by one, no, but it's obvious, in the materials that I had presented you with in terms of psa's, there was information
there that one out of five people who quit attributed their quitting to William Talman's psa. So you can make assumptions on it.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So you're making assumptions in this case concerning the impact of this information upon the public?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Because you have hard information to back it up.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q But you are making assumptions.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Based upon the hard information which I have, yes, and to which I just gave reference.
MR. FEIWUS: It's 2 40 I just want to get a sense, and we can do this on the record or off the record, but just in terms of getting
him out of here, if you can give us some indication.
MR. VENABLE: We have a ways to go yet It would help if he would more tightly answer the questions, but I can't help that.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Would you agree with me that if a person never read certain printed material and was never told about it that he would learn
nothing from that printed material?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, I wouldn't agree.

Q Tell me how it is that if you don't read it and nobody tells you anything about it that you learn something from it.
A Visually There are all sorts of visual signs that would convey danger.
Q I have a piece of paper here If you don't read it and nobody tells you anything about it, can you tell me what's on it?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection Asked and answered.
THE WITNESS: I told you if there is a visual manifestation of it, that gives you a message that can be understood That's my
answer. If I have a visual manifestation of it. Often messages are communicated by simple visual means A classic illustration
of that is just a sign It has no sort of written material on it, and it has a marking through it which says “Don't do that”.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Let me take a newspaper. I wasn't talking about a sign You've got something from the Bergen County Record, September
11, 1970 Correct?
A That's right.
Q And it's Number 6676 Right there.
A Okay.
Q If you never saw this and no one ever told you about it, would you know what was in this article?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q You never saw it and no one ever told you about it.
A I may have found it in another source In other words, this is a specific article about Ralph Nader You may have seen it
on television This could have been printed or this could have been a video of Ralph Nader given in a news conference So no
one told me about it.
Let me just explain it You won't let me explain it You're asking me a hypothetical You're saying if I've never seen that and no
one told me about it would I know anything about it, and the answer is you would if you derived it from another source That's
what this intellectual, this so-called information environment is all about.
Q You wouldn't have derived it from this source, would you?
A Absolutely not, but you could derive it from another.
Q So we can agree that if a person doesn't read something, that at least from that source he doesn't get the information if
somebody doesn't tell him about it.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.

THE WITNESS: Unless he got it from another source.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I said if he doesn't get it from another source.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That's a hypothetical that assumes that people live in caves I find that difficult to assume.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I know you do. I know you do. I'm just trying to establish a simple fact, that at least as to that source, it may be a newspaper
article or a magazine article, as to that particular source of information, that if you don't see it and nobody tells you about it,
then you don't know anything about it.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Again, you may have already seen it in another form I just find it very difficult to exclude everything.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q If I don't see a movie, do I still know what's on the movie? I don't see it, but do I know what's on it?
A You may have heard about it.
Q It just floated in on the air or something?
A You may have heard about it.
Q May have heard about it.
A Sure. Absolutely.
Q If I didn't see the movie and I didn't hear about the movie, is there any way that movie just seeps all into me from this outside
source and just gets all into me and I know about it --.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q -- or do I have to see it?
A Well, from another source.
Q Another source?
A Huh, huh.

Q Movies just kind of move around sources?
A No. There are all sorts of descriptions of movies. You can find out descriptions of movies on the internet. If you've never see
it, you can go on the internet and you can recreate this intellectual environment. You can just stick with google com.
Q They were doing a lot of that in 1960? They were doing Google searches back in the ‘60's?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: You can certainly do it through other means.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So I don't have to see a movie to know what a movie is. I don't even have to go to the movies. I don't have to waste my five
bucks. I just sit at home and I wait and the movie will come down to me somehow or other and I'll know what's on it.
MR. FEIWUS: You can always read the Readers Digest version of the movie.
THE WITNESS: Again, you can find many references. You can find, for example, in the newspapers, they give you all the
highlights of the new movies. Every Friday in the Sun Sentinel here in Fort Lauderdale you can get the whole shebang of every
movie that's running or intends to run. You don't have to see it.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Will I get a chance to see specific scenes in the movie from people telling me about it?
A Yes, you can. Some of these things are very dramatic I just saw “Million Dollar Baby” the other day I had a friend of mine
see it before me and he had pretty much explained everything in it, much to my chagrin, and I wasted six bucks.
Q You got a bunch of movies that you want to show the jury, don't you?
A We're not going to show all these movies, no.
Q Let's find out what movies you're going to show.
A We haven't determined what movies we're going to show.
Q You haven't determined it yet.
A No.
Q What is it about Double Wedding that you think you want to show the jury?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I would have to see it again I haven't seen that in a long time.

Q Tell me what the movie is about.
A I don't remember.
Q Did you watch the movie?
A Yes, of course, I did, and I can tell you some of the movies that I -.
Q Well, I'll ask you.
Tell me who is in Double Wedding.
A I don't know.
Q But you watched it.
A I did.
Q How long was the movie?
A I have no idea.
Q Did you watch the full version of all these movies?
A Some I did Some I did not.
Q Some you just watched what Mr. Purvis wanted you to see?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, that's not correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q How did you get the clips?
A Some of them, indeed, I had seen I just saw a Richard Widrnark movie the other day, and I told Mr. Purvis about it, that it
would be a good movie. It was done in 1967.
I saw the American Broadway series on PBS I watch a lot of movies and I've done a lot of research on it.
Q Do you bill them every time you watch a movie just in case you come across something that you like?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, I do not.

Q You don't bill for that It's a freebie.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q When you're watching a movie at home and you see something that might help the tobacco industry, you get on the phone
and call Mr. Purvis?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I thought that's what you told me you did.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No What I do is I select a lot of movie information that I believe would be useful in terms of providing more
information about this information environment.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So tell me about “Healthy, Wealthy, and Dumb,” what was that movie about?
A The Three Stooges.
Q And that's the 1938?
A Huh, huh.
Q So I assume that you must have found that one on your own You did all the research on that one.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q You didn't find that one on your own?
A No.
Q Mr. Purvis gave you that one.

98Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A Don't remember that one.
Q Well, it keeps coming up over and over again so I was just wondering if all you historians were out watching all these movies
or not, because you-all seem to be watching the same show
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So you didn't find this one yourself?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I answered that I said no.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q The “Strawberry Blond,” what's that one about?
A I don't recall that one.
Q Who's the star in it, do you know?
A I don't remember it.
Q But you saw it?
A I did.
Q And the “Saboteur”?
A Yes. That's a Humphrey Bogart movie.
Q Is that a good flick?
A It's a great flick.
MR. FEIWUS: Good. I'll watch that one.
BY MR. VENABLE.
Q “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo “.
A Van Johnson. It's one of my favorite movies of all time.
Q What's in that that's good for the tobacco companies?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection. Can you really try and reduce the argumentative question?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
99Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
MR. VENABLE: I'm not. I'm just asking what's in there that he felt was helpful to the tobacco companies.
MR. FEIWUS: I mean, to say that it's helpful to the tobacco companies is, obviously, argumentative and that's not what this
witness is here for.
You know we've been here a long time and if you need to take a break to calm down, we can do that too. So let's all take a deep
breath and make it go like a deposition and not like a carnival.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q What did you find was particularly helpful to you in “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo”?
MR. FEIWUS: Helpful to him?
MR. VENABLE: Yes.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That movie was relevant, because during the period of World War II there was a statement by Van Johnson
in that film about smoking cigarettes hurting you, killing you. This, I think, was in 1942 or so, and that's the segment.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Why in the world would that be relevant to this case?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Because it's 1942 and there's widespread knowledge, at least in the movie industry, being disseminated by
soldiers about the adverse health effects of smoking.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Why would you say that's widespread knowledge? It's one actor reading a line in a movie.
A It's one of many movies in these early periods.
Q You just told me this indicated widespread knowledge of this fact among the movie industry, and I'm trying to understand
how one line in one movie being read off of a script by one actor indicated widespread knowledge of anything.
A It's very conclusive. It's the industry saying, “Hey, this can hurt you. This can kill you “.
Q Why do you say it's the industry saying that? Why do you assume that the industry was involved in it?
A Not the industry. The movie. The movie company.
Q Which movie company?
A I don't know who it is.

100Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q How did you know whether they believed that or not?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Again, we're not talking about belief. This is the information that's being disseminated about the health risks
of smoking.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Was this an informational movie? Was this intended to instruct and educate?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I answered the question.
This is becoming an argumentative thing Movies are for entertainment. Entertainment often provides information about the
culture in which people live.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So do you have an opinion as to whether or not this was intended as an educational movie?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: All movies provide information.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Well, they might provide information, but is it your understanding that people go to movies expecting to receive factual
information”?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Movies provide information. How people are exposed to it, what they do with it, is another issue.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q “Mr Peabody and the Mermaid “.
A Yes I remember the movie I can't remember who stared in it.
Q What was it about?
A It's a mermaid. He found a mermaid I don't recall the antismoking lines in it.
Q “But Not For Me”.
A Yes. I remember that movie. I don't remember the stars.

101Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q What was it about?
A Don't recall.
Q “Sweet Bird of Youth “.
A Yes. Paul Newman, and I can see another face Paul Newman was the star.
Q What was that about?
A It started with his female counterpart saying “Get me a cigarette,” and he said something to the effect “The kind that kills
you?” or “The kind that causes cancer?”.
Q So what was important about that?
A Here in this early time period the recognition of cigarettes and cancer was identified and communicated.
Q Do you think that was an important source of information for the. American public about the relationship between cigarette
smoking and cancer?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: It was one source.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Was it an important source?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: It was one source.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Let me ask you this. If somebody had heard that a physician had reported a relationship between lung cancer and agarette
smoking and did not believe that physician, do you think they would have believed this actor reading a line?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I don't know, because I didn't measure belief. Remember I measured the extent to which knowledge was
widely disseminated.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So how many movies have you reviewed to determine whether or not they might have something positive or negative to
say about cigarettes?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
102Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
THE WITNESS: I don't know I've looked at a lot of them. The only difficulty with movies, and the same thing with p.s.a.'s, is
they are not like newspapers where they are put in an orderly day by day fashion. So some of these are very difficult to find.
Sometimes it's done on a hit or miss basis. They do not adhere to a clear methodology, as with newspapers and magazines,
which are published and you can look at everyday.
So these were some of those that I have relied upon, because the Ferlantis, according to deposition testimony, would go to the
movies at least once a week.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q In your review of movies in this regard and thinking about it in this regard, would you agree with me that in many movies,
especially during the 1950's and the 1960's, smoking was portrayed in a glamorous manner?
A Absolutely I would agree.
Q And you would agree with me, would you not, that the tobacco industry was paying, in many cases, for their cigarettes to
be used in movies?
A That I don't know.
Q No one ever told you that?
A Don't know that.
Q So how do we measure the impact of this glamorous use of cigarettes in movies against some of these statements that you
have identified in these movies you want to play to the jury?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: You don't You recognize that there are all sorts of reasons why people make decisions to smoke or not to
smoke. I'm not involved in that business. I don't measure, for example, why people decide to smoke. My focus has been on the
extent to which individuals have been exposed to the widely disseminated information about the health risks of smoking.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Would you agree with me that when people watched movies in the 1950's and 1960's, they got mixed messages about smoking?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I think there is little doubt that there were a lot of people smoking in the 1950's in movies, and movies were
replete with that, but at the same time there was being presented a whole new body of evidence from the scientific community
that was being disseminated widely in the press that cigarettes were harmful.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And there were glamorous advertisements from the tobacco industry, tobacco companies, about smoking cigarettes, correct,
during the 1950's and 1960's?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
103Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A There were, and, as indicated, smoking advertisements, as illustrated by some polls, were not deemed to be truthful.
Overwhelmingly 67 percent believed them to be untruthful, and most people don't turn to advertisements to get their health
information.
Q I didn't say there was health information. I said it was glamorous, glamorous advertisements being produced by the tobacco
industry in the 1950's and 1960's.
A As indeed for every other industry.
Q I understand.
Now, what training do you have to determine how any population or group or individual takes mixed messages and processes
them? What training do you have in that regard”?
MR. FEIWUS Objection.
THE WITNESS I don't, and, again, that would be only relevant in terms of belief and I'm not here for belief. I'm here in terms
of what people are exposed to.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So you claim no expertise in how a population or group processes information and determines belief?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That is correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Let me just ask you, do you believe everything that you read?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Do you believe everything that you see on TV?
A No.
Q Do you believe everything that you hear?
A No.
Q Did you have any information from the depositions as to whether or not Mr. Ferlanti knew about the dangers of smoking
cigarettes in the 1960's?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection. Asked and answered You already covered those in the first hour.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
104Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
THE WITNESS: Again, I didn't deal with the issue of knowing. I dealt with the issue whether he was exposed to it.
BY MR. VENABLE.
Q Well, you have looked at that before in other cases, haven't you?
A No.
Q You've looked at knowledge, have you not?
A No, I have not.
Q So you didn't look at that information at all to determine what Mr. Ferlanti knew or didn't know about smoking and health risks.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Nor is my opinion, as I stated here, related to that.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Do you have any reason to doubt the veracity of the family members of Mr. Ferlanti?
A Absolutely not. No reason to doubt it.
MR. FEIWUS: I just want to interpose an objection to that last question.
MR. VENABLE: Let's take ten minutes.
(Thereupon, a brief recess was taken ).
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q What effect, if any, did the use by the cigarette manufacturers of sports figures to promote cigarettes have on the information
that was being disseminated to the American public?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection Lack of foundation Beyond the scope.
THE WITNESS: As I indicated to you, advertising is the subject in which you don't find as a source of health information,
and, as indicated by polls, that advertising is generally viewed as untruthful. So I have no way to ascertain the extent to which
these sports figures would help the promotion, in view of the health information that's coming forth, indicating the health risks
of smoking.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q In looking at those ads as an historian, did you come away with the idea that the ads were, by the use of sports figures smoking
cigarettes, suggesting, at least, that cigarettes did not impact upon one's sports ability?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
105Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
THE WITNESS: In terms of looking at advertisements again, Americans are very savvy with regard to the poll information
with regard to advertising and advertising is designed to sell products, and it doesn't matter what product it is, there's a lot of
huff and puff and a lot of inflation in terms of product. People recognize that.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I wasn't asking about the contact of the public in that question. I was really asking you, as an historian, as you looked at those
ads -- and you've written about advertisements in American industry, haven't you?
A I've written about, certainly, the fact, in my textbook, that Americans have been increasingly advertising savvy, which means
that they believe less and less of it.
Q But you've written about advertising by American industry, have you not?
A But in that context what I just indicated to you.
Q And I'm asking you, as an historian, looking at those ads did they appear to you to be an effort by cigarette manufacturers
to suggest that smoking cigarettes did not impair one's athletic ability?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I don't know that, because, again, you had all this -- well, you're asking me the intent of the tobacco companies
--.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Yeah, I am.
A -- and I really don't know.
Q Couldn't figure that out.
A Well, I don't know that. I'm not here as an expert on the intent of advertising of tobacco companies.
Q You talk about various sources of information and the effects upon people and their beliefs, or, at least, what they're exposed to.
A Correct.
Q And another source that is available to people that they're exposed to is beliefs of their family members, correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: The information of the family members, yes.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q That can be very strong information to which one is exposed is the beliefs of the family members, can it not?

106Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: It is part of the information environment. It is just one aspect of many segments, yes.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q For instance, children that are born of Jewish parents, as an historian, do you recognize that in most instances they will remain
of the Jewish faith their entire lives?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I'm not an authority on that I don't know that.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q That's not something you've encountered in your experience.
A That's not something I have researched That's the point.
Q The information that's provided by family members is that information that's publicly disseminated?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I'm not certain I understand the question.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q The beliefs expressed, for instance, by a father to a son, is that information that's publicly disseminated or is that information
that resides within the home?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That's within the home.
That is not within the realm of my research.
There is no way for me to measure that.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So mat's a source of information to which human beings are exposed that you're not able to get out and measure, is that correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That's a source that's similar to that with respect to peers. An historian cannot go into a room, a classroom, or
into a meeting house, a home These are private associations. They are not within the realm of the historian to research.

Q You have on your list of things that you may present to the jury some textbooks, is that correct?
A Uh-huh.
Q As I understand it, those are textbooks that you believe were utilized in some schools in the United States.
A These were textbooks that were in fact printed in the United States, and, according to adoption lists, which states publish,
were used in various states.
Q What is an adoption list?
A States maintain, state departments of education, they maintain archives, which include, over the years, rules and regulations
regarding textbooks and how they're adopted, and in many states certain texts have to be preapproved by a board and from this
list teachers may select texts for their use.
Q Were you able to research as to these texts that were approved in various states which ones were selected by which school
districts or which teachers?
A No. You cannot do that You can do it by district You can often do it by -- well, for example, in the City of New York, the
City of New York is much easier because it does indicate for the city, but in some counties, that is not the case, and for specific
schools, it is not. So it varies from state to state.
Q With respect to Mr. Ferlanti, were you able to ascertain which textbooks were used in his school system?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No I was able to ascertain that he did attend PS105 in Brooklyn, New York, and then went on to a middle
school and then on to high school. I do have the approved texts, a list of them that were used during this time period in the. City
of New York, but I could not designate for his particular grade and class which ones were actually used.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q There's one textbook, I think, that you referenced in prior testimony. I think it was published in 1924 or something. Do you
know the one I'm talking about?
A No, I don't.
MR. VENABLE: Let's see if we can get it.
MR. FEIWUS: These are materials that we are pulling out of the exhibits in the room, not materials that you're bringing from
somewhere else.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So you have an approved list of textbooks by the state to be used in the schools of that state, correct?
A Or the city. And that is not for every state Many states do that.
Q What if a school district elects not to use the text at all, is there any rule that says they have to use the text?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
108Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A My understanding is from reading the regulations of the various states that there are exceptions permitted, but it does not
seem to be the rule that there are exceptions permitted.
Q What if they want to use no text?
A I have no idea about that.
In terms of the regulations from, let's say, during the period during World War II and afterwards, my understanding from looking
at the rules and regulations is that there is pretty much adherence to it. Afterwards state laws differed even more so in terms
of providing teachers with opportunities to chose texts.
Q Well, do you have any information which suggests that a teacher was required to use a textbook in the New York City schools?
A At what time?
Q In, let's say, in the 1930's and ‘40's.
A According to the regulations, as I recall them, and they are in the reliance list, according to the regulations there was, as I
recall, a regulation to the effect that you had to use, if not a textbook, you had to follow a curriculum In other words, they gave
you a curriculum week by week in various courses.
Q Could you help us locate that regulation?
A I might have it for the State of New Jersey, which was the state where Mr. Ferlanti's children went to school.
It would be a New Jersey statute, or I may not have referenced it for this case except for the children.
MR. FEIWUS: This is the material that Angel pulled out.
THE WITNESS: That's it.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Let me show you what has been marked, I believe, as Exhibit 6378. It appears to be a statute for the State of New Jersey.
Is it dated the laws of 1903?
A That's correct.
Q And do you know if that statute remained unchanged through the period of the early 1940's?
A Yes. It is updated After the Surgeon General's Report in 1964, it was strengthened to define more specifically narcotics and
cigarettes.
Q At the time it did not include cigarettes as a narcotic, did it?
A It did.
Q Can you show me?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
109Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A Well, it didn't state that. In actual practice, however, from my experience in looking at these state laws, I don't know if you
have any of the curriculum guides, but tobacco was interpreted in many states as a narcotic.
Q Tell me what specific information you have that in New Jersey in that 1903 act that tobacco was being treated as a narcotic?
And your answer is?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: My answer is alcohol and tobacco Here it is 1915, subsequent to that act, where alcohol and tobacco is part of
the instructions. You can look at all this Here's another one in 1917, which also interprets alcohol and narcotics with reference
to tobacco as a narcotic.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I was looking in here for some requirement that -- and let me give you these, because you know them better than I do --
one of the textbooks approved -- strike that. I was looking in there for a requirement that a teacher must use a textbook to
teach hygiene --.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q -- and I was wondering if you could locate that for me.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: It does say experiments suggested in textbooks should be carried out in the schoolrooms. So there is reference
to textbooks.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q There's reference to textbooks Is there a reference in there mandating the use of a textbook to teach health and hygiene?
A Not in these materials.
Q Do you have any other materials where you believe that it mandated that a teacher in New Jersey use a textbook to teach
health and hygiene?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: At this moment, I cannot think of where that might be, but it may well be in the reliance materials.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q From your investigation were you able to ascertain which of the approved textbooks were used in any particular school in
New Jersey?
A No.

Q And the same is true for New York I believe you already told me that you can't determine which particular textbook might
have been used in a particular school.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I believe that's correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Do you recall this book? This is the one I was talking about, the 1924.
A All right. What about it?
Q Do you remember reviewing this?
A I believe I used this in the Lukacs case I'm not certain.
Q My question to you is do you have any information --.
MR. FEIWUS: Can we mark this for the record or identify it for the court reporter? And I note with respect to the earlier reliance
materials on the statutes and regulations, nothing was identified for the record as to what we're talking about So it's your record.
MR. VENABLE: I don't care 19240000.
MR. FEIWUS: That's the exhibit number, I guess?
MR. VENABLE I guess so “Emmerson CP et al, Hygiene and Health Series, Physiology and Hygiene Book II,” and the book
is dated 1924?
THE WITNESS: Do we have a case in which that was referenced by me?
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Yes, but I don't have a question about it right now about the case. I was just trying to see if I could refresh your recollection
so we had to find it. That didn't work, so we found it.
My question to you, sir, is do you have any information in any of your reliance materials or any other source to tell me whether
or not this particular book was used in any particular school district?
A No, I do not.
Q Do you have information where you believe it was approved for use in certain districts?
A Yes.
Q Do you have any information which would suggest to you that that textbook was used in any school in which Mr. Ferlanti

111Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, I do not.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I believe that you have selected a number of statutes wherein various states had some prohibition against the sale of certain
tobacco products at certain times, is that correct?
A That is correct.
Q Were you aware of any movement in this country in the late 1800's, early 1900's opposing tobacco on a moral basis?
A Yes Often the moral and the health were interlinked however. The classic illustration was in the statement that God created
man in God's image, therefore the body is a temple not to be desecrated by harmful substances. And that was a dogma that was
shared both by health advocates and moral reformers where they came together.
Q Do you have any information that you have been able to ascertain from your research as to why these statutes were ultimately
repealed?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Yes, I do have information, and the information was that they were too hard to enforce.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q What's the basis of that information?
A The information is a definitive work written by an historian by the name of Sandra Tate, T-A-T-E, who wrote a book on this
movement and identified -- unfortunately, she made a mistake She indicated fifteen states that had passed prohibition laws. I
found one other state to add to it, Florida -- but the conclusion that she made was it was too difficult to enforce.
Q Florida had a strange thing They banned cigarettes, i.e., something rolled in paper, and didn't ban cigars. Is that correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That is correct, yes.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q For the statutes regarding these various states and what not, what library did you obtain these from?
A These I found in Sandra Tate's book, and then I verified them She did this as a doctoral dissertation many years ago, and
I used her research as a basis to verify them.
Q She didn't have the actual statutes attached to her work, did she?
A No She had all the statute citations.

112Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q Where did you go then to get the statutes?
A Some I found on my own. I found the Florida one, I believe, with Johnson, Tyler & Purvis' assistance, and they had some
already.
Q I want to see if I can get a handle on exactly what you've done specifically for this case, and I'm not considering at this point
work you may have done for other cases that you have been retained to have your services in.
Did you tell me that as far as the Bergen County Record that the search of that newspaper was done specifically for this case?
A Yes, that's correct.
Q When did you begin doing that?
A I asked that it be done I did a little of it earlier for the Miami case in Engel. When I did receive the depositions and accepted
doing this case, I asked that this be researched by Jeff Jeche and Shirley Allen and that this material be done, and, apparently,
they had done more when I was doing the Engel case than I had thought. So they had to do some more. Then I got those materials
and I reviewed them, and I selected these to be the ones I relied upon.
Q So these are all the ones that were provided to you by the Purvis firm?
A These are the ones that I asked to be researched by Jeff Jeche and Shirley Allen That is correct.
Q What I'm trying to determine is for the Bergen Record.
A For the Bergen Record. That's correct.
Q They collected various and sundry articles that appeared in that newspaper, correct?
A That's correct, that I asked to be researched for the period of 1960 to 1970.
Q And during that period, you wanted them to look at every single newspaper, right?
A I only looked at those that I looked at prior to the Engel case. Jeff Jeche and Shirley Allen had reviewed more of those when
I was doing Engel. They were not used in Engel so they were saved and they continued after this case.
Q For this case, did they go back to the Bergen Record and get the microfilm and start reviewing additional papers --.
A That's correct.
Q -- for this case?
A But they had not completed before That is correct.
Q So they looked at the microfilm of some additional newspapers and they made copies of whatever they felt was appropriate
that had to deal with tobacco and health.
A That's correct. Every article relating to a tobacco industry statement or a health statement or whatever.

113Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q So there's new copies now just for this case that got sent to the Purvis firm and were combined with what you had done
before and what Purvis' law firm had done before.
A Yes And then they were sent to me for this case.
Q And that they then sent you every single one of the Bergen County Record documents that they had found throughout, whether
it had been in Engel or that you had done or that Purvis had done or had been done for this case. They sent you all of them.
A That is correct.
Q Did you then make any selection from that group of the Bergen County Records or does that represent every one of them?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No. I used those that I relied upon. Some of them just mentioned tobacco and had nothing to do with smoking
and health.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So from that larger group that was put together by the Purvis firm, by yourself, and then by employees of the Purvis firm for
this case, from that large group of documents you selected out the ones that you felt were appropriate for this case.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Those that I relied upon That is correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Did you look at any other newspapers for this case in particular?
A That I hadn't looked at before?
Q Correct. Did you do any searches of newspapers, other than what was done for you in the Bergen County?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I reviewed what I had done in the New York Daily News, what I had done in the Newark Star Ledger, because
these were all contiguous to the places where the Ferlantis lived, and I had asked that those that I had reviewed in other cases
be forwarded to me so that I might review them again for reliance and reference to the Ferlanti case.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So those are other newspaper articles that you reviewed that had been researched in previous cases, is that correct?
A That is correct.
Q What I would like to find out is you told me about the Bergen Daily News here that was searched, at least, in part for this
case. Is there any other newspaper where somebody for this case put in the microfilm and started spinning it to find additional
articles from any other newspaper?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
114Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A No These were already done. I did these two papers. I did the Newark Star Ledger for a case in St Petersburg. I did the New
York Daily News for the Engel case.
Q Are you relying upon the New York Journal?
A No That's not part of mine.
Q So you're not going to be talking about this in this case.
A no And the Philadelphia Inquirer, that also is not mine.
Q So the Philadelphia paper is not going to be talked about in this case.
A How it got there, I don't know That's not mine.
MR. FEIWUS: I believe those are part of the exhibits, as I said earlier, that Mr. O'Shea requested that we make available to
him as part of the materials that were used in the Davis case.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q How about the New York Daily News? Did I already ask you about that?
A Yes, you did. We're going to use that The Newark Star Ledger, the Bergen County Record, and the Sun Sentinel The Sun
Sentinel had been, in part, reviewed for the Engel case, because we thought we would have a plaintiff from Broward County.
That did not materialize We pulled some of that, and then it was subsequently continued in terms of a review. I believe it had
already been finished a long time ago I asked for that because the Ferlantis lived in Broward.
Q Did you get all of the Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel that has ever been copied or did you select what you wanted?
A No, no. I asked for every one that had a reference to tobacco smoking, health, I got from the years 1977, I think, through
the early ‘90's The Ferlantis lived in Lauderdale -- not Lauderdale -- Pompano, beginning in January of 77, according to their
testimony and their answers to interrogatories All of those I did review and then I selected those for my reliance materials.
Q What information do you have that the Ferlantis read the Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: In the deposition of Linda, his daughter, she indicated that when he came to Florida he became an avid reader,
that he read the Sun Sentinel everyday That's in her deposition testimony.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And that was in ‘77?
A She said during the time that he came to Florida, he read it everyday.
Q Is that important for your opinion in this case?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
115Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A Well, it certainly strengthens the fact that Mr. Ferlanti was part of this information environment.
Q What about the Bergen County Record?
A There was no reference to his having read that He lived in Englewood Cliffs. This was the paper of that area. This was part
of the information environment.
Q But you have no information that he ever read that.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q As far as the New York Daily News?
A He lived in Brooklyn from the time of his early years. He had been born in Sicily. He came here as an infant He lived in
Brooklyn until he was married in 1950 when he was 28 years old.
I chose the New York Daily News, which I had already reviewed, because it was the largest selling newspaper at the time.
He also lived in Brooklyn again from 1958 to 1960. I used it for those years as well. I used them, because this was part of his
information environment. There was no indication that he subscribed to it.
Q And you have no information that you had available to you that he ever read that newspaper.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That is correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Is the same true for the Star Ledger?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That is correct as well.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q How much have you billed thus far in the Ferlanti case?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I've billed for approximately $2,500.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q What is your billing rate at this time?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
116Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A Seventy-five dollars for research per hour, and $125 for depositions and trials per hour.
Q During the year of 2004 how much were your billings related to tobacco litigation?
A Very little I think about $5,000.
Q And in 2003?
A I didn't break it down in 2003 or 2002 or 2001 or 2000. I have a figure that I had derived for ten years cumulatively, but I
have no way to break that down readily.
Q The figure that I have seen is by 2002 you had billed right at about $250,000.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That's correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And your wife had billed about $50,000.
A Yes And I can update that.
Q Well, my question, I guess, to you is, that was in 2002, and could you estimate for me the amount that you have billed from
the time that you arrived at that estimate until today?
A Let's just subtract. From the first time I was engaged to do consulting work for the tobacco companies through 2004, I have
received approximately $355,000, including expenses, in money for my services. For my wife from that time in 1995 through
2004, that includes ten years, it's approximately $67,500.
Q Did you have to break out the expenses for tax purposes and those things?
A I did, and those varied from year to year, but there are expenses in terms of travel, hotels, and things of that sort, which I
had to pay for.
Q Normally those are paid for by the Purvis law firm, aren't they?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, no They are paid for by the tobacco offices to which I do work For example, it would be, in this case,
Clarke, Silverglat, whatever.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Do you pay for it and then you get reimbursed? Is that how it works?
A Yes.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
117Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q So I'm assuming you had to make some determination of that for your tax purposes, because you don't want to pay taxes
on that money again.
A Yes, absolutely.
Q My question to you is can you give me a rough estimate, and I'm not trying to be dollars specific, how much of this 355,000,
I think you told me, over the ten year period, how much of that 355,000 was reimbursement of expenses?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I would say, and I'm a conservative, I would say 15,000 to 20,000 That's a guesstimate.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Do you intend doing any more research concerning the Ferlanti case?
A No, I do not.
Q Do you anticipate that you will meet with attorneys to discuss your potential testimony between now and the time of trial?
A I don't know with respect to meeting about testimony. I expect that I will have to spend time with Mr. Feiwus in terms of
deciding what documents to use as exhibits.
Q And traditionally at trial you have shown certain documents to the jury, but not all the ones that you have on your reliance
sheet, correct?
A Mercy, no.
Q And do you traditionally sit down with the attorney that you're working with in that case and come to a mutual understanding
as to which documents would be best to present to the jury?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I have a view of what should be presented and I have a time span It's usually that mine is cut considerably As
a professor, I see that the court moves in far less grandiose terms than a classroom.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q So you sit down with the attorney that you're involved with in that particular case and you-all come to some agreement as to
which documents should be presented on an overhead, or whatever, to the jury?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: These are my documents so I like to make the case for these documents Whether there is time for all of them,
is another matter, but the agreement is not made based upon the attorney's views so much as it's mine.
BY MR. VENABLE:

118Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q There was a period of time, I think, from 1995 to about ‘99 or so, you were working both as a professor, but had you already
started this consulting work with Mr. Purvis?
A Yes.
Q Were you a full-time professor at that time?
A Yes, and that's when I did the least work. To be very clear, during that time period that was the time when I really had
very little billing, because that was the time when I had no cases I did this work as I saw I had time to do it. The real part of
my billing period comes with the first case, which begins in 1999 with the Engel case, which, as you well know, was a very
complex, lengthy case.
Q When you were doing your consulting work in ‘99 for Engel you were working pretty much full-time at that point as a
professor’?
A No I had retired. Thank goodness.
Q Can you give me an idea of how many hours you were putting in in a day on this type of work as a consultant in 1999?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, I can't. I can tell you that the money that I had earned during this long period and the bulk of it, I would
say a good portion of it came during Engel Other than that, I can't give you a number, but I had retired in December of 1998. I
was sufficiently retired in May of 1999. So when I did Engel I was free and clear of the university.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q On average, what was your salary at the university?
A Well, I had a salary, and, indeed, I had income from my books which I wrote. I had my salary at the university, and it varied,
and my writings and newspapers. Sometimes my textbooks did very, very well depending upon the year. The salary at the
university ranged anywhere from $70,000 to $80,000. My business income from royalties varied from $50,000 to as much as
$200,000 in a particular year depending upon the adoption of my books, since I would base my returns on royalties.
Q Do you still receive royalties today in the event that those books are sold?
A Yes, I do.
Q So your consulting work doesn't in any way impair your ability to earn those royalties.
A No.
Q Can you tell me, sir, what your total charges are in the John Lukacs case, L-U-K-A-C-S?
A No, but it was modest. That was not a big case. That case was held after Engel in 2002 I don't think it was more than a few
thousand dollars to the best of my recollection.
Excuse me. That was done in 2000. The Lukacs case, I think, was in 2000. I'm not certain It may have been 2000, July of 2000.

119Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q You indicated at the beginning of this deposition that the first thing that kind of happened here is you requested to receive
the depositions, the interrogatories, and the complaint to review to determine whether or not you would be willing to offer your
services in this case. Is that correct?
A I wanted to know more about the individuals in terms of the life span, the materials. I wanted to get a feel for whether these
individuals were ordinary Americans.
Q Have you ever had those materials furnished to you in other cases, the same types of materials'?
A I asked for all these.
Q You asked for that in every case in which you're involved?
A Every one, absolutely.
Q And have you ever after reviewing those materials concluded that that was not an appropriate case for you to serve as an
expert?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Well, I've only had four cases, and I only had a limited amount. There have been other cases that I have done
depositions for and did not come to trial.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q I understand, but what I was asking is -- well, let me ask you this, setting Engel aside for one moment, how many other cases
have you served as an expert for a tobacco company?
A In trial?
Q No, sir. In any respect whatsoever.
A Setting aside Engel?
Q Yes, sir.
A Five. Three came to trial.
Q So your services were retained in Engel, and then you were retained in five other -.
A No, no Services in Engel. Three others that I testified in in trial, and two more that I was deposed in but never went to trial,
at least I wasn't involved in the trial. So we're talking six.
Q We got six plus Engel?
A No.
Q Six including Engel.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
120Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A Six including Engel.
Q I want to give you one more opportunity, because we're going to have some court consideration of a matter, I just want to
give you one more opportunity to do this, and I think I know the answer and I'm not trying to be argumentative either, it's
just to be clear. I've asked you to make certain assumptions concerning the definition of common knowledge. Do you recall
that line of questions?
A I do.
Q And I believe that you testified to me that you could not utilize the definition that I gave you and evaluate any opinions that
you may have utilizing that definition. Is that correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I told you that I was not able to accept the definition of common knowledge that ran counter to my definition
that I had employed as a professional historian for 35 years.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And you would not accept that definition.
A I would not.
Q You got the notice of taking the deposition and the duces tecum with it?
A I did.
Q Was there anything that you were unable to locate that is listed on that?
MR. FEIWUS: Why don't you just give him a copy of it.
THE WITNESS: I have a copy.
MR. FEIWUS: I know he has a copy, but just for convenience let him take a look at it.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Are these documents going to remain with this law firm to the conclusion of this case or are they going somewhere else
at this point?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I don't know.
MR. VENABLE: Len, can you tell me? Do you plan to keep them here or are you going to ship them off?
MR. FEIWUS: I assume that the exhibits will remain here. If they don't remain here, but they get moved to somewhere else,
like to a trial site, or whatever, I'm sure that --.

121Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
MR. VENABLE: I mean he's got copies of a lot of this stuff already. Will we be able to ask you if we need something and
you just give it to us?
MR. FEIWUS: I assume that we can make available to you whatever it is that you need.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Did you provide these materials? There's 21 of them on the duces tecum.
A No, because they're all publicly available You can get those. You can buy those You can get them on line.
Q I know we can buy them, doctor, and I know that you would like for us to buy them, but I don't want to buy them.
MR. FEIWUS: You can either buy them or we can buy them and charge you when we copy them.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Let's do this. Would you provide to -- well, how do I go about getting them?
A It's very simple.
MR. FEIWUS: Let's take a look at what we're talking about Item 21 is a “Copy of any published material authored at least in
part by you” -- and I assume the “you” means Dr DiBacco -- “that concerns cigarettes, tobacco, knowledge of the association
of tobacco, disease, dependence, addiction, including, but not limited to, newspaper articles, magazines, or periodical articles,
chapters, books and texts “.
Essentially what you're asking for are the things on his c.v. that aren't necessarily here already.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Right, and my problem is this, doctor, I don't want to go research the whole New York Times to find out where you've
written an article.
A Very simple. I can have you do this right on the net. It's very simple I mentioned my textbooks and you have my c.v. “A
History of the United States,” Thomas V DiBacco, et al. You can go on Google You can get it on Amazon. You can get a
cheap copy, a used copy.
A second book, “Made In The USA,” which has been recently republished, so it is in print, and, again, if you just put my name
under Google, you can find the two books that are relevant.
With regard to the articles, you can do that on Google as well if you put in the right words, “DiBacco, cigarettes, tobacco,” and
if you can't do it, if you have any trouble doing that, I would recommend that you use the New York Times It has a printed --.
Q Let me stop you there, because I appreciate the book thing and we're going to take you up on the book thing. We're not going
to take you up on the newspaper articles. We would like for you to produce to counsel any of those newspaper articles that
you published having to do with smoking and health. I don't want everyone you've ever done, but I want the ones that have
to do with smoking and health.
A I don't have them all. I don't keep these. I have a couple, I have a few, and the reason that's so is because I do not relish --

122Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q I may not be able to make you produce that which you do not have, doctor, but I'll try to figure out a way. So at least the
ones that you have, please provide a copy to counsel.
A The ones that I can provide, yes The books you can get.
Q We'll get the books.
A And they're also in the library, the public library.
Q We'll take care of getting the books.
MR. FEIWUS: Are you guys done?
MR. VENABLE: Yes.
CROSS EXAMINATION
BY MR. FEIWUS:
Q Dr DiBacco, it's late in the day and I'm not going to keep you here all that much longer I just want to ask you a couple of
questions just to clarify a few things.
Are you familiar with the term ordinary consumer?
A Yes.
Q What is an ordinary consumer?
A An ordinary consumer is a person who goes through life buying things, purchasing things, living like any other consumer
with regard to an American lifestyle.
Q You also referred to the term ordinary American I think you said it in connection with a few questions ago where you were
asked why you looked at the Ferlanti deposition materials, and I think the answer you gave was something along the lines of
“I wanted to determine if they were ordinary Americans”.
What is an ordinary American?
A They're the ordinary consumers. The term is interchangeable.
Q Would you have an opinion to bring to the jury in this case concerning the information available to the ordinary consumer,
or the ordinary American, concerning the health risks of smoking, rrespecte of anything that you knew or did not know about
the Ferlantis? And I admit that that question may be a little confusing. If you want me to rephrase it, just let me know.
MR. VENABLE: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I don't understand the question.
BY MR. FEIWUS.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
123Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q Let me rephrase it, because there's an objection to the form. I understand that you reviewed some materials in this case about
the Ferlantis.
A That's correct.
Q Assuming you knew nothing about the Ferlantis, were not furnished any information about the Ferlantis or you did not seek
any information about the Ferlantis, do you have an opinion about information available to the ordinary American concerning
the health risks of smoking in the time period 1900 to the present?
A Yes My opinion is, my professional opinion as an historian --.
Q Well, before you tell me what the opinion is, the answer is?
A Yes.
Q You do.
A I do.
Q And you can divorce the opinion that you have about what the ordinary American or the ordinary consumer in various different
times of the 20th century might have from anything that you you've done here in connection with the Ferlantis, is that correct?
A That's correct.
Q You were asked a lot of questions about what Mr. Ferlanti saw or knew or believed. In connection with making your opinion
about information that was available to the ordinary consumer, does it matter to you what Mr. Ferlanti saw, knew or believed?
A No.
Q And for the purposes of formulating your opinion about information that was available to the ordinary consumer, why is it at
all relevant to your opinion to even look at where the Ferlantis may have lived and look at their deposition testimony and look
at the interrogatory answers they had? Why is that at all relevant to what you did in this case?
A Well, it's relevant, because there are differences in plaintiffs, there are differences in ordinary Americans, and that should
be acknowledged The point of the researcher is not to establish a boilerplate that is applicable to everyone in all facets. Some
people are different and that should be recognized with respect to each individual plaintiff.
Q If Mr. Ferlanti were blind, for example, would that change the analysis that you might want to do in connection with the
research in this case in terms of assessing the information that might be available to an ordinary American like Mr. Ferlanti?
A It would require me to do additional research It might well do so That's why it would be geared for each individual American.
And if Mr. Ferlanti, like my father, never learned English, it would change my assessment.
Q You said if he was like your father and hadn't learned English, then perhaps that would have changed.
A It would have changed, because the environment is totally different.

124Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q But, as we said before, irrespective of any analysis that you would have done about the Ferlantis at all, you could still
formulate an opinion about the information that was available in the United States concerning the health risks of cigarette
smoking and tobacco.
A That is correct.
Q And you could do that with respect to different regions, like New York, New Jersey, and Florida, is that right?
MR. VENABLE: Object to the form of the question.
THE WITNESS: That is correct.
BY MR. FEIWUS:
Q You were asked some questions about common knowledge. Is common knowledge in your field a term of art?
A No. It's a term of definition Nothing exotic. It's a basic definition.
Q And according to your understanding of what common knowledge is, does common knowledge have to be true and accurate?
A Absolutely not.
Q Is it the opposite case, that it doesn't necessarily have to be true?
MR. VENABLE: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: That's true It doesn't have to be true. There's a lot of common knowledge that has no basis in fact. The
widespread view widespread knowledge out there that you shouldn't swim within a half hour of your having eaten something
on fear of getting cramps, there's no medical evidence to substantiate that.
BY MR. FEIWUS:
Q You were asked a lot of questions about the sources of the information of your reliance materials and the sources -- well,
let's just start with the preliminary question. The reliance materials that you brought today, do they reflect everything that you
possibly ever could know about the issues concerning smoking and health?
MR. VENABLE: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. FEIWUS:
Q What are they then if they are not everything?
A I visited numerous institutions with regard to laws, with regard to deriving information about educational matters, newspapers.
I started with the Library of Congress I went to the American University Library, the National Library of Medicine. I went to
Georgetown University Library, George Washington University Library, the University of Maryland Library.

125Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
I went to the Florida State University Library, the University of Florida Library. I've been to the Miami-Dade Library. I've
been to the Orlando Public Library. I've been to the Ocala Public Library. I recently went to the University of California Los
Angeles Library. I have spent a considerable amount of time over these ten years researching, because it's very meticulous to
research newspapers. Mr. Venable made reference to page by page. This is a very arduous situation and it takes a lot of time.
It's very time consuming.
So I have visited numerous repositories The Florida Atlantic University Library here in Boca Raton. The Palm Beach
Community College Library in West Palm Beach. The West Palm Beach City Library The West Palm Beach County Library.
The American Cancer Society Library in West Palm Beach. The American Lung Association in West Palm Beach. I've been
to the New York Public Library.
My research has taken me to boundaries well beyond Johnson, Tyler & Purvis that I have done on my own initiative, and the
reason for it is very simple, and that is because a researcher must work independently, and I do that. That's why I have gone
out on my own to do this research to gather information about the health risks of tobacco and cigarette smoking.
Q I think just to the up my question a little bit, the reliance list is somehow a subset of all the research that you have done
in connection with smoking and health, but with the information available concerning the issues of smoking and health it is
a subset of that.
A That's correct.
Q And it is the information that you feel is necessary in order to support the opinions that you have for this particular case.
A That is correct.
Q It doesn't reflect the world of your knowledge It reflects what you need to support the opinions that you have for this case.
A That is correct.
MR. REYES: Objection Asked and answered.
MR. FEIWUS: What's fair is fair I suppose.
BY MR. FEIWUS:
Q Now, you were asked questions by Mr. Venable about public service announcements. Why are public service announcements
relevant to your opinion concerning the information that was available on the issues of smoking and health?
A Well, they were, and I forgot to indicate this to Mr. Venable in the midst of his questions, these were mandated by the Federal
Communications Commission in the period after the Surgeon General's Report to balance the advertisements that cigarette
companies had on television during the period subsequent to that For every television ad there had to be space given and time
to the public service announcements It had to be documented. They had to air, because the FCC kept logs I used to work in
radio as a youngster and I used to fill out logs that the FCC required.
So they are important, because they are attempts, and they began in the post-1964 period, to ensure fairness of advertising, both
to the tobacco industry to sell products and the medical community's goal to enhance the knowledge of Americans about the
health risks of cigarette smoking.

126Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
The irony is that these continue well after the FCC's mandate, because in 1971 there would be no television advertising and they
continued well past that period and they were recognized in the press, in the printed media, and on the television as important
segments to provide to the American population about the health risks of smoking.
More importantly, they also provided telephone numbers, 800 numbers that people could call. I used to remember all these
numbers, there was one that started 1-800-CANCER, but then they sophisticated them specifically to cigarette smoking. These
were very important in terms of balancing what in the beginning would be an onrush on the part of the cigarette companies to
provide as many ads as they could knowing that Congress was about to cut them off on television, and they continued well after
that, and there is in the reliance material, if you read, there is information about the impact.
The article that I showed to Mr. Venable on Mr. Talman indicated that the “I Quit” program, which Tony Curtis participated
in, that Mr. Talman had a profound impact in terms of calling it to the American Cancer Society. The American Cancer Society
has a budget each year they get to use from individual Americans. They use that to try to promote as much education as possible
about the health risks of certain aspects of lifestyle and one of them is tobacco and cigarette smoking.
Q And you have on your reliance list and we have here a group of public service announcements. Do these reflect all the public
service announcements that there ever were?
A No. These were just a few, and nor do we intend to spend, as with the movies. The difficulty of all of this is, unlike newspapers
and magazines, when you can go at your leisure and you say, “Well, I found one on November 1967 today and I pick it up on
November 23rd tomorrow”. There is no systematic accumulation of these. There is no archives. The American Cancer Society
Library, in New York, they would not have these. They don't keep them You have to search for them. We do know that they
existed because they were referenced time and again in the ACS reports and they are important messages coming out from one
of the leading and the oldest health association in the United States. The American Cancer Society was founded in 1913 It's the
oldest public service privately funded medical and health society in the United States.
Q So the ones that you have on your reliance list are a sample of p.s.a. material that you have a reasonable degree of professional
certitude represent a larger set and are actually available within the American media?
MR. VENABLE: Objection to the form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. FEIWUS:
Q Is it important for your opinion in this case to be able to demonstrate that Mr. Ferlanti actually saw these public service
announcements, the ones that are on your reliance list?
A No.
Q Is it important for your opinion in this case to demonstrate that Mr. Ferlanti saw any specific item that is on your reliance list?
A No.
Q And why is that?
A Because it's part of an environment that the ordinary American was exposed to.

127Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q You were asked a question by Mr. Venable, it had kind of two parts to it, and I'm going to try and do it justice He said that
if there was an article in the newspaper that somebody, I assume, hypothetically, we can say Mr. Ferlanti, didn't read it and
nobody told him about the article, would it -- I think the question he asked you was was there any other way that that person
could learn about the article, and you -- well, what was your answer?
A My answer was from another source He could have seen it on television. He could have seen a visual representation of it. His
particular framing was he hadn't read it and nobody told him about it. It could have been done in another way and another form.
Q I'm going to try an offer a different way of looking at this, and you correct me if -- well, I'm struggling with how to ask this
question so perhaps you'll be more artful in your answer than my question will be.
Is it possible that a piece of information on your reliance list, like a newspaper article, informs sort of a general Zeitgeist or
kind of informs society's sense of common knowledge and in that way becomes available to other members in the community?
A Well, what you're saying is there are other meanings, and oftentimes the meanings might be through a coined phrase. It might
be through a physician's admonition. It might be through a friend disseminating it in a casual conversation It might well be
through other media, such as television or the radio or whatever it might be There is rarely anything, I have found, in looking
at American everyday life, that is cubicled, that essentially we live in a world in which the information environment is sort of
like a net, that is, if it doesn't get you here, it's likely to get you here.
Q So, for example, is it possible for the ordinary American or the ordinary consumer to learn about the information that is in
the 1964 Surgeon General's Report if they don't actually read the 1964 Surgeon General's Report?
MR. VENABLE: Object to the form of the question.
THE WITNESS: Absolutely.
BY MR. FEIWUS:
Q Is it possible for somebody to learn about the information, the ordinary consumer or the ordinary American to learn about
information in the 1964 Surgeon General's Report if nobody that they know read the 1964 Surgeon General's Report?
MR. VENABLE: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: It's possible and very likely, because there are so many other means that it's disseminated.
BY MR. FEIWUS:
Q During your examination by Mr. Venable, at some point we got to this Bergen County Record, August 12, 1969 article that
is titled “Why Actor's Widow Battles Cigarettes” It's 63419690812.
During the examination, I think there was something that you wanted to tell Mr. Venable about it. I actually don't remember
the context, but I want to give you the opportunity to look at the document and if there was information that you wanted to
provide Mr. Venable, please feel free.
MR. VENABLE: Object to the form, because it calls for a narrative.
THE WITNESS: What I wanted to do is read from the particular article, because it does contain information that I tried to
convey without the article at my side, and this is an article printed in the Bergen County Record of August 12, 1969. This is two

years after his death. The article is an Associated Press article, which means it had to pass muster of a major news organization,
and it reads, I'm quoting now, “Talman 60 Second Spot Still Appears Regularly”.
Quote, “The effect of Ronald Lee of the Los Angeles County Cancer Society branch is the most far reaching and talked about
public service announcement in our history,” end quote.
“It is impossible,” and I'm still quoting the article, “to say how many quit smoking as a result of Talman's message, but the
cancer society reports that one out of five persons writing in for ‘I Quit buttons credit spot T V announcements”.
BY MR. FEIWUS:
Q Does that refresh your recollection about additional corroborative materials that may be in your reliance materials concerning
the, (A), airing of the public service announcements that are on your reliance list, and, (B), the impact of those materials?
MR. VENABLE: Object to the form of the question.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. FEIWUS:
Q Do you believe that in your reliance materials you have additional corroborative materials for the public service
announcements that are on your reliance lists?
A Yes.
Q And when you said during your examination by Mr. Venable that quote, unquote, as you sit here this is what you know of,
what did you mean by that?
A It means here I am isolated from my boxes and with only my computer head available to me, but I do recall that there was
corroborative evidence, and during the break I was able to refresh in that very small period of time because I had to eat and
go to the bathroom, and found at least one of those.
Q The volume of your reliance materials is, at least by the standard of the type of documents that I can sort of manage myself,
is quite large Would you agree that your reliance materials here that there is a fair amount of volume to them?
MR. VENABLE: Objection leading.
MR. FEIWUS: I'll rephrase.
BY MR. FEIWUS:
Q You got a lot of reliance materials Why do you have so many reliance materials?
MR. VENABLE: Objection to the form of the question.
THE WITNESS: Because I've spent a lot of time researching this.
BY MR. FEIWUS:

129Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q Let me see if I can ask it differently Your opinion is that the information concerning health risks of smoking is widespread.
MR. VENABLE: Object to the form of the question It's leading.
THE WITNESS: That is correct.
BY MR. FEIWUS:
Q Is the volume of the information that you have collected important in order to support your opinion, and, if so, how?
A It is important. What it does is it shows in all areas of life, from the time you get up in the morning until the time you go
to bed at night, that there is in this culture, information culture, a likelihood that you're going to get snared today one way or
the other. I call it the “Get you syndrome”. It means there are certain areas of life in which the information environment is so
pervasive and so voluminous as to cover you in virtually every phase of your activity from the time you get up until the time
you go to bed that you are exposed to it.
Q So, for example, if you only had, let's say, 20 or 30 documents in your entire reliance list and you could only work with,
let's say, 20 or 30 documents, would that impair your ability to support your opinion concerning the widespread nature of
information during the 20th century on the issues of smoking and health?
MR. VENABLE: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, it would.
BY MR. FEIWUS:
Q So it's important to be able to demonstrate the breadth and volume in order to support your opinion.
MR. VENABLE: Object leading.
THE WITNESS: Yes, it is.
BY MR. FEIWUS:
Q Are you familiar with the term coffin nails?
A Yes.
Q Is slang important to your opinion?
A Very important. It is part of this culture that is communicated with brevity, and we live in a world in which the shorter it is
and the easier it is communicated, the better. Coffin nail is one of these. Cancer stick, which arose in the 1960's Combined with
old words and new words that still stick around, they're very important.
MR. VENABLE: Move to strike as nonresponsive.
BY MR. FEIWUS:
Q How people use language to refer to either cigarettes or smoking or tobacco is important in forming your opinion?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
130Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
MR. VENABLE: Objection leading.
THE WITNESS: It is.
BY MR. FEIWUS:
Q What then is the relevance of the movie clips that appear on your reliance list?
A Because many of these contain those coined phrases that are recognized very readily and succinctly in terms of the health
effects of smoking, and these terms are given greater publicity in an area of life, again, which many people participate in,
namely, movies and entertainment.
Q For purposes of your opinions, do the movies demonstrate in some way the use of language concerning smoking and health
issues?
A Excuse me. I didn't hear that.
Q Do these movie clips somehow represent use of common language and phrases concerning smoking and health issues'?
A Yes.
Q What do the movie clips tell you about the potential audiences for these films?
MR. VENABLE: Object to the form.
BY MR. FEIWUS:
Q Let me ask it this way. How do these movie clips inform your opinion?
A They verify. They are just one other peg in this whole sort of environment that illustrate that when you get up in the morning
and what you do throughout the day or the evening, that there are more references to, of course, this widespread exposure of
the health risks of smoking.
Q You said something on the examination by Mr. Venable, at least Mr. Venable said something about the intent of the movie
industry in putting these messages into the movies. Is that the purpose why you have these materials on your reliance list?
A No. In fact, if I stated that, it was misstated. This is part of the culture. The movies reflect the culture, and I don't think there's
an intention so much as there is just adherence to the environment of which they are a part.
Q Is the fact that the movie clips that you brought or the fact that they were popular movies or main-run movies with celebrities
in them, does that affect your opinion concerning the importance or value of the language?
A No, because there were so many individuals who were movie stars that to single out a few would be certainly difficult given
the fact that movie stars played such a large part in terms of life over the period of the 20th century.
Q Again, do you intend to show all of these movies or movie clips to the jury?
A Just a few.

131Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q Why are so many of them on your reliance list?
A Because it reflects the breadth and scope of my research. If I were to present one of them, I think I would have been remiss
and had been condemned as a scholar who did very little, and, therefore, I wanted to show as many as I possibly could that were
found during this period, some of which, of course, were very popular films. Some were not so popular.
Q Were there other avenues of popular culture which informed your opinion in this case?
A I think the avenues of education materials that were put out by public health organizations, by the government in terms of
government publications and government laws. For example, I've never talked about the warnings that were put on cigarettes,
which were part of the government laws.
Q You're talking about the Congressional mandated Surgeon General warnings.
A The Surgeon General ones, and the stiffening of the warnings back in 1985, and, of course, the prohibition of advertising,
the requirement that the warnings go on print ads of cigarette companies beginning in 1972. All of these are part of this culture
in terms of trying to inform the ordinary American of the health risks of smoking.
Q Is the news media important to assessing popular culture?
A It is.
Q Are TV programs important?
A They're very important.
Q Are the avenues of TV and movies and newspaper media reports important irrespective of whether or not you can determine
with specificity the exact precise times that those programs aired or the frequency and prevalence of them?
A They're still important.
MR. FEIWUS: I have no further questions.
REDIRECT EXAMINATION
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q On the p.s.a. comments that you made, you said that you got other corroborative evidence now for other p.s.a.'s that you
didn't have before?
A I said I found one of them, and I know that there are others, and I think if you examine those and go into them, you'll find them.
Q Well, they're your materials, so why don't you see if you can find them for us, because I thought we cleared this up, and now
it seems that you'll be able to shuffle through this, through the entire file and find other ones, so we need to find them now.
Do you want to take a break while you do that?
A I gave one example.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
132Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
Q As I understand your testimony, you said that there were additional ones now that you know are out there, but you just don't
know where they are, and we'll take the time and find them.
MR. FEIWUS I'll tell you what. You want to go off the record? Well, we can do this on the record or off the record. I will tell
you what I think may be a reasonable way to do this.
MR. VENABLE: There is no reasonable way other than locating them during the deposition.
MR. FEIWUS: Well, here's my point. He has many, many reliance materials that are movies, newspapers, television clips, and
p.s.a.'s They are not, obviously, all going to be moved into evidence. I understand from where you are going on this that you're
going to object based on some kind of either foundation or authenticity basis with him moving in things that there is not an
adequate basis for him to testify about either on foundation or whatnot.
So rather than him trying to go through these materials and find corroborative materials for all of them, why don't we address
this once we have narrowed the field into what we actually intend to show and move into evidence.
MR. VENABLE: If you want to remove items from your exhibit list, then he doesn't have to look, but if they're staying on
the exhibit list, then he needs to look.
MR. FEIWUS: Here's the point. We are not prepared today to identify what comes off the exhibit list and what comes on, but
before we go to trial, we well. If you still want him to try to find whatever he can find within some discreet period of time
before the deposition closes, I'm happy to have him do that exercise and he will either be able to do it for all the materials, some
of the materials, or none of the materials within the time allotted.
MR. VENABLE: Why don't we do this Why don't we come back tomorrow morning, or the afternoon, or the evening and --.
MR. FEIWUS: I don't know if he can do that.
THE WITNESS: I cannot do that, and I would be content, given this discussion, to limit whatever p.s.a.'s we have at this time,
but I do not have either the time or the physical strength to do this tomorrow.
MR. VENABLE: I understand and that's fine If you want to stipulate right now that the only p.s.a.'s that will be offered into
evidence, or you'll try to offer into evidence, but the only ones that you intend to offer into evidence are, as I understand it --.
MR. FEIWUS: Are you talking about the Bill Talman one?
THE WITNESS: The Bill Talman and the Yule Brenner.
MR. FEIWUS: I don't think that's all that we're going to be offering into evidence.
MR. VENABLE: Why don't we do this If the doctor can't come back tomorrow, then we will adjourn this deposition, we'll
come back at a time that is convenient to you, doctor, and we'll conclude the deposition at that time, which will give you plenty
of time to locate these items.
MR. FEIWUS: And we're just adjourning it on this issue?
MR. VENABLE: I have other questions as well.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
133Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
MR. REYES: I think if we take a five minute break, the doctor and Mr. Feiwus might talk and maybe they can come to some
agreement.
THE WITNESS: Let's take a five minute break.
(Thereupon, a brief recess was taken ).
MR. FEIWUS: Let's go back on.
We are not prepared to continue this deposition for another day. I think you've amply explored this topic, but if you want to
explore it some more with the witness, let's finish it out and do whatever it is that we have to do now. In some regard, I view
this as asking the witness to stand on one foot and tap his head and rub his belly, and if you want the witness to do that for all
the materials on his reliance list, so be it, but at some period of time the witness is going to have to leave today. So if you want
to break now and have this witness look through and see what the witness can find, we can take a break and have the witness
do that. If you want to just ask him more questions about it and be in the room with him while he does it, we can do that too,
but we're not going to continue this deposition because you've had an ample opportunity, I think, to ask all the questions.
MR. VENABLE: Well, Mr. Feiwus, this is my deposition so you won't tell me whether or not it's continued or not. We have
legitimate questions that we have posed to the witness After an extensive deposition, in a break, the witness has come back
into the room and you have asked him questions which suggest that his prior testimony was not accurate and that in fact he has
additional supporting documentation for the corroboration of the airing of numerous public service announcements and other
materials, but he, at the present time, can't tell us what those are, what exhibit numbers those are, where they are located within
these 17 or 18 boxes of exhibits, even though they are his documents prepared by him according to his own testimony.
We believe that he certainly should be in a position at a deposition at this point to identify the corroborating evidence that he
has to support the introduction of these materials. So we are in a position now of asking him to obtain those documents and
show them to us so that we can proceed with this deposition.
Now, we are not prepared to sit here much longer today as well, but we are not going to suspend this deposition without getting
that information. So we will continue the deposition concerning that matter to a later date.
MR. FEIWUS: And I'm just stating for the record that we object to that and we do not intend to produce him again.
MR. VENABLE: Then we will certainly seek to exclude him. That's your choice.
MR. FEIWUS: You can either ask him the questions now or -- and, also, I want to make a couple of additional points very clear
Number one, as I stated before the break, you are seeking corroborative materials and supporting materials for things that may
or may not be moved into evidence, and we understand our burden with respect to moving things into evidence. So I think that
to some extent you are putting the cart before the horse on certain evidentiary matters.
Number two. These materials have been available to you, or made available to you, and these exhibits have been available to
you prior to today, and if you wanted an opportunity to investigate these materials before the deposition and you wanted to go
through them and you wanted to do the work rather than have the witness do it, you could have done that too and you could
have asked us interrogatory questions about certain of these things.
So there are different ways of doing it, other than prolonging an expert witness deposition indefinitely, and I think that it's
improper to do that. I think he's given very elaborate answers about what the p.s.a. materials are and what the relevance is
and what the foundational requirements are, and he's answered some with respect to the Bill Talman one and the Tony Curtis
ones. He's given you very detailed information about why he believes they are relevant to his opinion and why he believes they
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
134Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
impacted public opinion, and if you want to go through every single document on his very voluminous exhibit list, and we
talked about why there is so much on his reliance list, if you want to go through every single one and talk about foundational
requirements, we will be here forever.
So it's up to you, but that is not, in my view, a proper basis to extend the expert deposition, and I do note that he is here, so
whatever time you have left, you can use it meaningfully to examine the witness.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q What corroborative evidence do you have to support your opinion, if you have it, that the p.s.a. “Surfer” aired on television?
MR. FEIWUS: Asked and answered.
MR. VENABLE: Well, counsel, he's just now come back on recross and said “I was wrong. I think there's more corroborative
evidence,” so I'm now asking him the questions.
MR. FEIWUS: The “Surfer” was one that you asked him very specifically about on the direct. I mean I will let him answer,
but there are many p.s.a.'s and there are many videos where you didn't ask him anything about it. If you want to ask him about
“Surfer,” go ahead.
BY MR. VENABLE: I want to find out if he has any information and if his opinion about “Surfer” has changed. I'm not asking
him an opinion. I'm asking about a fact. I would like to know what factual basis he has within any materials that he has researched
to demonstrate that the p.s.a. “Surfer” appeared on television.
THE WITNESS: What is the date?
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q 1968.
A From my knowledge of the FCC requirement with respect to equal time for p.s.a. announcements, I do not have corroborative
evidence right here at my desk, but I do believe that these p.s.a.'s were in fact aired based upon the FCC requirements.
Q But the FCC required that p.s.a.'s be aired, correct?
A That's correct.
Q They didn't require that the “Surfer” be aired, did they?
A It is a p.s.a.
Q It's a p.s.a., but there are many p.s.a.'s and they never required, the FCC, or any anyone else, that the Surfer p.s.a. be aired,
did they, sir?
A I don't know if they required that I do not know how you could corroborate specific ones The William Talman is a classic
example of these “I Quit” ads, and I have no way to answer any others except to the three that I've identified -- the William
Talman, the “I Quit” by Tony Curtis, and the Yule Brenner.
Q As we sit here today -.

135Carmela FERLANTI, as Personal Representative of the..., 2005 WL 6320166...
A As we sit here today, those are the three that are referenced time and again. There may be others, but I don't know specifically
where those materials might be, but they are available for your perusal and they have been for sometime.
Q So you didn't find it necessary to ever figure out whether these p.s.a.'s ever aired or not for your opinion, did you, sir?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I found it necessary to find these and bring them to the attention of my reliance list and to put them here.
What use will be made at trial of them, is another issue.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Well, sir, why did you think it would be important for your opinion and for you to rely upon something that never appeared
on television?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: There's a burden upon you as well to prove that it did not.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q No, there's not, sir.
A Well, if that is not the case, the historian, in my realm, basically presents evidence, and if it is not done, then the historian
brings out that it wasn't aired, but I do not have the evidence at my fingertips right now as to when it aired and if it aired.
Q And you don't have the evidence anywhere in this room that it aired or when it aired, do you, sir?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I don't know.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q You don't know. You didn't think it was important in formulating your opinions in this case to determine whether or not these
public service announcements ever aired on television, isn't that true, sir?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I didn't think that that question would be asked.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And you didn't think it was important for your opinion to find out whether or not these p.s.a.'s were in fact ever aired on
television, isn't that correct?

BY MR. VENABLE:
Q You were asked some questions about the ordinary American. Do you recall those questions?
A Yes.
Q And you said that's the same as the ordinary consumer?
A Yes.
Q Sir, what research have you done to determine what the ordinary consumer's expectation would be as to the danger of cigarette
smoking?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection Beyond the scope at this point.
THE WITNESS: I'm not an expert in that particular field I used the term in my definition as interchangeable Whether someone
in the field of consumer marketing would do so, that's another matter In my field, as I see it as an historian, I use the terms
interchangeably.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Sir, did you make any attempt to ascertain what the ordinary consumer would expect concerning the health hazards associated
with smoking cigarettes?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That's beyond the scope of my research.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And you formulated no opinions concerning what the ordinary consumer would expect regarding the health hazards of
cigarette smoking, is that correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I have no way of measuring that.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And you are not prepared to offer any opinions at trial in this matter concerning what the ordinary consumer would expect
concerning the health hazards of cigarette smoking at any point in time, is that correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection. I'm not sure I understand the question.
THE WITNESS: I don't understand that question.

Q Are you prepared to offer an opinion at trial in this case as to what an ordinary consumer would expect concerning the health
hazards of cigarette smoking at my particular point in time?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That has nothing to do with my research. I indicated to you time and again my research focused on what
information was widely disseminated to Americans regarding the health risks of smoking.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q And you were not concerned with what the ordinary consumer might know concerning the health hazards of cigarette
smoking?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection. Asked and answered.
THE WITNESS: That is correct.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Sir, your testimony concerning the p.s.a.'s, that is, that it was not important to your opinion to know whether or not they aired
on television, is that equally important to the other matters that are on the videotapes that are here?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That isn't what I testified to.
BY MR. VENABLE:
Q Well, let's go back and figure it out I thought that's what you told me.
A I indicated that I had corroborative evidence for three of those p.s.a.'s. I believe within those materials there is additional
material to corroborate some of those others.
Q We're right back where we started then.
A I don't know if those materials can be readily accessed, and I don't know whether or not those materials would satisfy your
conditions of airing. I think that there is one statement which I read that indicated that the effect of the p.s.a.'s with regard to
Americans who attempted to quit was contained in that Associated Press story, which I read to you, which was a statement
from the American Cancer Society. There are American Cancer Society statements, such as that, reported in the Bergen County
Record, and I don't know if there is anything at this point in time other than that corroboration.
MR. VENABLE: Well, I'll tell you what we're going to do. It's ten after five. We are going to, at this point, suspend this
deposition. We have not completed the deposition with regard to -- I'll tell you what, this is what we're going to do. We're going
to complete this deposition. We're going to conclude it now, and we are going to apply to the court to require the witness to
come back, be deposed again, and to provide the information that you claim that you have concerning the corroboration of the
airing of the p.s.a. announcements and the other materials that you brought here.
MR. FEIWUS: We object to that, but I can't tell you how to practice law.

MR. VENABLE: Exactly.
MR. FEIWUS: Before you conclude though, I do have, I think, two questions.
MR. VENABLE: You have no more questions, sir.
MR. FEIWUS: I have no more questions?
MR. VENABLE: You have no more questions.
MR. FEIWUS: Why do I have no more questions?
MR. VENABLE: Because there is no re-recross under Florida law.
MR. FEIWUS: Well, I'm going to ask those questions whether or not you choose to stay or not.
MR. VENABLE: Well, go ahead I now object that you're doing a re-recross of the witness, and if you do, I'm going to re-
redirect of the witness and we'll be here all night. Don't tell me there's no time, and then you're going to do a re-recross.
MR. FEIWUS: I didn't say that. I just have two more questions, and if you want to stay and ask him questions that's fine.
MR. VENABLE: I'll tell you, in that regard then we may be coming back here tomorrow. Our notice says from day to day
There's no way that I'm going to sit here and have you tell me it's too late now and you won't bring him back tomorrow and
you're going to do re-recross.
MR. FEIWUS: It's 5 13 p.m., and I'm now asking two more questions.
MR. VENABLE: Well, go ahead.
RECROSS EXAMINATION
BY MR. FEIWUS:
Q Dr DiBacco, do the p.s.a.'s on your reliance list have the indicia of being actual p.s.a.'s that were created by the American
Cancer Society?
A Yes.
Q Can you describe what that indicia is?
A The American Cancer Society seal of approval The American Cancer Society's logo is in the back Usually there's a statement
entitled “It's a Matter of Life and Breath,” which the ACS used in these.
MR. FEIWUS: That's it It's your turn.
MR. VENABLE: So we stand on our final statement, we'll ask the court to compel the witness' attendance again to resolve
any matters outstanding.

MR. FEIWUS: I would suggest that before you actually file a motion, you communicate with either Kelly or me to see if there
is some way, short of motion practice, to resolve this issue. I think it's a silly issue.
MR. VENABLE: What's silly about it?
MR. FEIWUS: As I told you before, these are reliance materials. They are not all going to be moved into evidence. I think
there is an ample basis here to demonstrate that they are reliance materials. You are talking about an evidentiary basis for their
authenticity concerning moving them into evidence, and they are not all going to be moved into evidence.
MR. VENABLE: They are on your exhibit list, are they not?
MR. FEIWUS: They are.
MR. VENABLE: And what you mean by reliance list is not known to the practice of law. All there is is an exhibit list They're
on your exhibit list. I must assume that you seek to introduce them into evidence.
MR. FEIWUS: Well, I will tell you there are about, I don't know, a thousand or fifteen-hundred documents on our exhibit list,
and we are not going to move all of them into evidence.
MR. VENABLE: You can certainly make those decisions.
MR. FEIWUS: And the materials that are in this room, which are 17 boxes of documents, are, as he testified, a subset of the
materials that is in his universe of knowledge that reflect things that then form his opinions concerning this case. They do not
all necessarily need to be moved into evidence in this case, and, therefore, they do not all require a foundational requirement
to be moved into evidence, but if you want the opportunity to go back, and, therefore, explore additional, as you've had that
opportunity today, you had the opportunity to review these materials in advance of the deposition, if you want to seek that relief
from the court, I think it is a silly request, but go ahead.
MR. VENABLE: The witness has indicated, as I understand it, that he cannot come back tomorrow.
THE WITNESS: That is correct.
MR. VENABLE: I have a notice of day to day. You did see that when you agreed to do this deposition at this time?
MR. FEIWUS: We proffered this day, not today and tomorrow.
MR. VENABLE: I'm trying to be kind to the witness, because I think I could try to force you to come back here tomorrow and
I'm not going to do that, doctor. That's my only point I'm going to go to the court. I'm going to ask the court to compel your
attendance again to resolve this matter that we've outstanding. If counsel wishes to withdraw things from the exhibit list, then
I am certain that we can reach an agreement, but absent it being removed from the exhibit list, I'm not growing to agree.
MR. FEIWUS: Well, I do think that before you make a motion, you should try to meet with Mr. Purvis.
MR. VENABLE: I will always do that.
MR. FEIWUS: That's fine But I also think that we are probably not going to take in certain documents, certain materials Here's
the point. I have to know with specificity what it is that you are going to seek from the court and I have to access it at that time.

MR. VENABLE: You asked me to contact you before I did, and I told you that I would You said, “Please contact me first”.
I said, “I will” That's all I can do. I understand your position.
MR. FEIWUS: It's 5 16. The witness is here The documents are here. If you want to continue asking him questions, you may
do that.
MR. VENABLE: I will continue tomorrow morning.
MR. FEIWUS: He cannot continue tomorrow morning.
MR. VENABLE: Then we will go to the court, or I'll call you before I go to the court Now, I'm not arguing with you. I'll call you.
MR. FEIWUS: You don't have to argue with me.
MR. VENABLE: Thank you very much for your time.
(Thereupon, the deposition was adjourned at 5:20 p.m.).
