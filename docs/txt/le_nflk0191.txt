1	JANETTE THOMAS GREENWOOD
2	after being first duly sworn, testified as follows:
3	EXAMINATION
4	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
5	Q. Good morning, Professor Greenwood.
6	A. Good morning.
7	Q. I understand that you've been retained as
8	an expert historian in this case by Philip Morris;
9	is that correct?
10	A. That's correct.
11	Q. And have you testified as an expert in any
12	previous case?
13	A. No, I have not.
14	Q. Have you been retained as an expert in any
15	previous retention?
16	A. Previous cases?
17	Q. Yes.
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. And how many previous cases have you been
20	retained as an expert historian?
21	A. I've been involved in five other cases.
22	Q. And were they all -- did they all relate
23	to the tobacco industry?
24	A. Yes.
8
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Q. And when was your first such retention?
2	A. I first worked as an expert witness in
3	2005. I started working on a particular case.
4	Q. And what was that case, if you recall?
5	A. The case is Aspinall.
6	Q. And by what company were you retained?
7	A. I was approached by the firm Johnson,
8	Tyler & Purvis.
9	Q. And do you know where that case was
10	venued?
11	A. In Massachusetts.
12	Q. And did you prepare an expert report?
13	A. I prepared a partial report. It's not a
14	complete report. Just recently something was filed
15	in March.
16	Q. I see. And you have not been retained in
17	that -- strike that.
18	You have not been -- you have not been
19	deposed in that case?
20	A. No, I have not.
21	Q. Okay. So that was your first retention,
22	and there were four subsequent retentions?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. And what was the second one?
9
CONFIDENTIAL
1	A. The second one I worked on was Haglund.
2	Q. Oh, with respect to Aspinall, what -- did
3	I ask what company you were retained by?
4	A. I began to work with Johnson, Tyler &
5	Purvis.
6	Q. That was the firm, but who was the client?
7	A. Philip Morris.
8	Q. Okay. And then you were retained
9	approximately when in the Haglund case?
10	A. That would have been I think 2007 to the
11	best of my memory.
12	Q. And the client was Philip Morris again?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. And the law firm?
15	A. Goodwin Procter.
16	Q. And do you know where that case was
17	venued?
18	A. Massachusetts.
19	Q. And did you prepare an expert report in
20	that case?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And were you -- you weren't deposed,
23	however?
24	A. No.
10
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Q. Why don't we go through all of the
2	retentions, and then I will circle back and ask you
3	what your expert report in those cases addressed.
4	So so far we've covered two out of five
5	retentions, Aspinall and Haglund.
6	What was the next retention?
7	A. The next one was the Donovan case.
8	Q.	And was Philip Morris the client?
9	A.	Yes.
10	Q.	And the law firm involved?
11	A.	Shook Hardy & Bacon.
12	Q.	And where was the Donovan case venued, if
13	you know?
14	A.	Massachusetts.
15	Q.	And when approximately were you retained
16	on the Donovan case?
17	A.	That would also have been 2007.
18	Q.	And you prepared an expert report?
19	A.	Yes.
20	Q.	And the next retention was what, involved
21	what case?
22	A. I guess the next one would have been a
23	multidistrict litigation, lights cases.
24	Q. And that is venued where?
11
CONFIDENTIAL
1	A. As I understand it, it's --1 think it's
2	actually venued in Maine but includes cases from all
3	over the country.
4	Q. Right, hence its designation as a
5	multidistrict litigation.
6	And that was for Philip Morris?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. And what law firm were you working with
9	there?
10	A. Arnold & Porter.
11	Q. And when were you retained in the MDL
12	case?
13	A. 2009.
14	Q. And you have prepared an expert report in
15	that case but have not been deposed; is that
16	correct?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. And what is the fifth of the five
19	retentions prior to this one where you've been hired
20	as an expert witness?
21	A. I think that's all of them up to this, up
22	to this case.
23	Q. Okay. So -- I'm sorry.
24	A. And I've done one in addition since. I'm
12
CONFIDENTIAL
1	working on one currently since.
2	Q. Okay. So in sequence, the next one was
3	you were retained in this case as an expert?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. And have we agreed to call this case the
6	Craft case even though Ms. Craft is no longer a
7	plaintiff?
8	MR. SNAPP: That's fine.
9	MR. SURPRENANT: I think I was told the
10	judge -- that's what the judge wants.
11	MR. SNAPP: Yes.
12	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
13	Q. And you have been working with what law
14	firm in this case?
15	A. I've been working with Winston & Strawn in
16	this case.
17	Q. And when approximately were you retained
18	for this case?
19	A. It was about a year ago.
20	Q. And subsequent to being retained on the
21	Craft case, you were retained on another matter?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. And what one is that?
24	A. Tremblay case.
13
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Q. And you were retained for that case when?
2	A. Probably within the last six months.
3	Q. Late '09 approximately?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. And what law firm are you working with in
6	that case?
7	A. Arnold & Porter.
8	Q. And where is that case venued?
9	A. New Hampshire.
10	Q. And once again, your client is
11	Philip Morris?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Okay. Professor, I'm sure you've gone
14	over with your -- with the lawyers the -- some rules
15	or some guidelines about depositions. It seems as
16	if we're having a structured business conversation,
17	but we're not really in some ways.
18	The court reporter is I'm sure very good.
19	Court reporters' professionalism is very high, but
20	it is hard for a court reporter to make an accurate
21	record if we talk as people frequently do in social
22	or business conversations in one respect: People
23	talk over each other all the time, and it's
24	important that you let me finish my questions even
14
CONFIDENTIAL
1	if you know where they're going, and I will try to
2	let you finish your answers even if I think I know
3	where they're going.
4	Other than that, there's only two aspects
5	of the examination that are important.
6	One is, can we have an agreement that if I
7	ask you a question that you don't understand, rather
8	than guess at my question you'll call out to me that
9	you don't understand it?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. You also have to answer audibly with a yes
12	or no.
13	And so if you answer one of my questions,
14	I and any subsequent readers or listeners to this
15	examination would be reasonable to think you at
16	least thought you understood it, correct?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Okay. And then the last thing is the oath
19	that you just took, even though we're in an informal
20	setting, a conference room with a beautiful view of
21	Boston Bay, is the same oath that you would take if
22	you were in St. Louis in the courtroom in front of
23	the judge and jury.
24	Do you understand that?
CONFIDENTIAL
1	A. Yes, I do.
2	Q. Let's go back just through the expert
3	reports.
4	You said you prepared a partial expert
5	report in the Aspinall case; is that correct?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. And what were the claims as you understood
8	them that were at issue in the Aspinall case? I
9	understand you're an expert historian and not a
10	lawyer, but what was your understanding of the
11	claims in that case?
12	A. Well, I can tell you what I was asked to
13	do~
14	Q. Sure.
15	A. --in the particular case.
16	Q. Sure.
17	A. Which was to get a sense of and provide a
18	sense of the information that was publicly available
19	to residents of Massachusetts regarding light
20	cigarettes and the messages that were sent through
21	these various sources in the public information
22	environment regarding light cigarettes.
23	Q. And is that the same topic that you
24	addressed in each of your subsequent expert reports?
CONFIDENTIAL
1	A. There were some slight differences in some
2	of these cases. They weren't all the same.
3	Q. Other than geography, were the -- was the
4	topic in each of them the public information
5	environment regarding light cigarettes?
6	A. That was part of every case, but there
7	were at least two of those cases where that was not
8	the only issue that I addressed.
9	Q. And what were those cases?
10	A. The Haglund case dealt with the issue of
11	information regarding the addictive nature of
12	cigarettes.
13	Q. And -
14	A. Also addressed the issue of lights.
15	Q. And what was the second retention where
16	there was a topic additional to the public
17	information environment regarding light cigarettes?
18	A. The Donovan case also dealt with the
19	issue, again the public awareness regarding the
20	addictive nature of cigarettes.
21	Q. All right. And you have prepared a report
22	in this case, correct, that is dated February 26,
23	2010?
24	A. Yes. I don't have the exact date in front
CONFIDENTIAL
1	of me, but that sounds, that sounds right, yes.
2	Q. Yeah. I have a copy, and I think there's
3	copies back there in the Federal Express box, and
4	I'll be showing them to you.
5	Was that report substantially based on the
6	prior work you had done in prior cases?
7	A. I don't know if I would say substantially
8	based. In the prior cases I certainly looked at the
9	national information that was out there, information
10	that was distributed, for example, through
11	television news and magazines and national
12	newspapers and national health organizations.
13	But for each -- for the case, the Craft
14	case, I looked very specifically also at Missouri
15	and information that was available to people in
16	Missouri through local health organizations, through
17	textbooks that were used in Missouri schools,
18	through newspapers that people would have read in
19	Missouri for example.
20	Q. Other than the additional research that
21	you did that was specific to Missouri, did you in
22	this case identify and rely on any additional
23	sources that had not -- you had not relied on
24	earlier in your earlier expert reports?
18
CONFIDENTIAL
1	MR. SNAPP: Objection to form.
2	THE WITNESS: Yeah, could you repeat the
3	question?
4	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
5	Q. Sure. You've just told me that in this
6	retention you did some additional work to identify
7	Missouri-specific information that was relevant to
8	your report, correct?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. Other than that Missouri-specific
11	information, is there any new information in your
12	report that hasn't appeared in your previous
13	reports?
14	A. Yes, there probably is, yes.
15	Q. Okay. Now, beginning with the Aspinall
16	case, how did you go about gathering the information
17	on which you rely as an expert historian?
18	A. I did quite a bit of research in
19	newspapers, microfilm collections through newspaper
20	sources that are available on line through things
21	like ProQuest and NewsBank. I did extensive
22	research in magazines, national magazines such as
23	Reader's Digest, Consumers Report -- Consumers
24	Reports, Life Magazine, Newsweek, Time, again a
19
CONFIDENTIAL
1	whole array of national magazines, as well as things
2	like even like Good Housekeeping and Vogue, again
3	to, you know, look as broadly as I could in sources
4	that were available.
5	I gathered information at community health
6	centers in Massachusetts, some of which was
7	Massachusetts-specific. Other information was --
8	were things like pamphlets and smoking cessation
9	materials, videos, movies, public service
10	announcements and things like that that were both
11	some Massachusetts-specific, some nationally
12	broadcast.
13	I, you know, did -- looked at, looked at
14	school textbooks used in health classes, curriculum,
15	antismoking, tobacco education materials, just about
16	any, any source that I felt was, you know, part of
17	this large information environment. I looked at
18	evening news broadcasts. I got transcripts of
19	public radio shows, again just about anything I
20	could get my hands on in terms of trying to get a
21	sense of what this larger information environment
22	was.
23	Q. Professor, the lawyers for the plaintiffs
24	in this case have an agreement with the lawyers for
20
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Philip Morris that experts will not be examined on
2	their communications with the lawyers, in your case
3	for Philip Morris, unless and to the extent that you
4	relied on those communications in reaching your
5	opinions as expressed in your reports.
6	So I'm going to be asking you some
7	questions about your interaction with the lawyers,
8	but let your lawyers have a moment if they object if
9	they think the question is going beyond the
10	agreement, which is not my intent.
11	But beginning with the Aspinall case, did
12	Philip Morris' lawyers provide you any information
13	that you subsequently ended up citing and relying on
14	in your expert report?
15	A. I had originally begun working with the
16	firm of Johnson Tyler Purvis in Washington, and I
17	asked them when I first began to work on Aspinall
18	what kind of information they had and what they had
19	gathered and collected, so I got some information
20	from them. I made sure to do my due diligence on
21	that information, double-checking it, comparing it,
22	you know, again with, you know, as I would do, you
23	know, any source, corroborating it to make sure it
24	was accurate, but I did get some information from
21
CONFIDENTIAL
1	that firm.
2	Q. And I know Mr. Purvis by name.
3	Could you tell me the complete name of
4	that firm, which I'm not -- I'm just not recalling?
5	A. Johnson, Tyler & Purvis.
6	Q. And how do you spell Tyler?
7	A. T-y-l-e-r.
8	Q. And who was the attorney at Johnson,
9	Tyler & Purvis who provided you the initial kind of
10	source of information in response to your request as
11	I understand it?
12	A. I worked most closely with Julia Tyler at
13	that firm.
14	Q. And what did Ms. Tyler provide you in the
15	way of information that you subsequently examined
16	and did due diligence on and then relied on in your
17	report?
18	A. I mostly got the newspaper information
19	from her from some years of the Boston Globe. I
20	subsequently did quite a few years myself in reading
21	microfilm, but I did get some newspaper, some
22	collections of newspapers from the firm.
23	Q. And what was the approximate date range
24	that those newspapers addressed?
22
CONFIDENTIAL
1	A. I would say roughly 1950 through the early
2	'90s.
3	Q. And I'm going to try to phrase this
4	question in a way that doesn't -- is not
5	inconsistent with the agreement, and I don't know if
6	I'll succeed, okay.
7	But you knew that Ms. Tyler represented
8	Philip Morris, who was a party to the litigation,
9	correct?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. Okay. Now, before you relied on some of
12	the information that Ms. Tyler provided you, as an
13	expert historian, did you believe it was important
14	to learn what selection criteria Ms. Tyler's firm
15	had used in selecting these newspapers before you
16	relied on it?
17	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: Could you repeat the
19	question again, please?
20	MR. SURPRENANT: I think it's clear, and I
21	will now give the videographer [sic] his first
22	chance to prove that my prior statements about court
23	reporters was correct.
24	Could you please read that back.
23
CONFIDENTIAL
1	(Question read.)
2	MR. SNAPP: Same objection.
3	THE WITNESS: I made a point of, of
4	course, asking how the newspapers had been
5	collected. I actually sat down and spoke with some
6	of the research assistants that they had at Johnson,
7	Tyler & Purvis about their collection process.
8	I went to the Library of Congress with
9	them a few times, a number of times actually, when I
10	was visiting in Washington, sat with them, watched
11	how they did the research, double-checked quite a
12	bit of the research that they did themselves right
13	there in Washington with them, and I was satisfied
14	again given my interaction with the research
15	assistants and my own subsequent checking of the
16	research that I felt that the research that they had
17	done was done right.
18	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
19	Q. Okay. And since you were provided the
20	initial collection of newspapers from 1950 through
21	the 1990s -- strike that.
22	Was all the newspapers -- were all the
23	newspapers that Ms. Tyler provided you the Boston
24	Globe? Were they from the Boston Globe, or were
24
CONFIDENTIAL
1	they more than just that newspaper?
2	A. The ones that I asked for and from
3	Johnson, Tyler & Purvis were as I recall the
4	Boston Globe, yes.
5	Q. Since that initial collection of
6	newspapers that Ms. Tyler provided you, have
7	attorneys for Philip Morris provided you additional
8	sources that you subsequently ended up relying on
9	and citing in your expert reports?
10	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: I asked if - for any
12	collections that they had done on national
13	magazines, and again, I followed through with the
14	same process of going over what they had,
15	understanding their collection process,
16	double-checking, going through, you know, Readers'
17	Guide to Periodicals, doing my own research and
18	making sure that it had been done fully and
19	completely and feeling -- you know, being confident
20	that I had done, you know, my own research.
21	And again, I just want to stress that that
22	was just part of the research that I did, that I did
23	a lot more in addition to some of the, you know,
24	working with some of the collections that I asked
25
CONFIDENTIAL
1	for from Johnson, Tyler & Purvis.
2	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
3	Q. So subsequent to getting the newspapers
4	from Johnson, Tyler & Purvis, you asked for if they
5	had any collections from national magazines in a
6	context where you ultimately after doing the due
7	diligence you referred to you relied on what they
8	provided you and cited it in your expert reports?
9	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
10	THE WITNESS: Again, I relied on some of
11	the information that I asked for, some of the
12	collections, but it was just part of my reliance
13	list.
14	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
15	Q. Now, again, I don't want to --1 don't
16	want to violate the letter or the spirit of the
17	agreement, but I think I've established that after
18	you did the due diligence and understanding that was
19	just part of the information base you relied on, I
20	understand both of those points, but what was it you
21	asked for? What did you ask to be provided?
22	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: I asked if they had done any
24	collections of national magazines.
26
CONFIDENTIAL
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
2	Q. With respect to what topic?
3	A. At that point I think I was --1 was
4	doing, you know, short of general research on
5	tobacco and, you know, the issue of cigarettes and
6	health.
7	Q. Now, again, I'll abide by whatever
8	objection you make, but I think there's a fair
9	question, which is, I don't want to know the
10	substance of any communication you've had with
11	Ms. Tyler or any other lawyers for Philip Morris,
12	but do you know how you first came to be retained as
13	an expert historian by Philip Morris?
14	A. I know how I came to be retained by
15	Johnson, Tyler & Purvis, and I was actually
16	contacted through a colleague of mine in the history
17	department at Clark University by the name of
18	Doug Little, who had been himself contacted by
19	Michael Schaller, who is a historian at the
20	University of Arizona, and he contacted my
21	colleague, Professor Little, and asked if
22	Professor Little knew of anybody in his department
23	who was -- who had experience working especially in
24	newspaper collections and periodicals and things
27
CONFIDENTIAL
1	like that who might be interested in doing some
2	research.
3	MR. SURPRENANT: Mr. Reporter, could you
4	please read back the last half of that answer, last
5	sentence.
6	(Record read.)
7	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
8	Q. Okay, great. Now, were you interested
9	only in information that culled out health risks
10	associated with light cigarettes? Is that a filter
11	that you in your own mind you wanted to have
12	employed?
13	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
14	THE WITNESS: I was interested in first of
15	all learning generally about the issue of tobacco
16	and cigarettes and cigarette history, the issue --
17	the history of smoking and health issues, so that's
18	certainly where I started.
19	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
20	Q. And I take it in your continuing
21	retentions you have continued to be interested about
22	the history of tobacco and cigarettes and health and
23	public knowledge about those issues; is that
24	correct?
CONFIDENTIAL
1	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: I've been asked
3	particularly, you know, in all of these cases to
4	research again the information that was readily
5	available to the public, what the information
6	environment was and to draw conclusions about what
7	kind of information was available to the public, and
8	again in each particular case, each particular
9	state, so that's my charge in these cases as an
10	expert witness.
11	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
12	Q. Okay. Now, as I understand it, you were
13	an expert historian, more specifically an expert
14	historian who practices -- a social historian?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. You're not an expert I take it in consumer
17	behavior?
18	A. No, I'm not.
19	Q. You're not an expert in advertising?
20	A. No.
21	Q. You're not an expert in public relations?
22	A. No.
23	Q. You're not an expert in polling?
24	A. No, I'm not.
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Q. You're not an expert in surveys?
2	A. No.
3	Q. You're not an expert in marketing?
4	A. No.
5	Q. And you have reached no expert conclusions
6	as a historian about what Philip Morris knew about
7	the relative delivery and health risk of lower --
8	lowered-tar and nicotine cigarettes versus regular
9	cigarettes, correct?
10	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: No, because, again, I've
12	been charged with a very specific task as a social
13	historian, which is to find out what information,
14	what was public -- you know, what information was
15	available to the public regarding light cigarettes
16	and, secondly, what public awareness was regarding
17	light cigarettes, again based on this environment of
18	information that was readily available to everyone.
19	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
20	Q. Right. And you've reached no expert
21	conclusions on what Philip Morris understood about
22	consumer perceptions either of the brand
23	Marlboro Lights or of the phrase "lowered tar and
24	nicotine," correct?
CONFIDENTIAL
1	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: That's correct, because,
3	again, my charge is to find out, you know, what
4	public awareness was about these issues, which of
5	course is based on the information that is readily
6	available to the public.
7	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
8	Q. Now, have you ever published, Professor,
9	on health issues?
10	A. No, I haven't.
11	Q. Have you ever published on tobacco?
12	A. No.
13	Q. Have you ever published on the growth of
14	cigarette consumption in the last century?
15	A. No.
16	Q. Have you ever published on consumer
17	perception?
18	A. No.
19	Q. Have you ever published on consumer
20	perception -- well, strike that. I was about ready
21	to ask a redundant question.
22	In any of your published works, have you
23	ever used public awareness as a concept in the
24	fashion that you have used it in your expert report
CONFIDENTIAL
1	in this case?
2	A. Yes, I would say that I have in the sense
3	of, you know, I've written about race relations, you
4	know, public awareness regarding issues such as
5	newly freed African-Americans, so I've certainly
6	incorporated that concept into my own work.
7	Q. Have you ever defined public awareness in
8	a scholarly article in a peer-reviewed publication
9	in the fashion that you have defined public
10	awareness in your report in this case?
11	A. I would say I haven't overtly defined it
12	as such, but I think the term is deeply embedded in
13	social history and the way historians approach sort
14	of the environment of information and perceptions,
15	so it's certainly something that I incorporate in my
16	work.
17	Q. Now, I think either -- though it wasn't
18	responsive to my question necessarily, I think you
19	have either implicitly or explicitly answered the
20	next question, but let me ask it.
21	Why didn't you study public --
22	Philip Morris internal documents on the work
23	Philip Morris had done on consumer perceptions
24	relating to the brand Marlboro Lights and the phrase
32
CONFIDENTIAL
1	"lowered tar and nicotine"?
2	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
3	THE WITNESS: Again, go back to my
4	definitions of public awareness. The public
5	awareness is based on information that is broadly,
6	deeply disseminated over a period of time, messages
7	that are echoed and reiterated to the public.
8	So by definition, internal documents are
9	not public unless, you know, one of them is leaked,
10	you know, to the public and it happens to be
11	published in a newspaper or a magazine or is
12	mentioned in a TV news report. Then I would
13	certainly, you know, include that as part of this
14	larger information environment.
15	But I did not look at internal documents
16	of Philip Morris, just as I did not look at internal
17	documents of the American Cancer Society or state
18	departments of public health because, again, these
19	are by definition internal documents, and I am most
20	interested again -- as a social historian, to
21	ascertain public awareness, I look at the
22	information that is available to the public in a
23	public -- in various public venues and forms.
33
CONFIDENTIAL
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
2	Q. Now, you cited in your report that you had
3	done research including in looking at archives; is
4	that correct?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. Am I correct that archives are an
7	important, if not very important, if not critical,
8	resource for professional historians?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. Now, are you aware of any
11	publicly-available archives where there is
12	publicly-available information about what
13	Philip Morris had concluded based on its study of
14	consumers about what consumers thought about the
15	phrase -- the brand Marlboro Lights and what
16	consumers thought about the phrase "lowered tar and
17	nicotine"?
18	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: Yeah, I'm sorry, I think
20	you -- would you mind repeating that question?
21	MR. SURPRENANT: Yes. It was long, but I
22	think it was precise, and I'd ask the court reporter
23	to reread it.
24	(Question read.)
34
CONFIDENTIAL
1	MR. SNAPP: Same objection, it's compound,
2	vague.
3	You can answer.
4	THE WITNESS: Again, I go back to my
5	definition of public awareness and trying to
6	determine what public awareness is, which is looking
7	at the information that is readily available, maybe
8	that's the key point here, is readily available to
9	the public, and again, you know, sort of go through
10	my list, it's things like newspapers, magazines,
11	television news, radio reports, public service
12	announcements, information that is, you know,
13	disseminated through public health organizations,
14	health textbooks, smoking education curricula.
15	Readily available information is the basis of
16	public -- my conclusions regarding public awareness.
17	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
18	Q. I had understood that from your previous
19	answers, Professor. My question was really pretty
20	specific, and it wasn't about why you didn't look at
21	such information.
22	My question simply was, are you aware that
23	there are archives where you could go to and you
24	could find internal public -- internal Philip Morris
35
CONFIDENTIAL
1	documents that would communicate what Philip Morris
2	understood about consumers' perception of
3	Marlboro Lights and the phrase "lowered tar and
4	nicotine" ?
5	MR. SNAPP: Is there a question?
6	MR. SURPRENANT: Yes.
7	MR. SNAPP: I thought you were describing
8	your previous question.
9	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
10	Q. Are you aware there are such archives
11	available?
12	A. Yes, I am aware of that, but again, given
13	my specific charge in this case, that kind of
14	information, you know, as internal information and
15	information again that's not readily available to
16	the public does not figure into my assessment of
17	public awareness.
18	Q. What archives are you aware of where
19	internal Philip Morris documents are available?
20	A. I know that there are some websites. I am
21	not sure I can give you any specific names. I know
22	there are some websites out there that have some
23	internal documents.
24	Q. Now, I asked you earlier in another case
36
CONFIDENTIAL
1	if you understood what the nature of the claim was,
2	not as a lawyer but as an expert historian, and so
3	let me ask you that question about this case.
4	Do you have an understanding what the
5	nature, the basic, the general nature of the
6	plaintiffs' claims are in this case?
7	A. I think generally I do.
8	Q. And what is your general understanding,
9	Professor?
10	A. My understanding is that this class of
11	consumers from the state of Missouri is charging
12	Philip Morris with fraud regarding what they say are
13	claims regarding light cigarettes.
14	Q. Generally that Philip Morris marketed
15	Marlboro Lights in a misleading fashion, correct?
16	A. Again, I -- my role and charge is quite
17	specific here. So to the best of my knowledge,
18	that's the case, yes.
19	Q. Okay. Let me kind of turn to your charge
20	and ask some questions about the historical method.
21	Is framing the question to be answered as
22	part of a historical method -- strike that.
23	Is framing the question to be answered a
24	part of the historical method as you practice it?
37
CONFIDENTIAL
1	A. I'm not sure I understand. Like which
2	question. A question in general? Or any historical
3	inquiry is driven by a question, a research
4	question. I'm not sure what you're asking
5	specifically here.
6	Q. Great.
7	A. It's such a general question.
8	Q. Great. I'm glad, as we agreed at the
9	beginning, if you don't understand, you'll call that
10	out to me, and then my job will be to make it
11	clearer.
12	In your report at the very beginning, you
13	say -- you reference the scientific method and that
14	you say the historical method is one example of the
15	scientific method, correct?
16	A. It's modeled on the scientific method,
17	yes.
18	Q. And what is the scientific method?
19	A. The scientific method is basically driven
20	by, you know, again a particular research question,
21	which sometimes gets referred to as a hypothesis.
22	The hypothesis then gets tested, you know.
23	Scientists might test it in a laboratory or through
24	other means. And then that hypothesis based on
38
CONFIDENTIAL
1	evidence gets refined until the point where the
2	scientist draws conclusions again based on the
3	evidence.
4	Q. My older sister just retired as a
5	neurophysiologist, but I realized I never asked her
6	the question of, Ann Marie, tell me what the
7	scientific method is. I should have.
8	So I take it framing a research question
9	is the first step in the historical method as you
10	practice it as a social historian, correct?
11	A. Yes, and as I teach it.
12	Q. And is it important to the reliability of
13	any historic conclusions that are subsequently
14	reached that the question which is asked be properly
15	framed?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. And you work with graduate students?
18	A. Yes, I do.
19	Q. And you work with Ph.D. candidates?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. And both in that work and working with
22	undergraduate students, have you lectured on the
23	importance of framing the historical inquiry in a
24	proper fashion?
39
CONFIDENTIAL
1	A. Yes, I certainly have. I'm not sure I
2	lectured. Usually these are more like seminars
3	where it's less formal, but I certainly teach that,
4	yes.
5	MR. SURPRENANT: Bless you.
6	MS. BERNSTEIN-GAETA: Thank you.
7	MR. SURPRENANT: Do you know why you say
8	bless you?
9	MS. BERNSTEIN-GAETA: No.
10	MR. SURPRENANT: Because in medieval times
11	they thought that Satan could grab your soul when
12	you were sneezing.
13	MS. BERNSTEIN-GAETA: Well, thank you
14	then.
15	MR. SURPRENANT: It's true.
16	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
17	Q. And describe for me generally how a
18	historian goes about -- what is the historian trying
19	to achieve when he or she frames a research
20	question?
21	A. The research question really guides your
22	research. A research -- so that's the main thing.
23	It's the question that, you know, will -- is framed
24	in such a way so that, you know, you subsequently go
40
CONFIDENTIAL
1	out and seek an answer to the question that's
2	raised.
3	Q. Let me give you a hypothetical research
4	question that you would get from a hypothetical
5	Ph.D. candidate, and I would ask you if in the
6	following research question the hypothetical Ph.D.
7	candidate has properly or improperly framed his
8	research question.
9	What the Ph.D. candidate was interested is
10	knowing whether acts of antisemitism in Poland --
11	strike that -- was interested in whether acts of
12	antisemitism were essentially eliminated under the
13	Nazis in Poland between 1939 and 1945, and what he
14	intended to do is identify incidents of antisemitic
15	behavior in Poland in 1939, compare it to incidents
16	of antisemitic behavior in Poland in 1945, and would
17	conclude because there were virtually no antisemitic
18	incidents in Poland in 1945 that the Nazis had been
19	very benevolent in eradicating antisemitism in
20	Poland.
21	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form. Is there
22	a question?
23	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
CONFIDENTIAL
1	A. Yeah, would you ask me to -- may I ask you
2	with all due respect to repeat what the graduate
3	student's question was?
4	Q. Sure, right. The question was, did
5	antisemitism -- was it eradicated by the Nazis in
6	Poland between 1939 and 1945? That's the question.
7	And the analysis is going to compare antisemitic
8	acts in Poland in 1939 versus antisemitic acts in
9	Poland in 1945.
10	MR. SNAPP: Again, is there a question
11	pending? I'm not sure what the question is.
12	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
13	Q. Did -- in that hypothetical, has the Ph.D.
14	candidate properly framed the inquiry in your view?
15	MR. SNAPP: Objection to form.
16	THE WITNESS: Again, I think you've given
17	me two pieces. You've given me a question and then
18	you've given me his method. So are you asking me
19	about the first part of the question, has he framed
20	a reasonable research question?
21	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
22	Q. Let's start there. Has he framed a
23	question?
24	A. I think that's a reasonable historical
CONFIDENTIAL
1	question.
2	Q. Is there an error with his method?
3	A. Well, I would say as his professor that
4	there's going to be -- he or she shouldn't, you
5	know, look at '39 and '45 as two -- you know, like
6	as we say in history, dig your post holes down there
7	and then draw your conclusions, that history is
8	about change over time, and that student would need
9	to look at more than just 1939 and 1945 because it's
10	fair you could have a big spike in 1943 that would
11	not be evident if the student only looked at '39 and
12	'45, and therefore, you know, seeing that nothing
13	was happening in '39, as I'm understanding your
14	second part of your question, and nothing much
15	happening in '45, that the student would then
16	conclude that not much happened, that's not -- it
17	not a good method because he obviously could miss a
18	whole lot in between those two so years.
19	Q. Yeah. He would miss the genocide, right?
20	MR. SNAPP: Object to form.
21	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
22	Q. He would have missed what was really
23	important, correct?
24	A. Well, that and a whole lot of other things
CONFIDENTIAL
1	that could be happening out there too.
2	Q. Okay. Is it possible to frame a research
3	question in such a way that it is overly narrow?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. And can you think of any examples where a
6	student had framed a research question in a way that
7	you found it overly narrow?
8	A. Sure. An undergraduate who, you know,
9	wanted to look at the story of courtship, you know,
10	during the -- you know, one year of the Civil War,
11	and I said, well, that's not broad enough. It's not
12	a well-fashioned research question. Again, it
13	doesn't deal with, for example, change over time, so
14	that's a very narrow question.
15	Q. That's an interesting one though. I mean,
16	one could imagine looking at courtship patterns in
17	the United States in World War II and find as with
18	my parents is marriage and parenthood was pushed
19	back six, seven, eight years. That's an interesting
20	topic.
21	A. Right, if you look at it broadly enough,
22	but you can't look at one year and come up with --
23	Q. But one could imagine looking at courtship
24	during Sherman's March in North Carolina and
CONFIDENTIAL
1	South Carolina, you would imagine it was pretty
2	impacted, but...
3	MR. SNAPP: Object as beyond the scope of
4	her expert report.
5	MR. SURPRENANT: Sherman's March is very
6	interesting.
7	THE WITNESS: Should we -- could we take a
8	break?
9	MR. SURPRENANT: Yeah. You know what? We
10	can take a break, and I forgot the most important
11	rule in depositions is we can take a break whenever
12	the witness wants.
13	THE WITNESS: Okay. I'd like to if that's
14	okay.
15	MR. SURPRENANT: Absolutely.
16	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 2 minutes
17	after 10:00. We're off the record.
18	(Whereupon, a short recess was
19	taken.)
20	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Okay. We're back on
21	the record. This is Tape Number 2. The time is
22	10:16.
23	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
24	Q. And as I mentioned before the break,
45
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Professor, I did neglect the most important rule,
2	which is whenever you want a break, just let me
3	know.
4	A. Okay.
5	Q. Now, going back to the historical method
6	in framing research questions, I take it in order to
7	reach reliable historical conclusions, the historian
8	has to start with a properly framed research
9	question, correct?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. And is framing the historical -- strike
12	that.
13	Is framing the research question, is that
14	part of what the -- of what it means to be -- to
15	practice social history?
16	A. Yes, that's the first step, yes.
17	Q. And it's part of your expertise as a
18	social historian?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. But am I correct in reading your expert
21	report that here the lawyers for Philip Morris
22	framed your research questions?
23	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
24	THE WITNESS: I'm not sure I would say
46
CONFIDENTIAL
1	they framed my research questions. They asked me
2	to, you know, determine what public awareness was
3	regarding light cigarettes for people in the state
4	of Missouri. That was my charge, you know. It was
5	up to me to certainly, you know, carry that forth
6	and do the research on that.
7	I thought, you know, to me it's a
8	reasonable question.
9	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
10	Q. And, you know, we don't have to mark it,
11	Erik, unless you think it's important, but I'd
12	rather not mark it, it's just clutter but I'll mark
13	it if you want, and that's the Expert Report of
14	Janette Thomas Greenwood with Exhibits A and B.
15	MR. SNAPP: It's your deposition. If you
16	don't want to mark it, that's fine. If you're going
17	to be referring to it, it's up to you.
18	MR. SURPRENANT: Yeah, it just will end up
19	costing all of us a lot of money that we ultimately
20	don't need, but I am compliant, and this isn't all
21	things.
22	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
23	Q. I see you have a Master's Degree in
24	history from the University of Wisconsin in 1978?
47
CONFIDENTIAL
1	A. That's right.
2	Q. I have a Master's Degree in literature
3	from the University of Wisconsin in 1980.
4	A. Fellow lucky Badgers.
5	Q. I will forbear asking questions about the
6	Halloween parade down State Street.
7	A. Good. Those are not things I would like
8	on the record.
9	Q. Okay. And let me direct --1 have handed
10	you without marking the Expert Report of
11	Janette Thomas Greenwood. It is dated at the back
12	on February 26 at Page 66. The copy I gave you has
13	Exhibit A, which is your resume, and Exhibit B,
14	which is a reliance list of Janette Greenwood.
15	MR. SNAPP: Do you have another copy for
16	us that we can look at, please? Thank you.
17	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
18	Q. And directing your attention to Page 3 of
19	your report, after D, the questions, "As a
20	professional historian expert witness in this case,
21	I have been asked to focus my research on the
22	following questions."
23	You wrote that, correct?
24	A. Yes.
48
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Q. And who asked you to focus your research
2	on those questions?
3	A. The attorneys that I worked with on this
4	case charged me with exploring these and concluding
5	regarding -- exploring these questions and drawing
6	conclusions based on my research.
7	Q. And what specific lawyers?
8	A. Well, I worked again on this case with
9	Ms. Gaeta-Bernstein -- Bernstein-Gaeta, I'm sorry,
10	Judy, and I worked with Jackie Segel from
11	Goodwin Procter.
12	Q. Okay. So in this case, the initial step
13	of the expert analysis was performed in sum or
14	substance by lawyers for Philip Morris, correct?
15	MR. SNAPP: Objection to form.
16	THE WITNESS: I was asked to explore these
17	questions, and to me, these are reasonably framed
18	research questions.
19	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
20	Q. I understand, Professor, that it is your
21	expert conclusion that these are reasonably formed
22	research questions.
23	But I am correct in this case it was not
24	you the historian but the Philip Morris lawyers who
49
CONFIDENTIAL
1	identified the research questions, correct?
2	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form, asked and
3	answered.
4	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
5	Q. Oh, another thing, another thing. If you
6	look, glance around the room, Professor, you will
7	not see an individual with a black robe on. You
8	will not see a judicial officer.
9	And so when your -- when the attorney for
10	Philip Morris makes an objection, there's no one to
11	determine whether the objection is sustainable or
12	should be overruled. The lawyer, Erik, is doing
13	that for the record to retain it in case it ever
14	becomes important.
15	So unless you're instructed not to answer
16	a question, the objection is just for the record,
17	and you should ask [sic] it anyway.
18	And with that, Mr. Reporter, could you
19	reread the question.
20	(Question read.)
21	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form, asked and
22	answered.
23	You can answer.
24	THE WITNESS: I was asked to research
50
CONFIDENTIAL
1	these specific questions by the attorneys who had
2	asked me to be the expert witness regarding public
3	awareness.
4	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
5	Q. Okay. Now, I want to --1 want to explore
6	the concept of public awareness, and let me go to
7	something that as a Shakespearian scholar, at least
8	an amateur, I know a little about.
9	You say on the next page, Page 5, "Long
10	before the 1964 Surgeon General's report, the public
11	was aware of the health risk of smoking. As early
12	as 1604, King James I issued 'A Counter-Blaste
13	Against Tobacco,' which condemned smoking."
14	Now, you don't mean to suggest, do you,
15	Professor Greenwood, that the American public was in
16	any way aware of King James' book "A Counter-Blaste
17	Against Tobacco"? That's not the nature of the
18	claim that's being made, is it?
19	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: 1604 obviously is before
21	there was a settlement in North America or a
22	permanent settlement in North America. So again, I
23	used this example here to basically talk about the
24	fact that there was awareness almost as soon as
51
CONFIDENTIAL
1	tobacco was introduced to Europeans by
2	Native Americans that there were problems associated
3	with it, that, you know, people talked very early on
4	about it having, for example, bewitching qualities,
5	that we would, you know, say -- or about, you know,
6	habit-forming kinds of qualities.
7	King James' "Counter-Blaste Against
8	Tobacco" was something that, you know, based on my
9	research seemed to get -- that a lot of people
10	certainly in England seemed to have been aware of
11	because he was such a strong antitobacco advocate as
12	early as 1604. It's just an example to show how far
13	back individuals were aware of health and other
14	problems associated with tobacco use.
15	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
16	Q. Okay. I'm going to try to frame my
17	questions kind of narrowly to see -- I'm trying to
18	probe what it means for the public to be aware.
19	You don't mean to suggest that any member
20	of the class in this case was aware or is aware
21	today that King James in 1604 published a book
22	criticizing the newly imported practice of tobacco
23	smoking, do you?
24	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
52
CONFIDENTIAL
1	THE WITNESS: Again, I think this quote
2	has to be read in context, and my intention I think
3	is clear in the report that, you know, people were
4	talking about tobacco and tobacco-related problems
5	long before 1964, and that's what -- that's why I
6	used this one example, to show that.
7	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
8	Q. I understand, but my question is really --
9	I understand that that answer might be responsive to
10	a different question, which is why did you cite
11	King James' "Counter-Blaste Against Tobacco."
12	My question is, you don't mean to suggest
13	that any member of the class in this case, people
14	who purchased Marlboro Lights in Missouri between
15	1995 and 2003, was in any way aware of King James'
16	1604 publication "A Counter-Blaste Against Tobacco"?
17	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: No, I'm not suggesting that.
19	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
20	Q. Okay. Now, are you aware of any other
21	books King James wrote?
22	A. He certainly had a lot to do with the
23	King James version of the Bible that comes out
24	during his reign, but I again focused on tobacco
53
CONFIDENTIAL
1	issues here.
2	Q. Okay. You're not aware that he published
3	a book called Daemonologie in 1597 where he said
4	there are such things as witches and taught about
5	how you could identify witches and then you would
6	either bum them or drown them or hang them? You're
7	not aware that he published that book, right?
8	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
9	THE WITNESS: No, I'm not.
10	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
11	Q. Okay. So I take it Daemonologie, which is
12	the name of the book published in 1597, is not part
13	of public awareness in the United States?
14	MR. SNAPP: I object to the form.
15	THE WITNESS: Public awareness regard --
16	I'm sorry, could you explain a little bit what you
17	mean? Public awareness regarding what?
18	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
19	Q. Anything. As you have used the term
20	public awareness, is there public awareness among
21	Missouri members of the class that King James I
22	published a book in 1597 titled Daemonologie which
23	was on the practice of identifying and persecuting
CONFIDENTIAL
1	A. I would say no, but I have never done
2	research on public awareness regarding demons and
3	witches, so I would -- you know, to be sure of my
4	answer, I would have to do that research.
5	Q. Now, before you began researching for the
6	tobacco for Philip Morris, were you aware of
7	King James' 1604 publication?
8	A. Actually I'm a southern historian, and
9	tobacco of course was fundamental to the development
10	of Jamestown and southern colonies and to the
11	United States in general or what would become the
12	United States, so this actually has come up in some
13	books that I've read about tobacco culture.
14	Q. Okay. Do you think the class, any members
15	of the class knows very much about King James?
16	A. Probably not. I don't know. But I --
17	that's not what I researched, so I couldn't tell you
18	with any degree of certainty.
19	Q. Okay. Now, I want to --1 want to go to
20	this topic of public awareness because I'm kind of
21	interested in it.
22	Now, in your report, let me see if I
23	understand how you're using public awareness. And I
24	direct your attention to Page 2, Paragraph C2. "The
CONFIDENTIAL
1	concept of public awareness is a familiar one to
2	social historians. It is the knowledge that is
3	shared within a community as reflected in and
4	reinforced by a number of sources that were widely
5	disseminated in that community, including
6	newspapers, magazines and songs, and since the
7	20th century other dimensions of popular culture
8	such as movies, televisions and cartoons."
9	Is that a definition of public awareness
10	that you came up with?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. Okay. Now, you don't cite any
13	peer-reviewed or otherwise scholarly information
14	saying that definition of public awareness is a
15	meaningful concept to historians, do you?
16	A. I don't cite it in the report. I do have
17	a reference in my reliance list. Historians Tosh
18	and Lang are the authors of that book who talk
19	about -- oftentimes historians will use the term
20	mentalitie, which derives from the French historians
21	who first came up with that concept, you know, back
22	in the 1920s and '30s, which is synonymous with
23	public awareness.
24	So I do have that in my reliance list.
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Q. Okay. And that is published by who?
2	A. The authors are Tosh and Lang. T-o-s-h
3	and L-a-n-g are the authors.
4	Q. Now, public awareness -- prior to being
5	retained by Philip Morris, had you ever heard of
6	Monograph 13?
7	A. It's kind of hard to say only because my
8	research and my own memories kind of meld together.
9	I do recall there being -- I'm not sure I would have
10	given it the name Monograph 13, but I do remember
11	there being information coming out in 2001 about
12	low-tar cigarettes because it got so much play.
13	Q. Now, public awareness as you've defined
14	it, that doesn't equate that the information as to
15	which there is public awareness is actually known
16	and believed by any individual member of the public,
17	does it?
18	MR. SNAPP: Objection, object to the form,
19	it's compound.
20	THE WITNESS: Public awareness as I've
21	defined it is based on again information that is
22	readily available to the public emanating from a
23	variety of sources, reinforced, widely deeply
24	distributed, again reinforced, echoed, reiterated.
CONFIDENTIAL
1	The issue of belief, what people do with
2	that information, is a whole other issue, and that's
3	not public awareness. That's going into, you know,
4	a whole other area.
5	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
6	Q. Okay. So let me mark as my first exhibit,
7	if I haven't messed things up -- I'm sorry for being
8	a little bit disorganized here, Professor. It will
9	take me just a moment.
10	MR. SURPRENANT: Let me mark as Exhibit 1
11	a demonstrative that I've created. Would you mark
12	that as Exhibit 1 and provide it to the witness.
13	And I'm sorry, I only have one copy.
14	MS. BERNSTEIN-GAETA: That's okay, we will
15	share.
16	MR. SURPRENANT: At the Dr. English
17	deposition there was only one lawyer, so that was
18	my ...
19	(Exhibit 1 was marked for
20	identification.)
21	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
22	Q. Now, I'm trying to -- public awareness,
23	I'm really trying to get an understanding, and what
24	I have marked as Exhibit 1, which will be attached
58
CONFIDENTIAL
1	as part of the record -- oh, by the way, Professor,
2	the way it works is there will be a transcript made,
3	and you'll get to read the transcript, and you'll be
4	allowed to make any corrections. In my view as a
5	lawyer, the corrections you're allowed to make are
6	if the court reporter makes a typographical error.
7	Some other lawyers think you can actually change the
8	substance of your testimony, but if you do make any
9	changes, at trial that can be called out to the
10	Jury.
11	But here what I've marked as Exhibit 1, it
12	says Professor Greenwood's expert testimony in Craft
13	versus Philip Morris, and on the left-hand side I
14	have, quote, public awareness, and by that I mean
15	public awareness as defined in Paragraph C2 of your
16	expert report in this case.
17	And I take it it does not equal actually
18	being known and believed by any individual member of
19	the public, correct?
20	A. That's right.
21	Q. Okay. So we could put a not equal sign
22	there, and that would -- that would be correct?
23	A. That's true, yes.
24	Q. Okay. Now, let me go to my next --
59
CONFIDENTIAL
1	MR. SNAPP: Are you done with this one?
2	MR. SURPRENANT: Yes.
3	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
4	Q. Now, I take it I started off with any
5	individual member of the public, and now I'm going
6	to ask by all members of the public, and that is
7	public awareness as you've used it does not equate
8	to being actually known and believed by all members
9	of the public, correct?
10	A. Yes, that's right.
11	MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. So could we mark
12	this as Exhibit 2.
13	(Exhibit 2 was marked for
14	identification.)
15	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
16	Q. And here as in my last one I put public
17	awareness, and I put actually known and believed by
18	all members of the public, and in your view as an
19	expert historian, public awareness does not equal
20	being actually known and believed by all members of
21	the public, correct?
22	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: Wait, I'm sorry. Would you
24	please restate that question.
60
CONFIDENTIAL
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
2	Q. Sure. Public awareness as you have
3	defined it in Paragraph C2 of your expert report
4	does not equal that the information as to which
5	there is public awareness is actually known and
6	believed by all members of the public?
7	A. Right, because as I've defined public
8	awareness, it's not about belief. It's about --
9	it's information based on -- public awareness is
10	based on information that's readily available to the
11	members of the public.
12	Q. I'm sorry, Professor. Let me now -- let
13	me now break down my question, and going back to
14	Exhibit 1, public awareness --
15	A. Let me see Exhibit 1 again.
17	A. Excuse me. Thanks.
18	Q. Now, earlier you said that public
19	awareness as you've used it doesn't equate to
20	actually being known and believed by any individual
21	member of the public. Let's take out and believed.
22	Public awareness also doesn't equal that
23	it's actually known by any individual member of the
24	public, correct?
61
CONFIDENTIAL
1	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: Public awareness is based on
3	information that is readily available to members of
4	the public. It's the information environment, based
5	on the information environment, the information
6	that's disseminated and reiterated and echoed over a
7	period of time to the public.
8	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
9	Q. Like for example my wife, who is an
10	architect and a graduate of Harvard Law School, very
11	well-read, reads two newspapers and multiple
12	magazines, she had never heard of Monograph 13, and
13	that's not surprising because is Monograph 13
14	something as to which there is public awareness?
15	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
16	THE WITNESS: Monograph 13 as I talk about
17	it in the report and have documented in the report
18	is part of the information environment that people
19	had ready access to. As I point out, Monograph --
20	you know, reports about Monograph 13 were
21	disseminated in Missouri newspapers, the national
22	press. "The Today Show" did a whole big morning
23	segment on Monograph 13 interviewing the Surgeon
24	General and as well as Sarah Brady, who was an
62
CONFIDENTIAL
1	antismoking advocate. Monograph 13 was discussed on
2	evening news shows, on radio shows.
3	It was again part of this broad, broadly
4	disseminated, deeply disseminated information
5	readily available to the public.
6	MR. SURPRENANT: Mr. Reporter, could I
7	have my question reread.
8	(Question read.)
9	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
10	Q. Okay. Strike that. Let me rephrase my
11	question.
12	It would not surprise you that any
13	individual member of the public neither knows about
14	the specific publication Monograph 13 nor knows
15	about the substance that it reported on light
16	cigarettes, correct?
17	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: Again, I'm not sure I'm
19	getting your question. I cannot tell you again as
20	an expert witness here what any individual heard,
21	believed, had an opinion about, but I can tell you
22	again as was my charge as an expert witness in this
23	case to tell you again the -- to give you a sense,
24	to document the information that was readily
63
CONFIDENTIAL
1	available to the public regarding light cigarettes.
2	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
3	Q. Now, there was -- I'm going to return to
4	this because I really want to focus on the extent to
5	which there is a disconnect or at least no necessary
6	connection between public awareness and actual
7	knowledge, and I want to return to that.
8	But do you know what the open question
9	strategy was?
10	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: I'm -- no, I don't know what
12	you're referring to.
13	MR. SURPRENANT: Could you mark this as
14	Exhibit 3.
15	(Exhibit 3 was marked for
16	identification.)
17	MR. SNAPP: Are you done with 1 and 2 for
18	now?
19	MR. SURPRENANT: No, I'll be going right
20	back to that.
21	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
22	Q. Exhibit 3 is titled A Frank Statement to
23	Cigarette Smokers. It was an advertisement that
24	appeared in I think 466 American newspapers in 1954.
64
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Have you ever seen this report, this
2	advertisement before?
3	A. Yes, I have seen it.
4	Q. Okay. And are you aware that this
5	advertisement -- this was widely disseminated to the
6	public?
7	MR. SNAPP: Is there a question? Object
8	to the form.
9	THE WITNESS: Yes, is that -
10	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
11	Q. Was this -- do you have any understanding
12	whether or not this advertisement was widely
13	disseminated to the American public?
14	A. I know it appeared in as you mentioned
15	several hundred newspapers. Widely disseminated?
16	Again, by my definitions, this particular statement
17	is in newspapers. It's in one source. By my
18	definition of widely disseminated, you know, again I
19	think of many good examples in my report including,
20	you know, reports on Monograph 13, the Surgeon
21	General's reports and things like that, widely
22	disseminated as I define it and, you know, use the
23	concept in my report is that it's information that's
24	coming from a variety of sources. This is one
65
CONFIDENTIAL
1	statement coming from the tobacco industry that gets
2	published in newspapers.
3	Q. Do you know what the Tobacco Institute is?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. What was it?
6	A. It was an organization put together by the
7	tobacco industry in the 1950s that was -- served
8	several purposes as I understand it. One was they
9	did research on issues of smoking and health and
10	gave grants to do research and things like that for
11	smoking and health issues, on smoking and health
12	issues, and they also were provided sort of -- they
13	were spokes -- they were spokespeople for the
14	tobacco industry.
15	Q. And they were a critical player in the
16	open question strategy, correct?
17	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: Again, I don't know what you
19	mean by the open question strategy.
20	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
21	Q. You're not aware that this advertisement
22	marked as Exhibit 3 was one of the first, if not the
23	first, public executions of the open question
24	strategy on behalf of the tobacco industry; is that
66
CONFIDENTIAL
1	correct?
2	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form and
3	foundation, vague.
4	THE WITNESS: Again, I'm not sure, you
5	know, with all due respect what you mean by the open
6	question strategy. I guess you'd need to define
7	that for me.
8	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
9	Q. And the open question strategy is not
10	anything you as a social historian who has studied
11	the tobacco industry could identify without me
12	defining for you; is that correct?
13	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
14	THE WITNESS: Again, my job, my charge in
15	this case is not to study the tobacco industry. My
16	charge as a social historian was to determine the
17	knowledge, what public awareness was regarding light
18	cigarettes based on the information that was readily
19	available to people, broadly disseminated, deeply
20	disseminated and echoed over time.
21	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
22	Q. Now, do you know how much money the
23	Tobacco Institute spent over its lifetime promoting
24	as its exclusive and if not exclusive principal
67
CONFIDENTIAL
1	message that there was no scientific proof between
2	smoking and disease and that nicotine wasn't
3	addictive?
4	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
5	THE WITNESS: No, I don't know the amount
6	of money that was spent. I do know that the tobacco
7	industry's voice is one voice that's out there in
8	the information environment. I, you know, referred
9	to numerous times in my report what the tobacco
10	industry said about various issues regarding smoking
11	and health and light cigarettes over the years, and,
12	you know, it's one voice, and it's -- as a
13	historian, of course I incorporate it into my
14	analysis, but it's one voice. It's not a voice that
15	I see being echoed and reiterated and reinforced
16	from other sources.
17	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
18	Q. Would it surprise you if the Tobacco
19	Institute spent over $680 million spreading the
20	message that smoking did not cause disease and was
21	not addictive?
22	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: I guess are you asking me
24	would I be surprised as a lay person, surprised as a
68
CONFIDENTIAL
1	social historian? I'm not sure what you're asking.
2	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
3	Q. Surprised as someone who has prepared six
4	expert reports for litigation for Philip Morris.
5	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form,
6	mischaracterizes her prior testimony.
7	THE WITNESS: Again, I - you know, I
8	don't really have an opinion regarding how much they
9	spent. I looked at the tobacco industry's
10	statements, their appearances on television news
11	shows and radio shows and their, you know,
12	statements in magazines and newspapers and things
13	like that and, you know, again viewed them within
14	the broader context of information that was out
15	there and basically see them as one voice in a very
16	broad array of information that's basically telling
17	people there's no such thing as a safe cigarette
18	and, you know, the less tar you ingest the better
19	and, you know, if you're going to smoke, switch down
20	but don't change your habits of smoking.
21	So again, the tobacco industry is one
22	voice out there.
23	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
24	Q. I mean, $680 million is a lot of voice,
CONFIDENTIAL
1	right?
2	MR. SNAPP: Objection to form.
3	THE WITNESS: I don't know.
4	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
5	Q. Okay. Now, one of the things that you
6	address in your report is public awareness of the
7	health effects of smoking, correct?
8	A. In general. I talk about -- that was, you
9	know, less the focus. I mean, again, I think my
10	charge in this case was quite specific, and it's
11	about what people knew regarding light cigarettes.
12	So as health issues related to light
13	cigarettes, that was information that I researched,
14	yes.
15	Q. And your report --1 mean, it goes back
16	to, you know, the background before the 1964 Surgeon
17	General's report. Well, strike that.
18	If a member of the public does not believe
19	smoking regular cigarettes causes disease or
20	addictive -- or is addictive, I take it that that
21	individual will not think -- strike that.
22	If a smoker were to believe the Tobacco
23	Institute that smoking doesn't cause disease and is
24	not addictive, I take it that that person would also
CONFIDENTIAL
1	believe that smoking Marlboro Lights does not cause
2	disease and is not addictive, correct, as a matter
3	of logic?
4	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
5	THE WITNESS: I don't think I would - I
6	could make that logical connection, no.
7	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
8	Q. Okay.
9	A. And again, I'm not --1 did not study or
10	analyze or come to conclusions about people's
11	beliefs. I have documented again the information
12	that was out there, the basis of public awareness.
13	What an individual chose to do with that information
14	is an entirely different matter, and that's not the
15	venue of an area of expertise of a social historian.
16	Q. Well, okay. But you were -- you were
17	interested in a general matter with public awareness
18	of the health effects of smoking and for most of
19	your report more specifically with public awareness
20	of the health effects of smoking light or
21	reduced-tar cigarettes, correct?
22	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: I was asked to determine
24	what information was disseminated to the public,
CONFIDENTIAL
1	specifically residents of Missouri, regarding light
2	cigarettes and what the messages were that resonated
3	over time.
4	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
5	Q. And indeed your report contains thousands
6	of mentions of the dissemination of information to
7	the public about the health risk of smoking
8	reduced-tar cigarettes, reduced-tar and nicotine
9	cigarettes, correct?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. Okay. It contains not a single example of
12	smoking being glamorized in movies or televisions or
13	novels or magazines, does it?
14	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
15	THE WITNESS: Well, I think when you're
16	talking about glamorized, I think you are looking
17	at, you know, again an area of -- that was outside
18	of my charge. You're talking about perceptions that
19	people had regarding cigarettes.
20	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
21	Q. Well, certainly you have seen movies where
22	cigarette smoking was portrayed in a glamorous way,
23	right?
24	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
72
CONFIDENTIAL
1	THE WITNESS: Are you asking me as a lay
2	person again or as a historian?
3	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
4	Q. Casablanca is an iconic movie, correct?
5	A. I'm not a movie expert. I guess it would
6	be to some people, yes.
7	Q. And yeah, and smoking, Humphrey Bogart
8	smoking is portrayed not in a negative way but is
9	part of a thoroughly admirable character, correct?
10	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: Again, I think what people's
12	perceptions are of things like that, you know, are
13	beyond my expertise as an historian.
14	I also know, you know, that there was a
15	great deal made in news reports and newspapers and
16	magazines that Humphrey Bogart died of lung cancer.
17	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
18	Q. Right. Now, but my question is is --
19	well, let me ask this question.
20	The phrase "glamorizing smoking in movies,
21	television, novels and magazines" describes a
22	concept that you can understand as a social
23	historian, doesn't it?
24	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
73
CONFIDENTIAL
1	THE WITNESS: Again, I think that's
2	given -- given my charge in this case, the questions
3	I was asked to pursue and to research and to come to
4	conclusions about, perception is not one of them.
5	What people take away is not something that I, you
6	know, feel comfortable drawing conclusions about.
7	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
8	Q. Okay.
9	A. Because I think it's in a whole different
10	realm.
11	Q. You would -- do -- you have no knowledge
12	that cigarettes were portrayed as part of a
13	glamorous lifestyle in American culture over the
14	time you examined in your report in movies,
15	televisions, novels and magazines?
16	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form, asked and
17	answered, compound.
18	THE WITNESS: Again, I think I have
19	answered the question. My charge was to document
20	the information that was disseminated. Again, what
21	people choose to do with that, what they choose to
22	believe, the opinions they have again are not -- is
23	not something that I've been asked to do here, and
24	again, I feel it's beyond my area of expertise.
74
CONFIDENTIAL
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
2	Q. Right. And so as a consequence, there is
3	not a single mention in your report about movies,
4	televisions, novels or magazines portraying smoking
5	in a positive light, correct?
6	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form, asked and
7	answered.
8	MR. SURPRENANT: It's been asked.
9	THE WITNESS: Again, I didn't, you know,
10	include that information because I think it's, you
11	know -- it gets into the area of perception. I'm
12	sure there are people who could look at, you know,
13	people smoking on -- smoking up a storm on TV and
14	movies and be repulsed by that as well, but I think
15	that again is getting into a whole other area of
16	expertise.
17	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
18	Q. And you don't have a single mention of
19	advertising by tobacco companies associating smoking
20	with healthy lifestyles, that's not in your report,
21	is it?
22	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: I have included ads in my
24	reliance list. As you see, there are quite a few of
75
CONFIDENTIAL
1	them. I looked at ads again within the broader
2	context in which they appeared, newspapers,
3	magazines. I'm not an advertising expert. I don't
4	pretend to be one.
5	I'm not comfortable drawing any
6	conclusions again about what people take away from
7	ads. Ads are part of that information environment,
8	which is why I included them in my reliance list.
9	In terms of interpreting them, I think, you know,
10	you need to talk to an advertising expert or
11	consumer behaviorist, not a social historian.
12	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
13	Q. Yeah, let me just try to get a specific
14	answer to my specific question.
15	Within the body of your 66-page report,
16	there is not a single mention made of advertising by
17	tobacco companies which portrays smoking light
18	cigarettes in a positive and healthy fashion?
19	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: Again, I'll repeat what
21	I've --1 think I've said and trying to make clear
22	here is that, you know, glamorous, you know, the
23	descriptors that you just used, I think that's
24	perception, and again, my job was to give a sense
76
CONFIDENTIAL
1	of, you know, the information that was readily
2	available to people.
3	What people took away from an ad, what
4	they even took away from a Surgeon General's report,
5	again, I can't --1 can't tell you. Again, that's
6	beyond my area of expertise as a social historian.
7	I can only tell you what was out there, and
8	certainly ads were out there, and that's why I
9	included them in -- on my reliance list.
10	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
11	Q. But in the body of your report, my
12	question is, there is not a single mention made of
13	advertising by Philip Morris or other cigarette
14	companies in which they portrayed light cigarettes
15	as part of a healthy lifestyle of young and active
16	adults, correct?
17	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form, asked and
18	answered at least twice before.
19	MR. SURPRENANT: It has been asked. It
20	has not been answered.
21	MR. SNAPP: And answered.
22	MR. SURPRENANT: The Professor, it's her
23	first deposition. She has told me in response to
24	numerous multiple questions what her charge was,
77
CONFIDENTIAL
1	what she was interested in, what her conclusion is.
2	As you know, a deposition is meant to examine the
3	expert opinion. I have not --1 have rarely gotten
4	answers that are responsive to my question.
5	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
6	Q. My present question is simply this: Your
7	66-page report does not make a single mention about
8	advertising by cigarette companies which portrayed
9	smoking light cigarettes in a positive way, correct?
10	MR. SNAPP: Objection to the form of the
11	question.
12	You may answer.
13	THE WITNESS: My 66-page report does not
14	include references to advertisements, that's true.
15	I included the advertisements on my reliance list to
16	show you that I was aware of them, that I viewed
17	them within again this larger body of information
18	that was disseminated to the public.
19	The interpretation of them, whether they
20	were glamorous or showing happy people, whatever,
21	again I think is beyond my expertise as a social
22	historian.
23	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
24	Q. Yeah, and really, we will be -- what I'm
78
CONFIDENTIAL
1	trying to understand and make clear so the jury will
2	understand it and there won't be any confusion is
3	what are the limits a social historian has on what
4	people actually know, know, and even if they know it
5	what they believe, and that's why I'm asking. I'm
6	very well aware of what your report does. I've read
7	it. I've studied it closely. I've spilled coffee
8	on it, in fact, coffee which I wish I had.
9	But that's all I'm doing. So, Professor,
10	when I want to ask you a question, what did you look
11	at and what did you conclude, I've been doing this a
12	long time. I know how to do that.
13	Okay. So let's move on.
14	Now, your report, which is single-spaced
15	and 66 pages long and has 287 footnotes, it does
16	make mention of communications by the tobacco
17	industry and its spokesmen questioning the link
18	between smoking and disease or that nicotine was
19	addictive.
20	There are comments about that, correct?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And by my count, that occurs six times in
23	eight sentences.
24	Does that sound approximately correct?
79
CONFIDENTIAL
1	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: Honestly I'd have to go back
3	and look myself. I can't be exact.
4	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
5	Q. Okay. So let me go back to the open
6	question strategy.
7	You are not aware that from 1954 through
8	1999 the tobacco industry, including Philip Morris,
9	including the Tobacco Institute, including the
10	Council on Tobacco Research, followed a very
11	self-conscious policy to through its public
12	communications, its advertisements, its press
13	releases, to create public awareness of its message
14	that there was an open question in the public health
15	community whether smoking caused disease or was
16	addictive?
17	MR. SNAPP: Object. Are you finished?
18	MR. SURPRENANT: Yes.
19	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: Are you asking me whether I
21	was aware of that strategy?
22	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
23	Q. Yes.
24	A. Yes, I am --1 certainly was aware, am
80
CONFIDENTIAL
1	aware of that strategy. I wasn't sure what you
2	meant by the open question strategy. I guess I've
3	never quite heard it put that way, but yes, that was
4	a strategy, yes.
5	Q. Okay. And that's not discussed in your
6	report?
7	A. The strategy itself? I'm sorry, what's
8	that? Which that are you referring to?
9	Q. That Philip Morris in concert with other
10	members of the tobacco industry spent over a billion
11	dollars and 45 years trying to create public
12	awareness of its message that there was no
13	scientific proof that smoking caused disease or was
14	addictive.
15	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
16	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry, would you repeat
17	the question again?
18	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
19	Q. Sure.
20	A. I spaced out there.
21	Q. Your report focuses because the lawyers
22	for Philip Morris asked you to focus on what
23	information was widely disseminated to the public on
24	the health effects of light cigarettes.
81
CONFIDENTIAL
1	In the course of a 66-page discussion, it
2	does not mention the fact that Philip Morris in
3	concert with other members of the tobacco industry
4	deliberately tried to undermine that very message,
5	correct?
6	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form. Object to
7	the preamble to the question.
8	THE WITNESS: For the first part of your
9	question, again, if I may break it down into several
10	parts.
11	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
12	Q. Absolutely.
13	MR. SNAPP: That's not your job. If he
14	wants to break it down into parts --
15	THE WITNESS: Okay. Maybe would you be
16	willing to please break that down a bit?
17	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
18	Q. Your -- because the tobacco -- because the
19	way the tobacco lawyers, Philip Morris' lawyers,
20	phrased your historical research, you did not think
21	it was relevant to examine or report about the
22	efforts of Philip Morris and other members of the
23	tobacco industry that publicly tried to undermine
24	information relating to information widely
CONFIDENTIAL
1	disseminated to the public that there were health
2	risks in smoking low-tar cigarettes, correct?
3	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: No. First of all, the
5	question I was charged with answering was an
6	open-ended question and a good research question I
7	think that did not have any inherent bias in it to
8	look for particular things.
9	I do mention the Tobacco Institute and
10	denials regarding smoking and health issues at least
11	a couple of times. Again, I would have to go back
12	and look at this.
13	And the Tobacco Institute, tobacco
14	industry, Philip Morris spokespeople, you know,
15	spokespersons for the tobacco industry are one voice
16	out there. They are one voice in a broad array of
17	voices. They may have been saying, you know, to use
18	your term having, you know, an open -- did you say
19	open-ended strategy? Open question strategy,
20	regarding smoking and health issues, but they are
21	one voice. Nobody else out there in this
22	information universe that was available to people is
23	saying that, you know, smoking is good for you,
24	smoking is not harmful, that, you know, you can
CONFIDENTIAL
1	smoke these and not worry about anything. No one
2	else is saying that.
3	So again, as I'm trying to assess and I
4	did assess public awareness, I look at the Tobacco
5	Institute, I look at Philip Morris spokespeople.
6	They are one voice, but they're one voice among many
7	that's simply saying the opposite.
8	So, you know, they may have spent
9	billions, X billions of dollars to try to influence
10	public awareness as you said, but there -- in my
11	judgment as the expert in this case as a social
12	historian, that voice is drowned out over time.
13	It's a voice that actually I think diminishes over
14	time.
15	If one looks at newspapers in the '50s and
16	'60s, for example, lots of times, even magazines,
17	lots of time they would devote, you know, a whole
18	article to what the Tobacco Institute said regarding
19	a Surgeon General's report, regarding some kind of
20	research that had recently been conducted and was
21	publicized.
22	By, you know, the late 1960s, the Tobacco
23	Institute's voice is, you know, one or two sentences
24	in an article. It's there. It's out there. It's
CONFIDENTIAL
1	one voice. It's not a message that is being
2	reinforced and reiterated and echoed through other
3	sources.
4	So yes, I looked at Tobacco Institute's
5	statements. I included them in my report. But
6	again, assessing that voice, that message within
7	this much broader context of information, I just
8	don't see it having that much impact on public
9	awareness.
10	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
11	Q. Do you think that -- you say it's one
12	actor.
13	You have multiple tobacco companies, each
14	buying advertisements, correct?
15	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
16	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
17	Q. Over the class period you've studied?
18	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: Yes.
20	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
21	Q. And you have multiple tobacco industry
22	organizations trying to get the tobacco companies'
23	message out, correct?
24	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
85
CONFIDENTIAL
1	THE WITNESS: There are numerous tobacco
2	companies trying to send a message to buy
3	cigarettes.
4	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
5	Q. And so it's just not the case that there
6	was one voice saying don't believe what you hear
7	about smoking causing disease, there were multiple
8	speakers of that message, correct?
9	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
10	THE WITNESS: I think you're
11	misinterpreting what I'm saying a bit. Again, I'm
12	not denying there are multiple companies, multiple
13	cigarette companies with multiple products, and, you
14	know, one Tobacco Institute at least up through the
15	1990s.
16	Their message I would say again in looking
17	at what messages are disseminated is the same, is to
18	buy this product. It's one -- again, it's one voice
19	out there. It's one message that doesn't get
20	reiterated. I don't see anybody else, any other
21	sources of information that are, you know, saying
22	buy this product, smoking is good for you.
23	Again, the message is over and over from a
24	variety of sources, you know, Surgeon General's
86
CONFIDENTIAL
1	report, scientific reports and newspapers, health
2	organizations, school textbooks, public service
3	announcements, American Cancer Society, there's no
4	safe -- there's no such thing as a safe cigarette.
5	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
6	Q. Are you familiar with a hearing before
7	Congressman Waxman of California in 1994?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. Okay. A year before the class period,
10	correct?
11	A. 1994, no.
12	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: Wait. I'm sorry.
14	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
15	Q. The class period begins in 1995.
16	A. '95, yes.
17	Q. Okay. So a year before the class period
18	begins, something pretty extraordinary happened at
19	that hearing in front of Professor --
20	Congressman Waxman and his committee, correct?
21	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
22	THE WITNESS: I'm not sure exactly what
23	you're referring to. There were a number of people
24	who met, who appeared before that committee, so I
87
CONFIDENTIAL
1	guess I'm not quite sure what you're referring to.
2	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
3	Q. You remember -- are you aware Mr. Campbell
4	appeared and testified under oath before that
5	committee?
6	A. Off the top of my head, no.
7	Q. Do you know --
8	A. But it's probably in my notes somewhere.
9	Q. I'll redo this on the fly.
10	Are you aware of whether any Philip Morris
11	employee or spokesman took the oath to tell the
12	truth and told the Congressman and his committee and
13	the American people that tobacco wasn't addictive?
14	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
15	THE WITNESS: Again, I - I have read the
16	Waxman, you know, reports, the reports from the
17	Waxman committee as they were published in the
18	newspapers. I would need to go back and look
19	specifically for what you're talking about, and I've
20	looked at probably thousands of articles.
21	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
22	Q. Well, that was certainly widely
23	disseminated, and it was followed up by advertising
24	the next day by Philip Morris and the rest of the
88
CONFIDENTIAL
1	tobacco industry reiterating the message that there
2	was no scientific proof ostensibly that smoking was
3	addictive or caused disease. That was widely
4	disseminated to the public, correct?
5	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
6	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
7	Q. Or don't you know that?
8	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
9	THE WITNESS: I know that Waxman hearings
10	were reported on television news and they were in
11	newspapers and things like that.
12	Again, I think my point about reiterated
13	maybe is -- maybe isn't -- you know, I'm not perhaps
14	making clear. Again, for information to, you know,
15	be -- for public awareness to be based on or for
16	information to build up to the point of public
17	awareness, it has to be reiterated through a variety
18	of sources, not just from one source. It's only the
19	tobacco industry that is saying cigarettes aren't
20	addictive, and as I recall, in the 1990s, that was a
21	laughable statement. Late night comics and other
22	people, there were cartoons in the newspapers at
23	this time basically making fun of such an absurd
24	notion, which again I think only supports my
89
CONFIDENTIAL
1	argument that the public was certainly aware by that
2	time that cigarettes were addictive because they'd
3	been hearing that for decades by that point.
4	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
5	Q. Now, you say that the voice of the tobacco
6	industry disputing the link between smoking and
7	health and disputing that smoking wasn't addictive
8	was I think your word was overwhelmed by other
9	information; is that correct?
10	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: My point is that again it's
12	one bit of -- it's one voice. It's one message in a
13	broad environment of antismoking messages and
14	messages that, you know, clearly point to the fact
15	that the public was aware that smoking was
16	addictive. It's one voice.
17	And again, I -- you know, I think I can
18	give you many examples if you'd like of again the
19	kind of evidence that's out there from very early on
20	regarding the fact that cigarettes were addictive,
21	that cigarettes were not good for you. That's not
22	something new even at the time of the Surgeon
23	General's report in 1964.
24	MR. SURPRENANT: I'm sorry, I just
90
CONFIDENTIAL
1	realized I failed to call my wife this morning, and
2	she's just about ready to leave, so let's go off the
3	record.
4	MR. SNAPP: Why don't we take a break.
5	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record.
6	(Whereupon, a short recess was
7	taken.)
8	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Okay. We're back on
9	the record. The time is 11:31.
10	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
11	Q. Okay. Thank you. Do you think that the
12	voice, as you have used it, of the tobacco industry
13	denying smoking-caused health issues, disease or
14	addiction was less than 1 percent of the total voice
15	in the public over the period you looked at?
16	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
17	THE WITNESS: I don't - I don't think,
18	you know, quantifying is --1 wouldn't quantify that
19	particularly. Again, I -- you know, it's looking --
20	as I've tried to explain, I've looked at this broad
21	context of information. The tobacco industry is one
22	voice. I don't hear anybody else saying cigarettes
23	are not addictive, there's no, you know, link
24	between cigarettes and health issues. Nobody else
91
CONFIDENTIAL
1	is saying that. And they haven't said it now for
2	years.
3	I mean, I point out in my report people
4	talk about coffin nails, the term of the
5	20th century Little White Slavers, talking about
6	addiction in the 1920s, Henry Ford's famous book.
7	Reader's Digest publishes "Cancer by the Carton,"
8	1952, which got a lot of press.
9	1954, the American Cancer Society comes
10	out and says, you know, that the weight of evidence
11	seems to indicate that there's a link between
12	smoking and cancer, all this before the '64 Surgeon
13	General's report. Even when the Surgeon General's
14	report comes out, most commentary at the time is
15	like this isn't a surprise. This is stuff we knew.
16	1968, Daniel Horn, head of the -- one of
17	the leaders, chief researchers of the American
18	Cancer Society said you could stand on a rooftop and
19	yell, you know, that smoking isn't good for you,
20	smoking causes cancer, and you're not telling
21	anybody anything they don't already know.
22	So again, looking at the tobacco
23	industry's statements within this broader context,
24	nobody else is giving that, giving that same
92
CONFIDENTIAL
1	message. Again, getting back to my definition, it's
2	not a message about -- you know, that gets
3	reinforced, reiterated, echoed through other
4	sources. It's one voice.
5	(Exhibit 4 was marked for
6	identification.)
7	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
8	Q. Okay. Well, I wrote down and marked as
9	Exhibit 4 a piece of paper, my handwriting,
10	Professor Greenwood's Report, mentions of tobacco
11	industry's disputing link between smoking and health
12	or that smoking was addictive, and I cite to Page 6,
13	Paragraph 5; Pages 17 and 18, Paragraph 5; Page 18,
14	Paragraph 6; Page 19, Paragraph 8; Page 20,
15	Paragraph 9; Page 31, Paragraph 10. And in
16	parenthesis I indicate the number of sentences, and
17	by my count eight sentences in your report mention
18	this.
19	And so I was just showing it to you to ask
20	this. I think that's the complete mention made in
21	your report of the voice of the tobacco industry and
22	ask you if I've missed anything or would that
23	take -- would you have to look?
24	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
93
CONFIDENTIAL
1	THE WITNESS: Your question is is this an
2	accurate list?
3	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
4	Q. Is there any other -- yes, I'm sorry,
5	Professor.
6	Are there any other examples in your
7	66-page report with 280-some footnotes where you
8	cull out the tobacco industry's questioning whether
9	there was any health issues associated with smoking?
10	MR. SNAPP: Objection to form.
11	THE WITNESS: I would have to go back and
12	read my report and count again.
13	Again, I just want to say one thing that I
14	think is relevant to your list here is that my
15	focus, again the question was -- that I was asked to
16	research was really about public awareness regarding
17	light cigarettes.
18	So I certainly spent less time in this
19	report talking about addiction. I certainly do talk
20	about addiction as it relates to light cigarettes
21	and issues such as compensation, but addiction was
22	not the main focus of this report --
23	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
24	Q. So -
94
CONFIDENTIAL
1	A. -- as I think I explain in the questions
2	that are laid out.
3	Q. Sure. And so I take it your view is by
4	the beginning of the class period, 1995, there was a
5	very broad and deep public understanding that
6	smoking cigarettes caused disease and was addictive,
7	is that fair?
8	A. Again, I --1 don't --1 would qualify
9	that statement. It's not what people understood.
10	I'm not saying what people understood because,
11	again, understanding is related to belief, it's
12	related to perception, it's related to opinion.
13	What I'm saying is that by 1995 and
14	certainly through the 1990s as well through this
15	class period there was a wide, widely disseminated,
16	deeply disseminated message that was echoed through
17	a variety of sources that there was no such thing as
18	a safe cigarette.
19	Q. Right. And that it was widely
20	disseminated by 1995 that smoking cigarettes would
21	kill, could kill you, could cause disease and was
22	addictive, widely disseminated to the American
23	public, correct?
24	MR. SNAPP: Objection to form.
95
CONFIDENTIAL
1	THE WITNESS: The message out there
2	regarding cigarettes, again widely disseminated
3	again I think as I've documented in my report is
4	there's no safe cigarette, and issues of addiction
5	certainly are -- you know, information regarding
6	addiction is widely disseminated.
7	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
8	Q. And do you know how widely -- how
9	widely -- how widely -- strike that.
10	Do you know whether or not because
11	information that smoking cigarettes could kill you
12	was so widely disseminated that there was a broad
13	and deep desire to believe that smoking light
14	cigarettes was less likely to kill you?
15	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
16	THE WITNESS: With all due respect, I'm
17	going to have to ask you to repeat that question.
18	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
19	Q. Sure.
20	A. I'm not quite sure what the question is.
21	Q. Sure. Do you know if at the beginning of
22	the class period because information had been so
23	widely disseminated that smoking, for example,
24	Marlboro Reds could kill you that many people in the
CONFIDENTIAL
1	smoking public wanted to believe that
2	Marlboro Lights was less likely to kill you?
3	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: Again, I think, you know,
5	you asked me a question about belief. I can tell
6	you --1 don't know, I can't tell you what people
7	believed. I can tell you that there was plenty of
8	information out there beginning in really the 1950s
9	that argued again from the public health community,
10	from the American Cancer Society, from Surgeon
11	General, reiterated, reinforced in all kinds of ways
12	that smoking was dose-responsive. This actually
13	comes out of St. Louis. It comes out of Missouri,
14	these early, early experiments with tar and painting
15	the shaved bodies of mice with a distillate of tar
16	done at Washington University in Missouri, gets lots
17	of, you know, exposure in the Missouri press, and,
18	you know, from that day forward the Missouri press
19	takes a great interest in these issues I think
20	largely because so much of this early research was
21	done in Missouri, but smoking was dose-responsive.
22	The tar seemed to be the leading culprit in -- you
23	know, a catalyst for diseases, smoking-related
24	diseases, and, you know, from that point on, the
CONFIDENTIAL
1	message again from the public health community, from
2	health organizations, again disseminated through
3	textbooks, et cetera, is that the less tar the
4	better, and that is a message that is, you know,
5	continually, you know, repeated for years and years
6	in this country.
7	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
8	Q. Do you know whether there's internal
9	Philip Morris documents that show that Philip Morris
10	knew that smoking Marlboro Lights was just as risky
11	as smoking Marlboro Reds, or don't you know that?
12	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: As I explained earlier, I
14	did not deal with internal documents because my
15	charge was to discern, to conclude what information
16	was readily available to the public, and internal
17	documents were not readily available to the public.
18	I did not look at Philip Morris documents, internal
19	documents, as I explained earlier, just as I did not
20	look at internal documents from the American Cancer
21	Society or departments of public health.
22	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
23	Q. Now, as a social historian, could have you
24	done the following research, would it have been
CONFIDENTIAL
1	within the scope of your expertise, which the
2	research you've done, okay, exactly what you've
3	done, and then to see -- to research internal
4	Philip Morris documents to see if Philip Morris had
5	manipulated the public and the public health
6	community because they knew more about the health
7	issues relating to light cigarettes than was
8	publicly known? Is that a research assignment you
9	could have done?
10	MR. SNAPP: Objection to the form of the
11	question.
12	THE WITNESS: Given my charge in this
13	case, I would not have -- you know, again, as I'll
14	repeat, I don't look at internal documents because
15	it's a -- I'm looking at publicly-disseminated
16	information. By definition, an internal document is
17	internal. It does not get disseminated to the
18	public. It is not readily available, information
19	that's readily available to the public.
20	So no, for this case, it makes no sense --
21	or for this question, I should say, it makes no
22	sense to do that.
23	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
24	Q. I think we missed each other. I was
99
CONFIDENTIAL
1	asking would it have been within --1 know what you
2	were asked by the lawyers to do. I understand that.
3	My question is, would it have been within
4	the scope of your expertise to not only do the
5	historical research you were asked by Philip Morris
6	lawyers to do but then to take the additional step
7	as a historian and try to decide based on internal
8	public Philip Morris information whether the public
9	awareness message was known by Philip Morris to be
10	false and misleading?
11	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
12	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
13	Q. Would have that been within the scope of
14	your expertise?
15	MR. SNAPP: Same objection.
16	THE WITNESS: No, because again I'm
17	looking at public awareness, again information that
18	is readily available to the public. So internal
19	documents, unless they happened to be disseminated
20	in the public domain, are not relevant.
21	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
22	Q. Okay. Now let me go back to my orphans of
23	my imagination, Exhibits 1 and 2.
24	Okay. And I just want to -- again, I just
100
CONFIDENTIAL
1	want to make clear in my own mind and so that the
2	jury and the judge at trial will understand what
3	you're saying as an expert and what you're not
4	saying, okay, and because -- okay.
5	Let's go to Exhibit 1, and let's do a
6	thought experiment and just strike out "and
7	believed," okay.
8	And so am I correct that public awareness
9	as you used it in your report does not equate with
10	information being actually known by any individual
11	member of the public?
12	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form, asked and
13	answered.
14	THE WITNESS: Again, I cannot tell you
15	what an individual knew, what they believed, what
16	their opinion was, what their perception was. I can
17	tell you as a social historian what information was
18	out there, readily available to the public, widely
19	disseminated, deeply disseminated and reiterated and
20	echoed over a period of time. That's what I can
21	tell you.
22	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
23	Q. Okay. I'm going to start doing -- I'm
24	going to move to strike everything after the first
101
CONFIDENTIAL
1	responsive part of the question.
2	I take it then that -- and again, don't
3	concern yourself with that, Professor. That's just
4	legal mumbo-jumbo.
5	And I take it --
6	MR. SNAPP: For the record, we will oppose
7	any and all motions to strike testimony during the
8	deposition, so go ahead.
9	MR. SURPRENANT: You know, as I was
10	preparing for the deposition, I thought I was going
11	to -- because I thought I might be taking a witness
12	who hadn't been deposed before along, you know, the
13	rules and the regulations, I was going to try a new
14	one to see if I could sneak it by you: You have to
15	agree with whatever I say.
16	MR. SNAPP: That usually doesn't work.
17	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
18	Q. Okay. Let's go to Exhibit 2, and again,
19	based on your last answer, Professor, I know what
20	your answer to this will be, but for my own
21	purposes, I'm aware -- I'm correct, am I not, that
22	public awareness as you have used it in your report
23	does not equate to information being actually known
24	by all members of the public, correct?
102
CONFIDENTIAL
1	A. That's right.
2	(Exhibit 5 was marked for
3	identification.)
4	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
5	Q. And then just to finish this, let me show
6	you what I've marked as Exhibit 5, which is in the
7	same fashion as Exhibits 1 and 2.
8	And I simply have public awareness, it
9	does not equate with information being actually
10	known and believed by any ascertainable percentage
11	of the public, correct?
12	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: Yes.
14	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
15	Q. Okay. Now, are you familiar with a
16	concept in social science called common knowledge?
17	A. Yes, I am.
18	Q. And common knowledge is a state of
19	mutually acknowledged understanding of some fact
20	among some group, correct?
21	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
22	THE WITNESS: I would not define it that
23	specific way.
103
CONFIDENTIAL
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
2	Q. In order to be common knowledge, two
3	facts, two conditions must be fulfilled: Each
4	member of the community must all individually know
5	and understand a fact as true, hence knowledge, and
6	they must know that all other agents in the
7	community also know the fact, hence common, correct?
8	A. No.
9	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
10	(Exhibit 6 was marked for
11	identification.)
12	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
13	Q. Okay. Well, let me mark as Exhibit 6
14	another orphan of my imagination but I cite sources.
15	Exhibit 6 says across the top Scholarly Definition
16	Of, quote, "Common Knowledge." It then has a
17	definition, which recites substantially what I just
18	said, and it offers support, and I do have copies
19	once I find them.
20	Oh, and there's -- yeah, there's a couple
21	of typos that I need to correct. "Is" on the second
22	line should be smaller case. Yeah, "is" in the
23	second line should be smaller case. And I wrote in
24	"acknowledged" on the exhibit. It is -- wait, wait,
104
CONFIDENTIAL
1	wait, I'm sorry, let me go back.
2	Common knowledge, "mutually" on the second
3	line should be small case. "Conditions" in the
4	fourth line should be small case. The
5	auto-correction will get you every time.
6	So Exhibit 6 says common knowledge, quote,
7	"is a state of mutually acknowledged understanding
8	of some fact among some group. A set of individuals
9	must fulfill two conditions to achieve common
10	knowledge. They must all individually know and
11	understand a fact as true, hence knowledge, and they
12	must know that all other agents in the set also know
13	the fact, hence common," and I cite for that to the
14	Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.
15	Are you familiar with the Stanford
16	Encyclopedia of Philosophy?
17	A. No, I'm not a philosopher, so I'm not
18	aware of that.
19	Q. And you'll see, anyone who was interested,
20	you would see when they went to the Stanford
21	Encyclopedia of Philosophy they actually have
22	complex equations defining what I set out here more
23	generally, but it's a very rigorous and specific
24	concept.
105
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Now, that's not the concept that you have
2	in mind when you use public awareness, correct?
3	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
4	If you know, you can answer. I'm not sure
5	where this comes from.
6	Do you have the actual document, the
7	actual --
8	MR. SURPRENANT: This is something I
9	created.
10	MR. SNAPP: Okay. I object to asking
11	questions out of the context of the document.
12	MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. Well, then let me
13	cite an article. We're up to Number 7.
14	(Exhibit 7 was marked for
15	identification.)
16	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
17	Q. I'm citing an article, "Historians'
18	testimony on 'common knowledge' of the risks of
19	tobacco use: a review and analysis of experts
20	testifying on behalf of cigarette manufacturers in
21	civil litigation."
22	And my first question to you, Professor,
23	will be, are you familiar with this research paper
24	by Professor --1 need help on the pronunciation.
106
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Kyriakoudes, Kyriakoudes?
2	A. No, I'm not.
3	Q. Okay. Well, if you turn to the page
4	marked i -- small -- small Roman 110, which is where
5	I cribbed on the first, second -- the third full
6	paragraph.
7	A. I'm sorry, 110?
8	Q. It's VI10.
9	A. Got you.
10	Q. Okay. And if you go to the paragraph that
11	reads, "The definition of common knowledge developed
12	by defense experts is idiosyncratic and not
13	reflected in the scholarly literature," and then it
14	states what I just -- what I quoted, albeit with
15	misspellings, in Exhibit 6, and it cites to
16	footnote 32, and then footnote 32 you'll see
17	includes not only the cite to the Stanford
18	Encyclopedia and to the Milgram article but an
19	additional cite.
20	So is that concept of common knowledge as
21	set forth by Professor Kyriakoudes, I take it that's
22	different than your concept of public awareness?
23	A. Again, yes, based on obviously you
24	don't --1 don't have the time to read this whole
107
CONFIDENTIAL
1	thing. Assuming, again, these things are linked up,
2	and I guess I would really like to read them
3	carefully to be able to comment on them, this is not
4	my definition, no.
5	Q. Okay. And is that Exhibit 7?
6	A. The research paper?
7	Q. Yes.
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. I take it that with that definition of
10	common knowledge, which is not the definition you
11	used, there is probably not a single fact in
12	existence which is common knowledge among smokers of
13	Marlboro Light, is there?
14	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
15	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry, I don't
16	understand the question.
17	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
18	Q. Sure. You've talked about public
19	awareness of information relating to issues around
20	light cigarettes.
21	Using this scholarly definition of common
22	knowledge that I -- that is set forth in Exhibit 6
23	as quoting from Exhibit 7,1 take it that there's no
24	common knowledge among smokers of Marlboro Lights?
108
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Would that be correct?
2	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
3	THE WITNESS: This is not my definition of
4	common knowledge. It's from a philosopher, not a
5	historian, two different disciplines. This is not
6	the definition that I use and have employed in my
7	report.
8	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
9	Q. Well, actually Professor Kyriakoudes is a
10	historian, and he's citing --
11	A. He's citing a philosopher, right?
12	Q. Well, he says common knowledge as a
13	concept is widely used in the social sciences. He
14	does not limit it to philosophy.
15	But in any event --
16	A. But your footnote is from a philosophy
17	encyclopedia.
18	Q. It looks like the article is from
19	Economics, but whatever.
20	A. No.
21	Q. Now, you have no expert opinion at all as
22	to any particular fact about light -- smoking
23	Marlboro Lights and health issues that was known to
24	any smoker of Marlboro Lights, to all smoker of
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Marlboro Lights or any percentage of smokers of
2	Marlboro Light, correct?
3	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
4	question.
5	THE WITNESS: Again, I'll repeat my
6	definition of public awareness.
7	MR. SURPRENANT: We're about ready to run
8	out of tape, so when we return, we will return to
9	this question, I promise you.
10	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Okay. The time is
11	11:55. We are off the record.
12	(Whereupon, a lunch recess was
13	taken.)
14	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Okay. We're back on
15	the record. This is Tape Number 3. The time is
16	3 minutes after 1:00.
17	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
18	Q. Okay. As a social historian -- to be
19	clear, Professor Greenwood, I think this is in
20	various places in your testimony, but I'm trying to
21	just get it in one place, a clear question and
22	answer.
23	As a social historian, you are not able to
24	study or reach conclusions about what the public
CONFIDENTIAL
1	knew and if they knew a fact how they understood it,
2	correct?
3	MR. SNAPP: Objection to form.
4	THE WITNESS: I'm not able to tell you
5	what people believed or what they took away from the
6	information that was available to them.
7	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
8	Q. Okay. Now, is there any discipline that
9	is able to reach reliable scientific conclusions or
10	testable conclusions about what a community knew and
11	believed?
12	A. I don't know.
13	Q. For example, surveys, do you know if
14	surveys are one way to try to get at that question?
15	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
16	THE WITNESS: I mean, surveys and polls
17	can tell you people's opinions and what they
18	believe, you know, at a given moment, give a
19	snapshot view, yes, that's true.
20	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
21	Q. But you I take it as a social historian,
22	if you were given a poll, you could read the poll
23	and understand its conclusions but just like any
24	other lay person? In other words, you don't have
CONFIDENTIAL
1	specialized training that would allow you to say a
2	survey was prepared, the survey instrument was
3	prepared in a reliable fashion, correct?
4	A. I'm not a polling expert, that's correct.
5	Q. Right. And so you couldn't opine on the
6	reliability of any survey?
7	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: I wouldn't feel comfortable
9	doing that, right.
10	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
11	Q. Okay. Now, let's go to your expert
12	report, and you had mentioned that you -- in
13	Exhibit B, you have a reference to a publication
14	that addresses the concept of public awareness; is
15	that correct? You said Tosh and Lang.
16	A. Tosh I think is the author. I don't
17	remember the title, but Tosh and Lang.
18	Q. Do you know where that is?
19	A. Oh boy, I know it's in here. I'll have to
20	look.
21	Q. Is there an organizational principle at
22	work in the reliance list?
23	A. It's by date. It's chronological.
24	Q. Oh, I see, I see. So if you knew the
112
CONFIDENTIAL
1	date, we could go right there. All right. I will
2	look for it.
3	And I take it that the -- is it an article
4	or a book?
5	A. It's a book about historical method, I
6	believe.
7	Oh, here it is, Pursuit of History on
8	Page 81 of the reliance list.
9	Q. The Pursuit of History, Pages 103 to 106?
10	A. And 287 to 89.
11	Q. I see. And when I -- when I put my hands
12	on that book, I will be able -- and those pages, I
13	will be able to see -- are they professors or not?
14	A. Yes, I believe so.
15	Q. What Professors Tosh and Lang say on the
16	topic of public awareness?
17	A. Yeah. I'm not sure they use the exact
18	term public awareness, but the concept is what they
19	talk about. As I mentioned earlier, sometimes
20	historians refer to it as mentalitie, again which
21	goes back to the French historians who, you know,
22	have developed that concept in social history.
23	Q. How would you translate mentalitie?
24	A. I guess most literally like mentality, you
113
CONFIDENTIAL
1	know, kind of the kind of mental universe within
2	which people live and act.
3	Q. Okay. And so in terms of scholarly
4	support for your definition of public awareness,
5	although you don't cite any in your report, in your
6	references you do have this one citation to
7	Professors Tosh and Lang; is that correct?
8	A. Yes, in my reliance list, right.
9	Q. I'm having trouble phrasing the following
10	question, Professor, and so bear with me, but I was
11	a smoker from the late '70s until April 1st, 1988.
12	I smoked a light cigarette, Merit. I have an
13	Associate in Art's Degree from my local junior
14	college, a Bachelor's Degree from a state --
15	Illinois State University, my graduate degree from
16	University of Wisconsin, my law degree. I read a
17	lot, newspapers, magazines. And prior to this case
18	just a few months ago, if you would have said what
19	do you think the relative health risk of
20	Marlboro Lights versus Marlboro Reds, I would have
21	said, well, of course they're less -- I'm sure
22	they're harmful, but they must be less harmful
23	because they're light and that's what light means.
24	Now, given your testimony on public
114
CONFIDENTIAL
1	awareness on the health issues around light
2	cigarettes, am I just an unusually informed --
3	uninformed person despite I went to school for a
4	long time and I read a lot?
5	MR. SNAPP: Objection to form.
6	THE WITNESS: I guess I'm not quite sure
7	what you're asking. Do I as a social historian
8	think you're an uninformed person? As a lay person
9	do I think you're uninformed?
10	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
11	Q. I told you I was having trouble framing
12	it, and the reason it was very arresting to me is as
13	my wife, until yesterday -- until two days ago, who
14	also -- she has more degrees than I do and she reads
15	more than I do, she's smarter than I am, she thought
16	the same thing. She said what other reason could
17	there be for a light cigarette other than to be less
18	harmful?
19	And so now I have a population of two who
20	somehow were completely clueless as to this -- as to
21	this public awareness that you describe in your
22	report.
23	So one might draw the conclusion that my
24	wife and I are unusually uninformed or that public
115
CONFIDENTIAL
1	awareness doesn't track public knowledge or some
2	other explanation.
3	Am I correct that public awareness doesn't
4	necessarily bear any correlation to public
5	knowledge?
6	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form. Object to
7	the preamble.
8	You can answer.
9	THE WITNESS: Again, I think I'll repeat
10	what my definition of public awareness is, and
11	public awareness is based on -- again, it's the
12	information, based on the information that is out
13	there, easily accessible, that is broadcast through
14	a variety of sources and is, you know, reiterated
15	and reinforced over time.
16	The message that less tar is better was
17	part of public awareness, as I say in my report.
18	That's one of the messages that, you know,
19	continually came through really from the 1950s
20	forward from the time of the original mouse painting
21	experiences or experiments that I mentioned earlier
22	where tar was actually painted on, you know, these
23	mice, and tar was considered to be, you know, the
24	culprit as the public health organizations,
116
CONFIDENTIAL
1	community put it, and, you know, disease, perhaps
2	catalyzing diseases. And so the message that came
3	forward from the 1950s on, as I've documented in my
4	report, is less tar is better.
5	Now, the other part of that message was,
6	of course, no cigarette is safe, but from, you know,
7	the 1960s forward, the Surgeon General, the American
8	Cancer Society, other health organizations and, you
9	know, this message again being reiterated in all
10	kinds of ways told people if you're going to smoke
11	switch down, switch down to a low-tar cigarette
12	because less tar is better, but, again, always the
13	message no cigarette is safe and don't change your
14	smoking behavior. Don't smoke more of these. Don't
15	inhale more deeply. Don't puff more often.
16	So that message was out there, and that
17	message was reiterated over and over again by the
18	public health community.
19	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
20	Q. Now, let me see if we can create a
21	hierarchy here, because if you were to ask me what
22	compensation was prior to my being retained in this
23	case, I would have said when a middle-aged man buys
24	a fancy car.
117
CONFIDENTIAL
1	A. One definition.
2	Q. Let me see if I can break that down into
3	pieces.
4	There was you would believe strong public
5	awareness for some period of time, and I'll
6	define -- we will work on the time period, but for
7	some period of time that you studied, there was
8	strong public awareness of the message that if
9	you're a smoker and you won't quit or you can't quit
10	because you're an addict, you should smoke -- you
11	should smoke down, that is go to a lowered-tar and
12	nicotine cigarette.
13	Do I have that much correct? I'm not
14	saying that's the only message, but that was one of
15	the messages.
16	A. I'm sorry, would you repeat that again, I
17	want to make sure I understand --
18	Q. Sure, Mr. Reporter.
19	A. -- completely.
20	(Question read.)
21	THE WITNESS: Yes, I would say the public
22	health community said quite clearly that if you
23	can't quit or you will not quit, you should switch
24	down to a low-tar and nicotine cigarette, but always
118
CONFIDENTIAL
1	be sure that you do not smoke more of them, puff
2	more of them -- puff on them harder, inhale more
3	deeply. But the message again was always it's much
4	better to quit, much better.
5	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
6	Q. Okay. Now, was there a time that you
7	studied, and I'm going to the second half of that
8	answer but always accompanied with don't change how
9	you smoke, that you know is referred to generally as
10	compensation, correct?
11	A. Uh-huh.
12	Q. Now, I'm going to return back to the
13	question asking was there actual broad public
14	awareness about compensation, but I'll return to
15	that.
16	But did there become a time -- did there
17	come a time when this strong public awareness that
18	if you can't quit you should, if you don't smoke
19	don't start because it will kill you, that's a
20	product Philip Morris makes, but if you can't quit
21	because you're an addict, go to a lower tar and
22	nicotine cigarette, did there come a time when that
23	message change?
24	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
119
CONFIDENTIAL
1	THE WITNESS: There were always again lots
2	of, lots of questions about how safe -- safer I
3	should say low-tar cigarettes were. Again, I think
4	that's -- you know, you see this in the 1970s
5	through the Surgeon General's report, which again
6	gets broadcast pretty broadly and deeply. It's
7	reported in newspapers and magazines, fashion
8	magazines, evening news reports, that the Surgeon
9	General said low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes, you
10	know, again, if you can't quit, if you're not able
11	to quit, you're unwilling to quit, it's better to
12	switch down to a low-tar, low-nicotine cigarette.
13	But even at that point in 1972, he in that report
14	talked about the issue of compensation, that that
15	was a danger, and there had been concerns, and again
16	this is clearly evident even in the late '60s,
17	Reader's Digest talks about this a number of times
18	in their -- several articles, in the '70s you get
19	the Surgeon General's report, there's a British
20	study done in '73 that gets reported in the Missouri
21	press, reported in Consumer Reports, reported by
22	Betty Fumess on "The Today Show" saying, look, you
23	know, if you're smoking these things, be careful.
24	People thought, you know, a false sense of security
120
CONFIDENTIAL
1	because people tend to smoke more of them or they
2	inhale more deeply.
3	So again, I think that message is out
4	there. There are increasing scientific studies that
5	support that notion, especially in the 1980s with
6	National Academy of Sciences. Dr. Benowitz did two
7	studies, maybe three in '86 that dealt with those
8	kinds of issues.
9	And again, these are -- these are, you
10	know, not obscure scientific papers. These are
11	studies that get reported, you know, in newspapers
12	and magazines and women's magazines, on evening news
13	shows, so that, you know, concern is out there, yes.
14	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
15	Q. Okay. Let me see if I can -- because I'm
16	not trying to hide the ball from you, Professor.
17	I'm going to get back to the issue of public
18	awareness of compensation, okay, but I have a more
19	modest program at the moment, which is part of the
20	message that you say there was public awareness of
21	was if you can't smoke -- if you can't stop because
22	you're an addict, you should smoke a lowered-tar
23	and -- lower-tar and nicotine cigarette.
24	Did there ever come a time in the period
121
CONFIDENTIAL
1	you studied where that message changed?
2	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
3	THE WITNESS: I think the message that
4	less tar is better does not change, as I say in my
5	report. There are increasing studies, particularly,
6	you know, 70s and '80s, beginning in the '70s and
7	'80s, although there's concern beforehand about
8	compensation, that suggest that if people alter
9	their behavior when they smoke a low-tar or
10	low-nicotine cigarette that the benefits -- that
11	they can nullify the benefits of smoking a lower-tar
12	cigarette. That is the word -- nullify is the word
13	that the Surgeon General actually uses in 1981.
14	So the message is out there, and again,
15	the '81 report is something that gets all kinds of
16	attention in all kinds of sources.
17	By 2001, with the National Cancer
18	Institute's Monograph 13, excuse me, which is really
19	based on again many years of scientific studies,
20	additional studies about low-tar and nicotine
21	cigarettes and the way people smoke them, the
22	conclusion is that risk was not I think the term
23	they used is substantially reduced by the use of
24	low-tar and nicotine cigarettes.
CONFIDENTIAL
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
2	Q. And that would be in 2001, right?
3	A. That was 2001.
4	Q. Okay. So the public health community for
5	a long time, the message was out and public
6	awareness that you're doing yourself a favor,
7	smoker, if you go to a lowered-tar and nicotine
8	cigarette, and by 2001 that message was kind of
9	nullified or changed.
10	How long --
11	A. No, I disagree with that.
12	Q. Okay. Well, let me restate the question.
13	There was broad public awareness for some
14	period of time, according to you as a social
15	historian, that if you're a smoker and you can't
16	quit because you're addicted you should choose a
17	lowered-tar and nicotine cigarette because you will
18	avoid risk, and at some point—
19	A. No.
20	Q. You will avoid some risk, okay. You're
21	shaking your head, so let me withdraw that question.
22	I thought I understood you to say that
23	there was public awareness for some period of time
24	that an addicted smoker who couldn't quit could
CONFIDENTIAL
1	avoid risk, some risk by choosing a lowered-tar and
2	nicotine cigarette so long as that smoker didn't
3	compensate, but at some point in time that message
4	was changed.
5	Did I get that wrong?
6	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
7	THE WITNESS: I don't agree with your
8	characterization of that message.
9	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
10	Q. Okay. Well, let me --
11	A. I don't think that's what I said.
13	What I'm trying to get to is when
14	something -- there's broad public acceptance, the
15	earth is flat, repeated from multiple sources for
16	centuries and forced by the Catholic church, and at
17	some point in time the message begins to come out,
18	you know, the earth is not flat.
19	Does it take time for the former mistaken
20	message that has broad public acceptance, awareness,
21	does it take time for a new message which is
22	actually accurate to replace that former public
23	awareness, as with flat versus spherical earth?
24	MR. SNAPP: Object to form.
CONFIDENTIAL
1	THE WITNESS: Again, in terms of your
2	hypothetical question, you know, I don't know. I
3	would say that the 2001, you know, Monograph 13 from
4	the National Cancer Institute wasn't an
5	earth-shattering new message. I think the message
6	had been out there for many, many years that if --
7	you know, first of all, if you want to, you know,
8	completely eliminate your risk of, you know,
9	tobacco-related disease, quit smoking. You may be
10	able to reduce your risk with a low-tar and nicotine
11	cigarette, but you won't reduce it if -- and you
12	will nullify, again to use the Surgeon General's
13	words he uses in 1981, it gets reported all over the
14	place, as I point out in my report headlined all
15	over Missouri newspapers, if you change your smoking
16	behavior, you will nullify any benefits that you
17	might accrue from using a low-tar cigarette.
18	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
19	Q. So are you telling me --1 thought I
20	understood that at some point the message changed.
21	You're telling me now the message didn't
22	change?
23	A. I don't think it really did change. I
24	think that the concern was always there, that there
CONFIDENTIAL
1	is great risk in smoking anything. There were
2	always concerns again that get repeated in all kinds
3	of ways through various sources that there was no
4	sense of a threshold of what a safe cigarette might
5	look like or a safer cigarette.
6	There are -- you know, I think the message
7	perhaps gets amplified more, and I say I think I
8	talk about --1 think the term I use in my report
9	is, you know, the scientific investigations
10	accelerate I think in the 1980s that actually, you
11	know, provide evidence for these concerns all along
12	that had been there and had been, you know,
13	communicated to the smoking public that, you know,
14	there's risk involved in these cigarettes and
15	especially with issues of compensation, people --
16	you know, this is something, you know, again
17	Reader's Digest talked about back in the '30s, that
18	in a review that they did on filter tips that you
19	could actually -- these external filter tips that
20	you could add to cigarettes, and if you're going to
21	start filtering out some of the stuff in the
22	cigarette, you're going to start puffing harder,
23	you're going to want to suck more of that stuff into
24	your lungs.
126
CONFIDENTIAL
1	So those messages and those concerns have
2	always been out there. I think the science and some
3	of the scientific experiments and widely publicized
4	experiments especially from the '80s forward simply
5	provide more evidence of the problems with low-tar
6	cigarettes that had been, you know, again pointed
7	out very early on by the Surgeon General again as
8	early as 1972.
9	So I don't think the message really
10	changes, and I think that's something I, you know,
11	say pretty clearly in my report and the conclusion.
12	The message does not change. I think the message
13	evolves a bit, but I don't think it changes.
14	Q. Okay. Let me pursue that, but before we
15	do that, I want to address compensation.
16	Like I said, you know, until a few months
17	ago I would have thought compensation meant, you
18	know, men who were getting out of shape and older
19	buying fancy cars. I wouldn't have had a clue about
20	the term compensation or what it meant, not the most
21	remote clue, no knowledge at all.
22	And so again, is -- does that mean that
23	I'm just a really ostrich with a head in the sand
24	despite the fact that my father died from tobacco
127
CONFIDENTIAL
1	products in a very horrible way, I hate tobacco
2	companies, I am alert to public information about
3	the evil of tobacco companies? I would have gone
4	to --1 would have read if I saw an article about
5	how tobacco companies are misleading or cheating
6	people. I am widely read and very much educated.
7	How is it that I had not a clue about
8	compensation until just a few months ago? Is it
9	because I am unusually uninformed, even though I'm
10	interested in the topic, or is it because there is
11	no necessary correlation between what is widely
12	disseminated to the public in your definition of
13	public awareness and what any individual actually
14	knows?
15	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
16	question. It's argumentative. It's compound. It's
17	vague. It's incomplete. It calls for speculation.
18	And I move to strike everything in there from the
19	record.
20	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
21	Q. Okay. Let me re-ask the question.
22	Well, let me ask that question.
23	Do you know what the American Cancer
24	Society reports on how many Americans die each year
128
CONFIDENTIAL
1	from smoking tobacco products?
2	A. Not off the top of my head, no.
3	Q. How about 443,600, does that sound right?
4	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form. It's
5	beyond the scope of her expert report.
6	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
7	Q. And do you know what secondhand smoke is?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. Secondhand smoke is smoke that comes off
10	the tip of the cigarette and is exhaled by the
11	smoker, correct?
12	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: I'm not sure it has to be
14	exhaled, does it?
15	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
16	Q. Okay. Now, are you aware of the American
17	Cancer Society reports that 46,000 nonsmokers a year
18	die from secondhand smoke, Americans?
19	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of that
20	question.
21	THE WITNESS: Again, no, I'm not aware of
22	that. As I've said many times already today, I've
23	been asked to research and draw conclusions about
24	some very, you know, clearly spelled out questions
129
CONFIDENTIAL
1	here, and that is a little bit outside -- not a
2	little bit but it is outside my purview.
3	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
4	Q. Okay. So how would you explain,
5	Professor, the phenomenon that widely read
6	individuals with extensive education and an interest
7	in the topic have no clue at all about compensation
8	when it comes to lowered-tar and nicotine cigarettes
9	despite the fact that according to your expert
10	testimony that information is widely disseminated
11	and it's part of a deep and broad public awareness?
12	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
13	question.
14	THE WITNESS: I cannot speculate why you
15	as an individual believe what you believe, have an
16	opinion about what you believe, act a certain way,
17	behave a certain way based on information that you
18	have access to. Again, that is outside my purview
19	here, my charge as a social historian. I can't tell
20	you about individuals and why they choose to do what
21	they do. It's getting to the realm of the
22	psychological. It's getting into all kinds of
23	realms that again are beyond my expertise as a
24	social historian.
130
CONFIDENTIAL
1	What I can tell you, and I think I've
2	documented it quite well in my report, is that there
3	was a lot of information out there, you know,
4	including newspaper reports, magazine reports,
5	public service announcements about compensation,
6	discussion in all kinds of materials handed out by
7	the American Cancer Society, American Heart
8	Association, American Lung Association, in school
9	textbooks, in smoking cessation programs, in books
10	that people read about smoking. That issue is
11	there, and that's what I can testify to, and
12	those -- you know, it's what I base my conclusions
13	on.
14	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
15	Q. Okay. Let me -- I'm just -- I'm asking
16	you about the concept of public awareness as you
17	have used it.
18	Am I correct that public awareness as you
19	have used it does not bear any necessary correlation
20	at all to public knowledge?
21	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form, asked and
22	answered.
23	THE WITNESS: Again, it's the information.
24	Public awareness is based on the information that is
131
CONFIDENTIAL
1	out there and readily available to anyone, broadly
2	disseminated, deeply disseminated, echoed and
3	reinforced, reiterated.
4	How an individual chooses to take that
5	information, whether they choose to ignore it,
6	whether they choose to act upon it, whether they
7	choose to not believe it or believe it is an
8	entirely different matter, and again, that's -- you
9	know, I can testify to what was out there and what
10	information was available and how broadly it was
11	available to people.
12	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
13	Q. Yeah, I understand that, but that's not my
14	question.
15	Do you think most people in the
16	United States today know that president -- that
17	Barak Obama is the president of the United States?
18	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: I don't know. I mean, you
20	know, there are so many crazy things out there right
21	now I'm not going to speculate what people believe.
22	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
23	Q. Okay. So I used the phrase public
24	knowledge in my last answer -- in my last question,
132
CONFIDENTIAL
1	penultimate question, and let me try to define that
2	and ask questions about how that either connects or
3	doesn't connect to public awareness.
4	I'm going to define public knowledge as a
5	widespread -- a fact that within a community there
6	is widespread acknowledgment that the fact is both
7	known and is true, known and true.
8	Is there -- am I correct that given that
9	definition of public knowledge there is no necessary
10	correlation at all between public awareness as you
11	have used that term and how I have defined public
12	knowledge?
13	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
14	THE WITNESS: As I'm understanding I think
15	what you're saying here is you're defining public
16	knowledge as related to belief, what people believe
17	is true or not true, and I'm saying my definition of
18	public awareness is that it's not about belief.
19	Again, what individuals choose to do with the
20	information that's out there is something, you know,
21	again that I cannot speak to as a historian. I can
22	tell you what information they had access to.
23	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
24	Q. Okay. Let's keep working with this
133
CONFIDENTIAL
1	because I think it's very important.
2	I'm actually -- actually one could break
3	down knowledge and belief as separate; i.e., I am
4	aware that the American Cancer Society reports that
5	smoking kills 443,600 people in the United States
6	every year, but I don't believe it, okay. So I want
7	to take belief out of my question and I'm focused
8	just on the knowledge of a fact.
9	I'm correct, am I not, that public
10	awareness as you have used it bears no necessary
11	correlation for whether any individual member of the
12	public or the public as a whole has knowledge of any
13	particular fact within the scope of information as
14	to which you say there is broad public awareness?
15	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
16	question and to the preamble.
17	MR. SURPRENANT: I think it's a very
18	precise question, albeit a long one, kind of like
19	Samuel Johnson's sentences.
20	If you could reread it.
21	MR. SNAPP: Including the preamble?
22	MR. SURPRENANT: What's the preamble? I
23	like preambles.
24	MR. SNAPP: Go ahead. Just read the whole
134
CONFIDENTIAL
1	thing.
2	(Question read.)
3	MR. SNAPP: Same objections.
4	THE WITNESS: Again, I'm still with all
5	due respect a bit confused by the question.
6	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
7	Q. Let me ask again.
8	A. Okay.
9	Q. I'll ask it differently. I'll use a
10	certain fact as to which you say there is broad
11	public awareness, and that is that if you follow the
12	suggestion of the public health community and smoke
13	a lowered-tar and nicotine cigarette, it's important
14	not to compensate. If you compensate, you're doing
15	yourself no good. Let's define that as a fact, a
16	fact.
17	I am correct, am I not, that public
18	awareness as you have used it bears no necessary
19	correlation whatsoever as to whether any member of
20	the public or the public as a whole actually knew
21	that fact, correct?
22	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: Again, I can't tell you what
24	an individual knew or didn't know, what they
135
CONFIDENTIAL
1	believed, didn't believe, why they acted as they did
2	or how they perceived or acted upon information.
3	I can tell you again that there are lots
4	of messages out there coming from many, many
5	different sources about compensation. Is that
6	knowledge readily available? Yes, it's out there in
7	all kinds of forms. Whether it's a newspaper report
8	or public service announcement or smoking cessation
9	class, American Cancer Society handouts, that
10	information is out there. That's ...
11	MR. SURPRENANT: Move to strike everything
12	after I can tell you.
13	MR. SNAPP: Disagree with the motion to
14	strike.
15	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
16	Q. I'm trying to figure out how to spell
17	correlation. C, is it double R or double O?
18	A. It's two Rs, one O.
19	Q. That always happens to me when I'm
20	cross-examining witnesses. I forget how to spell
21	very simple terms.
22	Okay. Let me mark as Exhibit -- are we up
23	to 8?
CONFIDENTIAL
1	(Exhibit 8 was marked for
2	identification.)
3	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
4	Q. Okay. I have just come up with a
5	super-duper new graphic.
6	"Professor Greenwood's Testimony" is the
7	title. On the left-hand side, it says public
8	awareness with an arrow down to compensation. On
9	the right-hand side, it says public knew,
10	underlined, about compensation, and then I have an
11	arrow from the left to the right with a circle
12	around it and a line going from the upper right to
13	the lower left, meaning not, and then underneath it
14	I have a box that says no necessary correlation.
15	Okay. So I obviously don't have copies.
16	I'd do this on butcher paper if I had butcher paper.
17	So my question, Professor Greenwood, am I
18	correct that while it is your testimony there is
19	wide --
20	A. I'm actually having a hard time seeing
21	this, but thanks.
22	Q. — wide public awareness of compensation
23	that has no necessary correlation to whether or not
24	the public actually knew about compensation; is that
CONFIDENTIAL
1	correct?
2	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
3	Let me just also object to the
4	characterization that this accurately sets out
5	Professor Greenwood's testimony as it states on the
6	top of Exhibit 8.
7	THE WITNESS: I'm not sure I understand
8	your graphics here. I'm sorry.
9	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
10	Q. Sure, and we will work on it.
11	So it is your testimony that there was
12	broad public awareness of the fact that if a smoker
13	smoked a lowered-tar and nicotine cigarette but
14	compensated by smoking more cigarettes, taking more
15	puffs, puffing more deeply, holding the puff in
16	their mouth longer, that there would be no lowered
17	risk? I have that much right, correct? That's your
18	testimony?
19	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: No, I -- I'm sorry, repeat
21	that again because I'm not sure you characterized
22	what I said --
23	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
CONFIDENTIAL
1	A. -- precisely.
2	Q. Okay, sure.
3	I am correct, am I not, that your expert
4	testimony on behalf of Philip Morris is in sum or
5	substance that there was broad public awareness that
6	if a smoker began to smoke lowered-tar and nicotine
7	cigarettes after switching from higher-tar and
8	nicotine cigarettes that there would be no health
9	benefit if the smoker compensated, correct?
10	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: No, I didn't say that
12	exactly. I said that the public health agency
13	from -- officially from 1966 forward and with other,
14	you know, materials and things, especially from 1968
15	forward, told people that if they could not or would
16	not quit smoking, which was the best thing to do to
17	avoid health risk, they should switch down to a
18	low-tar and low-nicotine cigarette. They took the
19	risk of nullifying, again to use the Surgeon
20	General's words, any benefit from switching down to
21	a low-tar cigarette if they smoked more of them, if
22	they inhaled more deeply, if they puffed more often.
23	That's not exactly what you said.
CONFIDENTIAL
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
2	Q. Can we define the behavior you described
3	after they took the risk of nullifying, can we
4	define that behavior as compensation as it is
5	generally defined and understood by public health
6	officials?
7	A. Which behavior again? Could you be more
8	specific?
9	Q. The behavior following they took the risk
10	of nullifying the benefits.
11	Can I go back to the question.
12	A. I'm not sure of the question.
13	Q. Okay. Can we define as compensation,
14	quote-unquote, a defined term, the phenomenon of a
15	smoker who has switched to a low-tar and cigarette
16	if they smoked more, if they inhaled more deeply, if
17	they puffed more often?
18	A. And I would also say if they smoked more
19	of them.
20	Q. Or if they smoked more of them, okay. Can
21	we define that behavior as compensation?
22	A. Yeah.
23	Q. Okay. Now, with that definition of
24	compensation, I am correct, am I not, that whatever
140
CONFIDENTIAL
1	the extent of public awareness of compensation, that
2	has no necessary correlation to whether the public
3	actually knew about compensation, correct?
4	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
5	THE WITNESS: Well, I would say that the
6	public's knowledge is based on the information that
7	they had access to, so there is a correlation. You
8	can't -- their knowledge is based on the information
9	that they, you know -- that is readily available to
10	them.
11	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
12	Q. Are you now testifying that you as a
13	social historian can say what the public knew?
14	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
15	THE WITNESS: No, I'm not saying that, but
16	I'm saying knowledge is based on information that's
17	available.
18	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
19	Q. Okay.
20	A. I can tell you what information is
21	available out there. What people chose to do with
22	that knowledge -- or that information I should say,
23	what people chose to do with that information again
24	is beyond the realm of my expertise. They can deny
141
CONFIDENTIAL
1	it. They can act on it. They can, you know, throw
2	it out the window and say it's ridiculous, I'm not
3	going to let the facts get in the way, you know.
4	There are all kinds of ways that people respond to
5	information.
6	Again, that's getting into behavioral
7	issues, psychological issues, again what I feel is
8	beyond my expertise as a historian.
9	Q. Yeah, but I'm not talking now about
10	belief. I'm talking about knowing, know, knew,
11	okay.
12	You are not able to say whether 1 percent
13	of the public knew about compensation, whether
14	99 percent of the public knew about compensation or
15	any percentage in between, correct?
16	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
17	THE WITNESS: Yes, I would - you're
18	right. I would not quantify in that way. I think,
19	you know, again, as a social historian, what I have
20	done is to document the information that was readily
21	available to the public, easily accessible through a
22	variety of sources, reiterated, echoed, reinforced
23	over a long period of time. I can tell you that.
24	MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. Move to strike
142
CONFIDENTIAL
1	everything after as a social historian.
2	Now --
3	MR. SNAPP: We, as I stated earlier, we
4	don't agree to any of your motions to strike, and we
5	will resist them when they are brought at an
6	appropriate time.
7	MR. SURPRENANT: Yeah, and obviously, you
8	know, we know how it goes.
9	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
10	Q. And so pursuing that line of questioning,
11	if I were to say to you, Professor Greenwood, I read
12	a lot, gone to school a long time, until this case,
13	I started working on this case in early 2010,1
14	never heard about compensation as used in the
15	fashion we have defined it, how can it possibly be
16	given your testimony on public awareness --1 take
17	it your testimony would be, Mr. Surprenant, it's not
18	surprising at all, I'm not saying what 1 percent or
19	99 percent or any percentage of the public actually
20	knew on that topic, correct?
21	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
22	THE WITNESS: I think I did say that, that
23	I'm not saying, I'm not quantifying and designating
24	a percentage of the public, you know, that knew any
143
CONFIDENTIAL
1	given information. What I am saying and what I have
2	set out in my report is the information that was out
3	there and readily available to people through a
4	variety of sources over a long period of time.
5	MR. SURPRENANT: Now, move to strike after
6	what I'm saying.
7	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
8	Q. Now, don't you think --
9	MR. SNAPP: Again-
10	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
11	Q. — there's widespread public acceptance, I
12	won't say awareness, acceptance of the notion that
13	when you're talking about light products like light
14	beer or light cigarettes or Diet Coke, a light
15	product has less of the bad stuff? Do you have any
16	point of view on how widely that is publicly
17	accepted?
18	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: And as a social historian, I
20	do not deal with perceptions, and that's what you're
21	asking me to answer, so no, I don't.
22	MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. So let me go on to
23	the next exhibit, which I will mark as Exhibit 9.
144
CONFIDENTIAL
1	(Exhibit 9 was marked for
2	identification.)
3	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
4	Q. And this is a document that I prepared on
5	the plane yesterday, and I put Professor Greenwood's
6	Report. I'm not saying you agree with me. I'm
7	going to try to in my examination try to figure out
8	the extent to which we agree, if I can find my
9	particular version of this document.
10	Okay. This says Professor Greenwood's
11	Report, the, quote, historical method, 1,
12	identification of research questions; 2, search out
13	a wide variety of sources to answer the questions as
14	fully and as -- and with as much complexity as
15	possible; 3, review and analyze sources for reached
16	conclusions.
17	On the right-hand side, it says performed
18	by and under identification of research questions it
19	says Philip Morris lawyers, and under search out a
20	wide variety of sources to answer the questions
21	fully and with as much complexity as possible, it
22	says some provided by Philip Morris, it should say
23	lawyers.
24	So if you'll hand that back to me, I'll
145
CONFIDENTIAL
1	write in lawyers.
2	So what I want to do, Professor Greenwood,
3	is take through this chart which I wrote which you
4	did not write but which I think accurately reflects
5	your testimony thus far, and that's what I'm going
6	to be pursuing.
7	Now, am I correct that as you have used it
8	and discussed it in your report, the first step of
9	the historical method is the identification of
10	research questions?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. And am I correct that in this case that
13	work was done by the Philip Morris lawyers?
14	A. I'm not sure what you mean by that work
15	was done. I was asked to research, as I point out
16	in my report, two very specific historical
17	questions.
18	Q. And so what -- so the Philip Morris
19	lawyers identified the research questions they
20	wanted you to answer, correct?
21	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
22	THE WITNESS: They asked me to, as my
23	report explains, research again the information that
24	was available to citizens of Missouri regarding
146
CONFIDENTIAL
1	light cigarettes and, you know, what public
2	awareness of light cigarettes was in the state of
3	Missouri.
4	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
5	Q. Okay.
6	A. So they charged me with seeking out the
7	answers to those questions.
8	Q. And then under A, am I correct that the
9	historical method as you have used it for Step 2 is
10	to search out a wide variety of sources to answer
11	the questions as fully and with as much complexity
12	as possible, some of that is a direct quote, it is
13	meant to be a summary of your discussion of Step 2.
14	Would you agree that that's the second
15	step of the historical method?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. Okay. Now, there I wrote under performed
18	by, I wrote some provided by Philip Morris lawyers.
19	Is that accurate?
20	A. Again, I think I explained earlier today
21	that I worked most directly -- when I first got
22	started, I was asked to work as an expert witness
23	with Johnson, Tyler & Purvis, you know, on
24	particular cases. I had asked them for, you know,
147
CONFIDENTIAL
1	newspaper collections that they had done, if any,
2	and I did a lot of that on my own.
3	So it's a little misleading I think to say
4	provided by Philip Morris lawyers, but ...
5	Q. Well, isn't -- isn't Ms. Tyler of
6	Johnson Tyler Purvis a Philip Morris lawyer, a
7	lawyer who represents Philip Morris?
8	A. I don't know the technical relationship
9	that she has with Philip Morris. I know that again
10	she approached me about doing some research on
11	particular cases.
12	Q. Did you understand that she was doing that
13	on behalf of Philip Morris, who was her client?
14	A. I understood that I would be working on
15	cases that had been brought against Philip Morris.
16	Q. And you understood Ms. Tyler and her law
17	firm were representing Philip Morris in those cases
18	where they had been sued, correct?
19	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
20	If you know. She has already said she
21	doesn't know.
22	THE WITNESS: Again, you know, the
23	relationship between that firm and Philip Morris, I
24	mean, I knew that, you know, these cases were being
148
CONFIDENTIAL
1	brought against Philip Morris and that I'd been
2	asked by Johnson, Tyler & Purvis to do some
3	historical research for them.
4	So again, provided by Philip Morris
5	lawyers I guess just doesn't quite accurate to me,
6	but...
7	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
8	Q. Provided -- well, I'm trying to figure it
9	out.
10	Provided by lawyers on behalf of
11	Philip Morris?
12	MR. SNAPP: Is there a question?
13	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
14	Q. Would that -- would that capture what
15	happened?
16	MR. SNAPP: You can answer, if you know.
17	THE WITNESS: Yeah, I'm not sure I can
18	really answer that.
19	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
20	Q. Have you ever been -- have you ever filed
21	a report, an expert report in a case on behalf of
22	Philip Morris where the firm Johnson, Tyler & Purvis
23	was on the expert report paper, where that name was
24	on the report that your report was filed under?
149
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Strike that. Let me ask a new question.
2	Are you telling -- is it your testimony
3	that you don't know whether in your work that you've
4	done for Philip Morris in conjunction with the
5	Johnson, Tyler & Purvis firm, you did not know, it
6	was not your understanding that the Johnson,
7	Tyler & Purvis firm represented Philip Morris?
8	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
9	THE WITNESS: No, I'm not saying that.
10	You know, I wasn't -- I'm not sure who else Johnson,
11	Tyler & Purvis represented. Again, you know, my
12	relationship was directly with them when I was doing
13	this research, so that's all I'm saying.
14	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
15	Q. Well, I'm just trying to figure out how to
16	get this sentence right because I'd understood your
17	testimony, Professor, that some of the material,
18	some of the sources that you used to answer the
19	research question was provided to you on behalf of
20	Philip Morris by lawyers.
21	Do I have that much right?
22	A. I asked Johnson, Tyler & Purvis for any
23	information, for collections that they had when I
24	began my research process that I have added to and
CONFIDENTIAL
1	double-checked, et cetera, from that time, so I got
2	it from Johnson, Tyler & Purvis, not directly from,
3	you know, Philip Morris USA lawyers. I guess that's
4	my quibble here.
5	Q. Well, I'm not suggesting that the lawyers
6	for Johnson, Tyler & Purvis, in particular
7	Julia Tyler, are in-house attorneys for
8	Philip Morris. I know they're not.
9	When I say Philip Morris lawyers, I mean
10	lawyers representing Philip Morris.
11	A. Okay. Well, that's true.
12	Q. Okay.
13	A. I didn't see that distinction on this
14	paper.
15	Q. Okay.
16	MR. SNAPP: We've been going about an
17	hour, so when we can, can we take a break?
18	MR. SURPRENANT: I'm just going to--
19	okay.
20	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
21	Q. Some provided by lawyers representing
22	Philip Morris.
23	Would that accurately capture where some
24	of the sources that you used to answer the research
CONFIDENTIAL
1	questions came from?
2	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
3	THE WITNESS: I asked Johnson,
4	Tyler & Purvis for particularly for microfilm,
5	newspaper microfilm collections that they had
6	gathered over the years.
7	MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. Let's take a
8	break.
9	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Okay. The time is
10	4 minutes after 2:00. We are off the record.
11	(Whereupon, a short recess was
12	taken.)
13	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Okay. We are back on
14	the record. This is Tape Number 4. The time is
15	2:26.
16	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
17	Q. And at the time you asked the lawyers from
18	Johnson, Tyler & Purvis for that information, you
19	knew they were representing Philip Morris in
20	litigation, correct?
21	A. Yes, I did know that.
22	Q. And they provided you information?
23	A. I asked them for some information.
24	May I just say though that in terms of the
CONFIDENTIAL
1	information that I asked for from Johnson,
2	Tyler & Purvis, in terms of my report on, you know,
3	the Craft case, I would estimate that what I asked
4	for and received from them makes up maybe 10 to
5	15 percent of all the research that I've done.
6	Q. Okay. Now, other than--
7	A. I don't have the -- I'm sorry, the last
8	exhibit, I don't have that in front of me.
9	MR. SNAPP: You're asking more questions
10	from the last exhibit?
11	MR. SURPRENANT: No, but the witness--1
12	will and the witness wants it.
13	THE WITNESS: Okay, thanks.
14	MR. SNAPP: Number 9 was the last one?
15	MR. SURPRENANT: Number 9.
16	THE WITNESS: Right.
17	MR. SURPRENANT: Number 9, Number 9.
18	THE WITNESS: Okay, sorry, thanks.
19	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
20	Q. Okay. Now, and then subsequently you
21	asked the lawyers for Johnson, Tyler & Purvis for
22	some information from national magazines, and they
23	gave you some, correct?
24	A. They gave me some, yes.
153
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Q. Now, at any later date, have you asked
2	lawyers who you knew were representing Philip Morris
3	to provide you additional information?
4	A. I don't believe so.
5	Q. Okay. Now, looking at Exhibit Number 9,
6	the third step is to -- of the historical method as
7	used in your report is to review and analyze
8	sources, correct?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. Now, did you do that 100 percent by
11	yourself, or were you assisted in whole or in part
12	by anyone else?
13	A. I did that entirely by myself.
14	Q. Okay.
15	A. And again, if I may, just to go back, just
16	to clarify my research in Step 2, again, a small
17	percentage of that information from Johnson,
18	Tyler & Purvis, but, you know, I also went to
19	Missouri and, you know, researched out there and at
20	the State Historical Society of Missouri, at
21	University of Missouri Columbia at the Health
22	Sciences Library, at the University of Missouri and
23	at the University of Missouri Kansas City.
24	So again, I just want to, you know, again
154
CONFIDENTIAL
1	place your questions within the broader context of
2	all of my research --
3	Q. Sure. That's fine.
4	A. -- so that's clear.
5	Q. Did you visit the Arch when you were out
6	there?
7	A. I wasn't in St. Louis. I was in Columbia
8	and Kansas City.
9	Q. I highly recommend it.
10	A. But I have been there actually.
11	Q. It's just fantastic. It's very kinetic.
12	It seems to move as you move.
13	Now, earlier we were talking about
14	archives and tobacco archives and your searching for
15	some archives but not searching the tobacco
16	archives.
17	And as I understand it, the reason you
18	didn't search the tobacco archives is that you were
19	not -- looking not for internal documents but for
20	documents that were generally available to the
21	public; is that correct?
22	A. Yes, I was looking for information that
23	was disseminated to the public.
24	Q. And one, one aspect, for example, would
155
CONFIDENTIAL
1	be, you know, something as hard to find as a
2	transcript from radio shows in the '50s and '60s and
3	'70s and '80s.
4	You'd be interested in material like that,
5	right?
6	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
7	THE WITNESS: If - I guess it would
8	depend on the transcript. I'm not sure what the
9	question is. Would I be interested in that kind of
10	information?
11	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
12	Q. If you were interested in learning what
13	information was widely disseminated to the public on
14	the topic of smoking, one important source for that
15	could well be transcripts of radio shows in the '30s
16	and '40s and '50s and '60s and '70s, right?
17	A. Yes, on the issue of smoking in general,
18	but again, I want to stress that in this case I was
19	asked specifically to talk about or to research
20	questions, the question of information that was
21	disseminated regarding light cigarettes --
22	Q. Okay.
23	A. -- and the messages that were out there to
24	the people of Missouri.
156
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Q. So then we might be looking at things
2	like -- strike that.
3	But how do -- there's an archive called
4	tobaccodocuments.org.
5	Are you aware of that?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Okay. Have you ever -- have you done --
8	have you searched on tobaccodocuments.org?
9	A. That's a good question. I may have very
10	early on in my research.
11	Q. Now --
12	A. I didn't use anything from -- just to
13	clarify, I didn't use anything from that archive on
14	this particular case.
15	Q. Now, do you know what that archive is, the
16	tobaccodocuments.org archive?
17	A. If I'm remembering correctly, it's the one
18	that comes out of the University of California
19	San Francisco.
20	Q. Are you aware that there was a settlement
21	in 1998 between a number, a large number of the
22	States' Attorneys General and a number of tobacco
23	companies, question mark? Are you aware of that?
24	A. Yes.
157
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Q. And are you aware that as part of that
2	settlement they created an archive of documents?
3	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: I'm not sure I knew that
5	that archive came out of that settlement, but I knew
6	that there were things like that that came out of
7	the settlement.
8	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
9	Q. And have you searched -- under whatever
10	name, did you make a decision, a conscious decision
11	that you would not search the archives that came out
12	of that settlement?
13	A. No, I don't believe I made a conscious
14	decision not to look at them.
15	Q. But you haven't looked at them?
16	A. I think as I said early on I do recall
17	looking at some things at that site, but ...
18	Q. Okay. Okay. If we could go to your
19	expert report, Page --
20	A. I'm sorry, can I just say -- may I go back
21	to a previous line of questioning?
22	Q. Sure, Professor. Let me tell you
23	something I should have told you before, which is
24	feel free at any point in the deposition, including
158
CONFIDENTIAL
1	if we continue tomorrow, which I think it is likely
2	we will in the morning, if you think you need to
3	amplify or correct or modify or place into context
4	any of your prior testimony, please feel free to
5	call that out to my attention, and then you can add
6	whatever you want, though usually I like to do it
7	with questions.
8	You have now indicated that there's an
9	area of your prior testimony you want to return to;
10	is that correct?
11	A. I'd just like to discuss point 1 on your
12	chart, Professor Greenwood's Report, again to just I
13	feel like amplify and contextualize a little bit if
14	I may.
15	Q. Sure.
16	A. You know, your chart here that at point 1
17	of the historical method is identification of
18	research questions, and you say and then on the
19	right-hand column performed by Philip Morris'
20	lawyers. Again, I just want to stress and, you
21	know, be as clear as possible that I was charged
22	with researching two particular questions again
23	which I set out in my report. Again, as an
24	historian and as someone who teaches historical
159
CONFIDENTIAL
1	method to graduate students and others, I, you know,
2	felt that those were good research questions.
3	If I'd felt they weren't good research
4	questions, I certainly would have, you know, changed
5	them or otherwise, but to me they were good, solid,
6	open-ended kinds of research questions that did not
7	incorporate any, you know, particular bias, did not,
8	you know, kind of predispose the conclusions in the
9	way they were stated.
10	So I just want to make that point, that I
11	thought they were sound historical questions.
12	Q. Sure.
13	A. Okay. Thanks.
14	Q. So let's in fact go there now, go to the
15	questions at Page 3 of your report.
16	"As a professional historian and expert
17	witness in this case," I'm quoting now, "I have been
18	asked to focus my research on the following
19	questions: One, what information was disseminated
20	to the public, specifically to citizens in Missouri,
21	regarding cigarettes described as light -- quote,
22	light, closed quote, low-tar, low-yield and ultra
23	light, collectively low-tar, end quotes; two, what
24	was public awareness in Missouri, if any, about
160
CONFIDENTIAL
1	cigarettes described as low tar?"
2	I take it I correctly read your questions,
3	correct?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. And those questions were provided to you
6	by whom?
7	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: I was charged as an expert
9	witness when I was approached by attorneys from
10	Arnold & Porter with this particular task of
11	answering these questions again based on my
12	expertise.
13	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
14	Q. Okay. And you were not asked, I take it,
15	what information was disseminated to the public
16	regarding cigarettes described as, quote, lowered
17	tar and nicotine, correct?
18	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: My understanding is that
20	that would fall, the cigarettes would fall under,
21	you know, the definitions in point 1.
22	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
23	Q. Well, the phrase "lowered tar and
24	nicotine," quote-unquote, is not specifically in
161
CONFIDENTIAL
1	your research question, right?
2	A. Well, it's implicitly there I think.
3	Q. Okay. How about Marlboro Lights, again,
4	that's not specifically in there, but you believe in
5	sum or substance it's captured in the word "light"?
6	A. Well, Marlboro Lights would be in that
7	category of light, low-tar cigarettes, yes.
8	Q. Okay. Now, do you know on a Marlboro
9	package what it says about low-tar?
10	A. On the package?
11	Q. On the Marlboro Light package, right.
12	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form. Is there
13	a time period?
14	THE WITNESS: Yeah, I'm not sure when
15	you're talking about or did I see an ad or --
16	(Exhibit 10 was marked for
17	identification.)
18	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
19	Q. Yeah, let me show you a photograph I've
20	marked as Exhibit 10, and I'm sorry, I don't have
21	copies, and it's just the Marlboro Light box. It
22	says filtered cigarettes and it has the
23	Philip Morris logo, it says Marlboro Lights, and
24	then it says lowered tar and nicotine.
162
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Do you know if that is the Marlboro Light
2	package that was used at any point that you studied?
3	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: Again, my charge as an
5	expert witness was to look at information that's
6	disseminated. I didn't examine particular packages
7	from any particular time period.
8	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
9	Q. You have no expert opinion on how any
10	member of the class interpreted lowered tar and
11	nicotine, correct?
12	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: Again, I don't have an
14	opinion, an expert opinion about interpretation,
15	perception, belief. I do have an expert opinion
16	about the information that was readily available to
17	people in Missouri regarding light cigarettes.
18	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
19	Q. Now, do you have any -- it says lowered
20	tar and nicotine.
21	What do you understand that assertion to
22	mean?
23	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
24	THE WITNESS: Again, are you asking me as
CONFIDENTIAL
1	an expert witness in this case, as a social
2	historian what I think it means, or as a lay person
3	who saw this, is seeing this for the first time?
4	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
5	Q. Well, let's reverse that and I'll ask both
6	questions.
7	Just as a highly educated reader and
8	writer of the English language, do you have an
9	understanding of what the phrase in the box there
10	"lowered tar and nicotine" means?
11	A. That the tar and nicotine has been reduced
12	in this cigarette.
13	Q. Okay. And do you have any understanding
14	as a reader of the English language and writer of
15	the English language -- and I have to tell you I
16	think some of your publications really look
17	interesting. I think I'll read some of them.
18	A. Thanks.
19	Q. Have you studied the Underground Railroad?
20	A. Yes, to some degree. I'm not an expert in
21	it, but it certainly comes up in my teaching, yeah.
22	Q. On a break I'll tell you a funny story
23	about the Underground Railroad.
24	As a reader and writer of English, do you
CONFIDENTIAL
1	have an understanding of the phrase
2	"Marlboro Lights" as it appears on that package?
3	A. Again, I guess I'm a little uncomfortable
4	here whether you're asking me as an expert witness,
5	which is why I'm here, you know, to talk about, you
6	know, my work as an expert witness or as a lay
7	person reading this.
8	Q. Why don't I ask it as a lay person, and
9	then I'll go back as to an expert on both the phrase
10	and the brand name.
11	So with that, what is your just
12	understanding as a reader of English of the phrase
13	"Marlboro Lights"?
14	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
15	THE WITNESS: Just as a lay person?
16	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
17	Q. Yeah.
18	A. That it's a low-yield cigarette.
19	Q. Okay. Now, what is your understanding as
20	an expert social historian about the phrase "lowered
21	tar and nicotine" ?
22	A. Again, placing it within the broader
23	historical context which I've studied, you know, as
24	I mentioned earlier beginning really in the 19 —
CONFIDENTIAL
1	from the 1950s forward, the health community,
2	Congress, health organizations really advocating for
3	cigarettes are with a lower tar and nicotine. They
4	did that in all kinds of ways as I've documented in
5	my report because, again, they believed that tar was
6	the leading culprit in cigarette-smoking related
7	diseases, and there was a great push especially from
8	1964 forward after the Surgeon General's report for
9	lower-yield cigarettes, with tar and nicotine
10	reduced in cigarettes.
11	Q. What is your understanding of the brand
12	name "Marlboro Lights" as a social historian?
13	A. I know it's a brand that came out, was
14	made available to the consumer in 1971.
15	Q. Do you know the extent to which
16	Marlboro Lights and light cigarettes as a brand have
17	done since being launched compared to -- their
18	market share compared to regular cigarettes?
19	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: I know newspapers reported
21	pretty regularly on the fact that light -- the
22	share, market share I guess you would call it of
23	light cigarettes as opposed to regulars increased
24	from, you know, the time that they were available to
CONFIDENTIAL
2	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
3	Q. And they've kind of -- they quickly grew
4	to dominate and continue to dominate the market with
5	market shares in excess of 75 percent, correct?
6	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
7	THE WITNESS: Again, I'm not sure of the
8	exact, you know, 75 percent, but I do know that they
9	dominate, and again, that's something that --1 know
10	that because it was in the newspapers.
11	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
12	Q. And have -- have you ever heard of the
13	phrase "a health reassurance cigarette"?
14	A. I don't believe so.
15	Q. Or a health reassurance product?
16	A. No.
17	Q. Does the market share increase of
18	Marlboro Lights in specific and light cigarettes in
19	general since they were launched indicate to you a
20	broad public demand for what was perceived as a less
21	risky or healthier cigarette?
22	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: Again, I'm not a marketing
24	expert, I'm not a consumer behavior expert, and
167
CONFIDENTIAL
1	again, as I said, I do not as an expert feel
2	qualified to talk about perception. I can tell you
3	about the information that was out there about light
4	cigarettes.
5	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
6	Q. Now, the package, it doesn't reference
7	lowered tar and nicotine if you don't compensate,
8	right?
9	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
10	THE WITNESS: No, it doesn't say that on
11	the package, but I would argue that that message was
12	out there in many different forms and echoed and
13	reiterated over many years.
14	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
15	Q. Now, if there was internal Philip Morris
16	research of consumers that indicated consumers
17	understood lowered tar and nicotine to mean better
18	for you without regard to compensation at all, would
19	that be inconsistent or consistent with public
20	awareness of those issues?
21	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
22	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry, would you repeat
23	the question?
24	MR. SURPRENANT: Mr. Reporter.
168
CONFIDENTIAL
1	(Question read.)
2	THE WITNESS: And I would argue that the
3	internal documentation isn't relevant to public
4	awareness.
5	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
6	Q. Right, I understand, I understand.
7	But my question is, if Philip Morris based
8	on their internal consumer research understood that
9	consumers in general would read that package where
10	it says lowered tar and -- lowered tar and nicotine
11	to mean without any reference to compensating
12	behaviors whatsoever that this cigarette is a health
13	reassurance product, it makes me feel better about
14	being a smoker because I think that this cigarette
15	is going to be better for me than a Marlboro Red, if
16	Philip Morris had that understanding, that was a
17	different understanding than you as a social
18	historian believes there was public awareness of,
19	correct?
20	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
21	THE WITNESS: Again, I'm sorry, maybe it's
22	just late in the day, but I'm having trouble
23	understanding what your question is.
24	I do know that nobody in the public health
169
CONFIDENTIAL
1	community, no one, no authors of school textbooks,
2	no authors, writers of pamphlets ever talked about
3	health reassurances. No one ever made the claim
4	that cigarette smoking could be construed by any --
5	in any way as being healthy. In fact, the message
6	is, as I've said already today, that, you know, the
7	best thing to do if you want to reduce the risk is
8	just don't light up your cigarette, you know.
9	That's the only safe cigarette is one that remains
10	unlit. That's the message.
11	I haven't seen the term "health
12	reassurance" in the public domain.
13	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
14	Q. So if Philip Morris understood based on
15	its internal confidential research that in general
16	smokers of Marlboro Light understood the phrase
17	"lowered tar and nicotine" to mean this cigarette
18	makes me feel better about being a smoker because
19	this product is better for me than Marlboro Reds,
20	assuming that's true, Philip Morris had internal
21	knowledge that was inconsistent with
22	publicly-available knowledge that you're familiar
23	with as a social historian, correct?
24	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
170
CONFIDENTIAL
1	THE WITNESS: Again, I don't know what
2	Philip Morris' internal knowledge was. I'm not a
3	corporate historian. I know what the message was in
4	the public domain. I know what messages were out
5	there and available, readily available to the public
6	and to the people of Missouri regarding light
7	cigarettes.
8	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
9	Q. I understood that, Professor Greenwood. I
10	understood that before that answer.
11	But what I'm trying to do is to
12	understand, because you've just told me and you've
13	told me throughout the day that you're an expert in
14	what there was public awareness of vis-a-vis low-tar
15	cigarettes.
16	And so I'm going to ask the court reporter
17	to reread my question, and just to be clear, my
18	question is simply you know and you have reached
19	expert conclusions about what there was public
20	awareness of, and in the question that the court
21	reporter is going to read, I'm simply asking
22	assuming hypothetically that Philip Morris had the
23	understanding that the question identifies, was that
24	understanding different than what there was public
171
CONFIDENTIAL
1	awareness of.
2	Mr. Reporter?
3	(Question read.)
4	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
5	THE WITNESS: Again, I think you're -
6	when you're talking about how people felt, you're
7	getting into areas of belief, a perception.
8	I can tell you again that the message out
9	there and the health community again, you know, was
10	very clear about this beginning with the U.S. Public
11	Health Service in 1966 and repeated again in 1968 in
12	a very widely disseminated pamphlet called If You
13	Must Smoke, which basically said if you must smoke,
14	switch down to a low-tar cigarette, don't inhale
15	deeply, don't puff, don't smoke so many of these,
16	don't smoke it down to the butt because that's where
17	most of the tar is located, again, from, you know,
18	all this -- all this advice reiterated by the
19	American Cancer Society and other organizations that
20	the less tar that you ingest the better, the more
21	reduced risk that you would have, again given if you
22	do not modify your smoking behavior, that's what I
23	can tell you. That's the information that was out
24	there.
172
CONFIDENTIAL
1	What people believed, how they felt about
2	their cigarettes, how smoking made them feel again
3	is beyond my area of expertise, and as a social
4	historian I can't go there.
5	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
6	Q. We missed each other I think,
7	Professor Greenwood.
8	I understand your testimony throughout the
9	day that as a social historian you are not in a
10	position to form expert conclusions and you don't
11	purport to have formed expert conclusions on what
12	the public or any member of the public knew or
13	understood or felt or believed about
14	Marlboro Lights.
15	But I'm asking you in my hypothetical to
16	assume a fact, okay, a fact, and the fact that I'm
17	asking you to assume in the following question is
18	that from the 1970s on, if not earlier,
19	Philip Morris' internal consumer research, not
20	available to the public, was that generally smokers
21	of Marlboro Lights would understand the phrase on
22	the Marlboro Lights box "lowered tar and nicotine"
23	to mean to that -- to the average Marlboro Light
24	smoker I feel better about being a smoker of
173
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Marlboro Lights than Marlboro Reds because this
2	product is better for me than Marlboro Reds, totally
3	without regard to compensation.
4	Assuming that fact is true, they had such
5	research, Philip Morris had information that was
6	different than and inconsistent with the information
7	as to which you believe there was public awareness,
8	correct?
9	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
10	THE WITNESS: Again, I think if the
11	message -- the conclusion is less tar is better,
12	that Marlboro Lights are better for you, again
13	relatively speaking, not better than quitting
14	smoking, than Marlboro Reds, that's what the health
15	community is saying from '66 forward.
16	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
17	Q. Without any -- without any reference at
18	all to compensation, that's what I'm asking.
19	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: Again, what are we
21	referencing in terms of compensation?
22	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
23	Q. You have throughout the day insisted on
24	linking the public health community's message that
174
CONFIDENTIAL
1	if you can't quit smoke lower-tar cigarettes with
2	compensation.
3	I'm saying if Philip Morris knew that
4	light smokers didn't think, care about compensation
5	but believed that the lowered tar and cigarette
6	legend on the box meant this cigarette is better for
7	me, that's information that is different than what
8	the public health community and the public were
9	publicly aware of according to your testimony,
10	correct?
11	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
12	THE WITNESS: Again, I - I'm not quite
13	sure what you're asking here. I -- it's a
14	hypothetical, which I'm not really comfortable
15	answering.
16	Again, I don't know what Philip Morris
17	knew. It's not part of what I'm, you know, here to
18	testify about as an expert witness.
19	And again, I'll tell you, I can tell you,
20	and I have a number of times already, what I know
21	was out there in terms of information, and certainly
22	this, you know, message that the less tar is better
23	is -- was promulgated and disseminated very clearly
24	from 1966 forward and even before that.
175
CONFIDENTIAL
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
2	Q. You mentioned something called a corporate
3	historian.
4	What is a corporate historian? Are there
5	such historians?
6	A. Yes, there are.
7	Q. And what do they specialize in?
8	A. They study corporations, sometimes
9	histories of corporations, you know, corporate
10	structure, you know, how corporations have changed
11	over time.
12	I'm not terribly familiar with the field,
13	but it's probably part of business history.
14	Q. And so Philip Morris if it wanted to could
15	have retained a corporate historian and asked that
16	corporate historian the following question in sum or
17	substance: Mr. Corporate Historian Expert, we want
18	you to form expert conclusions about how what
19	Philip Morris knew about the health issues
20	surrounding Marlboro Lights and lowered tar and
21	nicotine compared to what the public had awareness
22	of.
23	That is something that Philip Morris could
24	have done, correct?
CONFIDENTIAL
1	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: I suppose they could have.
3	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
4	Q. Okay. Now, are you aware of any scholarly
5	criticism published in peer-reviewed journals that
6	concludes that the historical testimony that has
7	been marshaled and provided by Philip Morris and
8	other tobacco companies in litigation is profoundly
9	ahistorical and misleading?
10	A. No, I'm not aware of that.
11	Q. Would an article on that topic be of
12	interest to you?
13	A. Perhaps, not especially relevant to what
14	I'm doing in this case.
15	Q. Well, we have this concept of public
16	awareness, and you've led me to something that's not
17	in your report but it is cited in your reliance, and
18	I'll look at that this evening, but it includes
19	anything derogatory of smoking because of health
20	issues starting with 1604 up to the date of the
21	report no matter how arcane, obscure, forgotten
22	about, correct?
23	A. No.
24	MR. SNAPP: Object.
Ill
CONFIDENTIAL
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
2	Q. Well, let's start with my favorite, you
3	know, "The Counter-Blaste Against Tobacco."
4	I actually knew that about because I know
5	about King James, and I would suggest that the
6	percentage of people who knew about King James
7	Counter-Blaste of Tobacco in the United States is a
8	tiny fraction of 1 percent.
9	Would you agree?
10	A. That's not --
11	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form, calls for
12	speculation.
13	THE WITNESS: Yeah, right, that's not
14	what -- how I used the quote, and that was not the
15	point I was making with the quote. I think you're
16	pulling it out of context and misconstruing its
17	purpose.
18	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
19	Q. Well, Professor, on that topic you and I
20	disagree, but let's pursue it.
21	Do you know when King James ascended to
22	the English throne?
23	A. I'd have to think about that for a second.
24	I'm not a British historian, but let's see. When
CONFIDENTIAL
1	does Elizabeth die? She's around in 1588. Around
2	1600.
3	Q. Okay, 1603.
4	Do you know who his mother was?
5	A. He's a Stewart. He's a Stewart dynasty.
6	I don't -- I'm not a British historian.
7	Q. Mary, Queen of Scots.
8	Do you know if he was King James of any
9	entity other than England?
10	A. No, I don't.
11	Q. He was King James VI of Scotland.
12	So I would -- you're a professional
13	historian, and I would suggest that this examination
14	shows that King James is a pretty obscure figure to
15	most Americans, correct?
16	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
17	THE WITNESS: I don't know. Again, I just
18	want to reiterate why I used that quote, which
19	actually does show up as I suggested before in some
20	textbooks, and interestingly enough it shows up
21	quite a bit in articles that are done about --
22	newspaper articles or feature articles where writers
23	talk about tobacco addiction, and they often, you
24	know, quote this King James' line here about
CONFIDENTIAL
1	tobacco.
2	So that was my point. Again, as I said,
3	it's not that a lot of people are aware of maybe who
4	King James I was or what he said, but my point is
5	that almost from the beginning, it was from the
6	moment that tobacco was introduced to Europeans by
7	Native Americans, there were comments about it
8	being, you know, habit-forming, loathsome
9	as King James puts it, turned people into slaves was
10	another common, you know, kind of discussion,
11	explanation of tobacco.
12	So it was --1 used it for that purpose.
13	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
14	Q. I take it public awareness as you have
15	used it accumulates over time?
16	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
17	THE WITNESS: Well, I'm not sure I'd put
18	it quite that way. I think time is a factor as I
19	explain. I think it's information that gets
20	disseminated over time, and, you know, there are
21	messages, information that gets repeated over, over
22	a long period of time, yes.
23	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
24	Q. Is public awareness cumulative?
180
CONFIDENTIAL
1	I mean, so, for example, public awareness
2	of the evils of smoking start with King James I in
3	1604 and then it kind of grows as that message is
4	repeated from multiple sources, correct?
5	A. It can be cumulative, but I don't think it
6	has to be cumulative.
7	Q. Okay. Well, what you say when you
8	start -- when you're talking about King James,
9	Page 5, "Long before the 1964 Surgeon General's
10	report, the public was aware of the health risks of
11	smoking," and then you quote the quote from
12	King James that we've had.
13	And then you say, "Subsequently, public
14	awareness of tobacco's ill effects expanded over the
15	centuries as tobacco usage grew."
16	Do you see that?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Okay. So--and so public awareness on
19	the evils of smoking, the ill effects of smoking
20	began in 1604 and come forward to the present as the
21	message is repeated and disseminated to the public,
22	correct?
23	A. Yeah, and as additional information is
24	added, you know, is disseminated. As I say here,
181
CONFIDENTIAL
1	you know, especially with scientific evidence from
2	the '50s forward, that is important in, you know,
3	again, in helping to establish that message, right.
4	Q. Okay. If you could -- if you could look
5	at the article that I've marked as Exhibit 7 by
6	Professor Kyriakoudes. I apologize, Professor, I've
7	just butchered your name.
8	And so I want to ask about a specific
9	thing, and I know you've not read this, so if I
10	could direct your attention first to the
11	Roman IV 114 in the upper left-hand comer under the
12	legend What This Paper Adds. And a long time ago
13	when I was back in law school, I wasted my time on
14	the egoistic participation in a law review, and what
15	we would do at the law review is we'd have this long
16	article that nobody in the world cared about, and
17	then we would have in italics a short description of
18	the entire article, and that I think is what's going
19	on here under What This Paper Adds.
20	And so let me give you a brief -- let me
21	read it so you'll see at least what the author or
22	editors of this article thought it added.
23	"What This Paper Adds: Expert testimony
24	by professional historians has played a central role
182
CONFIDENTIAL
1	in tobacco litigation in the last 20 years as
2	questions of the public knowledge, understanding and
3	awareness of the hazards of smoking have become
4	central issues in the tobacco industry's defense in
5	the courtroom. This is the first study to
6	systematically examine that testimony. Its chief
7	findings are that significant portions of the
8	research relied upon by defense historians have been
9	conducted by industry law firms and that the
10	testimony presents a skewed and deceptive history of
11	cigarettes and tobacco in American life."
12	Now, I'm correct that you were unaware of
13	this article until I showed it to you this morning?
14	A. That's right.
15	Q. Okay. Now, on the issue of public
16	awareness, you'll see under Methods on the first
17	page, the author tells us under Methods, "I have
18	identified all deposition and trial testimony
19	transcripts by professional historians serving as,
20	quote-unquote, common knowledge or, quote-unquote,
21	public awareness and tobacco history experts extant
22	in the DATTA database between 1 May and
23	10 August 2004," and then it goes on to discuss his
24	methods.
183
CONFIDENTIAL
1	And so he was examining the very type of
2	testimony you have offered in this case, which is
3	public awareness.
4	And then what I want to do is to describe
5	or quote a part of his research and then see how
6	that compares against the public awareness analysis
7	you have provided in your report. And if you go to
8	a section of the article I identified earlier
9	Roman IV 110, midway through the paragraph that
10	begins "Defense experts' definition of common
11	knowledge," and contextually I think, Professor, it
12	would be fair to say he is including within the
13	rubric common knowledge public awareness, but in any
14	event, what he says, and I'm going to quote the
15	sentence beginning "On a broader level."
16	A. I'm sorry, where are you starting?
17	Q. "On a broader level," which is --
18	A. I don't see that.
19	Q. "On a broader level, by characterizing
20	collective memory and collective knowledge as
21	cumulative, industry experts can pile example upon
22	example of antitobacco health information no matter
23	how remote in historical time, arcane" --
24	MR. SNAPP: Where are you reading from?
184
CONFIDENTIAL
1	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry, I don't see where
2	you're reading from. Where are you starting?
3	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
4	Q. "On a broader level" --
5	A. What paragraph are we in?
6	Q. Defense experts' definition of common
7	knowledge.
8	A. Okay, I see now, all right.
9	Q. "On a broader level," do you see that
10	sentence?
11	A. Yes, I'm good.
12	Q. Okay. Let me start again.
13	"On a broader level, by characterizing
14	collective memory and collective knowledge as
15	cumulative, industry experts can pile example upon
16	example of antitobacco health information no matter
17	how remote in historical time, arcane, divorced from
18	its context, and missing the essential industry
19	disinformation, denials and advertising to give the
20	jury the impression that the public understood the
21	risk of smoking, even when much of the evidence
22	presented consists of long-forgotten, obscure,
23	incorrect or poorly circulated information."
24	Now, I understand that you haven't seen
185
CONFIDENTIAL
1	this article before, but that is the conclusion of
2	Professor Kyriakoudes, and with that in mind, I want
3	to see how your report -- the extent to which your
4	report in addressing public awareness relies on
5	information.
6	Now, you would agree with me --
7	MR. SNAPP: I'm sorry, do you want her to
8	take the time to read the entire article so she can
9	answer the question in context, including all of the
10	article about including the competing interest
11	statement and everything else that's in here?
12	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
13	Q. Oh, sure. Professor Kyriakoudes is one of
14	two historians who have testified against big
15	tobacco, and there's another article by
16	Professor Weiner of the University of California
17	Irvine that was published in The Nation in March of
18	this year that then explains how the law firms
19	represented on the other side of this table and
20	other law firms have then made their lives miserable
21	and have essentially, you know, harassed them. And
22	so, I mean, those are articles, but no, I mean, if
23	you want to -- if you want to read Professor
24	Kyriakoudes' article, I would recommend it to you.
186
CONFIDENTIAL
1	A. Well, I guess I would feel, if I may
2	interject here, uncomfortable, you know, taking --
3	you know, accepting the fact that that is the
4	conclusion that you've picked out here, you know, of
5	this article without me reading, having read it.
6	So I don't feel comfortable commenting on
7	this article or what you see as the conclusion
8	without having read it and come to my own
9	conclusions about what the article is about.
10	Q. Right. And, Professor Greenwood, I would
11	not give you an article you haven't read at the
12	deposition and on the fly ask you expert opinions
13	about that, and if my questioning communicated that,
14	I apologize.
15	But what I'm going to do is -- what I was
16	trying to do is introduce the idea that public
17	awareness as used in your report allows the
18	accumulation of example after example of antitobacco
19	health information even though it doesn't read on,
20	provided us information on what actual human beings
21	actually knew and believed.
22	And so with that limited purpose, and we
23	can put this article aside and forget about it, I
24	want to examine the extent to which public awareness
187
CONFIDENTIAL
1	as you have used it is a concept that allows almost
2	anything to account as an aspect of public awareness
3	and just as a roadmap to where we are going.
4	So the first thing you cite is -- and I
5	promise you, Professor, I promise you I will move on
6	quickly, is you cite King James, and I think it is
7	fair to say, or maybe it's not, do you think there's
8	a fair amount of awareness among the class that
9	King James I of England condemned tobacco smoking in
10	1604 or not?
11	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form and object
12	to the entire colloquy that preceded it, preceded
13	the question.
14	THE WITNESS: As I've said several times
15	this afternoon regarding King James and that quote,
16	it's not my claim that people in the class were
17	aware of this particular document and this quote.
18	My point here, as I think I make very clear in, you
19	know, describing, you know, pulling things out of
20	context I feel, that my point in using the
21	King James quote is that as I've said before from
22	the beginning of the time that tobacco was
23	introduced to Europeans, there were concerns about
24	what it did to people, and I cite that as an
188
CONFIDENTIAL
1	example.
2	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
3	Q. Okay. Let's go then to the next
4	article -- the next paragraph.
5	"By the early 20th century, educators
6	regularly spoke out against the ill effects of
7	smoking, and school textbooks and parenting manuals
8	warned that cigarettes stunted growth, injured the
9	heart, caused shortness of breath and create a host
10	of other health problems. Popular magazines such as
11	Reader's Digest regularly printed articles beginning
12	in the 1920s pointing out the health risks of
13	smoking. Even movies, cartoons and popular songs
14	frequently referenced smoking's ill effects and
15	referred to cigarettes as coffin nails."
16	Okay. Let's see the source for that.
17	William A. McKeever, "Training the Boy," published
18	in New York by Macmillan Company in 1913.
19	I think it's fair to say that that's
20	fairly arcane?
21	MR. SNAPP: Objection to form.
22	THE WITNESS: It's wasn't in 1913. It was
23	actually a very popular parenting manual in 1913.
CONFIDENTIAL
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
2	Q. In terms of what members of the class know
3	or believe, do you believe that William A.
4	McKeever's "Training the Boy" is anything other than
5	arcane and remote?
6	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
7	THE WITNESS: Again, you know, I'll repeat
8	what I said about King James. These are examples
9	again that show that concerns about cigarettes and
10	health were not new and didn't begin in 1964 with
11	the Surgeon General's report, that there has been a
12	long line of criticism almost from the very
13	beginning of, you know, the introduction of tobacco
14	to Europeans that there were health problems
15	associated with it, and that's the point here. And
16	you know, I did use a very popular parenting guide
17	to show that what Americans were thinking, the
18	information they were getting in 1913.
19	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
20	Q. Well, not what they were thinking
21	because --
22	A. No, I should -- no, not what they were
23	thinking, the information that was available to
24	them.
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Q. Okay. Now, interestingly enough,
2	Professor Kyriakoudes, at one point he calls out
3	that other tobacco historians have testified about
4	"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo."
5	So why are you citing "Thirty Seconds Over
6	Tokyo" there, because it refers to cigarettes as
7	coffin nails?
8	A. Yeah, I'd have to go back and review it.
9	It does -- there's something negative about it. I
10	think it does refer to them as coffin nails in
11	"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo."
12	Q. Where did the information in footnote 3
13	come from? Was it--let me ask it more directly.
14	Was some or all of the information in
15	footnote 3 provided to you by lawyers who represent
16	Philip Morris?
17	A. I have to think about that. Some of this
18	information was information that I had asked for
19	from Johnson, Tyler & Purvis but not all of it. I
20	found "Training the Boy," for example. I had, you
21	know, did my research on Reader's Digest. I knew
22	about Tex Williams' song, "Smoke, Smoke, Smoke that
23	Cigarette."
24	Q. Now, there's another scene in "Thirty
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Seconds Over Tokyo," which obviously is a war movie,
2	and it shows a smoker deriving pleasure and
3	relaxation from smoking, i.e., presents smoking in a
4	positive light.
5	Wouldn't it have been fair to put that in
6	there?
7	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: Again, I think that's
9	interpretation. Smoking in a positive light, that's
10	a perception. That's what you take away from it
11	perhaps.
12	But again, as a social historian, you
13	know, I -- it's out of my area of expertise to say
14	what message gets portrayed and, you know, by that
15	image on a screen.
16	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
17	Q. You know, I've recently been rereading for
18	about the third or fourth time Dashiell Hammett's
19	"Maltese Falcon," which was later a movie with
20	Humphrey Bogart playing the title role of Sam Spade,
21	not the title role, the title role is the Maltese
22	Falcon, the role of Sam Spade, and he is always
23	rolling and smoking cigarettes, and Sam Spade is
24	portrayed as a defender of the poor and as a moral
CONFIDENTIAL
1	person, and as someone who has at least a Master's
2	Degree in literature, I'm sure that I could cite
3	scholarly articles saying Sam Spade is portrayed in
4	a positive fashion, not a negative fashion, and you
5	almost want to start rolling a cigarette and smoking
6	as you're reading the book.
7	Why don't we have in here all of the stuff
8	in popular culture that portrayed smoking during
9	this same time period? The reason I'm talking about
10	it, it was published in the '40s. Why isn't that in
11	here?
12	MR. SNAPP: Objection to the form of the
13	question.
14	THE WITNESS: Again, I think, you know,
15	the message that's out there and reiterated over and
16	over is generally one that depicts and talks about
17	coffin nails, depicts smokers as helpless addicts.
18	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
19	Q. I won't repeat this line of questioning
20	with all the cites in here, but again, so that I
21	understand what your testimony is and so we can make
22	sure at trial that the jury doesn't misunderstand
23	it, you are not claiming that any member of the
24	class was familiar with any of the sources cited in
CONFIDENTIAL
1	footnote 3, correct?
2	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
3	question.
4	THE WITNESS: Again, I think I've answered
5	that question several times, but I'll answer it
6	again. I'm again showing -- I'm not talking about
7	individuals and what individuals knew or what they
8	believed. I am documenting the information that was
9	out there in the public domain that gets repeated
10	and re-echoed, reiterated --
11	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
12	Q. Well, but, Professor, to say it was out
13	there --
14	A. -- and readily available, part of my
15	definition.
16	Q. — was the information in footnote --
17	well, footnote 1 is published in Edinburgh, a
18	beautiful city, privately printed in 1854.
19	I take it that that wasn't readily
20	available?
21	MR. SNAPP: You're referring to
22	footnote 2?
23	MR. SURPRENANT: Footnote 2.
24	THE WITNESS: Again, I think you're
194
CONFIDENTIAL
1	pulling things out of context, and I think my
2	evidence needs to be read within the paragraph in
3	which it's embedded. Talking about the '50s, I am
4	talking about information that was out there in the
5	public domain, again readily available, lots of talk
6	about the coffin nails and hopeless, you know,
7	cigarette addicts and Little White Slavers and
8	things like that.
9	My quote about King James I again is used
10	to illustrate the fact, as I've said several times,
11	that people knew smoking was bad for them or tobacco
12	was bad for them almost from the start.
13	So again, I think you need to look at my
14	evidence within -- the context within which it's
15	framed.
16	Is it about time for a break?
17	MR. SURPRENANT: Yes, Professor Greenwood,
18	it's always time for a break when you feel it's time
19	for a break.
20	THE WITNESS: Okay. I say it's time for a
21	break.
22	MR. SURPRENANT: There we go.
23	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 3:24. We
24	are off the record.
195
CONFIDENTIAL
1	(Whereupon, a short recess was
2	taken.)
3	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Okay. We're back on
4	the record. This is Tape Number 5. The time is
5	3:46.
6	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
7	Q. I'm going to get back to my examination of
8	the sources that are cited in your report, but let
9	me take a segue through a variety of quick topics or
10	what I hope to be quick topics before we get there.
11	As a social historian, are you aware of
12	any other products that if used lawfully can kill
13	the consumer?
14	MR. SNAPP: Objection to form.
15	THE WITNESS: No.
16	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
17	Q. Okay. Now, I want to focus on the term
18	public awareness. Obviously it's a term I've asked
19	you a lot of questions about.
20	In the normal parlance, if you were to
21	say, Dominic, are you aware of that President Obama
22	is the president and I would say yes, that means
23	that's a piece of factual knowledge that I have at
24	my command, but that's not how you're using public
196
CONFIDENTIAL
1	awareness, correct?
2	A. Right. I think I've gone over several
3	times what my definition of public awareness is,
4	yeah.
5	Q. So if the lawyers at trial for
6	Philip Morris would say to the jury, look, the
7	public was aware about the health issues surrounding
8	light cigarettes, you heard Professor Greenwood
9	testify that there was widespread public awareness
10	of those issues, that would be -- that would be a
11	misuse of your testimony, correct?
12	MR. SNAPP: Objection to the form of the
13	question.
14	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry, would you repeat
15	that question?
16	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
17	Q. It would be inappropriate and misleading
18	for Philip Morris' lawyers to argue to the jury in
19	this case that your testimony about public awareness
20	means that you have testified as an expert that the
21	public actually knew information relating to the
22	health issues around Marlboro Lights and low-tar
23	cigarettes, correct?
24	MR. SNAPP: Objection to form.
197
CONFIDENTIAL
1	THE WITNESS: Again, I think I've
2	explained the difference between public awareness
3	and knowledge, that knowledge is based on, you know,
4	again public awareness, the information that's
5	disseminated through a variety of sources, broadly,
6	deeply, reiterated over a long period of time.
7	So again, I think that distinction I think
8	I've been trying to make clear. Maybe I haven't,
9	but it is a distinction.
10	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
11	Q. Yeah, and I'm just very concerned that the
12	jury is going to misunderstand awareness by
13	understanding it in its everyday lay term that
14	awareness equals knowledge of a fact.
15	As you have used public awareness, it
16	doesn't equal knowledge of a fact, does it?
17	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: Again, as I've explained it
19	here, I think I'm clear about what my definition is,
20	and I've gone over it a number of times.
21	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
22	Q. I know, and I just want --1 get to ask
23	the questions.
24	Public awareness as you have used it does
198
CONFIDENTIAL
1	not mean that the public was aware of a fact in the
2	sense they knew it, correct?
3	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: Again, I think knowledge is
5	based on the information that's out there. It
6	doesn't mean everybody knows it or everybody
7	believes it or everybody perceives it in the same
8	way. Again, my job was to show what kind of
9	information was available regarding light cigarettes
10	to the people of Missouri.
11	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
12	Q. Now, in terms of public awareness, I asked
13	you a variation of this question but I want to go
14	to -- return to it because it's very important.
15	In your scholarly publications, have you
16	ever used the term public awareness in the way
17	you're doing it here? And I'm referring to that
18	specific term.
19	A. I'd have to go back and check. I don't
20	think I've used the term public awareness, per se,
21	but I've certainly used the concept in the things
22	that I write and the things that I teach.
23	Q. Right. And if I go to that article by
24	Tosh and Lang, that won't use public awareness
199
CONFIDENTIAL
1	either, will it?
2	A. As I said earlier, it's more -- commonly
3	the term used by historians is mentalitie.
4	Q. Okay. But where I have seen public
5	awareness, quote-unquote, used is in Professor
6	Kyriakoudes' testimony --1 mean article, where he
7	talks about other historians using that precise
8	term, public awareness in their testimony in trials.
9	That's the only place I've seen it.
10	So who came up with the term public
11	awareness, you or the lawyers for Philip Morris?
12	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: In the sense that it was,
14	you know, embedded in the question I was asked to
15	research, I was charged by the lawyers to look, you
16	know, to answer that question. Again, public
17	awareness is a concept that as I say in my report is
18	familiar to social historians and something that I
19	employ in my own scholarly work.
20	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
21	Q. Bless you. Yeah, but the concern I have
22	about the phrase -- so I now understand the term
23	public awareness was penned originally by the
24	lawyers for Philip Morris; is that correct?
200
CONFIDENTIAL
1	MR. SNAPP: Object, object to the form.
2	MR. SURPRENANT: Strike that.
3	THE WITNESS: No.
4	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
5	Q. As used in your report, the term public
6	awareness, that was the question the Philip Morris
7	lawyers asked you to answer, correct?
8	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
9	MR. SURPRENANT: Whose phone is ringing?
10	MS. BERNSTEIN-GAETA: It's not mine.
11	THE WITNESS: That's my phone.
12	MS. B ERNSTEIN - G AET A: It's yours?
13	THE WITNESS: Please don't ...
14	MR. SURPRENANT: Mr. Court Reporter, could
15	we have that question reread.
16	(Question read.)
17	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: Again, I was asked to
19	research these questions. But public awareness,
20	again, I'll just reiterate, is a concept that I
21	teach, I use in my own scholarly research, so to me
22	it wasn't something made up by the lawyers.
23	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
24	Q. I understand that in sum or substance you
201
CONFIDENTIAL
1	as a social historian may talk about information
2	that is widely disseminated to the public and that
3	is echoed and kind of reinforced from a number of
4	sources. I understand that may be a useful concept
5	for a social historian, and it may be a concept that
6	is widely understood among social historians.
7	But I take it you have never before
8	referred to that concept in a published article as
9	public awareness, correct?
10	A. Again, I'd have to go back and look at my
11	own, my own scholarly publications, but I may not
12	have used that particular term, but again, I
13	certainly used the concept.
14	Q. Right. And the one published support that
15	you have identified for public awareness, which is a
16	name that I forget as soon as I say it every time I
17	say it, Tosh and Lang, they also don't refer to it
18	as public awareness?
19	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: They incorporate that
21	concept in their notion of mentalitie.
22	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
23	Q. Right. But -- and I'm going to look on
24	line tonight, but I'm virtually sure that when I
202
CONFIDENTIAL
1	find the definition of aware or awareness, it is
2	going to be defined as having knowledge of a fact,
3	and that's not how you're using it, correct?
4	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
5	THE WITNESS: Again, I think I'm very
6	clear about how I'm defining public awareness here
7	about the information that's available. What -- if
8	people choose to accept that information as a fact,
9	if they choose to reject it, again, I think that's a
10	whole other area which I will repeat I don't feel
11	like I can go into that area as a social historian.
12	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
13	Q. But it's not only whether they choose to
14	understand or believe it or they reject it; it's
15	whether the threshold matter, it even gets their
16	attention, that it becomes a part of their knowledge
17	base that this assertion is being made in the world
18	even if they reject it. Awareness also doesn't
19	include just that perception by a member of the
20	public that the assertion of this fact is being
21	made, correct?
22	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: Again, there are a couple of
24	questions in there. I'm not sure exactly what
203
CONFIDENTIAL
1	you're asking.
2	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
3	Q. Let me simplify.
4	Public awareness as you have used it does
5	not only not address whether a member of the public
6	rejects or chooses to believe a certain fact; it
7	also includes the threshold question of whether a
8	member of the public even knows that that fact is
9	reported to be -- to exist at all, correct?
10	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: I'm not sure what you mean
12	by threshold.
13	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
14	Q. Sure. It might be the case that, though I
15	have to tell you I think it's exceedingly remote,
16	that a member of the class said, boy, there is all
17	this information out there about compensation, but
18	I'm not going to choose to believe it -- strike
19	that.
20	To illustrate the point of threshold, it
21	could be the case that a member of the class was
22	aware of claims being made about compensation as we
23	have defined it and chose not to believe them. It
24	could also be the case that any individual member of
CONFIDENTIAL
1	the class or every single member of the class may
2	not even have known about the concept of
3	compensation, correct?
4	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
5	THE WITNESS: Again, I think there are two
6	questions in there. I'm not sure which ones you're
7	asking me to answer.
8	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
9	Q. Professor, I think there's only one.
10	A. I heard two, but it's late in the day.
11	MR. SURPRENANT: Let's see. We will go to
12	the videotape.
13	Mr. Reporter, could you read that, please,
14	beginning with "to illustrate."
15	(Record read.)
16	THE WITNESS: Again, I think I'm not
17	talking about individual belief. I'm not talking
18	about individual knowledge. I want to stress again
19	that knowledge is based on the information that's
20	readily available to people, but awareness and
21	knowledge are not one and the same thing.
22	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
23	Q. Well, awareness and knowledge as you have
24	used the term public --
CONFIDENTIAL
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. — awareness, because in the rest of life
3	awareness and knowledge may well be equated, right?
4	A. I don't know.
5	MR. SNAPP: Object. Object to the form.
6	THE WITNESS: I don't know if that's true.
7	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
8	Q. Now, do you know if the reason that the
9	Philip Morris lawyers used the phrase public
10	awareness is because --
11	A. I'm sorry. Let's turn that off.
12	MS. B ERNSTEIN - G AET A: Let's go off the
13	record for five minutes.
14	MR. SURPRENANT: Sure.
15	THE WITNESS: Turn that off.
16	MR. SURPRENANT: It may be important.
17	THE WITNESS: Yeah, maybe. I'm sorry.
18	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: It's 4:00 p.m. We're
19	off the record.
20	(Whereupon, a short recess was
21	taken.)
22	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Okay. We're back on
23	the record. The time is 2 minutes after 4:00.
CONFIDENTIAL
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
2	Q. Now, are you aware that Philip Morris'
3	lawyers in past cases have argued to the jury that
4	Philip Morris can't be liable to the smokers because
5	the smokers were aware or should have been aware of
6	the harms of smoking? Are you aware of that?
7	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: I don't know what
9	Philip Morris has done in the courtroom. Again,
10	I'm ...
11	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
12	Q. Okay. Can you think of a term for,
13	quote-unquote, public awareness that you have used
14	that wouldn't be as prone to being misunderstood as
15	the term public awareness since public awareness as
16	you use it awareness does not equate with knowledge
17	where in the normal, everyday definition of
18	awareness it does equate with knowledge?
19	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: Again, I think you've made a
21	statement in there about my definition that I don't
22	agree with, that it's misleading. I don't think
23	it's misleading. I think I'm very clear about how
24	I'm defining it, and I think a jury could understand
CONFIDENTIAL
1	this very clearly.
2	But I have used what I believe is a
3	synonymous term, which is common knowledge.
4	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
5	Q. But not common knowledge as defined as a
6	social -- by social sciences that everyone in the
7	community knows the fact and they all know that
8	everybody else knows, right?
9	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
10	THE WITNESS: Again, I think are you
11	referencing one of our exhibits --
12	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
13	Q. Yes.
14	A. -- early on?
15	I think I made it clear earlier on when we
16	looked at that that this was a definition by a
17	philosopher. It came from a philosophy
18	encyclopedia. As a historian, I don't have the same
19	definition.
20	Q. Are you aware of common knowledge ever
21	being defined by a historian that something was
22	common knowledge even though any individual member
23	of the public may not have known it or the public as
24	a whole may not have known it?
208
CONFIDENTIAL
1	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: Again, I think there are two
3	pieces to that question. There are two little
4	pieces at the end there. I'm not sure which one I'm
5	being asked to respond to.
6	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
7	Q. Right. I have been pursuing a line of
8	inquiry that public awareness as written into the
9	question by Philip Morris' lawyers that you answered
10	is misleading. You've suggested that, well, an
11	equivalent term would be common knowledge.
12	So my question is, can you cite to me any
13	scholarly definition of common knowledge where it
14	equates to your definition of public awareness?
15	MR. SNAPP: Objection to form.
16	THE WITNESS: Again, I think you've
17	mischaracterized what I said earlier about the term
18	public awareness and this being a lawyer's term, but
19	to move on from that, again, I think I've talked
20	about this concept as being one that is common to
21	social historians. It's one that I use in my
22	teaching. Oftentimes again it's referred to by that
23	French term mentalitie, and -- but social historians
24	use it all the time. It's the way we get a sense of
209
CONFIDENTIAL
1	sort of the world within which -- the information
2	world within which people live and make their
3	decisions and helps us bridge the present and the
4	past. It's fundamental to studying history.
5	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
6	Q. When you use the concept public awareness
7	in the classroom, what do you refer to it as?
8	A. I probably -- you know, I may use the term
9	public awareness, I probably --1 use the term
10	awareness, sort of general awareness. For example,
11	I teach quite a few courses that deal with race and
12	ethnic issues, racial and ethnic history, and so we
13	spend quite a lot of time in those courses talking
14	about, you know, how sort of awareness, public
15	awareness or common knowledge regarding how one
16	racial or ethnic group perceived another, kind of
17	the information again that was out there regarding
18	racial and ethnic differences for example.
19	Q. Now, this actually is an area you've
20	published in. Let's say a graduate student wanted
21	to write a Ph.D. thesis on how African-American
22	slaves in the United States felt about their
23	bondage, and he was, however, going to restrict his
24	analysis into what slave owners said about that
210
CONFIDENTIAL
1	topic.
2	That would be a pretty fundamental error,
3	right?
4	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
5	THE WITNESS: If he wants to get a handle
6	on the slaves' feelings about their bondage, the
7	way -- a slaveholder's perspective would be one
8	perspective to look at but certainly not the only
9	one.
10	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
11	Q. And it would be highly suspect, correct?
12	A. Certainly, you know, historians use
13	records of slaveholders very extensively because
14	there's so many of them and they're used quite
15	frequently.
16	But again, it's one source, and any
17	historian who would study that question would look
18	at it as one source, would consider issues of bias,
19	would look at, you know, corroborating information
20	and certainly go beyond that one source and seek out
21	other sources.
22	Q. A better source would be the autobiography
23	of Frederick Douglass, correct?
24	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
211
CONFIDENTIAL
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
2	Q. Published in 1845 in Boston.
3	A. Yeah, I'm very familiar with it. I teach
4	it-
5	Q. I know.
6	A. -- every year.
7	Q. Published in 1845; is that correct?
8	A. It's one of my favorites.
9	Yeah, I think that's right.
10	Q. In Boston?
11	A. In Boston? Probably, yeah.
12	Well, Frederick Douglass would be one
13	source. Again, Frederick Douglass was a unique
14	individual, far from typical, so he would be one
15	source. He wouldn't be the only source. There were
16	very few slaves, for example, who managed to teach
17	themselves to read and write and managed to escape
18	because of those kinds of skills.
19	So he is one of 4 million people who were
20	slaves, you know, in the decade before -- decades
21	before the Civil War, so he's one source.
22	But I would tell that student, yeah, look
23	at Frederick Douglass, but there are many other
24	narratives out there, there are other
212
CONFIDENTIAL
1	autobiographies, there are many other ways that you
2	look at this question, again which is what I tried
3	to do in my report was not count on one source but
4	to look at many, many sources from many different
5	perspectives.
6	Q. But the thing I'm struggling with is there
7	are a handful of times, I think eight sentences,
8	where you reference the tobacco industry including
9	its instrument, agent, the Tobacco Institute, kind
10	of calling into question contemporaneously, you
11	know, a public health official will say something
12	about smoking and health and right away the Tobacco
13	Institute is there as part of the open question
14	strategy to say they're false, there's no
15	information, don't believe them.
16	Why did you put that information in there,
17	those eight sentences?
18	MR. SNAPP: Objection, objection to the
19	form of that question.
20	THE WITNESS: I put those sentences in
21	because they are part of the public information that
22	was out there. They are a, you know, a voice of
23	many voices regarding smoking and health issues.
213
CONFIDENTIAL
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
2	Q. Now, not only a voice, they are certainly
3	the most prominent and well-financed single voice,
4	correct?
5	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
6	THE WITNESS: I don't know.
7	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
8	Q. Okay. Now --
9	A. But may I continue?
10	Q. Sure, absolutely.
11	A. They are -- their message, and again I
12	think this is really crucial to, you know, the
13	conclusions that I draw here and the evidence that I
14	cite, their message is not echoed in other places.
15	It's not reiterated from other sources. It's not,
16	again, part of this much larger context of
17	information that's out there. They're one voice.
18	Nobody else that I've been able to find is saying
19	smoking is not bad for you or it's not addictive or,
20	you know, there's not enough scientific information
21	out there. They're the only ones saying that.
22	Q. Are congressmen and senators different
23	speakers than the tobacco industry?
24	A. Different speakers?
214
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Q. Yeah, voice. Voice as you have used,
2	would the voice of a U.S. senator or the voice of a
3	U.S. congressman be a separate voice from the
4	tobacco industry?
5	A. Again, I think it sort of depends on the
6	congressman or senator.
7	Q. Because as you know in the 1994 Waxman
8	hearings, I think one senator -- there were two
9	publicly-elected officials. My belief is one is a
10	senator, one is a congressman, perhaps they're both
11	congressmen, is they clapped, they said yes, you,
12	tobacco CEOs, who are saying there's no link between
13	tobacco and addiction, there's no link between
14	tobacco and disease, that an asthmatic boy who is
15	seven years old and suffers from secondhand smoke
16	shouldn't have any remedy, you're right, you're
17	absolutely right.
18	So there was -- it's not fair to say there
19	was no voice and it wasn't echoed and repeated, is
20	it?
21	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form,
22	mischaracterizes the evidence that's in the case.
23	And you can answer if you're able.
24	THE WITNESS: I think it is fair to say
215
CONFIDENTIAL
1	that. The only thing about the Waxman hearings and
2	subsequent testimony by tobacco executives, you
3	know, again, the public reaction to this I think,
4	you know, reflected, you know, this issue of public
5	awareness. People thought it was laughable. There
6	were jokes made about it.
7	Maybe one of the offenders you're
8	referring to, I can't remember his name, from
9	Virginia, was regularly referred to in the press as
10	the senator from Philip Morris or the congressman
11	from Philip Morris, so in some ways I think it was
12	the same voice.
13	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
14	Q. Okay. Now, do you have an expert opinion
15	whether or not as a general matter smokers in the
16	class began smoking Philip -- Marlboro Lights in
17	material reason, a material reason was that
18	Philip Morris misled them about the relative
19	delivery and health risk of Marlboro Lights versus
20	Marlboro Reds?
21	MR. SNAPP: Objection.
22	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
23	Q. That is not a topic you have an expert
24	opinion on, correct?
CONFIDENTIAL
1	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
2	question.
3	THE WITNESS: I do not have an expert
4	opinion on why anybody would begin to smoke.
5	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
6	Q. Including why a Marlboro Light smoker
7	would begin to smoke Marlboro Lights, correct?
8	A. Again, I think you're talking about
9	individual decisions and beliefs and opinions and
10	motivations, which again is beyond my area of
11	expertise.
12	Q. Okay. Okay. Now, your conclusions --
13	A. What did I do with my glasses? Did I not
14	bring my glasses?
15	MS. BERNSTEIN-GAETA: You look here and
16	1 11 --
17	THE WITNESS: No, I think I must have left
18	them. I'm sorry. May I be excused to get my
19	glasses?
20	MR. SURPRENANT: Absolutely.
21	THE WITNESS: Because I cannot read a
22	thing without them.
23	MR. SURPRENANT: Absolutely.
24	THE WITNESS: But Judy will get them for
Ill
CONFIDENTIAL
1	me.
2	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Do you want to go off
3	the record?
4	MR. SURPRENANT: Yes.
5	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 4:17.
6	We're off the record.
7	(Whereupon, an off-the-record
8	discussion was held.)
9	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Okay. We're back on
10	the record. The time is 4:21.
11	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
12	Q. Professor Greenwood, it's been a long day.
13	What I'm going to do is ask you questions about
14	Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 4, and then we will call
15	it a day.
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. And I would like to rush out and get a
18	martini, but I actually have to work all evening.
19	Okay. Paragraph 2 says, "The less tar the
20	better. Health professionals advised smokers" --
21	A. Page 4.
22	Q. — "to quit smoking but advised those who
23	would not or could not quit to smoke low-tar
24	cigarettes. This message was reiterated, reinforced
CONFIDENTIAL
1	and echoed through a variety of sources until 2001,"
2	correct?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And does that communicate your expert
5	opinion?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Okay. Then that message changed in 2001,
8	correct?
9	A. I'm not sure it changed. I think, again,
10	you know, if you go down to point 4,1 think the
11	question, there were always doubts certainly about
12	whether low-tar cigarettes were safer or not, and
13	then as I say here, in 2001, just to quote from my
14	report, questions regarding the risk reduction of
15	low-tar cigarettes culminated in 2001 with the
16	publication of Monograph 13 by the National Cancer
17	Institute.
18	So I think, again, I think as I said
19	earlier today, I don't think Monograph 13 was, you
20	know, a new message. I mean, those questions
21	regarding the safety or relative safety of low-tar
22	cigarettes were out there very early on.
23	Q. So Monograph 13, quote, "concluded that
24	smokers of low-tar cigarettes," let me stop.
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Would that include Marlboro Lights?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Okay. "Monograph 13, quote, concluded
4	that smokers of low-tar cigarettes, quote, did not
5	substantially alter their exposure to tar and
6	nicotine and correspondingly did not lower their
7	risk, closed quote, of lung cancer, emphysema and
8	other ailments."
9	So in the middle of the class period,
10	Monograph 13 comes out and says, smokers of
11	Marlboro Lights, we want you to know that you're not
12	substantially altering your exposure to tar and
13	nicotine and correspondingly you're not lowering
14	your risk, closed quote, of lung cancer, emphysema
15	and other ailments.
16	Is that in sum and substance correct?
17	A. Yes, I think that reflects what I say in
18	Paragraph --
19	Q. Prior to Monograph 13,1 take it then
20	members of the class would have been reasonable to
21	the extent they knew what you have described as
22	being -- as public awareness, they would have been
23	reasonable to conclude prior to Monograph 13 that
24	they had substantially altered their exposure to tar
220
CONFIDENTIAL
1	and nicotine and correspondingly had lowered the
2	risk of lung cancer, emphysema and other ailments by
3	smoking Marlboro Lights, correct?
4	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
5	question.
6	THE WITNESS: No. Monograph 13 was based
7	on a number of studies that were done again from the
8	1970s on, many of which were reported as I point out
9	in this document in Missouri newspapers and national
10	magazines, in "The Today Show" and evening news
11	programs, in various kinds of pamphlets and
12	information handed out by health organizations as
13	well as things like textbooks.
14	So again, that warning was always there,
15	and it again had a lot to do with issues of how
16	people smoke their cigarettes, that warning that had
17	constantly been there, that you may switch down and
18	reduce your risk, but you cannot change and modify
19	your smoking behavior because you can nullify the --
20	any advantages that you may have from smoking a
21	low-tar cigarette.
22	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
23	Q. Let me ask just one general question
24	because I grew up in a state that actually connects
221
CONFIDENTIAL
1	to Missouri. I grew up in Illinois, and I think I
2	was reasonably well-read.
3	There's a lot of citations to The New York
4	Times, The Washington Post, The LA Times in your
5	report. I didn't see a New York Times until I was
6	23 years old in Madison.
7	Is it your claim that folks in Missouri
8	regularly read The Washington Post and The New York
9	Times and The Los Angeles Times?
10	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
11	question.
12	THE WITNESS: Again, that's not my claim,
13	and those newspapers again are national newspapers I
14	think it's fair to say that again were a part of
15	this information context that was out there. But I
16	also quote very extensively from a number of
17	Missouri newspapers, St. Louis Globe-Democrat, The
18	St. Louis Post-Dispatch, The Kansas City Times, The
19	Kansas City Star, The Cape Girardeau Newspaper, The
20	Kansas City Call, the Columbia newspaper, the
21	Independence Newspaper, the newspaper from
22	Springfield.
23	So I think I have clearly documented that
24	a lot of this information that was reported in The
222
CONFIDENTIAL
1	New York Times and say The LA Times was also
2	reported quite extensively in Missouri newspapers.
3	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
4	Q. Just a few follow-up questions.
5	A. Uh-huh.
6	Q. I understand the citation. I don't mean
7	to suggest that you only cite to what I would have
8	growing up as a kid considered a highfalutin
9	newspaper. I understand you cite to local papers,
10	Missouri papers.
11	But why such extensive citations to
12	LA Times, New York Times and Washington Post when I
13	think it is fair to say as a matter of common sense
14	relatively few of the members of the class would
15	have actually read those newspapers?
16	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
17	question.
18	THE WITNESS: Again, I don't know and I'm
19	not here to judge how many people in the class read
20	these newspapers. I cite them as part of the
21	information that was out there and readily available
22	and accessible, but I think it's fair to say there
23	are very few times where I cite The New York Times
24	or The LA Times alone freestanding without also
223
CONFIDENTIAL
1	showing that these main -- these very important
2	reports were published in Missouri newspapers.
3	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
4	Q. Did your research in Missouri, were you
5	assisted by paralegals or other research assistants
6	in tracking down that information?
7	A. I did quite a bit of the research myself
8	largely through the wonders of the internet now. A
9	lot of these newspapers are on line and you can, you
10	know --1 was able to research them long distance.
11	I did have some paralegals help me with
12	collecting some sources in Missouri. I also made a
13	point of going to Missouri, as I mentioned before,
14	to do my own research at a number of sites,
15	including the University of Missouri Columbia,
16	University of Missouri Kansas City, State Historical
17	Archives.
18	Q. Who were the paralegals employed by?
19	A. I think --1 have to think. There was one
20	woman who we got through a paralegal or an agency
21	who was a Ph.D. student at University of Missouri
22	Columbia. She helped me.
23	And there were I think two paralegals from
24	Arnold & Porter who I directed to do research at the
224
CONFIDENTIAL
1	Library of Congress. And again, this was supervised
2	research. I just want to make that clear. I, you
3	know, guided their research. I explained the
4	research process. I supervised them. They checked
5	in with me regularly, and I, you know, was in charge
6	of their research.
7	Q. Okay. Only two more questions.
8	I've quoted several times, I think I got
9	it right, there's eight sentences in your report
10	that talk about Tobacco Institute or the tobacco
11	industry calling into question the link between
12	smoking and disease and addiction.
13	I think it would be trivial, it would be
14	easy for every time you quote a public comment about
15	health issues and smoking up through 1999 for me to
16	get something from the Tobacco Institute or a
17	tobacco company either directly calling into
18	question that communication or a contemporaneous
19	account largely calling the substance into
20	communication. I could -- in a trial, what I'm
21	going to do, I'm going to have such exhibits. We
22	will just walk through them.
23	And my question is, why did you only
24	include it in a handful of paragraphs in eight
225
CONFIDENTIAL
1	sentences as opposed to every time the tobacco
2	industry called into question a public health
3	warning about smoking?
4	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
5	question, and object to the preamble to the
6	question.
7	THE WITNESS: I studied the tobacco
8	industry, tobacco industry statements as I, you
9	know, perceived them, researched them, saw them
10	within again this larger information context. I
11	think it's fair to say that in writing any kind of
12	historical document, you can't use every single
13	source that's out there. It would just be a matter
14	of, you know, just like a mishmosh of information.
15	I think by citing the sources that I did,
16	I made it clear again I think throughout this
17	document what the tobacco industries, Tobacco
18	Institute, tobacco industry spokespeople's comments
19	were on these issues, and I felt that I, you know,
20	by citing the sources that I did, I think they were
21	strong sources that I made it clear what their voice
22	was and what their opinion was regarding these
23	issues.
226
CONFIDENTIAL
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
2	Q. Well, as a social historian, do you have
3	any opinion about whether my hypothetical ease of
4	mirror-imaging a Tobacco Institute or tobacco
5	industry denunciation of every health warning
6	through 1999,1 could do that, couldn't I, don't you
7	think?
8	MR. SNAPP: Objection.
9	THE WITNESS: I wouldn't make that
10	assumption, no. I would need to go back and look at
11	the sources.
12	BY MR. SURPRENANT:
13	Q. Okay. So at trial then, every time in
14	your testimony you refer to some public health
15	issue -- strike that.
16	What is the capitol of Missouri?
17	A. The capitol of Missouri is Jefferson City.
18	I went to the Department of Health there.
19	Q. Jeff City. What are the other three
20	capitols in the United States named after former
21	presidents?
22	A. Oh, boy.
23	Q. I got her now.
24	MS. B ERNSTEIN - G AET A: On the record, he
227
CONFIDENTIAL
1	will buy you a drink if you get this.
2	MR. SURPRENANT: I will.
3	THE WITNESS: Let me think a minute.
4	MR. SURPRENANT: No helping. No Googling.
5	THE WITNESS: Wow, my husband would know
6	this. He loves geography questions.
7	MR. SURPRENANT: Off the record. I do not
8	have to buy a drink.
9	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Okay. The time is-
10	THE WITNESS: I'm just too tired to think.
11	MR. SNAPP: Lincoln, Nebraska.
12	MR. SURPRENANT: Lincoln, Nebraska.
13	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 4:33.
14	We're off the record.
