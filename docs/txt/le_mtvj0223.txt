1	THEREUPON:
2	KENNETH LIPARTITO, Ph.D.
3	called as a witness on behalf of the Plaintiff
4	herein, duly sworn and responding "I do," was
5	examined and testified as follows:
6	DIRECT EXAMINATION
7	BY MR. HILL:
8	Q. Good afternoon, sir. My name is Jack Hill.
9	We introduced each other -- we were introduced to
10	each other earlier. Tell us what your name is, sir.
11	A. My name is Kenneth Lipartito.
12	Q. And are you having, so far, any difficulty
13	hearing my questions?
14	A. No, I can hear you fine.
15	Q. As I you. You will, of course, let me know
16	if that should change at some point during the
17	deposition?
18	A. Yes, I will.
19	Q. You are in Miami for this deposition, sir,
20	is that correct?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And you are at what office, sir?
23	A. Oh, I think I'm at the offices of Carlton
24	Fields.
25	Q. In this matter, do you understand that you
0005
1	have been disclosed by RJ. Reynolds as an individual
2	who will be expressing or may express opinions
3	regarding Mary Simon?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Now, this is not the first time that you
6	have been disclosed in one of these types of cases,
7	and by these types of cases, I mean a tobacco case?
8	A. No.
9	Q. And how many other times have you been
10	disclosed, sir?
11	A. I don't have a perfect recollection, but I
12	think I can recall three.
13	Q. Were you deposed in each of those three
14	times that you can remember?
15	A. From what I recall, I was deposed twice,
16	but I don't think three times. I could be wrong
17	about the number. That's why I'm thinking back.
18	Q. And do you recall the names of the cases
19	that you believe you provided deposition testimony
20	in?
21	A. The one that I recall most clearly and
22	definitely was Richard Dupre.
23	Q. And how do you spell that, sir?
24	A. I believe it's D-U-P-R-E.
25	Q. The one -- let me see, I've got your 0006
1	disclosure here. Do you have a copy of the
2	disclosure with you, sir?
3	A. I think somewhere we have a copy.
4	MR. DAVIS: Jack, I brought a copy with
5	me. If it's all right, I can just show it to him.
6	MR. HILL: That's fine.
7	MR. DAVIS: Okay.
8	THE WITNESS: I have it.
9	BY MR. HILL:
10	Q. Trying to find the dates on the disclosure
11	at least that I have. I don't see that there is one.
12	You see the disclosure there for the areas
13	of testimony that you may be expected to provide,
14	sir?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. As part of your disclosure, there's a case
17	that's listed, and I apologize if I mispronounce the
18	Plaintiffs name, but Hiott versus R.J. Reynolds
19	Tobacco, H-I-O-T-T?
20	A. Hiott, yes.
21	Q. Hiott, all right.
22	Is that different than the Dupre case that
23	you recall testifying in?
24	A. It's different.
25	Q. When were you deposed in Dupre?
0007
1	A. Dupre would have been last week.
2	Q. And who was it that took your deposition,
3	do you recall?
4	A. I don't.
5	Q. That was, I presume, one of the Engle cases
6	currently pending in Florida?
7	A. I believe that's my understanding, but I'm
8	not completely positive on the legal issues there.
9	Q. You sat for a deposition for a case pending
10	in Florida, is that accurate, for Dupre?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. And who was it -- on whose behalf were you
13	providing testimony in that case, sir?
14	A. Well, I was working with lawyers from
15	Jones Day.
16	Q. And on whose behalf, what Defendant or what
17	party, I should say, were you offering testimony on
18	behalf of or at the request of?
19	A. Yeah, I don't have my disclosure for that
20	in front of me, but I believe that was also R J.
21	Reynolds was the Defendant.
22	Q. As was Hiott, correct?
23	A. I can't say for certain. It's been a
24	while since that was done.
25	Q. To your knowledge, is the Dupre case on any 0008
1	trial docket?
2	A. I believe it is, but I don't have a firm
3	date in my mind.
4	Q. Had you had occasion to testify in trial in
5	one of these tobacco cases?
6	A. I have not.
7	Q. Do you know whatever happened to the Hiott
8	case, did that end up going to trial?
9	A. That's my recollection, but I know I was
10	not called as a witness. That's what I'm recalling.
11	Again, I can't be certain, but I know I did not
12	testify in that case.
13	Q. This question is not designed to elicit the
14	names of any other cases, just purely a number. How
15	many other cases have you been retained on regarding
16	Engle litigation in Florida?
17	A. Well, again, I somewhat have an imperfect
18	understanding of what constitutes Engle litigation,
19	but I think -- currently, I think there are several
20	cases, maybe four more cases that I'm doing research
21	on or have received information about.
22	Q. So it would be approximately four more than
23	the two in which you've provided testimony and, of
24	course, this one?
25	A. Yeah, I think that's the answer to the
0009
1	question. Maybe if you could -- are you talking
2	about all cases ever or current cases or --
3	Q. Excellent qualification. Well, currently,
4	are you doing work on other cases at the request of a
5	tobacco Defendant other than the three cases in which
6	you've been disclosed and have been deposed?
7	MR. DAVIS: I guess just let me interpose
8	an objection. I don't think that he needs to
9	disclose if he's been retained in some aspect
10	where he's not been disclosed.
11	MR. HILL: Well, I'm not asking for the
12	names of any of those cases nor am I asking for
13	his finances in any cases, but I think certainly
14	today I'm entitled to find out the nature of this
15	witness's relationship with the folks that hire in
16	these cases. You can instruct him not to answer
17	or just have an objection.
18	MR. DAVIS: Okay, I understand.
19	BY MR. HILL:
20	Q. I guess the ball is in your court, Doc.
21	And if I need to repeat the question, I will.
22	A. I think it might be helpful if you could.
23	Q. Sure. In addition to the three cases in
24	which you've been disclosed, how many other matters
25	have you been retained on to investigate or provide 0010
1	some service with respect to a Defendant in one of
2	these Engle tobacco litigation cases?
3	A. Again, I think my answer is I believe that
4	I'm currently involved or working in some way on
5	four, possibly five cases. You know, I think that's
6	the best answer I can give because there's some
7	ambiguity, I think, as to what I'm doing on certain
8	cases that I may or may not have seen at different
9	times.
10	Q. Ambiguity how so, sir?
11	A. I think that there's different times I've
12	heard discussions of different cases, but I'm not
13	necessarily involved in them at this point or working
14	on them. So I'm trying to distinguish between things
15	that possibly have been discussed as cases that might
16	involve me and cases that I'm more actively engaged
17	in.
18	Q. When did you first -- you brought up an
19	interesting clarification about current versus things
20	that you've done in the past. How long have you been
21	doing this type of work that is involving yourself in
22	the historical analysis of the type that you are
23	going to be testifying about in this matter?
24	A. I began working in 2005 on these matters.
25	Q. And what was it that happened in 2005 so
0011
1	that you began to work on these matters?
2	A. I received phone calls, I think there were
3	several ultimately, that involved a law firm that
4	asked if I could provide historical information
5	pertaining to smoking and public awareness of smoking
6	and health. That was the beginning.
7	Q. And the law firm that contacted you?
8	A. The law firm is Johnson Tyler and Purvis.
9	Q. Did you understand back in 2005 when you
10	were contacted by Johnson Tyler on whose behalf you
11	ultimately would be performing this analysis?
12	A. Well, that time, I was asked more
13	generally about historical knowledge and information
14	pertaining to smoking and public awareness of smoking
15	and health, public awareness of health. I didn't
16	have a particular understanding of a particular
17	client or firm. It was a bit more general than that.
18	Q. Did you have the understanding that the
19	work was being requested by someone representing the
20	tobacco industry or members of the tobacco industry?
21	A. Yeah, I had that general understanding.
22	Q. So when you agreed to perform the work, you
23	weren't oblivious to the fact that your work was
24	being requested by individual entities associated
25	from the tobacco industry?
0012
1	A. Again, I think I said I had a general
2	awareness of that, yes.
3	Q. And did you understand at the time that
4	there may be an occasion for you to testify in
5	matters in which members of the tobacco industry were
6	Defendants in lawsuits pending in Florida?
7	A. So I think the issue of testifying was not
8	necessarily in the first things we discussed. I
9	think it was more in the nature of research, but I
10	can't remember at what point we talked about doing
11	testifying. It wasn't exactly my original focus; the
12	original focus was on research.
13	Q. And when you talk about original focus, at
14	any point before 2005, did you have a focus on
15	smoking and public health, public awareness of the
16	health hazards associated with smoking?
17	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: I think, just in the sense
19	of being a historian of the 20th century, that was
20	certainly something that I was aware of in the
21	general sense. Beyond that, I think the answer to
22	your question would be no.
23	BY MR. HILL:
24	Q. Again, historians such as yourself have the
25	tendency to get very specific in their areas of
0013
1	research and inquiry. Would you agree with that
2	general statement?
3	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: I think I'd have to qualify
5	it a little bit by saying that historians have
6	various levels of specialization, and then they do
7	specific research on topics that usually fit
8	within the broader areas of specialization.
9	BY MR. HILL:
10	Q. Let's talk about the topics then. At no
11	point before 2005 had you engaged in any research
12	regarding the topic of smoking and public awareness
13	of health hazards associated with smoking?
14	A. Yes, or I think the answer is correct.
15	Q. That wasn't a specific area of focus for
16	you as a historian, correct?
17	A. I had not done research on that topic
18	before.
19	Q. And you had never published in that area
20	either, sir?
21	A. I had not published.
22	Q. And is that true today in 2014 that you
23	have yet to publish anything having to do with public
24	awareness about the health risks associated with
25	smoking ?
0014
1	A. I have not published anything specifically
2	on that topic.
3	Q. Have you published anything generally on
4	that topic?
5	A. I think there may be mentions of the
6	tobacco industry at different times in things that
7	I've done, certainly in some teaching I've done. I
8	don't know about written publications as much, but
9	it's certainly a topic that's come up in the general
10	part of my scholarship as a historian.
11	Q. And the general you are talking about the
12	tobacco industry as a whole as compared to the
13	specific topic of smoking and health and awareness by
14	the public of the risks associated with smoking?
15	A. Yeah, I think more so, right, right.
16	Q. As part of any lecturing that you've done,
17	has any discussion occurred with respect to this
18	specific topic?
19	A. I can't recall.
20	Q. That is health risks associated with
21	smoking?
22	A. I can't recall any.
23	Q. Any current plans to publish in that area,
24	that is the area regarding smoking and health hazards
25	associated with smoking?
0015
1	A. Nothing definite.
2	Q. Anything indefinite?
3	A. I think I've speculated about ideas as far
4	as I've gone.
5	Q. And what have you speculated about?
6	A. Oh, just —
7	Q. In terms of publishing?
8	A. Right, just thinking as I always do with
9	my research, if there's things that I've learned that
10	I might use in some way in other contexts.
11	Q. Are there areas that you are presently
12	engaged in as a historian that you do plan on
13	publishing, any specific interests that you have?
14	A. I think my current main focus is a project
15	that I've worked on and off for a number of years on
16	the history of surveillance.
17	Q. Surveillance by whom and of what?
18	A. Well, I think at the most general level
19	any form of surveillance, though I look at
20	surveillance perhaps a bit more in what I call the
21	private sector than the public sector, less the NSA
22	perhaps and more Google.
23	Q. All right, and I promise not to spoil the
24	surprise for anybody who ultimately reads whatever
25	you end up publishing, but give me some more nuts and
0016
1	bolts of what it is about surveillance and Google
2	that interests you academically that you plan on
3	writing about.
4	A. Okay. Well, it's a pretty big question.
5	Again, I think I've been doing research on this.
6	There are, I think, some things I've published that
7	touch on this or that I've written that I think are
8	written papers. It involves a variety of topics
9	about the ways in which information about people is
10	collected and used in different contexts.
11	I mean, I'm still at a pretty early stage,
12	so I can't give you the book yet because I haven't
13	really even written page 1 of it, so -- but it's
14	about information and the accumulation of information
15	about people in different contexts, some of which
16	were more political, criminal, some of which are
17	market related, I guess you could say. The most work
18	that I've done is about credit reporting.
19	So I hope it will be of interest to people
20	who study information and communication and various
21	media. I hope it will have a big audience and I hope
22	I'll be even beyond Stephen Colbert, but I can't say
23	where it's going to go.
24	Q. It's interesting to me that of all the news
25	outlets that you could aspire to be on, I applaud you
0017
1	for your choice for being on the Stephen Colbert
2	show.
3	Have you brought with you materials
4	related to your involvement in Mary Simon's case?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. That's a long way of asking do you have
7	your file?
8	A. I have some materials, yes, and --
9	Q. What materials do you not have?
10	A. I think what -- let me say what I have, it
11	might be easier. I have the reliance material that
12	I've used in this case, material that I've relied on
13	for my opinions, and I think I have -- which I think
14	includes copies of the depositions that were taken
15	about this case, and I think some -- there was
16	requests, I think, of some other material, which I
17	think I've brought as well.
18	So those are the general categories of
19	things I have.
20	Q. Does the material that you brought with you
21	include invoices for work done in this case?
22	A. Yeah, I believe it does.
23	Q. All right. Can you cull out any invoices
24	that you've brought with you, sir?
25	A. Sure.
0018
1	MR. DAVIS: Yeah, hold on a second. If we
2	can go off the record to give us a minute to
3	assemble, if that's all right with you.
4	MR. HILL: Sure.
5	MR. DAVIS: Okay.
6	(Off the record.)
7	BY MR. HILL:
8	Q. Have you had an opportunity to take a
9	break --1 guess you've been handed, by Mr. Davis,
10	your invoices related to the work that you've done in
11	Mary Simon's case?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Okay. Was that not something that you
14	personally brought with you to the deposition today?
15	A. I think --
16	Q. The invoices?
17	A. I had brought it, I think, the other day
18	and just left it so that copies were going to be
19	made. I wasn't sure exactly what needed to be done,
20	so it was here waiting for me.
21	Q. When you say a couple days ago, was that
22	during a meeting with lawyers having to do with your
23	testimony in this case?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. Let's talk about the invoices. What
0019
1	invoices have you been handed?
2	A. Three invoices.
3	Q. We will mark those as Plaintiffs Composite
4	Exhibit Number 1.
5	(Plaintiffs Composite Exhibit 1, three
6	invoices, was marked for Identification.)
7	BY MR. HILL:
8	Q. If you just wouldn't mind read the date of
9	those invoices into the record, please?
10	A. Sure. October 1, 2013, November 4, 2013,
11	January 2, 2014. There's actually four, I think one
12	is essentially a repetition. Yes, one is a double,
13	just two copies of the same thing, it looks like.
14	Q. All right, and the amount of the
15	October 1st invoice?
16	A. 11,500. I should say this includes
17	multiple cases, if you are talking about Mary Simon.
18	Q. Was your answer 11,500 in relation to Mary
19	Simon or that's what you been paid globally on this
20	and other cases, that's what the invoice was for this
21	and other cases on October 1st?
22	A. Right. To be clear, the invoice was for
23	11,500 and it included work, Mary Simon and two other
24	cases, included in that figure.
25	Q. Okay. Were the cases -- the other cases
0020
1	that are listed, are they listed by name other than
2	Mary Simon?
3	A. They were.
4	Q. And have those been redacted out?
5	A. They have.
6	Q. All right. Were those cases in which you
7	have been disclosed?
8	A. I don't believe so.
9	Q. November 4, 2013, the date--excuse me,
10	amount of that invoice, sir?
11	A. 17,000.
12	Q. Was that work just for Mary Simon or was
13	that work for other cases as well?
14	A. I believe that was work for three cases,
15	Mary Simon and two others.
16	Q. Were the two others in the November 4th
17	invoice different than the other two in the
18	October 1st invoice?
19	A. I can't -- since they have been redacted,
20	I can't recall. I just can't recall.
21	Q. So am I correct, then, that the first time
22	you sent an invoice having anything to do with any
23	work regarding Mary Simon's case was October 1st?
24	A. Right. To be clear, that October 1st
25	would have covered September work.
0021
1	Q. Is September the first time you started
2	working specifically on Mary Simon's case, September
3	of 2013?
4	A. As far as I can see, that's what I've got
5	in my records.
6	Q. Is that consistent with your memory or is
7	your memory not able to say one way or the other?
8	A. Yeah, I think it's roughly consistent with
9	my memory.
10	Q. January 6th invoice is for how much?
11	A. January 2nd.
12	Q. 2nd, excuse me.
13	A. January 2nd is for 13,000.
14	Q. That just for Mary Simon's case or others?
15	A. That is for Mary Simon.
16	Q. And I imagine that you've done work related
17	to this particular case since January 2nd?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. All right, and do you have -- we are now
20	into February. Do you have plans on submitting
21	another invoice to the folks that hired you in this
22	case for work that you've done in January up to
23	today?
24	A. I will.
25	Q. And do you know the amount that that
0022
1	invoice is going to be?
2	A. I think it's about $20,000.
3	Q. And is that $20,000 for work specific to
4	Mary Simon in her case?
5	A. No, I think Mary Simon is one of the
6	cases, but there are several others, again, that are
7	included in that work.
8	Q. And the estimate of $20,000 is a product of
9	what, is that just you doing some quick math as to
10	the number of hours that you have in and multiplying
11	the number of hours times your standard hourly rate?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. And of that $20,000, what portion of that
14	would you devote exclusively to work in Mary Simon's
15	case?
16	A. For just that amount or just the upcoming
17	bill, as it were?
18	Q. Yes, sir.
19	A. I'm thinking maybe 15 hours, 20 hours, so
20	maybe a quarter of it to a fifth.
21	Q. A quarter to a fifth. And I apologize, I
22	didn't mean to start before you were finished.
23	How do you keep track of your time?
24	A. I write down the number of hours I work
25	each -- roughly each day.
0023
1	Q. You talked about reliance materials in this
2	case that includes depositions, did I hear that
3	correctly?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. And can you tell me what depositions you've
6	been provided in this case?
7	A. Well, I have the ones, I guess, I've been
8	provided and have looked at and read. Do you want me
9	to read you the names?
10	Q. Please.
11	A. Okay. Give me a second.
12	Okay. Carolyn Sage.
13	Kathleen Simon, volume 1.
14	Jay Simon, volume 1.
15	Joys Yesely, I believe it is, Y-E-S-E-L-Y.
16	Pamela Crosby.
17	Michael Malone.
18	Kathleen Hanrahan.
19	Sylvia Danelly Simon.
20	Sean Simon.
21	Richard Eric Anderson.
22	And that's what I have.
23	Q. Those are all depositions that you've read,
24	sir?
25	A. Yes.
0024
1	Q. In reading those depositions, did you make
2	any annotations or highlight anything or sticky note
3	anything?
4	A. There are, on some of them, there are, I
5	guess you'd say not annotations but marks by portions
6	of the testimony.
7	Q. And I asked you a very inartful question.
8	I'm trying to find out whether, in each of those
9	depositions, if I were to copy them, would they each
10	contain, you know, some indication by you as to some
11	level of importance having anything to do with
12	specific areas of testimony?
13	A. Well, I'd be reluctant to just say
14	importance. What I would say is that I think in each
15	deposition, but I'm not certain a hundred percent
16	each deposition, most depositions, most of the
17	depositions, there are markings that I've made as I
18	was reading for various purposes, some of which were
19	markings that indicated, I guess you'd say, things
20	that I wanted to call my attention to, others I made
21	for purposes of helping me understand facts and
22	matters in either the deposition or the case.
23	Q. And the way in which you would make marks
24	are what, highlighting?
25	A. Actually, by pen, just a pen check or line
0025
1	or an underline in some cases.
2	Q. Have you created any kind of notes for
3	yourself in terms of information that you gleaned
4	from your review of the case specific materials in
5	this case?
6	A. By case specific materials, you mean?
7	Q. Good point. The depositions I would
8	consider case specific. We will talk about those for
9	a moment.
10	Have you made any sort of notes or memos
11	to yourself regarding your review of the depositions
12	in this case?
13	A. No.
14	Q. Have you written down anywhere any thoughts
15	that you have of opinions that you have in this case,
16	a report of any kind?
17	A. Not a report.
18	Q. I didn't mean for it to be as restrictively
19	narrow as a report, but, I mean, do you have notes to
20	yourself, memos to yourself, anything like that to
21	help you organize the material in this case?
22	A. Referring to all the material that I've
23	reviewed in this case, not just the depositions, is
24	that correct?
25	Q. Sure.
0026
1	A. Yes, I do have some notes.
2	Q. All right. Can you cull out for me the
3	notes that you've taken in this matter, sir?
4	A. Yes, I can.
5	MR. HILL: We are going to mark those as
6	Plaintiffs Exhibit 2.
7	(Plaintiffs Composite Exhibit 2,
8	handwritten notes, was marked for Identification.)
9	BY MR. HILL:
10	Q. Describe, for the purposes of record, what
11	composite 2 is, sir.
12	A. Half a dozen pages of notes. I believe
13	these are all notes that pertain to material on my
14	reliance list, referring to documents that I reviewed
15	on the reliance list and/or, in some cases, perhaps
16	categories of documents as well rather than specific
17	individual documents, and I created these to be sure
18	that material on my reliance list that I brought as
19	part of the proceedings here were complete and
20	included all of my up-to-date research.
21	Q. And am I correct, then, that none of your
22	half a dozen pages deals with information you gleaned
23	from the depositions?
24	A. No, it does not.
25	Q. It is more to make sure you have your
0027
1	thoughts in order in terms of the materials that have
2	some significance to you for your opinions in this
3	case regarding Mary Simon?
4	A. No, actually not. That's not quite right.
5	Q. Where have I gone wrong?
6	A. So it's not my thoughts or opinions, it's
7	really literally a checklist of documents that I'm
8	relying on that are to be reflected in my complete
9	reliance list essentially to be sure that all
10	material had been included.
11	Q. When did you generate Plaintiffs
12	Exhibit 2?
13	A. You mean the handwritten notes that we are
14	talking about?
15	Q. The checklist.
16	A. Yes. You know, I can't remember exactly
17	when, but as I recall, I had originally been
18	scheduled for this deposition last week or two weeks
19	ago, so it was sometime just, you know, in
20	preparation for that; perhaps now we are getting
21	towards a month ago, I guess.
22	Q. Okay, and the reliance list in this case,
23	do you happen to have a copy of it, sir?
24	A. Yes, I think.
25	Q. We will mark that. And is that something
0028
1	you brought with you today or is that something that
2	you brought to your meeting earlier in the week
3	whenever that was?
4	A. Actually, if I can just -- actually might
5	want to include this. I do have --1 did find one
6	more in my pile here in front of me, one more
7	handwritten set of notes which are, I think --1
8	think these are notes that were taken before our
9	originally scheduled deposition and which I was
10	writing down some details about when and where and a
11	few things like that, when and where the deposition
12	would take place and a few other notes about some of
13	the research that I had done. I think that's -- so
14	I'll just put that--
15	Q. Sure, yeah.
16	Let's mark that separately as Plaintiffs
17	Exhibit 3.
18	(Plaintiffs Exhibit 3, handwritten notes,
19	was marked for Identification.)
20	BY MR. HILL:
21	Q. And those notes that you created yourself
22	or --
23	A. Sorry, I interrupted you. You want to go
24	ahead and say it again?
25	Q. The notes were created by you, Plaintiffs
0029
1	Exhibit 3?
2	A. They are, they are my handwritten notes.
3	Q. And do you recall the circumstances
4	regarding the creation of those notes?
5	A. I think --1 don't exactly. I think it
6	was notes that I had taken, I think, before the due
7	date of the original deposition because it has some
8	information about -- actually, it isn't quite
9	specific, but it has some information about dates and
10	possible dates, and then it has some information
11	about some of the other materials, I think, notes to
12	myself to remind myself to check things, basically.
13	Q. When you are talking about dates,
14	specifically, are you talking about the date of the
15	deposition or dates that are specific to something
16	having to do with Mary Simon and her life?
17	A. I don't think it's actually -- there is,
18	at least I think, one date that might pertain to Mary
19	Simon. The other are dates for trial dates and
20	things of that sort. It's only a short page or half
21	page.
22	Q. All right.
23	A. Yeah.
24	Q. We won't spend anymore time on it.
25	We got down this road in talking about
0030
1	your reliance list.
2	A. Right.
3	Q. Do you still have it there in front of you?
4	A. Yeah, let me pull it out.
5	Well, I'm not seeing it here. I don't
6	seem to -- hang on, let's not give up yet. I don't
7	seem to actually have the actual text of the reliance
8	list. I thought it was here, but I'm not seeing it,
9	so I don't have it in front of me.
10	MR. HILL: Todd, it would probably make
11	things a lot quicker for him to have that. I can
12	certainly e-mail it to you for printing, but I
13	suspect that you have the ability to do that
14	there.
15	MR. DAVIS: Yeah. I mean, if you can, can
16	you keep going? When we take a break at an hour,
17	we will figure it out on this end.
18	MR. HILL: Sure.
19	BY MR. HILL:
20	Q. The reliance list is something that was
21	prepared by you, sir?
22	A. Yes. I think the answer to that question
23	is yes. The physical typing of it, perhaps I didn't
24	do the typing of it, but the materials I provided
25	that were then typed up or whatever you would call
0031
1	it.
2	Q. Meaning you provided the content to someone
3	and someone typed it up for you?
4	A. Exactly.
5	Q. And to whom did you provide the content to?
6	A. So the reliance list is a combination of
7	material that I've reviewed over -- well, really
8	since 2005 as well as additional material and
9	research done for Mary Simon. So a good portion of
10	the original reliance list goes back to earlier
11	reliance lists that were created, I think, for
12	earlier cases and I don't know who --1 can't recall
13	if this goes back a number of years, who actually did
14	the -- you know, the compiling and typing and putting
15	together of that list. And then the additional
16	material that is pertinent to the Mary Simon case,
17	new material for this case, I was -- it was done by
18	someone at Jones Day.
19	Q. Let me ask you some specifics about it.
20	For example, you've got a category A that says
21	newspapers and it lists 14 or 10 newspapers, time
22	ranges, all right?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. And what I want to talk to you about is for
25	any given newspaper, what instructions or what
0032
1	research was done such that materials were collected
2	for that newspaper during that date range?
3	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: Yes, it's -- the answer
5	would be that it varies pretty much by each
6	individual newspaper.
7	BY MR. HILL:
8	Q. Okay. Well, let's pick some that you
9	understand to have some significance in this case.
10	A. Okay.
11	Q. What did you understand, from your review
12	of the materials, that Mary Simon at some point, in
13	terms of newspapers, may or may not have read?
14	A. My understanding is that she read the
15	Pittsburgh Post Gazette and the Palm Beach Post.
16	Q. What's your understanding in terms of the
17	time frames that Mary Simon read the Pittsburgh Post
18	Gazette?
19	A. I don't have an exact time frame. I know
20	when she was born, possibly she read it in the 1930s
21	and 40s, but I concentrated on the period after 1950.
22	Q. And why was the period of 1950s selected
23	for the reliance list having to do with Mary Simon
24	for the Pittsburgh Gazette?
25	A. Because that's the period in which the
0033
1	discussions about smoking and health, I think, are
2	most in the public domain and public discussions in
3	newspapers.
4	Q. And Mary Simon in 1950 would have been how
5	old?
6	A. I believe she -- she would have been 31.
7	Q. Do you have an understanding, based on your
8	review of the materials in this case, as to when it
9	was that Mary Simon became a regular smoker?
10	A. I think that's uncertain. I know that her
11	children say they recall her smoking when they were
12	living in the house growing up, so I think her
13	youngest child was born in 1945, so I think the
14	memory probably extends back to 1950 or 1949 or
15	something of that sort.
16	Q. Were you provided with any medical records
17	regarding Mary Simon in this case, sir?
18	A. I would not say medical records, no.
19	Q. Well, your qualification of that answer
20	drives me to ask a follow-up. Do you have medical
21	records or not, sir?
22	A. I don't.
23	Q. Okay, and, so, what qualification were you
24	attempting to inject into that answer?
25	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
0034
1	THE WITNESS: The only thing that is
2	medical, that I would consider medical realm, is
3	the deposition of one of her physicians.
4	BY MR. HILL:
5	Q. Dr. Anderson?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. And, so, to the extent to which the medical
8	records themselves assist us in determining when it
9	was that Mary Simon became a regular smoker, that's
10	not information that has been made available to you?
11	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
12	THE WITNESS: It's not actually
13	information I would feel qualified to review given
14	that I'm not a medical doctor or have medical
15	training.
16	BY MR. HILL:
17	Q. Sir, you said, when asked whether you had
18	an understanding as to when Mary Simon became a
19	regular smoker, your answer was that there's some
20	degree of uncertainty about that, am I correct, sir?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Based on the fact that the only folks that
23	were around to testify about Mary Simon's tobacco use
24	were her daughters, her children?
25	A. Yes.
0035
1	Q. And, so, to the extent to which there are
2	records that outline statements made by Mary Simon
3	herself as to when she started smoking, that's not
4	something that you've reviewed, correct?
5	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
6	THE WITNESS: Again, I think where that
7	has come up has been in testimony either by her
8	Dr. Anderson or by her children or family members.
9	BY MR. HILL:
10	Q. Do you understand from Dr. Anderson's
11	deposition that Mary Simon would have first started
12	becoming a regular smoker around the age of 17?
13	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form,
14	mischaracterizes the testimony.
15	THE WITNESS: Yeah, I don't recall an
16	exact date of 17 in his deposition.
17	BY MR. HILL:
18	Q. And to the extent that there's medical
19	records that state that Mary Simon started smoking at
20	the age of 15, that's not something that you've been
21	provided, either, correct?
22	A. Medical records, no. The question of her
23	age, as I said, is uncertain. There is testimony in
24	depositions that use the age of 15,1 believe, or
25	possibly 14 or 15.
0036
1	Q. Is it of any significance to you in this
2	case, sir, with respect to your opinions when it was
3	that Ms. Simon became a regular smoker?
4	A. I think exact date is less significant. I
5	think what I tried to do is study her entire life and
6	find out pretty much at every age, regardless when
7	she started, what information would have been
8	available to her.
9	Q. And in this case, are you planning on
10	offering opinions as to specific knowledge contained
11	by Mary Simon about anything having to do with
12	cigarette smoking and health?
13	A. I'm not sure I understand your question.
14	Q. Sure. I think you have testified in
15	another case that, as a historian, you have -- I'm
16	paraphrasing, of course -- that you are not here to
17	talk about an individual's knowledge. Am I accurate
18	about that?
19	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: Yeah, I'm not sure if I said
21	that. I think what I say is I can't pinpoint
22	exactly what she may or may not have seen, and in
23	this case, I don't have anything even from her
24	that says anything about her knowledge. So, as a
25	historian, as is often the case, I have to
0037
1	reconstruct, as best I can, information available
2	from a variety of sources. One source that I do
3	look at is the words and testimony, I guess, of
4	her family and friends. And as best as possible,
5	I try and reconstruct what are the range of things
6	she would have seen and the likelihood of her
7	being exposed to such information.
8	BY MR. HILL:
9	Q. Do you have any opinions that you plan on
10	offering as to when it was that Mary Simon first
11	learned about the addictive nature of cigarettes?
12	A. Again, kind of in the same vein, I can't
13	pinpoint exactly what she may have seen. I can talk
14	about what was available and of the connections
15	between her life and what we know about her life and
16	information that she would have been exposed to in
17	various ways.
18	Q. Is there anything specific that you plan on
19	offering with respect to what Mary Simon knew and
20	when she knew it with respect to smoking ?
21	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
22	BY MR. HILL:
23	Q. Health effects associated with smoking?
24	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
25	THE WITNESS: I think there are - well,
0038
1	specifics if not exact dates, then certainly
2	within a more narrow range possibilities, we do
3	have some information about things that she did in
4	her life or things she said that indicate an
5	awareness, yes.
6	BY MR. HILL:
7	Q. All right. Let's talk about the things
8	that she did. What do you plan on pointing to the
9	jury to help their understanding of what Mary Simon
10	knew regarding the health effects associated with
11	cigarette smoking?
12	A. So there's variety of things. Her
13	awareness of her husband's heart condition and its
14	connection to smoking as indicated by her husband's
15	physician and her concern about him continuing to
16	smoke despite heart issues. Her discussions about
17	the dangers or the undesirability of her children
18	smoking. Her use -- apparently her use of language
19	about cigarettes causing people to become addicted or
20	hooked. Her -- sorry, I'm trying to recall quite a
21	bit, so maybe I should stop there. If you want to
22	talk about that, I can try to recall other things.
23	Q. No, I think you are doing a fine job of
24	giving me the global answer to a very global
25	question.
0039
1	You talked about her husband's heart
2	issues and you talked about discussions with her
3	children and you talked about addiction, her getting
4	hooked. What other specific areas do you plan on
5	talking about?
6	A. There's -- well, all areas or you mean in
7	the same --
8	Q. No, you were talking about the things that
9	she did and said as an indicator of what her
10	knowledge was and awareness was, so I want to flush
11	those out with you.
12	A. Yeah. So, you know, efforts that she may
13	have made at different times to consider quitting
14	smoking. And on the other side, I think very direct
15	statements made to her by friends, family members and
16	physicians that she should stop smoking. Those plus
17	information available outside of family, friends and
18	physicians and the public kind of constitute the
19	information world of Mary Simon that I'm going to
20	talk about.
21	Q. And when we talk about the information
22	world of Mary Simon, what part of your training,
23	education and experience as a historian provides you
24	with some kind of specialized knowledge, training or
25	skill to opine about what someone understood and
0040
1	when?
2	A. So, I mean, again, I didn't say I would
3	point to specific things that Mary Simon understood.
4	I said the world, indicating the context in which she
5	lived, that is to say the things that she read or may
6	have read, the things she may have seen on
7	television, movies and other media, all these, I
8	think, are very standard sorts of sources that
9	historians rely on to do work on issues that deal
10	with history or questions about culture in society
11	and people living in different times. I think I'm
12	following a very standard historical methodology and
13	the sources that I've used throughout my career.
14	Q. Let me make sure I understand that you are
15	not going to be coming to trial and telling the jury
16	that you are of the opinion that Mrs. Simon had a
17	certain specific knowledge of the health risks of
18	smoking cigarettes or the date on which she had that
19	knowledge?
20	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
21	BY MR. HILL:
22	Q. That's not what you are planning on doing?
23	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
24	THE WITNESS: No, that's incorrect.
0041
1	BY MR. HILL:
2	Q. You do plan on doing that?
3	A. Again, I think, as I've said, that I plan
4	on discussing the available information and
5	concluding that she had -- and both by the amounts,
6	variety, forms of information, by her own words and
7	deeds, that there's, you know, sufficient evidence to
8	conclude that she was aware of the dangers of
9	smoking.
10	Q. Let's talk about the information that was
11	available to Mary Simon in certain aspects and parts
12	of her life. You understand -- or what is your
13	understanding in terms of where she went to, say,
14	elementary school?
15	A. Yes. There's again some ambiguity and
16	uncertainty. She clearly attended school based on
17	the information I have of her being a high school
18	graduate. She may have attended a parochial Catholic
19	elementary school in Pittsburgh, which I think is
20	more likely a possibility. She may have attended a
21	public elementary school in Pittsburgh.
22	Q. And what allows you to opine about the
23	probability of whether she went to public school
24	versus some private school?
25	A. First, there's testimony that after her
0042
1	mother died in 1921, that she herself said to her
2	children, and her children repeated, that she had
3	been raised by nuns, an indication of some connection
4	with Catholic institutions. More circumstantial, I
5	suppose, but for historian useful evidence is that
6	she herself seems to have been strongly Catholic and
7	even sent her own children at different times to
8	Catholic schools.
9	So, you know, combination of evidence
10	points, I think, pretty strongly in the direction of
11	Catholic elementary school, but we don't have certain
12	records beyond that.
13	Q. Is the same true of both middle school and
14	high school?
15	A. Again, I think it's possible that she went
16	to Catholic middle school, high school. I think
17	actually sort of structure of schools at that time
18	would have been a primary school to 8th grade and
19	then a high school 8 to 12. The middle school is
20	kind of a later creation in American education.
21	So it's possible she went to Catholic
22	school. It's less certain that she did, there's
23	reasons to believe she may have gone to a public high
24	school.
25	Q. Well, on your reliance list, you have
0043
1	textbooks from Pennsylvania, true?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And is there a particular textbook that you
4	plan on testifying more likely than not was the
5	textbook used for Mary Simon at any point during
6	primary or high school?
7	A. I think the textbook most likely would be
8	the textbook by Dore.
9	Q. And that would have been textbook for what
10	period of time, sir?
11	A. That's a textbook used in primary, meaning
12	1st grade through 8th grade.
13	Q. And I guess we are talking about time
14	periods 1st through 8th grade, what time period are
15	we talking about?
16	A. I believe she was born in 19 —
17	Q. 1918.
18	A. Thank you. 1918, 1919, so, you know,
19	presumably 1924, 5, 6 area beginning school. It's
20	hard to be exact, but somewhere in the early to 20s
21	through the early 1930s.
22	Q. And was the Dore textbook --1 mean, we are
23	talking about a range of years for schooling. Was
24	the Dore textbook provided --1 mean, was it the same
25	form in each of those different years?
0044
1	A. Yes, as far as I can see, it's the same
2	book used year in and year out in Catholic schools.
3	Q. And what makes you say that it's most
4	likely that that's the textbook that Mary Simon would
5	have been exposed to in primary school?
6	A. Again, it seems very likely that she
7	attended a primary Catholic school more likely than
8	not and that was the health textbook used in
9	Pittsburgh parochial schools in her time period.
10	Q. And, so, are you able to offer any opinions
11	with a similar level of probability in terms of what
12	textbooks she would have had, say, in high school?
13	A. Not as confidently, no. There's more
14	variety of textbooks, there's less certainty as to
15	where she may have gone to high school, Catholic
16	versus public, so it's harder to pinpoint. I do have
17	a number of textbooks which were textbooks used in
18	Pennsylvania and in Pittsburgh schools at that time
19	for health, but I can't say with certainty or high
20	probability which of those she may have seen.
21	Q. So the limitation of your opinion as to
22	more likely than not, the only one that you can talk
23	about with respect to Mary Simon is the Dore
24	textbook?
25	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
0045
1	THE WITNESS: So the only one I can say --
2	you asked specifically which textbook or she would
3	likely have seen. Yes, that's the one I can most
4	point to. I do think that the textbooks I have
5	indicate, as well as other curricular material,
6	indicate a very strong indication that health not
7	only was required to be taught in both public and
8	parochial schools but that health curriculum
9	included, in various ways, information about the
10	dangers of tobacco and smoking.
11	BY MR. HILL:
12	Q. And the purpose of my rather inartful
13	question is to figure out here whether there was any
14	other materials you plan on opining to the jury that
15	more likely than not, you know, this particular
16	textbook was in Mary Simon's hands at some point in
17	her life other than the Dore textbook or is there
18	that level of certainty with anything else with
19	regards to the textbooks?
20	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
21	THE WITNESS: With regard to specific
22	textbooks, I think I cannot say that she saw or
23	didn't see any of the particular textbooks on the
24	list besides the Dore which we discussed.
25	Is it possible to take a break?
0046
1	MR. HILL: Sure.
2	THE WITNESS: Thank you.
3	MR. DAVIS: We will go off the record and
4	take five.
5	(Brief recess was taken.)
6	THE WITNESS: Can I make one correction?
7	Just I think you had asked me the names of the
8	depositions and I think I missed a couple to be --
9	for accuracy.
10	I also have Kathleen Simon volume 2 and
11	Jay Simon volume 2. Volumes 1 and 2,1 think, got
12	stuck together and I didn't -- you know, staples
13	kind of locked together. So I do have 1 and 2.
14	BY MR. HILL:
15	Q. Okay. Anything else that needs clarifying?
16	A. No, I think that's it.
17	Q. Can you share with me what's on -- you
18	actually have the reliance list now, correct?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. All right. Let's mark that I think we are
21	up to 4.
22	(Plaintiffs Exhibit 4, reliance list, was
23	marked for Identification.)
24	BY MR. HILL:
25	Q. And using your reliance list as your
0047
1	guidepost, can you tell me what materials would have
2	been available, say, in the 30s about the addictive
3	nature of cigarette smoking?
4	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
5	THE WITNESS: Yeah, I mean, I have a
6	number of newspapers like the New York Times, the
7	Tampa Tribune and looks like the Florida Times
8	Union that go back that far. I have some material
9	from readers, so I'm just going to talk about the
10	material and then I can think maybe better answer
11	your question.
12	Newsweek, Reader's Digest, TIME
13	Magazine --
14	BY MR. HILL:
15	Q. Let me interrupt you because the question
16	was pretty specific. It wasn't necessarily, you
17	know, what materials do you have from the mid 1930s.
18	The question was very specific. What materials do
19	you have on your reliance list that shed some light
20	as to the public awareness of the addictive nature of
21	cigarettes from the mid 1930s?
22	A. All right. So I think, again, there's a
23	lot of material. It's going to be very hard for me
24	to point to specific items just looking at my list,
25	but I think in the school materials, some of the
0048
1	magazines and newspapers, and, again, it's a long
2	list, so bear with me.
3	Some of the textbooks, some of what I call
4	the national archive and legislative material, this
5	is again a fairly quick going through of a lot of
6	material, so -- there's public domain areas where
7	there are discussions of various sorts on the
8	addictive or habit forming or habitual or difficult
9	to quit, depending on the time, different language
10	was used to discuss this issue that perhaps today
11	would be called addiction.
12	Q. Do you plan on expressing any opinion that
13	Mary Simon, as either a 15-year-old or 17-year-old in
14	the mid 30s, was aware of the addictive natures of
15	cigarette smoking?
16	A. I think, again, the answer is that the
17	material I have points to the general level of
18	awareness in various ways to indicate there was a
19	broad public awareness of the addictive nature.
20	Specifically in Mary Simon's case, I can't point to a
21	specific thing, although I think there's some
22	discussion of it in the some of the textbooks that
23	she may have used, but beyond that level of
24	specificity, I don't have something on Mary Simon. I
25	have Mary Simon and people like her received messages
0049
1	in various forms about the addictive nature of
2	tobacco.
3	Q. Is that a message you would expect to be
4	imparted to either a 15-year-old or a 17-year-old
5	orphan growing up in Pittsburgh in the mid 1930s?
6	A. I really can't be that specific about
7	those particular facts.
8	Q. What do you have on your reliance list from
9	the mid 1930s that speaks to the general awareness of
10	cigarette smoking causing lung cancer?
11	A. So, as I believe I've said in the past,
12	there's -- the lung cancer issue is an issue that's
13	most prominent in its public discussion after 1950.
14	There are a few references here and there in the
15	earlier period, generally, and there are references
16	in textbooks and in books and popular articles about
17	health that appeared in public venues like magazines
18	discussing connections between smoking and other
19	forms of cancer, such as mouth, lip, tongue, but the
20	lung cancer issue specifically is most discussed in
21	the period after 1950.
22	Q. You've got the reliance list in front of
23	you, I think it's 4, and you've listed some
24	newspapers on there, and I want to talk about the
25	methodology for a second because I have been provided
0050
1	the materials that make up your reliance list and I
2	wanted to note, for example, the Pittsburgh Post
3	Gazette. That's a newspaper that you understood at
4	some point in time Mary Simon's to have read?
5	A. Yes, evidence in depositions indicate she
6	read that regularly.
7	Q. When that began, when that ended, you don't
8	know?
9	A. Her reading of it?
10	Q. Yes, sir.
11	A. I don't, but I believe the testimony
12	speaks at least back into the 1940s, certainly by
13	1950.
14	Q. And in looking at the materials that you
15	have for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette from 1950 to
16	1984, what is copied and put on your reliance list
17	versus what does not get copied and put into the
18	reliance list?
19	A. So the methodology varies again over time
20	and depending on the particular documents
21	and -- particular documents I'm researching.
22	Q. Well, the question was specific to the
23	Pittsburgh Post Gazette for that very reason.
24	A. Yes, okay.
25	Q. Tell me about the methodology for the
0051
1	inclusion and exclusion of articles appearing in the
2	Pittsburgh Post Gazette from 1950s to 1984.
3	A. So, in this case, the research covered key
4	dates when, from previous research, from previous
5	research, I had learned that material about smoking
6	and health appeared in papers and other public
7	forums.
8	Q. And while we are being specific, what key
9	dates did you use for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette?
10	A. Well, there's a lot. I have a long list
11	of key dates. So, in this case, I used the key dates
12	especially for the period from 1970 to the early
13	1980s.
14	Q. And were those key dates specific to Mary
15	Simon?
16	A. No, these are key dates -- no, these are
17	key dates when information discussing smoking and
18	health in various ways appears in public venues based
19	on my previous research.
20	Q. And, so, we've got one of the ways to
21	narrow the information is through these date ranges
22	that you selected in terms of these are the important
23	date ranges that you'd like some material gathered
24	inclusive of?
25	A. Not so much date ranges as more specific
0052
1	dates.
2	Q. Okay, and those specific -- meaning I don't
3	suspect you were the one that went to, you know, the
4	computer or the microfiche and made copies of the
5	specific articles, am I right about that?
6	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
7	THE WITNESS: No, you are incorrect.
8	BY MR. HILL:
9	Q. All right. You pulled all the information
10	yourself?
11	A. Not all of it, but I did do some of it,
12	yes.
13	Q. What some of it did you do?
14	A. I can't say sitting here now which of the
15	dates of the hundreds of dates that there were on the
16	list that I did, but either I or a research assistant
17	under my direction did the period from 1970 to 1984.
18	Q. And are we still talking about the Gazette?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. From '80 to - '70 to '84?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Well, in actually opening up the reliance
23	list, I see dates going all the way back to 1950 for
24	the Pittsburgh Post Gazette. That's not news to you,
25	right?
0053
1	A. No.
2	Q. So I'm trying to understand. You have, in
3	talking about date ranges or specific dates that were
4	of importance from 1970 to 1984, so help me
5	understand, I'm sure it makes sense to you, why
6	there's material on your reliance list for the
7	Pittsburgh Post Gazette going all the way back to
8	1950.
9	A. Well, the answer is because I think that's
10	relevant to the questions about smoking and health,
11	particularly lung cancer, and Mary Simon's life.
12	Q. The way in which we got down this hole is
13	you were talking about specific dates of importance
14	for you from 1970 to 1980. Do you recall that?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. '70 to '84, excuse me.
17	A. Right, yes.
18	Q. So let's talk about from 1950 to 1970, do
19	you understand what the methodology was for what got
20	included and what was not included in terms of the
21	Pittsburgh Post Gazette?
22	A. Yes. Generally, this was material
23	collected by other historians looking at the same
24	issue, looking at same issue.
25	Q. And do you know what other historians did
0054
1	that work in this case, that is the Pittsburgh Post
2	Gazette from '50 to '70?
3	A. I don't have specific names, no.
4	Q. And do you know what methodology they
5	employed?
6	A. I don't know the details of it, but I do
7	know that they were looking at the same issue that I
8	was looking at.
9	Q. I mean, do you agree that can be carried
10	out in a number of different ways, that research?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. All right. One of the ways would be to,
13	you know, power through that 20 years of newspapers
14	and look for any article describing any issue related
15	to smoking and health; do you agree with that?
16	A. That's a methodology that I've used or
17	seen used.
18	Q. But that's not methodology you used in this
19	case, correct?
20	A. I have in some cases, I have not -- that
21	is to say. I have in some of the material. But not
22	for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette.
23	Q. And, so, another way to do it, on the other
24	end of the spectrum, would be to selectively pull the
25	articles from the Pittsburgh Post Gazette from 1950
0055
1	to 1970 if an individual thought they ought to be
2	included, correct?
3	A. I suppose that could be, yes.
4	Q. And do you have any understanding as to
5	what between those two spectrums, what methodology
6	was employed such that there are articles on your
7	reliance list from the Pittsburgh Post Gazette from
8	1950 to 1970?
9	A. I don't have direct knowledge of the exact
10	methodology, but I do have, on the basis of my review
11	of the materials and my knowledge from my own
12	research and the Pittsburgh Post Gazette and other
13	many other newspapers, an understanding of the
14	quality of whatever method was used.
15	Q. Well, what method was used, sir?
16	A. Again, I think I've answered your
17	question. I don't know exactly what method was used,
18	but I was able to verify the suitability and quality
19	of the methods that were used to select the materials
20	in that period.
21	Q. So you were not understanding the
22	methodology that was employed, you were able to
23	perform some sort of quality analysis to settle in
24	your own mind that the research was good and
25	comprehensive?
0056
1	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: Yes.
3	BY MR. HILL:
4	Q. And how, sir, did you do that?
5	A. I compared what I saw in the material in
6	that period, both with material that I had collected
7	in Pittsburgh paper from later periods as well as
8	material that I collected from other newspapers in
9	other parts of the country as well as --
10	Q. With ranges in the 1970s?
11	A. Yes. I was going to add, if I might, as
12	well as referring back to, as I mentioned, the key
13	date list that covers the longer period of time.
14	Q. What was the significance for you that
15	there were dates selected beginning in 1974 the
16	Pittsburgh Post Gazette?
17	A. You mean -- sorry, is your question about
18	material from 1970 onward in the Pittsburgh Post
19	Gazette?
20	Q. No. We got talking initially in you
21	testifying that the way in which material was
22	selected was that there were specific dates from 1970
23	to 1984 with respect to the Pittsburgh Post Gazette
24	that you thought important, and I want to find out
25	what you thought important beginning in 1970. Why
0057
1	1970?
2	A. If I can, if I might, I think what you are
3	asking is why did I go and do my own research in the
4	period after 1970 in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette?
5	Q. Sure.
6	A. Okay. Because the material that I had
7	otherwise from the Pittsburgh Post Gazette did not
8	cover that period. I think what was available to me
9	to look at from other research was not covering the
10	period, I think, actually after 1972.
11	Q. So, anything after 1972 is work that you
12	either did yourself or by someone under your direct
13	supervision?
14	A. Correct.
15	Q. The other paper that you understood Mary
16	Simon to have read was what, sir? We talked about
17	the Pittsburgh Post Gazette. What's the other paper
18	she read?
19	A. Newspaper?
20	Q. Sure.
21	A. The Palm Beach Post.
22	Q. Was there anything specific that you did to
23	find date ranges that you found important in the Palm
24	Beach Post?
25	A. Again, I did a similar verification of
0058
1	material from the Palm Beach Post that I had that
2	others had collected. I went to the Palm Beach Post
3	in the periods, of course, she lived in that area, so
4	I verified, through my own checking material, that
5	covered her time in the Palm Beach area when she
6	would have read the paper.
7	Q. Well, earlier, we were talking about the
8	unknown methodology that was used for the Pittsburgh
9	Post Gazette for the time periods of 1950s to 1972.
10	Do you have any better understanding of the
11	methodology that was employed by whoever it was that
12	pulled articles from the Palm Beach Post?
13	A. Again, I don't have direct information,
14	but I do have my ability to check and see that the
15	methodology used was very similar to the sort of
16	methodology I've used in the past in papers of
17	looking at key dates and times when articles appeared
18	and I was able to verify the quality of that research
19	for myself so that I could use those materials.
20	Q. And if I understood, I apologize, you still
21	don't know what methodology was used for the
22	Pittsburgh Post Gazette for 1950 to 1972, correct?
23	A. Again, I don't know specifically the
24	methodology, but I don't -- that was not significant
25	to me as long as I could verify the quality of the
0059
1	research.
2	Q. When you say not specifically, what
3	generally do you understand to be the methodology to
4	have been used for the selection of articles from the
5	Pittsburgh Post Gazette?
6	A. Based on my review of what I had and what
7	I read in that part of the collection that had been
8	done by someone else, that they collected, as I have,
9	material bearing on the questions about public
10	awareness or discussions of smoking and health in
11	various ways and parts of the newspaper.
12	Q. Well, and the question is how do you know
13	what they decided to include and what they decided to
14	not include or not look for?
15	A. Well, again, I didn't have any insight
16	into their mind, but what I did have was the results
17	of their work, which I could check and verify against
18	research that I had done to be sure that it was
19	adequate in its coverage of the key dates and issues
20	that appeared throughout the nation on this issue.
21	Q. Your opinions in a global sense in this
22	case are what, sir?
23	A. My opinions are that there was widespread
24	public discussion of the dangers of smoking going
25	back as far as the early 20th century, that this
0060
1	information about the dangers of smoking included its
2	effect on the human body, longevity, various diseases
3	as well as the habitual or addictive nature, that
4	that information continued to accumulate over time,
5	and in the 1950s, there was specific focus on the
6	diseases of lung cancer, emphysema, 1950s and 60s, I
7	should say, emphysema, heart disease, as well as
8	other forms of cancer. This information was
9	available in a wide range of forums from print to
10	video to film to cartoons to songs and to education
11	materials, and that it was widely available to the
12	public throughout the nation, widely available in
13	Pittsburgh, and that it was widely available to Mary
14	Simon, and based on the evidence of her life, that
15	she had seen and heard and learned of these
16	connections between smoking and health.
17	Q. Is one of your opinions going to be
18	concerning the high level of public awareness that
19	existed about the dangers of smoking notwithstanding
20	the presence of cigarette advertising and tobacco
21	company statements in the media?
22	A. I certainly saw and looked at company
23	statements. I saw and looked at advertising. I do
24	not believe they change my opinion as I've just
25	expressed.
0061
1	Q. And you're of the opinion regardless of
2	what the tobacco company was saying publicly during
3	the time period, the level of public awareness
4	existed notwithstanding that fact, correct?
5	A. If I could just be more precise to what I
6	had said previously about my opinion, that the level
7	of public information notwithstanding and that I
8	believe a level of public awareness also
9	notwithstanding tobacco company statements.
10	Q. And have you engaged in any review of
11	internal company tobacco documents regarding the
12	dissemination of knowledge regarding the health
13	effects of smoking?
14	A. No. They are not part of my reliance
15	material.
16	Q. And I'm not the first lawyer to have asked
17	you that question in these cases, right?
18	A. I've had that question before.
19	Q. And nothing that we have said in the
20	Plaintiffs bar has spurred you to want to look at
21	company documents?
22	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: So, I mean, based on your
24	previous question, I may have interpreted it in a
25	more specific way. More generally, I would say, I
0062
1	have looked at and looked through sources of
2	company documents to see, in the early stage of my
3	research, to see if any could be of use in
4	answering the question about public awareness. My
5	conclusion was that since these were internal
6	documents, they would not be of use and that I
7	should concentrate my research elsewhere and that
8	included public statements made by physicians,
9	doctors, health experts and tobacco company
10	people.
11	BY MR. HILL:
12	Q. And, so, in terms of your research and
13	opinions in this case, it was not important to you to
14	the extent to which the tobacco industry engaged in a
15	crusade to mislead the public about the health
16	effects of smoking cigarettes?
17	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: Again, I looked at the
19	universe of public information. That included
20	statements by tobacco companies, that that is what
21	I regard as the determinative and important
22	evidence to look at is that this is a question of
23	public knowledge and awareness.
24	BY MR. HILL:
25	Q. And am I understanding correctly that no
0063
1	part of your review of the public awareness
2	considered the fact that that the tobacco industry
3	for decades set about a crusade to create doubt in
4	the minds of addicted smoker?
5	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
6	THE WITNESS: Again, the evidence I saw,
7	whatever may or may not have occurred in the minds
8	of members of the tobacco industry, it was not
9	relevant to the question of what was publicly
10	available and the universe and preponderance of
11	information available to Mary Simon was.
12	BY MR. HILL:
13	Q. I wasn't asking you specifically about the
14	state of mind of the tobacco company executives
15	themselves. What I'm talking about no part of your
16	research included looking at the strategy employed by
17	the tobacco industry to mislead the American public
18	for decades about the health risks associated with
19	smoking?
20	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
21	THE WITNESS: Again, I have no specific
22	information or expertise on that because my
23	research was focused on publicly available
24	information that smokers such as Mary Simon would
25	receive throughout her life. There are many
0064
1	issues that I don't investigate in the course of
2	focusing on what is important.
3	BY MR. HILL:
4	Q. You understand that you have any special
5	expertise in understanding a smoker's acceptance of
6	information that smoking is hazardous to their life?
7	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: I mean, again, except for
9	the specific facts and documents that relate to
10	both the general public and Mary Simon, these are
11	the things that I base my conclusions on. I'm not
12	sure, beyond that, what you are asking.
13	BY MR. HILL:
14	Q. Sure. In terms of the factors that can
15	influence a specific smoker's acceptance of
16	information that smoking is hazardous, that's not
17	something that you have familiarity with, is that
18	accurate?
19	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: Well, I mean, again, I'm not
21	sure --1 certainly look at a variety of factors
22	that are relevant to the life of smokers like Mary
23	Simon as well as specific to Mary Simon's life
24	that lead me to the conclusion that both she
25	exhibited awareness and knowledge of these issues
0065
1	and that that information was pervasive and widely
2	available.
3	BY MR. HILL:
4	Q. Do you see a distinction at all between
5	knowledge and awareness and acceptance?
6	A. Yes, I can see a distinction.
7	Q. All right, and, so, my question is specific
8	to, you know, you've got the universe of knowledge
9	that it's available. You may even have knowledge
10	it's available to an individual, but do you have an
11	understanding or training or education and experience
12	about how different factors can influence a smoker's
13	acceptance of that knowledge?
14	A. I mean, the factors that I look at are the
15	availability of information, the particular
16	circumstances of their lives that make them able to
17	have access to that information, and then any
18	facts -- part of their life that indicates that they
19	did, in fact, receive and knew that information.
20	Q. Do you know what factors influence, say, a
21	smoker's acceptance of the statement that smoking
22	cigarettes can cause lung cancer?
23	A. I mean, again, I think I've just answered
24	the question in terms of how I operate and what I
25	look at and how I draw my conclusions, but beyond
0066
I	that --
2	Q. I'm not talking about methodology, I'm
3	talking about specific factors that can influence a
4	smoker's acceptance of the statement that smoking
5	cigarettes can cause lung cancer.
6	A. Well, I mean, again, I think I've
7	spoken -- hearing and acceptance, just to be on the
8	same page, if you are talking about giving
9	information and available information and even
10	evidence that the information was received and
II	information -- that the person knew the information
12	by their statements, actions and so forth, do I know
13	exactly whether and how and when they would believe
14	it or not, no, I don't get into issues of individual
15	belief.
16	Q. The other newspapers that you have listed
17	on your reliance list, the other 12, are those more
18	for historical context? I mean, you don't plan on
19	putting any of those in Mary Simon's hands, correct?
20	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
21	THE WITNESS: Again, I think some are for
22	context. Some such as the Pittsburgh Press,
23	although the testimony indicates that she was a
24	subscriber to the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, there
25	is some suggestion that she also liked to read
0067
1	Sunday newspapers and Pittsburgh -- the Pittsburgh
2	Post Gazette did not publish a Sunday edition, it
3	was Pittsburgh Press. So it is conceivable that's
4	what they are referring to.
5	The Air Force -- did I say the Air Force
6	Times? Pittsburgh Press. I can't see my own list
7	here -- Pittsburgh Press was also in Pittsburgh
8	and, you know, as I said, beyond the Sunday
9	question, other people that she had contact with
10	may have read the Press. So that's one reason why
11	that's on there.
12	BY MR. HILL:
13	Q. The others -- and I'm not going to try to
14	belabor the point, I'm trying to get through this as
15	quickly as possible. I realize I might be failing in
16	that endeavor.
17	I want to make sure that you don't -- so
18	you talked about the Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh
19	Post Gazette and others. Are there any other
20	periodicals -- I'm focussing on newspapers. Any
21	other newspapers that you have a high degree of
22	suspicion were actually read by Mary Simon?
23	A. Those are the ones that I either think
24	that there's direct evidence that she read them or
25	some indirect evidence that she may have on occasion
0068
1	read them, Pittsburgh Press, Post Gazette and Palm
2	Beach Post.
3	Q. What do you understand Mary Simon to have
4	read in terms of magazines and periodicals and
5	journals?
6	A. The ones I referred to include Reader's
7	Digest and LIFE, and I think under my number B7,1
8	think there's some also Look magazines there and I
9	think there were references that may have had Look
10	magazine at some time.
11	Q. What's your understanding as to when Mary
12	Simon read -- the periods inclusive of when Mary
13	Simon was reading the Reader's Digest?
14	A. Again, the testimony is from people who
15	knew her when they lived with her as children, so
16	that's the period from '40, mid to late 40s
17	presumably forward. It's less clear before that if
18	she read it.
19	Q. The other was LIFE Magazine?
20	A. Yeah.
21	Q. In that the question?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. What is --
24	A. Again, I think in the same time period,
25	same time frame, based on what we see, seems likely
0069
1	she read it in the period from late to mid 40s
2	forward. She may have read it before that, but
3	that's what the facts that I have indicate.
4	Q. Page 2 of your reliance list, paragraph F,
5	Florida archival public health and legislative
6	materials?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. All of those seem to be before Mary Simon
9	would have moved to Florida, do you agree?
10	A. It seems that way, I believe. Yes, at
11	least the ones that are specifically -- yes, I don't
12	see any from -- it's a little unclear when she moved
13	to Florida, '84 or '87, but seems like all the
14	materials here are before the earliest date that I
15	have for her in Florida.
16	Q. Since you haven't been provided with the
17	medical records, I won't quarrel on you on when it
18	was she moved to Florida.
19	The audio/visual materials, is there
20	anything that you can tell us within a reasonable
21	degree of probability in the field of history that
22	you can put actually in Mary Simon's hands or ears?
23	A. So I think, with respect to specifically
24	to Mary Simon, what she saw in a more certain way, I
25	would put some of the television news broadcasts
0070
1	based on testimony she was an avid watcher of
2	television news and was very conversant with current
3	events. So the indications are she was a regular
4	watcher of television news broadcasts.
5	Q. And that's probably -- well, no, are there
6	any specific broadcasts where you are going to be
7	able to say to the jury more likely than not Mary
8	Simon saw this broadcast?
9	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
10	THE WITNESS: I can't think of individual
11	ones that I can state she definitely or probably
12	or more than likely saw. I can simply say she
13	watched television news regularly and these are
14	some of the things that were available for her to
15	see.
16	BY MR. HILL:
17	Q. What's the significance of polling material
18	that you have on your reliance list?
19	A. Again, further evidence for context of
20	understanding, you know, levels of public information
21	and awareness, of the levels of public awareness of
22	the information that I reviewed. It provides another
23	piece of evidence as to my conclusion that these
24	materials were widely distributed and read and seen
25	by the public.
0071
1	Q. Is there anything on your reliance list
2	that includes advertising by tobacco companies?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. All right. What specifically have you
5	undertaken to collect advertisements from cigarette
6	manufacturers in any particular time period?
7	A. So the material that includes
8	advertisements would be the newspapers and magazines.
9	Q. Am I correct that there was never a
10	conscientious effort to locate advertisements for
11	cigarettes, it would be sort of an ancillary finding,
12	would you agree with that?
13	A. No, no, I wouldn't.
14	Q. So you talked about the methodology that
15	you are aware of specific date ranges -- excuse me,
16	specific dates for the time periods that were of
17	interest to you and tell me what date periods that
18	you went looking for cigarette advertising for, let's
19	say, the Palm Beach Post or the Pittsburgh Post
20	Gazette.
21	A. So, in the course of the research that I
22	did and in the course of research that I collected
23	from others had done, generally, advertisements were
24	a part of that corpus of information as they were
25	part of material appearing in the -- using the
0072
1	broadest criteria, appearing in the paper related to
2	cigarettes and smoking, not all of which, of course,
3	were specifically on cancer or health, but there's
4	actually material besides advertising that's about
5	other aspects of smoking. That material would have
6	been collected as the part of universe of information
7	that someone would have seen in reading the paper or
8	magazine, including advertisements.
9	Q. You have a number of Surgeon General
10	reports as well, sir?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. Significance of those for you was what,
13	sir?
14	A. So, the most significant one was the 1964
15	Surgeon General's report which was, again, part of
16	the public awareness of the dangers of smoking as
17	well as -- I'm sorry, I'm going to forget the date --
18	I think it's the '89 Surgeon General's report.
19	Again, publications by health authorities that were
20	widely discussed in the media at the time they came
21	out and also I believe widely distributed throughout
22	the country to physicians and others. So they were
23	part of this information world informing the public
24	about the various dangers of smoking.
25	Q. And do you understand that, based upon the
0073
1	research that you've done, that each and every time a
2	Surgeon General report came out that addressed
3	smoking and health, there was a response by the
4	tobacco industry?
5	A. I can't say sitting here that I know that
6	each and every time, but I certainly have seen
7	responses by the tobacco industry to Surgeon
8	General's reports as part of reporting on that event.
9	Q. And you understand that the tobacco
10	industry, although it's not your understanding that
11	they would do it all the time, but at least some of
12	the time, they would come out with press releases
13	condemning Surgeon General reports having to do with
14	smoking and health?
15	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
16	THE WITNESS: I mean, again, I've seen
17	responses by tobacco companies to different
18	Surgeon General's reports as part of the
19	information that I collected discussing their
20	response or the action or opinion on.
21	BY MR. HILL:
22	Q. But do you understand that, based on your
23	research, that the responses were not favorable to
24	the Surgeon General report; you can acknowledge that,
25	correct?
0074
1	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: I mean, these are pretty
3	subjective words. I would say that they offered
4	an opinion, sometimes offered what I would take to
5	be criticisms of aspects of the report and that
6	they stated their opinion that was, at least to
7	come extent, different than the opinion of the
8	Surgeon General.
9	BY MR. HILL:
10	Q. Would you be prepared to acknowledge that
11	they would actually condemn the Surgeon General's
12	reports?
13	A. Condemn is, I think, a very loose term. I
14	think you'd have to maybe look at a specific document
15	and talk about whether condemned is the right word.
16	I would be leery of using kind of general language
17	without talking about her specific example of such
18	language.
19	Q. Have you engaged in any efforts to catalog
20	the tobacco industry's responses to the various
21	Surgeon General reports that were published beginning
22	in the 1960s?
23	A. No, I didn't undertake such a task. I
24	rather collected, during the course of my research,
25	statements by the tobacco companies as part of the
0075
1	public record of the information and discussions
2	about smoking and health.
3	Q. Well, when you talk about those date ranges
4	or those specific dates that you looked at as having
5	some importance, did you undertake any efforts to
6	categorize what would happen when a Surgeon General's
7	report would come out in terms of smoking and health,
8	what the response by the tobacco industry would be?
9	A. Well, again, in the dates that I include,
10	I believe that they include if not every Surgeon
11	General's report, certainly many of those, and the
12	ones that were specially widely discussed, then I
13	would look at the paper for that date and other dates
14	around it in which there were, you know, articles and
15	other materials discussing that report and that that
16	would certainly include any statements made by
17	tobacco companies or others.
18	Q. The Surgeon General's reports on your
19	reliance list that go all the way to 2006, what's the
20	significance of Surgeon General reports after Mary
21	Simon's death?
22	A. I think part of it is simply trying to be
23	thorough in collecting such information over time.
24	Also since this is a general reliance list, there are
25	possibly other cases in which a person was alive in
0076
1	2006, so bearing in mind this is a reliance list that
2	both includes specifically material that they have
3	discussed as well as Mary Simon's life as well as the
4	corpus of my research that informed me broadly about
5	the issues throughout the nation as well as different
6	parts of the nation.
7	Q. There have been Surgeon General reports
8	after 2006, you are aware of that, right?
9	A. I believe so.
10	Q. All right. Is there any particular reason
11	why you haven't included any from, say, 2010 and most
12	recently 2014?
13	A. I think partly it's just that as a
14	historian, I'm mostly focused on the past rather than
15	the present. The Surgeon General's reports that go
16	into more recent times might be relevant in a
17	particular case, but I'm not primarily collecting
18	contemporary information, I'm collecting historical
19	information.
20	Q. Isn't that also contained in the Surgeon
21	General reports, that is there are oftentimes
22	historical analysis contained in the Surgeon General
23	reports that would be contrary that, as a historian
24	in this case, would be interested in?
25	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
0077
1	THE WITNESS: There could be, but bear in
2	mind that I largely, you know, on the basis of my
3	opinions I form through my own research, not other
4	people's research, that's to say not research done
5	by other historians or by other entities.
6	BY MR. HILL:
7	Q. You've got some books here. What's the
8	significance, say, of the Kellogg book from 1922; why
9	did you feel that important to list on your reliance
10	list?
11	A. The John Harvey catalog, is that the one
12	we are talking about?
13	Q. Yeah, that's the one. "Tobaccoism: How
14	Tobacco Kills."
15	A. Yeah, I think that's, again, from --in
16	this case, that is a book that was widely circulated
17	by a very popular health figure from that era, so I'm
18	using that as a primary source. That is, if you
19	lived in the 1920, you know, this is a person who
20	spoke quite a bit about issues of health, including
21	issues of tobacco, and published his work and spoke
22	before Congress. So he represents -- in that world,
23	he represents part of the complete information.
24	MR. DAVIS: That may have thrown the train
25	of thought there.
0078
1	THE WITNESS: I think I completed. I
2	think the train of thought was that took John
3	Harvey Kellogg's writings were publicly available
4	information to people living at that time.
5	BY MR. HILL:
6	Q. And the title, "Tobaccoism: How Tobacco
7	Kills," do you understand Kellogg to have been
8	writing about essentially the addictive nature of
9	smoking cigarettes?
10	A. I'm trying to recall. It's a fairly
11	lengthy book, but I believe he does talk about
12	various ways in which using tobacco in various forms,
13	you know, has very negative effects on the human
14	body, leads to early death, and I believe actually he
15	does talk about -- although I'm trying to really
16	recall from memory here --1 believe he actually does
17	talk about the sort of habitual or habit-forming
18	nature of tobacco in that case.
19	Q. You've got cases of materials and a bunch
20	of photographs of you and somebody else and I had no
21	idea what the significance of those photographs were.
22	To help you, they were taken in December of last
23	year. What's the significance of those photographs ?
24	A. So these are photographs that I took with
25	my research assistant Jessica, who is the person
0079
1	pictured there, partly just, you know, documenting
2	our research, partly -- most of the photographs
3	actually are of places that Mary Simon either grew up
4	or lived with her family or lived as an adult when
5	she was in Pittsburgh.
6	Q. So what was -- for you, as a historian
7	offering opinions in this case, what is significant
8	about your having visited some places that Mary Simon
9	was in the 30s and 40s and 50s up to the 70s or 80s?
10	A. So I think two things. One, in the early
11	part of her life, to get a sense of the world in
12	which she grew up in and where she lived and the
13	community. I think very basic type of historical
14	research that's often done.
15	And, then, I think for the later period
16	after she was an adult was to get a sense of where
17	she lived in relation to the City of Pittsburgh,
18	which is where much of the research that I did and
19	much of the materials being produced -- much of the
20	materials that she had seen were produced.
21	Q. So there's a picture of a red brick house
22	up on a hill dated 12/6/2013. Whose house is that,
23	what house is that?
24	A. I think if we are on the same page, I
25	believe that was the house she lived with her
0080
1	husband. I can't remember what date she may have
2	moved, but that was one of the house that she lived
3	as an adult after 1942. Again, I would have to look
4	and -- go back and look at the depositions to figure
5	out exactly what dates she was there.
6	Q. So you understood that to have been the
7	house she ultimately loss following the death of her
8	husband because she couldn't make the mortgage
9	payments?
10	A. Again, what I learned from the depositions
11	is roughly she have lived in a house and that was one
12	of the addresses that she lived at a point in her
13	life. I don't have in front of me the information to
14	tell you the exactly the dates she lived there.
15	Q. Did visiting any of the houses in which
16	Mary Simon previously lived provide you with any
17	insight or knowledge as to any of the issues in this
18	case?
19	A. Well, again, I think given that Pittsburgh
20	is a major city nearby her and it's a major source of
21	her information through news and television and it's
22	where she worked and it's where she had grown up, I
23	think it is significant to understand that, you know,
24	where she lived in relation to the city at other
25	times.
0081
1	Q. Are there any opinions that you have in
2	this case that we haven't talked about, sir?
3	A. I think I've covered everything. I
4	believe you can always refer to my disclosure, which
5	if I've missed anything, I'm sure it's covered there.
6	Q. The last book that you published had to do
7	with corporate responsibility?
8	A. It was a history, yes.
9	Q. And in researching a book on corporate
10	responsibility, did you happen to include anything
11	with respect to the tobacco industry in the last
12	hundred years or so?
13	A. Just to describe the book a little bit, to
14	be clear, this is not a history of individual firms
15	or companies, though there are a number of firms,
16	companies and industries mentioned, and I believe
17	there are a couple of references at different times
18	about tobacco; I think less individual firms and
19	perhaps the industry at the level of the industry.
20	Q. And not having read your book yet, is there
21	anything in there in which to opine about the
22	corporate responsibility of the tobacco industry at
23	any point in the last hundred years?
24	A. So I believe there are two sentences,
25	perhaps two and a half sentences, that mention
0082
1	tobacco. And I think it's important to note that, as
2	this was a collaborative effort with three other
3	coauthors as well as an overall editor and, so, I did
4	not write every part of the book, I wrote certain
5	chapters. As I recall, since you are asking about my
6	writing, the specific parts of book that I wrote did
7	not include anything about tobacco.
8	Q. And the book that bears your name entitled,
9	"Corporate responsibility," that has two and a half
10	sentences devoted to the tobacco industry, give me
11	the flavor of what those two and a half sentences
12	say, sir?
13	A. So I think that, you know, it's better if
14	I guess we had it in front of us, but trying to
15	recall. I believe what the book discusses in
16	relation to tobacco is that tobacco was one of a
17	number of controversial products that there were a
18	variety of voices that discussed proper way to handle
19	tobacco, including some people who would, you know --
20	I believe I'm actually going beyond what the book
21	says. It really says that tobacco was one of a
22	number of products that was subject to criticism at
23	different periods of time. I think mostly in the
24	period 1970s and 80s was the period discussed.
25	Q. The book on Baker and Botts, a Houston law
0083
1	firm, how was it that you became interested in that
2	firm?
3	A. Going back quite far. So, it came about
4	as a result of a colleague, a former student of my
5	own professor, who had been contacted by the law firm
6	that -- to write a history -- basically to write a
7	history of the firm for its, perhaps, 150th
8	anniversary, and I had just finished my education and
9	this person contacted me and asked if I would join
10	him in working on this project as a coauthor.
11	Q. It was work, I don't know if commissioned
12	is right word, that was commissioned by the Baker
13	Botts law firm?
14	A. Yes, exactly. It was work --1 worked
15	under a contract to assemble and write and then have
16	published that history.
17	MR. HILL: Just crossing things off my
18	list. I think I'm about done.
19	That's all the questions I have for you.
20	Thank you.
21	MR. DAVIS: Jack, do you mind, I need to
22	take a bio break. I'm going to need to ask a few
23	questions myself.
24	MR. HILL: Okay.

2	CROSS EXAMINATION
3	BY MR. DAVIS:
4	Q. Dr. Lipartito, can you tell us what you do
5	for a living?
6	A. Yes. I'm a historian and I'm a professor
7	of history at Florida International University.
8	Q. How long have you been teaching history?
9	A. Well, I think I got my first job in 1988.
10	Q. And what position do you hold at the
11	Florida International University?
12	A. I'm a full professor, and until just this
13	last month, I was the department chair.
14	Q. How long did you hold the position of chair
15	at the Department of history at the Florida
16	International University?
17	A. I had been chair for the previous four and
18	a half years.
19	Q. And for purposes of this case, can you
20	describe for us briefly what you were asked to do for
21	this case?
22	A. Well, in this case, I was asked to review
23	materials and do research that would help me to
24	determine what -- the information available to the
25	public and, more specifically, to Mary Simon
0085
1	concerning smoking and health over the course of her
2	life as well as to perpetualize that in the larger
3	picture of public information and awareness of the
4	smoking and health over the previous century or so.
5	Q. Now, do you have? In terms of the
6	qualifications that assist you in that task for this
7	case, do you have a master's degree in history?
8	A. I do.
9	Q. Do you have a Ph.D in the field of history?
10	A. I do.
11	Q. And when did you get your master's degree
12	and your Ph.D?
13	A. I believe the master's degree was awarded
14	in 1982 and the Ph.D in 1986.
15	Q. Where did you receive the master's degree
16	from and where did you receive your Ph.D from?
17	A. I received both of them from the John
18	Hopkins University in Baltimore.
19	Q. And you mentioned that you are a history
20	professor at Florida International University. What
21	courses do you teach there?
22	A. I teach a variety of courses on 20th
23	century America, modern America since 1945. I teach
24	courses on business history and economic history,
25	teach courses in historical methodology and
0086
1	historical research. I've taught courses in history
2	of technology and a number of other topical areas.
3	Q. Have you taught college courses in which
4	the history of tobacco and cigarette use have been a
5	topic?
6	A. They have certainly come up in courses, in
7	the 20th century courses, American politics and
8	culture, or the regulation of business at various
9	times.
10	Q. Now, have you authored any publications
11	that have been published in peer-reviewed journals?
12	A. Yes, I have a large number of
13	peer-reviewed articles and books.
14	Q. Are those listed on your curriculum vitae
15	or CY?
16	A. They are.
17	Q. And can you tell us briefly what is a CY,
18	what is it supposed to represent?
19	A. A CY is the course of life of an academic
20	beginning with their education and including their
21	awards, honors, publications and services as a
22	professional.
23	(Defendant's Exhibit 1, curriculum vitae,
24	was marked for Identification.)
25
0087
1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. I'm going to hand you what's been marked as
3	Exhibit 1 to your deposition and ask if you could
4	identify that.
5	I'll hand you, Dr. Lipartito, what's been
6	marked as Defendant's Exhibit 1 and ask if you can
7	identify that document for us, please.
8	A. Yes. That's my curriculum vitae.
9	Q. And does that reflect the publications that
10	you have authored?
11	A. It does.
12	Q. Does it also reflect the awards that you
13	have received in the field of history?
14	A. It does.
15	Q. Have you received any grants, fellowships
16	or other awards for your work as a historian?
17	A. I have.
18	Q. And can you briefly describe what those are
19	for us?
20	A. So I've received a variety of research
21	grants, including some from the National Science
22	Foundation, the American Council of Learned
23	Societies, the National Endowment for the Humanities.
24	I've received some for my research at the Hagley
25	Museum and Library. I've also received grants from
0088
1	the U.S. Department of Education, the Florida
2	Department of Education. I've received fellowships
3	from Harvard Business School, and I've received
4	grants from the Alfred Sloan Foundation and a variety
5	of other institutions.
6	Q. Have you served as a peer reviewer and
7	judge of written work in the field of history?
8	A. Yes, in various capacities.
9	Q. Have you done that for peer-reviewed
10	journals when you are analyzing the historical work
11	of others ?
12	A. Yes, many times.
13	Q. What historical journals have you served as
14	a reviewer or a judge of other's written work in the
15	field of history?
16	A. I'm not sure I can name them all off the
17	top of my head, but I've worked as a peer reviewer
18	for the American Historical Reviewer, the Journal of
19	American History, the Business History Review, the
20	Journal of Economic History, I believe the British
21	Journal of Economic History, and I was also the
22	editor-in-chief of the Journal Enterprise and
23	Society.
24	Q. And for how many years have you been doing
25	research on the topic of public awareness of the
0089
1	health risk of smoking ?
2	A. So I began, I think, in the middle of 2005
3	and, so, it must now be -- my math will fail me for
4	the moment, but 2005 to beginning of 2014, so good
5	nine years.
6	Q. Approximately how many hours have you spent
7	doing research on the issue of public awareness of
8	the dangers of cigarette smoking?
9	A. Yes, that's a very large number. I would
10	say it must be in the -- getting in close to 2,000
11	hours by now.
12	Q. And approximately how many hours did you
13	spend analyzing issues with respect to the Mary Simon
14	case?
15	A. Although I'm still to some extent
16	continuing my work there, but I think the latest
17	number I have in mind is about a 150 hours,
18	130 hours, something in that range.
19	Q. Dr. Lipartito, is there a recognized method
20	by which historians study and analyze the past?
21	A. Yes, there is.
22	Q. What's that method called?
23	A. Well, I think, generally, the historical
24	method.
25	Q. Would you briefly describe the historical
0090
1	method, please?
2	A. So historian's primary task is to find
3	documentary evidence, written or visual or other
4	forms, that comes from the time periods of study that
5	can provide evidence that answers specific questions
6	that historians bring to the past.
7	Q. And when you are attempting to look at
8	the -- use the historical method, do you have to
9	first formulate the issue that you want to
10	investigate?
11	A. Yes. I think I said the research is done
12	in relation to a question that the historian
13	formulates that they would like the answer to.
14	Q. Then how do you go about analyzing the
15	question after you arrive at the -- after you arrive
16	at what the issue is you want to analyze?
17	A. So the first step, after one sort defines
18	the research question, is to consider the material
19	that would be relevant to that question and focus on
20	such material. In particular, I should make clear
21	that historians distinguish between primary and
22	secondary research, primary research being, as I
23	mentioned, the documentary evidence from the time
24	period in the question that bears on the issue topic
25	or question under study, secondary literature being
0091
1	the writings of others, other historians, on similar
2	or related topics.
3	Q. After you analyze primary and secondary
4	sources, do you then analyze that material?
5	A. Right. So the task is to collect the
6	material that is most relevant to the research, often
7	leading to additional research, which I think is very
8	similar to the methods that we've just discussed in
9	this case. To then bring that material together for
10	review, to essentially bring together of the pieces
11	of evidence in order to analyze it, and then form a
12	conclusion.
13	Q. Can you explain how historians weigh
14	different sources using the historical method?
15	A. Well, I think there is a variety of ways.
16	One way is to look at material that's in the correct
17	time frame, chronological. Another way is to look at
18	evidence that comes from what might be considered
19	more objective sources. Another way is to consider
20	the source of the evidence itself as to why it was
21	created, how it was created and when it was created.
22	Those are methods that are useful for understanding
23	the quality of the research materials that are being
24	generated by the research.
25	Q. Are all sources created equal?
0092
1	A. No. I think it very much depends on the
2	topic in question. Of course, different topics will
3	lend themselves to different sources and different
4	sources will lend themselves to different topics, but
5	it's important to focus on the material best suited
6	to the issue in question that one is addressing.
7	Q. In order to render a reliable conclusion on
8	a historical issue, do you have to look at every
9	piece of paper that exists on that subject?
10	A. I think that would be impossible. In
11	essence, the possible sources of history are nearly
12	infinite and no progress could ever be made.
13	Historians make -- based on their understanding of
14	the topic and their accumulating evidence and
15	information over time, make decisions as to where
16	they can best concentrate their efforts to get
17	evidence that's most relevant to the questions that
18	they are addressing.
19	Q. Does the historical method require that a
20	historian read everything that has ever been printed
21	on a particular subject?
22	A. Again, I think that would be impossible
23	and also in some ways confusing because it would
24	include all sorts of extraneous material that is not
25	necessarily useful for answering the question. In
0093
1	fact, one of the things I have to teach my students
2	is to be wary of allowing themselves to be
3	overwhelmed by the volume of research and to be
4	analytical and concentrate their efforts on material
5	that's going to be most useful for their question.
6	Q. How does a historian know when to stop --
7	let me back up for a second.
8	Is it consistent with the historical
9	method not to look at every particular article or
10	publication on a particular subject?
11	A. Right, again, I think one needs sufficient
12	evidence to be informed on the topic. There's some
13	background work, but I think trying to read
14	everything is, again, one of those unprofitable moves
15	that doesn't lead to either progress or an ability to
16	actually come to clear conclusions.
17	Q. And how do you know when to stop reviewing
18	and analyzing sources using the historical method?
19	A. There's a variety of measures. One of the
20	most common is one starts to see repetition of the
21	same information or the same basic ideas or
22	conclusions are being borne out by further evidence,
23	there's essentially no additional information to be
24	gleaned.
25	A second way that I think is useful is
0094
1	when one sees the same information pointing to the
2	same conclusions from multiple types of sources in
3	multiple things.
4	A third way would be to look at
5	information chronologically when one sees, again, the
6	same issues coming up or the same information
7	pointing to the same conclusion consistent over a
8	period of time.
9	Q. So does consistency play a role in looking
10	at historical sources?
11	A. Yes, definitely.
12	Q. And why do you historians follow the
13	historical method?
14	A. Well, I think, without it, one ends up
15	with, first of all, no ability to judge or weigh the
16	quality of sources. Secondly, one ends up with a
17	vast sea of information that adds up to no clear
18	conclusion because it's not pertinent or germane to
19	the issue being investigated. And then, of course,
20	like all research, historians want to be able to
21	confirm their conclusion was a substantial body of
22	evidence relevant to what they are studying.
23	Q. Do you use the historical method when
24	researching for writing any of your books and your
25	publications that have been on your CV ?
0095
1	A. Yes. I think this is the only method
2	that's appropriate for quality professional history.
3	Q. Do you teach your students to use the
4	historical method as you've described it today?
5	A. Yes, absolutely. I teach courses in both
6	methodology and specifically research courses that
7	help students learn how to practice what I've just
8	described.
9	Q. Does the historical method, as you've
10	described it, permit you to reach accurate and
11	reliable opinions and conclusions about the past?
12	A. So I think following the historical method
13	and applying it appropriately allows historians to
14	conclude, to a degree of historical certainty, one
15	that's acceptable by professional historians who
16	practice it to make conclusions that can be firm and
17	clear and certain.
18	Q. Are you familiar with the term "historical
19	context"?
20	A. I am.
21	Q. What does that mean?
22	A. Historical context is an essential part of
23	the historical method. It involves looking both at
24	the specific evidence for what it is that one is
25	studying but also requires a historian to look around
0096
1	that evidence to other things that were occurring
2	either in the same time period or in the same place
3	or in similar types of texts or evidence. So that
4	one understands the significance and meaning of a
5	particular document by relating them to other
6	documents that are in the same historical universe.
7	Q. Why is context, or another way to say it
8	the big picture, important to a historian?
9	A. I think two reasons. Most important is to
10	avoid anachronism, which is incorrectly interpreting
11	documents or evidence by not understanding the
12	meaning or significance or place of them in the time
13	period one is studying, often done by applying very
14	contemporary current ideas to the past, one of the
15	classic historical fallacies.
16	A second reason is simply with greater
17	context, one understands the particular in relation
18	to the whole and sees it either as something very
19	unique or something very common, so that one has a
20	way of judging its significance in relation to other
21	things happening in history at that moment.
22	Q. How do individual events fit into the big
23	picture?
24	A. Well, historians look at individual events
25	and often that's some of the basic substance of
0097
1	history, but, of course, individual events are part
2	of a larger narrative or story of things unfolding
3	over time, changing over time, moving to new states
4	over time. So historians put events into context and
5	then put them into time or motion chronologically to
6	see how they developed greater understanding of those
7	events.
8	Q. Are you familiar with the phrase "reading
9	history backwards"?
10	A. Yes, I am.
11	Q. And can you give an example of what that
12	phrase -- how that phrase is used and applied?
13	A. Well, off the top of my head, I'll give it
14	some thought. I think it is similar to what I just
15	described as kind of an anachronism that is the
16	applying of contemporary ideas or standards
17	inappropriately to other moments in the past.
18	I suppose a common example might be
19	something like if one were reading about, you know --
20	oh, one were reading about families a hundred years
21	ago and one made an assumption that the role of women
22	and women working in the labor force work is the same
23	as it was today, then one might fail to understand
24	that a hundred years ago women were more commonly not
25	working, they were more likely to be home and,
0098
1	therefore, the idea that women's roles were much
2	different a hundred years ago than they are today.
3	BY MR. DAVIS:
4	Q. And as a historian, how does the frequency
5	of people's use of a newspaper compare to the use of
6	newspapers in the early and mid 20th century?
7	A. Right, so this --
8	MR. HILL: Object to the form.
9	THE WITNESS: This is, again, I think an
10	example for context and avoiding anachronism or
11	reading history backwards comes into play. Going
12	back in time even 50 years or 30 years, newspapers
13	were the one of the main sources of information
14	that people had. They were widely subscribed to,
15	they were common sources of information for daily
16	discussions about events of the day. They were
17	essentially in an era when there was no internet,
18	where there were no other kind of common forms of
19	social media, when even television was still a
20	rather young medium, and there were limited number
21	of stations and channels that one could see on the
22	television. Newspapers formed an essential part
23	of the daily life and source of information for
24	citizens.
0099
1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. Did you follow the historical method as
3	you've outlined for us today in reaching your
4	opinions and conclusions in this case?
5	A. Yes, I stuck very closely to that method.
6	Q. Did you use the same type of approach you
7	used to do historical research on topics other than
8	smoking and health?
9	A. Yes. I think the general principles and
10	historical methods can be applied to any topic even
11	though the materials one looks at or the topic under
12	discussion may change.
13	Q. And for this case, what questions did you
14	research?
15	A. So the primary question that I researched
16	was about public knowledge and awareness of an issue
17	that had long been before the public, which was the
18	question of smoking. The question that extends back
19	in time, at least in my research at least a hundred
20	or more years, and, of course, extends forward in
21	time coming closer to the present, what were the
22	sources of information and what did that information
23	say about smoking and health, and then I specifically
24	looked in this case at the places and contexts of
25	Mary Simon's life and evidence about what she would
0100
1	have seen in relation to information about smoking
2	and health.
3	Q. Did your research for this case include
4	public awareness about the dangers of smoking?
5	A. It did.
6	Q. And what are the different ways that
7	information about the dangers of smoking have been
8	communicated during Mary Simon's lifetime?
9	A. A wide variety, wide variety. We have
10	already discussed newspapers. I would include in
11	that other print media such as magazines, also very
12	commonly read and taken into the home in the period
13	Mary Simon lived. I looked at television materials,
14	I looked at movies, and what I would call popular
15	culture, which could include songs, could include
16	television programs, cartoons, things that are part
17	of everyday life. I looked at information relevant
18	to education and schooling, both in the period in
19	which she was in school and even in the period in
20	which her children would have been in school as well.
21	I reviewed materials produced by a variety
22	of organizations concerned about smoking and health,
23	such at the American Cancer Society, the American
24	Lung Association, American Heart Association, various
25	public authorities in both Pittsburgh and Florida
0101
1	where she lived, and I reviewed material that was
2	specifically from the facts of the case such as
3	depositions by her friends and family members.
4	Q. Now, one of the --1 think one of the
5	exhibits that's been marked to your deposition is
6	what's called your reliance list?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. Does that reliance list include information
9	about public awareness of smoking during Mary Simon's
10	lifetime?
11	A. Yes, most definitely, including, I think,
12	all sources that I just listed as well as a number of
13	others.
14	Q. And for the materials that you found which
15	were created either before or during Mary Simon's
16	life, are those materials the type of materials that
17	historians typically or routinely rely upon to answer
18	historical questions?
19	A. Yes, absolutely. Newspapers, magazines,
20	laws, publications, I've looked at these or similar
21	types of materials in other contexts and they are
22	materials that I often suggest my students look at
23	depending on their topics.
24	Q. And does that information include public
25	service announcements that public health authorities
0102
1	issued during Mary Simon's lifetime about the dangers
2	of cigarette smoking?
3	A. Yes. I do have a number of public service
4	announcements that were produced in the period in
5	which she was alive.
6	Q. Did you conduct any sort of systemic review
7	of tobacco company documents as part of your research
8	in this case?
9	A. Again, as I mentioned, historical method,
10	the important thing is to, at a very early stage,
11	make sure that one has aligned one's research topic
12	and questions with the appropriate sources. I did
13	determine that internal company documents, as opposed
14	to public statements, internal company documents
15	could not help me answer these questions in the same
16	way that internal documents from other organizations
17	would not be useful, that in order to understand the
18	public information that someone like Mary Simon could
19	have seen and would have seen, one must go to sources
20	that are available to the general public, not to
21	private sources or to sources that are internal to
22	organizations or bodies.
23	Q. And if a tobacco company statement reached
24	the public, for example, in a newspaper or magazine
25	article, would you have considered that in forming
0103
1	your opinions in this case?
2	A. Yeah, absolutely. All statements, all
3	information that bore on the questions of smoking and
4	health were a part of the universe of research that I
5	did.
6	Q. And with respect to the specific materials
7	that you looked at and analyzed for your opinions in
8	this case, did that include educational materials
9	that were in effect during the time that Mary Simon
10	was either in elementary or grade school, middle
11	school and high school?
12	A. It did, specifically in relation to her
13	life in Pittsburgh and specifically both in terms of
14	her connections with public schools and possibly with
15	Catholic parochial schools, and did extensive
16	research and reviewed curricular textbooks and other
17	material that discussed health, education and,
18	specifically, smoking and health.
19	Q. Are the materials that you gathered which
20	are on your reliance list dealing with educational
21	materials or textbooks that would have been in effect
22	in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area for the time
23	period that Mary Simon was either in elementary
24	school, middle school or high school the type of
25	materials that historians typically or routinely rely
0104
1	upon to form opinions ?
2	A. Yes, absolutely. These are materials that
3	are often found, as was the case in Mary Simon's,
4	research on Mary Simon, selected in archives and
5	repositories for historians to examine them to
6	recreate in this case the sort of educational
7	curriculum and experiences that someone growing up in
8	Pittsburgh would have had.
9	Q. With respect to --1 think you described
10	that you looked at -- did you look at newspaper
11	articles for -- that appeared in the Pittsburgh area
12	newspapers during the time that Mary Simon lived in
13	the Pittsburgh area?
14	A. I did. I did look at newspapers,
15	especially the newspapers that she seemed to be more
16	closely acquainted with during her time in
17	Pittsburgh.
18	Q. Did you look at newspapers that Mary Simon
19	would be acquainted with when she lived in Florida?
20	A. I did, basically from what I understood
21	where she lived, I looked particularly at the Palm
22	Beach Post, although I also have on my list a variety
23	of other Florida newspapers during that same time.
24	Q. With respect to the materials that were on
25	your reliance list that were available during Mary
0105
1	Simon's lifetime, did you consider just one source of
2	that reliance material?
3	A. No, and I think this is sort of one of the
4	fundamental principles of historical method and
5	research, that one should look to a variety of
6	relevant sources and I believe, in fact, one of the
7	parts of the method that we discussed already was
8	that in order to be able to bring research to a
9	conclusion, rather than simply try to read everything
10	forever, one uses the principle of the same
11	information or similar information pointing to the
12	same conclusion appearing in multiple forms or
13	multiple media. So I had to rely on a variety of
14	sources and variety of types of sources in order to
15	have --in order to bring my research to a conclusion
16	to form my opinions.
17	Q. Did you travel to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
18	as part of your research?
19	A. I did. I took two trips to Pittsburgh for
20	research.
21	Q. And did you attempt to read everything that
22	has ever been written about the subject of smoking
23	and health?
24	A. Again, if I had tried that, I would never
25	have left Pittsburgh, I'd still be there. Again, I
0106
1	focused in on a combination of variety of sources. I
2	was able to identify, based on what I understood
3	about Mrs. Simon's life, the sorts of institutions
4	and sources that she would have been acquainted with
5	and I focused my attentions there in order to
6	reconstruct her universe of information about smoking
7	and health.
8	Q. Can you estimate the amount of information
9	you found on the dangers of smoking as a result of
10	your research -- let me say that a little bit
11	differently. Strike that.
12	Can you estimate the amount of information
13	you found on the dangers of smoking and health that
14	existed during Mary Simon's lifetime as a result of
15	your research?
16	A. Well -
17	MR. HILL: Objection to form.
18	THE WITNESS: Yes. I mean, I think we
19	start with the specific and move outward, which is
20	a useful way to do this, I think. We begin with
21	the specific things she would have been exposed to
22	when she was a young, young child or a young
23	woman, so there was substantial material from the
24	educational research that suggested that she would
25	have had courses on smoking -- courses on health
0107
1	that discussed smoking and the dangers of tobacco.
2	We then look at the things that we have
3	evidence that she read, such as magazines and
4	newspapers in her adult life from approximately
5	1950 or so forward. Again, we see many, many
6	articles over the course of that time discussing
7	the dangers of smoking as well as mentioning
8	specific diseases linked to smoking, seeing more
9	evidence about ways in which people can quit
10	smoking or how they can stop smoking or help they
11	can get to alleviate smoking.
12	So, when you add all that up together, you
13	know, it's hard to give a single number, but I
14	would say hundreds if not thousands of items in
15	media and newspaper related to the issue and, of
16	course, one has to expand out the context and look
17	at what was also being discussed beyond the narrow
18	location in Pittsburgh, in the national media as
19	well as Florida where she also lived, and one
20	starts to see literally tens of thousands of items
21	that, over time are, discussing the various ways
22	in which smoking is harmful.
23	BY MR. DAVIS:
24	Q. While were you reviewing the information
25	that was available to Mary Simon regarding the health
0108
1	risks of smoking, were you only interested in sources
2	that you could show she had seen?
3	A. No. I think that becomes impossibly
4	narrow, in part because we don't really know what
5	anyone -- even if someone kept a diary of everything
6	they did by the hour, it's almost impossible to know
7	what people saw and were exposed to in their life. I
8	think by bringing together a wide range of sources,
9	first of all, one has confidence that one is
10	capturing things that she's -- that collectively
11	represent things that she saw or would have seen.
12	And, secondly, of course, people don't
13	live in a vacuum, they are surrounded by other
14	people, they are -- they have people that they speak
15	to or are friends who themselves are reading or
16	finding out about the same thing. One of the most
17	common means of information transmission is
18	person-to-person. If we know that, in addition to
19	what Mary Simon saw, all those around her from other
20	sources saw similar things, again, one has greater
21	confidence that the information was both widely
22	available and was being communicated.
23	And I think that's -- the third level of
24	that is that these were items of great public
25	discussion across the land and every community,
0109
1	again, reinforcing the sense that if one is a citizen
2	in the United States, working and living, it becomes
3	almost impossible to imagine someone missing or not
4	hearing or not seeing this information throughout
5	their life.
6	Q. And your use of the historical method in
7	this case, were you able to obtain enough consistent
8	information in your research that would allow you to
9	reach opinions and conclusions regarding the
10	information available to Mary Simon in the community
11	she lived in concerning the dangers of smoking ?
12	A. Yes, I found quite a bit of information.
13	Q. Have you been able to form an opinion to a
14	reasonable degree of professional certainty about
15	whether or not Mary Simon had information available
16	to her during her lifetime concerning the dangers of
17	smoking?
18	A. Yes, I think based--
19	MR. HILL: Let me interpose an objection.
20	This is obviously designed to elicit opinion
21	testimony from this expert and this deposition was
22	not cross-noticed by you, Todd. So, to the extent
23	that you have aspirations of reading this
24	discovery deposition to the jury, I would object.
25
0110
1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. Have you been able to -- so what was your
3	answer, Doctor?
4	A. Let's -- could you repeat?
5	Q. Have you been able to form an opinion to a
6	reasonable degree of professional certainty about
7	whether or not Mary Simon had information available
8	to her during her lifetime concerning the dangers of
9	smoking ?
10	A. Yes. Following the historical method as I
11	did, reviewing all the material and analyzing all the
12	material, I concluded with historical certainty that
13	the level that a professional historian can be
14	certain about the conclusions, that Mary Simon was
15	aware of and exposed to and aware of information
16	about the risks of smoking during her life.
17	Q. Have you been able to reach a similar
18	opinion on whether -- strike that.
19	Have you been able to reach an opinion on
20	whether Mary Simon had information available to her
21	during her lifetime about the addictiveness or
22	habit-forming nature of smoking?
23	A. Yes. My review of the materials showed
24	very clearly that the discussions of the dangers of
25	smoking from a very early period, going back to the
0111
1	early part of 20th century continuing throughout the
2	time of Mary Simon's life, that one of the health
3	risks of smoking discussed consistently and
4	thoroughly in this material was the habit forming or
5	addictive nature of tobacco.
6	Q. Now, can we agree that, for the opinions
7	that you offer today, that you will do so to a
8	reasonable degree of professional certainty?
9	A. Yes. I feel confident as a professional
10	historian that my conclusions are supported properly
11	by my research method and analysis as a historian.
12	Q. Based on the amount and type of information
13	you discovered in your research, do you have an
14	opinion as to how difficult it would have been for
15	someone living in the time period and places that
16	Mary Simon lived to have missed the information about
17	the dangers of smoking or the addictiveness or
18	habit-forming nature of smoking cigarettes?
19	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: The best way perhaps I can
21	do that is by comparing to other topics that I've
22	researched and I believe this was in the period of
23	Mary Simon's life one of the, you know, most
24	heavily covered issues, comparable to other top
25	issues of the day. I've often thought of it in
0112
1	comparison to my own research on history of the
2	space program, landing on the moon, which was
3	written on. I would put this in the same category
4	that essentially one was living in the United
5	States in this period and conscious, one would
6	have seen this information about the dangers of
7	smoking repeated multiple times over the course of
8	one's life.
9	BY MR. DAVIS:
10	Q. Where did Mary Simon grow up?
11	A. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
12	Q. What year was she born?
13	A. 1918 is what I recall.
14	Q. When Mrs. Simon was born, did Pennsylvania
15	have any law that prohibited sales of cigarettes to
16	minors?
17	A. Yes, I believe they did at that time.
18	Q. And do we know where Mary Simon attended
19	school?
20	A. Okay. We don't know exactly the school,
21	but the evidence indicates strongly that, at least
22	for her primary years of schooling, she attended a
23	Catholic school, though it remains a possibility she
24	may have attended a public school. Likewise, we
25	don't know exactly which school she attended in
0113
1	Pittsburgh for secondary education, possibly a
2	Catholic school, possibly a public school, but we do
3	know from the evidence that she did complete and
4	graduate from high school.
5	Q. And on your reliance list, were you able to
6	identify the textbooks that were in place in either
7	the public school system during the time that Mary
8	Simon attended school as well as the textbooks that
9	were in effect at the time if Mary Simon attended a
10	Catholic school?
11	A. Yes. I do.
12	MR. HILL: Let me interpose an objection,
13	Todd. You all have moved for 48 hours'notice
14	before any documents are introduced at trial. To
15	the extent that you have aspirations of reading
16	this to the jury, I would object to any references
17	to any materials in violation of the 48-hour rule.
18	MR. DAVIS: I don't think that applies to
19	deposition.
20	MR. HILL: Yeah, well, you haven't
21	cross-noticed this at all and there's been
22	absolutely no notice provided to us that you had
23	aspirations of taking a trial testimony deposition
24	for your expert to lives in South Florida rather
25	than calling him live. To the extent that you
0114
1	have aspirations of doing that, we object.
2	MR. DAVIS: Well, I think the depositions
3	is permitted to be used under the Florida rules
4	and that's what we intend to use it for.
5	BY MR. DAVIS:
6	Q. Anyway, based upon your research that you
7	did for this case, Dr. Lipartito, did you learn
8	anything about the quality of the educational system
9	offered by Catholic orphanage in the Pittsburgh area?
10	A. Yes, actually, I did, especially with the
11	possibility that she may have lived in an orphanage
12	at least at some point in her childhood. I did do
13	research at the diocese of Pittsburgh. I was able to
14	investigate the history of both Catholic education
15	and Catholic orphanages in the Pittsburgh area during
16	that time.
17	Q. And based upon your review of that
18	material, did you form any opinions about the quality
19	of -- as a historian, the quality of the orphanages,
20	the Catholic orphanages -- let me try to clean it up.
21	A. Sure.
22	Q. Based upon your research and your expertise
23	as a historian, did you form any opinions about the
24	quality of the orphanages, Catholic orphanages, in
25	the Pittsburgh area during the time period that Mary
0115
1	Simon would have been in them as a child?
2	A. Yes.
3	MR. DAVIS: Objection, previously
4	undisclosed opinion.
5	THE WITNESS: Yes. So, yes, that was part
6	of my research into her educational background and
7	I discovered, actually, Pittsburgh had a very good
8	system of orphanages, placing a lot of emphasis on
9	education and training of those under their care,
10	that they also worked closely with both the public
11	schools of Pittsburgh and the social services of
12	Pittsburgh in order to help train and educate
13	those who were institutionalized.
14	BY MR. DAVIS:
15	Q. Before we get into the educational material
16	specifically, how would you describe the level of
17	activity in Pittsburgh related to issues of smoking
18	and health during the time period that Mary Simon
19	lived there?
20	MR. DAVIS: Objection.
21	THE WITNESS: Well, I think, generally,
22	like we've seen in other cities, comparable
23	cities, that there were a wide range of
24	institutions and individuals that were discussing
25	smoking in various ways that were concerned about
0116
1	the health effects of smoking going back to the
2	1920s and 30s as well as, of course, continuing
3	into the later periods, the 50s and 60s when she
4	was an adult.
5	BY MR. DAVIS:
6	Q. How would you compare the level of activity
7	in the Pittsburgh area to the issue of smoking and
8	health during the time that Mary Simon lived there
9	compared to other cities during that same time frame?
10	MR. DAVIS: Objection to form.
11	THE WITNESS: Pittsburgh, I think, was a
12	city that had two important institutions related
13	to the health issues. One, it had a very
14	well-developed social services network and system,
15	in part because it was a manufacturing city. This
16	was the time that steel mills -- there was a great
17	concern about things such as diseases caused by
18	smoking and pollution as a result of the steel
19	mills. They had very strong medical facilities at
20	the University of Pittsburgh and at Carnegie
21	Mellon University. So it was actually very
22	closely connected with developments in public
23	health, especially related to diseases of the
24	lungs. Surgeon General of the United States
25	during the Roosevelt administration had been a
0117
1	public health doctor at the University of
2	Pittsburgh.
3	So my sense is that Pittsburgh was
4	actually somewhat at the forefront of discussing
5	public health and diseases generally, and that
6	helped it to have a basis for dealing with the
7	issue of tobacco and smoking perhaps more so than
8	some other smaller communities would have.
9	BY MR. DAVIS:
10	Q. And for the textbooks that you located that
11	would have been used in either the Pittsburgh private
12	schools or the Catholic schools during the time
13	period that Mary Simon was either in grade school,
14	middle school or high school, can you tell us what
15	those textbooks discussed about the dangers of
16	smoking?
17	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form, 48 hours'
18	notice, hearsay.
19	THE WITNESS: Yes, so textbooks, health
20	textbooks in this period during the time which she
21	was in school discussed a variety of issues. Very
22	commonly, they would talk about the effects of
23	tobacco on the heart or on the circulatory system
24	or on the digestive system. They would discuss
25	the possible consequences of smoking for human
0118
1	life span, those who smoked did not live as long.
2	For health, generally, that those who smoked were
3	not as healthy as those who didn't. They
4	discussed the sort of habitual nature of tobacco,
5	indicating that those who began smoking often
6	found it very difficult to stop smoking.
7	Usually tobacco was discussed in sections
8	in health books that dealt with alcoholism and
9	drug, so it was considered to be one of the sort
10	of dangerous substances that one -- that if
11	children needed to be warned about could be
12	detrimental to their well-being.
13	(Defendant's Exhibit 2, Health and
14	Happiness by Francis Dore, was marked for
15	Identification.)
16	BY MR. DAVIS:
17	Q. I'm going to hand you what's been marked as
18	Exhibit 2. Can you tell us what this document is,
19	please?
20	A. Yes.
21	MR. HILL: Todd, can I be favored with a
22	copy of whatever is being provided?
23	MR. DAVIS: Sure, sure. We will see if we
24	can get it sent to you in a couple minutes. I can
25	tell you what -- would you want me to tell you
0119
1	what it is now? It's on the reliance list.
2	MR. HILL: Yeah, absolutely.
3	MR. DAVIS: Yeah, it's the Dore textbook
4	that's called "Health and Happiness," which you
5	have discussed with him earlier.
6	MR. HILL: Is it the whole thing or just
7	the excerpts that are included on the reliance
8	list?
9	MR. DAVIS: It's the excerpts on the
10	reliance list.
11	Yeah, I think it's --
12	MR. HILL: The one I've got in front of me
13	is 19 pages.
14	MR. DAVIS: That sounds right. I haven't
15	counted them specifically, but it starts with
16	chapter -- it has a preface, then it goes to
17	Chapter 21 after the content.
18	MR. HILL: It does, right.
19	MR. DAVIS: All right. So do I need to
20	send it to you or no?
21	MR. HILL: No, no, I've got it.
22	And, obviously, I mean, not to interrupt
23	your flow entirely, can I have a continuing
24	objection to use of any materials in violation --
25	in my objection that it violates the 48-hour rule?
0120
1	MR. DAVIS: Sure. I think we have stated
2	our positions on that and we just disagree. And
3	just so you don't have to say it every time, I
4	recognize that you've made that objection for all
5	the exhibits.
6	MR. HILL: Sure, and that this wasn't
7	cross-noticed by you for use at trial, you
8	understand that as well?
9	MR. DAVIS: I understand that's your
10	position, all right.
11	MR. HILL: That's all I ask.
12	MR. DAVIS: Yes.
13	BY MR. DAVIS:
14	Q. Okay. So, Doctor, can you tell us what
15	Exhibit 2 is, please?
16	A. So this is a copy of Health and Happiness
17	by Francis Dore. It's a textbook that was used in
18	Catholic health classes, Catholic school health
19	classes and, specifically, this was the textbook I
20	discovered that was used in health classes in
21	Pittsburgh Catholic schools.
22	Q. What time period was this textbook used in
23	Catholic schools in Pittsburgh in relationship to
24	Mary Simon?
25	A. I was able to examine evidence from the
0121
1	diocese of Pittsburgh archive that showed this
2	textbook was used in the period of time in which Mary
3	Simon would have been in elementary school, so, from
4	the early 1920s through the early to mid 1930s, which
5	would have covered the time in which she would have
6	read this book.
7	Q. And, so, does this textbook, the Dore
8	textbook, discuss health effects from smoking?
9	A. Yes. There are a number of sections that
10	discuss various aspects of smoking and its effects on
11	the body, particularly with trying to warn the
12	readers and the students about the ill health effects
13	of consuming tobacco.
14	Q. You mentioned that the media was another
15	source of information available to the public about
16	health risks of smoking. Did I understand that
17	testimony correctly?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. And during the 1920s, 30s and 40s when Mary
20	Simon was growing up, was any information regarding
21	the health dangers of smoking made available to the
22	public in the printed media?
23	A. Yes, variety of printed sources had
24	extensive coverage of what was known at that point
25	about the health effect of smoking.
0122
1	Q. Did the popular magazines cover these
2	developments with regard to the health dangers of
3	smoking going back to the 1920s?
4	A. Yes, even before in some cases.
5	Q. Are you familiar with a magazine by the
6	name of Reader's Digest?
7	A. I am.
8	Q. What kind of magazine is Reader's Digest?
9	A. This was a popular feature magazine that
10	had articles on a variety of subjects that one could
11	subscribe to the magazine. It came monthly, I
12	believe, and there are 30 articles of various sorts.
13	At various times in history, in the 20th century, I
14	believe it was the largest circulation magazine or
15	general interest popular magazine in the country.
16	Q. What kind of circulation did it have in the
17	1950s?
18	A. I don't have a number in mind, but I think
19	that was when it was approaching its height, so it
20	may well have been the number one magazine at the
21	time.
22	Q. Is there any evidence that Mary Simon read
23	Reader's Digest?
24	A. Yes, there is. Several of her family
25	members testified this was a magazine she regularly
0123
1	read or subscribed to.
2	Q. Did Reader's Digest publish articles about
3	the health risks of smoking before and during Mary
4	Simon's lifetime?
5	A. Yes, they published a number and a variety
6	of articles on that subject.
7	Q. What kind of information did Reader's
8	Digest articles have on the issue of cigarette
9	smoking ?
10	A. Of course, depends on the time period. If
11	you go back to the earlier time periods, there's
12	discussions about, like in the textbooks, the dangers
13	in terms of heart, in terms of human life span.
14	There's also discussions about the difficulty of
15	quitting smoking or which suggests its addictive
16	nature. There's discussions about how to quit and
17	what steps one should take when one wants to quit.
18	Then, in the 1950s, there is a series of
19	articles discussing the research that linked smoking
20	to lung cancer as well as to other cancers and
21	maladies in the 50s and 60s and continuing forward.
22	Q. How far back in time did Reader's Digest
23	cover the health risks of smoking ?
24	A. I think the first article that I recall
25	was 1924.

2	"Does Tobacco Injure the Human Body", was marked for

4	BY MR. DAVIS:
5	Q. Let me show you what's been marked as
6	Exhibit 3. And, Jack, this is the 1924 piece from
7	Reader's Digest called, "Does Tobacco Injure the
8	Human Body."
9	Dr. Lipartito, can you identify Exhibit 3
10	for us?
11	A. Yes.
12	MR. HILL: I'm sorry, I didn't realize I
13	was on mute. Let me see if I can find it. I
14	think -- if you don't have a problem waiting until
15	I see the actual exhibit, right?
16	MR. DAVIS: No, not at all.
17	MR. HILL: On my list, there's 307
18	Reader's Digest articles. Is there some way you
19	can clue me in on which one? There's titles,
20	there's numbers.
21	MR. DAVIS: Yeah, I think it's AIW then
22	000117.
23	MR. HILL: They are all like -- the
24	numbers start up with 19 -- for example, 196405,
25	405A, B.
0125
1	MR. DAVIS: I don't know. How about if I
2	e-mail it to you?
3	MR. HILL: Sure.
4	All right, I got it. Go ahead. Thank
5	you.
6	BY MR. DAVIS:
7	Q. Doctor, can you tell us what Exhibit 3 is,
8	please?
9	A. It's an article -- it's a copy of both the
10	front page and then an article from the Reader's
11	Digest from 1944 entitled, "Does Tobacco Injure the
12	Human Body."
13	Q. Again, what year is that again?
14	A. 1924.
15	Q. Okay. Now, let me hand you what's been
16	marked -- this is going to be a Composite Exhibit 4.
17	This is consisting of one, two, three,
18	four, five articles from the Reader's Digest.
19	And, Jack, these are -- they are in the
20	materials that Nathan sent.
21	MR. HILL: What Nathan sent was one
22	article.
23	MR. DAVIS: Okay. I'm sorry, I'll see if
24	I can get--well, he'll get you the others? Just
25	one second.
0126
1	MR. HILL: Yeah, I mean, obviously I'd
2	object to going forward without having a copy of
3	the exhibit that you are questioning the witness
4	on.
5	MR. DAVIS: Okay. Well, we will -- let me
6	tell you what it is. If you look at there's one
7	that's going to be called, "On Giving Up Smoking,"
8	that's from the February 1935. There's another
9	one from --
10	MR. HILL: Todd, I don't have the ability
11	to, in the way in which the materials were
12	produced to me by y'all, to find -- there's no
13	date range that I can go on and search. So,
14	absent you sending it to me, I don't have the
15	ability to needle in the haystack search through
16	it for 300 Reader's Digest articles.
17	MR. DAVIS: Why don't we go off the record
18	for a second and I'll see if we can send it to
19	you, okay?
20	MR. HILL: Sure.
21	(Off the record.)
22	BY MR. DAVIS:
23	Q. Dr. Lipartito, did the coverage of Reader's
24	Digest continue into the 1950s on the issue of the
25	risks of smoking?
0127
1	A. Yes, very much so, changed to reflect new
2	information and new warnings and health research that
3	came out, but it continued consistently in that
4	period.
5	Q. All right.
6	(Plaintiffs Composite Exhibit 4, Reader's
7	Digest articles, was marked for Identification.)
8	BY MR. DAVIS:
9	Q. I'm going to hand you what's going to be
10	Composite Exhibit 4 and ask if you can identify that
11	document for us.
12	A. So these are additional Reader's Digest
13	articles that I examined in the course of my
14	research. Would you like me to read the titles?
15	Q. Yes, please.
16	A. So the first one is called, "The Human
17	Balance Sheet of '34."
18	Q. I think there's the article inside.
19	A. Oh, and as part of that issue, there's an
20	article called, "On Giving Up Smoking."
21	Q. Okay. What's the next one?
22	A. This is Reader's Digest from 1938 and it
23	contains an article, "So You're Going to Stop
24	Smoking."
25	Q. Okay, and are the remaining articles in
0128
1	Composite Exhibit 4 additional Reader's Digest
2	articles that discuss the risks of smoking?
3	A. Yes. Let's see, I think I have two more
4	and -- no, three more, and they are from various
5	periods from '40 to '44, different articles on
6	different aspects of smoking, health and related
7	issues.
8	Q. Is there an article from 1952 in Reader's
9	Digest called, "Cancer by the Carton" ?
10	A. Yes, there is.
11	Q. Okay. Were there other magazines in the
12	1950s major magazines that covered the issue of
13	smoking and health?
14	A. Yes, there were -- well, actually, a large
15	number, but I specifically looked at the major news
16	and popular magazines of that period like Look
17	magazine, Time, Newsweek and others of that sort.
18	Q. And just so we are clear, what date range
19	do we have for the articles in Reader's Digest that
20	are marked for Exhibit 4?
21	A. Oh, so let's see one article from 1935, an
22	article from 1938, we have an article from 1940 and
23	an article from 1941, and one more looking for a
24	date -- sorry, it's a little -- looks like 1944.
25	(Plaintiffs Composite Exhibit 5, Reader's
0129
1	Digest articles, was marked for Identification.)
2	BY MR. DAVIS:
3	Q. I'm going to hand you what's been marked as
4	Exhibit 5.
5	Jack, I'll tell you what they are before I
6	hand them to him. It's AS995, AN610, AS915, AIT211,
7	AS936, AS938, AS940, AS941.
8	MR. HILL: All right. Let me pull those.
9	(Off the record.)
10	BY MR. DAVIS:
11	Q. Dr. Lipartito, I'm going to hand you what's
12	been marked as Composite Exhibit 5 and ask if you can
13	identify that collection of documents for us?
14	A. So, yes. These are articles from Reader's
15	Digest, the first one is dated January 1950.
16	Q. And were these articles in Reader's Digest
17	that discuss the issue of risks of smoking or health
18	effects from smoking?
19	A. I'm going to double check here. I think
20	they all are. There's a combination of topics
21	addressed from cancer to advice on how to quit to
22	other -- to general issues about smoking and health.
23	Q. Was this material that you found in your
24	research going back into -- looking back at
25	information that was publicly available about the
0130
1	risks of smoking?
2	A. Yes, this is exactly that information.
3	Q. You don't have to go through each one, but
4	can you give us some examples of the titles of the
5	articles that are marked as Exhibit 5?
6	A. Sure. This is a January 1950 article
7	called, "How Harmful Are Cigarettes," which is very
8	extensive coverage of the issue at that point in
9	time.
10	I think another one that I could point to
11	would be the 1952 article called, "Cancer by the
12	Carton," which discusses the various studies that
13	have come out near the 1950s linking cancer smoking
14	to lung cancer. This is often one that's referred to
15	in the media as an article that many people were
16	discussing, so it's one of the, I think, major
17	issues.
18	Just to give a flavor of some of the
19	others, 1954 article called, "The Facts Behind the
20	Cigarette Controversy," another review of research
21	and issues in smoking and health.
22	And then some variety of what else could
23	be found. This is an article on nicotine
24	specifically in smoking.
25	And another one called, "The Growing
0131
1	Horror of Lung Cancer," which has within it a number
2	of references to the connections between smoking and
3	lung cancer.
4	And I think there's another article in
5	there about how to quit smoking as well.
6	(Defendant's Composite Exhibit 6, LIFE
7	magazine articles, was marked for Identification.
8	BY MR. DAVIS:
9	Q. Okay. Let me hand you what's going to be
10	marked as Exhibit 6 to your deposition, again, it's a
11	composite.
12	And, Jack, this is AS999 and AIW225. They
13	are two excerpts from LIFE Magazine.
14	(Off the record.)
15	BY MR. DAVIS:
16	Q. Doctor, I'm going to hand you a composite
17	exhibit of two articles that's been marked as
18	Exhibit 6, Defendant's Exhibit 6. Can you identify
19	those for us, please?
20	A. These are articles from LIFE Magazine,
21	another popular magazine at the time.
22	Q. What's the date of each of the articles?
23	A. So, let's see, one is December 21, 1953
24	and the other is July 5, 1954.
25	Q. What is discussed in each of these
0132
1	particular LIFE Magazine articles?
2	A. Take a look. Oh, yes, okay. So the
3	1951 -- sorry, 1953, December 21st, article is a
4	discussion of the research of doctors Evarts Graham
5	and Ernest Wynder, who were conducting some of the
6	early research on smoking and lung cancer, and
7	it's -- as is typical in LIFE Magazine, it's both a
8	text discussing the research and the connections they
9	found to smoking and cancer as well as a pictorial
10	essay with images of them doing their research. I
11	believe, actually, in the original, it's color; those
12	copies are black and white.
13	Q. Okay, and how about for the 1954 LIFE
14	Magazine article?
15	A. So this is also text and, in this case,
16	cartoon imagery of -- it's a discussion of the
17	American Cancer Society's reports that link smoking
18	to shortened life. So it's a report, again, in this
19	case it's Drs. Cuyler Hammond and Daniel Horn who did
20	studies for the American Cancer Society that some of
21	the results appear in the 1954, other results
22	appeared a bit later, but this was the '54 result.
23	And also contained within -- besides a discussion of
24	that research, some reference to ways of stopping
25	smoking. In fact, the title is, "This week's topic,
0133
1	how do I swear off," meaning how do I quit smoking.
2	And in addition to the text discussing
3	those issues, there's also images as well that
4	reference various popular culture terms about smoking
5	such as coffin, coffin nails and other images
6	discussing the connection between smoking and health.
7	Q. Is there evidence in this case that Mary
8	Simon received LIFE Magazine?
9	A. Yes. Her children remember LIFE Magazine
10	as being one of the ones in her home when they were
11	growing up.
12	Q. Okay. Put those aside.
13	How would you describe the level of
14	coverage in the Pittsburgh press about the health
15	risks of smoking in the 1950s?
16	A. Yeah, so the Pittsburgh press, I assume
17	you mean the newspapers, not the specifically the
18	Pittsburgh newspaper called the Press?
19	Q. That's correct, yes. I'll rephrase it.
20	How would you describe the level of
21	coverage in the Pittsburgh newspapers about the
22	health risks of smoking in the 1950s?
23	A. I would characterize it as extensive and
24	thorough.
25	Q. Why would you describe it that way?
0134
1	A. Because from an early point, like I've
2	seen in the magazines that we just discussed, there
3	was discussion of scientific research and findings.
4	There were articles about various studies that link
5	smoking to diseases. There were also articles of a
6	more general sort that talked about the public debate
7	and awareness of smoking. There were articles about
8	how to stop smoking and they appeared not just in
9	news stories but they appeared in health columns,
10	they appeared in advice columns, they appeared as
11	feature stories about health and other contexts. So
12	it was covered in both extensively over time as well
13	as in a variety of formats within the newspapers.
14	MR. DAVIS: I'm going to hand you what's
15	been marked as exhibit -- before I do that, Jack,
16	let me give you another series of numbers, okay?
17	MR. HILL: Okay.
18	MR. DAVIS: ANS4166, ANS4168, ANS4173,
19	ANS4200, ANS6121, ANS4211, ANS4186, ANS6125,

1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. Dr. Lipartito, I'm going to hand you what's
3	been marked as Defendants Exhibit 7 and ask if you
4	can identify those documents which make up that
5	exhibit?
6	A. Yeah, I believe these are all articles
7	from the Pittsburgh Post Gazette and they run, it
8	looks like, from 1950,1 think the last one might be
9	'57 or '58.
10	Q. Are those articles that appear in either
11	the Pittsburgh Post Gazette or the Pittsburgh Press
12	in the 1950s?
13	A. Yes. I can see they are all Pittsburgh
14	Post Gazette.
15	Q. Take a look at the last one.
16	A. This one looks like -- at least two of
17	them, several of them are also from -- okay, so I'm
18	wrong. About half of them are from the Pittsburgh
19	Post Gazette and looks like the other half are from
20	Pittsburgh Press.
21	Q. What do these articles discuss about the
22	risks of smoking?
23	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
24	BY MR. DAVIS:
25	Q. Let me back up. Do these articles discuss
0136
1	the potential health risks from smoking ?
2	A. Yes, they do.
3	Q. What are some of the titles of the
4	headlines?
5	A. So these are -- let me see, "Lung Cancer
6	Blamed in Part on Cigarettes," "Smoking called Cancer
7	Peril," "Lung Cancer Deaths Linked to Smoking,"
8	"Cancer of the Lung Caused By Cigarettes, Doctors
9	Told." And, actually, these range from reports that
10	are kind of national news, that is similar to what we
11	saw in the magazines, as well as some that are more
12	locally oriented discussing doctors within
13	Pittsburgh.
14	And then there's a whole series on cancer
15	research that links smoking to cancer, quite a few of
16	the various reports. Also talking about heart
17	disease in some of the others that's been linked to
18	smoking and, yes, continuing research that was coming
19	out in the 50s on further research of various sorts.
20	And then looks like one article is a
21	health column article that appeared in Pittsburgh
22	Press called, "Stop Smoking," which talked about a
23	program that one can follow to stop smoking,
24	informing readers about that.
25	And then another one is an article about
0137
1	1,500,000 quit smoking habit and it's discussing
2	research from the health service talking about how
3	many Americans have quit smoking, and I think the
4	date on that is like 1955.
5	Q. So did these -- are these articles examples
6	of Pittsburgh newspaper articles that discussed
7	either health effects or dangers of smoking or
8	medical research which had announced a link between
9	cigarette smoking and cancer?
10	A. Yes, exactly.
11	MR. HILL: Object to the form.
12	BY MR. DAVIS:
13	Q. And did you see -- did you find evidence in
14	these newspaper articles for the Pittsburgh Press and
15	the Pittsburgh Post Gazette that discuss that smokers
16	were quitting because of concerns about the health
17	effects of smoking?
18	A. Right. So --
19	MR. HILL: Form.
20	THE WITNESS: As I said, a number of them
21	are typical of the reports on lung cancer and
22	smoking and covering -- continuing coverage in the
23	50s about various research by medical authorities
24	linking smoking to cancer as well as other
25	diseases. And then several of them are, again,
0138
1	examples of what appeared in other parts of the
2	paper at other times about ways to stop smoking.
3	And then one of them, again, it's information
4	reporting studies that have been done showing that
5	people are quitting smoking.
6	BY MR. HILL:
7	Q. Did the articles in the 1950s that were
8	published in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette and the
9	Pittsburgh Press discuss that cigarette smoking was
10	either addictive or habit forming or difficult to
11	quit?
12	A. Yes.
13	MR. HILL: Object to the form.
14	THE WITNESS: A couple ways in which that
15	appeared. It would appear, especially in articles
16	discussing people's attempts to quit or wanting to
17	quit or how to quit, that would talk about the
18	difficulties of quitting smoking once one had
19	picked up the habit and, so, would talk about the
20	addictive nature of it.
21	BY MR. DAVIS:
22	Q. Now what's been marked as exhibit --
23	Defendant's Exhibit 7, are these the only articles
24	that appeared in the Pittsburgh area newspapers about
25	the risks of smoking during the 1950?
0139
1	A. No. This is just a small sample of the
2	larger set that I have.
3	Q. As a historian, what did these newspaper
4	articles that you -- let me strike that.
5	Did Mary Simon receive either the
6	Pittsburgh Post Gazette or the Pittsburgh Press?
7	A. Again, the facts of the case and testimony
8	by her family indicate that she was a subscriber to
9	the Pittsburgh Post Gazette.
10	Q. And can you look at -- let me hand you what
11	is a copy of Jay Simon's deposition. Did you read
12	Jay Simon's deposition in the case?
13	A. I did.
14	Q. Let me hand you page 126 and 127 and ask
15	you if you could just read that to yourself.
16	A. All right.
17	Yes.
18	Q. Is there evidence in the case that Mary
19	Simon received the Pittsburgh Press?
20	A. It's a little unclear. He discusses that
21	she remembered the Post Gazette and then -- the son
22	of Mary Simon says may have also read the Pittsburgh
23	Press, in fact, actually looking at it a little more
24	carefully, it seems like at some point they received
25	the Press because he discusses an afternoon paper and
0140
1	my understanding is that the Pittsburgh Press was the
2	afternoon paper.
3	Q. Okay. Were there statements in the
4	1950s -- strike that.
5	Were there statements in the Pittsburgh
6	area newspapers, the Pittsburgh Post Gazette or the
7	Pittsburgh Press, from the tobacco industry and their
8	reaction to any of the studies that had been
9	conducted?
10	A. Yeah, there were, on occasion, statements
11	from the tobacco industry.
12	Q. And how often did you see tobacco company
13	statements in the newspaper, in magazine articles you
14	researched for this case?
15	A. If one looks at the entire body of
16	material I looked at, then I would say it was
17	relatively small percentage depending on the medium.
18	Paper magazine, it could be 10 percent, it could be
19	less. Now that's in the 1950s. I looked at that
20	over time and the appearance of statements from the
21	tobacco companies does change over time and I
22	detected that the statements and the reporting of
23	statements in public media of tobacco companies
24	decreased over time.
25	(James Smith exited the room.)
0141
1	MR. DAVIS: Jack, let me give you another
2	series of exhibits, okay? Ready?
3	MR. HILL: Yep.
4	MR. DAVIS: AKM1271, AKM1295, AKM1286,
5	AKM1285, AKM1284.
6	(Off the record.)
7	(Defendant's Composite Exhibit 8, print
8	advertisements, was marked for Identification.)
9	BY MR. DAVIS:
10	Q. I'm going to hand you what's been marked as
11	Composite Exhibit 8 and ask you to identify what that
12	exhibit is.
13	A. So this is an exhibit of -- this is an
14	exhibit of advertisements from different -- these are
15	print advertisements from different publications.
16	Q. And what do the print advertisements
17	reflect, what product is being advertised in the
18	composite of Defendant's Exhibit 8?
19	A. These are -- they are all for alcoholic
20	beverages of different sorts, beer and bourbon.
21	Q. Based on your research as a historian, are
22	you aware that products such as alcohol were
23	advertised during the -- in print advertisements
24	during the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s?
25	A. Yes, and, indeed, I think even before and
0142
1	after, but in the period I did research, I did see
2	quite a number of advertisements in the journals and
3	papers looked through that were for alcoholic
4	products.
5	Q. And are these examples which have been
6	marked as Exhibit 8 -- strike that.
7	Are the ads which have been marked as
8	Exhibit 8 examples of the types of advertisements for
9	alcohol that you've run across over the years?
10	A. Yes. Some, I recall, perhaps even
11	specifically seeing in one of the newspapers I've
12	read. These are, I think, quite typical of the
13	general period.
14	Q. And when you've done your historical
15	research, have you come across ads for alcohol that
16	focused on smoothness or taste?
17	A. Indeed, that is one of the more common
18	framings of the advertisements for alcohol,
19	especially hard liquor.
20	Q. In your review of newspapers and magazines
21	as a historian, do you recall ever seeing ads for
22	alcohol products that used women models ?
23	A. Yes, beer advertisements in particular and
24	then, in different periods, other types of alcoholic
25	beverages as well.
0143
1	Q. In your review of newspapers and magazines
2	that you -- as a historian, did you see alcohol ads
3	that contained celebrities and sports figures?
4	A. Again, I think for alcohol and, indeed,
5	for a wide range of products, using celebrity
6	endorsements was very common in the material I saw.
7	Q. In your review --
8	MR. HILL: I'd like to interpose an
9	objection here. I don't think any of this was
10	previously disclosed in terms of this expert
11	having opinions about the advertising regarding
12	alcohol.
13	BY MR. DAVIS:
14	Q. In your review of newspapers -- and you can
15	have a standing objection on that, Jack; you don't
16	have to object to every question.
17	In all of your review of newspapers and
18	magazines as a historian, do you recall seeing ads
19	for alcohol products that used comic style graphics?
20	A. Yes, that's certainly in different periods
21	that was quite popular for advertising.
22	Q. With respect to the information you've been
23	able to gather from the materials you reviewed in
24	this case, can you tell us what you've learned about
25	Mary Simon's life in the 1960s?
0144
1	A. So I believe in 1960 her husband died.
2	You know, she still had at least one child living at
3	home. I know she changed addresses at a certain
4	point. I can't recall exactly when and where she may
5	have moved. She began to work outside the home --
6	actually, she had when she was a young unmarried
7	woman as well. I think she worked in a hospital for
8	a while and then she worked in Pittsburgh, I think,
9	for a credit bureau.
10	Q. And then in the 1960, did the materials you
11	reviewed give you any information about --
12	information that Mary Simon told any of her children
13	about the risk of smoking?
14	A. I think it was in that period, either the
15	late 50s or early 60s, when at least one of her
16	children began to smoke or was detected as smoking
17	and she told her that she shouldn't smoke and that
18	she would become hooked on cigarettes, and as I
19	understood it, this was taken by the child she was
20	speaking to as concern about smoking harming her
21	health.
22	Q. During the 1960s, was that the first
23	Surgeon General's report to come out on the issue of
24	smoking and health?
25	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
0145
1	THE WITNESS: I believe it was first
2	specifically on that topic of smoking and health.
3	1964 Surgeon General's report appeared -- Surgeon
4	General's report on smoking and health appeared in
5	1964.
6	BY MR. DAVIS:
7	Q. Are you familiar with when the first
8	Surgeon General's report on the issue of smoking and
9	health was issued?
10	A. I believe it's January 12, 1964.
11	Q. And what kind of press coverage did the
12	1964 Surgeon General's report receive nationally?
13	A. So this was an extremely well-covered
14	event, indeed; it wasn't just covered at the time of
15	its release. It was released on a Saturday, but it
16	was covered in the weeks and months leading up to the
17	release. There was debate and speculation about
18	findings in the report, and then it was covered that
19	weekend as well as into the following week and,
20	indeed, months later, it's continued to be covered.
21	Q. Did the Pittsburgh newspapers cover the
22	issue of the 1964 Surgeon General's report before
23	that report was issued?
24	A. They did. I think I recall an article
25	that may have been in December, may have been some
0146
1	earlier discussions when the committee that
2	constituted the Surgeon General's investigatory team
3	was formed. That was fairly typical of newspapers,
4	but certainly in the days and weeks leading up to the
5	official release of the report, there was discussion
6	and even, at that point, I believe it was very either
7	known or very strongly suspected that the findings
8	would indicate smoking was a health hazard, and that
9	was reported in the Pittsburgh papers as well.
10	MR. DAVIS: Jack, go to ANS6409.
11	Do you have it?
12	MR. HILL: Nope, looking for it.
13	MR. DAVIS: It's December 1, 1963.
14	(Off the record.)
15	MR. DAVIS: It's a Pittsburgh Press
16	article dated December 1, 1963.
17	MR. HILL: Sure. If someone could send me
18	that, that would be great.
19	MR. DAVIS: In the interim, I'm going to
20	ask him the questions.
21	MR. HILL: I don't think so. I think if
22	we were sitting in trial, I would certainly be
23	entitled to a copy of whatever exhibit has been
24	handed to the witness, and the fact that you have,
25	without any notice, decided to make this your
0147
1	trial deposition doesn't prejudice me and my
2	ability to have a copy simultaneously. So I'm
3	going to insist that we wait.
4	MR. DAVIS: But you do have a copy; it was
5	provided weeks ago.
6	MR. HILL: Along with, you know, probably
7	conservative 10,000 other pages and, so, that
8	isn't particularly helpful. Which is why, I
9	think, the reason why you file a motion for
10	48 hours' notice that you, I guess, have chosen
11	does not apply to this deposition. If you are
12	handing something to the witness, I'd like a copy
13	of it.
14	MR. DAVIS: I think we have provided a
15	copy. To me, to the extent that we are trying to
16	accommodate you further, that's one extra step we
17	are taking, but I do think you have a copy.
18	MR. HILL: If you'd like to point me to
19	where in the thousands and thousands of pages I
20	might be able to find that, Todd, I'd be happy to
21	look.
22	MR. DAVIS: I think they are listed by
23	date in the materials you've got.
24	MR. HILL: If they are so easy to find, I
25	suspect Nathan should be able find them since he's
0148
1	sitting there helping you. It probably speaks
2	volumes with the task you've assigned me.
3	MR. DAVIS: Well, I don't think that's
4	true; he's doing a bunch of other things, too,
5	besides trying to help you out.
6	Anyway, let me give you some additional
7	ones. ANS6419, ANS6414, ANS6417, ANS6190.
8	MR. HILL: I'm looking in the e-mails; I
9	don't see those exhibits.
10	(Off the record.)
11	(Defendant's Composite Exhibit 9,
12	Pittsburgh Press and Post Gazette articles, was
13	marked for Identification.)
14	BY MR. DAVIS:
15	Q. Dr. Lipartito, I'm going to hand you what's
16	been hand at Exhibit 9. These are the four ones that
17	make up the composite that I told you about earlier.
18	MR. HILL: That's 6419, 6414, 6417, 6190?
19	MR. DAVIS: Yes, 6419, 6414, 6417, and
20	6190.
21	BY MR. DAVIS:
22	Q. All right. Dr. Lipartito, I'm handing you
23	what's been marked as Exhibit 9. Can you tell us
24	what this composite exhibit is?
25	A. These are articles -- let me see if I can
0149
1	pinpoint -- looks like Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh
2	Press, and one from Post Gazette, January 12, 1964,
3	and, so, these are a variety of articles from the
4	Pittsburgh Press and Post Gazette from January 1964.
5	Q. What's the topic of the newspaper articles?
6	A. So all of these are covering the Surgeon
7	General's reports on smoking and health that was
8	issued -- actually, I think the report was actually
9	issued on the 11th, but depending on the newspaper
10	and when it was printed, the coverage may have
11	actually appeared on the 12th.
12	Q. What did the stories report about the 1964
13	Surgeon General's report?
14	A. So there's a variety of headlines. "U.S.
15	indicting Cigarettes," "U.S. prepares Further Action
16	on Smoking," smoking -- this is a cartoon that
17	references the report called, "Smoking Health
18	Hazard." All of them are discussing contents of the
19	Surgeon General's report, either a summary of it or
20	commentary on it, about what the findings were.
21	Q. Did the Pittsburgh newspapers, including
22	specifically the Pittsburgh Post Gazette and the
23	Pittsburgh Press publish any follow-up stories on the
24	1964 Surgeon General's report in the months that
25	followed?
0150
1	A. Yes. As was typical of newspapers, the
2	coverage continued for quite a while.
3	Q. And with respect to the editorial cartoon
4	that's part of Exhibit 9, is there any significance
5	to that kind of editorial cartoon from a historical
6	perspective?
7	A. Well, I think this falls into a category
8	that could be called ephemera, meaning to distinguish
9	a little bit from, say, news sources, these are
10	things that accrued from a moment in time to make a
11	point, not necessarily things that are meant to be
12	saved but historians often value these highly
13	precisely because they point to kind of a more
14	everyday life situation that's often hard to get to.
15	So, in this case, a cartoon both meant to
16	be somewhat humorous but also a commentary on what's
17	happening in the world, in this case it's a
18	commentary on the smoking report, and I think it
19	makes several points that, obviously, references
20	directly what we see in the news section about the
21	report on smoking, it's a health hazard, the Surgeon
22	General's determined that the conclusive evidence is
23	the health hazard, but it also has a man holding a
24	copy presumably of a report and smoking -- rather
25	nervously smoking a cigarette, and then he's chained
0151
1	to a giant ball and chain called the smoking habit.
2	So it's referencing the addictive nature of tobacco.
3	Q. Now -- thank you.
4	Jack, here's the next series. ANS6212,
5	ANS6451, ALY296, ANS6228.
6	(Off the record.)
7	MR. DAVIS: I'll leave out 296 for now
8	since Jack hasn't gotten it.
9	(Defendant's Composite Exhibit 10,
10	Pittsburgh Press and Post Gazette articles, was
11	marked for Identification.)
12	BY MR. DAVIS:
13	Q. So, Dr. Lipartito, I'm going to hand you
14	what's been marked as Defendant's Exhibit 10 and ask
15	if you can identify what's in that composite exhibit.
16	A. So these are articles looks like from the
17	Pittsburgh Post Gazette, Pittsburgh Press and
18	Pittsburgh Post Gazette, they seem to be from --
19	let's see, so they are from March '64 and January
20	'65.
21	Q. Did you find information in the Pittsburgh
22	newspapers, specifically the Pittsburgh Post Gazette
23	and the Pittsburgh Press, in the 1964 time frame
24	about whether there was help available for smokers
25	who wanted to quit smoking?
0152
1	A. I did.
2	Q. And tell us about this coverage, please.
3	A. So, in Pittsburgh, I thought quite
4	strikingly almost immediately after the Surgeon
5	General's report, there was a clinic started to help
6	people who wanted to stop smoking; it was actually
7	reported extensively in the newspaper about the
8	clinic.
9	There was also, I think -- let's see, this
10	is actually the Pittsburgh Press discussing another
11	non-smoking plan that was available at the University
12	of Pittsburgh, and those are two Pittsburgh specific
13	facilities, if you will, that in '64 gave people help
14	in quitting smoking.
15	And then the third article is information
16	nationally on the numbers of people who have quit,
17	discussing, in this case, looks like data from the
18	period since 1962, about 3.5 million people have
19	given up the habit and it actually provides
20	information going back 30 years, talks about 18 and a
21	half million adults who became ex-smokers over the
22	past 30 years.
23	Q. Now are these the only -- what's been
24	marked as Defendant's Exhibit 10, the only articles
25	that discussed help available to smokers who wanted
0153
1	to quit?
2	A. No, actually, that was major topic. In
3	fact, you can find earlier articles, we pointed to
4	some of them or discussed them, about plans and
5	advice and then these are the clinics that were
6	started in Pittsburgh in the wake of the Surgeon
7	General's reports. As you go further through the
8	paper in time, we also see advice columns by both
9	doctors in the newspaper as well as columnists like
10	Ann Landers providing information on -- either
11	information to Pittsburghians or, more generally, to
12	the readers about how to stop smoking via further in
13	time until the 1970s there's evidence that there were
14	a variety of clinics available and programs available
15	to Pittsburgh, people in Pittsburgh to help them stop
16	smoking.
17	Q. Did you see evidence in the Pittsburgh
18	newspapers that you reviewed reflecting help
19	available to people who wanted to smoke -- strike
20	that.
21	For the newspaper articles that you
22	reviewed in both the 1950s and the 1960s, for the
23	Pittsburgh area, did you see articles offering
24	assistance to smokers who wanted to quit smoking?
25	A. Yes, I did.
0154
1	MR. HILL: Object to the form.
2	BY MR. DAVIS:
3	Q. And was that discussion, was that topic of
4	discussion in Pittsburgh newspapers during that time
5	frame an isolated incident?
6	A. No. As I think I've already mentioned, it
7	takes a variety of forms from products and aids
8	advertised in newspapers to advice columns and
9	programs that people have used to stop smoking, to
10	either advertisements or, as in this case, articles
11	about clinics and programs. So it's both consistent
12	over time. There was, again, a major topic that I
13	found in my research, but it also takes multiple
14	forms and appears in multiple places.
15	Q. Did you see any evidence in this case that
16	Mary Simon took advantage of any of the methods that
17	were offered to try to quit smoking?
18	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form and outside
19	the scope of this witness's disclosure and
20	expertise.
21	THE WITNESS: Yeah, I base my information
22	about her on what people said in their
23	depositions. I don't recall anything that
24	specifically discusses her attending or going to a
25	program that's what I recall.
0155
1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. Were the articles in the 1960s in the
3	Pittsburgh newspapers that discussed any celebrities
4	that had quit smoking?
5	A. The one that I recall most prominently was
6	John Wayne because he's mentioned in some of the
7	depositions as a favored actor of hers, and there was
8	an article in the Pittsburgh paper he had had lung
9	cancer. He'd been treated for lung cancer, and at
10	least at that time 60s, I'm thinking it's 1966, he
11	had recovered from the surgery and it mentions that
12	he had once been a heavy smoker and that he had
13	stopped smoking cigarettes.
14	MR. DAVIS: Jack, here's the set. It's
15	Reader's Digest and it's AIW318, AIW322, AIW324,
16	AIW334, AIW372, AIW388, AIW390, AIW404, AIW471.
17	(Defendant's Composite Exhibit 11, Reader's
18	Digest articles, was marked for Identification.)
19	(Off the record.)
20	MR. HILL: It's 6:00. What's your plan
21	for the rest of the evening?
22	MR. DAVIS: I'm very short to being done.
23	MR. HILL: All right. My wife is out of
24	town, so my mom has got my kids, so I don't know
25	that I'm going to be -- well, we will play it by
0156
1	ear, but I've got issues in terms of how long I
2	can stay.
3	MR. DAVIS: Well, I don't have much
4	longer. I'm trying to wrap this up in the next 5
5	to 10 minutes.
6	MR. HILL: Sure, and then I'll take a
7	break and at least start the cross examination.
8	MR. DAVIS: Okay.
9	BY MR. DAVIS:
10	Q. Doctor, I'm handing you what's been marked
11	as Defendants Exhibit 11. Can you tell us what this
12	composite exhibit consists of?
13	A. Just a quick look. These are more
14	articles from Reader's Digest, look like in 1962,
15	'64, '66, variety of years from Reader's Digest.
16	Q. Did Reader's Digest continue to cover the
17	health dangers associated with smoking in the 1960s?
18	A. Oh, yes, very closely.
19	Q. What's been marked as Defendant's
20	Exhibit 11, are these examples of the articles that
21	Reader's Digest ran about the risks of smoking in the
22	1960s?
23	A. They are.
24	MR. HILL: Object to the form.
25
0157
1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. You don't need to read out all of the
3	titles, but can you just cite a few examples?
4	A. Sure. Here's one from '62, "Lung Cancer
5	and Cigarettes, the Latest Findings." It discusses
6	actually a predecessor report from Britain,
7	predecessor to the American Surgeon General's report
8	of a similar report from Britain's Royal College of
9	Physicians.
10	Here's an article that -- this is actually
11	a reprint of an article from another magazine, TIME
12	Magazine, which is also a popular magazine. The
13	article indicates, danger, smoke at your own risk,
14	talking about lung cancer, heart disease and issuing
15	a warning, stop, to smokers stop. Pretty typical
16	things one finds in Reader's Digest and other
17	magazines.
18	Let's see, much similar things. Here's
19	one that I think -- yes, this is a report on the
20	Surgeon General's report, so this was issued -- this
21	is an article that appeared after the Surgeon
22	General's report in Reader's Digest, "Cigarettes
23	Tried and Found Guilty."
24	And, so, it goes on, various types of
25	articles in one way or another dealing with
0158
1	cigarettes and health.
2	Q. And what role did Reader's Digest play,
3	based upon your research, in providing information to
4	the public about the health risks of cigarette
5	smoking ?
6	A. I think Reader's Digest is a really --
7	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: -- key source in this, in
9	part because they started so early and in part
10	because they were some of the best articles,
11	articles that were often cited and referred to by
12	others. In fact, they even advertised the
13	articles on smoking that were going to appear in
14	their magazine in Pittsburgh and other newspapers.
15	They were --1 would say took a very strong
16	anti-smoking position from an editorial
17	standpoint. I think they were even cited as
18	having been the kind of key source of information
19	to the public by the Public Health Service and
20	they also dedicated themselves strongly to helping
21	people stop smoking. They -- for example, they
22	wouldn't take cigarette advertising. So I would
23	say they had a position on smoking that was very
24	clear and very strong.
25
0159
1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. When Ms. Mary Simon lived in the Pittsburgh
3	area through the 1960s and the first part of the
4	1980s, were there any television broadcast in
5	Pittsburgh about the health risk of smoking?
6	A. Yeah. So the two sources of television
7	information, and bearing in mind this is the time
8	when there's essentially three and only three
9	television networks to watch, would be national news,
10	which the evidence from the depositions indicates she
11	did pay close attention to news, which would include
12	the evening news. And then we have from the
13	Pittsburgh papers, examples from the television
14	guides what's being shown on television in
15	Pittsburgh, examples of special reports on -- news
16	reports on smoking and health that appeared during
17	her time there.
18	Q. And was there any newspaper articles in the
19	Pittsburgh newspapers that discussed the effect of
20	broadcast TV stories on health risk of smoking and
21	whether that contributed to people quitting smoking?
22	A. I'd have to look at a document.
23	MR. DAVIS: Jack, it's ANS6335.
24	(Defendant's Exhibit 12, Pittsburgh Post
25	Gazette article, was marked for Identification.)
0160
1	MR. HILL: I got it.
2	BY MR. DAVIS:
3	Q. Dr. Lipartito, I've handed you what's been
4	marked as Defendant's Exhibit 12 to your deposition.
5	Can you tell us what this is?
6	A. This is an article from the Pittsburgh
7	Post Gazette, May 21, 1970, discussing a program that
8	was shown in Pittsburgh as well as other cities
9	produced by the American Cancer Society. The title
10	is, "Anti-smoke TV Show Gets Results." It discusses
11	the show in a general sense. It was an anti-smoking
12	program that was shown in March of 1970 and it
13	provides information where it was shown, and then
14	discusses Pittsburgh and the reaction in Pittsburgh
15	and discusses the high percentage relative to other
16	markets that had seen it and that, in fact, people
17	who had seen it, percentage of them gave up smoking
18	as a result based on the surveys and research that
19	were done.
20	Q. What significance is this article to you as
21	a historian?
22	A. So, I mean, it has two points of
23	significance in my research. One, of course, it's
24	again information that appears almost -- at this
25	point, almost, you know, daily or weekly in the
0161
1	newspaper, reminding people once again that smoking
2	is harmful, that there are efforts -- people can make
3	efforts to give up smoking, that there are societies
4	like the American Cancer Society working on helping
5	people give up smoking. And then it's more -- in a
6	more indirect sense, it indicates that there were
7	programs on television like this available seen in
8	Pittsburgh and even that, apparently, there's some
9	evidence they actually had an effect as well as being
10	seen by a good percentage of the population.
11	Q. Now, you mentioned that one of the sources
12	of materials that you looked at earlier was public
13	service announcements?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. Were there public service announcements run
16	by the healthcare community in the 1960s, 1970s, and
17	1980s about the risks of smoking?
18	A. Yes, there were in all of those decades
19	produced by a variety of organizations and entities
20	shown on television.
21	Q. Did any of those involve celebrities?
22	A. Yes. In fact, it was a very common form
23	that they took.
24	Q. What were some of celebrities -- who were
25	some of the celebrities that participated in the
0162
1	public service announcements about the risks of
2	smoking ?
3	A. Well, depending on the time period, I'm
4	recalling actors Ed Asner who, at that point, I think
5	was a star of a popular TV series Mary Tyler Moore
6	show, and Larry Hagman, who was the star of an
7	extremely popular TV show called Dallas. There were
8	others, but those are the two that spring to mind
9	right now.
10	Q. Were any of the celebrities who
11	participated in public service announcements
12	discussed in the Pittsburgh newspapers?
13	A. Yes, in a number of contexts.
14	Q. What are those?
15	A. Ones that I think I can recall most
16	vividly are with the Great American Smokeout, which
17	was an American Cancer Society program to encourage
18	people to give up smoking by beginning with the
19	national day of non-smoking in November.
20	Q. Do you remember any specific celebrities
21	were discussed in the Pittsburgh newspapers that also
22	participated in public service announcements about
23	the risks of smoking ?
24	A. Oh, yes. Pittsburgh was, of course, the
25	home to the Pittsburgh Steelers, very popular
0163
1	football team. Their quarterback, Terry Bradshaw,
2	was married to a well-known ice skater, figure
3	skater, JoJo Starbuck, and I believe actually there
4	was an article, since she was kind of a local
5	celebrity, she was leading the anti-smoking effort in
6	the Pittsburgh/Allegheny County area.
7	Q. Did the public service announcements from
8	public health authorities also involve situations
9	that were not -- where no celebrity was involved but,
10	instead, they were still talking about the risks of
11	smoking in the public service announcement?
12	A. Right.
13	MR. HILL: Object to the form.
14	BY MR. DAVIS:
15	Q. Do you have those public service
16	announcements that you -- on your reliance list for
17	those that appeared in the 1960s through the 1980s?
18	A. Yes, I tried to collect and acquire as
19	many as I could. So there's certainly celebrities,
20	we have talked about the Great American Smokeout
21	advertisements. There's others that involve use of
22	cartoon characters, others that involve use of
23	popular culture figures. I think the one that many
24	people might remember, the Star War characters C3PO
25	and R2D2 appeared in an anti-smoking program. And
0164
1	then there were others that were produced, you know,
2	without necessarily celebrities, but making the point
3	in other ways.
4	I think the first celebrity --1 think the
5	first, I guess you'd call, celebrity anti-smoking
6	advertisement, television advertisement that I can
7	think of actually goes back a little bit earlier than
8	that, maybe '65 or '66 or '67, involved an actor
9	named William Talman who had starred in another
10	popular TV series in the 60s, Perry Mason, and he
11	actually died of lung cancer and he produced a very
12	powerful television public service announcement
13	discussing the link between smoking and cancer and,
14	basically, warning the public in clear terms that
15	they should stop smoking because it was deadly.
16	Q. You mentioned earlier that there were
17	advice columns and health columns that ran in the
18	Pittsburgh newspapers. Did those -- that discussed
19	the risks of smoking and quitting smoking. Did those
20	columns continue to run in the 60s, throughout the
21	60s throughout the 70s and throughout the 80s?
22	A. Right, and, indeed, beyond. By advice
23	columns, I would take that to mean several types,
24	both health and more personal, I think it was, are
25	the two that I recall.
0165
I	Q. What were some --
2	MR. HILL: Move to strike as nonresponsive
3	everything after yes.
4	BY MR. DAVIS:
5	Q. What were some of the personal advice
6	columns that ran in the Pittsburgh newspapers in
7	the -- following the Surgeon General's report in 1964
8	through the 1980s?
9	A. So, again, the two I'm recalling most
10	clearly are the doctors' columns. These were weekly
II	or daily features discussing health issues by a
12	doctor, different doctors at different times ran the
13	column, and then the other is, I think, in Pittsburgh
14	Post Gazette, it was Ann Landers' columns were the
15	ones they featured.
16	Q. And were there also -- and in West Palm
17	Beach area, after Mary Simon moved from Pittsburgh to
18	the Palm Beach area, were there advice columns and
19	health columns run in the West Palm Beach Post that
20	discussed the risks of smoking?
21	A. Oh, sorry, yes, I think --
22	MR. HILL: Object to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: I think in the Palm Beach
24	Post, as I'm recalling, the advice column was
25	Peter Abby, not Ann Landers, but very similar and,
0166
1	again, there were doctors' columns as well in that
2	paper.
3	BY MR. DAVIS:
4	Q. For the Palm Beach Post, for the time
5	period that Mary Simon lived in Florida, did it run
6	articles or advice columns about quitting smoking?
7	A. I believe so, yeah.
8	MR. DAVIS: Jack, lasts series of numbers.
9	APS4285, APS4295, APS4296, APS4292.
10	MR. HILL: Got them.
11	(Defendant's Composite Exhibit 13,
12	newspaper advice columns, was marked for
13	Identification.)
14	BY MR. DAVIS:
15	Q. I'm going to hand you what's been marked as
16	Defendant's Exhibit 13. Can you tell us what this
17	composite exhibit consists of?
18	A. Give me one second.
19	Yes, it looks like -- okay. So what I see
20	are articles from the Pittsburgh papers, the
21	Pittsburgh Post Gazette, and these are both doctors
22	columns, columns written by physicians giving advice
23	on medical issues, as well as Ann Landers' columns,
24	and they discuss cigarette smoking and quitting
25	smoking in various ways.
0167
1	Q. What's the title of the column that ran in
2	the Pittsburgh Post Gazette?
3	A. Yes, I remember this quite well. This is
4	Dr. Steinchron, and I think this was both in
5	Pittsburgh -- it may have appeared elsewhere, the
6	name rings a bell from other papers, but at least in
7	this paper, the Pittsburgh paper, his column at this
8	point was entitled, "Stop killing yourself," and
9	quite a number of articles that -- under that general
10	title that dealt specifically with the harm being
11	caused by people who smoke cigarettes and there's
12	actually a couple of examples right here on that.
13	Q. What's been marked as Defendant's
14	Exhibit 13, are those the only examples of advice
15	columns that appeared in either the Pittsburgh
16	newspapers during the time period that Mary Simon
17	lived there or the Florida newspaper, the Palm Beach
18	Post, when Mary Simon lived in Florida?
19	A. No, they are not, they are not. There
20	were quite a number, especially of the "stop killing
21	yourself" variety in Pittsburgh.
22	MR. DAVIS: Jack, since I think you
23	probably have the one that Nathan -- that we
24	found, it took a while to find. He e-mailed it to
25	you, it's the December 1, 1963 Pittsburgh Press
0168
1	article about the -- called, "Official Study to
2	Link Cancer With Cigarettes," ANS6409. Do you
3	have that one?
4	All I'm going to ask him is is this the
5	article that you mentioned earlier about a report
6	of the Pittsburgh Press that preceded the release
7	of the Surgeon General's report in '64.
8	MR. HILL: Okay. Yeah, I got it.
9	(Defendant's Exhibit 14, Pittsburgh Press
10	article, was marked for Identification.)
11	BY MR. DAVIS:
12	Q. Handing you what's been marked as
13	Exhibit 14. Can you tell us what this article is,
14	what this exhibit is, please?
15	A. It's an article from the Pittsburgh Press
16	1963, December 1st.
17	Q. And is this the newspaper article from
18	December 1963 that you mentioned earlier that
19	preceded the release of the 1964 Surgeon General's
20	report?
21	A. Yes. This is the one that I remember
22	quite well, again, all appeared in papers. There
23	would be an article like this, in this case, in
24	Pittsburgh that anticipates the coming of the study,
25	reminds readers the study is forthcoming, and in this
0169
1	case, even says quite -- you know, states blankly
2	that "official study to link cancer with cigarettes,"
3	anticipating what would be the results of the Surgeon
4	General's report in the next month.
5	Q. Now, Dr. Lipartito, you mentioned earlier
6	that you read the depositions in this case. Based
7	upon your review of materials, what events have you
8	observed in Mary Simon's life that demonstrate a
9	personal awareness of the risks of smoking?
10	A. I think the most compelling evidence for
11	me is what she said to her children about smoking and
12	discouraging them from smoking. I think, in
13	addition, the fact that she was being reminded by her
14	own children to stop smoking and that her son, Jay in
15	particular, was strongly anti-smoking and had even
16	worked to convince at least two of his wives to stop
17	smoking and said that he told his mother she should
18	stop, that she had conversations with her
19	grandchildren about smoking and dangers of smoking,
20	and that she herself had experienced death that was
21	linked by the doctors --by her doctors to smoking --
22	or, sorry, experienced -- yeah, that was not very
23	well said.
24	That she -- that her husband had heart
25	disease that her doctor linked to smoking and she was
0170
1	aware of that and, indeed, concerned about that, plus
2	other conversations with the children and medical
3	authorities that were very directly telling her to
4	stop smoking.
5	Q. In terms of non-family members, was there
6	anything in the deposition materials that you
7	reviewed that demonstrate a personal awareness by
8	Mary Simon of the risks of smoking ?
9	A. I think the conversations that apparently
10	she had with her physician in 1980 or so in which he
11	told her to stop every time she came in, you know,
12	indicating she either didn't or wasn't interested in
13	stopping, I found that pretty compelling.
14	Q. As a historian, what do the newspaper
15	articles from -- that you've reviewed from 1950s
16	through the 1980s which discuss smoking and smokers
17	quitting, tell you about whether smokers were
18	accepting and acknowledging that smoking caused
19	cancer, heart problems and lung disease?
20	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
21	THE WITNESS: Yes, certainly, there's
22	evidence of both numbers and increasing numbers of
23	people quitting, so I think that's pretty good
24	evidence that people who heard the message got the
25	message, acted on the message, actually reinforced
0171
1	that this message was widely distributed, widely
2	occurred, and, you know, at least in some people
3	was practiced.
4	BY MR. DAVIS:
5	Q. Can you sum up your opinions and
6	conclusions about the amount of information that was
7	publicly available to Mary Simon about the health
8	dangers of smoking during her lifetime?
9	MR. HILL: Object to the form.
10	THE WITNESS: Sum it up by saying it was
11	widely available throughout her life, that the
12	messages, while they took different forms,
13	consistently focused on both health risks and the
14	addictive nature of tobacco, that not only the
15	sheer number of times in which she would have been
16	exposed to this message, but the wide range and
17	variety of forms and formats that she was -- that
18	this message was conveyed to her and people like
19	her living in that time frame, the evidence both
20	from her own life as well as behavior of smokers
21	elsewhere as well as some of the public opinion
22	polls indicate that this message was widely heard
23	and was acted upon by many of Mary Simon's
24	contemporaries.
25
0172
1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. Did the information that was publicly
3	available to Mary Simon about the health dangers of
4	smoking during her lifetime include warnings that
5	smoking can cause cancer, including lung cancer?
6	A. Yes, very --
7	MR. HILL: Object to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: Very prominently discussed.
9	BY MR. DAVIS:
10	Q. Did that publicly available information
11	also include information about the reducing the risk
12	if a smoker quit smoking?
13	A. Indeed.
14	MR. HILL: Object to the form.
15	THE WITNESS: Many of the columns
16	discussed just that.
17	BY MR. DAVIS:
18	Q. And did the publicly available information
19	during Mary Simon's lifetime that she would have been
20	exposed to include information about how to obtain
21	assistance in quitting smoking?
22	A. Both --
23	MR. HILL: Object to the form.
24	THE WITNESS: Both from the newspaper and
25	other media as well as evidence that I found
0173
1	indicating that such programs existed right in her
2	area during the time she was living there.
3	BY MR. DAVIS:
4	Q. How difficult would it have been for
5	someone living in the area where Mary Simon lived to
6	have avoided all of this information?
7	A. I find it just vanishingly inconceivable
8	that she could have avoided or even a significant
9	portion, given the density, the repetition, the
10	variety, and her own words and behavior that I'm
11	convinced, as a historian, that she saw this message.
12	Q. Have you offered your opinions to a
13	reasonable degree of professional certainty within
14	your field?
15	A. Yes, I have.
16	MR. DAVIS: Thank you.
17	Jack, do you want to start, you want to
18	take a couple minutes?
19	MR. HILL: We will take a couple minutes
20	and I have, quite frankly, no idea how long the
21	cross examination is going to be, but as I told
22	you a while ago, you know, it's 6:30. There's
23	been no notice that you were going to try to do a
24	trial deposition. I don't know how long I'm going
25	to be able to stay to conduct a cross examination
0174
1	due to child care issues. My wife is out of town
2	and my mom is taking care of the kids.
3	MR. DAVIS: And we can agree to disagree
4	on the notice issue. Let me say you've raised it
5	a couple times, I mean, Plaintiffs own notice
6	says that this notice is going to be used -- can
7	be used for uses at trial, so I'm not sure there's
8	any further thing that needs to be done given that
9	particular type of notice.
10	MR. HILL: Sure. Is there a cross-notice
11	that I've missed by you?
12	MR. DAVIS: We did not cross-notice this,
13	but there would be no reason to cross-notice this
14	given the language in your notice.
15	MR. HILL: Sure. I'm going to take a
16	bathroom break and we will come back and see how
17	long we go.
18	Okay. Understand that he is now on cross
19	examination, that it would be inappropriate to
20	talk to him substantively about his testimony?
21	MR. DAVIS: I understand. We will go off
22	the record.
23	(Brief recess was taken.)
24	REDIRECT EXAMINATION
0175
1	BY MR. HILL:
2	Q. Dr. Lipartito, we, of course, met for the
3	first time earlier when I was asking you questions
4	and now, obviously, I have some follow-up based on
5	questioning by the lawyer for R.J. Reynolds.
6	And I'll start with you have the
7	understanding, sir, that this case is going to go to
8	trial beginning March 7th of 2014?
9	A. Yes, I have heard that.
10	Q. And can you tell me what vacation plans you
11	have from the period of March 7th to the end of March
12	that you will be out of the area and unavailable to
13	testify?
14	A. I will be out of the country from
15	March 12th to the 15th.
16	Q. The 12th through the 15th?
17	A. Yes, I think that's the dates, 15th or
18	16th, I can't recall now.
19	Q. And other than those dates in which you are
20	out of town, can we assume that you would be
21	available to come to West Palm Beach and testify in
22	this matter should that be decided that it would be
23	appropriate for you to do so?
24	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
25	THE WITNESS: From March 7th to end of the
0176
1	month, except for the 12th through the 15th or
2	16th, I think that is correct. The only time I
3	would have a conflict would be on the Wednesdays
4	because I have a class Wednesday night at 5.
5	BY MR. HILL:
6	Q. You certainly haven't told any of the
7	lawyers from R.J. Reynolds that you were unavailable
8	to testify in this matter should it go to trial
9	beginning March 7th, correct?
10	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: I've told them what I've
12	told you, that I'll be out of the country from the
13	12th to the 15th or 16th, and that I have classes
14	on Wednesday.
15	BY MR. HILL:
16	Q. And did you have an understanding before
17	your deposition began today that the lawyer for R.J.
18	Reynolds was going to be asking you questions for a
19	number of hours about your opinions in this case?
20	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
21	THE WITNESS: I did hear that I would be
22	asked some questions as I was. Exactly how long
23	it would take, I didn't really know.
24	BY MR. HILL:
25	Q. Did you have the understanding that
0177
1	Mr. Davis intended to ask you questions in this
2	deposition rather than bring you live to testify in
3	trial in West Palm Beach, just 60 or 70 miles away
4	from where you are in your professional life?
5	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
6	THE WITNESS: The only thing I knew was
7	that he would ask some questions and we would look
8	at some of my reliance material.
9	BY MR. HILL:
10	Q. And although I haven't had the opportunity
11	to count the number of exhibits that he's discussed
12	with you, did Mr. Davis share with you before this
13	deposition that he planned on asking you questions
14	about the dozens of exhibits that you talked about
15	earlier in your deposition today?
16	A. I think we did discuss some generally.
17	What --1 don't remember actually looking at
18	exhibits, but we did discuss generally the type of
19	exhibits that he might want me to go over today.
20	Q. Am I correct in my understanding, then,
21	that it was Mr. Davis who suggested to you the
22	exhibits that were going to be discussed during your
23	testimony here today?
24	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
25	THE WITNESS: Again, we talked about
0178
1	different categories, different magazines,
2	newspapers, you know, beyond that -- that's what I
3	knew before today.
4	BY MR. HILL:
5	Q. And my question is who was steering that
6	conversation; am I correct that it was Mr. Davis who
7	was the one choosing which documents to discuss with
8	you as opposed to you telling him what documents you
9	thought were important to discuss today?
10	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: Yeah, I guess I would say I
12	didn't pick particular documents, I didn't pick
13	the documents that we looked at today.
14	BY MR. HILL:
15	Q. But if you didn't, then can I safely assume
16	that it was Mr. Davis or another lawyer from RJ.
17	Reynolds that selected the documents that you were
18	going to be talked to about today?
19	A. Well, I don't know how to answer that. I
20	can only tell you what I know and that is I didn't
21	select them. We did talk about the range of
22	documents, including the Reader's Digest, some of the
23	other magazines and, obviously, the Pittsburgh
24	papers, you know. We did discuss all of those
25	yesterday and they are all in my reliance list.
0179
1	Q. By way of sort of short answer, so I don't
2	have to repeat all of your opinions throughout each
3	of the questions, can we agree that, generally, you
4	have opinions in this case regarding public awareness
5	of the health risks associated with smoking; is that
6	a fair characterization?
7	A. That's certainly part of it.
8	Q. And you talked earlier about your research
9	of that topic, that is the public awareness of the
10	health risks associated with smoking starting in
11	2005, am I correct, sir?
12	A. That's when I began my research, correct.
13	Q. And I don't know that it was discussed with
14	you with Mr. Davis, but the reason that you began
15	that research in 2005 is that you were contacted by
16	an individual or individuals associated with the
17	tobacco industry, am I correct?
18	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: Generally, I mean, I was
20	contacted by --1 was actually contacted by a
21	historian first who asked me if I might be
22	interested in doing such research, and I discussed
23	it with him and then I discussed it --1 think I
24	mentioned I can't remember the individual, but it
25	was with a law firm named Johnson Tyler and
0180
1	Purvis.
2	BY MR. HILL:
3	Q. But you understood from the very beginning
4	that your offered involvement in the research of the
5	public awareness of the health risks associated with
6	smoking was being requested by individuals associated
7	with the tobacco industry, agreed?
8	A. I can't remember exactly what my
9	understanding was initially. I certainly understood
10	that this involved issues about tobacco and legal
11	cases. Since I was being asked about giving expert
12	witness testimony, I assumed they were legal cases.
13	Yes, I think at some point, I gained a
14	greater understanding. What I would say, I was asked
15	to do research and offer opinions, that I would be
16	free to conduct that research and form my opinions.
17	Q. My question is a little more specific than
18	that. I wanted to make sure that I'm correct in my
19	understanding that you knew from the beginning that
20	the research that you were being invited to perform
21	would be on behalf of the tobacco industry.
22	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: Well, I probably wouldn't
24	agree with that because I never saw my research on
25	behalf, I saw that I was doing research in legal
0181
1	cases with law firms or through a law firm that
2	was involved in tobacco litigation and I was asked
3	to give my opinion on matters about public
4	awareness.
5	BY MR. HILL:
6	Q. So I will take out -- it sounds like you
7	have an issue with "on behalf of," so I will ask it
8	in a different way that, hopefully, is less
9	objectionable to your sensibilities.
10	Did you understand from the very beginning
11	that the research that you were being invited to
12	perform was at the request of the tobacco industry in
13	the defense of litigation that was pending in Florida
14	at the time?
15	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
16	THE WITNESS: Yes, I think I would say I
17	understood that. Beyond that, I really didn't
18	concern myself with the legal issues, I concerned
19	myself with the historical research.
20	BY MR. HILL:
21	Q. And before you were approached by
22	individual or individuals affiliated in some way with
23	the tobacco industry, you had never before done
24	specific research as to public awareness of the
25	health risks associated with smoking, is that
0182
1	correct?
2	A. Yes, in other words -- excuse me, my voice
3	is -- to be clear, I have not done that specific sort
4	of research before on smoking and health.
5	Q. And, specifically, you hadn't done any
6	research before 2005 related even generally to
7	smoking and health, is that accurate?
8	A. Except in the general sense of being part
9	of the 20th century, a number of topics, but, you
10	know, as has been the case in my practice in the
11	past, I sometimes approach topics that I haven't done
12	any work on and become involved in them.
13	Q. And you were -- you haven't, before 2005,
14	authored any peer-reviewed journal articles on the
15	subject of smoking and health?
16	A. No.
17	Q. That's correct?
18	A. Yes, that's correct, I have not.
19	Q. And, so, when you were talking about your
20	experiences as a reviewer for peer-reviewed journals,
21	none of that experience includes you yourself
22	drafting any journal articles regarding smoking and
23	health, is that accurate?
24	A. I have not written -- I've not published
25	any articles in peer-reviewed journals on smoking and
0183
1	health.
2	Q. You haven't published any articles even
3	that are non-peer reviewed on the issues of smoking
4	and health, correct?
5	A. I suppose that's true, but I say most
6	things I published have been peer reviewed, so --
7	Q. You haven't written anything publicly about
8	smoking and health, is that accurate?
9	A. Yes, I've not authored anything
10	specifically on smoking and health, right; I think
11	that's the answer.
12	Q. And you have never been asked to lecture
13	specifically on the topic of smoking and health as a
14	historian, correct?
15	A. No, I've never been asked.
16	Q. And is there -- Mr. Davis talked about your
17	resume. Am I correct that a review of your resume
18	would not reveal any particular interest of yours on
19	the topic of smoking and health?
20	A. I don't think there's anything listed on
21	my resume that specifically deals with that topic,
22	no.
23	Q. So there's nothing that a reviewer of your
24	resume would be left with the impression that this is
25	an individual that has extensive training, education
0184
1	and experience on the issue of smoking and health, am
2	I correct?
3	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: I suppose not. I mean, I
5	don't know what people would interpret, again,
6	extensive work in the time period, but I don't
7	think there's anything specifically referencing
8	that topic in at least the titles in the resume.
9	BY MR. HILL:
10	Q. And, so, the time period that we are
11	talking about is the time period of your early 1900s
12	to, at least according to the testimony that you just
13	gave, sometime in the late 80s?
14	A. The time period of my research and my
15	publications?
16	Q. Yes, sir.
17	A. Yes, from --1 would say I'd go back a
18	little further, say from the later part of the 19th
19	century through, you know, the later part of the 20th
20	century.
21	Q. You were asked a question or a series of
22	questions perhaps on the number of hours that you
23	devoted to a study of health and smoking, and I think
24	your testimony was that you estimated the number of
25	hours to be in excess of 2,000 hours on the subject
0185
1	matter of this.
2	A. I think I actually said approaching, but
3	it could be just less than, it could be 2,000, could
4	be more, somewhere in that range of about 2,000
5	hours.
6	Q. All of those hours were billed to the
7	tobacco industry, is that correct?
8	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
9	THE WITNESS: I mean, I submit my bills to
10	the law firm Jones Day.
11	BY MR. HILL:
12	Q. Has that been true of all of your bills,
13	they all get sent to the law firm of Jones Day?
14	A. I believe in some of the early research I
15	did, they were submitted to the law firm Johnson
16	Tyler Purvis, and I've done some work that I
17	submitted to the law firm of -- I'm sorry, not
18	remembering now, but there was another law firm.
19	Q. Regardless of the names of the law firms to
20	whom you've submitted invoices, since your being
21	asked to get involved in this issue in 2005, is it
22	fair to say that all of those invoices have been paid
23	by lawyers representing the tobacco industry in
24	litigation?
25	A. You know, I have little specific knowledge
0186
1	of the clients of these firms or their billing
2	practices. I do not do only research on the issues
3	we discussed on smoking and health and tobacco, and I
4	know that I'm offering my services here today as a
5	witness in cases involving smoking and health
6	involving tobacco companies.
7	Q. Is there any ambiguity or uncertainty in
8	your mind about who it is that ultimately is paying
9	your bill, sir, for all of this work that you've
10	done?
11	A. I don't know if there's ambiguity. I
12	guess what I'm saying is it really has no effect or
13	bearing on my research or conclusions.
14	Q. I haven't asked you that question, sir. My
15	question was rather straightforward, that is, you
16	know who is paying your bills ultimately is the
17	tobacco industry, is that accurate to say?
18	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: Yeah, I suppose that's true,
20	but, again, I really haven't concerned myself with
21	those sorts of issues, so I can't give you
22	anything more than a general sense, yes, I think
23	that's true, but it's not something that I spent
24	any time addressing.
25
0187
1	BY MR. HILL:
2	Q. Sure, I understand that you haven't
3	concerned yourself with those issues, but your
4	standard hourly rate is $250 an hour, sir?
5	A. It is now, yes.
6	Q. How long has that been the case?
7	A. I don't remember. It's changed. I
8	originally, I think, in 2005, it was $150 an hour.
9	Q. I suspect you can probably hear the
10	calculator spinning all the way down in Miami, but if
11	you have approximately 2,000 hours at 25 -- excuse
12	me, $250 an hour, would you dispute that you've been
13	paid approximately $500,000 for your research in this
14	case -- excuse me, in these cases?
15	A. I believe it's less because my original
16	rate was lower; I think it's more 400,000, perhaps.
17	Q. And are you able to put any finer point on
18	the amount of money that you've been paid to conduct
19	this research other than saying it's around $400,000?
20	A. I mean, I'd have to go add up all my bills
21	over time, but the figure that I have in mind based
22	on, you know, this looking over the past is about
23	400, $420,000, something in that range.
24	Q. Are you able to say with certainty under
25	oath that the amount that you billed for your
0188
1	involvement in this issue is less than $450,000?
2	A. That's my recollection. I suppose, you
3	know, I'd have to go back and do finer calculations
4	to get a more precise figure. My recollection is in
5	the 420,000, maybe $425,000 range, but, again, it's
6	the best I can do sitting here today.
7	Q. Sure. You've gone from 400 to 420 to now
8	$425,000. If I keep asking you questions, is your
9	recollection about the amount that you've been paid
10	to conduct this research likely to go even higher
11	than that?
12	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: Again, I think I've told you
14	what I know. It's in $400,000 range, maybe it's
15	420,1 think it's over 400, but I'm sure -- it's
16	pretty sure it's less than 450, but I can't give
17	you anything more than just what I remember and
18	recall at this point.
19	BY MR. HILL:
20	Q. You talked earlier about your receipt of
21	various grants over the years. Am I correct in my
22	understanding that you have received zero dollars in
23	grants to conduct tobacco research?
24	A. I've never applied for a grant to do
25	tobacco research.
0189
1	Q. So that would be yes, you haven't received
2	any grant money to conduct any kind of research about
3	tobacco and the history of tobacco use in this
4	country?
5	A. No, I have not.
6	Q. As the historian, can we agree that the
7	quality and character of the information available
8	about smoking and health risks associated with
9	smoking has not been static over time?
10	A. Certainly, yes. Almost any topic in
11	history, it's changed over time.
12	Q. Meaning that when you were asked very
13	general questions about the types of information that
14	you believe Mary Simon to have been exposed to or
15	likely to have been exposed to over the course of her
16	lifetime, what we really need to do is look at the
17	types of information that was available generally in
18	different stages of her life; would you agree with
19	that?
20	A. I think that's what I did and that's
21	what --1 think that's what I said.
22	Q. And, so, the quality of the information
23	that was publicly available, say, in the 30s was a
24	far cry from the information that was available, say,
25	in the 80s about the health risks associated with
0190
1	smoking ?
2	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
3	THE WITNESS: Well, I think we have to be
4	a little bit careful about a word like "quality"
5	and what that means. I would certainly say that
6	it focused on different issues, that there were
7	different concerns that was expressed in different
8	ways, but, you know, indeed, that's what
9	historical research tries to do is to get the
10	information and put it in its proper context.
11	Sol think the information was consistent
12	in terms of what it was saying about smoking being
13	a health risk; it just took different form or
14	emphasized different issues at the time.
15	BY MR. HILL:
16	Q. Meaning in the 1930s, your research has
17	allowed you to conclude that there wasn't publicly
18	available information that cigarette smoking causes
19	lung cancer, would you agree with that?
20	A. In the 1930s, while there was some limited
21	discussion of cancers and occasional mention of
22	effects on the lung, that was not the main focus of
23	the discussions about health. There was lots of
24	information about other things, but lung cancer, as I
25	think it pretty well known and documented, was an
0191
1	issue that developed in 1950s as a major focus in
2	public concern and lung cancer and smoking.
3	Q. One of the things I would like to talk to
4	you about is the Dore textbook we will call it, that
5	you believe would have been the textbook that was
6	provided to or used for Mary Simon as a primary
7	school student.
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. You were asked some questions about her
10	background and upbringing. Do you have an
11	understanding as to when it was that she lost her
12	last remaining parent and had to go into an orphanage
13	along with her sister and brother?
14	A. From what I've been able to determine, her
15	mother died in 1921. It's a little uncertain what
16	happened then. The evidence I found indicates she
17	was living with a family in 1930. There's no
18	definitive evidence that I could find that she was
19	actually in an orphanage. And I've traced evidence
20	of her father being alive into the 30s or the late
21	20s and then, again, I don't have definitive
22	information as to what happened to him, but seems to
23	be gone. I don't know if he died or disappeared, but
24	he's not traceable in the research I've done.
25	Q. Well, you talked about nothing definitive
0192
1	that she was ever in an orphanage. Do you have any
2	reason, based on the materials that you've been
3	provided, to doubt that Mary Simon was raised, at
4	least part of the time, in an orphanage?
5	A. I do have reason to question that, yes.
6	Q. All right, and the basis of your -- first
7	of all, there's sworn deposition testimony that
8	relates that Mary Simon was in an orphanage at some
9	point, correct?
10	A. No, that's not true. As I read them -- go
11	ahead.
12	Q. Sorry.
13	A. I'm sorry, I interrupted you.
14	Q. So you are unaware of any sworn deposition
15	testimony in this matter that related to Mary Simon
16	being in an orphanage as a child?
17	A. There's some, and there are others that
18	are less specific and say what they were told
19	directly by Mary Simon was that she was "raised by
20	nuns." There are others who used the word
21	"orphanage," although I didn't see anything a direct
22	quote from Mary Simon about orphanage.
23	I did investigate that issue as far as I
24	could in Pittsburgh and was not able to find evidence
25	that she was, in fact, in an orphanage from the
0193
1	records of the diocese of Pittsburgh as far as I
2	could tell. While that may be the case, there's also
3	some questions, including the fact that she's listed
4	as living with the Gallagher family in 1930.
5	Q. And so everyone is clear, Dr. Lipartito,
6	are you of the opinion as a historian in this case
7	that Mary Simon was not in an orphanage after the
8	death of her last remaining parent, her mother?
9	A. Again, I can only tell you what my
10	historical research indicates is that we were not
11	able to find any evidence as to an orphanage or which
12	orphanage she might have been in. We were able to
13	find evidence in 1930 and 1940 she was living outside
14	of an orphanage, either with a family in 1930, or on
15	her own, I think, in 1939 was that date.
16	So, you know, that's as far as I could go
17	as to where she may have been raised at different
18	times or what situation she may have been living in.
19	Q. And in 1939, she would have been how old?
20	A. Probably, depending on the month, the
21	record indicates she would have been 19 or 20.
22	Q. You understand as a historian that kids,
23	after they reached the age of 18, universally are no
24	longer able to stay in any orphanages?
25	A. Actually, the research I did indicates
0194
1	that orphanages in Pittsburgh sometimes would make
2	provisions to have children stay longer and work in
3	the orphanage. It varied quite a bit. Again, I'd
4	say it's -- you know, we have evidence from 1930 that
5	she seems to be not in an orphanage, and looking at
6	the records of the orphanage in the sense do not show
7	her appearing in any, and it's raised by nuns issue
8	indicating a Catholic institution do not indicate any
9	evidence that she was, in fact, in an orphanage, but
10	on the other hand, some of the family members have
11	said she was. So the evidence, I would say, is
12	mixed.
13	Q. Well, they haven't inferred anything. They
14	flat out told you in the sworn deposition testimony
15	that she was raised by nuns, correct?
16	A. That's true, but that could indicate a
17	variety of things.
18	Q. So, getting back to -- so, notwithstanding
19	any concerns that you have about the legitimacy of
20	the family's sworn deposition testimony about Mrs.
21	Mary Simon having been placed in an orphanage after
22	the death of her mother, you feel that "Health and
23	Happiness" was the textbook she would have been
24	exposed to in primary school?
25	A. Well, again, I think as I said before,
0195
1	there is evidence, whether it's an orphanage, whether
2	it's a school, whether it's that she was influenced
3	by Catholic school nuns, there's evidence that she
4	seems to have had a Catholic upbringing and
5	education, and in Pittsburgh, at least, in those
6	grades, if that's the case, that's the textbook she
7	would have used.
8	Q. There's no other textbook that you feel
9	more confident in suggesting to the jury was more
10	likely provided to Mary Simon at some point during
11	her primary school experience more so than the Dore
12	textbook?
13	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
14	THE WITNESS: I think that's the most
15	likely. I do have a number of other textbooks
16	that were used in Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania from
17	public school records that were used for health in
18	public schools, but, again, given what I said and
19	given that testimony about the connection to the
20	church and nuns and given other circumstances in
21	her life, I think it's probably more likely than
22	not that she was in a Catholic school at that
23	point and in Pittsburgh and that was the text used
24	in Catholic schools.
0196
1	BY MR. HILL:
2	Q. And let me ask you if you recognize this
3	statement about the type of information that was
4	imparted to children in Pittsburgh in the time in
5	which Mary Simon would have been a child in primary
6	school and that is this: "Wait until you are 21
7	before you begin to smoke and then you are not so
8	liable to develop 'smokers heart' which is a very
9	serious affection of the heart due to tobacco." Do
10	you recognize that statement, sir?
11	A. I believe I do. Can you point to me where
12	it is?
13	Q. Where do you believe it to be, sir?
14	A. I believe it's from the Dore book, but I'd
15	like to read it, if I could.
16	Q. It is. It was one of the things that was
17	referenced in your testimony by Mr. -- during your
18	testimony with Mr. Davis, so feel free to look at it.
19	It is Dore.
20	A. Okay.
21	Q. But am I correct that part of the message
22	that would have been imparted to Mary Simon as a
23	primary school student was she should wait until she
24	was 21 before she began to smoke?
25	A. I don't think that's exactly what it says.
0197
1	I don't think you can pull one sentence out of
2	context like that and understand what the message
3	was. First, it does discuss the dangers of tobacco,
4	notably tobacco heart, while it says it might be
5	lessened by waiting, it obviously implies that it is
6	nonetheless a potential health problem. It talks
7	about there's troubles with the cigarette habit, and
8	it goes on to point out that women are even more
9	susceptible to problems and health risks by smoking
10	than boys are or men. So that's what it says.
11	Q. I'm going to move to strike as
12	nonresponsive.
13	Do you have the Dore textbook in front of
14	you, sir?
15	A. I have the selections from it that I
16	brought, yes.
17	Q. So page 210, so there can be no doubt as to
18	the printed word without any editorialization from
19	either you or I, and let me ask you if I'm reading it
20	correctly, paragraph 7, it includes the following:
21	"Wait until you are 21 before you begin to smoke."
22	Did I read that accurately?
23	A. What page are you on?
24	Oh, sorry.
25	Q. 210.
0198
1	A. Yes, I found it.
2	Go ahead.
3	Q. "Wait until you are 21 before you begin to
4	smoke." Did I read that portion accurately, sir?
5	A. Those words are there.
6	Q. And they specifically talk about why women
7	shouldn't smoke or, actually, young girls at this
8	point, that's covered under paragraph 8, and let me
9	read it so that you can correct me if I misstate it.
10	"It certainly seems strange to say a word
11	to girls on the subject of smoking, but,
12	unfortunately, it is a practice which is becoming
13	rather common among them. Just because some men
14	smoke is no reason why women should. Men do things
15	which women do not do, just as women do many things
16	which men do not do. Remember that a gentleman
17	regards a woman as being belonging to an order higher
18	than his own and loses all respect for her if she
19	insists on losing her womanly charm by adopting the
20	manners of the 'fast set.' Tobacco has an effect
21	even worse on women than on men, and in most cases,
22	leads sooner or later to the adoption of the alcohol
23	or the drug habit."
24	Did I read paragraph 8 correctly?
25	A. You did.
0199
1	Q. All right, and, so, one of the messages
2	would have been delivered to Mary Simon, you believe,
3	as a child in primary school was that one of the
4	reasons she shouldn't smoke is that she would be
5	lumped together with the other young ladies that were
6	involved in the "fast set"?
7	A. It says something to that effect, yes.
8	That's one of the things it says.
9	Q. And it says that, "In most cases leads
10	sooner or later to the alcohol or the drug habit."
11	Did I read that accurately?
12	A. It does say that.
13	Q. Do you have an understanding, Dr.
14	Lipartito, as to when it was, based on your review of
15	the materials, that Mary Simon first became a regular
16	smoker?
17	A. Again, I think it's a little ambiguous
18	from the information I've seen. The children recall
19	her smoking in the house when they were growing up
20	and the youngest one, I think, was born in 1945, so
21	possibly the late 40s or early 50's.
22	There's other statements to the effect
23	that she may have started smoking or smoked
24	cigarettes when she was a teenager. That's the only
25	information I've seen. I've seen no information
0200
1	beyond that.
2	Q. Sure. Let's address the first part of
3	that. The fact that the children can obviously only
4	remember their mother smoking after they were born
5	and when they have a memory doesn't establish when it
6	was in any way that Mary Simon first started smoking;
7	would you agree with that?
8	A. I agree. I don't think I said that, but I
9	agree.
10	Q. So the other information --so the
11	depositions of the children of Mary Simon with
12	respect to their memories as to when they remember
13	their mother smoking doesn't tell us when Mary Simon
14	started smoking, do you agree?
15	A. I think it tells us something about that.
16	Tells us perhaps the latest date of which we have
17	evidence for her starting.
18	Q. Sure, but if we wanted to look to when Mary
19	Simon most likely started smoking, one of the things
20	you looked at is the deposition testimony where
21	there's testimony in there that would support an
22	opinion that she began smoking as a teenager, is that
23	accurate?
24	A. There are some statements to that effect
25	as well.
0201
1	Q. And you don't have any medical records that
2	might shed some light into what Mary Simon told her
3	physicians over the years as to when she started
4	smoking, do you?
5	A. Again, the only thing I recall in the way
6	of medical-related material is the deposition of one
7	of her doctors, Dr. Anderson.
8	Q. So if there's a medical record from 1994
9	that states that Ms. Simon started smoking at the age
10	of 15, that would be something that you were not
11	aware of as you sit here today, correct?
12	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form. Also
13	outside the scope.
14	THE WITNESS: Yeah, I've not seen that
15	record or such a record, at least I don't have
16	anything in front of me, so I can't say, but I
17	don't recall any such record that I've seen.
18	BY MR. HILL:
19	Q. Sure, but you haven't been provided any
20	medical records, correct?
21	A. Again, by medical records, I think you
22	mean something other than a deposition, then I -- or
23	some of the other legal documents that are part of
24	the case material that discuss various health issues,
25	I have not seen anything beyond those things that
0202
1	relate to health type topics, no.
2	Q. And so it's clear, you acknowledged you
3	haven't seen what I think anyone would consider to be
4	medical records of Mary Simon, do you agree?
5	A. No, I've not seen medical records in the
6	sense of doctors charts or, you know, diagnoses or
7	any of those things. No, I have not.
8	Q. But you do understand, based on your
9	reading of the depositions in this case, that Mary
10	Simon, if she started smoking as a teenager, that
11	would have been, what, in the mid 1930s?
12	A. Yeah, something in that range.
13	Q. And, so, can we extrapolate from that that
14	Mary Simon would have been a regular smoker in the
15	neighborhood of close to 30 years before the first
16	Surgeon General's report came out about the dangers
17	of cigarette smoking?
18	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: Again, I don't really have
20	any reason to know for certain if she began at 15
21	or at 20, but if she -- if she began at 15, then
22	mathematically, of course, you are correct, it
23	would be about 30 years.
24	BY MR. HILL:
25	Q. And am I correct that one of the areas in
0203
1	which you will not be offering opinions and have no
2	opinions is the extent to which Mary Simon was
3	addicted to nicotine contained in cigarettes?
4	A. Yeah, I have no expertise on medical
5	issues of nicotine and nicotine addiction. I'm not
6	trained in medicine or those areas.
7	Q. And, so, by the same token, you won't be
8	able to express any opinions as to how long Mary
9	Simon was addicted to nicotine contained in
10	cigarettes before the first Surgeon General report
11	came out, am I correct?
12	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: Again, I said I'm not an
14	expert on addiction, I have no training to discuss
15	medical issues of addiction.
16	BY MR. HILL:
17	Q. One of the things that you found very
18	compelling in this case was the statement contained
19	in Kathy Simon's deposition as to what her mother
20	told her about cigarette smoking. Do you agree with
21	that, Dr. Lipartito?
22	A. That's certainly one of the things I took
23	note of, yes.
24	Q. All right, and your understanding as to
25	when that conversation occurred, to put the
0204
1	appropriate context, was when; when did Mary Simon
2	have this conversation with her daughter Kathy Simon
3	about smoking?
4	A. I can't really recall sitting here what
5	dates may have been offered in that part of the
6	depositions or in those depositions. What I recall
7	is that she had a conversation with Kathy, either
8	when she was growing up or when she was a young woman
9	and may have been smoking herself, you know, but --
10	so, I think Kathy Simon was born in 1947, so possibly
11	in the 60s or the 50s. It's just a little unclear
12	exactly when that conversation took place.
13	Q. One of the things we know about that
14	conversation is that it occurred before Kathy Simon
15	graduated high school in 1964. Do you agree with
16	that?
17	A. Again, I don't have any way to agree with
18	it, but that's because I'd have to go back and really
19	look carefully to try to parse out the date, but that
20	seems to be generally within my recollection, that it
21	was sometime when they were -- when Kathy Simon was
22	growing up and under her mother's care and was, you
23	know, a teenager or a young woman. So that's
24	relatively consistent with what I remember.
25	Q. Sure. And do you have -- well, you did
0205
1	both volume 1 sand 2, and quite frankly, given the
2	time, I don't know that I want to walk you through
3	Kathy Simon's deposition, but if you are curious,
4	it's at page 37 where she talks about, "I don't think
5	I was out of high school and I graduated high school
6	in 1964." Does that have some resonance with you as
7	to when this conversation occurred?
8	A. Yeah, I mean, I could look, but, you know,
9	again, I think I was saying it's probably when she
10	was, you know, with her mother or as a young woman
11	and I believe she had started smoking or been
12	detected as smoking. And, so, my sense was it must
13	have been either late 50s or early 60s, you know,
14	based on what I remember from the depositions. So,
15	yeah, that's roughly consistent.
16	Q. And one of the warnings that Mary Simon
17	provided to Kathy Simon sometime before 1964 about
18	smoking was that she shouldn't smoke because she will
19	get addicted to it and can't quit?
20	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
21	THE WITNESS: Yeah, I think as I recall, I
22	recall the word being "hooked," but I think
23	everyone took that to indicate something like an
24	addiction, right.
25
0206
1	BY MR. HILL:
2	Q. And, so, you understood that to mean Kathy
3	Simon explaining in a sworn deposition testimony that
4	her mother, before 1964, was expressing the addictive
5	nature of cigarette smoking?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. And the way in which Mary Simon would, of
8	course, know about the addictive nature of cigarette
9	smoking is if she herself was addicted to nicotine in
10	cigarettes before 1964; would you agree with that?
11	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
12	THE WITNESS: No.
13	BY MR. HILL:
14	Q. So you think that Mary Simon, in offering
15	this statement to her daughter before 1964, wasn't
16	expressing the thought that she herself was addicted?
17	A. Again, I don't really know what was behind
18	that. You know, I don't have any evidence that
19	that's what she was saying. I think I've already
20	said that there was publicly available and in
21	circulation much information about the addictive
22	nature of tobacco or getting hooked on cigarettes,
23	things like that were in discussion in periods before
24	1964.
25	Q. Well, one of the things that you talked
0207
1	about was quitting, folks that were able to kick the
2	nicotine addiction in the 50s was increasing. Do you
3	recall that testimony?
4	A. I think actually what I pointed to was
5	evidence from newspapers and such sources that
6	discussed the numbers of people that had quit and
7	that those numbers grew over time.
8	Q. And the numbers begin to increase in the
9	50s, do you agree with that?
10	A. You know, I'd have to go back and look at
11	all the data that I have, but I think I've seen
12	numbers from the 50s, the 60s, the 70s and beyond
13	that talk about numbers of people that quit either
14	within a time frame of a year or two or more
15	cumulatively, and I think, over time, the cumulative
16	number certainly would have gone up and did go up.
17	Q. Well, let me ask you this way: In your
18	questioning with Mr. Davis, I didn't hear you talk
19	about the Frank Statement. Do you know what the
20	Frank Statement is, Dr. Lipartito?
21	A. Yes, I do.
22	Q. And what do you understand the Frank
23	Statement to have been?
24	A. The Frank Statement was an advertisement
25	placed in a number of newspapers in the United
0208
1	States, I think it's 1954,1 don't remember the exact
2	day. It was an advertisement discussing the issues
3	about smoking, health and research that had come out
4	and it was written or published or paid for, I don't
5	know exactly its background, by tobacco companies.
6	Q. Do you understand that the information in
7	the Frank Statement was that the tobacco industry was
8	promising they were going to be looking for any
9	harmful ingredients in their products, and that if
10	they were found, they would take them out?
11	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
12	THE WITNESS: I remember statements to
13	that effect. I have to actually look at the Frank
14	Statement again, but I suspect that's true because
15	I certainly recall statements of that sort at
16	various times, but, yeah, that could well be one
17	of the things in the Frank Statement.
18	BY MR. HILL:
19	Q. And do you have any -- as a historian, Dr.
20	Lipartito, do you have any understanding as to the
21	context surrounding why it was that the Frank
22	Statement was put out by the tobacco industry in
23	1954?
24	A. So I think, again, this is part of both
25	the Frank Statement and other things that I've
0209
1	discussed that I've seen in which there were
2	sometimes statements or responses or interviews with
3	tobacco industry people in the context of various
4	reports on various studies, research and reports
5	linking smoking to diseases, lung cancer and others
6	in this time period.
7	Q. Is it your understanding, Dr. Lipartito,
8	that the Frank Statement was the tobacco industry's
9	response to the increasing number of folks who were
10	stopping using their product?
11	A. My sense is that it looked at, in the
12	broader context of tobacco industry statements, that
13	this was a statement about their position on an issue
14	that was part of public debate and, you know, beyond
15	that, it appeared once in the newspapers. That's, I
16	think, the most significant part of it for me, that
17	it was part of the public information universe that I
18	studied.
19	Q. Well, and my question is little more
20	specific than that, so I'll ask it again.
21	Is it your understanding that the reason
22	that the Frank Statement was published in all these
23	newspapers was that it was the industry's response to
24	the number of folks who were walking away from their
25	product, that is, the product of cigarettes?
0210
1	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: I really have no opinion on
3	that or insight that that. It's not what I was
4	looking at. I was looking at things that actually
5	appeared in reading those.
6	BY MR. HILL:
7	Q. And the reason that you don't have any
8	opinion or insight in that area, Dr. Lipartito, is
9	that you have not reviewed any of the thousands of
10	internal tobacco documents that have become public
11	after the death of Mary Simon, have you?
12	A. I have not because I did not see them as
13	relevant to the research that I was doing nor the
14	opinions that I was forming.
15	Q. And as a historian, were you at least
16	curious as to what tobacco was saying to itself when
17	it thought no one was listening as compared to what
18	they were saying publicly about the use of their
19	products?
20	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
21	THE WITNESS: Beyond curious, perhaps,
22	but, I mean, again, I was trying to concentrate,
23	following the methodology I've described, trying
24	to concentrate on doing good historical research
25	that could answer the question what did the public
0211
1	know, what was available to the public, what
2	sources of information were available to Mary
3	Simon. There's no evidence in anything that I saw
4	that Mary Simon ever read or had taken notice of
5	Frank Statement or any other tobacco company's
6	statements.
7	BY MR. HILL:
8	Q. Well, now, let's be fair and candid, Dr.
9	Lipartito. The Frank Statement, you understand, was
10	published in every major newspaper in the United
11	States, do you agree?
12	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: Yeah. I don't know the
14	exact number, but it was published in many, many
15	newspapers, that's true.
16	BY MR. HILL:
17	Q. Well, you understand it was published in
18	every major newspaper, would you agree with that?
19	A. Yeah, I mean, I think so, depending how we
20	define major. I've seen it in multiple newspapers
21	and I think I've seen newspapers in smaller towns
22	where it didn't appear. So, depending how you define
23	major, I suppose that's true, but it appeared in many
24	newspapers for sure.
25	Q. You've talked about Pittsburgh, and if I'm
0212
1	paraphrasing you inaccurately, let me know. You've
2	characterized Pittsburgh as one of the cities that
3	was on the cutting edge of smoking and health. Is
4	that accurate, Dr. Lipartito?
5	A. What I would say is that Pittsburgh was
6	on --1 think was a city that had very strong public
7	health resources and that many of the issues being
8	discussed on smoking and health appeared in
9	Pittsburgh forums and Pittsburgh newspapers and it
10	wasn't surprising to me, because it was a major city
11	with major health facilities and other resources,
12	that meant that it would have been, you know, an area
13	where much of this information was widely available.
14	Q. And do you have any reason to doubt as a
15	historian that the Frank Statement appeared in 1954
16	in Pittsburgh Post Gazette?
17	A. Yeah, I believe it did appear in the
18	Pittsburgh Post Gazette.
19	Q. And, so, I want to sort of dispense with
20	the suggestion that there's no evidence that Mary
21	Simon read the Frank Statement. Do you have any
22	reason to believe that she was not exposed to the
23	Frank Statement but exposed to every other article in
24	the Pittsburgh Post Gazette talking about the health
25	effects of smoking?
0213
1	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: Well, I think I would say
3	the same thing, in that I've answered other times
4	about specific documents that she may have seen.
5	I don't know which specific articles or documents
6	she may have seen over the course of her life. I
7	don't know that she saw the Frank Statement, I
8	don't know that she didn't see the Frank
9	Statement. I think what I actually said, though,
10	was I saw no evidence from the case materials or
11	the depositions that she had exhibited any --
12	there was no evidence of her being influenced by
13	company statements. That's what I think I said.
14	BY MR. HILL:
15	Q. You would agree with me, Dr. Lipartito,
16	that the odds of Mary Simon having been exposed to
17	the Frank Statement are just as good as the odds she
18	was exposed to any of the other articles that you'd
19	spent a great deal of time talking about earlier in
20	your questioning with Mr. Davis?
21	A. I think that would vary a little bit. If
22	you mean any one article, then I would say the Frank
23	Statement could be constituted -- could be seen as an
24	article since it appeared in the newspaper once as
25	did any -- as did all the other articles that
0214
1	appeared once. So, in that sense, yes.
2	But if you talk about the Frank Statement
3	versus the collective body of information about
4	smoking and health and its risks, then I would say
5	that the odds are actually greater that she would
6	have seen some of that information about the risks of
7	smoking versus seeing the Frank Statement. I would
8	also say that it's more likely that she saw the
9	reports on the Surgeon General's report than the
10	Frank Statement, but it's hard to make that -- give
11	you any kind of more precise estimate.
12	Q. Let's talk about the research that you've
13	done in this case and talk specifically about the
14	Pittsburgh Post Gazette. You talked earlier in your
15	questioning with Mr. Davis about reviewing all of the
16	materials or all of the articles that had been
17	published over a period of time, and I don't want to
18	put words in your mouth and correct me if I'm wrong,
19	but what you have done in this case has not been to
20	pull all articles that have in some way touched upon
21	smoking and health for 20 or 30 years of time that
22	you believe Mary Simon to have read the Pittsburgh
23	Post Gazette, is that accurate?
24	A. So do you mean in the research I did, do I
25	have -- have I made -- do I have available on my
0215
1	reliance list all the articles in that time period
2	that appear in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette on that
3	topic?
4	Q. Correct.
5	A. Okay. No, probably not. I don't think I
6	have all of the articles, but I do think that more
7	than sufficient base of research to be able to draw
8	conclusions. And as I think, I said historical
9	methodology never requires that one read everything,
10	one has to read a sufficient amount that one can be
11	certain that one has seen what the evidence
12	represents in terms of what happened.
13	Q. And the reliance list materials were either
14	pulled by you or pulled by a research associate under
15	your direction or pulled by somebody else over which
16	you did not supervise their work, correct?
17	A. The Pittsburgh material, Pittsburgh Post
18	Gazette material ?
19	Q. Correct.
20	A. Yes. Yes, that represents the different
21	sources of research, I would say.
22	Q. Do you know whether or not the Frank
23	Statement appears in your reliance material for the
24	Pittsburgh Post Gazette in 1954?
25	A. I don't know if it's in that part of the
0216
1	collection or if I did go back and confirm that it
2	was in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette in 19 --1 have my
3	research assistant go back and confirm that it was in
4	the Pittsburgh Post Gazette in 1954.
5	Q. Does the announcement by the tobacco
6	industry collectively in 1954 that has been called
7	the Frank Statement appear anywhere in your reliance
8	materials, the statement itself?
9	A. Yeah, I think it appears in multiple
10	newspaper collections that I have there on my
11	reliance list.
12	Q. But it's not any one that Mary Simon would
13	have read or that you suspect Mary Simon to have
14	read, correct?
15	A. Again, the Frank Statement is the same in
16	every newspaper. It was in the Pittsburgh paper.
17	She may or may not have seen it.
18	Q. Let's talk also about Surgeon General
19	reports, and you understand that the historians that
20	have reviewed this material -- let me start over.
21	With respect to the Surgeon General's
22	report, you also understand that, as a historian,
23	that the tobacco industry could have a response of
24	their own with respect to the Surgeon General's
25	findings that implicated smoking and health. Would
0217
1	you agree with that?
2	A. At different times, they did respond and
3	they were asked to respond or information appeared in
4	articles discussing the Surgeon General's report,
5	yes, that's true.
6	Q. And the bulk of times, the message on
7	behalf of the tobacco industry, including R.J.
8	Reynolds, was to criticize the Surgeon General
9	reports and claim that there was no good science
10	establishing the link between smoking and the
11	development of, say, lung cancer?
12	A. So what I recall and, again, since there's
13	multiple statements in different times and different
14	contexts, but say we are talking about the Surgeon
15	General's report '64,1 believe the statements were
16	that the evidence is still not convincing to them or
17	that more research should be done or that, you know,
18	this is the beginning of something that needs to be
19	followed up. Those were the types of statements I'm
20	recalling.
21	Q. And would you agree that the tenor of the
22	tobacco industry's responses to the Surgeon General
23	reports was categorically to call invalid the
24	findings expressed by the Surgeon General?
25	A. Well, I mean, since you are talking about
0218
1	tenor, I think it's important to remember that these
2	appear in context, so they are usually appearing
3	within an article discussing definitive findings of
4	the Surgeon General, a response by the tobacco
5	company of the sort that I just described, and then
6	concluding with the headline that the Surgeon General
7	found that smoking causes lung cancer, smoking is a
8	health hazard, smoking has been, you know, confirmed
9	and indicted.
10	So, yes, if you are talking about the
11	tenor, their position is to express a certain sense
12	of skepticism or disagreement, which I think is well
13	known and it's documented in my research, but beyond
14	that, that's, again, one small part of what I look
15	at.
16	Q. Well, the disagreement that was expressed
17	by the tobacco industry in the face of findings by
18	the Surgeon General was to suggest that there was no
19	definitive link between cigarette smoking and lung
20	cancer; would you agree with that?
21	A. You know, I have to really look at a
22	specific document. I said what I said, which was
23	they expressed the need for more research or still
24	not conclusive in their view, things of that sort are
25	what I'm recalling. Probably would have to look at
0219
1	more specific statements and documents to get beyond
2	that.
3	Q. In your questioning earlier, you referenced
4	the public debate cigarette controversy, I believe it
5	was, with respect to the Reader's Digest articles.
6	Do you recall that, Dr. Lipartito?
7	A. I recall a couple of articles in Reader's
8	Digest with titles that included that, yes.
9	Q. And do you understand the "cigarette
10	controversy" to have been you've got the Surgeon
11	General on one side expressing the opinion that
12	cigarette smoking causes lung cancer and the tobacco
13	industry on the other claiming there is insufficient
14	evidence, unknown data, and just the link isn't quite
15	clear; is that a general characterization of the
16	"cigarette controversy" ?
17	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: It's too general for me to
19	really agree with. Some of those articles, I
20	think, we are referring to are not in reference to
21	the Surgeon General's report but were in an
22	earlier period the 1950s. It's hard for me to
23	agree given the variation there.
24	BY MR. HILL:
25	Q. Sure. Well, let me ask you a little more
0220
1	artful question then. As a historian who has been
2	paid in excess of $400,000 to research this issue at
3	the request of the tobacco industry, are you of the
4	opinion that the tobacco industry's response for
5	decades to announcements by any source regarding the
6	smoking effects -- the health effects associated with
7	smoking was to claim that there was no causal link or
8	that there wasn't sufficient data or to generally
9	call into doubt the link between cigarette smoking
10	and cancer?
11	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
12	THE WITNESS: So the tobacco industry
13	statements expressed a variety of positions
14	indicating disagreements or asking for -- calling
15	for more research or disputing findings, but the
16	overwhelming body of evidence and information that
17	I reviewed suggested very clearly that that
18	message was a small minority of the total
19	information that Mary Simon would have read.
20	BY MR. HILL:
21	Q. Well, let me ask you this: Not having
22	reviewed the thousands of records that constitute the
23	internal tobacco documents, you don't know what their
24	plan and intention was in terms of creating a
25	"psychological crutch" for folks who would otherwise
0221
1	consider quitting snowing?
2	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
3	THE WITNESS: That may be, but, again, I
4	think I was looking at the publicly available
5	information that Mary Simon and people like her
6	would have seen, and whatever ideas, plans or
7	thoughts people had in closed doors or private are
8	simply not that relevant or, indeed, in this case,
9	I think, relevant at all, nor is it necessary to
10	look at those things to conclude that the
11	information clearly showed that the vast majority
12	of things that were available to Mary Simon
13	indicated smoking was a serious health risk and
14	she should stop.
15	BY MR. HILL:
16	Q. So, as the historian hired by the R.J.
17	Reynolds in this case to offer opinions, it is of no
18	consequence to you whether the tobacco industry,
19	including R.J. Reynolds, engaged in decades long
20	campaign to put in the mind of addicted smokers that
21	there was no sufficient evidence to justify them
22	quitting smoking; that's not of concern to you?
23	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
24	THE WITNESS: Well, what's a concern to me
25	is what information was available, and while some
0222
1	skepticism and disputes on the part of the tobacco
2	company spokespeople or calling into question
3	certain aspects of the Surgeon General report were
4	definitely present, I've never said otherwise.
5	Again, my research was on what was the
6	overwhelming body of information available, and
7	while those things occurred, they did not
8	constitute the overwhelming message or the clear
9	message that I think came through when one reviews
10	all of the available information about smoking and
11	health in Mary Simon's lifetime.
12	BY MR. HILL:
13	Q. What you are talking about as a historian
14	is a body of knowledge as opposed to the acceptance
15	of that knowledge by any individuals in society,
16	including Mary Simon?
17	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: I think I'm talking about a
19	combination. I'm talking, obviously, to a large
20	extent about the knowledge or perhaps the
21	information, even better, or media and
22	communication, not just purely medical or
23	scientific knowledge. I think I discussed a
24	variety of types of information bearing on the
25	issues that I'm giving opinions on, and in that,
0223
1	I'm trying to link that information, as far as
2	it's possible, to other types of activities such
3	as behavior of quitting or acknowledgement. In
4	the case of Mary Simon, that she understood and
5	knew the risks because she had been informed of
6	them.
7	So the answer is, I think, you know, a lot
8	of it's about information, a lot of is about
9	awareness, and in addition, that's reinforced by
10	research into certain things like people quitting
11	or the statements by Mary Simon that she had
12	knowledge of or was being directly informed in
13	other ways of the dangers of what she was doing.
14	BY MR. HILL:
15	Q. Move to strike as nonresponsive.
16	One of the things that you have reviewed
17	and collected in this case are certain polls that
18	were conducted of folks understanding of disease
19	causation from cigarette smoking.
20	A. There's a wide range of polls. I think
21	some bear on that, some bear on people having heard
22	about various reports. I think some of what you just
23	characterized is in some of the polls and my
24	reliances as well as other things.
25	Q. One of the things that you have on the
0224
1	reliance list are Gallup polls that were published
2	periodically?
3	A. I do have Gallup polls, yes.
4	Q. And some of those Gallup polls involve
5	questions that were asked of folks back in the 1957?
6	A. Yeah, probably should have -- I'd have to
7	look at it specifically to know which one you are
8	referring to.
9	Q. Sure. Do you have the ability to look up
10	materials on your reliance list as you sit here in
11	this deposition?
12	A. I need a computer. I don't have a
13	computer in front of me. Someone had a computer, but
14	they left. So, unless I get a computer, I can't.
15	Q. Well, I understand that you are at a law
16	firm, so that the odds of you being able to find a
17	computer might be slim.
18	The Gallup polls, particularly in 1957,
19	they asked folks about their understanding and belief
20	about whether cigarette smoking caused cancer of the
21	lung. Would you agree that was one of the types of
22	questions that were asked of the folks in 1957?
23	A. I recall a variety of polls asking
24	questions about that, about what the people had heard
25	about the connection between smoking and cancer. I
0225
1	generally recall that sometimes questions about that
2	were asked as well as many other things.
3	Q. Is it your memory of the materials in the
4	Gallup poll that when questions were asked of folks
5	that smoked, the answers were oftentimes different
6	than those provided by the population at large
7	without respect to whether they smoked or didn't
8	smoke?
9	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
10	THE WITNESS: I do recall there were some
11	polls that may have broken down responses that
12	way. Yes, I do recall some.
13	BY MR. HILL:
14	Q. Are those on your reliance list, sir?
15	A. Since I'm recalling them, I believe they
16	are, but I don't --
17	Q. Certainly, if you are going to be citing
18	Gallup polls, you certainly should have on your
19	reliance list information that is germane to the
20	topics specifically about what smokers thought?
21	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
22	THE WITNESS: Yeah, again, I think I do
23	have such polls. I collected a variety of polls
24	that help me determine and measure and get some
25	sense of what I was trying to study, which was
0226
1	wide availability of information, widely
2	circulated, things of that sort.
3	BY MR. HILL:
4	Q. And the way in which we have come down this
5	road, Dr. Lipartito, is my question about the
6	difference between knowledge and acceptance and
7	understanding of the knowledge. Would you agree with
8	me that, generally speaking, the polls showed that
9	folks who were smoking were less convinced about
10	cigarette smoking causing lung cancer than the
11	population as a whole?
12	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: I believe that there's a
14	fair amount of variation in that. It's very hard
15	for me to just say I agree with it because I think
16	polls show different things. I really wouldn't
17	feel comfortable without examining the whole
18	corpus of polls or even looking at one of the
19	polls you are referring to, giving you more than a
20	vague from memory answer. It's really the best I
21	can do under the circumstances.
22	BY MR. HILL:
23	Q. So your understanding doesn't allow you to
24	acknowledge generally that folks that were actual
25	smokers back in, say, 1957 were less convinced than
0227
1	the folks throughout the population of the fact that
2	cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?
3	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: I mean, again, I think that
5	some polls may have shown that, but, you know,
6	unless we are talking about either a very specific
7	poll, if you are asking me to make a general
8	statement, you know, I think it varies and it's
9	really hard for me to give you a conclusive answer
10	without examining, you know, the actual material.
11	BY MR. HILL:
12	Q. And I am talking about a specific poll.
13	I'm talking about the Gallup poll in 1957 that was
14	from December 20th.
15	A. Yeah.
16	Q. That's not something that you have access
17	to as you sit there now?
18	A. I don't now have -- unfortunately, I don't
19	have a computer that I can look at my reliance list.
20	Could I ask that we take a brief break, so
21	I can use the bathroom?
22	MR. HILL: I would never deny anybody
23	that, nor do I have the ability to do that since
24	I'm in West Palm.
25	(Brief recess was taken.)
0228
1	BY MR. HILL:
2	Q. Dr. Lipartito, who do you think more -- who
3	do you think knew more about the dangers of cigarette
4	smoking back in the mid 1930s, 15 or a 17-year-old
5	Mary Simon or a tobacco industry CEO's research
6	scientists; who do you think knew more?
7	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: I don't really have a way to
9	judge that; it's not relevant to what I'm
10	studying.
11	BY MR. HILL:
12	Q. And one of the reasons you don't have any
13	way to judge that is that you haven't endeavored to
14	actually look at the tobacco internal company
15	documents, correct?
16	A. The reason I don't judge that is it's not
17	something that was part of my research and nor do I
18	need to judge it in order to form the conclusion and
19	do the research that I did. So I simply didn't study
20	it and nor would I in this case.
21	Q. And have you endeavored to decide for
22	yourself as to whether or not there was a deception
23	perpetrated by the tobacco industry for decades on
24	the American public?
25	A. Again, I'd say that's really not necessary
0229
1	for me to formulate an opinion on the issues that I
2	studied, which had to do with public information and
3	public awareness. It's not necessary to address that
4	issue, and as I said, the important thing about the
5	research is to focus on resources, research and
6	sources that can be directly related to and are
7	useful for the question under study.
8	Q. True. And one of the questions was, you
9	know, did you have the awareness or the understanding
10	of folks in the American public. So I guess your
11	answer, then, it would be unimportant to you to have
12	insight into the decades long efforts by the tobacco
13	industry to intercept folks on their way to quitting
14	their product; that doesn't matter to you, does it?
15	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
16	THE WITNESS: Not quite sure what you mean
17	by that. All I'm saying is that I looked at the
18	publicly available information to Mary Simon and
19	everyone else, including the tobacco companies
20	information was widely available, widely
21	discussed. Whatever tobacco companies may have
22	done or whatever anyone may have done in private
23	or for other reasons or intentions, those things
24	simply don't relate and are not necessary to
25	address when studying the questions of what was
0230
1	the publicly available sources and type of
2	information that Mary Simon would have seen.
3	BY MR. HILL:
4	Q. And as a historian who has talked about and
5	introduced at this time period in American business
6	in general, are you telling us, Dr. Lipartito, you
7	have no opinion as to whether or not the tobacco
8	industry was deceptive in terms of way in which it
9	published and failed to publish certain information
10	regarding their products; that's not something that
11	you have any idea about?
12	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: I mean, again, it's not
14	something I've studied, that I've done research on
15	that I can offer an informed expert opinion on. I
16	can only offer kind of a general speculation, but
17	I'm working very hard to make sure that I'm
18	separating out, as I think, again, historians are
19	obligated to do, any poorly formed opinions or
20	uncertain guesses from clear evidence and firm
21	conclusions.
22	BY MR. HILL:
23	Q. Well, let's talk about the speculative
24	issue with that type of testimony. You just recently
25	published a book, did you not, entitled, "Corporate
0231
1	Responsibility: The American Experience"?
2	A. I did.
3	Q. All right, and the focus of that book was
4	to look at, from a historical perspective, the way in
5	which corporate responsibility has been addressed in
6	businesses in the United States, do you agree?
7	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: I would say better
9	characterization would be look at historical
10	evolution by business and corporate responsibility
11	in society, not just on businesses, but among a
12	wide range of entities and actors bearing on that
13	question.
14	BY MR. HILL:
15	Q. And as one of the authors of a book
16	entitled, "Corporate Responsibility: The American
17	Experience," would you agree with me that a company
18	or companies that were decades actively concealing
19	the dangerous health effects of their product would
20	not be exhibiting very good corporate responsibility?
21	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form. Also
22	outside the scope.
23	THE WITNESS: Yeah, I mean, again, I think
24	I've not done any specific work on tobacco
25	industry in this regard or really any other
0232
1	individual firms or industries. What I do in the
2	book and what the book discusses are different
3	ideas about what the realm and expectations and
4	practices and ideas and debates about corporate
5	responsibility are. I think it's very hard for a
6	historian to sort of give a blank judgment this is
7	and this is not corporate responsibility; in fact,
8	that's not what we do in the book. We endeavor to
9	talk about the evolution of ideas, thoughts,
10	practices, debates as a historian. That's what I
11	do.
12	BY MR. HILL:
13	Q. Would you agree that an industry that
14	creates from whole cloth a false conspiracy about --
15	excuse me, a false controversy about the health
16	effects of their product would not be exhibiting very
17	good corporate responsibility?
18	MR. DAVIS: Object to the form. Also
19	outside the scope.
20	THE WITNESS: Yeah, I mean, again, you can
21	puff about hypotheticals all day, but I have no
22	expertise I can bring to bear on trying to answer
23	a hypothetical question like that.
24	BY MR. HILL:
25	Q. Because you haven't researched the
0233
1	tobacco -- internal tobacco documents, you don't know
2	the extent to which that's a hypothetical or whether
3	that's an accurate statement of what happened with
4	the tobacco industry for decades?
5	MR. DAVIS: Same objections.
6	THE WITNESS: Again, I haven't done any
7	research on those issues with regard to the
8	tobacco industry.
9	MR. HILL: Those are all the questions
10	that I have for you, sir.
11	THE WITNESS: Okay.
12	MR. DAVIS: I just have a handful, and
13	I'll make this very brief.
14	MR. HILL: Well, I mean, I'm going to
15	object on the -- now it's direct, cross, direct,
16	and now you are trying to recross, which isn't
17	permissible, but I'm objecting nonetheless, but
18	I'm not stopping you, obviously, from asking
19	questions. I might have some follow-up based on
20	that.
21	MR. DAVIS: I understand your position. I
22	understand. Thank you, Jack.
23	RECROSS EXAMINATION
24	BY MR. DAVIS:
25	Q. Dr. Lipartito, were you prepared today to
0234
1	discuss any documents or materials on your reliance
2	list which were publicly available to Mary Simon
3	during her lifetime?
4	A. Sorry, repeat the question.
5	Q. Yeah. For the purposes of today's
6	deposition, were you prepared to discuss today any
7	documents or materials on your reliance list which
8	was publicly available to Mary Simon during her
9	lifetime?
10	A. Yes, I'm happy to discuss any documents
11	that I put on my reliance list.
12	Q. Were you prepared to discuss that material
13	with counsel for Kathy Simon, Mr. Hill?
14	A. Sorry, you have to run that by me again.
15	Q. Sure. Were you prepared to discuss that
16	material with Mr. Hill, who is on the phone and
17	represents the Plaintiff in this case?
18	A. Yes. Again, I'm fully prepared to talk
19	about anything on my reliance list.
20	Q. Did he ask you questions about what he
21	wanted to ask you?
22	A. He did.
23	MR. HILL: Object to the form.
24	THE WITNESS: As far as I know.
0235
1	BY MR. DAVIS:
2	Q. And how did -- with respect to the
3	Pittsburgh newspaper collection that you had received
4	from another historian, how did you verify the
5	quality of that collection?
6	A. In that case, partly by doing my own
7	research into the Pittsburgh paper, albeit at a later
8	period, so I had an understanding of the nature of
9	the paper and how it operated, and then partly by
10	comparing what I was finding in Pittsburgh to lists
11	that I had of key dates to see that things that were
12	of national significance that appeared generally on
13	this date in other places, appeared in Pittsburgh,
14	and then finally by comparing what I was seeing in
15	that collection in Pittsburgh with other newspapers
16	that I had either done research on or had verified
17	myself.
18	Q. And based upon your review of that
19	collection of Pittsburgh newspapers before --1 think
20	those are for the newspapers in Pittsburgh before
21	1970?
22	A. Maybe 1972. I can't remember the exact
23	date.
24	Q. For that collection of Pittsburgh
25	newspapers, what was your assessment of the quality
0236
1	of that collection?
2	A. So, based on what I was seeing from those
3	papers in the 1950s, 60s and maybe up to 1972, very
4	consistent with the sort of reporting that was done
5	in similar papers covering the major issues. From
6	all perspectives, it struck me as being a very good
7	representation of the sort of material that reflects
8	the research that I've done elsewhere.
9	Q. Was the quality check that you did for that
10	Pittsburgh newspaper collection consistent with the
11	historical method?
12	A. Yeah, I think --
13	MR. HILL: Object to the form.
14	THE WITNESS: What historians do is they
15	do research, accumulate information, use that
16	information to do further research and verify what
17	they are finding. So very much a part of how
18	historians operate.
19	BY MR. DAVIS:
20	Q. With respect to the Palm Beach newspaper
21	collections that are on your reliance list that
22	another historian prepared and that you reviewed for
23	this case, how did you verify the quality of that
24	collection?
25	A. In that case --
0237
1	MR. HILL: Object to the form. Outside
2	the scope of my questioning.
3	THE WITNESS: In that case, I more
4	directly went and essentially rechecked, you know,
5	a sample of what I had to see if the material I
6	saw in the Palm Beach Post that others had done
7	was consistent with the material I would have
8	collected had I done it on my own. I was able to
9	verify that, yes, it was consistent to what I had
10	accumulated had I done the research myself.
11	BY MR. DAVIS:
12	Q. And what was your assessment about the
13	quality of that collection of Palm Beach newspapers?
14	A. Again, I found it --
15	MR. HILL: Form.
16	THE WITNESS: Again, I found it complete,
17	covering the issues that would be found in other
18	papers at the same time, giving a good
19	representation of what the -- what we know from
20	other research, the nature of public information
21	was throughout the country.
22	BY MR. DAVIS:
23	Q. Was your verification of the Palm Beach
24	newspaper collection consistent with the historical
25	method?
0238
1	A. Yes.
2	MR. HILL: Object to the form.
3	BY MR. DAVIS:
4	Q. And you were asked several questions about
5	the Frank Statement by counsel for Plaintiff. Is
6	there any evidence that Mary Simon was influenced in
7	any way by the Frank Statement?
8	A. I saw no --
9	MR. HILL: Object to the form.
10	THE WITNESS: I saw no evidence to that
11	effect.
12	BY MR. DAVIS:
13	Q. Was there any evidence in the case that I
14	saw that Mary Simon was influenced by any statement
15	by any tobacco company in deciding to start to smoke?
16	A. I saw no --
17	MR. HILL: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: I saw no evidence.
19	MR. HILL: Outside the scope.
20	BY MR. DAVIS:
21	Q. Was there any evidence from -- that you
22	saw -- strike that.
23	Was there any evidence from the testimony
24	that was given in this case that you reviewed that
25	showed that Mary Simon was influenced by any
0239
1	statement by a tobacco company in continuing to
2	smoke?
3	A. I could find no evidence.
4	MR. HILL: Foundation, outside the scope.
5	BY MR. DAVIS:
6	Q. Was there tobacco industry statements in
7	every article that discussed the Surgeon General
8	reports that you've seen over time?
9	A. Sorry, in the '64 Surgeon General's
10	report?
11	Q. Yes, sir.
12	A. No, certainly not in every article, no.
13	Q. And that's all the questions I have -- and
14	let me back up.
15	Have you offered opinions in response to
16	my questions to a reasonable degree of professional
17	certainty within your field?
18	A. I have.
19	MR. DAVIS: Thank you.
20	MR. HILL: Nothing else.
21	MR. DAVIS: Okay. Thank you. We will let
22	the doctor go.
23	Do you want to --
24	MR. HILL: Yeah, I suspect this is going
25	to sound petty, Todd, and I apologize for it in
0240
1	advance.
2	I understand that we are responsible for
3	Dr. Lipartito's fees. You can rest assured I
4	don't have any intention of paying for, you know,
5	your several hours of direct examination with him
6	and we can take that issue up if we need to, but
7	that's not going to be on my dime, certainly.
8	MR. DAVIS: Yeah, I guess we can talk
9	about that later, Jack. I mean, if you want to, I
10	guess you want to --1 don't know how we have been
11	doing this in the past in terms of timing for the
12	payment, but I guess you can proceed under that
13	and we will talk further about the limits of what
14	that amount is going to be, if any.
15	MR. HILL: Sure, and I just didn't want --
16	I didn't want to sit silent and have you or
17	anybody else send me the full boat for what I
18	anticipate your attempts to be your direct
19	examination of your expert.
20	MR. DAVIS: I understand your position.
21	And the witness will read and sign.
22	MR. HILL: Take care.
23	(Thereupon, the deposition was concluded at
24	approximately 8:15 p.m. Signature and formalities
25	were not waived.)
