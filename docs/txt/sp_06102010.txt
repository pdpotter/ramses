JOAN HOFF, PH.D.,
called as a witness herein, having been first duly
sworn, was examined and testified as follows:
EXAMINATION
BY MR. GDANSKI:
Q. Good morning, Dr. Hoff. My name is Jon
Gdanski.
A. Yes, I know.
Q. I'm going to take your deposition today.
I've deposed you before in another case. I hope you
remember. I hope it was relatively eventful, and I
know that you've had your deposition taken numerous
times, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. You're familiar with all the
procedures; wait for me, I wait for you. If you don't
understand a question, just let me know, okay?
A. Yes.
Q. If you need a break, just let me know.

Q. So what year would that be?
A. That would have been in 1935.
Q. What brand of cigarettes did Dominick Tullo
smoke throughout his life?
A. He smoked practically everything that you
could mention. The list in the deposition goes on and
on; at least seven or eight different kinds of
cigarettes, at least.
Q. Do you remember the names of those seven or
eight different brands?
A. I'm not sure I remember all of them but
starting with Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Kent, Marlboro,
Parliament, I'm not so sure Merit wasn't mentioned at
some point; just an entirely long list of cigarettes
because he seemed to smoke anything that he could get
his hands on. Chesterfield I think was mentioned.
Q. Do you know who makes, for example, Kent
cigarettes?
A. Kent is a Lorillard product, as far as I
know, or -- I'm not sure. I thought it was Lorillard,
or Philip Morris.
Q. Do you know who makes, for example,
Parliament cigarettes?
A. I don't offhand, no.
Q. Marlboro cigarettes, do you know who makes

Because it's through a video teleconference machine,
there's probably going to be some lag or some time
where the machine might look like it's freezing, and
if you don't catch what I'm saying because of that,
just let me know, okay?
A. Yes, I will.
Q. Great. What case are we here today to
discuss?
A. This is the Mary Tullo case.
Q. And what is the name of the smoker?
A. The smoker was Dominick Tullo.
Q. And what is Dominick Tullo's date of birth?
A. He was born in 1923.
Q. Where was he born?
A. He was born actually in Brooklyn.
Q. Do you know how old he was when he met his
wife, my client, Mary Tullo?
A. According to the deposition, she says they
met as children when they were both about 11 years
old.
Q. And do you know how old Dominick Tullo was
when he began smoking?
A. Again, according to the deposition, around
the age of 12. No one was completely specific about
it but 12 seemed to be the age that was given.

those?
A. Yeah, Philip Morris.
Q. And what materials have you reviewed in
preparation for this deposition today?
A. I've reviewed all of the depositions, and
then I've reviewed educational material for the state
of New York where Dominick Tullo was educated, and
then I've reviewed newspapers in the areas where he
lived from 1923 on.
Q. Let's go over the depositions. Which
depositions have you reviewed?
A. I think I've reviewed all of them; Mary
Tullo's, which was four volumes, quite long.
Q. Yeah.
A. Her children, Louis and Stephanie; then
several nieces, I read those depositions. There was a
first cousin whose deposition I read, and then there
were two grandchildren.
Q. Do you have those depositions there with
you today?
A. I have copies of the depositions, yes.
Q. Let's just quickly run down the names of
the people so I make sure -- There's quite a few so I
just want to make sure --
A. I can easily do that for you. The two

children were Louis and Stephanie.
Q. Okay.
A. And then there was, let's see, the niece --
one niece was Jennifer Bova, another niece was Phyllis
Grande, G-r-a-n-d-e, Laubacher, L-a-u-b-a-c-h-e-r.
Then another, let's see, a first cousin whose name was
Ann Behrens, B-e-h-r-e-n-s; and then two
grandchildren, one Amy Miller and the other was Peter
Cassino, C-a-s-s-i-n-o. I think that was it. Did I
mention, let's see, Jennifer Bova?
Q. Yep, you got her.
A. Okay. Then that's it.
Q. Did you create any notes or a report in
this case?
A. I have notes from the depositions, yes.
Q. You wrote those or they're typed?
A. They're handwritten.
Q. Do you have those there with you today?
A. I do.
Q. Let's hand those to the court reporter and
have them marked, please, as the first exhibit.
MR. STOEVER: Jon, we had the notes
scanned this morning and I have a copy here that I'll
email to you right now.
MR. GDANSKI: That would be great.

(Exhibit No. 1 was marked.)
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Dr. Hoff, what else did
you bring with you today to the deposition?
A. In addition to the depositions themselves,
I brought several emails that I sent to Shook, Hardy &
Bacon containing material from the Palm Beach Post
newspaper. There are about four or five of those
emails.
Q. Those are emails where you're sending
Shook-Hardy materials you're finding through your
research?
A. Yes.
Q. And that was research specific to this case
or research in general?
A. This was specific to this case.
Q. What was it about this case that prompted
you to do additional research? And I understand
you've been deposed in other Florida cases before.
A. Yes. In this instance, since one of the
newspapers involved was the Palm Beach Post, I had
previously researched it for the years that would
cover the time that Dominick Tullo was reading that
newspaper, but I decided -- and I did this with
several other newspapers, not for this case -- but I
decided to go back and have a researcher look at all
Min-U-Script速
of the newspaper articles for January of 1964, and
those were the documents, then, that I sent to Shook,
Hardy & Bacon.
Q. So the additional Palm Beach Post articles
are January 1964?
A. Just for that month, every day in that
month.
Q. Dominick Tullo did not live in Palm Beach
in January of '64, correct?
A. He did not.
Q. Would you agree that the New York Times is
basically considered a paper of record as indicative
of what was being discussed in the papers throughout
the country?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. Just in general, do I agree that it was a
paper of record?
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Yes.
A. Yes.
Q. Why would you include in this case the Palm
Beach Post materials from January of 1964 even though
Dominick Tullo did not live down here then?
A. I decided -- I've done so much newspaper
research that it occurred to me as I went through,
say, the New York Times or some of the Florida papers

or papers for other states that very often what one
can determine is to the extent that a newspaper gave
considerable coverage to the 1964 Surgeon General's
report, that sometimes was an indicator of how much
that particular newspaper then would continue to carry
reports about scientific studies or Surgeon General
messages for the public.
And so what I did, in essence, on the Palm
Beach Post was simply back up to see what they had
done in January of 1964, but I did it for other
newspapers as well.
Q. And did you find your hypothesis to be
correct, that the coverage of the '64 report was
indicative of the level of future coverage?
A. I did. Perhaps not as great as larger
papers in Florida, but to the degree that the Palm
Beach Post covered the story in January, it carried
well over 20 articles for that single month, and
that's a considerable number in my estimation.
Q. In how many of those articles were there
comments by the tobacco companies regarding their
response to the Surgeon General's report?
A. I tallied that up, and I would say in a
good third of them you could find references to the
tobacco companies.

Q. Okay. What else do you have with you at
your deposition today? You have the depositions
you've read, right?
A. Yes.
Q. You have your own personal notes, which
I've received via email already, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you have the correspondence from you
sending materials to Shook, Hardy & Bacon lawyers,
right?
A. Yes. It's not correspondence. It's simply
passing on the scanned data.
Q. Passing on from who? I'm sorry.
A. These went to a paralegal at Shook, Hardy &
Bacon, Vickie Thompson.
Q. Oh, but you did the original research in
the newspaper and found them, correct?
A. I had a research assistant do the research
on the Palm Beach Post.
Q. Okay. When was that?
A. Well, she's been doing it now for several
months, but in terms of the January 1964 article, she
did them probably within the last two weeks.
Q. What's the -- Throughout your career of
testifying for Shook, Hardy & Bacon, what's the latest

repetitious, correct?
A. Well, yes. When you do this kind of
research on general awareness or public awareness of
issues, you can -- you see trends and patterns and you
see, then, duplications; and at that point I usually
decide, whether it's this type of research or research
that I've done on other topics, that you simply stop
it because it becomes, then, a waste of your time and
it won't change the conclusions to any great degree.
Q. You are, though, aware that even after 1990
where you cut off your research, the tobacco companies
still denied what you believe to have been known by
the public en masse, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Let me ask it a little
differently actually.
You are aware that after the 1990s, the
tobacco companies still deny that their product caused
lung cancer and was addictive, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form and
it's outside the scope.
A. Not after the 1990s. I think what you're
asking is in the 1990s, right?
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) After 1990, yes.
MR. STOEVER: Same objections.

period of time that you've examined public awareness
issues?
A. I'm not sure I understand the question.
The latest period of time. . .
Q. Sure. In other words, in this case,
Dominick Tullo, when did he die?
A. He died in 1998.
Q. And at what year are you cutting off your
research for purposes of determining public awareness?
A. I usually cut it off in the -- at the end
of the 1980s; 1990, usually.
Q. So you don't even include any of the '90s;
is that correct?
A. That's true.
Q. Why?
A. Because the material that is available in
the public domain by the end of the 1980s becomes --
it becomes so evident that there is a problem with
smoking and the addictive nature of cigarettes that
the material becomes repetitious, and to do an entire
decade of the '90s wouldn't change the general
awareness information that's out there. It would
simply have increased in the decade of the 1990s.
Q. So before the '90s it wasn't repetitious,
but from the '90s going forward it becomes

Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) The question is, after
1990, you're aware that the tobacco companies still
denied their product caused lung cancer, COPD or was
addictive, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Let me interpose my
objection before you begin to speak because the court
reporter can't take us both down at the same time.
Object to the form and it's outside the
scope of this witness's expertise.
If you think you know, you can answer.
A. No, my research stopped in 1990.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) So you have no idea if
the tobacco companies admitted in 1991 or 2007 that
their product causes lung cancer?
MR. STOEVER: Same objections.
A. Not as an expert witness in this particular
case.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) How about as just a
general human being existing in modern society?
MR. STOEVER: Just to be clear, you're
asking her now for her, you know, lay testimony?
MR. GDANSKI: Yeah.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) I don't know what that
means, Dr. Hoff. You're here on the public awareness
that existed regarding smoking and health, correct?

Dominick Tullo, a person who was born and existed in

A. Yes.

years past 1990, correct?

A. Not for this case, no.

Q. But you've done that research in other
9
cases, correct?
10
A. No. In most other cases the cutoff is
11
1990.
12
Q. And so you don't know, as an expert witness 13
testifying in litigation for Shook, Hardy & Bacon on 14
behalf of the tobacco companies, what occurred 15
regarding smoking and health after 1990?
16
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
17
Misstates her testimony.
18
A. I'm not prepared to answer that as an
19
expert witness because my research, as I said,
20
encompasses most of the 20th century up to 1990. 21
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) When were the Waxman 22
hearings?

country, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Probably in every single newspaper or every
major newspaper the day after the hearings, correct?
A. I would assume so, yes.
Q. And Dominick Tullo was alive when those
happened, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you don't include anything relative to
that in your work in this case, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Why?
A. Because, as I said, once you get into the
1990s, the information there is simply going to
reinforce the kinds of public awareness or general
awareness that I found up to 1990. There wouldn't be
anything coming out in the -- from that point forward
that would change the general conclusions I had
already come to. It simply would have reinforced my
opinion on general awareness.
Q. Well, when did it become -- when did the
public become aware, generally, that smoking
cigarettes causes lung cancer, in your opinion?
A. As I look back at the research for that
entire century, it becomes evident that the specific
Min-U-Script速
mention of lung cancer becomes an issue in national
and regional and local newspapers and ultimately on
television beginning in the early 1950s. There's some
mention of it in the late '40s, but it comes to the
attention, goes into the public domain in the early
1950s.
Q. And then by 1990 it reached, in your
opinion, sort of its pinnacle or crescendo after which
point in time it would be repetitive to society,
correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to form, misstates
her testimony.
A. Basically, that's correct.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Okay. Before 1990 it was
not as well known as it was after 1990, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to form.
A. No, it was quite well known before 1990,
and it just becomes perhaps reinforced after 1990.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) And in 1990 where you cut
off your research, what was the tobacco companies'
position on whether or not their product caused lung
cancer?
MR. STOEVER: Object to form; it's
outside the scope of her expertise.
A. I don't study the positions of the tobacco

companies except to the degree that you can find those
stated in national magazines or newspaper.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) I understand that. I
know that. We all know that about you all.
My question is, to the extent that you can
find their position stated in public magazines or
newspapers in 1990, what was their publicly stated
position on the question of whether or not smoking
cigarettes causes lung cancer?
A. By 1990 they would respond, not in every
case but in cases where they responded to Surgeon
General's reports, it was usually to say that they
either didn't agree completely with the report or that
they thought that more study was needed to document
what the reports were saying.
Q. They responded to more than just Surgeon
General's reports, correct?
A. Yes, but in the '80s leading up to 1990s
there were several major Surgeon General reports.
Q. What were the major Surgeon General's
reports in the 1980s?
A. They would have been the one in '86 on
secondary smoke and the one in 1988 on the addictive
nature of cigarettes.
Q. And neither of those reports dealt

directly, as its main conclusion, with the question of
whether or not smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer cause lung cancer or COPD in smokers, that level of
proof was not sufficient for the tobacco companies,
1
2
or COPD in smokers, correct?
3
A. That's true, because by the 1980s you have
4
the whole scientific field stressing health matters
5
connected with smoking that weren't -- they figured 6
that they had already established and proven the
7
connection with lung cancer and other diseases and 8
they were broadening their scope then to include
9
secondary -- the dangers of secondary smoke, and
10
finally to come to a strong conclusion on the
11
addictive nature of smoking.
12
So there's a slight shift in the scientific
13
emphasis in the '80s because they feel -- the
14
scientists believe by that time that the case with
15
respect to specific diseases has been pretty much
16
proven.
17
Q. I don't mind listening to you talk. It's
18
fine. You know, it's not a big deal to me. I have 19
time here and it's earlier there, but I think you know 20
that that doesn't even almost answer my question. 21
So in order to make it maybe go a little
22
faster today and smoother, because I know you've been 23
deposed many times on this exact subject so I don't 24
want to rehash everything, but if you could answer 25
correct?
A. I don't know because I didn't research the
tobacco companies, specifically.
Q. But you just said a minute ago that it had
already been proven, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you also know that in the '80s the
tobacco companies still said more testing needed to be
done on the question of whether or not smoking
cigarettes causes lung cancer and COPD, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And so what you're saying had already been
proven. I'm asking you now: It was not proven
sufficiently for the tobacco companies, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to form.
A. To the degree that their statements, as I
previously indicated, occurred in the stories about
these specific studies, yes.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Well, you don't know any
more about the tobacco companies than what you've read
in publicly available materials, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Right. So throughout all the publicly
Page 22 Page 24
just my specific questions, I think it will make it a
little bit easier. If you want to talk, that's fine
too. Okay?
MR. STOEVER: Jonathan, those kind of
ad hominem comments are certainly not advancing the
ball here. Dr. Hoff answered your question. She did
it completely, she did it accurately. If you'd like
to go back, we can review the record if that suits available materials you've seen, at no point in time
did they accept the level of proof which was out there
in the medical community in the '50s, '60s, '70s and
'80s on whether or not smoking cigarettes causes lung

you. Otherwise, why don't we just move on without the
9
editorial.
10
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) So, Dr. Hoff, neither of 11
the two Surgeon General's reports you mentioned, the 12
'86 report and the '88 report, dealt specifically
13
with the question of whether or not smoking cigarettes 14
causes lung cancer in smokers or COPD in smokers, 15
correct?
16
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
17
A. The assumption was there because that had
18
already been proven in previous reports. As I said, 19
there was a shift in emphasis, and that's why these 20
two particular reports received such widespread
21
attention on television and in print media.
22
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) And the level of proof to 23
which the question of whether or not smoking
24
cigarettes had been proven to -- had been proven to 25
Page 21 - Page 24 (6)
cancer or COPD, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. Just start the first part of the sentence.
I lost track of it.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) In all of the material
that you reviewed, at no point in time in the '50s,
'60s, '70s or '80s did the tobacco companies accept
the level of proof which was out there on the question
of whether or not smoking cigarettes causes lung
cancer or COPD in smokers?
A. According to the very general statements in
the print media or on television, that's correct, yes.
Q. Do you have any reason to believe that the
tobacco companies knew more than what they were
stating in the print, television or media outlets?
A. I don't have any reason to believe it on
the basis of my research, no.
Q. You've read Ashes to Ashes, right?
A. I haven't read it. I've read reviews of it
by and large, and I have -- I've looked at the book,
obviously, but I haven't read it page by page, no.

read it completely in that deposition either.

Q. Okay. Have you ever discussed your reading
8
of that book with lawyers for Shook, Hardy & Bacon?
9
A. No. No.
10
Q. Even after reading the back cover of that 11
book, you still don't have any reason to believe that 12
tobacco companies knew more than they were telling the 13
public in the '50s, '60s, '70s or '80s?
14
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form. It's 15
outside the scope of the Notice.
16
A. The book itself is primarily aimed at or
17
used -- primarily uses documents from Philip Morris 18
and is really about the Philip Morris company itself; 19
and to that degree, it relies on these internal
20
documents. I'm quite aware of that.
21
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Right. Right. And
22
you're aware that the internal documents point to 23
evidence that the tobacco companies were not being 24
completely forthright with the public in the '50s, 25

MR. STOEVER: Object to the form. It's
outside the scope of this witness's expertise.
A. Yeah, I can't comment on the truth of the
interpretation, but that is the interpretation in the
book.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) You own a copy of that
book, right?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. In your own personal library, personal
collection, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you bought it yourself with your own
money, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Don't you think it's a bit odd that someone
like you who testifies for Shook-Hardy, for Philip
Morris in tobacco litigation on the question of public
awareness of smoking and health would never actually
read the book that you purchased, yourself, with your
own money?
MR. STOEVER: Object to form. It's
argumentative.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) I mean, you're a
historian. Why wouldn't you want to just know what's
Min-U-Script速
there?
MR. STOEVER: Same objections.
A. Because the research that I do, as you well
know, is based on what is in the public domain that
the average person would have had access to, and my
reading or not reading the Kluger book about internal
documents of the tobacco companies would not enhance
my knowledge about general awareness, public
awareness, common knowledge that existed back in the
'40s, '50s, and '60s.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) No, I understand that it
wouldn't further your assignment from Shook-Hardy and
the role that you play in this case. I'm just saying,
for curiosity's sake, you've never felt the desire to
just read that book, considering you're so intimately
familiar with very, very closely related issues?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form, and
it's outside the scope of this witness's expertise.
A. No, I haven't.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) But you bought it.
A. I read a lot of books. I read this one
because, as you well know, it received a very
prominent review in the New York Review of Books, so I
did buy it on the basis of that review and then, as I
say, I looked at it or skimmed through it, but it

contained nothing about the cultural or social history
of cigarettes or the cigarette industry, so it wasn't
useful for my purposes.
Q. When was that book written?
A. The review I read was in 1996. I think it
came out either in '94 or '95, I think. It may have
come out in '96, but I know the review I read of it
was in '96.
Q. I'm looking at your reliance list that was
sent to me in this case. Do you know one way or
another whether or not Dominick Tullo saw any one
specific document in your entire reliance materials?
A. I know that he -- that given the testimony
in the depositions, that he read newspapers very
carefully, and I know specifically what newspapers he
read, so the answer would be yes, in terms of the
newspapers that he did read every day.
Q. Right. I understand that. I'm asking
about a specific article that's on your reliance
list. I mean, I know the papers that he read also.
I'm asking for specifics.
Can you point to any one specific article
or a comment or editorial, movie, television
commercial, public health note, you know, anything
that's on your entire reliance list that we know for

certain Mr. Tullo saw in his lifetime?
A. No.
Q. Do you have any specific opinion as to what A. Mine is on 33; and then it reads -- As in
all depositions, it's somewhat disjointed. She jumps
to another subject, but it's there on 33 about the
children.
Q. And so you're telling me that in 1949
Dominick Tullo understood that smoking cigarettes
causes lung cancer and COPD?
A. That's not what you asked me to begin
1
2
3
Mr. Tullo's actual awareness was at any point in time 4
regarding whether or not smoking cigarettes causes
5
lung cancer or COPD?
6
A. Well, I think I do from the depositions.
7
Q. Okay. What is your specific opinion as to 8
what Mr. Tullo knew?
9
A. Again, if you look at all of the
10
depositions, but particularly the ones given by his
11
wife, she began to tell him about the dangers of
12
smoking beginning with, and as she puts it, nagging 13
him, ultimately pleading with him about the dangers of 14
smoking with the birth of their first child in 1949,
15
and then she simply continues to do this at an
16
enhanced rate after she reads or hears about the 1964 17
Surgeon General report.
18
So there's a bulk of evidence in her
19
deposition, alone, about how many times and how 20
constantly she nagged him, she pleaded with him and 21
tried to convince him about the dangers of cigarette 22
smoking.
23
Q. And where in her deposition, exactly, does 24
it say that in 1949 she tried to get him to stop
25
with. You asked me about my knowledge of his general
awareness; and through his wife, I think he was
generally aware.
Q. Okay. I think my question was, and if it
wasn't, it doesn't matter because I'll ask it now, but
I think it was specific to lung cancer and COPD. When
did Dominick Tullo become aware that smoking
cigarettes causes lung cancer and COPD?
A. I can't specifically answer that.
Q. And when did Dominick Tullo become aware
that smoking cigarettes was addictive?
A. I don't know. He never said he was
addicted, according to the depositions.
Q. Okay. That doesn't answer my question at
all, but okay.
Do you have any opinion as to when Dominick
Tullo became aware that smoking cigarettes were

because she was concerned about his health?
A. I didn't say that she did that. I said
beginning in 1949, she says that she increased her
nagging when the children were born, and the first
child was born in 1949 and -- Do you want a page
reference for that?
Q. Well, yes, but my question is, where does
it say that that was done out of a concern for one's
health?
A. On page 33 she made him aware of the health
risks, she showed him the warnings.
Q. Well, there were no warnings in 1949,
right?
A. Not in '49 but her testimony is a little
disjointed because of the question, but she says that
she made him aware of the health risks beginning with
the birth of her first child.
Q. Where does it say that she made him aware
of the health risks beginning with her first child?
A. Well, we could look at the deposition, but
I have that she increased the nagging about the health
risks when her children were born. Do you want to
check that?
Q. What's the page and line you have? I'll
check it on a break.

addictive?

according to the depositions, that he ever was
addicted. When he became aware of it, I don't know.
Q. I'm not asking you when he became aware
that he was addicted or if he thought he was addicted
or anything of that sort. I'm asking you when
Dominick Tullo became aware that smoking cigarettes
were addictive.
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
Q. (continuing) If you know.
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form, asked
and answered.
A. Yeah, I can't say anything more than what
I've said.

again.
Dr. Hoff, you have no opinion as to when
Dominick Tullo became aware that smoking cigarettes
were addictive, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Asked and answered.
A. That's correct.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Thank you.
What diseases did Dominick Tullo suffer
from as a result of smoking cigarettes?

A. Well, primarily it was ultimately lung
cancer.
Q. What else other than the primary lung
cancer?
A. I think that he had problems with his legs,
perhaps with arthritis, with other issues, but the
main connection with respect to this suit and the use
of cigarettes is lung cancer. there, any person in the United States reading that
could have been aware of it and increasingly aware of
it as these reports kept coming out.
Q. Dr. Hoff, what are your opinions in this
case?
A. My opinions are, and again, I always tailor
these opinions to the depositions in each particular
case, was that by -- as you look at the entire 20th
century, but just looking at, let's say for example,
the educational system in the state of New York, and
looking at public and -- or national and local and
regional newspaper, looking at reform activity that
took place in the first part of the 20th century and
then later on in the last half of the 20th century and
tailoring that to the areas where the Tullo family
lived, my opinions are that there was readily
available and reliable information out there for the
general public to make them aware of the dangers of
smoking, hazards of smoking and the difficulty one had
if one started to smoke.
And while my research, then, is general up
to a point, as I've already indicated, there's an
explosion of this type of information available
beginning in the 1950s because of the scientific
studies.

Q. Are you aware whether or not Dominick Tullo 9
ever had COPD?
10
A. No, I'm not. I, of course, don't look at
11
medical records, but it doesn't come out in the
12
depositions at all.
13
Q. Did you read the responses to
14
interrogatories?
15
A. Yes, I did.
16
Q. Do you have any opinions in this case about 17
the public awareness of COPD?
18
A. I don't, because the acronym C-O-P-D really 19
refers, as a layperson in my mind and as I read these 20
public accounts, refers to an enhanced form of
21
emphysema, which we have references to long before you 22
have a specific reference to COPD.
23
Q. That'S fine. I appreciate that. That's
24
correct.
25
When I say "COPD," I'm referring to COPD,
emphysema, chronic lung disease, those types of
acronyms.
So do you have any opinions that you're
going to offer in this case as to when the public
became aware that smoking cigarettes causes emphysema,
COPD, chronic lung disease?
A. The awareness begins with the publication
of the scientific reports and their entrance into the
public domain in the -- Beginning in the early 1950s
you have mention of lung problems from the very
beginning.
Q. Not just lung problems. I'm talking about
specific diseases like emphysema, chronic obstructive
lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary condition
or disease.
A. Maybe not the chronic references that
you've just used, but we do have references by the
middle of the 1950s to emphysema.
Q. So is it your opinion by the middle of the
1950s there was general public awareness that smoking
cigarettes causes emphysema?
A. It's my opinion that there were references
to emphysema in the public accounts of these
scientific reports. So to the degree that it was out

So my opinion is that based on the variety
of sources I've used, the educational material, the
scientific reports, the government reports, the
popular culture evidence for the hazards of smoking
and its addictive nature, from all of those sources I
came to the conclusion that there was this information
available and there was considerable general awareness
out there by 1950, which only increased from 1950 on.
Q. So by 1950 there was general public
awareness that smoking cigarettes causes diseases and
is hard to quit; is that what you're saying?
A. Yes.
Q. Now by 1950 was there general public
awareness that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer?
A. Not -- The studies that come out beginning
in the late '40s and '50s begin to mention lung
cancer. So the awareness is not that specific by,
say, 1950, but it becomes more and more specific in
the course of that decade and just continues from that
point forward.
Q. When you say "studies," you're referring to
medical studies, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Articles that appeared in medical
literature, correct?

A. No, I referred only to the studies which
were reported in the national press or on TV beginning
in the '50s.
Q. So at what point in time in the United
States did it become general public knowledge that
smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer?
A. It's hard to pinpoint a specific year, but
I would say by the time you have the 1957 expert
report being issued by the government, by the public
health service, that the -- there's every indication
that there's been considerable information out there
to the public.
And, in fact, the Surgeon General in that
year indicated that he thought the press had done a
great job in informing the public about the health
hazards of smoking, specifically its connection to
lung cancer.
So if you're looking for a general
awareness that was at least stated by the Surgeon
General at the time, it would be around 1957.
Q. And Dominick Tullo had been smoking for how
many years?
A. Well, he would have started, what did we
say, back in 1935?
Q. Right. So 22 years?

Statement come out?
A. It came out in January of 1954.
Q. And do you know how that Frank Statement
came to be drafted and published?
A. Not so much how it came to be drafted. I
do know that it was in response to the extensive
publicity given to the mouse study that had been
issued in November and December of 1953. It was a
direct response to a specific scientific study
involving mice.
Q. So who authored the Frank Statement?
A. There were, I think, 13 or 14 tobacco
companies.
Q. You don't know how they came to, you know,
write that statement?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form;
outside the scope of this witness's expertise.
A. No, I don't know how they came to. I've
seen accounts in newspaper, particularly, indicating
that they obviously had to meet to put this report
together or put the ad together, which is, in essence,
what it was, but I don't know any of the details of
that.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Do you know where they
met?

A. Uh-huh. That was a yes.
Q. Yeah, you've got to answer out loud.
Sorry.
Even after '57, President Kennedy felt the A. I'm assuming they met in New York. I'm not
sure.
Q. And why do you assume that?
A. Because the -- I don't know why I'm
assuming that. I could say because I think the
advertising firm they were using was based in New
York, some of the tobacco companies had their
headquarters in New York. I don't know. I think it
was New York.
Q. What advertising firm are you referring to?
A. It would have been Hill & Knowlton.
Q. How long did Hill & Knowlton work for the
tobacco industry?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form;
outside the scope of this witness's expertise.
A. It is outside my expertise, but they worked
for them from 1953 to l968.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) What exactly is your
1
2
3
4
need to commission the Surgeon General's report and to 5
work that up, correct?
6
A. Yes.
7
Q. So how come he felt that need even though, 8
according to you, the public was just generally aware
9
of that?
10
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; calls 11
for speculation.
12
A. Again, if you look at that '57 report and
13
congressional hearings following that report, the
14
government officials indicate that they want to
15
continue to do this type of research to make sure that 16
they are collecting even better evidence than they
17
already had by 1957.
18
So Kennedy's appointment of this committee 19
was not really an indication that general awareness 20
wasn't out there. It was simply an indication that
21
the government was getting more and more involved in 22
the subject of supporting this kind of scientific
23
research.
24
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Okay. When did the Frank 25
expertise, because now I'm lost? Hill & Knowlton is a
public relations firm and you're here to talk about
public awareness. So what do you understand your area
of expertise to be in these cases?
MR. STOEVER: Do you mean other than
what's set forth in her expert disclosure, Jon?
MR. GDANSKI: No, I'm just asking her

the question. I mean, I guess now she's going to look
at her expert disclosure, of course.
A. No. My expertise is what I previously
indicated to you. I look at a variety of sources in
order to determine what the public would have been
aware of on any given topic. This topic happens to be
cigarette smoking, but I've done that for other topics
in my own private research and professional life.
That's what I do, for the most part.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) In what other areas or
topics or subject matters have you discussed or
researched the public's awareness or perception or
understanding of a certain health-related matter?
A. I haven't on a health-related matter unless
you would consider mental health one of my research
fields, because I had to research -- I did research on
an Irish peasant family where I had to try to
determine what the public perception of this family
was since a murder had occurred and the family had
participated in the murder.
And so the newspaper accounts and the
depositions in that particular case indicated that
there were mental health problems with the family
because the family still believed in fairies, so take
it from there. So I have done mental health but

MR. STOEVER: Jon, are we at a good
place to take a five-minute break?
MR. GDANSKI: Yeah, sure, I have to use
the restroom so I'm happy you asked. Let's do it.
MR. STOEVER: Thanks.
(A recess was taken.)
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) You mentioned
congressional hearings relative to the 1957 report,
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. What were those congressional hearings?
A. Well, the major one had to do with the
question of how effective filtered cigarettes were.
Q. And what was the conclusion of the report
or the commission?
A. Some of the members of the house committee
were convinced, even before the hearings, that the
advertising concerning filtered cigarettes was false
and misleading. So the title of the hearing was
"False and Misleading Advertising," but the hearing
itself was conducted in a fairly even-handed manner
and included, then, scientists who had done --
participated in the '57 study. It included the
Surgeon General and the head of the Public Health
Min-U-Script速
Service, and it included representatives, by that
time, of the tobacco industry's TIRC group.
Q. And what was the conclusion of the meeting
regarding the tobacco companies' advertising of
filtered cigarettes?
A. There wasn't a conclusion on the
advertising itself. The committee was trying to
determine the degree to which the advertising about
the filters was perhaps misleading; and ultimately in
1959, the government intercedes and indicates to the
tobacco companies they can no longer display or
advertise the tar and nicotine levels in their
cigarettes based on the filters.
Q. And when did Dominick Tullo begin to smoke
a filtered cigarette?
A. It's not completely clear from the
depositions. It appears that his wife and others
think he began to smoke filters with Parliament
cigarettes.
Q. And Kent cigarettes, is there any
recollection or mention that he smoked Kent
cigarettes?
A. There is; and, again, Mary Tullo didn't
even recall that he smoked Kents, but her two children
testified and reminded her, actually, that he had

Q. And Kent was the first filtered cigarette;
are you aware of that?
A. I'm not absolutely sure --
Q. I could be wrong about that.
A. -- of that. It was one of the early ones,
yes.
Q. Yeah. It was marketed early on as a
filtered cigarette, correct?
A. Uh-huh. Yes. Yes.
Q. And are you familiar with the Kent
advertisements where they portrayed the filtered
mechanism of their cigarette?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
MR. BIDEAU: Object to form.
A. I've seen some of them.
MR. GDANSKI: Just because I heard two
objections, I'm fine if you guys want to do one
objection, one for all, if it's easier for you.
MR. STOEVER: That's fine for Philip
Morris. Mark, and others on the phone, is that okay?
MR. BIDEAU: Yeah, that's acceptable.
I hadn't heard the objection so that's why I jumped
in. I was assuming that one objection would cover all
of us.

13
you're familiar with the Kent filtered advertisements, 14
correct?
15
A. I've seen some of them, yes.
16
Q. And what's the earliest that you can recall 17
Kent advertising for a filtered cigarette?
18
A. I can't because I don't study ads, but I've
19
seen them as I've gone through the newspaper research. 20
Q. Well, you study the information that's
21
available in newspapers, correct?
22
A. Yes.
23
Q. Magazines, correct?
24
A. Yes.
25
advertisements in your reliance materials, correct?
A. To the degree they showed up as I was
looking for these particular articles, yes.
Q. I'm sorry. To the degree they showed up as
you were looking for what particular articles?
A. As I was looking for the topics on tobacco,
on cigarettes, on health hazards, on specific
diseases, on the habit-forming nature, as I was
looking for those topics, obviously, as you would look
through a newspaper back in the '50s when these ads
were part of the text of newspapers and as I look
through magazines where you would see ads for a
variety of products.
Q. Okay. And in the '30s and '40s and '50s as
well, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) You mentioned just the
'50s. There were cigarette advertisements in

Q. And so I would assume, then, that those
tobacco advertisements are equally a part of the
1

5
materials that you review and rely upon just like any 6
newspaper article, correct?
7
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; it's
8
outside the scope of her expert disclosure.
9
A. My problem with the question is your use of 10
the term "equally," but I don't study ads per se, and 11
I don't consider ads an equal form of information on 12
the question of the health hazards of smoking or the 13
addictive nature of cigarettes.
14
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Are they a superior form 15
of information?
16
A. No.
17
MR. STOEVER: Object to form; outside 18
the scope.
19
A. (continuing) They're just a piece of a
20
fragment of all the information out there.
21
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Okay. I just want to be 22
clear of the scope of your testimony.
23
You've included ads in the materials you 24
provided to my office upon which you rely, correct? 25
Page 48
periodicals in the '30s and '40s as well, correct?
A. Yeah, there was advertising, yes.
Q. And so you would include those ads -- you
did include those ads as you came across them,
correct?
A. Yes, if they were included on the pages
with the text.
Q. So you would only include an ad if it was
on a page on which there was also an article which you
found relevant?
A. That's generally correct, yes. I didn't go
through the magazines or the newspapers looking for
ads.
Q. Right, but you went through the entire --
Let's say you had a 1953 Life magazine from December,
all right?
A. Yeah.
Q. And you would look through the entire
magazine, correct?
A. No, for that November 1953, I would look
specifically at the two or three pages they devoted to
the mouse study.
Q. But how would you know which two or three
pages? You'd have to look through the whole thing to
get to the mouse study.

7
Q. Only if on the exact same page as the

article you find to be relevant do you include the 9
advertisement, correct?
10
A. Yes.
11
Q. And so you include tobacco advertisements 12
to the same extent that you would include
13
advertisements for Coca-Cola, correct?
14
A. Yes.
15
Q. If it happens to appear on a page you
16
decide to be relevant, then it's there. But if it's

not there, it's not there, right?

19
yes.
20
Q. And ads appeared in public literature,
21
public magazines, public newspapers, correct?
22
A. Yes.
23
Q. They were equally accessible to Dominick 24

Page 52
wide-advertised product; would you agree?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form;
outside the scope of the expertise.
A. They were widely advertised but there were
publications which didn't carry cigarette ads.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) And your job in this case
is to discuss the public's awareness of the health
message, the health effects of smoking cigarettes,
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you're aware that at a certain point in
time, tobacco companies were banned from advertising
using messages that gave off a health message, you
know, they're not that bad for you or they won't
irritate your throat, that kind of stuff. You're
aware of that, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And so before they were banned from
doing that, the tobacco companies were using their
advertisements as a vehicle to portray a
health-related message, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form;
outside the scope of expertise.
A. Actually, it's not correct. They only --
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Okay. Tell me why not.

so-called cancer scare of the first half of the 1950s,
and they were forbidden to do that as of 1955, and
they didn't do it before the scientific studies began
to come out in the early 1950s.
So if you're talking about that very small
time period, then yes, I guess, is the answer to your
question.
Q. And you're familiar with the "More Doctors
Smoke Camels" ads, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You've come across those in your research,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you believe that there's any health
message that's relayed in those ads?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form;
outside the scope of the witness's expertise.
A. Yeah, I can't interpret the ad as someone
who knows advertising. I have, as you well know,
previously said that I thought that by using doctors,
in particular, it might cross someone's mind that you would be wasting your money to have me do it
again.

witness, Dr. Hoff. I need -- We might need new people
to take a look at the information. Would you do it
for us?
MR. STOEVER: We'll tell Dr. Burns you
said so.
A. I do general awareness, and your internal
documents aren't going to help me with that.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) No, no, no. I think
you're misunderstanding my question, and I'm not being
facetious. I know that, you know, it would create
tremendous problems for you in the context of
continuing to work for the tobacco companies, but in
all seriousness, if that was an assignment that we
were interested in having you do, it wouldn't be the
same as general awareness. It would be to look at the
question of how the tobacco companies' internal
documents relate --
(Question interrupted by reporter.)
MR. GDANSKI: I'll back up.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) You know, I am being
serious, Dr. Hoff. If my firm, the Plaintiff's firm,
asked you to take a look at the question of how do the
Page 54 Page 56

correspond with the information and the message based

than any other brand?
3
A. I have no idea.
4
Q. I mean, they can't just make that up.
5
A. Yeah, I have no idea.
6
Q. Dr. Hoff, if I asked you to work for my
7
firm as a witness and to take a look at the internal 8
documents and see how that related to the tobacco 9
companies' public position, which you're very well 10
aware of, would you do that?
11
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; calls 12
for speculation.
13
A. Ask me the question again. If you ask me
14
to do what?
15
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Sure. If my firm was
16
interested in hiring you as an expert witness to take 17
a look at the tobacco companies' internal documents to 18
see how they match up with the tobacco companies' 19
public position, which you are already aware of, would 20
you do that for my firm? We'd pay you for your time. 21
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; calls 22
for speculation.
23
A. I would think, and I'm only saying this
24
somewhat facetiously, that it's already been done and 25
came to make the claim that more doctors smoke a Camel
on the tobacco company's public position in the '50s,
'60s, '70s and '80s, which you're already aware of,
would you do that?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; calls
for speculation.
A. And I'm assuming you're saying their public
position would include the ads; is that correct?
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) No, no. The public
position you already, you know, read about of what
they told -- No new research on the public question.
You've done that already.
MR. STOEVER: Same objections.
A. You'd be asking me to do a kind of research
that I'm really not an expert in. I don't do -- We
train students to do company histories, and that's
what you're asking in part. I haven't done company
histories. I'd have to go back and really train
myself to do that kind of research.
So you'd be, again, asking me to do
research that I've had no background in doing
previously.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Well, what type of
additional training would you need to do the kind of

research assignment I'm describing?
A. We call that public history, and beginning
in the 1970s, public history became a major subfield
of the field of U.S. History. Primarily because of
the glut on the market of traditional historians who Q. Have you read that book?
A. No.
Q. So how do you know that it does that?
A. Like I know what the Kluger book says, from
reviews.
Q. You bought a copy of Ashes to Ashes, right?
A. Yes.
Q. You've skimmed through it, right?
A. Yes.
Q. At the least, okay. So what other books do

would normally teach, and there weren't teaching jobs, 6
we began to train our students to do history of
7
companies, history of museums, history of all kinds of 8
public and private institutions for employment
9
purposes.
10
But it does take a specific type of
11
information and knowledge to do that kind of
12
research. It's not normally what traditional
13
historians did until the 1970s.
14
Q. When you say "history of companies," you 15
mean the history of like the company's founding, 16
boards, the executive committees, the presidents; 17
that's what you're referring to, right?
18
A. Yes. Very often companies want to hire a
19
trained historian, a Ph.D. in history, to put out an
20
authentic, legitimate history of their company.
21
Q. But I'm asking something a little bit
22
different. You've analyzed the question of what the 23
public knew regarding the health hazards of smoking 24

period of time, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And I would simply want to ask you to do
the same thing with regard to what the tobacco

companies knew, so not a history of the Philip Morris 5
corporate structure, I don't care about that. I'm 6
saying, you know, the question of what they knew and
7
when they knew it. Would you do it?
8
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; calls 9
for speculation.
10
A. I've already answered that. It's already
11
been done.
12
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Who has done that?
13
A. Any of the books that have come out since
14
the last half of the 1990s, a number of these books 15
have looked at these internal documents and have then 16
tried to correlate them, to one degree or another,
17
with the public statements of the tobacco companies. 18
Q. What books are you familiar with that have 19
done that?
20
A. Well, the one we've been talking about,
21
which is Ashes to Ashes.
22
Q. Okay. Anything else?
23
A. I think Philip Hilts' book, Smokescreen,
24
does that.
25

that? You mentioned the Smokescreen. Who is that by?
A. That's Philip Hilts.
Q. And do you own a copy of that?
A. No.
Q. What other books tackle that subject matter
from hearing the public message to the internal
message?
A. Oh, let's see. I think Allan Brandt's book
does.
Q. What book is that?
A. It's called Cigarette Century, I think.
Q. And have you read that book?
A. No.
Q. Do you own a copy?
A. No.
Page 60
Q. Do you know Dr. Brandt?
A. No, I don't.
Q. Have you ever read any of his work?
A. I haven't, um -- No, I haven't read any of
his work.
Q. Are you interested in this subject matter
of the public's awareness of the dangers associated
with smoking cigarettes or do you do it strictly
because it's a paid job?
A. Well, I'm interested in the sense that as
I've done other social and cultural history research,
this is a topic that falls well within that type of
methodology.
Q. Your interest has never risen to the level
where you would read Allan Brandt's book, The
Cigarette Century?
MR. STOEVER: Object to form.
A. No, it doesn't rise to that level. You
have to realize that I don't do this type of research
basically for a living. I do all other kinds of
topics as a professional historian, and so there would
be no need for me to read these secondary accounts
when they don't deal with public awareness based on
information out in the mass media.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Would you agree that to

some extent in the 1950s, there was a mixed message in
the public arena as to the public health hazards of
smoking?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. In the 1950s there was disagreement
initially among scientists and even within some of the
national health organizations about the exact or
precise connection between cigarette smoking and lung
cancer.
So if that's a mixed message, I guess
that -- my answer to your question would be yes.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) And would you also agree
that in the 1960s there was, to some extent, a mixed
message in the public arena as to the health hazards
of smoking? Some people were saying it clearly does
cause lung cancer and some people, to some extent,
were saying it's not yet proven?
A. Not to the same degree that you had this
internal debate among scientists in the 1950s. By the
1964 Surgeon General report, that report itself said
that it was unreasonable not to go along with the
statistical evidence showing a connection between lung
cancer and smoking.
Q. But some people, even after the '60s
forward, still didn't go along with that evidence,

said "to some extent."
A. No, you --
Q. I said "to some extent."
A. -- said on one hand and on the other; and
to my mind, that's not equal.
Q. I'm not making a qualitative sort of
analysis of to what extent they were out there, but to
some extent there was a dual message in the public,
correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. I think I've answered that. The dual
message was not an equal dual message, especially
after the '64 report.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) My question -- I think
you have answered it. I think you said yes. I just
am not hearing it from you.
There was a dual message out there in the
1960s as to the health hazards of smoking, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. I am answering it in this qualified way. A
dual message, to my way of thinking, means that you
have an equal message on both sides, and I simply
don't believe that my research shows that's true.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Okay. Now I'll ask it
differently. Was there a position taken publicly that

correct?
A. You'll have to be a little more specific
about what you mean by "some people."
Q. Sure. All of the parties that you're
testifying on behalf of today, they didn't go along
with that evidence, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. Again, you're asking me a very general
question.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Really?
A. Are you asking me, are there specific
references in articles about the '64 report or about
other studies that come out later in the '60s and
'70s? On occasion you're going to see a tobacco
company's position presented, yes.
Q. Okay. The question, though, is the
following. In the '60s, there was, to some extent, a
dual message in the public. One message was that it
causes diseases, smoking cigarettes causes diseases.
The other message was that it's not yet proven that
smoking cigarettes causes disease, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. No. In the public domain that was not an
equal argument as you're implying.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) I'm not implying that. I

was portrayed in the newspapers, periodicals and
television media in the '60s that smoking cigarettes
causes lung cancer?
A. Ask the first part of the question again.
I lost it.
Q. Sure. Was there a message that was given
out to the American public in the '60s that smoking
cigarettes causes lung cancer?
A. Yes.
Q. And was there also a message in the 1960s
that was given out to the American public that it's
not yet proven that smoking cigarettes causes lung
cancer?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. To a much lesser degree, as I've previously
said.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) But it was out there,
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And in the 1970s was there still a message
that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer and COPD?
A. It references the COPD by the 1970s, but
again, the abundance of evidence coming out of the
scientific community and the government and health
organizations are all increasingly reinforcing public

cancer and COPD, correct?

MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.

the other side by the 1970s.

A. Yes.
Q. Who is C.C. Little?
A. He headed the TIRC initially after it was
formed.
Q. Would he go on television and tell smokers
that there's no connection between smoking and lung
cancer?
A. He went on television periodically,
especially after the -- well, after the mouse study;
and then after the '57 and '64 reports he was
interviewed.
Q. What would he say about the connection
between smoking cigarettes and diseases that kill
people?
A. Normally he would say what was in the print
media, that the proof was inconclusive and more
studies had to take place.
Q. Who is Ann Browder?
A. I'm not really completely -- She was a
spokesperson at some point for the tobacco industry.
Min-U-Script速
Q. Okay. When?
A. I think it was later in the '80s, but I'm
not sure.
Q. She was a spokesperson in television or in
news media -- newspapers? Sorry.
A. My impression is that it was on television.
Q. Did you include any of the television
interviews she gave in the materials that you relied
upon in this case?
A. Did I include any of her television
interviews?
Q. That's right.
A. No.
Q. Why not?
A. Primarily because they -- I'm speculating
here to a certain degree -- I thought that she only
appeared sporadically and that there wasn't any
consistent public presence for her. I might be
mistaken in that, but I don't think she had a national
kind of image as a spokesperson for the tobacco
industry.
Q. Have you ever seen any of her interviews?
A. I think I've seen clips but I have no
specific memory of them right now.
Q. Do you know, sitting here today, if Philip

lung cancer?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form. It's
outside the scope of her expertise.
A. I haven't researched it for any case but I
do know that as of the late 1990s I guess it is, most
of the tobacco companies made some kind of statement
with respect to the problems with cigarette smoking.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) And how about the
addictive nature of cigarette smoking; do you know if,
sitting here today, Philip Morris agrees or disagrees
that nicotine is addictive?
MR. STOEVER: Same objections.
A. No, I don't.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) They very well may
maintain that it's not addictive as far as you know;
is that right?
A. They could or they could not, that's true.
Q. Do you believe that the Surgeon General of
the United States is an authoritative source of
information when it comes to smoking and health?
A. I think the Surgeon General's reports tend
to be accepted from '64 on as the position of the
government, yes.
Q. And they're generally relied upon when it

would simply make for a smoother smoke, a less harsh
smoke.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Do you know who Timothy
Hartnett is?
A. He was associated, I think, with either the
TIRC or one of the research committees.
Q. Do you know if he would go on television
and give forth the position of the tobacco companies
on smoking and health matters?
A. I remember him quoted in newspapers. I
don't remember him as much on television.

was the role of the TIRC?

the Frank Statement that you brought up earlier.

the Frank Statement in your reliance materials?
A. Yes, to the degree that it appears in the
newspapers for any particular case.

A. It was again a -- primarily a -- according
to the newspaper articles, it was primarily a PR firm,
as I recall, that was established in 1958.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) It was a PR firm that
represented the joint interests of the tobacco
companies that founded it, correct?
A. It was usually identified as representing
the tobacco industry, yes.
Q. And it was a public relations firm, right?
A. As far as I could tell from the newspaper
articles.
Q. And that public relations firm would speak
to the public on behalf of the tobacco companies,
correct?
A. Yes.

had any television commercials for the tobacco

of their public message, Dr. Hoff. Come on, you know

what I'm talking about.

but it's speculation on my part to any degree -- to
9
what degree they may have, and there's no --
10
Q. They may have relied upon --
11
A. Well, there's no evidence in the Tullo
12
depositions that he relied on anything coming from the 13
tobacco companies, and that's, I think, specific to
14
this case.
15
Q. Some smokers in the public may have relied 16
upon the tobacco companies' position that nothing is 17
wrong with cigarettes, but if there is anything wrong, 18
filters will take them out or make it a smoother 19
smoke, right?
20
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; calls 21
for speculation, outside the scope of this witness's
22
expertise.
23
A. Well, we've talked about that already, that
24
it's possible. But, again, the whole question of
25
Min-U-Script速
Page 75
filters is out of the public domain by 1959 because of
government intervention.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) And you know that
Dominick Tullo smoked filtered cigarettes starting in
the '50s, right?
A. I don't know specifically when he started.
It wasn't clear from the depositions, but he did start
to smoke them at some point.
Q. Okay. And it's possible that, to some
extent, the tobacco companies' position that filtered
cigarettes will remove whatever is harmful and make it
a smoother smoke could have had some kind of effect on
Dominick Tullo, right?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; calls
for speculation.
A. My reading of the depositions would, I
think, allow me to say no to that because there were
no ads discussed with him or his family. That comes
through very loud and clear. He never was influenced
by advertising, according to members of his family.
So in terms of this particular case, the
answer would have to be no, in terms of Dominick
Tullo.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) I'm not saying anything
about ads, but the tobacco companies', separate and
Page 76
apart from advertisements, put advertisements aside
for a second, in the public press they took the
position that filtered cigarettes will remove anything
that's harmful and make it a smoother smoke, right?
We've said that already?
A. Yes.
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form;
mischaracterizes her testimony.
You need to slow down so that I get my
objection in, okay?
THE WITNESS: Okay.
MR. GDANSKI: I'm not sure how it's
mischaracterized when she just said "yes."
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) That aside; now, is it
possible that Dominick Tullo was impacted, not by the
ads, but by the tobacco companies' public message that
smoking cigarettes with filters will remove whatever
is bad or make it a smoother smoke?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; calls
for speculation, asked and answered.
A. It's possible but there's no evidence of it
in the deposition.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) And we know that Dominick
Tullo told his wife, "Don't worry. I'm smoking
filtered cigarettes," right?

was being put out by the tobacco companies, basically
a "Don't worry. Filters will take care of whatever is
harmful and make it a smoother smoke," right?

asked why he said that, and she doesn't know and none
of the relatives seem to know.

cases have you been listed as a witness for the
tobacco companies?
A. I think as of right now it's, oh, five or
six.
Q. And what are the names of those cases?
A. I really don't have the names of the ones

Q. The recent round of Florida tobacco
litigation, right?
A. Right.
Q. In how many of those cases have you
actually done some measure of work?
A. I think, let's see, Barbanell and Putney
and Gafney, this case, and Campbell.
Q. And what about Tate?
A. Oh, yes, I did do work on Tate.
Q. You did not or you did?
A. I did.
Q. In Campbell, did you testify in a
deposition?
A. I've done very little. I've read one
deposition in Campbell.
Q. Do you know if Campbell has already been
tried or --
A. No, it hasn't.
Q. Okay. And in Tate, did you testify in a
deposition in that case?
A. Yes, I gave a deposition.
Q. And do you know if that case has been
tried?
A. I think it has. I didn't testify in it.
Q. Do you know why you were not called to

where I've just been listed.
Q. When you say "just been listed," do you
mean listed but not deposed --
A. Yes, or --
Q. -- or listed and deposed?
A. Or where I have done no research.
MR. STOEVER: You need to let
Mr. Gdansky finish his question before you answer,
okay?
THE WITNESS: Yes.
MR. STOEVER: Otherwise the court
reporter is going to jump up and start screaming.
MR. GDANSKI: That's why I didn't come
to Montana.
MR. STOEVER: To avoid the court
reporter's wrath (laughter)?
MR. GDANSKI: That's usually the best
reason. I talk really fast.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Okay. Let's back up.
In how many cases have you actively done
some level of work?
A. Currently or forever in the past?
Q. Let me ask this. You know what I mean when
I say Engle-progeny cases, correct?
A. Yes.

testify in that case?
A. No.
Q. Did you ever ask whoever your contact
person is at Shook-Hardy, "Why didn't you call me in
this case whereas you've called me in the other
cases"?
A. No, because I haven't been called in all
cases where I've given depositions.
Q. Other than Tate, in how many cases have you
been deposed and then the case has actually gone to
trial and you've not been called?
MR. STOEVER: We're focusing just on
Engle-progeny cases now, Jonathan?
MR. GDANSKI: Yeah.
A. I guess it would only be in Tate. Well, I
haven't been called in this case.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) It hasn't gone to trial
yet though.
A. Yeah. So I guess in terms of the Engle
cases it would only be in Tate, yes.
Q. And in non-Engle tobacco cases how many
times have you been deposed and the case has gone to
trial and you were never called?
A. I really can't say because those cases
would have occurred between 1996 and 2001.

Q. And so you never asked whoever it is you
deal with at Shook-Hardy, "How come you guys didn't
call me in Tate?" just out of curiosity?
A. No. Some go to trial and some don't, as
far as I'm concerned.
Q. Right. Well, this one went to trial, Tate,
and you weren't called.
A. No, I didn't bother to ask.
Q. And how about in Gafney; has that case been
tried yet?
A. No.
Q. Do you know when that case is going to be
tried?
A. No, I don't.
Q. Do you have any expectation of being called
to testify in that trial?
A. I do, yes.
Q. Have you been told when that trial is
expected to take place?
A. No, I haven't specifically. These trial
dates seem to come and go.
Q. And other than Barbanell and Putney, you
haven't testified in any tobacco Engle-progeny trials,
correct?
A. That's correct.

filter?
A. I think it was also sometime in the '50s.
Q. So a small window of time they used that
filtration mechanism, right?
A. I don't know exactly but I know they
discontinued it after a while.
Q. And they advertised the Micronite filter,
right?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form. It's
outside the scope of the witness's expertise.
A. Yes, they did.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) And in your research, you
came across advertisements for the Kent Micronite
filter, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And some of those advertisements are
included on your reliance list to the extent that they
appeared on pages in which articles you found relevant
appeared, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And there is some testimony that Dominick
Tullo smoked Kent cigarettes around the exact same
time that Kent used the Micronite filter, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
MR. BIDEAU: Object to the form.

Q. Now, let's put those six cases aside for a
moment. In how many cases have you been listed other
than those six?
A. As I said, I think it may be four or five
others.
Q. And you don't recall the names of any of
those cases?
A. No, not offhand.
Q. The listing process, the process by which
you're listed as a witness, are you first contacted by
Shook-Hardy lawyers and discuss sort of the facts of
the case or are you just listed?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. Normally I think -- Occasionally I'm given
some facts of the case, but normally I think I'm just
listed for future reference on the case.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Who is the principle
contact person you deal with at Shook-Hardy?
A. In terms of forwarding any of my research,
it's basically Vickie Thompson, but then I deal with
individual attorneys for individual cases.
Q. Do you know when Kent cigarettes used the
Kent Micronite filter?
A. Sometime in the '50s.
Q. Do you know when they ceased using that

A. It's unclear from the deposition when he
actually smoked Kents, so I can't say.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Do you recall what period
of time his daughter mentioned that he smoked Kent
cigarettes?
A. Neither the daughter, Stephanie, nor the
son, Louis, were specific about the time. They simply
informed their mother that he had smoked them. She
didn't seem to recall, the mother didn't recall that
he had smoked them.
Q. How much money have you been paid by
Shook-Hardy for the work you've performed on their
behalf?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. For what time period? For this case?
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) The whole entire time
period you've worked for them.
A. Since 1994?
Q. That's correct.
A. Approximately $245,000.
Q. What is your hourly rate?
A. $250 an hour.
Q. How many hours have you spent working on
this case?
A. A little over 30.

Q. How many of those hours were dedicated
towards reading depositions?
A. Oh, in this case a good 18 hours I utilized
reading the depositions.
Q. So what did you do with the 12 other hours?
A. I was doing the research on the newspapers
for the most part.
Q. Which specific newspapers did you research
in those 12 hours?
A. The New York Daily News; the Long Island
paper, Newsday; and finally then, the Florida paper
that Dominick Tullo read, the Palm Beach Post.
Q. And those 12 hours were dedicated --
research dedicated specific to this case or hours that
can be billed across other cases as part of your
general research?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. In this case the time period for the New
York Daily News was specific to this case, though I
had previously done research in the New York Daily
News. The Palm Beach was -- I had done previous
research. So as I mentioned, I went back and did
January '64, and then on Newsday, I looked at the
years between '79 and '86 when he lived on Long
Island.

seen.
Q. Right.
A. It's part of the research that I try to
show how far back in time references to, in this case,
tobacco can go, and how some of the other earlier
sources you see there on the reliance material, just
to show -- give a historical context for the question
of tobacco and how prominent individuals like Columbus
or heads of state or other historical figures would
have reacted to the use of tobacco.
Q. Are you familiar with exactly what message
Dominick Tullo received in his schools, elementary
school and high school?
A. Well, I've done considerable research in
the educational system in the state of New York and in
New York City proper, including the five boroughs, so
he was educated in Brooklyn.
Q. Right, but do you know exactly what
textbooks or what message he received in his
elementary school or high school?
A. I don't know the specific textbooks but I
do know the message because of the textbooks which
were in use during the time in the state and city of
New York during the time he was in school.
Q. But again -- Let me ask it differently

Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) So that's the 12 hours
that you spent in addition to the 18 reading
depositions, right?
A. Yes.
Q. How much money have you been paid in this
case?
A.
Q.
A.
Q.
I haven't been paid anything to date.
How much money have you billed?
I haven't billed anything to date.
And in 1988 when the Surgeon General
concluded that nicotine is addictive, did the tobacco
companies agree or disagree with that determination?
A. In 1988?
Q. Yes.
A. In the stories that were covered, they, on
the specific issue of addiction, they maintained the
same position they had taken earlier, that there
wasn't sufficient evidence for it in the stories where
they were quoted. They weren't quoted in all of the
stories because the addiction issue became the
headline in most of the stories.
Q. Why do you include the Journal of
Christopher Columbus from 1493 on your reliance list?
Surely it could not have been seen by Dominick Tullo.
A. That's correct, it couldn't have been

then. You don't know what textbooks he used, correct?
A. I know the textbooks which were recommended
for the grade levels at the time he was in school.
Q. Do you know what textbook Dominick Tullo
used in seventh grade for his health education class?
A. I don't know the specific text but I do
know which texts were recommended for the sixth and
seventh grades in that time period.
Q. And do you know the specific textbook that
Dominick Tullo used in any one year of his entire
educational period?
A. No.
Q. Do you know, specifically, what any one
public health teacher told him in any one year of his
entire educational period?
A. No, but I do know that the teachers had to
be certified to teach physiology and hygiene in the
New York schools and that they had to pass exams and
that exams on physiology and health were in the
region's tests for all students in the city and state
of New York.
Q. When was smoking banned on airplanes?
A. The discussion of the ban on smoking in
airplanes occurs in the 1980s.
Q. Do you know officially when federal

MR. STOEVER: Object to the form;
10
outside the scope of the witness's expertise.

A. Yeah, I wouldn't know how to answer that.

18
you don't know, just say you don't know.

Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) You're not familiar with 21

your opinion, depict cigarettes as a manly thing to 23
do?

Q. And there is no way he would have seen

A. That's correct.
Q. And there is no way that that message would
have -- a specific message from Florida Health Notes
would have permeated his household, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. Not for that time period. What --
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Okay.
MR. STOEVER: I'm sorry, I don't think
Dr. Hoff was finished with her answer. Were you?
MR. GDANSKI: Yeah, I understand.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Go ahead.
A. (continuing) What those records showed,
and which surprised me when I first did research on
them in Florida, was how far back there was an
interest on the part of health officials in the state
of Florida with respect to the issue of smoking and
health hazards and the addictive nature of smoking.
So if you look at those documents, you see,
then, that the State had been, for some time,
interested in the whole issue that I research. And by
the time the Tullo family moved to Florida, they were
then in a state that had a long history of interest
and advocacy about health issues associated with

Q. What elements of society make up public
awareness?
A. Well, a variety of elements in society make
it up.
Q. Right. You've used, like, a chart in the
past where you point to the different sections, right?
A. Yes. And I mentioned those earlier, I
think.
Q. Okay. What are they again? I don't know
if I got them earlier.
A. Well, you begin, because you're trying to
determine what's available to the general public, you
first look at the educational system where the
plaintiff, as in this case, might have gone to school
or did go to school.
You look at what information is available
through national, local, regional newspapers, print
media.
In the more contemporary periods you look
at television programs. You look at popular culture
as it's reflected in jokes or in movies or in
cartoons.
And then, again, you look at reform groups
which existed in the first part of the 20th century
which were advocating and agitating on the issue of

Dr. Hoff, that Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Lorillard
Tobacco Company, Liggett Tobacco Company had a very
uniform standard message regarding their position on
smoking and health throughout the '60s, '70s and
'80s?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form. It's
outside the scope of this witness's expertise.
A. I didn't study the message in that way, to
the degree I studied comments by representatives of
the tobacco industry, but I didn't look to see how
uniform it was among all the companies.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) You studied what
information was out there in the public arena
regarding smoking and health, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And the message espoused by the tobacco
industry and the representatives in the '60s, '70s,
'80s, and the '50s was out there in the public arena,
correct?
A. Yes, to the degree that I've indicated it
was.
Q. Okay. And it makes up to some degree, to
some extent, part of the public's awareness of the
issue of the health effects of smoking cigarettes,
correct?

the health hazards of smoking.
And then later on in the last half of the
20th century you would look at the national health
organizations -- the American Cancer Society, the lung
and heart associations -- to see what they're doing in
putting out posters and pamphlets and educational
materials. And then in the case of the American
Cancer Society, ultimately you look at the public
service ads that they put out.
So you're looking at the widest possible
variety of sources of information readily available to
the general public.
Q. And you also look at just the general
information out there in the newspapers, right?
A. I think I said that, yes.
Q. I know you've been asked before, but how
come you just don't want to include the message given
to the consumer by the manufacturer of the product?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. Again, the message where? In the stories
that appeared on these studies?
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Anywhere. Anywhere.
Would you agree that Philip Morris --

though, right?
MR. STOEVER: Is there a question?
MR. GDANSKI: Yes.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Dr. Hoff, does it make
up, to some extent, the public's knowledge of the
health hazards of smoking cigarettes?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; calls
for speculation.
A. To some extent, but I don't know what
really you mean or what I mean by "some" in this case.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Okay. You used the term
"reliable sources of information" earlier regarding
the groups of society telling the public that smoking
cigarettes is harmful. Would you agree that the
tobacco companies are a reliable source of
information?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. I don't know what you really mean by
"reliable source of information." The advertising is
a reliable source of information? What's reliable?

advertising. You've seen many newspaper articles that things in there and I don't want to mess it up, maybe
discuss the American Cancer Society's position on let's have it read, if that's possible, please.
A. Okay. Thank you.
(Question found on page 98, lines 14
through 19 read by the reporter.)
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. I don't think I can, not that appeared in,
again, the mass media to any great degree. There
might have been some obscure group that I just didn't
come across, but I don't think it received widespread
publicity if one existed.

by a representative of the Tobacco Institute speaking
4
on behalf of tobacco companies, right?
5
A. Yes.
6
Q. Would you agree that the Tobacco Institute, 7
as the messenger of the tobacco companies, is a
8
reliable source of information?
9
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; calls 10
for speculation.
11
A. About health?
12
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) About smoking and health, 13
yeah.
14
MR. STOEVER: Same objections, and it's 15
outside the scope of this witness's expertise.
16
A. I can't say. I can't say. I -- without
17
speculating about what's a reliable source.
18
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Well, is the American 19
Cancer Society a reliable source of health
20
information?
21
A. The issue is that you have studies showing
22
a relationship between, specifically, lung cancer and 23
other diseases and smoking; and if you're reading
24
about this in the newspaper as an average person, it 25

seems to me that if the headline says "Cigarettes

might think that the government was a more reliable 4
source than the tobacco industry's spokesperson or
5
statement in that same newspaper article.
6
Q. Well, is the Tobacco Institute more or less 7
reliable than the American Cancer Society?
8
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; calls 9
for speculation, outside the scope of this witness's
10
expertise.
11
A. I really can't say. The Tobacco Institute
12
was a public relations firm.
13
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Other than the tobacco 14
companies, can you point to any one group,
15
organization, company, manufacturer or individual that 16
maintained in the 1980s at any point in time that more 17
proof was needed to connect smoking cigarettes to 18
adverse health consequences?
19
MR. STOEVER: You're asking
20
specifically about the 1980s?
21
MR. GDANSKI: Yep.
22
A. Okay, ask the question again. Any other
23
group or individual or entity. . .
24
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Because I put so many 25
Linked to Lung Cancer" and the government is putting
out that information, that as a newspaper reader, you
Min-U-Script速
you've seen it covered in the publicly available press
in the '80s, the tobacco companies were the sole voice
of opposition that smoking cigarettes did not cause
any adverse health consequences, right?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form;
mischaracterizes her earlier testimony.
Can you answer the question?
A. I can't, really. They continued to be a
source of that message, and I don't know of any other
source that would have compared to them.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Do you know who the
president of the Tobacco Institute was in the 1980s?
A. No, I don't.
Page 100
Q. Have you studied the ebb and flow or the
rise and fall of cigarette consumption in this
country?
A. Not really, no. It isn't -- Sometimes in
researching these articles and newspapers you come
across economic articles about the sales of
cigarettes, but sometimes I include that in my
reliance materials simply because it's about tobacco,
but it's about an economic aspect of the industry.
Q. Let's take the -- Let's take Time magazine
as an example. You researched that between 1930 and
1990, right?
A. Uh-huh. Yes.
Q. How did you research that publication?
Tell me from start to finish the process, the word
searches, whatever it is that you did, the process you
did to research it to the point that you are here
today ready to rely or opine on it. Tell me what you
did, please.
A. The first thing that you do with a national
magazine like that is to look at Reader's Guide to
Literature, because you can look up individual topics;
smoking, cigarettes, health, anything that pertains to
your subject matter. You could be looking up the
atomic bomb, you could be looking up relations with

China.
So you do that first; and because, then, of
the type of magazine that it was, you then can go,
sometimes online, but usually in most libraries you
can go to back issues so you already have a list of
the articles from Reader's Guide, and then you go to
the specific articles in either hard copies or
digitized copies of Time magazine.
Q. So what search term did you use to decide
which articles you wanted to look at or not look at?
A. Well, as I said, I would -- I had -- I
looked individually or I had researchers look at the
topics I've just mentioned; tobacco, cigarettes, lung
cancer, any of the diseases associated with smoking.
I had them -- and I looked up the term "addiction."
So the Reader's Guide to Literature is a
very good one to use, and now part of it is online as
well, and then you go to the individual articles, in
this case, Time magazine.
Q. And once you have the individual article,
you just flip to the page in the article, or in the
magazine. You don't read through the entire magazine,
correct?
A. That's correct, yes.
Q. And the same is true with a newspaper. You

Q. And who decided which ones to include or
not include?
A. In terms of representative samples, I
determine that. From looking at all of the material,
I come to some conclusion about what I think is
representative and not repetitious of other articles.
Q. And was one of the terms that you would
search or research articles for, for example, Philip
Morris?
A. No, I didn't do names of individual
companies.
Q. Why not?
A. Simply because I'm looking for public
awareness about specific health hazards connected to
smoking, and the topics or the terms that I used or
suggested to my research assistant didn't include
tobacco companies per se.
Q. Why not though?
A. Because for one thing, these indices in the
Reader's Guide to Literature usually refers to -- The
word has to appear in the headline for you to get it,
and there weren't, in my research, especially in the
New York Times, it didn't indicate that "Philip
Morris" appeared very often in the headlines of any of
the stories on smoking.

would go to that page of that date in the newspaper as
opposed to reading through the newspaper, correct?
A. Yeah. Yes.
Q. And so was one of your searches tobacco
companies?
A. It was tobacco, and that would come up.
You would get, occasionally, an article on tobacco
companies under the heading of tobacco.
Q. And did you include all of the articles
that came up responsive to your word searches; or
after you found the articles, you would then read it
and then select which ones you wanted to include?
A. Include in what?
Q. Include in your reliance materials.
A. The reliance materials, to a large degree,
are representative samples of the total research. The
reliance list would be much larger if I included
everything, but I try to include a representative
sample.
For example, Time magazine published 50
articles on smoking and tobacco and health hazards
prior to 1964, prior to that Surgeon General's report,
so those -- I don't think all of them are included,
but enough of them are included to show the position
of Time magazine from the late 1930s to 1964.

Q. All right. So the way your research is
done, the word that you look up in the index has to
actually be in the headline of the article, right?
A. That's how they identify the articles, yes.
Q. And if it's not in the headline, you would
not have picked up on that article, correct?
A. That's true. It wouldn't be, in this
particular instance, in the Reader's Guide.
If I have a researcher, as I did with the
Palm Beach Post, going through day by day by day, then
you might pick up -- you might pick up more but,
again, the use of company names in headlines in
connection with this type of public awareness research
is really not very common at all.
Q. Right. And notwithstanding the fact that
the names may not be common in the headlines, you're
aware that in many articles tobacco companies or their
representatives are quoted within the body of the
article even though the thrust or the main point of
the article is not the position given forth by the
tobacco company, right?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. Well, I go out of my way to make sure that
that is included.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) You go out of your way to

do what?
A. To make sure that if there is an article, a
major study being discussed, to make sure to see
whether or not there is a statement by the tobacco
industry or representatives of tobacco companies.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) What were the major
studies that came out in the '50s on smoking and
health?
A. They begin, actually, in the late 1940s,
the Ochsner and DeBakey studies. You have one even in
1938 if you want to go back to the Pearl study. But
you begin with the Wynder and Graham, Hammond and Horn
studies coming out of England, all in the early 1950s,
the mouse study in 1953, and then the continuation of
Hammond and Horn studies through 1954, 1955, 1957.
You have studies on animals done, I think
in that time period as well, in the '50s; but you've
got, you know, probably a good dozen if you include
studies from England.
Q. And did the tobacco companies, in response
to each one of those major studies starting in 1953,
respond that the study was not properly done, it
wasn't conclusive in creating a causation between
smoking cigarettes and adverse health consequence?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.

A. To the degree that they responded to these
individual studies. They didn't respond, in every
article, to the study. They did assume a kind of
traditional line, yes.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) And to the degree that
there was a response to each of those studies, those
responses were portrayed in the public media, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. As I've already said, yes, they were
included in some of these articles.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) And then in 1964 with the
Surgeon General's report, the tobacco companies
responded to that report too, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And they responded by denying the accuracy
of the report and stating that more testing needed to
be done, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. Not in the language you were using. They
were careful not to use terms like "deny" or "this
report makes no sense." They didn't use emphatic
language like that.
They would usually even praise, in some
instances, the researchers who had worked for the
government and then go on to say, "But, indeed, we
Min-U-Script速
need more research," or "We even agree with some of
the scientists who are quoted saying we need more
research," so their response was a measured one.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) And the measured response
that was delivered by the tobacco companies was
essentially one that said more testing needed to be
done, there's nonconclusive proof linking smoking
cigarettes to adverse health consequences, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form;
mischaracterizes this witness's testimony just a
minute ago.
A. To the degree that I qualified my answer,
yes.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) And to the extent those
responses were made publicly by tobacco company
representatives, those responses and their positions
would be in the mass media and newspapers and
television, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form. Jon,
are you asking her if every time a position was taken,
it was put into the media?
MR. GDANSKI: No.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) I'm saying, when it was
in the media, it was made available to the public,
right?

MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; calls
for speculation.
A. Yes; but, again, it didn't always appear in
every story, but it was there in some of the stories.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Was there a single major
study done from 1960 going forward linking smoking
cigarettes to adverse health consequences that the
tobacco companies did not respond to and claim that
the testing was inadequate and more testing needed to
be done?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. I can't say, off the top of my head. I
know a couple of studies came out where the tobacco --
I'm trying to think of which one in particular --
where they objected before having read it, or they had
no response initially to the report, but I'd have to
look at the individual newspaper article to show you
where that occurred.
But it did occur occasionally, that they
would respond before reading or they would say, "We
have no response right now. We will give a response
later."
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) To which article, as best
you can recall, did they respond before even reading?
A. I'm trying to think of that, because I have

it -- I can look it up. I can't look it up right now,
but I could easily look that up because it stuck in my
head. It was an odd thing to say, that they were
responding before they had read it, and I didn't come
across it very often, but in this one particular
instance, I found it.
Q. You would agree that that's a strange thing
for a company to do when it comes to a public health
issue, right?
A. But it's coming later and later in the
course of decades of the '70s and '80s where they're
not responding as consistently or as often as they did
in the earlier decades.
Q. The situation in which they responded
before they even read the study, do you know what
decade that was in?
A. I think it was in the late '70s, if I'm not
mistaken, but I could look it up at another time.
Q. How would you look that up?
A. I would look at the reliance materials and
just scan or look at hard copy or look at the
digitized copy and find it.
Q. Well, I'm interested in knowing which one
you're talking about, so how long would it take you?
A. Today? I don't have any -- Well, it would

If you know, you can answer. If you don't,
please don't guess or speculate.
A. I don't know. That's why it stands out as
an oddity in my mind.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) You rely upon polls,
correct?
A. No, I don't.
Q. You don't have any polls on your reliance
list?
A. Yes, I have, I think, two.
Q. So you rely upon those polls, correct?
A. No, I use polls, as I've indicated in
previous depositions, to see whether or not the
general conclusions I'm coming to from the variety of
sources that I've mentioned here, whether I -- the
indication I have from these other sources about
general awareness on the health hazards of smoking and
the addictive nature of cigarettes, whether or not
there is some corroboration for the conclusion I've
already drawn.
And I used two polls from the 1950s because
that's the decade when these studies first -- the
scientific studies first came out and were receiving
all of this attention. So I thought it would be
worthwhile to look at a couple of polls, but the

take quite a while today to look it up, but we could
do it if you want.
Q. When you say "quite a while," do you mean
like an hour or ten minutes or 12 hours?
A. I would say well over an hour to make sure
I found the specific newspaper. I vaguely recall, I
think it was in the New York Daily News, but it might
have been another paper.
Q. It's on your reliance list, though,
correct?
A. Yes. Oh, definitely it's on the reliance
list, yes.
Q. Why do you think the tobacco companies
would respond to an article linking smoking cigarettes
to lung cancer or adverse health consequences
attacking the veracity of it before they've even read
the study?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the --
A. As I --
MR. STOEVER: You really do need to
wait to let me finish my objections, okay?
THE WITNESS: Okay.
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form. It
calls for speculation and it's outside the scope of

reason I looked at the two that are listed is that
they were cited in the newspaper articles that I was
reading to determine general awareness.
Q. What newspaper articles cited these polls
to determine general awareness?
A. The Gallup poll tended to be the one that
was cited the most on all topics, whether it was
smoking or whether it was foreign policy or
presidential elections; and there were newspaper
articles, then, indicating, in this case in the '50s,
the high percentage of people who, according to the
poll, were aware of some of the information about the
health hazards of smoking coming to the general public
through these scientific studies.
Q. The Gallup poll that you're referring to,
is that one poll or is that a series of polls taken
over that one period of time?
A. The two that I cite were one poll each for,
I think the one that's there is for 1954 and another
for 1957.
Q. I see three polls. Do you see three polls
cited in the material?
A. I don't have it. I don't have it in front
of me, the printed reliance list.
Q. You don't have an extra reliance list there

with you?
MR. STOEVER: We're looking.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Well, I'll tell you what
I see. I see one Gallup poll of public opinion, 1954, Q. Have you ever published any literature,
peer-reviewed or not peer-reviewed, on the subject
matter of which you're testifying today?
A. No, I have not.
Q. Have you ever began the process of
attempting to publish something in that regard?
A. No.
Q. Has Shook, Hardy & Bacon asked you not to
do that?
A. No, they have not.
Q. Is there any reason, given the amount of
time you've spent on this subject and the knowledge
1
2
3
4
0100, and then a Gallup poll of public opinion 1954,
5
0617.
6
A. Wait a minute. Which heading does it come 7
under here?
8
Q. "Other Materials."
9
A. Gotcha, okay. Yes, there was a poll in
10
January of '54 and then one in June of '54.
11
Q. And so are you relying upon those polls for 12
purposes of formulating your opinions in this case? 13
A. Only to the degree that I looked at them to
14
see whether they corroborated the fact that I thought, 15
from the evidence that I had looked at, that there was 16
an increase in public awareness about the health
17
hazards of smoking.
18
So there are two polls in '54 and one in
19
'57, and all I'm looking at in those polls is the
20
awareness question.
21
Q. And when you say -- Right, that was my
22
question of earlier. I just want to make sure I
23
understand.
24
Those polls have multiple questions asked 25

within the poll?

A. I'm con -- My concern is to see the answer,

or my research was to see the answer to the awareness 6
question.

Q. Okay. I'm going to pull that up quickly.

Hold on. Do you have a CD or a computer there with 9
the materials that were provided to me?
10
A. Yes.
11
Q. Dr. Hoff, what percentage of your time was 12
spent in the last year doing work for the tobacco 13
companies?
14
A. I don't know if I have an exact
15
percentage. I have hours listed in all of the
16
invoices; but, again, I've been probably busier in the 17
last year with respect to some of these Engle cases 18
than I have been previously, but I don't have a
19
percentage in mind.
20
Q. More than 15 percent of your professional 21
time?
22
A. I don't think so, because I teach, I still
23
write and do a lot of other professional things that
24
aren't associated with this work.

that you've amassed in this area, you've not published
something?
A. It's not unusual. I've studied other
topics and spent even more time than I have on this
particular topic and not published. It's not uncommon
for historians like myself to go into a topic or a
research project and not publish anything about it for
a variety of reasons.
Q. On the Gallup poll from 1957, did you look
at all the questions or did you just look at the one
that you've given me?
A. I looked only at the one I've given you
because Gallup, himself, was quoted in newspaper
Page 116
articles about the fact that he was surprised that
particular percentage was so high. And if you look at
any newspaper articles for that time period, which is,
what is it, July of '57, he's quoted about the poll,
so that's why it's there.
Q. Which question, I mean, there's five or six
different questions on the 1957 Gallup poll you've
given me. Which question is he quoted as indicating
it's higher than he anticipated?
A. The one which makes specific reference to
"Have you heard about a specific study?" I don't have
the wording in my mind but you should see it there,
"Have you heard about a specific," I don't know
whether it was American Cancer --
Q. American Cancer Society.
A. Yeah, that's the question.
Q. Okay. I see that on the first page of this
three-page PDF.
A. Yes.
Q. With the other questions on this poll, did
he also discuss the responses being outside of the
area in which he anticipated?
MR. STOEVER: You mean did Gallup
discuss them?
MR. GDANSKI: Yeah.

A. When he was interviewed or gave a press
release on this one, on this particular poll? The
only one he discusses is this one because of the
specific reference to the American Cancer Society.
The specificity of that question and the answer to it
made him release -- give an interview or release to
the press his opinion about how high he thought it
was.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) That's the first poll
there, right?
A. Yes, the one I'm looking at, yes.
Q. On that same PDF, if you're looking at the
same thing I'm looking at, there's four or five
different questions which you've included on this
piece of reliance material, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And for those other questions, did he also
comment on the answer being outside of what he
expected it to be or are they just there because you
find them to be polls that are reliable?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. Yeah, they're a part of his poll. He only
comments on the awareness question in the press.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) And so these other polls
that are here are polls that are on your reliance

still probably the best known, though the Pew
Foundation now, I think, equals it in reliability.
Q. Which organization?
A. The Pew Foundation does polls now, but
that's. . .
Q. And have you reviewed any other Gallup
polls other than the ones you've included on your
reliance list?
A. No, because for the most part, on the topic
that I researched, these were the only ones that I
came across that you couldn't miss if you were reading
the stories about the health hazards of smoking and
the scientific studies which were seemingly proving
the health hazards of smoking.
Q. Is there any reason you don't include
belief studies in your polls, or belief polls in your
reliance materials, I should say?
A. Because public awareness doesn't really
have anything to do with belief or causation; and,
consequently, there's no reason for me to include
these or rely on the belief polls at all.
Q. Are you aware that the tobacco companies
commissioned organizations to do polls on their
behalf?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form. It's

materials even though Mr. Gallup, himself, did not
comment on them, correct?
A. Yes. I mean, they happen to be part of
this poll.
Q. And you're relying upon this poll, correct?
A. I'm relying on the awareness question,
which is the first question we look at. This other
question that you brought up here is a belief question
which I don't use in my research.
Q. So even though you included all three pages
of this PDF, you're only relying on the first poll?
A. Because it's the awareness question, yes.
MR. STOEVER: Jon, just to be clear, we
included the entire document so as to avoid any
concerns about cherry-picking, so that's why you have
the entire document.
MR. GDANSKI: So you avoided
cherry-picking when you gave it to me, but now she's
cherry-picking that one poll out anyway.
MR. STOEVER: No, not at all. Not at
all. She's been very clear that that's the poll she's
relying on.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Okay. Is the Gallup
organization a reliable polling organization?
A. Well, it was the first, and I think it's

outside the scope of this witness's expertise. If you
know, you can answer.
A. I've been told they have but I have no
personal or professional research knowledge of it.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) And if they, in fact, had
done awareness polls, wouldn't you be interested in
seeing the results of the tobacco company-commissioned
awareness polls?
A. Only if they appeared in the public domain.
Q. Did these polls appear in the public
domain?
A. The comments on them in these three cases,
the answer is yes, they did appear in the press.
Q. Can you show me the article now, as we sit
here, that discusses the 1954 June Gallup poll?
A. I can't offhand. I can probably more
easily -- well, I don't even know. I could certainly
find, I think, the 1957 one.
Q. I didn't ask about that one.
A. Yeah. I could look for the '54 one and
find it at some point.
For this particular case, we're talking
about the New York Daily News newspapers exclusively
and not all of the other newspapers where this might
have occurred.

Q. But was there an article that appeared in
any paper on your reliance list that discusses the
January 1957 Gallup poll? I'm sorry, 1954; sorry,
1954.
A. I've run across articles that do do that.
I would have to look back specifically to see if the
New York Daily News, which is the only paper we're
concerned with in this case, actually carried the
story. the word.
Q. I don't want to know what you guys talked
about then.
Who have you met with regarding this case?
A. Regarding this case?
Q. Yes.
A. In terms of attorneys?
Q. Yes.
A. With Lori McGroder here, with Tom Stoever

Q. Why do you say that the New York Daily News 10
is the only paper we're concerned with? You've 11
included the Newsday, the New York Times, Palm Beach 12
Post. Why are you saying the New York Daily News is 13
the only paper you're concerned with in this case? 14
A. I'm saying that because it's the -- It's
15
not the only paper I'm basing my awareness knowledge 16
of on, but what I am saying is it's the paper that
17
Dominick Tullo read, and that's why it happens to be 18
in the list of newspapers along with the other two
19
newspapers he read. He didn't read the New York 20
Times.
21
Q. Then why did you include them in your
22
reliance list?
23
A. Because for showing general awareness, you 24
have to include especially national newspapers which 25

could be read in the community in which the Tullos
lived, either in Long Island or in Brooklyn or in
Florida, to give a comprehensive picture of what was
available to the community at any given time, and he
lived in three different communities during the course
of his life.
(Request from the reporter.)
MR. GDANSKI: Let's go ahead and take a
break for a few minutes, then, because I've got to
find an email.
MR. STOEVER: Do you want to go ahead
and take a lunch break?
(Off the record.)
(A lunch recess was taken.)
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Did you have a good
lunch, Dr. Hoff?
A. Yes.
Q. All right. Did you talk to counsel who is
there with you today over the lunch break?
A. About this deposition?
Q. No, about anything.
A. We did talk but it had nothing to do with
this.
Q. What did you guys talk about?
A. It was totally frivolous in every sense of
Min-U-Script速
now, and Tim Conway. Conway? Congrove, Congrove.
Q. Who was the first person you said was there
with you today? I didn't know someone else was
there.
A. Yeah, she introduced herself; Lori
McGroder.
Q. I must have missed that, I'm sorry. Who is
she with?
A. Shook, Hardy & Bacon.
Q. Okay, gotcha. And when did you meet
Ms. McGroder?
MS. McGRODER: It's McGroder, with an
"o."
MR. GDANSKI: McGroder, sorry.
A. Well, today, and I've met with her, I
think, on one other deposition, wasn't it? Yeah.

case.

Q. For how long did you meet with her
yesterday?
A. I think maybe three, three-and-a-half
hours.
Q. And when did you meet with Mr. Congrove?
A. That was a couple, three weeks ago at
another deposition.
Q. And you discussed this case?
A. It came up. It was really not concerned
with this case, basically.
Q. What did you guys talk about concerning
this case?
A. I think just simply something about the
scheduling for this deposition.
Q. All right. Who else have you met with?
A. Just the names I've given you.
Q. Okay. All right. And was anybody
else there with you yesterday when you met with
Ms. McGroder?
A. Yes, Tom Stoever was there.
Q. Tom Stoever was there, okay. And had you
met with Mr. Stoever about this case before yesterday?

than Mr. Congrove?
A. And. . .
Q. Before yesterday. Before yesterday.
A. Before yesterday. We didn't really meet
with Congrove about this case. It just came up in the
course of another deposition.
Q. Okay. So other than Mr. Congrove, set him
aside for a second, you've never met with anybody
regarding this case before yesterday, correct?
A. That's true.
Q. Who have you spoken to other than the three
people we've discussed regarding this case?
A. No one except Vickie Thompson.
Q. So who sent you the depositions?
A. Shook, Hardy & Bacon.
Q. How? By mail? Email? Fax?
A. By mail, by FedEx.
Q. Did they just show up at your house?
A. Yes.
Q. Would you agree that it's different to
describe a product as being hard to quit than
describing it as being addictive?

other than what you saw regarding the tobacco
companies' public position, right?
A. Yes, that's correct.
Q. I mean, you don't know if internally they
said nicotine is addictive. They may, they may not
have, right?
A. Correct.
Q. They may, for all you know, said, "We want
to kill our consumers," right?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; calls
for speculation and it's argumentative.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) My point is, you have no
idea what they knew internally one way or the other,
from A to Z, right?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form. It's
argumentative.
A. I don't research it.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Right. I mean, you don't
know?
A. Right.
Q. So from what you do know, the tobacco
companies did not say that nicotine is addictive at
any point in time you've researched relative to this
case, right?
A. Ask the question again. I missed it.

that it was public knowledge that it was hard to quit, 5
right?

A. Right.

Q. And I'm asking, that's different than
8
saying it was public knowledge that it was addictive,
9
correct?
10
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; same 11
objection.
12
A. Not necessarily. The terms "hard to quit,"
13
"addictive," "habit forming" are terms that were used 14
interchangeably for a long time.
15
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) But not by the tobacco 16
industry. They did not use the term "addictive," 17
correct?
18
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form;
19
outside the scope of the witness's expertise unless
20
you're asking her about what she saw in news reports. 21
MR. GDANSKI: Well, obviously that's
22
what I'm asking her about. She doesn't know anything 23
else.
24
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) You don't know anything 25
Page 128
Q. Sure. Based on your research in this case
and the materials you reviewed and you're relying
upon, at no point in time did the tobacco companies
ever publicly say, "Our cigarettes are addictive.
Nicotine is addictive"?
A. Not to -- through the time periods that
I've researched, that's correct.
Q. Is there any example on your reliance list
where a tobacco company representative stated publicly
that smoking cigarettes is hard to quit?
A. I don't think so. I know when the
addiction study came out in '88 there was some
response indicating that people could quit, or had
quit.
Q. Right, but you're not familiar with any
public statement by the tobacco companies in your
reliance list where they stated that smoking
cigarettes is difficult to quit, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. And would you agree that at various
points in time, filtered cigarettes were advertised
and marketed as safer alternatives to nonfiltered
cigarettes?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form. It's
outside the scope of the witness's expertise.

If you know, you can answer.
A. I really don't know, but the few ads I saw
did not say they were safe. They said every other
thing under the sun, but not safe.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Say that answer again.
I'm sorry, I missed you.
A. Ask the question again. What was the
question?
MR. STOEVER: Do you want the answer
read back, Jon?
MR. GDANSKI: Yeah, if we could just
have the answer read back, I'd appreciate that.
(Answer on page 129, lines 2
through 4, read by the reporter.) for speculation.
A. I could only guess, and that would be that
practically every ad carried nationally would have
reached as many people as the Frank Statement.

Is there anything else in your reliance list that was

17
or flavor or smoothness.
18
Q. Okay. Putting the ads aside or -- putting 19
the ads aside for a second, the general message coming 20
out in the public arena was that filtered cigarettes 21
were a safer alternative to full-strength or
22
nonfiltered cigarettes, correct?
23
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
24

A. I've seen figures that vary on it. It's

anywhere from maybe, I don't know, the figures I've 11
seen don't jibe completely. Maybe -- I don't know. I 12
can't say right now, but I know the figures aren't
13
always the same.
14
Q. Is there any other document on your
15
reliance list that was published in as many newspapers 16
and reached as many people as the Frank Statement? 17
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; calls 18
for speculation.
19
A. Any other what? Any other document?
20
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Is there anything else on 21
your entire reliance list that was published in as 22
many newspapers and reached as many viewers as the 23
Frank Statement?
24
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; calls 25
Min-U-Script速
published on one day that reached as many people and
as many subscribers as the Frank Statement did?
MR. STOEVER: Object to form; calls for
speculation.
A. Yeah, I could only guess at that. On that
day there would have been ads all over the place going
across the nation for all kinds of products.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Right, but an ad that
runs in the New York Times for a New York-based
product doesn't run in the Miami Herald for that same
product, and it certainly wouldn't run in a
Mississippi newspaper or a California newspaper.
The Frank Statement ran in all those types
of papers, right?
A. I don't know that because I'm not an ad
expert. I wouldn't know that there was a discrepancy,
as you've just stated here, between ads that ran in
different parts of the country.
Q. Do you think that Dominick Tullo knew or
Page 132
should have known that smoking cigarettes caused lung
cancer when he started smoking cigarettes?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form. It's
outside the scope of this witness's expertise.
A. I don't know what he knew at really any
stage in his life, but particularly at the age of 12.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) He was just a kid when he
was 12, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Have you reviewed your depositions from
prior cases?
A. I actually looked back at the Barbanell
deposition.
Q. Oh, yeah? Why?
A. Because you were going to be participating
in this one. It seemed to make sense.
Q. It's been so long since then, Dr. Hoff. So
much has happened.
What effect, if any, did the dual message
have on the consuming public regarding the health
effects of smoking?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. What effect did the dual message have?
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Yeah. In other words,
there was some message coming out that smoking

cigarettes was harmful and that was, you know, a
strong message, and there was some message coming out
that smoking cigarettes was yet to proven. I'm
asking, what's the effect that that would have on the
consuming public?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form. It's
outside the scope of this witness's expertise. She's
not a consumer expert.
A. You're asking me if it would affect they're
buying habits or patterns, and I don't know.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Do you know if
cigarette consumption dropped to any degree after
the mouse-painting study came out?
A. After the mouse study?
Q. Yeah.
A. Yes, there were newspapers that showed
there was a drop.
Q. And do you know if there was a slight bump
or increase after the Frank Statement?
A. That, I don't know at all.
Q. Have you ever studied that, you know,
studied the rise and fall of consumption relative to
major studies and then, again, relative to industry
denials of those studies?
MR. STOEVER: Objection to the form.

stated.
Q. Do you know when the Surgeon General first
determined that nicotine is addictive?
A. Well, I know when the report appeared.
Q. When was that?
A. As we've talked about, it was in 1988.
Q. And before that, had the Surgeon General
determined that nicotine was addictive?
A. I don't know.
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) You don't know?
A. I only know how that report was published
and televised.
Q. Okay. You don't know of any reports prior
to that one that had concluded that nicotine is
addictive?
MR. STOEVER: Any Surgeon General
reports?
MR. GDANSKI: Yes.
A. No, I don't know of any Surgeon General
reports that focused on that.

Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Why wouldn't you include
3
the Waxman hearings on materials that you rely upon
4
considering you're aware of them, you're familiar with 5
them, and they occurred during the lifetime of
6
Dominick Tullo?
7
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; asked 8
and answered.
9
A. I previously said that it occurred in 1994,
10
beyond the time when I finished my research in '90, 11
and simply would have reinforced the conclusions I'd 12
already come to.
13
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) But why would Congress 14
feel the need to engage in those hearings if they 15
simply reinforced what you think was totally, you 16
know, completely understood at that time? Why would 17
Congress do that?
18
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form. It
19
calls for speculation.
20
A. I have a hard time understanding why
21
Congress does a lot of things, and I really don't know 22
what prompted that particular hearing.
23
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Have you ever been
24
instructed to cut your research off at 1990?
25
Page 136
or another whether before the '88 report, whether the
Surgeon General had determined nicotine was addictive
in the report?
A. That's correct, I don't know.
Q. Have you read the 1988 Surgeon General
report?
A. I've only read about it as it was reported
on.
Q. Have you read the 1964 Surgeon General's
report?
A. I looked more carefully at that, but
primarily what I know about it was the extensive
coverage it received in the newspapers, but it is on
the reliance list.
Q. Do you know if the tobacco companies
engaged in campaigns to exchange coupons for their
cigarettes?
A. Engaged in campaigns to exchange?
Q. Yeah, you know, like people would get
coupons, send them in for cigarettes, stuff like
that.
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form. It's
outside the scope of this witness's expertise.
A. I don't know if they engaged in an
exchange. I know there were coupons but that's it.

Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Do you know if Dominick
Tullo ever filled out any sort of marketing materials Q. So I still don't understand why that's
significant. I'm sorry. Does that -- Are you trying
1
2
and sent them to Philip Morris?
3
A. Marketing materials pertaining to coupons?
4
Q. Yes.
5
A. There's testimony in the deposition that he
6
did use coupons.
7
Q. Do you know where those coupons were
8
published or where they were given out, how consumers
9
got coupons like that?
10
A. There is no indication in the deposition at
11
all.
12
Q. No, from your studies and your reading of 13
the subject matter, do you know how smokers got 14
coupons from companies?
15
A. I haven't studied it.
16
Q. But you never came across that in your
17
reading?
18
A. Came across what?
19
Q. An article discussing the tobacco companies 20
using marketing of coupons as a device to get smokers 21
to send coupons in for their products.
22
A. No, I --
23
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
24
A. (continuing) I didn't come across an
25
to say that the tobacco companies didn't come up with
the notion of having a Frank Statement?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. I'm saying that the ad was not as unique as
it might be implied that it was.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Who is implying that the
Frank Statement was unique because of its title?
A. I -- I -- I think that it comes up so much
in these depositions that the importance of that
particular Frank Statement, I think, has been implied
over and over again.
Q. Right. And I'm saying, the title, though,
you seem to think that because there were other
documents or advertisements called "the Frank
Statement" about constipation or about Propecia or
whatever it is, that somehow makes the tobacco Frank
Statement less significant; is that what you're
saying?
A. Just not as unique, I think, as sometimes
is implied.
Q. Who is implying that it's unique?
A. Very often I think the singling out of the
Frank Statement in depositions carries the implication

article that I can recall saying that.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) You have on your reliance
list something called "Other Frank Statements." Do
you know what I'm talking about?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. What is that?
A. It's, um -- It's what it says it is. It
refers to, the ones you have on the reliance list, it
refers to Frank Statements in the 1950s advertising
other products.
Q. What significance does it have? Why are
those on your reliance list?
A. It's because I've been asked so many times
about the Frank Statement that I decided to see
whether or not the Frank Statement that comes up in
these depositions was a unique type of advertising,
basically, or if it were just a commonplace thing; and
it's fairly easy to determine that all kinds of
products were advertised with the phrase "Frank
Statement."
Q. "All kinds," meaning four?
A. No. Well, for the four that are there
which involve, what, hormones, baldness, a few other
topics of interest in the '50s, but they go back to
the 1920s.

with it that it received great attention at the time;
and if there are other Frank Statements out there, I
think that probably isn't true that it stood out in
any way, shape or form to the reader of ads in that
time period.
Q. And so would you agree that the Frank
Statement is the first time the tobacco companies
publicly voiced their position that there was no link
between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer --
(Interrupted by the reporter.)
MR. GDANSKI: Sorry. I'll ask it
again.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Would you agree that the
Frank Statement was the first time that the tobacco
companies unifiedly publicly voiced their position,
their joint position, that smoking cigarettes had not
been adequately proven to cause any adverse health
consequences or the testing done was inadequate and
more testing needed to be done? Would you agree with
that?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form and to
the characterization of the document.
A. Yeah, I couldn't -- It's an ad. I couldn't
say whether or not they had done this collectively
before.

Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Well, are you familiar
with any other collective statements such as the Frank
Statement giving forth that position prior to the
Frank Statement?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. I'm not, no.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Have you ever been asked
about one or seen one?
A. I don't think so.
Q. I mean, you've reviewed the available
public materials on this issue, right?
A. Right.
Q. So let's assume for a minute that the Frank
Statement is the first time that that statement is
collectively made by the tobacco companies.
Would you agree that it's, therefore,
significant because it's the starting point in the
tobacco companies' public position that more testing
needs to be done, and the testing that's done is
inadequate?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form and to
the characterization of the document.
A. It's the first ad. That's all I can say.
There were responses to some of the earlier reports,
scientific reports, before the mouse statement, but I

Q. Do you know if cigarette consumption now is
more or less than it was in 1970?
A. I don't, and I don't know whether you're
asking proportionately or percentage-wise. I don't
know.
Q. Have you seen advertisements on TV from
Philip Morris encouraging people to quit smoking?
A. Have I, personally?
Q. Yes.
A. Yes.
Q. Did you come across those types of
advertisements in your research?
A. No.
Q. You wouldn't have seen those types of ads
from Philip Morris in the '70s or '80s, correct?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form; calls
for speculation.
A. I wouldn't have personally; and
professionally, I wasn't aware of them.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) The warnings; are you
prepared to discuss the different warnings that were
on the cigarette packs?
A. Only as they were reported on, again, to
the American public and as they emerged from some of
these hearings.

Q. When did the first warning label go on

trade organizations, correct?
10
A. '69.
A. Yes.
11
Q. And what did that warning label say?
Q. Do you know when the Tobacco Institute was 12
A. It was just the most cautionary one; it may

13 be harmful.
A. I would be guessing, but I think I've read
14
Q. Exactly what did the warning say?
that it was disbanded in 1998. That might have been 15
A. I don't have the exact wording, but I know
the TIRC, but something was disbanded in 1998.
16 it was the least emphatic of all of the warnings.
Q. And do you know why it was disbanded? 17
Q. So as you sit here today, you can't tell me
A. No, I don't really have any inside
18 what the first warning label was on cigarettes?
information about why it was disbanded.
19
A. Not right now, no.
Q. And how about the Tobacco Industry Research 20
Committee, do you know when that was disbanded? 21
A. As far as I know, its function was taken
over by the Council on Tobacco Research in '64.
Q. Okay. When was the CTR disbanded?
A. I don't know.

Q. And when did the second warning label go on
cigarettes?
A. It went on later in the '70s.
Q. And do you know what year?
A. I don't offhand right now.
Q. And what did the second warning label say?

Q. Can you tell me, as you sit here today,
specifically what that warning label said?
A. No, I can't specifically say.
Q. And how many warning labels were there? Is
there a third set? A fourth set?
A. Well, in the '80s you have rotating
messages.
Q. When in the '80s did the rotating messages
come on?
A. I think sometime in the first half of the
'80s.
Q. Like '82?
A. I don't know if it was that early; closer,
maybe, to '85.
Q. Okay. And do you know what the rotating
warnings are?
A. I don't know the exact wording but they
varied by disease or by whatever health concern was
being expressed.
Q. So as you sit here now, you can't tell me
specifically and accurately what any one of the
warnings that have ever been on cigarette packs have
ever said, correct?

Q. Do you know if the tobacco companies ever
threatened to withhold advertising in any newspapers
or periodicals that wrote negatively about their
product?

Just give me one second to get my
objections in.
THE WITNESS: Okay.
A. No, I don't.

Tobacco Institute advertisements?

not.
Q. Can you name any of the spokespeople for
the Tobacco Institute?
A. No.
Q. Can you name any of the spokespeople for
Philip Morris who spoke on --

it's outside the scope of the witness's expertise.
11
A. After the legislation was passed, I don't

think they had much choice.

Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Well, none of us do, but 14
you've read the, you know, discussions in the
15
congressional hearings leading up to the Federal 16
Cigarette Labeling Act, correct?
17
A. I've read some of it, yes.

Q. And the tobacco companies, they had

representatives speak on their behalf, their CEOs or 20
their corporate witnesses, correct?
21

Q. Have you ever seen the Ted Koppel interview

Q. Did you include that on your reliance list?
A. I don't think it is on the reliance list.
Q. It appeared in the public press, right?
A. It appeared on television. I'm not sure --
Yeah, it appeared on television.
Q. Yeah, that's the same thing. It appeared
publicly; and 20/20 is a big show, right?
A. It was, yes.
Q. And do you know who Edward Horrigan is now;
do you remember him?
A. No, I don't because I didn't concentrate on
that program.
Q. There were portions of that program, pretty
extensive, that had public health advocates, you know,
informing the public that smoking cigarettes obviously
causes diseases such as lung cancer and heart disease
and emphysema. How come you didn't include those
portions which fit nicely with the other materials
you've included on your reliance list?

A. Yeah, I can't really say what its impact
was or what its importance was. I only vaguely

with the message that was out there for the public

MR. STOEVER: Object to the form. It's
outside the scope of this witness's expertise. She's
already testified she's not here to talk about
advertising.
A. That's correct, I'm not.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) But those are documents,
those are motion pictures, those are television
commercials that appeared in the public atmosphere.
Those are things that my client, Dominick Tullo, or
any of the smokers who died in whose cases you've
testified for tobacco companies could have just as
easily seen, right?
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form. It
calls for speculation.
A. They may have just as easily seen them,
yes, but I don't know if that's the case or not.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) And "Smoke, Smoke, Smoke
the Cigarette," the song, why do you have that on
there?
A. Well, it's on there, one, first of all,
because it was one of the first cross-over songs where
a country and western went to the pop charts; but it's
also on there because it was then rerecorded by a

has another side to the story where cigarette
advertisements or cigarette companies used the
Flintstones to market their product --

MR. GDANSKI: I'll go back.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Dr. Hoff, really sort of
the question is, and I know you've been asked before,
why didn't you include anything that has, you know,
the slightest bit of the other side to that story; the
Beverly Hillbillies shows that were sponsored by
tobacco companies, the Flintstone shows where they
were peddling Winston cigarettes, the Lucy and Desi
show sponsored by Philip Morris, Frank Sinatra

a witness?
A. No, I don't.
Q. Why don't you just give me two minutes to
check a couple things and I think we might be done.
MR. GDANSKI: If you guys have a clean
copy of the Notice there, let's mark that --
MR. STOEVER: We do.
MR. GDANSKI: -- and a copy of the
disclosure.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Dr. Hoff, I don't have a
copy. Can you just take a minute to read through that
to let me know if there is any area on the disclosure
we have not touched on?
A. Okay.
MR. STOEVER: We'll mark it first.
(Exhibits 3 and 4 were marked.)
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Have you reviewed the
disclosure, Dr. Hoff?
A. Yes, I have.
Q. Is there anything raised in that disclosure
that you and I have not talked about today?
A. I don't think so. It looks like, I think
we've gone over practically everything.
I might indicate to you that I have a more
updated vitae that you should have, but aside from
Min-U-Script速
that, it's fine.
Q. On your updated vitae you haven't published
anything in the area of tobacco or cigarettes or
public awareness of health hazards of smoking, have
you?
A. No, I haven't.
MR. STOEVER: Jon, just so you know, I
have a copy of the updated vitae electronically which
I tried to send you this morning, but it's in a format
my email won't digest properly, so I will email that
as soon as I get back to Denver so you can have it in
a usable format.
MR. GDANSKI: That's fine with me.
Q. (By Mr. Gdanski) Do you have any
depositions scheduled in the next 60 days?
A. In the next 60 days? No.
Q. Any anticipated trial testimony in the next
60 days?
A. Yes, in the Campbell case.
Q. Where is that case located?
A. In Tampa, as far as I know.
Q. Do you know who the plaintiff's lawyer is?
A. No, I don't.
Q. You haven't been deposed in that case yet?
A. No, I have not.

Q. But you anticipate testifying at trial in
the next 60 days?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know if they're going to take your
deposition?
A. As far as I know, they're not, but I'm not
sure about that.
Q. Okay. Well, that's interesting.
MR. GDANSKI: Thank you, Dr. Hoff. I
have no further questions for you.
MR. STOEVER: Any questions from anyone
on the phone?
MR. BIDEAU: Not from me.
MS. KASTHEL: This is Nancy Kasthel. I
missed part of the beginning of the deposition. I can
do this off the record. I just wanted to ask what
documents the witness brought with her. I can talk to
the reporter if it makes it easier.
MS. MONROE: Aulica Monroe for
Reynolds. I don't have anything.
MR. STOEVER: And we have no questions
here, so thank you very much everybody.
(Whereupon, the deposition was
concluded at 1:48 p.m. MST)
(Signature required.)
