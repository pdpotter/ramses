LOUIS KYRIAKOUDES, Ph.D. having been first duly sworn, was examined and testified as follows: EXAMINATION BY MS. BROWN:
Q. Good morning, Professor Kyriakoudes.
A. Good morning.
Q. I introduced myself before we got started. Again, my name is Jenny Brown. I know you've been through this several times so you could probably tell me the ground rules as easily as I could tell them to you, right?
A. Yes.
Q. You know that if at any point you need a break, you just let me know and we'll take a break, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. And if I ask you a question that you don't understand, you should let me know that you don't understand it so that I can rephrase it?
A. I understand that.
Q. Professor Kyriakoudes, where are
you a professor?
A. I'm associate professor of history and director of the Center for Oral History and Cultural Heritage at the University of Southern Mississippi.
Q. Are you currently teaching a class at that university?
A. You mean, like, right now, this week?
Q. Yes.
A. No. It's the summer.
Q. So you're on summer break?
A. Well, I have administrative responsibilities but I don't teach in the summer.
Q. Besides your administrative responsibilities, do you do anything else during the summer for the university, any other type of employment for the university?
A. Well, summer is when I catch up on my research, my writing, grant writing, things like that. I mean, I'm busy all year.
Q. You don't teach any kind of summer school class?_
A. No. I haven't taught summer school since 2001.
Q. How many classes do you teach during your school year?
A. I teach one class in the fall and one in the spring.
Q. And that would be true for the academic year that's coming up?
A. That's correct.
Q. We're here today for the Barbanell case, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. When were you first contacted to work on the Barbanell case?
A. I was contacted with a telephone call by Mr. Jonathan Gdanski, I would say-this is the end of June- some time towards the end of May.
Q. Was that the first time you had talked to Mr. Gdanski about the Barbanell case?
A. Yeah, in May. It was- it was May to mid May, but mid May, yeah.
Q. Prior to that phone call from Mr.
.....Gdanski. had vou talked to any other lawyer.......
at the Schlesinger firm?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. I don't think so. I get a lot of calls, particularly lately, and I talk to a lot of people but I don't think I've spoken to any other lawyers at the Schlesinger firm.
MS. BROWN:
Q. And on that call in May, what did Mr. Gdanski tell you?
A. He didn't tell me anything. He asked me if I would agree to serve as an expert witness on a couple of cases that his firm was handling, and we discussed them and I agreed.
Q. In addition to Barbanell, what other case are you working on with Mr.
Gdanski?
A. Grossman.
Q. Other than Grossman and Barbanell, any other cases that you're working on with Mr. Gdanski or his firm, the Schlesinger firm?
MR GDANSKI:_
I'm just going to object and I'm going to instruct him not to answer to the extent that he may be working on cases where he has not been disclosed as an expert to testify in a deposition case specific as opposed to relying upon the generic testimony given in a trial preservation deposition.
So, Professor, subject to the extent that there are other cases you're aware of that you're working on with us case specific, you can answer-- I mean, do not answer.
A. Okay. Well, I know I've been disclosed as an expert in the Grossman case, so those are the two cases that I'm currently working on.
And when I say working on, I interpret that to mean actually doing work as opposed to simply having my name appended to a case, which, as you're aware, my name is out there on all kinds of documents that
I,	you know, don't know about in the sense that I don't keep up with that aspect of it.
MS. BROWN:
Q. With the Schlesinger firm, the Grossman and Barbanell case, did you understand you've been listed in those cases to provide case specific testimony?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, when you say case specific, explain to me what you mean by that in a nonlegal -MS. BROWN:
Q. Well, actually, I'm taking you back to what Mr. Gdanski said; he asked you to the extent there are any other cases, other than Grossman and Barbanell, where you've been listed as a case specific witness versus a generic witness, he wanted to clarify the question that way.
So I'm asking you is it your understanding that you've been listed as a case specific witness in Barbanell and Grossman?
A. Okay. So I'll answer that question by, first, the distinction between generic and case specific for me, as a historian, is not a significant difference._
Now, these terms may have very precise, specific legal meanings in the courtroom.
I'm not in a position to discuss the meanings of those terms; you're in a better position than I am.
I handle these cases like I've handled all the cases I've been involved with it where I come in and I'm principally a historian of the tobacco industry.
I've talked about- I've often talked about the role of the tobacco industry, the role of the cigarette in American life. And to the extent that the individual smokers who are parties to the litigation in some capacity, whether it's a decedent or plaintiff or what have you, to the extent that their particular circumstances matter, really, in all my cases, I've only been interested or I've been interested in, basically, where they are in historical time and space so that I may appropriately put them in context.
So that's- that's how I approach this. That may or may not be clear to you .....and- but that's how I understand mv role in.......
this.
Q. When you say to put them in context of historical time and space, can you explain to me what you mean by that?
A. Yes. Well, let's take, for example, in this case, Ms. Barbanell, she's born in 1923. That means that she is, you know, becoming a smoker in the 1930s.
And the 1930s, in terms of the history of the cigarette, the history of the role of smoking in American life is different than, say, the history of smoking in the 1970s. And, so, simply understanding where she fits in historical time is important.
Q. But that's different than in the case of the generic testimony that you gave in January, correct?
A. Well, in that- in that, I was asked questions about the role of the tobacco industry and in American life, the principal focus of those questions were really on industry statements and that's important.
_But I guess the idea behind that_
videotaped testimony, so-called generic testimony, was that it could be used in many cases, so therefore, I was asked very broad questions.
Q. And in that generic testimony, the historical context of the smokers wasn't important to you and to your opinions, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
Mischaracterizes the prior testimony in his prior statement.
A. Well, again, I have to go back to what I said earlier, in the generic testimony I was principally asked a line of questions about- about the industry itself and their statements over a long period.
That testimony- that testimony was also very long, you know. Usually, I don't testify for that length of time in front of a jury. That's also a reason to know the specifics, as I described earlier, of historical time, historical space of the plaintiff or the decedent, the victim of smokinq. Because for efficiency's sake, I
don't have to recount the entire history of what I know when a portion of that's only relevant.
MS. BROWN:
Q. So you would agree, for purposes of your opinion, what's relevant is those-are those time periods in which Shirley Barbanell was a smoker?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
Mischaracterizes testimony.
A. Well, or I would just broaden it a little bit, you know, her life, the period of time bounded by her birth and passing.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Do you know whether the Schlesinger law firm has disclosed you as a generic expert witness- expert witness in other cases they have pending in Florida?
A. I wouldn't know either way. My understanding was that with the generic testimony, that was just something out there that people could use. So they may have.
Q. So it's not you expectation that before you be disclosed as an expert in a_
case that you be contacted by the plaintiff's law firm that's disclosing you?
A. Well, if they want me to appear live they have to contact me.
Q. But if they just want to play your videotape you don't expect to be contacted?
A. No. I mean, that's done. That takes none of my time.
Q. I think you had indicated a prior deposition, perhaps the one in January, that you thought if plaintiff's lawyer was going to play your videotaped testimony in front of a jury that you ought to be paid some kind of royalty or fee. Have you negotiated that kind of compensation with any plaintiff's lawyer?
A. I haven't, no. You know, it's in the public realm now so it's out there.
Q. Do you have any objection to a plaintiff's lawyer or plaintiff's law firm playing your videotaped testimony rather than contacting you and compensating you for your time to testify live in a case?
MR. GDANSKI:
......................Obi ect to .the .form.:..................................................
A. No. I'm pretty busy right now. The- I didn't- no, I don't have an objection.
MS. BROWN:
Q. When Mr. Gdanski contacted you in May, did he describe for you the type of testimony that he was wanting to illicit from you in this case?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. No. I told him what my general opinions and general testimony have been over the years that I've been involved in this as a way of letting him know what my area of expertise was.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Did he describe for you the facts specific to Shirley Barbanell in the Barbanell case?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. I asked him just in a general sense what- a set of questions designed to arrive at answers to what I've been describing, that is locating her in time and
place.
MS. BROWN:
Q. So you asked him her birthday?
A. Yes. Or year, you know, what year was she born, you know, where was she from, that kind of thing; was she male or female, basic demographic characteristics.
Q. Did Mr. Gdanski provide you that information?
A. He told me over the phone, yes.
Q. Now, in addition to telling you the demographic information about Shirley Barbanell, did Mr. Gdanski provide you any other information or materials related to the Barbanell case?
A. Yes. He sent me three depositions.
Q. What three depositions did Mr. Gdanski send you?
A. Leon Barbanell, the husband; Ms. Segal, the stepdaughter of Leon Barbanell, the daughter of Ms. Barbanell; and, then, his sister-in-law.
Q. Do you recall the sister-in-law's name?
A. Her last name is Barbanell. She's Abraham Barbanell's wife. It was with a V.
I'm just drawing a blank.
Q. How about Fay?
A. Fay, that's what it was, thank
you.
Q. Other than those three depositions, did Mr. Gdanski provide you any other depositions in the Barbanell case?
A. No. That's all I have.
Q. Did you ask him if there were any other fact witness depositions taken in the Barbanell case?
A. No. I didn't ask that question.
Q. Would you want to know, for purposes of preparing yourself to give opinions in the Barbanell case, whether there were additional fact witness depositions taken?
A. I asked him to send me, you know, the depositions of- I mean, he described over the phone that Ms. Barbanell had died, she was a decedent. And, so, I said well, you know, is her husband still alive, and he said yes. So send me her husband's_
deposition and any other close family members, you know, people that could report on, essentially, the facts that I just described a moment ago. That is just simply placing her in historical place and historical time.
Q. Besides knowing or learning her age or the time period in which she lived and the locales in which she lived, is there any other information that you're interested in getting in order to form an opinion in the Barbanell case?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, I mean, are you asking me in an open-ended way what aspects of the depositions that I read I found interesting and useful?
MS. BROWN:
Q. Perhaps less interested in what you found interesting and more interested in wanting to know, Professor Kyriakoudes, what information it is you need from those depositions in order to form your opinions .....in this case?..................................................................................
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
Mischaracterizes predicate, but go ahead.
A. The- no. Needs, no. I got everything I needed because what I needed was what I have been describing.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Just the demographic information? A. Yes, historical place, historical time, demographic information.
MS. BROWN:
Q. So you left it up to Mr. Gdanski to identify the fact witness depositions he thought would be useful to you in that respect?
A. Well, he described to me on the phone, as I recall, what depositions were-had been taken. And, of course, there's lots of irrelevant- for my purposes, irrelevant testimony related to medical matters and issues related to her particular medical condition, of course, I have no interest or need to look at.
And, so, in our discussion, I was confident that those three depositions would
be sufficient to provide me what I needed to know.
Q. I n addition to the three depositions, any other materials Mr. Gdanski sent you from the Barbanell case?
A. No. Just that.
Q. So you haven't reviewed the complaint in this case?
A. No, I haven't.
Q. How about any interrogatory responses or discovery responses in the case from plaintiffs, have you reviewed those?
A. I haven't. And he didn't send those to me. In the past I've looked at those as well. But in this one, the depositions were fine and sufficient.
Q. Did you ask him for copies of interrogatories?
A. No.
Q. When did you receive the three depositions that you reviewed?
A. He sent them to me, you know, pretty soon after we had a discussion about what I needed to look at, so some time between Mav and now.
Q. How long did you spend reviewing those depositions?
A. They went pretty quick. I probably spent about two hours total.
Q. Did you take any notes as you reviewed the depositions?
A. No.
Q. Did you highlight the transcript as you were reviewing them?
A. No. They were in computer form.
Q. Did you make any notation in the computer form version of the depositions as you were reviewinq them?
A. No.
Q. Did you review any medical records that have been collected related to Shirley Barbanell?
A. No. As I mentioned a moment ago, that's not anything that I do. I wouldn't be able to interpret those, I'm sure.
Q. You said you didn't review any of the medical testimony. That would include any testimony provided by her treating physician; is that correct?
A. I haven't reviewed anything like_
that, no. Just what I mentioned earlier, being the three depositions from the family members.
Q. Did Mr. Gdanski send you any other material, any memos about the case or any other information about the case?
A. No. He did not.
Q. Was there a cover letter or cover e-mail that accompanied the three deposition transcripts?
A. It was just attached to an e-mail.
I downloaded the transcripts which were in that E-transcript reader, PTXform, and deleted the e-mail.
Q. So you no longer have a copy of that e-mail?
A. I don't.
Q. Do you remember what it said?
A. It didn't say anything. It just had three attachments to it.
Q. Did you do any other research specific to the Barbanell case?
A. Well, I've been reviewing some Florida newspapers which I supplied to Mr.
.....Gdanski recently with the expectation that..............
he would forward that material to you and add to my reliance materials. I don't know if you got that, but it was a small set of Miami Herald stories.
Q. You're referring to the 29 articles and 11 advertisements that you collected from The Miami Herald in the '50s?
A. That's correct.
Q. Did you do that research for the Barbanell case?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, in the Barbanell, would be in the set of- within that set. I mean, that would be relevant to other cases as well, but Barbanell would be in that set, yes.
MS. BROWN:
Q. When did you do that research on The Miami Herald in the '50s?
A. That research, this month, June.
Q. So you did that research after you were contacted by Mr. Gdanski in this case?
A. Yes. That would be true.
Q. Was that research Mr. Gdanski_
asked you to conduct?
A. No.
Q. I n prior testimony you've indicated that you didn't need to look at any Florida newspapers in order to provide opinions in any of the Engle Progeny cases, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. So what's different about the Barbanell case?
A. Well, actually, it's not really the Barbanell case. I'm involved in another case, in which I don't understand all the legal maneuvers, but in which my position that The New York Times, the paper of record, is representative of the national coverage on this issue, has been challenged in some way.
So, basically, I've taken The Miami Herald is the representative paper from Rorida, basically looking at-- looking at the two together. And I was doing that anyway.
And, you know, my- the way I operate on these things- I mean, vou're
focused on the case because you're working on this case and that's what your job is and I understand that. But, for me, you know, my role is broader in terms of subject but also narrower in terms of role. So I simply, you know, add this to my reliance materials.
Q. What cases that you're talking about where your use of just The New York Times as a representative sample of information about smoking and health has been challenged?
A. It was a case in South Florida, the attorney is Gary Page. And I testified in that case, it's called Sherman case,
Sherman versus the R.J. Reynolds Company.
Q. So this is a case that you've already testified at trial in, correct?
A. Right. That case is done. But in my discussions with the plaintiff's attorney, he asked me specifically about South Florida newspapers, and I said well, you know, I can look into that, that's not a problem. So I've been doing that and that's ongoing, actually._
Q. When you say he asked you about South Rorida newspapers, in what way did he ask you? What was he asking you about?
A. Well, he was asking me, you know, basically- you know, in the last case there were lots of challenges on the part of the defense in some capacity. Obviously, I don't know all the details of that, about the use of The New York Times.
And that particular- that particular person had never lived in New York, you know, unlike this case where it's not really an issue in this case, because Ms. Barbanell and Mr. Barbanell are essentially New Yorkers, are New Yorkers.
But he had some cases coming up where there have been people who have never lived in New York and he said, you know- he asked me what was the coverage in South Rorida, and I said well, let me, you know, go and investigate that and I'll report back to you.
Q. So Mr. Page was suggesting to you that perhaps you ought to be looking at .....newspapers t hat t he	.....................
actually had the opportunity to see or read?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, no, that's not really— that's not it. Because, again, I'm not a historian of any particular plaintiff. I'm a historian of the smoke and health debate, the role of the cigarette in the American life, the social history of smoking.
And as I've testified frequently,
I'm still of the opinion that The New York Times is sufficient for my opinions, but, you know, there's lots of judges and, essentially, they may or may not allow me to show The New York Times. It was complicated. I was never there for the business dealings in terms of the procedure of The Court, so I went and looked at the Miami paper.
MS. BROWN:
Q. So Mr. Page was concerned that there would come a point in time where you would not be permitted to use The New York Times to support your opinions in a particular case?_
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
Mischaracterizes testimony.
Mischaracterizes what Gary Page said because he's not here.
A. Yeah. Yeah, really. I mean, why are you asking me about another case?
MS. BROWN:
Q. Well, Professor Kyriakoudes, you have undertaken to review Miami papers when in the past you agree, right, that you testified that it's unnecessary for your opinions that you look at Rorida papers, correct?
A. That's true.
Q. And you've done that because Mr. Page asked you to do that; is that correct?
A. That's correct. He asked me to.
Q. But for Mr. Page asking you to do that, you wouldn't look-- you wouldn't have looked at any Rorida papers in order to give your opinions in the Barbanell case, right?
MR. GDANSKI:
Obiect to the form.
A. That's correct.
MR. GDANSKI:
Impossible to answer.
MS. BROWN:
Apparently not, he just did.
THE WITNESS:
A. Yeah, I mean, there's no mystery here. This is a- as I've said many times, this is a national issue in terms of the national coverage. I think there's sort of a fetish about the newspaper here in this litigation which is bizarre to me as a historian because, you know, there are many other conduits for news, particularly television and radio. But- which I've reviewed extensively.
Yes, so I was- you know, Mr. Rage was interested about- maybe for his own purposes, for me to persuade him. I don't know. You would have to ask him about that.
To the extent that the national news was covered in the Miami paper, I looked at that and was persuaded that, yes, it holds up.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Did Mr. Page suggest to you what_
time periods you should look at in The Miami Herald?
A. No. No. I did not.
Q. And what time periods did you look at for The Miami Herald?
A. Well, in this time period, the bit that you've got was the 1950s.
Q. How did you go about conducting that research?
A. Well, my research question was to what extent was the national news on the debate of smoking and health covered in a newspaper like The Miami Herald, so that was my research question.
Q. And how did you go about answering that question?
A. Well, I took my New York Times news article database that I have, which I provided to you previously, and looked up those stories in the Miami paper.
Q. So, in other words, you would take a New York Times article and, then, go to that same date in The Miami Herald and see if it was there?
..............A......VyejJ-.-date-range...yeah........................................
Q. Did you do that for every New York Times article you have in connecting the health in the 1950s?
A. No. No. I picked from that a representative sample of the most important national news stories.
Q. How did you identify, out of the decade of the 1950s, what the most important national news stories were?
A. Well, there are certain events in the 1950s that are- are critical for understanding the way the smoking and health debate unfolded in the news, and it began with the early Wynder/Graham research as released in the press, both the epidemiological work that they did and, of course, the mouse skin paintings studies follow that through with the coverage of the American Cancer Society study, you know, through- and those events, you know.
It's the- the news on smoking and health is driven by what is new, which is generally two things; one is the research as it's released in the press, and, then, industry responses to that research._
Q. How many articles from The New York Times in the 1950s did you check against The Miami Herald in the 1950s?
A. How many, I would have to- I can't remember. I would have to check for that. But I can get back to you on it. I would just have to check.
Q. Why don't you do that, Professor Kyriakoudes, and if you can provide that information to Mr. Gdanski, he can provide it to us.
A. Yes.
Q. Just so I understand, going back to your opinions in these cases and how you view your role, just to make sure I understand, you view your role as a historian as, I think you said, the national debate on the risks of smoking and a historian of the tobacco industry and the social phenomena of tobacco; is that right, is that how you view your role in these cases?
A. Yes.
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
MS. BROWN:
Q. As you don't view your role as a historian of the information that would have necessarily- or that the smoker in the case would have been exposed to?
A. No. That's- that is subsumed within those three broad categories that we- that you mentioned earlier.
Q. Or they're not subsumed to the extent that a smoker wasn't living in New York for those time periods where you have only reviewed The New York Times, correct? MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, my testimony has been and will continue to be that The New York Times is the paper of record. The New York Times is representative of the kind of information that you find in the press across the country.
I've reviewed many, many newspapers from all over the United States to arrive at that opinion. And what I've looked at in Florida papers is, so far- I mean, has also supported that opinion._
MS. BROWN:
Q. Well, so far you've looked at Florida newspapers, about 29 articles in the 1950s Miami Herald; is that right?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Yeah, which is a representative sample of what appeared in the paper. And again, you said information, so, I mean, information is not just the newspaper.
I mean, that's why I said earlier there's kind of a fetishistic treatment of the newspaper on the defense side of this issue.
I mean, newspapers are important, sure, but people watch TV, they listen to the radio, they see billboards, they see social practice which, you know, I've testified many times is essentially a form of information, a form of getting that so-called public knowledge or public understanding. So there's a lot of things involved.
MS. BROWN:
..............Q......So there are a lot of sources of.................
information, correct?
A. Right. And I've looked at them.
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. And I've looked at those, yes.
MS. BROWN:
Q. And smokers receive information about the dangers of the smoking throughout all kind of vehicles, right?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, I would rephrase that question. Smokers receive information about cigarettes and smoking and tobacco from many different venues.
MS. BROWN:
Q. And included in that would be information about the dangers of smoking, right?
A. That would be a subset within that, yes. But not- not- not- that would not be the unity. That would not be the entire set.
I mean- I mean, it's a very simple way to think of it. There's_
information out there that says don't smoke which is largely coming from the public health community. We're talking 1950s, so we have the specific time. And, then, there's information saying go ahead and smoke, which is coming from all kinds of sources and in all kinds of forms.
Q. Professor Kyriakoudes, you're not suggesting that the only source of information that encouraged people not to smoke was coming from the public health community in the 1950s, are you?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, in terms of-- I mean, it's the public health community that is developing, and I mean that fairly broadly, in developing the science, for example, that begins to implicate smoking with lung cancer and other diseases. So that, in essence, is the source of it.
MS. BROWN:
Q. That's one source of it, Professor Kyriakoudes, but you've also testified that there are other sources of information
including family members. Family members provide information to smokers about the dangers of smoking, right?
MR. GDANSKI:
Objection to form.
A. Yes. I guess we're really talking about- we're talking past each other and talking about two different things. When I was discussing this I was mentioning, you know, the idea of coming up with new information which can permeate through society in a variety of different ways.
But, you know, the source of new information about the link between smoking and disease is coming from the people that are doing the research as they report the results and that is picked up in a variety of media venues and, then, of course, can be discussed amongst individuals. It's a complex process.
So, yes, I don't think we're-there's a disagreement there. We're just— that's how I was referring to that earlier.
MS. BROWN:
Q. So it's not just newspapers that_
provide a conduit for that information; we agree on that, right?
A. Yes. That's correct.
Q. And you've mentioned television is a source of that information, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Radio has provided- has been a source of information about cigarettes including the dangers of smoking, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Information- well, again, you know, you want to limit it to just to the dangers, but radio and television in the '50s also- they say a lot of things about smoking because, you know, there's plenty of advertising and that's information about smoking as well.
So, yes, just to be clear, that is a subset of the information about smoking.
The health information is, in my opinion, a rather small subset of the entire stream of information about tobacco in the cigarette.
MS. BROWN:
..............Q......But to be clear, radio did provide................
or did serve as a conduit of information about the dangers of smoking, correct?
A. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Q. And schools and textbooks also served as a conduit of information about the dangers of smoking, correct?
A. Well, again, I would- you know, you want to say dangers, that's just too broad, you know. My- my testimony is very specific and you have to be very careful when dealing with historical matters where you are in historical time.
So I don't like the question because of the breadth of it but I will agree that tobacco is discussed in schools and, you know, the school environment involves many facets of information transmission. There may be a discussion of it in the class, maybe a health class, maybe a textbook or something like that; maybe, maybe not.
You have to be very sensitive to what it actually says. But, of course, the social practice is important, too. The action of- in this case, let's just choose_
high school teenagers and whether they smoke or not, is also information.
Q. But to go back to my question, my question was schools, classes such as health classes that you mentioned and textbooks have served as a conduit of information about the dangers of smoking?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Yes. But keep in mind my important caveat about being precise, about what is actually discussed.
MS. BROWN:
Q. For example, you've seen textbooks that discuss the fact that nicotine is a poison, correct?
A. Yes. You know, right. And that's actually a really good example. Because the discussion that nicotine is a poison in a textbook and, then, the practice of a student going out and getting other information from watching people smoke and observing that nobody falls down dead after smoking that one cigarette sort of undermines that first message. So that's an
example of how you have to be careful and precise. That's just-- you've got to be very careful.
Q. You've also seen information provided in textbooks as far back as the 1950s that cigarette smoking has been shown to shorten one's life, correct?
A. Yes. Sometimes you see that discussed, that's true.
Q. So that would be a danger of smoking, correct?
A. That's true, yes.
Q. We talked about newspapers and radio and television and school classes and textbooks, family members, these are all conduits of information related to the dangers of smoking, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, the conduits of information of which the dangers of smoking would be one type of information that could be transmitted, but certainly not the only type of information.
MS BROWN:_
Q. And, also, public health organizations like the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, American Heart Association, those are organizations that have also served as a conduit of information to the public about the dangers of smoking, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Yes. I mean, you've got- again, you've got to be precise about this. They-I mean, they generate- they create new knowledge, you know. They support researchers and deal with the researchers. They issue- you know, they speak to the media, print electronic media. Does that make them a conduit? Maybe I'm over-thinking the language here too much.
But as I said at the beginning of this line of questioning, certainly the public health community is important.
MS. BROWN:
Q. And the public health organizations like the American Heart .....Association, the American Lung Association........
American Cancer Society, they also communicated directly to the public through things like pamphlets and posters, right?
A. Yes. That would be where they were being a conduit, yes.
Q. And they communicated through the public through public service announcements on television and radio, correct?
A. Yes, especially in the '60s, that's true. Of course, the tobacco industry is a conduit for information about cigarettes as well, you would agree with that?
Q. That's the thing about a deposition, Dr. Kyriakoudes, I get to ask the questions.
I'm going to show you- let's get this marked. I'm going to show you what we're going to mark as Exhibit 1 to the deposition.
(Exhibit 1 was marked.)
MR. GDANSKI:
What is it?
MS. BROWN:
_This is Plaintiffs' Notice of_
Rling Expert Witness List with the expert witness list attached, dated December 5th, 2008.
Q. Did I identify that correctly, Dr. Kyriakoudes?
A. Yes. Yes, you did, yes.
Q. If you could flip with me, Dr. Kyriakoudes- the pages aren't numbered but the experts are actually listed in alphabetical order, if you could find your name?
A. I see it.
Q. So as of December 5th, 2008, you had not talked to Mr. Gdanski or anyone at the Schlesinger firm about serving as an expert in the Barbanell case; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. On this expert list you are listed, Louis Kyriakoudes, Ph.D., correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Have you seen this disclosure before?
A. No. I haven't seen this.
Q. After your name is a couple of
paragraphs or a paragraph that describes the testimony you will give in this case, right?
A. Yes. That's what it looks like.
Q. And you didn't have any input into what areas of testimony are disclosed in this document, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. In this particular- I've never seen this particular document before.
MS. BROWN:
Q. And it also indicates that you're going to be testifying, the opinion type, it says generic, correct, under your name?
A. That's what it says.
Q. Now I'm going to hand you, Doctor, what we're going to mark as Exhibit Number
2,	and this is Plaintiff's Amended Expert Witness Disclosure pertaining to Dr.
Kyriakoudes only.
MR. GDANSKI:
Just so we're clear, what case is
that?
MS. BROWN:
_This case, the Barbanell case._
(Exhibit 2 was marked.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. Professor Kyriakoudes, can you tell me if you've seen this document before?
A. No. Although it looks very similar to the other one as review the- I would have to compare to see the differences. But, no, I haven't seen this.
Q. Did Mr. Gdanski tell you that he was filing an amended expert witness disclosure pertaining to you?
A. He may have in a phone conversation. That's not something I concern myself with. That's a procedural issue that is a lawyer thing, not a historian thing. If he did tell me I don't recall either way.
Q. And this time, Professor Kyriakoudes, after your name and your business address it says subject matter, history/demography, correct?
A. Correct. That's what it says.
Q. No indication here limiting you to generic testimony, right?
.....MR GDANSKI:............................................................................
Object to the form.
A. When you say limiting, you mean limiting? I guess that's a legal term, limiting?
MS. BROWN:
Q. Do you see any reference here to the fact that you will be providing generic testimony as you did in the last disclosure? MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. You know, you're asking me about documents that pertain to the procedures of the court for which I have neither the interest, nor expertise, nor training to evaluate.
I mean, all I can say is as I read this it seems to read very similar to the other one; although if you want me to compare them word by word, I'll happily do that.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Why don't you do that, Professor Kyriakoudes. Why don't you lay them side by side and tell me if the Plaintiff's Amended Expert Witness Disclosure pertaining to Dr.
Kyriakoudes only has a line that says opinion type, generic, as the original disclosure did?
A. Oh, I see, okay. So you're asking me a more narrow question there. I don't-that language doesn't appear in this second document, but, of course, you could read it and ascertain that yourself. Why you're asking me about this -MR. GDANSKI:
I'm not sure what that question
means.
MS. BROWN:
Q. It's a simple question and there's no trick involved. Dr. Kyriakoudes, does the amended disclosure say opinion type, generic?
MR. GDANSKI:
Okay. If that's the question, if it says that on the document, then that's a simple and straightforward question.
A. In Deposition Exhibit Number 2, the language opinion type, colon, generic, does not appear.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Thank you. Doctor, as you read the disclosure, the amended disclosure, the paragraph that purports to set out the opinions that you'll provide in this case -A. Yeah, I'll read it.
MS. BROWN:
We're going to go off the record a
second.
(Off the record.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. Professor Kyriakoudes, you were comparing the amended disclosure to the first disclosure in the case when we took a break, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. And there are differences between the two disclosures, correct?
A. Yeah, a little bit.
Q. For example, in the paragraph that purports to set out your opinions in this case, about the third or fourth opinion in the amended disclosure says that you will testify as to public knowledge in the communities where Shirley-- Shirley Barbanell lived, correct?_
A. Yes.
Q. That was not in the original disclosure, correct?
A. Well, I mean, she- the first one is for a broad, large number of cases.
Q. The first one is generic, right?
A. Yes. It's generic.
Q. And, then, if you turn to the next page of the amended disclosure, it says that "Dr. Kyriakoudes will be generally familiar with the smoker's residency history and smoking history".
Did I read that correctly?
A. Yes.
Q. And, again, that's not a sentence that appeared in the first disclosure, correct?
A. Right, for obvious reasons.
Q. Because, again, the first disclosure is generic and this one is more specific to Shirley Barbanell, correct?
A. That would- that would be correct.
Q. Just to be clear, at the point in .....time that the first disclosure was served.................
you had not done or weren't even aware of the Barbanell case, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Let me restate that. You had not done any research specific to nor were even aware of the Shirley Barbanell case, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. When Jonathan Gdanski contacted you in May, did he tell you that he wanted you to look at the depositions in this case?
A. I brought it up. I said tell me about the smoking history and, you know, where in historical time and states and place did the smoking victim live and, you know, what are those circumstances.
And as I said earlier, he explained it to me, and I said well, you know, send me these family member depositions. We, in our conversation, discussed that I'll review them for those issues.
Q. Did you prepare a report for the Barbanell case?
A. No._
Q. Have you taken any notes or drafted any memos to yourself or for Mr. Gdanski that set out any thoughts or opinions you have related to the Barbanell case specifically?
A. No. We just talked on the phone.
Q. How many times have you talked on the phone with Mr. Gdanski?
A. Including this morning, probably five or six times.
Q. We know you talked to Mr. Gdanski in May when he first contacted you, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you recall when the next call with Mr. Gdanski was?
MR. GDANSKI:
Don't guess. I don't think they want you to guess. I don't want you to guess.
A. I can't recall. I'm busy.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Do you keep notes as far as a record of the time that you're spending on the case, including phone calls with Mr. Gdanski or other plaintiff's counsel?
A. No. I don't keep that. That would be burdensome.
Q. So how do you know what to bill Mr. Gdanski and his firm for the work that you do in the Barbanell case?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, I may not be as obsessed with the hourly rate as an attorney in a large firm that has layers of management over them. I pretty much-- you know, the short conversations that I have with attorneys don't- I don't keep track of that.
You know, I asked for a retainer and Mr. Gdanski sent me a retainer for his set of cases and that pretty much covers, in my mind, the work I'll do leading up to the case.
Now, I'll go to Florida to testify in the case so I'll be in Florida about a day, a few days, I don't know, whatever that is. I'll add that up and that's what the bill will be.
MS. BROWN:_
Q. What was the retainer that you charged Mr. Gdanski?
A. $3,500.
Q. Is that an increase in the retainer that you have previously charged plaintiff's counsel?
A. I ncrease of $300.
Q. What accounts for the increase?
A. Just wanted - I'm getting a lot of calls and high demand and I'm kind of limiting what I- what I do, so I thought I would raise it a little bit.
Q. Have you found that raising it by $300 is limiting the amount of work that you're doing for plaintiff's counsel?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. You mean in terms of people calling me, I don't know. I haven't thought about that. I'm not sure.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Has anyone balked at paying your $3,500 retainer fee?
MR. GDANSKI:
.......................Object to the form...............................................
A. I think so, yeah.
MS. BROWN:
Q. So there are certain plaintiffs law firms who have not retained you because of the $3,500 retainer fee?
A. You said plaintiffs? You just want to stick to plaintiffs? No, I don't think any plaintiffs have balked. Other law firms have.
Q. You've been contacted by law firms outside of tobacco litigation?
A. Well, when you say tobacco litigation, I'll define that to mean in which a tobacco manufacturer is a direct party to the lawsuit, yes.
Q. But within tobacco litigation in cases where a tobacco manufacturer or cigarette manufacturer is a party to a lawsuit, your $3,500 retainer has not been objected to by any of the law firms that have contacted you?
A. Not yet, no.
Q. When did you increase your retainer fee?
A. I think when-when I was talking_
to Jonathan Gdanski.
Q. So the Schlesinger firm was the first one to pay $3,500 versus a $3,200 retainer fee?
A. I think so, yes.
Q. Have you been retained by other law firms since your conversation with Mr. Gdanski in May?
A. I've talked with- yeah, I've talked with a number of firms, that's true.
Q. Have you been retained by any other firms?
MR. GDANSKI:
I don't know if that's privileged information. I don't know if they disclosed him as expert in the cases. I don't know if he can answer, quite frankly.
But to the extent that you've been retained to perform services not disclosed as an expert in any case, I don't think you should answer that question.
MS. BROWN:
Q. So have you been contacted and retained by any law firms in which you have been disclosed as an expert since vou talked
to Mr. Gdanski?
A. I think from having read my prior testimony in depositions you're probably pretty familiar with the situation in which I've testified numerous times. I don't really keep up with whether I've been disclosed or not in any particular case.
Again, that's not information that's important to me. It is to you because you're an attorney and I understand that. But it's not something that I keep up with, so I couldn't- I couldn't answer that question.
Q. And again, you don't charge a retainer fee for a law firm to list you if they plan on using your videotape; is that correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form. Asked and answered, as implied by your question.
A. That's right. And you asked me that question earlier and my answer is the same. That tape is out there.
MS. BROWN:
Q. How many Engle Progeny cases-_
and, first, when I say Engle Progeny case, you know what I'm talking about, correct?
A. I do.
Q. That's a term you're familiar with?
A. Yes. That is what I'm familiar with.
Q. How many Engle Progeny cases have you been contacted or disclosed to provide live testimony in?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form. Compound.
I'm not sure what you mean by contacted and/or disclosed. Is it contacted him?
Because if it's contacted and not disclosed,
I would instruct him not to answer.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Let me rephrase. Dr. Kyriakoudes, how many Engle Progeny cases have you been contacted and disclosed in for purposes of providing live testimony at trial?
MR. GDANSKI:
Are you including prior testimony or going forward?
.....MS. BROWN:.................................................................................
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you can answer it either way and we'll clarify whatever your answer is.
A. I'll interpret your question to mean where I've not yet actually testified because the case has not been held, or in one case it was mis-tried.
Q. So you're going to exclude Hess and Sherman and those cases where you've already testified at trial, correct?
A. Right. Kaplan.
Q. So Kaplan mis-tried, right?
A. That's right. But I'm assuming-although I don't know for sure, but I'm assuming that they will probably reschedule it. You probably know about that more than I do.
Q. I may.
MR. GDANSKI:
I don't.
A. The two cases with Mr. Gdanski-and I've talked with- I mean, there's other cases of people that I've talked to- here's the problem with the question, in terms of my- there's nothing wrong with the_
question, but my ability to give you an answer.
You're asking-- asking me for information that I actually don't keep track of because, you know, from my perspective, I get all this- if people call me I talk to them on the phone, you know, I never hear from them again.
It only becomes real to me when someone says okay, this trial has been scheduled and, you know, there's going to be- can you give me a date for a deposition, you know, in- in the next month, you know, four weeks from now. And, then, it becomes real to me in the sense that okay, I think about it and do something for it. And that's how I manage- manage this.
Because, to be honest with you, if I kept up with every little thing that ever crossed my desk or my gaze or came through my telephone, I would go crazy. I mean, it's a lot of, to me, background noise and chatter.
So, for me, as I sit here, I know
that I've got scheduled, and I'll include Kaplan in there, because my understanding is they were going to ask for that to be rescheduled at some point, the Kaplan case, the Barbanell case, the Grossman case and the Campbell case in Pensacola coming up.
There may be others. I have talked with many, many attorneys. But those are the ones that, for me, right now, are-are within my gaze and for which I'm working on.
MS. BROWN:
Q. You said you have a deposition coming up next week. Is it one of those cases you have a deposition coming up in?
A. Yeah. That one has just been scheduled and I can't recall the details of that. Once again, see, it's- I have to follow up on that.
Q. That's a case, though, in addition to the ones that you just listed?
A. Yes. Right. That would be in addition to that, but I can't recall the name of it at this point. I would have to check, you know. In the few days between
now and then I'll, you know, get up to speed and do that.
Q. Do you have materials to review in that case, depositions and case materials?
A. I do. I have not yet reviewed those. I will do that this weekend. That-that was- that's also, I believe, with the Searcy law firm.
Q. The Campbell case that you mentioned in Pensacola, is that a case where you have reviewed plaintiff's materials, depositions and discovery responses?
A. Yes. And I was deposed in that case back in May in Atlanta.
Q. Then, obviously, we've been talking about Barbanell and Grossman. How about the Kaplan case, is that a case where you reviewed depositions of the fact witnesses?
A. Yes, much like I've done in this case. I was deposed in that case as well earlier this spring.
Q. Originally, your retainer was $3,200 and that represented eight hours of ■■■■M?Jk!,,correct?.............................................................................
A. That's right.
Q. Does the fact that you have increased your retainer to $3,500 indicate that your hourly fee has gone up?
A. No, it doesn't.
Q. So you're still charging $400 an hour?
A. That's correct.
Q. Does the $3,500 retainer, do you credit that to the first eight hours of work?
A. Yes. That will pretty much cover everything until I go to Florida, you know, to do the testimony.
Q. I n the four or five telephone conversations you've had with Mr. Gdanski, how long would each of those calls have been?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, I can tell you that this morning I got in the car to drive here at 8:35 and I called Mr. Gdanski, and we spoke,
I think, until nine o'clock, because I was on the phone when I walked in the lobby and
met the other attorney that's accompanying you here today. About 25 minutes. So I can tell you that conversation, for sure, 25 minutes long. The others, I don't remember. MS. BROWN:
Q. Do you recall any conversation with Mr. Gdanski that went on for an hour or all afternoon?
A. No, nothing-- no. It was nothing long like that, no.
Q. What kind of preparation did you do for your deposition today?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. I reviewed the- I read the- the depositions that we discussed earlier.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Did you review any other documents in preparation for your deposition today?
A. No.
Q. Other than your conversation with Mr. Gdanski this morning, any of your other conversations have to do with preparing for your deposition today?
MR. GDANSKI:
Can you repeat the question? I didn't hear it.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Other than your conversation with Mr. Gdanski this morning, any of the other phone calls with Mr. Gdanski meant to prepare you for your deposition today?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. No. We- prior to this, the only discussion of the deposition concerned scheduling.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Just to be clear, I think I understand that you have not sent a bill to Mr. Gdanski related to any work you've done in this case other than your retainer, charging him for your retainer?
A. That's correct. Yes.
Q. And, at this point, you don't have an intent to generate a bill prior to your preparation for trial immediately prior to taking the stand; is that correct?
A. That's correct. As I said earlier, trial is in a month, and at the end_
of the trial, you know, I'll basically add up how many days I was in Rorida, you know. That's pretty much how I do it.
Q. Any other research you intend to perform before testifying in the Barbanell case?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, I'm continuing my newspaper review that we talked about earlier; that's ongoing.
MS. BROWN:
Q. That's your newspaper review of The Miami Herald?
A. That's correct. The other thing I'm doing is- I wouldn't call this new research, but when I supplied my reliance materials, I included, also, a list of, like, other materials for which I don't have actual copies of the documents.
And I'm going back and, basically, recreating my set of news- I'm sorry, news magazine articles from the '50s and '60s and some from the '70s.
......................But I used to have inthese large....................
copy boxes, I had the paper and I lost those. They were destroyed. So I'm recreating- recreating that. But the articles are listed on that document.
Q. How are you conducting your ongoing research in The Herald?
A. I'm hiring students and research assistants to help with that.
Q. What are you having them do?
A. What I described earlier, I'm giving them a list of New York Times stories from my files, which I've disclosed to you many times, and asking them the question do these types of stories appear in that paper and, also, I ask them to give me some sense as to the advertising environment in the papers.
Q. When you say you asked them to give you some sense of the advertising, what is it that you're- how do they convey that sense of the advertising to you?
A. Okay. I told them, specifically, to- you know, I've reviewed thousands and thousands of advertising, print advertising messages from this time period; I mean,_
thousands; many hundreds are included in my reliance documents.
So I just told them, you know, to-- you know, if they happenstance upon a couple of interesting ads, just include those as kind of a lagniappe, a local word.
Q. I spent some time in New Orleans;
I'm familiar with that word.
A. Good. And those were included in your list. I think maybe- I forget the exact number, but there's just a small number of ads included in that set of documents I sent to you, maybe ten.
Q. What time periods do you have your students looking at in The Miami Herald?
A. My research assistant-assistants, I started them in the '50s and I have them moving forward.
Q. The articles and advertisements that you provided as your supplement in this case, were those materials collected by your research assistants?
A. Yes.
Q. Have you considered just having vour research assistant do a comprehensive
review of The Miami Herald for articles related to cigarettes and smoking and health?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. I don't need for them to do that.
You know, my research question is- is different. I'm not interested in a comprehensive review of what's in The Miami Herald because there's lots of information that I've reviewed over the years in my research.
What I have them doing is something more focused, as I described earlier.
MS. BROWN:
Q. But you've never, yourself, undertaken any kind of a comprehensive review of The Miami Herald, correct?
A. No.
Q. So you don't really know what kind of coverage there is in The Miami Herald of smoking and health issues, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
_Object to the form._
A. No. That's incorrect. My interest is- I mean, that might be important to you for your expert. My interest is in looking at the way that national news is disseminated and reflected in this particular local paper.
MS. BROWN:
Q. It's not of interest to you, for example, if a doctor's column regularly ran information- a local doctor's column regularly ran information related to the dangers of smoking?
A. Again, this is a case where a local doctor's column appears in papers nationally across the country in all kinds of different venues, big city papers, small city papers. The doctors may be different; they may or may not be different, but the genre of the local medical column is there and they're all pretty much saying the same thing, from my experience.
Q. And that is that cigarette smoking poses health consequences, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
.......................Object to the form................................................
A. In medical columns, that tends to be the message, particularly as you move on in time. I mean, you know, you've got to be- you've got to be sensitive to time, certainly by the 1960s and certainly after the Surgeon General's report comes out.
That's very much the case, yes.
MS. BROWN:
Q. So you're not having your research assistant look to see if those- if that information is present in The Miami Herald; you're willing to assume that that information is in The Miami Herald, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, I'm not assuming either.
It's just what I'm saying is that in researching many newspapers, I have found that the genre piece of the local doctor's column is a constant. It's not particularly relevant to my opinion either way.
MS. BROWN:
Q. And, again, you're not having every article that you found in The New York Times checked against The Miami Herald,_
correct?
A. Well, no. I-what I did was choose what I thought worthy, you know, the ones that were of national significance. I mean, I've collected lots of stories. I don't know if you've reviewed my reliance set or not, but say just for the 1950s, I mean, there's a large number of stories from The New York Times and other papers I've collected.
You know, for example, I didn't ask them to look up a story on the implementation of ashtrays at New York City bus stops. But, again, as I said earlier, stories that deal with the emerging of science on the national report, the way I described it earlier in the deposition today.
Q. I assume, Dr. Kyriakoudes, that your collection of The New York Times contains the stories that you're mentioning, these very big stories from Wynder and Graham and reports on the big research studies that were coming out, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you just mentioned that your New York Times collection also include what you consider smaller, perhaps irrelevant, stories such as the New York bus station getting ashtrays, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. I assume there's also stories in between, correct, stories reporting to the public that there are dangers associated with cigarette smoking but perhaps are not the big flagship study on the Wynder and Graham study or the Doll and Hill study.
There are other articles, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Give me an example.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Well, I don't have your New York Times collection here, but your New York Times collection, I would assume-- I think you testified before that there are a thousand stories in The New York Times related to smoking and health between the 1920s and the 1950s, correct?
A. There's a large number, veah. I_
mean, particularly in the '50s and '60s, there's a very large number of stories.
Yeah, it's a big- it's a big story.
Q. So are you having a thousand articles from The New York Times checked against The Miami Herald?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form. Asked and answered.
A. No. No. I chose, again, as I said, the ones that I thought were the most significant in my judgement.
MS. BROWN:
Q. So at the end of this research process, how will you have a feel for whether The Miami Herald ran a large volume of stories related to cigarette smoking and health or a few that match up with The New York Times stories that you're checking?
A. Again, I mean, you're asking a different research question which I'm not asking, so I'm actually not going to give an answer to that.
I mean, I'm not going to raise .....thatissuebecause,aqain,myint^	...............
been in simply asking the question to what extent, you know, the major milestones in the smoke and health debate in the '50s and '60s, in this case, covered in these regional papers.
Q. Again, you can't tell me today how many of those New York Times articles you're actually checking against The Miami Herald, correct?
A. You mean how many I talked with my research assistant about? It's- for the 1950s, it's probably- it's about 36, maybe three dozen, rough- rough estimate there.
Q. But, again, limiting yourself to articles that discuss the health consequences or the health risks of cigarette smoking, you would agree that there are far more than 36 of those articles in The New York Times in the 1950s?
A. Sure. You know, yes, that's true.
Q. So there are a lot of articles from The New York Times in the 1950s that you have not asked your research assistant-assistants to see if those articles are in The Miami Herald, correct?_
A. That's correct.
MR. GDANSKI:
Asked and answered.
THE WITNESS:
Just as you don't have to ask every single American when you do a public opinion poll, you know, what they think about a particular issue. This is a case of sampling; not random, but it is a form of sampling.
MS. BROWN:
Q. How did you arrive at the number 36 as having a statistical significance for the comparison between The New York Times and The Miami Herald?
A. I didn't. You asked me for a rough guesstimate. When I checked my-- when I go back and look at my New York Times file, I'll be able to tell you more precise.
And I'll give you the- I'll give you the stories, too. There's no- there's no mystery there.
Q. Please do. I'd appreciate it if you could produce those to Mr. Gdanski and he'll produce them to us.
MR. GDANSKI:
Produce what?
MS. BROWN:
The articles from The New York Times he's identified for checking against The Miami Herald.
MR. GDANSKI:
Okay.
MS. BROWN:
Q. And the reason I asked you about whether you've determined that's a statistically significant sample is you raised the issue of sampling, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. But it hasn't been your goal in identifying in The New York Times articles to identify statistically relevant samples in New York Times articles to check against The Miami Herald, correct?
A. Yes. You're mixing- I mean, you're mixing apples and oranges here. There's not- this is a case where a random sample as determined by normal statistical procedures would not be a suitable tool, because, you know, we're not dealing with-
each of the individual stories have different weights in terms of the importance. So it's just not- we're not dealing here with quantitative in an analytical method; we're dealing here with quality in an analytical method.
Q. When you reviewed The New York Times, you also, I assume, located advertisements for smoking cessation programs?
A. Yes.
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
THE WITNESS:
Those were products- programs and products. Yeah, those appear.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Did you collect those from The New York Times? Is that part of your New York Times collection?
A. Did I collect them in The New York Times, I'm sure there's a few in there. I-you know, I think some of the- it's certainly in my set of newspaper reliance .....documents, things like Bantron. programs..............
like that, stories about quit smoking programs. Yeah, they're in there.
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to that line of questioning as to what's in The New York Times which have already been provided to defendants.
And defendants were made aware that Dr. Kyriakoudes is relying upon those documents in this deposition as well even though they're not being supplied at the time.
MS. BROWN:
Jonathan, just to clarify, I assume that you're not objecting to my asking Dr. Kyriakoudes about the reliance materials you have identified as being reliance materials in this case, right?
MR. GDANSKI:
No, no, I'm not. I'm not. Again,
I have no objections to you asking questions about it, just to identify specific ones, whether they were included when you have the list- have the actual documents. You can ask him questions about it.
MS. BROWN:
_Well, we can probably all agree_
that Dr. Kyriakoudes probably does know his reliance materials better than I do.
MR. GDANSKI:
I don't know. I would hope so.
MS. BROWN:
Let's hope so.
MR. GDANSKI:
There are some Chicago lawyers out there who probably know it as well as Dr. Kyriakoudes.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Professor Kyriakoudes, in what you're identifying The Miami Herald, have you asked your research assistants to look for any articles related to smoking cessation?
A. No. I was looking for news stories as I described earlier.
Q. And, so, you also haven't asked your research assistants to look for any stories in the '50s that reference cigarette smoking as a habit, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. You know, as I sit here and think
about the newspaper stories that I've read from this time period, I don't-- I don't think I can think of one newspaper story of everything that I've read where the principal focus of the story in the 1950s was on cigarettes as a habit.
Now, magazine articles, it does come up more in those. But I think maybe it's the nature of what editors include in the newspaper in terms of the new cycle and what's defined more as more immediate news versus what you might think of in the future, which is more suitable to the magazine format.
There's just not a lot of discussion of habit in the '50s in the newspaper materials that I've looked at.
There is some in the magazines.
MS. BROWN:
Q. But it's not your testimony that there is no discussion of the habit-forming nature of cigarettes or the addictive nature of cigarettes or difficulty in quitting in newspaper articles in the 1950s, correct?
A. Well, now you've taken a word and
now you've stretched it so far. I mean, that's a good question to object to as overly broad. You're asking me a completely different question.
Q. Okay. Well, answer that one then.
A. Yeah. I mean, in the press, generally, some- particularly- let me rephrase that. Those issues are discussed, yes. They tend not to be the dominant focus but you can find them here and there.
At least in terms of the news, the principal focus of the 1950s is on lung cancer. That's - that's the negative health consequence of smoking that gets the most press attention. Then later, other-other diseases get folded into that. But lung cancer is the principal item in the news.
Q. So in identifying those principal New York Times articles that you then want your research assistants to look for in The Miami Herald, you are focused exclusively on lung cancer; would that be fair?
MR. GDANSKI:
......................Object to the form.................................................
A. No. No. Just on the major milestones of the smoking and health debate I described earlier.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Any of those New York Times articles that you're looking for in The Miami Herald discuss emphysema as a health risk of cigarette smoking?
A. Emphysema is not so much in the '50s; later- later period, yes.
Q. But going back to my question, of The New York Times articles that you've identified in the '50s and had your research assistants look for, any of those key articles discuss emphysema as a health consequence for smoking?
A. They may. I would have to refresh my recollection. Again, what I can characterize this is that as a rule of the 1950s most stories are about lung cancer.
Then, as you move forward in time, the press begins to discuss other health conditions.
Q. And for sure of the 36 articles that you've identified -
A. Keep in mind, I was giving you a_
ballpark number. When I refresh my recollection or when I send the document, you can know the exact- exact number that I sent to my assistant.
Q. Well, I assume when you picked 36, you think that's maybe not exact, but that is in the ballpark, correct?
A. That's what I think as I sit here, but I would have to double-check, you know, to refresh exactly the number.
Q. And, again, because I don't think, actually, I got an answer to this question earlier, as far as what your research assistants are looking for in The Miami Herald, you haven't asked them to look for articles in The Miami Herald that discuss cigarette smoking as either a habit or an addiction or as being difficult to quit?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. I mean, often you see the language that the cigarette habit is discussed in these stories, so that language is in there. Does the word addiction- I cannot- as I sit here and work from memory, I can't
recall that that is significant- a significant part of the discussion, that particular language.
The phrase "difficult to quit", that exact language, I don't think I've seen that in the materials that I've reviewed.
But the term "habit" has appeared and that is- that is discussed. So I'm just being-I'm breaking down your three-part question into those three parts.
MS. BROWN:
Q. And your research assistants who are looking at The Miami Herald, have you asked them to look for stories that discuss cigarette smoking as a habit?
A. Well, the correct answer would be of the set of materials that I sent to them, the dates and The New York Times descriptors of the stories, as I sit here and recall,
I'm pretty sure that habit is discussed in some of those stories, yes.
Q. As you sit here, any of those stories that you've identified from The New York Times in the 1950s that you're now checking against The Herald, any of those_
stories focused on the issue of the habit-forming nature of cigarettes or the addictiveness of cigarettes or difficulty in quitting cigarette smoking?
A. Well, yes. I mean, there are stories that refer to the cigarette habit, yes. Yes, some are.
Q. Can you identify for me a story that you're- are you thinking of one, in particular, that you've identified from The New York Times that you're asking your research assistants to look for in The Miami Herald that address those topics?
A. I'm not thinking of a particular story, but I'm- as I recall, the discussion in the paper, in that particular paper, New York Times, I mean, the cigarette habit is discussed, yeah.
Q. So far you have produced to us 29 articles from the 1950s Miami Herald. Do you expect to have additional stories from the 1950s from The Miami Herald in your research?
A. I believe the last date, somewhere .....around 1957. '58. of those, and, you know.........
they're just working their way forward.
Q. So you might have some articles from 1959 that you're going to identify in The Miami Herald, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. After you complete the 1950s, is it your intent to move to the next decade?
A. Yes. You know, that's what I said, ongoing. Yes, I included that.
As you're pausing, kind of an off-the-record thing -
(Off the record.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. If we can mark this as next exhibit.
MR. GDANSKI:
Did you receive our objection?
MS. BROWN:
I did.
(Exhibit 3 was marked.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I'm handing you Notice of Taking Deposition. I have to tell you that I meant to hand you the amended one that has today's date and time on it and I_
see that I brought the wrong one. But as far as the Exhibit A, which is really what I want to talk about, they're identical between the two notices, okay?
A. Yes. That's fine.
MS. BROWN:
Sorry about that, Jonathan.
MR. GDANSKI:
No problem. They're the same.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, did you bring any- first of all, let me ask you, have you seen Exhibit A before?
A. Yes. I've seen this.
Q. Mr. Gdanski provided you a copy of this?
A. That's right.
Q. Did you talk with Mr. Gdanski about the items that were requested?
A. Yes. We reviewed it.
Q. Did you bring any documents today that are responsive to Exhibit A?
MR. GDANSKI:
I'll just interpose an objection to the extent that we filed an objection to
Exhibit- or Schedule A attached to the notice and Dr. Kyriakoudes is not going to bring anything that we objected to.
But go ahead, Dr. Kyriakoudes.
A. I brought my CV.
MS. BROWN:
Just to make sure we keep track of everything, we can mark Dr. Kyriakoudes' CV as the next exhibit in order to the deposition.
(Exhibit 4 was marked.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. Let's run through some of the items on Exhibit A. I think you told us that- let's go to Number 2. You told us that you don't have any summary or support of your opinions in the Barbanell case; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Number 3 asked for you to produce a complete file or your complete file related to the Barbanell case. And you didn't bring any materials related to your Barbanell file?
A. I don't have anything responsive_
to that item.
Q. You do have copies of the depositions, at least in electronic form, correct?
A. That's correct. But I identified those to you.
MR. GDANSKI:
Again, I'll just, for the record, let it be known that we, I believe, have an agreement in this case not to produce medical records in depositions.
MS. BROWN:
Right.
Q. And just to clarify, as long as they're not altered and you've not made any alterations to the deposition transcripts that you've reviewed, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Number 4, you do not have any notes you've created in connection with the Barbanell case; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Number 5, has the Schlesinger law firm provided you any other depositions from .....any other case or any other witness for vour........
preparation of the Barbanell case?
A. No. No. I mean, I've gotten some depositions for the Grossman case but that's the Grossman case. But, no, just the ones that I have- the depositions that we discussed earlier.
Q. So, for example, you haven't been provided the deposition of defendant's historian in the Barbanell case, would that be correct?
A. That's correct, I haven't. I don't know who's doing that.
Q. So it's Fay Barbanell, Leon Barbanell and Karen Schlesinger; that's the totality-MR. GDANSKI:
Karen Segal.
MS. BROWN:
Q. I'm sorry, Karen Segal. That's the totality of depositions you've received in this case?
A. That's correct.
Q. Number 7, you have not generated an invoice related to your work in the Barbanell case: is that correct?_
A. That's right. I just did that over the phone in relation to the retainer.
Q. In Number 10, a copy of any notes, comments or correspondence related to your article, "Historians' Testimony on 'Common Knowledge' of the Risks of Tobacco Use..." that was published in Tobacco Control, 2006. Have you provided those materials in prior depositions?
A. No. I have not.
Q. Do you have any of those materials? Do you have any notes, comments or correspondence related to that article for peer reviewers or editors?
A. As I've testified, the peer reviewers, no, I don't have any documents related to that. It's done completely through the website.
Q. So at no point did you download any of that information and save it on a hard drive or disc or print it out in any way?
A. No. It wasn't very much. I just read it on the website.
Q. Number 11, any materials,
including lecture notes, handouts or PowerPoint slides relating to your lecture on "The American Origins of the Global Tobacco Epidemic"?
A. I supplied this probably five or six times since September.
Q. In addition- I'm sorry.
A. I mean, I've given you my PowerPoints and these are included in my reliance set. So if you need another copy, if you misplaced it, which I doubt, I can get you my PowerPoints. But you have- your firm, or Bacon in particular, and as well as the Jones Day law firm have gotten these multiple times in both paper and electronic form.
Q. In addition to the PowerPoint slides that you have provided in the past, you don't have any lecture notes or handouts related to that presentation?
A. That are new?
Q. Right, or that you have not produced in prior depositions?
A. No. I've given- I mean, I've given you all of my PowerPoints from my_
public talks, that's right.
Q. You're currently working on an article called Envisioning the Qgarette:
Tobacco, Consumerism and Health in American Life. I s that an article or a book?
A. It's a book. I haven't started writing it yet.
Q. So there is no current draft of that book?
A. That's right.
Q. Do you have materials related to that book; I mean, notes and things that you've taken?
A. I've got my- the documents that I've supplied to you are the principal source of the research for that.
Q. Have you done any kind of outline or anything related to how that book is going to be laid out?
A. Yes. And I've, in the past, provided that to you.
Q. Any update of that outline?
A. No. I haven't updated it.
Q. If we flip over to Number 14,
.....agai n, you have n ot h i n g respon si ve t o Nu m ber.......
14 which is materials prepared by you or directed- or that you directed pertaining to the Leon Barbanell case, correct?
A. Right. I don't have any special things.
Q. Going back to this research and having research assistants do, are they just providing you hard copies of what they're locating in The Miami Herald or are they generating any kind of notes or memos or anything related to that research?
A. The new way that microfilm machines work, which is wonderful, is that you download it to a JPEG. So they are uploaded to my file transfer protocol service, the JPEGS, and then I download them.
Q. And those are just the images of the articles they are locating, correct?
A. That's right, yes. Instead of printing- hitting the print button and have paper come out, you hit the print button and it creates a computer file.
Q. And other than copies of the articles in this electronic form, any other_
materials that your research assistants are generating as part of this research they are doing into The Miami Herald?
A. No, nothing else.
Q. You mentioned one e-mail that accompanied the depositions that you received in this case from Mr. Gdanski in response to Number 15, did you have any other correspondence, including any other e-mails or faxes, that you've received from Mr. Gdanski or anyone else related to the Barbanell case?
A. No. I don't have anything responsive to that.
Q. And that would include documents in Number 17, any correspondence, e-mails or faxes between you and perhaps any other witness in this case?
A. Yeah. I mean, I don't do the medical. That's not anything I do, medical stuff.
Q. In response to Number 18, what is the last presentation or interview that you have given that relates to either Philip Morris or any other tobacco industry company
or organization?
A. The last one was a radio interview which is- the link, it's on the web- it's for public radio, and the link is in my CV.
And that was in September, so you guys have- you know, I've informed you of that.
I haven't had anything new in, say, the last few months, since my last deposition.
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I think we are familiar with, and you've provided- or it's been provided in disclosure, a list of cases you've testified and related to the Engle Progeny cases or other cigarette litigation.
Any other testimony you've given in any cases in the last three years, cases not related to cigarette manufacturers?
A. I n my CV, at the end of the CV I keep a list of all my testimony and, so, Number 19 would be included in that curriculum vitae.
Q. Okay. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I'm looking at what's been marked Deposition Exhibit 4 which is the CV that you produced to us. You have testimony as expert witness
on tobacco-related issues in alphabetical order and you have the series of cases listed, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Have you testified in any non-tobacco related cases in the last three years?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. You- is there somewhere else on your CV where you listed those cases?
A. It's included in that list.
Q. So even though it says on tobacco related issues?
A. You know, I think I misunderstood your question and I apologize. I think I assumed what you were asking me was cases that were- in which tobacco manufacturers is a direct party to the lawsuit.
Tobacco related means on the subject of tobacco, generally. And you might be already aware of this, in the Spring of 2007 I testified in a case in which the issue was asbestos, but in terms .....o.f. the formal point of the lawsuit, but that................
there were tobacco-related issues that were relevant to this particular case and I testified in that.
Q. And that was the Martin case in New York?
A. That's correct.
Q. So other than the Martin case in New York, all of your other testimony has been in a lawsuit that involved a cigarette manufacturer as a defendant, correct?
A. That's correct. I've been disclosed on a number of cases similar to the Martin case, but none of them has ever reached a point where it was either deposition or trial testimony generated.
MS. BROWN:
Why don't we take a break now.
(Off the record.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, just to recap, for this case, the Barbanell case, you're relying upon those materials that were produced to defendants in your generic deposition?
A. That's correct._
Q. Plus the articles and advertisements that you produced to us that you've located in The Miami Herald in the decade of the '50s, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Who decides what group of materials you're going to rely upon in- in any particular case?
A. Well, let's be clear about this because- and this will help you because I know you have a challenge of, you know, kind of defining this set of materials. I'm constantly researching this issue and collecting new materials.
And the stuff that I've been providing to the defense attorneys has been basically, you know, right click, send to my- my research folder. I give you everything that I have.
And, so, as I- I'm constantly getting new materials, I'm trying to keep these in machine readable form as much as possible. Because, you know, my job is to talk about the full expansion, the history of smoking and its culture, you know, to
understand the context of the world in which Ms. Barbanell and other plaintiffs were born into.
So I gave a big set of materials for the preservation deposition. I have since updated that and, you know, we've given that in some other cases. So, yes, to your question.
But, you know, keep in mind I've used materials, reliance materials, in cases that I've done, since January, at trial and I may, you know, want to show those to The Jury as an exhibit.
For example, things like some of the videos and stuff that I've used which, you know, exist on websites and the like.
And because of their high space demands, I don't always download them to the hard drive since they're accessible from the web, news coverage, for example, and the like.
But, so, you know, what I've used, what I provided to you and what I've used in trials, this would be the- would be the universe of materials that I've relied on.
Q. Okay. You understand in this_
case, in preparation for your deposition, which is my one shot to get to talk to you for the trial, right?
A. Right.
Q. You understand in this case defendants were informed that the totality of your reliance materials for Barbanell would be those materials you produced in January for your generic deposition plus the supplemental production you made of 1950s Miami Herald articles and advertisements?
A. Right. Yeah. I'm-for this particular case, that's fair enough, you know. I- I - you know, to just give you some of the context, like, originally this was going to be two cases together, and I'm, you know, pulling together, from my research, materials and from my- my links, my links to website, youth marketing materials that are, you know, relevant, not so much for this case because of chronological time, but may, you know, help inform my opinions in the other case. So I'm constantly working on stuff.
......................But, veah. for your purposes in.....................
terms of where I might draw my exhibits and what I would rely upon, that's fine, because I know you need to be able to have something to work with.
Q. And this case, Barbanell, the Barbanell case, is the first case in which you have supplemented your reliance materials to include these 1950s Miami Herald articles and advertisements, correct?
A. Yes. Specifically The Miami Herald. I've been adding to my newspaper collection since I gave the documents for the preservation deposition, which I think was some time in October or November, pre-deposition, if you call it that, Chicago newspaper, materials, some other smaller Rorida newspapers and the like.
MR. GDANSKI:
And I'll just- I'll just interpose an objection to the extent that when we supplied you with The Miami Herald materials, the plaintiffs indicated that they reserve the right to supplement Dr. Kyriakoudes' reliance materials MS. BROWN:_
And just so we're all on the same page, to the extent you supplement Dr. Kyriakoudes' reliance materials, there may come a point and time where we're going to have to reopen the deposition in advance of Dr. Kyriakoudes taking the stand at trial.
MR. GDANSKI:
I think that you can have that position if you would like to have it. The Judge can make a determination. But, like in all of our expert witness disclosures, there's a line about supplementing what they rely upon, we can go down whatever the appropriate legal roads are at the time.
But Dr. Kyriakoudes has already talked about this subject.
THE WITNESS:
And just for clarification, you know, rely on, to me, means, you know, in a way, that's asking for, like, the sum of all the education and research and reading that I've done, you know, on this subject, which is massive, you know.
So it's-- there's a little bitit's one of those cases where I guess,
maybe, with the medical doctor who's got a set bound quantity of medical records related to a particular person's illness and that's what he relies upon. But, for me, this is the broader historical context and historical research of this story and the role of the tobacco industry and shaping just according to how the, you know, public knowledge and understanding over the long period of time.
So, it's- I'm not trying to make things difficult for you in any way whatsoever, but, you know, I've got a huge body of learning that I have kind of put into my head, so to speak. I can't back the library up to- you know, to the trial room, the courtroom.
Just so that you understand that it's a big subject and I've done a lot of reading and research and thinking over many years on this.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Has any of your research that you've performed since your generic deposition in January changed any of the_
opinions that you gave at your generic deposition in January?
A. No.
Q. Has the research that you've done into The Miami Herald in the 1950s changed in any way the opinions that you have testified to at your generic deposition and a few other depositions since then in Engle Progeny cases?
A. No.
Q. What opinions do you intend to give in the Leon Barbanell case?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to form. Overly broad.
A. Well, depending upon what questions I'm asked, of course. But I'm prepared to discuss the history of tobacco in American life over the full course of American history.
MS. BROWN:
Q. I'm going to just pause you because I know you've got more to answer.
On that particular topic, again, those opinions would be- on that topic would be .....consistent with what vou testified to in....................
your generic and other depositions, correct?
A. That's correct. I'm prepared to talk about the history of the cigarette as a tobacco device which would include, for example, the 19th Century history of the cigarette, the role it played in the tobacco consumption market and tobacco culture of America.
The rise of the machine made cigarettes in the 1880s and the introduction of the modern American blended cigarettes, Camel, Lucky Strike, Chesterfield and the like, the rise of the cigarette use over the course of the 20th Century, public attitudes and beliefs about tobacco, generally, and cigarettes, specifically; the tobacco industry's role in promoting the sale of cigarettes, advertising and marketing and the like.
The role of the emerging size, in terms of the public awareness of size, on the relationship between cigarette use and disease as it merged beginning the very late 1940s, '49 onward; the role of the tobacco industry in responding to the challenge of
what they called in their documents so-called cancer scare; the ways in which cigarettes changed; say, for example, the introduction of filters, the rise of lights and other types of cigarette developments.
The role of government in this-in this process, specifically the US Public Health Service but also the Federal Trade Commission and other regulatory agencies.
The role of politics in this process, the role of other independent nongovernmental health-related organizations such as the American Medical Association; the ways in which the tobacco industry reconfigured its marketing, public relations, appeals in light of the smoking and health debate; the ways in which the tobacco industry measured public knowledge, public statements, other measures of public knowledge and understanding and carrying that forward.
It's a big story. The role of historical context and change over time in this, understanding the world in which, in this case, Ms. Barbanell you know, what the
world that she was born into, the forces that had affected that world in terms of issues related to tobacco use, cigarette use, smoking and health.
The ways in which the tobacco industry disseminated false from misleading information, creating doubt as to confusion as to the matter.
I could go on, depending upon what I'm asked. I could talk quite a bit.
Q. One thing that I'm not hearing you say that you're going to give an opinion on is the information environment Shirley Barbanell herself found herself in as far as, you know, direct actors on her, through media, through the family, the way she got information related to cigarette smoking and health. Is that not an issue that you're going to address?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, I have talked about- I didn't use your language, but the list that I've given you includes that, including the coverage of the smoking and health debate in
the media, the role of advertising over time.
MS. BROWN:
Q. So as far as coverage of the smoking health- the smoking and health debate as it relates to Shirley Barbanell, we're specifically talking about coverage in those mass media vehicles that Shirley Barbanell had an opportunity to hear, read, see, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, you know, the documentary record on this is insufficient for any historian following the methods and materials normally accepted and relied upon in our profession, according to our training, to state what she may or may not have seen as an individual.
So the best that any historian who's expert on the subject as being true to the methods of our profession of our analysis is to talk about the larger context of the information. And that's a point I've
.....made many times in my^	...........
restating it here.
MS. BROWN:
Q. What we do know, for example, for Shirley Barbanell, where she lived at certain points in time in her life, correct?
A. That's right. She lived mostly in New York, briefly in Florida and, then, final move to Florida, I guess you would say, in the mid 1980s.
Q. So we can agree that- I think you made reference that you've done some research into the Chicago papers. Whatever was being publicized in the Chicago papers wouldn't really have any relevance to the information environment that Shirley Barbanell was growing up and living in during her life?
A. That's true. I wouldn't- I mean,
I don't intend to, you know, show that-well, no. Right, the Chicago paper, which is, you know, The Chicago Tribune, is not considered to be like The New York Times, the paper of record with a national scope and national purview.
_But keep in mind, I mean, the_
Chicago paper would be relevant to the extent that if, you know, you were just, say, for example, researching the wire services, you could look at the Chicago paper and see what they have to say about wire service stories, those kind of things.
I don't -
Q. Wouldn't it make more sense to look at the newspapers that she was actually reading at the time or at least in the communities in which she was living at the time to see if those wire stories were actually picked up?
MR. GDANSKI:
I don't think he was done with his last answer. Were you done, Dr. Kyriakoudes?
A. Yeah. I was all right. That was sufficient enough for me to answer that so I'll take the follow-up question.
Yes, I mean, here's the issue: I mean, you don't know whether she read the paper or not, I mean, or any particular story. You know, you're simply making an inference.
And, so, you know, one could argue just as persuasively that, you know, if she watched television that she probably- that one might want to look at The New York Times because who was reading The New York Times but the television news editors, the people behind, you know, the anchors that are making the decision about what stories to cover. That's- that's as important.
Now, in this particular case, because she does have a long experience in New York, The New York Times would be relevant under the conditions that you mentioned if you follow that analytical reason.
But, you know, it's very difficult indeed, I think nearly impossible, given the documentary evidence in this particular case, that is essentially the testimony of the plaintiffs' depositions, to ascertain whether she saw any particular thing or not.
And you certainly can't make any judgement what she knew or understood.
So as a historian, can only talk about this as really kind of a national_
issue of which it was, a very important national issue.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Well, we can draw pretty reasonable inferences that she probably wasn't reading The Chicago Tribune with any regularity, right?
A. Right. But do we know whether she was reading Time Magazine, Life or Newsweek, maybe, maybe not. Did she subscribe to it; as they say in the deposition, at the doctor's office, maybe, maybe not, it's hard to say.
So the best you can do is talk about the kinds of information that were circulating through the United Sates because that's what you have. I mean, you've got to be based on the evidence at hand.
Q. So during the time period she was living in New York, The New York Times would be her community newspaper, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
..............A......jt was.certainly a.New York...............................
newspaper with a national perspective.
MS. BROWN:
Q. I think you've testified before that The New York Times was not distributed or regularly sold and subscribed to by residents of Rorida in the '50s, '60s and '70s, correct?
A. Yes. I see no evidence that they would distribute it down there. It's difficult to get all aspects of that, but I'm working under the assumption that the paper would have been available only- you know, let me rephrase that.
South Rorida especially, you know. You've got to understand the role The New York Times plays in New York mind-set, particularly at this earlier period in the Jewish community.
Because The Times has always been very responsive to coverage of Jewish issues, generally, and, in particular, issues related to Israel, more than, I think, other papers over a long period of history.
_And that simply is a reflection of_
the special makeup of the New York City population over the course of the 20th Century. So The New York Times really matters to people in a way, you know, in a kind of expatriate New York Jewish community as you have developing in Rorida.
I'll give you one example from my own personal experience. When I was in graduate school, the early 1990s, part of that time was spent in Nashville, Tennessee. And my wife and I developed a business where we delivered the Sunday New York Times-this was before the Internet-- to homes in Nashville. We had a few college professors.
But we connected with a woman, and I remember her name, Sally Levine, who was very active in the largest of Nashville's synagogues. And through her word of mouth that you could get the Sunday Times, boom, you know, we had, like, 150 subscribers relatively quickly. And we'd pick them up at three o'clock in the morning, put them together and drive them to these homes.
And, you know, I talked to her.
She said well, you know, we want to know
what's going on in New York even though we live in Nashville, because The Times is so responsive to issues that are important to us.
So that is a special- special characteristic that you need to keep in mind.
Q. Was Shirley Barbanell Jewish?
A. She's of Polish/Jewish immigrant stock, that's what I understood to read in the deposition. For her personally, see, again, you know, I don't know what her personal relationship was with faith.
That's not addressed in the deposition so I'm not going to tie this to her.
But you can say with some reasonable certainty, historical certainty, South Rorida, or Southeastern Florida in this case, having developed in the '40s,
'50s and '60s, has a close connection with northeastern Jewish communities.
Q. In fact, I mean, you don't even have to make those assumptions in this case, right? I mean, do you recall Leon Barbanell testifying about the fact that they would go
to synagogue?
A. There's some discussion of that, you know, yes. So, right.
Q. So that would lead you to believe that she was of the Jewish faith in some respect, whether she went regularly or not?
A. Right.
Q. But she's not Catholic; she's Jewish, correct?
A. Right. No, that I know. My qualification was- you know, I don't have a good handle on her relationship as an adult, you know, with her faith community and that doesn't matter because she's- what I'm talking about is somebody at a higher level of generalization applying to the special demographic development of southeastern Florida.
Q. Now, the flip side wouldn't be true, would it, Dr. Kyriakoudes, that The Miami Herald would hold some special significance to someone who's living in New York?
A. Well, at the time that we're talking about, probably not. But, you know..........
you can look at it this way: You know, if I was in nineteen- let's say 1965, just choosing a date at random, post 1959, and expatriate Cuban, I would probably be very interested in what The Miami Herald was covering, for the same kinds of reasons that I described earlier relating to New York but in the other direction.
So one could- you know, one could look at that. The Miami Herald has always, you know, this is the post-Castro period, covered Cuba well.
Q. In the context of this case where we're talking about Shirley Barbanell who grew up in New York and was Jewish as far as we know, not Cuban, you wouldn't expect The Miami Herald to have held any special significance to her in the 1950s, correct?
A. No.
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Have you ever met Leon Barbanell?
A. No.
Q. How about Karen Segal, Shirley_
Barbanell's daughter, have you met her?
A. I've met nobody of any of the deposition people. I've not even met in person Mr. Gdanski.
Q. So whatever you know about Shirley Barbanell you gleaned from the three depositions you've read and any conversations you've had with Mr. Gdanski?
A. That's right. You guys ask good questions.
Q. I think you said you know Shirley Barbanell was born in 1923, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. Do you know where she was born?
A. Brooklyn-- no, wait. No, no.
She's, I guess, an immigrant child. I think he said she was four or so when she came to the United States. She was born in Poland.
Q. When you say he said, who are you referring to?
A. Mr. Barbanell, Leon.
Q. Do you know where she attended elementary school?
A. I don't know her specific school.
Q. How about her hiqh school?
A. I don't know the name of her high school.
Q. Do you know how far she got in school?
A. She went to high school but she didn't go beyond that.
Q. Did she graduate from high school?
A. There's a discussion of that and I can't remember if he said- Mr. Barbanell said she graduated or not, but there is a discussion of that in the deposition.
Q. Do you know whether or not Shirley Barbanell was employed outside the home?
A. She had a variety of jobs that are discussed in the deposition.
Q. Do you know how old she was when she started smoking?
A. Mr. Barbanell reports that she was quite young.
Q. Do you recall how it is Mr.
Barbanell knows how old she was when she started smoking?
A. There's some- I'm not recalling right now. I would have to review my copy of the deposition._
Q. Do you remember when Mr. Barbanell said he met Shirley Barbanell?
A. Yes. Later. I mean, I think it was a second marriage for both of them. So they both met in the 1950s. I guess they were married- there's some confusion as to the mathematics of the date in this- in the deposition, but people seem to all comment on a marriage date of 1956, so we'll say mid to late '50s.
Q. Do you know where Shirley Barbanell was living at the point Leon met her?
A. I thought they were still in New York at that time.
Q. Do you know where she was living when she started smoking?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to form.
A. New York, is what my recollection
is.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Do you know what the circumstances were of her first cigarette?
.....MR. GDANSKI:.............................................................................
Object to the form.
A. I'm not recalling anything that stands out.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Do you know what brand of cigarettes she smoked first?
A. Well, there's a long discussion about a variety of brands that she smoked over the course of her smoking experience, but Mr. Barbanell says that he believes Chesterfield was the first brand.
Q. Did he say that was the first brand or that was the first brand he recalled her smoking when he met her?
A. I would have to refresh my recollection by rereading that part of the deposition. Also, I mean, there's a discussion of Camel's being an early brand, Lucky Strike's, Pall Mall, Marlboro. They even talk later of her smoking Kool.
There's a variety of brands that she smoked, which, you know, is not surprising. People would try lots of different cigarettes over the course of their career._
Q. Of the three depositions you reviewed in this case, any of those individuals say they were there when she started smoking?
A. Well, no, because two of them are people that she would have only met as an adult through marriage, to Mr. Barbanell, under the assumption that Mr. Barbanell's brother and sister-in-law, and the other is her daughter, so certainly wasn't there.
Q. We don't have any contemporaries of her- or that you have reviewed, any testimony of any contemporaries of her that were her contemporaries at the time she started smoking?
A. That's correct. And, again, that's not really important to me either way for my opinions in this case or any other case.
Q. You don't know why Shirley Barbanell smoked her first cigarette, do you?
A. Why she, as an individual?
Q. Yes. Shirley Barbanell?
A. No. Whv she smoked, no.
Q. And you don't know why Shirley Barbanell continued smoking, do you?
A. Well, I mean, to the extent that people continue smoking to satisfy a nicotine addiction, that would be my answer.
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, what area of expertise do you have to determine that Shirley Barbanell had a nicotine addiction?
A. I'm not a toxicologist and don't intend to offer an opinion on that in that subject, but you asked me a question and I gave you an answer.
Q. So it's your supposition that it was nicotine addiction but you don't have any basis for concluding that she was, in fact, nicotine addicted, correct?
A. That's right. That's not an area I've ever testified to and hold out as an area of expertise and I've made that clear many times.
Q. You would leave that to experts like psychiatrists, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, I saw that Jack Henninqfield
was listed as an expert in this case. He certainly would be qualified to give that kind of testimony, I think. But I- let me just say I would leave it to others possessing a different expertise than myself to make the determination of a particular individual's nicotine addiction.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Do you have any basis for concluding that Jack Henningfield will provide an opinion in this case that Shirley Barbanell is addicted?
A. Well, I saw that name, you handed me a document earlier which is listed as Deposition Exhibit Number 1 and I thought I saw his name in there. And, of course, Jack Henningfield is the author- one of the authors of the 1988 Surgeon General's report as eminent and qualified on the subject of nicotine addiction.
Q. But you're not familiar with what opinions he will be providing in this case; is that true?
A. That's true, yes. I don't- I .....mean,JhjsJs: something I ..just learned while..........
you were handing me a piece of paper.
Q. And you have no basis for concluding that Jack Henningfield has reviewed any materials specific to this case or formed any opinions specific to the Shirley Barbanell case, correct?
A. Yeah. I don't want to lead you down a path, you know, that- and occupy your time, you know. I'm not an addiction specialist. I'm not going to offer individual opinions on Ms. Barbanell's medical psychological history.
That's- you know, and I've been clear about that and I think you, in the body of my testimony- over the many times that I've done this, I've been consistent in that.
So I'm not- I've not developed any new expertise, I haven't secretly gotten another Ph.D., toxicology or any of the-
Q. Psychiatry or psychology?
A. Psychiatry or psychology or any of those subjects.
Q. So to go back to my guestion that kind of triggered this whole thing, do you,
Dr. Kyriakoudes, know why Shirley Barbanell continued smoking?
A. I'm not going to offer an opinion as to why she continued smoking herself as an individual because I do not know that.
Q. Do you know, based on your review of the depositions, whether Shirley Barbanell enjoyed her cigarette smoking? MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. I wouldn't- I wouldn't know how to answer that question. I mean, to me, that's a question that is really another way of asking the previous question you asked me, so my answer would be the same.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Do you know if Leon testified in his deposition that Shirley enjoyed smoking?
A. As I sit here, I can't recall what he said on that.
Q. And you're not going to testify in the Barbanell case as to reasons why any particular smoker begins to or continues to smoke, correct?
A. Any particular smoker no. I
mean, if asked about the demography of smoking which, you know, applies to large numbers of people, you know, I can't say that, you know, unbalanced, you know, what the characteristics of the population is like when they first begin smoking, you know, they're usually young, school age, junior high, 16 being the median age, those kinds of broad issues, but not on any particular individual I don't, no.
Q. Do you know what brands of cigarettes Shirley Barbanell smoked throughout her life?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, in the deposition there's a discussion of many brands. And to the extent that those brands are discussed in the deposition, I'm aware of those.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Do you know what her primary brand was?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form A. Again, you've got to be sensitive_
to time, you know, when.
MS. BROWN:
Q. So based on your review of the depositions, you didn't come away believing that there was one brand of cigarettes that she smoked for a longer period than any other brand of cigarettes?
A. Okay. That's a different question. My takeaway point on the brand smoking history is not particularly relevant for my analysis. I can report back to you what I know on this. It seems that in the '50s there's discussion of a variety of brands, Parliament, you know, which had some play back in the '50s, Camel, Chesterfield.
It seems that she settled on Marlboro as a- as a steady brand for a significant amount of time, '60s and '70s certainly. That's my- my interpretation of the very complex and sometimes, you know, convoluted, contradictory testimony in the depositions.
Q. Was that Karen Segal's testimony as well?
..............A......Karen Segal . well, she talks about.................
Camel. She mentions Camel early on. Leon Barbanell talks about Marlboro. I mean, it's a little conflicting. That's not so important to me in the formulation of my opinions because, you know, the cigarette is a product category.
The smoking and health debate and the public's understanding of it involves around the cigarette. And some cigarettes may be perceived by the public as healthier, filters eventually, maybe, you know, lights and that kind of cigarette, Carlton's and those brands.
But, generally, you know, the discussion in the media, the information, if you will, deals with the category cigarette.
Q. So what brand Shirley Barbanell smoked doesn't really factor into the opinions you're going to give in this case; is that correct?
A. That's true. With the modifications that I mentioned earlier, you know, in this case it's not that important to me.
_But as a historical phenomenon,_
the changes in the cigarette market are important, non-filtered cigarettes, dominant mode into the '50s, the rise of filters, or filter revolution as it's referred to in the literature sometimes. And, then, you know, the shift, low tar, low nicotine, the so-called light cigarettes after that.
Those are general, broad changes in- in the types of cigarettes sold.
So that may be- you know, that may be something I'm asked to discuss on the stand and can talk about that as its relationship with public understanding of the cigarette.
For Ms. Barbanell as a particular individual, I think the particular brands that she smoked is more important to you, and you meaning the lawyers, as to determine who's part of the case and what have you than it is to me as a historian dealing with the history of the cigarette.
It's a little bit long-winded answer. I've been trying not to be long-winded in this deposition but I had to make that point clear.
Q. Do you know if Shirley Barbanell smoked a light cigarette at any point in time?
A. I don't recall seeing a reference to that.
Q. Do you know why she smoked the brands of cigarettes she smoked?
A. She is an individual. My answer would have to be the same to the similar set of questions you asked earlier. Why she individually chose, I don't- I don't know.
Q. Do you know whether Shirley Barbanell ever tried to quit soaking?
A. There is discussion of that, yes.
So I do know that, yes.
Q. Do you know why she tried to quit smoking?
A. No, I don't. But there's discussion of her attempting various means to do so.
Q. Do you recall what methods she used to quit smoking?
A. Hypnosis was discussed and what they call the patch, which I'm assuming to mean the nicotine patch. Those two were
discussed.
Q. Now, I assume you're not going to give any opinions on this case about the ease or difficulty Shirley Barbanell had quitting smoking; is that right?
A. Right. That would be an addiction question, and my answer would be the same,
I'm not going to give that testimony.
Q. We talked earlier about the fact that there are lots of sources of information, lots of conduits of information about the health risks of smoking, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. And one source of information about the health risks of smoking for individuals is their personal physicians, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know whether Shirley Barbanell's doctors ever warned her about the health risks of smoking cigarettes?
A. Well, there's some discussion of her medical history in the deposition, but I don't know either way, you know, what, when ■■■■PLwhaLthejLw^	..................................................
Q. Another source of information you talked about earlier is family and friends can provide information about the health risks of smoking of individuals, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you know whether Shirley Barbanell's family or friends advised her about the health risks of smoking and encouraged her to quit?
A. Her daughter talks about that.
Q. Do you know what her parents told her about the risks of smoking?
A. I don't recall. If that's in there, I'm not breaking any recollection.
So, no, I don't.
Q. Do you know what Leon Barbanell told her over the years about the risks of smoking?
A. He discusses a little bit of that.
I'm not recalling the exact language he uses so my recollection of that is not complete.
Q. But you recall that he said they discussed it, correct?
A. Yeah. Later in life especially.
Q. Do you recall that he testified_
that he encouraged Shirley Barbanell to quit smoking?
A. He talks about that, yes, particularly later in life.
Q. Do you recall what she would tell him when-MR. GDANSKI:
I'm just going to generally object to this is. I'm not sure of the relevance to this line of questions and where it's going and how it relates to Dr. Kyriakoudes' opinions and testimony. I'm not sure-you're asking him to recall-- are you asking him to recall what was throughout the deposition?
MS. BROWN:
I'm going to continue to ask my questions, Jonathan. If you have an objection you can lodge it.
MR. GDANSKI:
Sure. My objection is there. You can go ahead and ask your questions from the books.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Do vou recall what she would say
to Leon Barbanell when he would tell her she should quit smoking?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. I thought Leon Barbanell said that she said she couldn't stop.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Didn't he, in fact, say that she told him to mind his own business?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form. Is that a question?
Go ahead.
MS. BROWN:
Jonathan, you can assume if I ask it and it has an inflection at the end of it it's a question.
MR. GDANSKI:
The inflection is obvious. I'll object to the question.
You can go ahead and answer it to the extent that you can.
A. I would have to refresh my recollection of that part of the deposition and- so, vou know. I'm not recalling that,
which was your question.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Do you know what Shirley Barbanell believed about the dangers of smoking at any point in time?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Her as an individual, I don't, and don't intend to offer- therefore, don't intend to offer any testimony on that and have not given that kind of judgement in any other case I've given. Just so you're clear on this, I'm going to be consistent.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Do you know whether she believed that cigarette smoking was hurting her health in the 1950s?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form A. I don't know what she, as an individual, held as that view.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Would that be true as well for the '60s, the '70s, the '80s?
.....MR GDANSKI:.............................................................................
Object to the form of that statement.
A. I'm not going to offer opinions on her individual state of mind on the issues of smoking.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Do you know whether Shirley Barbanell believed that cigarette smoking was addictive?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. I know that Leon Barbanell reports that she said that she couldn't stop, but I'm not going to offer, you know- I mean, what do you mean by addictive? That's- are you using that in a technical sense, as a physical dependency process? I don't intend to offer those opinions on her as an individual.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Because you don't know what she believed about whether cigarette smoking was addictive under any definition, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
_Object to the form._
A. That's right. And I don't think any other historian can offer that view either, given the fact that she's passed and that she's- that the evidentiary record is scanty and incomplete.
Q. But you do know that she told Leon in 1960 that she believed she was, quote, "addicted" to smoking, right?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Is that how she phrases it in the deposition? Can you represent that to me as the- as I sit here without, you know, the deposition in front of me to check that?
MS. BROWN:
Q. So you don't recall Leon testifying that his wife told him that she was, quote, "addicted" in 1960?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the to the form.
A. I don't recall that particular section.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Is that relevant to your opinions in this case, what Shirlev Barbanell knew
and believed about the risks of smoking, including addiction?
A. Well, that's a loaded question. I think that- cannot make a real determination about what someone really knew and really believed from the thin and scanty evidence here, which is all, you know, evidence generated within the last few years.
This is one of the problems with, you know, oral interviews which I have some considerable expertise in. Oral history is very good for certain kinds of information but is highly susceptible to presentism and influence by current and contemporary values and belief, so it has to be used in a very tricky way.
And depositions are really a form of oral history in the sense that they're being used, even though they're highly structured and formalized.
So as I sit here, I don't think the record is anywhere near complete or reliable enough for any historian to make a judgement as to what she really knew and_
understood to be true. So that's why my testimony has always focused on groups for which we do have historically extent reliable data, polls, surveys, things like that.
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you factor into your opinions you're going to give in this case what Leon Barbanell and Karen Segal and Fay Barbanell report Shirley saying about her beliefs and knowledge regarding the risks of smoking?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form. I'll take it as a question because of the inflection, but I'm sure it was one.
A. Well, my response to that is one of the fundamentals. The first things one learns in historical analysis when you do history as a professional is how to weigh evidence. You know, some evidence is more reliable, more suited to your particular historical question, other is less reliable.
That's really, you know, what- what we're dealing with here.
.....MS. BROWN:.................................................................................
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, the question is what did Shirley Barbanell know and believe about the risks of smoking. What could be more reliable than what her family reports she said about that topic?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Okay. I'll give you an example.
An interview with Shirley Barbanell in 1960 in where she's asked a series of questions in 1960 as to what she knows and believes. That would be more reliable.
MS. BROWN:
Q. True. But plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in 1996, '97, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. So there was never an opportunity to interview Shirley Barbanell and take down what she believed about the risks of smoking in 1960, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. So given the evidence that we're handed in this lawsuit, what could be more reliable in trying to determine what Shirley Barbanell knew and believed about the risks
of smoking than what her family reports she told them?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, again, if we had data, historical information generated at the time that we're interested in, closer to the time period, as a rule, that's more reliable; a diary, letters, things like that.
I mean, so, your question is, you know, what would be more reliable. Well, right now, we have no other real evidence on what she knew and believed except for these isolated phrases and mentionings in an interview- in a deposition. And that's -that's not very reliable.
So I'm not going to make a statement as to what Shirley Barbanell knew and understood to believe. I think the record is inadequate for me to make a professional opinion on this. I will talk, as I've done in the past, you know, about groups of people for which I have evidence that I feel is sufficient for me to make an authoritative judgement. That's the best
answer I can give.
MS. BROWN:
Q. When you talk about groups of people, I assume you're talking, for example, about some of the polls that you rely upon when you give your testimony, correct?
A. That would be in that category,
yes.
Q. I n trying to determine where Shirley Barbanell would fall in that poll, whether she falls on, you know, the question is cigarette- is cigarette smoking harmful and some people answer yes and some people answer no.
In trying to draw a conclusion about which group of people Shirley Barbanell- since this case is about her, which of the people is Shirley Barbanell more alike, the yes's or the no's, isn't the best evidence for determining that what she told her family and what they report she told them?
MR. GDANSKI:
_Object to the form._
A. I don't mean this in any way as a cop-out, but my position has been that, you know, that is really a question for The Jury to decide. I can offer- I can take them up to the point where my professional standards can take me and beyond that I cannot take the question any- any farther.
The next step has to be taken by the panel of citizens who are judged with making, you know, the ultimate decision as to the weight of the evidence and, in this case, the Barbanell case.
You know, I can't do more than what the standards of my profession allow me to do and I've been very careful about that.
And it may not be satisfying to you or to Mr. Gdanski, plaintiffs or defendants, but I've got to stick to what historians do and our methods of professional judgement and evidentiary standards.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Based on that, is it fair to say that what Shirley Barbanell's family reports she said about her beliefs and knowledge .....related. t o. t h e health risks of smokinq has.................
no relevance to your opinions in this case?
MR GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Limited relevance. For example, all right, she said this in 1960; that's at one point in time. What did she think in 1965, what did she think in 1955. You're just getting this one little dot.
I mean, this is a problem that you also have with polls, you know. Polls- any particular poll or survey is simply a snapshot at that moment in time and can't be extrapolated, that particular poll, beyond that time when it's taken, the week or so that the poll is conducted. So you have to keep these issues in mind.
And if you were to weigh a poll in a kind of hypothetical situation, if you were to weigh a poll and Ms. Barbanell's hearsay statements equally, well, you only have one statement, or maybe you have two, I don't know. You only have one poll- well, some of the polls are more frequently done.
But they are, they're just--they're snapshots, and that's one of the_
problems, or one of the challenges in doing historical research. You can't design and experiment and create the kind of data that you want. You have to work with what you have as our earlier discussion indicated.
So it means weighing the evidence.
It's- it's only- you know, it's not that significant, her statements on this issue, because they're scanty and reported secondhand.
MS. BROWN:
Q. When we look at the polls and consider the polls, the polls show a trend of knowledge and understanding that grows, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form A. Well, which period are you talking about?
MS. BROWN:
Q. Well, if we look at the entirety?
I mean, if we start with polls in the '50s, we take them through the '60s, the '70s, the '80s, you're not seeing that knowledge and understanding, you know, pushing in reverse,
right? We don't have a bunch of people who say cigarette smoking is harmful and, then, five years later, you know, an even larger amount say no, not harmful. It grows; that number grows?
A. Let's look at- you know, I understand your guestion. I have to answer it a little with some specificity. Let's take the standard Gallup guestion. I mean, there's lots of ways to measure- I mean, the polling guestions come at a problem lots of different ways.
There's value in taking into account all the polling guestions. No one guestion is sufficient. But one of the more (inaudible) guestions is one done by the Gallo organization, do you believe that-and I'm paraphrasing: Do you believe that cigarettes are one of the causes of lung cancer.
And the history of that is relatively small numbers respond affirmatively. I think that's the first time that's asked in that particular language. It grows a little bit. It_
actually retrogrades and deteriorates in the late '50s, so there is actually a rollback, and, then, it picks up again in the 1960s.
If you take- you know, trend is, of course, where you start your points. If you start your point in 1954 as your first point and 1980s your second point, yeah, the line is upward. But there is fluctuation in that during that period.
And those fluctuations matter for understanding periodization of the smoking and health debate and the public's understanding of those risks. But the trend is upward over time.
Q. So, Dr. Kyriakoudes, I assume you don't have any reason to believe that for Shirley Barbanell that trend would be different, do you?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. You can't- you can't compare these two things, because a poll asks people in response to a guestion and sorts them into two categories. Let's- we'll stick .....with-- we'II source. t h em into cateqories....................
when they give a response: Yes, no, maybe, dont know, or however the guestion is worded. So a poll is not one person, it's a group of people.
People can change their minds about issues. For McCain, before the financial crisis, after he suspended his campaign, I think a lot of people changed their mind. That would be a contemporary example.
So, no, you can't- it's just not a valid inference; in part, a collective instrument of what the poll to an individual - I mean, you just can't- no poll can actually do that.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Going back, Doctor, to sources of information about the health risks of smoking, you testified earlier that the government is a source of information about the health risks of smoking, correct?
A. Sure.
Q. Do you know whether Shirley Barbanell knew in 1964 that the Surgeon General released a report that concluded_
that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer?
A. Leon talks about that in the-Leon Barbanell talks about that in the deposition. He reports her talking about that, yes.
Q. And do you also know whether she was aware of the Surgeon General's warning on cigarette packages?
A. Yeah. He did talk about that as well, yes. There's a discussion of that, yes.
Q. Then we've talked a lot today about the fact that news media is another source of information about the health risk of smoking, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Yeah, I mean, about the cigarette, generally, of which the risk would be a subset of information.
MS. BROWN:
Q. And I think you said earlier that you don't know whether Shirley Barbanell typically read the newspaper, right?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. There's reference- I mean, the depo has a reference to the newspaper, you know, like she occasionally read it. It's hazy and indistinct. I'm not going to tie her to any- her personally to any particular newspaper.
MS. BROWN:
Q. DO you know which magazines she regularly read?
A. Well, yeah, you know, the evidence is- I mean, people mention- there's one line of questioning where one of the attorneys run through a bunch of different magazines like Reader's Digest. They said yeah, sometimes she would read that. Other magazines, their response is, like, no, no, no, or maybe at the doctor's office or what have you. So it's ambiguous, you know, is the best I can say about that.
MS. BROWN:
Q. But you do know, based on the deposition testimony, that she typically watched the television news, correct?
A. Yes. There's a mention of radio_
as well. She listened to the radio.
Q. Do you know of any cigarette advertisements she saw or heard?
A. Again, I can't tie her to a specific advertisement. I will talk about cigarette advertising generally and discuss those advertisements as historical documents, but whether Ms. Barbanell saw them or not- they were ubiquitous in American life, but I'll let The Jury make that connection.
Q. So you're not going to give an opinion in this case as to what role any advertising played in Shirley Barbanell's choice to smoke or choice of brands to smoke, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form. Overly broad.
A. My- my testimony will be consistent with prior testimony which is that I'll talk about cigarette advertising as part of shaping acceptability for cigarette use and general public attitudes towards smoking.
.......................Ihe..admtisemems.served. multiple.......
functions informing the public, generally, about the cigarette, how to use it, what-you know, what it does, whether it's dangerous or safe, etcetera.
So I'm not going to tie Ms.
Barbanell as an individual to any specific individual advertisement.
MS. BROWN:
Q. And you're not going to be able to say what advertising generally- how advertising generally impacted Shirley Barbanell, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. I'll talk about advertising as its- as its impact on American cigarette culture and social practice related to cigarettes, the way advertisements reflected or expressed messages that the creator of the advertisements were hoping to get out to the public.
Whether they- the extent to her as an individual, I'm not going to make that discussion because her state of mind is not knowable at these historical points based on
the evidence that exists in this case.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Do you intend to talk at trial in this case about the Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers published in 1954?
A. If asked about that. If I'm asked a question about that- that information, advocacy statement, I'll respond.
Q. But you haven't seen any evidence in what you've reviewed in this case to suggest that Shirley Barbanell ever saw a Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers, correct?
A. Her as an individual.
Q. That's who- I mean, every time I say Shirley Barbanell, Doctor, that's who I'm talking about because that's who this case is about.
A. Right. No, I can talk about the role of the Frank Statement in shaping public understanding of the tobacco industry's roles, smoke and health debate as I've done many times.
You know, Mr. Barbanell is asked a series of questions related to that January
11th, nineteen- or January 4th, 1954, but I'm not going to- you know, the evidence is incomplete and scanty.
I mean, I can tell The Jury that this was why it disseminated across the United States and subsequently shown and discussed afterwards in news, television, radio, newspapers, television and radio.
But putting Ms. Barbanell in front of Frank Statement, affirmatively I cannot do that.
Q. And there's nothing in Leon's testimony that suggests that Shirley Barbanell saw the Frank Statement or any of the following coverage of the Frank Statement, correct?
A. Well, you know, we're talking, you know, 54 or so years, I forget the exact dates in the deposition, after the fact, it's neither for or against based on the document; it's a wash. It neither approves or disproves what she saw.
Q. Well, there's no evidence in the case that Leon Barbanell or Shirley Barbanell are familiar with the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, right?_
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. That's true, either way; no evidence either way.
MS. BROWN:
Q. And Leon testified, did he not, that he had never heard of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. That doesn't surprise me.
MS. BROWN:
Q. And there's no evidence in this case that Leon or Shirley Barbanell knew of the Council for Tobacco Research, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you know that Leon testified that he's unaware that Shirley ever saw anything published by these entities, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form A. Well, he's not aware of them, you know, it's a long time after the fact. That .....doesn't mean she didn't see them, it doesn't.......
mean she did see them. It's just not very reliable evidence.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Well, if, in fact, she didn't see them, Dr. Kyriakoudes, we can agree, can't we, that something she didn't see or didn't read would have had no impact on her knowledge or beliefs about the health risks of smoking?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
Mischaracterizes testimony.
A. I can't agree with that statement, because these things, you know, filters through the culture and society people-somebody else sees it and they talk about it, you know, the water cooler, so to speak, and it's amplified through society.
This is one of the, you know, realities of modern mass media, you know.
It's a historical phenomenon which is you don't have to sit there and see it for it to have an influence on the public's knowledge and understanding. And that cuts both ways. You know, it applies to industry statement_
and to the public health community, you know.
So whether one person saw or didn't see a particular thing is really not relevant because there's other ways that information reverberates and echoes through social society. That's just reality.
MS. BROWN:
Q. You didn't see any evidence, did you, that anyone else discussed with Shirley Barbanell publications from the Tobacco Industry Research Committee or CTRor Tl, did you?
A. No. Mr. Barbanell seems to have been, as we said earlier, unfamiliar with those organizations, which I'm not surprised.
Q. I am going to change gears just a little bit. Doctor, are you currently planning or invited anywhere to offer any lectures on the history of smoking and health?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form A. Right now I have no pending
invitations.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Have you taught classes that focus on the health risks of smoking?
A. I've taught and will teach a class called Tobacco in American Life of which we talk about the smoking and health debate as part of that. So, yes, I have included that in my course work as a teacher.
Q. How much of that class is spent discussing the publications of the health risks of smoking?
A. When I last taught the class I divided it into three- three equal segments focusing on production, consumption and science which would be the health component.
So I divided the semester into three segments, so about five weeks on the health- on the health crisis.
Q. Are there materials that you prepared for that class?
A. Yeah. I've given these to you guys in the past. You've asked for- I've given you some PowerPoints that I've put together for that class. When I taught it_
it was a seminar so I didn't lecture very much, but I did occasionally lecture, and I've disclosed those to you.
Q. Other than PowerPoint, any kind of handouts or materials that you prepared and distributed to for these classes?
A. Well, we had a syllabus. And we did reading. We would read articles of the like. When I - when I last taught it- and, again, when I teach it again in the spring of '10, it has a strong research paper component to it. So it's one of those hands-on courses where you produce a research paper, original research. So we were heavy on using the tobacco industry documents as a primary source because they're so convenient.
But we also had- they didn't have to do their papers in those documents. Some students did history with smokers and a couple did deep studies of tobacco for me.
It was up to the students to choose their subject. Some did marketing, a variety of things.
......................But I've supplied- it's been a..........................
while, but I supplied those course materials to you.
Q. When did you say was the last time you taught this class?
A. I last taught it in the spring of '07 and it's coming up again in my rotation, spring of '10.
Q. You talked about using the tobacco industry documents as a primary source. Do you also provide access to your students the newspaper collection that you've put together?
A. Yeah. I gave them my- what I had, at that time, of materials, yeah.
Q. Those would also be primary sources, correct, newspaper articles, news reels, things from the time period that you're looking at?
A. That's correct, they are.
Q. Other than the book we discussed that you've been doing research for when we went over the document reguest, any other articles or books you're currently looking on related to smoking and health?
A. lam. And I've got to get this_
done, I'm a little bit behind. But I-- you know, let me go back to- you asked me about giving public presentations and lectures, I interpret that to mean, you know, where someone flies me out to give a public lecture, you know, it's given in person.
But I am giving a paper, as part of a scholarly conference, in November at the History of Science Society. And I'm working on a paper right now on that that's looking at the tobacco industry's use of structural science methodologies in direct attempt to understand why smokers begin smoking or smoking behavior, smoking psychology, if you will.
Q. Do you have a draft of that paper?
A. No. But when I write it I'll happily give it to you.
Q. Is that something you're writing with somebody else?
A. No. It's just myself.
Q. Where is the conference that you'll present the paper; where is that?
A. I think it's somewhere in Arizona but I can't remember where. It's in mid
November.
Q. Is that a conference that's looking at other tobacco issues, or it's looking at all kinds of issues and you just happen to be writing on it because it's related to tobacco?
A. Exactly, the latter. It's a--History of Science Society is a broad- it's just that, history of science, and I'm giving a paper on this particular subject.
But, I mean, I haven't looked at the program, but based on previous programs, they'll have everything, you know. It's a broad conference where historians of science congregate and present their work.
Q. After you present the paper at the conference, will it be published in a book of the conference?
A. I don't think so. I'm-I'm intending this to be a chapter in my own work.
Q. So it will be a chapter of the book that you're working on?
A. That's right.
Q. Any other articles or books or_
book chapters that you're working on related to tobacco smoking and health?
A. That's what I'm doing right now, nothing else.
Q. Now, you've also presented at conferences to plaintiffs lawyers who sue tobacco companies, correct?
A. I did that one time, yes.
Q. And that was the Tobacco Products Liability Project conference in 2003, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. And the title of that conference was Learning from Wins and Losses?
A. That was the title of it.
Q. And that referred to wins and losses in the courtroom, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Specifically, it was referring to wins and losses by plaintiffs in lawsuits against the cigarette companies, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you know the purpose of that conference was to encourage lawsuits against tobacco companies?
.....MR. GDANSKI:.............................................................................
Object to the form.
A. Yes. The Public Health Advocacy Institute which is the overarching organization for which the Tobacco Products Liability conference subsumed- you know, sees litigation as a form of health advocacy, yes.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Is that how you view litigation that you're involved in, as a form of public health public advocacy?
A. I mean, litigation is a crude, expensive, highly inefficient tool or phenomenon and I think that the litigation that resulted in the release of the tobacco industry documents and that complex story has been one of the most important developments in public health in modern American history. It's just remarkable.
So to the- to the extent, in that case, there have been definite public health benefits because of the- we've got the creation of this huge documentary record in the tobacco industry which has helped not just historians like myself, you know._
uncover the past, but has allowed, you know, contemporary public health professionals to advance the, you know, goals of society in which there are fewer deaths and serious illnesses to tobacco. It took a lot to advance that.
So in that regard, yeah, it has benefitted public health. That's as far as I can go, you know. Litigation is-- is a complex phenomenon, is my answer.
Q. Do you view your role in this litigation as a public health advocate?
A. No. Me personally, no. I'm simply here, you know, reporting my research and my professional knowledge on this particular subject.
Q. This conference that we're talking about, the Tobacco Product Liability conference you attended in 2003, the Tobacco Liability- the Tobacco Product Liability conference is limited to plaintiffs lawyers and public health advocates, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. I believe that's what-well, I
guess that's what they- that was their intended audience, yes. They had some language related to that in there. I mean, not every lawyer there, or expert, works only for plaintiffs in all litigation.
Because I'm wondering, actually, that's not a statement, that's a question.
But I know that Allan Feingold who was listed on the program who's testified as an expert witness in tobacco litigation also testifies in other litigation. So I guess it could go either way.
MS. BROWN:
Q. But one thing we can agree on is that excluded from participation in the Tobacco Product Liability conference are experts or lawyers who are involved in the defense of tobacco litigation, correct?
A. Well, that's true. And I signed a document stating that I would not work for the tobacco industry for three years. And the reason for that was lawyers from the United States Department of Justice were there to discuss the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization trial against vour
client on behalf of our government.
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I know that you say that that's why you signed that affidavit, but isn't it the case the Tobacco Product Liability conference has always required participants to sign affidavits saying they will not work for the tobacco industry or in defense of the tobacco industry in these cases?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form. I don't know how he can possibly answer as to what-A. I've only been to one meeting. I can only speak to the meeting that I attended.
MS. BROWN:
Let me have marked the next exhibit-MR. GDANSKI:
What are you marking?
MS. BROWN:
Hold on, Jonathan.
Q. You are aware, aren't you, Dr. Kyriakoudes, that the Tobacco Product .....Liability conference was something that had.......
taken place on an annual basis before you attended in 2003, right?
A. Well, I believe the one that I attended was listed as the 20th meeting of it, if I recall, but I have not attended prior or subsequent meetings.
Q. The fact that was called the 20th meeting would be a pretty good indication that 19 other times that conference had taken place; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you have no basis for concluding that at the other 19 conferences participants weren't asked to sign the very same affidavit that you signed, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. You know, I wouldn't know either way.
MR. GDANSKI:
Dr. Kyriakoudes has no way of knowing what was done at the meetings that he did not attend by an organization he does not represent.
MS. BROWN:_
Thank you, Jonathan. I think before you answered the question for Dr. Kyriakoudes he had answered the question already.
MR. GDANSKI:
Did you just mark an exhibit a few moments ago?
MS. BROWN:
I haven't yet. I'll tell you when I do and what it is.
Let's mark as next in order, which I think we're up to 5, this document which is printed from the Tobacco Product Liability conference website and lists the conferences that have been held over the years.
(Exhibit 5 was marked.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you have been handed what's been marked as Exhibit Number 5 and you see that that lists a number of conferences. At the top it says 21st Conference and it continues all the way down to the 1st Conference, correct?
A. Yes. I see that.
Q. And you see 20th Conference is, in fact, the conference you told us you attended, Learning from Wins and Losses, in September of 2003, correct?
A. That is listed on here.
Q. Again, as we had already supposed, based on the fact that was Number 20, there are 19 before that that are listed on this document, correct?
A. Yes. That's true. That's why I told you it was the 20th.
Q. And if we look at Number 14 on the list, the 14th Conference, Three Ways to Beat Big Tobacco, that was held October 30th to November 1st, '98. Did I read that one correctly?
A. You read that correctly.
MS. BROWN:
Could we get this marked as next in order, Exhibit Number 6.
(Exhibit 6 was marked.)
MR. GDANSKI:
What's that y'all are marking?
MS. BROWN:
_What we're marking as Exhibit_
Number 6 is the 14th TPLP-
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, we can agree TPLP means Tobacco Liability Project-
A. Project.
Q. So the 14th TPLP Conference Registration Form. Is that what it says at the top?
A. Yes.
Q. And, then, below that it says Friday evening, October 30th to Sunday, November 1, 1998, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. And if you look back at this list of conferences, when you look at the 14th Conference, those are the dates of the 14th Conference, right, October 30 to November 1, 1998?
A. That's right.
Q. Then, Doctor, the registration form has a box to the right of each registration blank, correct, a box that says note? Rght here, these boxes?
A. I'm sorry, I was looking for, like, an empty box. I see that, okay.
..............Q......Can you read the contents of t hat...............
box for me?
A. No. I'm not--you can read it and I'll ascertain whether you read it correctly.
Q. Well, no, why don't you go ahead and read it, Dr. Kyriakoudes?
MR. GDANSKI:
It's not his document. He didn't write it; he didn't author it. I'm not sure the purpose of him reading it.
A. I'm not going to read it.
MS. BROWN:
Q. You're opposed to reading the contents of that box?
A. You can read it and- yeah.
Q. Is there a reason you're opposed to reading the contents of that box?
A. You know, I've been deposed many times, and there used to be this little project where they would get me to read things on the camera and, then, they would snip those out and present them as- as my words.
So if you're trying to ascertain the correct text of the box, bv all means._
read it and I'll ascertain whether you have read it correctly. But, you know -
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, there's no camera in this room, is there?
MR. GDANSKI:
There's no difference between you reading it, Jenny. I think you can go ahead and read it.
MS. BROWN:
I agree with you, Jonathan, I don't think there is any difference.
MR. GDANSKI:
Right. So if Dr. Kyriakoudes is reading it, you know, intending to interpret it as he's reading them his words perhaps, to save for any ambiguity at all, I think it makes the most sense for you to read it in the record. If there's some discrepancy in reading of it, then he can point that out.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Well, just because I don't want to spend a great deal of time continuing to debate this, I'll go ahead and read it and you can tell me if I read it accurately, Dr. Kyriakoudes, although I do have to sav I'm
not sure I understand your concern in reading it.
But just so we're all clear, I'm now reading from the registration form for the 14th TPLP Conference that would be dated October 30th through Sunday, November 1st, 1998.
And the note says, "note, registration is limited to individuals interested in tobacco control. Registrants will be required to sign affidavits that they do not and will not work for the tobacco industry".
Did I read that correctly, Dr.
Kyriakoudes?
A. You did, yes.
Q. And, so, 1998 at the 14th TPLP Conference, the very same type of affidavit that you had to execute in 2003 was required of participants for this conference, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. November 1998, that would be prior to the filing of any lawsuit by the Department of Justice, correct?_
A. Well, you don't know and I don't know whether or not there were people from the Department of Justice there to discuss perhaps strategy or intentions to file lawsuits.
And if you're not familiar with the history of this, it really goes back to mid '90s and the Clinton Administration where there was a long discussion as to whether to file, first, a criminal complaint against your client and to include law firms. Do you work for Shook, Hardy and Bacon?
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I'll ask the questions in this deposition.
And one of my questions to you is you don't have any basis for concluding that the reason for asking for an affidavit to this effect, one that was asked for and has been asked for at the TPLP conferences, is related in any way to the participation of any lawyers from DOJ at the conference, correct?
MR GDANSKI:
......................Object to the question so far as....................
the reason that the organization that Dr. Kyriakoudes did not work for requested individuals to sign affidavits is wholly immaterial to the case. Why Dr. Kyriakoudes chose to sign the affidavit at the meeting may be material. And to the extent he can talk about that, he can. But I'm not sure what you're asking and I'm not sure where you're going, Jenny.
MS. BROWN:
Q. I'm simply asking, and I'll ask it again, Dr. Kyriakoudes, you have no basis whatsoever, do you, for concluding that the reason, in November 1998, participants at this conference were asked to complete an affidavit that they would not and will not--do not and will not work for the tobacco industry had anything to do with the Department of Justice or the lawsuit that hadn't been filed yet, correct?
MR GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Either way, you don't know yes or no. And I didn't attend that conference.
All I can attest to affirmatively is that_
the conference I attended, that was the reason for the affidavit at that particular conference.
MS. BROWN:
Q. In fact, Dr. Kyriakoudes, you have no idea if that was the reason for the affidavit at that particular conference; you just know that you attended that conference and you were asked to sign that affidavit, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. No. I inquired about this and that was explained to me.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Who explained it to you, Dr. Kyriakoudes?
A. The person who was manning the registration desk when I walked up to the-to the conference prior to giving my talk.
Q. And who was that?
A. I can't remember.
Q. Was it a person associated with the conference?
A. Yeah. There was a person there
running the desk. You signed in or, you know, got your little name tag, you know, like- like any other conference that you go to.
Q. Doctor, I'm going to hand you what we're going to mark the next exhibit in order.
(Exhibit 7 was marked.)
MS. BROWN:
Jonathan, for your purposes, this is a printout from the Internet from the TPLP site. It talks about Upcoming Conference in Miami 2007 and the title of the conference is Their Day in Court: How to try and win tobacco cases following the Florida Supreme Court's Engle decision.
Did I read that correctly, Doctor?
A. Yes.
Q. Doctor, did you attend this conference?
A. No. I did not.
Q. This conference was about the Engle decision, which this is an Engle Progeny case, the Barbanell case, correct?
A. That's correct._
Q. Doctor, if you turn to Rage 4 of this printout?
A. I see.
Q. This is a list of speakers and panelists at this conference, correct?
A. Speakers and panelists include, yes. It's a list of speakers.
Q. In fact, it's a list of several plaintiffs lawyers that you have done work for in the Engle Progeny litigation, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Yes. I see some familiar names here.
MS. BROWN:
Q. For example, Howard Acosta, you know Mr. Acosta, right?
A. Yes.
Q. You have worked with him?
A. I have- I have testified in cases in which he's been the attorney, that's true.
Q. Michael Piuze, do you know Michael .....Piuze?..............................................................................................
A. Yes. I was deposed in one of his cases.
Q. So you worked with Michael Piuze in one of his lawsuits in California?
A. That's correct.
Q. Woody Wilner, you're very well acquainted with Mr. Wilner, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. I worked on a case- I testified in a case in which Mr. Wilner was the attorney, yes, or one of the attorneys.
MS. BROWN:
Q. And David Sales; you know David Sales from the Searcy firm, right?
A. Right. He- I was deposed in a case, in which he's one of the attorneys, just a few weeks ago.
Q. And you also have done work with Matt Schultz who has- his firm's brought some Engle Progeny cases, correct?
A. That's true. I testified in a case, as you well know, the Martin case back in May.
Q. Anyone else on here that you've_
testified for?
A. Michael London. There was a case in 2003 in the late fall. I'm forgetting the name, but that was in Brooklyn.
Q. That was a tobacco case?
A. Tobacco case. No other people that I have been involved in litigation where they were the attorney involved in the case.
Q. Doctor, if we flip to the next page, you see the 22nd Conference of the Tobacco Products Liability Project at the top, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Then the name of the conference, Their Day in Court: How to try and win tobacco cases following the Florida Supreme Court Engle decision. Do you see that?
A. I see that.
Q. Again, this is an affidavit very much like the one you signed in 2003, right?
A. Do you have a copy of the old one? It might be. It's been a long time since I saw that one.
MS. BROWN:
If we could mark this as the next deposition exhibit.
Jonathan, this is the affidavit that Dr. Kyriakoudes signed in 2003.
(Exhibit 8 was marked.)
THE WITNESS:
Yeah, it looks pretty similar. I mean, I don't want to take up too much time, but they look pretty similar. It's laid out a little differently, but they're similar.
MS. BROWN:
Q. But they both have eight paragraphs, right?
A. Yeah.
Q. And they both, in Number 4, say I and any firm for which I'm working, am not currently retained by, and hereby commit myself and my firm not to take as a client any defendant in a tobacco case before, and then it has different time periods because of the difference in the timing of the affidavits, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. So the substance of the affidavits is basically identical?_
A. Yeah. I'll agree with you on that.
Q. Again, as you flip through these materials, on the next page, Dr.
Kyriakoudes -A. Are we looking at the conference that I didn't attend again?
Q. Yes. This is the agenda for the 2007 conference where the identical affidavit was required. This is a conference about the Engle case, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Let me read it. Yes. It deals with the Rorida Supreme Court's Engle decision.
MS. BROWN:
Q. So, again, not a discussion with DOJ attorneys but a discussion of the Engle lawsuit and with attorneys that have brought the Engle lawsuit, correct?
A. Yes. Again, correct for the conference which I have not attended.
Q. Rght. So this affidavit was .....asked for in conferences before the one you.........
attended, was asked for in conferences after the one you attended, and those conferences, as far as you know, had nothing to do with the DOJ lawsuit, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. All I know is that the one I attended, that was-- I mean, I didn't attend that talk. I attended the talk where I gave a speech, but that was part of the one that I attended. That's all I - all I know.
Everything else is stuff you have pulled together.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you had testified, and I think you've mentioned you testified about the fact that you signed this affidavit on numerous occasions in prior lawsuits, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Can you repeat the question? I didn't hear that part.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you have discussed in testimony in prior cases this_
affidavit that you signed in 2003, correct?
A. Yeah. You've asked me about it a number of times.
Q. And it's really only been in the last handful of times that you have pinned your signing of it to the presence of DOJ attorneys, correct?
A. I'm not sure I- I would have to review my testimony on that, so I don't know. I mean, I can't remember.
Q. So you have no reason to dispute that the first few times you were asked about this affidavit you never mentioned the DOJ lawsuit?
A. Well, you know, I'm not always-you know, sometimes you ask me these questions and I just have to give a yes or no answer. I mean, it's- you know, I don't know what- I can't remember what my testimony was on this particular thing. I can only talk about what I know.
Maybe if you've pulled it together you can help me refresh my memory. I don't certainly have that testimony in my files so I couldn't ao back to my computer and look
up what I said in the past.
Q. Is the reason that you now testify that the reason you signed the 2003 affidavit for the DOJ suit in order to get in front of this jury that the DOJ filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. No. You know, I mean, you put that up, you know, and it's entitled to an explanation. That's all- that's all it is.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Have you attended any other conferences held by the TPLP?
A. No, I've never. I've only attended that one.
Q. Going back to your supplement of newspaper articles and magazines from The Miami Herald from the 1950s, it is not your intention to suggest to The Jury that those 29 articles and 11 advertisements represent the totality of articles about smoking and health and the dangers of smoking published in The Miami Herald in the 1950s, correct?
MR GDANSKI:_
Object to the form.
A. No. That would- well, I agree you are correct, that is not my intention.
MS. BROWN:
Q. In fact, there are hundreds of articles that were published in The Miami Herald in the 1950s that addressed cigarettes and issues of the dangers of smoking, correct?
A. That's right. And, in fact, your- your experts have, you know, researched those as part of their reliance documents and, you know, I've, in other cases, been forwarded those documents. So, you know, there's no point redoing that.
Q. Well, explain to me again how it is you selected these articles, these 29 articles, out of all of those hundreds of articles that were available.
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form. Asked and answered. He's already explained.
A. Now, your- again, what I said this morning was I pulled a list of dates .....and little phrases of what I thought were.................
the most significant national level stories that appeared in The New York Times on the issue of smoking and health and asked research assistants to see if these appeared in this local paper.
MS. BROWN:
Q. When you say and little phrases, what do you mean little phrases?
A. Okay. If you have ever had an occasion to look at the computer files on my New York Times directory that I've supplied to you guys, I have a little phrase that has a file name; I usually put the date and little file name that gives a sense to what the story is about. So I simply cut and pasted those file names.
And when the file name was ambiguous, I added a little phrase, explanation, just so that the researcher would have something to go on as he was looking for these stories in The Miami Herald.
So, again, I wasn't interested-the research task was not what appeared in The Miami Herald, which would be, you know,
read the whole Miami Herald. It was to what extent this set of stories that appeared in The New York Times appear in the-- in this particular paper.
Q. Well I'm- I want to talk about some of the articles that are in that supplement, okay?
A. Sure.
MS. BROWN:
If we could mark as the next exhibit this one, which I think we're up to
9,	right, as Exhibit Number 9.
(Exhibit 9 was marked.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, this is an article from the supplement we were provided in your Miami Herald articles in the 1950s, and the headline is Bargain Smokers To Get Tax Bill?
A. Yes.
Q. And this is from July 20, 1954?
A. That's right.
Q. Why did you select this article out of all the articles in The Miami Herald?
A. Again, and this is ongoing, my
research assistant, this is just one that he copied. This is not a case of one that appeared in The New York Times. It's not really anything that's relevant to this case. It's a tax issue about differential excised rates for cigarettes.
You know, he- he copied a few things, I guess; you know, I haven't spoken with him since these were delivered. It's just one that he copied. And I just simply forwarded what he copied, added to the pile.
Q. So the supplement- supplement that you provided, The Miami Herald articles as reliance materials for this case, you haven't reviewed to see if, in fact, any of your opinions are going to be based in the articles in that supplement; is that correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, I mean, in this one, I mean, this one, I just added, you know, to my materials. And maybe this is where you're thinking reliance materials and that they are specifically relevant to this particular_
case and that- I mean, this one isn't.
It's just- I basically give you guys- you know, when I come up with new stuff I just give it to you, you know, as part of your request.
So this one- I mean, I'm not intending to discuss the tax- excised tax issue in the Barbanell case, so don't worry about that.
MS. BROWN:
Let's mark- this is another document from the supplemental reliance list. If we could mark that as the next exhibit.
(Exhibit 10 was marked.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. Doctor, I'm going to hand you what's been marked Deposition Exhibit- is it 10 we're up to?
A. Yes, Number 10.
Q. Number 10. And the headline is Five Qgaret Firms Sued, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. And I think the file you provided .....us has the date on the file names, so I'm..............
going to represent to you that based on that file name this is dated June 28th, 1954?
A. Right. That's okay.
Q. Can you tell me why this article was selected for your supplement?
A. The same reason that the other one was included in there, I just simply took the materials that my assistant came up with and forwarded them to you. I haven't been selective in that-in that sense.
I don't intend to use- this doesn't influence any opinion that I have in the case. I think he copied this because he thought it was interesting. But I don't- I wouldn't show this to The Jury; probably couldn't show it to The Jury. The Judge would probably not let me because it's off the litigation stuff.
Yeah, this is just in my research materials. And it's just always been my practice- at least the thing I do like about the process of American litigation is the- everybody puts their cards on the table, so to speak, so that each side has the opportunity to make its strongest case.
So I believe very much in just giving you, you know, all my stuff and not selecting or- in the like. But, yeah, so this one, we can- these kind of off-subject topics, we can go through these pretty quick. And I'm not going to use that in the trial.
Q. Well, maybe I don't need to mark this one but tell me if I do because you want to take a look at it. The headline is More Money to go up in Smoke. And it starts out, Smokers who buy their cigarettes from vending machines will be dropping 30 cents in the slots for the privilege of puffing.
Is that an article that you plan to rely upon to give any opinions in the Barbanell case?
A. Not really. I mean, only if I'm asked a question were there vending machines back in the day, you know, I would say yes, there were vending machines. But I don't need that article to establish that. And the date on that one- that one was from the 1950s.
Q. 1955. Sov again, not really
relevant to your opinions in Barbanell, just something your research assistant copied?
A. That's right. Yes.
MS. BROWN:
We can mark this as the next
exhibit.
(Exhibit 11 was marked.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, this is another article from your 1950s Miami Herald supplement. I'll represent to you that the file name on this had the date as January
10,	1954 and the headline is Ggaret Ads Paved Way for Hullabaloo. Is that what it says?
A. Yes.
Q. And this is a column by columnist Jack- I don't know if you know how to pronounce his last name, but Kofoed or -A. That's how I would pronounce it, but I don't have any special knowledge on his pronunciation. I'm with you on trying to figure that one out.
Q. And I'm assuming, again- because you provided this date to vour assistant._
maybe that's why he pulled this, but I'm wondering how this column by Mr. Kofoed forms a basis for any of your opinions in the Barbanell case?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, this one is a little bit more substantial than the other- other examples that we've talked about in the sense that it's an example of editorial discussion of the cigarette and health debate as was in the news in that early month, or January of 1954.
It's got a good use of slang, you know. It's just part of what people were talking about in the press.
Q. Okay. If we go down to the third paragraph, "Qgaret Manufacturers are principally responsible for the fear wave.
Each in his advertising claimed his product contained less tar or nicotine, or otherwise was less harmful than the competitors. The belief was forced upon the public that any cigaret will hurt you, but one less so than .....another",........................................................................................
Did I read that correctly?
A. Yes.
Q. It's Mr. Kofoed's opinion that the tobacco companies themselves, through their advertising, were creating the fear wave in smokers about cigarette smoking and health, correct?
A. Yeah. That's what he says, yes.
MS. BROWN:
Mark that.
(Exhibit 12 was marked.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. Doctor, I've marked as the next deposition exhibit, which is Number 12, an article from your supplement headlined Study Links Lung Cancer To Smoking, and it starts "The British Medical Journal said Friday a four-year study showed death from lung cancer increases as tobacco smoking increases", correct?
A. That's right.
Q. And I'll represent to you that your file name listed the date for this as December 13, 1952.
_This would be an example of the_
kinds of studies you said you were looking for in The Miami Herald; is that right?
A. That's right.
Q. If we go down, I think the seventh paragraph, it starts out, similar studies.
Do you see that?
A. Yes.
Q. It says, "similar studies carried out recently in the United States reached much the same general conclusion", right?
A. That's right?
Q. If you look through this article,
Doctor, do you see any comment by anyone in the tobacco industry?
A. No, not in this one.
Q. So this would be an example of an article reporting on the dangers of cigarette smoking without any kind of industry comment at all, correct?
A. That's correct.
MS. BROWN:
Now, if we could mark this as next in order.
Q. This is another article from your 1950s Miami Herald supplement.
(Exhibit 13 was marked.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. Doctor, what's been marked as Deposition Exhibit 13 is-- the headline is New Studies Link Smoking and Cancer, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. And I'll represent to you the file name on this document indicates that it's dated May 19, 1954, okay?
A. That's right. That sounds right.
Q. As you look through this article that starts out, A leading cancer specialist said Tuesday completely September studies in Britain and the United States show, quote,
"a very definite statistical relationship between excessive smoking and cancer of the lung".
As you look through this article, you do not see any comment from anybody-anyone from the tobacco industry, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Here's another article from your supplement, Doctor.
MS. BROWN:_
If we can get it marked as Exhibit Number 14.
(Exhibit 14 was marked.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. This one has a headline Qgaret Paper Suggested as Lung Cancer Cause, correct, Doctor?
A. That's right.
Q. Now, this one discusses research finding benzpyrene in the smoke from cigarette paper, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. And it talks about the fact that benzpyrene had proved to be one of the most powerful cancer-producing agents in animals and that more research is needed to know if that causes cancer in humans, correct?
A. That's right, you read that correct.
Q. Again, do you see any comment in this article from anyone associated with the tobacco industry?
A. No, not in this one.
Q. Doctor, you would agree as time .....wentonthetobaccoindustry'syie^	........
represented less and less in articles having to do with the dangers of smoking, correct? MR. GDANSKI:
Object to form.
A. Yeah, unbalanced. I've said this before, after the Surgeon General's report, especially.
MS. BROWN:
Q. In fact, I think you testified before that you can't identify a single article since 1964 that presented the public with only the tobacco industry's view on the risks of smoking, correct?
A. I- I haven't seen one that only talks about the industry without- I mean, the standard journalistic convention is to provide both sides of a debate. So, sure, you know, I haven't seen anything that violates that- that principal.
Q. And after 1964, the media, in large part, quit getting the comment of the tobacco industry at all, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form A. Well, it depends. You know, the
news cycle is driven by- by the research which creates news in and by policy changes which create news. So when there are new findings, particularly when you expand to other diseases or to other categories of harm, then the industry does get- get a hearing.
So, for example, when the addiction issue becomes big news at or around the time of the 1988 Surgeon General's report released in the spring of that year, the industry does, again, get-get a lot of attention in the press.
MS. BROWN:
Q. But there's no dispute, is there, Doctor, that after 1964 the public health community and their position really dominated the media coverage of issues dealing with smoking and health?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. I would agree on news stories, the public health community is getting the message out through news stories. But, of course, that's iust one component of the
information stream. But, yes, in that particular area, I would agree with you, yes.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Now, you agreed earlier that there are lots more stories in The Miami Herald on the risks of smoking than the ones that are represented in your supplement, correct?
A. Right. I just delivered the first round of investigation to you from my assistant. I have- you know, a few of these myself, as well, waiting for them to arrive-
So, yes, there are much more. And I've reviewed many, not all, of the stories in some of the reliance materials. I don't know who the historian is in this case, but in other cases I've got reliance materials that cover the Miami newspapers.
Q. I thought you told us earlier that as far as the 1950s went and the comparison you were doing in The New York Times articles to The Miami Herald, that you're basically done with the '50s, maybe 1959 still remains to be done, but you're_
basically done with the '50s?
A. Well, I mean, you know, I've hired research assistants to put a few hours into this who got me these documents just, like, a week ago. I mean, so, I - for him, I've given him some future stories for the 1960s. That's what I would say, he's going to continue working to the 1960s.
But I didn't say I was done in the '50s. If I did, I didn't mean for you to think that I was completely done. That means for research. For the purposes of this case and, you know, you have one shot at the deposition, I respect that and I understand that, so I'm not going to- what you're talking about really doesn't apply to this case, it applies to a broader research effort that I'm engaged in.
Q. For purposes of this case, you're done with your review of the 1950s in The Miami Herald?
A. For this case, I'm done, right.
(Exhibit 15 was marked.)
MS. BROWN:
..............Q......Doctor. I've handed you what I'll..............
represent to you is an article from The Miami Herald dated July 18, 1950 that appeared on Page 16-B of that newspaper, okay?
A. Yes.
Q. And that's Deposition Exhibit Number 15. The headline is Smoking Blamed in Lung Cancers, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And it starts out "three teams of scientists Monday blamed smoking, especially cigarets, for apparently causing part of the increase in lung cancer, the fastest growing type of cancer in the United Sates", correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. So this is an article that your research assistant did not copy and send to you, correct?
A. That's correct. Although this article is in The New York Times.
Q. If you look through this article,
Doctor, do you see any comments from anyone associated with the tobacco industry?
A. No, I don't. I don't._
Q. You can put that one aside.
MS. BROWN:
And mark this one as next in
order.
(Exhibit 16 was marked.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. Doctor, I've handed you, as Deposition Exhibit Number 16, an article from The Miami Herald dated March 18, 1954. This appeared on the first page of the newspaper. And the headline is Early Rnding Backs Qgaret-Cancer Link. Did I read that correctly?
A. Yes.
Q. And the first paragraph says, "the American Cancer Society Wednesday night for the first time cautiously voiced its suspicion that cigaret smoking has something to do with lung cancer".
Did I read that correctly?
A. Yes.
Q. Again, this is another article that didn't appear in your supplement, correct?
A. That's right. I mean. I've got-
I've got these in reliance documents that I've collected. I mean, you know, I don't need to redo what- what y'all, your experts, have done, in that. There's no point to that.
But, yes, I've- I've seen this story. And this also is one that was over the AP wires. It's a good one.
Q. And it's another one that doesn't contain any comment from the tobacco industry, correct?
A. Rght. But, you know- you know, it interviews Charles Cameron of the American Cancer Society who says their research is inconclusive, and its advice to people that smoke is just be moderate, which is a common message from that time period.
Q. But he's not associated with the tobacco industry, right?
A. No. He's American Cancer Society.
Q. So, again, this is an article with no comment from anyone associated with the tobacco industry, correct?
A. That's true.
Q. And you know, based on your review
of- you said our historian's reliance materials, that there are lots more articles in The Miami Herald in the 1950s that address the dangers of cigarette smoking?
A. That's correct.
Q. No dispute about it?
A. No. As I've said many times, it was a big story.
Q. Let's look at just one more,
Doctor. This is an article from The Miami Herald dated December 2nd, 1955.
MS. BROWN:
If we could get that marked as the next exhibit.
(Exhibit 17 was marked.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. This is marked Deposition Exhibit Number-
A. 17.
Q. - 17, and the headline is Lung Ruptures Tied To Cigaret Smoking, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And it goes on to say, "cigarette smoking, widely blamed for lung cancer, may .....be even more hazardous than has been...................
hitherto recognized, four doctors said here Thursday.
The physicians said in a report to the ninth clinical meeting of the American Medical Association that cigarette smoking may be the cause of many cases of an ailment called pulmonary emphysema, rupture of tiny air sacs in the lung".
Did I read that correctly?
A. Yes.
Q. So this is an article from The Miami Herald that addresses emphysema as one of the health consequences of cigarette smoking, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. Again, if you look through this article, Doctor, you don't see any comment from anyone associated with the tobacco industry, right?
A. Rght. This is another case of the wire services, you know. Again, it's a national story. It was on the national wires.
Q. Does the fact that it's on the national wires tell you something about_
whether there's going to be an industry comment in it or not?
A. No. It just points out that it's a national issue and the research on smoking and health was of national interest so the wire services picked up those stories.
Q. Now, in your Miami Herald supplement you also included about a dozen cigarette ads, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you included ads for Winston, and Parliament, and Old Gold, and Herbert Tareyton and L&M brand cigarettes, among others, correct?
A. That's right.
MR. GDANSKI:
Jenny, I don't mean to interrupt, we've been going almost two hours without a break.
MS. BROWN:
And I promised you a break. I forgot, Dr. Kyriakoudes, I'm sorry. We can take a break right here.
(Off the record.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. I think I'm going to pick up and repeat my last question. I'm repeating my last question just so we're on the same topic, okay.
You included ads for Winston,
Parliament, Old Gold, Herbert Tareyton and L&M brand cigarettes in your supplement for The Miami Herald, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Shirley Barbanell didn't smoke those brands of cigarettes, did she?
A. There's some ambiguous information or discussion of Parliaments. But, again, just to go back to what I said earlier, you know, I simply received those materials and just threw them on the pile. I did not select those intentionally to reflect on the Barbanell case.
Q. And I assume the same would be true of the Philip Morris brand advertising that, in your supplement, you didn't select those particular Philip Morris brand ads for use in the Barbanell case, would that be true?
A. That's right. Although I believe_
that Mr. Barbanell mentions the Philip Morris-- the last call for Philip Morris in there.
If asked about Philip Morris brand, I would probably- I mean, I wouldn't show that ad anyway. I would probably rely on what I used as an exhibit in the past, like maybe the I love Lucy/Desi commercial or some of the print ads I've used which are included in my reliance.
MS. BROWN:
Just so we're clear coming out of this deposition, I'm going to go ahead and mark as next exhibit- we'll just mark both Philip Morris brand ads as one exhibit.
Q. These were the only two Philip Morris brand ads I think that were in your supplement.
(Exhibit 18 was marked.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. If you don't mind, Doctor, what I handed you has the date handwritten on it. Again, I took that from your file name.
These two Philip Morris brand
.....advertisement^	.......
plan to talk about in the Barbanell case, these two specifically?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. No. I don't intend to deal with those ads.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Just so the record is clear, that was Deposition Exhibit Number-
A. 18.
Q. - 18, was the two Philip Morris brand ads in the supplement.
Now, Doctor, Shirley Barbanell didn't live in Rorida in the '50s, did she?
A. No.
Q. So there really isn't any question that Shirley Barbanell didn't see any of these articles or advertisements as they were published in The Miami Herald, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. If she saw the substance of any of these articles, she was more likely to have seen those as they would have been published in The New York Times?
MR. GDANSKI:_
Object to the form.
A. Either The Times or some other New York newspaper.
MS. BROWN:
Q. New York Post or one of the other New York papers, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. So it's not your expectation that Shirley Barbanell, living in New York in the 1950s, was perusing The Miami Herald, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Now, she did live in Florida from 1960 to 1965, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. But, so far, you haven't completed research of any Miami Herald articles during that time frame, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Then she moved back to New York after 1965, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Then in 1982, '83 she returned to Rorida and lived there the rest of her life, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. Again, we don't have and there aren't any Miami Herald or southern Rorida papers on your reliance list dated 1982, '83 or later, correct?
A. Yes, on my reliance list. I pulled, in one of my trials this spring from defense reliance, a couple of stories from 1988, March of '88, discussing the Surgeon General's report that was released that year.
Q. From what paper did you pull those?
A. I believe I-- it was the Ft.
Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel and The Miami Herald paper. That was from defense. I think that might have even been a defense exhibit that I had reviewed, a formal exhibit as opposed to a reliance document in that particular case.
Q. Do you recall what case that was?
A. It was with Gary Page and it was called Sherman.
Q. Beyond those 1988 articles that you pulled from the defense exhibits, have_
you looked at the Ft. Lauderdale paper in any systematic way?
A. I have not.
Q. You know that Leon Barbanell testified that he and Shirley subscribed to the Ft. Lauderdale paper, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. So why wouldn't you want to look at the Ft. Lauderdale paper and do kind of the same- at least, at a minimum, the same type of analysis of that paper that you're doing of The Miami Herald?
A. Again, you know, I put a low value on this. It's a national story. This was-for South Florida, I thought I would attack the first paper that had the largest circulation. And The Miami Herald is a larger paper than the Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel.
Q. Did Gary Page suggest that you tackle The Miami Herald first?
A. Well, as I said earlier, you know, a lot of this was driven by looking at The Miami Herald, which is ongoing, driven by the particular circumstances of litigation...................
with Larry Page, that's true. So we discussed it, and I suggested it, and he said that's probably a good idea.
Q. So but for Mr. Page's concerns that your testimony might be struck by The Court if it didn't include some Rorida papers, you wouldn't look at any Rorida newspapers for your testimony, correct?
A. Well, I think that's- yeah, in the sense that, you know, as I've testified many times, you know, The New York Times is representative of national coverage information that I don't give- you know, I don't give a particular- kind of linking a particular individual to a particular story.
So I'm dealing with information on a national level. And the newspaper is just one of many magazines, television, radio and the like. So it's- that's reasonable.
Q. I think you've testified in earlier cases that you would expect to see some regional variation in the coverage on smoking and health issues, correct?
A. Well, I was very specific about that. That was in a deposition back in_
March or so. I think that was in the Martin deposition which I- we had that discussion.
And to reprise and clarify that, you know, there- we talked about this earlier, there might be a local doctor that has his own local column in the local paper and he would opine or discuss smoking and health issues when it was relevant, you know, to how- how he wanted to run or publish in his column.
But that was true of lots of other newspapers. It would be a different columnist, different local doctor who would write for this. Yeah, there's some variations. There's variations in everything.
But my testimony has been, generally, you know, the major stories that were picked up by the wire services, UPI, AP and the like, and it's a national issue and it's covered nationally.
Q. Could there be variation in the volume of information related to smoking and health that is reported in different regions?
A. Volume, the volume would be- I think the variable would not be so much location, in my experience, in looking at other papers as much as it is the paper's size. Big city newspapers are going to have simply more news because it's got a larger circulation and more resources.
Again, we're dealing here with the '50s and '60s. And a smaller town newspaper is going to have less news because they don't have the same resources. AP, UPI, other news and other news services are expensive, you have to pay for these.
So, you know, there's some variation, not so much, in this case, regional as much as it is scale and scope of the paper itself.
Q. Shirley Barbanell was living in the Ft. Lauderdale area, as you said, from 1960 to 1965, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. So she would have been living in that area when the 1964 Surgeon General's report was released and publicized, correct?
A. That's correct._
Q. But you haven't looked at the Ft. Lauderdale paper to see what kind of coverage there was in that paper on the '64 Surgeon General's report, right?
A. Well, I've reviewed the defense reliance materials for that period and it's covered. It's a big story as it was, you know, nationally.
Q. When you looked at the defense reliance materials or defense exhibits to see how the Ft. Lauderdale paper covered the 1964 Surgeon General's report, did you notice whether they ran a series of articles leading up to and forecasting the Surgeon General's report?
A. Every paper I've looked at, you know- I mean, the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General was news from the point that the committee was founded or begun in 1962 and, periodically, over the course of this period. So the release of the Surgeon General's report was a climax to a growing news story, that's true.
I don't remember exactly which .....storieslead^	.......................
paper I've looked at, there are a number of stories.
Q. So in the papers you've looked at, you've seen stories that said the Surgeon General's report is coming and this is what we anticipate is going to be concluded in the Surgeon General's report, correct?
A. Some stories, yeah. And, I mean, they intended to be- the members of the committee intended to be mum, but, you know, the anticipation of the release of the report was a newsworthy item as well, as the report itself.
(Exhibit 19 was marked.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. Doctor, we've handed you what's been marked Deposition Exhibit- is it 19?
A. Yes.
Q. Which I'll represent to you is an article dated January 5, 1964 from the Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel. And it starts on Page 1 and the second page jumps to 16. The headline says, Paper Says U.S. Cigaret Report Grim.
_Did I read that correctly?_
A. Yes.
Q. The first paragraph says, "The Sunday London Mirror claimed today a secret U.S. Government report asserts smokers die from lung cancer at ten times the rate nonsmokers do. The Mirror stated the report says cigarets are real killers".
Did I read that right?
A. Yes.
Q. So this would be kind of in line with what you were talking about you've seen in other papers, an article that kind of lead up to the release of the Surgeon General's report?
A. Right. And this, too, it's an AP wire story.
Q. You can put that one aside,
Doctor.
MS. BROWN:
And let's mark this as Exhibit Number 20.
(Exhibit 20 was marked.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. Doctor, I've handed you Deposition Exhibit Number 20 which I'll represent to
you is an article from The Ft. Lauderdale News and Sun-Sentinel dated January 7, 1964, so a couple of days later, from Page 1.
And the headline says Saturday Unveiling Due Smoke Study. "The government plans to hand out its long-awaited report on relationship of smoking to health Saturday in an atmosphere of secrecy usually reserved for announcement which affect the stock market", correct?
A. That's right, you read it correct.
Q. And, then, if you go to the second to last paragraph of that article, it says "there seems little doubt, however, the report will conclude that there is at least statistical evidence of a link between smoking and lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema and respiratory ailments", correct?
A. Right. And the next paragraph,
"no one anticipates any move by the government to ban use of tobacco, nor any widespread move by the public to give up the habit".
Q. So this is another story, again,_
kind of a tease that this is coming up, it's big news and everybody should be watching for it?
A. Right. I mean, it was- like I said earlier, the Advisory Committee itself was a newsworthy item during the entire life of the debate, began in '62 and presented the report in the first- in the second week of '64.
MS. BROWN:
If we could mark this as Deposition Exhibit 21. Go ahead and mark this as 22.
(Exhibits 21 and 22 were marked.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. Doctor, I've handed you what's been marked Deposition Exhibit 21. And it's another article from The Ft. Lauderdale News, Sun-Sentinel, this one dated January
11,1964 from Page 1. And the headline says Report Due at 9:00 a.m., Tobacco-Cancer Data Out Today.
Did I read that correctly?
A. Yes.
..............Q.,,,,And; again, now,.Jhjs is the day.....................
the report is being released and they're reporting on the fact that today is the day, correct?
A. Right. So it's a morning paper.
Q. And this is consistent with the publicity you saw on the Surgeon General's report released in other newspapers?
A. Yes.
Q. You can go ahead and put that one aside, Doctor. And I'm handing you what's been marked Deposition Exhibit 22. This is from that same Saturday newspaper, R. Lauderdale News, dated January 11, 1964.
This is from the TV page.
And in addition to announcing the release of the report, you see the ad on the right-hand side, tonight at 7:00 on Channel 4 CBS News Extra. And it says The Report of the President's Committee on Smoking and Health. "This long-awaited report is being released for the first time this evening".
And it's promoting a news program on CBS News about the release of the report, correct?
A. Yes. I mean, I've often shown_
parts of this in trial.
Q. Right. So, again, big news getting lots of publicity, everybody is gearing up for that release?
A. Oh, yeah, the Surgeon General's report was- it was the news item of that week.
Q. Then finally, the climax we're talking about-MS. BROWN:
Let's mark this as Deposition Exhibit Number 23.
(Exhibit 23 was marked.)
MS. BROWN:
Q. Doctor, I handed you Deposition Exhibit 23. This is the front page of The R. Lauderdale News and Sun-Sentinel, dated Sunday, January 12, 1964. This is the front page article reporting on the release of the Surgeon General's report, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. And this is an article that you have reviewed before?
A. Yes. I have seen this.
Q. Again, very consistent with what
you saw reported in other newspapers on the release of the Surgeon General's report, right?
A. It was the front page on the Sunday papers, Sunday morning papers and the Saturday evening papers.
Q. And much like The New York Times, it appears that The Ft. Lauderdale News had a series of articles in this paper related to the release of the report, correct?
A. Right, discussing findings and the like, yes.
Q. Now, you recently testified in the Martin trial in Escambia County, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And I think at that trial you showed The Jury pictures of Pensacola, I think you may have shown pictures of the smoker in that case?
A. That's correct.
Q. That's more focused on the- on the smoker in his or her locale that he's done in other cases, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
_Objection._
A. That's true. Yes, just simply for historical context.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Is that something you plan to do in the Barbanell case?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form. Not sure what that question means.
A. Right now, I don't know. You know, my practice has been to go the day before the day that I testify and meet with the attorney and-MS. BROWN:
Q. So in the Martin case, the plaintiff's attorney there wanted to present your testimony with pictures of Pensacola and pictures of the smoker, correct?
A. He asked me about historical pictures of Pensacola, and ordered a book for me. And I was in Pensacola for an earlier meeting and I went to the Barnes and Noble and they have a whole section on picture books and I looked at a few.
And, you know, it was clear that the Pensacola Historical Society has a........................
significant photo archive. These are standard- standard pictures you will find in any historical archive.
You know, if you want to have what the town looked like, he was interested in that. So that's what you do, you get these big picture books, scan a picture in or go and get the original at the historical society.
Q. When you say he was interested in that, he was the plaintiff's attorney in that case?
A. Yeah, Mr. Matt Schultz.
Q. Was it Mr. Schultz's idea to incorporate pictures of the smoker in your testimony?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form. I don't know where you're going but I don't know how he could possibly know whose idea it was-MS. BROWN:
Well, Jonathan, he was sitting in a room and either it was his idea or it was somebody else's idea. So let's let Dr. Kyriakoudes answer the question._
A. I've-- I've never shown pictureswell, no, I take that back. In other cases there have been pictures of the plaintiffs and I've used that in my testimony. For example, in the second case I ever testified, you know, before a jury, a formal trial, which is called Boerner versus Brown and Williamson.
THE COURT REPORTER:
I'm sorry?
THE WITNESS:
Boerner, B-o-e-r-n-e-r. And in their materials that they had gathered, they had a wonderful picture which I was-suggested that they use, which was of the plaintiff in, like, a lunch counter situation with a bunch of other basically teenager, young-adult-aged people. It's hard to tell exactly how old they are. And I forget how old she was right now in that particular picture, smoking in a public place.
And one of the big points I've always sought to make in these situations is to explain the social context and the social
etiquette and the social processes of an earlier time related to smoking where you can smoke anywhere and everywhere.
So to that extent, visual evidence helps. I've often made that point by showing movies and other things, you know, mix it up and make it interesting.
To show Benny Ray Martin's picture, you know, we were in there, we were talking, he had some pictures of the plaintiff. I can't remember if he said let's show it or if I did, but we agreed to show a picture of the person.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Did you do it for the same reason you did it in one or two, there was something about the picture that provided some kind of a historical context for you?
A. No. In the- in the Martin case, it was more, I think, just, you know, this is what the guy looked like, you know.
There were two pictures, one was like a portrait in his- a portrait of him, and the other one was just like a candid shot with some service men, you know, standing about.
Q. Have you asked Mr. Gdanski for any pictures of Shirley Barbanell in this case?
A. Not- not in this case, no, I haven't. We haven't talked about that.
But, you know, if he's interested in showing a picture, I mean, it's just a picture.
Q. So it's kind of up to Mr. Gdanski whether he wants to use a picture or not, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. We haven't talked about that, you know, no. I assume I'll meet with him prior to the case and we'll put all that together.
I mean, he asks the questions.
MS. BROWN:
Q. So there's nothing about the opinions that you plan to give in the Shirley Barbanell case that would necessitate you using a picture, correct?
A. Right, either way, yeah. It doesn't affect whether- you know, what she looked like doesn't influence my- my opinions in the case either way.
..............Q.......Do you intend to provide any.......................
opinions in this case about Philip Morris,
USA's conduct that you haven't opined about in earlier Engle Progeny trials?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, the only Philip Morris Engle case was the Hess case. You know, I've- I mean, I'll talk about Philip Morris and he~
Mr. Gdanski may ask me, you know, questions if he wants to know about, say, the 1994 congressional hearings or the, you know,
Philip Morris advocacy statements from that time. I don't think I used those in the-in the Hess case. He's free to ask me about those.
If he wants to start asking me about Helmut Wakeham, I could talk about Helmut Wakeham if he's interested. So, I mean, in the broad patterns, I mean, I know you need to know, so I haven't developed anything new that goes beyond what I've testified about over the longer period, if we go back before Engle, in other cases that your client has been a defendant.
MS. BROWN:_
Q. That wouldn't include your trial preservation deposition? You talked- you used some Philip Morris documents in your trial preservation deposition?
A. Oh, that's right, yes. That was a long time ago. Yeah, and that kind of thing, you know, may- actually, we did do a lot of documents in that. That may be something that Mr. Gdanski would like to talk about.
Q. You haven't reached any new opinions since your trial preservation deposition or your testimony in the Hess case as it relates to Philip Morris, USA, correct?
A. No. I have no new opinions on that area.
Q. How about R.J. Reynolds or Liggett Tobacco Company, any new opinions you've reached since your trial preservation deposition in regards to those two defendants?
A. Nothing new, no. My testimony would be consistent.
Q. The same for the Tobacco- to the
Tobacco Industry Research Committee, the Council for Tobacco Research, any new opinions that you've reached regarding those organizations since your trial preservation deposition in- in January?
A. There are no new opinions.
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you mentioned that your- that you're presenting at a conference for an organization on the history of science?
A. That's correct.
Q. In the past, you've made clear that you do not consider yourself an expert on the science part of the smoking and health story and don't have an opinion as to when a scientific consensus was reached about the health risks of smoking. Is that still the case?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Yes. I don't anticipate- I mean,
I'm got going to give state of the art testimony on cancer causation and cancer research.
MS. BROWN:_
Okay. I think I'm- I think I'm complete. What I would like to do is go ahead and cede the floor to Ashlie to ask you whatever questions she has with the caveat that I'll spend that time to go back through my notes and may have a couple of cleanup questions after Ashlie.
Is that okay, Jonathan?
MR. GDANSKI:
Yep.
MS. BROWN:
So, Ashlie, the floor is yours.
EXAMINATION BY MS. CASE:
Q. Good afternoon, Professor. I shouldn't have too many questions. You would agree with me that it's common in practice in your field to utilize research assistants?
A. Yes.
Q. And you rely on research assistants both in your academic work and in your work for plaintiffs' counsel in this case and others?
..............A......That's correct...........................................................
Q. Research assistants are typically students, right?
A. Typically. They don't have to be, but, yes.
Q. And those could be undergraduate students or working on a master's degree or Ph.D., right?
A. Yes. That's true.
Q. Now, where do your research assistants fall; are they undergraduates,
Ph.D. students? Where are they?
A. Well, I have one who has just graduated from his four-year degree and is transitioning to his graduate program in the fall semester, and there's another one who's an assistant professor.
Q. And what are the names of your research assistants?
A. One of them is Derik Wood, and that's spelled D-e-r-i-k, last name is Wood.
Q. And the other?
A. Evan Bennett.
Q. Which one is the grad student and which one is the -
A. Evan Bennett is the assistant_
professor, and Derik is the recently graduated undergraduate.
Q. Do you know if Derik is going to pursue his Ph.D.?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. No. He's- he's attending an M.A. in library and information sciences at LSU. MS. CASE:
Q. Many students who are pursing a Ph.D. degree do so with the intention of becoming a college professor. Do you agree with that?
A. Yes.
Q. And it's not an easy job to find a teaching job even for a Ph.D.; is that right?
A. Unfortunately, that's true.
Q. You have to rely on your relationships with your colleagues and your reputation in large part; is that true?
A. To get a job?
Q. Yes.
A. Well, I think, you know, the quality of vour academic proaram is
important, you know, the quality of your work is important.
I think those relationships used to matter more but, you know, thankfully, equal opportunity laws have kind of broken down the old boy network which used to characterize, unfortunately, academic hiring.
Q. But given it's not easy to find a job teaching at a college or university, you would agree with me that anything is important in terms of your reputation?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form and its relevance.
A. I'm sorry, could you restate the question? I just wasn't able to hear you.
MS. CASE:
Q. Sure, I'm sorry.
A. The phone is a little bit, you know-
Q. And, please, since I am not sitting there with you in the room, if you do have a problem hearing me, please let me know._
Given how difficult it is to find a teaching job, you know, would you agree it can't hurt to have good relationships with your senior colleagues?
MR. GDANSKI:
Same objection. Relevancy to question.
A. Sure. I mean, you know- you know, as in all professions, you know, we're mentored by- if we're lucky, we're mentored by good people who want to mentor people.
MS. CASE:
Q. And correct me if I'm wrong, but once a Ph.D. student lands a job, that will be an assistant professor, typically, right?
A. These days it could be a variety of ranks. That would- what most- I mean, what is generally the goal of those graduate students who are getting a Ph.D. and who want to pursue a career in academia, the goal is a tenure track assistant professorship.
That's not always the case; sometimes you get- you're an instructor or .....a term professor. There's a variety of.......................
ranks. And even in my CV, if you notice, I had a number of jobs before I actually finished my program and was able to get a permanent position.
Q. So the ultimate goal is to become a tenure professor, correct?
A. Yes. For most people, yes.
Q. And in order to go through that process of winning tenure, younger professors must rely on the goodwill of their more senior colleagues; is that true, in addition to their- the quality of their work product?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. I hope the process is more meritocratic than that. But, you know, generally, it's- the old phrase, publish or perish, really is true in the sense that you need to be an active researcher.
Now, some schools require more of a teaching responsibility and, so, you need to- there might be more of an emphasis there. But for most big state universities, the publishing imperative is really the most
important.
Q. And you would agree with me that the mentorship relationships that you mentioned a moment ago are important in that process?
A. Yes.
Q. You testified earlier today that you have not read the deposition of defendant's expert historian in the Barbanell case, correct?
A. Right. I don't know who that person is.
Q. Do you plan to read that deposition at any point?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Probably not, to be honest with you. I-- as you know, I did a study some years ago where I read a large number of them and, you know, that's-- that was enough. You know, I don't- I don't need to read the defense historian's deposition to prepare myself for this case.
MS. CASE:
Q. It's not your practice to review
the deposition testimony of the opposing side's experts, is that what you're telling me?
MR GDANSKI:
Object to the form A. Yeah. I tend not to do that. I did- you know, I did the big project which I'm sure you're familiar with that article, and that was- that was enough.
MS. CASE:
Q. How about have you reviewed the deposition testimony of any defense expert in an Engle case?
MR GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. I skimmed through- and review is a very soft term. I mean, I have not read closely any- any- any of these depositions. I've kind of skimmed through them in a kind of cursory- cursory fashion. MS. CASE:
Q. Which ones have you skimmed through in a cursory fashion?
A. I was sent one- and I have no idea what case this was for, but one bv a
gentleman named Randy Roberts at Purdue University.
Q. Any others?
A. No. I haven't read any others.
Q. Have you received any others whether or not you've read them?
A. Yeah. I was sent one in Campbell, the Campbell case with the Searcy law firm.
I was deposed in that one in May. I can't remember what the guy's name was, but I read, like, one page of it. It's not something I was interested in reading.
Q. From whom did you receive the deposition of the expert historian in the Campbell case?
A. It was sent to me by- by the plaintiffs' attorney.
Q. Which plaintiffs' attorney?
A. Sales, S-a-l-e-s. I think his name is David.
Q. If I told you that the defendant's expert historian in the Campbell case is Gregg Michel, would that refresh your recollection on whose transcript you .....received?.......................................................................................
A. That sounds familiar.
Q. Do you know Dr. Michel?
A. No.
MR GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
MS. CASE:
Q. Now, you said you didn't read the whole transcript. Was there a part of the transcript that you read?
A. Like, the first two pages and I got distracted and never went back to it.
Q. Did you see the portion of the-of Dr. Michel's transcript where Mr. Sales asked Dr. Michel to name his research assistants?
A. No. I didn't see that portion.
Q. Are you familiar with the name Mary Elise Ferrer?
A. I don't know who that is.
Q. How about Keith Manuel?
A. Don't know that name.
Q. Taylor Patterson?
A. You got me on that one.
Q. Jennifer Schneider?
A. Are these historians? I don't_
know these people.
Q. Are you familiar with the name Jennifer Schneider?
A. No.
Q. How about Patrick Cosby?
A. Don't know that name either.
Q. And last one, Amil Bowen?
A. Amil Bowen, don't know that name either.
Q. I'll represent to you that those are Dr. Michel's research assistants that he testified about in the transcript of his Campbell deposition that you received?
A. Okay.
Q. You didn't read that part of the deposition, is what you're telling me?
A. Rght.
MR. GDANSKI:
Asked and answered. Is there a purpose for representing to him who those people are?
MS. CASE:
I'll get there.
Q. Now, have you sent the deposition transcriot from Dr. Michel in the Camobell...........
case to anyone else?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Yeah. I forwarded it to Robert Proctor by e-mail attachment.
MS. CASE:
Q. And why did you do that?
A. You know, it was defense information. We had worked on that project, in the data project, and so, I forwarded that on.
Q. Is it your practice to send Dr.
Proctor all transcripts from defense historians that you receive?
MR. GDANSKI:
I don't know if it's your speaker again, but there's an echo coming from your phone. I don't know where that's coming from.
THE COURT REPORTER:
Could you repeat that question,
please?
(Whereupon the previous question was read back.)
MR GDANSKI:_
Object to the form.
A. Is it a practice, I sent a couple to him over the years as I get them.
MS. CASE:
Q. Is there a particular reason you sent him the transcript from the deposition in the Campbell- Dr. Michel's deposition in the Campbell case?
A. No. Just to, you know, kind of keep up on, you know, defense experts who testify for the tobacco industry because I published all that.
Q. Did Dr. Proctor ask you to send him the transcript from Dr. Michel's testimony in the Campbell case?
A. No. That was something I just did on my own.
Q. I assume you've known Dr. Proctor for many years?
A. Yeah. When did I meet him, I met him in person in 2004, and by phone and electronic communication, I guess in 2003, the year before that.
Q. Where does Dr. Proctor teach?
..............A,.....Stanford,.....................................................................
Q. Do you know if it's Dr. Proctor's practice to review the expert reports of the opposing side's experts?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. I don't- I don't know either way.
MS. CASE:
Q. Do you know if it's his practice to review the deposition testimony given by opposing side's expert?
A. You would have to ask him about that.
Q. But you don't know?
A. I don't know.
Q. Have you spoken with Dr. Proctor about the Campbell case?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to form.
A. No. I have not.
MS. CASE:
Q. Have you spoken with Dr. Proctor about Dr. Michel?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. No. I just- I iust sent on that_
transcript.
MS. CASE:
Q. How did Dr. Proctor respond when you sent him that transcript?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. He didn't, not to me.
MS. CASE:
Q. Have you and Dr. Proctor discussed anything with regard to Dr. Michel's research assistants?
A. No.
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to form.
MS. CASE:
Q. Do you know a Dr. Betty Smocovitis?
A. I don't know her.
Q. Do you know if Dr. Proctor knows Dr. Smocovitis?
A. I don't know if he knows her.
Q. I'll represent to you that Dr. Smocovitis is a history professor at the University of Florida.
A. Okav.
Q. You haven't come across her before in any capacity?
A. No. What's her field?
Q. I'm sorry. History. Did I not say that?
A. Sub-field. I don't know her.
Q. I'm not- I'm not certain what her specific sub-field is within history.
Are you aware that Dr. Proctor called Dr. Smocovitis to criticize the Ph.D. students assisting Dr. Michel with his research for the Campbell case?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. No. I'm not aware of that.
MS. CASE:
Q. Do you believe that a call from a Stanford professor criticizing a Ph.D. student could have the effect of damaging that student's reputation with Dr. Smocovitis?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form. So now I see where you're going, but I can't imagine Dr. Kyriakoudes can possibly have an opinion
responsive to that question. Since he says he has no idea what you're talking about, it's probably hard for him to answer.
A. Well, all I can say is that I remember what it was like to be a graduate student with no money, and particularly, you know, in these days of cutbacks, if these guys are just- as I've learned about in my earlier study that came out in the data article when I read those, they're just going into the library and reading the newspaper or researching in the archive various things under the direction of someone who's actually paying them, I don't see a problem with that.
MS. CASE:
Q. I'm sorry, you don't see a problem with what?
A. With them working in that capacity. I certainly wouldn't hold that against anybody.
Q. That's your position. I'm asking if- if such- if receiving such a call could have the effect of damaging a Ph.D.
.....student's reputation with the colleagues in.............
the department?
MR. GDANSKI:
Just give the same objection I gave. I'm not sure how he can answer that question.
A. I don't know. I mean, I can't answer that. I mean, it just depends. You know, I mean, if the- if the students are under the direction of this professor that you've mentioned to me, Smoco- Smocovits-Smocovitis, I'm sorry, and they're doing this and they- they didn't consult with-with her, that might impair the level of trust between the teacher and the student.
But the act itself to make some money on the side because you're living off of a fellowship that, if you're lucky to have one, is totally inadequate to support you, which is true of all graduate fellowships, I don't think that's a problem.
MS. CASE:
Q. So research assistants depend on the work that they do, such as work in this capacity here in litigation for their professors in order to make a living?_
A. Well, it's a way for them to make, you know, some extra money.
Q. Do you think as a professor, if you received such a call, you might discuss it with other colleagues in your department? MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. A call about?
MS. CASE:
Q. Criticizing a graduate student?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. You know, my view would be- I mean, my position on the content and quality of defense historians is well known, and you know my position on that. I don't have a high opinion of the quality of history that comes across the stand from- from your experts. I'm published on that.
But, you know, go down the chain and, you know, I don't- I don't think people in our profession would hold that against a research assistant who's trying to make, you know, $25 or $30 or $40 or $50 bucks an hour, whatever it is that vou pay
these assistants, to doing basically leg work and basic research work for somebody. Nobody- I don't think anybody would hold that against them.
MS. CASE:
Q. Do you remember what my question was?
A. You asked me if that would be held against the students.
Q. No. I asked if it might be discussed by the professor with other colleagues in the department?
A. Might it be discussed, it might.
MR. GDANSKI:
I'll object.
THE WITNESS:
I mean, who knows. I don't know.
It just depends. I mean, these are all— you know, I can only tell you what I know.
I mean, you're asking me about, you know, what goes on in the University of Florida.
I don't- I don't work there.
MS. CASE:
Q. But you've spent time in an academic department, correct?_
A. Yes.
Q. Do you have any reason to believe that the University of Rorida is somehow different from the typical academic department?
MR. GDANSKI:
I'm sorry, I don't know that he can make a distinction in departments or he can make a distinction in people, but I'm really not sure where- where you're trying to go with Dr. Kyriakoudes in this line of questioning.
To ask speculative questions about what he believes may potentially be done in other departments at other universities with similar issues is an impossible question to answer. I'm not sure what you're trying to get or where you're going with the line of questions.
MS. CASE:
You've repeatedly stated that my questions are impossible to answer and Dr. Kyriakoudes proceeds to answer them.
MR. GDANSKI:
.......................He's trying to accommodate vou to.........
the best of his ability. But again, if he says I don't know that that would be something that may happen in that department- I think he's doing the best to accommodate your question.
MS. CASE:
If his answer is he don't- he does not know, he's more than welcome to tell me that he doesn't know.
MR. GDANSKI:
But you're asking these very broad questions about what he thinks may happen under these circumstances. They're hypothetical on top of hypothetical on top of hypothetical.
And, I mean, he can try and answer them to the best of his ability. I'm lodging my objection, once again, to the line of questioning.
MS. CASE:
I think we're doing our best to get out of here as quickly as possible. If you could put your objection on the record to a specific question, please do so. If we can avoid the extended colloquies on this I
would appreciate it so we could all get this closed up and let Dr. Kyriakoudes get his daughter's cell phone.
Q. Going back, Doctor, while one of Dr. Michel's research assistants at the University of Rorida was called into her department chair's office after Dr. Proctor made this call-- you weren't aware of that? MR GDANSKI:
Object to form.
A. No. I don't- I don't know what goes on there.
MS. CASE:
Q. Getting called into the department chair's office can be a little like getting called to the principal's office, right?
MR GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. No. That's not an accurate-that's not a good metaphor.
MS. CASE:
Q. The department chair is head of the department, I'm assuming?
A. Chief administrative officer.
.............Q......How do vou think that Ph.D.......................
student felt when her department chair was asking her why a Stanford professor was calling to object to her work?
MR GDANSKI:
Enough. Don't answer the question. You can't ask him how he thinks a Ph.D. student felt in circumstances he's not familiar with or he may not know all the facts involved, on top of which you're asking him how someone else felt emotionally.
For a multiplicity of reasons, it's an impossible question to answer and inappropriate to ask, quite frankly. So I understand you're probably reading from a script, and I appreciate that, I understand you have to ask your questions. And now I've lodged my additional objection.
MS. CASE:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, when you were a Ph.D. student, how would you have felt about getting called into your department chair's office based on a call criticizing your work?
MR GDANSKI:_
Object to the form.
A. It just depends what the department chair said to me. I mean, I don't know. You know, academic departments are not hierarchically organized places.
The department chair is not the boss of anything. If anything, he's, you know, small claims court judge and, you know, head accountant to keep the books balanced.
So, I mean, I made my position on this. I-there's nothing wrong with students trying to make a little bit of extra money doing, you know, basically routine, historical research. It's higher up the food chain, hierarchical change, if you will, as to what people do with that research.
So I don't- you know, we're all broke as graduate students, you know. I personally don't see anything wrong with that. I mean, if a student has misgivings about what they're doing, that's- that's the student's issue. I can't- you know, that's somebody else's issue. I can't .■■■■^sw6r..tPJ!Jhem.........................................................................
Q. I'm not talking about a student's misgivings about performing the work. I'm talking about a student's reaction to being called into the chair of the department's office based on a phone call from plaintiffs' expert?
A. So, yeah, I don't see- I don't see the issue here. I mean, if the student is doing something to make some extra money and they have no qualms about it, then there's no issue there.
Q. Do you think that being called into the chair's office, based on your work with graduate students, could have the effect of discouraging students from providing research assistance to Dr. Michel?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. That unto itself, no.
MS. CASE:
Q. Do you believe that Dr. Proctor made the call to discourage the research assistants from working with Dr. Michel?
MR. GDANSKI:
_Object to the form. How could he_
have possibly known-A. I- I-MR. GDANSKI:
-- something he just learned about
now.
THE WITNESS:
I'm not in a position to answer that question due to lack of knowledge.
MS. CASE:
Q. Do you have any idea why Dr.
Proctor would make such a call?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. No.
MS. CASE:
Q. Now, in the past Dr. Proctor has given presentations at academic conferences criticizing historians who work with attorneys for the tobacco industry. You're aware of that?
A. Yes. I have given a presentation on historian's testimony as well.
Q. So has Dr. Proctor?
A. Yes. I mean, I gave one on the same stage with him, I should have been more
precise. We once shared a mini conference, a symposium, me, Robert and Allan Brandt.
Q. I'm sorry, I didn't hear the last name?
A. Allan Brandt.
Q. And you're also aware that Dr.
Proctor has written articles criticizing historians by name who testifies (inaudible) in the tobacco industry; is that right?
A. Are you referring to the article in the December '06 issue of Tobacco Control?
Q. Is that an article, that you're aware of, that does what I've asked?
A. Well, I think he criticizes, you know, the content of the testimony. I also have an article in that-- in that edition of that journal where I criticize the content of the testimony.
Q. Would you agree that academics may be reluctant to work with attorneys for the tobacco industry because of this criticism that's out there from you and Dr. Proctor?
MR. GDANSKI:
_Object to the form. I don't know_
how he can answer that question.
A. I don't think I have much- much persuasive power. I think if anybody is uneasy about working as a historical expert or any expert for the tobacco industry, I think the source of that might be their misgivings about the nature of your client and their actions and their products and what they've done over time. But, no, I don't think I have any- any persuasive power whatsoever.
MS. CASE:
Q. Do you believe Dr. Proctor does?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. You know, we're just- just college professors.
MS. CASE:
Q. From your perspective, what was the purpose of publishing such articles criticizing historians who work with the tobacco industry?
A. My work, yeah. There was a definite purpose to that. And, you know,
.....I've testified to that often. You can go..................
back to the original data grant application which has come up in litigation, at least in my testimony, to look at the purpose of that project.
That was the National Cancer Institute and American Legacy funded project. You know, the idea was to look at what- you know, what is the knowledge that's being generated by experts in all phases of tobacco litigation and, then, to develop an on-line archive, the data archives.
And, then, the second phase was to have experts, such as myself, read those documents with an eye towards evaluating their scholarly soundness and that's what I- that's what I did.
Q. So it wasn't to discourage academics from working with the attorneys representing the tobacco industry?
A. No. And you can read my article and a review of that- of that particular piece will show that I focused solely on, essentially, the arguments and evidence and methods employed in the testimony with a
small introductory section discussing my research into the ways in which tobacco law firms developed historical expert research and the like.
Q. Do you know that Dr. Proctor threatened to write an article naming the Ph.D. students who were Dr. Michel's research assistants?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form. Asked and answered. He didn't know anything about this until you told him, so how could he possibly know that.
A. Rght. I would have to echo that, no, that's not known to me.
MS. CASE:
Q. Thinking back to your time as a graduate student, if a Stanford professor had written an article criticizing you in any way, how do you-- how do you think that would have had an impact on your professional career?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, it depends on what the
criticism was.
MS. CASE:
Q. Do you think it would have had a positive effect on your professional career? MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form. Highly speculative.
A. This is- who knows. I have no idea.
MS. CASE:
Q. You have no opinion about whether such an article could be damaging for the student's reputation?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form. Asked and answered.
A. Well, I mean, it just depends. I mean, if the student is just doing- you know, wrote- research assistants go to the library, I mean, this is how my students do it. I tell them what to do and they go do it and bring me back what they have. I look at it. I don't see how that's going to influence anybody.
_You know, sometimes when you make
accusations they can reflect poorly on the accuser as much as the- you know, it just depends. Who knows. I mean, this is totally hypothetical.
MS. CASE:
Q. You've made several comments today about American litigation, how it's conducted. You've been involved in litigation for many years, right?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Yes, I have.
MS. CASE:
Q. And given American litigation, do you think it's appropriate to try to dissuade graduate students from performing work for an opposing party's expert witness?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. No. I mean, I said a few minutes ago I personally don't have any problem with that. Graduate students, you know, they're broke, and if they're trying to, you know, have it so that they can have meat once a .....week, there's nothing wrong vvith that.........................
They're particularly doing simple, you know, basic research.
MS. CASE:
Q. That wasn't quite my question that you answered. My question was do you think it's appropriate to try to dissuade graduate students from performing work for an opposing party's expert witness?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form. Asked and answered a number of times.
A. No. I think you should leave graduate students alone.
MS. CASE:
Q. If you think you should leave graduate students alone, do you think it would be inappropriate for Dr. Proctor to write an article naming Dr. Michel's research assistants; is that right?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. I don't- I mean, this stuff is public record. I mean, if it comes out, I mean, there's nothing, you know, secretive or hidden about- about this process. It's_
all a very open and public process. I don't think that would- I don't think that would have much of an impact if Robert Proctor wrote an article or not.
MS. CASE:
Q. Again, not quite my question that you answered. My question was given your statement that, you know, we should leave graduate students alone, do you think it would be appropriate for Dr. Proctor to write an article naming Dr. Michel's research assistants?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form. Asked and answered. Speculative.
A. I don't think it would- I don't think it would matter either way. I think it's- there's nothing inappropriate about-about writing an article like that. I don't see any problem with it if you're- you know, you could document the history of the litigation, for example, and all of these documents are historical records unto themselves, you know.
There's nothinq wronq with writinq
an article like that. I don't think people in the profession would hold it against graduate students who are trying to get by.
MS. CASE:
Q. Well, you certainly wouldn't want somebody to single out one of your research assistants for -MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Right, yeah. No, and I - you know, I personally have never criticized anybody's research assistants. I mean, those names are peppered throughout the older transcripts that I read, you know. I didn't- you know, it's just not important to me.
MS. CASE:
Q. If Dr. Proctor did call Dr.
Smocovitis about Dr. Michel's research assistant, do you condemn Dr. Proctor's action?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form. You can try to answer that question but I don't even know what it means._
A. I don't know what- I don't know what he talked to this professor about. I can neither applaud nor condemn. I can't-I have no basis of making a judgement whatsoever. I mean, this is all hearsay that you're giving me.
MR. GDANSKI:
I think it would be unwise for Professor Kyriakoudes, if he answers, to trust everything you said to be true when there's another side to a story that he's never heard about. I think everyone would agree to that.
A. I can't answer your question.
MS. CASE:
Q. I'm asking you if, in fact-assume that what I'm telling you is correct, and if it turns out not to be correct, then the answer won't matter and it will all be in the same question.
So if, in fact, Dr. Proctor did call Dr. Smocovitis about Dr. Michel's research assistants to criticize them and to threaten to publish their names in an .....article based on their work for Dr. Michel..............
would you condemn his actions?
MR. GDANSKI:
I give the same objection I did
before.
A. No. I wouldn't condemn it because this is all public information.
MS. CASE:
Q. So you would support his actions? MR. GDANSKI:
Objection. Object to the form. Mischaracterizes what he just said. If you're going to continue on with the questions, at least don't mischaracterize his testimony.
A. Yeah. That's not even worthy of an answer.
MS. CASE:
Q. I'm just attempting to clarify,
Dr. Kyriakoudes -MR. GDANSKI:
The clarification is misguided.
MS. CASE:
Q. I'm trying to get Dr. Kyriakoudes' opinion on- I mean, the professor has worked in history and academic departments
for many years?
MR. GDANSKI:
What's your point?
MS. CASE:
He's familiar with this realm, I'm assuming?
MR. GDANSKI:
With this what?
MS. CASE:
This realm.
MR. GDANSKI:
Perhaps. But you're trying to get that in an awkward fashion. That's fine.
But he's not familiar with anything you're talking about. So everything you're telling him is for the first time perhaps. And you're asking him to draw conclusions and give answers, make assumptions, all which would be inappropriate.
But go ahead.
MS. CASE:
Q. Do you remember what my question was?
MR. GDANSKI:
I don't think anybody does.
MS. CASE:
Q. My question was if you don't condemn Dr. Proctor's actions with regard to Dr. Michel's research assistants as I represent them to you today, do you support his decision to make that phone call?
MR. GDANSKI:
Make the same objection as before.
A. I thought you asked me about the article, now you're asking me about the phone call. I don't know what he said in the phone call.
MS. CASE:
Q. I realize that?
A. So I have no basis for making any- any judgement.
Q. I'm providing you with a set of facts and I'm asking you to assume that they're true. Do you understand what I'm -A. Yes.
Q. So assuming that Dr. Proctor did call Dr. Smocovitis to criticize Dr.
Michel's research assistant, do you support his decision to do that? Do you think that was appropriate?_
MR. GDANSKI:
I'll reiterate the same objection I made. A similar question has been asked.
A. Well, I mean, you know, since you're hypothesizing and speculating, if Proctor called and said, you know, talk to those students, you know, they may not know what they're getting into, that- that all this is public, for example, and that they need to consider what they're doing in that regard, in that kind of advisory capacity; and, then, after having thought about that, they can make a more balanced decision about, you know, working as a research assistant, that would be okay. I don't have a problem with that.
I think a lot of- a lot of historians who have gotten involved in litigation don't completely understand how public the process is, and I'm not talking about tobacco litigation.
I know I have a colleague named Phil Scranton who wrote a report critical of another historian. And that- that expert .....reportqotintothepaper,itw ......................................
newsworthy. It was on- I think it was on lead paint or something, asbestos maybe, it's been a long time.
And I remember Phil saying, you know, I didn't know that was a public document, you know, and not completely understanding the nature of the process. So there's nothing wrong with that kind of thing.
MS. CASE:
Q. So instead of that kind of thing that you just described, where you said if Dr. Proctor called in sort of an advisory capacity, if instead of that what Dr.
Proctor did was call and threatened to publish an article essentially outing these research assistants for doing work for experts for the tobacco industry, do you think that that would be appropriate?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Outing, I mean, again, this is public information. You're not- I mean,
I'm not sure what outing means in this regard. He's not- you know, everything we
do in these realms is written down by a court reporter and is available and increasingly now, it's put up on the web and is available in all kinds of means.
It just depends what he said in the article, to be honest with you. Who knows, I mean, you know, if he said in the article, you know, there's this phenomenon out there and, you know, historians work in this capacity and I just want people to know about it, there's nothing wrong with that.
Q. Okay. I hope this is the last time- last time I have to ask you to go back to the question that I asked. What I was asking was not, you know, whether if Dr. Proctor wrote an article in an appropriate way that would be appropriate.
What I'm asking you is if Dr.
Proctor called and essentially threatened to write an article about these research assistants to the professor- let me go back.
If rather than calling Dr.
Smocovitis and sort of advising her to advise the qraduate students about what they
were doing about the public nature of litigation, if instead of that Dr. Proctor called and threatened to write an article unless these research assistants stopped performing work for Dr. Michel, do you-would you think that was appropriate?
MR. GDANSKI:
See, just because you don't like the answer you get to a question doesn't mean you get to ask it a million times over and over again. He answered that question.
He said it depends on what the article was that he was writing about.
MS. CASE:
I'm asking him to assume that what- what the conversation was about was Dr. Proctor threatening to publish an article unless the research assistants stopped. I'm asking him in those circumstances if he would think Dr.
Proctor's actions were appropriate. That's my specific question and I have not yet received an answer to it.
THE WITNESS:
_All I can say is while I_
personally disagree with the conclusions or expert opinions drawn by historians that work for the tobacco industry, I don't personalize it.
You know, for example, Lacy Ford, someone I've known for a very long time and have a high opinion of, is as a person, even if I disagree with them on these tobacco historical issues.
So I would- I would never personalize it that way myself. I just think that's- that's not how I would do it.
I stick to the contents of the testimony, the ideas, the methods and those questions and that's how I've always held myself in this.
That way, you know, when I'm at a conference and I want to get a drink with somebody, we can get a drink even if we're on the other side of the stand in a courtroom. And I hold that at all levels of this. That's all I can tell you is what I would do.
MS. CASE:
..............Q......And you would do that because you.........
think, at bottom, you should just leave graduate students alone; is that right?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Well, when I say leave it alone, I mean, I wouldn't- I wouldn't threaten anybody. I don't think- that's not right.
But, you know, it is public information so, you know, the students-their professors or, you know, whomever opened up the opportunity to do the research should- they have a responsibility to let them know the full scope of what they're getting into.
Litigation, it's a hard ball game,
I think you would agree with that. If that- if one doesn't have the stomach for it, they ought not to go into it.
MS. CASE:
Thank you, Dr. Kyriakoudes.
That's all the questions I have.
EXAMINATION BY MS. BROWN:
Q. I have a couple of follow-up questions. How often do you correspond with
Dr. Proctor?
A. Once a month, maybe, you know, when there's some common interest item that comes up.
Q. When you say common interest items, would those common interest items routinely involve tobacco litigation issues?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. Not-- not commonly, no. Usually we talk about our research. And he's researching a project and I'm researching a project. They're different projects, we're different people, but they cover different facets of the rise of the cigarette.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Is Dr. Proctor presenting at the same history of science conference that you're preparing for?
A. Yes. That's- we're on the same panel. He asked- well, he didn't ask me to be on the panel, another member of the panel- another person organized the panel but he's also on that panel.
Q. When you and Dr. Proctor talk or
correspond, do you discuss the contents of your testimony in these Engle Progeny cases?
A. I don't like to talk about that.
I like to keep my professional research life separate in this case. I don't want to have to be in a position to where- like right now, where I have to opine on what he does. Because he's somebody else and we have different areas that we touch on, or at least I know I don't do his area. I don't do history of science like he does.
Q. So you don't talk about your testimony with Dr. Proctor?
A. I don't, no.
Q. Does Dr. Proctor discuss the content of his testimony with you?
A. No. No.
Q. How long have you been in a position of corresponding with Dr. Proctor on a monthly basis?
A. Well, I met him through the telephone, I mean, we began talking. He called me up and introduced himself to me on the phone some time in 2003. I know I was at Chapel Hill. It probably would have been
before the end of July 2003. That's when I moved from Chapel Hill back to Mississippi.
And, then, in late 2003 or maybe the spring of 2004 I signed on to a project, the data project, I was invited on by the late Ronald Davis.
THE COURT REPORTER:
Could you repeat that?
THE WITNESS:
The late Ronald Davis, a medical doctor. And he- and I've testified about this so you could go back to read prior testimony, but I'll summarize it briefly.
This was a project looking at expert witness testimony and building a database of testimony with the idea of understanding, you know, what knowledge has been developed over the course of the litigation.
And he said, you know, we want you to do public knowledge, a portion of it.
And I developed a coding scheme that indexes would use to index this and stuff. And they said we want someone to write, you know,
.....will you write a paper basedon t hese...........................
documents. And we'd like to have somebody-he asked if I could do something on the history of cancer research, and I said well, that's not me, I'm not qualified to do that.
So I recruited Robert Proctor, and that's- that's the genesis of that article,
I think the title is Everybody Knew... something like that. It's also in that same volume.
And those- we worked on those, the whole group of people, over the course of the '04/'05. The thing was published, I think, in December of '06.
So, I mean, we've seen each other at conferences, you know, the American Historical Association meeting one year, so.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Since 2003, basically late 2003, you've corresponded on a monthly basis with Dr. Proctor?
A. No. I mean- no. Long periods where I haven't corresponded with him, and sometimes I- I don't know how long I've corresponded with him. I mean, you know, when we have some common professional_
interest we talk.
So we used to talk a lot when the data project was going because, you know, that was-- that was the project and, then, we don't talk for a while.
Now we're doing this panel where I'm presenting on the panel with him, and we had some discussion about that this- I think that was last fall that got put into the hopper for proposal.
Q. What is his topic on this panel?
A. I can't remember. There's, like, five or six people presenting on it with different facets of their research projects.
Q. And it all relates to the tobacco industry and issues related to smoking and health?
A. Yes. It is on smoking.
Q. Does the panel have a title?
A. It does, but I can't remember it.
I think if you go to the history, I'm sure the History of Science Society has a website, you could look it up.
Q. Did you send Dr. Michel's testimony to Dr. Proctor in relation to this
project, this conference?
A. No.
Q. Given what you have heard today, would it make you reluctant to send him another transcript that you receive in the course of litigation?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. You know, I've treated this the way I've described, you know, so I certainly wouldn't threaten anybody, me. I don't know. I'll have to think about it.
MS. BROWN:
Q. You said you don't take this personally; you don't personalize litigation, correct?
A. Well, I don't personalize it to other people, that's right.
Q. In your conversations with Dr.
Proctor, do you believe he personalizes this litigation, gets personal about it?
A. No. I don't think so.
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
THE WITNESS:_
I think he rightly sees this as a facet of the tobacco epidemic or the cigarette epidemic, and that one of the ways in which the tobacco industry has been able to maintain its position in the American market place has been to insulate itself from product liability. And I'm not an expert on that, but there's a great discussion of it in Allan Brandt's book,
The Ggarette Century, and I certainly think that's the case.
MS. BROWN:
Q. Earlier you said that you don't really view your role in this litigation as one of a public health advocate?
A. That's correct.
Q. Or do you view your role in this litigation as that as an anti-tobacco advocate?
A. Well, I personally believe that the product that your client manufactures, which is responsible- not just your manufacturer but all the categories which is responsible for, you know, one out of five .....deaths in contemporary American society, is.........
a bad thing.
And, I mean, I'm an advocate for health and an advocate against disease and I think- and I've said many times the tobacco industry's actions have promoted huge amounts of suffering and disease over time in American life and now globally. So it's really horrible, you know, from a perspective of someone who just believes in the basic value of life.
But, you know, as a historian, what I'm doing here is reporting on my research and sharing that research in this.
Q. It sounds to me now, though, like what you're saying is that your reason for participating in this litigation is to further an interest in advocating a tobacco-free society; is that fair?
A. Well, I- I would like to see the healthy people goals that were set out back in the '90s reached which is, and I'm recalling from memory here, you know, like, maybe ten percent smoking prevalence by now.
We haven't reached that.
_I would like to see fewer people_
smoke. I would like to see less smoking in American society. I was asked to come in great detail once, I believe this was about a deposition, if I was an advocate of getting rid of all tobacco or cigarettes, cigarette prohibition. And I said well, I don't think that would be an effective policy.
I think, you know, the fewer people that smoke in American life the better, because it's deadly. And, I mean, you can disagree with me, you know, one can say no, it's better to have a society where more people smoke. That's value judgement and that comes from my own personal sensibilities.
How you achieve that, you know, that's- that's difficult to gauge. Just as a historian looking at past efforts of various forms of prohibition, I don't think that works.
What I said was I would like to see released for marketing controls and, you know, perhaps that will work with this new-the tobacco A passed just recently, I don't
know.
But all of that is not relevant to my reading of the historical record in my expert testimony in this case, which is following my research methods and sticking to my training as a historian and doing that. I've been clear on that.
Q. But your participation in this litigation- first of all, your participation in this litigation is voluntary, correct?
A. That's true.
Q. You're paid by your time to be here, correct?
A. That's true.
Q. You could be doing other things if you chose to, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. Do you view your participation in this litigation as furthering your goals of eliminating smoking?
A. I don't think it- I don't think it- it doesn't. My testimony doesn't eliminate smoking. What- what my testimony does, though, is provide what I think is_
bearing witness to the truth about the issues that I speak on.
I think that the- the testimony given by the defense historians, as I said, they do not meet the standards of peer review; that it is a deceptive testimony that is not true to the historical method and I'm- I think my work is better. And I think I'm setting the record straight.
I don't know what the outcome of any particular case that I've been involved with will have on the grand scheme of tobacco control, I don't think very much at all. But I do think I'm setting the record straight on the history of smoking in American life.
Q. You do believe, I assume, that whatever impact this litigation would have on tobacco control would come as a result of plaintiffs prevailing in these lawsuits versus defendants, correct?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. In which way?
.....MS. BROWN:................................................................................
Q. Well, tobacco control- to the extent goals of tobacco control are furthered by the litigation, it's only going to be furthered through plaintiff verdicts, right?
A. How?
Q. Well, it's certainly not going to be furthered through defense verdicts, will it?
A. I don't think it's furthered either way. I mean, when you asked me earlier, you know, about the benefit of the litigation of public health, I focused on that- you know, that information, you know, the exposure of the industry documents or the release of the industry documents to public health advocates, others, scholars.
And that- you know, I'm not an expert on all of what happened in the '90s, but, you know, that largely came about as a result of the state settlement and all that, the MSA. And that- that really did further public health in a significant way.
The outcome of any particular plaintiffs' verdict or set of plaintiffs'_
verdicts, I don't know. I mean, I don't-- I don't see how that advances it one way or the other. I do think, though, that I am setting the record straight.
Q. Well, there's no mystery here, meaning, Dr. Kyriakoudes, you want plaintiffs to win this lawsuit, right?
A. That's not my decision. That is up to The Jury. I said this many times.
I- I present my research, I present my professional decision. That decision is made by the panel of people that are sitting in the courtroom who are charged with making that decision.
And, you know, my position is that I think the tobacco industry has committed an egregious fraud on the American public,
I've been clear about that, but whether that should result in a particular plaintiffs' verdict is another question that goes beyond, really, my role in this.
I mean, I don't know the law.
It's complex. You know, I'm not a medical doctor, I can't evaluate medical testimony.
All of these things, that is for The Jury,
and I've said this many times.
Q. Going back to this presentation that you're going to do with Dr. Proctor, do any of the topics that either you're presenting on, he's presenting on or the other members of this panel are presenting on deal with litigation issues such as your data project? I would say that dealt with litigation issues, right, we can agree on that?
A. Yes.
Q. So these presentations that you're doing at the history of science conference, do any of these presentations have to do with litigation and evaluating witnesses testimony in litigation?
A. Not my- not my paper. I can't remember what the other papers are about. I don't think it does. You know, mine is really on use of social science research in shaping the industry's understanding of smoker behavior.
Q. And you're talking about the use of social science research by the tobacco companies themselves versus in defense of_
litigation; is that correct?
A. No. No. The story that I'm working on for this is I'm going through and I'm reading all the industry studies about the smoking initiation process and how people begin smoking and continue smoking; not addiction.
But, you know, there's a lot of really interesting research in those files looking at, you know, like, social dynamics, you know, peer group, I mean, really detailed stuff about the peer group. It's really fascinating if you just want to know about how cigarettes operate in society, and that's what I'm looking at.
Q. And the documents that you're looking at are internal company documents that are part of the public archive; is that correct?
A. Right. Largely studies, you know, studies and reports. So it's- might not be the most exciting thing to read, but, you know, typically, some- M.E.- I think it's M.E. Johnson with Philip Morris has done a .....I ot oft his work. Ther e's afewot h e r..........................
scholars who are not coming to my- name, scholars that work for- scientists that work for the industry, social psychologists and people with those kinds of background, mostly in the '60s.
Q. Other than Dr. Proctor, are there any other expert witnesses for plaintiffs in this litigation that you regularly correspond with?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. You mean just historians?
MS. BROWN:
Q. Or any? I mean, for example, you looked at the expert disclosure that plaintiffs filed in this case, right?
A. Right. Oh, yeah.
Q. You recognize some of the names on there, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. I n fact, Dr. Proctor's name was on this, wasn't it?
A. It might have been. I didn't notice it, but he might be on there, sure.
I don't dispute that._
Q. Any of those other names that you saw the expert disclosure-- it's in front of you, Doctor, so if you want to flip back through, feel free to do so.
A. I saw -
Q. Any of the other witnesses listed there you regularly talk to, correspond with, interact with?
A. I've- over the years, I've corresponded with Jack Henningfield and talked with him. He- on this list, I don't really know, personally, anyone else on the list with the exception of Mike Cummings, but I haven't talked with him in quite a while.
Q. What interactions have you had with Dr. Henningfield?
A. I've talked with him- Jack is a scholar who understands the kind of- the role of- he might call it the humanity's component to public health. He actually worked with a group to do an art exhibit on addiction at this art museum in Baltimore.
So I talked with him about some of mv research, which kind of straddles the
humanities, culture and social science. You know, my particular approach as a historian is very disciplinary and we've talked about that?
Q. Have you talked to him about the litigation?
A. No.
Q. Have you talked to him about your testimony in the litigation?
A. No.
Q. Have you talked to him about his testimony in the litigation?
A. No. I think he is one of those people that made a video, doesn't actually like to go to the trials.
Q. Are you starting to think you're the only one who likes to go to trials?
MR. GDANSKI:
Object to the form.
A. You know, I do it for the reasons I explained earlier. I can't speak for other people.
MS. BROWN:
I don't have any further questions._
