LOUIS KYRIAKOUDES, PH.D, having been produced and first duly sworn, was examined and testified as follows:
MR. SCHULTZ: Can I ask when we go on the record if everybody who is participating in the deposition either as a Rorida lawyer or pro hac'd into the Gray case.
MR. WALDEN: I am a Rorida lawyer.
MR. SCHULTZ: All right.
MR. WALDEN: And a Missouri lawyer.
MR. SCHULTZ: All right. Amanda, I know you're a Rorida lawyer. Giselle, you're a Rorida lawyer, right?
MS. MANSEUR: Yes.
MR. SCHULTZ: Okay. Great. Thank you.
MR. TEPIKIAN: I'm a Rorida lawyer.
MR. SCHULTZ: Oh, I thought you weren't participating. But I knew you were a Florida lawyer, so we're okay.
MR. TEPIKIAN: And Mississippi, you're covered both ways.
EXAMINATION BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Good morning. Would you please state your full name for the record?
A. My name is Louis Michael Kyriakoudes. Would you like me to spell that?
Q. Please do.
A. L-O-U-l-S. M-I-OH-A-E-L. And the hard one, K-Y-R-l-A-K-O-U-D-E-S.
Q. And you're a Ph.D, correct?
A. That's right. I have a Ph.D in history.
Q. So if I refer to you as Dr. Kyriakoudes, is that okay?
A. That's fine.
Q. Okay. You've been deposed many times before today; is that correct?
A. That's true.
Q. So you're generally familiar with the deposition process?
A. Yes, I am.
Q. Okay. I'll just let you know if at any point in time today you would like to take a break, just let me know and I'll be happy to accommodate you.
And if at any time you don't understand a question that I've asked of you, please let me know that and I'll be happy to rephrase the question. Otherwise if you don't tell me that you do not
understand my question, I'm going to assume that you understood it; is that fair?
A. That's fair, yes.
Q. Is there any reason you know of today that you are not able to provide truthful or accurate testimony?
A. No.
Q. Have you taken any medications today that would impair your memory?
A. No.
Q. Okay. Now, we're here today for the Carolyn Gray case. Do you understand that?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. When were you first contacted to work on the Carolyn Gray case?
A. I was asked by a secretary in the Levin firm to supply dates for deposition. That was sometime over the summer, I can't remember exactly when. And then received materials relevant to the case around the 10th or 11th of August.
Q. So you were first contacted about this case in the summer of 2009?
A. Yeah. I think. You know, I get a lot of calls. I don't exactly remember but I was called and asked to supply dates for which I might be available to
sit for a deposition.
Q. Do you know when you were first disclosed as an expert witness in this case?
A. No. No.
Q. And you were first contacted by a secretary?
A. I believe so, yeah.
Q. Did he or she tell you about the case?
A. No, just wanted dates.
Q. Have you had any other conversations, aside from scheduling the dates in which you were available for this deposition with anybody from Mr. Schultz's office about your testimony?
A. Well, I met Mr. Schultz last night for dinner, and we talked about the case then.
Q. Now, you indicated that somebody from Mr. Schultz's office sent you some materials around the beginning of August of 2009, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. What materials were sent to you?
A. I was sent 16 depositions; which included Ms. Gray, the brother, children, the cook at the restaurant, some - you know, and I can't remember all the names. But those depositions.
I was sent a couple of photographs of Mr.
Gray, Mr. Charles Gray, and family photographs. I was
sent a kind of family tree, that's about the best way I could describe it, kind of a table listing who's related to whom. And I was sent a document that contained quotations from the depositions relating to brand use or cigarette brand use over time.
MR. SCHULTZ: Which is work product, for the record.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
MR. WALDEN: You're taking the position that that's work product?
MR. SCHULTZ: Well, it is work product, yes, because it's a selection of quotations from the depositions, so it shows what we thought was important from the depositions. But to be clear, they are quotations of depositions rather than summaries of testimony.
MR. WALDEN: Have you prepared a privilege log, Mr. Schultz, to present to us today?
MR. SCHULTZ: No.
MR. WALDEN: Well, I would take the position that we are entitled to a privilege log of any documents for which you are claiming a work product privilege.
MR. SCHULTZ: Right. I would oppose that position. If you want to send me a request for
production, I'll give you a privilege log.
MR. WALDEN: Okay. And we don't need to argue about it on the record.
MR. SCHULTZ: I agree.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Aside from the depositions that you mentioned, the family photographs and the document with quotations from deposition testimony regarding brand use, have you reviewed any other case-specific materials in this case?
A. No, that's -
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. That's the universe of material related to this case I've reviewed.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Did you request those materials that Mr.
Schultz sent to you?
A. As is always my practice, I said I'd like to see the deposition testimony or any materials that help me establish what I need to know to offer my opinions in the case. And follow-up questions, what do I need to know? So go ahead and cut to the chase.
Q. You anticipated my question. Go ahead.
A. You know, simply to locate the, in this case, the decedent. Sometimes, of course, it's the
plaintiff. I n this case it's the decedent, the smoker, in historical time and historical place. And, you know, have some, you know, some sense of his smoking history; particularly, you know, the beginning portion of his life. Let me rephrase that. The beginning portion of his smoking experience.
Q. And we'll get into a little bit more of that later. Have you done any research of your own specific to this case? And I understand that you've done a lot of general background research, but I'm talking about only research specific to this case?
A. No, I have not.
Q. Before this deposition you did not provide defendants with any case-specific reliance materials; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Did you bring any of the materials that you reviewed specific to this case with you today?
A. Well, the depositions were in paper format, kind of heavy, I didn't bring them with me. But, you know, I mean, I think you know what the depositions are.
Q. But did you bring any other, any of the other materials that you reviewed specific to this case?
A. No, I did not.
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I'm handing you deposition Exhibit 1, which is the Notice of Case-Specific Discovery Deposition Duces Tecum for Plaintiff's Expert, Louis Kyriakoudes, Ph.D. Have you seen this document before today?
A. Yes, I have.
Q. And you've already turned to the portion of Exhibit 1 that's actually labeled at the top Exhibit A. And that contains a list of materials that we have requested that you bring with you today. Do you see that?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you bring any documents in response to these requests with you today?
A. Today I did not come with any responsive documents. I simply did not have time to print out my current CV, but I've supplied that in the last two weeks. I haven't updated it since my last deposition.
MR. SCHULTZ: And I think, just for the record, on the CVwe could probably get one faxed if you want one to have reference to and walk through if you don't have one recently produced.
The rest of the stuff, by the way, except for the family tree and the photos, I'll get that stuff to you if you want it. I didn't
really think it would be of any interest since it's facts known to everybody. What's work product I told Dr. Kyriakoudes not to bring.
MR. WALDEN: Okay. I would ask that you produce those pictures, if you wouldn't mind, and the family tree.
MR. SCHULTZ: Okay. And the pictures, by the way, have been produced in discovery but I'll be happy to show you which pictures I gave him.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. And I do have a copy of your CV, and I'll show it to you and see if it's a current copy.
So is it fair to say you didn't bring any documents with you to the deposition today?
A. That would be fair.
Q. Did you discuss with Mr. Schultz what materials you needed to bring with you to the deposition today?
A. Yes. And, in fact, he just represented the substance of that conversation, indicating that some of the items, as has already been mentioned, were work product; and, therefore, I should not bring them with me.
MR. SCHULTZ: And we did notify you that all the reliance materials for the generic deposition
would be deemed reliance materials in this case as well, which was a substantial amount of information.
MR. TEPIKI AN: And, for the record, Mr.
Schultz and I did exchange emails and it's my understanding that we weren't required or expected that he would bring the generic reliance materials with him today for this depo as a case-specific depo.
MR. SCHULTZ: Right.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, we talked about your CVjust a moment ago. And I'm handing you Deposition Exhibit 2. And I'd ask that you take a look at that and tell me if that is a current copy of your CV?
A. I have one that's more current than this, which I will get to you. And if you want I can tell you the difference.
Q. Yes, if you could just tell us the difference.
A. I include a list of the cases in which I have testified, you know, at the end of my CV, as indicated on this one. And the more current version has the more current list of cases. So that would be the only significant additional information.
Q. And what additional cases have you testified since the CV that we've marked as Exhibit 2 was produced?
A. Sure. This seems to not have any of the Engle Progeny cases in which I've testified since January of 2009, this year.
Q. I n how many Engle Progeny cases have you testified since January of 2009?
A. Well, I participated in a generic videotaped deposition in January. I testified in the Sherman case - I'm sorry, Hess. Hess, which I think was the first of the Engle cases. Then after that I testified in a case called Ferlanti. I mean, I would think these would be known to you, but I'll go through it.
MR. SCHULTZ: Is this just trial testimony we're talking about?
A. Trial testimony, yeah, yeah, before juries.
And then the videotaped depo. So the Ferlanti case.
The Sherman case in Broward County. Then the Martin case in Pensacola. And then this summer two additional trials, Barbanell in Fort Lauderdale, Broward County; and Campbell in Escambia County, Pensacola, Rorida.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. So as we sit here on September 1st, 2009 you've testified in the Hess, Sherman, Ferlanti,
Martin, Barbanell and Campbell cases this year, correct?
A. Yes, that would be correct.
Q. And you've served as the plaintiff's expert witness in all six of those cases, correct?
A. That would be correct.
Q. I'm now handing you Exhibit 3 which is Plaintiff Carolyn Gray's Second Amended Expert Disclosures. Have you seen this document before today?
A. No, I've not seen this particular document.
Q. On Page 4 is the beginning of a portion of the disclosure pertaining to your opinions in this case; is that correct?
A. I'm looking at Michael Cummings. Let me-I'll find myself.
MR. SCHULTZ: Page 7, top of Page 7.
A. Yeah, I'm on Page 7.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. I apologize for that. So on Page 7 is the beginning of the portion of the disclosure pertaining to your opinions in this case, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And is it fair to say you did not review this disclosure before it was served in this case?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. This particular document, no. Although I've seen this. This is the standard boilerplate language that I use in disclosures.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Is it a common practice for you to allow lawyers to serve disclosures regarding your anticipated testimony without first reviewing those disclosures?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. This language I wrote some time, you know, towards the end of 2008, maybe early 2009. But I don't remember exactly when. But some time, you know, approximately ten months, ten to eleven months ago.
I wrote this disclosure language, sent it to Mr. Schultz; and this has been reproduced verbatim in many, many disclosures. So I have no problem with this particular language. It's a fair and accurate reflection of my opinions and expertise and intended testimony.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Is it fair to say that your anticipated testimony in the cases that we've referred to as Engle Progeny cases is generally consistent?
A. That's fair to say that, yes, that's true.
Q. And it doesn't matter to you any of the case - strike that.
It doesn't matter to you when your opinions are disclosed for any specific nuances of any case to be reflected in that disclosure?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. That's true.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. It's fair to say that your expert disclosure is the same regardless of the facts of any particular case?
A. That's true. Because, I mean, the facts of my research and expertise are the same.
Q. I'll represent to you that that disclosure,
Exhibit 3, was served on August 12, 2008. Had you done any research specific to this case before that disclosure was served?
A. Meaning a year ago on this particular case?
Q. As of - before August 12, 2008 had you done any research pertaining to the Gray case?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. No, I had not done any research.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. We are finished with that one.
A. Should I hand it to her?
Q. Sure. That'd be great.
I'll hand you Exhibit 4, which is Plaintiff
Carolyn Gray's Third Amended Expert Disclosures. Have you seen this document before today?
A. No, I have not.
Q. Did you review this disclosure before it was served in the case?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. No, I have not.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. I will represent to you that this disclosure was served on August 11th, 2009. Had you done any research specific to the Gray case before this disclosure was served?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. No. No.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Did you talk to Mr. Schultz or any other lawyer representing Carolyn Gray about this case before August 11th, 2009?
A. Only to the extent that I mentioned earlier of supplying dates for potential deposition scheduling.
Q. Right. And that was a conversation you had with Mr. Schultz's secretary; is that correct?
A. That's right.
Q. So my question is: Did you talk with Mr.
Schultz or any other lawyer representing Carolyn Gray
about this case before August 11th, 2009?
A. No, I didn't.
Q. We're finished with that one, too.
Will you be providing opinions specific to the smoker in this case?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. Well, I'm often asked this question. And my answer will be consistent with what I've said in the past, which is I may in my presentation or direct testimony make reference to say, for example, history of advertising the particular brands actually smoked by Mr. Gray.
I may make - you know, I may be asked about, you know, where he grew up, characteristics of those places perhaps. And general contextual kinds of opinions.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Aside from intending to offer testimony about advertising for the particular brands of cigarettes you believe Mr. Gray smoked; where Mr. Gray grew up and the characteristics of those locations; and the historical context of Mr. Gray's life, do you intend to offer any other expert opinions specific to the smoker in this case?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. That's what I've done in the past. That's what I intend to do in this case.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Who was the smoker in this case?
A. Mr. Charles Gray.
Q. And he's deceased, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. I've reviewed some of your previous testimony. In other cases you've testified that you don't need to know anything about the smoker in the case in order to give your opinions; is that correct?
A. Well, it -
MR. SCHULTZ: I'm sorry, is the question is it correct that he's given that testimony in the past?
MR. WALDEN: Yes. Yes.
A. Which case? I mean, do you have a citation for that? If you don't, that's okay.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. I'm just asking you generally. Have you previously testified that you don't need to know anything about a particular smoker to provide your opinions?
A. Well, you know, many of my opinions - I mean, I talk about a wide variety of things. Many of
my opinions don't require a knowledge of the life and history of the particular smoker involved in the lawsuit, that's true, for many of my opinions. I've testified, for example, on, you know, industry activities in terms of shaping public knowledge. You know, those don't depend upon any particular smoker.
Q. Right. Do you recall ever testifying that you didn't need to know anything about a particular smoker in order to provide your opinions about a case involving that smoker?
A. I'm not sure if I said it exactly that way.
But, you know, I've said many times that I don't see my role as being the biographer of the plaintiff or of the smoker. And all I need to know really is to situate that particular person in a historical place in time, as we mentioned a few minutes ago. And I've been very clear about not kind of, you know, serving as the biographer of the smoker.
Q. If I understood you correctly, I think you just said that you are not the historian for any individual smoker; is that correct?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. I said biographer. If I said historian, I misspoke. I meant to say biographer.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Is there a difference in your mind between being a historian and a biographer in terms of providing testimony about a person's life?
A. Yes.
Q. And what is that difference?
A. You know, biographers generally seek to know very - you know, seek to know as much as possible of the thoughts, the beliefs, you know, the kind of inner mind, if you will, of their subject, the person for whom they're, you know, putting together a biography. You know, writing a life lived is what that means.
I understand my role as a historian as going kind of on a issues of context, history of the tobacco industry and its activities; a historian of what the public knew about the risks of smoking and what they didn't know at certain points in historical time.
And I've never been confronted with an evidentiary base that was sufficient enough for me to make a judgment using what I understand to be the methods and materials and standards of my profession to make an affirmative judgment as to whether any particular smoker or plaintiff knew as an individual something or not.
So the best I can do is talk about, say for example, what the public knew, a portion of the public,
based upon, say for example, on surveys or polls, you know, depending upon the kind of data I'm drawing upon; what they knew, when they knew it, those kind of issues. I've been very clear about that. So I think that clarifies your particular line of questioning.
Q. It does, thank you. You don't consider yourself to be a biographer for Charles Robert Gray, do you?
A. I do not consider myself to be his biographer, that's correct.
Q. You're not a historian of Charles Robert Gray's life; is that correct?
A. That would be correct, yes.
Q. Why did you read the depositions then if you don't see yourself as the historian of Mr. Gray's life?
A. Well, again, it is helpful for me to know some, you know, basic things about where he's located in historical time and space and some sense of his brand history, simply because you're going to ask me about it. And as a practical matter, when I've come in and I've not mastered the depositions it has become something that you like to ask me about. I think it's kind of a time waster. So it's a way of being efficient in terms of the depositions.
Q. So reading the fact witness depositions has
risen in importance to you over the course of your time serving as an expert witness in tobacco cases; is that fair to say?
A. No, it's been the same.
Q. You've always read the fact witness depositions?
A. I've - well, the reality is sometimes I've not had time. Or, you know, I was once deposed on a case where there were four plaintiffs. I couldn't keep them straight. So, you know, I'm not perfect in that regard. But what I've outlined for you is really all that I need to know.
MR. SCHULTZ: And now that he's finished the answer, because I don't want to be accused of coaching him, we've gone kind of a long way into what he usually does in other cases. The deposition here today is about what we've asked him to do in this case. So I think this is remote and irrelevant, for the record.
MR. WALDEN: I understand.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Do you feel that it would reduce your credibility in a case if you were to provide expert testimony when you had not read depositions, the fact witness depositions that were taken in that case?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. It depends.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. What does it depend on?
A. It depends on what opinions I'm offering.
Q. Well, in what type of case would you not need to provide - to read the fact witness depositions in order to provide credible expert testimony?
A. Well, I once testified in a case in which I was asked about the actions of the tobacco industry and the public statements of the tobacco industry over the course of historical time and it's affect on the general public's understanding of the risks of smoking. That would, you know, that's just a straight historical issue. It doesn't matter who, you know, was involved in the litigation. You know, that would be an example of that.
Another example would be if I was asked my opinions - and all of this I've testified in every case. Fteople, you know, I can't control the questions that the attorneys ask me. But in some cases I've been asked, you know, about the industry's formation of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee and the role of the Hill and Knowlton Agency and those issues. Those are important issues. They're matters of history that do
not depend upon any particular individual smoker. That doesn't change the facts of that history. Wouldn't you agree with that?
Q. So it's your testimony that the individual -strike that.
It's your testimony that particular documents and information that are available to the public are irrelevant to any smoker regardless of whether he or she saw them or not?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. I wasn't talking about that. That question does not logically flow from what I just said. Which is fine, I'll answer your question, but I just want to point out that that has nothing to do with what I just said.
You've asked me now a question about public information and public media, as I try to parse through what you just asked me. You know, there are some distinctions on this. You know, time is an issue. Somebody born in 1920, I would discuss different kinds of advertising and media as part of a historical presentation, than someone born in 1950.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. When did you read the depositions in this case?
A. This week.
Q. And this week, today is September 1st, correct?
A. Yes. Well, I mean in the days leading up to today. So I guess technically I should have said last week.
Q. Okay. So within the last seven days was the first time you've read the depositions in this case?
A. That's correct, yes.
Q. And that was after your most recent amended expert witness disclosure was served on August 11th, correct?
A. That's right. Because I would have received the materials on or about that date.
Q. How long did you spend reading the depositions?
A. About five hours over a few days.
Q. So you were able to read 16 depositions over the course of five hours?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. Well, I didn't read every word in every page of every deposition because not all the material in those depositions was relevant for my opinions.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. So you skimmed the depositions; is that fair
to say?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. Some of them I skimmed; some of them I read more carefully.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Which ones did you read more carefully and why?
A. Well, I read most carefully the brother's deposition, that would be Mr. John Gray.
Q. And why did you choose John Gray's deposition as the one to read most carefully?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. Well, he's the person that had the longest direct firsthand experience with Charles.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Were there any of the depositions that you completely disregarded?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. Yes.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Which depositions did you disregard?
A. Well, it was a short one. I'm not remembering the name of the individual, but it was pretty clear that there was a deposition that may have been taken in mistake by somebody who worked in the
Mesquite Charlie's Restaurant. And, in fact, did not know the smoker. And I didn't spend much time on that. But there might have been some confusion about when he said Mr. Gray, who they were - who the attorneys thought he was referring to and who the deponent thought he was referring to.
There were other - I skimmed through the wife's deposition. But, you know, a lot of that had to do with, you know, business affairs, which is not relevant for my testimony, for my opinions. So I quickly skipped over most of that.
And I found out the other depositions were not - the children, I mean, they were not around when he was first smoking, so there wasn't a lot of value in those depositions for my opinions.
Q. Did you read any of the depositions cover to cover, word for word?
A. I read the brother's deposition cover to cover, word for word.
Q. And what methodology did you use to determine which depositions you would or would not read cover to cover?
A. Well, I had the benefit of a family tree which indicated the date of birth and the relationship of the deponents. Is that the correct term?
Q. Deponents.
A. Deponents, thank you. And, you know, people that Mr. Gray knew, you know, later in his life, his friends, they may be relevant for other aspects of the case but for my professional opinions, having that information and then doing my quick skim through deposition confirmed that those were things I did not have to spend a lot of time on.
Q. I don't want to put words in your mouth, so I want you to tell me in your own words what you think is - what type of deposition testimony you think is relevant to your testimony in this case?
A. Good quality firsthand testimony in this case relating to the circumstances around which Mr. Charles Gray began smoking.
Q. Is there anything else?
A. That's really it. You know, and what he smoked.
Q. So you were looking for deposition testimony from individuals who you believed, based on the family tree, had firsthand information about Mr. Gray's smoking initiation; is that correct?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. That's correct.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. And you weren't looking at anything else?
A. That was the most important thing I was looking for. I mean, I read through John Gray's deposition carefully. It was, in fact, happened to be quite interesting. Skimmed through the wife's deposition. Briefly reviewed the son's and daughter's deposition. And did not review the friends' and peripheral individuals.
Q. How long did it take you to read John Gray's deposition?
A. His particular deposition took me probably about maybe an hour and fifteen, hour and twenty minutes, hour and a half, you know, with interruption.
Q. So then you used the approximate three and a half or three and three-quarters remaining hours to skim through the other fact witness depositions you were provided in this case?
A. That's right. I mean, there were 16, so it was a large number. I felt an obligation to, you know, at least, you know, acquaint myself with the materials to make an evaluation.
Q. Did you take any notes or do any highlighting while you were reading or skimming these depositions?
A. No.
Q. Did you prepare any type of report for this case?
A. I did not.
Q. Why not?
A. I wasn't asked to.
Q. Why did you not take any notes while you were reviewing the depositions?
A. I didn't need to. I was able to, you know, gather the information I needed.
Q. And you were able to process all of that information and retain it; is that fair to say?
A. That is fair to say.
Q. In how many Engle Progeny cases have you been disclosed as an expert?
A. I couldn't give you an accurate answer on that.
Q. You don't have any idea?
A. Well, I couldn't give you an accurate number.
Q. What's your best estimate?
A. Last time I checked it was seventy, but it may have increased.
Q. So you believe you've only been disclosed as an expert seventy times in the Engle cases?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. That's not what I said. Last time I checked
it was seventy. That was some months ago. I don't keep up with that.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Well, when was the last time you checked?
A. Probably in January.
Q. And you don't keep any type of records about which cases you've been designated to testify as an expert witness?
A. No, I don't. There's no need to.
Q. It doesn't matter to you?
A. No. Only - it only matters to me when there's actual work to be accomplished.
Q. Is it true that you allowed various plaintiffs' lawyers to disclose you as an expert witness before you know anything about a particular case?
A. Yes.
Q. You've worked with Mr. Schultz, the plaintiff's lawyer in this case, in previous cases, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. In how many cases have you testified at trial as an expert witness for Mr. Schultz?
A. Where he was involved?
Q. Or his firm, yes?
A. One. I'm not sure how you would count preservation of deposition by videotape. That's not really a trail.
Q. I was asking about trial testimony.
A. Yeah.
Q. But you anticipated my next question. So you testified once at trial for Mr. Schultz and his firm; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And how many times have you testified at deposition as an expert witness for Mr. Schultz or somebody from his firm?
A. This would be the third time.
Q. You testified earlier that you met with Mr. Schultz last night to prepare for your deposition today; is that correct?
A. Well, we discussed the case.
Q. Was anybody else there besides you and Mr. Schultz?
A. No.
Q. What did you discuss?
A. He mentioned the issue of the attorney work product, that came up earlier in terms of the documents. He asked me my reactions to my review of the depositions. I explained those to him.
Q. How long did you meet with Mr. Schultz last night?
A. Well, we went to dinner at a steak house. We were at dinner maybe an hour and twenty minutes, of which not all of that was spent discussing the case.
Q. You spent an hour and twenty minutes or less discussing the case with Mr. Schultz last night in preparation for your deposition today; is that correct?
A. Yeah, over dinner.
Q. Right. And then you met with him this morning, too, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you discuss this case this morning while you were at breakfast?
A. Yes. Yeah, we did.
Q. For how long did you discuss it?
A. About twenty minutes.
Q. What did you talk about this morning?
A. Mr. Schultz reiterated the issue of the work product materials, which I didn't bring with me. And we talked more about Mr. Gray and the course of his life and the things that I thought were important.
Q. Aside from the depositions and the photographs and the family tree that you reviewed before this deposition did you review any other
documents to prepare for the deposition?
A. No.
Q. Have you billed plaintiff's counsel yet for your work in this case?
A. No.
Q. Do you plan to bill plaintiff's counsel for your work in this case?
A. Yes.
Q. At what hourly rate do you plan to bill plaintiff's counsel for your work here?
A. My standard hourly rate, which is $400 an hour.
Q. Do you expect to testify live at trial?
A. That's my expectation and understanding.
Q. And what hourly rate do you charge for trial testimony?
A. The same.
Q. So you charge $400 an hour for your work regardless of whether you're reviewing documents, testifying at deposition or testifying at trial; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And I assume you will bill defense counsel $400 an hour for your time during this deposition?
A. That has been my practice.
Q. Have your billing practices changed in any way since your last deposition?
A. No.
Q. Switching gears now. Dr. Kyriakoudes, what opinions are you prepared to offer in this case?
A. What opinions? Well, I'm prepared to talk about -
Q. Right. Let me just interject real quick and say what case-specific opinions are you prepared to talk about in this case? I understand that you've given your generic deposition testimony, and I don't want to get into any of that today.
A. Okay. Thank you for clarifying that.
MR. SCHULTZ: Well, and let me add one more clarification. The generic didn't necessarily cover the full gamut of common knowledge stuff that could be gone into. I mean, he has his whole base of common knowledge testimony that he's given many times that we didn't fully tap in the generic but that's still all on the table.
I just want everyone to be perfectly clear about what we're talking about when we say generic.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. And do you recall my question?
A. I recall. In terms of case-specific opinions in this case, if asked I may talk about the kind of world that Mr. Gray grew up in in central Alabama in the 1930s and 1940s; what life was like, you know, at that time in that part of the world. You know, I may offer - I may be asked and would respond about, you know, his smoking initiation, you know, how that reflected broader historical patterns of smoking initiation; how it may have deviated from the general patterns as understood through our review of historical records. And, you know, discuss the history of advertising and the kind of ads that were used to promote the brands of cigarettes that he smoked.
Q. Is there anything else specific to this case?
A. Specific to this case. You know, if asked about, you know, the public's understanding of the risks of smoking over time. I won't offer an opinion as to what Mr. Gray knew or didn't know affirmatively because I don't have the evidentiary record for that.
Q. Could I just interject one second? And I don't mean to cut you off, but did you say you would or would not opine about Mr. Gray's understanding of the risks of smoking?
A. I would not offer an opinion as to what he knew or didn't know affirmatively because I believe
there is not sufficient historical record for anybody to make that judgment.
But I may be asked to discuss the kinds of advertising, like from his time period. So those are the kinds of opinions I'm prepared to offer in this case that are case specific.
Q. And I didn't mean to cut you off. I just didn't understand. Like I said, I didn't hear you.
So as I understand it, you are prepared to offer case-specific opinions about the world in which Mr. Gray grew up in in the 1930s and '40s; Mr. Gray's smoking initiation and how it reflects broader historical patterns or may have deviated from broader historical patterns; the history of advertising; and the public's understanding of the health risks of smoking. Is that a fair assessment of the opinions that you are prepared to testify about in this case?
A. Yeah, that are case specific.
Q. Okay. Thank you. Have you ever met Charles Robert Gray?
A. No.
Q. Have you ever met Carolyn Gray?
A. No. Nor have I met anybody involved.
Q. You've never met any of the facts witnesses who have testified in this case?
A. That's correct.
Q. Have you reviewed any of Mr. Gray's medical records?
A. No, I have not.
Q. Did Mr. Schultz tell you any facts about Mr. Gray?
A. No.
Q. Did any of the plaintiffs' lawyers tell you any facts about Mr. Gray?
A. No.
Q. Is it fair to say that any facts you know about Mr. Gray you learned from reading John Gray's deposition and skimming the other fact witness depositions?
A. That's fair, yes.
Q. Do you know when Charles Gray was born?
A. 1935.
Q. Do you know where he was born?
A. Clanton, Alabama.
Q. Do you know anything about his religious practices?
A. Well, his father was a Baptist preacher. The testimony is, is that his personal engagement with the faith was less than that.
Q. What do you mean by that?
A. From my reading of the depositions he does not seem to have been -- I don't know how personally religious he was or not, his own personal faith beliefs, but in terms of objective practice he does not seem to have been, you know, a never-miss-a-Sunday kind of church goer.
Q. So it's your understanding based on what you have read and skimmed that he was not a consistent church goer; is that what you're saying?
A. Yeah, that's a better way to put it than the way I described it.
Q. But you don't, you don't know what Mr. Gray personally believed in terms of religion, correct?
A. That would be correct.
Q. And you don't know any of his personal practices when it came to religion, other than -MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. -- than perhaps not going to church every Sunday?
A. That would be correct.
Q. Do you know where he attended elementary school?
A. I thought it was when their family moved down towards Smith Station but I'm not -- I'd have to double
check the deposition to affirmatively state that.
Q. Where is Smith Station?
A. Kind of halfway between Opelika and Columbus, Georgia, roughly.
Q. So you believe Smith Station is in Georgia?
A. No, it's in Alabama.
Q. Do you know -
A. Columbus is in Georgia.
Q. Do you know where Mr. G"ay attended high school?
A. I'm not recalling exactly. It may have been Smith Station but I'd have to refresh my memory on that.
Q. Do you know how far Mr. G"ay got in school?
A. No, I don't know that.
Q. Do you know how Mr. Gray made a living throughout his life?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. Well, he had a variety of occupations.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Okay. And do you know what those occupations were?
A. Yes.
Q. What were they?
A. He was involved in the trucking industry.
Q. What was his job within the trucking industry?
A. Well, for a while he drove a truck, that was pretty clear. He also developed communication equipment for trucks, got involved in that, that line of work, CB radio amplifiers, they described it, linear amplifiers, as his brother described it.
He had a stint working in Mexico involved with fishing. He also was apparently a very successful restaurateur in the last phase of his career.
Q. Do you know how old Mr. Gray was when he started smoking?
A. Yes. His brother reports he was around 12 and a half to 13-ish. You know, in that general area.
Q. Do you know if anybody else has provided any testimony about when Mr. Gray started smoking?
A. Well, I didn't see any other firsthand testimony in the evidentiary record that I reviewed.
Q. What other testimony did you review that discussed Mr. Gray's smoking initiation?
A. I believe his wife made a statement about when he started smoking.
Q. And what did she say?
A. I'm not recollecting, cause I basically relied on the statements of the brother who said he was
there with him. So I thought that was pretty good.
Q. So is it fair to say you're relying on John Gray's testimony and disregarding Carolyn Gray's testimony when it comes to when Mr. Gray started smoking?
A. Yeah, that's fair.
Q. Do you know where Mr. Gray was living at the time he started smoking?
A. Yeah, in Smith Station.
Q. And you don't know why that he started smoking, do you?
A. No. That's not of interest to me.
Q. You don't know the circumstances surrounding the first cigarette he smoked?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. The very first cigarette? Well, I mean, the descriptions of his early smoking circumstances are discussed in John Gray's deposition.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. But everything you know about what are the circumstances surrounding of Mr. Gray's initiation of smoking comes from John Gray's deposition and John Gray's deposition only; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you know what brand of cigarettes Mr. Gray
smoked first?
A. Well, in the deposition they mention a set of cigarettes that were early, you know, early use cigarettes.
Q. And what brands were those?
A. Well, they mention granular tobacco, two granular tobacco brands, Dukes and Bull Durham. They mention Camel cigarettes. There's a mention of Chesterfield, Kools. There's a mention of Lucky Strike early on. This is for the earliest period of his smoking initiation, that's what comes to mind.
Q. Is it fair to say that you do not know what brand of cigarettes Mr. Gray smoked when he smoked his very first cigarette?
A. That's true. These all pertain to I guess what you would call the, you know, early experiences of initiation over, you know, over a period of time.
Q. Okay. But you don't know which brand he smoked first?
A. No, I'm not recollecting that.
Q. You don't know why Mr. G"ay smoked his first cigarette, do you?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. You already asked me that. No, I don't.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. And you don't know why Mr. Gray smoked any cigarette throughout his lifetime?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. Well, you know, all we have is the testimony of the people around him who offer opinions. So, no.
I mean, there is in one of the depositions there was a mention that he may have turned to Marlboro Lights because he thought he could quit, you know, that it would be a low nicotine, low tar, you know, quitting cigarette. There was a mention of that. I'm forgetting which deposition, but I did see that.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. But you don't have a specific expert opinion as to why Mr. Gray smoked any of his cigarettes or any brand of cigarettes throughout his life, correct?
A. As opposed to any other brand?
Q. Right.
A. No, that's true. That would be true, yes.
Q. Do you know if Mr. Gray enjoyed smoking?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. I don't know either way.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. You're not going to testify as to why Mr.
Gray started smoking or continued to smoke, are you?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. He as an individual?
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Yes.
A. I don't have an expert opinion on that.
Q. You've talked about some of the brands that you believe Mr. Gray smoked around the time when he first began smoking. Do you know what other brands Mr. G"ay smoked during his lifetime?
A. Later in his smoking career. Well, it's very clear from the evidence that I reviewed that Winston was a principal or a leading brand of choice for him for a long period of time. He also smoked Marlboros. There is a discussion of that. And I made reference to that in an earlier question. Those seem to be the principal brands of his adulthood.
Q. Are the brands of cigarettes that Mr. G"ay smoked relevant to your case-specific expert testimony in this case?
A. Really only to the extent that I've mentioned already, which is, one, when I discussed the history of advertising. And while my position has always been that cigarette advertising first and foremost shapes the public understanding of the product category for the cigarette. So there's a generic element to all
cigarette advertising. There is some, you know, kind of interest in looking at the advertising of the specific brands that the individual used.
The other is, it's not so much a brand issue but the type of cigarettes that people smoke, at least in the history of the smoking health debate, changes over time. And that does impact the history of the smoking and health debate. And the example here that I'm thinking of, first introduction of filters, and then later the introduction of low tar, low nicotine or so-called hi-fi brands, ultra lights, lights and those types.
Q. You don't know what, if any, cigarette advertising that Mr. Gray ever saw during his life, do you?
A. Affirmatively he as an individual, like linking one ad to him affirmatively and absolutely, no,
I can't make that. I can talk about the kinds of advertisements that prevailed during his lifetime.
Q. I understand. But my question is pretty simple. You can't point to any specific advertisement that ever existed in this world and say that Mr. Gray saw it; is that correct?
MR. SCHULTZ: Asked and answered.
A. That's correct.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. You don't know what role, if any, advertising played on Mr. Gray's personal choice of smoking cigarettes, correct?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. Yes. I've said many times, I don't have the evidence to plumb into the mind of, in this case, the deceased smoker. So, no, I won't offer that kind of opinion. Simply talk about historical context and what was out in the country at that time.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. And you're not going to testify about the role of advertising, if any, in anyone's choice to smoke or choose a particular brand; is that correct?
A. Any particular individual, no.
Q. Do you intend to use any specific cigarette advertisements at trial?
A. Yeah.
Q. Okay. Which ones?
A. Well, I haven't prepared my exhibits for this. But, you know, since Camel was an early brand of his, I think it will show, I would like to show the jury Camel advertisements from the 1940s.
I'm recollecting just now that the Philip Morris brand was also one of the brands discussed early
on, which I left out of the list that I supplied to you earlier. So some of those early ads.
Mr. John Gray recollects hearing Philip Morris radio advertisements. So, you know, we'll focus, you know, share some of those with the jury. I think those are good.
Chesterfield is an early brand, so we'll show some Chesterfield ads to give the jury a sense of the historical context for the period. Lucky Strike was mentioned, so choose some Lucky Strike ads. Kools perhaps. They were mentioned as an early brand. You know, there's a large number of advertisements, and I'll probably choose from those.
Q. You mentioned specifically that John Gray recalls hearing some Philip Morris radio advertisements, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. But you don't know if Charles Robert Gray ever heard those radio advertisements, right?
A. That's right. John Gray reports hearing radio ads. I don't know if his brother affirmatively heard that or not.
Q. By "his brother" you mean the decedent in this case, right?
A. That's correct, that's what I mean.
Q. You don't know whether any particular cigarette advertisement had any influence on Mr. Gray's decision to smoke?
A. That's correct. You've asked me that earlier. My answer is still the same, no.
Q. Do you intend to talk about a document called "A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers" at trial?
A. I might.
Q. For what purpose?
A. If Mr. Schultz wants me to explain what I call the Hill and Knowlton story. The "Frank Statement" is part of that.
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Gray ever saw or read "A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers"?
A. No, I don't.
Q. You don't know whether Mr. Gray ever heard or read any other statements by tobacco company executives, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. If he did you have no idea how he reacted to them?
A. That would be correct.
Q. You don't know whether he ever heard of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, do you?
A. Don't know either way.
Q. You don't know whether he ever heard of the Council for Tobacco Research, do you?
A. That's correct.
Q. You don't know whether he ever heard of the Tobacco Institute, do you?
A. That's correct.
Q. You don't know whether he ever saw anything published by any of these entities, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. You would agree that anything Mr. Gray did not see or read would have had no impact on his beliefs about the dangers of smoking, correct?
A. I would disagree with that.
Q. On what basis?
A. Well, you know, just because you don't read the particular newspaper story doesn't mean that the issue isn't discussed, that it doesn't shape the public debate. You know, the water cooler conversation, if you will. So, no, just because he may - you know, just because I can't establish as a historian whether he or any other particular individual affirmatively saw or didn't see a particular item of information in the public media doesn't mean those things didn't have an impact.
Q. But that doesn't mean that they did have an
impact on Mr. Cray's, does it?
A. Well, they may. They may not have. The way I've always done this is I've explained to the jury the history and explained, you know, for example, my research on what the general state of public understanding was and how that changed over time and the forces that influenced it. And my position is it's for them to decide what the degree to apply that to Mr. Gray or any other particular plaintiff and that's their job -
Q. Sir -A. - and I respect that.
Q. Sir, do you believe that you can provide credible expert testimony in this case that an advertisement or other document or statement that Mr. Gray never saw or read had an impact on his personal smoking decisions?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. No, I would not get down to that level of one-to-one correspondence or one-to-one detail.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Gray smoked filtered or unfiltered cigarettes?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. Well, he smoked Winston; he smoked Marlboros.
Those would be filtered cigarettes.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Do you know if he ever smoked unfiltered cigarettes?
A. Well, he's reported to have smoked Lucky Strikes and Chesterfields and Camels early in his career. Those would be unfiltered cigarettes.
Q. Do you know if he smoked regular or light cigarettes?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. There's evidence of his smoking light cigarettes, yes.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. You don't know why Mr. Gray chose to smoke any of the brands that he smoked during his lifetime?
MR. SCHULTZ: Asked and answered.
A. Well, you asked me this already, and I'll give you the same answer. There is evidence in the deposition testimony, and I'm forgetting which deposition, that at least in this regard he shifted to Marlboro Lights because he thought that would help him quit smoking because it was a lower nicotine cigarette, or at least he perceived it as lower nicotine cigarette.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Do you intend to offer that as an expert opinion in this case?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. Well, it's part of the evidentiary record, something I might take into account. All I can do is testify that there's evidence of that. I'm not going to say, in keeping consistent with my -- you know, I can't peer into his mind through the veil of time. So all I can - you know, I'm very clear as to the basis of any judgments I make.
And in this case, you know, that's the evidence. And, you know, it's up to anybody evaluating that evidence on the jury to accept or disregard it based on their own critical sensibilities and their role as jurors.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. I n your role as an expert in this case you are not going to opine about Mr. Gray's motivations for smoking Marlboro Light cigarettes, for instance?
MR. SCHULTZ: Asked and answered.
A. Yes. And, you know, you're hitting around this a lot, and maybe because you've never deposed me before, which is fine, because I get a lot of repeat deposers. But I can tell you now I'm going to be
consistent with all of my prior testimony in that I'm not going to say that Mr. Gray did this specific thing and knew this specific thing simply because I as a historian don't have, you know, enough evidence.
MR. WALDEN: Why don't we go off the record and take a quick five-minute break.
(A Short Recess.)
MR. SCHULTZ: On the record. I want to note for the record we had faxed down after the start of the deposition the two photographs that we copied or provided to Dr. Kyriakoudes. Although one of them is pretty grainy, I think if you look at the photographs we've already produced in discovery you'll be able to see precisely which photos they were.
And we're also handing over two sheets, individual sheets entitled: Family Group Sheet of The Gray Family. One is the family of Charlie Gray as father and one is the family of Charlie Gray as son. And they'll be, I'm sure, marked or attached to the deposition.
The rest of the materials that we discussed are the work product materials that we've already talked about.
MR. WALDEN: Thank you, Mr. Schultz. I'd like to go ahead and mark these as Composite Exhibit 5.
(Exhibit Number 5 was marked.)
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, have you reviewed any interrogatory answers in this case?
A. No, I haven't.
Q. Are those not relevant to your opinion?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. They were not in the materials that I was provided. And in the past I have looked at interrogatories but they were not in the materials that I had before me.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Do you feel that looking at the interrogatory answers in this case would in any way affect your testimony?
A. No.
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. I'd like to talk to you in more detail about the brands of cigarettes that Mr. Gray smoked during his life. And I know you've run through a whole host
of cigarette brands earlier today.
But if you could and to the best of your ability kind of walk me through chronologically what brands of cigarettes Mr. Gray smoked and when?
A. Okay. There are the set of brands that he smoked at the beginning of his experience as a smoker when he was a youth. That would be Camel, Chesterfield, Philip Morris, Kool, some mention of Lucky Strike. And those would be associated with his early years as a smoker.
Q. Okay. And let me just stop you right there.
And when you say "early years" as a smoker, what time period are we talking about?
A. Oh, okay. From approximately 1947 to the mid 1950s where the evidence points to him becoming a Winston smoker upon the introduction or soon thereafter the introduction of the Winston brand. And that seems to have been, from my reading, his principal brand for quite a while.
Q. Let me cut you off again there, if I could.
You said that became his primary brand, is that what you said?
A. I said principal.
Q. Principal, okay.
A. But primary, you know.
Q. Well, I'll use your words. I had written down "primary." I want to use your words. You said Winston at some point became his principal brand. When is your understanding that that became his principal brand?
A. The mid 1950s.
Q. Okay. And how long was Winston Mr. Gray's principal brand of cigarettes to your knowledge?
A. From the evidence I reviewed that seems to be the principal brand that he smoked until there's evidence that he smoked Marlboros towards the end of his life.
Q. Do you know when Mr. Gray started smoking Marlboro cigarettes?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. I don't know exactly when. But there is discussion of frequent use of Marlboro in the early '90s, 1990 onward to his, I guess presumably to his death in 1994.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. To the best of your knowledge Mr. Gray began smoking Marlboro cigarettes sometime in the early 1990s until his ultimate death?
A. Right, that's my best understanding.
Q. Okay.
A. But, again, I focused on, you know, kind of the front end of his smoking history.
MR. SCHULTZ: And now that he's completed the answer, I want to state for the record, we don't feel constrained in his trial testimony to what he can recite from memory in a deposition.
MR. WALDEN: I understand.
MR. SCHULTZ: Okay.
MR. WALDEN: I just want to know what he -MR. SCHULTZ: No, I only state it in case you want to ask follow-up questions or do whatever.
And I just want it to be clear.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. You've mentioned the Camel, Chesterfield,
Philip Morris, Kool, Lucky Strikes as the cigarettes he smoked during his youth. And I believe earlier, just to be fair, you mentioned you believe he smoked Duke and Bull Durham tobacco during that time as well?
A. Right. As loose or so called granular, roll-your-own tobacco, yeah, that was mentioned.
Q. Do you know if Mr. Gray had a principal brand of cigarettes during his - the time period that you characterized as his youth before he started smoking Winstons in the mid 1950s?
A. I don't know.
Q. So you wouldn't know which, if any, of those cigarettes, those brands of cigarettes or types of cigarettes he preferred?
A. That's correct.
Q. Are there any other brands of cigarettes that you can recall Mr. Gray smoking?
A. There may be others, but these are the ones that come to mind.
Q. Okay. Do you know whether Mr. Gray ever quit smoking?
MR. SCHULTZ: Let me object to the form. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
MR. WALDEN: Okay. Just what's wrong with the form?
MR. SCHULTZ: Well, I mean, he quit smoking every time he put out a cigarette. I think the question is ambiguous unless we all agree on what you mean by "quit."
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Okay. Dr. Kyriakoudes, what do you understand the term "quit" to mean in the context of smoking?
A. Right. You know, my understanding is, is that to permanently stop smoking.
Q. Okay.
A. For a long period of time.
Q. And at what period of time do you think one has to quit smoking in order to quit under your definition?
A. You know, I've never given that particular issue consideration. I mean, you know, the old yarn of Mark Twain is, you know: Quitting smoking is easy,
I've done it a thousand times. Paraphrasing. I think that maybe points to the form objection.
But I'm not sure if, you know, people that practice professionally smoking cessation have a definition. You know, like for example, no sign of cancer for five years is often considered to be a benchmark on what is cured. So I don't know if there's something equivalent in a technical sense that exists for quitting smoking. I'm not prepared to give an answer on that.
MR. SCHULTZ: Right. And there is a technical definition, but it's beyond his area of expertise, so he won't be asked questions about that.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Well, can we agree for purposes of this deposition that quitting smoking - we'll agree on a definition that quitting smoking is somebody who stops
smoking, doesn't have a cigarette for a period of three days in the hope of never smoking again. Can we agree on that just for the purposes of the questions that I'm going to ask you?
A. Sure. I'll call that a quit attempt.
MR. SCHULTZ: Okay. And I'll object to it because it calls for subjective knowledge.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Okay. Do you know whether Mr. Gray ever attempted to quit smoking?
A. Well, let me backtrack. I'm going to answer your question. But let me backtrack and take back the three day thing. I can say there is discussion of his difficulty in quitting smoking. And that's what I recall from the testimony.
Q. Do you know what efforts Mr. Gray made to quit smoking during his life?
A. No, I don't. I thought - I'm trying to recall from my reading of his wife's deposition. There may have been discussion of nicotine replacement therapy. I'd have to check that deposition to confirm that.
Q. You're not sure as we sit here today what methods or efforts Mr. Gray made to quit smoking at any time during his life; is that correct?
A. That's true, yes.
Q. And I take it you don't know how many times he tried to quit smoking?
A. No.
Q. And you don't know when he tried to quit smoking?
A. No.
MR. SCHULTZ: This is all beyond the scope of
his opinion testimony I just want to say for the
record.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. And you don't know why he may or may not have tried to quit smoking?
A. That's correct.
Q. You're not an expert in addiction, are you?
A. I am not.
Q. Okay. So you're not going to provide any testimony about whether Mr. Gray was addicted to cigarettes?
A. I am not.
Q. And you're not going to give any opinions about the ease or difficulty Mr. G"ay had quitting smoking; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Isn't it true, Dr. Kyriakoudes, that there
are many sources from which smokers learn about the health risks of smoking?
A. Yes, that in anything, yes.
Q. And one source is personal physicians who warn their patients about the health risks associated with smoking and encourage them to quit, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you know whether any of Mr. Gray's doctors warned him about the health risks of smoking and advised him to quit at any time?
A. His brother mentions two doctors, one that smoked and one that did encourage him to quit smoking.
Q. Do you know when those conversations took place?
A. I'm not recalling the exact dates from the testimony.
Q. Do you have a ballpark time period?
A. My recollection is, is that they were from later in Mr. Gray's life.
Q. Another source of information about the health risks of smoking could be a person's family and friends, correct?
A. Yes, that's true.
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Gray's family or friends ever told him that smoking could be bad for his
health?
MR. SCHULTZ: Let me enter a standing objection on this. The rules require me to object to the manner of taking a deposition when the manner of taking the deposition is improper.
You've already established he's not going to talk about any subjective knowledge on the part of Mr. Gray. So I am going to have a standing objection to any testimony that pertains to whether someone told him this or what he understood the risk to be or anything along those lines.
MR. WALDEN: Okay.
A. Could you say the question again, please?
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Gray's family or friends ever told him that smoking could be bad for his health?
A. I'm not recollecting.
Q. Do you know if any of his family or friends ever advised him to quit smoking?
A. I'm not recalling clearly, no.
Q. Do you know what, if anything, Mr. Gray's parents told him about the risks of smoking?
A. I don't know what his parents told him.
Q. Do you know what, if anything, Mr. Gray's
children told him about the health risks of smoking?
A. I don't.
Q. Do you know how Mr. Gray reacted when people told him about the health risks associated with smoking?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form, in addition
to the standing objection.
A. I'm not recollecting that.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Do you know how Mr. Gray reacted when people asked him to quit smoking?
MR. SCHULTZ: Same objection.
A. Well, his brother reports that in deposition, and what he reports his brother saying is that he can't quit.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Do you know what Mr. Gray knew or believed about the risks of smoking at any point in time?
A. No.
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Gray ever acknowledged that cigarette smoking could be deadly?
A. I don't know.
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Gray believed that cigarette smoking was hurting his health during the 1950s?
A. I don't know.
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Gray believed that cigarette smoking was hurting his health in the 1960s?
A. I don't know.
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Gray believed that cigarette smoking was hurting his health in the 1980s?
A. I don't know.
Q. Do you know if Mr. Gray ever considered himself to be addicted to cigarette smoking?
A. I don't know.
Q. Do you know if Mr. Gray ever believed that cigarette smoking could be addictive?
A. I don't know.
Q. Another source of information about the health risks of smoking is things that people learn in school, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know what Mr. Gray learned at school, if anything, about the health risks of smoking?
A. I don't know.
Q. Have you researched what textbooks were used in schools in Smith, Alabama in the 1940s and the '50s?
A. Not that particular school district, no.
Q. Do you know what health textbooks were used in his schools?
A. No, I don't know the specific books that were used in his schools.
Q. Another source of information about the health risks of smoking is the government, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Gray knew in 1964 that the Surgeon General had released a report on smoking and health?
A. Whether he knew it was released?
Q. Correct.
A. His brother reports that, yes.
Q. Do you know when Mr. Gray learned that the Surgeon General released, in 1964, a report on smoking and health?
A. No, I don't know exactly when.
Q. Do you know how Mr. Oay reacted when he learned about the 1964 Surgeon General Report on smoking and health?
A. Well, his brother reports that he greeted it with considerable skeptasism.
Q. Do you know why Mr. Gray was skeptical about the information contained in the 1964 Surgeon General's Report?
A. No.
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Gray ever read the
Surgeon General's Warning on cigarette packages?
A. I wouldn't know either way.
Q. Now, the news media are another source of information about the health risks of smoking, aren't they?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Gray typically read the newspaper?
A. I don't.
Q. So you wouldn't know which newspapers he read at any point in his life; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Gray ever read any newspaper articles that said smoking was bad for his health?
A. I don't.
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Gray typically read magazines?
A. I'm not familiar with his reading habits.
Q. So you wouldn't know any magazines that Mr. G"ay read during any point in his life?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Gray typically watched television?
A. You know, I know they report one in his home
when he was a child, but I don't know his television viewing habits.
Q. So you wouldn't know whether he ever saw any stories regarding smoking and health on the television news; is that correct?
A. That's right.
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Gray typically listened to the radio?
A. Well, they report having one. But I don't know his particular radio habits.
Q. Do you know whether he ever heard any stories on the radio about smoking and health?
A. He may have. You know, I'm prepared to discuss the information that was broadcast over the radio. But, you know, I can't connect him to one particular - any particular, you know. I can't be there next to him with the hand on the radio dial. But I can talk about the information environment and the kinds of information that were, you know, that he might have encountered or even was likely to encounter.
You know, and maybe I'm interpreting your question too literally. Because I understand your question to mean, you know, linking him affirmatively with those exact words on a specific time and date, you know, placing him. The best I can do is talk about the
kinds of information, the historical context of his time and place and talk about what his world was like.
Q. But you don't know specifically what Mr. G"ay may have heard on the radio; is that correct?
MR. SCHULTZ: Asked and answered, in addition
to the standing objection.
A. He as an individual, no.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. No, you do not know?
A. That's correct. I do not know.
Q. Another source of information about the risks, health risks of smoking is public health authorities, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Gray ever saw or heard any public service announcements on TV or on the radio regarding the health risks associated with smoking?
A. Again, my answer would have to be the same as the previous answer, which is, you know, I can discuss the kinds of information that was out there, things he might have seen or even likely to have seen given his particular circumstances. But I can't, you know, be there next to him while he's watching or listening to a specific message.
Q. Right. And I understand that you are a historian and you are prepared to testify generally about what type of information was available in the public.
But I just want to limit my question to Mr.
Gray. You don't know what - you don't know whether Mr. Gray ever saw or heard any public service announcements on TV or on the radio regarding the health risks of smoking; is that correct?
A. Any particular, yeah, I cannot affirmatively have him listening to any particular item on the radio or the TV.
Q. Are any details about Mr. Gray's life relevant to the opinions you intend to offer in this case?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. Yes.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Okay. What opinions - or strike that.
What details about Mr. Gray's life are relevant to the opinions you intend to offer in this case?
MR. SCHULTZ: Asked and answered.
A. When he was born; where he was born and grew up; generally the brands of cigarettes that he smoked.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Okay. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I asked you what details about Mr. Gray's life were relevant to the opinions you intend to offer in this case. And you told me when he was born, where he was born and where he grew up and generally what brands he smoked; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Are there any other details about Mr. Gray's life that are important to you and relevant to your opinions in this case?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. That is it.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. How would you describe the area of expertise that you bring to this case?
A. Well, I'm a historian of the cigarette industry. So I can speak to the history of the industry in developing and promoting and marketing their product over a broad historical time.
I'm an expert in the role of the cigarette in American life. I can speak to the history of the ways in which the cigarette was incorporated into American culture, American ways of living from a cultural and social perspective.
I'm an expert in understanding what the public knew about the risks of smoking over the broad course of time and at particular points in time.
Because, of course, that's a changing and developing historical narrative. And so depending upon what time period you want me to talk about, the story is going to be a little bit different.
I can speak as to the kind of information that was released to the public and discussed in the public media as part of the smoking health debate as that unfolded, particularly in the 1950s, '60s, '70s,
'80s. So, you know, historian of the cigarette and a historian of the cigarette in American life.
Q. Now, you just went into great detail about your area of expertise, and I appreciate that. I just want to make sure that you don't claim to have expertise in more areas than you have claimed in this case and in prior cases.
In other words, your testimony in this case is going to be consistent with what you have testified previously; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Now, you are a Ph.D., correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. But you're not a medical doctor?
A. No.
Q. You're not a psychiatrist?
A. No.
Q. You're not a psychologist?
A. No.
Q. You're not an expert on marketing?
A. Not as is currently practiced. I do have significant expertise in the history of advertising and history of marketing from a historical perspective.
But, no, I don't claim myself as an expert in the science of marketing as is practiced today.
Q. Now, do you consider yourself an expert in the science of public relations?
A. Again, my answer would be the same as the one I just gave for marketing. I have researched the history of public relations and can understand it and offer opinions in a historical perspective but I am not a practitioner of public relations as its understood today as a contemporary activity.
Q. Are you an expert in the science of risk perception?
A. No.
Q. I believe you've already told me this, but you're not going to offer any opinions on whether Mr. Gray was addicted to nicotine?
A. That's right, you've already asked me that.
And I'm not going to offer that opinion.
Q. Are you currently planning or invited to offer any lectures on the history of smoking and health?
A. I am on the program of a meeting called the meeting of the History of Science Society. And they're meeting the weekend of, I think it's November 13th, 14th. I believe that's a Friday and a Saturday. And I'm preparing, and I'm not finished, a presentation.
Q. And what generally will your presentation be about at the meeting of the, is it the History of Science Organization?
A. History of Science Society.
Q. Society, okay.
A. Yes. I'm looking at the ways in which tobacco industry researchers used psychological, anthropological and social psychological methods to understand smoking behavior. This is outside of the issue of addiction but rather to understand the smoking initiation and all the kind of social and cultural and practical re-enforcers that go around the practice of smoking and how that knowledge developed over time.
Q. Do you intend to offer any opinions related to the presentation that you're giving, the subject
matter contained in the presentation you're giving, at the trial of this case?
A. I'm not sure. I mean, you know, that's something if Mr. Schultz wants to ask me about that. But I hadn't intended. That's not my intention as I see it right now.
Q. As I understand your previous testimony, that what you were talking about presenting at this program of the meeting of History of Science Society would be outside the scope of what you usually testify; is that correct?
A. Yeah, I've never been asked about this particular issue. I see it as a - I've never been asked about that particular issue in the past, yeah.
Q. Have you given any - well, strike that.
Where is the meeting of the History of Science Society on November 13th and 14th?
A. Oh, where's it going to be held?
Q. Yes.
A. Arizona. Where in Arizona, I can't remember.
MR. SCHULTZ: And just so you know, we would consider it fair game. I don't know as I sit here whether I would ask him. If you want to explore it at the deposition, feel free. I don't know whether we will go into it or not during the
trial.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Have you given any lectures on the history of smoking and health in the last six months?
A. No.
Q. Have you given any interviews on the topic of smoking and health in the last six months?
A. No.
Q. Have you taught any classes that focus on the health risks of smoking?
A. Ever, or in the last six months?
Q. Ever?
A. Yes.
Q. When did you teach those classes?
A. I last taught a course on the history of the cigarette, or actually the course was on tobacco and American life, a little bit broader, in the spring of 2007. And I'm slated to teach that in the spring of ten, 2010.
Q. How many hours is that course?
A. It's a three-hour credit course, which is the standard regular semester credit course.
Q. Is that an undergraduate or graduate program?
A. This will be for undergraduates.
Q. Is the curriculum for the course you are
planning to teach in 2010 any different than the course that you previously taught?
A. It will probably be a little bit different.
I haven't sat down and planned out what I intend to do this spring. But the format of the course I'm doing in the spring is different. It's a seminar instead of a lecture course. And so when you have a seminar there tends to be more discussion and readings, so that it probably will be a little bit different.
Q. Are you working on any articles or books relating to the health risks of smoking?
A. Well, I'm researching. I haven't started writing but I'm researching this presentation that I have to give in November. I'm almost finished with the research on that. And I'm working on a history of the cigarette in American life.
Q. Do you plan to publish the presentation that you intend to give at the meeting of History and Science Society?
A. Once I finish it I'll look at it. My goal is, yes, to make a publishable article out of it, yes.
Q. You have presented at conferences to plaintiffs lawyers who sue tobacco companies; is that correct?
A. I gave a presentation at the Tobacco Products
Liability conference in 2003.
Q. And that was mostly attended by plaintiffs' lawyers; is that correct?
A. They were attorneys, public health people, government lawyers. There was a variety of people.
Q. Your understanding is there were plaintiffs' attorneys present at that conference?
A. Yes, there were plaintiffs' attorneys there.
Q. Aside from that time in 2003 have you ever presented at any conferences in which plaintiffs' attorneys who sue tobacco companies were present?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to form.
A. There may have been attorneys. I gave a talk at something called the Deposition and Trial Testimony Archive Conference in 2004 in San Diego. And I know that Dick Daynard participated in that conference as one of the people. I guess he would qualify under that group. There was at least one at that meeting. But it was a large crowd and I don't know who else. You know, it was public health people, it was in conjunction with a meeting of the Tobacco Section of the National Cancer Institute so it was a large, large meeting.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Have you conducted any new historical research on smoking and health since your last
deposition?
A. No.
Q. Do you still believe that people's perceptions regarding the issue of smoking and health are a national instead of a local issue?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. Well, that's a little bit of a mischaracterization of how I've explained this. The smoking and health debate generally unfolded in the national media because it was, you know, driven by new research that was released, you know, and by the industry's attempt to counter that research.
MR. WALDEN: Okay. There was a form objection. And I understand the nature of the objection.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Do you believe that people's perceptions regarding the issues of smoking and health are a national instead of a local issue?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. I don't know how a perception could be national or local. That doesn't make sense to me. And so maybe I'm not quite understanding what you're asking.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Well, do you believe that to form your opinions you need only consider national press coverage?
A. Oh, okay. Yeah, I mean, the smoking and health debate unfolded on a national level. And as a practical matter national media is adequate to understand this, yes.
Q. Okay. And as I understand it from reviewing your previous testimony you've done a significant amount of research on the New York Times; is that correct?
A. That's true, yes.
Q. And specifically their coverage of the - of smoking and health issues?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you agree that there is some regional variations in perceptions regarding the health risks of smoking?
A. Yes, there are regional variations in perceptions, yes.
Q. And that has been true over time and not just today, correct?
A. Well, when I answered that question, I'm referring to it historically. Yeah. So, yes, that's
true.
Q. I just want to make sure we're clear.
A. Yeah.
Q. I wasn't trying to trick you. Do you know where Mr. Gray has lived throughout his life?
A. Well, he lived a number of different places.
We've already mentioned his youth in Alabama. Of course, he spent -- you know, he spent some time in Mexico as part of his living arrangements. And then he lived in Pensacola for a long time.
Q. What regional variations would you expect to find regarding the perceptions regarding the health risks of smoking between New York and Alabama?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. Well, the differences I found in my research are that when you break down the public opinion data by region. And so I can't say Alabama as distinct from the southeast simply because the data won't let me go there without very high rates of error. And here I'm talking from a statistical sampling, you know, issue.
But it is clear from the polling data that people in the southeastern United States are less likely to believe that smoking is harmful than people in the northeast.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. What regional variations regarding the perceptions of the health risks of smoking would you expect to find between New York and Michigan?
MR. SCHULTZ: Same objection.
A. Let me get back to that previous answer because when I broke the data down I broke it down south, and the rest of the country. And so that's the - that's part of my disclosure documents. You can find it in there. Which is different than the northeast. So it's south and nonsouth. That's the breakdown that I did.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Have you done any sort of state-by-state analysis regarding the perceptions of the health risks of smoking?
A. State-by-state, no.
Q. Have you ever looked at the perceptions regarding the health risks of smoking in Mexico over time?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. I have not.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Would you expect somebody living in New York to have greater or lesser access to information than
Mr. Gray about the health risks associated with smoking?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. It depends.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. You know my next question. What does it depend on?
MR. SCHULTZ: Same objection.
A. You can have people living in New York neighborhoods, let's say for example, low income neighborhoods, that can appear as isolated, that can be very isolated from all kinds of main-steam information and patterns and cultural norms or not. I mean, it really depends on, at least from my perspective, social class, levels of education, kind of a series objective social characteristics about the population. So it's difficult to answer your question based on just that kind of broad generalization.
Q. So what social criteria from Mr. Gray and his upbringing is relevant to your opinion in this case?
A. He seemed - well, it's not really relevant to my opinions. You know, he's a southerner who lived in a variety of places in the south, with some interesting experience, you know, abroad, Mexico. He doesn't seem to be unusual. Or, you know, there's no
special characteristic one way or the other.
Q. If you were to know that Mr. Gray spent some time during the 1950s living in Flint, Michigan would that change any of the opinions you have in this case?
A. No. That's right, he got married up there.
And I forgot to mention that earlier. But, no. I mean, you know, many southerners went to Hint to work in the car factories.
Q. If you knew that Mr. Q"ay had also spent some time living in California, would that change any of the opinions in this case?
A. No.
Q. If you knew that Mr. Q"ay spent some time living in Missouri would that change any of the opinions in this case?
A. I was aware that he was - there's a discussion of him opening a restaurant in Branson.
That doesn't affect my opinions, no.
Q. Is it fair to say that you have not reviewed any of the local newspapers for the places where Mr.
Q"ay has lived?
A. Yes, it's fair to say that.
Q. So you don't know what kind of coverage they provided regarding the health risks associated with smoking?
A. Not in those particular newspapers, that's correct. I've reviewed a great deal of newspaper coverage. My experience has been that the vast preponderance of the stories on smoking and health tend to be AP, UPI, Reuters Wire Service stories.
Q. Do you know where Mr. Gray was living in 1964 when the Surgeon General's Report was released?
A. I'm not recollecting exactly where he was.
Q. I'll represent to you that Mr. G"ay was living in Pensacola, Horida in 1964 when the Surgeon General's Report was released. You have not reviewed coverage of the 1964, the release of the 1964 Surgeon General's Report in the Pensacola newspaper; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Or in any other media outlet?
A. That only exists in Pensacola?
Q. In the Pensacola area?
A. That is unique to Pensacola, that's correct.
Q. Do you intend to do any further research on this case, Doctor?
A. Right now I don't.
Q. Do you intend to provide any opinions in this case about Philip Morris USA's conduct that you have not provided in the prior Engle Progeny trials?
MR. SCHULTZ: I'm sorry. I missed the question, I was talking.
MR. WALDEN: No problem.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Do you intend to provide any opinions in this case about Philip Morris USA's conduct that you have not provided in the prior Engle Progeny trials?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. As I sit here I don't intend to. I think I've covered that in the Philip Morris focused cases.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Do you intend to provide any opinions in this case about Lorillard Tobacco Company's conduct that you have not provided in the prior Engle Progeny trials?
MR. SCHULTZ: Same objection.
A. My testimony is going to be consistent with what I've offered in the past. So I don't anticipate that.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Same question with respect to R.J. Reynolds?
MR. SCHULTZ: Same objection.
A. Same thing. Now, it may be the case that I'm asked to explain what I call the Hill and Knowlton story and focus more on industry conduct, industry knowledge. That came up in some of the Broward trials.
And so my opinions will be consistent with those.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. You're not going to be offering anything new that we haven't heard before; is that correct?
A. That's correct. I mean, I have testified now in 16 tobacco trials and I've been consistent. Each trial has had a different focus. Sometimes I've only been asked about one area of my expertise and sometimes I've been asked about the full spectrum of my area of expertise. So there is variation in the scope of the story. But the opinions are consistent.
Q. I understand. Do you intend to provide any opinions in this case about Liggett's conduct that you have not provided in the prior Engle Progeny trials?
MR. SCHULTZ: Same objection.
A. No. With the proviso that the Ferlanti versus Liggett, I'm putting that in the Engle set. And I'm not sure if that's technically correct or not from a legal standpoint. But that was a trial this spring.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Sure.
MR. SCHULTZ: And for your benefit, to the extent specific trial exhibits constitute research, we will, of course, like y'all will, be going through and identifying specific ads, for
example, or industry documents or what have you, so. And there's no way for I think any of us to talk about that now, but that will occur of course.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. Do you intend to provide any opinions about any other tobacco companies we have not discussed that you have not provided in the prior Engle Progeny trials?
A. No.
Q. Do you intend to provide any opinions in this case about the conduct of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee that you have not provided in the prior Engle Rogeny trials?
MR. SCHULTZ: Same objection.
A. No.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. How about the Council for Tobacco Research?
MR. SCHULTZ: Same.
A. Again, no.
BY MR. WALDEN:
Q. And how about the Tobacco Institute?
MR. SCHULTZ: Same.
A. Again, my testimony will be consistent with my previous presentations.
MR. WALDEN: Why don't we take a quick break and let me flip back through my notes.
THE WITNESS: Sure.
(A Short Recess.)
MR. WALDEN: Dr. Kyriakoudes, I don't have any further questions for you at this time. Thank you very much. Some of the co-defendants might, however.
THE WITNESS: Okay. Wonderful.
MR. TEPIKIAN: Amanda.
MS. JACOBS: Yes. I have just a few questions.
EXAMINATION BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, good afternoon. This is Amanda Jacobs, and I represent RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company. We've met before.
A. Yes.
Q. How are you?
A. I'm well, thank you.
Q. Because I'm attending by phone, if you could let me know if you can't hear me, I'd appreciate that.
A. Okay.
Q. I'd like to ask you a couple of questions about why you review fact witness depositions in various cases, including in this case.
A. Okay.
Q. You mentioned earlier that you reviewed the depositions in this case partly because the defense lawyers tend to make a big deal about it in your depositions; is that correct?
A. That is true.
Q. Okay. So would it be fair to say that at least one of the reasons why you review the fact witness depositions in a particular case is to get the defense lawyers off your back, so to speak?
A. Well, you know, they'll ask me a lot of questions. And, you know, I've been quite clear as to what kinds of information I need about the smoker to formulate my opinions. And that's pretty straight forward and I stick to that.
Yeah, you know, I read through them and answer the questions as best I can.
Q. Okay. I don't think you really answered my question there though. My question was: One of the reasons why you review the depositions in various cases is because the defense lawyers give you a hard time about them if you don't read them; isn't that right?
A. Well, yeah, that would be fair, one reason.
But, you know, the principal reason is to discover the kinds of information that I've mentioned previous today prior to your questioning this morning with the other attorney.
Q. Okay. The deposition testimony, would you agree, is not a central part of your testimony in these cases?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. Right. That would be correct. You know, I mean, deposition testimony covers many different subjects that, you know, touch on materials relating from everything from, you know, medical causation to maybe data or information relevant for, you know, the assessment of economic damages or what have you that are not things that are relevant to my area of expertise. And so a lot of the deposition testimony simply does not relate to my area of expertise.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. But there's a lot of other stuff in depositions other than what you just mentioned, right?
A. Oh, yes. I was just giving you a couple of examples. Yes, I mean -
Q. I think in response to one of Mr. Walden's questions you identified about three facts or factual
areas that are really what you look for in the deposition, and that is when the smoker was born; where the smoker grew up; and the brands the smoker smoked?
MR. SCHULTZ: Asked and answered.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. Those are the three factual areas that you're most interested in when you review depositions, right?
MR. SCHULTZ: Asked and answered.
A. That's what I said this morning, yes.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. And everything else you don't necessarily rely on or consider as part of your opinions in these cases, right?
MR. SCHULTZ: I'll object to the form.
A. Those are the principal things I'm looking for. You know, other information is - is less important. I mean, that's how I would characterize it.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. And I think you said another reason why you review the depositions is because it saves time; is that right?
A. I'm not sure what you mean.
Q. Well, I think you said, and this was in connection with your answer that one of the reasons why you reviewed the depositions was because the defense
lawyers tend to make a big deal about the depositions if you don't read them. And you said that you liked to review them because you find that, you know, it saves time at the deposition if you can actually respond to those questions at the deposition.
A. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, that's accurate.
Q. Okay. So one of the - one of the reasons why you reviewed these depositions in these cases is to save time and get the defense lawyers off your back at the deposition?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. Off my back. Well, I don't know if I've ever used that language. It's just, you know, you guys ask a lot of questions relevant to this. And so - and my experience has been I know what you're going to ask, so I kind of review that material. I've stated what I need from the depositions to formulate my opinions.
And that's what I principally rely on. We went over those just a moment ago.
Q. Well, do you allow what the defense lawyers ask you in a deposition to dictate your research?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. Dictate my research?
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. I mean, sure. You said one of the reasons
why you review the depositions was because defense lawyers asked you about them.
A. Is reading a-
Q. The question is: Are there other possible areas that you've reviewed simply because you anticipate that the defense lawyers are going to ask you about that?
A. I mean, you know, is reviewing a hundred page deposition research, you know? I don't know if that constitutes research.
Q. Do you bill for that time, reviewing the depositions?
A. I do bill for the time to review documents related to the case, yes. And I'm often asked by the plaintiffs' attorneys to review documents as well, so they often ask me to -
Q. Do you bill for your time reviewing depositions?
A. Yes.
Q. But you don't consider that research?
A. Not really. I simply, I put that in my mind in the category of reviewing trial documents, which I bill for. I actually don't bill for research into historical materials. That's just never been a practice of mine.
Q. Well, if it's not research what is it?
A. It's just what I said it was, it's reviewing documents, trial documents.
Q. For what purpose?
A. To prepare for depositions and trial testimony.
Q. Okay. Let's switch gears for a second. You talked about brand history being something that you consider as part of your testimony, correct?
A. That's true.
Q. So brand history, that's a fact that you rely on in your testimony in these cases?
A. Those would be facts, yes.
Q. And those are facts that you rely on to give your testimony in these cases?
A. Yes.
MR. SCHULTZ: Asked and answered.
A. They would be facts I would rely on for the reasons that I explained this morning.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. I'd like to ask you about the quotations from the depositions that you received from Mr. Schultz's office.
MR. SCHULTZ: And wait for me to object
before you respond. Go ahead, Amanda.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. Can you just describe the nature of that material for me?
MR. SCHULTZ: That's okay.
A. Yes, I can. The - they're basically quotes related to the brands, where brand usage was discussed in depositions kind of cut and pasted by brand.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. How many pages is that document? I'm assuming it's a document. It is a document? Is it an e-mail? What is it?
A. Paper document.
Q. And how did you receive that document? Did you receive it by e-mail? Did you receive it in the regular mail?
A. The mail, the post.
Q. Okay. And who sent it to you?
A. Mr. Schultz's office.
Q. And who at Mr. Schultz's office, do you remember?
A. I'm not sure who wrote the cover letter, maybe it was Mr. Schultz. I'm just not recalling. You know, basically it was a stack of documents, it was included with paper copies of the deposition testimony.
Q. Okay. And you said there was a cover letter
included?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you remember who the cover letter was from?
A. It was probably from Mr. Schultz.
Q. Okay. Do you know what it said?
A. Yeah, it was - it basically said: Here are documents for the Gray case included in this packet.
And it listed the names of 16 deponents; photographs, two pages of photographs; the document we just talked about, which lists the brand history; a document called Family Sheet or Family Group Sheet, which is Exhibit Number 5 here in this room; and it also had written on it, "attorney work product" prominently displayed on the cover letter.
MR. SCHULTZ: And let me save us some time, Amanda. The documents, if you want to send me a request for production, I'll give you a privilege log and I'll give them to Judge Terrell and he can look at them and decide whether they're attorney work product.
You're entitled to ask questions that explore whether there's existence of a privilege. I've already described to you, as Louis has, that these are documents where I
selected quotes out of depositions. That is classic attorney work product. Mims v.
Casademont would be a case in Florida you can look at to check that out.
If you want the stuff, send me a request for production. I will object, and we can have the Judge resolve it.
MS. JACOBS: Okay. Well, we do have a standing subpoena duces tecum to Dr. Kyriakoudes asking for all materials that he has been provided from plaintiff's counsel's office. So I think the current subpoena would cover this material.
MR. SCHULTZ: Okay. Well, you find me a case in Florida that says I have to do a privilege log in response to a subpoena, and I'll give you a privilege log in response to the subpoena. Otherwise, if you want to tee this up, send me a request for production and I'll respond to it.
MS. JACOBS: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the beginning part.
MR. SCHULTZ: Right. The short version is, my understanding of Florida law is I don't have to produce a privilege log in response to a subpoena directed to an expert witness. The documents are privileged. If you want to request the documents,
send me a request for production and I will agree to en camera inspection of the cover letter and the work product that I gave to Dr. Kyriakoudes and we'll let the Judge decide it.
MS. JACOBS: Okay. Is there anything else,
Matt, other than this document that I'm going to call the quotations from the depositions that you are claiming is work product that Mr. - that Dr. Kyriakoudes has received?
MR. SCHULTZ: Yeah, the cover letter.
MS. JACOBS: Okay. So the cover letter and the quotations document is the entire universe of material that you're claiming is work product?
MR. SCHULTZ: Yeah. I think that's all we've talked about, right. And you can refer to them in a request as the documents we claimed work product protection to in Dr. Kyriakoudes' deposition, and I'll agree that that will adequately cover the universe of documents which I claim the privilege.
MS. JACOBS: Okay. Is this everything? I just want to be clear that this is everything and you're not limiting what you're disclosing here to maybe a precise question that we've asked?
Because we have subpoenaed Dr. Kyriakoudes to produce all materials that he has received from
your office.
MR. SCHULTZ: Right. Here's the thing,
Amanda. I'm not playing games with you. I think we've described every document that was sent to Dr. Kyriakoudes. I think that we've produced every one of them except for the two that I just described that we claim are work product. It's just simple as that.
MS. JACOBS: Okay. That's fine. I just wanted to clarify that, Matt. I appreciate it.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. Just a few more questions, Dr. Kyriakoudes, about this quotation document that you received from Mr. Schultz's office. Was that something that you requested from Mr. Schultz or is that something that his office just sent on their own accord?
A. It would be the latter, something they just sent and included in the packet.
Q. Okay. And did you review this document that I'm referring to as the quotations document?
A. I did, yes.
Q. And why did you review it?
A. It's a short document. It was in the packet.
You know, I reviewed everything in the packet because Mr. Schultz asked me to; some things, of course, more
carefully than others based on my determination of their value to my opinions. But this was a short document and I did review it.
Q. How short, how many pages was it?
A. Oh, I think it was three or four pages, that's all.
Q. And did Mr. Schultz, did he explain to you why he thought this might be relevant to your testimony or your opinions or why it might be helpful?
A. No.
Q. Did you have any conversations or correspondence with Mr. Schultz or anybody in his office about this quotations document?
A. No correspondence, no.
Q. How about communications?
A. Yes, we talked about it. He explained, basically the same thing, he told me the same thing he just said here a few minutes ago that it was attorney work product; and therefore, not subject to the subpoena. That's how he explained it to me.
Q. And was that before or after he sent you the document?
A. Oh, no, this was - this came up, I think it came up last night over dinner. So that would have been after I received the document.
Q. Is that the full extent of your conversation about this document?
A. Yes.
MR. SCHULTZ: Asked and answered.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. So you didn't have any conversation with Mr. Schultz or anybody else about this particular document any other time other than last night over dinner before this deposition?
A. He reiterated the position that he just expressed here in the room also this morning when I went to pick him up and drive him to the - this place where we are now, the deposition office.
Q. And what exactly did he say?
A. He said that document is confidential attorney work product.
Q. What's your understanding of what work product is?
MR. SCHULTZ: I'm going to object to that.
He's not a lawyer. He's not here to give opinions on what the law is. I'm a lawyer. If you want me to give an opinion, I'll be happy to.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. Did Mr. Schultz explain to you what work product is?
A. No.
Q. Do you frequently review work products prepared by attorneys -
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. - on these cases?
A. No.
Q. And why did you do it in this case?
A. It was a four page, three or four-page summary document that I reviewed because it was in a stack of papers that Mr. Schultz asked me to review.
Q. Why didn't you just go look up the brand history in the depositions yourself?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. Well, I did get a good sense of the brand history from the depositions. To be honest with you, the summary document, you know, didn't really tell me very much more than what I - and nothing that I didn't already learn from the depositions.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. And just so I'm clear, this quotations document had quotations only about brand history?
A. That's correct.
Q. And so it didn't have quotations about any other, anything else?
MR. SCHULTZ: Asked and answered.
A. No, just brand, you know, brands smoked by Mr. Gray.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. Do you understand that work product represents the opinions of the attorneys in the case?
MR. SCHULTZ: That's a mischaracterization of the law, first of all. And I'm going to object and instruct him not to answer. Don't ask him leading questions that misstate the law.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you understand that the document that I'm referring to as quotations was prepared by lawyers, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. And that reflects the work and the strategy of the lawyers in this case, correct?
MR. SCHULTZ: Again, that's beyond the scope. This is ridiculous. He's not going to answer that question.
We've claimed work product to it. If you don't agree with this, we'll put it in front of the Judge and he can decide. That's how it works.
MS. JACOBS: Okay. Matt, I'm able to ask him
questions about -
MR. SCHULTZ: I'm instructing him not to answer that question.
MS. JACOBS: On what basis?
MR. SCHULTZ: I just told you the basis.
He's not a lawyer. You're not asking him legal questions about what constitutes attorney work product, especially when you're defining it in a way that's inconsistent with the law.
MS. JACOBS: Matt, this is something that he's reviewed in this case and that you've prepared, that you've sent to him and that he has reviewed. These are facts that he has considered in his opinions and his testimony in this case.
I'm able to ask him about the source of the material that he has reviewed.
MR. SCHULTZ: All right. First of all, that's exactly wrong. That's why it's work product.
And when the Judge sees this he'll understand this is a mountain and a molehill -a mountain made out of a molehill. It is simply a collection of quotes that talk about brand history. That's what it is.
If you want the document, ask for it.
He's not going to answer any more questions about what it was. We've thoroughly addressed this. And if you want to call the Judge on that right now, let's call the Judge right now and get a ruling on my instruction that he not answer.
MS. JACOBS: Your objections are noted. I'm going to object to the continual speaking objections.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, did you - strike that.
Dr. Kyriakoudes, you considered the material in this quotations document as part of your preparation for this case, correct?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. It was something that I looked at as part of the review of the packet of documents I was sent and asked to review by the plaintiff's attorney.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. All right. It's something that you considered for your testimony in this case, correct?
A. Yeah. I mean, it - this seems to matter more to you than it did to me. But I did review it and it did describe aspects of the deposition testimony relevant to establishing brand history.
Q. Okay. So it contains facts that you're relying on for your testimony in this case?
A. Pulled from the larger set of depositions, yes.
MR. SCHULTZ: And just so we're clear on the record, Amanda, you can ask him about the facts and data all day long. That's not work product. The facts and data are not work product.
The collection of them that we put together for him constitutes work product.
That's the objection.
MS. JACOBS: Thanks for the education, as always, Mr. Schultz.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you've had discussions with Mr. Schultz about Dr. Proctor's contact with the faculty at the University of Rorida regarding research assistants doing historical research for defense experts, correct?
A. Say that again.
Q. Yeah, I'm sorry. That was a mouthful.
You've had discussions with Mr. Schultz about Dr. Proctor and this recent issue about Dr. Proctor contacting faculty at the University of Florida, correct?
A. Yeah, very briefly last week, as I explained in a deposition last week, yes.
Q. Okay. And that was last Saturday when you spoke with Mr. Schultz?
A. Yes, that's correct.
Q. Okay. And tell me again how that conversation came about, who called who, who participated?
MR. SCHULTZ: Hang on. You've told her before?
THE WITNESS: This came up in a deposition, yes.
MR. SCHULTZ: With Ms. Jacobs?
MS. JACOBS: No, this was another case. And I'm perfectly able to ask him about it again.
MR. SCHULTZ: Well, okay. Just so you understand, Amanda, you said "tell me again." If he has told you before, I was going to object.
But I'm not going to object. Go ahead, Dr. Kyriakoudes.
A. Yeah. No, she wasn't the person asking the question, it was another guy named Hank.
Mr. Schultz called me last Saturday to discuss this deposition today briefly, mostly scheduling issues to determine, you know, for example,
dinner plans the night before.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. What else did you talk about?
A. He mentioned the Proctor situation.
Apparently there had been some kind of hearing on Friday.
Q. When you say he mentioned the Proctor situation, tell me what he mentioned?
A. Well, I had been aware of this issue with Dr. Proctor because it had come up in previous depositions. He mentioned to me that there had been a hearing and that Dr. Proctor had been subpoenaed for certain documents, emails and the like.
Q. And how long was that conversation with Mr. Schultz?
A. Not long, maybe 20 minutes.
Q. And it was just the two of you guys on the phone?
A. Yes. Yes.
Q. Okay. Did Mr. Schultz give you any advice about how to handle questions that may come up in the depositions about Dr. Proctor and this issue?
A. No.
Q. Now, you recently produced a couple of emails that Dr. Proctor had forwarded to you regarding his
contact with the faculty at the University of Florida; is that right?
A. Yeah. I - l -
Q. It was in another deposition?
A. That's correct, I produced those.
Q. Now, you received those emails from Dr. Proctor back in, I believe it was May and June of 2009; does that sound right?
A. Yes.
Q. And then you testified that you went back and you found them in the beginning of July of 2009; does that sound right?
A. Yeah. What happened was in a deposition called the Grossman deposition I was asked by an attorney to - I was explaining how I had forwarded Professor Michelle's deposition to Dr. Proctor. And he asked if I had that email. I told him I would look for it. And in the process of looking for that email I discovered these other two, which basically I had forgotten about. And that's how I discovered it. So it would have been after the Grossman deposition.
Q. After the Grossman deposition that what, that you discovered them, you rediscovered them?
A. Yes, it was in the process of searching for them after the Grossman deposition that I discovered
those emails. I forget the date of the Grossman deposition, but it was - that was the occasion to search my email.
Q. Okay. But you did receive them back in May and June?
A. Oh, yes. No, I answered that. You've already asked me about that.
Q. Are there any additional emails that you've received from Dr. Proctor, whether you were CCd or BCCd or whatever that you haven't produced, maybe perhaps that you received and then you deleted or that maybe - well, I guess that was - that's the question.
MR. SCHULTZ: Let me object to the form. Amanda, are you putting no time limitation whatsoever on that?
MS. JACOBS: No. Thanks, Matt.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. Let me rephrase that, Dr. Kyriakoudes. Are there any additional emails that you've received from Dr. Proctor, whether you were BCCd or CCd, or it was actually addressed to you regarding this issue with contacting faculty at the University of Florida that maybe you deleted? And, Dr. Kyriakoudes, I mean this to be very broad. I'm not - I'm talking about any emails regarding this issue of contacting faculty at
University of Rorida and dealing with the research assistants. Is there anything else out there?
A. No, there isn't. I supplied everything. And that includes all the categories that you've just mentioned.
Q. Okay. How do you know that?
A. Because I searched.
Q. Okay. Now, have you ever discussed the emails that you received from Dr. Proctor with Mr. Schultz?
A. I just mentioned briefly on our phone conversation on Saturday that I had discovered two emails that I had forgotten about.
Q. And why did you feel the need to bring that up with Mr. Schultz?
A. Oh, I just mentioned it. I volunteered it.
We were discussing about this issue. And I said, well, you know - basically I told him the same thing I just told you about the Grossman deposition.
Q. And did Mr. Schultz tell you that you should produce them?
A. No.
Q. Did he tell you that you shouldn't produce them?
A. No.
Q. Did he advise you on the importance of complying with subpoenas?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. Well, I don't know that those had ever been subpoenaed. I do know that when I was asked about that issue on the next deposition that I was in, as I understood the question, I immediately identified those, so.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. Have you ever reviewed the subpoena duces tecum that accompanied your Barbanell and Grossman deposition notices?
A. Yeah. I reviewed those, yeah.
Q. And is it your position that those subpoenas did not ask for these two emails?
MR. SCHULTZ: I'll object to the form. Go ahead.
A. Well, one, I didn't have a knowledge of, you know, a recollection of those emails, one. Two, I didn't think they were relevant to those depositions.
When asked about the emails by the attorney in the Grossman deposition I identified the email that I used to forward the Michelle deposition to Dr. Proctor.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. Why did you --
A. And - but let me finish. And in the process of searching for that email I discovered the other two.
Q. Why did you think that these two emails that you've recently produced were not relevant to the Barbanell and Grossman deposition?
A. Well, I've explained, I've explained this whole situation. I don't have those duces tecum in front of me. I haven't memorized them. So I'm at a little bit of a disadvantage in that I, you know -
Q. I apologize. I'm doing this over the phone.
I ordinarily, if I were there in person, I would maybe show those to you.
Do you ordinarily review the subpoena duces tecum that will accompany your deposition notices?
A. I'm sorry, did you say do I ordinarily refuse?
Q. No. I'm sorry. Do you ordinarily review them? Is that something, I mean, when you're getting ready for your deposition that you would ordinarily review the Exhibit A that is normally attached to your deposition notice that sets forth all the stuff that we ask you to bring?
A. Yes. Yes, of course I review those.
Q. Okay. So did you review the subpoena duces tecum and the accompanying Exhibit A with all the
documents that we asked you to bring before your Barbanell and your Grossman deposition?
A. Yes.
Q. And it's your position that you didn't think that those two emails that you recently produced were requested?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form. That's not
what he said.
A. Well, if I thought they were relevant I would have brought them. And if I had - you know, I mean, I comply with all of the duces tecum Schedule As to the best of my ability.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. Why is it that you only recently - strike that.
Why is it that you recently produced them?
A. The emails?
Q. Yeah.
A. Well, I have not reviewed my Barbanell testimony. It's sitting on my desk somewhere. And I guess the trial is over with, so it's not that relevant, at least in the deposition.
I did not want, in fulfilling the spirit of this process, I did not want information that I didn't realize that I had but then realized that I did have to
go unidentified when asked directly by an attorney: Do you have any information relevant to this? As was the case in the Willis deposition last week. And so when I was asked by Mr. Hank, I forget what his question was, but I interpreted the question to mean do you have anything relevant to this. I said, yes. And I gave it to him. So, I mean, basically he asked me and I, you know, gave it to him because he asked me.
Q. Okay. There aren't any additional emails out there that you've received from Dr. Proctor relating or regarding, or however you want to phrase it as broadly as possible, I'm trying to phrase it as broadly as possible, because it seems to me that you're only producing these things when you think the exact question is posed. And I want to make sure that I'm right now, Dr. Kyriakoudes, asking you if there's anything else out there relating to this Proctor issue at all that you haven't produced?
MR. SCHULTZ: Object to the form.
A. There is nothing. I have produced - well, I still haven't - I was asked about the original forwarding email. I have that email. And I actually didn't - I will happily produce that one.
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. What email is that?
A. That's the one that I referred to that I was asked about in the Grossman deposition which occasioned me to discover the other two emails. And, again, to reprise, I was asked by an attorney, you know, did you have - when you forwarded the - and this is paraphrasing - when you forwarded the deposition to Dr. Proctor was there an email? I mean, was it through email? And I said, yes. And he said, did you save that email? I think it's in my, you know, email. I'll go look for it. And when I went and looked for it I found the other two. I produced the two. But I'll characterize the original email because I want to answer your question as accurately as possible. And it said basically: Here's another expert, you know, working for the industry. That was essentially the meaning of the email and the extent of this first forwarding email.
I don't know if - you know, I just want you to have that down so that you have all that you need to know. But that is the full and complete and total set of correspondence.
Q. Okay. Do you have that email?
A. Yeah, it's still in my machine, yeah.
Q. Okay. You haven't produced that?
A. Well, yeah. I mean, but I will. There's no
secret on that. I've been asked and I -
MS. JACOBS: I'll ask right now that that be produced.
A. Right now in this office at this very minute?
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. I'm saying for the record, Dr. Kyriakoudes,
I'm asking that that original email be produced to us as soon as possible.
MR. SCHULTZ: And I don't have any problem producing it. You were already producing it in response to Mr. Hank's deposition, right?
THE WlTNESS: Right. Yeah. No, I'll do that. In fact, I can probably give it - if I gave it to one of the attorneys here in the room would that be okay?
BY MS. JACOBS:
Q. Thank you very much.
A. Yeah, I'll happily do that.
Q. Do you have any correspondence between you and anyone from Mr. Schultz office regarding this issue about Dr. Proctor?
A. No.
Q. So you don't have any emails between you and Mr. Schultz about this Proctor issue?
A. No, I don't.
Q. You don't have any faxes or letters or anything else, any kind of correspondence between you and Mr. Schultz or anybody in his office about this Proctor situation?
A. No, I don't.
Q. When was the last time you spoke or corresponded with Dr. Proctor?
A. I spoke with Robert on last Friday, kind of early afternoon about our upcoming conference.
Q. Okay. And I believe you testified about that in your last deposition, correct?
A. Yeah, that's right.
Q. Have you ever corresponded or spoken to Dr. Smocovitas from the University of Rorida?
A. No.
MS. JACOBS: I think that's all I have.
Thanks, Dr. Kyriakoudes.
THE WITNESS: You're welcome.
MR. TEPIKIAN: Giselle.
MS. MANSEUR: I have no questions.
MR. SCHULTZ: I don't have any.
MR. WALDEN: Thanks a lot for your time.
