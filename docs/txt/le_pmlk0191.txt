LOUIS KYRIAKOUDES, PH.D. after having been first duly sworn by the above-mentioned Court Reporter, did testify as follows:
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Good morning, Dr. Kyriakoudes.
How are you?
A. I'm well. Thank you. Good morning.
Q. We met before the deposition, but my name is Brad Harrison. I represent R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, okay?
A. Uh-huh (affirmative response).
Q. You understand we're here for the Carolyn Hiott matter; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you understand that we're
here as basically I think for your purposes, and correct me if I'm wrong, to talk about her deceased husband, Kenneth Hiott?
A. That's correct.
Q. You're familiar with the deposition process, so I'm going to skip all the admonitions to try to save us
7
sometime. But the only thing I will say is I tend to talk fast sometimes. Feel free to slow me down. If one of my questions is unclear, please, correct it.
And also we are in what I would say is a little bit of an echo chamber, so I will do my best to communicate as clearly. But if at any point we break down, please, let me know.
A. I will.
Q. Okay. First thing I want to do is hand you what I have marked as Exhibit 1. Dr. Kyriakoudes, this is the Amended Deposition Notice for this case; is it not?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you've seen this before I assume?
A. I have.
Q. I would like to go to Schedule A on the back. Schedule A requested a number of materials related to this case; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. I'm going to try to
8
shortcut going through the list of the items. You've brought some materials with you today?
A. I did responsive to this Schedule A.
Q. Okay. Let's do this the easy way. Why don't you just go ahead and tell me what you brought responsive to Schedule A?
A. Sure. The first things that I brought which would basically be described as my file on the case. I've got a couple of photocopied items here. These are a cover letter with the two-part deposition
of Linda Beverly, and then some exhibits appended to the end of that which I will hand to you for your review.
Q. Just so we're clear on the record, the exhibits appended, these were the exhibits to the Linda Beverly deposition; is that correct?
A. I think so, yes. I think that's what they are.
Q. I'm not going to mark this as an exhibit. But for the record, you're
9
correct. It's a cover letter dated March 7th, 2012 from the Milberg Firm to you enclosing the deposition transcript of Linda Beverly, along with the corresponding exhibits.
A. I received I believe just this week by Post, it arrived I think Monday or Tuesday, these three disks. And I haven't actually reviewed the disks, save for the section that has my name under it. But those are disks of materials related to the case in some fashion.
Q. Okay. Let me just see if I
can clear this up for the record because I won't make a copy of these as well.
MR. VINIK:
Sure. Are we going off-the-record? Is that what you're saying? I may not have heard you right. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Let me just do it this way.
Let's make these CDs an exhibit along with the cover letter. Is that fair enough for you?
A. Fine with me.
10
MR. VINIK:
Do you need those CDs back?
THE WITNESS:
No. I mean, no. I don't.
MR. VINIK:
Let's go off-the-record for a minute.
(DISCUSSION WAS HELD OFF-THE-RECORD) EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. I'm going to mark as Exhibit 2 a cover letter dated March 16th from the
Milberg Firm to you enclosing these DVDs of additional Reliance materials and the three DVDs that correspond to it.
DVD, the first one is marked DVD 1 of 1 dated March 15th, 2012. Title Tobacco Trials, Beverly, Linda, Burns & Cummings Rpts, Kyriakoudes, Native Files Production.
The other two DVDs marked DVD 1 of 2, DVD 2 of 2 also dated March 15th, 2012 are titled Tobacco Trials, Feingold Rel, Natives files production.
Dr. Kyriakoudes, I think you said this, but I just want to make sure
11
I'm clear. You have not reviewed what's on these three DVDs; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection. You can answer.
THE WITNESS:
Well, let me answer your question this way instead of yes or no and I will tell you what I have reviewed. There is a file with my name and it has some documents that are a part of my documents
set.
And I just reviewed those to make sure that they were correct. And they are just standard documents that I have disclosed in previous cases. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Okay. So, just so we're clear, I imagine when you open the DVDs, there are file folders attributable to various individuals. There is one folder for you that contains documents; correct?
A. That's right.
Q. And these DVDs were provided to you by the Milberg Firm; correct?
A. That's correct.
12
Q. But the documents in that folder are documents that you have previously disclosed in other cases?
A. Yes.
Q. Would those documents, do you recognize them as being on your others? I know you generally have a set of DVDs of materials. Are those documents
duplicative documents on your other DVD set?
A. Yes. That's my recollection.
Now, I have a very large list and you're probably familiar. It's a lot of material, many gigabytes of material.
And yes, those are standard documents and I can -- there are some documents, you know, some internal memoranda, those kinds of things.
Q. Did you ask the Milberg Firm to pull these documents for you on this disk?
A. No, no. They just sent that to me.
Q. Do you have any understanding as to why they sent you these particular
13
set of documents?
A. No, no.
Q. Okay. You haven't had any communications with them regarding those particular documents?
A. No. Just with the secretary there wanting to know if I received them.
Q. Okay. Fair enough. What else have you brought?
A. This is just my copy of the Deposition Notice. You asked for e-mails. This is a stack of e-mails with an additional document which is the invoice for the retainer which is my standard practice and so I will give that to you.
Q. Let's go ahead and mark this as a collective Exhibit 3. And I will take a look through these at the break and maybe I will have questions. Maybe I won't.
Before we move on, does Exhibit 3 contain all of the e-mails that you have related to this case?
A. Yes.
Q. And then in addition, it also
14
has the retainer agreement?
A. That was sent by e-mail. And as one of the e-mails indicates, it is an attachment.
Q. And just to be clear, you said
it's your standard agreement. You're charging $400 an hour for your work in this case?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you accept the retainer of $3,500 in advance?
A. Right. Which I then deduct from the final bill.
Q. I might as well just ask you this now. How many hours have you worked on this case?
A. I haven't sat down to calculate that, so I'm not exactly sure.
Q. Can you give me your best guess estimate?
A. It's in the neighborhood of probably a telephone call, you know, eight to ten hours maybe. But that's just a guesstimate.
Q. And maybe we'll circle back to
15
this, but just so we can move on for now, you haven't created any type of invoices for your time for this case yet; correct, apart from the fee structure and the
retainer?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. Well, do you intend to come up with a final invoice when this case is over to submit to the plaintiffs firm?
MR. VINIK:
Objection. You can answer.
THE WITNESS:
Yes. At the end of the process, you know, yeah. My bill which has been my standard practice.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. And that's all I really wanted to confirm, is that you're going to do in this case what you have done in your previous cases as far as your billing arrangements; correct?
A. Correct. That's absolutely correct. Yes.
Q. What else have you brought
16
with you?
A. You asked for a CV and so I
printed off a copy.
Q. We'll mark this as Exhibit 4.
The only question I think I have for this, is this a current version of your CV ?
A. Yes.
Q. When is the last time you updated it?
A. I actually updated that about a month ago. So, it's about a month old. Nothing big has happened in the last month.
Q. Can you recall the updates you made last when you updated this a month ago? Do you recall what information you updated?
A. I think all I added to it was I had a publication come out the end of 2011. And the title of that publication is The Rural South and the Burden of the Past. I added that.
I gave a talk, an invited lecture, at the Robert J. Dole, Super Politics at Kansas University. And that
17
was entitled the Gulf Catastrophe Zone. I
added that and I think that's -- let me just make sure. That's it.
Q. Okay. Just so let me see if I can cut this short. The lecture you gave regarding the Gulf Catastrophe, does it have anything to do with any of the topics you will be discussing in this case?
A. No. That had to do with the catastrophes that have been inflicted upon the Gulf, Katrina, and oil spill.
Q. What about the publication regarding The Rural South and Burdens of the Past?
A. That was -- the answer is no. That's an article about economic development issues facing the rural south.
Q. Okay. None of which you intend to discuss related to this case; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Anything else you brought with you?
A. No. That's it.
Q. Okay. I received prior to the
deposition a set of DVDs that contain your purported Reliance Materials.
A. (Witness nods head.)
Q. And I just want to make sure that I have what you think I have. You keep your Reliance Materials electronically; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. I received I think, apart from the DVDs we have marked as Exhibit 2,1 think I received a set of five DVDs that have your materials. Does that sound right to you?
A. That sounds about it. It's a lot of material. Yeah.
Q. I guess the question I have and maybe I didn't notice this, I think you used to have your materials on two disks. Now it's five disks; is that correct?
A. I think the difference is explained by the fact that I used to include a 60 page list of additional materials. And those materials have been put on there, and that includes I believe
there should be a substantial number of video exhibits on those disks. And I used to reference the video exhibits, but in this case the reality is is the law firm has helped to kind of assemble it altogether in a more useable package for you.
So, those video files take up a terrific amount of space. So, those two factors are going to be the explanation for the larger amounts of storage.
Q. Okay. And just so we're clear for the record, it doesn't -- the five disks as opposed to the two disks plus the list doesn't translate into a different Reliance set; correct?
A. No. I mean, when you say different, I mean I'm always learning new things and adding things, but it's cumulative. Not a completely different set of documents, no.
Q. You just mentioned that you have an evolving set of documents and that you accumulate them. Are the documents on your Reliance materials, the DVDs, does
that encompass the entire university you intend to use as your Reliance materials in this case?
A. Well, I think it's fair to say it encompasses things that I might show the jury as examples, so we will say exhibits. Here's the issue with Reliance materials, you know, I rely heavily on my experience and my knowledge and my training and, you know, 20 years worth of research as a historian.
And so, you know, short of giving you the library, I mean I know a great many things about a great many in my area of expertise.
So, maybe really I'm asking you a question and that is, you know, when you say Reliance materials, do you mean the things that I use to know about the past as it relates to the issues in this case?
Or do you mean the things that, the set of things from which I might
show the jury examples? Because in my mind there is a distinction and the
21
distinction, I want to make sure that my distinction is your distinction. So clarify.
Q. Let me see if I can clarify for you and we can get on the same page. The disks that you have provided contain all of the materials that you intend to show the jury in support of your testimony; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. I think as you explained it to me, they don't necessarily, the disks don't necessarily include every piece of material you have ever reviewed to further your understanding of the subject matter upon which you are proffered as an expert?
A. Yes. That's very good.
That's better than I would have said it.
Q. Okay. You don't intend, though, to discuss these other materials; correct?
A. Well, I mean, I'm going to answer the questions that are posed to me.
Q. You understand as an expert
22
witness the thing we're here to do today is for me to uncover what your opinions are going to be in this case; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. So, while you say I'm going to answer the questions that are asked to me, at this point you have an idea of what you are going to talk about at trial; correct?
A. Oh, I imagine my testimony will be similar to previous cases.
Q. Let me stop you there because I think I'm going to get to the basis of your opinions. I just at this point I just want to narrow, define the university of materials that I have to concern myself for trial and your testimony.
I think we have a pretty decent understanding. Let me just get the acknowledgment is, though, that you understand that it's impossible for me to
discern what you have looked at to the extent it's not on the DVDs; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
23
Well, yes. But that would be true of any expert. I mean, you know, what I know is the product of a lot of work over a long period of time. But you are free to ask me questions about it.
I'm here for that.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Well, let me just ask you this: To the extent that you have reviewed materials beyond what's on your DVD, you have discussed the sources of those materials previously, the whereabouts maybe of some of them; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
I lost you on that one. Just run it by me again. Just restate it, please.
MR. VINIK:
I didn't understand the question.
That's my objection.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. We can both agree that you have looked at some documents that aren't
24
on your DVDs for purposes of developing an expertise or understanding; correct?
A. Yes. Over many years.
Q. And in previous depositions you have identified what those documents are; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Is there any change today versus what you have previously testified to as to what those materials comprise of? MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
No. Not that I can think of. I mean, I'm tending to give testimony that resembles prior testimony.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. You mentioned that any potential exhibits are on the DVDs. The question I have for you is: Have you determined what you're going to use as exhibits in this case yet?
A. No.
Q. Do you have an idea of when you intend to do that?
25
A. I believe the trial is, at least the portion that I would participate in is in early May. Probably sometime between now and then, of course. But probably prior to trial. Generally these things, previous experience, we do this a couple of weeks before.
Q. And I know you haven't done it yet. But as of today, do you have any intention of using exhibits in this case that you have not previously used in other cases?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
I can't think of anything. I
mean, as I sit here today. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. On the Schedule A there is a number of requests that ask for, I will just summarize, sort of your case specific materials. I think it's fair to say you have an understanding of the difference between your generic opinions and your case specific opinions; correct?
26
A. That's correct.
Q. And I just want to get to the thing. Any materials that you have looked at specifically for this case?
A. Well, I have reviewed some deposition testimony.
Q. Okay.
A. I skimmed through the exhibits that were appended to the deposition testimony. That's it really.
Q. You haven't reviewed any pleadings in this case?
A. No.
Q. None of the discovery
responses in this case?
A. No, no. None of them. None of that material.
Q. No particular newspapers or advertisements?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Not specific to this case. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. And I think we're going to get
27
to it because I'm going to ask you about brands and ads and things of that sort. I think we'll get to those points, but you haven't undertaken any particular review of any particular newspapers specifically for the Hiott matter?
A. That's correct.
Q. And the same would be true for advertisements?
A. That's right. I'm just relying on the kind of national broadcasts and national media stuff that I've relied on in the past.
Q. Last question about the materials is the documents we have marked as exhibits along with the deposition of Linda Beverly, that comprises your entire file for this case if we added the DVDs that we don't have attached as an exhibit?
A. Yes. That's right.
Q. It may be in the e-mails, and to the extent you need to look at those to walk us through this, please, feel free. When were you first contacted to work on this case?
28
A. Just prior to Christmas of 2011. So, December of 2011.
Q. Okay. And who contacted you?
A. A guy named Chris Polaszek.
And it's a difficult name to spell and I think the spelling is in one of the e-mails. So maybe at the break I can give you that.
Q. It is Christopher Polaszek, P-O-L-A-S-Z-E-K. He's with the Milberg Firm; correct?
A. That's my understanding.
Q. Have you talked to any attorneys outside of the Milberg Firm regarding this case?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
No. Just the attorneys in Milberg.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. And you estimate that your work in this case is comprised of approximately eight to ten hours?
MR. VINIK:
29
Objection.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Given your best guess today?
A. Yes.
Q. How many times have you spoken with individuals at the Milberg Firm?
A. On the telephone you mean?
Q. On the telephone or in person.
A. Or in person. No times in person.
Q. Okay.
MR. VINIK:
Excluding today?
THE WITNESS:
Excluding today. I had breakfast here with Mr. Vinik. Maybe two or three telephone calls with Mr. Polaszek at the beginning of the process. And then some telephone calls with the secretaries asking for dates, you know, kind of doing scheduling issues. That's it. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Okay. As far as substantive information regarding this case, did anyone from the Milberg Firm provide you
30
any information that you didn't glean from the deposition of Linda Beverly?
A. Well, I had, early on I had a discussion with Mr. Polaszek about the materials in the case and making a determination of the things I needed to review. You know, gave me an overview of kind of an introduction.
Q. Okay. And let me just break that down. The overview, what type of overview are you referring to?
A. Well, basic facts about the decedent, Mr. Christopher Hiott, where and when he was bom, the fact that he was a white male. Those basic questions.
Q. Okay. Maybe we'll get to what you know about Kevin Hiott when we get to your case specific, but I think I get a gist of what you're saying there.
But as far as your discussion regarding the materials and what was available versus what you would need for your case, would you just give me a synopsis of what that part of the discussion entailed?
31
MR. VINIK:
Objection. If I don't tell you not to answer it, you can answer it.
THE WITNESS:
Okay. Yes. I'll answer your question now. Pardon for the disruption there.
I asked what materials were available to help me identify the early portion of his life, the smoking initiation period, the period in which grew into an addictive smoker.
And Mr. Polaszek said, well, there is this deposition here. Apparently he had two wives or had a divorce. And this woman Beverly was his first wife and, therefore, had known him when he was a teenager and, therefore, was the available evidence of his youth.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. Okay. I'll do this once and then we'll leave it be for the rest of the time. At one point in your answer you said the initiation to Mr. Hiott becoming an addicted smoker.
32
I just want to be clear. You have no intention of testifying at trial of whether or not Mr. Hiott was addicted to cigarettes; correct?
A. Well, I'm not going to offer
any medical diagnosis or anything like that.
Q. Well, and that's a partial answer to my question. You don't intend to give any opinion about whether he was addicted or not; do you?
A. No. I see what you're asking.
No. I mean, he was certainly a regular and heavy smoker. I think I can identify that. He smoked a lot.
Q. Let me see if I can shortcut this a little bit. My understanding, you're going to testify as to your understanding of the facts of Mr. Hiott's smoking, the frequency, the duration, the brand, history, things of that nature; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You don't intend to then render an opinion as to whether those set
33
of facts rendered Mr. Hiott was an addicted smoker?
A. That's not my area. So, no.
I'm not going to offer that opinion.
Q. Did Mr. Polaszek select the Linda Beverly deposition for you to review?
A. Well, I discussed with him the available testimony at the time, and I selected the Beverly deposition as the one that seemed to fit my research needs.
Q. You went right to my next question. What were you looking for?
A. Well, what I said just a few minutes ago, to ascertain the facts of his youth, his adolescence and adulthood, early adulthood as it related to smoking.
Q. And I think I can cut this even shorter. I think generally when you do a case specific opinion, you are looking for information to place the decedent or the plaintiff or the smoker in some historical context; time, place and who they are and where they are? Fair enough?
34
A. That's correct. Yes.
Q. It's a pretty accurate
description of the type of information you're looking for?
A. Yes.
Q. And that's why you chose the Linda Beverly deposition?
A. That's correct.
Q. We're going to get to other stuff in a little bit, but just to move it along. Linda Beverly and Mr. Hiott, you understand that they met in 1968; correct?
A. That's correct. Yes.
Q. Both were 17 years old at the time; correct?
A. That's right.
Q. So, as far as determining circumstances of Mr. Hiott's youth, the deposition you chose was a person that met him for the first time when they were 17 years old; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Just some predicate facts and we'll get to more later. You understand that Mr. Hiott married Linda Beverly June
of 1971 I think it was?
A. That sounds about right. Yes.
Q. And they had a son in 1980, Terrence?
A. That's right.
Q. And then they split up 17 or
18	months after that; correct?
A. That's right.
Q. At which point they didn't have regular contact to the same extent that they did during their marriage; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Just briefly, if you can give me your understanding of the type of contact that Mr. Hiott had with Linda Beverly following their divorce?
A. Well, it seems to be that the principal contact related to the issues around the son, visitation or maybe that's too technical. I don't mean it in the technical way, but you know moving their son from place to place as he would visit each parent.
Q. And, in fact, Mr. Hiott moved
out of Georgia and to Florida following the divorce; correct?
A. Yes. Moved to St. Augustine.
Q. Just so we can get some more predicate facts. You understand Mr. Hiott married Carolyn Hiott in 1984?
A. That sounds about right. I knew that he married her after their breakup, after the breakup of Ms. Beverly.
Q. I think I can try to think -I don't think the Beverly deposition specifically says the date of the Kenneth and Carolyn's marriage. But you will take me at my word that March of '84 sounds reasonable?
A. It sounds reasonable.
Q. And you understand that it's Carolyn Hiott that's the plaintiff in this case; correct?
A. Yes. Her name is listed on the header of the documents.
Q. And you did not read her deposition?
A. No.
Q. Okay. If you let me ask a
compound question, I will do this very quickly. In addition to not reading Carolyn Hiott's deposition, you also did not read Terrence Hiott's deposition?
A. That's correct.
Q. You understand him to be Kenneth Hiott's son?
A. That's right.
Q. You did not read James Hiott's deposition?
A. No.
Q. And you understand him to be Mr. Hiott's brother?
A. That's right.
Q. You did not read Evelyn Roll's deposition?
A. No. I did not.
Q. Theta Johnson's deposition?
A. No.
Q. Let me see if I can do this right. You haven't read any of the other depositions in this case?
A. No. I've just read this one.
Q. You have no intention of reading any further depositions?
A. As I sit here right now, no.
Q. Okay. And I probably should have asked you this when I was going over the work in this case. As of today, do you feel that you have completed all the work necessary to render your opinions in this case?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. You have no intention of doing any further work on this case?
A. No. Just -- no. That's it.
Q. Other than trial preparation; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. So, it's fair to say that your opinions today are going to be the same opinions you're going to render on the stand when you're called at trial; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you do intend to testify live at trial; correct?
A. That's my understanding.
Q. You didn't interview anyone who knew Mr. Hiott?
39
A. No.
Q. Have you met anyone who knew Mr. Hiott?
A. No.
Q. Never met the plaintiff in this case?
A. No.
Q. Have you done any independent research of Mr. Hiott's family or upbringing?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
No. I mean, I know a lot about that portion of Georgia, just from the fact that I'm an expert on the rural south at issue and knowing tobacco. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. Let's see if I can --1 will hand you what's been marked as Exhibit 5. Exhibit 5 is the notice of filing plaintiffs expert witness disclosure
along with the plaintiffs expert witness disclosure. It looks right to you?
A. Yes.
40
Q. And under Expert Number 2, it looks like you have been identified as the -- as an expert witness in this case; correct?
A. Correct.
Q. You're identified as both generic and case specific; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. We will get to some of the stuff, but I just kind of want to walk this part. I guess the first thing is did you see this disclosure before it was served in January?
A. Yes. This is the standard disclosure. I wrote this a long time ago. And this is, while there are other disclosures that other people have written as they filed it, this is the one that's most probably commonly used.
Q. And let me just see if I can
correct one thing or clarify one thing.
If you look at the last sentence of that paragraph, "Dr. Kyriadoudes' testimony may also include all other relevant matters in this case subject to this expert's
41
expertise and rulings of the court."
First off, did I read that correctly?
A. Yes.
Q. Second off, that's not part of your standard disclosure; is it?
A. No. I don't think I didn't write that sentence.
Q. That was added by the attorneys in this case?
A. Yeah. Probably.
Q. And I know we're going to back up to talk about your opinions. But as of today and I think you've already said this, you don't intend to offer any opinions beyond what is disclosed in your report and beyond what is discussed today; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Well, I think my opinions are spelled out by this language. I think this language covers, covers what I intend to talk about.
42
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. And fair enough. And I think that gets to my point. I just want to make sure that the language that it actually discusses, what you're going to talk about, as of today your expectation is that's all you're going to talk about; correct?
A. Yes. I think this is a good and accurate representation of that.
Q. Okay. Then let's take a walk through this. The first sentence says,
"Dr. Kyriakoudes will testify on the general subject matter of history and demography." Correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you intend to testify
about that in this case?
A. Yes.
Q. Any opinions specific to Mr.
Hiott or the Hiott case on those subjects?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Well, let me give you a specific
43
answer to that instead of just a yes or no answer, if I may. I interpret that sentence to mean, you know, methodological history as a discipline, for example. And often I begin my testimony describing the historical method and those issues. So, I understand that sentence to mean that subject area as opposed to like all history that's a big subject.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Fair enough. And you've testified to those matters in previous trials and depositions; correct?
A. Yes. That's correct.
Q. You don't plan on bringing anything new to the table on this case on
that issue?
A. No. It will still be the same historical method that I've done.
Q. And I'm going to apologize again. I will probably ask you that question repeatedly as we go through here, and then I'm going to ask you again at the end only because I don't like surprises and I just want to make sure you and I
44
have an understanding of what you're going to talk about, so bear with me.
Next sentence says, "This subject area generally includes the history of tobacco production and consumption, including cigarette consumption; public knowledge and perception overtime of the health risks of cigarette smoking and addiction to nicotine; cigarette advertising and disinformation and their impact overtime on public perception of cigarettes and smoking and addiction to nicotine. Cigarette smoking" --
Let me stop because this sentence goes on. Let me go through it a little bit closer. Regarding the history of tobacco production and consumption, including cigarette consumption, anything specific to the Hiott case apart from your general opinions on the matter?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
45
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. What do those include?
A. Well, we know, I know that where County Georgia is in the Georgia tobacco belt. It's a tobacco growing area.
And Ms. Beverly talks about working as a youth in the tobacco fields, which was a common activity in places like that. So, if asked I may, you know, present a picture of what the food trade tobacco growing areas were like in the 1950s and the 1960s.
Q. Let me back up. Beyond what you have just told me as far as the specific locale and the tobacco fields specific to that area, as far as your general opinions on tobacco production and consumption, fair to say you have testified on that issue previously?
A. I have. Yes, sir.
Q. Do you intend to offer anything different in this case than you have in your prior testimony?
MR. VINIK:
46
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
No.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Regarding public knowledge and perception overtime of the health risks of cigarette smoking, the same series of questions: Do you intend to render any opinions or proffer any testimony specific to Mr. Hiott on that issue?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
My discussion of that or my opinions on that will be similar to what I've done in previous testimony. I'll talk about the role of cigarettes in American life, the way people incorporated cigarettes into their daily existence. In this case the time period of his existence, '50s and '60s, '70s. And, you know, deal with those national issues and broad cultural issues.
Q. And you've testified on those issues repeatedly in trials; correct?
47
A. That's correct.
Q. In fact, I think it's fair to say that's the focal point of the bulk of your testimony in most cases; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Often that has been the case. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. You don't intend to offer
anything new or different in this trial as opposed to previous trials; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Yeah. My opinions have not changed on these issues. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. And we'll probably exhaust this when we get to your case specific.
But beyond, you don't have any opinion on these issues specifically regarding Mr.
Hiott other than where he fits in time, place of history?
A. Correct. Yes.
48
Q. You know what, let me see if I can shortcut this. We won't walk through each of the opinions. Maybe we should.
"Cigarette advertising and disinformation and their impact overtime on public perception on cigarettes and smoking and addiction to nicotine."
Do you intend to render any
opinions specific to Mr. Hiott regarding that issue?
A. Well, my answer is really the same to the previous discussion; that is,
I will just be locating Mr. Hiott in historical time and space. I will not be offering an opinion that applies only to Mr. Hiott as an individual separate from history.
Q. Okay. And I think just to make sure I understand the qualifier and to try to make sure we get it clearly on the record. What I'm interpreting you to say is that you are going to provide here's a historical context and it applies to Mr. Hiott to the extent that he is an individual living at this age, at this
49
time within that historical context?
A. That's correct.
Q. That is a pretty accurate description?
A. Yes.
Q. So, when we talk about opinions specific to Mr. Hiott, you
understand that what I'm asking is anything beyond that, beyond just claiming that Mr. Hiott was typical or existed at any point in time, okay?
A. Okay.
Q. "Cigarette smoking is a cultural phenomenon, including social smoking patterns, common knowledge, and uncertainty regarding smoking hazards, including addiction and the cigarette industry's role, including fostering and maintaining the same."
Would your answer be the same to the series of questions I'm asking, anything specific to Mr. Hiott?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
50
No. In the case of this phrase I may be asked at the trial did I learn about, for example, smoking at work. And I may be asked what were the broad policies of smoking on the job during this
time period, and is there anything in an example of that in the deposition testimony that I have reviewed. I will say yes. He smoked at work, you know, on the various jobs that he had. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. I think you're three pages ahead of me on my outline so we will go back to here. I want to focus specifically just for a moment on the "common knowledge" you have in quotes.
And correct me, fix it however I want, but when you refer to "common knowledge", are you talking about again broad, large scale, national, general common knowledge as you opine it to be at the time?
A. Yeah. The word is in quotes because it's a term of art. Actually not one that I particularly like to use. But
51
what it indicates is really the language that the defense uses, and that it's in there because that's a term that often comes up more among defense experts or
witnesses and the like. But my preferred language is public perception and public knowledge.
Q. And let me just because I don't want to quibble about any of the phraseology. I just want to make sure.
With regard to those opinions, are your opinions in this case focused on the broader, national context as compared to specifically Mr. Hiott's locale, city, community?
A. The broader, national context,
yes.
Q. Fair to say and I think we've talked to this, you haven't looked at specifically what the common knowledge or perception is within Mr. Hiott's particular community as compared to the larger national?
A. That's correct.
Q. Just to make sure I don't
52
forget. The opinions you intend to render on that subject apart from sort of maybe
some of the smoking at work or some of the facts specific, your general opinions will be duplicative of testimony you have given in previous cases and depositions?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Yes. It would be consistent,
yes.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. No surprises? Nothing new for this case?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
My opinions haven't changed about these issues.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. So, the last it looks like generic it also says, "And documents relating to all foregoing subject areas."
I guess the first question I have is: Do you have any specific
53
documents in mind when you refer to when
you make that statement?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
No.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. For example, I'm going to bet, whatever you want to bet, that you will introduce the Frank statement to the jury in this case? Fair enough?
A. Yeah. I will probably talk about that. I have in the past, yeah.
Q. And I think you have basically every time you testified; right?
A. No.
Q. Subject to court rulings?
A. I don't keep up on that aspect of it.
Q. Okay.
A. So, I wouldn't be able to say either way.
Q. And I don't want to get too far off topic. But fair to say the documents, and I think I went through this
with you, the exhibits you intend to use are in your Reliance; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. As of today, the documents you intend to use I think you will characterize are familiar to me and my client because you have used them in previous trials; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Again no surprises?
A. Well, I can't --1 don't intend to surprise anybody.
Q. That was a bad question.
A. Yeah.
Q. Let me -A. Surprise is your perception.
Not mine.
Q. You don't intend to introduce some new collection of documents or new substantive material into your trial testimony regarding these issues that you haven't used in the past; correct?
A. No. I don't intend to do that. This paragraph is a good outline of things that comprise my expertise and my
testimony.
Q. Okay. This is going to be sort of my big close out over the generic opinions. The last sentence talks about you -- there is a paragraph that talks about your opinions and the grounds for these opinions have been disclosed through dozens of expert reports, depositions, and other testimony in past tobacco litigation, including, purely by way of example, his deposition and/or trial testimony and then you list a number of cases.
And I think you would agree with me that this is intended to be a fair representation of the scope of your opinions in this case?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. You've been deposed and you've testified in the cases listed here?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. You have been deposed a number of times in the Engle Progeny Cases?
A. I have.
Q. Including the generic
deposition?
A. Yes. There was a generic deposition.
Q. A trial perpetuation deposition?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Yes. Although they called it a trial preservation.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. Preservation?
A. When I did it, yes.
Q. You are correct.
A. And, you know, as you are familiar, I have testified in the first of the Engle cases. And the case is escaping me at the moment, but any of those could be on this list as well.
Q. And this is just the opinions you intend to offer in this case don't differ from the opinions or the subject matters that you have covered in your
A. That's correct.
57
Q. You've been relatively consistent I think you would characterize it as from case to case as far as your generic opinions; correct?
A. Yes. The history hasn't changed.
Q. One thing I do want to ask before we move onto sort of the case specific opinions is admittedly the scope of your testimony encompasses a lot. Fair enough?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Well, it's a big subject and an important subject, yes.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. And within that big important subject, the history of tobacco for lack of a better term, there are subtopics that you have discussed in some cases and not so much in other cases; correct?
Q. For example, given a certain set of facts you've testified as to
58
advertising targeting racial groups; correct?
A. Yes. That's correct.
Q. You have no intention of testifying as to that subject matter in this case; correct?
A. Well, I think what you're referring to is a case in which the smoker was a rural African-American man who had smoked menthol cigarettes. I don't anticipate being asked questions about that.
Q. And really all I'm trying to do is, I think it's fair to say that you have testified on a great number of subjects over the course of the trials and depositions you have given, some of which are generally applicable.
I think in your opinion, the history doesn't change, some of which are
more targeted topics based on the facts of a particular case?
A. Well, I think I mean yes, but with this -- if I can take the liberty of kind of refining that. The story of the
59
cigarette in American life, it's one big story, that's true. And there are many parts to that story. And my expertise touches on some important parts of that story. Not all of them, but some very important parts.
Some cases I have been asked questions about certain aspects of the story and not others. And that typically has to do with, you know, time constraints and a lot of things that I don't really know about that have to do with the nature of the litigation which I don't keep up on and don't discuss.
Q. Well, let me ask this and maybe I can wrap this all to one thing.
You mentioned about the questions that you are asked or what questions you may or may not be asked at trial.
And it goes back to my question before that you understand, today is my opportunity to gather the opinions that you intend to render in this case; correct?
A. Yes.
60
Q. Are there any particular subjects that you as of today intend to testify about at trial?
MR. VINIK:
Are you finished with the question?
MR. HARRISON:
Yeah. I'm just trying to think.
MR. VINIK:
Sure.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. For example, do you intend to testify regarding filters in this case?
A. Well, I might. I mean, there is an interesting quit assist discussion in there with an added on filter.
And I may be asked questions
about the perception of filters and, you know, the role of filters in the cigarette market.
Winston, the brand smoked by the decedent was a filter cigarette. So, that may well be something that I'm asked about and would cover the way I just described it.
61
Q. I don't think there is a question I can ask that will help me narrow this down at all. Is it fair to say as of right now you haven't laid out what you intend specifically to testify about in this case?
A. No. I have not had that discussion with the attorneys.
Q. So, and maybe this is my way of doing it. Based on your experience both as an expert, your professional experience, and your experience as a witness in tobacco litigation, you feel comfortable testifying on a wide variety of subjects? Fair enough?
testifying on the subjects outlined on the witness disclosure.
Q. And I think you and I can both agree, as described in the expert witness disclosure, there is a lot of material within the parameters of these sentences; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection. Well --
62
THE WITNESS:
Well, it's a big subject, yes. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. And that's all, you know, it is a very large subject all of which you feel comfortable testifying about; correct?
A. Yes. As these items, yes.
Q. These items. And you can assume that I am limiting my questions at this point to the items disclosed in your expert disclosure boot strapped to any previous testimony you've given in the cases that falls within here? Fair
enough?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And I just want to be clear that, so while you're comfortable and you're equipped in your opinion to render opinions on any number of subjects and to provide a rather expansive understanding explanation of this history of tobacco and the tobacco industry, I'm correct so far; right?
A. The history of the tobacco
63
industry is something I have discussed in the past, yes.
Q. But as of today, you haven't determined specifically what aspects of the history of tobacco you will testify about at trial; correct?
A. Yes. I mean this may help. I have not sat down with the attorneys from Milberg. Mr. Vinik who I met this morning and had a half hour of breakfast, ate oatmeal, I have not gone over the questions or anything like that.
best you can tell me is that you will testify consistent with your expert disclosure and consistent with your prior testimony; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. You can't give me any further detail as to specifically what topics you intend to cover for this particular case because you haven't sat down and had the conversation yet; right?
A. That's correct.
Q. Let's go ahead and go off the
64
record and take a five minute break.
(RECESS WAS TAKEN) EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I think we have covered your generic opinions pretty exhaustively, but let's move to your case specific opinions. I think in the disclosure it says, "Dr. Kyriakoudes also may be called to discuss the historical issues discussed above as they relate to plaintiffs specific locales." I read
A. Yes.
Q. What does that mean?
A. Well, I kind of provided that earlier and I will restate what I said. I may be asked to describe what rural southeastern Georgia was like in the 1940s, '50s and this period leading up to the birth of Mr. Hiott and going through his youth.
And if asked to describe that,
I will give you an indication of that in it's a rural tobacco growing region where a county is part of the flue-cure Georgia,
65
flu-cure belt. You know, things like that.
Q. Do you have any opinions specific to Mr. Hiott?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. As opposed to Mr. Hiott the individual, as opposed to Mr. Hiott a person being in this particular locale at
this particular time?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
No, no. But just so that we're clear, you know, if asked if I learned anything about Mr. Hiott's smoking practices from the materials I reviewed, I will relate back to that.
And we talked about this a moment ago, the smoking at work, for example, the brands that he used or the brand that he used.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. And I think we're going to get
66
to some of that stuff and I will exhaust what you actually know about him. So, just we will move forward and I appreciate the caveat as far as the difference between the general opinions and the specific opinions.
Before we get to the opinions, you are familiar, you're generally asked
in a deposition a series of questions about you don't know this, you don't know that, you don't have any evidence of this.
I tried to put them all in a list and we can run through this as quickly as possible and then figure out what we have to cover more on the back end. Fair enough?
A. Sure.
Q. Okay. You're not aware of any evidence that Mr. Hiott ever heard of the Tobacco Institute or TI?
A. There is no indication in the materials I've reviewed.
Q. So the answer is no?
A. No.
Q. You're not aware of any
67
evidence that Mr. Hiott ever heard of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee or TIRC?
A. There is no evidence to that.
Q. So the answer is no?
A. No.
evidence in this case that Mr. Hiott ever heard of the Council for Tobacco Research or CTR?
A. No.
Q. You're not aware of any evidence in this case that Mr. Hiott had ever heard of or seen the Frank statement?
A. No.
Q. The Frank statement ran on January 4th, 1954; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Mr. Hiott would have been two years old at that time; correct?
A. Yeah. That's correct.
Q. You're not aware of any evidence Mr. Hiott ever heard or saw any statements regarding cigarette smoking made by any of the tobacco companies?
68
A. I can't say either way.
Q. So, the answer to my question is you're not aware of any evidence; correct?
Q. You're not aware of any evidence that Mr. Hiott ever saw or heard any particular cigarette advertisements?
A. Well, his wife mentions some advertising in her deposition, the Marlboro Man. She indicates that he did watch television so he would have seen advertisements, commercial broadcast, commercial advertisements.
Q. And that's an inference you are gleaning based on the fact that he watched TV and cigarette ads were on; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
That's correct.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. There is no -- there is no factual, there is no testimony or evidence
69
that Mr. Hiott saw any particular advertisement; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Well, his wife recalls the Marlboro Man. I mean, if he watched Gunsmoke he would have seen the ads on Gunsmoke. No. I mean, there is not a literal recounting of every cigarette ad that he would have been exposed to in the deposition.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. Right.
A. But by virtue of being alive during this time period and doing activities like watching television, driving on the highway, looking with his eyes open to see billboards and the like, he would have been exposed to these things.
Q. Let me see if I can flush this out just a little bit and then we can move on. You can't place Mr. Hiott in front of any particular ad at any particular time;
correct?
Q. Okay. You've testified on your general opinions about the extent of advertising. I think your deposition uses the word, your testimony uses the word "ubiquitous" about as much as I've ever seen. Fair enough?
A. Yes.
Q. And it's your opinion that given the extent of advertising, he had to have seen it?
A. That's correct.
Q. But you don't have any evidence specific to Mr. Hiott or from any of Mr. Hiott's, from Linda Beverly's deposition that Mr. Hiott saw any particular ad; correct?
A. I can't put him in front of a particular ad at a particular point in historical time.
Q. And you've been in cases where you've been able to do that; correct?
A. I have.
Q. But not here; correct?
71
A. I'm not sure if I recall doing
that. I mean, sometimes people do remember -- well, like in this case the Marlboro Man theme or, you know, other slogans they may have recollections of campaigns.
Q. Let me just deal with the Marlboro Man issue. First off, Mr. Hiott never smoked Marlboros; correct?
A. He seems to have been a Winston man.
Q. No evidence he ever smoked Marlboros; correct?
A. I did not see any evidence he smoked Marlboro.
Q. And the testimony regarding the Marlboro Man actually refers to children across the street or people across the street; correct, referring to Mr. Hiott as the Marlboro Man?
A. Yeah. There is a discussion.
I'm not recalling the actual level of detail that you're presenting.
Q. And maybe we'll go flush it out because I think if I'm correct, and
your counsel can correct me, and maybe we'll look through it if we get to the point, isn't that Mr. Hiott saw the ads for the Marlboro Man, but rather that the people across the street referred to him because he smoked and he was a handsome man as the Marlboro Man?
A. Yeah. That sounds about right.
Q. So, that's different than seeing an ad for Marlboro; correct?
A. Well, it's referencing the advertisements, an indicator of the power of the advertising and the culture.
Q. You're not aware of any evidence in this case that Mr. Hiott relied upon any cigarette advertising in deciding to smoke; correct?
A. No. I can't get into his brain as an individual.
Q. You cannot say that Mr. Hiott began smoking because of advertising for cigarettes?
A. Well, advertising plays a significant role in building the market
for cigarettes and enticing youth to smoke. That will be the content of my testimony.
Q. General principal of advertising market demands; correct?
A. As in history.
Q. In history, right. I'm going to spare you and I the time. You've been questioned about your expertise in marketing and lack thereof repeatedly; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Well, I'm an expert in the history of this.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. Let me see if I can do this moving forward. Back to my original question. You can't say that Mr. Hiott specifically began smoking because of advertising for cigarettes?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
All I can say is not him specifically. All I can say is that advertising at the time that Mr. Hiott began smoking played a terrifically important role in building the market, in recruiting new smokers and building the market for new smokers.
Q. You can't say that Mr. Hiott continued to smoke because of cigarette advertising?
A. Well, he as an individual distinct from broad patterns, no. But again, advertising played a role in persuading smokers that they should keep on smoking.
Q. You're referring there to smokers generally; correct?
A. Yes. The market for cigarettes. Yes.
Q. As opposed to Mr. Hiott specifically or individually?
A. Yes. That's correct.
Q. And you're not aware of any
evidence in this case that Mr. Hiott specifically was influenced by cigarette
75
advertisements?
A. Him as an individual distinct from the broader population, no.
Q. You're not aware of any evidence that Mr. Hiott ever tried a particular brand of cigarettes because of an advertisement?
A. Again, no. He seems to have been a Winston smoker. And that was a leading brand when he smoked it. It was on the cusp -- or no, it was the leading brand and he, like millions of others, young adults and teenagers I should say began smoking.
Q. And I don't want to flush this out because I think you've been questioned on it before. But Winston at some point does become a declining brand; correct?
A. Later, yeah.
Q. Mr. Hiott still continues to smoke Winstons?
brand. When you say declining, they lose market share to Marlboro but it's still the number two brand. Do you drive a
76
Chevy or do you drive a Ford, you know.
Q. You're not aware of any evidence that Mr. Hiott ever switched brands because of an ad?
A. No. He seems to have been a one brand smoker.
Q. And the same would be true that Mr. Hiott, that there is no evidence that Mr. Hiott ever switched brands because of any company statement?
A. Again, he seems to have not switched brands.
Q. Other than the fact that Mr.
Hiott smoked Winstons and Winstons were a leading brand, you're not going to offer an opinion as to why Mr. Hiott smoked a particular brand; are you?
A. Him as an individual?
Q. Yes.
A. No.
Q. And you're certainly not in a position to opine how Mr. Hiott would have interpreted any particular ad; correct?
A. He as an individual, no.
Q. You have not conducted a
77
survey of the cigarette advertising that was published or available in the specific areas where Mr. Hiott lived?
A. Like uniquely local advertising? Is that what you're talking about?
Q. Let's start there, yes. You haven't identified any uniquely local advertising; correct?
A. No, I haven't.
Q. Nor have you undertaken to discover the extent of advertising in Mr. Hiott's particular locale?
A. No. I mean, these products were nationally advertised. They were national campaigns so it's really a national story.
Q. And I think that's sufficient for my purposes. When you talk about
advertising at trial, you are going to talk on a national scale as opposed to anything specific to the locals where Mr. Hiott lived; correct?
A. Yes. That's correct.
Q. Moving right along. You're
78
not a historian of Mr. Hiott; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Nor are you his biographer; correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. You've never spoken with Mr. Hiott, the deceased Mr. Hiott, Ms. Hiott, Terrence Hiott, or any other family members?
A. That's correct.
Q. In fact, your opinions in this case are not affected by Mr. Hiott's individual circumstances; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Again, as I've said many times,
the history doesn't change. You know, the industry's actions don't change. They are what they are. And the extent that Mr. Hiott was a person who was located in this historical place, time, that's the extent of it from my purposes.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. Okay. None of the other
79
individual aspects of Mr. Hiott or his life are relevant to your opinions; correct?
A. I specifically locate him in, locate him in history.
Q. Okay. You don't know what Mr. Hiott knew or didn't know at any point in time; correct?
A. That's correct. I don't know.
I can't see into his mind.
Q. You have no opinion about what specific information Mr. Hiott may have read, heard, or seen about cigarette smoking?
A. Well, he may have read a lot of things, and we'll talk about the kinds
of information that was available. But again, I'm locating him in that time period and that's the extent of it.
Q. So, just to answer to my specific question, it's correct, you have no opinion about what specific information Mr. Hiott may have actually read, heard, or seen about cigarette smoking?
A. As distinct from anyone else,
80
that's correct. Yes.
Q. You have no opinion about what Mr. Hiott thought, believed or knew about cigarette smoking?
A. Again, that's correct. I'm not going to offer an opinion about him as an individual distinct from other groups of people.
Q. You have no opinion about what specific information from any sources Mr. Hiott relied upon at any time; correct?
A. You know, only to the extent that, you know, when he bought Winstons, he was doing what the R.J. Reynolds
Company wanted him to do and expected him to do and presented as a reasonable thing to do. That's the extent of it.
Q. That's not the same as saying that Mr. Hiott relied on anything that R.J. Reynolds did, said, produced; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Well, I mean, it's my opinion
81
that the function of advertising and marketing was to entice people to purchase and use the product. And to the extent that people displayed that behavior of purchasing and using the product, they were behaving as intended by the advertiser. And that in this case, R.J.
Reynolds Company. While I can't put an ad in front of Mr. Hiott at a particular point in time, I think the balance to a reasonable degree of historical certainty, the fact that he was using Winston, he was responding to the marketing efforts of the
Winston brand for R.J. Reynolds.
Q. If I'm following your logic, and I just want to lay it out so that I make sure I understand it so that I can deal with it appropriately. A; R.J. Reynolds advertises Winstons. B; Mr. Hiott smokes Winstons. Therefore, C; Mr. Hiott must have relied on R.J. Reynolds' advertisements for Winstons?
A. Advertisements and marketing efforts. Yes, to some degree. Yes.
Q. Well, you say to some degree.
82
Am I missing anything there?
A. No.
Q. Okay. So, your opinion, first off your statement that you believe Mr. Hiott relied on specific information is first and foremost an opinion as opposed to a statement of fact; correct?
A. Well, it's a historical judgment. Yeah, an opinion.
Q. Okay. It's not a fact. Mr.
Hiott never said, wow, I bought Winston
because I love that advertisement; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Right. That statement does not exist in the material overview. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. So, you're making an inference based on your understanding of the historical context of what was being advertised and what Mr. Hiott did; correct?
A. That's correct.
83
Q. Okay. But you don't have any evidence of an actual connection between the two; correct?
A. No. I can only go as far as I outlined in my previous answer.
Q. So, if I can, let's back up and then come back forward. You're going to likely testify at trial about the -well, first off, do you intend to testify at trial regarding cigarette advertising?
A. I do.
Q. Okay. Probably tend to show some advertisements to the jury?
A. I do.
Q. Have you picked those out by chance yet?
A. No. But I anticipate that I will show Winston commercials from the '60s. I would include that, print ads.
Q. Any brands besides Winstons?
A. I may show some other brands to give the jury a sense of the environment, the environment of advertising at the time. It's my opinion that cigarette advertising first and
84
foremost builds primary demand cigarettes and then builds brand demand.
So, other non-branded advertisements are relevant as a matter of historical context.
Q. So, for purpose of your opinion after discussing the extent of advertising, you're going to make an
assumption or an inference or render an opinion that given the advertising Mr. Hiott must have seen it?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Excuse me?
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. Mr. Hiott was likely to see
it?
A. I feel more comfortable with that characterization.
Q. So, you're drawing an inference based on the environment that Mr. Hiott would have seen some group or some set of advertising; correct?
A. That's correct.
85
Q. Okay. So, then you take that inference, coupled with the fact that Mr. Hiott smoked a particular brand, and you draw another inference that Mr. Hiott must have relied on those ads in choosing to smoke a particular brand?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Yeah. Yes. The answer is yes.
And just for clarification, you know, when I say yes, I mean that the advertising works; that is, it has influence. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. And I understand. I just want to break down how you get to your opinion. I think we have got it spelled out and that I accurately described how you reach your opinion; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And once again, just to go back to something I said because I think I got it but I want to make sure. There is no -- you have no evidence that Mr. Hiott relied upon any evidence information from
86
any source at any time; correct?
A. Well, when you say that, let me make sure that I understand what you are asking me. I think what you're really asking me is, I don't have statements from
the testimony that I have reviewed where somebody says, oh, yes. I relied on that advertisement and, therefore, went and made a specific behavior. That's true.
But that's not how advertising works as an historical phenomenon. It works to create an environment where use of the product is encouraged. And that's how I reached those opinions and that's how I will explain it to the jury.
Q. And this goes back to where we talked before. In that instance, you're sort of back to your generic opinion with the caveat that you will likely discuss specific to Winston and Mr. Hiott?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. I think that covers my list of what you're not going to talk about or what you don't know subject to all your answers. Let's sort of flip it a
87
little bit.
Tell me what you know about Mr. Hiott insofar as the information that you deem relevant for formulating your
opinions?
A. Sure. I will be happy to do that. He was bom in 1951 in Way cross, Georgia, southeastern mral Georgia. I refer to him as a city kid because his wife, first wife was from out in the country. But Waycross was hardly a city. And even today it's still very much a small town.
He goes up there. He meets his soon to be wife. As we talked earlier he was 17. She indicates that he stated he began smoking at the age of 14. So, he began smoking at essentially junior high school or middle school age or early high school age student, eighth, ninth grade type age.
He has a variety of occupations which he smokes on the job. He is a delivery person for Coca-Cola. He settles upon work for the Post Office. He
88
smoked Winston. He was a fan of racing to the extent that, you know, R.J. Reynolds
sponsored the Winston Cup. That's relevant.
Then he later contracted lung cancer and passed away. He, I might add, there is a description of him using a graded nicotine filter device like to being a quit attempt.
Q. Anything else that you know about Mr. Hiott that you consider relevant for your opinions?
A. In terms of his smoking history which is what my interest is, that's it.
Q. Do you know when Mr. Hiott contracted lung cancer?
A. I don't.
Q. Okay. Do you know when Mr. Hiott passed away?
A. He passed away in the mid
'90s.
Q. April of '96 sound about right?
A. Sounds about right.
89
Q. Do you have an understanding
of when Mr. Hiott moved out of Waycross?
A. After the break with his first wife. It's sometime after 1980, but '81,
'82, around that time.
Q. You mentioned that Linda Beverly met Mr. Hiott in 1968 when they were both 17 years old; correct?
A. That's right.
Q. Given that the only thing you have reviewed specific to this case is Ms. Beverly's deposition, you don't have any information regarding Mr. Hiott from a direct witness prior to 1968; correct?
A. That's correct. I mean, she states that she indicated that he began smoking at 14. That's not surprising. I mean, it all fits into the general understanding of youth smoking at that time period.
Q. And she says he began smoking at 14 after his father passed away; correct?
A. She does mention that, yes.
Q. Okay. Did you undertake to
find out or let me ask you this: What year would based on your review, what year do you have Mr. Hiott starting to smoke?
A. Well, three years prior to 1968 when they met at age 17. So, 1965.
Q. Okay. Or 1966; correct?
A. Around then, yes. The specific date is not absolutely essential.
Q. When you say the specific date isn't absolutely essential, does your opinion change one way or another whether Mr. Hiott was smoking in 1965, began smoking in 1965 or 1966?
A. No.
Q. Not one way or the other?
A. No. The fact that the caution which is what you're referring to, the caution label goes on in '66, it doesn't influence my opinion.
Q. Okay. Mr. Hiott's father passed away in 1966?
A. I seem to recall that. Yes.
Q. And if Mr. Hiott began smoking at 14 years old after his father died, he would have began smoking in 1966; correct?
A. Yes. That does provide a way to date it more precisely.
Q. You have expressed some familiarity with the town, the region that Mr. Hiott grew up. Given that you have done some research on the south, other than -- well, let me just ask the broad question: What about where Mr. Hiott grew up do you consider relevant to your opinions?
A. Well, it's a tobacco growing region which meant that people, many people earn their living from the future of tobacco.
Q. Have you done any type of analysis about whether people who live in tobacco growing regions are more likely to smoke than those that don't live in tobacco growing regions?
A. Well, there has been some research on that. For example, there was -- there has been research on the opinions of physicians in North Carolina compared to national physicians.
And it's interestingly enough
and not surprisingly, that's the leading tobacco growing state. That's why I mention North Carolina. Physicians in that state were much less likely to accept the proposition that cigarettes were a health hazard, and specifically a cause of cancer in the 1950s and the 1960s.
Q. Have you undertaken, though, a study as to whether people who live in tobacco growing regions are more likely to smoke than those who live outside of tobacco growing regions?
A. Well, there is -- yes. Yeah. Basically, yeah.
Q. And what opinions have you come to on that issue?
A. Well, if you look, for example, the 1950s, the southerners because of their poverty, rural farm dwelling southerners, particularly African-Americans largely because of their poverty, lack of cash and lack of access to outlets to market cigarettes tended to
And so there is by the '60s
93
actually vergence, but there are some interesting variations in that period.
Town dwelling whites, pretty much on par with national averages.
Q. I think we already talked about this. Have you researched any local newspapers wherein Mr. Hiott lived throughout his life?
A. I have not.
Q. Are you aware if Mr. Hiott ever worked for a newspaper?
A. If he did, I didn't discover
that.
Q. You don't know one way or the other?
A. I don't know.
Q. Do you have any understanding whether Mr. Hiott ever read the paper?
A. From what I looked at, it's difficult to make a judgment on that.
I'm going to take a pit stop.
(RECESS WAS TAKEN) EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
94
Q. Back to my last question, Dr. Kyriakoudes. Do you have an understanding sitting here today whether Mr. Hiott read the newspaper?
A. I don't either way.
Q. It wasn't information that you undertook to discover?
A. The deposition I reviewed, if it came up I missed it. It wasn't that important to me.
Q. And that's what I wanted.
That's all I was getting at, whether or not Mr. Hiott read particular newspapers at particular periods of time. In your opinion, it isn't relevant to your opinions or analysis?
A. That's correct.
Q. I think you testified, but I want to make sure you understand that newspapers are a source of information on
smoking and health?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you intend to show any newspaper ads or newspapers during trial?
A. I may, yes.
95
Q. Okay. Do you have in mind any newspapers that you're likely to show at trial?
A. I may to give the jury a sense of the natural coverage of the issue of smoking health. I may show a New York Times story or two.
Q. Okay. And you're going to do that without any understanding of whether Mr. Hiott ever read or saw those newspapers or any other newspapers; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Did you ask anybody if Mr.
Hiott ever read any newspapers?
A. No.
Q. What about magazines? Have you reviewed any magazines specifically for this case?
A. No. I've reviewed many magazines, but nonspecifically for this case.
Q. Do you intend to show any magazines during the trial?
A. I may, yes.
96
Q. Okay. Sitting here today do you have any likely candidates?
A. Life Magazine, Reader's Digest in the '50s and '60s.
Q. Generally consisting of what you've done in the past?
A. Correct.
Q. Do you have any understanding whether Mr. Hiott read any particular magazines at any particular time?
A. I don't.
Q. Okay. You don't know one way or the other?
A. I don't know one way or the other.
Q. Similar to the newspapers, you didn't think you needed that information
to render your opinions?
A. It doesn't affect any opinion. That's correct.
Q. Because your opinions refer to the general population and the general information environment, so to speak, as opposed to what Mr. Hiott actually did?
A. Well, I mean, I talk about the
97
kinds of information that were part of the smoking and health debate, for example, in this case or in this situation to be more precise or in this example. And, you know, that coverage has many facets; press coverage, television coverage, so it's --Q. I think you've testified that magazines are also an important source of information on this issue; correct?
A. Sure. Yes.
Q. And yet you didn't undertake to discover whether Mr. Hiott read or didn't read any particular magazines?
A. I have reviewed the National Magazine Press extensively. That's sufficient.
Q. Do you have an understanding from your review of the materials that you have reviewed regarding whether Mr. Hiott was someone who kept abreast of current events?
A. I have no opinion on that at all about that personal characteristic.
Q. Does whether Mr. Hiott kept abreast of current events matter to your
98
opinion one way or the other?
A. No.
Q. Do you have an understanding from your review as to whether Mr. Hiott watched any television news programs?
A. I don't know either way. I mean, the television news is an important source of information. I will discuss it, but, you know, as an example of the kinds of information about smoking and health and those issues that were circulating at points in time in history.
Q. And specifically to Mr. Hiott, you didn't undertake and find out whether
he did or he didn't watch any particular news programs; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Moving away from just news programs. What's your understanding of what Mr. Hiott's sort of TV history or TV viewing habits was?
A. Well, he had a TV in the home. He would watch it as indicated. He would watch TV.
Q. When you say --1 just want to
99
try to put some -- when you say Mr. Hiott had a TV in the home, do you have any understanding of when Mr. Hiott's family got their first television?
A. No. I mean, his first wife she says they would watch it and there was one when she was there and they would watch TV together.
Q. So, you recall that Linda Beverly, Mr. Hiott's first wife, testified that the two of them watched TV together; correct?
A. In his parents' home.
Q. In his parents' home. And then continued to do so while they were married; correct?
A. Well, to the extent that they lived in the parents' home shortly after they were married for a period of time.
Is that what you're referring to?
Q. I'm referring to even after they moved out of the parents' home, they continued to watch TV together; correct?
A. Oh, yes. I misunderstood your question. Yes.
100
Q. Basically throughout their relationship, Mr. Hiott and Ms. Beverly watched television together?
A. That is the vast preponderance of the American population at that time.
Q. And you saw that Ms. Beverly testified that they would often watch the news together?
A. I imagine. I'm not recalling that exact language, but that seems reasonable.
Q. Including local and national
news?
A. That would be the news.
Q. Okay. Does whether Mr. Hiott and Ms. Beverly watched TV affect your opinion one way or the other?
A. Only to the extent that there was a television and they looked at it.
Q. Your opinions would be the same whether they had a television or not; correct?
A. Well, I mean people consume TV in a lot of ways. Now, television ownership goes over 90 percent by 1960s.
101
So, the vast preponderance of homes have TVs at this time.
But people also consumed television in public places, shops, and stores. So, even if one doesn't have a television they have access to the TV.
And then the other is something that I have testified to many times in the past but is relevant here, this information is part of the culture and people directly
see it.
But then it's also part of a conversation that people talk about and it is amplified and is reflected and reverberates. So, it has what you might call secondary effects.
Q. And your testimony on the secondary effects and what you have just described to me you have testified previously about; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And to the extent that you plan to testify about it again, it would be consistent with what you have said before?
102
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. Specifically on television, you mentioned Mr. Hiott liked racing, the Winston Cup and he smoked Winstons. Do you have evidence he ever watched the Winston Cup?
A. Well, there is reference going to Daytona for the races.
Q. Okay.
A. That would be a Winston Cup race after they renamed it from the Grand Nationals in '71.
Q. So, it took on the name Winston Cup in what year?
A. Well, I think they signed the agreements in '71. So, I think it's '71.
I would have to double check to see if they rolled out the name either that year or the next year.
Q. After Mr. Hiott had already started smoking Winstons?
A. Yes. Yeah. That's true.
Yeah.
Q. You mentioned briefly about Mr. Hiott's occupations. Coke delivery
103
driver and eventually worked at the Post Office which was his long-term career I think we covered. Fair enough?
A. Yes.
Q. And I think each time you mentioned his smoking, his occupational history, you mentioned that he smoked on
the job.
A. Uh-huh (affirmative response).
Q. It's your understanding that Mr. Hiott smoked on the job?
A. That's described in the deposition, yes. So, that is my understanding.
Q. Are you aware of whether the Post Office ever instituted a smoking ban?
A. I would have to double check on that. That's a good question. And I'm not exactly recollecting the details on that.
Q. Fair to say you don't know one way or another?
A. Right now that's a fact that I need to reacquaint myself with.
Q. Okay. A smoking ban at an
104
employer would be a pretty big deal, wouldn't it, to a smoker?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
I don't know what you mean by "big deal". I mean, what we do know about the changing rules related to cigarette use indoors is that in the 1980s in most places there was a trend towards, particularly the late 1980s, there was a trend towards first defining certain areas for smokers indoors and then requiring smokers to go outside to use the product.
It's a big deal to use your language into the extent that smokers at work have to make an accommodation. They have to take a smoking break, but you know people kind of self-organize little smoking areas, on a back loading dock, by the front door under the awning.
I think beginning in the late '80s and into the '90s it was a cultural phenomenon. But the specific policies of the Post Office, I need to discover that.
105
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Fair enough. The smoking ban, generally speaking, were driven for health concerns; correct?
A. Yes. The understanding that secondary or secondhand smoke, environmental tobacco smoke was dangerous.
Q. Don't smoke inside because smoking is bad for you and those around you; right?
A. Yes.
Q. Smoking ban at work is not something that would go unnoticed by a smoker?
A. No. As I said earlier, they would have to make an accommodation.
Q. And you didn't look in this case whether there was ever a smoking ban instituted at the Post Office or any of Mr. Hiott's other jobs?
A. Well, there is no description of when he worked for the Coca-Cola Company driving a truck. The evidence is clear he smoked unencumbered by any rules. That's maybe the best way to put it.
106
He smoked at work at the Post Office according to evidence in this case.
There may have been later in the '80s a smoking ban. If I discover that and if it's relevant to my opinions, I will inform counsel and you can come back and ask me again on that or you can call me on the phone and do a phone follow-up.
Q. Just as a general question, as far as what you intend to do at trial, given that the information you sought out on Mr. Hiott is to place him in time and place within history, do you intend to use any particular range of documents, materials as it relates to time periods?
If that makes sense to you, please, answer it. I can fix it on the back end.
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
That makes sense to me. Sure.
Again, I haven't discussed the other's testimony, but I think it would be a reasonable subject area for me to be asked questions on the historical origin of the
107
cigarette in the Twentieth Century and the
Taking the story up to when Mr.
Hiott was born, in the sense that he was bom into a world with values and practices and culture and cultural values and the like. So, you know, what was the conduct of the R.J. Reynolds Company, for example. What was their business model historically and how did they advertise their products in the '30s and '40s. You know, what was -- what were they doing.
Sort of take that, what happened in the 1950s, how did the smoking and health debate unfold as a matter of historical development. I may talk about that.
How did the public react following that story. What were the major regulatory milestones on the smoking health debate. We've already mentioned the caution labels being implemented in
1966	and those warning regimes changed.
So, start before his birth and pick the story up, you know, to the '80s
and even the '90s.
Q. Okay. Do you have in your mind sort of a cut off date for the end of the story that you intend to tell?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Well, I mean, there is two. I mean there is two things I'm talking about. You know, there is Mr. Hiott to the degree that we have spent quite a bit of time discussing the extent of that.
But then there is the conduct of your client. And to that part of the story it might be relevant for me to take the story up into the '90s and to tell those and perhaps even to tell some of the story after Mr. Hiott's passing in 1996. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. Okay. Let's go back to my original question. I think the answer is you don't intend to put any time limits on the materials that you intend to use or likely use at trial?
given you an example. I have outlined and given you an example of that.
Q. You would acknowledge that any conduct, any materials, anything that happened after Mr. Hiott passed away had no effect on Mr. Hiott?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. The same would be true from the period when Mr. Hiott quit smoking for good; correct?
A. Yeah. In terms of effect on Mr. Hiott. I'm not going to talk about medical situations.
Q. I mean, apart from medical.
When Mr. Hiott lays down his last cigarette, nothing that R.J. Reynolds does after that affects Mr. Hiott in anyway, shape or form; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
I don't know. That's an interesting question. And this is a question that leads me into an area that I have not considered and don't really have
an opinion.
I can think of a number of different responses, but in terms of the effect of it on Mr. Hiott himself, I don't plan to give testimony in that area. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Okay.
A. But since you have posed the question, you know, we know from personal narratives of smokers that -- let me rephrase that.
We know from personal narratives of ex-smokers that they often think about smoking everyday even if they don't do it. So, I mean, but I think the crux of the matter is I don't intend to get into that area.
Q. Okay. Let me narrow the question because the question I asked I think was a little broad.
A. Okay.
Q. Let me do it a little more specifically. Nothing R.J. Reynolds or
any tobacco company does after Mr. Hiott puts down his last cigarette influenced
111
Mr. Hiott to smoke?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Correct, because he never smoked again?
A. Well, I mean yes. I don't mean to be drawing too fine a distinction. Yes. But with the explanation that from a hypothetical standpoint, it's perfectly possible that that period of not smoking is an incredible struggle.
And with the product being marketed and being distributed widely and essentially creating lots of temptation, that could be a form of suffering.
Q. Which let me interrupt you.
And I know you're not a lawyer. You know it is not recoverable in this case; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
I'm not a lawyer so I don't know either way. But again, I'm not intending
112
to testify on that subject.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Okay. Let's go back, back in time now. We got off track a little bit.
Do you have an understanding of Mr.
Hiott's educational background?
A. High school.
Q. He went to Waycross High School; correct?
A. That's right.
Q. And that was the city high school in Georgia?
A. Yes. City in quotes.
Q. The city according to Ms.
Beverly who went to the county high school; correct?
A. Yes. A county.
Q. And you've testified previously that schools are and have been an important source of smoking and health;
A. Yes. In ways. In lots of ways, yes.
Q. Now, I think you have addressed this before so I'm going to try
113
to cut to the chase. But you've testified that the health risks of cigarette smoking has been taught in schools for many decades?
A. In some schools, but that's -there is a story there which is, you know, up through well into the 1950s and even the early '60s much of what was taught about smoking and health really underestimated or misidentified the risk and the harm.
And I have often shown the curriculum standards published by the American Medical Association and National Education Association where they state, and I'm paraphrasing from memory, be careful not to exaggerate the risks of smoking because people see many people smoking, including doctors smoke without
evident harm.
And keep in mind, too, that what may be listed in a textbook, and as you get into the '60s the textbooks do begin to reflect the state of science at that time more effectively. Practice and
114
action and behavior, smoking sections in schools, for example, particularly in high schools. People in high schools that that, too, is a form of information.
Q. Good.
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Back to my question.
The health risks of cigarette smoking have been taught in schools for many decades?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
I answered the question. The way you put that question together is essentially unanswerable because what is taught about cigarettes over the period of time of decades changes.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Okay.
A. So, the way you pose that question, I can't answer it.
Q. Fair enough. Fair enough.
Have you researched any textbooks that were approved for use in Waycross, Georgia during the time that Mr. Hiott was
115
attending school?
A. I've looked at many, many textbooks and curriculum standards, but I have not made the connection to what was actually used in that school and whether or not he even took health.
Q. But you would agree that textbooks are a reliable source of historical information about what's being taught at schools in any period of time; correct?
A. Well, they are a curriculum material, a historical curriculum material.
Q. I want to talk about some textbooks that you have used, that were
approved for use in Georgia during various periods of time.
MR. VINIK:
Are you representing to the witness that's what you were going to show him was used in Georgia or is there something that you are going to ask him? MR. HARRISON:
I think we're going to walk
116
through and do it however we have to do to get where we are going.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Let me just ask you even before we get to the textbooks. Overtime textbooks talk about health risks of smoking in various forms to various degrees. Fair enough? I'm just trying to gloss over the subjects of the health aspects of smoking as they relate to textbooks.
A. It comes up in books, yes.
Q. You are aware that textbooks have also warned students to be skeptical
A. Some textbooks have done that.
Q. Okay. And you're aware that textbooks have warned students that cigarette advertising may be misleading?
A. Sure.
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
That's possible. Yeah. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
117
Q. Well, it's not just possible.
You understand from a historical account that textbooks have, in fact, warned students of that very fact?
A. I seem to recall that. I'm not recalling a specific textbook, but it sounds reasonable.
Q. You wouldn't have any basis to disagree with that proposition?
A. No. There might be a textbook that does that. If I was writing one, I would certainly include that.
Q. And I think when you mentioned
before you look at curriculum guides and things of that nature to try to identify various textbooks that may be used at a period of time or were in production at a period time; correct?
A. Or principals for teaching now.
Q. Let me hand you what is marked as Exhibit 6. Dr. Kyriakoudes, does Exhibit 6 look like a Georgia textbook list for elementary and high school students in 1942 published by the
118
Department of Education Textbook Division?
A. That's what it looks like.
Q. And as a historian, you're familiar with documents like this?
A. Uh-huh (affirmative response).
I am.
Q. These are the kind of documents you look to see what books are approved for use in a particular area; correct?
Q. And in this case, we're talking about Georgia where Mr. Hiott lived; correct?
A. Yes. That's correct.
Q. If you turn to the last page of Exhibit 6, the right-hand column, the bottom book you see Winston, John C., Making Life Healthful?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And that book is approved for secondary education in 1942; correct?
A. That's right.
Q. Okay.
119
A. According to this document.
Q. And you have no reason -- this is the kind of document you would look to as a historian if you were going to try to find out what textbooks were in use; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You would view this as a reliable source of that information?
Q. I'm going to hand you what's marked as Exhibit 7. Exhibit 7 appears to be the actual copy of the textbook, Making Life Healthful; correct?
A. Uh-huh (affirmative response).
Q. The same book identified in the Georgia textbook list from 1942; correct?
A. Correct. Uh-huh (affirmative response). Yes, I'm sorry. I mean to say yes instead of --
Q. If you could turn to page 247?
A. Just give me a second here. I am just skipping through the whole chapter if I may.
120
Q. Take your time.
A. Okay.
Q. If you could turn to page 247 on the heading "Other Reasons for Not Smoking"?
A. Uh-huh (affirmative response).
Yes.
Q. The textbook says, "On all
sides, advertisements for cigarettes clamor for your attention. Some cigarettes are claimed to be mild, others milder yet. Others cannot make you cough." Did I read that correctly?
A. Yes.
Q. That's relatively consistent with opinions you render in this case; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Or you intend to render in this case. The next sentence says, "When you read these advertisements, remember for the sake of your own health, that the people who write them are merely trying to sell cigarettes and have no interest whatsoever in your health."
121
Did I read that correctly?
A. Yes, you did.
Q. This is a textbook from 1942 warning students, excuse me, let me back up. This is a textbook approved for use in 1942 in Georgia warning students to be cautious of cigarette advertisements;
A. That's correct. I think that's a pretty accurate statement.
Q. Okay.
A. And it's a pretty accurate statement of the motives of the tobacco industry.
Q. And what this textbook is doing is telling students beware of the tobacco companies and their advertisements; correct?
A. That's right. You have identified, and you have identified approximately three sentences on page 247 in one book that a student at the best may have had access at best to for one year at school.
And I accept what this book
122
says, but keep in mind you have to put that in context.
Q. Understood, Doctor. My only question is, you see I got a little stack here. My only questions are whether or
not this textbook existed for approved for use in Georgia in 1942, nine years before he was bom and was telling students, beware of cigarette advertisement?
A. Yes.
Q. It also goes on to say, "The people who are really interested in your health are the doctors who have studied tobacco to see just what damage it does or does not do."
Did I read that correctly?
A. Yes.
Q. So, this textbook approved for use in 1942 is telling students, listen to the doctors, not the tobacco companies; correct?
A. Well, they're identifying who is actually interested in your health.
Yes. That's true. They don't say, listen to the doctors. They say -- they don't
123
use that language, but I guess that's the meaning.
Q. Okay. I just wanted to make sure. That's not what it says, but that's
certainly the driving force behind those statements; correct?
A. Yes. Of course.
Q. I'm going to hand you Exhibit 8. Dr. Kyriakoudes, does Exhibit 8 appear to be the Georgia Textbook List, Mathematics, Science, Health for elementary and high schools 1952 to 1957 Published by the Department of Education, Textbook Division?
A. Yes.
Q. Similar to the previous textbook list we looked at. You view this as an authoritative reliable source of textbooks that were approved for use in Georgia between 1952 and 1957?
A. Yes.
Q. I think I may have given you the highlighted copy. It's your copy back. You see where I'm going. Page 2 at the right-hand column under Lyons &
124
Carnahan, there is a book, Health and Human Welfare, copyright date of 1944.
A. I'm sorry.
MR. VINIK:
Could you point to that?
MR. HARRISON:
The second book down under Lyons & Carnahan on the second page, Health and Human Welfare.
THE WITNESS:
Uh-huh (affirmative response). EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. And that indicates that the Health and Human Welfare Book was approved for use in Georgia high schools between 1952 and 1957; correct?
A. Yes. I have used The Healthful Living in my own testimony which is just two notches below that on the list.
Q. So, again you review this as a reliable authoritative source to uncover what books were used; right?
A. Might have been used, yes.
125
hand you Exhibit 9. Dr. Kyriakoudes, is Exhibit 9 the Health and Human Welfare textbook identified on the Georgia textbook list that we just looked at?
A. Let me just take a minute and I'll look. Yes. You had asked me? I'm sorry. I didn't answer your question, but yes. This is that book.
Q. Doctor, if you could turn to page 496?
A. Okay.
Q. And do you see on the left-hand column there is actually a topic heading called Misleading Advertising; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And it identifies that, "Tobacco companies have taken to many avenues of appeal to increase the sale of their tobacco products, and their profits." Right?
A. That is correct.
Q. And then the book goes through a series of particular advertisements that
purportedly were in use at the time; right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And so we don't read through this whole paragraph, the take away is beware of the advertising. Think through what is actually being advertised; correct?
A. Yes.
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Well, as they say, it is misleading.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. So once again in Georgia in between 1952 and 1957, Georgia textbooks for high school are telling students beware of tobacco advertising?
A. Again, yes. On page 496 of this one book there are three paragraphs, four paragraphs.
Q. We have now looked at two books; right?
A. Uh-huh (affirmative response).
Ill
Q. And you would agree with me that these books are reflective of textbooks at the time; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
These are two books that discuss advertising. Not every health textbook will do that. For example, the next book on the list deals, the Textbook of Healthful Living 1947 I don't recall having that. So, some do. Some don't. These certainly do.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. These certainly do?
A. Yes.
Q. And these were the textbooks in use or approved for use for Mr. Hiott in the State of Georgia?
A. In the State of Georgia.
Q. Which would include Waycross, Georgia; correct?
A. Yes. This is one for the junior and high school. It's one of a number. It's one of a set of options that
people can chose from.
Q. Fair enough. So, we can agree that there were at least since 1942 and then certainly through 1957 textbooks approved for Mr. Hiott's high school that warn students to beware of tobacco advertising; correct?
A. Yes. These are also indicative of public health committee attempts to warn people about the fraud of cigarette advertising.
Q. I understand. And to go back to my last or my previous question. The two books that we've looked at so far, you understand from an historical prospective aren't the only two books from those periods that address, that warn students to beware of tobacco advertising; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
I would have to look at all of these other books to make a determination
because not all of them are familiar to me. The one that is doesn't, but that's
129
just one. I would have to look at that to give you an answer. But I have no problem with the statements that are made in these books. I think they are accurate. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Okay. Let's move forward in time. This is Exhibit 10. Dr.
Kyriakoudes, is Exhibit 10 the Georgia textbook list from 1967 for elementary and high schools?
A. Yes.
Q. Once again, you would view this as a reliable authoritative source to identify textbooks that are approved for use in Georgia during this period of time; correct?
A. Yes. That's correct.
Q. Go to the third page under Health Science, (B) Health.
A. Yes.
Q. Under the Bauer, Baruch there is a book titled Growing and Changing from
1962 approved for seventh graders; correct? Let me --1 will make it easier.
A. Oh, it's on the right-hand
130
side, okay. This one is a little -- yes.
Q. I will hand you Exhibit 11. Doctor, does Exhibit 11 appear to be the Growing and Changing textbook identified on the Georgia textbook list from 1967 that we just looked at?
A. Yes.
Q. If you could turn to page 181, please?
A. Just give me a second. Okay.
Q. Okay. Doctor, let me just direct you to page 181, but let's back up to page 179 just to orient where we are in the book. This is the smoking chapter; correct?
A. Yeah. It actually begins on page 177.
Q. Excuse me, 177. And if you look at page 179 briefly, and I don't want to spend too much time on this because I
think you've testified on this subject repeatedly.
This is now 1967. Certainly it is common practice for textbooks to warn of the health risks of smoking;
131
correct?
A. Yes. By the late '60s, very much so.
Q. And specifically, this textbook if you look on the top right-hand comer, "Men who stop smoking, according to studies, have a lower cancer death rate than those who do not stop." Correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. And this is a textbook that was approved for use in Mr. Hiott's schools in 1967; correct?
A. That's correct. According to that list.
Q. If you turn now to page 181 and we look at Things You Can Do?
A. Yes.
Q. Under paragraph 2 it says,
"Watch for advertisements about alcoholic
beverages and tobacco. Study these advertisements to see what reasons they suggest for using these substances.
Notice, too, what important information about the use of these products is not mentioned." Correct?
132
A. That's correct.
Q. And here we have yet another example of a textbook in Mr. Hiott's school warning students beware of tobacco advertising; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Well, they certainly are identifying again just as the previous book the deceptive nature and the enticing nature of tobacco advertising. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. And what they're doing is telling people, and not people, they're telling students, youth, beware of the advertisements; correct?
Q. So, this is the third example from books approved for use in Mr. Hiott's school district that reflect that exact same principal; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And now by 1967 I think you
133
would agree with me that this is now a common practice among school textbooks?
A. Yes. By the late '50s, the new textbooks coming out have removed any equivocation on the issue of tobacco.
Q. I got one more book and then I will be done with this topic. But first if you could turn back to exhibit, the
1967	textbook list.
And if you look on the front page under the Allyn and Bacon, Inc.,
Health and Fitness for Modem Living.
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And this is a 1961 textbook approved for use in Georgia high schools in 1967; right?
Q. Just so we can orient ourselves where we are in time, place and history, Mr. Hiott is in a Georgia high school in 1967; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. So, this book that we're about to look at was approved specifically for Mr. Hiott's class?
134
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Well, you can't say that. We don't know what class he took. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. Okay. Let me -A. And we don't know if that was the book chosen, but you can say that it was on the list of possible books that may have been used.
Q. Okay. It was on the approved textbook list for Mr. Hiott's high school? MR. VINIK:
Objection.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. At the period when he was in high school?
A. Yes. It's one of a number of books that may or may not have been used.
Q. So, we have some reason to believe that this textbook may have actually been used at the time when Mr. Hiott was at the school?
MR. VINIK:
135
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
It's possible.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Okay. And that's fair enough.
I'm going to hand you Exhibit 12. Dr. Kyriakoudes, this is Exhibit 12, the Health and Fitness For Modem Living textbook identified on the Georgia textbook list for 1967.
A. It looks like it to me.
Q. Doctor, if you could turn to page 249 under Tobacco? Are you there?
Do you see the paragraph that starts, "Although many factors contributed to the popularity of cigarettes."
A. Yeah. Yes. I see that.
Q. I will just put it out there because I know we're going to go there. You agree with the statement in this book that says, "Although many factors have contributed to the popularity of cigarettes, none has been more popular than advertising"?
A. Yes.
136
Q. And it talks about how smoking, to make smoking appear attractive, advertisements, picture it as a sophisticated and adult activity, popularity and whatnot; correct?
A. Yes. It may be linked to popularity, especially with the opposite sex.
Q. And these are things that I'm guessing you're likely to testify to at trial; correct?
A. That's true. And I agree with the opinion expressed in this book.
Q. And then the book goes on to say, "But when we stop to think seriously of the advantages in smoking, most of us realize that there are few, if any."
Correct?
A. That's right.
Q. So, once again here's a textbook warning students in Mr. Hiott's high school at the time Mr. Hiott is there to beware of cigarette advertising?
A. Yes. That's correct.
Q. This textbook from 1967
137
approved for use in high school, Health and Fitness For Modem Living is reflective of the larger group of textbooks used throughout the country; is that correct?
A. Especially by this time, yes.
I mean, I think most people in public health by this period understood that the tobacco industry was a victor of infection, a victor of disease.
Q. And more importantly, Doctor, they're telling students that; correct?
A. They are trying through this book, yes. Trying to get the message out. Lots of people were by this point trying to get the message out.
Q. Understood. Because 1967,
1966 is different in time than 1946 or 1956; correct?
A. That's true.
Q. And part of your testimony and the basis of your opinions is fundamentally predicated upon what time period an individual grew up in; correct?
A. Change overtime, yes.
138
Q. If you were testifying in a case of somebody born in 1980 and the effect and the influences that tobacco advertising or tobacco conduct might have on them, my guess is that would be a different opinion than somebody who started smoking in 1920?
Q. Can we take a five minute break?
(RECESS WAS TAKEN) EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, the discussion we just had about what was contained in the high school or the textbooks, Mr. Hiott's locale and elsewhere concerns a topic generally referred to as "source credibility"; correct?
A. Well, it's a source.
Q. Well, let me do this. Are you familiar with the term "source credibility" ?
A. That's a term of art that I learned from defense lawyers in the
139
tobacco litigation.
Q. Fair enough. You understand that it means that people view some sources as more reliable than others; correct?
MR. VINIK:
THE WITNESS:
Well, sources are sources. I mean, when you're looking at history, all sources are different. You evaluate them on their own merits.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Okay. Let's walk through some of them then. Let's reflect. I'm going to hand you Exhibit 13. Doctor, Exhibit 13 is a Reader's Digest from June of 1962; is it not?
A. Yes.
Q. You are very familiar with this document?
A. Yes.
Q. A reliable authoritative source reflecting a history of a period?
A. Yes. It's a source reflecting
140
the debate over smoking and health and this would be a case from Reader's Digest and Louis Mattox Miller was one of the most prominent journalists covering this beat.
Q. Let's turn to page 46 if you would. On the left-hand side the first full paragraph talks about a report about smoking and health. And you see there it starts, "The tobacco industry spokesmen issued the standard rejoinder that the evidence was merely "old data without new research findings." End quote.
MR. VINIK:
I'm not seeing where you are.
Where are you?
THE WITNESS:
Yeah. I see it.
MR. VINIK:
I got it.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Let me just go back so we can clean this up. Reader's Digest page 46, 1962. "Tobacco-industry spokesmen issued the same standard rejoinder that the
141
evidence was merely "old data without new research findings," but the statement sounded more weaker and pathetic than ever" ? Did I read that correctly?
Q. So, this is Reader's Digest saying that the position taken by the tobacco industry in 1962 sounded weak and pathetic; correct?
A. That was Ms. Miller's opinion and she was -- yes. That's what she wrote.
Q. So, that was 1962. Doctor, what I would like to do now is you know that beliefs and changes can evolve overtime; correct?
A. Well, beliefs can evolved and change overtime.
Q. And let me see if I can try to lay the foundation for all of this at once. And if you have any quibble with any part of this, let me know and we can do it the long way.
You rely on a number of polls in formulating your opinions; correct?
142
A. Yes. I have looked at a wide variety of polling and survey data, yes.
Q. And you consider them authoritative and reliable sources; correct?
A. Well, again polls are polls.
I mean, they are historical sources, yes.
Q. Okay. And specifically, you've looked at various Roper Polls that have been conducted overtime; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. They're part of your Reliance materials; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You consider them authoritative and reliable?
A. They are what they are, yeah.
They are historical evidence.
Q. Certainly reliable enough for you to consider in formulating your opinions; right?
A. Yes.
Q. I'm going to hand you Exhibit 14. Doctor, does Exhibit 14 appear to be an excerpt from a Roper Poll from January
143
of 1959 regarding a Study of Attitudes
Toward Cigarette Smoking and Different Types of Cigarettes?
A. Yes.
Q. And the question is posed:
"Who would you be most apt to believe if one of these organizations said there was no connection whatsoever between lung cancer and cigarette smoking? Which one would you be least likely to believe?
(Card shown respondent)." Correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And then we see the results.
And at the very top of the list, the most likely is the American Cancer Society at 39 percent; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you get down there, the Tobacco Industry Research Council, the TIRC is at three percent; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. So, 13 times more -people are 13 times more likely to believe the American Cancer Society than the TIRC regarding the question of whether there is
a connection between lung cancer and cigarette smoke; correct?
A. Yes. That's what that poll indicates.
Q. And if we look at the least likely to believe, we see the tobacco industry is far and away the least likely to be believed at 57 percent; correct?
A. That's correct. You read it perfectly.
Q. Which means that in 1959 according to this poll over half of the people would be least likely to believe the TIRC; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Well, the way this question is asked, that indicates that. But then if you were to look at the other questions in this document, the other results presented in this document of which we only have one page you have excerpted it, when people are actually asked about their knowledge and the extent of the risk, they are
woefully underestimating the severity.
So, for example, on page 15 of this document which is right here before us, when asked what's dangerous to health, people put smoking behind getting in and out of the bathtub, swimming in a lake, having two drinks.
So, like all polls, you know, they present complex results. But yes, that's what this one, you've read this one accurately.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Okay. Let me do two things before we move onto the next one. First off, the poll is excerpted. I have not provided you the entire set of questions; correct?
A. Well, you don't have the whole thing, but I know this document.
Q. Okay. So, you're not at any disadvantage today because you only have the page that I selected from the materials that are here?
MR. VINIK:
THE WITNESS:
I didn't make that claim. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. I just want to make it clear for the record. You quoted a page that's not here from memory you are so familiar with this document; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. I think you have given your opinions in previous cases regarding the difference between awareness, belief and you use a number of Roper Polls in your presentations traditionally; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Though that is a different question than the one you and I are discussing here as far as source credibility goes. As far as who are you most likely to believe; right?
MR. VINIK:
THE WITNESS:
Well, you see, yes. But you know
147
this is just one polling question. There is other polling data that contradicts or supports the proposition that at least among smokers, and this is not just segregated by smokers or non-smokers. They both accepted the critiques of the science that the industry put forth. And I think that the industry, you can look at, for example, the National Smoker Test which was broadcast nationally on television around 1967, in fact, '67 or '68.
And the people are looking to the Tobacco Institute in that case. Not the TIRC, but the Tobacco Institute for guidance on these things. The National Adult Use of Tobacco Survey done by the HEW in '64 and then again in '66 has, for example, one question. People will believe that cigarettes are harmful when the tobacco industry explains it or admits it. I'm going by memory here.
So, yes. I mean, you've got this piece of evidence, but there is other evidence as well.
148
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. And you know what, I think that's going to help us get through the rest of the polls I have here. I believe that there is a likelihood that you're going to present some polling data at trial, maybe even some HEW polling data about what people think; the polling what you described for me there today; correct?
A. Right.
Q. And you've done that historically in the past; right?
A. That's correct.
Q. You don't generally affirmatively offer the poll I just showed you; do you?
A. No.
Q. And fair enough. And all I want to do is just make sure that we get both sides of the equation out there. You
have considered one set of polls and I just want to put it in front of you to see if you agree there are other polls that reached contrary results.
MR. VINIK:
149
Objection.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Fair enough?
A. Fair.
Q. I will hand you Exhibit 15.
Dr. Kyriakoudes, you recognize this as the 1968 Roper Poll, A Study of Public Attitudes Toward Cigarette Smoking and the Tobacco Industry in 1968?
A. Yes.
Q. And if you turn to page 26, the page I have provided, you see the second to last sentence, "Not surprisingly, medical sources ranked high, and tobacco accompanies low." Did I read that correctly?
A. Yes.
Q. And if we look at the question here that's actually being asked, it's the
A. Yes. You have read it correctly.
Q. And once again, at the very top we have organizations like the American Medical Association and the
150
American Cancer Society at 60 percent; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. And then we get down to the tobacco companies, is that five percent?
A. That's what it says.
Q. Okay. So, according to this poll people are 12 times more likely to find the American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society 12 times more reliable than the tobacco companies?
A. Well, I would put it in this sample, three fifths of the sample were more likely to chose the first category, organizations like the American Medical Association and only one twentieths were
willing to chose the tobacco companies.
That might sound like a distinction without a difference, but it has to do with an age of sampling.
Q. Okay.
A. But yes, it's certainly more and I think we agree on that. Yes. And, of course, the striking thing as they
151
bring out in the text is the low refute that government is brought in which is a finding that's highlighted in this document.
Q. Which the poller is known as a surprising finding; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. But even the government agencies are at 14 percent; right?
A. Yes.
Q. Almost three times the number of responders that put the government more reliable than the tobacco companies?
A. Yeah. One seventh of the sample.
you said it but I just want to make sure we get the question locked in. The 60 percent of people, the difference between the 60 percent of people who find the AMA and the American Cancer Society the most reliable source compared to the five percent that find the tobacco company as the most reliable source, that's a very large difference; correct?
152
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
It's a sizeable difference, yes.
But, you know, the significance of this is not as much as you think.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Let's move to the next poll,
Doctor, Exhibit 16. The cover is a little fuzzy so I provided a second page to help you identify the document. But, Dr. Kyriakoudes, you recognize this Exhibit 16 as the Roper Poll from 1970?
Q. Regarding a Study of Public Attitude Toward Cigarette Smoking and the Tobacco Industry?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you see the bottom paragraph? It notes, "Organizations like the American Cancer Society and organizations like the American Medical Association were far and away the leaders with tobacco companies and government agencies trailing with very low mention."
153
Correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And this is we'll just call it, the polls are relatively consistent overtime; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. The Roper Polls that we have looked at are relatively consistent overtime; correct?
A. Yes. I will accept that. And it's important to point out these are
polls conducted by the industry that circulated within the industry only for its own internal use, for measuring and evaluating the various facets of knowledge of the risk of smoking, just to make that point.
Q. Okay. Based on your understanding of these polls and where they come from and who conducted them and how they were orchestrated, you nonetheless find them reliable enough to base your opinions on; correct?
154
A. Oh, yes.
Q. Okay.
A. I didn't offer that as an indicator that they were not legitimate historical sources.
Q. Okay. And if you look at the actual respondents, we see at the top the total percentages. The American Cancer Society is up there at 62 percent total and there is a breakdown between smokers at 54 percent and non-smokers at 66
Q. And if you look at the very bottom, you have the tobacco companies are now down to three percent overall. Four percent for smokers and three percent for non-smokers; correct?
A. Yes. You read that correctly.
Q. And once again, there is a significant difference between the 62 percent for the American Cancer Society and the three percent for the tobacco companies; correct?
A. Yes.
155
Q. Let's go to 1972 with Exhibit 17. Doctor, you recognize Exhibit 17 as the Roper Poll from 1972 regarding A Study of Public Attitudes Towards Cigarette Smoking and the Tobacco Industry?
A. Yes.
Q. If we turn to page 76, a page I have provided, once again you see where it says, "Organizations like the American Cancer Society and organizations like the
American Medical Association were far and away the leaders, with "tobacco companies" and "government agencies" trailing with very low mention." Correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And this chart actually does a comparison between the 70s poll we just looked at and now 1972; does it not?
A. It does.
Q. And we see again at the top, there is the American Cancer Society at 62 percent overall. Fifty-four percent for smokers, 66 percent for non-smokers; correct?
A. That's right. You read it
156
correctly.
Q. And down at the bottom there we have the tobacco companies at four percent, five percent for smokers and three percent for non-smokers; correct?
A. That's right. You read it correctly.
Q. And keep --1 blew past it on
the last one, but we will cover it here.
You look at the American Medical Association is the second source identified at 47 percent overall in 1970 and 46 percent in 1972; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. So, even if we just look at the AMA as opposed to the American Cancer Society, they are still getting a much higher rate of response than the tobacco companies; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And once again, you find the results from the 1972 poll 62 percent for the American Cancer Society versus the four percent for the tobacco companies to be a significant difference; correct?
157
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Well, yeah. There is a wide spread between those two numbers. But again, you know, the meaning of this poll in question is I think we would defer on
the meaning of it and the significance of the question and the findings overall. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Understood. And, Doctor, while we're here I want to address a point that I'm guessing you're going to point out at some point anyway. The poll does show a difference between smokers and non-smokers; does it not?
A. Yes.
Q. The tobacco companies nonetheless even for smokers, five percent in 1972; correct?
A. You read that correctly.
Q. Okay. Fifty-four percent of smokers in both 1970 and 1972 list the American Cancer Society as the most reliable source; correct?
158
A. You read that correctly.
Q. So, over half of the people polled who actually smoke put the American Cancer Society at the top of the list?
Q. Okay. Last poll, Doctor.
1980, Exhibit 18. Doctor, if you read the sentence. Well, first off, let me do this. You recognize Exhibit 18 as the Roper Poll regarding A Study of Public Attitudes Toward Cigarette Smoking and the Tobacco Industry of 1980?
A. Uh-huh (affirmative response).
Q. You will see on page 64 which I have provided you, it says, "The industry still rates low as the most reliable source of information on smoking and health, however. Here, as in past studies, "organizations like the American Cancer Society" are ranked first."
Correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And again, we look down at the results and we see there up at the top that the most reliable sources, American
159
Cancer Society, is up there at 69 and 68 percent depending on the form that was used; right?
Q. Okay. And then we see down at the bottom the tobacco companies were three percent on the X form, and the question wasn't asked on the Y form; right?
A. Right.
Q. And then underneath them is the Tobacco Institute which the question as not asked on the X form and five percent on the Y form; right?
A. You read that correctly.
Q. So, consistent with the previous polls you have looked at, the 1980 Roper Polls shows that the vast majority of people ranked organizations like the American Cancer Society as the most reliable source; correct?
A. That's the findings of this particular question, yes.
Q. And the findings of this particular question and this particular
160
poll are all consistent with the previous polls that very few people list the
tobacco companies as the most reliable source; correct?
A. That's true. They are consistent.
Q. Doctor, if we take the polls for what they are and take them for what they are worth, we talked earlier about the textbook warnings to students, don't believe the tobacco industries; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Well, try to warn people of the dangers of advertising.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. And here these Roper Polls that we just looked at reflect that people are not putting their faith in the tobacco companies?
A. Oh, there is evidence that people are putting their faith in the tobacco companies.
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, my question
161
is: The Roper Polls that we just looked
at reflect the idea that people are not putting their faith in the tobacco companies; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
No. It reflects the response to the question when given those choices, people ranked them that way. They have to chose one of those choices on the questions. But out in the wider, real world at this time, what that question doesn't measure is the scales, scope, the depth, the breadth of industry efforts to persuade people that smoking was reasonable and delightful and a harmless activity.
I think we agree that the textbooks are right, you know. The advertising is the principal cause of the use of the product.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Let me see if I can draw a more direct connection because I think I
may have asked a little bit of an overbroad question. You recall we looked at a textbook that said don't -- I'm summarizing.
A. Sure.
Q. And if I'm incorrectly summarizing, please fix it. We looked at a textbook that said, don't look to the tobacco companies. Look to the doctors who study and are concerned about your health; correct?
A. Yes. They said that because, of course, why do you have to tell people that? Because they are looking to the advertising and the power of that advertising in the culture.
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I just want -- my question is: You recall we looked, not why, the textbook said don't look to the tobacco companies. Look to the doctors; right?
A. Yes. Resist the advertising.
Q. And the Roper Polls that we just looked at based on those who were polled show that people are more likely to
believe the American Medical Association and the American Cancer Society than they are the tobacco companies; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
When the question is asked that way, yes. But when you look at what people actually believe about smoking and health, you find that it's a completely different story.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. And, Doctor, I'm going to save us both sometime. I think you have told us the story about the belief and awareness repeatedly through other testimony; correct? And that's where you are intending to reference here; right?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Well, I was just answering your question.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Fair enough. Fair enough. A
couple of other things. You recall from Linda Beverly's deposition that her and Mr. Hiott watched television together; correct?
A. We talked about that earlier.
Q. You're familiar with Public Service Announcements aimed at stopping people from smoking; right?
A. Yes.
Q. And getting people to quit smoking; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. In fact, you're very familiar with those PSAs; right?
A. Yes.
Q. You know, you saw that Linda Beverly actually recalls the Yul Brynner PSA; correct?
A. She does.
Q. And the Yul Brynner is a very famous Public Service Announcement; correct?
Q. You recall, you saw that Linda Beverly also recalls the Larry Hagman PSA;
165
correct?
A. Yes, she does.
Q. And that's another very famous PSA regarding smoking; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You also saw that Ms. Beverly remembers John Wayne and getting his lung removed from cancer and then ultimately dying from cancer; correct?
A. Yes. She mentions John Wayne.
Q. And this was Mr. Hiott's ex-wife; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Doctor, one of the things you try to do is put people in their time and place in history; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Looking at things like birth cohorts; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. I'm going to hand you Exhibit 19, a document entitled -- Dr.
Kyriakoudes, you certainly recognize Exhibit 19 as excerpts from Monograph 8; correct?
166
A. Yes.
Q. You are familiar with Monograph 8?
A. I've reviewed it, yes.
Q. You consider it a reliable authoritative source?
A. Yes. A good document.
Q. And I'm going to try to do this quickly because I think you have done this before specific to other individuals in the past; have you not?
A. Well, I'm not sure what you're referring to, but let's go.
Q. Okay. If we just look at the first page that I provided, page 8, the paragraph, Trends in Smoking Cessation. You see, "Successful cessation of cigarette smoking was uncommon prior to 1950." Mr. Hyatt was bom in 1951; correct?
Q. Then you see the sentence that picks up, "White males began to quit smoking during the mid '50s when the substantial disease risks associated with
167
smoking were first widely publicized." I read that correctly; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And the mid 1950s were Mr.
Hiott's early childhood; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. So, when we talk about placing Mr. Hiott in his place in time, when he is an infant and a toddler, the trend starts for smoking. Excuse me, people started quitting smoking during that period; correct?
A. Some did. The rate of smoking was actually increasing during this period of time. So, the number of people who were becoming regular smokers was growing both in absolute numbers and in a percentage of the population.
little bit. "A large increase in cessation occurred among males and females, both races during the years 1967 to 1970, which coincided with a substantial tobacco control effort by governmental and non-governmental agencies
168
concerned about the public health as well as with a large counter-advertising campaign on television." I read that correctly; right?
A. You read that correctly.
Q. Now, the period from 1967 to 1970, that is based on your review of the records within a year or two of Mr. Hiott beginning smoking; correct?
A. Well, yeah. Two years, '66.
Yeah. Uh-huh (affirmative response).
Q. Okay. Yes. So, basically when Mr. Hiott is starting to smoke, many others are quitting smoking; correct?
A. Some are, yes. But, you know, new people are taking it up. Cigarette sales kept growing in the United States
until 1982.
Q. If you turn to the next page, Doctor, I will just point to you where I'm going, the paragraph down here.
A. Uh-huh (affirmative response).
Q. "A rapid decline in smoking prevalence is evident across all the older cohorts after 1955, and the rate of
169
decline accelerates in the late '60s." I read that correctly?
A. I'm sorry. Let me just -show me again where you are. Yes. I see
Q. Okay. And did I read that correctly?
A. Yes.
Q. "The first major prospective mortality studies linking cigarettes to disease were published in the mid 1950s, and a concerted tobacco control effort, including a highly visible television anti-smoking campaign occurred between 1967 and 1970." Did I read that correctly?
Q. And once again, we're talking about a time period basically at the cusp of Mr. Hiott's smoking career; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. "Data for white males suggest that the effects of these tobacco control influences were felt across all cohorts of adult smokers and resulted in
170
substantial changes in smoking behavior among white males of all ages." I read that correctly?
A. Yes.
Q. And this group would include Mr. Hiott; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay.
A. And just so that you know, we are of completeness, if you just start at the top of the page. "The rapid increase in smoking prevalence that occurs during adolescence is evident in all the white male cohorts." And then they go on to
describe the high rate of adolescence smoking. But yes, you did read those earlier passages correctly.
Q. If you turn to the next page which is page 31, if you look at Figure 14, you are familiar with Figure 14?
A. Uh-huh (affirmative response).
I am.
Q. And that is the current smoking prevalence, by calendar years, for 5-year birth cohorts of white males bom
171
between 1925 and 1969; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And Mr. Hiott would be the birth cohort of 1950 to 1954; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. He is the downward dark triangle; correct?
A. Well, yeah.
Q. If you look over here.
A. Oh, I see. The copy is a little bit hard to read. Yes. There you
go-
dark triangle?
Q. This copy isn't the best copy, but let's look. If we look at the lines?
A. I'm with you.
Q. Mr. Hiott's birth cohort is the fifth line; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And we see that the smoking prevalence rate moves up the chain. It looks like it peaks out at about say 58 percent roughly in 1970; correct?
172
A. Yes. Just below 60 percent.
Q. I think that's fair enough.
And then you see a rapid decline in smoking prevalence in Mr. Hiott's birth cohort after that; correct?
A. Well, there is a general downward pattern, yes.
Q. And that's true of all birth cohorts as well; right?
A. Yes.
around 1988, south of 40 percent of current smokers; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. The copy is very difficult so I won't even try to tie you to any one of these, but we'll agree it's under 40 percent; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. So, by 1988 most over half of Mr. Hiott's birth cohorts doesn't smoke?
A. Some people quit.
Q. So, in 1988 over half of Mr. Hiott's birth cohort doesn't smoke?
A. Yeah. That's accurate.
173
Q. Mr. Hiott would be in the minority for his birth cohort?
MR. HARRISON:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Barely. But yes. But, you know, these are not elections.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Doctor, I'm going to see if I can do this so we can catch planes and get
out of here. But let me ask you this:
You are certainly familiar with the 1979 Surgeon General's Report; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You are certainly aware that in the 1979 Surgeon General's Report the Surgeon General noted that the decline in the prevalence of smoking was most significant during do you know what years?
A. You've got the document.
That's a very long document. There is over 24 Surgeon General's Reports. I have read them all, but I haven't committed them to memory just yet.
Q. From your personal knowledge
174
without the document because I certainly don't want to be unfair. From your memory, can you think, can you identify the period with the most significant decline in the prevalence of smoking in history?
A. It depends on how you measure it. Per capita consumption and the
percentage prevalence peaks in the mid '60s. It waffles around and begins to decline in the '70s.
Q. Doctor, I'm going to do it this way. I'm going to hand you Exhibit 20 which is an excerpt from the 1979 Surgeon General's Report.
Am I correct this is the excerpt from the 1979 Surgeon General's Report?
A. Yes.
Q. If you turn to, I provided the second page just to put us in context,
A-8, The Prevalence of Smoking through A-9. If you look at page A-11, the first sentence of the first full paragraph, "The Surgeon General reports the decline in the
175
prevalence of smoking was most significant during 1965 to 1970, and particularly striking for males during 1968 to 1970."
Did I read that correctly?
A. Let me take your word on it because I'm having trouble. What page are you on? Okay. That helps. I see it.
A. Yes.
Q. So, the Surgeon General is reporting that the most significant decline in smoking prevalence occurred from 1965 to 1970; correct?
A. Yes. That coincides with the period of the Fairness Doctrine. That's well-documented. It recovers, though, after 1971.
Q. Fair enough. Fair enough,
Doctor. And we're going to talk, but this period, they're basically talking, if we could put it all in historical context and let's jam it all together.
The Surgeon General's Report in 1964, pack warnings in 1966, Public Service Announcements and PSAs, concerted
176
efforts from the public health community, government, non-government entities all telling people don't smoke or stop smoking; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Correct. And yet the tobacco industry spent in one day on advertising what the entire federal government spent in a year trying to get the word out about the dangers of smoking.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. And with all of that out there, the largest decline in smoking prevalence occurs during that five year period; correct?
A. Well, there is an effective Public Service Announcement regimen which is mandated by some of the doctrines which had a real effect. In fact, was so effective that the tobacco industry voluntarily offered to pull its advertisements off of television to break that connection between paid commercial
177
advertisements and free anti-smoking advertisements. So, yes. It's true. It goes down in that period and then recovers.
Q. Okay. Let me see if I can -I will just go right to the crescendo.
Mr. Hiott starts smoking during the biggest decline in smoking prevalence in history; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Well, you're overstating it. A period of significant decline in the late '60s. Sure, but still, you know, still in his cohort youth smoking peaks at 60 percent.
So, yes. The tide is just beginning to turn, but smoking is still woven into the fabric of everyday life. Cigarette advertising is everywhere. Cigarette products are available everywhere. You're allowed to smoke everywhere.
So, yes. What you're
178
identifying is the beginning of the turn of an aircraft carrier, you know, and it's
going to turn and it's turning a little bit. But, you know, to say that this is somehow a solution to the problem of this dip and surge is overstating it. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Doctor, let me go back to my question. I wasn't going to quibble with your characterization, but I just want an answer to my question is yes or no.
Mr. Hiott began smoking during what the Surgeon General has identified as the most significant decline in the prevalence of smoking in history?
A. That's not what he says. The decline in the prevalence of smoking was most significant during '65 to 1970. He's using the word "significant" in a statistical sense because in his next sentence he talks about standard errors.
Significant in this case means not attributable to statistical chance or you are using the word differently in a more kind of everyday sense of it.
179
too far. You're putting too much into what that says. You're impacting too much meaning.
Q. More people quit smoking between 1965 and 1970 as a percentage than any other time in history; correct?
A. He doesn't say that. I disagree with that.
Q. Okay. And I think I may have messed up the transcript so I just want to get what I went in for and we will move on. The Surgeon General reported in 1979 that the decline in the prevalence of smoking was most significant during 1965 to 1970; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Mr. Hiott began smoking since between 1965 and 1970; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Doctor, you and I, we've talked about the PSAs and we've talked about the Fairness Doctrines, things of that nature that are going on during this time period; correct?
A. Well, yeah. I have referenced them. That's correct.
Q. You are familiar that the Surgeon General in 1994 actually describes the period from July 1st, 1967 through July 31st, 1970 as an unusual historic period; correct?
A. Again, there are over two dozen Surgeon General reports. I have read them all, but I haven't committed them to memory.
Q. Is Exhibit 21 an excerpt from the 1994 Surgeon General's report?
A. Yes.
Q. You see there on the bottom left-hand column, "During an unusual history period between July 1st, 1967 through December 31st, 1970, anti-smoking messages were widely aired on television and radio as part of the FTCs Fairness Doctrine."
A. That's correct.
Q. And once again, this is the period of time on the cusp of Mr. Hiott's smoking career; correct?
A. He is a 17-year old smoker, 18-year old smoker during this period.
Q. He's just starting; right?
A. Well, he started when he was 14, but this covers the early part of his smoking experience. As it says, "Several research studies show that young people are aware of and respond to cigarette advertising."
Q. Which question was that responsive to, Doctor?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. It also notes, does it not, if we're going on the right paragraph, "A carefully designed study of nearly 7,000 adolescents found that having both sets of messages on radio and television had the affect of reducing adolescence smoking rates. The impact was strongest during the first year of the anti-smoking messages." Correct?
A. And again, the significance of that is, you know, advertising when it's anti-smoking advertising also works. And when you have that as part of the message it can be effective.
Q. And certainly, Doctor, during Mr. Hiott's adolescent years, it was part of the message; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. It was an unusual historic period; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Well, you have this Fairness Doctrine which was that made it different from the period before and the period after, yes. But again, the tobacco industry was still doing it's best to put out it's pro-smoking messages.
MR. HARRISON:
Can we go off the record for five minutes?
(RECESS WAS TAKEN) EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
183
Q. Back on the record. Dr. Kyriakoudes, is there anything specific to Mr. Hiott that you intend to testify at the trial that we have not discussed yet here today?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
I'm not recollecting or recalling anything right now.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. Okay. Due to the objection because I want to make sure I get this, I want to go back to where we started. You have your generic opinions and you have opinions specific to Mr. Hiott.
And as I understand it, you are going to connect those opinions by placing Mr. Hiott in time, space and circumstance. Beyond that, beyond the things we've discussed and the Post Office, what brand of cigarettes you have
him smoking, anything else that you can think of that you would intend to testify at trial that we haven't talked about?
184
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
I can't think of anything else. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. You mentioned earlier the plastic filter tips that Mr. Hiott, Ms. Beverly testified Mr. Hiott used for a period of time?
A. Uh-huh (affirmative response).
I did, yes.
Q. What do you intend to testify at trial regarding those filter tips?
A. If it comes up and if asked,
I'm not recollecting the brand name, but it was it's just an example of an attempt to quit. That's all.
Q. Is an attempt to quit significant in formulating your opinions? MR. VINIK:
Objection. Go ahead.
THE WITNESS:
No actually.
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. Okay. So, whether Mr. Hiott
185
tried to quit or not is irrelevant to your overall opinions in this case; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, there is no evidence that you're aware of that Mr.
Hiott was unaware of the risks of smoking; correct?
A. Well, that's a loaded question. I just don't even know how to answer that one. What risks? When? I mean, you can't answer that question.
It's unanswerable because it's too broad and too vague.
Q. Let me try to narrow it down.
You have no evidence that Mr. Hiott was unaware of the risks of lung cancer from smoking?
MR. VINIK:
EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. At any point where he was smoking?
MR VINIK:
Same objection.
THE WITNESS:
186
The only way I could answer that question is to say that for young people of Mr. Hiott's cohorts, exactly his cohorts, the research is clear that while young people had a generalized sense that smoking was harmful in an abstract way, they did not understand that the cigarette they were smoking when they were 12 or 14 or 17 was going to lead to a career of smoking or a long-term period of smoking, and that would then lead to the possibility of disability or death for them as individuals.
And research studies done in the late '60s are asking those very questions.
So, that's the best I can answer that question which, of course, is consistent
with the method by which I applied all this to.
EXAMINATION BY MR HARRISON:
Q. And I just wanted to do --1 was going to reframe my question. You have no evidence that Mr. Hiott individually and apart from the broader group to which he belongs was unaware of
187
the risk of lung cancer from smoking?
A. Again, for Mr. Hiott's own personal thoughts and feelings, I have no ability to make an opinion one way or the other. One, because the evidence isn't there and so I'm not going to have an opinion on that issue either way.
Q. Okay. It's not relevant to your opinions?
A. Well, again just like what we talked about earlier where I'm not going to put him in front of a specific advertisement on a specific date and then chart the specific thought process in his brain. I can't get down to that level of biographic level of his brain. I don't
think anybody can.
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, as I understand some foundation of your testimony, it's that Mr. Hiott is typical of his generation? Is that a fair statement?
A. Yeah. He's part of a -- he's part of society. I would frame it this way. His behavior is one that's shared by
188
millions of people.
Q. Do you intend to give any opinions regarding any specifics of Mr. Hiott's life as being typical or A-typical of other folks by way of example? Meaning his income, his educational level, things of that nature?
A. Yeah. Sure. You know, he's representative of classes of people. I mean, for example, while we talked earlier from the Surgeon General's report that chapter by David Bums I believe is the one that wrote that chapter in the Surgeon General's report on white male smoking.
We know what happens to cigarette smoking is it becomes more and more of a working class phenomenon. That if you look at the age and education groups, I'm sorry. Let me rephrase that.
If you look at the income and education groups who begin to abandon smoking and not enter into the smoking practice during this time, I think it starts from the top.
And so it's the better
189
educated and more prosperous which is ironic because back when the epidemic began in the 19 teens and the 1920s it was reversed.
Q. I will ask this question because I will kick myself if I don't.
You're familiar, you read in Linda Beverly's deposition the relationship that her and Mr. Hiott had either immediately preceding or immediately following their divorce; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And specifically, I am talking
about Ms. Beverly says that Mr. Hiott beat her on two occasions; correct?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
That's what she describes, yes. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. When you are placing someone in their historical time, place and circumstance, how would you factor in behavior which on its face diverges from the societal norm?
190
A. Well, as unpalatable, unpleasant that section of the deposition is, its relevance to smoking alludes me.
So, it's what it is, but it also doesn't seem to really reflect anything about his history as a smoker which is why I'm here.
Q. Well, and my questions are actually in the sense of as I understand your testimony and your opinions in this case is that Mr. Hiott behaved as people of that generation behaved based on all
the things that were going on around him.
And I think it's pretty clear that in the situation other than smoking that's not true. Fair enough?
MR. VINIK:
Objection.
THE WITNESS:
Well, my opinions relate to smoking and the history of tobacco. I'm not an expert in that subject. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:
Q. Okay.
A. An expert in that subject may have some, find some meaning in that. I
191
don't.
Q. Okay. And, Doctor, all I wanted, all I want to know and I think we are going to be done here is just to see if you took into account any of the facts or circumstances surrounding the tumultuous relationship between Mr. Hiott and Ms. Linda Beverly around 19 -- when they separated.
the deposition. But it has no bearing whatsoever on the issues for which I've been asked to testify on.
Q. Okay. Dr. Kyriakoudes, unless you have an opinion or basis of an opinion that we haven't discussed or that we haven't otherwise covered, I don't think I have anymore questions for you.
MR. VINIK:
Is that a question?
MR. HARRISON:
I just want to be sure that I think that we have covered everything. EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON: Q. And I believe you have once.
192
I just want to make sure that I'm not leaving anything out. This is sort of your last chance to say, hey, I plan on talking about something that you didn't ask me about. So, you should know about it now.
MR. VINIK:
Is that a question?
MR. HARRISON:
That's a question.
MR. VINIK:
Object. You can answer.
THE WITNESS:
I feel that we have talked about a great deal in our four hours here.
MR. HARRISON:
With that representation, I have no further questions.
MR. VINIK:
And I have no questions.
