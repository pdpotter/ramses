A. No. I didn’t say that*
Q. you said that's when you located it/ after you started looking at materials

HR. McCONNELLj Nice try.
HR. HOAGi Well# it was a nice try of you guys to give it to me on the day of the deposition.
MR. McCONNELL: At least we gave you stuff you asked for. How many times have we asked you for stuff from your experts
%
and you never produced it# then we have follow-up deposition# we ask a lot of stupid questions about them hunting through their garage.
MR. HOAGi 1 would think you would have expertise about stupid questions#
Steve.
MR. McCONNELLi Sure# because I have been in depositions with you# John.
Ask your questions# or we'll go.

Steve?
It's interesting# Steve# that you decided to come up with this lengthy#
lengthy speaking objection*
Is there anything else you would like to say before I continue?
HR. WcCONNELLt I'm not even objecting. I'm juBt talking with you*

me •
MR. MCCONNELLi Sure.

MR. McCONNELL: I'm sure you will raise something. I eagerly await your next idiocy so I can address it.
MR. HOAGt That was pretty clever.
Is there any other abusive language you would like to use?
MR. McCONNELLi I'm sure you will inspire some.
MR. HOAG: So far you've said stupid and idiocy. Anything else you have on your mind today?
MR* McCONNELLi If you've got any more questions# John# go ahead. If you
don't* let's go.
HR• HOAG: Noi I was wondering if you have anything else to say.
MR. McCONNELLt Waiting for your next question* John.

MR. McCONNELLt Is that a question*
John?
MR. HOAG: That's a statement*
(Brief recess*)
MR. HOAGt Okay. On the record. The court reporter was away for several minutes trying to figure out how to work the video machine and we're still trying to figure that out* but* meanwhile* we'll continue the deposition.

Q. And when you say distributed to members* do you mean distributed to all members of
4-H# some members# some states* or how -- what do you mean when you use the words distributed to members?
A. Magazines and newsletters distributed to members*
Q. And by that do you mean distributed to all members of 4-H?
A. Yes* sir.
Cu What — what was your method of ascertaining that these things were actually distributed to each member of 4-H who was a member during that period of time?
A. I looked at the magazine# which indicated the distribution list# or I looked at the newsletter# which indicated the distribution list.
Q* Did it have actual names on the distribution list?
A. No# sir*
Q. Well# what did you see on the distribution list?
A. It indicated the various areas of 4-H to which these newsletters were sent.

(Whereupon# Plaintiff's Exhibit Number 1 was marked for identification*)
BY HR* HOAGt
Q. I'm showing you what's been marked as Plaintiff's exhibit 1*
Do you recognise that?
A. I do*
Q. What is that?
A* That is a supplemental production list for this case.
©. Okay. On that list* are there 4-H publications listed there that you're aware of?
A. Yes/ sir.

A* Page 2.
Q. Okay. That would be -- there's three listed* National 4-H News# and there's -- oh# there's four of them* is that correct?

months?
A. Yes.

Q. Was it more than -- but you have looked at these? right?
A. X have.
0. Was it more than 40 pages long?
A* Could be.
Q. More than 50 pages long?
A. I remember things by weight. I would say it would be similar to a Time or a Newsweek magazine. That's the best way I can describe it.
Q. Was there any advertisements in the 4-H News* the National 4-H News?
A. I can't recall.
Q. Now* you have here 10 slash 00-1968. Does that mean August 1968 edition o£ National 4-H News? Is that what that represents?
A. Yes.
Q. I mean -- not August -- October.
A* October.
So that must have been in that period
a month late. It varied*
Q. And "Delevoping the 4-H" was the title. Is that the title of an article that was
in the magazine —
A* Yes, sir*
Q. — for that month?
.	A* Yes, sir*	.
0. How many articles were there in the magazine that month?
A. Again, it would be similar to that of a magazine like Time or Newsweek* There would be a number of short pieces and then there would be feature articles, and there would be several feature articles. This was one of them.	.
0. The people who* for example — if you know the answeri you might not people who subscribe to time magazine, do roost of people who subscribe to Time magazine read every article in the magazine?
HR. HOWARD* Objection to fora.
KS. TYLERj Objection/ speculation.
MR. HOAGt I agree with that. But if you know.
A. I don't know. You want to ask me what I read?
BY MR. HOAG:
Qi No, 1 guess we're talking here about what you've referred to earlier as a reasonable
degree of historical certainty* is that right?
A* Uh-huh.
Q. Is that right?
You need to use words# you need to
use words*
A* What is the question?
Q. 1 said* we're talking about now what you've referred to before as a reasonable degree of historical certainty* correct?
A. I didn't refer to this magazine with reference to a reasonable degree of historical
■
certainty*
What is your question?
Q. Okay. Well* what is your definition of a reasonable degree of historical certainty?
MS. TYLER; Objection* asked and answered in the last deposition* 1 really hate to go over old ground* John.
MR. HOAGt You can answer.
A. First of all* let me indicate that the definition that I gave has nothing to do with the current discussion about this 4-H article* 1 was asked in the first deposition to give a definition of reasonable historical certainty as I use that in ray professional opinion.
In the last deposition I was asked whether I have a — an opinion about the two plaintiffs at the time* And I indicated within a reasonable degree of historical certainty that I believe that both plaintiffs at the time* Nary Farnan and Angie Della Vecchia, were exposed to the serious health risks of smoking and the difficulty of smoking — of quitting once started.
The definition of reasonable historical certainty is that there is sufficient evidence that a conclusion can be drawn based upon the evidence.
BY HR. HOAGt
Q* And then, that the conclusion can be drawn within a reasonable degree of historical certainty# is that correct?
A. Certainty, that's right.
Q. Do you have a reasonable degree of historical certainty that Mary Farnan read the article in the National 4-H News titled “Delevoping the Fourth H" that was published in October of 196 8?
A. The reasonable degree of historical certainty is based upon the totality of information. This is only one article.
Q. But as to that one article; do you have an opinion one way or the other whether or not* within a reasonable degree of historical certainty# whether or not Mary Farnan read it?
A. In terms of the totality of her experience as a very avid reader # I believe that she was exposed to 4-H information*
Q. WeiIf my specific question was* Was this particular article* "Delevoping the Fourth H" that was printed in October of 1966# which is on
part of your supplemental list* within a
. • ' *
reasonable degree of historical certainty is it your opinion that Mary Farnan actually read that article?
A. I have no specific information as to whether or not she read that specific article*
Q. You don't even know if she even saw that edition of the National 4-H News* do you?
A. I do not know for certain*
Q. That would be true for all the editions of the National 4-H News* correct?
A* X can't identify a specific article with Mrs* Farnan's reading it* which is not the way in which a historian bases conclusions*
O* That would also be true for every —
every article that you have listed in your supplemental production list* you don't know whether any of the three people listed here* Mrs* Farnan* Mrs. Della Vecchia or Frank Amodeo read any particular articles listed here* correct?
A. That's not true*
Q* Which article did any of them read that you know within a reasonable degree of historical certainty?
A. He know — I know from the testimony of all three plaintiffs that they admitted reading certain magazines* that they were regular readers of these magazines. To give you one example*
Frank Amodeo said he was a sports enthusiasts and he read avidly Playboy and Sports Illustrated.
Q. For example* then* you have Sports Illustrated here and Playboy* you have four Playboy articles and one Sports Illustrated article. So* do you know within a reasonable degree of historical certainty that Frank Amodeo read the Sports Illustrated article that was in the June 3rd* 1991 edition* titled "Puff* You're an Outcast"?	„
A. I don't know for certain that he read that particular one* but he read some articles in
Playboy, Sports Illustrated.
Q» Are there any particular articles that are listed on your supplemental production list that you can say within a historical degree of — within a reasonable degree of historical certainty that any one of these three people read? And that's Mary Farnan# Angie Della Vecchia or Prank Amodeo.
A. He could not identify a specific one to a specific plaintiff* However# that isn't the way we define the totality of the experience*
Okay. So to come up with a conclusion concerning a reasonable degree of historical certainty, you look at the totality of the experience?
A. That is correct.
Q. And that would include everything that an individual is exposed to related to# for example# cigarette smoking# correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. So# did you actually look at everything that these three individuals were exposed to concerning cigarette smoking?
MS. TYLERj Objection, form, vague.
A. I don't know what you mean.
BY MR, HOAGt
Q. Hell/ you looked at articles that have titles in them/ some titles at least in them concerning cigarette smoking' correct?
A. 1 looked at all the articles that X could discern that related to the issue of health awareness regarding cigarette smoking and the difficult of quitting once started.
Q. You looked — for example/ you looked at issues of Sports Illustratedr correct?
A. For the period of Mr. Amodeo's life.
Q. And only Mr« Amodeo's life and no one else? You weren't concerned with any of the other people? Just Mr. Amodeo and Sports Illustrated# right?
A. in constructing the lives of the plaintiffs/ neither Ms. Farnan nor Mrs. Della Vecchia indicated that they read those magaeines.
Q. So for Sports Illustrated/ for example# did you look at how many cigarette advertisements there were in a given issue of Sports Illustrated?
A. I did not.
Q. Then how can you have looked at the totality of the exposure of the individual if you
didn’t look at how many cigarette advertisements
,« .
they were exposed to?	'
A* Historian deals with all types of evidence* There is credible evidence and there is evidence which is not credible from the standpoint of the issue that you're examining*
Hr. Amodeo described himself as an average* intelligent person* Those are his words from his deposition* Cigarette ads do not relate to providing information about health risks/ at least not until the early '70's when there were warnings placed on those ads.
Q, Have you ever —> are you familiar with any advertisements during any period of time . for cigarettes that said/ for example* more doctors smoke a particular brand of cigarettes than any than any other brand?
A. X am *	'
Q. When did those exist?
A. They existed until the Federal Trade Commission in 1955 put restrictions on those type of ads. And during the period when those ads were used* there was enormous criticism from various publications about those ads.
Q. Did those ads appear* for example* to
your knowledge, in Sports Illustrated?
A. It was called Sport back in that era.
Q. Did those ads appear in Sport or Sports Illustrated, to your knowledge?
A* Didn't look at it in the period from the 1940 'Sf because Hr. Amodeo indicated he did not see ads in the 1940's in his deposition* He said *50's and *60's, so I believe I looked at those ads beginning from 1950 to '55, when the PTC put a prohibition*
Cl. Did you see any ads in Sports Illustrated from the period of 1950 to 1955 prior to what you referred to as the FTC prohibition relating to more doctors smoking certain brands of cigarettes?
A. 1 can't recall for certain, but there were ads similar to that.
Q. How many?
A. X didn't count them.
Q. Did you list any of them in your supplemental production?
A. 1 did not for the reasons I indicated. Those reasons were a historian deals with various types of evidence. There's credible evidence and there's not credible evidence with
respect to the issue of health warnings about smokingi
Q. There were no health warnings on cigarette packages in the 1950's* correct?
A* No* there were studies done which indicated the serious risks of smoking * health risks*
Q. And also there were people from the Tobacco institute who were quoted in newspapers and magazines and television shows and radio programs saying that the link between cigarette
■	_ ■ ' > * smoking and disease had not been proven* correct?
HR. McCONNELLt Objection* foundation
’ * ^ , t as to time.
BY MR. HOAGt
Q. 1950's* correct?
A. Mr. Amodeo indicated in his first
deposition that he ,did not know anything about the
Tobacco Industry — Tobacco Institute* the Council
for Tobacco Research.
MR. HOAGt That wasn't my question.
Could you read back my question? And if you could please answer my question* I'd appreciate it.
(Whereupon* the reporter read back
the question as follows:
"Question! And also there were people from the Tobacco Institute who were quoted in newspapers and magazines and television shows and radio programs saying that the link between cigarette smoking and disease had not been proven* correct?")
NR. HOAGj Answer that particular question.
THE WITNESS* There were individuals in the tobacco industry who were arguing that there had not been a direct causal effect relationship established and they were also arguing that more research needed to be done.
By HR. HOAG:
Q. Okay. Now * did any of the articles that you listed in the supplemental —
Before I get to that' what you're referring to were people from the Tobacco Institute and the tobacco industry made these kinds of comments in the media. These comments were also made in the 1960'sr and 1970's and 19 60's and 1990's# correct?
A. Repeat the question.
HR* HOAGj Could you repeat the question?

A* Z can't recall the numberst nor I do
not*
Q* Do you know whether it's more than 50 percent of the articles you listed?
A* I don't know. The usual policy of an article/ a news article# is for the journalist to provide the major thrust# which in this case would have been the health concerns that the Surgeon
General or someone else had# and then/ at the end of the etory there was usually what we call a tag paragraph/ which would indicate the reaction of the tobacco industry or the Tobacco Institute*

MR. McCONNELLi Objection to form.
A. I indicated to your Mr. Hoag/ earlier that there are two types of evidence the historian examines. There's credible evidence and there's evidence that is not credible* The average intelligent person doesn't get health warning information from advertisements for cigarettes* Those are the — designed to sell things/ they're not designed to provide information relating to health warnings/ health risks.
The historian deals with the subject area under concern* He* Amodeo referred to himself as an average intelligent person* And one doesn't get# if you're characterized in that status* health information from cigarette ads or from watching Edward R* Murrow smoke cigarette after cigarette* as you claim.

MS. TYLERt Objection to form*
A. I'm sure it was covered in the media* BY MR. HOAGi

Q. Do you know whether or not Prank Amodeo or Angie Della Vecchia or Mary Farnan saw any of those published reports where in the Tobacco Institute document called "The Continuing Controversy" was discussed or written about?
A» They didn't refer to it in their depositions.

"Smoke More to Smoke Less."
Q. So you're just guessing? you don't know whether any of them did?
A. Well# what 1 am saying is I indicated in my earlier answer that most newspaper articles at this time provide the lead thrust and then often provide as a tag paragraph what the Tobacco Institute and the tobacco industry believes.
Q. Now# the tobacco industry* through the Tobacco Institute# they released "The Continuing Controversy" document actually before the Surgeon General's report of 1979 was released*
correct?
A. I'm not certain about the tinting.

Q. Do you have to smoke to understand what that means?
a. Weilr if z did smoker 1 would certainly pursue it* I have no idea.
G. what does the word ultra mean to you? Just the common-sense definition of ultra.
A. I would have to look at a dictionary definition. 1 think it's what we call a kind phrase* And,a kind phrase merits attention according to its usage, it probably is a derivative from the word ultimate. And that would take on all sorts of meanings* It could mean ultimater being a very high plateau. That's one meaning it could have. The word, ultra takes on a new definition and it's probably a hyphenated word. I really don't know. I have never given it much thought because 1 don't smoke*
Q. It's not something you were asked to do as an expert for this caser right?
A. Againr my focus was upon health awareness. There are warnings included in those adsf I believer that have the ultra lights.
G, Does the word ultra/ ultra light in your opinion convey in any way conceptually the idea that this cigarette is/ quote* ultra light cigarette is safer than other cigarettes that are not ultra light?
A. No* 1 don't know what that means* I have always been fascinated by what people assume is a meaning. For example/ the word Ex-Lax for a laxative. I've always been amazed by the "ex" there*
Q. Do you know if the cigarette industry has done any research to find out what consumers think that word means/ ultra light?
A. Again? I don't know. My concern is health awareness.
Q. Well# hypothetically* assuming that the cigarette industry or at least some cigarette companies have done research that indicates to them that the word light and/or ultra light indicates to at least some cigarette Bmokers that a cigarette is safer or more healthy than another cigarette* would that in any way change any of your opinions?

A. Tillman Act of 1913 was passed to prevent corporations from engaging directly in political campaigns. That was one year before the FTC was established.
BY MR. HOAG*
Q. Okay. So is it your opinion/ then/ that the tobacco industry does not contribute to political campaigns in any way/ shape or form and hasn't since 1913?

A, I have lectured on this and I have written about it. I think I did an article one

Andr therefore# this contributes to a stability with regard to our society in that no one group has a preponderant influence on any other one*

BY MR. HOAG?
Q. Nowt do you Know whether or not the legislation could be passed or regulations could be implemented defining cigarettes as a drug and stating that cigarettes shall be under the enforcement of the Food and Drug Administration?
A. Historically there were attempts to do that in Congress and they never came about*
Q. And that would be because those competing forces* one group# for example* public health who wants that* and the other group* the cigarette industry who doesn't* came together and Congress was lobbied by both groups and Congress ended up deciding to vote at least in that instance on the side of the tobacco industry* correct?
A. Mo* that's a mischaracterization.
Q. In what way is that a mischaracterization based on your knowledge as a historian?
A. Well* what 1 gave you earlier* and which you aptly characterized my testimony# 1 indicated that the usual scenario is that there is a stalemate*	~
There is something in between# as you called it. At this point we do have something in
between. We do have regulations that have been promulgated by the FTC with respect to advertising. Those regulations do not go so far as to be legally held to encompass treating tobacco as a drug* So* I think we're in the middle# just as you aptly characterized it earlier.
q. Do you know whether there were wore PTC enforcement actions filed and litigated under the Reagan administration or under the Clinton administration?
MS. TYLERi objection# scope# relevance.
■	mr. McConnelli Porm.
MS. TYLERt That works# too.
A. I haven't studied the comparative aspects of that# no# sir.
BY MR. HOAGt
Q. Would it surprise you if there were far more enforcement actions under the Clinton administration than there were under the Reagan administration?
MS. TYLER- Same objections.
A. No. I've lived in Washington for 35 years? I'm not surprised by the fact that
different administrations have different foci.
BY HR. HOAG;	'
Q* And the tobacco industry contributes a greater amount of its PAC money to Republican candidates than it does to democratic candidates? correct?
A. That's not precise* They contribute most of their money to encumbents* They know the records* That's the greatest variable# encumbency? not party*
Q. Okay. So at the present time the
%
majority of Congress are Republicans? correct?
A. Encumbency? that's the basic test. Political Science 101*
Q* And that's because the people that have the power are the people that you want to influence? correct?
A. You have a track record as an incumbent. That's the critical issue.
Q* Now? historically? if — if a — if the person that was a member of Congress had a track record of opposing everything that the cigarette industry is in favor of? in your opinion as a historian? would the cigarette industry be more likely to contribute more money to the
candidate who was not the incumbent under those circumstances?	'
A. You know# that's a hypothetical. I really can't deal with a hypothetical, if you give me a specific Congress person; I would be happy to tell you whether Z know about that Congress person. But it's a hypothetical.
Q. Well; you talked about track record;
right?
A. That's right.
G. And by track record; you mean voting
■ t .
recordr right?
A. Voting record* support efforts; meetings with these individuals. 1 used to work on the Hill. I'm well aware of the process*
Q. And part of the — what did you do on the Hill?
A. I was an aide to Senator Spessard L. Holland.
Q. South Carolina?
A. No; shame on you* State of Florida.
Q. Oh/ I'm sorry. Yes; I should be ashamed.
A. Nowf you have two bad marks against
you.
Ci. I was thinking of someone else.
A. One from Steve# another from me.
Shame on you.
Q. Absolutely* Floridat you're right.
A. We should bring this thing to a close right now*
Q. You're rightt he was a Benator from Florida.
A. May 1 ask you some questions now?
Q. You know what I was thinking oft 1 was thinking of Hollingst Fritz Rollings/ when you said that.
A* Shame on you.
Q. But he's still a senator and Holland isn't. I'm right about that. Holland is not a senator from Florida now.
Okay. So you worked as an aide for Senator Holland. What years did you do that?
A. 1959 to 1964.
Q. Did you ever have any dealings with lobbyists during that time that you were there working on the Hill?
A. I did. The one that I recall most vividly is that Florida tobacco farmers used to routinely come to Spessard Holland»s office
because he was head of the agricultural committee* Senate agriculture committee/ and Florida tobacco growers were very eager to get Senator Holland to support their efforts to maintain price supports and to provide assistance to the already existing Florida state marketing manner# which leads me to point out that one of my research focuses which I forgot to mention at the beginning is also the extent to which Florida by legislative choice has supported and promoted the production of tobacco here in the state.
. *
But I do recall the tobacco farmers comingr and I recall it because the senator was so solicitous with respect to courtesy at the time.
Q. Do you recall any members of the tobacco industry ever contacting you or Senator Holland?
A* No. 1 was a young person. I don't
recall.
Q. Okay. That doesn't mean it didn't happen# it's just something that you didn't experience# to your knowledge# is that correct?
A. 1 can't remember.
0. you can't remember it one way or the other* right?
A. I can't remember that as an imprint* because I remember the farmers were appropriately dressed* You would notice someone in overalls? you would not in a suit*
Q* Okay* The farmers were in overalls* but almost everybody else that came in there lobbying were in suits* is that what you're saying?
A. Yeah.
Q* So* if you did see people from the tobacco industry# they would have looked like everybody else?
A. Well* again* I don't recall* They did not make an imprint on my mind* The farmers did.
Q. Within a reasonable degree of historical certainty was Frank Amodeo exposed to cigarette advertisements in newspapers?
A. Yes*
Q* Within a reasonable degree of historical certainty* was Prank Amodeo exposed to cigarette advertisements in magazines?
A. Yes.
Q. Within a reasonable degree of historical certainty* was Frank Amodeo exposed to
cigarette advertisements on billboards?
A. Yes.
0. Within a reasonable degree of medical certainty* was Frank Amodeo —
A, Medical certainty?
Q. I'm sorry. Of historical certainty. If I ever say medical * X don't mean it. X mean historical in this context*
Within a reasonable degree of historical certaintyr was Frank Amodeo exposed to cigarette advertisements on television in the 1950's and 1960*6?
A■ Yes.
Q. Within a reasonable degree of historical certaintyr was Frank Amodeo exposed to cigarette advertising on the radior up until the late 1960's?
A. Yes.
Gt. Within a reasonable degree of medical certainty was Frank -*■
A. Medical*
Q. Scratch it again. I'm sorry.
Within a reasonable degree of historical certaintyr was Frank Amodeo exposed to statements from the tooacco industry and/or
tobacco industry spokesperson or persons stating that the link between cigarette smoking and disease had not been proven?
A* I can't give you that reasonable certainty because his depositions are in conflict.
In the first deposition he indicated under examination that he did not know what the Tobacco Institute was about.
In his affidavit of February 2nd;
1998 he had a differing opinion.
And in his continued deposition of October 8th* that also differed from the original deposition of July 17th. So there is inconsistency in that.
Q. So# would it be necessary for a person to be familiar with the name Tobacco Institute for them to have been exposed to statements made by representatives of the tobacco industry through the Tobacco Institute?
A. If there is no conflict in their testimony. There is conflict in his.
On the one handr he says he knew nothing about it and* on the other hand/ later on he says he was influenced by them. So I'm only pointing out the discrepancy/ Mr. Hoag.
Q, You’re saying that based on your reading of Frank Amodeo's depositions that you believe that at one point during one of his depositions he wasn't familiar with the Tobacco Institute/ is that correct?
A. Page 29 of the first deposition/ July ; 171 he indicated that he did not know — he just said vaguely, tie didn't know what they were all about.
Q. Now / you would agree that a person
could read an article and read a statement in an
J . %
article that someone was saying that the link between cigarette smoking and disease had not been established without remembering that the person was from what is called the Tobacco Institute/ correct?
A. Well/ I would be very concerned as a historian if under one situation an individual says one thing and then in another situation they say the opposite. So I can't agree with your question to a reasonable degree of historical certainty in that matter in which there is discrepancy in the testimony. That's what I am indicating to you.
Q. Okay. Would you agree/ though/ that
not knowing? being familiar with the word or words Tobacco Institute is not the same as not being familiar with statements made to the effect that the link between cigarette smoking and disease had not been proven?
A. That isn't the case with Mr. Amodeo. In the original deposition he did not know those groups* In his affidavit of February 2nd he identified those groups as being responsible for statements. There's a discrepancy there* And you're asking me tor with reasonable historical certainty# to make a conclusion and I can't.
Q. That's not my question.
But would you agree that it's quite reasonable for someone to remember reading statements that it has not been proven that there is a link between cigarette smoking and disease# to remember reading those statements# but not remember who exactly said it# whether it was the Tobacco Institute or Chesterfield or Phillip Morris# or what# without remembering who exactly said it# it is possible to remember having read it?
HR. McCONNELLj Objection to form.
BY MR, HOAGj
Q* Correct?
A. I don't think it's possible for an individual to say in one deposition that you don't know what the Tobacco Institute or the Council for Tobacco Research is and in a second legal document to so identify these as having produced statements relating to cigarettes. That's very difficult for a historian or any researcher to reconcile. They are totally different statements.
Q. Okay. Now# I understand what your answer is* but that wasn't my question.
%
My question is# and this is all my question ist In your opinion* isn't it reasonable for a person to remember that they read or heard someone say the link between cigarette smoking and disease has not been proven# without at that time remembering who exactly said it or what organization specifically it was attributed to?
HR. McCONNELLi Objection to form.
HR. HOWARDi Can we have a clarification? Are you talking about making this a hypothetical as opposed to talking about this plaintiff# Mr. Amodeo?
MR. HOAGs yes# it's a hypothetical# whether it's reasonable.
MS. TYLER: And my other question ist Are you presuming in your hypothetical that all of those types of statements would have only come from the tobacco industry?
MR. HOAG: My hypothetical is what it
is.
Can you answer the question?
A. It's reasonable if the testimony of the individual that you've hypothetically designated is consistent. If that individual is consistent in the testimony# I would say that's reasonable*
BY MR. HOAG:
Q. Now/ if the individual you're referring to a number of years later or a certain length of time later became aware that those statements that he heard were statements made by the Tobacco Institute/ would it then be reasonable for him to put two and two together and realize that's where they came from?
A. It would be reasonable if the person were able to identify consistently either by name# innuendo or the type of organization/ rather than for the individual to be inconsistent in the testimony.
So if a person is consistent/ even if the person is vague about the organization and continues to be vague and gets more information based upon thatr it's reasonable* But if the person is inconsistent* on one hand giving a deposition saying I know nothing about it and several months later giving an affidavit and saying 1 didr in factr know about itr historian works in credibility* whether a source is credible. Therefore* 1 can't give you reasonable and historical certainty with regard to the question that you asked.
(Whereupon* plaintiff’s Exhibit Number 2 was marked for identification.)
BY MR. HOAG:
Q. 1 want to show you your disclosure statement for this case* or what's been labeled your Revised Expert Disclosure.
Okay. Now * did you prepare this or -- did you prepare this* ie my first question?
A. I prepared a boilerplate sometime ago for cases I was involved inr and this was done with the assistance of editing by counsel.
Q, Nowi the portion of this disclosure . that concerns Mary Farnan and Angie Della Vecchiar
has it changed in any way since the last disclosure statement that was discussed in August of 1999?
HR* McCONNELLt Object# because the document speaks for itself.
A. No* I think that's the same. He just added Mr* Amodeo and then we added a section about the legislative choice# punitive damages phase*
BY MR. HOAGt
0. Okay. Nowt the portion that you mentioned on Page 2# punitive damages stage# what is your understanding of the punitive damages , stage?
MR. McCONNELLt Objection# calls for a legal conclusion.
A. I'm not a lawyer. I have no idea what it is* I was asked to prepare materials regarding the history of Florida's involvement in the promotion# restriction# taxing# regulating.
BY MR. HOAGt
Q. Now# are those materials listed in the Supplemental Production List?
A. Yes# sir# they are.
Q. Can you point out where those are#
please?
A. May I have it?
Q. Sure. That's Plaintiff's Exhibit 1,
A. Okay. Mr. Hoag# if you go to Page 31* fourth item down —■ and they run* sir# all the way through Page 32* Page 33# Page 34/ Page 35 and Page 36.
G. Now* as to all those things that you just listed and identified as being on Pages 31 through 36# do you* within a reasonable degree of historical certainty* know whether Angie Della Vecchia or Mary Farnan or Frank Amodeo saw any of them or read any of them?
A. That's not relevant to these three plaintiffs.
Q. What is it relevant to?
A. It's relevant to the fact that in the punitive damage stage* information such as that described on Pages 31 through 36 has been compiled to show that the State of Florida participated in terms of the promotion of tobacco products or tobacco itself or the gaining of excise taxes from the sale of tobacco and tobacco products.
Q. So you're saying that you have — you have an opinion that the State of Florida promoted the sale and use of tooacco* as we so define itt
in terms of these particular documents?
Q, And do you have an opinion as to whether or not the tobacco industry promoted the sale and use of tobacco?
A. In the State of Florida?
Q* Yes.
A. Mo* This was — this confines itself only to the State of Florida.
Xn other words/ to what extent did the State of Florida encourage/promote the production of tobacco products and even the manufacture in state facilities of tobacco products.
Q. What does that have to do with whether or not the tobacco industry should be punished for their behavior?
MR. McCONNELL: Objection/ calls for
a legal conclusion.
A. That's a legal question. I have no *>- I'm not a lawyer.
BY MR. HOAG}
0. Well/ you will agree that the tobacco industry did promote cigarette smoke amongst people who lived in the State of Florida and continued to do so# correct?
A. Nor you've missed the focus.
Q. No/ but* see/ that's my question. My question is — even if you think I've missed the focus# my question is limited to this# you do agree that the tobacco industry promoted the use and sale of cigarettes in the State of Florida and continues to do so/ correct?
A* A time frame*
Q. From the time that the tobacco industry first started selling cigarettes to the present.
i
A. As does any other legal corporation throughout America.
So your answer is yes/ they do that?
A. That's correct/ but that isn't the point of these documents.
Q. The point of these documents is that they/ taken together/ in your opinion/ they lead you to the conclusion that the State of Florida also promoted the sale and use of cigarettes?
A. Absolutely.
Q. Is it your opinion that the State of Florida/ .through the promotion of the sale and use of cigarettes/ actually encouraged people to smoke cigarettes?
A. Absolutely*
Q. Does that include children?
A. Willf since it could# because the State of Florida was very much concerned about promoting these products abroad# where child laws may not be applicable. So * yes# it could.
Q. Now# everything you've said about the promotional efforts of the State of Florida would also be true of the promotional efforts of the tobacco industry# correct?
A. No# it would not.	,
Q. Well/ what part would not be true of the promotional efforts of the tobacco industry that is true in your opinion of the promotional efforts of Florida# of the State of Florida?
A. Because the tobacco industry never used prison labor to manufacture cigarettes.
Q. If you pay the laborer to manufacture the cigarettes# does that — is that more or less likely to encourage people to smoke cigarettes than if you don't pay the person to manufacture the cigarettes# in your opinion?
A. I don't know what you're driving at.
I don't understand the question.
0. I guess# you know# we're both having
a problem with this. I'm trying to understand your answer. And I was trying to rephrase to figure out what you meant/ really.
What significance does it have to you that the State of Florida* in your opinion* used prisoners to manufacture tobacco?
A. Manufacture cigarettes?
Q. To manufacture cigarettes. What significance does tnat have to you?
A. I think it's significant in the sense that on the one hand the State is decrying the
%
matter of cigarette usage* promotion and consumption by tobacco companies and yet the State itself is very much involved in the same endeavor* except it doesn't pay its workers.
Q. So it sends a mixed message to the
public?
A. Absolutely.
Q. In your opinion* did the cigarette industry send a mixed message to the public?
MR. McCONNELLi Objection to scope*
MS. TYLER; Objection* vague.
A. Again* it's — it's too broad. Can you be more specific?
When you say mixed message* be more
specific.
BY MR. HOAGi
Q. Well/ when you answered the question a moment ago mixed message/ what was your understanding of the word/ of the term mixed message?
A. Z don't have an understanding.
0. How were you able to answer the last question?
A. Well/ because it was specifically related to State activities/ which X clearly defined. On the one hand/ the State is decrying the use and promotion of cigarette products by private corporations. And yet» on the other hand/ the State is involved in the same sort of process itself/ of manufacturing and selling them and giving them away. That doesn't apply to the cigarette industry. They're not involved in the same situation. So your mixed message metaphor doesn't work.
Q, Js that because the cigarette industry never had a mixed message/ the message always was to encourage as much as possible individuals to smoke as many cigarettes as possible?
MS. TYLER: Objection to form.
Foundation*
A. Cigarette industry with regard to my focus# which is one of health awareness# has argued# as we indicated# as I indicated earlier# that there are <— there is no direct cause-effect relationship in terms of smoke and cancer and that more research needs to be done. And in very recent days# the industry has admitted the smoke risks.
0. By recent days# you mean like in the last two weeks?
MS. TYLERc Objection.
A. Depends upon companies.
BY MR. HOAG:
Q. Philip Morris# in the last two weeks# is that what you mean?
A. That's correct.
Q. Any other company within the last two weeks other than Philip Morris?
A. Not to my knowledge*
0, So what other companies other than Philip Morris# in your opinion# if any tobacco companies# have changed their tune on the statement tnat it nas not t>een scientifically
proven that cigarette smoking causes any disease?
MS* LUTHERi Objection to form.
MR. McCONNELLi Objection to form.
MS. TYLERt Objection to counsel's characterisation.
A. 1 don't know the answer to that. I indicated to you in recent days for Philip Morris and 1 would stick with that answer. That's the most recent evidence*
BY MR. HOAGt
Q. That's the only one you're aware of at this point that has done that at all?
A. Remember that the plaintiffs that I am examining* their lives with regard to having quit smoking variedi but they were not until -they were earlier as opposed to being very# very recent.
So much of my awareness research ended with the lives of these plaintiffs in filing suit.
(Whereupon* Plaintiff's Exhibit Number 3 was marked for identification.)
BY MR. HOAG|
Have you ever seen Plaintiff's Exhibit 3 before?
A. We discussed each and every one of these five points/ as well as the first paragraph in the video* I never saw this until now. But we've discussed each of these.
MR. McCONNELL: Do you have an extra copy? What is that?
Oh/ never mind. Thank you.
THE WITNESS It wasn't addressed to me. It was addressed to Mr. Rosenlatt. We discussed what would be contained therein.
BY HR. HOAG:
' - i
Q. Now/ you talked about -- you earlier talked about the 4-H/ the research you did at 4-H in Washington.
You are aware that the tobacco industry or at least a tobacco company recently donated several million dollars to 4-H?
A. I'm also aware that it is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 4-H is funded by a government agency.
Q. Are you aware — is 4-H a private organization or public?
A. it's under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture/ gets its funding there. Many of the employees work for DAG/ as we call it/
in Washington* as well as 4-H.
Q» So you're saying 4-H is a government
entity?
A. It was created by the Agriculture Extension Act of 1914* It receives government funds* It also receives private contributions.
One of the biggest contributors has been Header's Digest# one of the roost vocal anti-cigarette magazines.
J.C. Penney was a big donor. In fact* as you go into the headquarters/ you will find this beautiful portrait of James Cash Penney.
Many corporations provide funds to 4-H. And the Federal Government supports it mightily.
Q. My question is: Is the 4-H a private nonprofit organization?
A. It's what we would call mixed. It'6 like the Post Office. It's like Amtrac. It has private entities/ it has public funding.
Q. And it has groups -- does it have groups in each state of the United States?
A. Yes* yes.
0. And do those groups have some autonomy such that they can refuse certain funding
if they want to?
A. I've never heard of that* ‘of the 4-H Clubs having done that* But I guess anything is possible.
Q. Do you know whether any 4-H organizations in Florida have refused to participate in the use of any funds that cone from any tobacco conpany?
A. Mot during the period of Mary Farnan'e lifer when she was a member*
Cl. Do you know if that has happened
% .
within the past year?
A. No/ 1 do not.
Q. Nowi this night be a question for* perhaps# both you and the attorneys.
The Humber 4 on this Page 1 of Plaintiff's Exhibit 3 says copies of Angela Della Vecchia's school records; copy enclosed.
MS* TYLER: i apologize/ John* I've got them right here*
MR. HOAG: The same would be true for Mary Farnan?
MS. TYLER: I'm handing you those school records right now. And I'm sorry I did not bring an additional copy.
MR. HOAGi Well# Okay. ms. TYLER: Those may not be all of her school records. You may have more school records in your hand# John.
MR* HOAGi Oh# right here# there may be more for her?
MS TYLERj There may.
(Whereupon# Plaintiff’s Exhibit Number 4 was marked for identification.)
BY MR. HOAG3
Q. Again# showing you now Plaintiff's Exhibit 4# do you recognize that?
A. Yes# sir.
0. And what is that?
A. Well# these are the transcripts of Angie Belger Della Vecchia's educational records* The first is Jamaica High School# actually it's 7th grade# 8th grade# 9th grade# and then we go to# I think# her high school records. Yes# sir.
Q. Are those all the records that you reviewed# the high school or school records of Angie Della Vecchia that you've reviewed# the ones you're looking at in Plaintiff's Exhibit 4?
A. These are the only ones I have# yes#
sir.
Now* we have some for Mary Farnan.
Q. Okay. We're going to look at those/
tOOt
When I show you the ones for Mary Farnan* if any of those happen to also include Angie Della Vecchia* you just let me know. Okay?
A. Okay.
Q. What» if any» significance do those records have to you if they relate to any of your opinions in the £ngle case? And I'm talking about Angie Della Vecchia's school records that are Plaintiff's Exhibit 4.
A. State of New York required that students be taught health classes* part of which had to be devoted to information about the serious health risk of smoking/ alcohol and narcotics. So these particular transcripts are valuable in pointing out her grades in the health classes.
Q. What is the basis for your opinion on the State of New York's requirement about what they would teach in health classes?
A. It's a very vigorous state* and we have information we've already presented to you in the first production list regarding the laws of the State of New York* the curriculum guides.
State of New York was one of the first states to mandate teaching about the adverse health effects of tobacco.
Q, Okay. What years are represented on those school records for Angie Della Vecchia?
A. For Ms. Della Vecchiar we have Ms. Angie Belger Della Vecchiar we have 1957; this ie in 7th grade; we have 1958/ she was in 8th grade; we have 1959* when she was in the 10th grade; and we have her grades for all of her classes including health classes during that time* This is page 1 *
Q. Uh-huh.
Q. Are there any years after 1959 in
there?
A. I'm going to look*
A. Yes/ we have some years on that third
page*
It's very difficult to read. But we do have the years from 1959 through '62* She did not complete schoolr as you know. She went on to Hahopackr New York. We* toot have grades as well for her classes in high school on Page 3 and 4.
Q. Okay. So it ends in 1962/ correct?
A. Yes.
Q* The first Surgeon General1© report that concluded cigarette smoking causes lung cancer in men came out in 1964* correct?
A* It didn't say just lung cancer in menr it did indicate that there was a disposition in men because women hadn't started to smoke much by then.
Q. That came out in 1964?
A. January llthr 1964.
Q* Okay. Sor now* have you seen the -the actual curricula or curriculum that was taught to Angie Della Vecchia in 1957 t '£>8r '59 through 1962 concerning cigarette smoking?
A* Yes. In fact* in the first production list we gave you the textbooks that she used in her classes.
Q. And you actually know that she read ther those specific portions of the textbook that refer to cigarette smoking?
A* We know two things. We know* one/ that there were so many books# and I'm sorry I don't have the first list here* but you have it. And/ secondly/ we know that one of those books was used in her classes during the time she was a student.
o. Did any of those books say cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?
A* These books were really in advance of the Surgeon General's report and you will note# if you examine those books# which we will do in trial# that the books were in advance of the Surgeon General's report and indicated the adverse health effects of cigarette smoking on young people.
Q. Did any of those books say cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?
MS* TYLER: Objection# asked and answered.
MR. HOAG* No* it hasn't been answered.
A. I have answered the question.
These books were in advance. They noted many maladies. And some reference# those that were published in the early 1950's* they were the studies of Winderam Graham {Phonetic.# they mention Oscar Auerbach# they mention the ACS study# which was underway# of 200#000 people. So# by 1954 the ACS had come out in a statement suggesting that indeed there was a relationship between lung cancer and —
BY HR. HOAG:
Q. Did any of those textbooks say — I will try it again — that cigarette smoking causes — causes lung cancer or any other disease?
A. In what year?
Q* Any of the years that you were referring to from 1957 through 1962 for textbooks that in your opinion were textbooks that would have been used in any class that Angie Della Vecchia attended?
A. No/ these textbooks didn't state that; nor did any other publication in those years. They indicated the risks involved in terms of certain maladies* They didn't state definitively; as you have done.
G. Did you say -- if you did/ pardon me. But did you say that you knew whether or not Angie Della Vecchia was in class when and if this was actually taught?
A. Well; we know how many days she missed; Hr. Hoag; so we can pretty much tell you whether she was right on target in terms of being there.
I960; she was -- she missed only 12 days. 1959; just five days. She had 23 days
absent in 1958* 28 days in 1957* So she was not an unusual student in terms of absence.
Q. 23 days in *57?
A. Out of 188 days* that's not bad.
Q. 28 days in '58* did you say she
missed?
A. 28.
You have -- you don't have these? I gave them to you. Here they are (Indicating). They're all there.
Q. That's like almost once a week she missed class in 1958* for example* 180 days of school* right?
A. She also got during that year very good grades in health. In fact* she got a 95 in '59* she got an 80 in 1958. She got 75 in 1957.
So during those days when she was still absent she did quite well in class.
0. Do you know the names of the teachers who taught these health courses?
A. They only give their initials* unfortunately.
Q. Do you know whether any of them were smokers?
A. Do not. But all of the teachers by
this time had to have* if they taught the classes in science or in health* had to have certification in courses in the field of evils of cigarettes' alcoholt narcotics.
Q. When you say evils off was it worded that way# the word evils?
A. No. Some elementary texts did that/ but by the time you reach high school* no. They indicated risks* dangers. In New York State you also had to pass a regent's exam before you could graduate and part of the exam was devoted to „ tobacco* narcotics and alcohol.
Q. What — what what percentage of smokers -- I mean — I'm sorry* scratch that.
What percentage of adults were smokers in New York in 1957* if you know?
A. It was probably in the range of 40 to 42 percent.
Q. Is it about the same in *58 and *59?
A. Probably about the same.
Q. How about all the way through 1962t about the same?
A. You will see that in my video* you will get some — I think I mentioned some figures there* and then it begins to decline in the early
'BO'Sf until it reaches its slow point of 25 percent by 1994.
Q. So * in your opinion# it didn't begin to decline until the early 1980's?
A. The peak year was 1981* But this was also the peak year in terms of the Baby Boomers coming of age# the population.
(Recess*)
By MR* HOAG:
Q, At the time we broke* I believe I was asking you about the percentage of people in your opinion who were smokers in New York in the period of time that Angie was in school# between 1957 and 1962.	'
A. I'm sorry. I thought you said in the
nation.
Q. Okay. Your answer was for the nation and not New York specifically?
A. Yeah* l don't know what it was for New York.
Q. You don't know whether or not any of her teachers were smokers themselves?
A* No; 1 don’t.
Q. Do you know whether or not teachers during that period of time* 1950's to early '60's
were actually allowed to smoke in the teachers's lounge?
A. I was a budding teacher then and we could smoke in the teachers lounge# yes. But I don't know New York State.
Q. Do you know whether or not the students had an area where they were allowed to smoke in New York State in the 1950's to the early I960's# high school students?
A* She* I believer referenced that in her deposition.
' . •»
Q. She referenced that they were allowed to smoke?
A. She said there was a smoking area» I believe.
Q. For students?
A* Yes.
Q. In your opinion# what kind kind of message does that send to the high school students that they're allowed to smoke cigarettes on the school premises?
A, 1 know there was a big controversy with respect to that# because I was a high school student, we used to debate that issue in debate classes.
a. You mean the issue of what kind of message it sends?
A. No/ in terms of whether young people should smoke in school.
Cl. Now# do you know whether or not the people who taught these health courses had any discretion in how they taught the course?
A. We have curricular guidelines that are in the first production list and it does give a guide. That's what we have.
Q, Do you know whether or not the ’ teachers actually followed the guide as it was written?
A. No.
G. Do you know whether or not the teachers who taught the health courses actually tested areas related to cigarette smoking in their health courses?
A* if they used the sample exams given in the curricular guides/ yes.
Q. What percentage of the total/ assuming that somebody used the sample# if they used the sample/ what percentage of the questions in the tests were questions related to smoking?
A. i don't recall now. i would have to
look at the guidelines. I don't nave them here.
Q. Nowt in the health course they had to cover more than smoking; correct?
A. Yes; sir.
Q. What were other topics that were covered?
A. Topics about nutrition; what sort Of food to eat; sleep; alcohol avoidance; drug avoidance; the importance of exercise; well-balanced meals* Necessity to eat three regular meals; things like that.	.
Q. During this period of time; I'm talking about 1957 and 1962; what kind of things were being depicted in cigarette advertisements during that period of time? In other words; were people being depicted in healthy situations smoking cigarettes?
MS. TYLER: Objection; scope; vague.
A. 1 don't know.
BY HR. HOAGi
0. would it surprise you if there were a number of cigarette advertisements that depicted healthy people having a good time as they smoked cigarettes in the 1950's and early 1960's?
A. i can think of no ad for any product
in which there wouldn't be healthy people being depicted in the ad* It16 common sense*
Q* Common sense because you want people to believe that your product is one that promotes health# correct?
MR. HOWARD: Objection to form.
MS. TYLERi objection to form.
BY MR. HOAGt
G. That's not correct?
A. 1 don't know what the question is.
Q. It's common sense# because one would want their product to be one that promotes a healthy image# certainly not one that promotes an image that this thing is going to make you sick# right?
A. All products were advertised in this
manner.
Q. Promoting an image that it would not make you sick# correct?
A. No/ I'm not an advertising expert. You're asking me to get into the minds of people who depict ads. I can tell you that# just from a layman's point of view* having observed ads# all ads try to depict people who are healthy.
Q. Now* did cigarette companies ever
hire sports figures to promote their products and/or advertise their products in the 1950's and early 1960'b?
A* Yes.
Q. And what sports figures come to mind? A. During this period Z can remember/ baseball stars like Bob Lemmon (Phonetic.)/ Earl Wynne/ little later Mickey Mantle. They used people like that*
Q* And they used people like that in ads that were full-pager in color/ correct?
A* As did other companies for other products*
Gl, When you looked at your -- I'm sorry. Withdraw the question# because it's going everywhere/ it's nowhere.
Referring to Plaintiff's Exhibit 1# turning to Page 2/ for example/ Time magazine/ — A* Uh-huh*
Q* —- did you have occasion to count how many cigarette advertisements there were in each issue of Time magazine that you looked at?
MS* TYLERs I object to this question on the grounds that it is covering old territory from the old deposition.
This exact question was asked at that time*
HR. HOAGt You can answer*
A. Well/ you asked me a question/ did I have occasion to -BY MR* HOAGt
Q, Yeah/ to count the number of cigarette advertisements in each issue of Time magazine that you looked at*
A. I had occasion to* I did not.
Q. Do you have an opinion as to whether or not a full-page color advertisement on the back page of a magazine is more likely to be seen than an article on Page 42?
A. I'm not an advertising expert. I can't answer that question.
Q. Do you know whether or not cigarette . companies ever advertised on the back pager the entire back page of magazines?
A. Again; I'm not an advertising expert.
I didn't look for that quality.
MR. HOAGt Okay. I want to have marked as Plaintiff's Exhibit 5 what I think are Mary Farnan's school records.
(Whereupon/ plaintiffs Exhibit Number 5 was marked for identification.) -
BY MR. HOAG:

is able to attain high grades.
Q. And whatr if anything* do these records indicate to you that — wellr scratch that*
Whatf if anything/ in those records has something to do with cigarette smoking?
A. Because the State of Florida* like the State of New York* did mandate that there be instruction with respect to the adverse effects of smokingr alcohol and narcotics.
