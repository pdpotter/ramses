6	***
7	EXAMINATION
8	BY MR. MANNING:
9	Q. Mr. Berman, how do you like to be addressed?
10	Professor Berman? Mr. Berman? What's your
11	preference?
12	A. It's immaterial.
13	Q. Okay.
14	Have you ever had your deposition taken before?
15	A. Yes, I have.
16	Q. How many times?
17	A. I believe once.
18	Q. When?
19	A. Oh, may have been about four, five years ago.
20	Q. What type of matter?
21	A. It was in a case having to do with a -- workers
22	suing the -- the United Food and Chemical --
23	Commercial Workers Union for not carrying through
24	contract negotiations that would allow them to be
2	5 promoted.
1	Q. Did you testify as an expert?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. In what capacity?
4	A. Capacity as a labor historian.
5	Q. As a labor historian?
6	A. As a labor historian.
7	Q. You did not testify in that case as an awareness
8	expert?
9	A. No.
10	Q. And is that the only other time that you've
11	testified as an expert, to your knowledge?
12	A. Maybe three, four times.
13	Q. You have testified?
14	A. Testified -- oh, testified twice. Actually in a
15	court of law.
16	Q. Okay. Let me back up, then.
17	There have been times you've testified in a
18	court of law where you have not given a deposition?
19	A. Where I have not given deposition?
20	Q. As I understand what you told me is you've given
21	one deposition.
22	A. I've given one deposition which did not lead to
23	my testifying, yes.
24	Q. Okay.
25	A. The -- I testified in two matters in which I did
1	not give depositions.
2	Q. What were those?
3	A. One had to do with the question of whether, in
4	fact, the Minnesota State Constitution prohibited --
5	in its lottery prohibition provision prohibited the
6	Canterber- -- then called Canterbury Downs from
7	having on-track betting.
8	Q. Who did you testify -- on whose behalf?
9	A. Canterbury Downs.
10	Q. In what capacity did you testify?
11	A. As a Minnesota historian.
12	Q. And as a legislative historian?
13	A. Minnesota historian in general, with knowledge
14	of the Minnesota Constitution.
15	Q. Okay. What year was that?
16	A. That's -- to the best of my recollection, that
17	was about four years ago. Five years ago.
18	Q. Who were the lawyers in that case?
19	A. It was the Popham firm.
20	Q. That's who you worked with?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Who did you work with in the labor case, the
23	United Foods --
24	A. The labor case I don't recall. It was a
25	St. Paul firm, but I don't recall the particular
1	firm.
2	Q. Okay. Now there was another time that you gave
3	testimony, --
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. -- that you didn't give a deposition?
6	A. That is correct. That was in a case having to
7	do with the -- the right of the State of Minnesota to
8	pass legislation prohibiting the use of -- the --
9	prohibiting permanent replacement workers in times of
10	strikes.
11	Q. And who did you testify for?
12	A. Testified for the state of Minnesota. Well,
13	actually testified for -- in that case for the
14	Teamsters Joint Council, but...
15	Q. For the Teamsters Joint Council?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. Okay. What law firm?
18	A. The law firm of Steve Gordon.
19	Q. Okay. When was that testimony?
20	A. That was, oh, about three or four years ago, I'd
21	say.
22	Q. Do you recall what court that was? Ramsey?
23	A. Yes, it was Ramsey County.
24	Q. Do you recall what judge?
25	A. Yes, a Larry Cohen.
1	Q. Did the case go to a jury?
2	A. No. It was in front of a judge.
3	Q. In front of a judge.
4	How about the other case involving Canterbury,
5	did it go to a jury or judge?
6	A. Judge.
7	Q. What judge, do you recall?
8	A. I don't recall the judge.
9	Q. Do you recall what venue, Hennepin County?
10	A. Ramsey, as well.
11	Q. Ramsey, as well.
12	How about the venue of your other deposition?
13	A. Oh, I really don't recall what the venue of that
14	one was. I assume it was Ramsey County because the
15	deposition was taken in St. Paul.
16	Q. Okay. All right. So I've counted three times
17	you've testified under oath? Two in court and one in
18	deposition?
19	A. One deposition, twice in court, yes.
20	Q. Anything else?
21	A. In terms of -- of affidavits? One case in which
22	I gave an affidavit, which was in fact cited by the
23	Appellate Court in a decision which will be released
24	this Tuesday.
25	Q. What case is that?
1	A. That is a case which we euphemistically call
2	"Never on Sunday." The Sunday closing law having to
3	do with the Auto Dealers Association.
4	Q. Is that a Minnesota Supreme Court case that's
5	about to be issued?
6	A. That's an Appellate Court.
7	Q. Appellate Court.
8	And you know it's about to be issued and you're
9	cited in it?
10	A. Yes. In fact, I received a copy of it on
11	Friday.
12	Q. Okay. What's the name of the case?
13	A. That's -- there may be others, but I don't
14	recall. I really don't recall.
15	Q. To your recollection are these the four times
16	that you have --
17	A. To my recollection these are the four times.
18	And to my recollection these are the only four
19	times. But I may be mistaken.
20	Q. I understand.
21	Testifying as an expert is something recent in
22	your career; is that right?
23	A. Within the last ten years.
24	Q. Okay. Well, most of these have occurred within
25	the last five years, is that not right?
1	A. Five to ten. I may be off by a few years, but
2	within -- let's say, to be on the safe side, within
3	the last ten years.
4	Q. Now this morning you believe that you are here
5	as an awareness expert; correct?
6	A. No.
7	Q. You don't -- you don't believe that?
8	A. No. I'm not here as an awareness expert.
9	Q. Okay. And you are not aware that you have been
10	announced in this case, by lawyers who are working
11	for the tobacco companies, as an awareness expert,
12	that's new to you?
13	A. I'm a historian.
14	Q. The question is: Are you aware that you have
15	been announced as an awareness expert?
16	A. No, I am not aware of that.
17	Q. Nobody's ever told you that before?
18	A. No.
19	Q. So you are not here in any way, shape, or form
20	to talk about awareness?
21	A. Oh yes, sorry.
22	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form of the
23	question.
24	THE WITNESS: That is not the question you
25	asked. You asked if I'm an awareness expert.
1	BY MR. MANNING:
2	Q. We can get into that. Okay.
3	And you're not an awareness expert?
4	A. No. I'm a historian that dealt with the
5	question of awareness.
6	Q. I see.
7	Sir, as a result of your work in this case have
8	you arrived at some opinions?
9	A. Yes, I have.
10	Q. Please tell me each and every one of those.
11	A. Pardon me?
12	Q. Please tell me each and every one of those
13	opinions that you've arrived at as a result of your
14	work in this case. I want you to list them. What
15	are your opinions?
16	A. Well, I think they are listed in the report.
17	And I can summarize that, if you wish, but it's
18	certainly listed in the report.
19	Q. I've read your report, sir, in some detail, it's
2	0 forty some pages. And it does -- I won't attempt to
21	characterize it. Some historical analysis, you might
22	say, even though some may differ with that. But it
23	doesn't list your opinions.
24	A. Sorry?
25	Q. It does not list opinions.
1	MR. PURVIS: I object to the question of
2	counsel. Characterization of the report.
3	BY MR. MANNING:
4	Q. Are you saying, sir, that all of your opinions
5	are contained in your report?
6	A. My opinions regarding the findings, historical
7	findings, are in that report. Whether all are in
8	that report, I couldn't say.
9	Q. You can't tell me, as you sit here today, as you
10	arrive to testify in your deposition in this case,
11	whether that report contains all of your opinions
12	that you intend to give in this case?
13	A. It is the bulk of the opinions that I intend to
14	give in this case.
15	Q. What opinions do you have that are not contained
16	in the report?
17	A. I have no additional ones to add at this point;
18	however, they may come up in further research.
19	Q. Now, when is the very first time that you were
20	contacted by anybody on behalf of the tobacco
21	companies to testify for the tobacco companies?
22	A. I believe it was in the late fall or early
23	winter of 1995.
24	Q. Who contacted you?
25	A. It was Dr. Ellen Fitzgerald.
1	Q. Who is she?
2	A. She is the Executive Director of the University
3	Research Consortium.
4	Q. What did she say to you?
5	A. She asked me whether I'd be interested in doing
6	some historical research in Minnesota history.
7	Q. Did she explain what topic?
8	A. Pardon me?
9	Q. Did she explain what topic?
10	A. Not initially.
11	Q. Okay. Did she explain who you would be working
12	for?
13	A. She mentioned that it was in connection with the
14	Attorney General's case, yes.
15	Q. And she mentioned that she had been contacted by
16	the tobacco companies?
17	A. No.
18	Q. Who did she mention she had been contacted by?
19	A. She had been contacted by Dorsey & Whitney.
20	Q. Tell me everything she said to you in your first
21	conversation. Was it by phone?
22	A. Pardon me?
23	Q. Was it by phone, your first conversation?
24	A. No.
25	Q. Tell me, was it a meeting in her office?
1	A. No.
2	Q. Your office?
3	A. No.
4	Q. Where was the meeting at?
5	A. We met inadvertently at the Campus Club,
6	University of Minnesota.
7	Q. So it was not a pre-arranged meeting?
8	A. It was not a pre-arranged meeting.
9	Q. So there you were inadvertently at the
10	Campus Club?
11	A. I was not there inadvertently.
12	Q. You met inadvertently?
13	A. That's correct.
14	Q. And what was the conversation between the two of
15	you in its entirety?
16	A. Well, it's a couple of years, so let me try to
17	reconstruct it as best I can.
18	Q. Please do.
19	A. Pardon me?
20	Q. Please do.
21	A. She asked me whether I'd be interested in
22	working with the University Research Consortium on a
23	historical topic having to do with Minnesota history
24	in connection the Attorney General's case. I said
25	I'd have to know more about it.
1	That's the essence of the conversation at the
2	Campus Club.
3	Q. That's all you can remember about that
4	conversation?
5	A. That's all I can remember of that conversation,
6	yes.
7	Q. What was the next conversation you had with
8	anybody on the topic of being an expert?
9	A. About a week later, approximately, could have
10	been a few days, but a week or so later
11	Dr. Fitzgerald called me and asked me whether I'd be
12	willing to meet with the attorneys from Dorsey &
13	Whitney and other attorneys in connection with this
14	request of her, of me, of course. I said I'm willing
15	to meet with anyone.
16	Q. That was a phone conversation?
17	A. That was a phone conversation.
18	Q. What is her title again, the Executive Director
19	of the University --
20	A. Research Consortium.
21	Q. What does that mean to you? What does she do,
22	do you know?
23	A. She, in fact, runs the University Research
24	Consortium.
25	Q. What is the University Research Consortium as
1	you understand it?
2	A. The University Research Consortium is a
3	consortium of researchers, faculty members, at the
4	University of Minnesota, organized in this group for
5	the purpose of stimulating and sponsoring -- or
6	stimulating and developing sponsored research.
7	Q. How many professors are a part of it?
8	A. I have no idea. Quite a few. The number, I
9	couldn't say.
10	Q. Have you been a part of it for a number of
11	years?
12	A. I joined the University Research Consortium
13	after Ellen Fitzgerald approached me on this
14	particular instance.
15	Q. What did you need to do to join?
16	A. Pay dues.
17	Q. How many dues do you pay?
18	A. One hundred twenty-five dollars. I'm not sure
19	whether it's annually or every couple of years. But
20	it's -- the payment was a hundred twenty-five dollars
21	at the time.
22	Q. Is there anything else that you pay to them as a
23	result of your work --
24	A. No.
25	Q. -- when they obtain the work for you, so to
1	speak?
2	A. No. They act as the agent, so to speak; in this
3	case, billing, and other kinds of activities of that
4	kind.
5	Q. So they actually act as the agent by way of
6	billing?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. And do they obtain a fee for that, to your
9	knowledge?
10	A. I believe so.
11	Q. And do they obtain a percentage of that fee?
12	A. I don't know exactly what they receive.
13	Q. No idea?
14	A. No.
15	I mean I could find out, but I don't know.
16	Q. Okay. All you know is you get a check from
17	them?
18	A. That is correct.
19	Q. And you then don't get your check from Dorsey or
20	any other law firms, or the tobacco companies
21	themselves?
22	A. That is correct.
23	Q. And do you know who she gets her checks from?
24	Does she get them from the various law firms? Or
25	does she get them from the various tobacco companies?
1	A. She gets them from the law firms, it's my
2	understanding.
3	Q. You've asked her that?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. And do you know whether this is a profit center
6	for the University of Minnesota? Do you know how
7	it's run?
8	A. No.
9	Q. You don't know?
10	A. No, I don't.
11	Q. Okay. How many people are on the staff of
12	Dr. Ellen Fitzgerald, do you know?
13	A. I believe she is the only person on the staff.
14	Q. And do you know the impetus for the program?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. What is that?
17	A. Again, it's my understanding, I wasn't there at
18	the beginning, for the simple reason that historians
19	are never thought of as being lucrative moneymakers
20	in this kind of research. But at the beginning, some
21	five or six years ago, a number of faculty members,
22	regents, professors, from areas of science, medicine,
23	technology, and the hard social sciences, got
24	together to form this group to foster sponsored
25	research.
1	Q. To foster sponsored research?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Is that correct?
4	A. That is correct.
5	Q. And so this organization to foster sponsored
6	research -- it wants to then do research in an
7	objective manner; correct?
8	A. Absolutely.
9	Q. It does not want to be bought in its research?
10	A. That's absolutely correct.
11	Q. It wants to retain an air of objectivity such as
12	is present in the academic institution that's
13	committed to academic freedom?
14	A. Absolutely.
15	Q. And that's your understanding of this
16	organization?
17	A. That is correct.
18	Q. And that's the only basis on which you would
19	participate?
20	A. Absolutely.
21	Q. And the only way you would participate is if you
22	can render an objective opinion that wasn't bought?
23	A. Absolutely.
24	Q. You do not want to be a hired gun or present
25	only a bought opinion?
1	A. Not in the least.
2	Q. And you want to make sure that when you testify
3	that you look at all sides of every issue?
4	A. Absolutely.
5	Q. And you want to demand a full and complete
6	information before you would render a historical
7	opinion?
8	A. Absolutely.
9	Q. Because to do so, would be less than academic?
10	A. That's correct.
11	Q. It would be less than professional?
12	A. That is correct.
13	Q. And if you found that you did less so, that you
14	yourself, as an academic, did less so, you would
15	admit it?
16	A. Of course.
17	Q. And if you found that you did so, you would back
18	away from opinions you gave and say "I was wrong"?
19	A. If you read my report, it says that these are
20	tentative, subject to further research.
21	Q. We'll talk about your report in great detail.
22	A. But I'm answering your question --
2	3	Q. Thank you.
24	A. -- in that way. That is, in fact, the way we
25	operate, yes.
1	Q. Whether it's this report, -2	A. Or any one.
3	Q. -- this assignment, or any assignment?
4	A. Exactly.
5	Q. So when you testify in a case, you don't feel
6	"I'm taking sides." You're saying, "I'm going to
7	render an objective historical opinion, taking all
8	information into account that may be relevant in this
9	historical analysis"?
10	A. That is absolutely correct.
11	Q. And you are not going to let someone else define
12	that historical analysis for you as an academic;
13	you're going to define it yourself?
14	A. Absolutely.
15	Q. Because that's what you've done in the period of
16	your life as a historian, is you're the one that
17	defines the parameters; correct?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. The paradigm is yours?
2	0 A. Uh-huh.
21	Q. Okay. Now you, of course, would never lie to a
22	Court; correct?
23	A. I'm under oath.
24	Q. I understand.
25	A. I would never lie, not only because I'm under
1	oath, but I would not even if I was not under oath.
2	I would never lie, no.
3	Q. And you would never support lies?
4	A. No.
5	Q. You would not render testimony that was
6	supportive of lying?
7	A. That is correct.
8	Q. And if you found that you were doing so, you
9	would have the integrity to stand up and speak about
10	it?
11	A. Sure.
12	Q. Now, let's talk about your report.
13	A. Okay.
14	Q. Do you have it with you?
15	A. No, I do not.
16	Q. All right. I'll give you a copy.
17	(Exhibit 3135 marked for identification.)
18	BY MR. MANNING:
19	Q. Before we get into your report, sir, let's back
20	up a little bit and finish the history or the story
21	of your involvement here.
22	Now, we were on the second phone call.
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. Second contact with Ellen Fitzgerald and that
25	was completed, and now a meeting with lawyers was
1	arranged?
2	A. Uh-huh.
3	Q. Where did the next -- did we exhaust that phone
4	call? Anything else said in it by her or you?
5	A. I think it was during that phone call that she
6	explained, I think, what the historical question that
7	was to be researched.
8	Q. What did she explain?
9	A. In essence, I think she said that the -- that
10	the interest is in doing research as to the -- as to
11	what the people of Minnesota knew regarding the
12	health hazards of smoking, and how they knew it, and
13	when they knew it. That's, I think, how she defined
14	it at the time.
15	Q. Did you take notes of that conversation?
16	A. No, I did not.
17	Q. And how else -- what else was said, please?
18	A. That was about the -- the extent of it.
19	Q. Did you ask questions about that?
20	A. Yes, I did. I asked questions about that. But
21	I don't recall the specifics of what questions I
22	asked.
23	Q. No recollection of what you said?
24	A. No. I just recall the general conversation.
25	Q. Now, did you understand that that was going to
1	be your assignment, how she defined it?
2	A. I believe that that was going to be generally
3	what the research topic that I would be asked to do,
4	yes.
5	Q. Now, as a matter of principle if the research
6	topic was too narrow you yourself, as the expert,
7	would redefine it; correct?
8	A. Oh no. I would define the topic, of course.
9	But the general, overall question could be defined by
10	the -- by the sponsor.
11	Q. But if the overall general question was defined
12	too narrowly by the sponsor, you, as the
13	professional, would tell them that their question --
14	A. Absolutely.
15	Q. -- was too narrow?
16	A. Absolutely.
17	Q. And you would assist them in redefining it?
18	A. Yes. Or withdraw.
19	Q. Correct.
20	And you would particularly assist them in
21	redefining it if it was defined so narrow as to
22	render your opinion not accurate?
23	A. Uh-huh.
24	Q. Correct?
25	A. Yeah.
1	Q. Or if it made your historical analysis so narrow
2	that it didn't take into account some of the most
3	important data? You would withdraw?
4	A. Certainly.
5	Q. Now you can't cite me an example of when you've
6	done that before, can you?
7	A. No.
8	Q. And you didn't do that in this case, did you?
9	A. No.
10	Q. Now, after that phone conversation, you had a
11	meeting with the lawyers?
12	A. That is correct.
13	Q. Where did that take place?
14	A. If I'm not mistaken, this very room.
15	Q. And who was present?
16	A. About a dozen lawyers from different firms, from
17	this firm here and from others, as well.
18	Q. Lawyers from all over the country?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Do you think there were about a dozen there?
21	A. About a dozen. Maybe ten, maybe fourteen. You
22	know, roughly that.
23	Q. And did they introduce themselves as
24	representing various tobacco companies?
25	A. Yes.
1	Q. You had full knowledge of that at that time?
2	A. Absolutely, yes.
3	Q. And you knew that you were working for the
4	tobacco companies?
5	A. No. I knew I was working for the lawyers who
6	were working for the tobacco companies.
7	Q. Correct. But you knew that the tobacco
8	companies were paying the lawyers; correct?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And you knew that the tobacco companies were
11	going to pay the University of Minnesota Research
12	Consortium?
13	A. They would pay the lawyers, the lawyers would
14	pay the consortium. Yes, I knew that.
15	Q. And that money would come to you?
16	A. That is correct.
17	Q. And so you had full knowledge, at least at that
18	time, if not before, that the money that would
19	ultimately come into your pocket would come from the
20	tobacco companies?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Now at that meeting -- how long did the meeting
23	take?
24	A. Approximately an hour, I'd say.
25	Q. What was discussed?
1	A. Well, essentially what was discussed was the
2	issue of what they were interested in my doing and my
3	response to that particular general question.
4	Q. Tell me everything about that, that you can
5	remember.
6	MR. PURVIS: I'm going to object and caution
7	Professor Berman that the details of conversations
8	with counsel are privileged and are not to be
9	discussed in this deposition.
10	BY MR. MANNING:
11	Q. So the meeting --
12	MR. MANNING: So are you instructing the witness
13	not to answer?
14	MR. PURVIS: I'm cautioning him at this point.
15	And if you ask a question which calls for privileged
16	information to be discussed, I will so instruct.
17	MR. MANNING: Okay.
18	BY MR. MANNING:
19	Q. You were there for about an hour?
2	0 A. About an hour.
21	Q. What did you say? What do you recall that you
22	said in that meeting?
23	A. To the best of my recollection I asked
24	questions. And I did say -- I do remember this --
25	that I'm coming into this with a bias.
1	Q. What was that?
2	A. I hoped that the plaintiffs win.
3	Q. Why is that?
4	A. I, too, believed that there was, in fact, a
5	strong case from the public -- I didn't do any
6	research on this -- from the public information
7	regarding the complicity of the tobacco companies and
8	the health questions, yes.
9	Q. You believed that?
10	A. Pardon?
11	Q. You believed that when you came to the meeting?
12	A. Right.
13	Q. Before you walked in the door?
14	A. That is correct.
15	Q. And you announced that in the meeting?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. What else did you say in that meeting?
18	A. I said that I would be very interested in
19	looking at preliminary evidence regarding the
20	historical questions and then make up my mind whether
21	I would take on this assignment after seeing that.
22	Q. So you wanted to look at preliminary evidence?
23	A. That is to say I wanted to read some general
24	materials, the -- well, the basic complaint, and the
25	materials that -- general accounts of the various
1	issues. And I wanted to do some preliminary research
2	myself before agreeing to accept the position.
3	Q. Okay. What did they say? What was said when
4	you announced that you had a bias for the
5	plaintiffs?
6	MR. PURVIS: I am going to object and instruct
7	Professor Berman that this calls for privileged
8	communications, and direct him not to answer.
9	Further, it's my understanding that there is a
10	general agreement among counsel that the details of
11	conversations with counsel would not be inquired
12	into.
13	I just want to see if that's your
14	understanding.
15	MR. MANNING: You instruct according to the
16	Court Order, counsel.
17	If you want to talk about this off the record,
18	I'll talk about it. Otherwise let's proceed with the
19	deposition.
20	I assume you're aware with the most recent Court
21	Order. If you're not, I'll discuss it with you at a
22	break.
23	BY MR. MANNING:
24	Q. Did you receive any materials to read during
25	that meeting?
1	A.	Yes.
2	Q.	What did you receive?
3	A.	I received the original complaint, the
4	Attorney General's complaint.
5	Q.	Did you read it before the meeting?
6	A.	No. After the meeting.
7	Q.	Okay. What else did you receive in that
8	meeting?
9	A.	Nothing at that particular point.
10	Q.	That's all you had?
11	A.	From that meeting, yes.
12	Q.	And did you articulate your bias any further
13	than	what you've explained to me?
14	A.	No.
15	Q.	Pardon me?
16	A.	No.
17	Q.	That's all?
18	A.	That's all.
19	Q.	What exactly did you say about your bias?
20	A.	Just that I'm coming into this with a bias
21	that	-- for the plaintiff, period.
22	Q.	Did you explain why?
23	A.	Yes.
24	Q.	Why?
25	A.	I said that I, too, believed popular view that
1	the tobacco companies are culpable, period.
2	Q. And why did you say that?
3	A. I assume you would know why I would say
4	that. General --
5	Q. No.
6	A. The general climate of opinion is that -- in
7	that direction, obviously.
8	Q. That's your view?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And that was your view at the time in 1995?
11	A. At the time, yes.
12	Q. General view or the popular view?
13	A. Right.
14	Q. What was the reason that you said that, you as
15	an individual?
16	A. I wanted the attorneys to know where I'm coming
17	from.
18	Q. Why were you coming from that direction? You as
19	an individual?
20	A. Well, very simply, I come at it the same way
21	that other people without -- at first, at that point,
22	without general knowledge, and specific knowledge of
23	it, and that is from the press accounts and the
24	historical development of culture and experience that
25	lead one to this kind of bias.
1	Q. What else did you receive besides the original
2	complaint in that meeting then?
3	A. That's it.
4	Q. And --
5	A. To the best of my recollection, that was it.
6	Q. Did you then agree to have a second meeting?
7	A. I believe that was the only meeting we had, yes.
8	Q. You didn't have another meeting after you did
9	your preliminary research?
10	A. Not with the lawyers.
11	Q. Who -- what was the next meeting you had with
12	anybody after that meeting with lawyers?
13	A. None. I had no meeting before it was -- I had
14	no meeting, no.
15	Q. No meetings with anybody?
16	A. No.
17	Q. Did you have any telephone conversations?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. With who?
20	A. With Ellen Fitzgerald.
21	Q. Anyone else?
22	A. Pardon me?
23	Q. Anyone else?
24	A. No. That was it.
25	Q. Was she talking to the lawyers?
1	A. I assume she was.
2	Q. She was the go between?
3	A. I assume she was.
4	Q. How many times did you talk to her?
5	A. A few. I couldn't say what it was. It was more
6	than one. Fewer than five.
7	Q. After your meeting with the lawyers did you
8	report to her about what happened?
9	A. She was present.
10	Q. She was present at the meeting --
11	A. That's correct.
12	Q. -- with the lawyers?
13	A. That's correct.
14	Q. What did she say in the meeting?
15	A. I don't recall. I don't think she said
16	anything. But I don't recall.
17	Q. After the meeting you met with her alone, either
18	by telephone or in person?
19	A. By telephone. By telephone.
20	Q. What did you say in that first phone
21	conversation about your meeting with the lawyers?
22	A. I don't think she said anything about the
23	meeting.
24	Q. What did you say?
25	A. She wanted to know whether I -- this was whether
1	I agreed to accept the assignment.
2	Q. She was at the meeting?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And she knew whether you agreed or not to --
5	A. No, I didn't agree at the meeting at all.
6	Q. So in the next phone conversation who initiates
7	it, you or her?
8	A. She did.
9	Q. And how long after the meeting with the lawyers?
10	A. Maybe a week or two afterwards.
11	Q. And what did you say to her?
12	A. I said that I've examined the historical
13	material, that I had gone to the library to look at.
14	And I'm convinced that there is in fact a viable
15	research topic there and I'd be willing to do it.
16	Q. So in one week or two weeks after your meeting
17	with the lawyers you agreed to take the assignment?
18	A. That is correct.
19	Q. And you agreed to take the assignment as it had
20	been defined to you by Ellen Fitzgerald?
21	A. No.
22	Q. As it had been defined to you in your meetings
23	with the lawyers?
24	A. No.
25	Q. As it had been refined by you --
1	A. That is correct.
2	Q. -- in one week?
3	A. That is correct.
4	Q. In one week or two?
5	A. In one week or two, yes.
6	Q. In that one week or two exactly what did you do?
7	A. I read quite a few general accounts of the -- of
8	the tobacco industry. Of the issues of -- of public
9	health. These are just general accounts. And looked
10	at some newspaper -- back files of newspapers at
11	Wilson Library. And came to the conclusion that
12	there was, in fact, a viable research project in this
13	particular question.
14	Q. Now do you have a file on this, sir?
15	A. Pardon me?
16	Q. Do you have a file? Did you maintain a file on
17	this case?
18	A. Not on this, no.
19	Q. You don't maintain a file on this matter?
20	A. Not really. I'm probably the most disorganized
21	person in the world. I don't maintain files.
22	Q. So what you're telling this jury is that you
23	cannot go back to your office and show them what you
24	did from the time of your meeting with the lawyers
25	and Ellen Fitzgerald, until the time that you agreed
1	to take the assignment, you can't tell us what you
2	read?
3	A. I could roughly tell you, but I can't tell you
4	on the basis of any kind of written kind of --
5	Q. And you can't go find it for us? You can't
6	reconstruct it? You don't have notes that say these
7	are the five, the ten, the twenty articles I read; is
8	that correct?
9	A. I can reconstruct it from memory. But I can't
10	do it from any kind of...
11	Q. Tell me then, from memory.
12	A. From memory.
13	Q. That's the only way you can do it? You can't go
14	back to your office and do it; is that right?
15	A. Not at all.
16	Q. Do you have a file on this back at your office?
17	A. Not at all.
18	Q. You have no file?
19	A. Not at all.
20	Q. So you're telling me the only thing you have is
21	this report? Did you keep a copy?
22	A. Oh no. I have six file drawers of documents and
23	materials. But I have no -- no -- no written notes
24	and files of that kind.
25	Q. Six file drawers of -- of materials related to
1	this report?
2	A. That is correct.
3	Q. Okay. And in those six file drawers are some,
4	if not all of the documents that you reviewed in
5	those first two weeks; correct?
6	A. Probably.
7	Q. And so if we had those here you could go through
8	and be much more accurate than your memory by showing
9	me which ones you reviewed in that first week or two
10	weeks; correct?
11	A. Oh, I could do that, yes. But -- but, again, it
12	would not be fully accurate because my memory may not
13	be able to reconstruct everything.
14	Q. No, I understand. But your memory, you would
15	agree with me, is likely better looking at all of
16	those documents in the six file drawers and picking
17	them, than it is doing it here from complete memory
18	alone?
19	A. That is correct.
2	0	MR. MANNING: Okay. Counsel, you had an
21	obligation to bring those six file drawers. You
22	should be able to do that right now. So I expect
23	that --
24	THE WITNESS: Actually I could do it by looking
25	at the bibliography.
1	MR. MANNING: Hold on.
2	So I expect that that be done by end of lunch,
3	or tomorrow morning, or we're not going to obviously
4	be able to finish the deposition.
5	MR. PURVIS: It will not be done because we have
6	provided to you the documents Professor Berman has
7	relied on. They are cited in his expert report, and
8	he has reviewed, as stated in his expert report,
9	hundreds of thousands of other documents and pages,
10	which he is not relying on, otherwise they would have
11	been cited in his report.
12	MR. MANNING: What documents are you referring
13	to, counsel, that you provided me? The documents
14	you provided me this morning?
15	MR. PURVIS: The ones that are cited in the
16	report are the documents that he is relying on.
17	MR. MANNING: What documents are you referring
18	to that you provided me? So the record is clear. Is
19	that the documents that are about a half-inch thick
20	right here?
21	MR. PURVIS: No. The ones that are cited in his
22	report are the documents that he is relying on.
23	MR. MANNING: But you understand that you
24	haven't provided those to me? So you're not
25	misstating for the record.
1	MR. PURVIS: I don't believe there's an
2	obligation, under the record, for us to provide
3	documents at this time.
4	MR. MANNING: That's fine.
5	BY MR. MANNING:
6	Q. From your memory -- now these six file drawers,
7	they're right over here at the University of
8	Minnesota in your office?
9	A. No, they are not.
10	Q. Where are they, in your house?
11	A. That is correct.
12	Q. Where is your house?
13	A. Minneapolis.
14	Q. Whereabouts?
15	A. West Bank.
16	Q. So it's close?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. And you have an office there?
19	A. I wouldn't call it an office, no.
20	Q. It's where you work?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. It's where these six file drawers are?
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. And in those six file drawers you believe are
25	most, if not all of the documents that you reviewed
1	in that first week or two?
2	A. I would think so.
3	Q. From memory, what did you review in that first
4	week or two before agreeing to take this assignment?
5	A. I read "The Social History of Tobacco" by
6	Robert Sobel.
7	Q. Robert Soho?
8	A. Sobel.
9	Q. S-O- --
10	A. If you want, -- it's cited here in the
11	bibliography.
12	Q. All right.
13	A. I looked at some articles having to do with --
14	oh, I reviewed the -- the surgeon general's reports.
15	Q. How many?
16	A. The '64 one primarily.
17	I reviewed a number of --
18	Q. Let's be clear.
19	You reviewed the surgeon general's '64 report?
2	0 A. '64 report.
21	Q. Did you review any other ones?
22	A. Not at that particular time.
2	3	Q. Thank you.
24	Go ahead.
25	A. Some articles and various different journals,
1	but most particularly in the consumer reports of the
2	1940s and '50s, and the Reader's Digest of the
3	1950s. That's to the best of my recollection.
4	Q. Okay. So "The Social History of Tobacco" by
5	Robert Sobel. Surgeon general's report of '64. Some
6	articles in journals on what?
7	A. On -- essentially on the health risks of
8	tobacco, yes.
9	Q. Okay. You don't recall how many, or what year,
10	or any of those details?
11	A. Ranging in time frame from the '30s through the
12	'60s.
13	Q. '30s through '60s.
14	A. And the number I couldn't say.
15	Q. And then some Reader's Digest articles?
16	A. Well, the Reader's Digest articles would, of
17	course, be included in that '30s to '60s.
18	Q. Okay. Anything else?
19	A. There may be others, but that's about it.
20	Q. At that point in time, then, you agreed to work
21	for the tobacco companies?
22	A. No.
23	Q. Work for the lawyers?
24	A. That is correct.
25	Q. But ultimately always with the full and complete
1	knowledge that the money that would go into your
2	pocket would be from the tobacco companies?
3	A. That is correct.
4	Q. Okay. So you then agreed to do that?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. Did you call Ellen Fitzgerald and tell her?
7	A. No. She called me.
8	Q. She wanted to know the answer?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. Did she tell you the lawyers were calling her?
11	A. No.
12	Q. Okay. What did you tell her?
13	A. I told her that it's a viable research project,
14	that I'd be willing to do it, yes.
15	Q. Did you tell her the -- what was the research
16	project now, as you understood it?
17	A. As I understand the research project, it was to
18	ask the question of the -- the extent to which the
19	knowledge of health risks of smoking were known by
20	the people of Minnesota over the years. And the
21	means by which they knew them.
22	And a secondary kind of question came as to the
23	public policy that was involved in and around the
24	issue of health and smoking.
25	Q. What was the public policy issue?
1	A. The question of what in fact -- the legislative
2	or executive actions taken by the State over time.
3	Q. And that was the question?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. And you were now comfortable researching that
6	question?
7	A. I was comfortable with that question, yes.
8	Q. And you did not determine that that question was
9	too narrow?
10	A. No.
11	Q. You did not determine that that question was --
12	would lead to an opinion that wasn't objective?
13	A. No.
14	Q. And your bias that you had walked into the room
15	with here -- right here that we're in, on the
16	fourteenth floor of the Dorsey law firm, two weeks
17	before that call, was now gone after you had reviewed
18	these materials?
19	A. On that particular issue it was, in fact, in
20	question.
21	Q. So now your bias was no longer a bias. Now you
22	were neutral?
23	A. That is correct.
24	Q. So in two weeks, after this reading that you've
25	described to me, you're back to neutral?
1	A.	That's correct. On that particular question.
2	Q.	On this particular question --
3	A.	That's correct.
4	Q.	-- that you've articulated, which is: To
5	understand the knowledge of the health risks of
6	smoking by Minnesotans and the means by which they
7	knew; correct?
8	A.	That's correct.
9	Q.	I've correctly articulated the question?
10	A.	Yes.
11	Q.	Now, you then embarked on further research on
12	that	question?
13	A.	Yes.
14	Q.	Correct?
15	A.	Yes.
16	Q.	And that resulted in you writing this report?
17	A.	That's correct.
18	Q.	Did you write this report in its entirety?
19	A.	Yes, I did.
20	Q.	Pardon me?
21	A.	Yes, I did.
22	Q.	Did you send drafts of it to anybody?
23	A.	No.
24	Q.	Never?
25	A.	Never.
1	Q.	No one else had any input into this report?
2	A.	Oh yes.
3	Q.	Tell me about that.
4	A.	My research assistants.
5	Q.	Who were they?
6	A.	David Ryden and Michael Zis.
7	Q.	Z-I- --
8	A.	Z-I-S.
9	Q.	And David Ryden?
10	A.	Ryden. R-Y-D-E-N.
11	Q.	Are they students in the History Department at
12	the U?
13	A.	David is and Michael is a student in political
14	science.
15	Q.	Ph.D candidates?
16	A.	Yes.
17	Q.	Are you their advisor?
18	A.	No.
19	Q.	Do they still work for you?
20	A.	Yes.
21	Q.	How long have they worked for you?
22	A.	For approximately a year and a half, I'd say.
23	Q.	Did they assist you in the writing of this
24	report?
25	A.	Yes.
1	Q. Who would you say wrote the bulk of the report
2	between the three --
3	A. I did.
4	Q. -- between the three of you?
5	A. I did.
6	Q. Who wrote the first draft of the report?
7	A. Both Michael and David put together a --
8	independently of each other, a first draft, which I
9	reviewed.
10	Q. You did not put together independently a first
11	draft?
12	A. No, I did not.
13	Q. You took their two first drafts?
14	A. (Nodding.)
15	Q. Did you review them?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. Each?
18	A. Together. Yes.
19	Q. Had they been put together, so to speak? Had
20	they taken their --
21	A. No.
22	Q. -- two drafts --
23	A. Each. But I reviewed them at the same time.
24	Q. Okay. How long was each report?
25	A. In what sense, how long?
1	Q. Pages.
2	A. Oh, approximately a dozen.
3	Q. Each had approximately a dozen pages?
4	A. Approximately. Maybe less. Maybe a little bit
5	more.
6	Q. You took those two reports, each a dozen pages,
7	approximately, and put them together in your ultimate
8	report?
9	A. Modifying them, I put them together, yes.
10	Q. Modified?
11	A. Modified -- I used them as a basis for further
12	development of the report, yes.
13	Q. Okay. So you edited their work?
14	A. Added to it, as well.
15	Q. And you added to it?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. How much time did they spend in reading and
18	research, to your knowledge?
19	A. Quite a -- quite a lot.
20	Q. What was that?
21	A. Hundreds of hours.
22	Q. Do you have records of that?
23	A. I do not, no.
24	Q. Do they?
25	A. I believe they may.
1	Q. They got paid for their time?
2	A. Yes, sir.
3	Q. Again, through this -- this Ellen?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. In other words, you didn't pay them?
6	A. No.
7	Q. They were paid by the University of Minnesota
8	Research Center?
9	A. Research Consortium.
10	Q. Research Consortium.
11	And so they submitted their hours to her?
12	A. That is correct.
13	Q. So it would be a matter of record?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. It would be very easy to obtain?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. Do you know how many hours you have spent
18	yourself since the time of that --
19	A. I could estimate that. I couldn't give you an
20	exact figure.
21	Q. But Ellen knows that?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. And what is it, to your knowledge?
24	A. I'd say it's roughly four hundred hours. Maybe
25	five hundred. But it was quite a bit.
1	Q. Four to five hundred hours?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And how about for each of David and Michael,
4	what's your estimate?
5	A. Probably more than I put in.
6	Q. So you would think that each of them put in more
7	than four or five hundred hours?
8	A. Probably. I'm not sure. I couldn't say.
9	Q. Did the three of you sit and discuss this topic?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. Frequently?
12	A. I'd like to know what you mean by discuss it?
13	Q. How many times did the three of you sit and
14	discuss it, would you say, in the course of this
15	assignment? Would you sit and discuss it, would you
16	say, six times? Ten times? Twenty? What's your
17	estimate?
18	A. Well, it's hard to answer that question for the
19	simple reason that we came together weekly to discuss
20	the research and the research progress.
21	Q. Okay.
22	A. If that's what you mean by discussing, then it
23	was weekly.
24	Q. So the -- so the three of you came together --
25	where did you come together weekly, at your house?
1	A. At my office sometimes, my house sometimes.
2	Q. Where's your office?
3	A. At the University of Minnesota.
4	Q. In what building?
5	A. Social Science Tower.
6	Q. And you had a regular standing weekly meeting
7	with these two gentlemen?
8	A. Not regularly standing.
9	Q. You would schedule it each week?
10	A. That's correct.
11	Q. Did your secretary do that? Did you do that?
12	A. I have no secretary.
13	Q. So you would do it yourself?
14	A. That's correct.
15	Q. And the drafting of the report went on over what
16	period of time? A year?
17	A. No, no. The drafting of the report went on for
18	a period of about a month, month and a half.
19	Q. So you met once a week during that month and a
20	half?
21	A. Roughly, yes.
22	Q. And so you told me, as I recollect, that you met
23	in the fall of '95 for the first time with Ellen?
24	A. That's correct.
25	Q. When is the report finished, then?
1	A. July 1, '97. I believe it's -- the date is on
2	the report.
3	Q. What I'm trying to understand is when you met
4	with Ellen in the fall of '95, shortly thereafter you
5	had the meeting with the Dorsey lawyers?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. You then took two weeks to decide that in your
8	opinion there was a viable research question?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. We're now in November of '95?
11	A. Yeah, I would say roughly that.
12	Q. You then embark on the research?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. These two gentlemen assist you?
15	A. Not initially.
16	Q. When did they begin to assist you?
17	A. David probably in -- later that winter. And
18	Michael in the spring.
19	Q. So for how long did you work by yourself?
2	0 A. Probably two months.
21	Q. What did that entail? Background reading?
22	A. Background. Mostly background reading.
23	Q. Any writing?
24	A. No.
25	Q. How do you write? Do you write on the computer?
1	A. I certainly do.
2	Q. That's how you write?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. Did you do any writing during that time?
5	A. No.
6	Q. Were you taking notes?
7	A. No.
8	Q. Did you use Post-Its? Do you highlight
9	materials that you want to go back and look at?
10	A. Not really. I don't recall having -- using
11	Post-Its. I don't generally use Post-Its.
12	Q. When you do your research and you read --
13	A. Uh-huh.
14	Q. -- articles, do you have a need to go back and
15	reference them?
16	A. Yes, on occasion.
17	Q. Do you mark them when you read them --
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. -- as to something that you think is important?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. How do you do that?
22	A. Actually, on this particular project, I didn't
23	do that.
24	Q. Who did?
25	A. David and Michael.
1	Q. So you did no marking of background materials?
2	A. No. No.
3	Q. How did they do it, do you know?
4	A. On -- at my direction, they looked at what I
5	thought to be pertinent, and they are very
6	knowledgeable historians and political scientists and
7	they had their own training and, therefore, could
8	make independent judgments of what is a valuable
9	source to look at. I double-checked them and --
10	essentially.
11	Q. Did you do the global reading and tell them what
12	to read?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. And so they read within the parameters you
15	defined?
16	A. Absolutely.
17	Q. And how did they mark things they read, because
18	you said you didn't. Did they note them on the
19	computer? Did they have notes?
20	A. No. We had photocopies of all documents that we
21	used. And they put together what -- essentially
22	compilations of significant documents which I
23	reviewed.
24	Q. So they would write a compilation of a
25	significant document?
1	A. They would write a compiled --
2	Q. Would they write a summary?
3	A. No.
4	Q. Did they note portions of the document?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. Okay. So they would note --
7	A. By underlining or highlighting.
8	Q. So they would underline or highlight and then
9	they would copy that page or two pages from an
10	article?
11	A. If it's an article, they'd have the whole
12	article in there.
13	Q. Okay. If it was a book, they'd copy the pages?
14	A. From a book, it would be pages.
15	Q. Pages?
16	A. Yes, pages.
17	Q. If it was a copy of other things, a long thing,
18	like the surgeon general's reports, or Food and Drug
19	Administration comments, or something --
2	0 A. That -- they would not highlight that. That
21	would be, of course, done through newspaper accounts.
22	Q. Newspaper accounts of the surgeon general's
23	report?
24	A. That's correct.
25	Q. So you wouldn't go and verify the precise
1	wording of the surgeon general reports?
2	A. Oh yes.
3	Q. You would?
4	A. If it were pertinent and necessary, yes.
5	Q. You didn't do it as a matter of course?
6	A. No.
7	Q. If you felt it was pertinent, you would go read
8	it; otherwise you based your analysis of the surgeon
9	general's reports on newspaper accounts of them;
10	correct?
11	A. Some surgeon general reports I read through
12	entirely.
13	Q. Uh-huh.
14	A. Most were based on reading of newspaper and
15	journal accounts.
16	Q. So when you cite the surgeon general's report in
17	your expert report here, sometimes you read the whole
18	one, and most times you're referring to newspaper
19	accounts that referenced the surgeon general's
20	report?
21	A. No.
22	Q. Tell me where I'm wrong.
23	A. When a surgeon general's report is cited in this
24	report, it's a report that I have read.
25	Q. It's a report that you've read?
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. In its entirety?
3	A. In its entirety.
4	Q. They would highlight and make copies, or
5	underline and make copies, of anything that was
6	longer than an article?
7	A. Uh-huh.
8	Q. Correct?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And you would read the underline or the
11	highlight?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. And from that you would cite to it?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And do you have the copies of those underlined
16	and highlighted things in those six file drawers?
17	A. I'm sure I do, yes.
18	Q. All right. And that's the basis of your
19	opinion, is the underlining and the highlights of
20	those articles that you have cited; the very specific
21	basis is the underlining and the highlights, correct?
22	A. Among other things, yes.
23	Q. Correct.
24	But that's what you read from what they did, --
25	A. Uh-huh.
1	Q. -- from which you then formulated your opinions;
2	correct?
3	A. In part, yes.
4	Q. Now, you tell me for about two or three months
5	you do some background reading and then you start
6	telling them what to read; right? Roughly?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. So now we're in the spring or the summer of '96
9	and you've directed their reading material?
10	A. Uh-huh.
11	Q. And once they start reading do you tell me that
12	they complete their project in six weeks?
13	A. No.
14	Q. I misunderstood. I'm trying to understand. I
15	had some --
16	A. What -- your arithmetic may be faulty. Six
17	weeks from '96.
18	Q. I'll correct my -- I had some understanding that
19	you told me that you met with these gentlemen on a
20	weekly basis for about six weeks. When you were --
21	A. That wasn't in '96.
22	Q. I'm sorry?
23	A. That was not in '96.
24	Q. When was that?
25	A. That was in '97.
1	Q. Was that in the finalization of the report?
2	A. That is correct.
3	Q. So the reference that you made earlier to the
4	six week meetings with them, where you met every
5	week, that was when you -- the three of you were
6	finalizing the report?
7	A. No.
8	Q. Tell me where I'm wrong.
9	A. Yes.
10	We met every week even before that.
11	Q. Okay. So from the time they started in the
12	spring of '95, and the summer of -- did one start in
13	the spring of '95 and one in the summer of '95?
14	A. Roughly.
15	Q. And from the time they started you met every
16	week?
17	A. That is correct.
18	Q. And you were discussing what they were reading?
19	A. Uh-huh.
20	Q. Correct?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And --
23	A. What they were researching, as well. Not only
24	reading.
25	Q. And what they were researching?
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. How do you make the distinction?
3	A. Reading is reading documents that have already
4	been uncovered. Researching is going out and
5	discovering what's there.
6	Q. And that's what you think is the responsibility
7	of a historian, --
8	A. That is correct.
9	Q. -- or a political scientist, is not to just read
10	what's there, but what makes you a historian is that
11	you will go out and research what just doesn't roll
12	across in front of you?
13	A. Absolutely.
14	Q. You will ask for new documents?
15	A. Uh-huh.
16	Q. Correct?
17	A. Whatever is out there, yes.
18	Q. Whatever is out there you want to read?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Because if you don't read whatever is out there,
21	you may end up looking silly as an academic; correct?
22	A. It has to be pertinent, though.
23	Q. Oh absolutely. It has to be pertinent; right?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. But if it's pertinent, and you as an academic
1	don't ask for it, and look at it, then you could look
2	silly, right?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. In fact, you've published in peer-review
5	literature, right?
6	A. Oh absolutely.
7	Q. You've sat on peer-review committees, --
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. -- where you have reviewed your colleagues's
10	peer review work; correct?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. There have been times when you, as a
13	peer reviewer have said to a colleague, a historian,
14	"You didn't scratch the surface enough. You have to
15	go scratch more because that source out there, you've
16	got to go read in that area before you can come back
17	here on this question and opine or pontificate or
18	publish to the world and be an objective historian --
19	you've got to read in that area, too"; you've done
20	that as a peer reviewer, haven't you?
21	A. I don't recall having done that. But I could
22	have done that.
23	Q. Would you do it, if in fact it was relevant and
24	important and pertinent material that someone should
25	read?
1	A. That's hypothetical, but I assume I would.
2	Q. Has anyone ever done that to you?
3	A. Not to my knowledge. Not to my recollection.
4	Q. No one to your recollection has ever told you to
5	read more?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. But you don't disagree with what I'm saying, as
8	a fundamental basis of academic freedom and academic
9	integrity?
10	A. No, I don't disagree with that at all.
11	Q. What you don't disagree with is that you should
12	read all pertinent documents and pertinent sources
13	that bear on a question?
14	A. Absolutely. Yes, I agree with that.
15	Q. Okay. Now, you met every week?
16	A. Uh-huh. Yes.
17	Q. There's lots of conversation?
18	A. Pardon me?
19	Q. So there are many conversations that the three
20	of you had?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Many?
23	A. (Nodding.)
24	Q. Correct?
25	A. Too many for me to recall them all.
1	Q. I'm sure.
2	And at the time that you were doing this
3	research, were you reading the Wall Street Journal?
4	Do you read the Wall Street Journal?
5	A. On occasion, yes.
6	Q. Did you read it religiously on tobacco
7	litigation?
8	A. Not the Wall Street Journal religiously on
9	tobacco litigation, no.
10	Q. Did you read the New York Times?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. You did?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. Every day?
15	A. I subscribe to the New York Times.
16	Q. Did you make it a habit that because you were
17	researching in a certain area, such as this question
18	that you've articulated that you should research,
19	that you were researching, did you make it a habit
20	that you would read every day?
21	A. Of course.
22	Q. The New York Times?
23	A. I read -- I make it a -- a habit to keep up with
24	the news, newspapers, because it is part of my
25	responsibility as a historian to be acquainted with
1	what's going on now, as well as the past.
2	Q. Do you make it a habit to read specifically in
3	the area of tobacco?
4	A. I read specifically on all areas, Middle East
5	Crisis, the Congressional log jam, and tobacco.
6	Q. And you did that in the New York Times?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. Not in the Wall Street Journal?
9	A. I may have read the Wall Street Journal a couple
10	of times.
11	Q. That wasn't your paper of choice?
12	A. But it's not a paper I generally receive,
13	although I've been cited and quoted in it.
14	Q. But the Times is your paper of choice?
15	A. That is correct.
16	Q. How about David and Michael, do you know?
17	A. Pardon me?
18	Q. How about David and Michael, do you know what
19	they read on a daily basis?
2	0 A. I have no idea.
21	Q. What's your memory, best you can tell me, of --
22	a lot of conversations with you and David and
23	Michael, but I'd like you to just tell me, as you sit
24	here, what your memory is of those conversations.
25	And I'll listen, but your best memory of all of
1	them.
2	A. Should I characterize them all? Is that what
3	you're asking me to do?
4	Q. Characterize, summarize, and those things that
5	you have specific recollection of as you sit here,
6	I'd like to hear.
7	A. Well, I think the major thrust of our weekly
8	meetings was to make sure that we covered all of the
9	areas of research that we had to do. All the
10	archives, all the public collections. And the -- to
11	get a report on what was done.
12	Q. What else? I'm asking you in front of this
13	jury, sir. Basically you're telling me the three of
14	you met at least thirty times or more; correct?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. I'm asking you, and I'm going to sit and write,
17	you can talk as long as you want, whether it's a half
18	hour, fifteen minutes, or however long your memory
19	is, to tell me all about these conversations that you
2	0 had.
21	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form of the
22	question.
23	THE WITNESS: Yes.
24	MR. PURVIS: You may answer.
25	THE WITNESS: Oh, okay.
1	Well, "David, what did you find in the -- in the
2	Minnesota Historical Society when you looked at the
3	records of the -- of the Minnesota Health
4	Department?"
5	David would respond, "I found this, that, and
6	the other thing."
7	"Michael, what did you look at when you went to
8	the Legislative Reference Library? What did you find
9	when you listened to the tapes of the hearings on the
10	various tobacco issues before the House and the
11	Senate of the legislature?"
12	"David, what was at the Social Welfare Archives
13	that I didn't know about?"
14	"How far have you gotten, David, in doing
15	research in the Minneapolis Star?"
16	"Are there any problems, David, in finding
17	further materials in the -- in the University
18	archives?"
19	"Have you contacted the Mayo Library yet?"
20	Those are the kinds of questions that came up.
21	If -- you know. I may have mentioned other
22	depositories, other archives, other collections. But
23	those were, in fact, the nature of our conversations.
24	BY MR. MANNING:
25	Q. What other archives or collections do you
1	recollect that you may have mentioned?
2	A. The -- the state archives that are held by the
3	Minnesota Historical Society. The gubernatorial
4	papers that are sometimes at the Minnesota Historical
5	Society, sometimes in private areas outside. The
6	Diehl Library at the University of Minnesota, which
7	is the biomedical library.
8	I mean we exhausted whatever was in the public
9	domain.
10	Q. Did you -- you exhausted whatever was in the
11	public domain?
12	A. That is correct.
13	Q. And did you make a decision not to go beyond the
14	public domain?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. Why was that, sir?
17	A. Because the nature of the question that I was
18	looking at.
19	Q. And what was that?
20	A. The nature of the question was what did the
21	people know.
22	Q. And you made a decision that what the people
23	know can only be judged or impacted by what's in the
24	public domain; is that right?
25	A. That's what the people know, yes.
1	Q. You made that decision, as a historian --
2	A. As a historian, I made that decision, yes.
3	Q. And as a historian, as a professional, you were
4	comfortable that to make some decision about what the
5	people knew, you only had to look at what was in the
6	public domain?
7	A. That is correct.
8	Q. Did you ever have -- conduct one interview of
9	anyone in the public domain?
10	A. No.
11	Q. To see what they knew?
12	A. No.
13	Q. So when you intend to offer an opinion about
14	what people knew, so we're clear for the record, you
15	never once went and talked to a person about what
16	they knew?
17	A. No.
18	Q. You didn't interview an 85-year-old; correct?
19	A. No.
20	Q. You didn't interview a 75-year-old; correct?
21	A. No.
22	Q. You didn't interview a 65-year-old?
23	A. No.
24	Q. And you didn't interview a 25-year-old?
25	A. No.
1	Q. Likewise, you didn't interview anybody at the
2	tobacco companies, did you?
3	A. No.
4	Q. And you didn't ask to?
5	A. No.
6	Q. And to this day, sir, have you ever reviewed one
7	document of the tobacco companies?
8	A. No.
9	Q. And do you know, sir, that I provided a document
10	designation of documents that I intend to show you
11	here in your deposition today and tomorrow?
12	A. I understand that you have such a list.
13	Q. Has that list been shown to you?
14	A. Just numbers. They mean nothing to me.
15	Q. Did the documents -- were the documents shown to
16	you?
17	A. No.
18	Q. But you know full well that I intend to show you
19	those documents; correct?
20	A. Please.
21	Q. But you understand that?
22	A. Yes, I do.
23	Q. But no one has chosen to show you those
24	documents --
25	A. That is correct.
1	Q. -- before coming in here today?
2	A. That is correct.
3	Q. And you didn't ask to see them?
4	A. No, I didn't ask to see them.
5	Q. And at the time that you were doing your
6	research you did not ask to have one interview with
7	one person from the tobacco companies, as a
8	historian; correct?
9	A. That is correct.
10	Q. And as a historian you did not ask to go and
11	say, "I'd like to understand this issue from the
12	perspective of the tobacco industry," did you?
13	A. No.
14	Q. You knew that there were groups that represented
15	the tobacco companies as an industry; correct?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. But you, nonetheless, not only didn't go to each
18	individual tobacco company, you did not go to the
19	entities that represented the industry; correct?
20	A. That is correct.
21	Q. And so, as we sit here today, you have not
22	reviewed one document on tobacco company stationery?
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. Nor have you reviewed a summary of those
25	documents, have you?
1	A. No.
2	Q. And you haven't asked to do that?
3	A. No, I have not.
4	Q. So after you and David --
5	Are you a smoker?
6	A. Not now, no.
7	Q. Did you smoke?
8	A. Yes, I did.
9	Q. For how long?
10	A. Forty years.
11	Q. From what year to what year approximately?
12	A. From the time I entered the United States Army
13	until the middle '80s.
14	Q. What did you smoke?
15	A. Everything but straw.
16	Q. Is there a particular brand or brands that you
17	chose?
18	A. I was very fickle. I smoked whatever -- mostly
19	whatever I could get free. Cheap.
20	Q. Was there a particular brand, sir?
21	A. Pardon me?
22	Q. Was there a particular brand that you chose over
23	another?
24	A. Not for any continuous period of time, no.
25	Q. Did you only smoke cigarettes?
1	A. Well, on occasion I smoked a pipe. Someone
2	periodically offered me a cigar. But -- but
3	basically it was cigarettes, yes.
4	Q. How about your colleagues, David and Michael, do
5	they smoke?
6	A. Pardon me?
7	Q. David and Michael, do they smoke?
8	A. No, they are not smokers.
9	Q. Both are nonsmokers?
10	A. Both are nonsmokers.
11	Q. Do you know anything about their history?
12	A. I have no idea whether they had been in the past
13	or not, no.
14	Q. How old is David?
15	A. David? I'd say late twenties, early thirties,
16	maybe.
17	Q. How about Michael?
18	A. Same.
19	Q. Where are they at today?
20	A. They are finishing their dissertations at the
21	University of Minnesota in their respective
22	departments.
23	Q. Will they go on and apply for positions in
24	academia?
25	A. Absolutely, yes.
1	Q. Some time, then, in the course of your meetings,
2	the three of you began to finalize your report?
3	A. That is correct.
4	Q. And they knew the purpose of the writing?
5	Right? Of your writing?
6	A. Well, explain what you mean by the purpose.
7	Q. They knew that the purpose of the writing was to
8	make this report available in this piece of
9	litigation?
10	A. No.
11	Q. They didn't know that?
12	A. No.
13	Q. You knew that?
14	A. No.
15	Q. What did you know?
16	A. That I was doing historical research, to write
17	this report, and give my best historical view on the
18	basis of the ethics.
19	Q. In fact, when you met with the lawyers here you
20	knew that if you wrote this report that some day you
21	may well be testifying in a court of law?
22	A. That is correct.
23	Q. And that was discussed in general terms when you
24	were in this meeting?
25	A. Yes.
1	Q. And you knew that part of testifying in a court
2	of law was that you may give a deposition like you're
3	doing here today?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. And you knew that before you agreed to do the
6	final undertaking, so to speak, with Ellen
7	Fitzgerald?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. And did you communicate that to David and
10	Michael, what their work was supporting? That was --
11	A. I don't recall communicating that to them, no.
12	Q. You don't know whether they knew that your work
13	was to offer testimony --
14	A. Oh, they knew that, yes.
15	Q. Okay. So they knew that?
16	A. They knew that, yes.
17	Q. And they knew that that testimony was on behalf
18	of the tobacco companies?
19	A. Yes, I think they knew that, as well.
20	Q. Did they have any problems with that? Did they
21	discuss that with you at any time?
22	A. Not -- not at all. They didn't discuss it.
23	They may have had problems with it, but they didn't
24	discuss it with me.
25	Q. The three of you never had that discussion?
1	A. No.
2	Q. They never discussed their bias one way or the
3	other?
4	A. No.
5	Q. And you didn't discuss yours with them?
6	A. No.
7	Q. And did the three of you co-write this report on
8	the computer? Did you all have it on your screen, so
9	you could call it up and edit it?
10	A. No.
11	Q. You were the only one that had it?
12	A. David and Michael had their version on discs,
13	which we integrated. I added some things, then
14	dictated some things. And the final product was a
15	kind of compilation of all of these things put
16	together.
17	Q. So you still have their discs?
18	A. No.
19	Q. You don't? What did you do with them?
20	A. They were integrated with -- in the final
21	product.
22	Q. What about their disc?
23	A. They -- long erased and over -- used for other
24	purposes.
25	Q. Are you sure of that?
1	A.	Uh-huh.
2	Q.	How do you know that? Did you check on it?
3	A.	I'm almost certain of that.
4	Q.	Why is --
5	A.	Because that's our pattern of operation, was
6	that.
7	Q.	Did somebody ask you to check on that, to make
8	sure that that was true?
9	A.	I certainly can check on that.
10	Q.	Did someone ask you to?
11	A.	No.
12	Q.	Did you give the report to Ellen in draft firm?
13	A.	No I did not.
14	Q.	Never once?
15	A.	No.
16	Q.	She couldn't call it up on her computer?
17	A.	No.
18	Q.	She never saw it in draft?
19	A.	No.
20	Q.	And you gave her periodic status updates on what
21	you were doing?
22	A.	No.
23	Q.	How did you know when the report was supposed to
24	be done?
25	A.	The attorneys told me.
1	Q. How did they talk to you?
2	A. Well, meetings, or telephone calls, things like
3	that.
4	Q. I thought you told me there were no meetings
5	with lawyers after the first meeting.
6	A. No.
7	Q. That's what I thought you told me?
8	A. I did not say that. I said there were no
9	meetings after that first one, until I took the
10	assignment.
11	Q. All right. We'll back up.
12	So you have the first meeting, then, with the
13	lawyers here, with the ten to fourteen, or a dozen
14	lawyers. And two weeks later you agree -- one or two
15	weeks you agreed to undertake the assignment. When's
16	the next meeting with lawyers?
17	A. I believe the next meeting -- I -- it's very
18	hard to reconstruct something after two years. Two
19	and a half years. But I believe the next meeting was
20	in December of '95, when I met with -- yes --
21	Mr. Purvis in Washington, D.C.
22	Q. You flew to Washington, D.C.?
23	A. Pardon me?
24	Q. You flew to Washington, D.C.?
25	A. Yes.
1	Q.	So first, in the fall of '95, here you are with
2	ten	to fourteen lawyers from Dorsey in this room?
3	A.	Not from Dorsey.
4	Q.	I -- from around the country?
5	A.	Yes.
6	Q.	Some from Dorsey and some from other firms.
7	And then in December of '95, three, four months
8	later, you fly to Washington D.C.?
9	A.	Uh-huh.
10	Q.	You meet with Mr. Purvis?
11	A.	Uh-huh.
12	Q.	And who else?
13	A.	I believe Jan Johnson.
14	Q.	And who else?
15	A.	That's all.
16	Q.	Who's he with?
17	A.	Pardon me?
18	Q.	Who was he with, do you know?
19	A.	Whom?
20	Q.	Jan Johnson.
21	A.	Jan Johnson? She was with the Dechert, Price,
22	Rhoads firm in Washington, D.C.
23	Q.	So you met with the two of them?
24	A.	Yes.
25	Q.	What did you say during that meeting?
1	A. What I said was essentially to -- I'd like to
2	get some assistance in doing various kinds of
3	research. And it was at that point that we worked
4	out the way of getting assistance of one kind or
5	another.
6	Q. You mean with your two research assistants?
7	A. That is right.
8	Q. You didn't have that prior to then?
9	A. I believe I had a temporary one, but that person
10	was only temporary.
11	Q. How long did the meeting last in Washington?
12	A. Maybe -- well, it wasn't -- a few hours, I
13	assume, over a period of a day or two. Because I was
14	doing research, as well.
15	Q. What else did you say?
16	A. Pardon me?
17	Q. What else did you say during the meeting?
18	A. That's about all I can recollect.
19	Q. That's all you can remember?
2	0 A. Yeah.
21	Q. Did you give an update about your research?
22	A. There wasn't very much update to give at that
23	particular moment.
24	Q. Did you know where Mr. Purvis was from?
25	A. Yes.
1	Q. Where?
2	A. Pardon me?
3	Q. Where?
4	A. Mr. Purvis?
5	Q. Yeah.
6	A. I knew he was with a law firm in Kansas City.
7	Q. You knew that was the Shook, Hardy and Bacon law
8	firm?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And did you have some understanding of the
11	relationship of that law firm to the tobacco
12	industry?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. What was your understanding?
15	A. That it was the law firm that represented one of
16	the tobacco companies. Which one I don't know.
17	Q. Did you understand that they had represented the
18	tobacco industry for a long period of time?
19	A. I did not know that at the time.
20	Q. You've come to know that at a later time?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. When did you learn that?
23	A. Subsequent to that. I don't recall the exact
24	time.
25	Q. How did you learn that?
1	A. From my reading.
2	Q. Do you recall what you read?
3	A. I couldn't recall what specifically, but from my
4	reading.
5	Q. Okay. You understood in that second meeting
6	that these lawyers you were meeting with had complete
7	and total access to the tobacco companies' documents
8	if they wanted them?
9	A. I didn't think about that at the time. No.
10	Q. You never thought about it?
11	A. No.
12	Q. Never brought it up with them?
13	A. No.
14	Q. Now, anything else in that meeting, that second
15	meeting, that you can remember?
16	A. Essentially that was what took place.
17	Q. How about the next meeting with lawyers, when is
18	that?
19	A. I may have met with some of the Dorsey Whitney
20	lawyers in subsequent times, but I don't recall
21	specifically.
22	Q. Here in their office?
23	A. Here in their office, yes.
24	Q. So you do recall that you did come here for
25	meetings?
1	A. Yes. I came here for -- I do recall coming
2	here, yes.
3	Q. Who did you meet with?
4	A. If I'm not mistaken, I believe it was with
5	Michael Lindsay.
6	Q. Who else?
7	A. That's all, that I can think of. I don't
8	believe anybody else. But I could be mistaken.
9	Q. What was the purpose of that meeting?
10	A. Essentially to inform me what the parameters of
11	the court orders on expert witnesses was all about.
12	Q. What was your understanding?
13	A. It was -- I understood that -- that there were
14	certain things I could and couldn't do in terms of
15	revealing certain things, and I understood that there
16	were certain things that I -- at that point I knew
17	that there would have to be a report, somehow or
18	other, written and filed in the future. General
19	questions like that were raised.
20	Q. When's the next meeting?
21	A. I believe the next meeting was, again, with
22	Mr. Purvis. Could have been in the spring or summer
23	of '96. I -- I don't recall the exact time.
24	Q. Where was that meeting?
25	A. That was in Washington, D.C.
1	Q. Is this now your second trip to Washington?
2	A. That was the second trip to Washington, yes.
3	Q. Who did you meet with?
4	A. Mr. Purvis. Jan Johnson.
5	Q. At Dechert, Price.
6	A. At Dechert, Price.
7	Q. Anyone else?
8	A. Julia Tyler might have been at that meeting or
9	maybe at a subsequent one. I don't recall offhand.
10	Q. Who is Julia Tyler?
11	A. Pardon me?
12	Q. Who was that?
13	A. Julia Tyler was an attorney at Dechert, Price at
14	that time.
15	Q. Okay. What did you say during those meetings?
16	A. It was, again, a meeting to discuss various
17	different -- access to various different research
18	sources and assistance in the research process.
19	Q. What access to what research sources?
20	A. Primarily newspaper files.
21	It was a very difficult and time-consuming task
22	to go through every copy of every newspaper that I
23	wanted. David and Michael couldn't do that by
24	themselves. We needed help.
25	Q. Who helped you with that?
1	A. A group of -- of researchers in
2	Washington, D.C..
3	Q. Who were they?
4	A. They were researchers who were under my
5	supervision and direction, but hired by the -- at
6	that point I think it was the Dechert firm, to go
7	through the Library of Congress and copy all
8	materials that were -- that were -- all materials,
9	period, in the newspaper files.
10	Q. Well, you've -- all materials pertinent to the
11	question you were researching?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. Or all materials?
14	A. All materials pertinent to the question I was
15	researching.
16	Q. As had been defined by you --
17	A. By me.
18	Q. And also had been defined with the assistance of
19	the lawyers?
20	A. No. It was defined by me, period.
21	Q. Were there times when the lawyers met with these
22	research assistants in Washington when you weren't
23	present?
24	A. When I wasn't present?
25	Q. Yes, sir.
1	A. I couldn't say.
2	Q. You don't know that?
3	A. I don't know that.
4	Q. You didn't demand that with those researchers
5	you would be the only one that would meet with them
6	and control their research, did you?
7	A. Oh yes, I did do that. But then, again, I
8	wasn't in Washington and, therefore, the oversight
9	had to be done by someone there.
10	Q. The oversight?
11	A. That is to say, the -- the pace at which they
12	were working.
13	Q. Okay. How many were there?
14	A. About a half a dozen, I believe.
15	Q. Were they from a university?
16	A. Some were from the University.
17	Q. Where were the others from?
18	A. Some were recent graduates, I believe. And were
19	wives of -- and husbands of people working in
20	Washington.
21	Q. Do you know their names?
22	A. No, I do not.
23	Q. Do you have a list of their names in your
24	office?
2	5 A. No, I do not.
1	Q. You can find their names?
2	A. I could call and find their names, but I don't
3	have them offhand.
4	Q. The lawyers know their names?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. All you have to do is ask Mr. Purvis on a break
7	for their names and he would give them to you; is
8	that right?
9	A. I believe so.
10	Q. All right. What's the next meeting after the
11	second meeting in Washington? Is it back here in
12	Minneapolis with lawyers? I'm talking about meetings
13	with lawyers.
14	A. The next meeting with lawyers could have been
15	last -- late winter or early spring at Chicago,
16	Illinois.
17	Q. Who was at that meeting?
18	A. Oh, some twenty-five -- two dozen lawyers from
19	all over the country.
20	Q. Where was that meeting at?
21	A. That was -- meeting was held in the Chicago
22	offices of Jones, Day.
23	Q. And two dozen lawyers in a room?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. And you?
1	A. I was there for twenty minutes with them.
2	Q. Who else was there?
3	A. Who else?
4	Q. In the meeting when you were there for twenty
5	minutes, who else was there besides two dozen lawyers
6	and you?
7	A. That's it.
8	Q. That's it?
9	A. There may have been a secretary there. I don't
10	know. I couldn't identify them.
11	Q. What did you say during that meeting?
12	A. I gave a twenty-minute summary of my research
13	findings to date.
14	Q. Did you do that from notes?
15	A. Pardon me?
16	Q. Did you do that from notes?
17	A. No. From mind.
18	Q. Totally from your head?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. You had nothing in your briefcase when you met
21	with the lawyers, is that right?
22	A. I'm sorry?
23	Q. Is it correct that you had nothing in your
24	briefcase when you flew to Chicago to meet with
25	twenty-four lawyers? That you had nothing in your
1	briefcase related to what you were going to talk
2	about?
3	A. That is correct.
4	Q. That you flew down there, read the paper, went
5	into this meeting -- you didn't have a briefcase? Or
6	do you normally carry one?
7	A. As a matter of fact, I don't think I had a
8	briefcase with me. I had a -- I had something, but
9	I'm sure it wasn't a briefcase.
10	Q. So you walked into the meeting and gave an
11	update about what you'd been doing?
12	A. That is correct.
13	Q. What did you say?
14	A. What I said -- essentially said was that my
15	research leads me to the conclusion that the health
16	hazards of smoking have been well known by Americans
17	and Minnesotans since the beginning of time.
18	Q. And you were not restricting your opinions to
19	Minnesotans; you were also restricting it -- I mean
20	you were also giving opinions about America?
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. And Americans?
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. So you were sharing that thought about all
25	Americans, as well as Minnesotans?
1	A. I was not limiting it to Minnesota, that is
2	correct.
3	Q. And your view is that the health hazards were
4	well known by all Americans, as well as by
5	Minnesotans?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. Now, again, before that meeting you hadn't
8	interviewed one American in person?
9	A. No.
10	Q. And you hadn't interviewed one Minnesotan?
11	A. No.
12	Q. And you had not interviewed one person from the
13	tobacco industry?
14	A. That's correct.
15	Q. Or read one tobacco document?
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. And you didn't ask anybody, even though there
18	were twenty-four lawyers in that room, representing
19	the tobacco industry, you didn't ask for one
20	document?
21	A. No.
22	Q. And you didn't ask for one interview?
23	A. No.
24	Q. And to your knowledge they were all lawyers in
25	the room?
1	A. To my knowledge they were all lawyers, yes.
2	Q. What else did you say?
3	A. I spoke, I think, a little bit about the long
4	and involved history of the state's actions in regard
5	to the health hazards of smoking.
6	Q. What did you say there?
7	A. That the state, from the 1860s on, was in fact a
8	leader in efforts at limiting, restricting,
9	containing, the smoking hazards.
10	Q. That Minnesota was?
11	A. Minnesota was, yes.
12	Q. Did they tell you they knew that?
13	A. No.
14	Q. Did you think that the tobacco companies knew
15	that?
16	A. I had no idea what they knew.
17	Q. You had no idea whether the tobacco companies
18	knew that Minnesota was a leader?
19	A. That was not my concern, what they knew. My
20	concern was these are the questions.
21	MR. PURVIS: When you get to a point, where we
22	can take a break --
2	3 MR. MANNING: Any time you'd like.
24	(Discussion had off the record.)
25	(Recess taken.)
1	BY MR. MANNING:
2	Q. After the meeting in Chicago, what's the next
3	meeting you had with lawyers?
4	A. After that meeting in Chicago I think the next
5	meeting I had with lawyers was in -- while we were
6	preparing this report, yes. That would be -- that
7	would be in May, June, of this year.
8	Q. While who was preparing this report?
9	A. While I was preparing the report. I and my
10	research assistants.
11	Q. Who did you meet with?
12	A. With Liza Kessler of the law firm of Jones,
13	Day. And John Monica, Junior.
14	Q. And who?
15	A. John Monica, Junior.
16	Q. Where were those meetings?
17	A. Here at Dorsey and Whitney. And at Gray, Plant
18	& Mooty.
19	Q. All here in Minneapolis?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. How many meetings did you have about the report?
22	A. Two or three.
23	Q. And they were meetings specifically to discuss
24	what you were putting in the report?
25	A. No.
1	Q. What were the meetings for?
2	A. The meeting was specifically to discuss what in
3	fact the court wanted in the report.
4	Q. And do you recall what you said in the first
5	meeting with Liza Kessler and John Monica?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. What?
8	A. I asked questions regarding what are the
9	parameters of the report, as the Court wanted them.
10	Q. What else did you say?
11	A. Listened. And got a copy, finally, of the
12	Court Order on the report, so I had it in front of
13	me.
14	Q. So you had a copy of the Court Order?
15	A. Court Order, yes.
16	Q. Was that a Court Order of March 13th of 1997, do
17	you know?
18	A. I have no idea what that is.
19	Q. You don't recall the date?
20	A. No. Not dates.
21	Q. Do you recall that the order required that all
22	experts, including you, provide with their report all
23	notes, handwritings, calculations, or other documents
24	of any kind at the time of service of the report that
25	were prepared or on hold for this matter by the
1	expert or by others? That would be produced?
2	A. Uh-huh.
3	Q. Do you recall that?
4	A. Yes, I do.
5	Q. And you know that by this report alone you
6	haven't done that? The only way you could do that is
7	if we had the six drawers in your office; correct?
8	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form of the
9	question.
10	BY MR. MANNING:
11	Q. Correct, sir?
12	A. Sorry?
13	I have no idea. Because I don't work that way.
14	Q. No, no. Listen to the question.
15	The order said, what you read, --
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. You acknowledge that you are familiar with the
18	language from the order from which I am quoting?
19	A. I certainly am.
20	Q. That the order requires you to produce all
21	notes, handwritings, calculations, or any documents
22	of any kind or nature prepared in whole or in part
23	for this matter by the experts?
24	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form of the
25	question.
1	MR. MANNING: Can I finish my question,
2	counselor?
3	THE WITNESS: Uh-huh.
4	BY MR. MANNING:
5	Q. You understand that that was language in the
6	Court Order?
7	A. So I understand, yes.
8	Q. And you understand that by producing only this
9	report, without the documents that are in the six
10	file drawers in your office, you're not in compliance
11	with that Court Order? You understand that?
12	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form of the
13	question.
14	BY MR. MANNING:
15	Q. Correct?
16	A. I don't know what you're talking about.
17	Q. Now, -- why don't you know what I'm talking
18	about?
19	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form of the
20	question.
21	BY MR. MANNING:
22	Q. You understood all the questions?
23	A. Yeah.
24	Q. You told me that.
25	A. I don't understand what you mean by the six file
1	drawers.
2	Q. They are -- all the documents that you relied
3	on, to formulate this report, are in those six
4	drawers; correct?
5	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form of the
6	question.
7	BY MR. MANNING:
8	Q. Correct?
9	A. I relied on that and others.
10	Q. And others. And in those six file drawers are
11	specifically the documents that are underlined and
12	highlighted by your research assistants, that you
13	read only the underlining and highlighting of,
14	without reading the entire documents sometimes;
15	that's in those six drawers, correct? That's what
16	you told me.
17	A. Maybe, but mostly not.
18	Q. But that's what you told me?
19	A. No.
20	Q. They may be there?
21	A. Right.
22	Q. They may also be in their drawers? In their
23	files?
24	A. Unlikely.
25	Q. But it's possible?
1	A. It's possible.
2	Q. You haven't checked?
3	A. No, I haven't checked.
4	Q. You haven't asked them recently, that question
5	specifically, have you?
6	A. I assumed everything they had, they gave me.
7	Q. Okay. So you assumed that what they had by way
8	of underlining and highlighting, that they gave you,
9	that you read, that in some way, shape, or form,
10	found its way into this report is in your six file
11	drawers?
12	A. I assume, yes.
13	Q. And you understand that those haven't been given
14	to me?
15	A. No, I have not emptied my file drawers for you,
16	no.
17	Q. All right. Now, after these two meetings with
18	these lawyers here at Gray Plant and Dorsey, what
19	were the next meetings you had with lawyers?
20	A. The next meetings were meetings with lawyers
21	in preparation for this deposition.
22	Q. Who was in that meeting?
23	A. Liza Kessler. John Monica. And Julia Tyler.
24	Q. Who else?
25	A. That's -- I think Allen Purvis was in -- at that
1	meeting, as well.
2	Q. Who else?
3	A. That's it. As far as I can recall.
4	Q. How many meetings did you have to prepare for
5	this deposition?
6	A. Three. Four.
7	Q. When was the first one?
8	A. Pardon me?
9	Q. When was the first one?
10	A. When was the first one? Sometime in late July,
11	early August.
12	Q. How long did it last?
13	A. Maybe one or two hours.
14	Q. What was discussed?
15	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form of the
16	question. I'll ask Professor Berman not to reveal
17	the contents of the conversations with counsel, as
18	they are privileged.
19	MR. MANNING: Are you claiming attorney-client
20	privilege on those conversations, counsel? So I
21	understand the nature of your objection.
22	MR. PURVIS: Yes.
23	MR. MANNING: Is that right?
24	MR. PURVIS: Work-product privilege.
25	MR. MANNING: You are claiming attorney-client
1	privilege, as well; is that right?
2	MR. PURVIS: I'm claiming work-product
3	privilege.
4	BY MR. MANNING:
5	Q. What did you say in those meetings?
6	A. "I understand."
7	Q. You listened?
8	A. I listened.
9	Q. Was a general overview of the litigation
10	provided to you?
11	A. Never. No.
12	Q. Was a general overview of what other experts
13	were going to testify to in this case ever provided
14	to you?
15	A. No.
16	Q. Never?
17	A. Never.
18	Q. Was -- but you listened for two to three hours;
19	is that right?
20	A. That is correct.
21	Q. And you said you understood?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. And then you had another meeting?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. And how long did that last?
1	A.	Roughly the same amount of time. Maybe a little
2	longer.
3	Q.	Go the same way? You listened for three hours
4	and said you understood?
5	A.	Roughly that, yes.
6	Q.	What else did you say besides "I understand" in
7	that	meeting?
8	A.	That's about it, I think.
9	Q.	And another meeting?
10	A.	A third, yes.
11	Q.	Yesterday?
12	A.	No.
13	Q.	When was that?
14	A.	Two weeks ago approximately.
15	Q.	How long did that last?
16	A.	Oh, about four hours. Five hours. Something
17	like that.
18	Q.	Did you provide an overview of your opinion?
19	A.	Yes.
20	Q.	You did?
21	A.	They had it already.
22	Q.	They had the written opinion?
23	A.	Yes.
24	Q.	Did you provide a verbal overview of it?
25	A.	No. No.
1	Q. Did you say anything in that meeting again
2	besides "I understand" for four hours?
3	A. I said many things. But I don't recall what the
4	specifics were.
5	Q. What did you say?
6	A. I understand what the ground rules of the
7	deposition are. I understand what the purpose of the
8	deposition is. And although I have been deposed -- a
9	deposed witness in other cases, it never has been
10	with this kind of intensity and, therefore, I'll be
11	prepared for it.
12	Q. You want to be prepared for it?
13	A. I'll be prepared for it, yes. That's what I
14	said, yes.
15	Q. What did you mean by that? What were you going
16	to do to get prepared for it?
17	A. Very simply, it -- I'm not a lawyer, but I
18	understand that the adversarial relationship is in
19	fact central to the legal operation. And in my
20	previous depositions we had no adversarial
21	relationship.
22	Q. You understand that when people are in the
23	legislative arena that a good deal of your opinion is
24	based on legislative history; correct?
25	A. Yes.
1	Q. Both national, as well as Minnesota?
2	A. That is correct.
3	Q. And you understand -- you think you understand
4	the legislative process pretty well; right?
5	A. Pretty well.
6	Q. Yes.
7	And you surely understand that lobbying is a
8	part of the legislative process?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And you understand that industries that have
11	finances and money, such as the tobacco industry, has
12	a lobbying effort, both nationally and locally?
13	A. Of course.
14	Q. And you also understand that when people lobby
15	on a legislative level, when they do it by industry,
16	that sometimes they have associations with other
17	industries--they form groups, larger groups; correct?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. And you understand that when you're looking at a
20	bill, or a piece of legislation, a draft of a bill,
21	or if you're looking at a bill that's been defeated,
22	or a bill that's been passed, that there may be two
23	sides to that bill?
24	A. Sure.
25	Q. And --
1	A. Maybe even more than two sides.
2	Q. May have been more than two sides. In fact, may
3	have been collective interests with the tobacco
4	industry against a bill?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. There may have been collective interests with
7	the tobacco industry for a bill?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. In fact, the tobacco industry may have gone out
10	and garnered the collective interests; you understand
11	that?
12	A. Could be.
13	Q. And you understood that every time you looked at
14	a bill in the legislative process?
15	A. Correct.
16	Q. Correct?
17	A. Well, obviously it was part of general
18	knowledge, yes.
19	Q. And yet you not once asked for one document that
20	would reveal the lobbying effort on behalf of the
21	tobacco industry or the tobacco companies that may
22	have impacted that process, did you, sir?
23	A. That is correct.
24	Q. And you never thought about doing it, did you?
25	A. Oh, I thought about doing it, but I never did
2	Q. Okay. And no one ever offered those documents
3	to you, did they?
4	A. It's hard to say whether they offered it or not.
5	Q. You don't remember, sitting here today, somebody
6	saying to you, "Professor Berman, read these
7	documents. These are the lobbying documents on
8	behalf of the tobacco company. You ought to read
9	these in order to give an unbiased, objective,
10	academically-free opinion"; you don't recall that, do
11	you?
12	A. Nope.
13	Q. If we can turn to your report, sir.
14	A. Surely.
15	Q. It's been marked as exhibit what?
16	A. Pardon me?
17	Q. It's been marked as exhibit what?
18	A. 3135.
19	Q. Uh-huh.
20	A. I think that's what that number down below
21	means.
22	Q. Thank you.
23	You've reviewed this thoroughly, right?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. Many times?
1	A.	Pardon me?
2	Q.	Many times you've reviewed this report?
3	A.	I wouldn't say many times, but often, yes.
4	Q.	Yeah.
5	And on the second page -- you are a historian?
6	A.	Uh-huh.
7	Q.	Correct?
8	A.	That is correct.
9	Q.	That is your training?
10	A.	That is my training, yes.
11	Q.	That is your experience?
12	A.	That is my experience.
13	Q.	That's your area of reading?
14	A.	That is correct.
15	Q.	And you're not a psychologist?
16	A.	Not at all.
17	Q.	You're not a behaviorist?
18	A.	No.
19	Q.	Page three of your report, your introduction.
2	0 A.	Uh-huh.
21	Q.	You said that you will testify, sir, regarding
22	the	history and evolution of cigarette smoking in
23	twentieth-century America; correct?
24	A.	Correct.
25	Q.	And you intend to do that?
1	A. If asked, yes.
2	Q. And part of your opinion touches on the history
3	and evolution of cigarette smoking in
4	twentieth-century America?
5	A. Correct.
6	Q. And yet, when you want to understand the history
7	and the evolution of smoking in twentieth-century
8	America, you've not asked the tobacco companies for
9	their historical analysis or their historical
10	documents, have you?
11	A. No, I have not.
12	Q. And you have not asked the tobacco industry for
13	its documents that reflect the evolution of cigarette
14	smoking in twentieth-century America and how they
15	have impacted -- specifically how they have impacted
16	the evolution of cigarette smoking in America; you've
17	not done that, have you?
18	A. No, I have not.
19	Q. Now, it's the first sentence in your summary.
2	0	Let's go to the second. You say that you
21	anticipate testifying about the various social,
22	cultural, and technological developments that have
23	affected cigarette consumption; correct?
24	A. Uh-huh.
25	Q. What are the technological developments that
1	affected cigarette consumption, to your knowledge?
2	A. The most important one was the development of
3	the cigarette-making machine in -- if -- I believe it
4	was 1887, 1888.
5	Q. So the technological developments --
6	A. In terms of the industry.
7	Q. Yeah.
8	The technological developments that you think
9	are the most important for the industry are the
10	invention of the cigarette-making machine in 1887;
11	right?
12	A. Approximately 1887.
13	Q. Anything else?
14	A. Yes.
15	The most important technological development
16	that led to the widespread use of cigarettes was, in
17	fact, the industrial revolution.
18	Q. I'm talking about the technological developments
19	that have affected cigarette consumption.
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. You're saying that one of those was the
22	industrial revolution?
23	A. Industrial Revolution. Yes.
24	Q. All right. Great.
25	What else?
1	A. Uh-huh.
2	Q. Pardon me?
3	A. Well, the industrial revolution subsumes within
4	it many other things. If you want me to give a --
5	Q. I think I understand the industrial revolution
6	pretty well.
7	I'm talking about the technological developments
8	that have affected cigarette consumption.
9	A. Yes. And I'm talking about technological
10	revolution of the industrial revolution and how it
11	affected changes in the patterns of behavior and the
12	patterns of migration, et cetera, that in fact
13	affected cigarette consumption.
14	Q. Okay. Thank you.
15	Anything else? What other technological
16	developments besides this machine and the industrial
17	revolution that --
18	A. That's about -- that's what was in fact -- in --
19	that was the thought behind that phrase.
2	0 Q. Okay. So that's what you meant by technological
21	development that have affected cigarette consumption?
22	A. Correct.
23	Q. Now you would agree that the manufacturer of a
24	product, in general, knows the most about the
25	technological development of its product?
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. Correct?
3	A. Of course.
4	Q. Sure. Because they made it?
5	A. Yeah.
6	Q. Right.
7	A. Of course.
8	Q. So if you wanted to know the details of the
9	technological development of the cigarette, you would
10	know, by what you just said, that the people with the
11	most knowledge about that would be the cigarette
12	companies because they make it?
13	A. Certainly.
14	Q. Absolutely. Correct?
15	A. Sure. Absolutely, yes.
16	Q. So here you are, in the second sentence of your
17	introduction, giving an opinion, as you have just
18	done, on the technological developments that have
19	affected the cigarette consumption, and you have not
20	gone to the cigarette industry or one tobacco company
21	and asked them for documents that reflect the
22	historical technological developments of a cigarette?
2	3	A. No, I have not.
24	Q. And because you haven't, and because you have
25	just admitted that the people with the most knowledge
1	on that topic would in fact be the tobacco companies,
2	then you would agree that at minimum your opinion on
3	the technological development of the cigarette
4	industry is not objective at all?
5	A. I would not agree with that at all.
6	Q. You would agree, then, would you not, sir, that
7	at a minimum it does not take into account the
8	documents and the thoughts of the people or the
9	groups of people who have the most knowledge about
10	it?
11	A. I would not agree with that either.
12	Q. You go on to say that you will also testify that
13	tobacco and cigarettes have always been the subject
14	of controversy; right?
15	A. That is correct.
16	Q. And that such opposition included claims that
17	cigarette smoking can be dangerous to health, fatal,
18	addictive, and/or habit-forming; right?
19	A. That is correct.
20	Q. Now in your research you found that in the
21	general public, so to speak, there was lots of
22	statements that cigarette smoking were addictive?
23	A. Uh-huh.
24	Q. Correct?
25	A. Yes.
1	Q. And you agree with that?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And you know that?
4	A. Depending on the definition of addiction in
5	different times, yes.
6	Q. Correct?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. And you knew that from your own personal
9	experience, --
10	A. Of course.
11	Q. -- that there was an addictive element to
12	smoking?
13	A. Of course.
14	Q. Sure.
15	And you, absolutely believe that the tobacco
16	companies know that cigarette smoking is addictive;
17	correct?
18	A. I don't know whether they -- what they know.
19	And that's not my concern.
20	Q. Oh but, sir, if the people of America -- and
21	you're saying that the people of America know it's
22	addictive, right?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. And you're also saying the people of Minnesota
25	know it's addictive, right?
1	A. Uh-huh.
2	Q. Correct?
3	A. Yep.
4	Q. We've also already agreed that a manufacturer is
5	the one who knows the most about his product; right?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. And they would know the most about the qualities
8	of their product?
9	A. Sure. Yes.
10	Q. And if America knows, and the people of
11	Minnesota know, then don't you know that the tobacco
12	companies also know that their product is addictive?
13	A. No.
14	Q. You don't know that?
15	A. I don't know that. As a historian I don't know
16	that because I haven't looked at the documents, and
17	it was not my concern to look at those documents.
18	Q. It was not any element of your concern? You
19	were only going to pontificate about America and
20	Minnesota, but you weren't going to look at the
21	tobacco companies and whether they knew, is that
22	right?
23	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form of the question.
24	BY MR. MANNING:
25	Q. I'm sorry. Render an opinion.
1	A. Sir, if you use terms like pontificate, I will
2	have to object myself.
3	Q. No problem. I'll withdraw the question.
4	If a word I use, like that, offends you, I will
5	apologize and withdraw the question. Okay. Because
6	it's not meant to.
7	A. I've taught for thirty-seven years at the
8	University of Minnesota and never was challenged on
9	pontification.
10	Q. Sir, it's a word that I use as a form of
11	rendering an opinion. And I've just said I withdraw
12	the word. And it may occur again, --
13	A. I resent that word.
14	Q. That's fine. I understand.
15	A. I resent it very much.
16	Q. I told you I withdraw it and I apologize. If it
17	occurs again in the next ten hours, which I suspect
18	it may, in the form of answering questions and asking
19	questions, please say so.
20	Okay?
21	A. Uh-huh.
22	Q. Because it is not my intention.
23	It is my intention to ask you questions, as you
24	know.
25	A. Surely. By all means.
1	Q. All right. So it just wasn't part of your
2	interest to determine whether tobacco companies knew
3	that cigarette smoking was addictive, or wasn't part
4	of your interest?
5	A. Not at all. Not in this particular project, no.
6	Q. But as a matter of common sense, if you have
7	concluded that America knew cigarette smoking was
8	addictive, and the people of Minnesota knew that
9	cigarette smoking was addictive -- we'll come back to
10	how you knew that and why what it's based on and on
11	and on -- but if you did conclude that, then you
12	would also, at a minimum, conclude that tobacco
13	companies, who are also Americans, and made up of
14	Americans, also knew that their product was
15	addictive?
16	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form of the
17	question.
18	BY MR. MANNING:
19	Q. Correct? It's common sense; correct?
20	A. I'm here as a historian, not as a common sense
21	person. And, therefore, I have no knowledge what the
22	tobacco company knew and I have no intention of
23	discovering that because that was not part of my
24	research scheme.
25	Q. Did you have an intention of not discovering
1	that?
2	A. I have no interest in discovering that.
3	Q. No interest in discovering that. Why, if in
4	fact --
5	A. I have an interest in discovering that only
6	outside of the purview of this particular thing, but
7	not in terms of being a historian, no.
8	Q. Why do you have interest in discovering --
9	A. As a citizen. In general.
10	Q. Because, in fact, if they knew it was addictive,
11	and said that it wasn't, that would be a lie,
12	wouldn't it?
13	A. I don't know what they said.
14	Q. Pardon me?
15	A. I don't know what -- you know, what that would
16	be. That's a hypothetical question and not based on
17	any kind of evidentiary material that I had before
18	me.
19	Q. But I can ask you hypothetical questions.
2	0 Okay. And you need to answer them.
21	So, in fact, if the tobacco companies, as
22	Americans, knew, like other Americans, that cigarette
23	smoking was addictive, and they said to the American
24	people the opposite, that it wasn't, that would be a
25	lie, would it not?
1	A. Well, hypothetical question -- I would generally
2	in my classes answer hypothetical questions by asking
3	a hypothetical question. And my question is: If my
4	grandfather were my grandmother would I be me?
5	Q. Let me explain, okay? This is not class.
6	You've stepped out of class.
7	A. Okay.
8	Q. And you're testifying.
9	A. Uh-huh.
10	Q. And you know that?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. That's why you met three times just to get
13	prepared for this deposition.
14	A. Exactly.
15	Q. So I'll ask the hypotheticals, just by way of
16	ground rules.
17	A. But I cannot answer them as a historian.
18	Q. Just answer them as a witness, as a person, and
19	as a human being; okay?
2 0 A. Okay.
21	Q. If you want to put one hat on, and another hat
22	on, you do whatever you want to do.
2	3	A. Okay.
24	Q. Now, do you want the question again, or do you
25	have it in mind?
1	A. No. Please ask the question again, so I know
2	exactly what I'm answering.
3	Q. If in fact tobacco companies, as Americans, made
4	up of Americans, like their fellow Americans, knew,
5	as you say, that tobacco in cigarettes was addictive,
6	and they said the opposite, that it wasn't addictive,
7	then it's a lie; correct?
8	A. As a historian I have no opinion on that. As an
9	individual, yes, it would be.
10	Q. Thank you.
11	You then go on in the second paragraph of your
12	introduction, "I intend to testify regarding the
13	longstanding and widespread awareness of the American
14	public, including the awareness of the citizens of
15	Minnesota"; do you see that?
16	A. Uh-huh.
17	Q. How can you testify, sir, about the awareness of
18	another human being without talking to them?
19	A. We do not do survey research with historical
20	materials.
21	Q. I understand that.
22	A. Uh-huh.
23	Q. That's my point.
24	A. Okay. There are various ways of determining
25	what, in fact, public knowledge -- or the extent of
1	public knowledge is without interviewing people.
2	Q. And without interviewing people, if you're going
3	to determine the extent of historical knowledge,
4	without interviewing people, and without talking to
5	them, it underscores the importance of the objective
6	nature of your research, doesn't it?
7	A. May I ask you a question?
8	Q. No, sir. You may not.
9	A. I'm answering your question. May I ask you a
10	question?
11	Q. No, sir. Just listen to the question and if you
12	can answer it, answer it. If you can't answer it,
13	then tell me why, if you can't answer it?
14	A. Repeat the question, please.
15	Q. Yes, sir.
16	MR. MANNING: Please, Janet.
17	(Record read.)
18	THE WITNESS: No, it does not.
19	BY MR. MANNING:
20	Q. Why not?
21	A. Because interviewing an individual does not give
22	me insight into the entire parameter of public view.
23	Q. Are you, in your view, able to make a statement
24	about the awareness of the people of the state of
25	Minnesota at any point in time?
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. So in your view you can make a statement about
3	the awareness of people of the state of Minnesota in
4	1900?
5	A. 1900?
6	Q. Yes, sir.
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. You think you can make a statement about the
9	awareness of people in the year zero?
10	A. In the year zero there wasn't tobacco.
11	Q. No, no, I'm not asking that.
12	As a historian can you make a statement about
13	the awareness of people in the year one hundred?
14	A. I have no knowledge of that. No, I have not
15	done research on that.
16	Q. In any other type of historical analysis.
17	How far back have you ever gone as a historian
18	making statements about awareness? How far back in
19	history have you gone?
20	A. In my teaching at the University of Minnesota
21	I've taught American History from the colonial period
22	to the present.
2	3	Q. Uh-huh.
24	A. I've read extensively in that area. I've
25	lectured in that area. In terms of time, it goes
1	back that far. In graduate school I did my minor in
2	Jewish history, which went back to biblical times.
3	And I have on occasion done some work in that and
4	lectured in that.
5	So in terms of time, I couldn't give you the
6	exact time where I could go back to. But in terms of
7	U.S. History, yes.
8	Q. In order to -- I'm not talking to you about
9	history, okay?
10	A. Uh-huh.
11	Q. I want to be clear about that.
12	I'm talking to you about awareness. All right?
13	A. Awareness of what?
14	Q. Just -- preliminary statement.
15	A. I'm sorry, I can't ask you a question. I'm
16	sorry.
17	Q. That's all right. Preliminary statement. I'm
18	talking about awareness.
19	How can you, sir, make a statement about who was
20	aware of what in 1900?
21	A. On the basis of a preponderance of evidence of
22	what in fact the people had before them.
23	Q. Now, --
24	A. On any particular subject, of course.
25	Q. On a particular subject?
1	A. On a particular subject, obviously.
2	Q. And why do you pick the words preponderance of
3	evidence? How do you pick based on preponderance of
4	evidence?
5	A. Well, the words preponderance of evidence means
6	the accumulation of materials having to do with a
7	particular subject.
8	Q. Uh-huh.
9	A. And what these materials, in fact, were
10	attempting to do.
11	Q. And so what you do is you go back and you look
12	at those materials --
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. -- that were around in 1900?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. And -- but now you have to, in looking at those
17	materials, you have to now make a leap from those
18	materials into people's minds as to what and how they
19	were aware; correct?
20	A. Not really.
21	Q. For example, sir, you have no idea if the
22	Women's Temperance League was stating something one
23	way, what level of awareness it created, do you?
24	Because you have not done any work to survey the
25	people of Minnesota at that particular time when the
1	Women's Temperance League was speaking, as to what
2	their reaction was to the Women's Temperance League?
3	A. No, I didn't survey the people of Minnesota at
4	that time.
5	Q. So you don't know whether the people of
6	Minnesota at that point in time, whether 98% of the
7	people, thought the Women's Temperance League was
8	nuts and didn't take their opinion into account, or
9	whether 98% of the people agreed with the Women's
10	Temperance League? You just have no idea, correct?
11	You have no idea?
12	A. Not really, but...
13	Q. You just know that the Women's Temperance League
14	was speaking on the topic?
15	A. And what -- and what degree of support they
16	generated within the state, yes. In other words,
17	through what support base they had in the state, or
18	in the nation, for that matter.
19	Q. The support base they had doesn't, per se,
20	correlate to what the population was aware of,
21	vis-a-vis what they were saying, does it?
22	A. No.
23	Q. You're not making that leap are you?
24	A. No, no, no.
25	Q. No?
1	So, in fact, you cannot make a conclusion, as we
2	sit here, taking one source that you picked, the
3	Women's Temperance League, --
4	A. Not one source alone.
5	Q. You cannot make a conclusion from that source
6	what degree of awareness, based on the position that
7	they took on cigarette smoking publicly, what it
8	correlates to in people's minds in Minnesota, can
9	you?
10	A. Not on the basis of that one piece of evidence.
11	Q. No. I understand.
12	What do you mean when you say Minnesota's
13	knowledge? If you want the context it's on page
14	four.
15	A. I'm sorry, which context?
16	Q. Page four, first sentence, first full
17	paragraph. "I also anticipate testifying regarding
18	Minnesota's knowledge" --
19	A. Where's that? I'm sorry. Oh, I see.
20	Q. -- "...of the health risks associated with
21	cigarettes and their addictive or habituating nature,
22	as those terms have been used for decades in popular
23	culture."
24	A. I think that's a typo. It's -- regarding
25	Minnesotans'.
1	Q. Minnesotans'?
2	A. Yes. That is a typo.
3	Q. Okay. Thank you.
4	A. Uh-huh.
5	Q. How -- who are the Minnesotans that you are
6	talking about? Who are they?
7	A. Depending on any particular moment, it's of
8	course the kind of general view held by the populous
9	in the State of Minnesota.
10	Q. Thank you.
11	So through no survey work?
12	A. Pardon me?
13	Q. You've done no survey work?
14	A. No.
15	Q. You understand what surveys are?
16	A. Oh, I certainly have.
17	Q. Ever been involved in them?
18	A. I've used them quite extensively, yes.
19	Q. Professionally?
20	A. Professionally.
21	Q. How have you used them?
22	A. I've used them to check various different
23	questions in terms of public awareness of various
24	different issues. Used the Gallup poll, the
25	Minnesota poll, the Roper poll. I've used them in
1	conjunction with the -- with the -- some -- one bad
2	career move I made, when I was in the governor's
3	office.
4	Q. What -- what was that?
5	A. Oh, we had Peter Hart doing the polling for the
6	governor and, you know, I didn't oversee that, but I
7	was involved in it to some extent.
8	Q. What was the bad move that was made? Tell me
9	that.
10	A. Oh, I was just joking, just being in the
11	governor's office.
12	Q. Oh.
13	What governor were you with?
14	A. Rudy Perpich.
15	It was a bad joke.
16	Q. That's no problem, I understand. It's not a
17	biggy.
18	You worked for Rudy, though?
19	A. No, I did not work for Rudy.
20	Q. You consulted for him?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And Peter Hart was a pollster?
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. And you understand that you can sit around in a
25	room, for example, with Rudy Perpich and you can
1	think that the people of Minnesota view something a
2	certain way? Politicians do that, right?
3	A. Well, the basis of their -- of the kind of
4	actions they take, yes.
5	Q. And sometimes they say, well, I -- the
6	Minnesotans view it this way, but in fact when they
7	do a poll or a survey they find out they were wrong?
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. And it's the poll or the survey that has some
10	scientific and statistical analysis behind it;
11	correct?
12	A. Right.
13	Q. And it is through that scientific and
14	statistical analysis that one can confirm whether a
15	gut impression is accurate; right?
16	A. Uh-huh.
17	Q. And frequently gut impressions are wrong;
18	correct?
19	A. Sometimes, yes.
2	0 Q. Yeah. And you've been a part of that
21	statistical analysis?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. You're not the one that does it because you're a
24	historian?
25	A. That's correct.
1	Q. But you've seen other professionals do that?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And there's not been one ounce of statistical
4	analysis or survey work done as a part of your
5	report, has there?
6	A. That is correct.
7	Q. And if the tobacco companies did statistical
8	research about people's awareness on certain issues,
9	do you expect that they would have shown it to you?
10	A. I have no idea.
11	Q. Well, when you went to the meeting of
12	twenty-four lawyers in a big -- I take it was a big
13	conference room at Jones, Day in Chicago; right?
14	A. Uh-huh.
15	Q. And there were twenty-four lawyers representing
16	the entire tobacco industry, as you understood it;
17	right?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. And you were giving them a summary of your view
20	and opinions; right?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And you were talking to them about the awareness
23	of the American people in Minnesota specifically,
24	right?
25	A. Yes.
1	Q. And if they had within their knowledge and
2	possession at that time statistically accurate
3	information about Americans and Minnesotans, but
4	particularly Americans, levels of awareness about
5	certain issues related to cigarettes, don't you think
6	they should have given it to you?
7	A. That's, again, a hypothetical question. I have
8	no idea whether they had such information.
9	Q. I said if they did. You can assume, for
10	purposes of this.
11	If they did, --
12	A. Uh-huh.
13	Q. If they did, you as a professional, would you
14	expect that they would give it to you?
15	A. If it had a bearing on what I was doing, yes.
16	Q. Right. Because if it did, you might sort of
17	look dumb later on? You might be duped if they had
18	certain information that they haven't given to you,
19	and then it's shown to you later on and then you say
20	"Why didn't they show it to me"; right?
21	A. Yeah.
22	Q. Yeah. You go on to say here, sir, in the second
23	paragraph on page four, going down about seven lines,
24	you say, "Moreover, the state has received
25	significant economic benefit over the years from the
1	sales of tobacco, including substantial revenues... "
2	da-da-da-da-da; correct?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. You have not looked at the cost --
5	A. At costs?
6	Q. Let me finish the question, sir.
7	A. Sorry.
8	Q. I'm sorry.
9	A. I didn't hear what you said.
10	Q. That's all right. I didn't finish the question,
11	but I paused, and it's my fault, not yours.
12	You have not looked at the cost to the state of
13	Minnesota as a result of the consumption of
14	cigarettes in this state, have you?
15	A. No, I have not.
16	Q. You've not looked at one piece of data, have
17	you?
18	A. On that issue?
19	Q. Yes.
20	A. No.
21	Q. You've not asked to see one piece of data on
22	that issue, have you?
23	A. No.
24	Q. Even though you saw that that issue was talked
25	about at great length in the complaint that was given
1	to you; correct?
2	A. That is correct.
3	Q. But that you didn't ask for any information on?
4	A. No.
5	Q. Now, you did review the amended complaint?
6	A. The amended complaint? I don't know what that
7	is.
8	Q. You reviewed a complaint?
9	A. I reviewed a complaint, yes.
10	Q. You didn't bring it with you here today?
11	A. No. In fact, I don't think I -- I don't think I
12	even have a copy any more.
13	Q. Did you give it back?
14	A. No. Once I used it up, once I read it, there
15	was no need for me to keep it.
16	Q. Is one of the ways in which the people and the
17	Americans are aware of cigarettes is through
18	advertising?
19	A. Oh, I'm sure they are, yes.
2	0 Q. Yeah.
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And in the course of your work did you review
23	the cigarette advertising code of 1964 that the
24	tobacco companies voluntarily entered into?
25	A. Yes.
1	Q. You did?
2	A. I didn't review it, but I remember looking at it
3	and examining it and reading it, yes.
4	Q. Did you make a determination in your view about
5	whether or not they complied with that code
6	thereafter?
7	A. No, I did not.
8	Q. You didn't look at that?
9	A. No.
10	Q. You weren't interested in that?
11	A. No. That was not my interest, no.
12	Q. So you read the code, but you made no
13	determination and gave -- did no reading at all on
14	whether or not the tobacco companies complied with
15	it?
16	A. No.
17	Q. Did you go out into like Barnes & Noble and find
18	any books on the tobacco industry?
19	A. As a matter of fact, I have.
20	Q. Did you?
21	A. Yes. As a matter of fact, I had.
22	Q. What books did you buy?
23	A. Ashes to Ashes, the Kluger book.
24	Q. Did you read the book?
25	A. Yes, I read it.
1	Q. Cover to cover?
2	A. I wouldn't say cover to cover, but
3	substantially, yes.
4	Q. So you read Kluger's book?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. When did you do that?
7	A. When it first came out. That was what? Two
8	years ago. Year and a half, two years ago.
9	Q. Before you agreed to undertake this assignment?
10	A. It was after. I think it came out after I
11	agreed to undertake this assignment.
12	Q. I didn't see that cited in your report, is it?
13	Did I miss it?
14	A. I don't recall whether it was cited because I
15	didn't use it as a basis for my --
16	Q. You read Richard Kluger's book, "From Ashes to
17	Ashes"?
18	A. It may be here. I'm not sure if it is or not.
19	Q. Let's check.
20	A. Huh?
21	Q. Let's check.
22	It's not cited.
23	A. It's not cited?
24	Q. Well, you tell me. But I've looked.
25	A. You have --
1	Q. Because it's listed alphabetically by author and
2	I'm assuming --
3	A. If that's --
4	Q. And I see no --
5	A. I'll check it through, but if it's not cited,
6	it's not cited. Because it was not really used as a
7	basis of my report.
8	Q. Well, that's --
9	A. It was used for background reading.
10	Q. And that's important. That's what I want to
11	understand. See.
12	So I mean if we find that you've cited it, and
13	we can look further on a break and you can surely
14	come back and correct it, but all I can tell you is
15	I've looked through alphabetically, by author, and
16	there's no Ks.
17	A. Okay.
18	Q. But this, in fact, is the jacket cover that you
19	found, --
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. -- Richard Kluger's book, "From Ashes to Ashes";
22	right?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. The title -- and you know Richard Kluger is a
25	Pulitzer Prize winner?
1	A. Yes, I do.
2	Q. And won the Pulitzer Prize for things unrelated
3	to this book?
4	A. That is correct.
5	Q. But is a renowned author, correct? Known for
6	his --
7	A. Respected journalist, yes.
8	Q. Respected journalist.
9	And this says, America's hundred-year cigarette
10	war--the public health and the unabashed triumph of
11	Philip Morris?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. Has a picture of a cigarette burning from ashes
14	to ashes; right?
15	A. Uh-huh.
16	Q. This is just the jacket cover, right?
17	A. Uh-huh.
18	Q. It is a six-, seven-hundred page book; right?
19	A. Yeah.
20	Q. And you read it cover-to-cover?
21	A. Not cover-to-cover.
22	Q. But you read it?
23	A. Uh-huh.
24	Q. Did you also read his other book,
25	"Simple Justice"?
1	A. I don't recall that. What's the theme of that
2	one?
3	Q. It's on the history of race in America.
4	A. History of race?
5	Q. And particularly --
6	A. No.
7	Q. -- racial issues from a legal standpoint?
8	A. No, I evidently haven't read that one.
9	Q. Okay.
10	MR. PURVIS: I'd like to ask a point of
11	clarification.
12	Is this book on your predesignation list? I
13	don't believe it is.
14	MR. MANNING: It doesn't have to be, counsel.
15	He just acknowledged that he read it.
16	MR. PURVIS: For you to use the document in the
17	deposition, I believe you have to predesignate --
18	MR. MANNING: The document is not marked. And
19	it's not true by way of cross-examination. The
20	document is not marked, so I'm not using the
21	document.
22	MR. PURVIS: You cannot show, according to case
23	management order, documents that have not been
24	predesignated, except for purposes of impeachment.
25	And this document has not been predesignated. And I
1	think its improper for you to be using it.
2	MR. MANNING: We can take this up at a later
3	time.
4	BY MR. MANNING:
5	Q. Other than "From Ashes to Ashes," what else did
6	you read?
7	A. Are you asking regarding my Barnes & Noble
8	experience?
9	Q. Yes, sir.
10	A. Okay. That's the only book I found at the time
11	I visited Barnes & Noble that had any kind of bearing
12	on this particular question.
13	Q. But when you went to Barnes & Noble you went and
14	you asked somebody, presumably, is there anything on
15	tobacco in here?
16	A. No.
17	Q. You just ran across it yourself?
18	A. That is correct.
19	Q. When you were pouring through the stacks?
20	A. That is correct.
21	Q. You ran across the book and you bought it?
22	A. That is correct.
23	Q. Did you charge for the purchase of that book in
24	the course of your research?
25	A. No, I did not.
1	Q. That wasn't an item that --
2	A. That was not an item.
3	Q. You're absolutely confident that wasn't charged
4	for?
5	A. I'm absolutely confident.
6	Q. Okay. And you made a determination that that
7	book had no relevancy at all to your work; correct?
8	A. Pretty much, yes.
9	Q. And the way in which you made that determination
10	was that you said, "This book doesn't really have
11	anything to do with the historical analysis of the
12	tobacco industry"?
13	A. No, I didn't say that.
14	Q. Because, in fact, the book had a great deal to
15	do with the historical analysis of the tobacco
16	industry, did it not, sir?
17	A. It certainly did.
18	Q. And it was written by a Pulitzer Prize winner?
19	A. Yes, it was.
20	Q. And you don't have one mention of it in your
21	report, do you?
22	A. No.
23	Q. And in that book there is a discussion of
24	tobacco company documents in general and
25	specifically, correct?
1	A. I recall that being in the book, yes.
2	Q. And you read it, right?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And that hasn't found its way in one shape or
5	form into your report; --
6	A. That is correct.
7	Q. -- has it?
8	And in the course of the more than at least ten
9	meetings that you had with lawyers from here at
10	Dorsey, to Chicago, to Washington, D.C. -- did you
11	visit any other cities besides Chicago and
12	Washington?
13	A. No.
14	Q. In Chicago or Washington you never mentioned to
15	these lawyers for the tobacco industry that you read
16	Richard Kluger's book, "From Ashes to Ashes," did
17	you?
18	A. I don't recall mentioning it, no.
19	Q. Did you discuss it with David and Michael?
2	0 A. We may have. I'm not sure.
21	Q. Did they read it?
22	A. I'm not sure. I don't think so.
23	Q. Why do you say that?
24	A. Unless they took it out of the library.
25	My copy remained in my -- in my home and they
1	didn't take it.
2	Q. You met in your home more than once with them,
3	right?
4	A. Oh yes.
5	Q. And the jacket cover remained on the book?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Do you keep jacket covers on books?
8	A. Generally.
9	Q. It's a fairly obvious jacket cover, isn't it,
10	"From Ashes to Ashes"?
11	A. Yes.
12	But it was on the shelf.
13	Q. But it was on the shelf.
14	But they're academics, right?
15	A. Yeah.
16	Q. Academics do like to look at other people's
17	books?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. And you don't recall whether they ever looked
20	through and saw that book?
21	A. I don't recall that.
22	Q. Or expressed any interest in reading it?
23	A. I don't recall that, no.
24	Q. No other books?
25	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
1	BY MR. MANNING:
2	Q. Any other books you read?
3	A. Oh, I read many books, but --
4	Q. On tobacco?
5	A. On tobacco, but not out of the Barnes & Noble
6	experience.
7	Q. How about out of the library? How about a book
8	called "Smoke Screen"? Have you read that?
9	A. "Smoke Screen"?
10	Q. "Smoke Screen"?
11	A. I have no recollection of that one.
12	Q. No recollection of that one, huh?
13	A. No.
14	Q. How about a book titled, "The Cigarette Papers"?
15	A. Sorry?
16	Q. "The Cigarette Papers," with a forward by the
17	Surgeon General, Everett Koop, the former --
18	A. I recall coming across that on one of my
19	Internet searches, yes.
20	Q. Did you pull it down?
21	A. No, I did not.
22	Q. You read portions of it?
23	A. I read what, in fact, it included and came to
24	the conclusion that it was not pertinent to my
25	research topic.
1	Q. Well, in fact, what it concluded -- when you
2	read what it included, what it included was a
3	thorough historical analysis of tobacco company
4	documents? You recall that on the Internet?
5	A. Certainly.
6	Q. You recall that, right?
7	A. Yes, certainly I recall that.
8	Q. So here you were on the Internet reading "The
9	Cigarette Papers," written by four academics?
10	A. I wasn't reading it. I read a book about them.
11	Q. I understand that. Reading about them, a book
12	written by four academics; right?
13	A. Uh-huh.
14	Q. It's written on, as you know, a historical
15	analysis of the tobacco company documents; correct?
16	A. That is correct.
17	Q. And you, as an objective historian, an expert,
18	did not read further; correct?
19	A. That is correct.
20	Q. And you, as an objective historian, did not ask
21	your two colleagues to read that book?
22	A. That is correct.
23	Q. And you, as an objective historian, did not ask
24	one of the twelve people who were working under your
25	direction in Washington D.C. to read those books?
1	A. No.
2	Q. Or that book?
3	A. No.
4	Q. How many people did you have working for you
5	total? Fourteen?
6	A. No. I think in Washington there was six maybe.
7	Q. Six? Okay. But the answer remains the same, --
8	A. I did not ask one of those six --
9	Q. -- you didn't ask one of those six to read that?
10	A. No.
11	Q. And you don't know whether those six were aware
12	of it?
13	A. No, I have no way of knowing.
14	Q. And you don't know whether David or Michael were
15	aware of it?
16	A. I have no way of knowing that either.
17	Q. Would you agree with me that as younger
18	individuals they're more, generally, I'll say this is
19	certainly true for myself, generally more computer
20	literate than you are, they're a little more faciled
21	with the Internet, et cetera?
22	A. Both of them, yes, I would say that.
23	Q. They live on it a little more, use it more, the
24	way their training was?
25	A. Certainly, yes.
1	Q. So you think they probably ran across it, as
2	well?
3	A. Could be.
4	Q. You just don't know?
5	A. Could be.
6	Q. What else have you ran across on the Internet
7	related to smoking and cigarettes?
8	A. I don't recall anything specifically beyond
9	that, except for perhaps, you know, the ongoing
10	account of the various maneuvers regarding settlement
11	and non-settlement that came up on CNN or, USA Today,
12	or the New York Times online, or even the
13	Star Tribune online.
14	Q. You read all that with interest?
15	A. I wouldn't say I read it all. I -- I looked at
16	it, yes.
17	Q. Other than Richard Kluger's book "From Ashes to
18	Ashes," other than the book, "The Cigarette Papers,"
19	which you ran across on the Internet and saw the
20	description of the book as a historical analysis of
21	tobacco company documents, are there any other things
22	that you recall that you've run across that aren't
23	cited in your report?
24	A. Hundreds and thousands of specific articles in
25	newspapers are not cited here.
1	Q. I understand that. But Richard Kluger's
2	book --
3	A. In terms of books?
4	Q. Yes, sir.
5	A. Is that what you're asking?
6	Q. Yes. Books.
7	A. In terms of books. No.
8	Q. Have you now read all the surgeon general's
9	reports? Or have you only still just read the '64
10	report?
11	A. I read the '64 report and, if I'm not mistaken,
12	the '88 report. Those in between I've read summaries
13	of. And New York Times and other detailed accounts
14	of those reports.
15	Q. Have you read the '94 surgeon general's report
16	on youth and smoking?
17	A. No, I have not.
18	Q. Have you interacted with any of your colleagues
19	at the University of Minnesota in any way, shape, or
20	form regarding tobacco?
21	A. What do you mean by interaction?
22	Q. Have you interacted with them in any way, shape,
23	or form regarding tobacco in any way?
24	A. My colleagues knew of the research project I was
25	working on, yes.
1	Q. The colleagues in your History Department?
2	A. In the History Department.
3	Q. How about in any other departments, like
4	Dr. Perry?
5	A. Pardon me?
6	Q. Have you ever interacted with Dr. Perry?
7	A. No, no.
8	Q. So who are the colleagues in your
9	History Department that knew of your research?
10	A. Whom I --
11	Q. Who knew of it?
12	A. Just about everyone, I think.
13	Q. Does it have to be approved by the Dean before
14	you undertake it?
15	A. No.
16	Q. You have complete autonomy as to any project you
17	undertake?
18	A. No.
19	Q. Tell me why you don't have complete autonomy.
20	A. This is done as a consulting arrangement and,
21	therefore, I have to conform to the University's
22	policies on consultation.
23	Q. What are those?
24	A. I had to first get approval of consultation
25	arrangements. And then get annual reports of
1	consultation.
2	Q. Who approved it, the consultation arrangement?
3	A. Chairman of the Department, the Dean. The
4	Academic Vice President.
5	Q. Who are those people by name?
6	A. At the time that this was done the Chairman of
7	the History Department was Kinley Brauer.
8	Q. Kinley?
9	A. Brauer. B-R-A-U-E-R.
10	The Dean at the time this was done was
11	Dean Julia Davis.
12	And I really don't recall who the Academic
13	Vice President at the time was. We have so many
14	coming and going, that I don't remember who it was
15	that... The change of administration and things like
16	that.
17	Q. Did you talk to them verbally to get approval?
18	A. No.
19	Q. Send a memo?
20	A. Pardon me?
21	Q. Did you send a memo?
22	A. No.
23	Q. How did you do it?
24	A. Filed a form.
25	Q. Do you have that form?
1	A. No.
2	Q. Is it thrown away?
3	A. Pardon me?
4	Q. You threw it away?
5	A. That's not for me to keep.
6	Q. You sent the form to them and they keep it?
7	A. That's right.
8	Q. So they have the form?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. What did you say on the form?
11	A. I'm doing consulting work with a law firm of
12	Dorsey and Whitney, through the University Research
13	Consortium, on pending litigation in which historical
14	questions are -- are being researched. Something to
15	that nature.
16	Q. Did you disclose to them that you were going to
17	be paid by the tobacco industry?
18	A. No.
19	Q. You didn't?
20	A. No.
21	Q. Why didn't you do that?
22	A. That was not asked for in the report.
23	Q. Okay. And you didn't think it was relevant?
24	A. No. Because it could have been on many other
25	issues that Dorsey and Whitney would have asked me to
1	work on.
2	Q. But there wasn't, was there?
3	A. No.
4	Q. And you knew what Dorsey & Whitney was asking
5	you to work on --
6	A. But we kept it that way so there'd be opening
7	for that.
8	Q. I'm sorry? I don't understand.
9	A. Historical research, in connection with pending
10	litigation, was the way it was put.
11	Q. But you didn't tell them, so I'm clear, the
12	Academic Vice President, the Dean, or --
13	A. Chair.
14	Q. -- the Chair of your department, that you in
15	fact were being paid by the tobacco industry?
16	A. So far as I know I was being paid by the
17	University Research Consortium.
18	Q. Oh, we've already gone through this and
19	established --
20	A. I know that, but --
21	Q. But you knew full well --
22	A. If you want to insist on that, I'll insist on
23	that, as well, you know.
24	Q. No, no, no, no. Listen.
25	A. As far as I'm concerned, the University Research
1	Consortium was what was paid.
2	Q. But I'm not asking you as far as you were
3	concerned. What I'm asking you is what your
4	knowledge was.
5	Do you not agree with me that we have previously
6	already clearly established that very early on,
7	within the first two weeks, you knew full well that
8	the money that would come into your pocket would come
9	from the tobacco companies?
10	A. That is correct.
11	Q. And you did not disclose that on this form to
12	the Chairman or the Academic Vice President; correct?
13	A. It wasn't asked for.
14	Q. I understand that's your view, that it wasn't
15	asked for.
16	A. It wasn't asked for.
17	Q. But I don't know that unless I see the form;
18	right?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. You could get that form by asking them for it;
21	right?
22	A. I assume so. I don't know where the form is
23	filed, but I'm sure you could find out.
24	Q. Then you had to file annual reports, too?
25	A. I had to file an annual report, yes.
1	Q. Is that a form, too?
2	A. That's also a form.
3	Q. And who is that sent to?
4	A. I guess to the same channels.
5	Q. Same ones?
6	A. I assume.
7	Q. And does the consortium group have to file these
8	same reports, too, I presume?
9	A. I don't know.
10	Q. You just don't know?
11	A. I don't know.
12	Q. We'd have to ask her, whatever, Ellen
13	Fitzgerald?
14	A. Right.
15	Q. What did you say on the annual report, to your
16	knowledge?
17	A. All the annual report asks is whether I was
18	complying with the University consulting policy and
19	not exceeding the time limitations.
20	Q. What are those?
21	A. That during the academic year they are not to be
22	more than one day per week.
23	Q. Did you exceed that?
24	A. No.
25	Q. Never?
1	A. Never.
2	Q. Okay. Can you go beyond one day a week if
3	you're not teaching that quarter?
4	A. I never was in a position of not teaching any
5	quarter during the last few years.
6	Q. You also teach all summer sessions?
7	A. Oh no. That's another matter.
8	Q. You just teach fall, winter, and spring
9	quarters?
10	A. Fall, winter, and spring.
11	Q. In the summer you can work as much as you want?
12	A. That is correct.
13	Q. Did you ever ask anybody to see the testimony of
14	the tobacco executives in front of Congress?
15	A. No.
16	Q. Are you aware that they did so testify in 1994?
17	A. I am aware, yes.
18	Q. Are you aware of that from the New York Times?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Any other sources?
21	A. I think perhaps the nightly news on television.
22	Q. What is your awareness, as a historian, of what
23	was said in the press about their testimony?
24	A. I have no awareness as a historian regarding
25	that testimony.
1	Q. None?
2	A. Not as a historian, no.
3	Q. As an individual.
4	A. Well, as an individual, yes.
5	Q. What do you remember?
6	A. My recollection is that, "What do you expect
7	them to say?"
8	Q. No, no, no. That's --
9	A. No.
10	Q. Tell me more about that. What do you mean?
11	A. Well, after all, they're trying to protect their
12	industry, I assume. And, therefore, they're saying
13	what they have to say, period.
14	Q. So you -- as an individual do you believe it's
15	legitimate for someone to say what they need to say
16	to protect their industry, irrespective of whether
17	it's the truth?
18	A. I have no position on that as a historian, no.
19	Q. You have no position on that as a historian?
20	A. No.
21	Q. So as a historian you have no position on
22	whether or not someone who is testifying in Congress,
23	as the chief executive officer of a major
24	multi-national company, should in fact tell the
25	truth?
1	A. Oh.
2	Q. You have no opinion on that?
3	A. As a person I agree.
4	Q. That they ought to tell the truth?
5	A. Certainly, yes.
6	Q. Right.
7	A. I assume they were under oath.
8	Q. Right. Right.
9	A. That answers your question, I assume.
10	Q. No.
11	Next question.
12	You assumed they were under oath, right?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. You assumed that they told the truth?
15	A. I assumed under oath they are compelled to tell
16	the truth.
17	Q. Previously you told me that you assumed that
18	they would say what they needed to say to protect
19	their company; correct?
20	A. Within the truth.
21	Q. You believe within the truth?
22	A. Within the truth, yes.
23	Q. Do you have a recollection as an individual of
24	what they said about whether or not cigarettes and
25	cigarette smoking causes cancer?
1	A. In that '94 --
2	Q. Yes, sir.
3	A. -- testimony?
4	No, I don't recall that at all.
5	Q. You don't recall that at all?
6	A. No.
7	Q. Do you have a recollection of what they said
8	about whether cigarette smoking is addictive?
9	A. Yes, I do recall that.
10	Q. What did they say?
11	A. They said no.
12	Q. And did you assume that they were telling the
13	truth when you read that?
14	A. I assumed that they were telling the truth as
15	they saw the truth.
16	Q. As they saw the truth?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Which was to protect their company?
19	A. And also to tell the truth within that
20	parameter.
21	Q. To tell the truth, to protect the company, they
22	could say it was not addictive; is that right?
23	A. Within the definition, as they perceived it,
24	yes.
25	Q. And you knew that what they were saying about
1	addiction, under oath to Congress, that was in your
2	view contrary to what the American people and the
3	people of Minnesota believed; correct?
4	A. That is correct.
5	Q. And that was your opinion about what people
6	believed; correct?
7	A. That is correct. By historical judgment.
8	Q. Right. Now, if in fact -- if in fact --
9	A. Pardon me.
10	Q. Go ahead.
11	A. Let's go back.
12	In '94 I had no historical judgment on this. I
13	had not yet started working --
14	Q. Hadn't started working?
15	A. So I'm sorry. I have to back off on that
16	particular answer.
17	Q. If in fact, sir, -- if in fact in '94 those
18	chief executive officers had stood up, under oath,
19	and said, it is addictive, it is absolutely addictive
20	and, yes, we have known that for a long period of
21	time. That, you would agree with me, would have some
22	impact on awareness in the American people and the
23	people of Minnesota about addiction; correct?
24	A. Not really.
25	Q. Well, it might be reported in the press if they
1	said that, don't you think?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Don't you think?
4	A. Oh certainly.
5	Q. And your view -- that's great. That's
6	wonderful.
7	Let's be clear about that. Your view is that if
8	the chief executive officers of the six largest
9	tobacco companies in the world, stated publicly that
10	cigarette smoking is addictive, that it would have
11	not really any impact on awareness?
12	A. That's exactly what I'm saying.
13	Q. Okay. Great.
14	And yet you do believe that if the Boy Scouts of
15	America said in 1961 that cigarette smoking was
16	addictive, that it would have an impact on the
17	awareness of the American people?
18	A. Of the Boy Scouts.
19	Q. Of the Boy Scouts?
2	0 A. (Nodding.)
21	Q. Okay. But no one else, just the Boy Scouts?
22	A. The Boy Scouts and whomever they come into
23	contact with and have influence upon and so on.
24	Q. Good. When you began to do your historical
25	analysis did it cross your mind that your conclusions
1	about the widespread knowledge, as you concluded, of
2	people's knowledge of addiction, was at odds with
3	this testimony that you were aware of in 1994?
4	A. I never thought of it.
5	Q. You just didn't think about it?
6	A. No.
7	Q. When you went to that big meeting in Chicago
8	with twenty-four lawyers you didn't ask them about
9	it?
10	A. No.
11	Q. No?
12	You say in your report here, sir, on page six,
13	"Further, I may review additional materials produced
14	or to be produced by plaintiffs in this matter,
15	including future deposition transcripts and the
16	exhibits thereto"; do you see that?
17	A. Yes, I do.
18	Q. Have you asked for the testimony of the tobacco
19	executives?
2	0 A. No, I have not.
21	Q. Do you intend to so ask?
22	A. No, I do not.
23	Q. Have you asked for the testimony of the tobacco
24	scientists?
2	5 A. No, I have not.
1	Q. Do you intend to ask for it?
2	A. No, I do not.
3	Q. Not interested in it; correct?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. Page seven of your report, sir, you said --
6	right there on the top, it's a continuation from the
7	sentence on six, at the bottom, "For many decades
8	citizens of the United States and the State of
9	Minnesota have been aware that cigarettes are
10	potentially harmful to their health, addictive, and
11	that it is risky to use them"; do you see that?
12	A. Uh-huh. I do.
13	Q. Okay. And who said that it was addictive?
14	A. Who particularly?
15	Q. Yeah. Right.
16	A. Oh, very simply. You find it mentioned in every
17	one of the hygiene health science textbooks that were
18	used by the State from 1897 on. Maybe even earlier,
19	but 1897 on. You'll find it in the popular
20	literature. You find it in the -- in the general
21	comments of people who had difficulty breaking the
22	habit. Right down the line. This is the -- the
23	preponderance of evidence is there. You know.
24	Q. Is that it's addictive?
25	A. That it's addictive. Addictive as defined that
1	way. Hard to break.
2	Q. Have you ever seen the tobacco companies say
3	that it's addictive?
4	A. No.
5	Q. Nowhere in your historical analysis?
6	A. Maybe -- maybe last week, or weeks ago, or three
7	weeks ago, but no.
8	Q. What do you mean two or three weeks ago?
9	A. If I'm not mistaken there was some kind of
10	statement in deposition of some tobacco industry
11	executives regarding addiction.
12	Q. Where did you read that?
13	A. New York Times.
14	Q. And what was the statement?
15	A. I don't recall the exact statement.
16	Q. But that's where you read it, was the
17	New York Times?
18	A. I believe so. Maybe even have been in the
19	Star Tribune.
20	Q. To your knowledge it was reported as that that
21	was the first time that was so stated by the tobacco
22	companies?
23	A. That's how the New York Times reported it, yes.
24	Q. Did you ask, then, for further documents on this
25	topic --
1	A. No.
2	Q. -- to see what the tobacco company's position
3	had been over a period of time, --
4	A. No.
5	Q. -- historically?
6	A. No.
7	Q. Do you recall in the book, "From Ashes to Ashes"
8	that you read, of Richard Kluger, that it discussed
9	in great detail the internal company documents that
10	admitted it was addictive, but stated what they would
11	say publicly, that it wasn't? Did you read that?
12	A. Yes, I did. I recall reading that, yes.
13	Q. And so when you are attempting to determine the
14	level of awareness, or awareness of a Minnesota
15	population, and the people of America, even though
16	you had read Richard Kluger's book and knew that the
17	tobacco companies' publicly denied the addictive
18	nature of cigarettes -- you knew that, right?
19	A. Uh-huh. Yes.
20	Q. You did not ask for one internal document that
21	would explain why there was this apparent conflict?
22	A. That is correct.
23	Q. And even though you had read Richard Kluger's
24	book that said they knew it was addictive and stated
25	the opposite, to the American people, you did not
1	explore the apparent dichotomy in these two
2	positions?
3	A. That is right.
4	Q. And you did not scratch the surface to say I, as
5	a historian and a respected academic at the
6	University of Minnesota should make a determination
7	about whether a lie is occurring in this apparent
8	dichotomy, did you?
9	A. I did not.
10	Q. And you did not say, "I need to evaluate first
11	and foremost, seriously here, whether I am a pawn in
12	a lie," did you? You didn't do that?
13	A. That was not what I was doing, no.
14	Q. On page eight, sir, --
15	A. Eight?
16	Q. -- when you cited to the Court --
17	You knew your report was going to be public;
18	right?
19	A. Yes, of course I did.
20	Q. And when you cited all of this Benjamin
21	Franklin, Abraham Lincoln, Oliver Wendell Holmes,
22	John Quincy Adams, --
23	A. I left out some, as well.
24	Q. I understand. And you went back to these
25	statements that are made, you're quoting John Quincy
1	Adams here, August 1845, about his being addicted to
2	tobacco and two of its mysteries, smoking and
3	chewing, you're not aware of whether anybody in
4	Minnesota was aware of what Adams said, are you?
5	A. What Adams said in 1845?
6	Q. Correct.
7	A. No, I'm certainly aware that no one in Minnesota
8	knew what he was saying in 1845. Because there was
9	no Minnesota in 1845.
10	Q. That's what I thought.
11	So what are you giving an opinion about here,
12	the American people?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. In 1845?
15	A. Yes. Yes. Yes.
16	Q. So you do intend to give an opinion about the
17	American people and the Minnesota people, after a
18	Minnesota is created?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Did it ever strike you, when you read through
21	this and cited this to us from King James in 1604,
22	right through John Quincy Adams, to 1845, and the
23	surgeon general's report you have in here, as well,
24	about -- did it ever strike you--why are all these
25	people saying this and the tobacco companies aren't?
1	A. No.
2	Q. Never crossed your mind?
3	A. No.
4	Q. When you were putting this in here did you think
5	back to Richard Kluger's book when this dichotomy --
6	A. No.
7	Q. -- that we've already discussed --
8	Let me finish my question.
9	A. I'm sorry.
10	Q. -- when this dichotomy was so clearly pointed
11	out in his book, of what they knew versus what they
12	said?
13	A. No that was not of interest to me. Not
14	historically on this historical project.
15	Q. Correct.
16	And you didn't think you had a responsibility to
17	include that knowledge that you had as an individual,
18	as a result of reading that Pulitzer Prize winner's
19	six hundred page book, did you?
20	A. It had no bearing on what I was doing, right.
21	Q. Okay. Now, let's talk about the rise of
22	cigarette popularity that you do on page nine, okay?
23	A. Uh-huh.
24	Q. Here we have the invention of the safety match?
25	A. Uh-huh.
1	Q. And then the women's movement?
2	A. Yep.
3	Q. Did you want to ever have an understanding of
4	whether or not tobacco companies targeted women
5	specifically, to get them to become much greater
6	consumers of cigarettes? Did that interest you?
7	A. Not in the context of this particular project,
8	no.
9	Q. Well, but there was a rise of cigarette
10	popularity that you were talking about; correct?
11	A. That is correct.
12	Q. And you wanted to make sure that you include
13	every element of why it's rising in popularity,
14	correct, as a historian?
15	A. Yes. Yes.
16	Q. Right.
17	And one of those is the women's movement?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. Along with the safety match, and the Depression,
20	and a lot of other things?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. The major world wars; right?
23	A. Surely, yes.
24	Q. But surely one of the things that could also
25	impact specifically women is that if they target
1	women, the tobacco companies, in a very specific,
2	concerted way, to make sure that they go out to get
3	women to smoke in the same numbers, if they can, that
4	men are doing it as a result of the wars and whatnot;
5	did you see that?
6	A. Is that a possibility, are you asking me?
7	Q. Yeah.
8	A. Certainly it's a possibility.
9	Q. Were you interested in that possibility?
10	A. Not as a major factor, no.
11	Q. Did you see it discussed in Kluger's book?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. And, again, you knew about it in your head from
14	reading his book when you were writing this?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. But you didn't include it?
17	A. No.
18	Q. Well, how about the rise of cigarette popularity
19	and the targeting of kids? Have you ever seen it
20	discussed anywhere, that cigarette companies
21	specifically go after teenage kids to get them
22	addicted?
23	A. I've seen such charges made, yes.
24	Q. Where?
25	A. I've seen it throughout the literature, in the
1	New York Times particularly. And claims made by
2	different advocates of various kinds, yes.
3	Q. Did you see it in the complaint that you read?
4	A. I saw it in the complaint.
5	Q. And when you read the complaint did you -- you
6	know, ask anybody in the room that you were with
7	there that day, when the people gave it to you at
8	Dorsey in the meeting, and then all of those
9	follow-up meetings, did you ever ask anybody whether
10	what was stated in the complaint was true?
11	A. I had a very limited interest.
12	Q. I understand that. That's what you say. But my
13	question --
14	A. The answer to your question is no.
15	Q. That's my point. Is that you were given a copy
16	of the complaint; as a historian and as an individual
17	you read the complaint, and in at least -- shall we
18	say in excess of ten meetings you've had with lawyers
19	in total, is that fair?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. At least ten meetings you had with lawyers,
22	having read the complaint in this case, you didn't
23	ask once whether any of the allegations in it were
24	true, --
25	A. No.
1	Q. -- did you?
2	A. No.
3	Q. And you did not and never have undertaken any
4	analysis at all to determine whether or not tobacco
5	companies go after kids?
6	A. I'm sorry.
7	Q. You have never undertaken any analysis
8	whatsoever to determine whether tobacco companies go
9	after kids, have you?
10	A. No, I have not.
11	Q. And you saw it talked about in Kluger's book;
12	right?
13	A. I don't recall seeing it in Kluger's book, but
14	it could have been there, yes.
15	Q. You saw it talked about in the complaint?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. As an individual, and as a citizen of the State
18	of Minnesota, you find it reprehensible that people
19	would intentionally go out and try to get twelve- and
20	fifteen-year-old kids addicted, do you not?
21	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form of the question.
22	BY MR. MANNING:
23	Q. You do find it reprehensible, correct?
24	A. You're asking me as a historian? I didn't do
25	research on that.
1	Q. I'm asking you as a historian and an
2	individual.
3	A. As a historian I have no view on that.
4	Q. As an individual?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. It's reprehensible?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. And as an individual you made no effort
9	whatsoever to determine whether those allegations
10	were true, even though you knew that those were
11	allegations?
12	A. No, I have made no such effort.
13	Q. And you made no such effort as an individual or
14	as a historian; correct?
15	A. As a historian it was not part of my research
16	design, no.
17	Q. And you made no effort as individual, --
18	A. As an individual --
19	Q. -- or a historian?
20	A. -- I assumed this will come out with the wash.
21	Q. Okay. That's what you did as an individual; is
22	that right?
23	A. Uh-huh.
24	Q. Is that right?
25	A. Yeah.
1	Q. On the bottom of page nine you have, "Backlash
2	Against Cigarettes."
3	A. Uh-huh.
4	Q. And you state there in the fourth sentence,
5	"Although the attack on cigarettes had a strong
6	religious and moral component... " do you see that?
7	A. Yes, I do.
8	Q. You found historically that there was a moral
9	component?
10	A. Absolutely.
11	Q. And you analyzed that moral component; correct?
12	A. Yes, I did.
13	Q. And so is there a moral component to targeting
14	kids, to get them to smoke and get them addicted? Is
15	there?
16	A. That was not the issue that was raised at this
17	particular time, but the moral component had to do
18	with the general impact that cigarettes had on the
19	morality of those who smoke.
20	Q. So you were concerned about the morality of
21	those smokers; is that right?
22	A. That's -- I'm reporting what I found in terms of
23	the literature.
24	Q. Right. But you were at least looking to some
25	degree at the issue of morality; correct?
1	A. No.
2	Q. You were looking at --
3	A. The others were looking at morality. I'm
4	reporting what they're saying regarding morality.
5	Q. Yes. You were reporting what others were
6	looking at, --
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. -- vis-a-vis morality?
9	A. Exactly.
10	Q. But as we've established, at minimum, through
11	the complaint you became aware that there was a
12	moral, legal, and ethical charge about targeting
13	kids; correct?
14	A. In the complaint it so appears, yes.
15	Q. And at least as an individual, as well as a
16	historian, you took no interest in that moral issue;
17	correct?
18	A. As a historian, that was not my research
19	project.
20	Q. Even though you saw it in the complaint?
21	A. Certainly.
22	Q. And even though you ran across moral issues in
23	your historical analysis?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. Now lying, you would agree, is a moral issue?
1	A. Of course.
2	I think -- I think we can make the assumption
3	that the Ten Commandments would be part of the moral
4	issue.
5	Q. You bet. You bet.
6	Did you make a determination about whether the
7	Anti-Cigarette League had an impact on decreasing
8	smoking or increasing smoking?
9	A. I don't think I made a determination one way or
10	another on that, no.
11	Q. If the Anti-Cigarette League's impact was to
12	increase smoking --
13	A. No, it certainly didn't have that impact.
14	Q. How are you aware of that?
15	A. Pardon me?
16	Q. How are you aware of that?
17	A. Obviously those were influenced by the
18	Anti-Tobacco League, or the Non-Tobacco League,
19	whatever the various things were called at the time.
20	They certainly would not be smokers. Or if they were
21	influenced by them, they would quit smoking if they
22	were smokers.
23	And there are many such -- evidence of testimony
24	in the various journals that the various leagues put
25	out. Testimonies regarding "I was a heavy smoker and
1	I stopped smoking because I've seen the light. It's
2	bad for you. It's immoral. It's unhealthy." And
3	all that kind of stuff. I've seen that, yes.
4	As far as its impact on increasing smoking, I
5	would think that that would not be their objective.
6	Q. I understand that, sir.
7	A. Yeah.
8	Q. My point is did you do any analysis to see
9	whether or not their efforts caused some people to
10	start smoking who said, "Ah, they're quacks, you
11	know, I don't like them. I'm on the other side of
12	the issues politically from them." Did you look at
13	that at all?
14	A. No, not really.
15	Q. It wouldn't necessarily be in the historical
16	documents, would it?
17	A. No, it wouldn't find its way in there. It could
18	be indirectly, but it wouldn't be directly, no.
19	Q. Right. It could be or it could not be?
20	A. Yeah, that's right.
21	Q. And that's just one example of lots of things
22	that may or may not be in historical documents;
23	correct?
24	A. That is correct.
25	Q. So historical documents are limited as to what
1	they can tell us?
2	A. Any particular historical document, taken by
3	itself out of context, yes.
4	Q. Any group of historical documents may not touch
5	on certain issues, as well?
6	A. The likelihood is slimmer that that would be the
7	case.
8	Q. But this issue, for example, on the impact on
9	whether increase or decrease, because you would agree
10	that there would be no way of reporting the increase?
11	A. Right.
12	Q. Correct?
13	A. That's correct.
14	Q. Now, in response to any anti-campaign, whatever
15	it is, Anti-Cigarette League, or whatever, there may
16	be documents in the tobacco companies about whether
17	it causes a decrease or an increase? They would know
18	by the sales of their cigarettes; right?
19	A. They may, yes.
20	Q. And you didn't ask for that information to
21	complete the historical picture, did you?
22	A. No, I did not ask for that information.
23	Q. All right.
24	A. That information was public.
25	Q. Was public?
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. What information was public?
3	A. Regarding the sales of tobacco products and --
4	I've seen references to so many billions of
5	cigarettes consumed in a particular year, up from the
6	last year, or down from the last year. Depending on
7	that -- I didn't have to go to the tobacco companies
8	for that.
9	Q. In fact, you went to the surgeon general's
10	reports --
11	A. Pardon me?
12	Q. You went to the surgeon general's report for
13	most of that, didn't you?
14	A. That is correct.
15	Q. Right.
16	And the first surgeon general's report was in
17	what year?
18	A. '57, I believe, was the first surgeon general's
19	report.
20	Q. So that information wasn't public prior to then,
21	to your knowledge, was it?
22	A. I don't recall.
23	I seem to recall, I seem to remember, seeing
24	such figures published in the newspapers annually. I
25	may be mistaken. But I seem to recall that in --
1	prior to '57, yes.
2	Q. Okay. But you don't remember where?
3	A. I don't remember where.
4	Q. Did you specifically do any reading on the
5	impact that anti-cigarette sort of efforts have with
6	respect to kids?
7	A. With respect to kids?
8	Q. Kids. Youth.
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. What did you read there? What did you become
11	aware of there?
12	A. In the literature of these various groups.
13	Q. Yes. What did you become aware of?
14	A. When did I become aware?
15	Q. What did you become aware of --
16	A. Oh.
17	Q. -- about the effect of anti-cigarette smoking
18	messages on kids, if anything?
19	A. That essentially the anti-cigarette smoking --
20	anti-tobacco, anti-cigarette, whatever, groups, had,
21	was in fact to galvanize actions on the part of
22	groups in the society that had a direct impact on
23	children to keep smoking materials out of the hands
24	of children. That's -- throughout the literature
25	that is very, very clear, and specific.
1	Q. Did you make any determination as to whether or
2	not it was effective?
3	A. Again, the question of effectiveness would have
4	to be defined. In terms of did it have an impact?
5	Yes, it did.
6	Q. What impact did it have?
7	A. It led to the passage of legislation leading to
8	the restriction of the sale and purchase of
9	cigarettes by minors. It led to the introduction of
10	mandated curriculum materials, having to do with the
11	health hazards, as well as the moral hazards of
12	smoking and alcohol, tobacco and alcohol.
13	Q. Did it decrease the number of kids smoking, to
14	your knowledge?
15	A. I have no way of knowing that.
16	Q. Well, were you aware that at the same time that
17	these efforts to prevent kids from smoking, by way of
18	education and whatnot were occurring, were you aware
19	by the allegations in the amended complaint, at a
20	minimum, that the tobacco companies were doing
21	everything in their power, through advertising and
22	promotions, to negate that influence and to have kids
23	start smoking? Were you aware of that?
24	A. I'm aware that such allegations are made, yes.
25	Q. And you were aware of that from the amended
1	complaint?
2	A. Pardon me?
3	Q. You were aware of that from the amended
4	complaint?
5	A. Yes. Among other places, but the amended
6	complaint, yes.
7	Q. And the other place -- one other place, at
8	least, was Kluger's book?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And another place was the press?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. What are the other places?
13	A. That's about it.
14	Q. And even though you were aware of that, from the
15	sources you've described, you have made statements in
16	your report that at least give the distinct
17	impression that these efforts to educate had some
18	positive impact --
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. -- on reducing kids smoking; correct?
21	A. Yes. Yes.
22	Q. And you do not know whether that is true,
23	because you've not evaluated that vis-a-vis the
24	efforts of the tobacco companies to counteract it?
25	A. No.
1	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form of the question.
2	BY MR. MANNING:
3	Q. And so you don't know to what degree the
4	educational efforts over a period of time about
5	telling children about the consequences of smoking
6	have, when a counter-effort is occurring? You just
7	don't know, do you?
8	A. No.
9	Q. And in your view that's not part of this
10	historical analysis that you were performing; right?
11	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
12	BY MR. MANNING:
13	Q. Correct?
14	A. I can't answer that question in a yes or no
15	manner, no.
16	Q. If you want to answer it, go ahead.
17	A. Pardon me?
18	Q. If you want to answer it differently, go right
19	ahead.
20	A. It was not my interest to look at company
21	efforts, but rather to look at societal efforts.
22	Q. You would agree with me, when there are only six
23	companies in America that dominate and impact the
24	smoking behavior of Americans, as well as kids, that
25	they then become a relevant part of the equation if
1	you're going to talk about smoking behavior?
2	A. Not necessarily.
3	Q. Okay. And the reason you didn't look at them is
4	because of not necessarily?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. We at least know that -- if you look at page
7	twelve and the top of page thirteen, where you talk
8	about Sperry, --
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. -- Lyman Beecher Sperry -- she -- or he
11	addressed the importance of using scientific research
12	in the instruction of smoking's hazards, right?
13	A. Uh-huh.
14	Q. He says that the arguments against tobacco do
15	not come from, "The crotchets of hair-brained
16	reformers"; right?
17	A. Uh-huh.
18	Q. That's at least how this individual was
19	perceiving a number of the reformers; correct?
20	A. No.
21	Q. Well, what's your view of that?
22	A. This is -- I've read his report; therefore, it
23	is absolutely an incorrect way of characterizing it.
24	Q. Tell me why.
25	A. He was, in fact, talking to the view that many
1	people had, that these weren't the crotchets of
2	hair-brained reformers. He didn't believe that
3	himself.
4	Q. In fact, he thought it was based on science and
5	research?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Correct?
8	A. And it should be, even more so, based on science
9	and research.
10	Q. Right.
11	A. Right.
12	Q. Not on the crotchets of hair-brained reformers?
13	A. Uh-huh.
14	Q. Correct?
15	A. That's right.
16	Q. All right. And he was acknowledging that some
17	people may perceive the reformers with those
18	adjectives?
19	A. Absolutely, yes.
20	Q. All right. And how people perceive something
21	impacts their degree of awareness of something;
22	correct?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. And we just have no idea back in 1890 how
25	numbers of people perceived one thing versus another?
1	A. No.
2	Q. It's not been quantified at all by you; correct?
3	A. Or by anyone.
4	Q. By anyone?
5	A. Yes.
6	MR. MANNING: Let's take a short break, please.
7	(Recess taken.)
8	BY MR. MANNING:
9	Q. Sir, have we talked about everybody that you met
10	with in our -- I want to make sure that I've asked
11	you, as you sit here right now, about your knowledge
12	of everybody you met with in preparation for your
13	opinion -- your testimony here today. I want to
14	recount all those --
15	A. Pardon me?
16	Q. I don't want to recount all those, --
17	A. Yes, I remember whom --
18	Q. Right.
19	A. Um --
20	Q. Any other meetings or anybody else that you met
21	with that in any way relates to this case, your
22	opinion, your report, that we haven't talked about?
23	A. Well, I did meet with Professor George Green.
24	Q. Who is that?
25	A. Professor George Green is a member of my
1	department who is a business historian, who is
2	doing -- who is an expert witness in this case on the
3	history of Blue Cross-Blue Shield.
4	Q. An expert for the tobacco companies?
5	A. Pardon me?
6	Q. An expert for the tobacco companies?
7	A. That's for Dorsey and Whitney, through the
8	University Research Consortium.
9	Q. And when did you meet with him?
10	A. I can't pinpoint the exact date, but it was
11	roughly last fall or winter, during the course of the
12	research.
13	Q. How long did you meet with him?
14	A. About an hour.
15	Q. What was -- who was there?
16	A. I was there. He was there. My two research
17	assistants. And his research assistants.
18	Q. Okay. What was discussed?
19	A. Fundamentally what we were seeking to do was to
20	avoid duplication of effort. That if he came across
21	anything that would be of interest and of
22	significance to my project, he would so inform me.
23	And same thing, we would do for him.
24	Q. What else was discussed?
25	A. Pardon me?
1	Q. What else was discussed?
2	A. That's it.
3	Q. Can you recall anything else that was said in
4	the meeting?
5	A. Pardon me?
6	Q. Do you recall anything else that was said in the
7	meeting?
8	A. It was all dealing with that kind of question.
9	The question of research, research techniques, and
10	not duplicating efforts, yes.
11	Q. Was there overlap?
12	A. There was -- well, if you -- by that you mean
13	did I get anything from him, and did he get anything
14	from me, I can answer that question.
15	Q. Yes. Fine.
16	A. I got nothing from him. But he did get some of
17	the transcripts of legislative hearings that I had,
18	that had a bearing on health matters and health
19	policy, Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
20	Q. Anything else you remember about the meeting?
21	A. That's about it.
22	Q. Did you discuss what was going on in the press?
23	A. No.
24	Q. That you were reading?
25	A. No.
1	Q. Did he discuss his discomfort with the
2	assignment?
3	A. No.
4	Q. Did the research assistants discuss their
5	discomfort with the assignment?
6	A. No.
7	Q. Nothing else that you can recall was discussed?
8	A. Nothing else.
9	Q. Anybody else you met with besides
10	Professor Green?
11	A. I mentioned who the other people were.
12	Q. That's my point. We've exhausted all the people
13	you met with?
14	A. So far as I can recall, those were the people
15	that were present.
16	Q. Are there any other experts you had contact with
17	besides Professor Green?
18	A. No.
19	Q. You have not been in any other meetings where
20	other experts were present?
21	A. Not at all.
22	Q. Have you ever visited the Minnesota Document
23	Repository?
24	A. No, I have not.
25	Q. Have you ever asked to visit it?
1	A. No, I have not.
2	Q. Do you know what it's in it?
3	A. Yes, I do.
4	Q. What?
5	A. Documents that were put on file by both the
6	plaintiff and the defendant in connection with this
7	case.
8	Q. So as a research historian you are aware,
9	sitting with an office at the University, and your
10	home on the West Bank, that there is a Minnesota
11	Repository right downtown here?
12	A. That is correct.
13	Q. And you are aware that in that repository are
14	documents that have been put there by the tobacco
15	industry?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. And you are aware that documents have been put
18	there by the plaintiffs, as well?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. And you are aware that within those documents
21	are many historical documents?
22	A. I assume so.
23	Q. Yes. In fact, you would assume that many of the
24	documents reflect a past history of one type or
25	another?
1	A. That is correct.
2	Q. And you, as an objective, independent researcher
3	and historian, have never asked to go to the
4	Minnesota Repository and look at documents?
5	A. That is correct.
6	Q. Nor have your research assistants asked to do
7	so?
8	A. That is correct.
9	Q. And you cannot say that those documents don't
10	bear on the question that you are researching because
11	you've never seen the documents?
12	A. No, I can't say that.
13	Q. In fact, if you went and looked at the documents
14	you may find that they would bear dramatically on the
15	question that you're researching? You just don't
16	know, correct?
17	A. Not quite.
18	Q. You don't know because you don't know how many
19	documents are there, do you?
20	A. No, I don't know how many documents are there,
21	no. That's true.
22	Q. Do you know whether there's one million or
23	twenty million?
24	A. I don't know the parameters, no.
25	Q. No idea?
1	A. No. I know it's vast.
2	Q. Yes.
3	A. Voluminous.
4	Q. And there's no way you can comment because
5	you've never looked at them, as to how the historical
6	documents there may bear on your question that you've
7	researched? You just don't know?
8	A. Oh, I --
9	Q. That's what you told me.
10	A. I do know.
11	Q. You know --
12	A. They do not bear.
13	Q. Ah.
14	A. Ah-uh.
15	Q. Great. You know?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. You know, as an objective historian, --
18	A. Right.
19	Q. -- at the University of Minnesota, that the
20	documents in the Minnesota Repository, placed there
21	by both plaintiffs --
22	A. Uh-huh.
23	Q. The State of Minnesota is the plaintiff, right?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. And you're speaking about the State of
1	Minnesota's knowledge?
2	A. That's correct.
3	Q. And documents placed there by Blue Cross and
4	Blue Shield, --
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. -- and documents placed there by all the tobacco
7	industries, and you don't know whether there's one
8	million or twenty million, but you are ready to say
9	to this jury that you know, that irrespective of a
10	number of documents placed there, included being
11	placed there by the state of Minnesota, that they
12	have no bearing on your issue?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. Thank you.
15	You've not, to your -- in your view ever been
16	provided an overview of this litigation by lawyers?
17	A. No.
18	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form of the question.
19	BY MR. MANNING:
20	Q. Is that right? You never have been in your
21	view?
22	MR. PURVIS: I'm going to caution Professor
23	Berman not to comment on discussions with counsel.
24	THE WITNESS: Okay. I will not discuss
25	discussions with counsel.
1	BY MR. MANNING:
2	Q. How many times have you reviewed the amended
3	complaint?
4	A. I think I've seen it the first time -- is that
5	the amended complaint? Was that the original
6	complaint? I have no idea. When you say amended I
7	don't know --
8	Q. Let's just refer to it as complaint.
9	How many times have you referred to the
10	complaint?
11	A. I've read it carefully two years ago.
12	Q. And that's it?
13	A. That's it.
14	Q. You never went back and read it again?
15	A. No.
16	Q. You never asked to see it again?
17	A. No.
18	Q. You never asked whether there were any changes
19	in the complaint?
20	A. No.
21	Q. Do you agree that nicotine is a drug?
22	A. Do I?
2	3	Q. Yeah. You.
24	A. I have no idea whether it's a drug or not.
25	That's not my area of expertise.
1	Q. So you have no idea whether nicotine is a drug?
2	A. That's not my area of expertise.
3	Q. Just answer the question.
4	You have no idea whether nicotine is a drug?
5	A. Not as a historian, I have no idea whether
6	nicotine --
7	Q. As a person here, testifying under oath, as an
8	individual, --
9	A. As an individual, yes, I do.
10	Q. What is it?
11	A. It is a drug.
12	Q. And why do you say that?
13	A. Why do I say that?
14	Q. Yeah.
15	A. Because I think that comes out very clearly in
16	the recent surgeon general's reports and so on and so
17	forth.
18	Q. And in your view, as an individual, is the
19	cigarette a nicotine delivery system?
20	A. So it is alleged.
21	Q. Is the cigarette a nicotine delivery system?
22	A. I would assume so.
23	Q. Oh.
24	A. Now I'm talking as an individual, not as a
25	historian.
1	Q. I understand.
2	A. In this case.
3	Q. Also, as an individual, it's your view that
4	smoking causes cancer; correct?
5	A. Oh absolutely. As an individual. I've not done
6	any independent research on that.
7	Q. You're also aware, based on your historical
8	analysis?
9	A. No question about it.
10	Q. Not even a shadow of a doubt?
11	A. Not even a shadow of a doubt.
12	Q. Okay. And when, as a historian, in your
13	analysis of these documents would you say was the
14	first time in a year, pick a year, that beyond a
15	shadow of a doubt, cigarette smoking caused cancer?
16	A. Sometime in the 1950s.
17	Q. Okay.
18	A. I couldn't pinpoint the exact date. But
19	sometime in the 1950s.
20	Q. Now, I take it that you'd agree then, the 1950s,
21	sometime, beyond a shadow of a doubt, smoking causes
22	lung cancer?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. 1950s, beyond a shadow of a doubt, it causes
25	larynx cancer?
1	A. That is correct.
2	Q. 1950s, beyond a shadow of a doubt, it causes
3	pulmonary disease?
4	A. That is correct.
5	Q. 1950s, beyond a shadow of a doubt, it causes
6	heart disease?
7	A. Uh-huh.
8	Q. All these are statements of you as a historian;
9	correct?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. Same question, 1950s, beyond a shadow of a
12	doubt, it causes oral and mouth cancer; correct?
13	A. I assume so. I haven't seen any specific
14	reference to that, but it may be there.
15	Q. Beyond a shadow of a doubt in the 1950s it
16	causes emphysema?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Beyond a shadow of a doubt it causes, in the
19	1950s, beyond a doubt, pancreatic cancer?
20	A. I haven't seen any reference to that, but I
21	assume so.
22	Q. How about bladder cancer?
23	A. I have no idea, but I assume so.
24	All the horrible things, yes.
25	Q. From an ethical standpoint do you agree, sir,
1	that a manufacturer has a duty to understand the
2	health effects of its products?
3	A. Is that a historical question?
4	Q. Sir, it's a question. If you want to make a
5	distinction whether you're answering that question as
6	an individual or a historian, I don't care.
7	A. Okay.
8	Q. You make that distinction.
9	A. I'll make that distinction.
10	Q. Whenever you want to do that.
11	A. I'll make that distinction.
12	Q. I'm just asking questions.
13	A. As a historian, I have no independent knowledge
14	of that. As an individual, yes.
15	Q. As an individual you agree that a manufacturer
16	has a duty to understand the health effects of its
17	products?
18	A. As an individual I agree, yes.
19	Q. You also agree that from an ethical standpoint a
20	manufacturer has a duty to test its products for
21	their health effects?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. You also agree that a manufacturer has a
24	responsibility to tell the users of its products what
25	it knows about the health effects of its products?
1	A. As an individual, yes.
2	Q. Are you aware, sir, as an individual or
3	historian -- and if you want to tell me the
4	difference, go right ahead -- are you aware of the
5	Frank Statement that was made in January of 1954 by
6	the cigarette companies in newspapers all over this
7	country, where they agreed to accept an interest in
8	people's health as a basic responsibility paramount
9	to every other consideration in our business? Are
10	you aware that that statement was made?
11	A. I have seen a copy of that statement from --
12	that was printed as an ad in newspapers, yes.
13	Q. You've seen a copy of that?
14	A. A copy of the ad of that statement that was in
15	fact in an advertisement, I think by the industry, in
16	newspapers. I've forgotten now which. It could have
17	been the New York Times. It could have been the
18	Minneapolis Star. But I've seen such a statement,
19	yes.
20	Q. Are you aware that, in fact, the cigarette
21	industry took out ads all over this country in all
22	the major newspapers from sea to sea in January of
23	1954 that said, quote, "They agreed to accept an
24	interest in people's health as a basic responsibility
25	paramount to every other consideration in our
1	business"; are you aware of that?
2	A. I'm not aware that it was placed in every
3	newspaper, but I'm aware of that, yes.
4	Q. Major newspapers.
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. Pardon me?
7	A. Yes, I'm aware of that, yes.
8	Q. So you're aware that people in this country,
9	Americans and Minnesotans, became aware that the
10	tobacco companies were pledging to them that their
11	health, that individual's health, my dad's health,
12	they were undertaking a responsibility --
13	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
14	BY MR. MANNING:
15	Q. -- to be totally forthright and candid and
16	honest about the health effects of their products
17	paramount over and above anything else? You're aware
18	of that?
19	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: I don't recall the specifics of
21	the statement in 1954. So I couldn't say that that
22	was, in fact, the particular thrust of their
23	statement.
24	BY MR. MANNING:
25	Q. Do you recall that these were the words? That
1	we agree to, quote, "accept an interest in people's
2	health as a basic responsibility, paramount to every
3	other consideration in our business"; do you
4	recall --
5	A. I don't recall the exact words, but if you say
6	those are the exact words, I accept them, yes.
7	Q. Do you recall, irrespective of whether you
8	recall those were the exact records, that that was
9	the thrust of the ad?
10	A. Yes. Yes.
11	Q. You do?
12	A. Yes, I do.
13	Q. And the way you understood that, as a historian,
14	is that over and above any other interest -- profits
15	or any other interest, the tobacco companies were
16	making people aware in Minnesota and in America, that
17	they were pledging to put health above any other
18	concern?
19	A. That's what the statement stated, yes.
20	Q. That's how you understood it?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. That's how you, as a historian, understood the
23	pledge that they were making to America?
24	A. I wasn't looking at that as a historian. I was
25	looking at that as an individual.
1	And in terms of a historian, I looked -- I
2	factored that in, in my -- in all -- in everything
3	else, yes.
4	Q. All right.
5	And so based on that statement, particularly if
6	that statement was repeated numerous times, --
7	A. Uh-huh.
8	Q. Did you see that statement repeated numerous
9	times in the press, and radio, and television, in
10	interviews?
11	A. You mean reporting it?
12	Q. No. Let me finish. I'm sorry.
13	A. That particular --
14	Q. Let me finish.
15	A. Sorry.
16	Q. The message -- there's a message there, isn't
17	there?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. The message is health above all other concerns.
20	Your health above our profits, that's the message.
21	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
22	BY MR. MANNING:
23	Q. Okay. We agree that's the message in the Frank
24	Statement?
25	A. That's my assumption, yes.
1	Q. Okay. Would you agree that message was
2	repeatedly delivered by the tobacco industry,
3	individual companies and executives, as well as
4	industry groups, repeatedly delivered from the '50s,
5	right on through the '80s? And you were aware of
6	that in your historical analysis?
7	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
8	BY MR. MANNING:
9	Q. Correct?
10	A. I have no knowledge of the repeated consistence,
11	so I can't say, no.
12	Q. You did not, in the course of your historical
13	analysis, determine whether or not the Frank
14	Statement was made in 1954, most of the major
15	newspapers across this country, was repeated by the
16	tobacco industry? You didn't do that?
17	A. I have no recollection of seeing it beyond the
18	'54 statement. But it could have been. Could have
19	been.
20	Q. But you don't recollect it?
21	A. Pardon me?
22	Q. You don't recollect it?
23	A. No, I don't recollect it.
24	Q. And it wasn't something that you looked for, was
25	it?
1	A. If it were in the press, I would have found it.
2	Q. But you didn't specifically look for it, did
3	you? You didn't direct your research assistants to
4	look for it, did you?
5	A. No.
6	Q. And if, in fact, tobacco companies, all of them,
7	knew in 1954 that cigarette smoking, beyond a doubt,
8	caused cancer, and they didn't tell the American
9	people that, then that would be in contradiction to
10	the Frank Statement, wouldn't it?
11	A. Could be, yes.
12	Q. It would be, wouldn't it?
13	A. Uh-huh.
14	Q. Yes?
15	A. I'm sorry.
16	Q. It would be, wouldn't it?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. And then that would be a lie, wouldn't it, based
19	on your morality --
2	0 A. Uh-huh.
21	Q. -- and moral standards; correct?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. And in the course of your historical analysis
24	did you discover statements, many, by the tobacco
25	industry, and individual tobacco companies, that
1	cigarette smoking was not proven to cause cancer?
2	Did you discover that?
3	A. There was a discussion in -- even in the '50s,
4	early '50s, late '40s, as to the direct causative
5	factor of cigarettes and various disease that was
6	still under debate by various scientific
7	practitioners. I recall that.
8	Q. Where did you see that?
9	A. Pardon me?
10	Q. Where did you see that?
11	A. Among other places, in the television program
12	that Edward R. Murrow put on in "See It Now" on the
13	tobacco controversy.
14	Q. Where did you get that program?
15	A. Got it -- if I'm not mistaken, through the
16	Vanderbilt Archives. And I got it through some of
17	the collections of television materials that were
18	available in the public domain.
19	Q. Were they provided to you by the lawyers in
20	Washington? Did they direct you to them and where
21	they were?
22	A. I don't recall whether it was provided to me by
23	the lawyers, or if we got it through the Vanderbilt
24	University Archives.
25	Q. Was there any information that was provided to
1	you -- that directed that you go here, you go to
2	Vanderbilt, in those archives you're going to find
3	all this? Was that ever done?
4	A. Not that I recall.
5	Q. Never once? To your researchers?
6	A. They may have suggested that there's something,
7	but I don't recall the specifics of that at all.
8	Q. Well, let's get into that.
9	A. Yeah.
10	Q. They may have suggested to you, as an objective
11	historian, --
12	A. Right.
13	Q. -- where to look?
14	A. No.
15	Q. Never happened?
16	A. No.
17	What they would say is, "Are you aware that the
18	materials -- these kinds of materials may be there?"
19	That's the only kind of thing that I recall having
20	conversations with them about.
21	Q. Okay. So they suggested in a more artful
22	manner -- they said, "Are you aware,
23	Professor Berman, that these materials might be
24	there"?
25	A. And it was very helpful to know that.
1	Q. And then you went there?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Or you directed one of your research assistants
4	to go there?
5	A. Exactly.
6	Q. Or you directed one of the people in Washington
7	to go there?
8	A. No.
9	My research assistants here were the ones that
10	got material of that kind. The ones in Washington
11	did strictly newspaper work.
12	Q. So your researchers here traveled, they went to
13	Vanderbilt?
14	A. No. We can do that by telephone and mail.
15	Q. And they would mail to you tapes --
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. -- from Vanderbilt Archives of television
18	programs?
19	A. Uh-huh.
20	Q. Is that right?
21	A. Uh-huh.
22	Q. And that's what you watched?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. How many times did that occur, where people said
25	to you, "Professor Berman, you might find it
1	interesting to look here," and you did? How many
2	times did that happen in the course of your research?
3	A. Very few. Maybe once, twice. Vanderbilt
4	Archives being one example.
5	Q. And that sticks out in your memory, this TV
6	program you watched?
7	A. Pardon me?
8	Q. That sticks out in your memory, this TV program
9	that you watched?
10	A. That's correct. That's the "See It Now"
11	program.
12	Q. What year was that?
13	A. "See it Now" program, '52 or '53. I have no
14	idea. I mean it's in the early '50s, let's put it
15	that way.
16	Q. And there they were saying, you recall in the
17	program, there's a debate about causation?
18	A. The program was, in fact, a debate.
19	Q. Okay. And did you see that go on in the
20	documents, or TV programs, or anything else that you
21	saw after the '50s, late '50s, '60s? '70s?
22	A. There was some -- I've seen some accounts of
23	scientific doubters, including Professor Berkson at
24	Mayo Clinic, at that time. But that's about the
25	extent of it.
1	Q. That's not the question.
2	A. Okay.
3	Q. The question is: If in the course -- did you, in
4	the course of your historical analysis, determine
5	that tobacco companies and/or their industry
6	spokes people, late '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s, continued
7	to say, repeatedly, that there was an open question
8	about whether or not smoking caused cancer, and that
9	there was a debate about that? Did you see that in
10	your analysis?
11	A. I can't recall that specifically -- specifically
12	that kind of a -- no, statement. No. It may have
13	been. I may have seen it, but I don't recall it,
14	yes.
15	Q. You just don't recall it?
16	A. No, I don't.
17	I assume there may have been such a statement,
18	but I don't recall it.
19	Q. Do you recall what was said in the '94 testimony
20	by the executives in front of Congress on that issue?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. What did they say?
23	A. Pardon me?
24	Q. What did they say?
25	A. No. I recall the newspaper accounts of that.
1	Q. What did they say?
2	A. That they deny the addictive character of
3	cigarettes.
4	Q. Did they also deny that it caused cancer?
5	A. I don't recall that at all. That was not part
6	of -- my recollection does not include that. It was
7	the addiction question that I recall.
8	Q. You don't recall the causation of cancer?
9	A. No.
10	Q. Testimony in '94?
11	A. Testimony on cancer I don't recall, no.
12	If I'm not mistaken, the only clips that were
13	shown on the national news was the addiction clips.
14	Q. The -- when you read the complaint --
15	A. Uh-huh.
16	Q. -- you saw it alleged boldly and clearly that
17	tobacco companies and their industry spokes people
18	continued, from the '50s onward, to state publicly
19	that in fact nobody knew whether or not cigarette
20	smoking caused cancer? You saw that?
21	A. I saw that in the complaint, yes.
22	Q. And you did not ask any of those twenty-four
23	lawyers sitting around that big table in Chicago
24	whether you could just go with your research
25	assistants for one day into the Minnesota Repository
1	to determine whether or not that statement was true?
2	A. That is correct. I didn't ask.
3	Q. We've already established that you and the
4	people of America and Minnesota, knew beyond a doubt,
5	beyond the mid '50s, that it causes cancer; correct?
6	A. By then the consensus of the opinion, both
7	scientific and others, was that it did, yes.
8	Q. And if, in fact, the tobacco companies, which
9	you're unaware of from your historical analysis, did
10	repeatedly state publicly that there was at minimum
11	an open question, and a scientific debate about it,
12	if in fact the record would bear that out, then
13	that's a lie, isn't it?
14	A. I have no way of knowing.
15	Q. No way of knowing?
16	A. No. Because I haven't seen that record.
17	Q. But I can ask you to assume, see.
18	A. Pardon?
19	Q. I can ask you to assume and that's okay because
2	0 you're an expert.
21	A. Historians don't assume.
22	Q. I understand, but you're an expert, okay? So I
23	can ask you to do that.
24	A. Historians don't assume. Individuals do.
25	Q. Fine. As an individual, sir, --
1	A. Uh-huh.
2	Q. -- assume that documents would bear that out.
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. That tobacco companies and industry
5	spokes people continued to say for years publicly
6	that there was an open question about whether or not
7	smoking caused cancer. Assume that that's accurate
8	and borne out in the documents and it would be in
9	those documents, if you had looked. If that is what
10	they were saying publicly, that is a lie?
11	A. Define what you mean by a lie. If it's -- you
12	know, --
13	Q. It's a statement?
14	A. If there is still questions about -- if they
15	still have questions about the validity of the
16	findings, they can make that statement.
17	Q. Let's assume --
18	A. I don't have such --
19	Q. I understand you don't.
20	And let's assume further that they didn't. That
21	their internal documents say that not only do
22	Americans know, not only do Minnesotans know, but the
23	English know, and scientists the world over know, and
24	we know, but we're going to continue to say that
25	there's an open controversy. Assume that.
1	A. Okay.
2	What do you want me to say about that?
3	Q. That would be a lie, wouldn't it?
4	A. Could very well be.
5	Q. Pursuant to your moral standard, that would be a
6	lie?
7	A. Yes, that would be.
8	Q. And if you, in the course of offering testimony
9	in this case, came in here and rendered an opinion,
10	or attempted to render an opinion on something, and
11	you could have and should have discovered the
12	documents on this question that I've just talked
13	about, but that you didn't, --
14	A. Uh-huh.
15	Q. -- and you offered testimony in a very narrow
16	area, or attempt to, then you also can be supporting
17	that lie?
18	A. Not true. In fact, an outright falsehood.
19	Q. We'll talk more about that. Because you told me
20	earlier that you would have the integrity, if you
21	determined that you were supporting a lie, to stand
22	up and say so; correct?
23	A. That is correct.
24	Q. And now, when you go to lunch are you going to
25	demand to see the documents --
1	A. No.
2	Q. -- that I have stated exist?
3	A. No.
4	Q. Okay. Are you aware, sir, that nicotine in
5	cigarettes, the level of it, can be controlled up and
6	down?
7	A. I've seen such statements, allegations made,
8	yes.
9	Q. Are you aware of whether that's true or not?
10	A. Pardon me?
11	Q. Are you aware of --
12	A. I have no way of knowing that.
13	Q. You didn't do any historical analysis of that?
14	A. No. Not at all.
15	Q. Did you -- are you aware that without nicotine
16	that people would not be addicted and would very
17	likely not smoke and that cigarette companies are
18	aware of that and have stated that?
19	A. I'm aware and -- that it's been known
20	historically for many, many years that that is the
21	case. That nicotine was the agent that causes people
22	to be hooked to smoking and tobacco.
23	Q. Are you familiar, as a historian, of the concept
24	of cognitive dissidence, sir?
25	A. Cognitive dissidence? I think so.
1	Q. What is it?
2	A. I can't define it, but I know what it means, I
3	think, you know.
4	Q. Have you looked at it in relationship to this
5	case and the issues in this case?
6	A. No.
7	Q. Have you looked at it in relationship to
8	rationalization or denial by smokers?
9	A. No.
10	Q. No idea, then, as to what cognitive dissidence
11	means in the context of the tobacco industry?
12	A. Not specifically, no.
13	Q. Are you, sir, familiar with studies in the
14	course of your historical analysis that report
15	that half of all smokers who undergo surgery for
16	lung cancer return to smoking?
17	A. I've not seen such a statement, but it wouldn't
18	surprise me.
19	Q. Well, did you ask your people to look at that
20	when they went to the Diehl Library?
21	A. No.
22	Q. Did you do a thorough review of the medical
23	literature when you went to the Diehl Library, from a
24	historical --
25	A. We did a thorough review of not the medical
1	literature so much, as the public health literature.
2	Remember, that we are not practicing physicians or
3	scientists.
4	Q. All right. Nor are you trained as public health
5	people?
6	A. No. But the public health issue, at least, is a
7	kind of public issue that historians are concerned
8	with.
9	Q. Behind public health is science?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. Intense science?
12	A. By all means.
13	Q. Huh?
14	A. By all means, yes.
15	Q. Yes.
16	Are you -- did you become familiar, as a public
17	health issue, there was a study in 1990 that said
18	84.3% of those people who smoke a pack or more of
19	cigarettes a day have tried unsuccessfully to reduce
20	the number of cigarettes they smoke?
21	A. I'm not familiar with that particular study, no.
22	Q. You didn't run across that in your public health
23	review?
24	A. No. We may have, but I don't recall it, yes.
25	Q. Did you find out what are the most advertised
1	brands?
2	A. Pardon me?
3	Q. Did you find out what are the most advertised
4	brands when you did your historical analysis?
5	A. We did not, you know, measure the advertising
6	copy of each newspaper and see which brand had more
7	ads than others. No, we did not do that.
8	Q. Did you come to any understanding of that
9	through your review of -- whatever you review. Did
10	you review advertising ads?
11	A. We couldn't avoid it.
12	Q. Because they were all over the place?
13	A. Well, if we were looking through newspaper
14	materials, it's in the newspapers, yes.
15	Q. And so did you, or did your two researchers,
16	comment in any way about what their impression was
17	about what the most advertised brands were?
18	A. No.
19	Q. Didn't look at it?
20	A. Oh, we looked at it. But we had no impression
21	of what -- the most advertised brands, no.
22	Q. Did you come to any historical analysis of which
23	brands kids smoke more than others?
24	A. That was not the question that I was interested
25	in.
1	Q. Have you looked at any correlation studies
2	between money spent on advertising and promotions?
3	A. No.
4	Q. And brands smoked?
5	A. No.
6	Q. It wasn't anything you were interested in
7	either; right?
8	A. No.
9	Q. You saw a lot of Joe Camel ads, I presume?
10	A. Yeah, I've seen quite a few, yes.
11	Q. You've seen them over time yourself?
12	A. Oh, of course. Of course.
13	Q. And based on historical analysis, and thinking
14	about awareness, surely it's your view that it would
15	be kids who would respond to these ads and think of
16	smoking positively; correct?
17	A. I have no idea. I assume so.
18	Q. You assume so as --
19	A. As an individual. Not as a historian.
20	Q. But also as an individual and historian and
21	somebody who is rendering -- attempting to render
22	opinions on awareness, --
23	A. Uh-huh.
24	Q. -- you would be aware, as a historian, --
25	A. Yes.
1	Q. -- that a new, broad-based campaign, such as
2	Joe Camel, would create certain levels of awareness
3	in kids about the positive aspects of smoking; right?
4	A. I have no way of knowing that.
5	Q. You would assume that's accurate?
6	A. I assume.
7	Q. As an individual?
8	A. But I have no way of knowing that.
9	Q. You've not done any studies on that?
10	A. I've not done any studies on advertising and its
11	impacts, no.
12	Q. But what you have done is made conclusions about
13	the impacts of press articles?
14	A. Of what?
15	Q. Press articles.
16	A. More than press articles.
17	Q. Things --
18	A. Among other things.
19	Q. Things stated in the press, of things stated in
20	pamphlets, --
21	A. Uh-huh.
22	Q. -- of things stated in other places, you have
23	made conclusions about?
24	A. That's correct.
25	Q. The statements that are made in advertising
1	billboards and/or promotional activities, may in fact
2	be more powerful than a Boy Scouts' pamphlet or a
3	press article; correct?
4	A. It could be, but I doubt it.
5	Q. It can be more powerful by way of color and
6	impact, and on and on; you understand that, right?
7	A. Yes. That could be.
8	Q. So when you make -- say that you assume that
9	advertising has an impact, that's the same assumption
10	that you have to make with respect to the historical
11	analysis?
12	A. No.
13	Q. Because that's what you're doing.
14	A. It's not.
15	Q. Because --
16	A. It's not. Quite different.
17	Q. Okay. Go right ahead and explain.
18	A. All right.
19	When I make the historical analysis it's based
20	on overwhelming evidence of all kinds, of which
21	advertising is a part.
22	And I have made no independent study of
23	advertising and its impact thereon.
24	Furthermore, the awareness of the health hazards
25	of smoking were so deeply engrained in the culture,
1	that the advertising would have, I think, only
2	minimal impact, except in terms of perhaps cognitive
3	dissidence, if that's the point you wanted to make
4	before. But that's my -- my basic conclusion.
5	Q. That's your personal opinion?
6	A. My personal opinion.
7	Q. Because you just don't know?
8	A. Right. Exactly.
9	Q. Have you ever worked with an advertising
10	company?
11	A. No.
12	Q. Outside ad agency?
13	A. Never.
14	Q. Ever worked with any of the advertising
15	marketing experts at the University?
16	A. No.
17	Q. Are you aware, sir, that the cigarette
18	companies, all of them, actively pursue new smokers
19	in an attempt to continue to gain market share from
20	new, young, under-eighteen smokers?
21	A. Am I aware of that?
22	Q. Yes.
23	A. On the basis of my research?
24	Q. Yes, sir.
25	A. No, I'm not aware of that on the basis of my
1	research.
2	Q. You saw it alleged in the complaint?
3	A. I saw it in the complaint, yes.
4	Q. You chose not to do any research on that topic?
5	A. That is correct.
6	Q. You could research that topic, couldn't you?
7	A. If it were part of my research agenda, right.
8	Q. Right. You could have said, based on this
9	complaint, "I'll research this issue about knowledge
10	of Minnesotans, about the health effects of smoking,
11	but I want to be fair here and I also want to
12	research what's alleged -- at least in part alleged
13	in this complaint, and one of the things that
14	disturbs me is that it's alleged that they go after
15	kids to hook them and get them. And I want to
16	research that just to be objective"; you could have
17	said that, couldn't you?
18	A. I could have, but I didn't.
19	Q. And you didn't?
2	0 A. And I wouldn't.
21	Q. And you wouldn't, would you?
22	A. No.
23	Q. Because you let someone else define the issue
24	that you research?
25	A. No.
1	Q. Because when you reviewed the complaint you did
2	not add one additional research item to what was told
3	to you by Ellen Fitzgerald when she called you, did
4	you?
5	A. That is not true.
6	I did not add that to my research agenda for the
7	simple reason that I was not interested in what the
8	cigarette companies did. Period.
9	Q. And you felt it was acceptable for you, as an
10	academic, and as a professional, to not be
11	interested --
12	A. No.
13	Q. -- at all in the tobacco companies; right?
14	A. No.
15	The research question that I was following was,
16	in fact, public knowledge. And what the tobacco
17	companies did or did not do, did or did not reveal,
18	had a minimal bearing, at best, on that particular
19	question.
20	Q. You made that conclusion --
21	A. I made that conclusion.
22	Q. -- before knowing what they knew; right?
23	A. On the basis of my -- of my experience,
24	knowledge, as historian, my experience and knowledge
25	as an individual, over a long period of time, yes,
1	sir.
2	Q. All right.
3	MR. PURVIS: Would this be a good time?
4	MR. MANNING: You name it. Any time is a fine
5	time.
6	(Luncheon recess taken.)
7	BY MR. MANNING:
8	Q. Professor Berman, I'm going to go back and pick
9	up your report and turn to page fourteen, where I'm
10	going to start.
11	It might be easier for you to take that clip
12	off.
13	MR. PURVIS: (Complying.)
14	THE WITNESS: Thank you.
15	THE WITNESS: And fourteen. Okay.
16	BY MR. MANNING:
17	Q. Now you see that you say here on the top of
18	fourteen, end the first -- not the first full
19	paragraph, you talk about "The passage of this bill
20	was the WCTU's longest lasting influence on cigarette
21	and health awareness in light of the fact that from
22	1887 to the present the state of Minnesota has
23	demanded that nearly every Minnesotan is schooled in
24	the hazards of cigarette smoking"; right?
25	A. That's right.
1	Q. You agree that it's hazardous?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And that it has been hazardous since 1887?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. And you have made no attempt to evaluate the
6	effectiveness of this educational program, have you?
7	A. No.
8	Q. You've not gone out and observed it?
9	A. No.
10	Q. You've not seen it in action?
11	A. No.
12	Q. You've not seen it over a period of time?
13	A. No.
14	Q. You've not seen anybody who was -- or talked to
15	anybody who says they were impacted by it?
16	A. No.
17	Q. You've seen no statistical evidence that it's
18	effective?
19	A. No.
20	Q. Nor have you seen anything about it other than
21	that it exists?
22	A. Oh, I've seen some of the text materials that we
23	used. I've seen some of the film clips that we use
24	and stuff like that, yes.
25	Q. You've seen things that tell you that it exists?
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. All right. And you go down in your next
3	paragraph. You say, "The fact that these slang terms
4	were so widely used... " Do you see that?
5	A. Uh-huh.
6	Q. How do you know whether they were widely used?
7	That's a value judgment? That's a subjective
8	judgment, correct?
9	A. Based on, of course, an examination of the
10	cultural artifacts and literature of the time, yes.
11	Q. Specifically show me what you reviewed in your
12	report that showed you, as a historian, that those
13	terms were, as you say, so widely used?
14	A. It's found throughout the literature of the
15	time, both in the --
16	Q. Show them to me.
17	A. -- contemporary literature and the press.
18	Q. Show them to me. That's what I'm asking you.
19	A. I can't specifically show you.
20	Q. Those were in your six drawers, right?
21	A. I don't know if they're in the six drawers or
22	not. They're in the popular literature, in
23	Mark Twain's writings, and the writings of various
24	different authors of the time and so on.
25	Q. Did you count the number of times --
1	A. No.
2	Q. -- that you saw the words "coffin nails" and
3	where they were used?
4	A. No, I have not counted.
5	Q. Did you count the number of times you saw the
6	words "cancer sticks," and where they were used, by
7	who, et cetera?
8	A. No, I haven't counted that.
9	Q. Did you count the number of times "little white
10	hearse plumes" were used? Had you ever heard that
11	before?
12	A. Oh, of course.
13	Q. I hadn't. But did you count that one?
14	A. Yes -- no, I haven't counted that one.
15	Q. Did you count "little white slavers"?
16	A. No.
17	Q. How many times that was used and when and over
18	what historical time?
19	A. Throughout the period that I've examined, I've
20	seen that term used.
21	Q. Right up until the '90s?
22	A. No. Up until the '30s, the '40s, and '50s.
23	Q. You, without counting, without being able to
24	identify the source, other than Mark Twain,
25	anybody -- any other sources besides Mark Twain?
1	A. Numerous sources.
2	Q. But you can't tell me?
3	A. No, I can't because there's so many.
4	Q. But you can't tell me one, even though there's
5	so many, you can't tell this jury, other than
6	Mark Twain, one place that you, as the expert here,
7	self-proclaimed, can tell me where these were used?
8	A. Sure. Many places.
9	In the Minnesota White Ribbon. It periodically
10	appears in the White Ribbon.
11	It periodically appears in the journals of the
12	Women's Christian Temperance Union.
13	It periodically appears in the writings of -- of
14	Bernarr MacFadden.
15	It periodically appears in the writings of
16	Henry Ford.
17	It... It was used widely in the folk tales, folk
18	literature.
19	Q. Which ones?
20	A. All different kinds of folk tales and folk
21	literature that was widely spread throughout the time
22	and reported in the press, in magazines, things like
23	that. It's quite, quite widely used.
24	Q. The folk tales themselves were reported? Or the
25	fact that these words were being used in the
1	folk tale was reported?
2	A. No. The folk tales themselves included these
3	words.
4	Q. So the fact that somebody may have reported on a
5	folk tale in the press doesn't mean that they
6	incorporated the words used in the folk tale, do
7	they?
8	A. Oh, I've seen some of the folk tales,
9	as well. I've read some of the folk tales.
10	Q. That's not what I'm asking.
11	A. Yes. Please ask the question again.
12	Q. You cannot identify one folk tale, besides
13	Mark Twain?
14	A. Mark Twain is not a folk tale.
15	Q. Well, then what are you saying is? Tell me
16	which ones are.
17	A. Folk tale? How to define it.
18	A folk tale is a popular tale that makes the
19	rounds of society that come out of the cultural
20	awareness and the cultural presence of a particular
21	moment in history.
22	Q. Published or not?
23	A. It could be published.
24	Q. It could not?
25	A. It could be. It could be oral tradition. Or it
1	could be published, yes.
2	Q. But you've now identified for me the Minnesota
3	White Ribbon?
4	A. Uh-huh.
5	Q. What's that?
6	A. That is a publication that began in the 1890s
7	and continued through the 1950s out of -- if I'm not
8	mistaken, Moorhead, Minnesota, that was the
9	publication of one of the anti-tobacco groups.
10	Q. Do you have any idea how widespread a
11	publication that originated in Moorhead, Minnesota,
12	was by way of reaching all Minnesotans?
13	A. It was, of course, spread throughout Minnesota,
14	so far as I can tell, at the time --
15	Q. Do you ever any idea --
16	A. No, I have no idea of the extent of it, no.
17	Q. Correct.
18	Those are the dates.
19	The Temperance Union, --
20	A. The Women's Christian Temperance Union.
21	Q. Yes. What are their dates?
22	A. The Women's Christian Temperance Union -- 1870s,
23	approximately, to the 1950s or '60s.
24	Q. And how many people would read their
25	publications?
1	A. They had a wide circulation.
2	Q. Yeah? All Minnesotans?
3	A. All over the country, including Minnesota.
4	Q. You made no determination to know how many
5	people in Minnesota read publications of the Women's
6	Christian Temperance Union?
7	A. I did not make that determination because I'm
8	not sure whether I could find such.
9	Q. So you have no idea?
10	A. Except it was widespread. That's all I know.
11	Q. You don't have any idea how many Minnesotans
12	read it?
13	A. No.
14	Q. MacFadden, what's that?
15	A. Bernarr MacFadden was an editor and publisher of
16	good health, of body-building kind of materials,
17	things of that nature. Very well known and very,
18	very popular in the inner war period.
19	Q. What years?
20	A. The inner war being World War I and
21	World War II?
22	Q. Okay. I to II?
23	A. Pardon me?
24	Q. I to II? World War I to World War II?
25	A. Yes.
1	Q. Okay. Henry Ford, what were his dates?
2	A. Henry Ford, of course, was born in the late
3	nineteenth century, middle nineteenth century. Died
4	in the 1940s, I believe. Was, of course, well known
5	for his pioneering in the automobile industry. But,
6	in addition to that, he was very much involved in the
7	anti-tobacco --
8	Q. Right.
9	A. -- movement.
10	Q. Right.
11	A. And through the Dearborn Independent, which was
12	his publication that he put out in Dearborn,
13	Michigan, --
14	Q. Do you think that reached Minnesota?
15	A. Yes, I'm sure it reached Minnesota.
16	Q. Widely circulated here, too, and widely read?
17	A. I don't know how widely circulated, but it
18	reached Minnesota.
19	Q. You have no idea how many people read that in
20	Minnesota?
21	So, so far you've not identified for me, even
22	though you have opined in this report to a court of
23	law, the fact that these slang terms were so widely
24	used indicates a common knowledge -- there's not one
25	thing that you've indicated to me that goes beyond
1	1950; correct?
2	A. I'm sorry.
3	Q. There is not one thing that you have indicated
4	to me, that this statement is based on, that goes
5	beyond 1950, is there?
6	A. I have seen these references more in the
7	literature prior to 1950 than I have since 1950. I
8	cannot tell you exactly, no.
9	Q. The only ones you've cited me, and I've asked
10	you to give me every one of them, are all prior to
11	1950. If you remember any others, tell me.
12	A. I don't recall any.
13	Q. Thank you.
14	And so the point is that you're willing to make
15	a bald statement here in this paragraph that, "The
16	fact that these slang terms were so widely used
17	indicates a common knowledge of the health risks and
18	addictive qualities of cigarettes."
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Right?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And you're willing to say that as a historian
23	with no time limitation on it?
24	A. That is correct.
2	5 Q. Thank you.
1	And in your view that goes right up till today?
2	A. That goes right up till today.
3	Q. Even though there may be all kinds of people who
4	have never heard of a little white hearse plume
5	before; right?
6	A. That is correct.
7	Q. Even though there's all kinds of people that may
8	not have heard of little white slavers?
9	A. That is right.
10	Q. So you as a historian think that that awareness
11	goes on even though those people who were living in
12	1950 might be dead?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. Yeah. Okay.
15	And some of them might be dead from smoking
16	cigarettes; right?
17	A. That's possible.
18	Q. Little coffin nails, huh?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Yes.
21	A. As a matter of fact, coffin nails, now that I
22	recall, appeared in an editorial in the
23	Minneapolis Tribune dealing with the cigarette case.
24	Just recently. If I can't give you the exact date.
25	Q. The foundation for your opinion that these were
1	widely used, and indicates a common knowledge, is
2	based on four publications and folk tales and
3	literature whose dates end in 1950, but for the
4	Minneapolis Star Trib editorial that you've
5	identified; correct?
6	A. That's correct. Among others.
7	Q. All right.
8	A. Remember, this is not an exercise in memory. I
9	can't recall everything I've seen.
10	Q. I understand that, sir.
11	But you do understand -- in all these ten
12	meetings that you had with these lawyers, you clearly
13	understood that any opinion that you attempted to
14	express in a court of law was to be supported?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. Scientifically supported?
17	A. That is correct.
18	Q. From a historical perspective?
19	A. That is correct.
20	Q. Not anecdotally?
21	A. That is correct.
22	Q. Not just what you saw?
23	A. That is correct.
24	Q. And, once again, this such wide, common
25	knowledge -- now you're talking about America, now;
1	right?
2	A. What reference is to that?
3	Q. "The fact that these slang terms were so widely
4	used indicates a common knowledge..."?
5	A. Oh yes.
6	Q. You're talking about the addictive qualities of
7	cigarettes, you're talking about America?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. And, again, if anyone denied that common
10	knowledge of the addictive qualities and health risks
11	of cigarettes, they wouldn't be -- that wouldn't be
12	true, would it?
13	A. It wouldn't be believed.
14	Q. That's right. Because the truth, as you're
15	telling us historically, is that, one, they were
16	addictive, and, two, lots of people knew it?
17	A. Uh-huh.
18	Q. Right?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. But clearly the first part of that, they were
21	addictive, is true, in your mind? And anybody who
22	would contradict that would be stating a falsehood?
23	A. First part of your question, yes.
24	Q. Then you go on to say, on page fifteen, in the
25	beginning, after you're talking about Goofy, you say
1	there, in the middle, "Audiences laughed because they
2	were already aware of the lessons depicted"; right?
3	A. Uh-huh.
4	Q. As a historian, sir, don't you agree that you
5	cannot tell us why audiences laughed? You can't do
6	that? Come on.
7	A. Historical evidence can be used to make such
8	conclusions.
9	Q. Let's keep at it.
10	A. Uh-huh.
11	Q. Do you think your credibility would be more
12	enhanced in this litigation if you withdrew that
13	statement, or are you going to stick by it?
14	A. I'll stick by it.
15	Q. You're going to stick by that you, Hyman Berman,
16	as a historian at the University of Minnesota, are
17	willing to state, under oath, --
18	What year -- what year were these audiences
19	laughing?
20	A. The Goofy cartoon?
21	Q. Yeah.
22	A. If I'm not mistaken, that was early '50s.
23	Q. Did you see the cartoon?
24	A. Yes, I did.
25	Q. You watched it?
1	A. Yes, I did.
2	Q. Out of those Vanderbilt archives?
3	A. I don't recall where I got the copy of it.
4	Q. Did you laugh?
5	A. I was too busy analyzing it to laugh.
6	Q. Was it funny?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. What was funny about it?
9	A. What was funny was the impossible and almost
10	un- -- the -- well, the impossible way it was to
11	break the habit.
12	Q. Because he was addicted?
13	A. Because he was addicted.
14	Q. And he runs around and he goes so far as to try
15	to cut off his arm?
16	A. That's right.
17	Q. To quit?
18	A. That's right.
19	Q. Because even at that time you were aware there
20	were people who would have their entire larynx and
21	esophagus taken out and they'd still find a way to
22	smoke; right?
23	A. That's right.
24	Q. And that's not funny, is it?
25	A. Not funny at all.
1	Q. And it's not funny if you really did cut your
2	arm off to try to quit smoking, if you were that
3	desperate; right?
4	A. Not at all. That's correct.
5	Q. And you've even seen historical accounts where
6	some people even say that they're almost willing to
7	go that far, they're so desperate, they want to quit
8	smoking and can't; right?
9	A. I haven't seen such accounts, but I'm sure that
10	they exist.
11	Q. Right.
12	And, in fact, the reason that people laugh is
13	not because they're aware of something. They laugh
14	because rather than cry at the horror of what they're
15	looking at, something is being made fun of the
16	horror; right? You'd agree with that?
17	A. I think so, yes.
18	Q. You'd agree with that?
19	A. Yeah.
20	Q. Sure. So that's as plausible a reason as to why
21	people laughed, as they laughed, because they were
22	already aware of the lessons depicted?
23	A. What you're saying is essentially what I am
24	saying.
25	Q. Yeah.
1	Except part of the charge that you had in the
2	way the question was defined to you by Ellen
3	Fitzgerald, via the lawyers from the tobacco
4	industry, was to do the historical analysis and take
5	a look at awareness, wasn't it?
6	A. No.
7	Q. Okay. Tell me.
8	A. The question was: Would I do research on the
9	topic of when and how the Minnesotans -- whether,
10	when, and how Minnesotans were aware of the health
11	hazards of smoking. That was the original
12	formulation.
13	Q. Whether, when, and how --
14	A. Yeah.
15	Q. -- knowledge of health risks of smoking?
16	A. Right.
17	Q. Right?
18	A. Right.
19	Q. And one of those ways that you told me is that
20	you would look at how people became aware of --
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. -- the health risks of smoking?
23	A. Uh-huh.
24	Q. And you understood that early on in your
25	question, your issue, your definition, --
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. -- that awareness was a word you were thinking
3	about?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Yeah. And so in your historical protocol, when
6	you wrote your report and you watched Goofy running
7	around, being willing to cut off his right arm, you
8	concluded, empirically, that audiences laughed
9	because they were already aware of the lessons
10	learned; correct?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. And then you went on and you cite to us,
13	Tex William's song. Did you listen to it?
14	A. Yes, I've heard that song.
15	Q. Back then or recently?
16	A. Back then. I don't know if I've listened to it
17	recently. But I recall it from back then.
18	Q. Did it make fun of cigarette smoking?
19	A. I don't think it made fun of cigarette smoking.
20	It was, in fact, a kind of statement of the
21	ubiquitous nature and the difficulty of breaking the
22	habit, yes.
23	Q. Yeah.
24	A. I don't think it was funny in that sense, no.
25	Q. Did you become aware that, in fact, that song
1	supported the smoking habit?
2	A.	Pardon me?
3	Q.	Did it support the smoking habit?
4	A.	No.
5	Q.	It just showed how difficult it was to quit?
6	A.	Yes.
7	Q.	In your view?
8	A.	Yes.
9	Q.	What was it? You note it here. What does it
10	do?	This coverage was not limited to film, you say,
11	but extended to all forms of media.
12	A.	Uh-huh.
13	I'm sorry?
14	Q.	Do you think -- do you think the song helped
15	tell people that cigarettes cause cancer? Is that
16	what you think it did?
17	A.	Well, it certainly gave the impression that it
18	was not something good for them, yes.
19	Q.	Did it in any way glamorize smoking?
20	A.	No.
21	Q.	Did it promote it in any way in your view?
22	A.	No.
23	Q.	Absolutely not?
24	A.	No.
25	Q.	Impossible?
1	A. Right.
2	Q. And that's your view?
3	A. That's my view.
4	Q. Okay. You then say on page sixteen on the
5	bottom of the first paragraph there, "In one stroke
6	this pamphlet integrated the anti-tobacco arguments
7	of health, morals, and ethics"; correct?
8	A. I am sorry.
9	Dealing with what? The first paragraph?
10	Q. The last line of the first paragraph.
11	A. Oh, dealing with Professor Zellany's pamphlet.
12	Q. Correct.
13	A. Okay. I want to put it in context, so I know
14	what you mean. Yes. Okay.
15	Q. And this is a pamphlet he's writing on race
16	deterioration; is that right?
17	A. That is correct.
18	Q. This pamphlet integrated the arguments of
19	health, morals, and ethics?
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. And you agree that those arguments exist?
22	A. They did exist, yes.
23	Q. And still do?
24	A. Still do.
25	Q. Health, morality, and ethics?
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. Related to smoking; correct?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. Do you know how wide this article was published?
5	A. It was widely disseminated within Minnesota.
6	How widely it was disseminated outside, I do not
7	know.
8	Q. Now, then, you go on, on the bottom there,
9	Dr. Moses Barron at the U of M, he brings all his
10	students in to show them an autopsy of a lung
11	cadaver; right?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. And it was cancerous?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And physicians are condemning the habit, right?
16	A. Uh-huh.
17	Q. And are you aware of whether or not the tobacco
18	companies did any research to look at cadaverous
19	cancerous lungs?
20	A. I have no knowledge of that.
21	Q. None?
22	A. None.
23	Q. Did you ask anybody about that?
24	A. No.
25	Q. Never asked?
1	A. No.
2	Q. Just this one guy here at the University of
3	Minnesota, if he did it, then your view is there's
4	some enhanced awareness with those medical students
5	on the part of the state of Minnesota; is that right?
6	A. Yes. Yes.
7	Q. And the reason there's enhanced knowledge on the
8	part of the state of Minnesota is there was some
9	medical students that went in and looked at that
10	cadaverous cancerous lung in the 1920s; and so your
11	view is, because those Minnesotans looked at that
12	cadaver, in this lawsuit the state of Minnesota has
13	enhanced knowledge about cancer?
14	A. Not only about that, but that was one factor,
15	yes.
16	Q. What else does it have knowledge about about
17	cancer?
18	A. Oh certainly, what -- we're dealing here with
19	the first evidence of a cancerous lung uncovered by a
20	medical practitioner in the state of Minnesota,
21	Dr. Moses Barron.
22	Q. How do you know that?
23	A. The literature tells me that.
24	Q. Do you know when the first cadaverous cancerous
25	lung was uncovered by the tobacco industry?
1	A. No, I have no idea.
2	Q. Did you ask them?
3	A. No.
4	Q. No interest -- again, just not interested in
5	their knowledge about that?
6	A. That is not my research design.
7	Q. You're right.
8	By your design?
9	A. By my design.
10	Q. And then you make that statement there, "By the
11	'50s cigarette smoking was increasingly
12	scientifically linked as a cause of specific
13	diseases, and the scientific community focused on the
14	specific health hazards of smoking on the heart,
15	lungs, and other vital organs"; right?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. You go down in the next paragraph. "After the
18	'50s, additional concrete examples of smoking and
19	heart disease, larynx cancer, and lung cancer were
20	brought to public light through scientific research
21	and such research was published in the national and
22	local Minnesota press"; correct?
23	A. That is correct.
24	Q. "Scientific coverage reached well beyond the
25	print media, however, and was reported through
1	broadcast journalism and reports as well"; right?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Therefore, if you, as a manufacturer, had
4	knowledge not only of this, of what is occurring
5	publicly, but you have your own scientific knowledge
6	that all of this is true, what you just said, which I
7	won't repeat, but causes cancer, heart disease,
8	et cetera, then to deny it is wrong?
9	A. That's a hypothetical question. But, of course,
10	I'd answer it in terms of my view as an individual,
11	not a historian.
12	Q. Yes.
13	A. That is, of course, it's wrong.
14	Q. Of course it's wrong?
15	A. Of course. If the premise of your question is
16	correct.
17	Q. And the reason that it's a hypothetical, is that
18	you have never looked at what the tobacco companies
19	knew in order to not make it a hypothetical?
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. So there's certain things when you walk in here
22	today, you're kind of smart?
23	A. No.
24	Q. And there's a lot of things in here when you
25	walk in today that you just don't know?
1	A. Oh, the question has to do with the tobacco
2	companies' materials.
3	Q. Right.
4	A. I was not -- that was not my interest to do
5	research in the tobacco industry.
6	Q. Do you think it is ethical on the part of a
7	professor, at any institution, let alone a public
8	institution as great as the University of Minnesota,
9	but do you think it's ethical on the part of any
10	academic, anywhere in America, to take a look in a
11	lawsuit that involves two sides -- it was clear to
12	you that there were two sides; right?
13	A. (Nodding.)
14	Q. You saw the title?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. And narrow your research question so that it, by
17	design, can only involve one, narrow aspect of one?
18	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form of the
19	question.
20	BY MR. MANNING:
21	Q. Do you think that's ethical?
22	A. I have no idea what you're driving at.
23	Q. I'm asking you --
24	A. The question I was researching had to do with
25	the public awareness, not the cigarette companies'
1	attitudes and actions. That's for someone else to do
2	research on. Not for me.
3	Q. And that's what I'm asking is you.
4	A. Is it ethical? Yes.
5	Q. You believe it's ethical?
6	A. Certainly. And meets with the standards of
7	historical scholarship as defined by the profession.
8	Q. Where is the profession defined, that when you
9	come into a lawsuit and there's two sides, that you
10	can define an issue so narrowly that you will never
11	look at the behavior or conduct of one group of
12	entities? Where in the profession is that defined?
13	A. I challenge your statement about narrow
14	definition. This is not a narrow definition. This
15	is a definition of what the people of Minnesota knew,
16	when they knew it, how they knew it. What the state
17	knew, when it knew it, and what it did about it.
18	That is the broadest definition I could think of.
19	If you in your narrow view want to bring in the
20	tobacco companies, please do so. That's not my
21	research design.
22	Q. By design --
23	A. Some other historian may want to do that. That
24	is not my research design.
25	Q. And you do know that there were people working
1	for the tobacco companies in Minnesota?
2	A. By working for them you mean there were tobacco
3	merchants? Yes. I knew that.
4	Q. Residents who worked for the tobacco companies
5	who lived in Minnesota?
6	A. I assume so. I don't know that for a fact.
7	Q. You don't know that?
8	A. Not for a fact, no.
9	Q. All right.
10	A. But I assume that there are.
11	Q. And they would be Minnesotans, too?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. And they might have some special knowledge about
14	this issue that you've defined by design; right?
15	A. I have no way of knowing that.
16	Q. I understand.
17	You didn't define that into your question
18	either, did you?
19	A. Individuals? No, I never defined individuals.
20	Q. You then say on page eighteen, top sentence,
21	"The Hennepin County chapter of the American Cancer
22	Society also produced a color film strip for children
23	that unambiguously linked smoking and terminal
24	diseases."
25	A. That is correct.
1	Q. What year was that?
2	A. That was in 1961 or '62. It was prior to the --
3	the surgeon general's report of '64.
4	Q. So prior to the surgeon general's report there
5	was at least a document here that in your
6	characterization unambiguously linked smoking and
7	terminal diseases such as cancer?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. And, once again, if the entities who made those
10	very products, denied that unambiguous link, that
11	would be false, wouldn't it?
12	A. Sorry?
13	Q. That would be false?
14	A. You would have to ask them.
15	Q. And you didn't ask them?
16	A. No.
17	Q. All you know is that there was an unambiguous
18	link between smoking and terminal diseases that was
19	abundantly clear in your view?
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. And if someone was denying that, they would be
22	wrong? Because culture had adopted it in your view;
23	correct?
24	A. The American Cancer Society, Hennepin County
25	branch, had adopted it and it was used widely in
1	schools, yes.
2	Q. So if anybody, I don't care who it is, disagreed
3	with it -- if my next-door neighbor said, "They must
4	be wrong. I'm just going to continue to smoke," he
5	would be wrong? That was an unambiguous link?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Right?
8	A. (Nodding.)
9	Q. And if the tobacco companies put out anything to
10	support my next-door neighbor in his belief, that the
11	link was ambiguous, and it wasn't unambiguous, if
12	they supported that, and tried to, and had meetings
13	about how to, then that would be wrong, wouldn't it?
14	A. Yes, it would be. Speaking now as an
15	individual, not as a historian.
16	Q. Now -- and then on page twenty, sir.
17	A. Sorry?
18	Q. Page twenty.
19	A. Twenty?
20	Q. "A year after the surgeon general's report on
21	smoking was published in 1964... "
22	A. Yeah, I got it.
2	3	Q. Thank you.
24	"...the Minnesota Department of Education
25	updated the curriculum by adding additional language
1	stating that tobacco is the 'primary cause of lung
2	and laryngeal cancer'"; correct?
3	A. Yes. That's correct.
4	Q. And you don't disagree with that?
5	A. Pardon me?
6	Q. And you don't disagree with that?
7	A. Oh no.
8	Q. And, again, in your view, the Department of
9	Education was only doing what was proper by calling
10	this the primary cause; right?
11	A. I believe so, yes.
12	Q. And if anyone continues now, after 1964, after
13	all the scientific studies come out in the '50s, and
14	after the surgeon general pronounces in '64, and
15	after the Minnesota Department of Education refers to
16	it as, quote, "primary cause," end quote, if anyone
17	would continue to do anything to put out information
18	to suggest that it wasn't the primary cause, that
19	would be wrong, wouldn't it?
20	A. I assume so, yes.
21	Q. Now, let's go to twenty-one here.
22	A. Twenty-one?
23	Q. Please.
24	A. Uh-huh.
25	Q. You say in your paragraph, "Based on another
1	poll, the Minneapolis Tribune reported in '64 and
2	again in '65 that 80% of all Minnesotans believe
3	cigarettes to be a hazard to health, which was called
4	a phenomenal figure in polling annals.
5	Comparatively, less than 60% of freshmen knew when
6	the Civil War was fought, who the American
7	President..." et cetera.
8	A. Right.
9	Q. Now, do you know what the cigarette companies
10	were doing in 1964 and '65 by way of marketing and
11	responding to this issue?
12	A. No.
13	Q. No idea?
14	A. No idea.
15	Q. Do you have any idea when filtered cigarettes
16	were introduced?
17	A. I believe in the 1950s.
18	Q. Do you have any idea when Kent was introduced
19	and took a huge upsurge?
20	A. Yes. That was probably the late '50s and into
21	the '60s, yes.
22	Q. Right around this time, you'd say?
23	A. About -- around this time, yes.
24	Q. Are you aware of whether or not the tobacco
25	companies attempted to respond to the health scare of
1	cigarettes at all?
2	A. I'm aware of the fact that they started
3	introducing low tar and nicotine cigarettes as a
4	response to the health scare, yes.
5	Q. What are you aware of about that?
6	A. Well, the historical record from the newspaper
7	accounts, journal accounts, articles, and so on, tell
8	of the widespread introduction of new brands -- brand
9	names -- not brand names -- but brand names that were
10	put forward as low tar and low nicotine cigarettes.
11	Q. Uh-huh. And was that directly in response to
12	the health scare, do you know?
13	A. I don't know.
14	Q. You don't know?
15	A. I assume so.
16	Q. You assume so?
17	A. I assume so, but I don't know for a fact.
18	Q. You never looked at the documents and you never
19	talked to anybody in the tobacco company, so you
20	wouldn't know?
21	A. No.
22	Q. All you know is that there was filtered
23	cigarettes. There were filtered cigarettes being
24	introduced about this time?
25	A. Yes.
1	Q. Do you have any idea whether they were
2	successful?
3	A. I have no idea what level of success they
4	reached.
5	Q. Do you have any idea what impact they had on the
6	American consumer and their knowledge about smoking
7	and cancer and addiction?
8	A. It reenforced their knowledge of the health
9	hazards of smoking.
10	Q. That's your view?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. That the filter cigarette -- make sure I
13	understand that. Your view of the filtered cigarette
14	introduction was that it reenforced the American
15	people's attitude about cigarette smoking being
16	unhealthy?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Did it in any way promote smoking because it was
19	now much less dangerous and impacted health far less
20	because there were filters that were taking out tar
21	and other negative things?
22	A. It could have.
23	Q. Did it?
24	A. I don't recall the exact figures of the
25	cigarette production from year-to-year at that time.
1	But it could have.
2	Q. But you don't know?
3	A. I don't know.
4	Q. So if it did, then in fact the introduction of
5	filtered cigarettes may have had the opposite
6	effect? In other words, it may have had the effect
7	that people believed they were safe, as opposed to
8	people thinking cigarette smoking was harmful,
9	particularly if it was advertised as safe; wouldn't
10	you agree?
11	A. It could.
12	Q. But you didn't look at that, did you?
13	A. Well, I saw the specifics on this in the various
14	documents that I looked at. But in terms of its
15	impact on cigarette consumption, no.
16	Q. But if the tobacco companies were studying, not
17	only the impact of filtered cigarettes on
18	consumption, but if they were also studying impact of
19	the advertising and the way they introduced a new
20	product, a new filter cigarette, in order to continue
21	to have people smoke, retain market share, and on and
22	on, the only way to know that would be to talk to the
23	tobacco companies, wouldn't it?
24	A. If that were my research project, yes.
25	Q. Wouldn't be in the public domain, would it?
1	A. Pardon?
2	Q. It wouldn't be in the public domain?
3	A. About advertising and the impact?
4	Q. Correct.
5	A. I have no idea where that would be.
6	Q. And you don't have any idea whether it would be
7	in the tobacco company documents?
8	A. No.
9	Q. You never asked?
10	A. Pardon me?
11	Q. You never asked?
12	A. No.
13	Q. Have you ever heard of free nicotine?
14	A. Sorry?
15	Q. Have you ever heard of free nicotine?
16	A. Free nicotine?
17	Q. Yeah.
18	A. I have some vague recollection of hearing that,
19	but I have no idea what that means at the present
2	0 moment.
21	Q. What is it?
22	A. Huh?
23	Q. What is your vague recollection?
24	A. I have a vague recollection of seeing that in
25	connection with some kind of report about cigarettes
1	and nicotine. I have no idea what it means, frankly.
2	Q. So in your historical analysis, again, you have
3	no idea about the issue of free nicotine and what
4	cigarette companies were doing to pH levels in
5	cigarettes to impact nicotine addiction levels or
6	anything else?
7	A. I am not an expert in science, technology,
8	medicine, or any of these areas. So I wouldn't
9	know. I wouldn't know how to evaluate it.
10	Q. So if there's one or ten Minnesotans out there
11	who you think in 197O are aware of health hazards,
12	let's say, of smoking, okay? Let's assume that. You
13	think a lot of Minnesotans were aware of it, right?
14	A. In the 197Os?
15	Q. Yeah.
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. But you have no idea how many of those
18	Minnesotans who may be smokers, one who were
19	addicted; right?
20	A. Pardon?
21	Q. One, who were addicted? You have no idea how
22	many were?
23	A. No.
24	Q. You have no idea how many were being manipulated
25	with nicotine levels that weren't disclosed to them
1	to enhance their addiction, do you?
2	A. I have no idea of that, no.
3	Q. Then on page twenty-three there was an
4	interesting little D-Day activity in 1985 --
5	A. Yeah.
6	Q. -- that you took particular note of, where the
7	Minnesota press reported on a mock trial finding and
8	said, quote, "The tobacco industry guilty of killing
9	three hundred fifty thousand Americans a year"?
10	A. Annually.
11	Q. Annually. That means a year, right?
12	A. Uh-huh.
13	Q. And "The Tobacco Mafia guilty of costing the
14	country billions of dollars in health-care costs,
15	loss of productivity in the work place, and property
16	damage from fires"; right?
17	A. Yes. That's correct.
18	Q. That was quoted in the St. Paul Pioneer Press,
19	correct?
20	A. That is correct.
21	Q. Do you know how many Americans every year die
22	from smoking cigarettes?
23	A. I assume that figure of three hundred fifty
24	thousand is accurate.
25	Q. As a historian do you think that the level of
1	awareness of the American people would change if
2	executives, CEOs of five tobacco companies stood up
3	together and stated that we must tell you that we
4	have known and know today that our product is in fact
5	causing three hundred fifty thousand deaths a year
6	and we together must do something to stop this? Do
7	you think it would have some impact?
8	A. Would that have changed the awareness you
9	asked?
10	Q. Would it have -- that's right. Would an
11	announcement by those five people be a different
12	level -- connote a different level of awareness than
13	something else?
14	A. As far as I can say -- see, the knowledge of the
15	health hazards of smoking were so widely known that
16	this would not have added very much to the total
17	awareness package.
18	Q. Okay. So that's your view; is that if in fact
19	the tobacco companies would have stood up and the
20	executives themselves would have said exactly what
21	was going on, as I've just described, in a very
22	public way, in your view, and if they said, "And,
23	kids, stop. Stop, kids, because it's going to kill
24	you. One way or the other, it's going to get you,
25	whether it's cancer of the lungs, heart disease, or
1	whatever. Don't get addicted. And we're not going
2	to advertise any more to kids." You don't think that
3	would have impacted the level of awareness in
4	Minnesota?
5	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
6	BY MR. MANNING:
7	Q. Correct?
8	A. I don't think it would have had that much of an
9	impact.
10	Q. Okay. And you've not done anything to determine
11	that, have you?
12	A. No.
13	Q. When you're -- as a person that's dealing with
14	awareness, do you make qualitative value judgments on
15	how much something will impact a degree of awareness
16	versus something else?
17	A. One has to make qualitative judgments. And I
18	mean that's part of the -- part of the process of
19	research, one makes qualitative judgments.
2	0 Q. Right. Right.
21	And you've just made one by stating that you
22	don't think it would make much difference, do you?
23	A. When I use the term qualitative judgments I'm
24	talking in terms of the degree of credibility of a
25	particular source, rather than a statement of this
1	kind.
2	Q. Do you believe that the credibility of the
3	source in this instance, if it were the CEO of a
4	tobacco company, let's say Philip Morris, just to
5	pick one as an example, but illustrative of all the
6	others, standing and stating unequivocally for ten or
7	fifteen minutes what the historical facts are, and
8	what he knows, and what his scientists have known,
9	and what his company has known, and what must happen
10	to save lives, to save our children's lives, do you
11	believe that that would have no greater impact than
12	any other source communicating the same information?
13	A. This did not happen; therefore, I cannot comment
14	on something that did not happen. This history is
15	the -- is the art of discussing what occurred, not
16	what might have occurred, or what should have
17	occurred. I may agree with you that this should have
18	happened. But I can't comment upon that as a
19	historical fact.
20	Q. Should it have happened?
21	A. I think it should have happened perhaps.
22	Q. Should --
23	A. But I'm talking now as an individual.
24	Q. That's fine. That's fine.
25	Why should it have happened in your view?
1	A. It may have been the right thing to do.
2	Q. And would, if it had happened, taking the
3	hypothetical, which you're allowed to do in this
4	court, that in fact would have a greater impact,
5	particularly if done repeatedly, and the message was
6	sent very clearly, would have a greater impact than
7	the Women's Christian Temperance League or the
8	Boy Scouts of America, right, as an example?
9	A. Let me answer your question this way: Not in
10	the hypothetical, but in the actual. That is to say,
11	since they didn't do, then the question is to what
12	degree is that a credible source in this particular
13	case? As against the American Cancer Society, the
14	American Lung Society, the Red Cross, et cetera,
15	et cetera. My answer to that, would be that it is
16	not a credible source.
17	Q. Why is it not a credible source?
18	A. The people didn't think it was a credible
19	source.
20	Q. Who didn't think it was a credible source? The
21	people did not think the tobacco companies were a
22	credible source?
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. How do you know that?
25	A. All of the material regarding health awareness
1	that is generated by the various organizations I
2	mentioned previously are available in public
3	depositories--Wilson Library, Walter Library at the
4	University, et cetera. None of the tobacco company
5	materials are to be found there.
6	Q. Uh-huh. I understand that.
7	A. Uh-huh.
8	MR. MANNING: Read back the question, please,
9	prior to.
10	(Record read.)
11	MR. MANNING: Thank you.
12	BY MR. MANNING:
13	Q. New question. New -- let me ask a new question
14	for the record.
15	A. Okay. Sure.
16	Q. In fact, sir, if the tobacco companies and
17	executives had come forward, it would have been
18	shocking because it would have been different than
19	their public statements before; correct?
20	A. If -- yes.
21	Q. Second, it would have had a huge awareness
22	factor because it was the manufacturer itself who has
23	the most knowledge about its product, saying
24	something to the consumer that was not necessarily in
25	the best interest of profits, but in the best
1	interests of the people; right?
2	A. That didn't happen, though.
3	Q. That didn't happen, did it?
4	A. No.
5	Q. And we've agreed that it should have, right?
6	A. Speaking as a person, --
7	Q. Right.
8	A. -- an individual. Not as a historian.
9	Q. I understand.
10	And if it had -- and you watch lots of
11	historical events. We've just seen some dramatic and
12	tragic deaths, and all kinds of things that we watch
13	in our society, we watch their impact and awareness,
14	on and on, but if they had stood together, those
15	executives, and made that announcement that we're
16	talking about, "This product kills and we've got to
17	stop it. We've got to really stop it? We've got to
18	do that together, because it's in all of your best
19	interests"; that, in fact, would have had, in your
20	view as a historian, a dramatically greater impact
21	than the American Cancer Society or some other entity
22	pronouncing that cigarette smoking causes cancer,
23	would it not?
24	A. I have no way of evaluating a hypothetical
25	question like that. It could have, yes.
1	Q. Thank you.
2	Now, on page twenty-eight, if I can direct you
3	to --
4	A. Twenty-eight?
5	Q. Yes, sir. Please. To the paragraph that begins
6	with "although."
7	A. Although, yes.
8	Q. There you say there was this law passed in 1913,
9	right?
10	A. 1913 is a repeal of a law.
11	Q. Right. And the reason for its repeal was it was
12	ineffective enforcement and lack of compliance with
13	the law, right?
14	A. That is correct.
15	Q. And the legislature recognized that; correct?
16	A. That is correct.
17	Q. So now at least we'll read that in 1913 smoking
18	in Minnesota was no longer illegal?
19	A. That is correct, yes.
20	Q. There was an explicit approval of it, so to
21	speak?
22	A. Oh, I wouldn't say repealing a prohibition is
23	approval. But if you want to characterize it that
24	way, go ahead.
25	Q. I understand. I understand what you're saying.
1	Now, --
2	A. Approval by the state.
3	Q. Now, we go to twenty-nine, okay? Bottom
4	paragraph.
5	"Unlike the first anti-cigarette statute, the
6	1919 law," now the next law passed?
7	A. Uh-huh.
8	Q. -- "...recognized that to curtail smoking the
9	state must first discourage smoking among its youth";
10	right?
11	A. That's correct.
12	Q. And so Minnesota was now sending a message that
13	its kids shouldn't be targeted?
14	A. That wasn't the first time.
15	Q. And it wasn't the first time?
16	A. No.
17	Q. And the tobacco companies, you're confident,
18	were aware of that, because they'd be aware of the
19	laws that impact their industry?
20	A. I would assume so, yes.
21	Q. Yeah. Do you know whether they had lobbyists as
22	early as the '20s here?
2	3	A. I have no idea.
24	Q. You never asked that question?
25	A. No.
1	Q. You don't know when the first time was that they
2	had lobbyists?
3	A. I have no idea. I have no idea when the first
4	lobbyists appeared in the Minnesota State Legislature
5	for anything.
6	Q. Right.
7	A. But we could find that out.
8	Q. Sure.
9	But at least we know that a message was sent
10	here, by Minnesota, not to target kids in Minnesota?
11	A. That message had been sent even earlier, as I
12	said before.
13	Q. So to the extent a company was doing that,
14	targeting kids in Minnesota, it would be contrary to
15	the message that had previously been sent, let alone
16	sent again in 1919; right?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. And so if they were doing that, targeting kids,
19	and really doing things to do that, it would be
20	contrary to law?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Then you go on, on page thirty, to spell out
23	what the penalty for any violation of a minor's use
24	was, if a minor were to be convicted of smoking, he
25	faced a fine. On and on, right?
1	A. Yes. Right.
2	Q. Further details sending this message to anybody,
3	including the tobacco companies, that they shouldn't
4	target kids; right?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. You have something very interesting at the
7	bottom of page thirty-one. I just wonder if you
8	found it interesting.
9	A. Uh-huh.
10	Q. It says, "While 41% of adults polled by
11	Fortune Magazine said they smoked cigarettes in '39,
12	76% said they smoke now in response to a similar
13	Gallup Poll in '46"; right?
14	A. That is correct.
15	Q. And this was a significant increase, from 41 to
16	76; right?
17	A. Tremendous increase.
18	Q. And do you know what accounted for that?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. What?
21	A. World War II.
22	Q. Also the fact that women were smoking?
23	A. No.
24	Q. More than they had in the past?
25	A. Probably the peak of women smoking cigarettes --
1	peaked -- started going up in the 1920s and into the
2	1930s. Probably in the 1940s, if I recall my sources
3	well enough, the rise in the proportion of women
4	smoking kept pace with the rise in proportion of the
5	total population smoking. It didn't exceed the rise
6	in the total population.
7	Q. Okay. So the rise, though, in women smoking,
8	was also dramatic by some percentage, whether it was
9	41 to 76, it was at least an upsurge?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. Commensurate with the rest of the population?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. And you then say, "Notably, this increase
14	occurred even though the majority of those polled
15	said they thought cigarette smoking was harmful"?
16	A. That is correct. That's at least what the
17	Gallup Poll reports.
18	Q. Does that statement there, to you, say something
19	about the power of addiction?
2	0 A. Well, I don't know what it tells me. Among
21	other things, it tells me some thing about the power
22	of addiction, yes.
23	Q. What are the other things it tells me?
24	A. Well, the other things it tells me are, of
25	course, the tensions of World War II times were such
1	that people found release, relief, whatever you want
2	to call it, from a -- what turns out to be a harmful
3	habit.
4	Q. You then say at the bottom of page thirty-three,
5	if I can.
6	A. Thirty-three? Yes, sir.
7	Q. Last sentence here, you're talking about from
8	'55 to '75?
9	A. '57.
10	Q. Yeah. "In '57 it proposed the establishment of
11	'no smoking' areas in hospitals..." --
12	A. Uh-huh.
13	Q. -- "...because of the health risks of smoking"?
14	A. Right.
15	Q. You then say, "That bill did not pass... " --
16	A. Uh-huh.
17	Q. -- "...because most of the physicians in the
18	state and the State Department of Health itself
19	opposed its passage."
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. You don't cite to anything there, do you?
22	A. If I'm not mistaken, it came out of the Senate
23	Committee Hearings.
24	Q. But in fact, sir, you didn't evaluate what
25	activities the tobacco companies were up to at that
1	time, --
2	A. No.
3	Q. -- on that bill, in Minnesota, to determine
4	whether they had an impact on that bill not passing?
5	A. No, I did not.
6	Q. So at least when you make the statement here,
7	"That bill did not pass because most of the
8	physicians in the state and State Department of
9	Health itself opposed its passage," you have no idea
10	what the tobacco companies were doing either to
11	oppose the bill itself, or to influence doctors or
12	Health Department officials?
13	A. I have no knowledge of what they did.
14	Q. And then you go on in your next paragraph and
15	you say, "Another thirty years passed before the 1990
16	legislature -- " --
17	A. I'm sorry, where is that?
18	Q. Bottom of the next paragraph. I'm sorry.
19	A. Bottom of the next paragraph. 1959 another
20	bill -- oh, I see.
21	Q. Thank you. You can read that paragraph, I don't
22	want to try to catch you off guard or anything here.
23	A. Uh-huh.
24	Q. "Another thirty years passed before the 1990
25	legislature enacted similar legislation."
1	A. Uh-huh.
2	Q. Was that legislation opposed in 1990, do you
3	know?
4	A. I assume it was.
5	Q. But you don't know?
6	A. Well, the legislative hearings that I did review
7	did show that some legislators did speak in
8	opposition, yes.
9	Q. Was it opposed by the tobacco industry?
10	A. I have no way of knowing.
11	Q. You don't know who their lobbyist was in 1990?
12	A. No, I do not.
13	Q. You don't know if they had mounted one of the
14	most, in their self-proclaimed way, said was the most
15	effective lobbying campaign they'd ever targeted?
16	A. No.
17	Q. You don't know if they felt that they had hired
18	the most effective lobbyists in the state of
19	Minnesota?
20	A. I have no knowledge of that.
21	Q. You don't know if they said nothing less than
22	complete victory will be acceptable, in their
23	internal documents, among their own lobbyists, do
24	you?
25	A. I have no way of knowing that.
1	Q. You have no idea how many telephone calls were
2	made to impact public opinion and public awareness by
3	the tobacco industry, do you?
4	A. No.
5	Q. And the reason you don't is that you defined out
6	of your question -- in the way that you proposed your
7	question, you defined out looking at tobacco
8	documents?
9	A. That is correct.
10	Q. You then go on, on page thirty-six, please.
11	A. Thirty-six?
12	Q. Yep.
13	A. (Complying.)
14	Q. End of the first paragraph -- it's talking about
15	the '60 and '63 legislation.
16	A. Uh-huh.
17	Q. "At the time, this piece of legislation would
18	have put Minnesota ahead of the rest of the nation,
19	but it did not pass."
2	0 A. True.
21	Q. Again, you don't know why it didn't pass?
22	A. No.
23	Q. You don't know what activity the tobacco
24	companies exerted against its passage, do you?
25	A. No.
1	Q. Pardon me?
2	A. No, I do not.
3	MR. MANNING: Let's take a short break, okay?
4	THE WITNESS: Sure.
5	(Recess taken.)
6	BY MR. MANNING:
7	Q. You're still on your report there, sir?
8	A. Yes, I do.
9	Q. Page thirty-eight.
10	A. Thirty-eight?
11	Q. Please.
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. So it says at the bottom there -- it says,
14	"After some discussion, the resolution was approved
15	stating that -- " this is now after --
16	A. The Minnesota Department of Health. Okay. Yes.
17	Q. Okay.
18	A. I see the context.
19	Q. "...resolution was approved stating that
20	cigarette smoking is causally related to lung cancer,
21	associated with deaths from cardiovascular diseases,
22	and increases the risks of dying from cancer and
23	emphysema"; right?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. And you don't disagree with that?
1	A. No.
2	Q. And you then go down to the bottom there in your
3	continuing historical analysis. You say in '74
4	Dr. Jesse Steinfeld, the former surgeon general,
5	spoke; do you see that?
6	A. Yes, I see that.
7	Q. And it goes on to the next page, he spoke about
8	the negative impacts that firsthand and even
9	secondhand smoke had on its inadvertent recipients;
10	do you see where you say that?
11	A. Yes, I see that.
12	Q. Dr. Steinfeld stated that, "Unequivocal data
13	have demonstrated that the cigarette smoker has a far
14	higher morbidity and mortality rate from cancer,
15	heart disease, and diseases of the lung than the
16	nonsmoker. No safe level has either been shown to
17	the smoker himself or his non-smoking companion who
18	were forced to breathe the polluted air which the
19	smoker pours into the environment"; that was quoted,
20	right?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And that's in 1974 that Dr. Steinfeld is telling
23	the House --
24	A. That's right.
25	Q. -- Subcommittee that; right?
1	A. That is absolutely correct.
2	Q. And if the tobacco companies knew that in 1974,
3	then they should have told the legislature that, too;
4	correct? In some form or fashion?
5	A. I assume so.
6	Q. Yeah. If they knew, they should have told;
7	right?
8	A. If they were asked.
9	Q. And if they were asked. So okay. Let's back
10	up, then.
11	If the tobacco companies knew, but they weren't
12	asked, you think they shouldn't have told?
13	A. My understanding is that a legislative
14	hearing -- the witness is brought forward by one or
15	the other side advocating passage or non-passage of a
16	bill.
17	Q. Again, I'm not talking about restricted to a
18	legislative hearing. What I'm talking about here is
19	Dr. Steinfeld --
20	A. But this was done at a legislative hearing.
21	Q. I understand. It was also talking about
22	something that he knows, that I would assume he's
23	made this statement outside of the legislative
24	hearing, as well?
25	A. I would assume so.
1	Q. So irrespective of whether it's a legislative
2	hearing, or any other public forum, if this is what
3	Dr. Steinfeld knew, and if the tobacco companies knew
4	the same thing, they should have spoken out just like
5	Dr. Steinfeld did?
6	A. Of course. Of course.
7	Q. Now, on page forty-one, middle, you say, "The
8	bill, styled as a tax incentive... " Do you see that?
9	A. Yes, I do.
10	Q. "...to encourage smokers to switch from high tar
11	to low tar brands, failed when the Legislature
12	learned that Minnesotans were already switching to
13	low tar brands"?
14	A. That is correct.
15	Q. And do you know whether or not the tobacco
16	companies had a major advertising push to have people
17	smoke low tar brands?
18	A. No, I do not know.
19	Q. You didn't look at that at all?
20	A. I've seen the ads, but I haven't, you know,
21	quantified that, no.
22	Q. Okay. And do you know whether or not switching
23	to a low tar brand in fact was something that was
24	good for your health?
25	A. I have no way of knowing whether it was or was
1	not good for one's health. Although it was assumed
2	that low tar nicotine -- low tar and low nicotine was
3	better for one's health than high tar, high nicotine.
4	Q. Did you become aware of any studies or any
5	information anywhere, whether it was the complaint,
6	or any other sources, such as Richard Kluger, or any
7	other sources off the Internet, that in fact when
8	people have low tar brand cigarettes versus
9	high tar -- low tar/low nicotine,
10	high tar/high nicotine, that they smoke more?
11	A. I've seen such allegation made, yes.
12	Q. Where have you seen that?
13	A. I can't tell you where, but I've seen it widely
14	disseminated.
15	Q. And have you investigated whether that's
16	accurate?
17	A. I have no way of investigating that.
18	Q. But you have at least seen it widely
19	disseminated, that people who smoke low tar brands
20	smoke more in order to get the desired nicotine
21	effects?
22	A. I've seen that, yes.
23	Q. Whereabouts have you seen it?
24	A. I've seen it in newspaper accounts. I've seen
25	it in journal articles. I've seen it in -- I guess
1	in reports on -- legislative sessions, things of that
2	nature, yes.
3	Q. Have you seen it also reported where people who
4	smoke low tar, they drag longer on the cigarette?
5	A. I've seen that, yes.
6	Q. Do you see where they also smoke the cigarette
7	down to the butt further than other cigarettes?
8	A. I've seen that alleged, yes.
9	Q. You've also seen the free nicotine?
10	A. I don't recall --
11	Q. You've also --
12	A. I don't recall the concept of free nicotine. I
13	do recall seeing the term, but I don't remember
14	specifically what that refers to.
15	Q. Do you know whether in fact a low tar brand --
16	what's advertised as low tar brands, in fact deliver
17	less nicotine --
18	A. I have no way of knowing that.
19	Q. -- than higher tar brands?
20	A. I have no way of knowing that, no.
21	Q. Okay. Do you know whether the tobacco industry
22	supported this bill?
23	A. I do not know what the tobacco industry's
24	position on this bill was, no.
25	Q. So you don't know whether the tobacco industry
1	in 1977 was encouraging that this bill be defeated
2	because people were already switching from high tar
3	to low tar brands?
4	A. I don't know if that's the tobacco companies'
5	position. I know that was the position of -- of the
6	Revenue Commissioner, that there was no need for such
7	a bill.
8	Q. Now we go on to page forty-three.
9	A. Forty-three?
10	Q. Yes, sir, please.
11	A. Uh-huh.
12	Q. And there Dr. Koop came to Minnesota; right?
13	A. Yes. A number of times.
14	Q. And here's one time where there's a particular
15	piece of legislation; right?
16	A. That is correct.
17	Q. And Dr. Koop, in addressing the hearing, spoke
18	publicly about nicotine saying, quote, "The most
19	important thing we are trying to do is bring people
20	to realize that nicotine is addictive"; correct?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. End of quote.
23	And then you say, "...reiterating an already
24	common theme of the State"?
25	A. That is correct.
1	Q. Would you agree that at least by Dr. Koop's
2	words here that what he's saying, both expressedly
3	and impliedly, is that not everybody is aware of the
4	addictive nature of nicotine?
5	A. No, I don't understand that at all.
6	Q. How do you understand that?
7	A. I understand what he is saying is that we must
8	make them more aware.
9	Q. That's how you understood it?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. More aware so it may impact their behavior?
12	A. That is correct, yes.
13	Q. And do you know whether this legislation was
14	fought by the tobacco companies?
15	A. I have no way of knowing that.
16	Q. Again, you haven't asked for those internal
17	documents?
18	A. No, I have not.
19	Q. You don't know whether internally they were
20	declaring that nothing short of a complete victory
21	vis-a-vis this legislation would be acceptable?
22	A. I have no way of knowing that.
23	Q. At least you know that by 1985 there is such a
24	thing as lobbying; right?
25	A. Oh yes. I'm aware of lobbying.
1	Q. By that time we know it's in existence?
2	A. Oh sure.
3	Q. And used?
4	A. Oh yes.
5	Q. And likely used by the tobacco industry?
6	A. Likely, yes.
7	Q. So when you were writing this report you knew
8	that there likely was lobbying that was going on by
9	the tobacco industry, but you undertook no efforts to
10	determine what those were?
11	A. That is correct.
12	Q. And you knew that in the legislative halls, when
13	you are listening to those tapes that you go over to
14	get in the House library and the Senate library, on
15	and on, that you are hearing a very narrow part of
16	the picture?
17	A. I'm hearing what in fact were the committee
18	deliberations, yes. Whether you call it narrow or
19	broad, I have no way of knowing. It is the
20	deliberations that led either to the approval of the
21	bill to the full House or the full Senate, or the
22	non-approval of the bill, yes.
23	Q. But you're aware that a great deal of the
24	legislative process, particularly by 1985, took place
25	in the halls of the legislature, and in the offices
1	of Senators and House Reps and in informal
2	conversations with lobbyists and other trade
3	representatives?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. You're also aware here on page forty-five, that
6	first full paragraph, second sentence, in '90 to '92
7	the budget was cut for tobacco use prevention.
8	A. That is correct.
9	Q. Therefore, it's even more important, would you
10	not agree, that when public money is cut, to be spent
11	on issues of prevention, it's even more important for
12	tobacco companies to tell the truth?
13	A. Again, a question that I have to answer
14	I don't know.
15	Q. Don't you believe that the tobacco companies
16	telling the truth would assist in the anti-smoking
17	effort, particularly when anti-smoking efforts
18	budgets have been cut?
19	A. I would assume so, yes.
2	0 Q. Sure.
21	You then go on to say, in the middle of that
22	paragraph, that "In any case, the passage of a law
23	and the enforcement of that law are two different
24	parts of a single process," --
25	A. Uh-huh.
1	Q. -- "...and throughout the history of Minnesota's
2	involvement with tobacco control, enforcement has
3	been spotty."
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Have you ever talked to a highway patrolman?
6	A. Many times.
7	Q. About their enforcement of tobacco?
8	A. No.
9	Q. Have you ever talked to a police person of any
10	type?
11	A. Many times.
12	Q. About the enforcement of tobacco?
13	A. No.
14	Q. How can you make a statement as a historian that
15	enforcement has been spotty when you don't have any
16	knowledge of enforcement, do you?
17	A. I certainly do, from the basis of the historical
18	record.
19	Q. And what is that historical record that you're
20	speaking to so loudly about enforcement, sir?
21	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form of the
22	question.
23	THE WITNESS: The sum total of the evidence
24	coming out of legislative hearings, legislative
25	proceedings, accounts in the press, and the admission
1	on the part of the state that it could not enforce
2	some parts of the legislation that it passed over
3	time.
4	BY MR. MANNING:
5	Q. You're not an expert in law enforcement?
6	A. No, I am not.
7	Q. You don't know anything about the -- how law
8	enforcement is prioritized, for example?
9	A. No.
10	Q. To protect the people of Minnesota, or people of
11	Minneapolis, or St. Paul, or anything of the sort, do
12	you?
13	A. No.
14	Q. And if laws are passed declaring certain things
15	that impact a product such as tobacco made by tobacco
16	companies, then you would expect those companies to
17	not do things that would circumvent that law; right?
18	A. Or be punished to the full extent of the law.
19	Q. If in fact --
20	A. If in fact they violated it, yes.
21	Q. So if in fact they violate it, --
22	A. If they violate it, certainly.
23	Q. So if they do things that are fraudulent; if
24	they do things that are in violation of anti-trust
25	laws; if they do things that are in violation of
1	consumer protection laws and they circumvent the law
2	and they know it, then they ought to be punished,
3	right?
4	A. My view is, as an individual, certainly. As a
5	citizen, certainly.
6	Q. Okay.
7	A. As a Minnesotan, certainly.
8	Q. Absolutely?
9	A. As a historian, I have no evidence.
10	Q. You have no evidence of whether or not the
11	tobacco companies have circumvented the law because
12	that was not part of your historical analysis?
13	A. Exactly.
14	Q. But it, in fact, could be, couldn't it?
15	A. It could be if someone else wants to make it.
16	Q. That's right.
17	So if you, sir, wanted to have reviewed a
18	tobacco company's documents to determine whether or
19	not they had in fact circumvented the law over a long
20	period of time, it's something that you could have
21	done?
22	A. I could have done so, yes.
23	Q. And you didn't ask to do that, did you?
24	A. No.
25	Q. And you didn't tell them that it would only be
1	fair for you to do that if you were going to also
2	analyze this case under the question that you did?
3	A. No.
4	Q. How would you summarize your opinion, sir, in
5	this case?
6	A. Well, essentially this is a summary. This whole
7	report is a summary.
8	Q. Uh-huh.
9	A. But if you want a one-sentence summary, --
10	Q. I'm not going to restrict you to one sentence.
11	You can talk as long as you'd like. I'd like a
12	summary of your opinion.
13	A. All right.
14	That from the beginning of the existence of
15	cigarettes, limit it just to that, the health hazards
16	of cigarettes have been extensively known and made
17	abundantly aware of by various different respected
18	and respectable groups in our society, coupled with
19	the schools and other public agencies of that kind.
20	That the state attempted to assist in the restriction
21	of smoking, particularly to minors, and at one time
22	even outlawed and prohibited the sale, manufacture,
23	and distribution of cigarettes in the state.
24	At the same time, the state also benefited in
25	many ways from the sale of tobacco, tobacco
1	products.
2	Over time, however, the state has had an
3	admirable record as being a leader in tobacco
4	prevention, disease, awareness, and things of that
5	nature. Both through legislation, through actions of
6	the executive branch, and through the school systems.
7	Q. Anything else?
8	A. Pardon?
9	Q. Anything else?
10	A. That's my shorthand summary.
11	Q. Do you know Phyllis Kahn?
12	A. I certainly do.
13	Q. Is she your State Rep?
14	A. Yes. She's not my State Rep, but she is a
15	State Rep, yes.
16	Q. How do you know her?
17	A. Um --
18	Q. Socially?
19	A. How do I know her?
2	0 Q. (Nodding.)
21	A. I know her both in the political realm and in
22	the personal realm.
23	Q. Do you support the work she's done?
24	A. Absolutely. Wholeheartedly.
25	Q. Good work?
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. And some of that goes to your comment here at
3	the end that the State has led the tobacco charge, --
4	A. I'm sorry.
5	Q. -- so to speak?
6	A. Sorry?
7	Q. At the end of your summary, --
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. -- opinion, it was a compliment to the State?
10	A. Absolutely.
11	Q. And to people like Phyllis Kahn?
12	A. And to people like Phyllis Kahn.
13	Q. And you said from the beginning of time, the
14	beginning of cigarettes, people have known of the
15	health hazards?
16	A. I could have modified that and said from the
17	beginning of the existence of tobacco as a consumer
18	product. That would bring it back to the time of the
19	James the First statement and so on and so forth,
20	but...
21	Q. What is that time, then, beginning of its
22	existence as a consumer product? What is that point
23	in time?
24	A. Beginning of the seventeenth century. End of
25	the sixteenth, beginning of the seventeenth century.
1	Q. So everybody is -- I mean basically, then,
2	you're talking about the Western World, as you know
3	it, has been aware? Not just America and Minnesota,
4	when it came into existence later, --
5	A. Well, --
6	Q. -- but the Western World and the European World,
7	you're saying from the beginning of the 1600s has
8	been aware of the health hazards?
9	A. I couldn't speak about Spain, Portugal, France,
10	Germany, Russia, the Scandinavian countries, and any
11	other European country, but I can talk about England,
12	at least. And the evidence there, of course the
13	United States was a part of the English empire at the
14	time and so on.
15	Q. Right.
16	And then you say the state attempted to assist
17	in the restriction of smoking to minors and outlawed
18	it, et cetera?
19	A. (Nodding.)
20	Q. You've agreed that you at least assume that the
21	tobacco companies were well aware of those laws and
22	those restrictions?
2	3	A. I would hope so.
24	Q. And you say the state benefited?
25	A. Yes.
1	Q. But we've previously discussed that you have
2	never looked at -- in any way, shape, or form, the
3	cost to the state?
4	A. That is correct.
5	Q. Did you specifically review any tobacco company
6	advertising other than what you ran across in the
7	papers and whatnot?
8	A. No.
9	Q. But you did consider the advertising as a part
10	of your opinion?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. Whatever advertising you ran across, it was
13	considered in your opinion?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. You did not consider defendants' statements
16	denying -- defendants here being the tobacco
17	companies, as well as the tobacco industry groups,
18	such as the Council For Tobacco Research and the
19	Tobacco Institute, you did not consider their
20	statements denying the causation of cigarette smoking
21	to cancer, did you?
22	A. Oh, I considered it, but I didn't take it
23	into -- didn't give it high qualitative value.
24	Q. You were aware of it, but you do not go into the
25	depth or the breadth with which they made those
1	statements?
2	A. That's correct.
3	Q. You did not historically research how far and
4	wide and sweeping those statements were?
5	A. No.
6	Q. Or people's knowledge of those statements and
7	the impact on people; correct?
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. But you were aware, and still are aware today,
10	that for a long period of time tobacco companies
11	consistently denied that, one, cigarettes were
12	addictive -- are you aware of that?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. And that they denied that cigarettes caused
15	cancer?
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. Now you wouldn't in any way, shape, or form want
18	to say to this judge or jury that the people of
19	Minnesota know more than the tobacco companies
20	themselves about the risks of smoking, would you?
21	A. That is not what I'm saying, no.
22	Q. In fact, we've previously established that it's
23	even your view that the tobacco companies themselves
24	would know more about the risks of smoking --
25	A. They may know. I have no way of knowing that.
1	That's a question that, again, I did not do any
2	research on.
3	Q. Okay. But you're at least not in any way saying
4	that the people of the State of Minnesota knew more
5	than the tobacco companies?
6	A. I wouldn't say that they knew more than the
7	tobacco companies. But they certainly knew from
8	everything that they were able to perceive and
9	assimilate from neutral, non-industry sources, that
10	cigarette smoking was in fact harmful, yes.
11	Q. But, again, there's no way that you can say that
12	the State of Minnesota or the people of Minnesota
13	knew more than the tobacco companies because you
14	haven't evaluated the breadth and depth of what the
15	tobacco companies knew?
16	A. I think that the breadth and depth of the health
17	hazards of smoking were so deeply known and so
18	pervasive in our society, that what the tobacco
19	companies did or did not do would not make any major
2	0 impact.
21	Q. That's not the question.
22	The question is that the tobacco companies,
23	we've already said know, as the manufacturer of their
24	product, more about their product than anyone else;
25	right?
1	A. I would assume so. I would hope so.
2	Q. And hence they have more knowledge on a
3	day-to-day basis because they're the ones making it
4	and putting it out, studying it, and involved with it
5	heavily on a day-to-day basis, than any amorphous
6	State of Minnesota; correct?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. Do you think the state did something wrong with
9	respect to tobacco control?
10	A. I think the state did the best it could.
11	Q. Okay.
12	A. I mean that given the historic circumstance, the
13	historic times, the state did the best -- it did
14	better than most other states. Let's put it that
15	way.
16	Q. Maybe the best of any state?
17	A. Maybe the best of any state. In fact I think I
18	stated here, that's -- did I say the best? If not,
19	among the best.
20	Q. The very top of the best?
21	A. Very top, yes.
22	Q. Or close to the top of the best by way of
23	tobacco control?
24	A. No question about that.
25	Q. I want you to assume some things with me, okay?
1	A. Pardon me?
2	Q. I want you to assume some things with me.
3	A. Let me preface my statement here in response to
4	your question: That assumptions are something that
5	historians don't do without evidence. Okay?
6	Q. I understand.
7	A. So, please, I'll go along with you.
8	Q. Believe me, it's a proper procedure in a
9	court of law, --
10	A. All right.
11	Q. -- or your counsel wouldn't allow it, see.
12	A. I understand that.
13	Q. All right.
14	A. But I also want to inform you what historians do
15	and don't do.
16	Q. I understand. But I need to ask you these
17	questions because you didn't look at the tobacco
18	companies' documents.
19	A. That's true.
20	Q. So I need to fill in the other half of this
21	equation, at a minimum, and some of that is going to
22	be done through assumptions. Okay? And I just want
23	you to hang with me here for a minute.
24	I want you to assume that, one, tobacco
25	companies can in fact influence kids, twelve- to
1	eighteen-year-olds; okay? That's what I mean when
2	I'm saying kids. One, they can do that.
3	Two, that they do in fact target them. They
4	study them and target them. Okay?
5	That they do advertise to them.
6	That they do promote to them.
7	And that they spend very, very, very little
8	money telling kids of the consequences of smoking,
9	versus the promotion of it; okay? Almost negligible
10	in relationship to the promotion of it.
11	They also know that the only way that they can
12	continue their market share is to get kids in the
13	twelve to eighteen, and hook them, addict them. And
14	they know if they do, it works. That they'll gain
15	market share and increase sales, and on and on.
16	If, in fact, tobacco companies do that, would
17	you agree that they shouldn't?
18	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: This is now, again, basing my
20	statement on my view as a public person, not as a
21	historian. Not here as an expert.
22	Yes.
23	BY MR. MANNING:
24	Q. Would you agree that it's wrong?
25	A. Wrong? I'm sorry.
1	Q. Would you agree that it's wrong to do that?
2	A. Wrong to -- wrong to the state --
3	Q. Do all the things I just said--to target kids,
4	go after them, and get them?
5	A. If they're doing that, yes.
6	Q. And would you agree that at least in part, by
7	you being here today and rendering testimony on -- on
8	behalf of the tobacco companies, that you are at
9	least in some small way impliedly supporting that
10	activity?
11	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
12	THE WITNESS: Absolutely not.
13	BY MR. MANNING:
14	Q. Have you told them you don't support that
15	activity?
16	A. No.
17	Q. You haven't discussed it with them before I
18	brought it up right here; correct?
19	A. That is correct.
20	Q. Even though you have seen all of the things that
21	I stated alleged, one, in the complaint; two --
22	Right?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. Two, discussed in the Kluger book; correct?
25	A. Yes.
1	Q. Discussed in the tobacco papers on the Internet?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And you never brought it up with the tobacco
4	companies in the two and a half years you've been
5	working for them, until I brought it up today, and
6	you still haven't brought it up with them, have you?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. Do you agree, sir, that by the documents you've
9	seen, at least by the ones you have seen, that in
10	fact the tobacco companies have created a false
11	controversy about tobacco not definitively causing
12	cancer or disease, and even holding out some remote
13	possibility that there's something safe about it?
14	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
15	BY MR. MANNING:
16	Q. Based on the documents you've seen, you have
17	seen that the tobacco companies at least in some
18	small way, based on the small number of documents you
19	have seen, have attempted to create that false
20	controversy; correct?
21	A. I can't answer that question since I haven't
22	seen the documents that refer to that.
23	Q. And the reason you haven't seen those documents,
24	at least one of the reasons, is that you haven't
25	asked for them; right?
1	A. That is correct.
2	Q. Let me ask you a question about professional
3	integrity and ethics of your own as an academic.
4	If you, sir, see at some point in time, whether
5	it's in this deposition or later, something that
6	causes you to believe, firmly believe, that tobacco
7	companies have lied to Minnesotans and to fellow
8	Americans, will you withdraw as an expert in this
9	case?
10	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: It would have to be conclusive.
12	BY MR. MANNING:
13	Q. Conclusive?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. But if it was conclusive you would withdraw;
16	correct?
17	A. Yes. And if it had a bearing on my conclusions.
18	Q. And if there was something to suggest that
19	possibility, that tobacco companies had lied, would
20	you demand to take a look at it and have them pay for
21	whatever hours you spend looking at it in order to
22	determine -- for you to determine whether or not you
23	can come to a conclusive conclusion?
24	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
25	THE WITNESS: That is not the question that I'm
1	researching as a historian. I am not doing any work
2	on the role of the tobacco companies in this
3	particular instance. You'd have to get someone else
4	to do that for you.
5	BY MR. MANNING:
6	Q. Sir, I'm not asking you to do it for me. Let me
7	be clear about that, okay? What I'm asking is
8	whether you, as a person of academic integrity, will,
9	if it is suggested by documents, will demand of your
10	clients that you be allowed to undertake that
11	research?
12	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: I am not interested in what the
14	tobacco companies did or did not do. I am interested
15	in what in fact the people of Minnesota and the
16	United States and the State of Minnesota, through its
17	various agencies and bodies did/did not know, did do,
18	and did not do.
19	BY MR. MANNING:
20	Q. Would you submit your expert report to a
21	peer review journal?
22	A. I certainly would.
23	Q. You would?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. And you've sat on peer review journals?
1	A. Oh, I have.
2	Q. Many?
3	A. Many.
4	Q. Have you ever rejected an article?
5	A. Oh yes, I've rejected articles.
6	More often than not, I've not outright rejected,
7	but asked for revisions.
8	Q. Sir, have you seen in the course of your
9	historical analysis these statistics: By age
10	seventeen 77% percent of kids have tried smoking and
11	25% have become regular smokers? Have you seen that?
12	A. I don't recall having seen those figures. But
13	the general, you know, content of what you're saying,
14	I've come across, yes.
15	Q. Have you seen that 73% of minors who smoke
16	started by age fifteen?
17	A. I don't know whether that's the exact figure
18	I've seen, but it was a large number, yes.
19	Q. Have you seen that 2.7 million children have
20	smoked a whole cigarette by their thirteenth
21	birthday?
22	A. That I didn't see. But I could understand that,
23	yes.
24	Q. Have you seen that 75% of eighth graders and 89%
25	of tenth graders say that cigarettes are easy to get?
1	A. I haven't seen that, but it doesn't surprise me.
2	Q. Have you seen that minors smoke over five
3	hundred million packs of cigarettes per year, half of
4	these are illegally sold, garnering over five hundred
5	million in illegal sales; have you seen that?
6	A. No. It doesn't surprise me. That's the reason
7	that the State of Minnesota wanted to have more
8	strict enforcement of sales to minors, and just last
9	year passed it. The first really effective piece of
10	legislation in that regard.
11	Q. What's that?
12	A. At least I hope it's effective.
13	Q. You haven't tested whether it's effective?
14	A. No. Of course not. Too soon.
15	Q. In the course of your research did you see that
16	89% of adult daily smokers started smoking by age
17	eighteen?
18	A. I have seen -- I don't know if that's the exact
19	figure I've seen, but a large number, yes.
20	Q. Have you seen that 44% of teens who smoke
21	regularly are daily smokers?
22	A. I don't know that to be a fact, but it doesn't
23	surprise me.
24	Q. Have you seen that one-third to one-half of kids
25	who experiment with smoking become regular smoking --
1	smokers?
2	A. I haven't seen that statement but, again, it
3	wouldn't surprise me.
4	Q. If it was in the surgeon general's '94 report it
5	wouldn't surprise you?
6	A. No, it would not. And I've probably seen it,
7	but I don't recall it, yes.
8	Q. Have you seen that 63% of teen smokers
9	considered themselves addicted to cigarettes?
10	A. I haven't seen that figure, but, again, it
11	wouldn't surprise me.
12	Q. Have you seen that 70% of teen smokers who say
13	that given the chance to do things differently they
14	wouldn't have started smoking?
15	A. They wouldn't have started smoking?
16	Q. Yes.
17	A. Yes, I certainly do agree with that.
18	Q. Have you seen that the younger a child begins
19	smoking, the more likely it is that he or she will
20	become a heavy smoker as an adult?
21	A. I haven't seen such a statement, but again, it
22	wouldn't surprise me.
23	Q. Have you ever had your work funded by the
24	tobacco industry before this time?
25	A. No.
1	Q. In any way, shape, or form?
2	A. No. No way, shape, or form.
3	Q. Do you agree that cigarettes should be regulated
4	by the FDA?
5	A. As a historian? Or as an individual?
6	Q. Either.
7	A. As a historian, I have no opinion on that. But
8	as an individual, yes.
9	Q. Do you presently plan to do any other work in
10	the formulation of your opinion or report or
11	anywhere?
12	A. I will continue reading, studying, researching,
13	to either modify this, change this, refine it. Hone
14	it. Whatever is necessary.
15	Q. Have you been asked --
16	A. In other words -- in other words, this is a work
17	if progress, so to speak.
18	Q. That's your view. This is not a final report?
19	A. Well, it's the final report as of July 1.
20	Q. What are you going to continue to do?
21	A. Pardon me?
22	Q. What are you going to continue to do?
23	A. Continue to look for more documentation having
24	to do with the general question of public awareness.
25	Looking at more documentation having to do with
1	different state agencies' responses to the issues of
2	hazards of smoking.
3	Q. You will continue to keep your question narrowly
4	defined in that respect?
5	A. That is correct. I am not interested in what
6	the tobacco companies do or do not do.
7	MR. MANNING: Take a short break.
8	(Recess taken.)
9	BY MR. MANNING:
10	Q. Okay. Professor, earlier you told me that you
11	recall seeing this article in New York Times about
12	some statements that an executive from Philip Morris
13	made. I just am going to read to you, see if this
14	refreshes your memory.
15	Do you recall that a gentleman named Mr. Motley,
16	it was reported, asked a Mr. Bible, from
17	Philip Morris, would Philip Morris agree that a
18	single American citizen who smokes their products for
19	thirty or more years, a single one, has ever died of
20	a disease caused in part by smoking cigarettes. And
21	Mr. Bible, it was reported, answered, "I think
22	there's a fair chance that one would have, might
23	have"; do you recall seeing that?
24	A. I certainly do, yes.
25	Q. Then the next question which was reported in the
1	same article said, "How about a thousand?" "How
2	about a thousand?" Mr. Motley asked. And Mr. Bible
3	said, "Might have."
4	Do you recall seeing that?
5	A. I do.
6	Q. And the next question was, "How about a hundred
7	thousand?" Mr. Motley asked. And Mr. Bible
8	responded, "Might have"; right?
9	A. Yes, I remember seeing that.
10	Q. Then you recall it went on to say afterwards,
11	Mr. Motley said on CNN, "I salute Philip Morris for
12	the first time in forty years, being forthright and
13	candid; it's a very public health spirited way of
14	looking at things"?
15	A. I saw that in the article, yes.
16	Q. Went on to say, "The public health officials
17	estimate that four hundred fifty thousand Americans
18	die each year from illnesses caused by smoke and
19	second-hand smoke."
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. Yep?
22	A. I didn't recall the figure four hundred fifty
23	thousand, but yes, I do recall that particular
24	article.
25	Q. And what I read to you, you recall being
1	something as you would -- reading the New York Times,
2	as a part of your work as an expert, to stay current
3	with what's happening in the press? That's part of
4	what you were describing as your ongoing work in your
5	report?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Correct?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. And that's one of the things you'll continue to
10	do?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. And you recall that this was an event that was
13	reported as something that was different than
14	anything that had occurred for the last forty years?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. By way of public statements of the tobacco
17	industry?
18	A. So it was reported in the times, yes.
19	Q. And that's one of the reasons it caught your
20	interest?
21	A. I am sorry?
22	Q. That was one of the reasons it caught your
23	interest, is that it was different? It was saying
24	that the tobacco companies had said something
25	publicly, or in a deposition, different than they had
1	ever stated publicly before?
2	A. No, that isn't the only reason it caught my
3	interest. It caught my interest because I read
4	everything now that comes out on the tobacco
5	litigation, to keep current with what's going on,
6	yes.
7	Q. Okay. That was one of the reasons it caught
8	your interest, though, because it was different?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. It was different, what was stated there, by that
11	individual, than what had been stated publicly in the
12	prior forty or fifty years?
13	A. That is certainly what the New York Times
14	article said, yes.
15	Q. That's how you understood it?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. And so then you knew at least at that point in
18	time, and I'll represent to you it was August 22, '97
19	when that article appeared, that you at least knew
20	that the companies that you were working for, that
21	the chief executive of Philip Morris had stated under
22	oath that it's very likely that his products have
23	caused a hundred thousand deaths; correct?
24	A. Well, let me just say, I'm not working for
25	Philip Morris or for the tobacco companies.
1	Q. You just know that the money that goes into your
2	pocket is from them?
3	A. I assume that's where the money is coming from.
4	Q. Right.
5	A. But I'm not working for them. I'm doing
6	historical research, independent of them.
7	Now, your question? I'm sorry.
8	Q. Well, -- but in fact, sir, you would agree with
9	me that if all of your research, and your research
10	assistants, the eight of them, are being paid by the
11	tobacco industry, you're not independent of them?
12	A. No, of course not.
13	Q. Right.
14	A. No, I mean let's be realistic about it. They're
15	the ones that got the deep pockets, of course.
16	Q. From reading that article in the New York Times
17	about what Mr. Bible said about his products causing
18	cancer, you concluded at a minimum -- at a minimum,
19	when you read that, that they had not been forthright
20	for many years in the past about what they knew?
21	A. One could so conclude, yes.
22	Q. And you concluded that?
23	A. Within reason. Let's put it that way.
24	Q. Well, you can conclude...
25	And you're not a medical doctor; correct?
1	A. No.
2	Q. You're not a behavioral scientist?
3	A. That is correct.
4	Q. As a historian you do not speak about the
5	cognitive workings of the human mind; correct?
6	A. No.
7	Q. You're not an expert in psychological theory?
8	A. Not at all.
9	Q. You, in your report, basically say that the
10	state, and by that you're saying some Minnesotans;
11	right?
12	A. Depending on what context. The state could be
13	the legislature, could be the governor. Could be the
14	Health Department. Could be the Department of
15	Education. The state as an entity. It depends on
16	what -- in what context.
17	Q. So sometimes in your report the context is very
18	clear because you're talking about what the governor
19	did?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. And then it's the governor. And if it's the
22	Department of Education, then it's that department.
23	A. Yes.
24	Department of Health.
25	Q. And if it's the Department of Health, then it's
1	that department. When it's not clear whether it's
2	the legislative branch or executive branch of
3	government, then what -- when you say the word
4	"the state" you're talking about Minnesotans?
5	A. I'm talking about the state of Minnesota, yes.
6	Q. When you say the state of Minnesota you're
7	talking about the Minnesotans?
8	A. Depends on, again, the context.
9	Q. But in your report when you talk about the state
10	of Minnesota, and there was a time you told me you
11	were talking about Minnesotans.
12	A. Minnesotans, talking about the people.
13	Q. Right.
14	A. The state, probably talking -- I can't, you
15	know, fully -- you know, guarantee it in every case,
16	I'm probably talking about some state agency,
17	state entity, legislative, judicial, executive
18	branch, et cetera.
19	Q. But whenever you're talking about Minnesotans,
20	you never know how many of them you're talking
21	about? Because levels of awareness on any one issue
22	can change --
23	A. Absolutely.
24	Q. -- day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month?
25	A. Absolutely, yes.
1	Q. So whenever you're talking about Minnesotans, we
2	never know precisely the percentage of Minnesotans
3	you're talking about?
4	A. Except where we have survey data to back this
5	up.
6	Q. Uh-huh.
7	A. That -- from 1947 on we have the Minnesota poll
8	to help us in that regard.
9	Q. Uh-huh. And then we have to go in and analyze
10	precisely what questions were asked?
11	A. Right.
12	Q. How it was done, to what degree of scientific
13	accuracy it is?
14	A. Exactly.
15	Q. And you haven't done that?
16	A. No, I haven't done that.
17	Q. You just read the results of that?
18	A. No. I did more than that.
19	Q. You read the poll?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. Now, Minnesotans at least, in 1880, you say knew
22	certain things, like the health hazards of smoking;
23	right?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. And you also say they knew certain things about
1	the health hazards of smoking in 1950 -- in the '50s;
2	right?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. How do you reconcile that Minnesotans knew in
5	1880 and in 1950, and the tobacco companies deny
6	it -- deny, for example, that smoking causes cancer
7	right into the '90s? How do you reconcile it?
8	A. I don't reconcile it at all. It's not my
9	purpose to reconcile it at all.
10	Q. You just don't do it?
11	A. Pardon me?
12	Q. You just don't do it? You just ignore it?
13	A. No. Let someone else do it.
14	Q. Good.
15	A. That's not my purpose.
16	Q. Like a jury?
17	A. A jury certainly would be helpful in that
18	regard.
19	Q. Okay. Sir, I want to show you the complaint
2	0 that you read.
21	A. Uh-huh.
22	Q. Okay?
23	MR. MANNING: Let's mark that, please. I don't
24	have another copy. I assume there's a lot of them
2	5 around.
1	(Exhibit 3136 marked for identification.)
2	MR. MANNING: Thank you.
3	BY MR. MANNING:
4	Q. Sir, showing you what's been marked as a copy of
5	the amended complaint; okay?
6	A. Uh-huh.
7	Q. I'm going to ask you to scan through it and then
8	I'm going to read parts with you.
9	A. Do you want me to read the whole thing?
10	Q. Just scan through it and see if this is the
11	document that --
12	A. There's a page missing. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay.
13	Q. Or is close to the document that you recall
14	reading. I mean you're not going to have exact
15	recollection of what you read two years ago.
16	A. It's over two years ago that I read it.
17	Q. Does it generally look like the document you
18	read two years ago? And then I'm going to walk you
19	through parts of it.
20	A. It generally looks like the document, yes.
21	Q. It does?
22	A. (Nodding.)
23	Q. Okay. And it's a 56-page document?
24	A. It is a 56-page document, yes.
25	Q. Signed by my partners, Michael Ciresi and
1	Roberta Walburn?
2	A. That is correct.
3	Except it's dated November 25, 1996. And I saw
4	it in November of 1994.
5	Q. That's the first time you saw it?
6	A. That's the first time and only time.
7	Q. Okay. We're going to back up to page one, okay?
8	A. Page one?
9	Q. Yes, sir.
10	Now you recall seeing that it was in the county
11	of Ramsey. And it was the State of Minnesota, by
12	Hubert Humphrey, its Attorney General. Blue Cross
13	Blue Shield versus all these tobacco companies;
14	right?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. You did read the complaint when it was given to
17	you?
18	A. Yes, I did.
19	Q. Did you take it home?
20	A. I believe so, yes.
21	Q. Took it home, read it?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. Did you say send it back, or --
24	A. No, I think I kept it. But whether I still have
25	it or not is -- I don't know. I really don't know.
1	Q. Did you show it to Michael and what's the other
2	gentleman's name?
3	A. Michael and David.
4	Q. David.
5	A. I don't recall whether I showed it to them or
6	not. I really don't recall that.
7	Q. How about the six researchers in
8	Washington, D.C., did they want to see the complaint
9	in the case?
10	A. I don't know anything about that, no.
11	Q. Okay. Now I'm going to show you there on page
12	two, paragraph three, second sentence, it says,
13	"The death toll in one year alone from cigarette
14	smoking equals the number of American lives lost in
15	battles in all the wars this country has fought this
16	century. Overwhelmingly, the new recruits in this
17	death march are children and adolescents"; do you see
18	that statement?
19	A. I've seen that, yes.
20	Q. And you've read that before?
21	A. I think I have, yes.
22	Q. Did that cause you to want to broaden the
23	question that you were going to research at all?
24	A. No.
25	Q. I'm going to ask you to turn to page thirteen.
1	A. Thirteen? Yes, sir.
2	Q. Do you see there, going down about four
3	sentences it says, "One of the first... "
4	In the right-hand --
5	A. "One of the first of these studies... "
6	Is that --
7	Q. Yes.
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. -- "...was published in 1952 by Dr. Richard
10	Doll, a British researcher. Dr. Doll, in a
11	statistical analysis, found that lung cancer was more
12	common among people who smoked and that the risk of
13	lung cancer was directly proportional to the number
14	of cigarettes smoked."
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. You saw that?
17	A. I saw that, yes.
18	Q. And that was confirmed by your historical
19	research?
20	A. That is absolutely correct.
21	Q. Likewise, the next study by Dr. Wynder --
22	A. Wynder.
2	3	Q. Wynder.
24	A. Dr. Wynder.
2	5 Q. Thank you.
1	Was confirmed in your historical research?
2	A. That is correct.
3	Q. Likewise, the last sentence, "Malignant tumors
4	grew in 44% of the mice, providing biological
5	confirmation of the cancer-causing properties of
6	cigarettes"; that was also confirmed in your
7	historical analysis?
8	A. That's what Dr. Wynder found, yes.
9	Q. So it was confirmed in your historical research?
10	A. Yes, absolutely.
11	Q. So what you read in the complaint, at least in
12	this paragraph, as to these issues, was confirmed in
13	your historical research?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. Then in paragraph twenty-two there, it says,
16	"The Doll and Wynder studies generated widespread
17	public concern about the health hazards of
18	cigarettes"; right?
19	A. That's correct.
20	Q. And you confirmed that?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. "Confronted with this evidence, the presidents
23	of the leading tobacco companies met at an
24	extraordinary gathering in the Plaza Hotel in
25	New York City on December 15, 1953"; do you see that?
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. Did your historical research confirm that that
3	meeting took place, too?
4	A. I have no recollection of seeing the minutes of
5	that meeting or any references to that meeting except
6	as referenced here in the complaint.
7	Q. Okay. But you did see it referenced here in the
8	complaint?
9	A. Yes, I have. Yes.
10	Q. Back in November -- in spring of '95? Fall of
11	'95?
12	A. Fall of '95.
13	Q. Fall of '95.
14	And so what was referenced here was this Hill
15	and Knowlton memorandum, it goes on, on page
16	fourteen; right?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. It says according to the memo, "a" the companies
19	had not met together since two previous antitrust
20	decrees. It goes on, right?
21	A. Uh-huh.
22	Q. Right?
23	A. That's what it says, yes.
24	Q. And you read what was in "a," all of it?
25	A. Yes, I have.
1	Q. You read all of what was in b?
2	A. Uh-huh.
3	Q. Ask you --
4	A. My recollection was I did at the time, yes.
5	Q. And then item c?
6	A. Item c?
7	Q. Item c you also read, right?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. And it said that, "The industry leaders feel
10	that the problem is one of promoting cigarettes and
11	protecting them from these and other attacks that may
12	be expected in the future and that the industry
13	should sponsor a public relations campaign which is
14	positive in nature and is entirely pro-cigarettes";
15	you read that?
16	A. I have, yes.
17	Q. Was that confirmed by your historical research?
18	A. No, I have not seen anything to confirm or to
19	affirm -- or to negate, rather. I'm sorry.
20	Q. Then we go over to page fifteen, item f. Then
21	you see that Hill and Knowlton was to play a central
22	role in the formation of an association for the
23	industry; right?
24	A. That's what it says, yes.
25	Q. And did you confirm that in any source other
1	than this complaint?
2	A. No.
3	Q. In Kluger's book was that confirmed?
4	A. Oh, in the book on "Ashes to Ashes"? Yes, it
5	was.
6	Q. So it was confirmed there?
7	A. Yes. He, of course, reports that there, yes.
8	Q. And how about in "The Smoking Papers" book?
9	A. I don't recall it in "The Smoking Papers" book,
10	but I didn't read the entire book.
11	Q. You just read the description of it on the
12	Internet?
13	A. Exactly. Exactly.
14	Q. And then I'll ask you to turn to page sixteen.
15	A. Sixteen.
16	Q. Of course, you're welcome to read along all the
17	way to it.
18	A. Surely.
19	Q. Where it says --
20	A. Number twenty-five?
21	Q. Yes. Paragraph twenty-five. I'm going to go
22	right down to the bottom of that. Talking about the
23	advertisement in the Frank Statement; right?
24	A. (Reviewing document.)
25	Q. Do you see, "The advertisement was captioned
1	'A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers'"; do you
2	see that?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. "The advertisement stated, in part, as follows:"
5	I'm going to read to you number c.
6	A. C?
7	Q. "There is no proof that cigarette smoking is one
8	of the causes of lung cancer"; correct?
9	A. That's what it states there, yes.
10	Q. And you believe that statement to be false at
11	that time?
12	A. At that time I believe it to be ambiguous,
13	perhaps false.
14	Q. But --
15	A. I am not sure.
16	Q. Okay. And when you read that statement, --
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. -- when you were given this assignment, --
19	A. Right.
20	Q. -- you had the same belief? It was either false
21	or perhaps false? Or perhaps ambiguous?
22	A. Or ambiguous. And self-serving.
23	Q. Self-serving?
24	A. Self-serving, yes.
25	Q. And when you read that, again, you didn't
1	broaden your inquiry?
2	A. No.
3	Q. You didn't demand to take a look at that issue?
4	A. Not at all.
5	Q. Then you see the statement I read to you
6	earlier, d, right? "We accept an interest in
7	people's health..."?
8	A. Yes, you read that earlier.
9	Q. -- "...as a basic responsibility, paramount to
10	every other consideration in our business"?
11	A. I recall you reading that, yes.
12	Q. When a company makes a statement like that
13	publicly and states that they're going to make our
14	health the number one concern and paramount, and when
15	they state it they should do it; right?
16	A. Oh certainly.
17	Q. Then it says in item paragraph -- page
18	seventeen, paragraph f, it says we always --
19	A. Page seventeen, paragraph?
20	Q. F.
21	A. A, B, C, D -- oh here, first one, right.
22	Q. Correct.
23	"We always have and always will cooperate
24	closely with those whose task it is to safeguard the
25	public health"?
1	A. I've seen that.
2	Q. And you would expect if they made a statement
3	like that, that they would give over and disclose any
4	information and research that they have related to
5	health issues to the public health bodies; correct?
6	A. I would hope so, yes. Yes.
7	Q. Because that's what they're saying they would
8	do?
9	A. Pardon me?
10	Q. That's what they're saying they would do?
11	A. Yes, of course.
12	Q. And if they didn't do that, if they didn't give
13	that health information they had to the surgeon
14	general or to the CDC, --
15	A. Right.
16	Q. -- or to other public health bodies,
17	legislatures, on and on, then they would be in
18	contradiction of f?
19	A. I would think so, yes.
20	Now you're asking me my opinion here and that's
21	what I'm giving as a personal opinion.
22	Q. Yeah. We'll talk about that.
23	A. And I hope it's clear to you that I am in fact
24	an anti-cigarette advocate.
25	Q. A what?
1	A. An anti-cigarette advocate.
2	Q. You told me you had a bias and that you came
3	back to neutral?
4	A. That's right. And I do believe that there
5	should be controls, yes. Strong controls.
6	Q. On cigarettes?
7	A. I think the State of Minnesota should, in fact,
8	be more vigorous in enforcement of its laws.
9	Q. Okay.
10	A. That's my personal opinion.
11	Q. Yeah. Thanks.
12	Look at page seventeen, it says the
13	Tobacco Institute now -- and you understand that that
14	was now an entity formed by Hill and Knowlton and all
15	the tobacco companies?
16	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form of the question.
17	THE WITNESS: I am aware of that.
18	BY MR. MANNING:
19	Q. They ran an ad captioned, "A Statement About
20	Tobacco and Health"; right?
21	A. Uh-huh.
22	Q. It said, "We recognize that we have a special
23	responsibility to the public -- to help scientists
24	determine the facts about tobacco and health, and
25	about certain diseases that have been associated with
1	tobacco use."
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. They state they fully recognize a special
4	responsibility to you and me; right?
5	A. That's what it says there, yes.
6	Q. They also go on, then, in b, there, the last
7	sentence, to say, "We pledge continued support of
8	this program of research until all the facts are
9	known"; do you see that?
10	A. That's what it says, yes.
11	Q. And with that kind of a pledge of continued
12	support, you would never expect them to suppress
13	facts; right?
14	A. I would hope not.
15	Q. You'd never expect them to take scientists in
16	who were discovering things about cigarettes and
17	safety and other issues and burn the research, would
18	you?
19	A. I would hope not.
20	Q. You wouldn't expect them to fire people because
21	they were doing research in areas that they got
22	uncomfortable with?
23	A. I would hope not.
24	Q. Because, in fact, what they should do is do that
25	research and share it with the public health bodies,
1	right?
2	A. I would hope they did.
3	Q. That's what they pledged to do, right?
4	A. That's what they pledged to do.
5	But as a historian, I have no evidence that they
6	did or didn't do that. Because I did not, in fact,
7	research that topic. That is not my topic of
8	research.
9	Q. I understand.
10	A. I wanted to make that very abundantly clear.
11	Q. Oh, you've made it abundantly clear.
12	And what I'm going to make abundantly clear at
13	the end of the deposition, just so you know, after we
14	read through this together again, once again, even
15	though you've already done it once on your own, --
16	A. Uh-huh.
17	Q. -- I'm going to ask you whether or not you will
18	broaden that question. Whether you have the
19	integrity, as an academician in this state to take it
20	on yourself to broaden that inquiry. I'm going to
21	ask you that. I'm not asking you now, but I'm just
22	going to tell you that I'm going to ask you that
23	later on.
24	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form of the
25	question.
1	MR. MANNING: It's not a question.
2	MR. PURVIS: Then I object to the speech.
3	MR. MANNING: That's fine.
4	Objection noted. And then I'll stop there.
5	BY MR. MANNING:
6	Q. Paragraph twenty-eight, sir.
7	A. Twenty-eight?
8	Q. Yeah.
9	A. Okay.
10	Q. See it says, "Also, in 197O the
11	Tobacco Institute ran an advertisement captioned,
12	"The question about smoking and health is still a
13	question"; do you see that?
14	A. I see that, yes.
15	Q. And in your historical analysis the question
16	about smoking and health was not still a question in
17	197O at all?
18	A. Not at all.
19	Q. The fact is you phrased it before, beyond a
20	shadow of a doubt there was no question that smoking
21	caused cancer?
22	A. That is correct.
23	Q. Then, sir, if you go to page nineteen, under the
24	title "The Campaign of Deceit and
25	Misrepresentations"; do you see that?
1	A. Uh-huh.
2	Q. Paragraph thirty, it says, "In actuality the
3	industry's promises of full disclosure and objective
4	scientific research were never fulfilled"; do you
5	recall reading that?
6	A. I'm reading it now. I don't recall back to that
7	time.
8	Q. "Instead, the trade associations -- dominated by
9	public relations officials and attorneys, as opposed
10	to independent scientists -- have served as industry
11	fronts in a campaign of deceit and misinformation
12	aimed at undermining the public perception of the
13	health risks of smoking"; do you see that?
14	A. I see that, yes.
15	Q. "Research was undertaken not in pursuit of the
16	scientific truth on smoking and health, but to aid
17	the industry in its public relations and litigation
18	battles. Research that might confirm the health
19	risks of smoking was concealed."
20	A. I see that.
21	Q. Do you recall reading that generally?
22	A. Yes, I do.
23	Q. Those were significant words, weren't they?
24	They charged this industry with something that was
25	deceitful; correct?
1	A. That is correct.
2	Q. And misrepresenting the American and Minnesota
3	people?
4	A. That's what it says.
5	Q. And when you read that, again, you did not
6	broaden your research question?
7	A. No, I did not.
8	Q. Now, then you see down -- I'm not going to read
9	all of these any more.
10	A. Surely.
11	Q. Unless you want me to, I will.
12	But do you see where the next paragraph,
13	paragraph thirty-one, it quotes a document from a CTR
14	meeting -- Council Tobacco Research; right?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. And was written in 1981. And the document
17	states, it's quoted, "When we started the CTR Special
18	Projects the idea was that the scientific director
19	would review a project. If he liked it, it was a CTR
20	special project. If he did not like it, then it
21	became a lawyers' special project"; do you see that?
22	A. I see that, yes.
23	Q. That sounded fairly outrageous, didn't it, when
24	you read it?
25	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
1	THE WITNESS: I have no idea what procedures are
2	in industry-sponsored research. No, I do not.
3	BY MR. MANNING:
4	Q. None?
5	A. I have no idea what they are.
6	Q. Okay. So when you read that, you just thought
7	maybe that's industry procedure?
8	A. Could be.
9	Q. You thought maybe that's what all companies do?
10	A. Could be, yes.
11	Q. So that didn't strike you as outrageous at all?
12	A. Not at all.
13	Q. Then, sir, if you can please just read --
14	A. Pardon me?
15	Q. I said then, sir, if you could please turn to
16	page twenty-two?
17	A. Twenty-two?
18	Q. Yes.
19	And just read paragraph f, if you which, in its
20	entirety.
21	A. (Reviewing document.)
22	I've read it.
23	Q. Do you see that it's a quote from a tobacco
24	document -- tobacco company document, sir?
25	A. I see it as a quote, but it doesn't say where
1	it's from.
2	Q. Did you read that -- do you recall reading
3	something to this effect when you read the complaint
4	back in --
5	A. I couldn't say, but I assume I did, yes.
6	Q. And it ends by saying, it's important that the
7	public -- "In the cigarette controversy, the
8	public -- especially those who are present and
9	potential supporters -- must perceive, understand,
10	and believe in evidence to sustain their opinions
11	that smoking may not be the causal factor"; do you
12	see that?
13	A. I see that, yes.
14	Q. And when you read that did you conclude that
15	it's very possible that the tobacco companies were
16	making statements that it was not -- smoking was not
17	causative of cancer?
18	A. One can assume from that statement that that's
19	what they were doing, yes.
20	Q. And one can assume from that internal document
21	that they knew that it was a strategy that was a
22	whole new strategy, that was not a vehicle for
23	victory?
24	A. That's what it states.
25	Q. Right.
1	And one can also assume from that document, it's
2	fairly clear, that it's not the truth, to say that it
3	wasn't causally related?
4	A. That -- the fact -- that what -- that the
5	causative question?
6	Q. The fact that they're going to continue to state
7	to people that they -- and hope that people will
8	perceive, understand, and believe in evidence to
9	sustain their opinions that smoking may not be the
10	causal factor, it's sustaining a falsehood?
11	A. Sustaining a falsehood as then perceived, yes.
12	Q. I'm going to ask you to turn to page
13	twenty-five, sir.
14	A. Uh-huh.
15	Q. See paragraph forty-two there, please?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. Just read it in its entirety there and over --
18	A. Going into the next page?
19	Q. Yes, please.
2	0 A. Okay.
21	(Reviewing document.)
22	MR. MONICA, JR.: While we are reading, can we
23	have a time check, please?
24	(Discussion had off the record.)
25	MR. PURVIS: For the record, the reporter has
1	indicated that we've been going now for five hours
2	and fifty-seven minutes. And I believe the witness
3	is willing to continue on further this afternoon, if
4	counsel so desires.
5	MR. MANNING: Completely your -- the witness's
6	and your discretion. Totally your call.
7	Start tomorrow morning whenever you say.
8	I mean I don't want to go -- I don't want to go
9	today much beyond 6:00.
10	MR. PURVIS: I think --
11	THE WITNESS: That's fine.
12	MR. PURVIS: -- we're looking closer to 5:00 or
13	5:30.
14	MR. MANNING: Whatever is your call.
15	THE WITNESS: Yes, I have read paragraph
16	forty-two.
17	BY MR. MANNING:
18	Q. Thank you.
19	And you recall reading something to that effect
20	back in the -- I keep missing this -- I think the
21	fall of '94?
22	A. '95. Whatever. About the start of this.
23	Q. Right.
24	A. But any -- do I remember -- I don't have any
25	recollection specifically of this, but it does not --
1	it would not be wrong to state that I have read it,
2	yes.
3	Q. The subject of a safer cigarette was not
4	something that was -- I mean that's not brand new to
5	you as we sit here today?
6	A. No.
7	Q. And you either became aware of that through
8	reading this complaint or the Kluger book?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. One of the two sources?
11	A. Yeah. One of the two sources.
12	Q. Or both?
13	A. Or both.
14	Q. And have you asked anybody any questions about
15	what the activity of the tobacco companies were to
16	kill a safer cigarette?
17	A. No.
18	Q. You would not expect a company that had pledged
19	itself to the health of the American people to do
20	whatever it could to, in fact, kill a cigarette that
21	may be safer, would you?
22	A. I would hope they wouldn't.
23	Q. By this document does it appear, at least by the
24	document, that the lawyers were pretty heavily
25	involved in all of these -- in the decisions with
1	respect to a safer cigarette?
2	A. So the document says.
3	Q. Then if you look over on page twenty-seven,
4	paragraph forty-five.
5	A. Forty-five?
6	Q. Yeah.
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. Do you see where it's now talking about here the
9	smokeless cigarette, Premier. And then it says,
10	"The Shook, Hardy attorney wrote that the smokeless
11	cigarette could have significant effects on the
12	tobacco industry's joint defense efforts and that the
13	industry's position has always been that there is no
14	alternative design for a cigarette as we know them.
15	The attorney also noted that unfortunately the
16	Reynolds' announcement seriously undercuts this
17	component of industry's defense"; do you see that?
18	A. I see it.
19	Q. You know Mr. Purvis is from Shook, Hardy?
2	0 A. Yes, I do.
21	Q. And do you recall reading this back at the time
22	you first got involved?
23	A. I don't recall the specific item. But I'm sure
24	I must have read it. If it were in that original
25	report -- complaint.
1	Q. And you've not asked him, "Well, you know,
2	Mr. Purvis, why don't you get me the documents from
3	your own law firm," --
4	A. No.
5	Q. -- "that your own lawyers have written. Just
6	give me those, so I could read them to see whether or
7	not this question that I'm researching on behalf of
8	the tobacco companies ought to be broadened"; you
9	didn't even do that, did you?
10	A. Not at all. Because I'm not interested in what
11	the tobacco companies did or did not do. That is a
12	research project for some other historian, perhaps in
13	this case, I'm not sure. Or some other time. Or a
14	historian that you would engage, perhaps. I have no
15	idea.
16	Q. Is that your understanding of how it works?
17	That -- that we, the State of Minnesota, would have
18	to engage a historian? That we, the State of
19	Minnesota --
2	0 A. I have no idea.
21	Q. -- cannot expect a historian to render an
22	objective opinion and do an objective analysis based
23	on an objective issue?
24	MR. PURVIS: Object to form.
25	THE WITNESS: All historians give an objective
1	opinion, an objective analysis, if they're
2	functioning as a historian. And that's exactly what
3	I'm doing here.
4	BY MR. MANNING:
5	Q. I understand.
6	Now I'm going to ask you to turn to page
7	thirty-two, please?
8	A. Thirty-two?
9	Q. Thirty-two.
10	A. (Complying.)
11	Q. There's a reference here to Addison Yeaman, who
12	was then the general counsel of Brown & Williamson,
13	who offered some of the most critical memorandum. He
14	subsequently became director of CTR. It says,
15	"Yeaman wrote in a 1963 analysis that: a) Nicotine
16	is addictive. b) We are, then, in the business of
17	selling nicotine, an addictive drug. c) Cigarettes
18	cause or predispose lung cancer. d) They contribute
19	to certain cardiovascular disorders. e) They may
20	well be truly causative in emphysema, et cetera."
21	Fifty-eight, it goes on, "Yeaman suggested that
22	Brown & Williamson accept its responsibility and
23	disclose the hazards of cigarettes to the surgeon
24	general."
25	To your knowledge cigarette companies didn't
1	follow Mr. Yeaman's advice, did they?
2	A. I don't know whether they did or not.
3	Q. You don't -- as you sit here today, you as a
4	historian, have no knowledge whether the cigarette
5	companies disclosed to the surgeon general that
6	nicotine is addictive, that they're in the business
7	of selling an addictive drug, that it causes lung
8	cancer, that it contributes to cardiovascular
9	disease, and causes emphysema? You don't -- you
10	don't know whether the tobacco companies ever said
11	those five things to the surgeon general, do you?
12	A. It does not appear in the '64 surgeon general's
13	report that they did.
14	Q. Yeah.
15	A. That's the only way I can answer that question.
16	Q. Sure.
17	A. I don't know what they did outside of that.
18	Q. I understand.
19	And it would appear, by at least this portion of
20	this document, that they didn't follow Mr. Yeaman's
21	advice; right?
22	A. On the basis of the '64 surgeon general's
23	report, yes.
24	Q. Yes, they did not disclose?
25	A. Yes, they did not disclose. Yes.
1	Q. So you did read, as you've indicated, and I'm
2	just saying this by way of context, then, the entire
3	complaint that you had back in the fall of '95 or the
4	spring of '95?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. And whatever was it in by way of quotations from
7	documents, and we've read some samples of those, you
8	read?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And you were aware, then, at that time, that
11	there were some very serious charges being made
12	against these tobacco companies?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. Charges of fraud; right?
15	A. I don't recall the word fraud in this
16	statement. Could be.
17	Q. You don't recall that word?
18	A. No.
19	It could be.
20	Q. Charges of lying?
21	A. By indirection it's there, yes.
22	Q. You don't recall that it was specifically there?
23	A. I don't recall. It may be there, but I don't
24	recall it, yes.
25	Q. You recall that at least it was implied or
1	indirectly it was there that they were lying?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Do you recall that it was at least implied or
4	directly there that they were manipulating public
5	opinion?
6	A. So it's stated, yes.
7	Q. And they had been engaged in the manipulation of
8	public opinion for a long period of time; you saw
9	that?
10	A. So the complaint alleges, yes.
11	Q. And you knew that the question that you were
12	going to research to some degree involved public
13	opinion?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And so you knew specifically that the charges in
16	this complaint impacted narrowly the question that
17	you were going to research?
18	A. Only in a very narrow way.
19	Q. Public opinion?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. To the degree that these companies manipulated
22	public opinion, it surely would impact it?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. And that's not taking into account in your
25	report? It can't be because you --
1	A. Well, no, it's -- what do you mean by not taken
2	into account?
3	I took into account, in my report, what in fact
4	the historical record -- public historical record
5	showed. That is what the people had before them.
6	Not what was in hidden files, hidden archives, that
7	subsequently were revealed as a result of this
8	litigation.
9	Q. All right.
10	A. I looked at the public record, period.
11	Q. To the degree that the tobacco companies were
12	manipulating and impacting public opinion, you did
13	not undertake any research to determine how they were
14	doing that, if they were doing that, to what degree
15	they were doing that, and on and on; correct?
16	A. No. That's correct.
17	(Exhibit 3137 marked for identification.)
18	BY MR. MANNING:
19	Q. Now, sir, I want to show you what's been marked
20	as Deposition Exhibit Number 42; correct?
21	A. It's marked 3137.
22	Q. Yep. That's great, thanks.
23	What is it marked again? 3137?
24	A. That's my copy.
25	Q. Yeah, you're right. You're right. Thanks.
1	Now this is a letter, is it not, sir, written by
2	Mr. Cowan, you can see on the fifth page, who is the
3	president to Gerald Long, the Executive
4	Vice President of R.J. Reynolds, in May of '91;
5	right?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. I'm going to read to you some portions of the
8	document and ask some questions. So if you want to
9	read the entire document you go right ahead.
10	A. Should I read it now?
11	Q. Whatever you want to do. Whatever you're most
12	comfortable with.
13	A. I'll read it now.
14	Q. Go right ahead.
15	A. (Reviewing document.)
16	Seems to be some kind of a problem here.
17	Oh, I see. Okay. Fine.
18	I've read the document.
19	Q. Sir, in this document --
20	You've never seen it before, right?
21	A. I've never seen this before.
22	Q. You are aware that I designated, prior to your
23	deposition, five days ago, a list of documents that
24	were sent to all your lawyers here saying that I
25	might show you these documents?
1	A. I saw numbers -- list of numbers, which I
2	couldn't identify one way or another since I don't
3	know what the numbers refer to.
4	Q. Right.
5	And I'll represent to you that this was one of
6	those documents --
7	A. Fine.
8	Q. -- on that number, but you never saw it?
9	A. No. Never saw it.
10	Q. And it would appear to you -- you're used to
11	doing this kind of thing, looking at documents and
12	seeing what context -- and how they speak, right?
13	A. That's correct.
14	Q. So this is a letter by a Warren Cowan, who is
15	the president of Rogers & Cowan, a public relations
16	firm in Beverly Hills, California; right?
17	A. That's -- address, Wilshire Boulevard,
18	Beverly Hills, correct.
19	Q. And he's writing to Gerald Long, the Executive
20	VP at RJR, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina; right?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And he's wanting an increase to a hundred fifty
23	thousand dollar budget?
24	A. That is correct.
25	Q. For the next year?
1	A. That is the operative cause for -- purpose of
2	the letter, it seems to me.
3	Q. Right. And he's kind of laying out in the
4	letter some of the things that they did for them in
5	the prior year?
6	A. That's what it says, yes.
7	Q. And he says his primary objective for the year
8	will remain, "...to have smoking featured in a
9	prominent way, especially when it is tied favorably
10	with celebrities"; do you see that?
11	A. Yes, I have.
12	Q. Now, when you read this did you compare -- when
13	you read that, do you remember what the advertising
14	code said that they voluntarily agreed to in 1964?
15	A. I don't recall the specifics of the details, but
16	I recall the general kind of content, yes.
17	Q. You do recall that at least by this time in 1981
18	there wasn't supposed to be TV advertising of
19	cigarettes?
20	A. No TV advertising, that is correct.
21	Q. So this would appear to be a relatively cute way
22	to get around that ban, doesn't it, to hire a PR firm
23	to put cigarettes in the hands of prominent people on
24	talk shows and on and on, doesn't it?
25	THE WITNESS: Yes.
1	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
2	BY MR. MANNING:
3	Q. Pardon me?
4	A. I think it's a way of getting in front of the
5	public, yes.
6	Q. Sure.
7	And it would also appear to be a way of
8	circumventing the restriction on advertising on
9	television, doesn't it?
10	A. I would not know whether that would be the
11	purpose. But the purpose to make it more glamorous,
12	perhaps. But circumventing advertising, I wouldn't
13	know that.
14	Q. You wouldn't know that?
15	Now, do you know that what the cigarette
16	advertising code said about making things more
17	glamorous through sex appeal and on and on?
18	A. I don't recall the specifics.
19	Q. You just don't remember that?
20	A. No.
21	Q. So you can't make a determination, as a
22	historian here, about how this type of correspondence
23	relates to the cigarette advertising code?
24	A. Not at all.
25	Q. Because you didn't analyze the cigarette
1	advertising code in detail?
2	A. That is correct. In addition to which I do not
3	know the context of this letter. What preceded it,
4	what followed it. I don't know what the relationship
5	was of Roger and Cowan to Mr. Long or to the
6	company. I don't know what followed it. What was --
7	actions were taken, if any.
8	And, furthermore, it's not of interest to me,
9	since it's not a major subject that I was concerned
10	with in the historical research.
11	Q. We'll see if it ever does become of interest to
12	you as we talk about it, okay?
13	A. Sure.
14	Q. Look at the fourth paragraph. It says --
15	A. On the first page?
16	Q. It does tend to tell you about their
17	relationship, like correspondence does; right?
18	It says, "We believe our first year produced
19	some excellent results in many different areas to
20	help accomplish the objective. Briefly, these
21	activities include..." And it goes on. Putting
22	cigarettes in film strips; right?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. In films, with movie stars; right?
2	5 A. That's what Mr. Cowan says, yes.
1	Q. Like Burt Reynolds, and Farrah Fawcett, and
2	Marsha Mason; right?
3	A. That's what Mr. Cowan writes.
4	Q. And you have some general understanding that
5	these are films that appeal to people who are under
6	eighteen years old? Do you understand that?
7	A. I have no way of knowing which of these films
8	actually appeal to under eighteen and which appeal to
9	people over age eighteen.
10	Q. How about "Blowout" with John Travolta? Do you
11	have an understanding that that would appeal --
12	A. I've never heard of that.
13	Q. Never heard of that one? So you wouldn't
14	understand whether that would appeal to anyone under
15	eighteen, right?
16	A. I have no way of knowing.
17	Q. No problem.
18	A. The "Jazz Singer" probably would not. I mean
19	about a Jewish cantor who becomes a jazz singer is
20	not a major theme that would be of appeal to people
21	under eighteen.
22	"Cannonball Run" I've never heard of.
23	Q. You also see that they encourage smoking there
24	on page two on the television talk shows; right?
25	A. That's what it says in the letter, yes.
1	Q. It talks about their promotional work in Europe
2	at the Cannes Film Festival that they could do;
3	right?
4	A. That's what the letter says.
5	Q. Appear to have wide-ranging context--to the film
6	industry, television, television talk show, various
7	other things; correct?
8	A. That's what Mr. Cowan claims.
9	Q. He talks about the -- page three, the Ebony
10	Fashion Fair; right?
11	A. Page three? I'm sorry?
12	Q. Page three, in the third paragraph, he talks
13	about the Ebony Fashion Fair, in which they think
14	their services could be helpful; right?
15	A. I'm sorry. Where on page three?
16	Q. Third paragraph.
17	A. Third?
18	Q. Begins, "In this vein... "
19	A. "In this vein... "
2	0	Okay. Right. Okay. Go ahead.
21	Q. Talking about the Ebony Fashion Fair there;
22	right?
23	A. The Ebony Fashion Fair, yes.
24	Q. Which their services could be helpful; right?
25	A. That's what it says.
1	Q. Then they're talking about their conversations.
2	They've already spoken with James Caan about the
3	Winston rodeo program; right?
4	A. That's what it says, yes.
5	Q. Then you see on the next page where they talk
6	about Zsa Zsa Gabor.
7	A. Sorry?
8	Q. Down in the fourth paragraph on the bottom.
9	A. Fourth paragraph on page?
10	Q. Four.
11	A. Page four.
12	Q. Right before the end?
13	A. The Lucille Ball Backgammon, that one?
14	Q. Correct.
15	A. Pardon me?
16	Q. Yes.
17	A. Yes. Go ahead.
18	Q. "During the last few days we have been able to
19	get Zsa Zsa Gabor and Harold Robbins... "
2	0	Down two more.
21	A. In the last -- oh during. I see. Okay. Yes.
22	I see that.
23	Q. Were you aware before today that the tobacco
24	companies hire public relations firms to work in
25	Hollywood with TV shows and films in an effort to
1	promote tobacco smoking? Were you aware of that?
2	A. I've seen --
3	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: I've seen such statements made,
5	yes.
6	BY MR. MANNING:
7	Q. Where? In the complaint?
8	A. No.
9	Q. Where?
10	A. May have been in the complaint, but I've seen
11	it, you know, in general accounts. General
12	discussion.
13	Q. This is the first time you've seen the specifics
14	on that?
15	A. Letter of this kind.
16	Q. So it confirms for you in your mind that that
17	kind of activity was in fact taking place in 1981?
18	A. I assume it was.
19	Q. And you surely interpret this letter as an
20	attempt by this public relations firm to promote
21	smoking in whatever way it can; correct?
22	A. I would think so, yes.
23	Q. And the tobacco industry is paying a hundred
24	fifty thousand dollars or this is a proposal to pay a
25	hundred fifty thousand dollars to this one firm, one
1	company, to this one firm in LA, in that year, for
2	this specific targeted message?
3	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
4	BY MR. MANNING:
5	Q. Correct?
6	A. That's what it says.
7	(Exhibit 3138 marked for identification.)
8	BY MR. MANNING:
9	Q. Sir, showing you what's been marked as Document
10	3138, do you see that it's from a D.S. Burrows to a
11	Mr. L.W. Hall, Junior, October 6, '92?
12	A. That's what it says on the --
13	MR. PURVIS: Correction. I believe it's '82.
14	MR. MANNING: 1982. I'm sorry if I misspoke.
15	Thank you.
16	BY MR. MANNING:
17	Q. And the re on it is, "NBER Models of Price
18	Sensitivity By Age and Sex"; correct?
19	A. Uh-huh.
20	Q. Right?
21	A. That's what it says.
22	Q. I'm going to turn to the second page, if you
23	will, under "Conclusions"; okay? Do you see where it
24	says, "But the loss of younger adult males and
25	teenagers is more important to the long-term, drying
1	up the supply of new smokers to replace the old.
2	This is not a fixed loss to the industry--its
3	importance increases with time. In ten years
4	increased rate per day would have been expected to
5	raise this group's consumption by more than 50%"; do
6	you see that?
7	A. That's what it says.
8	Q. If you then turn to the next page. Do you see
9	where it says, "Importance of Price Impact by Age/Sex
10	To Total Industry"; do you see that?
11	A. Attachment A?
12	Q. Yes, sir.
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. Do you see under the "1982 Importance to
15	Industry," the first category is
16	"Teenagers 12 to 17"?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Then it analyzes them in some numbers there,
19	doesn't it?
20	A. That it does.
21	Q. Percent of smokers. Rate per day. Importance
22	equals percentage of total consumption. Do you see
23	that?
24	A. I do.
25	Q. It does another analysis by age group, but one
1	of the three age groups analyzed is teenagers twelve
2	to seventeen; correct?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And then under Roman Numeral Number II,
5	"Importance to Price Impact," those same teenagers
6	are analyzed once again; correct?
7	A. That's what it shows.
8	Q. Is this the first time, sir, that you have seen
9	a tobacco company document that specifically is
10	discussing teenagers?
11	A. This is the first time and only time. If this
12	is, in fact, a tobacco company document. I have no
13	way of knowing what this is.
14	Q. Okay.
15	A. I have no idea who Mr. Hall is, who Mr. Burrows
16	is. What NBER Models Of Price Sensitivity are.
17	Or -- I have no way of knowing the providence of this
18	document, which is one thing that we historians have
19	to do.
2	0 Q. Sure.
21	And so if it was just one document, out of all
22	the millions of documents in the depository, and
23	there was only one that talked about teenagers,
24	twelve to seventeen, then it may take on less
25	prominence. But if there were lots of them in --
1	from every company, that talked about them, then it
2	might take on more prominence; right?
3	A. Not to me. For this particular historical
4	research.
5	Q. Oh, for the question you've asked, for your
6	report, this wouldn't even be important, would it?
7	A. No.
8	Q. Because it has nothing to do with the knowledge
9	of Minnesotans, --
10	A. Exactly.
11	Q. -- does it?
12	But it does tell you that at least in 1982 --
13	and I'll represent to you it's a tobacco company
14	document, okay? Produced by them, not by us.
15	A. I'll accept your statement.
16	Q. Thank you.
17	Now, with that fact in front of you, it at least
18	is evidence that there is a tobacco company who is
19	studying teenagers to some degree; correct?
2	0 A. According to this document, yes.
21	Q. Yeah. And then, if you go back here, on page
22	eight of the document, --
23	A. Page eight?
24	Q. Yes, sir.
25	A. Yes.
1	Q. "NBER Price Elasticities Among Youth 12 to 17";
2	do you see that?
3	A. I do.
4	Q. It says, "The Fairness Doctrine was also found
5	to have an important negative effect during its first
6	year, accounting for a three percentage point drop in
7	twelve to seventeen incidence."
8	Do you know what the Fairness Doctrine is?
9	A. I have no idea.
10	Q. So in your historical analysis, that you did
11	of -- that you previously described, and I won't
12	summarize or characterize. You have uncovered
13	nothing or ever learned what the Fairness Doctrine
14	is; correct?
15	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
16	BY MR. MANNING:
17	Q. You never heard of it?
18	A. Oh, I wouldn't say I never heard of it. I may
19	have, but I don't recall it at the present time.
20	Q. You don't know what it is?
21	A. Not unless you define it for me, and then I
22	could tell you whether I've heard of it or not.
23	Q. You can't define it for me?
24	A. No. I have no idea what it means, right.
25	Q. So I realize this is not your question, which is
1	the knowledge of the State of Minnesota, but to
2	backtrack, it's at least the first time in your
3	evolution in this work, in this case, where you have
4	physically seen a tobacco company document that talks
5	about twelve- to seventeen-year-old teenagers?
6	A. That is correct.
7	Q. Now you know that at least one such document
8	exists?
9	A. So this shows, yes.
10	THE WITNESS: May I take a break at this point?
11	Just a two-minute break. This is one of the --
12	MR. MANNING: I understand. Take your time.
13	(Recess taken.)
14	BY MR. MANNING:
15	Q. Sir, I'm going to show you what's been
16	previously --
17	A. Are we through with this one?
18	Q. Yes, sir.
19	Put that complaint aside there, too, if you'd
2	0 like.
21	A. Okay.
22	Q. Make your life easier.
23	I'm going to show you what's been previously
24	marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1031, okay?
25	A. 1021, yes.
1	Q. I -- I'm seeing 1031. Am I wrong?
2	A. 1031. Oh yes, I see that right now. Yes.
3	Q. Good.
4	And the title of that document is "Strategic
5	Research Report," right, by RJR?
6	A. That's what it says there on the cover page,
7	yes.
8	Q. February 28, 1984?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. Right?
11	It's from a Diane --
12	A. February 29, 1984.
13	Q. From Diane Burrows, right?
14	A. Diane S. Burrows, From. Yes.
15	Q. The title of the document is "Younger Adult
16	Smokers: Strategies and Opportunities"; right?
17	A. So it says.
18	Q. If you turn to the next page, the Abstract here,
19	and the document says, "Younger adult smokers are
20	shown to be critical to long-term brand company
21	growth in the past, present, and future"; right?
22	A. That's what it says, yes.
23	Q. "Younger adult performance of the six major
24	brands of the last half century was identified to
25	find" --
1	"Was" -2	A. Was analyzed.
3	Q. "...analyzed to find four common
4	strategies/circumstances leading to their younger
5	adult strength. They capitalized on: Changes in
6	external factors"; right?
7	A. That's what it says, yes.
8	Q. "2: Growth sectors among young adult smokers"?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. "3: Out-of-touch competitors"?
11	A. It's so written, yes.
12	Q. And "4: Product mildness, communicated
13	positively."
14	A. So it says, yes.
15	Q. "Key recommendations include: 1) Establishment
16	of a separate younger adult smoker program unit with
17	customized procedures, measures, improved information
18	resources, and a less competitor-centered focus";
19	right?
2	0 A. That's what it says.
21	Q. Then it says, "2) Attention to Blacks,
22	Hispanics, females, social acceptability, pricing,
23	and potential enhancement of product acceptability";
24	right?
25	A. That's what it states here.
1	Q. Do you know what Diane Burrows was referring to
2	when she said younger adult smoker in this document?
3	A. No, I do not.
4	Q. I'm going to ask you to turn now -- the next
5	page is the table of contents.
6	A. Uh-huh.
7	Q. We'll move beyond that to the next page, which
8	is the Management Summary.
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. The "Purpose" and underneath that there's "The
11	Importance of the Younger Adult Smoker"; right?
12	A. Yes.
13	You asked previously what was referred to as
14	younger adult smoker. In the first paragraph it
15	identifies them as 18- to 24-year-olds.
16	Q. Great.
17	A. Is that correct?
18	I can't ask a question. Sorry.
19	Q. I see that statement there, in brackets; right?
20	A. Yes. Statement in brackets. Right.
21	Q. We'll move on.
22	A. Uh-huh.
23	Q. At the two bullet points it says down there
24	under "The importance of younger adult smokers": --
25	A. Yes.
1	Q. -- "The renewal of the market stems entirely
2	from eighteen-year-old smokers"; right?
3	A. That's what it says.
4	Q. "No more than 5% of smokers start after age
5	twenty-four"?
6	A. That's what it says.
7	Q. "The brand loyalty of eighteen-year-old smokers
8	far outweighs any tendency to switch with age"?
9	A. That's exactly what it says there.
10	Q. "Thus, the annual influx of eighteen-year-old
11	smokers provides an effortless momentum to successful
12	first brands." And then there's a star or an
13	asterisk; right?
14	A. Uh-huh.
15	Q. Says "i.e." at the bottom. "Those which appeal
16	to eighteen-year-old smokers rather than switchers,
17	ages nineteen to twenty-four"?
18	A. That's what it says here.
19	Q. So now it would appear they're narrowly
20	targeting just the eighteen-year-old group; right?
21	A. That's what it says here, yes.
22	Q. "Marlboro grows by about .8 share points per
23	year due to eighteen-year-old smokers alone"; do you
24	see that?
25	A. I see it.
1	Q. I'm going to go to the next page, if you will.
2	A. (Complying.)
3	Q. Under the title, "Successful Younger Adult Brand
4	Strategies of the Past": A review of the five key
5	brands in the last half century -- Pall Mall,
6	Winston, Marlboro, Kool, and Newport -- shows that
7	each built considerable strength among young adult
8	smokers well ahead of its upsurge in market share.
9	Their strategies succeeded almost invisibly, hidden
10	from competitors in the critical but low-volume
11	younger adult smoker market"; do you see that?
12	A. Yes, I do.
13	Q. The last two bullet points, if you will, on that
14	page?
15	A. The last two?
16	Q. Yes.
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. "In every case, the major younger adult brands
19	have been succeeded by a brand which was positioned
20	to be different from its predecessor and better
21	in-touch with the younger adult smokers of the time.
22	Me-too strategies have never worked."
23	Next one. "All of these successful brands have
24	stressed positive product messages, as opposed to
25	problem/solution and have provided milder/smoother
1	product delivery than their predecessor"; right?
2	A. I've seen that. Yes, it's so stated here.
3	Q. If you go over to "Implications/Recommendations
4	For RJR"; will you just read number one?
5	A. Number one?
6	Q. Yes.
7	Just read it to yourself.
8	A. (Reviewing document.)
9	Yes, I have read number one.
10	Q. Based on your review of this document so far, at
11	least, you would agree that in 1984 RJR is -- and
12	Diane Burrows at RJR is writing a document that
13	underscores the importance of the young adult smoker?
14	A. Diane Burrows so indicated, yes.
15	Q. And it's also clearly focusing on the
16	eighteen-year-old person; correct?
17	A. The document shows that, yes.
18	Q. If you can turn then, to the next page, titled,
19	"Younger Adult Smokers: Strategies and
20	Opportunities" "Introduction." Do you see that?
21	A. I'm sorry?
22	Q. Maybe the next one.
23	A. Which page number? Oh yes, I have it here.
24	Q. There's not a number on it.
2	5 A. I have it.
1	Q. That's all right. Introduction there, see?
2	A. Right. Uh-huh.
3	Q. The last sentence of the first paragraph.
4	"Furthermore, if we are to compete effectively, we
5	must recognize the imperative to know and meet the
6	wants of those who are eighteen and have already
7	elected to smoke, as well as those of older smokers";
8	do you see that?
9	A. Yes, I do see that.
10	Q. Now, when they say those who are eighteen and
11	have already elected to smoke, you would agree a fair
12	interpretation of that is that some may have elected
13	to smoke prior to eighteen?
14	A. One would assume that, yes.
15	Q. Now, sir, I'm going to ask you to turn way back
16	in the document.
17	A. To?
18	Q. If you look at the pages on the right hand, at
19	the bottom, they're numbered 50192.
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. 8526.
22	A. 8526?
23	Q. 8526 I'd like you to go to.
24	A. 8526. Yes.
25	Q. And you see that graph there at the top of the
1	page on -- entitled "Appendix B"? 50192 8526?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Right-hand column says percentage; right?
4	A. The right-hand column -- the left-hand column.
5	Q. I'm sorry. Thank you. The left-hand column.
6	It's a little late. I misspoke.
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. Says percent; right?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And the bottom says age; right?
11	A. That's correct.
12	Q. And the age starts with thirteen and goes all
13	the way to twenty-four, doesn't it?
14	A. That's what the graph so shows, yes.
15	Q. Yeah.
16	And then there's a bullet point right below that
17	graph that says, "More than two-thirds of male
18	smokers start by age eighteen"; do you see that?
19	A. Yes, I do.
20	Q. Gives the percent at thirteen, fourteen,
21	fifteen, sixteen -- sixteen and seventeen are very
22	high, aren't they?
23	A. Sixteen?
24	Q. Age sixteen and age seventeen.
25	A. Age sixteen and seventeen? I can't read the
1	percentage figures on the left, they're not very
2	clear. But it looks to me as if it's about thirteen
3	percent. Little less than thirteen percent.
4	Q. Okay. But as to the relative, in relationship
5	to the other graph, they're the highest, sixteen to
6	seventeen?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. And eighteen there's a decline?
9	A. Eighteen is next highest, yes.
10	Q. Nineteen and twenty it tapers off dramatically?
11	A. That is correct.
12	Q. Up to twenty-four?
13	A. Yeah. That's what the graph shows.
14	Q. Yes. And so it would appear to be, at a
15	minimum, a graph that's focusing in some way, shape,
16	or form, on behavior of teenagers, doesn't it?
17	A. Smoking behavior.
18	Q. Yes.
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. And it would appear in this large document on
21	"Strategic Research Report," titled "Younger Adult
22	Smokers: Strategies and Opportunities," at a minimum
23	you, as a historian, would conclude on review of this
24	graph, that it's this information that they want to
25	review, that it has some importance to them?
1	A. I'm not a corporate historian or a company
2	historian, but I would assume that that's something a
3	company would be interested in, yes.
4	Q. Right.
5	A. And, therefore, my response would not be as a
6	historian, but just as an ordinary person.
7	Q. All right. And as a historian you don't know
8	whether or not by this point in time in 1984 that RJR
9	had made it a policy that whenever they spoke about
10	kids, they always just started at eighteen, they
11	didn't speak about them younger?
12	A. I have no knowledge about that.
13	Q. Nobody's ever talked to you about that before?
14	A. No.
15	Q. And you've not asked about it?
16	A. No.
17	Q. Now this is the second document that you've seen
18	in which there's at least some focus by the tobacco
19	industry on teenagers; correct?
20	A. That is correct. Both of them I've seen this
21	afternoon.
22	Q. Correct.
2	3	A. Which you've shown me.
24	Q. Right.
25	A. Are we through with that one?
1	Q. Yes.
2	I show you, sir, what's been marked as
3	Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1038, okay?
4	A. Okay.
5	Q. You've never seen that document before, have
6	you?
7	A. Pardon me? No.
8	Q. You've never seen this before, have you?
9	A. No, not at all.
10	Q. This document is titled, a "Marketing
11	Development Intelligence Center", the "MDIC"; right?
12	A. The cover page indicates that, "MDIC." Yes.
13	Q. And the date on this, at least by those two
14	signatures -- one of them is 1/17/85 and the other is
15	5/9/85; right?
16	A. That's in the lower left-hand corner, so those
17	dates do appear.
18	Q. And then the next page is a document called
19	"RJR" and it's marked "Confidential"; right?
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. And there's a box that says "Question" and the
22	question is, "Are Younger Adult Smokers Important?"
23	A. Yes. Indicated there. Yes.
24	Q. Now, let's turn to the next page.
2	5 A. (Complying.)
1	Q. Have you ever heard the word FUBYAS,
2	F-U-B-Y-A-S?
3	A. What language is that, sir?
4	Q. Just look at it here in the document.
5	A. (Complying.)
6	Q. Have you ever heard that word, FUBYAS?
7	A. No.
8	Oh, it's an acronym. I see.
9	Q. I suppose you might say it's tobacco language.
10	A. It may be tobacco language.
11	Q. Internal document tobacco language.
12	A. But it's actually an acronym for a phrase. I
13	see that, yes.
14	Q. Right. And you see what that phrase is, First
15	Usual Brand --
16	A. In the parenthesis it so indicates, yes.
17	Q. First Usual Brand Younger Adult Smoker?
18	A. That's what it says.
19	Q. And you, as a historian, this is the first time
20	you're ever aware that tobacco companies have ever
21	used the word FUBYAS?
22	A. That is correct.
23	Q. Or targeted, or looked at, or studied a first
24	usual brand of younger adult smokers?
25	A. Yes.
1	Q. This is the first time you were ever aware of
2	it; right?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And it says here that FUBYAS are "Those younger
5	adults who are already smokers but have reached the
6	stage of choosing a first usual brand"; right?
7	A. That's what it says, yes.
8	Q. And then it goes on there and says, "FUBYAS, not
9	switchers, have driven the success of the key brands
10	of this century. They are leading indicators of
11	growth and decline"; do you see that?
12	A. I do.
13	Q. Next page.
14	A. (Complying.)
15	Q. "Strong performance among FUBYAS is critical to
16	long-term share in the total market."
17	Next bullet. "Although switching can be
18	important in the near-term market, loyalty and thus
19	FUB smokers are the driving force over the
20	long-term"; right?
21	A. That's what it says, yes.
22	Q. Pretty strong language, isn't it? It's a
23	recognition by this company that First Usual Brand of
24	Young Adult Smokers is critical to their economic
25	success; right?
1	A. I have no idea whether that's strong, weak, or
2	normal type of language used in these types of
3	reports. I don't see these kinds of reports.
4	As a historian, I'm not a historian of corporate
5	America and, therefore, I don't look at these kinds
6	of reports.
7	Q. But, in fact, historians do review corporate
8	America?
9	A. Pardon me?
10	Q. Historians do review corporate America?
11	A. Oh certainly.
12	Q. Sure.
13	In fact, historians write corporate histories
14	for corporations?
15	A. Absolutely.
16	Q. You have colleagues that have been hired by
17	major Fortune 100 companies, paid thousands of
18	dollars to come in and write a hundred-year history
19	of the company?
20	A. Absolutely.
21	Except I don't do that.
22	Q. But you know that it can be done?
23	A. Oh certainly.
24	Q. You could do it?
25	A. Oh, I could.
1	Q. Right. If someone --
2	A. But I'm not fully qualified to because I haven't
3	been trained in corporate structures and corporate
4	history.
5	Q. But if someone came to you, to do that, somebody
6	might -- you might say, "Well, I'm not really
7	specifically trained in corporate history. I'm
8	trained in Early American history, but you know, your
9	company is two hundred years old and it spans some
10	history of America, and so I mean it doesn't scare
11	me. I'd be happy to do it. It's probably a finite
12	set of documents and, in fact, I can compare it, fit
13	it in to the rest of American history"; you could do
14	that, couldn't you?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. You would tell them you're not a corporate
17	historian, but you wouldn't back away from the task?
18	A. They wouldn't approach me, but that's another
19	matter.
20	I'm a labor historian. I doubt if corporate
21	America would approach a labor historian.
22	Q. Because you've been on the side of labor?
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. But assuming that that wasn't the case, that
25	there was some corporation that wanted to do that,
1	and in fact had a large portion of their history that
2	was labor-intensive, they might choose you?
3	A. Certainly. I mean anything is possible.
4	Q. Right. And so this is exactly what you, as a
5	historian, would and could do, is undertake a review
6	of documents within a certain corporation?
7	A. Within the context of my expertise and what
8	I'm -- and the research design of the project that
9	I'm working on, yes.
10	Q. Okay.
11	A. Exactly.
12	Q. I'm going to ask you, then, to turn to page five
13	on page 6562.
14	A. 6562?
15	Q. 6562.
16	It's just about eight pages back.
17	A. Okay. Yes.
18	Q. There there's a graph of RJR compared to
19	Philip Morris; right?
2	0 A. Uh-huh.
21	Q. Philip Morris is taking off in the '60s, '70s,
22	and right into the '80s; correct?
23	A. Exactly. Exactly.
24	Q. RJR by '60, roughly '66, is starting to decline?
25	A. Let's see. Two, four, six -- say by '64. By
1	'64, yes.
2	Q. Starting to --
3	A. According to the graph?
4	Q. Yes.
5	A. '64 is the peak year. It declines from then on.
6	Q. Do you know why this is so?
7	A. No.
8	Q. You could study that, though, based on review of
9	their documents?
10	A. But I have no interest in studying that.
11	Q. I understand you don't. But if...
12	Do you have any understanding of why this
13	Philip Morris line takes off in 1960 at all, as a
14	historian, based on your review of documents so far?
15	Any idea?
16	A. Not any historical knowledge of it. But general
17	overview, perhaps.
18	Q. What is that?
19	A. That they were able to market a successful brand
20	cigarette that just took off.
21	Q. And what was that?
22	A. I believe it was Marlboro.
23	Q. Okay. And that's your understanding when you
24	look at this graph?
25	A. Part of my understanding anyway, yes.
1	Q. The next page --
2	A. But now I'm saying that not because I looked at
3	the documents and the historical research. This is
4	not my opinion as an expert in this case. This is my
5	general knowledge.
6	Q. Right.
7	A. Okay.
8	Q. I understand.
9	The next page is "Purpose," okay? "To build on
10	the learning from younger adult smoker opportunity
11	analysis." One, they want "To find concrete
12	principles and models for successful marketing
13	action"; right?
14	A. That's what it says.
15	Q. They want "To move from problem identification
16	to what we can do about it"; right?
17	A. That's what it says.
18	Q. They want an overall strategy, relevant on
19	target positionings, executional guidelines, and they
20	want to know how to reach them and catch their
21	interest?
22	A. That's what it says, yes.
23	Q. So far we've seen nothing, have we, in these few
24	documents that I've shown you, that says, "God, we've
25	got to tell the kids the truth about smoking," have
1	we?
2	A. No.
3	Q. We've not seen anything that says, "Oh boy, we
4	are concerned about the kids. We've stated publicly
5	we're concerned. We're concerned about their
6	health. Let's make sure that we're doing nothing to
7	get the kids addicted"?
8	A. I've seen nothing in these documents to that
9	point.
10	Q. In fact, what we're seeing is something to the
11	contrary? We're seeing marketing efforts in these
12	documents that are targeted towards kids; correct?
13	MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.
14	BY MR. MANNING:
15	Q. Correct?
16	A. I assume that's what we're seeing.
17	I have not seen marketing reports. I don't know
18	what these marketing reports are. I have no way of
19	knowing what the providence of these are. I have no
20	way of knowing who saw this, what they did, how they
21	acted upon it, and what in fact was done. This --
22	I'm seeing this document for the first time --
23	Q. That's right.
24	A. -- and it's not part of the context of my
25	historical research.
1	Q. I understand. We're just broadening your
2	historical research right here in your deposition,
3	you see. And so you're a historian and I'm asking
4	you about these documents that are beyond the
5	question you've identified, but the question we
6	believe is too narrowly defined, you see. So I can
7	do this and it's part of cross-examination.
8	A. Sure.
9	Q. Now the next document, next page. Turn it over,
10	if you would.
11	A. Next page?
12	Q. Yes.
13	It says, "Successful Marketing to Younger Adult
14	Smokers"; right?
15	A. I'm sorry. "To give insight into actions..." is
16	what I have for the next page.
17	MR. PURVIS: Do you have a page number?
18	MR. MANNING: I may have turned wrong.
19	BY MR. MANNING:
20	Q. Let's go to 6566.
21	A. Okay. I like that. I've got it now.
22	Q. Sorry.
23	A. Uh-huh.
24	Q. It says, "Successful Marketing to Younger Adult
25	Smokers"; right?
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. Second bullet point, number two. It says, "Know
3	the target inside out. Market trends"; right?
4	A. That's what it says.
5	Q. And "Mindsets"?
6	A. That's what it says.
7	Q. Next page.
8	A. Uh-huh.
9	Q. "We Can Do It -- Others Did. Two Examples Of
10	Brands That Did It -- And How. Jack Daniels -- The
11	Marlboro of Bourbons. Expected Positioning and
12	Execution. Consistent, Long-term Marketing Effort";
13	do you see that?
14	MR. PURVIS: Excuse me. You misread the line,
15	it's "Unexpected positioning... "
16	MR. MANNING: Thank you.
17	BY MR. MANNING:
18	Q. "Unexpected Positioning and Execution.
19	Consistent Long-term Marketing Effort"?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. Number two: "Budweiser -- Turning A Big Brand
22	Around"?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. It would appear that they're going to study two
25	examples who have done this, Budweiser and
1	Jack Daniels; right?
2	A.	I have not studied Budweiser and Jack Daniels.
3	Q.	They?
4	A.	Oh they, yes.
5	Q.	That's what it appears?
6	A.	That's what they say. That's what they say
7	they're going to do.
8	Q.	Right.
9	Now, sir, if you'll turn to page 6631.
10	A.	66 --
11	Q.	31.
12	A.	31?
13	Q.	Yes.
14	A.	That's going back?
15	MR. PURVIS: 6631.
16	THE WITNESS: Oh, 66? I'm sorry.
17	BY MR. MANNING:
18	Q.	That's all right.
19	A.	Sorry.
2	0	6631. I have it.
21	Q.	See number five, it says "Sex"; right?
22	A.	Number five. "Sex"; that's what it says.
23	Q.	"Last -- But Surely Not Least"; right?
24	A.	I hope it's not least.
25	Q.	I'm just going to talk about the document. I'm
1	not going to characterize it.
2	A. Sorry about that. It's getting late.
3	Q. That's fine. Yeah.
4	And it says, "FUBYAS versus Switchers"; right?
5	A. That's what it says.
6	Q. Under "FUBYAS" it says, "Lots of Dates"; right?
7	A. That's what it says.
8	Q. "Links to Success Need"?
9	A. That's what it says.
10	Q. "Anything Goes"?
11	A. That's what it says.
12	Q. "Links to Excitement Need"?
13	A. That's what it says.
14	Q. Different analysis under switchers; right?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. So at least it would appear to be at least some
17	marketing efforts that are taking sex into account
18	with respect to FUBYAS?
19	A. That's what this documents indicates.
20	Q. Yes.
21	And if that's going on at this company in 1985,
22	at RJR, you don't know whether that's in
23	contravention of the Cigarette Advertising Code?
24	A. I have no way of knowing whether it was or was
2	5 not.
1	Q. You don't know if that's in violation of the
2	code, or what they have said they will not do
3	publicly, do you?
4	A. I have no way of knowing one way or the other.
5	MR. MANNING: Why don't we take our break before
6	we go to the next document?
