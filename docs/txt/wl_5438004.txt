EXAMINATION BY
MS. BUCHANAN:
Q. Good morning, Doctor, how are you?
A. Very well, thank you.
Q. I understand, we talked about before we started that you're losing your voice.
A. A little bit.
Q. Please tell me if you have trouble continuing because I don't mind rescheduling this.
A. I'll do it.
Q. As in previous depositions, if you need a break, please say something to me.
A. Thank you.
Q. Or if you need something to drink, some water, whatever, just let me know.

2Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. Thank you.
Q. Also, as in previous depositions, if you don't understand my question or it is not clear to you, please let me know and I'll
try to rephrase it for you.
A. I'll do so.
Q. Just a moment ago, while you were out of the room, Plaintiffs' counsel told me that you had brought in a new amended
report today; is that correct?
A. Yes. That's correct.
Q. And this applies to all of the cases in which you have been named as a historian?
A. Yes.
Q. We will put this aside for a minute. I haven't had a chance to finish reading it. We will deal with that at another time.
What we are here about today is a supplement that you provided to us previously.
MS. BUCHANAN: Let's mark as Exhibit I the Notice of Deposition Duces Tecum with the attached Subpoena for his appearance
today.
(Defendant's Exhibit 1, Notice of deposition and Subpoena, marked for identification, as of this date.)
Q. Let me ask you first to identify that and make sure that's what we served on you back at the end of November.
A. I have to verify this part. I don't think that it...
Q. Okay. If you have a copy of what was served on you, if you can pull it out, we can compare it.
(Witness reviewing document.)
A. That is the one.
Q. So, that's what was served on you for your appearance today?
A. Yes.
Q. As we always do with your Subpoena, we sent a list of items that you were supposed to bring here with you?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you bring anything in response to that request?
A. I have some notes, some additional notes.
Q. Can I ask you to produce those for me?

3Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. Yes.
Q. During a break, we will make a copy of it.
A. I have some copies, and I have some articles from the Internet.
Q. Everything you brought today, why don't you pull it out. We will take a look at it and make copies of it.
A. Plus, I also have an interview that I made to a habitual smoker.
(English) Not habitual, but.. He said habitual, but...
Q. Did you mean something else when you said ‘empedernidos'?
A. (English) ‘Empedernidos' is like fanatic. Fanatic.
Q. So, you wanted the word “fanatic” instead of “habitual”?
A. (English) Fanatic. Fanatic? How would you translate that, ‘frenetico’? I am not going to use the word, “fanatic.” But it's
kind of, kind of... “frenetic” is the word?
THE WITNESS: ‘Frenetico’, how do you translate that, Licenciada?
MS. BUCHANAN: I don't know if you can hear him, Amarilys. He's asking you how you would translate the word “frenetico.”
THE WITNESS: ‘Frenetico’.
MS. AROCHO MALDONADO: “Frenetico”? Oh, wow.
MS. BUCHANAN: He's asking how you would translate that. And we were translating it as frenetical, frenzied.
A. (English) That's it. Frenzied, yes.
Q. So, that's what you meant by the use of the term ‘empedernido’?
A. ‘Empedernido.’.
(Witness handing documents.)
Q. Are these notes that you made just recently?
A. Two weeks ago.
Q. Was it because you were doing some additional work?
A. Well, I went to check the same newspapers. I went to the same newspapers and I checked them day by day, day by day
and I made some notes.

4Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
Q. And when you say “newspapers,” which newspapers?
A. El Imparcial.
Q. Let me go through the notes page-by-page and ask you about them.
This first page of the notes, what is that about?
A. These are sites in the Internet to look for information on tobacco. I was interested in tobacco in Puerto Rico.
Q. Did somebody give you these websites or did you find them? How did you come to get them?
A. Well, I was checking with my friend, with my colleague. I was checking with the colleague in the computer and we went
to these sites. We searched for tobacco and that's where it appeared.
Q. And which colleague was this?
A. He's the one that's helping me, Professor Marini.
Q. Did Professor Marini find these sites?
A. Well, it came up when we looked for “tobacco,” the sites in Spanish.
Q. So, you put the word “tobacco” into a search engine on the Internet?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you remember which search engine?
A. (No response.)
Q. Yahoo!, Google?
A. Well, it must be Google because that's the most effective one.
Q. Let me ask you: The first note up here that's ww.mind-surf.net, is that the website you went to? Because that does not look
like a full website address.
A. Well, this one came up, but we didn't go to that one. Then we looked for history of tobacco, and then something on Puerto
Rico came up. And under “history,” a lot of information appeared.
Q. Is this the website, sthales.cica.es?
A. Yes.
Q. Is that a www?
A. Yes.

5Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
Q. So, that's one of the websites you went to?
A. Yes. Well, the information contained here is educating for health regarding tobacco and alcohol.
Q. So, specific to Puerto Rico?
A. No, not necessarily. In general. Then we went to Puerto Rico.
Q. What do you mean then you went to Puerto Rico?
A. Well, we then went to Puerto Rico to look at the history of tobacco in Puerto Rico because Puerto Rico was in 20th century
a reproducer of tobacco, in the first half of the 20th century. That's why we looked to see if there was any information.
Q. Was that under this website or some different website?
A. No. That's my note. Regarding Puerto Rico, there is nothing. I started with “cica,” found some information there, but it
didn't interest me.
THE INTERPRETER: Interpreter needs clarification.
(Interpreter conferring with witness.)
A. The information contained here is held regarding tobacco and alcohol.
Q. So, was there nothing at this particular website, sthales.cica that you found relevant?
A. That interest me? No.
Q. Did you go to a website specifically on Puerto Rico?
A. Yes.
Q. What was that website?
A. Puerto Rico and the history of Puerto Rico.
Q. What was the address of that website? What was the web address?
A. Well, I don't remember right now. But I just put in “tobacco Puerto Rico” and something came up there.
Q. I know in the documents you just produced to me there is a printout of what looks like a computer website. Is this the
website you were at?
A. No. This came from drugs and tobacco.
Q. Because that looks like that came from that mind-surf?
A. Possibly.

6Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
Q. What you have there, is any of that relevant to your opinion?
A. Yes. The history.
Q. I thought you told me you didn't go to this mind-surf.net?
A. I didn't remember.
Q. So you did, indeed, go to this website?
A. It seems yes.
Q. So you did print these documents?
A. Yes. And I read them and I studied them.
Q. Let's see what else you have. Is that from the same website, www.pmministries.com/ministeriosalud/tabaco/
fumadorpasivo.htm? Is this the other website you went to specifically with regard to Puerto Rico?
A. Yes. Everything is in Spanish. That's part of that. too. (Indicating.)
Q. So, these are just additional pages?
A. Yes. Here I have this from mind-surf.
Q. What is that in your hands?
A. This is another one. This is drugs and tobacco.
Q. This is www.ieanet.com/drogas/imprimir; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you go to that website?
A. Yes. And this is mind-surf.
Q. Did you go to any websites other than these three?
A. At that time, in those days, no. I tried to look for information in Spanish. I went back again to the site of the Surgeon General
just to review something that has to do with this.
Q. What did you review on the website of the Surgeon General?
A. I tried to see what type of history could be found in the Surgeon General on tobacco.
Q. What did you find?
A. Well, I studied the history regarding the law -- the law in '64 and '65 in Congress and the studies that had been done before.

7Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
Q. And what was the purpose of that?
A. Well, to prepare information for the purpose so that the public could understand that cigarettes, that tobacco could be harmful
to your health. In this case, it wasn't for the public but for Congress, the laws that were going to be established.
MS. BUCHANAN: Before we go any further, let's mark these documents as Exhibit 2.
(Defendant's Exhibit 2, Website printout; five pages of handwritten notes; “Entrevista Miguel Candelaria Piña,” website
printouts, marked for identification, as of this date.)
Q. Let's continue going through your notes here.
On the second page, there looks like some more websites. Is that the CDC website?
A. Yes.
Q. What did you find in the CDC website?
A. Differences in gender in the consumption of tobacco upon using it.
Q. For what time period was that?
A. It was general information.
Q. For what time period?
A. Possibly from '80s, '90s.
Q. Was there anything there relevant to your opinions in this case?
A. Not very relevant because I wasn't interested in gender. I was interested in general things.
Q. The next one, it looks like El Mundo, Salud del Mundo?
A. That's the state of health of people in the world, but I didn't go into it. I went into this one which is here.
Q. That's the pmministries, which we will get into.
A. Yes. Well, this day is the World Day of Tobacco and what happens to the body when you smoke.
THE INTERPRETER: Interpreter stands corrected.
A. When you stop smoking.
Q. What did you find out about World Tobacco Day?
THE WITNESS: Please.

8Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
(Question translated.)
A. Well, I didn't go about it too much because that's a day that's celebrated in Puerto Rico one day out of the year and I thought
that people would be very conscious of that, but people smoke anyway.
Q. Before we get to that, let me ask you another question.
A. Okay.
Q. Do you know when World Health Day began?
A. No. I don't remember right now. But it must be some ten years ago.
Q. You just testified that you thought people are aware of this, but they still smoke anyway.
Let me ask you, Professor: The fact that people smoke doesn't mean that they haven't heard that it's bad; isn't that right?
A. Repeat the question?
MS. BUCHANAN: Can you read back the question, MayLeen?
(Record read.)
A. Can you repeat it again?
MS. BUCHANAN: If you read the question back again, MayLeen?
(Record read.)
A. The fact that they heard what?
Q. You told me just a minute ago that you thought people have heard of World Tobacco Day; isn't that right?
A. Well, yes, I told you that in Puerto Rico, the World Tobacco Day is observed, but people that smoke, smoke anyway that day.
Q. Let me ask you: The fact that somebody smokes doesn't mean that they haven't heard that it's bad for them, does it?
A. No. There's people that smoke that know that it's bad for them. For example, the person that we interviewed there, he says
that he can't stop smoking. That he's tried to stop smoking, that he's even asked for help, but that he can't stop smoking. And
it's a person who was of advanced age. He's active, but he's advanced age.
Q. And he heard that smoking was bad for him?
A. Yes. And his family has tried to help him, but he can't.
Q. Let me ask you this next line here. Is that ‘terapia’?
A. ‘terapia,’ yes.

9Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
Q. Tabaco?
A. Tabaco.
Q. Is that “terapia tabaco” --
A. -- “espana.”
Q. Terapiatabaco.espana.es?
A. That's from Spain.
Q. Is that another website you went to?
A. Yes.
Q. What does it say here, “Tratamiento contra” --
A. -- “tabaco.”
Q. What does it say here?
A. “Adiccion cronica general sobre el tabaco.”
THE INTERPRETER: “General chronic addiction to tobacco.”
Q. So, this note goes with this website?
A. (English) This goes with this, and this goes with this (indicating).
Q. Did you find anything at this website, terapiatabaco.espana?
A. No. I think I took out a copy of the cigarettes, an image.
Q. Let's see what you produced. I think it's this one. Because this came from mind-surf?
A. So, no, I didn't use it, no.
Q. So, you didn't take anything from that website?
A. Well, no. Because the truth is I don't have anything to do with health or medicine, I'm interested in the history of it.
Q. The next website you have here is zonadiet?
A. Zonadiet.com. And the information is the chronic addiction that tobacco produces. When I refer to tobacco, I refer to all
the expression, to smoking, to chew, including people who are passive, meaning they don't smoke but they are next to people
who smoke.
Q. Is there anything in this website that you found troubling to your opinions?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
10Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. Well, possibly. Because there is a lot of information. There is a lot of information that even when I looked at the history of
tobacco, I chose information that I thought was pertinent, was relevant. There is a lot of information.
And the information is clear, let me tell you. But if people had that information constantly, it could help smokers.
Q. Let me ask you about this next one. It looks like www.drugabuse.gov?
A. Yes.
Q. Is that another website you went to?
A. Yes.
Q. What did you find in that website?
A. Well, it says there that it is health also. It is people's health. And it says -- I was interested in something that it mentioned
regarding international treaty, regarding tobacco control.
Q. What about on international treaty on tobacco control, what did that say?
A. Well, it mentions that the governments of the world apparently are looking to -- some of the governments of the world, they're
looking to unite their strengths to control tobacco. But from my point of view as a historian, I know that the big companies
are not going to want to do this.
Q. Let me ask you: Do you know what that treaty says? What are the terms of that treaty?
A. No. Well, apparently, the thing is that the treaty is not established yet. They are looking for ways to organize the treaty so
they can combat tobacco addiction.
Q. It sounds like you expressed an opinion that tobacco companies would oppose that treaty. Is that your opinion?
A. What I said was that there are times when the interests can be more than people's wishes.
Q. What do you mean by that?
A. For example, in the history of the United States, treaties with native Americans were totally ignored, means that they were
never respected.
Q. Let me ask you, Professor: Do you have any information about whether tobacco companies, any tobacco companies, have --
A. No, I don't have information.
Q. So, you don't have information about whether any tobacco companies have ever taken any position on this proposed treaty?
A. No, I don't have any information.
Q. Is that all that you found at that website?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
11Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. It's what interested me.
Q. So, that's all that interests you from that website?
A. Yes.
Q. The next website is ieanet.com?
A. Yes.
Q. What did you find there?
A. Well, it says the drug addiction, the measures that can be taken by different countries to control it.
Q. What measures did you find?
A. No. I was not interested in that.
Q. You were not interested in the measures that different countries had taken to control tobacco?
A. No. Because those measures from those countries, from our point of view, are not taken into consideration unless there is
a reciprocity treaty in order to respect them.
Q. What do you mean by a reciprocity treaty to respect them?
A. Well, I make an agreement with a gentleman to respect his point of view and he accepts to respect my point of view.
Q. Is what you're trying to say that you didn't find that information relevant because it dealt with countries other than Puerto
Rico, and what those countries were doing was not respected by Puerto Rico? Is that what you're trying to say?
A. No. Because here in Puerto Rico does not make treaties, it is the United States that makes treaties. And it's the Government
of the U.S. who can do a reciprocity treaty and include there Puerto Rico.
Q. Let me ask you: Is there information in that website about what the United States Government was doing to control tobacco
use?
A. There possibly is information, but I didn't go into it.
Q. Let me ask you. If the United States Government, of course, Puerto Rico is part of the United States, was doing something --
A. But if the U.S. Government does not want to include Puerto Rico, it can exclude it.
Q. But we have seen other places where the United States Government has expressly included Puerto Rico in what it has done
on tobacco control; isn't that right?
A. Yes.
Q. So, if the United States was doing something on tobacco control and Puerto Rico was involved in it, wouldn't that be relevant
to your opinions?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
12Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. Yes.
Q. Did you find anything in this website about what the United States Government was doing on tobacco control?
A. No.
Q. The next one is labeled page 3. I will ask you about your handwriting there.
A. Yes. That's the ministries page, the page of tobacco.
Q. What is that, ministries tobacco page?
A. This possibly is a website inside the Internet.
Q. Do you have a website address for it?
A. But I think this is here.
Q. You think it is this pmministries.com?
A. Yes. I think that's it. The risks of smoking. The risks, yes.
Q. So, this note refers to the printout?
A. Yes.
Q. “Los peligros del humo de segunda mano.”
A. Yes. I was interested, and I copied it.
Q. What does this say? The keyword looks like ‘peligrosos' there?
A. Yes.
Q. What is the rest of it?
A. Well, it's just that it was a very quick note. It says it is one of the most dangerous and I put some dots next to it, and it says
“printed,” which is that (indicating).
Q. So, that's the printout.
Then the next note has “El Imparcial, Febrero 1950”; isn't that right?
A. Well, I went to the library again and I went over the newspaper page-by-page. I went over the El Imparcial page-by-page
before. I had done on a monthly basis El Imparcial. This time I went page-by-page again. And every article, every ad that I
saw regarding tobacco, that's where I made a note.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
13Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
Well, for example, on this page there is an article that is not relevant to me but that I found interesting that has to do with a
king in Africa, Rodesia (ph), which was before Sambesi (ph). It must be Sambesi. And it refers to how the king would smoke
tobacco, imported tobacco, and that he would pay one woman for every cigar of tobacco that he would smoke. And that he
smoked 40 cigars in 80 years.
THE WITNESS: 40,000.
THE INTERPRETER: Interpreter stands corrected. That was 40,000 in 80 years.
Q. 40,000 cigars?
A. Yes.
Q. When you went back to look, you looked at the month of February, 1950?
A. Yes.
Q. In El Imparcial?
A. Yes. And where I found a page that had something that was related to smoking, I would write it down. For example, here,
in the comics in newspaper, I found that a strip, which is Rip Kirby, which is a very old strip, and the character smoked pipes
and cigarettes all the type.
Q. On the next page, it look like you also went through January 1961 in El Imparcial?
A. Yes.
Q. Is that the next month?
A. No. It's not the same month. It was from the '50s and the '60s. Our samples.
Q. So, you skipped from February of 1950 to January 1961?
A. In that case, yes.
Q. Are these more notes on tobacco ads?
A. Yes. Possibly articles, too.
Q. How do you know whether they're articles or ads?
A. Well, this is an article where it says “Concepción says that coffee and tobacco arc in bankruptcy. The tobacco production
has slowed down.” That's relative to the tobacco agriculture.
Q. So, in the 1950s, tobacco agriculture was really hitting the bottom here, wasn't it?
A. Yes. Apparently there was a necessity for the planting of tobacco apparently. Well, in this one here, when I was growing up
watching TV, it was regarding Roy Rogers. I don't know if you know Roy Rogers, but there appeared somebody smoking.

14Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
Q. Were the only two months you looked at February of 1950 and March of 1961?
A. Yes. Yes. I spent a lot -- I was there for two days.
Q. The next sheet of paper I have here looks like it was your interview with --
A. -- Miguel Candelaria.
Q. Did you do this or did Mr. Marini?
A. Mr. Marini. But we spoke before in order to be able to get him. and he found him and then we spoke and did it.
Q. So, Mr. Marini conducted the interview?
A. Yes. Well, I told him the questions to do.
Q. What questions did you tell him to ask?
A. Well, since when had the person been smoking, and if while smoking this person received any orientation from the
Government of Puerto Rico, or any agency, regarding the fact that smoking was harmful to the person's health or addictive.
Q. Do you know where Mr. Marini found this gentleman?
A. Yes. In his house. He's a friend of both.
THE INTERPRETER: Interpreter needs clarification.
(Interpreter conferring with witness.)
A. Well, this is a person that works outside his home, so he's a person that's hard to get a hold of, and the person smokes Camel
which doesn't sell a lot in Puerto Rico, Camels without filters. He has a contract with somebody to get him the Camels -- what
do you call them? -- the cartons and he gets them week-by-week. It's a businessman that buys them for him.
Q. This Mr. Candelaria is a friend of yours and Mr. Marini?
A. Yes.
Q. How long have you known him?
A. Well, God, maybe 40 years. Well, I didn't even notice that he smoked, it's just that he smokes so naturally. So, when I spoke
with Mr. Marini and I saw that he was a smoker, an ‘empedernido’ smoker.
I interviewed somebody else, somebody with the last name -- who works at the Catholic university. Well, I took down his name
and I interviewed him. And the story that he gave me was that he started smoking when he was 13. The person is 74 and he is
still smoking, and he's an academician. He's retired from the Air Force of the United States, and he's an officer, forma officer.
He still smokes. He's the type of person that you find outside the room smoking.
Q. You don't remember his name?

15Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. Well, I wrote it on the way and I found it and I put it on a notebook. I don't have it with me, but I'm going to give it to you
because it's worth that you have it. And he is ill and he's still a professor, he hasn't retired.
I took down his name and asked him if I could use him for this. Maybe that's why I didn't write it down and I should have. It is
a person that is smoking. I took the name down and I kept it. I have it and I'm going to bring it to you.
Q. What questions did you ask him?
A. Well, I asked him since when he had begun smoking, if he received some type of orientation from his family, government,
school, regarding that smoking was fatal for your health. He said that he began smoking even more -- he started smoking even
more when he went to the army.
Q. When we previously talked about interviews you have done, what you told me is that you asked people if they have been
warned by the government or some agency of the government.
Did you ask this man any questions about whether his family members, somebody at school or anybody had warned him?
A. No. I think the question regarding his family I asked him now.
Q. So, that was a new question you were asking?
A. Yes. Well, it's just that the way I received this information, all the time I thought from the point of view that if the government
had given any orientation to people regarding this. But if the person lived with the family and his parents could have or maybe
-- if he was an orphan.
Q. So, in this interview with this gentleman whose name you are going to provide to me, you brought in your questions to find
out if somebody, other than the government, was warned?
A. Yes. Not this one, but the officer from the Air Force. If you want, I can call the university and ask now.
Q. We can do that at the break.
A. Okay.
Q. To be clear, in the interview that Mr. Marini did. he didn't ask what other people had told him on health hazards of smoking.
but you did ask the gentleman from the Air Force?
A. Yes.
Q. Why did you ask your question?
A. Well, it's just that since I am in this investigation, and I think if I brought in the questions, we can have a clear picture.
Q. So, you think you need to make a more complete or clearer picture about what smokers knew about the health hazards of
smoking?
A. Well. yes. But you sec. the basis for all this is to see if people had received any orientation on this. So. the questions are
to sec if people have received any orientation.

16Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
And that they never received any orientation from their family or their government. They did not receive any information that
they smoked because they liked it, because it was a fad, because they liked it, because it relaxed them or something like that.
Q. But with the gentleman who is retired from the Air Force, you were broadening the picture to determine --
A. I think that there I used the term “family.” I used the term “family,” I think it was father or mother had told him something.
Q. But you asked him if anyone, other than his family members, had told him to stop smoking?
A. No. I think I just asked him if his parents had told him anything. Because as he told me, he began at 13. And 13 is young;
it is beginning to be a teenager.
The truth is that in Puerto Rico, small children wouldn't be continued smokers, but they would experiment. They would see
somebody smoking and they would experiment with cigars or cigarettes.
I remember that even candies, there were candies sold that looked like cigarettes that had the red tip and the rest of it was
white and they would buy it.
Q. Let me ask you: Did you ask the gentleman who was retired from the Air Force whether he had ever read the newspaper
that smoking was bad?
A. Yes.
Q. You did ask him that?
A. Well, I don't remember if it was newspapers. But I do remember that I asked him in general if he had received any orientation,
or heard anything. And he said no.
Q. Did you ask him specifically if he had been taught in school about tobacco use?
A. Well, I don't remember. But the interview was pretty long. I have the notes. I do have the notes.
RQ Q. I would like you to produce those notes to me next time we come.
A. Yes.
Q. Let's talk about this interview that Mr. Marini did.
This gentleman is 70 years old; isn't that right? I will let you refer to the page.
A. Yes.
Q. 70 years old and it says he began smoking at age 15?
A. Yes.
Q. He smoked unfiltered Camels?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
17Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. Yes.
Q. He used matches to light a cigarette?
A. Yes. There is something interesting here. Because he told me that he smokes Camel, but that he doesn't light them with a
lighter because the taste of the cigarette is different if you light it with the lighter or with matches.
That's what he says. And I think he's the only smoker in that town that realizes that.
Q. Was the taste of cigarettes really important to him?
A. It seems like it is.
Q. The next one says, “Me entero sobre el cancer de fumar cigarillos al rededor del año 1975.”
A. Okay. He finds out that cigarettes cause cancer in 1975.
Q. Did you ask him how he found out about that? Or did Mr. Marini?
A. No. No. Well, he found out, possibly, if I talk to Marini. But I think this came as an initiative of the smoker.
Q. So, you think the smoker volunteered that he found out in 1975 that smoking causes cancer?
A. Yes.
Q. And Mr. Marini didn't follow-up on that?
A. No. Marini is also a smoker.
Q. That's fine. But Mr. Marini didn't follow-up on that?
A. No.
Q. Regarding those circumstances or how or why?
A. No. I think this should be a doctor. There is something interesting here also (indicating).
Q. Well, the next line says, he has not received treatment for tobacco addiction?
A. No. Never.
Q. He never asked for any?
A. No. Never. He says that he has tried to stop smoking, but he hasn't been able to. He says that he stops one day, but the next day
he gets very anxious. He says that he wants to stop smoking because he has been for many years with a constant cold and cough.
His family has tried to help him, but he can't. He can't.
Q. Do you know how long he has had that constant cold and cough?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
18Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. No. But possibly since I've known him, some 25 years.
Q. Do you know if he's related that constant cold and cough to smoking? Is that why he's trying to quit?
A. He says that's the reason.
Q. And his family has tried to get him to quit?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know what they have done for him?
A. Well, he didn't tell me. But his family -- he says it very strongly. His family has tried to help him. But he says that he can't,
he gets very anxious the next day. He says that his constant smoking has harmed his family a lot.
Q. Let me ask you. Do you know if he's used anything to help him deal with the anxiety of quitting smoking?
A. No. I didn't ask him that. We didn't ask him, but we could ask him.
Q. It says that he's happy that his children have not started smoking?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know if he has warned his children not to smoke?
A. Yes. Because it seems that they see how he is. He smokes two packs and a half a day.
Q. Are these all the notes? We looked at the interview, we looked at your handwritten notes, we looked at the website pages?
Are these all the notes you brought with you today?
A. Yes.
Q. But you still have more notes to give me; is that correct?
A. I have the notes from Professor -- I forget his last name.
Q. Marini?
A. No. Marini is there.
Q. The Professor you interviewed?
A. The Professor I interviewed in the university, yes.
Q. So, you have the notes from that interview. Anything else that you have that you have not produced yet?
A. No. I'm interested in the history part. I'm going to check newspapers day-by-day. But I'm trying to get over this because the
air conditioning being inside -- it is not smoking, it is the air conditioning that has me like this.

MS. BUCHANAN: Let's mark this as the next exhibit:
(Defendant's Exhibit 3, Supplement of the deposition of Dr. Luis E. Diaz, marked for identification, as of this date.)
Q. Let me show you what I've marked as Exhibit 3. I'm going to ask you: Is that the supplement that you provided to us several
weeks ago?
A. Yes. That's the one.
Q. I know in your last deposition Ms. Schmähl was asking you some questions about this and why you did this and the purpose of
it. I want to focus on some of the things you said. You say here, “1 would like to inform you that we have consulted and revised
for this investigation various sources, among these the local newspapers.” The first one you list is El Mundo: is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. What in El Mundo did you specifically review?
A. Well. I tried to look for information on tobacco, first of all. I found ads promoting different brands tobacco. I also found
articles that had to do with the investigations or findings regarding smoking. In truth, they were very little, maybe one or two.
Q. What years and months of El Mundo did you read?
A. I don't remember right now. But if I can look at my notes. I can see. I remember, for example, there is an article regarding
interviews that were made to important people in San Juan regarding smoking. And I remember there was going to be a workshop
offered for people to go to the United States to take seminars regarding what would be the harmful effects of cigarettes and
smoking. The workshop would be sponsored by the Government of Puerto Rico. And the other articles have to do with tobacco
agriculture.
Q. Let me ask you: For El M undo, have you also produced to us all the notes that you took in relation to El Mundo?
A. Well, yes. The notes that I gave to you are supplemented with notes that I received from a pack -- a packet that I received
from the law firm of Attorney Arocho regarding El Mundo.
Q. And those have already been produced to us. You don't have any new El Mundo notes that you rely on?
A. No. Not yet.
Q. Then the next one listed here is El Imparcial; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. Are these the notes here in Exhibit 2 that you have in El Imparcial?
A. Yes.
Q. That's just for February of 1950?
A. '51.

20Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
Q. February of 1950?
A. There is something in the '40s also.
Q. No. What you have in your notes here is February 1950?
A. '40. Oh, '50, '50.
Q. And then January 1961?
A. '61.
Q. Those are all the notes you have from El Imparcial?
A. At this time, yes.
Q. Are you still making notes?
A. Yes. Not right now, but after this week when the final exams have gone by, I will go back to the library.
Q. So, you plan to do more work on El Imparcial?
A. Yes. El Imparcial, El Mundo. Wherever I find information. Even I'm trying with the contact at the Department of Health,
Ms. Lourdes Forties. She has statistics information that apparently begins from the '80s on.
What happens is that the Department of Health is moving in these following weeks, so they're moving. So, maybe moving
all their things, some information disappears. It shouldn't, but sometimes boxes of information disappears that should be used
for the future.
But she told me that she was sure that there should be beginning from the '80s on. The information that she told us, she told Mr.
Marini, is that they have statistics of people that arrive sick in their lungs, but that they haven't begun any study themselves.
Q. The next thing you have listed here is El Día?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you have any notes that you haven't produced to us on El Día?
A. The notes that I brought you had to do with information that I looked at El Día. This newspaper was mostly in the local area
of Ponce. I didn't really have any relevant information to that.
El Día was the newspaper that was more local to the area of Ponce, to the south, and it concentrated more on social, cultural
things. I didn't even find ads for it.
Q. Let me ask you: Have you produced to us, though, any notes you have taken on your review of El Día? Or are there other
notes that you haven't produced to us?
A. No. I think that parts of El Día that I saw, I brought you the notes.

21Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
Q. So, I have all of your notes?
A. Of El Día, there are not a lot of newspapers. Well, I try to find information, but El Nuevo Día, which is the newspaper that
was El Día in Puerto Rico, the warehouse over in Ponce, that was lost. That's in Ponce.
Q. Now, for these newspapers, El Mundo, El Imparcial and El Día, what time periods are you reviewing?
A. Well, I tried to look at the end of the '30s, the '40s and the '50s. The end of the '30s.
Q. Are you looking at every newspaper printed during each year or are you looking at various --
A. Yes. I'm looking in any year that has to do from '39 to '69.
Q. Up to this point, had you looked at all the El Mundo papers from 1939 --
A. No.
Q. -- up through 1969?
A. No.
Q. How many have you looked at?
A. Well, maybe looking at the samples, like some 120 newspapers. What happens is that I'm doing samples of the decades,
'40s, '50s and '60s.
Q. How do you take your samples?
A. Well, I tried to look at it from a historical point of view, taking into account periods of activity of economic --
THE INTERPRETER: Interpreter corrects himself.
A. -- of financial growth or of growth. And for example, I looked at '51, '52 which was close to an important event to which
the public knew about. It was an event which you're aware of which is the creation of the institution of the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico.
Q. Do you think it is important to look at every paper from 1939 to 1969 to find out what was available for people to know?
A. Well, it's just that when you're doing a study, you can't go to all the information. The best would be to go to all the information,
but that's a lot of time. But if you have an idea of what you're looking for, you can go to a specific period and find it there.
Q. Let me ask you: If what you're looking for is what information is available to people about smoking and health, isn't it
important to look at all of the information available to find that out during the relevant time period?
A. Well, yes, it's important. But here we have a pattern regarding not finding something specific, but more in the public opinion
of what people knew about smoking.
Q. What do you mean by that?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
22Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. To see if people were aware that smoking was harmful for your health. And from the readings that I've done in the '40s, '50s
and '60s, people were not aware of the consequences of smoking.
Q. What reading have you done that leads you to that opinion? What is your specific evidence?
A. Well, no. I have read the history books of Puerto Rico. And in them, there is nothing regarding that.
Q. Let me ask you: The history books you were pointing out are the ones I have here on the table?
A. Yes.
Q. This is Puerto Rico, “Cinco Siglos de Historia” by Scarano, “Breve Historia de Puerto Rico” by Fernando Picó, “Historia
de Puerto Rico” by Loida Figueroa, and “Historia Economica de Puerto Rico” by James Dietz; isn't that right?
A. Yes.
Q. So, those are the books you are relying on?
A. Yes.
Q. What in these books were you looking for? What in these books is relevant to your opinion?
A. Well, the history of Puerto Rico is there. And there is nothing related to health and the use of tobacco.
Q. Well, let me ask you a couple of things.
Are these books about public health and Welfare in Puerto Rico? Are they specific to that?
A. No. But public health is part of history.
Q. These arc general history books, right?
A. Yes. I think that actually that one can also be general (indicating Dietz).
Q. If you're looking for specific history about what people knew or heard about smoking, isn't it important to go look at more
specific information about what they knew about what they heard?
A. Well, yes. Of course. But it is just that my expertise is in history. So, I look at the history of Puerto Rico and how it's related
to the health in Puerto Rico.
If I want to know specifically regarding health, then I have to look at the science articles that could have been done regarding
the health in Puerto Rico. But that's not my field.
So, I look at the history of Puerto Rico and how the history of Puerto Rico is related to the health of Puerto Rico. I'm going
to ask for a two-minute recess to go to the bathroom.
MS. BUCHANAN: Go ahead.

(Whereupon, a recess was taken from 10:11 a.m. to 10:16 a.m.)
BY MS. BUCHANAN:
Q. I think you remember from a previous deposition, you brought me a copy of a book that you just finished working on. Do
you remember?
A. Yes.
Q. That was on Hermano Che?
A. Hermano Cheo.
Q. When you went looking for information to write that book, did you go to general Puerto Rico history books?
A. Yes.
Q. I think you told me in the last deposition -- and we can pull it up when we take a break -- that for that particular book you
reviewed about 40 different documents; is that right?
A. If you refer to documents as in pages? Maybe.
Q. Were any of the documents you relied upon in writing that book, “Breve Historia De Puerto Rico”?
A. I don't think that anything specific is quoted.
Q. How about “Historia General De Puerto Rico”?
A. Well, what happens was that the background for this book, this book, Hermano Cheo, was actually the diary that was found
in one of his daughter's house that was written by him. It's just that this person wrote it in 1951.
He was a very religious person and he had written at some point that he wanted a book about his life to be written. And in
Puerto Rico, it so happens to be that 100 years of this organization was being celebrated, the Hermano Cheo.
I was going to write about somebody else, then I was approached by Monsignor Herminio de Jesus who told me about the book
of Hermano Cheo that had been found -- the documents.
THE INTERPRETER: Interpreter stands corrected.
A. The documents that had been found in his daughter's house in 1951. Well, there was Monsignor Herminio De Jesus who
showed interest in the life of this person being written, because this person was very merciful person. He saw that the church
should promote who this person was and what he did for others, so, it was the point of view of the church to possibly promote
that this person be made a saint.
This book has something which is very specific to it that the others don't have, which is in order to write this book from a
religious point of view, it had to have the permission of the Catholic church.
Q. When you were writing that book, what was most important for you to be able to write that book, these general Puerto Rico
history books or the diary and the specific documents relating to him?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
24Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. For that book in particular, it is more important the diary. Excuse me a moment.
(Whereupon, a short recess was taken from 10:23 a.m. to 10:26 a.m.)
BY MS. BUCHANAN:
Q. Professor, if your goal in this case is to find out what information was available to people on smoking and health and what
people had heard about smoking and health in the '30s up to 1970, wouldn't it be more important to go look at at things like
newspapers and textbooks and publicly available information instead of general Puerto Rico history books?
A. Well, all of it is important in the investigation. It's just that I have an advantage, meaning that I have reviewed the newspapers
and the books for my classwork and I'm prepared for that. So, I know there is no relevant information in terms of that.
Q. These history books that I have here in front of us, when did you review those? Did you review them specifically with regard
to this case or did you review them some time in the past?
A. Well, no. I had seen it before. When this book came out, I read it completely (indicating Scarano). And this book and this
book (indicating Picó). Although, this book is a little more boring (indicating Dietz).
And I read this one, too, when it came first in English and then in Spanish. And it was very important because it had a course
in 19th and 20th century history in Puerto Rico, and this book cleared many things for me.
Q. For the record, the one you said was more boring was the “Breve Historia de Puerto Rico”?
A. And this book -- just for the record, this book quotes even my books. That is considered the best that's been written in
Puerto Rico history.
Q. You're talking about the “Economic History of Puerto Rico” by James Dietz?
A. Yes.
Q. And the “Breve Historia de Puerto Rico,” that's the one you considered boring?
A. Yes.
Q. There is a first book and a second part?
A. There are two volumes.
Q. And the first volume covers from discovery up until 1892; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. And the second volume covers from 1892 to 1900; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. So, this book doesn't even cover from 1930s to 1970s, does it?

25Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. No. When I said that it was boring, it was boring to me. Maybe not for another person.
Q. What was boring about it?
A. It so happens that history has to be sold in an impartial manner. When the author's values go into the book, in that way it
kind of loses what it has.
Q. And the Historia General de Puerto Rico by Fernando Picó, is there anything in there that you consider relevant to your
opinions in this case?
A. Well, Picó's book gives you a more modem view of the 20th Century, specifically after industrialization in Puerto Rico.
Q. Do you know if Fernando Picó talks any about the press in Puerto Rico?
THE INTERPRETER: Interpreter clarification. “Press” meaning?
MS. BUCHANAN: The media.
A. Yes. Yes. He mentions it.
Q. And what does he mention about it?
A. Well, I don't remember right now. I have to look at it. But he's a historian that looks at all points of view and presents all
points of view. And actually, the thesis that is going to be presented at the Catholic university is one that comes recommended
by him, by him as a historian.
Q. Do you know if he expressed an opinion in there that the press in Puerto Rico had a great impact on the community?
A. I have the impression that he did.
Q. Do you know if he expressed any opinion in there about the impact of the press even on those who couldn't read because
of conversations that were going amongst people?
A. Well, I don't remember very well. But once again, I think so. In fact, Picó is one of our best historians, not only here but
in the United States.
Q. Do you know if there is anything in Picó's book about the role of the Protestant church here in Puerto Rico?
A. Yes.
Q. What do you remember about that?
A. Well, I don't remember right now. I would have to look at my notes. But yes, there is something about the Protestant church
in Puerto Rico, it has many followers.
Q. Would you agree with the statement that after the arrival of the United States in Puerto Rico, the Protestant church had a
major impact on the public here?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
26Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. Yes.
Q. Is there anything about this Scarano textbook, “Puerto Rico Cinco Siglos De Historia” that you thought was relevant to
your opinions?
A. Well, to me all history is relevant. It is just that Scarano's view is different from Picó's. Because apparently, the difference
is that Scarano's book is more of a textbook while Picó's book is more essays.
Just as a side point, this has nothing to do with this case. As an example, the notary that took the oath, Antonetti, I told him, you're
from the south of Puerto Rico. He said, “Well, how do you know that?” I said, “Well, it is just that the Antonettis from the south
of Puerto Rico, from the Ponce area, well, they're black. And the white Antonettis were the owners of the Antonetti hacienda.”
So, the black Antonettis, the ones that are still in the Ponce area and they are -- they are the decedents of the slaves that were
in the Antonetti Hacienda. Just to give you an example of how things are related to this case.
Q. Was there anything in this Scarano book that was relevant to these specific opinions that you have here?
A. Well, in general, the information that can be taken from the book is regarding how the people of Puerto Rico, how the people
developed in the '40s; the different opportunities that were available; the statistics of the people that can read and write; the
opportunities of jobs that these people could have.
Remember that at that time to bring all the factories in, you needed a lot of workers. So, that added the opportunities to the
Puerto Rico workers so they can have a better quality of life and even people that couldn't study, couldn't go to school, then at
this point could go to night school and could learn to read and write.
In this case, the people that could interview and write were adults, you know.
Q. Continuing on in the supplement, it says, “...in addition we examined, revised and read many photocopy documents and
articles related to the consequences of smoking tobacco, such documents have been gathered by the Arocho Law Firm.”
Are those things that you previously have produced to us? Or is there anything else?
A. Yes. It was those originally.
Q. The next sentence says, “None of the sources mentioned above shows information that indicates the Puerto Rico government
and its agencies never advised against the use on the consequences of tobacco smoking and its negative effects on health such
as lung cancer and addiction”; is that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. So, you were looking on these materials, newspapers, the documents that Ms. Arocho gave you and these history books, for
whether the government had warned the people here in Puerto Rico on the health effects of smoking; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. Is there anything else you were looking for?
A. Well, in those photocopies, there were also articles from magazines that had to do with the Protestant church regarding
tobacco and the harm to people's health.

27Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
Q. Did you think those were relevant to your opinion?
A. Yes.
Q. So, do you think it was important what the Protestant church was telling people here in Puerto Rico about the health effects
of smoking?
A. Yes.
Q. Even though it didn't come from the government?
A. Yes.
Q. The next sentence is --
A. But I have to clarify something. Those magazines, those articles, those religious articles and magazines would only reach
a certain sector of the population which would be the sectors of the church. Because most of the people in Puerto Rico at that
time were Catholic, and they didn't read those magazines. They didn't want to read those magazines.
Because the propaganda was very strong for one side to the other. I remember that even as a child when I was in church school,
the doctrine school, I was told that I shouldn't even pass by a Protestant church because the devil lived inside. I remember
that. That's how it was.
Q. Do you have any information about how much of the population here in Puerto Rico would have heard what was in the
Protestant magazines? I'm asking for evidence.
A. Very few.
Q. What is your basis for that?
A. Well, because the Protestant church in Puerto Rico, in the beginning of the century, in the '30s, were very small. The
population was in some churches very specific. For example, in the Pentecostal church, that was a group of very scarce resources.
In Puerto Rico, when the big businesses are established --

Q. There is something down here at the bottom of El Mundo. It says, “January 2, 1948”; is that right?
A. Yes. There is an ad from January 2, 1948. And this is an ad for Casa Victor, there is a person listening to the phonograph
and the person is smoking.
Q. Are they smoking cigars?
A. Cigarettes.
Q. That's all the notes you have taken, this and the other notes you produced?
A. Yes.
Q. We will make copies of those over lunchtime.
We talked about this before. Do you remember a book called Don Taso?
A. Yes. But I was telling you before the break that at that time, big companies from the United States came to Puerto Rico,
they came from Missouri, from Georgia, and they established themselves in Puerto Rico, the sugar business. One of them was
the Guánica Central, the Guánica sugar mill.
It was a corporation from New York which brought the businessmen with them, and brought the employees and managed the
place with them. And these people were Protestant, so they built their Protestant structure, their church in Guánica. It is not
really Guánica, it is more Ensenada. But still Guánica. There was also a church, an adventist church from Michigan, also from
Missouri. People came here from Alabama. But people from Alabama are more Catholic.

29Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
So, it was in 1910, 1915 when our church was built, which was a union church in which all the churches would carry out their
ceremony. And this lasted until 1960. The ceremonies would be at different times.
What I want to emphasize is that the corporation was made from different people from the United States, but it was incorporated
in New York.
And one thing that's very particular about this is that people that would go to this church, this Protestant church in Guánica,
were people that earned money, that earned money at the mill and possibly were from a higher social class than the rest of
the people in Puerto Rico.
Q. Let's go back to this Don Taso book, “A worker in the cane.”
It was about the life of a guy who worked on a sugar cane plantation?
A. Anastasio.
Q. He was a poor ‘campesino’?
A. Sugar cane cutter.
Q. Do you remember in that book if there was any discussion about the Protestant church?
A. Yes.
Q. What did the book say about the Protestant church?
A. Well, it's been some time since I read it. But I remember that he would mention that the Protestant church helped him out a
lot in his way of life in order to progress, to improve his way of life. I don't know if it has to do --
THE INTERPRETER: Interpreter corrects himself.
A. I don't know if it has to do with smoking, but I do know it has to do with drinking. If I read it again now, I would pay
attention to if it had to do with smoking.
Q. Do you remember it mentioning that Don Taso gave up smoking when he became born again because the church said not
to do it? Do you remember that?
A. Yes.
Q. He gave up drinking, too?
A. Yes.
Q. And that was because the church said it was bad for you?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you remember there being any talk in that book about the size of Pentecostal revivals here in Puerto Rico?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
30Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. Maybe because I didn't pay too much attention to that due to my Catholic upbringing. But if I read it again, maybe.
Q. Do you remember if the book discussed whether there was information given out by the Protestant church on the radio?
A. Yes.
Q. So, you remember that being in the book?
A. Yes. Yes. You're refreshing my memory.
Q. Do you remember the book talking that by the 1950s, about every town had a Protestant church?
A. Yes.
Q. So, the Protestant church --
A. I remember that also in my small town, there were a few.
Q. So, the Protestant church was widespread throughout Puerto Rico, wasn't it?
A. At least there was a group in each town.
Q. And the people who were part of the Protestant church, were they very open and forward about their views?
A. Well, they were very open and very honest about their points of view. But they were very open and very friendly to people.
Q. Did they talk about their points of view a lot?
A. Yes.
Q. Did they proselytize amongst the people a lot?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you think that that information on smoking and health that was provided by the Protestant church would have made its
way amongst many people via this proselytization and talking to the Protestants who were here?
A. Well, I think that they tried to get their message across. But I don't think that their intention was in as much as to make
people stop smoking, but in as much as getting followers for their religion.
Q. Do you think they told people that they shouldn't smoke because it's bad for them?
A. Yes.
Q. So, even if they might not have gotten them to convert to Protestantism, they were telling people, you shouldn't smoke
because it's bad for you?
A. Yes, they did say it like that. How can I say this? Well, due to the debate, the clash between two sides, people would hear
but they wouldn't listen. They wouldn't do what they were told.

31Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
Q. During that time period, wasn't the Catholic church also saying that smoking was bad for you?
A. Not in the church. Well, I remember that that clash was also more in social terms, meaning that the Catholics were of a
higher class and they didn't want to relate to the Protestants who were of lower social class at that time. That has to do with
the point of view of the Catholic church, in terms of -- many of the priests were in Spanish and they came with the Spanish
background and not with the background of Puerto Rico or the United States, so, that wasn't even discussed.
I do know, for example, that after Protestant service, there is a school, a workshop where you discuss these things. Even this
week I was in New Jersey on Saturday, I went to a Methodist service where this was done. They even spoke about smoking,
which was very interesting to me.
So, the Catholic church, that's not done. Maybe that's the difference. There was no contact between the church until much later,
until the Protestants and the Catholic church -- that the Catholic church called the Protestant church. And the Second Back
Council, in which they called them “brothers” at that time, separated brothers.
Q. Are you familiar with the publication El Piloto?
A. Yes.
Q. That's a Catholic publication, isn't it?
A. Yes. It was published in Guánica.
Q. Do you know if it said anything about smoking and health?
A. Yes. I think I did see an article related to smoking. I don't remember specifically.
But I did read El Piloto as part of my upbringing before I even got into history issues.
Q. What do you remember El Piloto saying about smoking and health?
A. Well, I don't remember specifically. But it mentions things like people shouldn't be smoking as much as they were doing.
Well, because -- no. It wasn't there. Sorry. I can't specifically say. But I do know there were some articles related to health
and tobacco.
Q. Do you know if El Piloto was telling people that smoking was harmful?
A. Well, specifically like that, I don't remember. But I do remember having seen something related to that, quoting Bible. So,
there was something like that. What I mean “quoting the Bible,” meaning that everything that is harmful to you is a sin.
Q. Let me ask you: Do you think what was printed in El Piloto about smoking and health would be relevant to your opinions
in this case?
A. It should be. But not everybody read that.
Q. Do you have any information about how widely published El Piloto was?
A. (English) How what?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
32Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
Q. How widely published El Piloto was?
A. It had circulation in all the Catholic churches. And in the university, we have a collection.
Q. Is that something you're planning on reviewing for your work in this case?
A. No. It's not something that I had. It's not something that I thought of doing. Because there's going to be very few things there.
But I should. I should. The thing about this is that this collection isn't cataloged, so I'm going to have to see all of them.
Q. Now, we've talked before about the role of oral tradition in Puerto Rico?
A. (English) Oral tradition?
Q. Oral. Do you remember?
A. Yes.
Q. Even if you have something that's read by one person, isn't it true that that person will go out and talk to other people about
what he or she read?
A. Yes.
Q. So, the fact that maybe not everybody read a particular publication doesn't mean that people haven't heard information that
was contained in that publication; is that right?
A. Yes. It could be.
MS. BUCHANAN: On that note, why don't we take a lunch break?
(Luncheon recess taken at 12:06 p.m.)
AFTERNOON SESSION
(Time noted: 1:12 p.m.)
MS. BUCHANAN: It is now 1:12. We broke right after noon for a half hour break. Ms. Arocho has not called us back in, as she
said she would. We have contacted Ms. Arocho's office trying to find out where she is so she can call in and we can continue
the deposition, and we have been unable to get her appearance that way.
So, we are going to go ahead with the deposition at this point and break at about two o'clock so Dr. Díaz can make his appointment
in the legislation at 3:00.
LUIS E. DIAZ HERNANDEZ, resumed as a witness and testified as follows:

33Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
Q. Let's refer back to Exhibit 3. This is the supplement to the report that you did.
Before lunch we were talking about this paragraph here, the second paragraph. It says, “None of the sources mentioned above
shows information that indicates Puerto Rico Government and its agencies never advised against the use and the consequences
of tobacco smoking and its negative effects on health such as lung cancer and addiction. Evidently these were not promoted by
the Government to cause such deathly illnesses”; is that right? Go ahead and look at it if you like.
(Witness reviewing document.)
Q. Is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. Your opinions in this case, are they limited to what the Government of Puerto Rico or its agencies did or didn't do?
A. No. I sustained my remarks with what I read and with my general knowledge of history in Puerto Rico.
(Phone call.)
MS. BUCHANAN: Hello, Amarilys?
MS. AROCHO-MALDONADO: Yes.
MS. BUCHANAN: We were just getting started.
BY MS. BUCHANAN:
Q. Professor, this paragraph here, I'm asking you: Your opinions in this case, are your opinions related solely to what the
Government of Puerto Rico did or didn't do?
A. Not only in that. But also that because of the knowledge that I've had as a historian.
Q. I think we're talking about two different things. You're talking about what you relied upon. I'm asking: Are your opinions
about warnings about negative health effects due to smoking, are those related solely to what the government did or didn't do?
You're not opining on what any entity other than what the government did; is that right?
A. Well, I relied on that. But not only just that, but also the aspect that I do know the culture of the people in Puerto Rico and
the history of the people in Puerto Rico.
Q. How does the culture and history of Puerto Rico play into your opinion?
A. Well, as I said to you before, the people in Puerto Rico, if they weren't in the condition of reading, if they didn't know how
to read, and if there was any warning regarding this, they were not aware what was being informed.
Q. Let me ask you, Professor, we talked about this before, including in the last deposition.
The literacy rates here in Puerto Rico have been very high since 1930s, '40s and '50s; isn't that true?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
34Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. (English) Literacy?
Q. Literacy rates?
A. In the '30s it is very low. In the '60s it begins to go up until the '80s.
Q. Do you remember we talked about literacy rates in your last deposition you had with Ms. Schmähl, do you remember that?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you remember what the literacy rates were in the '40s in here?
A. (English) Literacy is ‘alfabetismo’, right?
Q. Yes. Do you remember what those rates were?
A. Yes.
Q. What were they?
A. (English) In the '60s and '70s, it was about 85 to 90.
Q. What about in the '40s?
A. (English) In the '40s, it was about, let's say, '40s and '50s.
Q. Let's take a look.
A. (English) 35, 45.
Q. Do you remember us referring to this book the last time --
A. Yes.
Q. -- “Economic History of Puerto Rico” for the literacy rates in the '40s? Do you remember that?
A. I don't remember exactly. But if it is literacy, it is 45 to 50, or even 35 to 45.
Q. I'm going to refer to you page 308. I'm going to read out of this. I also refer you back to page 118 of your deposition transcript
last time.
It says here, “Literacy rate rose from 68.5 percent in 1940 to 83 percent in 1960 and to 91 percent in 1976.” Take a look at that.
A. (English) Yes. I said in the '70s and '80s, it was higher.
Q. I understand that. But I'm asking you about the '40s. What was the literacy rate in the '40s?
A. '40s?

35Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
(Witness reviewing document.)
A. 68 percent.
Q. So, that was a pretty high literacy rate in the '40s?
A. I said what?
(Witness reviewing document.)
A. 60 percent?
Q. Right. So, in the 1940s, 68.5 of the people were literate, right?
A. Yes.
Q. In 1960, that had risen to 80 percent, right?
A. Yes.
Q. That's a pretty high rate, isn't it? Yes, it is?
A. I think that later it is even higher.
Q. I think it says in 1976 it went up to 91.3 percent? Does that sound right?
A. Yes.
Q. I think you were telling me just a moment ago that you believe, due to the particular culture of the people of Puerto Rico,
that they wouldn't be able to read; isn't that right?
A. No. Not necessarily that.
Q. What did you mean?
A. Well, they could read, but they would read what was convenient to them and not everything that was written.
Q. Do you have any evidence regarding what the people of Puerto Rico were reading in the 1940s, '50s and '60s?
A. Well, no. Evidence -- evidence, per se, there is no evidence of that. But I do have my knowledge of the history of Puerto
Rico of those days. And the knowledge of the people of Puerto Rico, the working people of Puerto Rico, that they weren't very
interested in reading as much as they were interested in surviving.
Q. What is your basis for that opinion? What's the evidence for that?
A. Well, the situation in Puerto Rico, meaning unemployment, the income per capita, hunger that was present in the '30s in
Puerto Rico at that time.
Q. Do you have any evidence that the poor economic situation in Puerto Rico made people not want to read?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
36Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. Concrete evidence? No. But oral evidence? Yes.
Q. What is your oral evidence?
A. Well, what my grandparents would tell me, what my parents would tell me regarding the situation in Puerto Rico at the end
of the '30s and in the first half of the decade of the '40s.
Q. Did your parents or grandparents tell you that people didn't like to read because of the economic situation?
A. No. Not as you're asking, no.
Q. You remember you were talking before lunch about that book, “Don Taso, A worker in the cane”?
A. Yes.
Q. As we talked about, Don Taso was a poor man?
A. Yes.
Q. He was a cane cutter?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you remember that book talking about Don Taso reading the newspaper?
A. Yes.
Q. So, Don Taso read the newspaper, didn't he?
A. Well, Don Taso read the newspapers because he had been given orientation in that sense by the church.
Q. Do you mean by the Pentecostal church?
A. Yes.
Q. Isn't it true that before he became a Pentecostal, he read the newspaper every day?
A. That's what he says. But could he actually buy the newspaper? I don't know.
Q. Well, do you have any reason to doubt the book when it said he read the newspaper even before he became a Pentecostal?
A. No. No. He possibly read the newspapers, the used newspapers. But he read them.
Q. We have a book here that talks about the life of a poor man living in Puerto Rico in the 1940s and '50s?
A. Yes.
Q. And even before he became involved in the Protestant church, he read the newspaper regularly?

37Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. It seems that way.
‘Lo que pasa es que una golondrina no hace un verano.’
MS. BUCHANAN: The translator is trying to figure out how to translate that one. Take your time.
THE INTERPRETER: “It's just that a single bird doesn't make a summer.”
Q. Let me ask you, this book, “Don Taso, a worker in the cane,” was there anything particular about Don Taso? Or wasn't he
like thousands of other cane cutters here in Puerto Rico?
A. No. His case was very particular. Because I knew many sugar cane cutters and they didn't reach the level that Don Taso
reached.
Q. Which sugar cane cutters do you know?
A. Many. Many. Some of them are dead, but I know some.
Q. What are their names? Or what were their names?
A. I can bring you names.
Q. You just can't remember them right now?
A. Not now.
Q. Name some of the cane cutters that you knew.
A. If you want, I can bring it in of people who arc alive, not dead.
Q. How many cane cutters do you think you know?
A. Dozens.
Q. You just can't remember any of their names right now? You know dozen of cane cutters, but you can't remember any of
their names?
A. Well, I can tell you Ramon. I can tell you Fito. Many, many have passed away. Many of these sugar cane cutters moved on
to better things, but I can bring you several names. I come from a sugar cane town.
Q. Let me ask you: What arc the last names of Ramon and Fito?
A. Pérez. Both are Pérez, but they're not related.
Q. Did you ever talk with them about whether they read the newspapers?
A. No.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
38Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
Q. So, you don't know if they read the newspapers or not?
A. No. No. Not with them, no.
Q. How about any of those other dozens of sugar cane cutters that you knew, did you ever talk to them about whether they
ever read the newspaper?
A. No.
Q. So, you don't know whether any of them ever read the newspaper or not?
A. Well, what I do know is that the newspapers at each town were 10 or 12 newspapers for the whole town, so the sugar cane
cutters never had newspapers because they had to go to work at five o'clock in the morning.
Q. But that doesn't mean that they never read the paper at some point, does it?
A. No, that's not proof to say that they didn't read the newspaper. But a great part of the sugar cane cutters were illiterate.
Q. What research have you done to determine that?
A. No. Just the knowledge that I acquired training as a historian.
Q. What specific knowledge did you acquire training as a historian that tells you that sugar cane cutters are illiterate?
A. Direct evidence, my contact with them.
Q. What led you to believe that these people were illiterate, or that large numbers of them were illiterate? Did you do any study
on it? Did you make any research, statistics? What did you do?
A. Well, not -- not about them. But I do know that they didn't go to school, and many of their children didn't go to school
either. They were my friends.
Q. Did you ever talk to any of these sugar cane cutters about whether they went to school or not?
A. Yes.
Q. How many did you talk to?
A. Well, three or four. And I do know that they didn't go to school because their parents needed them at home or because they
didn't have clothes or shoes, and they needed them at home to work at home, to pick up firewood, to pick com. to pick chick
peas or to take the cows to pasture.
Q. Is that your sole basis for your belief that most sugar cane cutlers were illiterate?
A. Well, not necessarily. But if they had gone to school, I'm sure they would be occupying a better position than a sugar cane
cutter.
Q. Do you remember during your last deposition we also talked about school attendance rates among children here in Puerto
Rico?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
39Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. Yes.
Q. In the '40s, '50s and '60s?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you remember what those rates were?
A. In the '50s, 60 or 70 percent.
Q. What about the '40s?
A. In the '40s, probably 40 percent. And even when the war broke out, when the Second World War broke out, many of them
wanted to go into the army, but since they didn't have any school, they didn't pass the tests.
Q. As part of your research in this case, have you reviewed any of the annual reports of the Department of Instruction here
in Puerto Rico?
THE INTERPRETER: Interpreter needs repetition.
Q. As part of your work in this case, have you reviewed the annual reports of the Department of Instruction here in Puerto Rico?
A. No. But I have an idea.
Q. What idea do you have?
A. The construction in Puerto Rico?
Q. Not construction. The Department of Instruction. My question to you was: As part of your work in this case, have you
reviewed any of the annual reports of the Department of Instruction here in Puerto Rico?
A. As part of my investigation in this case, my work in this case? No. But I have seen them in different documents that I have
looked at.
Q. What have you seen about, say, in the end of 1940s going into 1950, do you know what percentage of school age children
were in school?
A. Well, there is a big increase in the amount of children that go to school between the '40s and '50s. A great part of the budget
of Puerto Rico goes into education between the '40s and the '50s. So, the advantage is that we end up not paying for the army,
because that's paid for the United States, so that part of the budget goes into the education, at least in the '50s, '60s and '70s.
Q. Let me ask you: Would you disagree with the statement that in the 1949-1950 school year, about two-thirds of the children
between ages six and 18 were enrolled in school?
A. No.
Q. You wouldn't disagree with that?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
40Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. No.
Q. Isn't it true that between the 1940s and 1950s, not only was there a move to try to educate children, but there was also a
move to educate adults?
A. Yes.
Q. And the government was very active in doing that?
A. [English] Reactive?
Q. Very active.
A. Yes.
Q. So, the government was actively trying to teach illiterate adults how to read and write?
A. That's true. Even in the newspapers, there is articles about that.
Q. Are you familiar with, also in the newspapers, the School Pages being present?
A. What do you mean by “School Pages”?
Q. Are you familiar with a program begun by the Department of Instruction to publish curriculum material in newspapers that
were circulated here in Puerto Rico in pages called School Pages?
A. Well, I don't remember them being called School Pages. But I do know that there was a magazine called “Escuela” that the
Department of Education would hand out.
Q. Do you remember these School Pages being printed in newspapers like El Mundo, El Diario de Puerto Rico, El Día, Puerto
Rico Ilustrado and Alma Latina?
A. Not as School Page. Maybe if you show me one, I can tell you.
Q. I'm talking specifically about curriculum materials being published in newspapers like El Mundo, El Diario de Puerto Rico
and El Día. Are you familiar with that?
A. That must be an ad from the Department of Education with the classes that it would offer.
Q. No, it is not an ad about classes offered. It is actual curriculum material for students and adults, school curriculum materials.
Are you familiar with that?
A. No. No. I'm not familiar with that.
Q. Would that be relevant to your opinions in this case if something like that were printed?
A. It could have some relevance, yes.
Q. And what kind of relevance could it have?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
41Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. Well, students are invited to participate in education programs. It gives them the opportunity to educate themselves and they
benefit that in their quality of life. In some of the newspapers that I looked, there is even an ad for education of adults in '51 to '56.
Q. Do you think that a lot of adults learned to read in the 1950s thanks to these government programs?
A. Yes. Many sugar cane cutlers.
MS. BUCHANAN: Let's mark this.
(Defendant's Exhibit 5, El Día, Ponce, Puerto Rico, 2/19/41, “El cancer de los pulmones puede ser efecto del cigarillo,” marked
for identification, as of this date.)
Q. I'm going to ask you to take a look at that and tell me if you have ever seen that before.
A. No. I had not seen this before. It is from El Día.
MS. AROCHO-MALDONADO: Which is that one?
MS BUCHANAN: I'm sorry. Did you have a question?
MS AROCHO-MALDONADO: What exhibit number is that one that you're showing him?
MS. BUCHANAN: Exhibit 5.
A. It is an article titled “Lung Cancer Can Be from the Effects of Cigarettes.” It is from El Dia and it is from 1941. I had not
seen this one before. It is an article that came from Boston.
Q. What language is this article in?
A. It has Spanish and English.
Q. Where does it have English?
A. An ad of the Government of Puerto Rico.
Q. That's something different, isn't it?
A. Yes.
Q. So, the article is in Spanish, isn't it?
A. The cigarette article is in Spanish.
Q. And the actual title of the article is in very large print, isn't it?
A. It's big, yes.
Q. What's that article about?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
42Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. Can I read it?
Q. Certainly.
(Witness reviewing document.)
A. Well, the title of the article is “Lung Cancer Can Be an Effect of Cigarettes.” These are comments from a correspondent in
Boston. He mentions that it is grotesque that people can enjoy the fact that they're spending time inhaling smoke and spitting
out smoke.
He says that people like it, but that he heard in a conference in Chicago that he heard that the idea was presented that increase in
cancer in the United States is due to cigarettes. There was another idea that smoke from cars in the '30s could also affect lungs.
But it was proven that in the depression, the amount of cars decreased and cancer was still increasing. It also mentions that it
is grotesque to see a woman smoking out in the street. Another important thing that it mentions is that people that are 50 to 60
years old are more susceptible to having lung cancer due to cigarettes.
Q. I'm showing you another article from El Día. This is from 1955. I want you to tell me if you have ever seen that.
(Defendant's Exhibit 6, 6/8/55 El Día article, “Medicos Insisten En Que El Cigarillo Causa El Cáncer,” marked for identification,
as of this date.)
(Witness reviewing document.)
A. It is an article from El Día from 1955.
Q. Have you seen that one before?
A. Yes. It was a study made by the American Cancer Association which was rejected by the Tobacco Industrial Commission, I
think it was. which said that the increase in cancer could be due to atomic bomb tests that were done in Utah, Almagordon and
New Mexico in which the air was maybe poisoned and that could lead to lung cancer.
Q. Let me ask you, this first paragraph: I will read it in English, let you look at it and tell me if I'm wrong.
It says “A majority of investigators, chest surgeons, and pathologists believe that the excessive use of cigarettes can give rise
to lung cancer according to a report today in this city done by the American Cancer Society”; is that correct?
A. Yes. Yes.
Q. Is that what it says?
A. Yes. American Cancer Society.
Q. What do you think somebody reading that in 1955 would think?
A. If I would be reading this now with my preparation, I would be a little bit concerned.
Q. I'm asking you: What do you think somebody reading this in 1955 would have thought?

MS. AROCHO-MALDONADO: Objection. Form.
A. I think that in Puerto Rico, very few people give importance to that article.
Q. Why do you think that? What is your basis for it?
A. It wasn't an interesting article.
Q. Why wasn't it interesting?
A. At that time, it would seem boring if we're going to go back to that time.
Q. I'm asking you: What is your basis, what evidence do you have that would have been boring?
A. The evidence that I have is my preparation as a historian, my career as a historian, with more than 40 years studying the
history of Puerto Rico and of the world.
Q. I'm asking you to point me to something specific. If you had to go to court and prove that somebody in 1955 would have
found that boring, what would you tell the Court, what would you show the Court? What documents?
A. Well, there is no document. I mean, material-wise, I can't prove it. But keeping in mind the social development of the people
in Puerto Rico, keeping in mind the history of the people in Puerto Rico and the social and economic development, then that
would be what I would say.
Q. What history, what socioeconomic development would make people think that article was boring?
A. Well, I'm giving my opinion from my point of view with my preparation, keeping in mind the history of Puerto Rico and
the people of Puerto Rico, they wouldn't read that article as a first page article.
Q. Would they read it at all?
A. I believe that if they would have come up to that article, they would have read the title, the heading, and they wouldn't go
to the small print. A sugar cane cutter wouldn't have read it.
Q. What is your evidence that a sugar cane cutter wouldn't have read it?
A. He had other priorities.
Q. What is your evidence, though, that this sugar cane cutter --
A. Well, there is no material evidence. But a sugar cane cutter needed a better home, needed better food, a better job and a
better life situation. He didn't have time to read the newspaper and to look for articles that he liked.
Q. You think that sugar cane cutter would have read the title?
A. Possibly. At least Taso would have read it.
Q. And he would have seen a title that said, “Doctors Insist That Cigarettes Cause Cancer”?

44Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
A. Yes. But you have to keep in mind and remember that for a person in '55, a doctor was something strange. Medicine wasn't
readily available to everybody, so it was like another world.
Q. Let's go back to the Don Taso book for a minute.
Do you remember the book talking about Don Taso receiving medical treatment in the '50s for his hernia?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you remember the book, Don Taso, talking about Don Taso's wife receiving prenatal care when she was pregnant and
very sick?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you remember that?
A. Yes.
Q. And those were very poor people, weren't they?
A. Well, yes. The government had a system in place, a medical system in place in which poor people didn't need to pay anything
for treatment. And each town had a clinic in which a doctor would go and tend to these cases.
Q. I forgot which deposition it was, but you remember us talking about the biography of Dr. Isaac González Martinez?
A. Yes.
Q. Founder of the Puerto Rican Anti-Cancer League?
A. I have a copy.
Q. And you remember that Anti-cancer League was founded in the late 1930s?
A. Yes.
Q. You remember they started the hospital in the 1940s?
A. Yes.
Q. Where they treated indigents for cancer, didn't they?
A. Yes. Some cases.
Q. Let's go back to this 1941 article for a moment with the large lettering that says, “Cancer of the lung can be an effect of
cigarettes.”
What do you think somebody looking at that in 1941 would have thought?

45Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
MS. AROCHO-MALDONADO: Objection. Form.
A. Well, it's something that I have to tell you about that. I've learned as a historian, and in my training as a historian, that cancer,
the word “cancer” was not very popular among the people. There's even people that died of cancer that were never told that
they died of cancer, that they died of something else, but not cancer.
So the word “cancer” was not very popular, and even among people with scarce resources. So, I don't think that El Día was
effective in reaching all strata of society in terms of getting the message across. So, for me as a historian from the point of view
of a historian. this article is important, but I don't think that at the time it was published, it was an article that was read a lot.
MO MS. BUCHANAN: I'm going to move to strike the answer as nonresponsive.
Q. My question to you was: What do you think somebody looking at this article in 1941 would have thought?
A. Well, I couldn't tell you. I don't think that that article had a great impact. I don't think that it had a great impact. The data is
February of '41, right? That article didn't have a great impact even in Boston where it was written.
Q. What is your basis for those two opinions, that it didn't have any impact here in Puerto Rico or in Boston?
A. Well, because from a historical point of view, Puerto Rico in the U.S. was in the middle of a war at that time --
THE WITNESS: No, not in a war.
MS. BUCHANAN: He said they had not entered into a war yet.
A. Puerto Rico and the United States were in the middle of a war that began in '39. Now, the U.S. had not gone into war yet, but
the German submarines were in sea and they limited a traffic way between publication and the United States and the eastern
part of the United States. So, people were concerned about something else. They were concerned about a war.
Q. So, you think World War II, which United States did not enter until after Pearl Harbor in December of 1941 --
A. (English) Yesterday.
Q. -- yesterday was Pearl Harbor Day, you're correct. December 7th.
You think that the fact that there was a war going on in Europe would make people unable to understand or uninterested in
this article?
A. (English) Not unable to understand.
(Via Interpreter) Well, not unable to understand. But they weren't going to pay that much attention to it. Because there were other
concerns in terms of the consequences of the war. Because the consequences of the war in the beginning were good because the
United States companies in 1939, 1940 sold many war effects to Europe, but then the German submarines started sinking ships.
Q. Let me ask you: Do you think that. say, a 30-year-old man in 1941 was more concerned about the war than the fact that the
cigarettes he was smoking might give him lung cancer?
A. Yes. The head of a family, a 30-year-old man, was more concerned with war than with that.

46Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
Q. You think a 30-year-old smoking man would have been more concerned about the war than the fact that the cigarettes he
was smoking could give him cancer?
A. The person who smokes isn't concerned about that. I think that the nonsmoker would be more interested in that.
Q. What is your basis for that opinion; one being that the nonsmoker would be interested, and the smoker would not be interested
in that? What is the basis for that?
A. Well, my basis for that is that the person who smokes smokes because the person likes it. The nonsmoker doesn't because
the person has probably seen that it can be harmful.
Q. When I ask you for the basis of your opinion, what documents do you have to show me; what evidence? Do you have any
evidence?
A. Well, no. No evidence. I don't have any evidence. The evidence I have is just what I have read from my years as a historian.
Q. What specifically have you read throughout your years as a historian that lead you to those opinions?
A. General history books.
Q. These books here in front of me?
A. These and history of the United States in the decade of the '40s.
Q. Can you point me to anything specific in these books that would lead one to believe that?
A. No.
Q. This will be the last topic, because I know you need to go.
A. No. If you need more time, go ahead.
Q. I want you to make your three o'clock meeting.
You were telling me a minute ago that you didn't think people liked to use the word “cancer”, they weren't interested in the
word “cancer”; is that right?
A. Well, yes, I told you, my grandmother died of cancer. Nobody told her. It was not discussed that she died of cancer. She
died in '41. And the family didn't tell anything about it until 15 or 20 years ago.
Q. Do you think that people in the 1950s had that same view?
A. I think so. I think so. Well, I don't have any evidence, except to what I read throughout the years in preparing to be a historian
and in my career as a historian.
Also when I was young, I had an opportunity to read a lot because I had a library and because the newspaper would arrive every
day. And I receive that Life magazine would arrive and also the national -- well, the Readers' Digest in Spanish.

47Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
So, as a historian, I would find out what was going on in the world. Another thing I did was -- well, there wasn't any TV back
then in the '50s, up until '55, so I had to find ways to entertain myself so I collected stamps.
And I collected stamps from all over the world and I don't remember any stamps having to do with cancer or tobacco. I only
remember two stamps, one was from Columbia that had to do with tobacco and the other one was from Costa Rica, and both
of them were related to agriculture.
Q. Do you remember, not your last deposition, but the one before that, when we talked about the biography of Dr. Isaac Gonzélez
Martinez?
A. Yes.
Q. And we talked about the Puerto Rico Anti-Cancer League?
A. Yes.
Q. And the fact that they began anti-cancer campaigns back in the 1930s?
A. Yes.
Q. And those have been continuous since that time?
A. Yes. I had a lot of pitfalls, but...
Q. You also remember me showing you the letter from Governor Muñoz Marin in which he declared April to be Anti-Cancer
Month, and he allowed the Anti-Cancer League to use the governor's mansion to kick off his campaign.
A. And this man would be for Puerto Rico like a hero, a great man.
Q. Do you think there were other anti-cancer campaigns in Puerto Rico around that same period?
A. No. Not at that time. Not at that time. But there are other groups that were interested in that.
(Defendant's Exhibit 7, 4/7/55, El Día article, “Editorial, Operatión cancer,” marked for identification, as of this date.)
Q. Let me show you. Have you seen that before? Take your time.
(Witness reviewing document.)
A. Yes, I do know this article and I do know the work that the Ponce Oncology Clinic has been making. I personally work in
a campaigning to raise money for them every year.
Q. This article is an editorial from El Día from April 1955, right?
A. Yes.
Q. It is talking about an anti-cancer campaign; isn't that right?
A. Yes.

48Blanca Nieves RODRIGUEZ and Victor Nieves Rodriguez,..., 2004 WL 5438004...
Q. About it is encouraging people to get involved in that anti-cancer campaign, isn't it?
A. Yes.
Q. One more question about this. Isn't this article evidence that people here in 1955, including people in Ponce, were very
interested in cancer and cancer treatment?
A. Well, yes. That's what it says there and that's true. But the people involved in that were people that were well off and people
that were involved in the oncology clinic that Dr. De la Pila found.
Q. But they weren't just helping people who were well off, they were doing this for everyone; isn't that right?
A. Yes. Yes. That is so.
(Defendant's Exhibit 8, 4/3/59 article, “Cliruca Oncologica En Campaña Anual Contra El Cáncer,” marked for identification,
as of this date.)
Q. All right. Take a look at that document.
(Witness reviewing document.)
A. What date is this?
Q. April 3, 1959?
A. Yes. I seen it before.
Q. When did you see this?
A. Possibly when that was published. It's that since we're related to that campaign, there is probably a record. The campaign
in which we raise money was the International Lions' Club.
Q. This is another article about the annual anti-cancer campaign, right?
A. Yes. Related to that.
Q. It is just four years later?
A. Yes.
Q. Same type of campaign?
A. Yes.
Q. So, people are still interested in trying to combat cancer?
A. Yes. Every year there is a campaign, because the hospitals run through the money that it raises.

Q. This is the last document I will show you before we quit.
(Witness reviewing document.)
A. I know this one.
Q. You know that?
A. Yes.
Q. Have you seen that little note many times?
A. Yes. Yes. Always.
Q. This is something we found only a number of dates in 1956?
A. In El Día.
Q. And it says, “Cooperate with the anticancer campaign”; isn't that right?
A. I think that I also seen that, but I didn't give it any importance.
Q. The point of there was to get people to help the anti-cancer campaign, right?
A. Yes.
MS. BUCHANAN: Amarilys, because the doctor has an appointment at three o'clock and I want to make sure you have ample
time to get to your hearing this afternoon, Amarilys.
MS. AROCHO-MALDONADO: Okay.
MS. BUCHANAN: We will adjourn for today. We do need additional time based on the new report he has given us today, but
we will contact you about getting dates for that.
MS. AROCHO-MALDONADO: Okay. Let's talk about that later.
MS. BUCHANAN: Okay. Thank you. We are done for today.
