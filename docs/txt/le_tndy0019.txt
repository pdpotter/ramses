2	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now recording
3	and on the record. Today is August 16th, 2002,
4	and the time is 9:11. This is the Day 2 in the
5	deposition of Allan Brandt. This is the beginning
6	of Cassette No. 1. We can now continue.
7	ALLAN BRANDT, Ph.D.,
8	having first been duly sworn,
9	testified as follows to
10	direct interrogatories
11	BY MR. SMITH:
12	Q. Good morning, Doctor Brandt.
13	A. Good morning.
14	Q. Did you have a chance to look through an updated
15	CV last night?
16	A. I didn't have a chance to get one, so I will
17	certainly make that available to you.
18	Q. Okay. I'd like to hand you a copy of your expert
19	report, which has been marked Brandt 1.
20	(Brandt expert report marked Exhibit 1.)
21	Q. Is Brandt 1 a copy of your expert report in this
22	case?
23	A. Yes, it is.
24	Q. Now, if you could turn to your CV that is attached
25	to the expert report.
2	A. Yes. Yes, I'm there.
3	Q. I was wondering if you've ever signed anything
4	saying that you won’t accept funds from tobacco
5	companies?
6	A. I don't believe that I have. You know, I was
7	aware, for example, that the Harvard School of
8	Public Health had recently passed a faculty
9	resolution that faculty shall not do that, but I
10	don’t believe I’ve ever signed anything that said
11	that I would not accept funds from the tobacco
12	industry.
13	Q. And are you a member of the Harvard School of
14	Public Health?
15	A. I'm not on their faculty. I'm on the faculty of
16	the medical school and the faculty of arts and
17	sciences.
18	Q. So, Harvard wouldn’t bar you from taking funds
19	from a tobacco company?
20	A. I don't believe it's a universitywide policy at
21	this time.
22	Q. Okay. You received a Burroughs Welcome Fund
23	History of Medicine Award.
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. What was that?
2	A.	That was an award to continue my research and to
3	begin a collection of essays on the history of
4	patient/doctor relationships. And that was the
5	proposal for that specific award. But it was a
6	general award to support my research and writing
7	in the history of medicine.
8	Q.	And how about the Charles Culpeper award?
9	A.	Yes, I mentioned that yesterday, and that was —
10	that was a proposal specifically related to my
11	research on the social and cultural history of
12	cigarette smoking in the United States.
13	Q. And it says here that that award ran from 1992
14	through 1995, is —
15	A. Right, it was a three-year award. That’s correct.
16	Q. And was there any process for renewing that award
17	after three years or not?
18	A. There was not.
19	Q. And how much was that award?
20	A. I think that over the three-year period, it was
21	for approximately $80,000 or $90,000.
22	Q. And then you also list that you were a President's
23	Fellow at Harvard University in 1989 and 1990?
24	A. That's correct.
25	Q. And what was that?
2	A.	That was an award to give me a year’s sabbatical
3	leave. And it’s the kind of award where you can
4	apply for a, you know, for support to have time
5	off from teaching.
6	Q.	And what did you do during your year’s sabbatical
7	leave?
8	A.	I worked on my research and writing on both HIV,
9	and at that time I had begun to do some research
10	on tobacco as well.
11	Q. And then the last one on this page is a visiting
12	scholar program in science technology and society
13	at MIT. What was that?
14	A. Right. That was also a year that I had partial
15	sabbatical support from Harvard to take time off
16	from teaching. And that was a no-fund visitor’s
17	program that they provided me with shared office
18	space at MIT; and I — you know, there were a
19	group of other fellows there from other
20	universities.
21	Q. And then you list Rockefeller Foundation, Fellow
22	in the Humanities Award.
23	A. Right. That was, again — I think the Rockefeller
24	Foundation Fellowship in the Humanities helped
25	support the time I was away and spent part of the
2	time at MIT; and that, again, was a general award
3	to support my research and writing. And I think
4	that was the first time that I had fashioned a
5	proposal that drew attention to my concerns about
6	the history of public health and tobacco. And
7	that was a one-year award. I think it was
8	approximately $20,000 to $25,000, something like
9	that.
10	Q. And what exactly was your proposal to the
11	Rockefeller Foundation?
12	A. It was to begin research on a project that, you
13	know, that would look at — use humanistic methods
14	and strategies for understanding the meaning of
15	smoking in American culture over time and how it
16	had changed. And that’s really the beginning of
17	the research on tobacco.
18	Q. Okay. So, your work on tobacco began around 1985?
19	A. Yes, that’s correct. I think that’s pretty much
20	what I said yesterday. As I finished up the work
21	on STDs and HIV, by the mid '80s, I was really
22	beginning to prepare to do major work on tobacco.
23	And I think that the initial proposal was the
24	Rockefeller Foundation proposal.
25	Q. And when did your — I think you mentioned this
2	yesterday, but when did your work on your book
3	start?
4	A.	I'd say the work on the book started probably --
5	it's a little hard to discern sort of my initial
6	sort of research in articles and tobacco and sort
7	of when the book — but I must have developed the
8	book proposal in the early '90s.
9	Q.	How many of the grants you've received were
10	specifically for work on tobacco?
11	A. Well, specifically the Rockefeller grant and the
12	Culpeper grant.
13	Q. Okay, and the total amount of those grants was
14	approximately how much?
15	A. Well, I think I said the Culpeper grant was 80 to
16	90; and the Rockefeller grant was under 30. So,
17	approximately $120,000 to support my work on
18	tobacco.
19	Q. And were any of these prizes that you list on your
20	CV related to tobacco?
21	A. Well, the two book prizes, you know, that it’s a
22	finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Award and
23	the Pulitzer Prize nomination, both were for "No
24	Magic Bullet," which was my work on the sexually
25	transmitted diseases and the early history of the
2	HIV epidemic.
3	Q.	And would it be fair to say you’ve written a
4	number of articles on sexually transmitted
5	diseases?
6	A.	Yes.
7	Q.	What percentage of your publications would you say
8	are on sexually transmitted diseases?
9	MR. BRODY: Objection.
10	A.	Again, we could count them up and look at that.
11	At this point, I would probably say, you know,
12	maybe a half to two-thirds are on sexually
13	transmitted diseases, but—
14	Q.	And how many publications have you had on tobacco?
15	A.	Again, you know, I could race through and count
16	them up. I think I probably had, you know,
17	perhaps as many as eight or ten. I don't know.
18	Q.	And what percentage of your total publications are
19	in the area of tobacco?
20	MR. BRODY: Objection.
21	A.	You know, I would say approximately a third, but I
22	have no objection to our counting. So, I’m making
23	an estimate.
24	Q.	Well, you have your list of publications on your
25	CV?
2	A.	Of course.
3	Q.	Do you want to count them up and see what percent
4	is tobacco related?
5	A.	Yes. I mean, you know, we could do a crude count,
6	but the — real issue is sort of what are major
7	articles, peer reviewed? The CV reflects many
8	things. So, I guess I would say, to characterize
9	my CV for the last decade I've been, you know,
10	focused on tobacco. I've continued to publish
11	some things on HIV and AIDS. I periodically
12	review books. I’ve also done some work — some
13	considerable work in the medical ethics area
14	during that period as well. So, you know, if you
15	want to do the math now, we could do it.
16	Q.	Why don’t you do the math real quick.
17	A.	Okay. Well, my math's not so good, but — out of
18	my head, but, you know —
19	MR. BRODY: Objection.
20	A.	Can I have a pen or pencil, please? I'd just like
21	to start to count up here. I think I’ll number
22	them, and then we’ll go through. (Witness reviews
23	document.) Okay. This is rough. And, you know,
24	I could attend to this a little bit more carefully
25	than in the context of the deposition, but, for
2	example, in my original reports, I counted up
3	approximately 50 listed on this CV. And of those,
4	17 address tobacco in one way or another. So, you
5	know, I think I told you about a third. I think
6	that’s just slightly more than that.
7	Q. Okay. Now, excluding newspaper articles that
8	you’ve written on tobacco, how many of the 17 are
9	left?
10	A. I don't list newspaper articles on my CV.
11	Q. Okay. Excluding book reviews you’ve written?
12	A. I didn't count book reviews. I only counted
13	original reports.
14	Q. Okay. How about did you count editorial pieces
15	that you've written on tobacco?
16	A. I think the only one I counted, which is actually
17	a peer-reviewed piece, is the piece I wrote with
18	Julius Richmond in JAMA. And the reason I list
19	that with my articles is that that piece, as all
20	pieces in JAMA, received peer review. So, I don't
21	list — I don't list things that are not peer
22	reviewed, other than my book reviews on the CV. I
23	have some other peer-reviewed things, but I don’t
24	think they’re listed on the --1 have some other,
25	you know, I sometimes write a newspaper article,
2	but I just don’t list those on my academic CV.
3	Some people do.
4	Q. And you made some markings on your CV there.
5	Could you explain what those are?
6	A. Yes, I think I was explaining the process by which
7	you asked me to count the percentage of articles
8	on my CV that were related to tobacco. So, what I
9	did is I just numbered all of my original reports.
10	That way, I came up with the No. 50. Again, some
11	people number them, but it’s just never been my
12	thing to do. And, then, I went through and noted
13	the articles that relate in some way to tobacco,
14	and I came up with the number — I think it was 16
15	or 17-17.
16	Q. Now, I have a couple of questions about your
17	professional services listed on your CV.
18	A. Yeah. Let me go back to that. Yes.
19	Q. It looks like you list National Academy of
20	Sciences and Institute of Medicine. I think
21	yesterday you had said that you were a member of
22	the Institute of Medicine, right?
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. And the Institute of Medicine is a government —
25	US government organization?
2	A.	It has a quasi relationship with the US
3	government. I think that — I think technically
4	the National Academy of Sciences are — were
5	chartered by the US government. I'm not sure they
6	get federal funding. So, it’s a complicated
7	relationship. But it’s a quasi government
8	organization.
9	Q.	And what kind of work do you do at the Institutes
10	of Medicine?
11	A. You know, the Institutes of Medicine does research
12	on a variety of questions of medicine, public
13	health, public health policy, among other things
14	that they do. But one of their major areas is to
15	take questions that are useful to public
16	policymakers, and try to bring together experts to
17	analyze and interpret what those issues are in
18	order to advise public policymakers about how to
19	do things more effectively.
20	Q. And have you done any tobacco-related work at the
21	Institutes of Medicine?
22	A. I haven't.
23	Q. Now, there's a Committee on Monitoring the Social
24	Impact of AIDS.
25	A. Right.
2	Q. What was that?
3	A. That was characteristic of the kind of work that
4	the Institute of Medicine does. They were very
5	interested in a set of questions, How has AIDS
6	affected medical care in general? How has it
7	affected policies regarding the testing and
8	marketing of drugs? So, that committee was
9	chaired by a well-known biomedical ethicist,
10	Albert Johnson from the University of Washington.
11	And because I had written quite a lot in the early
12	years about the HIV epidemic, about its social
13	impacts, I assume that's why I was invited to join
14	that committee.
15	I worked specifically in the research on
16	that committee on changing policies for evaluating
17	the effectiveness of early HIV medications.
18	Q. And was that committee related to the Institutes
19	of Medicine?
20	A. Yes, I think it’s my -- maybe it's not absolutely
21	clear on my CV. If it’s not, it was an Institute
22	of Medicine study committee. These committees
23	have a very rigorous set of procedures. Once the
24	report’s written, they go out for an extensive
25	peer review. They're generally published where
2	the committee members are listed in the
3	publication. But the specific work they did on
4	any reports use usually not identified in that
5	way.
6	Q.	And when did you begin working with the Institute
7	of Medicine?
8	A.	That was the first full-scale study committee that
9	I had participated in'89. Before that I had been
10	consulted on other projects that the IOM was
11	working on, because they had a project on AIDS
12	stigma. And I remember going down to Washington
13	to give a talk on the history of stigma for one of
14	their study groups. So, they’ll bring in scholars
15	to consult with a study group preparing a report.
16	But these are the only two full-scale study
17	committees that I met with.
18	These committees probably met, you know,
19	over a two-year period, eight to 12 times, had a
20	rigorous writing process, and so on.
21	Q.	And when did you become a member of the Institute
22	of Medicine?
23	MR. BRODY: Objection.
24	A.	I became a member here — it says on my CV — let
25	me just find that. (Witness reviews document.)
2	Here. I was elected to membership in the IOM in
3	1997.
4	Q.	And are you still a member of the Institutes of
5	Medicine?
6	A.	Once you're elected — perhaps people end their
7	membership and so on — but, you know, once you’re
8	elected, you remain a member. I am a member now.
9	Q.	Now, you also list under "Professional service:
10	National Institute of Health, National Library of
11	Medicine, Study Section on History of Medicine."
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. What was that?
14	A. That's a study, that's a study section that is —
15	it's not a study section like some of the NIH
16	study sections, which are built in perpetuity
17	around a particular scientific area of
18	investigation and membership changes, but it was
19	what I think they called an ad hoc study section,
20	in that as long as this funding program was
21	available, they assembled a group of scholars in
22	the historical field to evaluate proposals for
23	research in the history of medicine, which at that
24	time the National Library of Medicine had a grant
25	program to support research in the field. So, for
2	that two-year period, we would meet, we would view
3	applications to the library’s grant program in the
4	history of medicine, usually book projects, but
5	other projects relating to history of medicine and
6	public health; and then the committee would
7	evaluate those proposals in a kind of traditional
8	peer review process; and then NLM would award its
9	grants based upon those assessments.
10	Q. Did you do any tobacco related work in conjunction
11	with your National Library of Medicine work?
12	A. No, I did not.
13	Q. Did the government ask you to review any grants
14	related to tobacco?
15	A. Not to my memory. You know, I don’t remember as a
16	member of that group reviewing projects that were
17	related to tobacco.
18	Q. Did you receive any compensation in conjunction
19	with your work with the Institute of Medicine or
20	National Library of Medicine?
21	MR. BRODY: Objection.
22	A. Those are uncompensated essentially. There may
23	have been a minor per diem that the National
24	Library of Medicine provided to study section
25	members at that time, but I'm not sure it
2	completely covered expenses. So, and the IOM does
3	not compensate the service on its committees,
4	other than to, you know, obviously, get you to and
5	from the meetings and to give you a place to stay
6	when you're at the meetings. So, you know, I
7	don’t think there was any income associated with
8	either of those two areas of work.
9	Q. And under "Professional Service," are any of these
10	professional service activities tobacco related?
11	A. No, I don’t think so.
12	Q. Under "University Committees," you name a number
13	of committees you've been on, right?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. What’s the Health Policy Interfaculty Initiative?
16	A. That's a program that was developed by — it's a
17	kind of long story, but it was — when Neil
18	Rudenstine became President of Harvard around
19	1991/92, he decided that there were a series of
20	areas that should provide more opportunity for
21	interfaculty collaboration between people, for
22	example, who are appointed in the faculty of arts
23	and sciences, school of public health, medical
24	school, law school, business school, and other
25	associated Harvard faculties. So he identified
2	four or five areas that he thought were
3	particularly rich for those kinds of
4	interdisciplinary explorations, and one of them
5	that he identified at that time was health policy.
6	So, the Health Policy Interfaculty Initiative was
7	set up in the early '90s, and there's a kind of
8	steering committee; and it's made up of faculty
9	who hold appointments in the different schools at
10	Harvard; and I’ve served on that committee.
11	Q. And does any of your work on the Health Policy
12	Interfaculty Initiative involve tobacco?
13	A. Not specifically, because it’s an administrative
14	role that I play on that committee. But I guess I
15	would — you know, people are familiar with that,
16	you know, among my scholarly areas of interest,
17	tobacco is important.
18	Q. And then under "Harvard Medical School," you have
19	"Conflict of Interest." Is that a committee?
20	A. Yes, that’s a committee.
21	Q. And what do you do on that committee? That was a
22	committee that I served on. I'm not currently on
23	that committee. But Harvard set up a committee
24	when Harvard promulgated its own rules and
25	guidelines about the appropriate disclosure and
2	limitations of conflicts of interest for its
3	medical school faculty. So, all the faculty at
4	Harvard are required to write a disclosure form.
5	We get a form every year. And where there are
6	disclosed conflicts of interest that potentially
7	could be in violation of the Harvard rules, which
8	is also a way of assuring compliance to the
9	federal rules about conflict of interest — the
10	Harvard rules actually go slightly beyond the
11	federal rules, as I understand it — then those
12	would come before this committee.
13	There were some deminimis rules. There
14	were some monitoring rules. And, so, this
15	committee would assess if a conflict of interest
16	needed to be monitored. If it needed to be ended,
17	and the committee could come to a conclusion that
18	this was a conflict that did, in fact, you know,
19	come up against the rules and should be ended; and
20	then the committee and its staff would monitor the
21	ending of that conflict of interest.
22	Q. And in your work on the Conflict of Interest
23	Committee, did you consider any tobacco related
24	matters?
25	A. No. During that period, no tobacco related
2	matters came up.
3	Q.	Does Harvard have any conflict of interest rules
4	relating to tobacco?
5	A.	It has conflict of interest rules that could
6	relate to any industry. So, I think if you owned
7	an equity interest in tobacco and you were doing
8	work for the tobacco industry, you could be in
9	violation of Harvard's conflict of interest rules,
10	but those rules aren't about tobacco. Those are
11	general rules.
12	Q. And is it true that Harvard's divested all of its
13	tobacco stock?
14	A. My understanding is that Neil Rudenstine’s
15	predecessor, Derek Bok, decided that the Harvard
16	Corporation should not hold tobacco stock, and
17	that Harvard has divested.
18	Q. And why did Harvard do that?
19	A. I think Harvard—
20	MR. BRODY: Objection.
21	A. You know, it's — Bok didn't consult me at the
22	time that he did it. I have read a bit about it.
23	And my understanding from what I read was that
24	Harvard felt that tobacco products were dangerous
25	and harmful; that the tobacco industry had
2	promoted them aggressively to under-aged kids and
3	had encouraged smokers to continue to smoke; and
4	that they didn't feel that it was appropriate for
5	a university, which is committed in some of its
6	broadest values to ideas of human health and
7	longevity, to benefit financially, as Harvard does
8	from its stock holdings, by holding tobacco stock.
9	So, I think that Bok came to the
10	conclusion that, you know, that the corporation
11	should divest. And there must have been a vote in
12	the corporation. I don’t know enough about the
13	intricacies of the bureaucracy of the corporation,
14	and they decided to do it.
15	Q. And do you know what year tobacco stock was
16	divested at Harvard?
17	A. My guess — you know, I don't know exactly, but I
18	think it must have been around 1990. But that's
19	something easily that, you know, we could check.
20	Q. Did you voice any objection to Harvard divesting
21	its tobacco stock?
22	A. No, I didn't.
23	Q. Did you approve of Harvard divesting its tobacco
24	stock?
25	A. Well, when I read about it, I think I was
2	impressed by President Bok's arguments.
3	Q.	And you don't own any tobacco stock, do you?
4	A.	I don't think so, although I hold pension funds
5	with TIA-CREF.
6	Q.	And have you ever owned any tobacco stocks?
7	A.	No, I’ve never owned any tobacco stocks, other
8	than this idea that maybe my pension fund holds
9	stock in tobacco.
10	Q.	Then you also served on the Faculty Council from
11	1996 through 1999?
12	A.	Yes.
13	Q.	Did you consider any tobacco related matters when
14	you were serving on the Faculty Council at
15	Harvard?
16	A.	That's really a group that advises the Academic
17	Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences about
18	academic policy, curricular reforms requirements
19	for undergraduates, things like that. We didn't
20	take up tobacco issues.
21	Q.	And you list a number of memberships in historical
22	organizations in your CV.
23	A.	Yes.
24	Q.	Have you done any tobacco-related work in
25	conjunction with your membership in any of the
2	historical organizations to which you belong?
3	A.	No, I haven't. I may have at one time, you know,
4	done a seminar at the American Association for the
5	History of Medicine, where I discussed my own
6	research. I Like talking about my own research.
7	So, in some of these organizations, I may have had
8	the opportunity to talk about my own research.
9	But I haven't done any, you know, tobacco-related
10	work for the organization.
11	Q. And is the American Association for the History of
12	Medicine a prestigious historical organization?
13	A. I don't know if I would call it prestigious. I
14	would just say that’s the organization for this
15	relatively small group of professionals who work
16	in the history of medicine. You know, I don't
17	think that people in the organization feel that
18	they derive considerable prestige from that.
19	Q. Well —
20	A. Anyone can join. You'd be welcome to join.
21	Q. Well, other than the American Association.
22	MR. BRODY: There goes any prestige.
23	Q. Other than the American Association for the
24	History of Medicine, are there any other
25	professional organizations specifically organized
2	for the purpose of the study of the history of
3	medicine?
4	A.	Well, there's an interesting discussion about
5	that, because the History of Science Society also
6	does encompass aspects of the history of medicine.
7	And, so, for example, if you're a scholar and
8	you’ve done some work in the history of medicine,
9	you might decide to present your work at the
10	History of Science Society meetings, or you might
11	decide to present it at the American Association
12	of the History of Medicine. And even the larger
13	organization, like the American Historical
14	Organization, the Organization of American
15	Historians, often have panel sessions,
16	discussions, and so on, that relate to historical
17	issues relating to health, disease, medicine,
18	public health.
19	So, for somebody like myself, all of
20	these organizations are relevant to my interest.
21	And all of them — there’s not an "only"
22	organization that covers aspects of the history of
23	medicine.
24	Q. I had a couple of questions about some of the
25	opinions in your expert report.
2	A.	Sure.
3	Q.	If you turn to Page 57 of your report.
4	A.	Yes.
5	Q.	You state in your expert report that, "The Surgeon
6	General's Report had the effect of ending any
7	remaining medical and scientific uncertainty
8	concerning the harmfulness of smoking."
9	A.	Yes.
10	Q. And do you stand by the statement that the 1964
11	Surgeon General's Report had the effect of
12	ending any remaining medical and scientific
13	uncertainty concerning the harmfulness of
14	smoking"?
15	MR. BRODY: Objection.
16	A. Yes, I stand by that statement. You know, I would
17	add that, you know, what that statement is
18	intended to convey is that within the medical and
19	scientific communities, the arguments about
20	uncertainty, many of which had been promoted by
21	the tobacco industry, now from a consensual and
22	standard point of view, could not really be
23	sustained.
24	Q. So, after the 1964 Surgeon General's Report was
25	issued within the medical and scientific
2	community, there was a consensus concerning the
3	harmfulness of smoking?
4	A. Yes. I certainly believed that was true then, and
5	probably had evolved and grown considerably even
6	before the Surgeon General's Report was issued. I
7	think the Surgeon General’s Report recognizes, you
8	know, at the level of elite professional science,
9	something that had been achieved sometime before.
10	Q. And after the Surgeon General’s Report was issued
11	in 1964, the arguments of the tobacco companies
12	that smoking had not been shown to be a cause of
13	disease in your view, could those have been
14	sustained within the medical and scientific
15	community?
16	MR. BRODY: Objection.
17	A. After the report, could the tobacco arguments be
18	sustained?
19	Q. Yes.
20	A. No. I don’t think they could really be sustained
21	within the scientific and medical community after
22	the report, although it's impressive the degree to
23	which the industry went to attempt to do just
24	that.
25	Q. And I think you also mention right below there
2	that there were still questions about tobacco;
3	and, obviously, further research was done on
4	tobacco-related issues, right?
5	MR. BRODY: Objection.
6	A.	Yes.
7	Q.	Research didn’t stop on tobacco after the 1964
8	Surgeon General’s Report was issued, right?
9	A.	No. Research did not stop after the '64 report.
10	Q.	Now, if I could ask you a couple of follow-up
11	questions that I had from yesterday, we mentioned
12	Paul Kotin yesterday. Do you remember that?
13	A.	Uh-huh.
14	Q.	Was Paul Kotin a respected scientist?
15	A.	Yes, I presume he was a respected scientist.
16	Q.	Do you regard Lawrence Gostin, G-o-s-t-i-n, as an
17	expert in smoking and health?
18	A.	I regard him as an expert in some aspects of
19	smoking and health.
20	Q.	What aspects of smoking and health is Lawrence
21	Gostin an expert in?
22	A.	He is an expert in some of the constitutional and
23	legal questions associated with the regulation of
24	smoking. I probably wouldn’t consider him an
25	expert on the scientific history of smoking, for
2	example. He consults me about that.
3	Q.	And you’ve had a lot of input into Lawrence
4	Gostin's articles on tobacco?
5	MR. BRODY: Objection.
6	A.	It would depend on what article you’re talking
7	about. I don’t know, you know, I know some of his
8	work, but I don’t know all of his work.
9	Q.	Certainly you've coauthored a number of articles
10	with Lawrence Gostin?
11	A. I have coauthored several articles with Professor
12	Gostin.
13	Q. And, also, you have been acknowledged as providing
14	comments on articles written by Lawrence Gostin?
15	A. I bet that’s true.
16	Q. Isn't it true that you cited some of Clarence Cook
17	Little's scientific publications in your works on
18	tobacco?
19	MR. BRODY: Objection.
20	A. Of course, it's true.
21	Q. Do you view John Parascandola,
22	P-a-r-a-s-c-a-n-d-o-l-a, as an expert on smoking
23	and health?
24	A. He may have written an article, but I don't really
25	regard him as an expert in this area, no.
2	Q.	You've provided comments on one of Parascandola’s
3	articles on tobacco, is that correct?
4	A.	I just don't recall.
5	Q.	Well, we can get to it later, okay?
6	A.	Okay.
7	Q.	I mean, how many times have you talked with
8	Parascandola? Have you ever talked with him?
9	A.	Well, you know, there are two Parascandolas. So,
10	that’s why I'm a little bit confused.
11	Q.	Oh, John Parascandola, do you regard him as an
12	expert on smoking and health?
13	A.	That's what I said. I really don't regard him as
14	an expert in smoking and health. You know, he
15	works for the Public Health Service. He worked on
16	many issues. He may have done an article at one
17	time on smoking and health, but, you know, is he
18	deeply knowledgeable in this area, and has that
19	been a focus of his research? No, it hasn’t been.
20	Q.	Okay. Have you had any conversations about
21	tobacco with John Parascandola?
22	A.	I probably have at one time or another. He’s
23	quite familiar that this is an area that I’ve been
24	investigating, and I almost certainly have. He's
25	a colleague; and, you know, I see him at meetings;
2	and, you know, he’s read my work; and, you know,
3	had questions about it. And, so, I'm sure I have
4	talked to him.
5	Q.	Have you had any discussions with him in
6	conjunction with this case?
7	A.	No, I have not.
8	Q.	Did you know he was involved in this case at all?
9	A.	I did not know that.
10	Q.	Okay. Professor Proctor received his graduate
11	education at Harvard?
12	A.	That's correct.
13	Q.	And did Robert Proctor take any classes from you
14	when he was at Harvard?
15	A.	No, I think that Robert Proctor must have finished
16	his degree right around the time that I joined the
17	Department of the History of Science in 1982.
18	And, so, that's around the time that I first met
19	Proctor. But, you know, he did not study with me.
20	Q.	How long was the overlap when you and Proctor were
21	there at Harvard together?
22	MR. BRODY: Objection.
23	A.	I don't know. He went on to take the position at
24	Penn State. I would say a lot of the graduate
25	students who — were leaving or coming or
2	finishing dissertations. So, I do remember pretty
3	clearly that Proctor was one of the people I met
4	when I joined the faculty at Harvard. But there
5	was no extensive overlap, because I think he must
6	have taken his first major teaching position right
7	around the same time that I came to Harvard.
8	Q.	And since Proctor was at Harvard, have you had any
9	conversations with him about tobacco?
10	A.	Yes, I've had, you know, a number of conversations
11	with him.
12	Q.	And when was the last conversation you had with
13	Proctor about tobacco?
14	MR. BRODY: Objection.
15	A.	Robert called me last night to see how the
16	deposition went. And I told him I couldn't talk
17	about it till I was done. I was too tired. But
18	I’ve spoken to him about it, you know, off and on
19	over the years because of the intellectual issues
20	and questions that we shared. And he was working
21	on some German questions. He would ask me, What
22	was the story in the United States? And I was
23	working in the US. I would say, you know, Tell me
24	about the early research in Germany. And, you
25	know, we shared references; and, you know, things
2	like that. So, given the commonality of our
3	interests, we've had quite a lot of discussions
4	over the years.
5	Q.	And before Proctor called you last night, when was
6	the last time you talked to him about tobacco?
7	A.	I talked to him briefly after his deposition.
8	Q.	Okay. And what did he tell you after his
9	deposition?
10	MR. BRODY: Objection.
11	A.	He told me he thought it had gone fine; that I
12	would do fine.
13	Q.	And did you say anything to him?
14	A.	I said that sounds, you know, that sounds about
15	right. You know, and he said, you know, he had
16	found it, you know, quite an interesting
17	experience. And that, you know, he thought I
18	would, too.
19	Q.	We mentioned the Larson treatise on tobacco
20	yesterday, do you remember that?
21	A.	Yes.
22	Q.	And the Larson treatise on tobacco was funded by
23	the tobacco industry and published in 1961, is
24	that true?
25	A.	I believe it is, but we could check.
2	Q.	Have you reviewed any of the later editions of the
3	Larson treatise on tobacco?
4	A.	I don't recall offhand. At one time I know I
5	consulted it. But I don't know if I followed up
6	by looking at later editions.
7	Q.	And do you know when subsequent editions of the
8	Larson treatise were published?
9	A.	Not offhand, I don't.
10	Q.	Isn't it true that 1964 was the peak year in per
11	capita cigarette consumption?
12	A.	Probably '64, '65. You know. I’d want to look at
13	the graph exactly. You know, from some of the
14	qualitative sources I've looked at, there was this
15	idea that there was a, you know, impressive
16	decline on the few days after the first Surgeon
17	General's Report. But then, sure enough, smoking
18	kind of climbed back up. And, so, I'm not sure
19	that '64 is exactly the high point. But we could
20	check.
21	Q.	Haven’t you drawn graphs in some of your
22	publications?
23	A.	Yeah, they are — if I had them in front of me,
24	we could look at them and get that data. I would
25	say, you know, part of my methodological
2	orientation is that certain kinds of fact, you
3	know, some I carry around in my head; some I
4	prefer to, you know, consult the record. And I
5	think that historians have to be extremely
6	scrupulous about the facts. And, so, I don’t want
7	to offer loose facts, especially when things are
8	so easy to check.
9	Q. Are you aware of any group of smokers that's been
10	defined scientifically as being incapable of
11	quitting?
12	A. I'm not aware of that.
13	Q. Other than Doctor Proctor, are you aware of any
14	other historians who have testified on behalf of
15	the plaintiffs suing tobacco companies?
16	A. No, I’m not aware of anyone other than Professor
17	Proctor.
18	Q. Now, I forgot to ask you one thing about your CV,
19	and I know that you're going to provide an updated
20	copy.
21	A. I will.
22	Q. But is there anything that you can think of off
23	the top of your head that’s not listed in the CV
24	that’s attached to your expert report that you
25	would add?
2	A. There may be an article that, you know, that has
3	come out since this CV was prepared. There — as
4	I said, my own orientation to CVs has not been to
5	include things that are sort of, you know, outside
6	my scholarly professional work. So, there may be
7	newspaper articles, for example, that are not
8	here.
9	I'm not aware of anything that's not
10	here. There may be some committees at Harvard.
11	I’m on so many committees that it may not be
12	absolutely up to date in terms of the committees.
13	And it’s also an issue — like CVs are generally
14	for, you know, for external view, and in a way —
15	so, I don't sometimes list very local activities
16	at Harvard on my CV that would only have meaning
17	to my immediate colleagues in terms of my role
18	there. So — but I don’t think that there’s
19	anything, you know, of significance in my record
20	that doesn't appear here, but —
21	Q. Can you think -- are there any recent activities
22	or publications relating to tobacco that don’t
23	appear on your CV?
24	A. Yes. Well, as I think I mentioned, I did have a
25	piece on tobacco in a recent issue of the Journal
2	of the American Medical Association. And as I'm
3	looking here, certainly that would be on my
4	updated CV.
5	Q. And what did that piece address?
6	A. That piece addressed this question that came up
7	yesterday about the constitutionality of ad bans
8	or ad restrictions for tobacco. And, again, we
9	could check, but it appeared in June in the
10	Journal of the American Medical Association.
11	Q. And did you coauthor that article with Lawrence
12	Gostin?
13	A. He’s among the coauthors, yes.
14	Q. Yesterday we were talking about or it came up--
15	the Tobacco Working Group; do you remember that?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. Have you reviewed any internal US government
18	documents relating to the Tobacco Working Group?
19	MR. BRODY: Objection.
20	A. I don't think so.
21	Q. You haven't reviewed any meeting minutes of the
22	Tobacco Working Group?
23	A. There may have been meeting minutes of the Tobacco
24	Working Group in some of the materials that I saw
25	in company documents. So, it’s conceivable that
2	among the many thousands of documents I review
3	that, you know, that those could be there because
4	of the company’s involvement in the TWG.
5	Q. But you can't recall any meeting minutes from the
6	Tobacco Working Group as you —
7	A. Not a specific document, no.
8	Q. And you didn't cite any internal documents
9	relating to the Tobacco Working Group in your
10	expert report?
11	MR. BRODY: Objection.
12	A. No, I didn't.
13	Q. In fact, you didn't mention the Tobacco Working
14	Group in your expert report, did you?
15	MR. BRODY: Objection.
16	A. I don't think so.
17	Q. Have you reviewed any of the reports generated by
18	the Tobacco Working Group?
19	A. Well, I said I may have seen a report in — that
20	arises in tobacco company files. But I haven’t
21	systematically reviewed files of the Tobacco
22	Working Group, no.
23	Q. And have you reviewed any reports of the Tobacco
24	Working Group in preparation for your testimony?
25	A. I don't think so.
2	Q. And can you recall any reports of the Tobacco
3	Working Group you've reviewed as you sit here
4	today?
5	A. As I say, I did see one or two documents that
6	appear to be company evaluations of participation
7	in the Tobacco Working Group. I'm broadly
8	familiar with its role in terms of, you know,
9	Gori's significance, the possibility of
10	collaboration with the industry and people at the
11	NIH in terms of looking at tobacco, but I haven't
12	systematically studied, at this time, the Tobacco
13	Working Group.
14	Q. Have you reviewed any of the publications that
15	came out of the Tobacco Working Group?
16	A. I don't think so.
17	Q. When was the Tobacco Working Group formed?
18	A. I don't know exactly. You know, it seems to me it
19	kind of -- you know, mid to late '60s, and comes
20	to an end before 1980.
21	Q. And do you know when the Tobacco Working Group
22	came to an end?
23	MR. BRODY: Objection.
24	A. I understand that it ended during the Califano
25	administration of HHS.
2	Q. And what's that understanding based on?
3	A. My general reading in the field. I imagine
4	something like that is in — it's in Kluger and
5	other, you know, general accounts. And at one
6	time I also did have conversation with Julius
7	Richmond, who was Surgeon General during that
8	period. So, some of what I know about the Tobacco
9	Working Group comes from Richmond's assessment
10	and, you know, and what he told me about it.
11	Q. And when did you have a conversation with Julius
12	Richmond about the Tobacco Working Group?
13	A. Probably several years ago.
14	Q. You mentioned that the Tobacco Working Group was a
15	cooperative effort between the US government and
16	the tobacco companies.
17	MR. BRODY: Objection.
18	A. I don't know enough about it to really
19	characterize it, but I know that Gori represented
20	the government. There were probably other NIH
21	researchers from the NCI that participated, and
22	then members of the research departments of the
23	companies, I think, participated. So, I just
24	don’t know enough about their work to really
25	attend to it, you know, to describe it, you know,
2	in any detail.
3	Q. And other than Gori, do you know any of the other
4	government researchers that were involved in the
5	Tobacco Working Group?
6	MR. BRODY: Objection.
7	A. I don't.
8	Q. Do you know if there were any outside scientists
9	involved — that didn't work for the tobacco
10	companies — that were involved in the Tobacco
11	Working Group?
12	A. I don't know.
13	Q. Do you know any of the tobacco company scientists
14	that were involved in the Tobacco Working Group?
15	A. I don't remember offhand, you know, who attended
16	their meetings and participated with them, you
17	know.
18	Q. Isn't it true that the Tobacco Working Group
19	produced over 490 peer reviewed scientific
20	publications?
21	MR. BRODY: Objection.
22	A. I don't know.
23	Q. Have you conducted any search of the scientific
24	literature to identify publications that came out
25	of the Tobacco Working Group?
2	A.	I haven't done that.
3	Q.	Have you reviewed any internal US government
4	documents relating to the decision to shut down
5	the TWG?
6	MR. BRODY: Objection.
7	A.	No, I haven't reviewed the documents.
8	Q.	Have you reviewed any internal US government
9	documents relating to what happened to Doctor Gori
10	after the Tobacco Working Group was shut down
11	in-
12	MR. BRODY: Objection.
13	A. I don't know what happened to him.
14	Q. Have you reviewed Doctor Gori’s recent book that
15	discusses the Tobacco Working Group?
16	A. I haven't read that. I recently ordered it, but I
17	haven't had a chance to read it.
18	Q. And who told you about the Gori book?
19	A. I noticed it on Amazon.
20	Q. Did you do a search of Amazon for publications
21	relating to tobacco, or how did that come about?
22	A. I have done that. I want to kind of keep abreast
23	of, you know, what people are doing, you know, in
24	tobacco. I think that, also, now, Amazon must
25	have, I guess, what's called a cookie or something
2	on me, so books on tobacco come up when I open my
3	Amazon account. And I think perhaps the Gori book
4	came up. But I found it on Amazon and ordered it.
5	Q. Have you reviewed any testimony by people that
6	participated in the Tobacco Working Group?
7	A. You know, only the conversation I had with, you
8	know, Doctor Richmond.
9	Q. You haven't reviewed any of Doctor Richmond's
10	tobacco litigation testimony on the Tobacco
11	Working Group?
12	MR. BRODY: Objection.
13	A. I have not.
14	Q. Have you reviewed any of the tobacco litigation
15	testimony of anyone who was involved with the
16	Tobacco Working Group?
17	A. I have not.
18	Q. Have you reviewed any of the testimony by anyone
19	in tobacco litigation about the Tobacco Working
20	Group?
21	A. No, I haven't.
22	Q. What did Julius Richmond tell you about the
23	Tobacco Working Group?
24	A. He told me that, you know, that he had come to the
25	conclusion, I think, that Gori was relatively
2	unreliable; that the Tobacco Working Group had not
3	been productive, and that the decision was made to
4	close it down.
5	Q. Have you ever tried to contact Mr. Gori to get his
6	opinions about the Tobacco Working Group?
7	A. No, I haven't done that.
8	Q. Have you ever tried to contact Mr. Gori to find
9	out why he thinks the Tobacco Working Group was
10	shut down?
11	MR. BRODY: Objection.
12	A. Well, I was going to read his book first. I
13	intend to read his book. It's not that I don't
14	think your question is an interesting and
15	important one historically. It would — you know,
16	I just haven't done that research.
17	Q. Surgeon General Richmond didn't show you any
18	portions of his testimony in tobacco litigation
19	relating to the Tobacco Working Group?
20	MR. BRODY: Objection.
21	A. No, he didn't.
22	Q. Now, beginning in the 1980s, isn’t it true that
23	the tobacco industry was required to report to the
24	federal government all the additives contained in
25	cigarettes?
2	MR. BRODY: Objection.
3	A.	Yes, I think that's true.
4	Q.	And since that time the tobacco industry has
5	reported to the federal government concerning the
6	additives in cigarettes?
7	MR. BRODY: Objection.
8	A.	I don't know whether they have fulfilled those
9	responsibilities or not, so I'm not in a position
10	to know whether they have complied with the legal
11	requirements.
12	Q.	And have you reviewed any of those lists of
13	additives submitted by the tobacco companies to
14	the federal government?
15	MR. BRODY: Objection.
16	A.	I may have at one time seen a list of additives,
17	but I have not, you know, I have not researched
18	the additives and, you know, attended to that in
19	my own work.
20	Q.	And are you aware of any cigarette additive that
21	the federal government has ordered the tobacco
22	industry to remove from cigarettes?
23	A.	I'm just not aware.
24	Q.	Isn't it true that the Surgeon General hasn't
25	proposed that any additive currently in cigarettes
2	be removed?
3	MR. BRODY: Objection.
4	A.	I don't know.
5	Q.	Isn't it true that the Surgeon General has
6	discussed additives in some of the Surgeon
7	General's Reports?
8	MR. BRODY: Objection.
9	A.	Yes, I think additives have been discussed. You
10	know, what I know about this is that the issue of
11	additives has been a, you know, a long-standing
12	discussion between, you know, pub he health
13	officials and the tobacco industry; and I know
14	that there was a bill passed, for example, in
15	Massachusetts requiring the companies to identify
16	additives. I know that during, you know, Julius
17	Richmond's tenure as Surgeon General, he was eager
18	to have the companies provide lists of additives.
19	And there were discussions within the companies
20	about how to do that, what was known about the
21	additives; had they been studied in terms of their
22	possible harmfulness?
23	You know, so, I have some general
24	knowledge about the problem of additives in the
25	history of tobacco and health. But I haven’t
2	reviewed lists, and I haven’t studied the
3	compliance to federal regulations about additives.
4	Q.	And have you reviewed any internal US government
5	documents about tobacco additives?
6	A.	I have not.
7	Q.	Isn’t it true that since the 1960s public health
8	organizations have recommended that the tobacco
9	industry try to reduce the tar and nicotine
10	deliveries of cigarettes?
11	MR. BRODY: Objection.
12	A.	I'm sorry. Could you ask that again?
13	Q.	Isn't it true that since the 1960s public health
14	authorities have advocated that the tobacco
15	companies try to reduce the levels of tar and
16	nicotine delivered by cigarettes?
17	MR. BRODY: Objection.
18	A.	I think that some did, you know. And that, you
19	know, that's been one area of interest in
20	attempting to, you know, reduce the diseases
21	associated with tobacco.
22	Q.	And hasn’t the US Public Health Service advocated
23	reduction in tar and nicotine deliveries as
24	producing less hazardous cigarettes?
25	MR. BRODY: Objection.
2	A.	I would doubt that it was, you know, that the term
3	"less hazardous cigarettes" is, you know, used
4	very often, because of the relative uncertainty
5	among public health officials and scientists about
6	whether low tar cigarettes are necessarily less
7	hazardous. But there may well have been
8	recommendations that it would be prudent in the
9	face of that uncertainty to try to reduce tars.
10	Q.	And, well, hasn't the Public Health Service
11	advocated reductions in tar and nicotine
12	deliveries?
13	MR. BRODY: Objection.
14	A.	Perhaps. I just, you know, if you show me that
15	they have in certain publications I would — then
16	I would know.
17	Q.	Well, hasn't the National Cancer Institute
18	advocated reduction in tar and nicotine
19	deliveries?
20	MR. BRODY: Objection.
21	A.	Probably.
22	Q.	And hasn’t the Surgeon General advocated
23	reductions in tar and nicotine deliveries?
24	MR. BRODY: Objection.
25	A.	Again, my sense of this is that, you know, that
2	the way the advice is given is in a context. It
3	would be best to quit and reduce your cigarette
4	consumption. If you cannot quit at this time, you
5	should consider quitting in the future. But if
6	you cannot quit at this time, reducing your
7	cigarette consumption and the possibility of less
8	tar could potentially reduce your risk, but it’s
9	not known. And, in fact, there's considerable
10	evidence that people who switch to low tar didn't
11	necessarily receive additional protection.
12	MR. SMITH: Objection.
13	Q. Isn't it true that the 1981 Surgeon General's
14	report tells smokers that if they can't quit
15	smoking, they should smoke lower tar and nicotine
16	cigarettes?
17	MR. BRODY: Objection.
18	A. Well, I think that's what I just tried to explain
19	is that it’s one thing to say, you know, people
20	should smoke less tar cigarettes, but that type of
21	recommendation, as I understand it in the Surgeon
22	General's Report, is in the context of, Here are
23	your possibilities to reduce your harms. The best
24	thing is to stop smoking. If you can't, then
25	possibly this could help you, but without the kind
2	of warranty that this is -- you know, this will
3	reduce your harm.
4	Q.	Okay. Has the American Cancer Society told
5	smokers that they should smoke lower tar and
6	nicotine cigarettes?
7	MR. BRODY: Objection.
8	A.	I think the point that I’ve been trying to make is
9	that the conventional wisdom during a period in
10	which many people were trying to quit and failed
11	was that if you can’t quit, there may be some
12	benefit in lower tar. And that it was not
13	something that could be clearly known from a
14	medical and scientific point of view.
15	Q.	Isn't it true that a number of private public
16	health organizations have advocated that smokers
17	smoke low tar cigarettes?
18	MR. BRODY: Objection.
19	A.	I'd have to have more specifics, you know.
20	Q.	Well, hasn't the American Public Health
21	Association advocated that smokers smoke lower tar
22	cigarettes?
23	MR. BRODY: Objection.
24	A.	I think in the same context, you know, in the
25	answers that I’ve given to your last several
2	previous questions, that in the context of the
3	known harm reduction of quitting and the inability
4	to quit, here are the kinds of other possibilities
5	that smokers could pursue. And over the years,
6	there were a number of them. You know, Try not to
7	smoke your cigarettes down to the end of the
8	filter. You know, switch to products that may
9	deliver less tar, those kinds of things.
10	Q. Have you reviewed any of the Surgeon General's
11	statements on low tar cigarettes?
12	A. I probably have.
13	MR. SMITH: I'm going to mark as Brandt
14	Exhibit 2 a copy of Chapter 6 of the report of the
15	NCI Expert Committee, Monograph No. 7 put out by
16	the National Institute of Health and National
17	Cancer Institute, dated 1996.
18	Q. Is that what’s in front of you?
19	(Monograph No. 7 marked Exhibit 2.)
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. And you see the Chapter 6 of the NCI monograph was
22	offered by Jonathan Samet?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. And you know that Jonathan Samet is an expert for
25	the US government in this case, right?
2	A.	I think that became clear yesterday, but I may
3	have known that before then.
4	Q.	And if you turn to the "Conclusions" section on
5	Page 86.
6	A.	86.
7	Q.	Are you there?
8	A.	Yes.
9	Q.	You see that the NCI monograph states "The health
10	consequences of smoking in 'The Changing
11	Cigarette,’ a report of the Surgeon General, 1981,
12	offered conclusions on three major classes of
13	disease." And then the report goes on to ask, "Do
14	these conclusions remain tenable in light of more
15	recent evidence?" Do you see that?
16	A.	Yes.
17	Q.	With regard to cancer, the 1981 report of the
18	Surgeon General concluded that "Today’s
19	filter-tipped lower tar and nicotine cigarettes
20	produce lower rates of lung cancer than do their
21	higher tar and nicotine predecessors," correct?
22	A.	Yes, I see that.
23	Q.	Isn't it a fact that the 1981 Surgeon General's
24	Report concluded that lower-tar cigarettes
25	produced lower rates of cancer than their
2	higher-tar predecessors?
3	MR. BRODY: Objection.
4	A.	Yes, that’s what I read. But as my last several
5	answers have at least intimated, the next sentence
6	makes clear that lower tar and nicotine cigarettes
7	— people who smoke them — have much higher lung
8	cancer incidence and mortality than do nonsmokers.
9	So, in terms of understanding the context of
10	saying there may be a harm reduction associated
11	with lower tar, there was also this more than a
12	caveat that those who really wanted to end the
13	harmful consequences of smoking would have to
14	quit. That's the point I've been making.
15	Q.	Certainly you would agree that the Surgeon
16	General's always advocated that people should quit
17	smoking, right?
18	A.	Yes.
19	Q.	And the Surgeon General has also advocated that if
20	people can't quit smoking, they should smoke lower
21	tar cigarettes, right?
22	MR. BRODY: Objection.
23	A.	Yes.
24	Q.	And the Surgeon General has always said that
25	quitting reduces your risk more than smoking lower
2	tar cigarettes, right?
3	A.	Yes.
4	Q.	And the Surgeon General has also always said that
5	lower tar cigarettes are less risky than higher
6	tar cigarettes, right?
7	MR. BRODY: Objection.
8	A.	Well, it would depend on when you ask that
9	question and when the evidence was accrued about
10	it, you see. And this is where the historical
11	point, I think, comes into play again.
12	Q.	Okay. In the 1981 Surgeon General's Report and
13	the statement that’s quoted right here in front of
14	you, doesn’t the Surgeon General say that "Lower
15	tar cigarettes produce lower rates of lung cancer
16	than higher tar cigarettes"?
17	MR. BRODY: Objection.
18	A.	Yes, that is what it says.
19	Q.	And, also, if you read on, the NCI monograph says,
20	"The more recent case control evidence remains
21	consistent with the first competent of this
22	conclusion," right?
23	MR. BRODY: Objection.
24	A.	Yes, I see that.
25	Q.	The NCI monograph dated 1996 reaffirms that lower
2	tar cigarettes reduce lung cancer rates, right?
3	MR. BRODY: Objection.
4	A.	Apparently.
5	Q.	Now, did the government ever show you this NCI
6	monograph?
7	A.	I have this in my, you know, in my library.
8	Q.	Did the government ever provide you a copy with
9	this NCI monograph in connection with your
10	testimony?
11	MR. BRODY: Objection.
12	A.	No, they did not.
13	Q.	Now, isn't it true that the tobacco companies have
14	taken a number of steps in cigarette design to
15	reduce tar and nicotine levels?
16	MR. BRODY: Objection.
17	A.	Yes, I beheve that's true.
18	Q.	One step the tobacco companies have taken to
19	reduce tar and nicotine levels is to add filters
20	to cigarettes, right?
21	MR. BRODY: Objection.
22	A.	There were a variety of purposes for the selection
23	of filters, and that was probably one of them.
24	Q.	Okay. Also, the amount of tobacco in a cigarette
25	has also been reduced over time, correct?
2	MR. BRODY: Objection.
3	A.	I just haven't studied that.
4	Q.	And the tobacco companies have used expanded
5	tobacco to reduce tar and nicotine levels, right?
6	MR. BRODY: Objection.
7	A.	Again, I just don’t know.
8	Q.	And the tobacco companies have also used
9	reconstituted tobacco to reduce tar and nicotine
10	levels, right?
11	MR. BRODY: Objection.
12	A.	I just — I am not an expert on that.
13	Q.	Isn't it true that the 1979 Surgeon General's
14	Report which Doctor Richmond worked on catalogued
15	all the ways in which the tobacco companies had
16	reduced tar and nicotine levels?
17	MR. BRODY: Objection.
18	A.	I haven't recently reviewed the'79 report to look
19	at that.
20	MR. BRODY: Why don't we take a short
21	break. We've been going about an hour and ten
22	minutes.
23	MR. SMITH: Okay.
24	VIDEO OPERATOR: The time is 10:23.
25	We're off the record.
2	(Recess was taken.)
3	VIDEO OPERATOR: The time is 10:35. We
4	are recording and on the record.
5	Q.	Doctor Brandt, I'm handing you a copy of what's
6	been marked Brandt 3. It's an article dated 1985
7	entitled, "Is there a future for lower tar yield
8	cigarettes," written by participants of the Fourth
9	Scarborough Conference on Preventative Medicine.
10	Is that what's in front of you?
11	A.	Yes.
12	(Article, "Is There a Future for
13	Lower Tar Yield Cigarettes" marked
14	Exhibit 3.)
15	Q.	And you see it lists the participants at this
16	conference down at the bottom?
17	A.	Yes, I see that.
18	Q.	And one of the participants in the conference was
19	Ernst Wynder?
20	A.	Yes, I'm familiar with Wynder.
21	Q.	And Wynder was a respected scientist in smoking
22	and health?
23	A.	I have a nuanced assessment of Wynder’s role in
24	all this, but he was clearly a significant
25	researcher who had an impact on these studies.
2	Q.	And if you look at the last page of this document,
3	you see that it contains certain acknowledgments?
4	A.	Yes, I do.
5	Q.	And it indicates that the paper arose from papers
6	and discussion at the Fourth Scarborough
7	Conference?
8	A.	Yes, I see that.
9	Q.	And one of the sponsors of the conference was the
10	US Office of Smoking and Health?
11	A. No, I don’t think so. I think it says that they
12	provided certain data.
13	Q. Data.
14	A. But they didn't — it doesn’t say they sponsored
15	the conference.
16	Q. Okay. I have a couple of questions about this
17	article. First, have you ever seen this article
18	before?
19	A. You know, as you showed it to me, I just wasn’t
20	sure. I may have seen it when it came out, but I
21	have not reviewed this article recently.
22	Q. Was the 1985 Scarborough conference article one of
23	the materials you considered in forming your
24	opinions in this case?
25	A. No, I didn't utilize this in preparing my expert
2	statement or, you know, in my work for the case.
3	Q.	And if you could turn to Page 1112.
4	A. 1112.
5	Q. Yeah. And you see in the second column in the
6	last full paragraph there that the article states
7	that "Concerns that a lower tar policy will
8	encourage smoking do not seem to be well grounded,
9	and tar reduction programs may actually help
10	people to give up smoking."
11	A. Let me just get to that sentence. "Concerns that a
12	lower tar policy will encourage smoking do not
13	seem to be well grounded, and tar reduction
14	programs may actually help people to give up
15	smoking." Yes, I see that sentence.
16	Q. And then the article also states that "In both the
17	US and the UK, which have active tar reduction
18	programs, there have been notable reductions in
19	general smoking rates and cigarette consumption."
20	A. Yes, I see that.
21	Q. And would you agree that in the US and the United
22	Kingdom where there were tar reduction programs
23	there were decreases in cigarette consumption?
24	MR. BRODY: Objection.
25	A. You know, I'm just not prepared in this context to
2	review the data and make a statement. Certainly,
3	that’s the conclusion reached here. But I’m just,
4	you know, reading up above, "These statements are
5	both in the context of the importance of
6	compensatory smoking — should not be
7	over-emphasized. Even if further reductions in
8	tar yields produce proportionately less benefit,
9	any benefit would be worthwhile." So, I just
10	think, you know, that's what it says.
11	Q. Well, isn't it true that in the US and UK
12	cigarette consumption has reduced, right?
13	A. Yes, it has.
14	Q. And in the US and UK there have been public health
15	policies to advocate low tar cigarettes?
16	MR. BRODY: Objection.
17	A. I wouldn't advertise it as advocate low tar
18	cigarettes. I think the way I would characterize
19	it is that they have been one element in
20	strategies for smoking harm reduction and
21	cessation.
22	Q. Okay. This article also states that "In the
23	American Cancer Society’s survey, people who had
24	switched to lower tar cigarettes at the start of
25	the study were more likely to have become
2	ex-smokers by the end, irrespective of the number
3	of cigarettes originally smoked."
4	A.	Yes.
5	Q.	Have you reviewed the American Cancer Society's
6	survey in preparing your testimony?
7	A.	I have not.
8	Q.	Have you considered any data showing that smokers
9	of low tar cigarettes are more likely to quit
10	smoking in preparing your testimony?
11	A.	I have not studied that.
12	Q.	Okay. I think that's all my questions for that
13	piece. Isn't it true that the tobacco companies
14	have done internal biological research on animals
15	such as mouse skin painting?
16	MR. BRODY: Objection.
17	A.	Yes, it's true.
18	Q.	And isn’t it also true that the tobacco companies
19	have done inhalation toxicology studies on
20	smoking?
21	A.	I beheve they have.
22	Q.	And isn’t it true that the tobacco companies have
23	done Ames Testing as part of their biological
24	programs?
25	MR. BRODY: Objection.
2	A.	I believe that's true.
3	Q.	And the tobacco companies have also done
4	ciliastasis testing on live animal tissue?
5	MR. BRODY: Objection.
6	A.	Yes, I believe that's true.
7	Q.	Are you aware of any biological techniques that
8	have been suggested by the outside scientific
9	community for studying the harm of cigarettes that
10	the tobacco companies haven't used?
11	MR. BRODY: Objection.
12	A.	I just don’t know.
13	Q.	Are you aware of any techniques in cigarette
14	design that have been proposed for reducing tar
15	and nicotine deliveries that the tobacco industry
16	hasn't employed?
17	MR. BRODY: Objection.
18	A.	I believe there's been, you know, some people have
19	suggested the possibility of severely reducing
20	nicotine, or step-down nicotine programs that have
21	not been deployed in the production of marketed
22	cigarettes. So, I think that that would be,
23	perhaps, one answer to your question. But there
24	could well be others.
25	Q.	And haven't you advocated that nicotine should be
2	reduced and taken out from cigarettes, if
3	possible?
4	A.	I'd have to look back at the exact piece, because
5	there were a series of possible recommendations.
6	But that’s certainly a studyable question: If
7	there was the aggressive reduction of nicotine
8	below certain levels, would that be one mechanism
9	of assisting smokers who want to stop?
10	Q. Well, sitting here today, do you advocate
11	eliminating nicotine from cigarettes?
12	A. Not necessarily. I think, you know, what I would
13	want to do is see studies of, you know, do rates
14	of nicotine being reduced in cigarettes assist
15	people in cessation? And I think it's a studyable
16	question. I don’t do those kinds of studies
17	myself. I'm an historian. But it's something
18	that, certainly, one could know more about; and it
19	could be a strategy for reducing the harms
20	associated with tobacco.
21	Q. Well, are you aware of any studies that have been
22	conducted already that show that reducing nicotine
23	in cigarettes would increase quitting rates?
24	A. I think that it was one of the questions in a —
25	there was an article that I think Benowitz had in
2	the New England Journal of Medicine. But, again,
3	I read this generally when it came out in the New
4	England Journal. It's not part of my expert
5	testimony. But I think certainly during the FDA's
6	investigation of tobacco in consideration of the
7	regulation of tobacco, nicotine was one focus.
8	And the possibility of severely reducing nicotine
9	in a stepped approach was — certainly that
10	researchers were considering during the discussion
11	of addiction and tobacco during the '90s.
12	Q. Are you aware, though, of any data that’s been
13	collected that shows that reducing nicotine
14	deliveries increases quitting rates?
15	A. It’s really just outside my area of expertise. I
16	think there are addiction experts who could
17	probably, you know, address that question, you
18	know, with considerable knowledge.
19	Q. But sitting here today you haven't seen any such
20	data?
21	A. I just don’t know about it.
22	Q. Now, the FTC is an agency of the federal
23	government, right?
24	A. Yes, it is.
25	Q. And the FTC has the power to bar advertising that
2	it considers misleading?
3	MR. BRODY: Objection.
4	A.	Yes, I think that's true.
5	Q.	And specifically the statutory authority of the
6	FTC allows them to bar advertising that’s false
7	and deceptive?
8	MR. BRODY: Objection.
9	A.	Yes, I think that's part of their mandate.
10	Q.	Now, the FTC began regulating tobacco advertising
11	beginning in the 1930s, is that true?
12	MR. BRODY: Objection.
13	A.	I think the first encounters between FTC and
14	tobacco probably date to the early '30s.
15	Q.	And in the 1950s, the FTC worked to stop the
16	tobacco industry from producing ads suggesting
17	that some cigarettes might be healthier than
18	others?
19	A.	Yes, the FTC was concerned that the industry was
20	implying that some cigarettes could be smoked
21	without probable harm to people who use them.
22	Q.	And the FTC brought enforcement actions to prevent
23	the tobacco companies from making health claims in
24	their cigarette advertising in the 1950s?
25	A.	They attempted to, yes.
2	Q.	Okay. Isn't it true that the FTC chairman
3	testified before Congress that their efforts to
4	bar health claims in ads in the 1950s have been
5	successful?
6	MR. BRODY: Objection.
7	A.	That certainly is possible.
8	Q.	Have you attempted to review Congressional
9	testimony for statements by the FTC about their
10	efforts on cigarette advertising?
11	A. At one time in my research I did review some of
12	the Congressional testimony involved with FTC
13	regulation of ads, but I haven’t reviewed it
14	recently. So, you know, the sort of relative
15	success of the FTC in changing the course of
16	advertising, I just don't know.
17	Q. In 1955 isn't it true that the FTC issued
18	guidelines prohibiting claims that lower yield
19	cigarettes were healthier?
20	MR. BRODY: Objection.
21	A. I'm not clear that by '55 there were, you know,
22	specific notions of yield yet. But it's possible.
23	I’d have to see the documents.
24	Q. Is it true that — do you know whether the FTC in
25	the 1960s changed its position on tar and nicotine
2	claims in cigarette ads?
3	A.	Yes, I believe they did change their policies.
4	Q.	And isn’t it true that the FTC required the
5	disclosure of tar and nicotine levels in
6	cigarettes sold since the 1960s?
7	A.	Yes, I believe that's true.
8	Q.	And the FTC has specified the methodology to be
9	used in measuring tar and nicotine levels?
10	A.	Yes, I think they must have specified.
11	Q.	And they did that in 1967, is that true?
12	A.	I'd have to check exactly, but I think around
13	that.
14	Q.	Have you looked at any of the submissions to the
15	FTC when it was developing its methodology for
16	measuring tar and nicotine levels in the 60s?
17	MR. BRODY: Objection.
18	Q.	Isn't it true that in 1971 the FTC mandated that
19	the tobacco industry include the deliveries
20	calculated by the FTC methodology on packs of
21	cigarettes and in advertising?
22	MR. BRODY: Objection.
23	A.	Yes, I believe that’s true.
24	Q.	Isn't it true that the FTC has evaluated the
25	methodology it requires in measuring tar and
2	nicotine levels several times since then?
3	MR. BRODY: Objection.
4	A.	I just haven't followed it closely.
5	Q.	Have you examined any FTC materials evaluating the
6	FTC methodology for measuring tar and nicotine
7	levels?
8	A.	Not in preparation of this statement.
9	Q.	Isn't it true that the FTC requires the same
10	methodology today that it developed in 1967 for
11	measuring tar and nicotine levels?
12	MR. BRODY: Objection.
13	A.	I don't know.
14	Q.	Are you aware that the tobacco industry wrote the
15	FTC a letter in 1967 telling the FTC that their
16	method did not accurately measure human smoking
17	deliveries?
18	MR. BRODY: Objection.
19	A.	No, I haven't seen that letter.
20	Q.	And you didn’t consider any submissions to the
21	tobacco industry regarding FTC methodology in
22	preparing your testimony in this case?
23	MR. BRODY: Objection.
24	A.	I did not.
25	Q.	Did you testify yesterday that you’re not going to
2	be offering any opinions on smoker compensation?
3	A.	I don't remember exactly what I said yesterday
4	about that. I said I'm certainly not an expert on
5	the, you know, on the area of compensation. But I
6	have reviewed some documents that would suggest
7	that the industry understood that in many cases
8	when smokers use lower yield cigarettes, they
9	compensate by smoking more. So, it is part of
10	some of the issues that I have reviewed.
11	Q.	Are you planning to testify about smoker
12	compensation?
13	MR. BRODY: Objection.
14	A.	Well, I, you know, it could possibly come up in
15	some aspect of my historical assessment of the
16	industry's response to rising concerns in science
17	about tobacco use, so —
18	Q.	Have you reviewed any of the Surgeon General's
19	reports to see what they say about smoker
20	compensation?
21	A.	I just reviewed this article. It said, you know,
22	it said that compensation is associated with
23	lower-yield products. But I have seen some of the
24	Surgeon General's Reports writing about
25	compensation.
2	Q. In preparing for your testimony in this case, did
3	you review the Surgeon General’s Reports to see
4	what the Surgeon General's position was on
5	compensation?
6	MR. BRODY: Objection.
7	A. I haven't done that yet.
8	Q. Okay. Now, isn't it true that smoker compensation
9	is a phenomenon that began to be studied when
10	lower tar cigarettes were introduced?
11	A. I think that there was interest, you know, from an
12	early time about, you know, how lower tar
13	cigarettes would affect smoking behavior and
14	marketing.
15	Q. And a number of studies on smoker compensation
16	have been published?
17	A. For sure.
18	Q. Have you done any research to find articles on
19	smoker compensation funded by the tobacco
20	industry?
21	A. I have not.
22	Q. Have you reviewed the Surgeon General's Reports to
23	see if they rely upon articles that were funded by
24	the tobacco industry on smoker compensation?
25	A. I haven't done that.
2	Q.	Isn’t it true that scientists have found that
3	smoker compensation is incomplete?
4	MR. BRODY: Objection.
5	A.	I don't know what that means, "incomplete".
6	Q.	Isn’t it true that scientists have found that
7	smokers only partially compensate for reductions
8	in tar and nicotine deliveries?
9	MR. BRODY: Objection.
10	A.	I don't know.
11	Q.	Hasn’t the Surgeon General stated that smokers
12	only partially compensate for reductions in tar
13	and nicotine deliveries?
14	MR. BRODY: Objection.
15	A.	As I say, I haven't — I haven't, you know,
16	studied that issue, although it's quite an
17	interesting and important one, clearly.
18	Q.	And hasn’t the Surgeon General stated that smoker
19	compensation is a short-term phenomenon?
20	MR. BRODY: Objection.
21	A.	I don't know.
22	Q.	Have you reviewed any articles on smoker
23	compensation that were published by tobacco
24	company scientists?
25	MR. BRODY: Objection.
2	A.	I have not.
3	Q.	Do you know what British American Tobacco Company
4	scientists said in the published literature about
5	addiction to cigarettes?
6	MR. BRODY: Objection.
7	A.	I don't know what they said in the published
8	literature.
9	Q.	Do you know what British American Tobacco Company
10	scientists said in the published literalure about
11	smoker compensation?
12	MR. BRODY: Objection.
13	A.	I don't.
14	Q.	Have you reviewed any scientific articles about
15	addiction to cigarettes that were published by
16	tobacco company scientists?
17	MR. BRODY: Objection.
18	A.	Possibly, but I don’t know.
19	Q.	Are you planning to offer any opinions on changing
20	tar and nicotine ratios in cigarettes?
21	A.	I could possibly, because I think that, you know,
22	the general historical issue of filtration, its
23	relative impact on rates of disease, its impact on
24	smoking behavior during the periods that I've most
25	studied — I haven't studied the most recent
2	period about some of these issues — is relevant
3	to my broader historical assessment of the
4	response of the industry to definitive scientific
5	information about some of these questions. So,
6	low tar/low yield cigarettes, you know, are a part
7	of that broader investigation.
8	Q.	Well, what about specifically changing the
9	tar-to-nicotine ratio of cigarettes —
10	MR. BRODY: Objection.
11	Q.	— do you have any opinions that you’re going to
12	offer on that?
13	MR. BRODY: Objection.
14	A.	Well, for example, I haven't really -- you know, I
15	haven’t completed my own research into some of
16	these questions, but there are issues associated
17	with low tar/low nicotine, low tar/high nicotine,
18	setting the nicotine levels in cigarettes to a
19	degree that maintain levels of dependence and
20	addiction. So, some of those issues are
21	potentially relevant to my statement, and, I would
22	assume, to my testimony, but —
23	Q.	Isn't it true that the Surgeon Generals
24	recommended conducting research on altering
25	tar-to-nicotine ratios to develop less hazardous
2	cigarettes?
3	MR. BRODY: Objection.
4	A.	I would imagine that the Surgeon General's been
5	interested in the possibility of cigarettes that
6	would both, you know, aid in reduction of harms,
7	as well as, you know, aid in cessation.
8	Q.	Have you reviewed the Surgeon General’s Reports to
9	find statements or recommendations by the Surgeon
10	General on altering tar-to-nicotine ratios?
11	A. I haven't done that in a systematic way.
12	Q. Have you reviewed any of Michael Russell’s
13	publications on altering tar-to-nicotine ratios in
14	cigarettes?
15	A. I don't think I know his work.
16	Q. Have you reviewed any tobacco company documents in
17	preparation for your testimony on tar-to-nicotine
18	ratios in cigarettes?
19	A. I believe I have seen a few documents that related
20	to, you know, issues of filtration, reductions in
21	tars. It’s not a focus of my statement. But I
22	have seen documents that — in which the industry
23	was, you know, concerned about the ratio.
24	Q. Okay. And in your view, is it reasonable for the
25	tobacco companies to conduct research on
2	tar-to-nicotine ratios?
3	MR. BRODY: Objection.
4	A.	Sure. I think it's quite — I think it's quite
5	reasonable. Obviously, one of the concerns that
6	was raised, for example, during the Food & Drug
7	Administration's investigation of tar and nicotine
8	was, were levels of nicotine enhanced as tars fell
9	in order to maintain the addictive properties of
10	the cigarette. So, it's obviously a very
11	important question, how tars and nicotine relate.
12	Q.	And hasn’t the Surgeon General advocated
13	increasing nicotine levels while reducing tar
14	levels to produce a less hazardous cigarette?
15	MR. BRODY: Objection.
16	A.	I just don’t know.
17	Q.	Haven't the public health scientists such as
18	Russell advocated increasing nicotine levels while
19	reducing tar levels to make a less hazardous
20	cigarette?
21	MR. BRODY: Objection.
22	A.	I said I'm not familiar with his work.
23	Q.	Have you conducted any review of patents obtained
24	by the tobacco companies?
25	A.	The only time that I think the patent issue came
2	up in my recent review was around the palladium
3	cigarette. Apparently, Gori had gone to visit the
4	patent office. There was some story about that —
5	had an interest in this, so.
6	Q.	You haven’t done a search to find all the patents
7	the tobacco companies —
8	A.	No.
9	Q.	— have gotten on cigarettes?
10	A.	I haven't searched the patents.
11	Q.	Do you have any idea how many patents there are
12	that the tobacco companies have gotten?
13	A.	I don't — I don't know that.
14	Q.	Are you familiar with the Eclipse product?
15	A.	I'm familiar with it. I've never smoked it, but
16	I’m aware that there is the Eclipse product. I
17	actually have a pack.
18	Q.	Do you know anything about the design of the
19	Eclipse product?
20	A.	Well, I don’t know exactly what the relationship
21	of the Eclipse design was to the premier design.
22	I assume there was some relationship in the sort
23	of progression of design. But, you know, my
24	understanding is, you know, it's a highly
25	engineered and technical product.
2	Q. In your view, was the Eclipse product an attempt
3	to develop a less hazardous cigarette?
4	A. It would be hard to say, because on the one hand,
5	it potentially could have been. But on the other
6	hand, the industry, you know, to my knowledge,
7	didn't say, That’s why we're doing this. And, in
8	fact, the original science of some of those
9	investigations — and this I did look at more
10	closely when I told you I read that very big
11	scientific report that RJR issued about the
12	research that had gone into the premier
13	technology. And, you know, the industry was
14	careful to say as it was trying to promote
15	Premier, you know, it’s not a safer cigarette,
16	because we don’t know anything that makes
17	cigarettes unsafe. So, I haven't looked closely
18	at the promotional materials associated with
19	Eclipse.
20	Does the industry say it’s a safer
21	cigarette?
22	Q. I'm asking you the question.
23	A. Okay.
24	Q. I just want to know whether in your view you think
25	the Eclipse product is a less hazardous cigarette?
2	A. I would have no way of evaluating that. You know,
3	I think that comes back to questions of how we
4	scientifically evaluate a claim like something
5	being safer. And that question of how we evaluate
6	a claim like this is safer, you know, is a crucial
7	historical aspect of my real, serious scholarly
8	interest. You know, going all the way back in the
9	history of this episode with continuity. You
10	know, were Kents safer because they had a
11	micronite filter? And on what basis could, you
12	know, a claim be made about that? And just like
13	that, I'm quite interested in the assessment, Is
14	Eclipse a safer cigarette? I don’t have the
15	technical capacity to answer what is obviously,
16	you know, a serious and important question. I'm
17	an historian.
18	Q. Do you think the government should undertake
19	efforts to determine whether products such as
20	Eclipse and Premier are safer cigarettes?
21	A. That raises a very interesting question about
22	whose responsibility products are. And, you know,
23	the government has, you know, some regulatory
24	capacities, which sometimes have been very
25	constrained, especially around issues of tobacco,
2	but other consumer products. And generally, you
3	know, a lot of that work is done in house is my
4	understanding. And the government, you know,
5	tries to set standards based upon the provision of
6	information, very often, from industry to
7	government.
8	So, your question raises the very broad
9	question, again, that I'm quite interested in
10	about regulatory process. The FDA is very
11	dependent on information from the pharmaceutical
12	industry for setting its regulatory standards of
13	safety and efficacy. So, when you’re asking me is
14	it the government’s responsibility to do research
15	on a safer cigarette? Usually, you know, that
16	kind of data would be clearly provided to the
17	government by the manufacturer of some, you know,
18	consumer item.
19	Q. Didn’t the Institute of Medicine look at this
20	whole issue of product modification?
21	MR. BRODY: Objection.
22	A. I think I said I wasn’t really — I haven’t really
23	reviewed the Institute of Medicine recent report,
24	so —
25	Q. Isn't it true that tobacco industry scientists
2	participated in providing information for the
3	Institute of Medicine report that recently came
4	out?
5	MR. BRODY: Objection.
6	A.	They may have. I wasn’t involved in that report.
7	Q.	Okay. Have you undertaken any efforts to find out
8	what tobacco-related activities the Institute of
9	Medicine is conducting?
10	A.	I haven't. I was aware that they did a report —
11	which at one time I did read -- on preventing
12	tobacco use among children. And I think it goes
13	back to the, probably early '90s. You know, I
14	thought it was quite a good assessment of the
15	problems of, you know, reducing cigarette
16	consumption among minors who are exposed to
17	intense marketing.
18	Q.	Have you ever smoked?
19	A.	No, I’ve never smoked.
20	Q.	Has anybody in your family ever smoked?
21	A.	My paternal grandfather smoked. And when I was a
22	child, my mother periodically smoked, but quit,
23	you know, certainly by the time I was five or six.
24	Q.	When did you first conclude that smoking caused
25	cancer?
2	MR. BRODY: Objection.
3	A. Well, you know, I would say that that conclusion
4	had different sort of developmental aspects. So,
5	there have been times where now I think I
6	understand the science of the harms of smoking and
7	how that evolved; and, you know, I read that
8	literature. And, you know, came to a conclusion
9	that, you know, certainly, it's overwhelmingly
10	convincing. But I think as a child, I was taught
11	that smoking was harmful.
12	Q. Do you believe that smoking is addictive?
13	A. I'm convinced by the scientific literature on that
14	that it is addictive.
15	Q. When did you come the view that smoking was
16	addictive?
17	A. I don't know. I think, you know, I must have, as
18	a, you know, probably as an adolescent or, you
19	know, young adult, come to the conclusion that,
20	you know, smoking is addictive.
21	Q. You’re aware that the US government derives
22	revenue from taxes on tobacco, right?
23	A. Yes, I'm aware of that.
24	Q. And do you know how long the US government has
25	derived revenue from taxes on the sale of
2	cigarettes?
3	A.	I think it goes back, you know, to, you know, to
4	the 19th Century.
5	Q.	Would it be fair to say that the US government has
6	received billions — if not trillions — of
7	dollars from tobacco tax revenues?
8	MR. BRODY: Objection.
9	A.	The government derives, you know, taxes from all
10	legally-sold products that, you know, consumers
11	buy.
12	Q.	Isn't there a special excise tax on cigarettes?
13	A.	There have been special taxes on cigarettes, yes.
14	Q.	And hasn’t the government received billions of
15	dollars in tax revenue from the sale of
16	cigarettes?
17	MR. BRODY: Objection.
18	A.	I don't know exactly how much, but I'm sure that
19	they derive revenues from excise taxes.
20	Q.	Isn't it true that the majority of the cost of a
21	pack of cigarettes consists of taxes?
22	MR. BRODY: Objection.
23	A.	I haven't broken down the costs of a cigarette
24	pack. But, you know, I think a substantial amount
25	is probably for taxes today.
2	Q.	Isn’t it true that the government’s tax revenue on
3	cigarettes is significantly higher than the
4	tobacco company's profit margins on cigarettes?
5	MR. BRODY: Objection.
6	A.	I don't know what the profit margins on cigarettes
7	are. But, you know, as I say, you know, I'm just
8	not an expert on tax policy.
9	Q.	Would you be surprised to learn that the
10	government's tax revenues on a pack of cigarettes
11	are much higher than the tobacco company’s profits
12	on a pack of cigarettes?
13	MR. BRODY: Objection.
14	A.	I don't think I’d be surprised to learn that.
15	Q.	Now, you know that the US government gives out
16	tobacco subsidies, right?
17	MR. BRODY: Objection.
18	A.	Yeah. I'm aware of the history of the subsidy
19	program.
20	Q.	How long has the US government been giving out
21	tobacco subsidies?
22	A.	I believe the subsidy program began in, you know,
23	the early part of the New Deal.
24	Q.	And do you know how much money the tobacco — I
25	mean — the government has given out in tobacco
2	subsidies?
3	A.	I haven't studied that.
4	Q.	Isn’t it true that a number of public health
5	authorities have been critical of the US
6	government for giving out tobacco subsidies?
7	MR. BRODY: Objection.
8	A.	I was aware that there has been, you know, debate
9	about the subsidy program, yes.
10	Q. And you've criticize the US government for giving
11	out tobacco subsidies, true?
12	A. That's true.
13	Q. And you've characterized the federal government’s
14	tobacco subsidy program as hypocritical because it
15	promotes consumption of tobacco?
16	A. I'd want to see the text, because, you know, I’d
17	want to see the full text in which I describe
18	that, but, you know —
19	Q. Well, isn't it true that the federal government’s
20	tobacco subsidy program increases the consumption
21	of tobacco?
22	MR. BRODY: Objection.
23	A. I'm not sure. I would have to study it.
24	Q. Do you believe that the US government should stop
25	giving out tobacco subsidies?
2	A.	I think that would be a policy, you know, that
3	really ought to be carefully evaluated, I think
4	It's complicated, because, obviously, you know,
5	there are economic interests dependent on tobacco.
6	I think with the things that I’ve been advocating
7	probably was, you know, greater exploration of
8	alternative crops; you know, mechanisms for
9	assisting tobacco farmers for successfully growing
10	other things. But I’d want to return to anything
11	I had written on that, and I think it's a -- you
12	know, I think it’s an important question.
13	Q.	Since you started working on this case, have you
14	told the US government that they should stop
15	subsidizing tobacco?
16	A.	I haven't told the US government about tobacco
17	subsidies since I started working on the case.
18	Q.	Have you reviewed any of the laws concerning
19	tobacco subsidies?
20	A.	At one time I might have looked at the legislation
21	early on in the New Deal, but I haven’t looked at
22	that material in a very long time
23	Q.	Isn't it true that the US government has
24	undertaken efforts to promote the sale of
25	cigarettes?
2	A.	I believe that is true.
3	Q.	Isn’t it true that the US government has given
4	away billions of dollars of free cigarettes to
5	soldiers in the US armed forces?
6	MR. BRODY: Objection.
7	A.	Again, that would be the kind of thing from where
8	— from an historical point of view — you'd want
9	a very, you know, specific timeline. There were
10	times when, certainly, tobacco was supplied to
11	troops in World War I, probably, again, in World
12	War II, sold to military; and, then, later the
13	Department of Defense changed its policy about
14	tobacco.
15	Q.	You participated in a video on the history of
16	tobacco for the American Lung Association, right?
17	A.	I think the American Lung Association did fund an
18	independent filmmaker. And yes, I did participate
19	in the film.
20	Q.	And wasn't one of the conclusions in the film on
21	the history of tobacco in which you participated
22	that the US government had given out billions of
23	dollars in free cigarettes to US soldiers?
24	MR. BRODY: Objection.
25	A.	I didn't say that on the film. And I guess I
2	would just want to say I haven't reviewed the film
3	since it was made, but I wasn't responsible for
4	the entire content of the film. You know, the way
5	films like that are made, as you probably know, if
6	somebody says, I'd like to come, you know, do an
7	interview with you about things you know, usually
8	I try to talk about the things I know best. And
9	then the filmmaker may use any manner of clip or
10	segment from what is often a very long interview,
11	and then put it in the film. And, generally, when
12	scholars or academics or anyone participate in
13	those films, they don’t have oversight over the
14	entire thesis, argument, content of the film,
15	but —
16	Q. But you would agree that the federal government
17	has given away free cigarettes to soldiers in the
18	US armed forces, true?
19	A. At certain times, yes, true.
20	Q. And, in fact, didn't they give away a large number
21	of cigarettes to soldiers in the US armed forces
22	during World War I?
23	MR. BRODY: Objection.
24	A. Actually, the story’s a little bit more
25	complicated than that. The government gave some,
2	but, really, it was voluntary groups, I think
3	that, you know, very much participated in the idea
4	of purchasing and sending cigarettes to the
5	troops. So, for example, the YMCA, you know,
6	helped collect cigarettes. And there were
7	cigarette drives among citizens to assist the
8	troops in this way. And I think that — I'm not
9	sure that it was — you know, we'd have to look at
10	the data for, you know, how much tobacco the
11	federal government purchased, versus these other
12	mechanisms of getting cigarettes to troops.
13	Q. Have you looked at any of the data concerning how
14	much the government has spent in giving away free
15	cigarettes to soldiers in the US armed services?
16	A. No, I — that’s my answer. I have not looked at
17	that in a systematic way.
18	Q. And the government hasn't asked you to look at
19	that?
20	A. No, the government did not ask me to look at that.
21	Q. Isn't it true that after World War I there was a
22	large increase in cigarette consumption?
23	A. Yes, there was a very large increase.
24	Q. And isn’t it true that the increase in cigarette
25	consumption after World War I has been attributed
2	to the free cigarette program of the US
3	government?
4	MR. BRODY: Objection.
5	A. No, I don't think that's — you know, I think that
6	the argument really went that many soldiers,
7	especially in France, you know, started smoking,
8	and they came back as smokers. And, so, that was
9	one element of a very dramatic rise in cigarette
10	smoking. But I don’t think people say the rise in
11	cigarette smoking would be attributed back,
12	thinking about issues of causality, in the
13	government program of providing cigarettes to the
14	troops.
15	Q. Wasn’t that a statement that was in the American
16	Lung Association video that you participated in?
17	MR. BRODY: Objection.
18	A. I just would not know. You know, we can look at
19	transcripts of that video, but, as I say, the idea
20	that, well, it’s in the video, therefore, it's
21	obviously true and I’m responsible for it is a
22	chain of inference that, you know, I couldn't
23	accept. So, I certainly know about providing
24	cigarettes to the troops. I know there was fairly
25	great enthusiasm, especially among citizens, for
2	those types of programs. I know the companies, to
3	the extent that they could, were eager to
4	participate in those programs; and many men came
5	back from the war as smokers; and that was one
6	element of a process by which, you know, America
7	became a cigarette-oriented culture.
8	Q.	I'm just asking you, isn't it true that some
9	commentators have attributed the increase in
10	cigarette smoking after World War I to the US
11	government's giving away free cigarettes?
12	MR. BRODY: Objection.
13	A.	That certainly is possible.
14	Q.	All right. Isn't it true that the federal
15	government assists the tobacco industry by
16	providing a multi-billion dollar tax deduction for
17	advertising and promotional activities?
18	MR. BRODY: Objection.
19	A.	You need to read it again, I'm sorry.
20	Q.	Isn't it true that the federal government assists
21	the tobacco industry by providing a multi-billion
22	dollar tax deduction for advertising and
23	promotional activities?
24	MR. BRODY: Objection.
25	A.	I just wouldn't characterize it that way. Those
2	types of tax deductions are not specific to
3	tobacco so far as I understand it.
4	Q. Haven't you written, though, that the federal
5	government assists the tobacco industry by
6	allowing them to take the deduction for
7	advertising?
8	A. Yes. I mean, in terms of these regulatory
9	strategies, one regulatory strategy would be the
10	possibility of legislation that would end those
11	kinds of deductions for an industry marketing a
12	dangerous product.
13	Q. And you've called for an end to the government tax
14	exemption for tobacco advertising and promotion
15	activities, haven’t you?
16	A. I probably did.
17	Q. Since you started working on this case, have you
18	told the government that it should pass
19	legislation ending the exemption for tobacco
20	advertising and promotional activities?
21	A. Well, you know, just — no, I haven’t told the
22	government. But I generally don't, you know, tell
23	the government what I do. It is, you know, a
24	complicated issue in our democracy about telling
25	the government. What I do and what my role has
2	been has been to do scholarship, write articles
3	that are peer reviewed, publish them in places,
4	and contribute to a larger discussion about the
5	policy options available to reduce the harms that
6	are associated with tobacco.
7	So, the idea that, well, now that I'm an
8	expert witness for the government, my role is, as
9	a consultant to the government, to tell the
10	government what policies to enact regarding
11	tobacco is just in some ways I have to say a
12	misunderstanding of my role in this case.
13	Q. I think they want to change the videotape.
14	VIDEO OPERATOR: The time is 11:18.
15	We're off the record. This concludes Cassette No.
16	1.
17	(Recess was taken.)
18	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 11:26.
19	We're recording and on the record. This is the
20	beginning of Cassette No. 2 in the deposition of
21	Allan Brandt.
22	Q. Isn't it true that you've described the US
23	government's role in promoting tobacco as tragic?
24	A. In the — it must have been in specific instances.
25	So, again, you know, my preference, you know, as
2	somebody scrupulous about text, is to like to
3	return to text and see the context in which I said
4	something like that. But, for example, in foreign
5	trade promotion and things like that, I have had
6	concerns about, you know, federal policies
7	regarding tobacco.
8	Q. And isn’t it true that you have stated that the US
9	government's role in promoting tobacco has aided
10	or contributed to a worldwide pandemic of
11	tobacco-related disease?
12	A. Well, again, you know, assessment. There have
13	been ways in which the government has inadequately
14	regulated tobacco or, at times, assisted in its
15	promotion. But, you know, my own view is that the
16	government has been constrained in its regulatory
17	approaches for a number of important reasons; and
18	the principal promoters of tobacco have been the
19	companies.
20	So, you know, my whole view would take
21	into account government regulation, industry
22	promotion, and the science of tobacco, and I'm
23	interested in all of those areas.
24	MR. SMITH: Objection.
25	Q. I'm handing you a copy of Brandt 4, which is an
2	article entitled, "The Fall of the House of Ashes"
3	in Harvard Magazine.
4	A.	Yes, I did not write this article. You know that,
5	right?
6	Q.	Yes. You were interviewed for this article?
7	A.	I think that's correct. When did this appear?
8	("The Fall of the House of Ashes" marked
9	Exhibit 4.)
10	A.	Do you have a citation for this?
11	Q.	Other than what’s on this, I just downloaded it
12	from the internet.
13	A.	I see. Well, it would be good to know exactly
14	when this appeared. But anyway --
15	Q.	Do you remember giving an interview to the Harvard
16	magazine to Harber Fraser Hodder?
17	A.	I do remember talking to somebody from Harvard
18	magazine.
19	Q.	And when was that?
20	A.	My guess is that this probably appeared sometime
21	in the early 1990s.
22	Q.	If you turn to the second page and the last
23	paragraph.
24	A.	The second page, the last paragraph, yes.
25	Q.	You describe how, "On the one hand, the government
2	is suggesting that smoking is hazardous. On the
3	other hand, it subsidizes tobacco agriculture and
4	has actively worked to open new markets to the
5	tobacco industry." Do you see that?
6	A.	Yes, I do.
7	Q.	And then you state, "It's tragic, because the
8	United States is playing a role in what will be a
9	worldwide pandemic."
10	MR. BRODY: Objection.
11	A.	Yes. That's what it says here.
12	Q.	And do you still agree that the United States
13	government is playing a role in what will be a
14	worldwide pandemic of tobacco-related disease?
15	MR. BRODY: Objection.
16	A.	I haven't recently analyzed, for example, the
17	government's trade policies and how they've been
18	modified. If I remember, this was a time when
19	there was considerable debate or there recently
20	had been, especially during the Reagan years, in
21	which there was, you know, activity on the part of
22	the Foreign Trade Offices to try to expand markets
23	for American Tobacco products abroad. And that
24	was the context in which this statement was
25	offered.
2	I would just want to be clear that, you
3	know, again, this was an interview with a
4	journalist, who I probably spoke to for quite some
5	time. These are the quotes that they chose. And
6	while they do reflect what --1 think that
7	probably this is an accurate quote, it doesn’t
8	really contextualize my whole perspective of this
9	worldwide tobacco pandemic, which I am extremely
10	concerned about, and which I would primarily
11	attribute to the aggressive marketing of tobacco
12	products by their manufacturers. So, I don’t
13	disagree with this. It just doesn’t capture my
14	whole position.
15	MR. SMITH: Objection.
16	Q. Is your position that the US government has
17	contributed to the pandemic of tobacco-related
18	disease?
19	A. At times.
20	Q. I've got another article which you actually wrote
21	here, which I've marked as Brandt 5. It's written
22	by you. It’s an article entitled "Up in Smoke:
23	How Cigarettes Came to Be a Controlled Substance,"
24	dated 1991. Is that what's in front of you?
25	A. Yes.
2	("Up in Smoke" marked Exhibit 5.)
3	Q.	And if you'd turn to Page 23 of that article.
4	A.	Yes.
5	Q.	You see that at the bottom of the first column you
6	state, "At the same time, tobacco subsidies were
7	maintained, placing the government in the
8	ambiguous and hypocritical position of working to
9	limit cigarette smoke, while simultaneously
10	contributing to the production of tobacco."
11	A.	Yes, I see that.
12	Q.	Isn't it true that you've characterized the
13	government's giving out tobacco subsidies as
14	hypocritical?
15	MR. BRODY: Objection.
16	A.	Yes, in some context, I think that's true.
17	Q.	Would it surprise you if the US government had
18	been sued by a plaintiff in a smoking and health
19	lawsuit?
20	A.	I just don’t know whether that's the case or not,
21	you know.
22	Q.	Have you undertaken any effort to determine
23	whether the US government has ever been sued by
24	somebody alleging that they contributed to their
25	tobacco related disease?
2	A.	I have not investigated that.
3	Q.	Has the US government — strike that, okay?
4	A.	Okay.
5	Q.	Isn't it true that a number of public health
6	authorities have criticized the government's
7	promotion of tobacco products, because it’s
8	increased consumption of cigarettes?
9	MR. BRODY: Objection.
10	A.	I think a number of people have criticized the
11	government. Of course, again, you know, I would
12	put this in the context of the government’s — the
13	influence of the industry on the government. So,
14	I think you would need to take a look at — in
15	order to understand the government's role in a
16	complex historical process, I would strongly
17	advocate looking at the relationship of the
18	industry to the government, for example, in
19	limiting regulatory policies, in promoting trade
20	promotion, and so on. So, my tendency, when I
21	evaluate the government, is not to see it, you
22	know, as an insular entity in relationship to
23	tobacco policy, but part of complex social systems
24	and political and economic systems in which they
25	come to have relationships. And from an
2	historical point of view, that’s how I look at
3	questions like that.
4	Q.	But you agree that the government has, in fact,
5	taken actions that have increased tobacco
6	consumption?
7	A.	Yes, I believe that's possibly true.
8	Q.	Isn’t it true that the first recommendation that
9	ever came from the Surgeon General's office on a
10	warning regarding smoking on cigarette packs
11	didn’t come until 1964?
12	MR. BRODY: Objection.
13	A. The first warnings did not come until'64?
14	Q. I'm just asking whether the Surgeon General first
15	recommended that a warning be placed on cigarette
16	packs in 1964?
17	MR. BRODY: Objection.
18	A. There were earlier recommendations and discussion
19	about cigarette labeling prior to '64. So, you
20	know, the first time that Congress acted on a
21	variety of recommendations about labeling was in
22	'64/65.
23	Q. Do you know whether the first recommendation by
24	the Surgeon General specifically regarding a
25	warning label was in 1964?
2	A.	I don't know, because I haven’t reviewed all the
3	Surgeon General’s internal response and
4	perspectives on what the regulatory approaches
5	would be. But it was broadly considered. I mean,
6	you know, I think people from the FTC were in
7	contact with the Surgeon General about labeling
8	being one potential regulatory intervention,
9	certainly, in the late '50s.
10	Q. Isn't it true that since the Labeling Act was
11	enacted back in the '60s, the Federal Trade
12	Commission, on a regular basis, has reviewed the
13	warnings to determine if they’re still adequate?
14	MR. BRODY: Objection.
15	A. I think they review the warnings. But, you know,
16	whether they’re still adequate is kind of an open
17	question. Adequate for what?
18	Q. Well, the Federal Trade Commission has reviewed
19	the warning labels, right?
20	A. Yes, I believe they have.
21	Q. And the warning labels have been changed at
22	certain points in time since the 1960s?
23	A. Yes, the warning labeling labels have been
24	changed.
25	Q. And hasn’t the Federal Trade Commission reviewed
2	the warning labels to make sure they're adequate
3	to inform the public about health hazards?
4	MR. BRODY: Objection.
5	A. The Federal Trade Commission doesn't set the
6	package labels. They're set by Congress. And the
7	issue of adequacy is a complicated question.
8	Adequate for what? And they've reviewed the —
9	they've reviewed the packages and, you know,
10	consulted with Congress about changing
11	legislation. And, legislatively, the original
12	Cigarette Labeling Act had been amended to result
13	in changing labels. But, you know, assumptions of
14	their adequacy are harder -- is a harder part of
15	that question to actually determine with any
16	certainty.
17	Q. Hasn't the Federal Trade Commission issued a
18	series of reports on the warning labels and given
19	those to Congress?
20	MR. BRODY: Objection.
21	A. Yes, I think that they have shared information
22	with Congress about the warning labels.
23	Q. And have you reviewed any of the FTC reports to
24	Congress on warning labels?
25	A. I'm familiar with that, but I haven't reviewed
2	those recently.
3	Q.	Don't the FTC reports on warning labels to
4	Congress contain recommendations about whether in
5	the FTC's view the warning labels are adequate?
6	MR. BRODY: Objection.
7	A.	I think the perception has often been that the
8	warning labels were inadequate, and new warning
9	labels were recommended and then negotiated in
10	Congress through the complex processes of
11	developing legislation, and that’s how labels
12	result on the packages.
13	So, you know, I don’t know of anything
14	where the FTC said, Now these labels are adequate
15	to our satisfaction. But if there's evidence like
16	that, you know, I would want to review it.
17	Q.	Congress has approved all the warning labels on
18	cigarettes, though, true?
19	A.	Yes, those are a result of Congressional
20	legislation. Congress approves Congressional
21	legislation.
22	Q.	Do you think that Congress should change the
23	warning label that's currently on the package?
24	MR. BRODY: Objection.
25	A.	That, you know, I don't know on what grounds
2	you’re asking me that, in terms of my expert
3	opinion? In terms of my opinion as a citizen? Do
4	I think they should change them? Reevaluating the
5	warning label could be one element in, you know,
6	in enhancing public health messages and
7	communications.
8	Q. And, certainly, Congress has the power to change
9	the label under the and — under the alter the
10	Labeling Act, right?
11	MR. BRODY: Objection.
12	A. Congress has the authority to change the label on
13	cigarettes, and then Congress is subject to the
14	complex political and economic environments in
15	which we live in terms of influence and
16	consideration. So, I view the history of
17	Congressional intervention in relationship to
18	cigarettes, including labeling, to be part of a
19	complex political process. But by the
20	Constitution, Congress makes legislation.
21	Q. So, Congress can enact legislation under the
22	Constitution to change the warning label, right?
23	MR. BRODY: Objection.
24	A. They could. They could. That's true.
25	Q. Would it be ethical to have lawyers suing the
2	tobacco companies help write a Surgeon General's
3	Report?
4	MR. BRODY: Objection.
5	A. Would it be ethical to have lawyers suing the
6	tobacco companies help write a Surgeon General's
7	Report? Very interesting and complicated
8	question. I would need to know what role they
9	were playing, who they were, what their positions
10	were. You know, I wouldn’t make an ethical
11	assessment. In fact, this is a good example of
12	how ethicists work. If somebody says, Well,
13	that’s unethical, then they haven’t done the
14	analysis associated with making a moral
15	determination about the relative ethics of that.
16	So, you know, I always argue for this in all my
17	work in ethics. I need to know many details in
18	order to come to conclusions about ethics.
19	Q. Would it be a potential sort of bias if a lawyer
20	suing the tobacco companies was a contributing
21	author to the Surgeon General's Report?
22	MR. BRODY: Objection.
23	A. Again, I don't have enough information. You know,
24	it's a hypothetical for me. Would it be? It
25	possibly could be, possibly not. I mean, you'd
2	have to assess that.
3	Q.	And what additional information would you need?
4	A.	I'd want to know what information that particular
5	lawyer provided the Surgeon General's, you know,
6	process in what ways, and, you know, was it clear
7	what role people were playing in relative issues
8	of disclosure and transparency, and what the
9	information was. And, you know, and if I had a
10	lot more information about that, then, maybe I
11	could say, Here's how an ethicist would try to,
12	you know, articulate and unpack any moral
13	questions about conflict of interest in that
14	instance.
15	But this goes back to your question
16	about my service on the Conflict of Interest
17	Committee at Harvard. We would look at issues of
18	conflict of interest, ask if there were potential
19	biases, ask if there might be perceived biases,
20	and evaluate them, generally, on a case-by-case
21	basis in terms of how sensitive people to ethics
22	would, you know, would consider it.
23	Q. Well, would having a lawyer write part of the
24	Surgeon General's Report represent — a lawyer who
25	was suing the tobacco companies or involved in
2	litigation against the tobacco companies —
3	represent a potential source of bias?
4	MR. BRODY: Objection.
5	A. I just have to say if you show me what they were
6	writing, if you told me more about the story, then
7	maybe I could help answer that question. But I
8	can’t answer that question, you know, at the
9	theoretical level without the case.
10	Q. Would the fact that a scientist is being paid to
11	testify as a witness in tobacco litigation
12	represent a potential source of bias in scientific
13	publications on tobacco by that scientist?
14	MR. BRODY: Objection.
15	A. Again, it would be hard to say. Potentially, you
16	know, I think it’s best to identify one’s sources
17	of funding, especially for the particular work.
18	You know, but, you know, again, one would want to
19	see what did that scientist produce, you know,
20	prior to testimony? Did they have a body of
21	scholarship that makes certain kinds of arguments
22	or offers opinions? So, you know, bias is
23	complicated to discern.
24	One of the things our society has done
25	is move towards, you know, higher standards of
2	disclosure — not of biases, but of potential
3	biases — in order to permit peers to assess that.
4	And, so, that’s technically how our
5	system of sort of bias and interest discovery has
6	evolved over time.
7	Q. In your view, should scientists who publish
8	publications on tobacco disclose the fact that
9	they have been paid to testify in litigation for
10	one side or the other in tobacco cases?
11	A. I don't know if there's a standard about it. But,
12	you know, I generally favor more disclosure,
13	rather than less. But, you know, I think that
14	it's complicated with the cases. And I don’t know
15	that everybody’s disclosing, you know, their —
16	the fact that they’re offering expert testimony
17	and being paid for it. I just don't — I don't
18	know what the standard is. Are there legal
19	standards, American Bar Association standards? I
20	just don't know.
21	Q. Well, are you planning to, at least, investigate
22	whether you should disclose the fact that you have
23	received compensation for testifying in a tobacco
24	case when you publish your book?
25	A. Well, I think I will be absolutely clear that I
2	participated in this process and that, you know,
3	that I was compensated for my time. And, you
4	know, when I wrote my JAMA article, I noted that I
5	was now a consultant to the DOJ on the tobacco
6	case — on this most recent JAMA article. So, I
7	did disclose to JAMA.
8	So, you know, my own perspective on it
9	is that I wouldn't want somebody to say about my
10	work, Well, you know, he was a paid consultant for
11	the Department of Justice, and that accounts for
12	the work. So, I actually plan to be quite open
13	about my testimony. And my understanding is that
14	hasn't always been the case with experts in the
15	cases. But, you know, my testimony is so
16	fundamentally consistent with a body of
17	scholarship that, you know, I'm quite happy to
18	disclose.
19	Q. And should the US government disclose the fact
20	that individuals who are participating in writing
21	the Surgeon General’s Reports have been paid for
22	their work as experts in tobacco litigation for
23	one side or the other?
24	A. As I say, I don’t think there's been an emergent
25	standard yet on that question. And, you know, the
2	world is rife with potential sources of bias and
3	conflicts of interest, but I would just have to
4	evaluate that question. You know, I would have to
5	give it — be — you know, look at both sides of
6	it, think about, you know, what some of the issues
7	are for researchers and so on. But, generally,
8	you know, generally in favor of disclosure.
9	Q.	Are you aware of the Surgeon General ever
10	disclosing that authors of portions of the Surgeon
11	General's Report were being paid as experts to
12	testify against the tobacco companies while they
13	were writing the Surgeon General's Report?
14	A. I just don’t know.
15	Q. Now, lawyers have edited certain of your articles
16	that you've published, is that true?
17	A. Lawyers have?
18	Q. Edited certain of the articles you've published.
19	A. Edited them? I'm trying to think of what you
20	might have in mind, because —
21	Q. Well, why don’t I clarify my question.
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. First, you've coauthored a number of articles on
24	tobacco with lawyers, right?
25	A. Yes, I have coauthored several articles with a
2	lawyer, or, maybe in some cases, to lawyers.
3	Q.	And I seem to remember that your article on FDA
4	regulation of tobacco in JAMA, you had noted that
5	lawyers had edited that piece.
6	MR. BRODY: Objection.
7	A. I don't know. There may have been some lawyers
8	acknowledged who, you know, I just don’t really
9	know — I wasn't the first author of that piece
10	and didn't handle the administrative aspects of
11	its submission and so on. But, so, we each
12	acknowledged people who had assisted us. And I
13	think that ’'edited" in that context means not that
14	this was submitted for editorial review,
15	correction and redaction, but, rather, you know,
16	Thank you for helping with the editing of this,
17	which, in my academic mode, means, you know, for
18	having read, critiqued, advised in some way, so —
19	Q. Well, maybe I'll just give you this article that's
20	been marked as Brandt 6 to refresh your
21	recollection. It’s your article entitled "FDA
22	Regulation of Tobacco Advertising and Youth
23	Smoking." It's dated 1997, and appears in JAMA.
24	A. Oh, yes, I'm familiar with this article.
25	Q. And, then, if you look down at the attributions,
2	you say that the authors are grateful to R-e-n-i-e
3	Shapiro,	and Kathleen J. Lester, JD, for
4	research and editorial work on the manuscript?
5	A.	Let me just find it. That's at the end of the
6	article?
7	Q.	Yes.
8	A.	Yes.
9	("FDA Regulation of Tobacco Advertising
10	and Youth Smoking" marked Exhibit 6.)
11	Q. And my only point was — at least with this
12	article that you wrote — you had research and
13	editorial work from Ms. Lester, who was a lawyer?
14	A. Yes, we did.
15	Q. And who is Ms. Lester?
16	A. I don't know. I think she was a colleague or a
17	friend of Professor Gostin's. And, you know, my
18	guess is — as I said, we each wrote different
19	parts and got different types of help; and where
20	people helped that author, you know, made sure
21	there was an appropriate acknowledgment. And I
22	don’t know Ms. Lester. But she must have assisted
23	Professor Gostin in some way.
24	Q. Okay. In your view, is it ethical for a lawyer to
25	advise a scientist on the wording of scientific
2	documents?
3	MR. BRODY: Objection.
4	A.	It would depend. You know, it gets back to my
5	ethics thing. It could just depend. You know,
6	lawyers may know a lot about a lot. It might be
7	appropriate. It might be inappropriate. So, you
8	know, so one of the things about ethics today is
9	that ethics is very often oriented around cases.
10	The idea of making broad ethical proclamations
11	leads to problems for the field of ethics. And I
12	think ethics is now much more grounded in the
13	context of the instance in which one is
14	evaluating, you know, those kinds of
15	relationships.
16	So, you know, I think it potentially
17	could be ethical in a given instance for, you
18	know, a scientist to ask a lawyer a question.
19	But, you know, I can also imagine many instances
20	where it would be unethical. So, there you have
21	it.
22	Q. Have you undertaken any analysis to determine
23	whether — which individuals working on the
24	Surgeon General's Reports have received
25	compensation for testifying against the tobacco
2	companies?
3	A.	I have not investigated that question.
4	Q.	And have you undertaken any analysis to determine
5	which individuals working on the Surgeon General's
6	Reports are lawyers that have been involved in
7	tobacco litigation?
8	A.	I haven't looked at that question.
9	Q.	Have you undertaken any analysis to determine if
10	any of the authors of articles you’re relying on
11	for your testimony have received money for
12	testifying against the tobacco companies?
13	A.	I would imagine that some of the people whose work
14	I am familiar with have testified, you know, I
15	think I said I'm familiar with David Burns's work.
16	You know, I had a working relationship with John
17	Pinney. I think I mentioned in yesterday's
18	testimony that I had read an article by Michael
19	Cummings. So, I'm trying to think of who else has
20	testified. But, you know, I'm familiar with that,
21	you know, that I am familiar with work of people
22	who have testified.
23	Q.	And Bums, Pinney, and Cummings are all people who
24	have both assisted in drafting the Surgeon
25	General's reports, and received compensation for
2	testifying against the tobacco companies?
3	A.	I don't know whether Pinney has testified against
4	the tobacco companies, so, but —
5	Q.	Would you —
6	A.	But apparently Burns has, and I think Cummings is
7	a witness.
8	Q.	So, Bums and Cummings have both testified against
9	the tobacco companies and received compensation,
10	and also assisted in drafting Surgeon General’s
11	Reports?
12	MR. BRODY: Objection.
13	A. I think sometimes they assisted in drafting
14	Surgeon General's Reports, before they became
15	witnesses. So, you see, you know --
16	Q. Hasn’t David Burns — are you done with your
17	answer?
18	A. Yes, I'm done.
19	Q. Hasn’t David Burns drafted numerous portions of
20	the Surgeon General’s Reports at the very same
21	time he was receiving compensation for testifying
22	against the tobacco companies?
23	MR. BRODY: Objection.
24	A. I assume that's probably true.
25	Q. All right.
2	A.	But I just — in terms of the ethics of that, you
3	know, I just, you know, the ethics of compensation
4	for testimony is a very interesting issue. How it
5	has shaped people's scientific postures or
6	understanding of questions would be comp heated,
7	because, on the one hand, people are asked to
8	testify because they have an area of expertise,
9	and then they participate in our, you know,
10	litigation system. So, you know, I'm not prepared
11	to, you know, make any categorical judgments about
12	the ethics of taking compensation for testimony.
13	Obviously, witnesses on both sides do that.
14	Q.	Are you aware of David Bums ever disclosing in
15	any of the Surgeon General's Reports he’s worked
16	on the fact that he's been receiving compensation
17	for testifying against the tobacco companies?
18	A.	I would just —
19	MR. BRODY: Objection.
20	A.	I assume that it's well known that Burns has
21	testified against the companies. So, in that
22	sense, you know, if we were to talk about a
23	concept like common knowledge, it may well be
24	common knowledge that Bums has participated in
25	that way. But I'm not aware of any disclosures.
2	Q.	Did you write your expert report?
3	MR. BRODY: Objection.
4	A.	Yes, I did write my expert report.
5	Q.	And did you write every word in your expert
6	report?
7	A.	I wrote every word in it.
8	Q.	Did you send drafts of your report to anybody for
9	review?
10	A. I did not.
11	Q. Did you discuss the content of your expert report
12	with anybody?
13	A. As I was working on it, you know, I have a very
14	excellent research assistant, and that was the
15	person who I would discuss the report with, you
16	know, regularly as I was developing it. And she
17	assisted me, you know, in the administrative
18	aspects of preparing the report.
19	Q. And what exactly did your research assistant do in
20	helping you prepare the report?
21	A. She would help search for materials I need, Xerox
22	articles, you know, look at online resources
23	associated with tobacco, go to the library and
24	find books that were relevant to things I was —
25	you know, I was investigating. So, she did all
2	those things in terms of the preparation of the
3	report.
4	Q.	Was your research assistant compensated by the US
5	government, or how was she compensated?
6	A.	Yeah, she was compensated — and I forget exactly
7	how many hours — but I think that in my proposal
8	for the costs of my preparation of the report, I
9	listed her for $30 an hour for — I forget exactly
10	how many hours. And she, you know, she was
11	compensated at that rate.
12	Q.	And in this proposal, did you have a set — like a
13	maximum number of hours you're going to work on
14	your -- in this case?
15	A.	Yes. I estimated that, you know, it would take
16	approximately 160 hours -- I think I mentioned
17	this yesterday — 160 hours to prepare a report
18	that covered these range of issues. And, you
19	know, I ended up spending just like slightly
20	longer than 160 hours, but I was compensated for
21	160 hours.
22	Q.	And whose idea was this proposal? Is that
23	something the government requested, or was that
24	something that you volunteered?
25	A.	I think the way the discussion went, if I remember
2	correctly, was that, you know, Mr. Kinner had come
3	to see me about the possibihty of my becoming an
4	expert in the case. He had talked to me about my
5	general interests in areas of considerable
6	expertise that related to issues in the case. And
7	then, after I talked to Mr. Brody, I also had the
8	opportunity to review those four expert statements
9	that I mentioned in my testimony yesterday. And
10	the idea was that I would be an expert rebuttal
11	witness in relationship to issues that had been
12	especially posed by Ludmerer, English and, to a
13	degree, Wilson.
14	And, then, I think I prepared a letter
15	that said, you know, these are the areas in terms
16	of, you know, what was the character of scientific
17	knowledge in the industry? What was the level of
18	scientific knowledge within the broader scientific
19	and medical community? How were they related over
20	time, and thought that it would take me about the
21	amount of time — I estimated it at 160 hours. I
22	think Mr. Brody asked me how much time it would
23	take to prepare, you know, a careful and detailed
24	report hke that. And that's how that number was
25	arrived at.
2	Q.	Do you still have a copy of that letter?
3	A.	I probably do.
4	Q.	Is that something you could provide to us?
5	MR. BRODY: Any request for documents
6	can come to counsel.
7	Q.	Do you have any objection to providing that
8	letter?
9	A.	Not really, no.
10	Q.	Did the government agree or say that it wouldn't
11	compensate you above the 160 hours?
12	MR. BRODY: Objection.
13	A.	They didn't say.
14	Q.	Do you know whether you're going to be compensated
15	for work beyond 160 hours?
16	A.	I'm going to be compensated for the time that I
17	spent in preparing for this deposition.
18	Q.	And other than your deposition time and the 160
19	hours, do you know if you’re going to be
20	compensated for any other work you do in the case?
21	MR. BRODY: Objection.
22	A.	I don't know. You know, I haven't discussed that
23	with counsel at the Department of Justice, but,
24	you know, my understanding was that I would be an
25	expert witness; that it would involve at least
2	three components in relationship to the case: The
3	preparation of an expert report, which you have in
4	front of you; the preparation and time it would
5	take for the deposition, which we're participating
6	in at this time; and, ultimately, preparation and
7	actual testimony in the case. And that was my
8	understanding in the agreement that I’ve reached
9	with Mr. Brody.
10	Q. Other than your research assistant, did you
11	discuss your expert report with anyone else?
12	A. I did discuss it with people, because, you know,
13	as I was doing the work, you know, it's been
14	characteristic for me to, you know, discuss with
15	colleagues, Here's what I’m doing, you know. I'm
16	collecting documents, I'm researching. I live in
17	a kind of very open academic environment. We're
18	like, you know, people come in, What are you
19	doing? What are you spending your time on? What
20	are the research questions you're working on today
21	or this month, so on? So, I have, you know,
22	discussed my — the fact that I was testifying in
23	some of the issues with many different colleagues
24	during this last, you know, six to eight-month
25	period.
2	Q. Did you ever discuss your expert report with any
3	of the lawyers for the US government?
4	A. The only person I discussed my expert report
5	with — and it was actually quite briefly after I
6	submitted it -- was Mr. Brody. That's the only
7	person I’ve talked to about my report.
8	Q. Did your research assistant have any
9	communications with the lawyers for the US
10	government?
11	A. She did not. When Mr. Brody visited me last week
12	to prepare for the deposition, my research
13	assistant, you know, sat in on one part of that
14	meeting. In part since she had been so supportive
15	and helpful in terms of my research on this, you
16	know, I wanted her to see how the issues in the
17	report would be discussed.
18	Q. And what are the qualifications of your research
19	assistant?
20	A. I have a highly-qualified and talented research
21	assistant, who, just this past May, received her
22	Ph.D. in history from Brandeis University.
23	Q. And what is her position at Harvard now?
24	A. She’s a research assistant. I’m sorry. Yeah, she
25	works principally for me in the Department of
2	Social Medicine, assisting me with, you know,
3	projects that I'm doing.
4	Q.	Is there anywhere in your expert report where you
5	acknowledge the limitations of your analysis or
6	the information you've looked at?
7	MR. BRODY: Objection.
8	A.	You know, I — unlike a scientific paper in which
9	one might acknowledge limitations, I don't view
10	this as, you know, something that, you know, I
11	would send off. I viewed this in the context in
12	which it was written, which is the role that this
13	document will play in a legal proceeding. So, I
14	did not do that. And I just — I had never
15	written an expert report before. And the
16	stylistic and ritualistic conventions of noting
17	limitations and so on, you know, just didn't
18	really occur to me, so —
19	Q. So, you didn’t note the limitations in your expert
20	report?
21	MR. BRODY: Objection.
22	A. No, I did not.
23	Q. But you would acknowledge limitations and lay them
24	out in any article that you submitted to a peer
25	review journal?
2	MR. BRODY: Objection.
3	A.	Not necessarily, but I certainly believe that, you
4	know, all work has limitations. And sometimes
5	it's important to be explicit about that.
6	Sometimes it’s your colleagues’ and peer
7	reviewers' job to identify one that you might not
8	be aware of.
9	Q.	I don't believe you cite any other witness's
10	expert reports in your expert report, is that
11	true?
12	A. No, I didn't cite other expert reports, no.
13	Q. Now, you've never testified on behalf of the
14	tobacco companies; that’s true?
15	A. No, I’ve never testified on behalf of the tobacco
16	companies.
17	Q. I think yesterday you mentioned that you had
18	rejected offers to testify on behalf of the
19	tobacco companies, is that true?
20	A. I don't know if it ever got quite so far as, you
21	know, some — a lawyer for the tobacco industry
22	saying to me, you know, We would like you to
23	testify. But at one point there was considerable
24	interest in my work on the part of some tobacco
25	company attorneys; and that’s when they came to
2	see me. And my understanding at the time was that
3	they were talking to me about my work as a
4	potential expert witness.
5	Q.	And when was that?
6	A.	Again, I would have to go back to check the date,
7	because it actually was in the 1980s.
8	Q.	Okay.
9	A.	And, you know, I do remember that some, you know,
10	people were there from different firms. I was
11	surprised. Quite a few tobacco lawyers showed up
12	that day, and I was only expecting one. So, it
13	was memorable to me, because I talked to a guy on
14	the phone who I said, you know, I really don't
15	think that I can be helpful to you. And he said,
16	Could I please come by? And then, much to my
17	surprise — I was a junior faculty member then —
18	had quite a small office — much to my surprise, a
19	bevy of tobacco lawyers showed up to speak to me.
20	Q.	Now, would you agree that plagiarism is a serious
21	academic offense?
22	A.	Yes, I would.
23	Q.	And plagiarism is copying somebody else’s work
24	without making any attribution, is that a fair
25	definition?
2	A.	Yes.
3	Q.	And in your view, is plagiarism unethical?
4	A.	To be highly discouraged.
5	Q.	And academics who are guilty of plagiarism are
6	disciplined?
7	A.	You know, generally if there's a show of intent,
8	yes.
9	Q.	If a professor were guilty of plagiarism, would
10	that negatively affect the credibility of his
11	research?
12	A. If they had been shown to have, you know,
13	deliberately and intentionally plagiarized another
14	scholar’s work, it could be damaging.
15	Q. If an academic were guilty of plagiarism, would
16	that undermine his credentials as an authority in
17	the field?
18	A. Certainly could.
19	Q. Now, you mentioned yesterday that there was a
20	package of documents that the government had sent
21	you. Do you remember that?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. Now, there are a number of documents that you’ve
24	cited in your report, right?
25	A. Yes.
2	Q.	Are all those documents from the set that the
3	government provided you, or were there other
4	sources for the documents in your report?
5	A.	There were other sources for the documents in my
6	report.
7	Q.	What percentage of the documents in your report
8	were given to you by the US government?
9	MR. BRODY: Objection.
10	A.	I didn't keep track of that. But, you know, so, I
11	just don't really know. But I've cited quite a
12	lot of documents in my report that weren't
13	provided me by the government, because I cite a
14	lot of the published scientific literature in my
15	report. And mostly what the government supplied
16	me were, you know, unpublished materials that came
17	from tobacco industry documents.
18	Q.	Are there any tobacco industry documents cited in
19	your report that weren’t provided by the US
20	government?
21	A.	Yes, quite a few, I think.
22	Q.	Can you give an estimate of the percentage of
23	tobacco company documents cited in your report
24	that came from the US government?
25	A.	I'd really — I really would hesitate to guess,
2	because, for example, I might get a report from,
3	you know, from the government that was written by
4	RJR scientist Allan Rodgman. And, then, I would
5	say, in the course of my research, Are there other
6	documents from Rodgman that are similar, are
7	different, that might make a point more
8	convincingly for the purposes of, you know,
9	illustrating my — and substantiating my opinions?
10	So, there might be two Rodgman documents, for
11	example; and one came from the Department of
12	Justice, and, you know, I have two others in my
13	research files; and, you know, would select the
14	one that I felt was most consistent with my
15	opinion and was more persuasive in its
16	substantiation.
17	Q.	On-
18	A.	So, you know, it wouldn't be difficult to answer
19	the question that you’re asking, but I don't know
20	offhand the percentage.
21	Q.	Well, did the Department of Justice provide you
22	with more than 50 percent of the tobacco company
23	documents cited in your report?
24	A.	Don’t know. I would — don't know.
25	Q.	You mentioned that it would be easy for you to
2	figure out what percentage of the tobacco company
3	documents in your report were provided by the DOJ?
4	A.	I think it would be, you know, not a, you know,
5	difficult process, because I can identify which
6	things came to my files from the DOJ, and which
7	things were, you know, discovered independently.
8	Q.	Is that something you could do here today?
9	A.	I don't think I can do it based upon the document
10	in front of me. I'd have to review the original
11	documents in my files. I did provide all the
12	documents cited, you know, when I submitted my
13	expert statement. So, you know, it — I don’t
14	think it would be a difficult process, but I'd
15	have to be in my office with the documents in
16	order to do it.
17	Q.	Well —
18	A.	Because I could look at the citations, but the
19	citations don’t identify for me, you know, which
20	things came out of the DOJ packet.
21	Q.	Okay. Would it be fair to say that you've cited a
22	number of the tobacco company documents that the
23	DOJ provided to you in your expert report?
24	A.	Yes.
25	MR. BRODY: Objection.
2	A. That would be fair.
3	Q. And when you turned over the documents cited in
4	your expert report to the tobacco industry, you
5	didn't indicate which ones you had received from
6	the DOJ, versus which ones you came up with on
7	your own?
8	A. I didn’t. I mean, you know, the report reflects
9	some material supplied by the DOJ, and, you know,
10	some of my research, which had occurred prior and,
11	then, during the process of preparing the report.
12	I certainly felt I did not want to be limited to
13	the materials provided by the DOJ for offering an
14	expert opinion.
15	Q. In your expert reports you cite some web sites
16	that you obtained tobacco company ads and things
17	like that from, is that true?
18	A. Yes, I think they’re cited in the report.
19	Q. Did your research assistant download those ads
20	that are cited in your report?
21	A. I believe she did.
22	Q. And what — how did she come to select those
23	particular ads?
24	A. Well, in consultation with me. We would look at
25	ads, and then, you know, say, Which ads represent
2	this particular idea? And, you know, I had been
3	quite interested in tobacco advertising for some
4	time. So, most of these ads were not, you know,
5	were not new to me. I was familiar with the ads.
6	Q.	You obtained documents you are using in this case
7	from — you obtained tobacco ads that you're using
8	in this case from the UCSF website, is that true?
9	A.	Yes, I've used the UCSF website, you know, quite a
10	lot. There have been additions about downloading
11	materials across the different tobacco web sites
12	— you may be aware of this — and sometimes it's
13	easier to download documents from one website or
14	another. And my understanding, from my research
15	assistant, is that the UCSF website was sometimes
16	more user friendly for downloads than some of the
17	other alternative web sites. And many of the
18	documents, as you know, are multiply available on
19	different web sites.
20	Q. And you also did the Richard Pollay, P-o-l-l-a-y,
21	tobacco advertising website to obtain some of the
22	documents that you’ve used in this case?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. And you also used the tobacco documents onhne
25	website to obtain documents that you're using?
2	A.	Yes.
3	Q.	Did you obtain tobacco company documents or ads
4	from any other web sites other than those three?
5	A.	I'm trying to think. Those are predominantly, you
6	know, the most useful sources for these kinds of
7	archival documents. Periodically, industry
8	documents come up on other sites. So, I have to
9	think. But, predominantly, in the production of
10	this expert statement, those were the sources —
11	the online sources I relied on.
12	Q.	You relied on those three web sites as a source of
13	documents about the tobacco companies in your
14	expert report?
15	MR. BRODY: Objection.
16	A.	Yes, I think that’s what I just said.
17	Q.	Okay. Do you know how the documents on the UCSF
18	website were selected?
19	MR. BRODY: Objection.
20	A.	I haven't investigated the selection of the
21	documents on the UCSF website.
22	Q.	Do you know how the documents on the Richard
23	Pollay tobacco advertising website were selected?
24	MR. BRODY: Objection.
25	A.	I don't.
2	Q.	Do you know how the documents on the tobacco
3	documents online website were selected?
4	MR. BRODY: Objection.
5	A.	No, I haven't really investigated sort of how they
6	have put together the web sites.
7	Q.	Okay. Isn't it true that the UCSF website is
8	maintained by Stan Glantz?
9	A.	My understanding is that it's maintained by the
10	UCSF library system. I'd be surprised if Stan
11	Glantz personally maintains that website. And I
12	think the UCSF library system, you know, is a
13	major state library system that has standards for
14	the maintenance and accessibility of materials.
15	But, you know, certainly Glantz's work and his
16	role in obtaining some of those materials, but I
17	don't think he maintains the website, which is
18	really through the medical library, if I
19	understand correctly.
20	Q.	And Stan Glantz works there at UCSF, is that
21	accurate?
22	A.	That's my understanding.
23	Q.	I think you’ve described Stan Glantz as an
24	antitobacco advocate, haven’t you?
25	A.	I think that would probably be accurate.
2	Q. And would you agree with Doctor Proctor that Stan
3	Glantz has pronounced antitobacco views?
4	MR. BRODY: Objection.
5	A. I didn't know whether Doctor Proctor said that,
6	but I believe Stan Glantz has been an active, you
7	know, antitobacco worker.
8	Q. Okay. Isn't the Richard Pollay tobacco
9	advertising website maintained by Michael
10	Cummings?
11	MR. BRODY: Objection.
12	A. I don't know who maintains that website.
13	Q. Do you know who maintains the tobacco documents
14	onhne website?
15	A. I don't know. I think that some materials that,
16	you know — either in the Master Settlement
17	Agreement or in the court cases that became public
18	— there was a relationship with the
19	tobaccodocuments.org. but I don't know — I have
20	not investigated the maintenance of those web
21	sites. You know, no, I just — it -- I don't know
22	enough about — I don't know the bureaucratic
23	aspects or administrative aspects of the
24	maintenance of those web sites.
25	Q. And did you download the documents that are cited
2	from those web sites yourself, or was that your
3	research assistant that did that?
4	MR. BRODY: Objection.
5	A.	Mostly my research assistant did it. She's a
6	lit lie bit more savvy computerwise at this stage
7	than I am, but I have been on those web sites.
8	MR. SMITH: I'm going to mark as Brandt
9	7 some frames from the Richard Pollay tobacco
10	advertising website.
11	(Pollay tobacco advertising website
12	frames marked Exhibit 7.)
13	Q.	Do you recognize this at all?
14	A.	I've been on this website.
15	Q.	And you'll note down at the bottom it mentions
16	that Dr. Michael Cummings developed the
17	collections on the website?
18	MR. BRODY: Objection.
19	A.	Yes. I see that it says that here.
20	Q.	Now, I wanted to show you one more of these. Now,
21	I think you testified earlier that Cummings had
22	worked as a witness testifying against the tobacco
23	companies, right?
24	A.	I was aware of that. I'm not sure exactly how,
25	but somebody must have told me or I knew it. I
2	have not seen any of his testimony in any cases.
3	Q.	Isn’t it true that Doctor Cummings has admitted
4	under oath that he may have plagiarized part of
5	one of the expert reports he submitted in a
6	tobacco case?
7	MR. BRODY: Objection.
8	A.	I just said I haven’t seen any of his testimony;
9	and, so, I'm not aware of that.
10	Q.	And the government never told you that?
11	A.	No, the government did not tell me about, you
12	know, Doctor Cummings’ testimony in other cases.
13	Q.	Has the government informed you that it’s dropped
14	Doctor Cummings as a witness in this case?
15	A.	The government didn't discuss its other witnesses
16	with me in any respect. So, I was unaware about,
17	you know, Doctor Cummings's status.
18	Q.	Why don’t we move along to — are you a member of
19	any tobacco-related organizations?
20	MR. BRODY: Objection.
21	A.	I get e-mail. So, I’ve signed up for different
22	e-mail list serves, but I don't think that means
23	I’m a member of any organization. I have
24	subscribed to some of the — I get a tobacco news
25	report every day. And, so, I signed up for that.
2	But I’ve never joined a tobacco organization.
3	Q.	Where — which e-mail server lists have you signed
4	up for?
5	A.	I get e-mail pretty regularly from that tobacco —
6	I think it was the tobacco BBS, which is
7	tobacco.org., I think; and they offer to send you
8	a daily update of tobacco news. And,
9	unfortunately, mine often comes in a form that my
10	e-mail reader doesn’t read effectively. But I do
11	get that. And it's a way that I have been able to
12	keep up with emerging tobacco news.
13	I get an e-mail frequently from Glantz;
14	and I get another one from somebody I think named
15	Godshall. So, somehow — I don't even know — I
16	don’t even recall signing up for these, but I get
17	them and, you know, they have some tobacco news,
18	you know, breaking news on the tobacco front
19	and —
20	Q.	What kind of e-mails does Glantz send you?
21	MR. BRODY: Objection.
22	A.	You know, he's not sending them to me personally.
23	But, you know, Glantz is very attuned to various
24	state legislative issues vis-a-vis tobacco,
25	especially some litigation issues in California.
2	And, so, it’s a way that — he's been very
3	involved recently of issues of tobacco smoking in
4	the media, and especially in commercial movies.
5	So, I sort of see — I see it as an historical
6	source. I have an idea of what Glantz is doing as
7	a result of these e-mails he sends me.
8	Q.	But as far as you’re aware, you're not an actual
9	member of any tobacco-related organization?
10	A.	I have not joined any tobacco organizations.
11	Q.	Have you had any communications with ASH?
12	A.	I don't know if I ever sent ASH an inquiry about
13	historical materials. I was interested in the
14	Bonzhalf initiative in the FCC from an historical
15	point of view. So, I don’t have any — you know,
16	I don't get their publications or things like
17	that. I've been on their website.
18	Q.	Did ASH ever provide you with any historical
19	materials about their activities?
20	A.	No, other than, you know, other than what I could
21	obtain on their website, which have some materials
22	relating to ASH’s history.
23	Q.	How about GASP, have you had any communications
24	with them?
25	A.	I haven't had any communications with GASP that I
2	know about, you know, that I can remember. No, I
3	haven't had any communication with them.
4	Q.	Have you had any communications with the Campaign
5	for Tobacco-Free Kids?
6	A.	I once met Matthew Myers, who was at Harvard for
7	some meeting. I met him. I had a talk with him
8	about, you know, his activities. I've also looked
9	at their website. But I haven't had any personal
10	interactions with Tobacco-Free Kids.
11	Q.	Have you had any interaction with the Tobacco
12	Products Liability Project at Northeastern
13	University?
14	A.	Again, I've kind of followed their work, you know,
15	kind of, you know, at a kind of distance. I once
16	was asked to speak at one of their meetings about
17	my work, which I did.
18	Q.	What meeting was that?
19	A.	You know, Richard Daynard, who has led that
20	project — I think he has annual meetings where he
21	discusses the state of litigation, antitobacco
22	programs and politics. I've known Dick Daynard
23	for a long time, because he was part of Pinney's
24	sort of dinner groups. And, so, you know, Dick
25	periodically would invite me to, you know, talk to
2	his group about, you know, my research, which, you
3	know, I did.
4	Q.	How many times have you talked to Richard
5	Daynard's group?
6	A.	Only one time in any kind of formal sense that I
7	can remember.
8	Q.	And when was that?
9	A.	I think it was probably two or three years ago.
10	It may be that when -- again, I've known Dick
11	Daynard since, you know, shortly after I came to
12	Harvard. And then, you know, in the late '80s,
13	when I started to, you know, think about more
14	concerted, you know, approaches to tobacco
15	research. Dick used to sometimes send a
16	plaintiff’s lawyer to talk to me about my work.
17	So, he and I would talk, you know, twice a year.
18	That kind of thing.
19	Q.	And the meeting of Daynard's group that you talked
20	to, was that a meeting of plaintiffs' lawyers?
21	A.	I don't know who he invites and who comes. I
22	think that, you know, plaintiffs' lawyers are, you
23	know, one of his constituencies. And, so, I sort
24	of assumed when I gave the talk that some of the
25	people in the audience were plaintiffs’ lawyers,
2	but —
3	Q. And did you discuss litigation against the tobacco
4	companies at the Daynard meeting?
5	A. I think I talked more specifically about what my
6	findings in my research had been. You know, I
7	haven't been a strategist about litigation. I've
8	been doing scholarship on the history of cigarette
9	smoking, the understanding of the science of the
10	harms of smoking, the history of the marketing of
11	tobacco. So, you know, I think that Plaintiffs’
12	lawyers, as the tobacco lawyers, had an interest
13	in this area, obviously, you know, a serious
14	historian, doing work in those areas. So, in that
15	sense, I think they were interested in what I had
16	to say. But I wasn't — my talk wasn’t about, you
17	know, new litigation. It was about my work.
18	Q. Was anybody at this conference you spoke at of
19	Daynard's group, did anybody talk about tobacco
20	litigation?
21	A. I assume so, but I only came for my talk, and I
22	didn’t participate in the meeting. You know, I
23	did my thing, and I left.
24	Q. Well, you know that Daynard’s group's been
25	involved in litigation against the tobacco
2	companies, right?
3	MR. BRODY: Objection.
4	A.	Well, of course, I know. I do know that.
5	Q.	And Richard Daynard advocates litigation against
6	the tobacco companies, right?
7	MR. BRODY: Objection.
8	A.	Yes, I'm aware that he's been an advocate for
9	litigation.
10	Q.	Maybe I’ll show you this excerpt from Daynard’s
11	group. We'll mark it as Brandt 8.
12	(Excerpt, 18th Conference of the Tobacco
13	Products Liability Project
14	marked Exhibit 8.)
15	Q.	It’s the 18th Conference of the Tobacco Products
16	Liability Project.
17	A.	The 18th Conference.
18	Q.	Up at the top.
19	A.	What page are you on?
20	Q.	Page 1.
21	A.	Page 1, yeah. It says ’'18th Conference,” yes.
22	Q.	Would the meeting that you spoke at of Daynard's
23	group be one of these conferences on — of the
24	tobacco products liability project?
25	A.	I don't know the series, so it would be hard to
2	say. But it must have — it may have been
3	something like this.
4	Q. Do you know if anyone paid a fee to attend the
5	conference at which you spoke at Daynard's group?
6	A. I really just don’t know. I, you know, he asked
7	me would I give a talk — and, you know — about
8	my work, and I agreed to do it. So, I wasn’t
9	involved in the planning of the meeting or, you
10	know, selection of people attending or --1 wasn’t
11	aware whether, you know, fees were charged. Just,
12	you know, I just -- I gave a talk.
13	Q. Did you receive any compensation for speaking at
14	Daynard's meeting?
15	A. No, I don’t think so. No, I didn't.
16	Q. If you’ll look at Page 3.
17	A. Page 3 of this document?
18	Q. Yes.
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. You’ll see that they have some presentations, and
21	one of them's by Michael Cummings.
22	A. Yes, I see that, Michael Cummings.
23	Q. And Michael Cummings’ presentation at the Daynard
24	meeting is on the Richard Pollay tobacco
25	advertising data base?
2	MR. BRODY: Objection.
3	A.	Right here it just says he’ll be talking about
4	tobacco product marketing, youth behavior,
5	consumer risk perceptions.
6	Q.	Up here (indicating).
7	A.	Oh, up here it says, yes, "Richard Pollay Tobacco
8	Advertising Archives Data Base." Yes, I see that.
9	MR. BRODY: For the record, what's been
10	marked as the exhibit actually appears to be two
11	separate documents stapled together or two
12	separate printouts stapled together.
13	MR. SMITH: That objection violated the
14	orders issued by the court.
15	MR. BRODY: Actually, it didn’t, and I
16	should state for the record that off the record
17	you admitted yesterday that you're not familiar
18	with this case or the orders in this case.
19	MR. SMITH: I didn’t say that off the
20	record. I'm familiar with all the orders, and I
21	have them sitting here at the deposition.
22	Q.	You see that they identify a number of web sites
23	of the Daynard group. One of them is the Richard
24	Pollay tobacco advertising website, another —
25	A.	I lost my place here. I'm sorry. Can you just
2	tell me what page you’re on?
3	Q.	Page 3.
4	A.	Page 3. I didn’t see any URLs listed there, but
5	are there —
6	Q.	Well, they describe the name of the web sites,
7	right?
8	A.	Well, right here it just says, "Michael Cummings,
9	Richard Pollay Tobacco Advertising Archives Data
10	Base," but whether, you know, that’s a website
11	isn't made clear here. So, you know, I know that
12	there is — you know, you've shown me this, and
13	this is at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute. And
14	here it says, "Richard W. Pollay 20th Century
15	Tobacco Advertisement Collection;" and I have used
16	that collection in my own research.
17	Q.	Okay, and also the tobacco documents online
18	website is listed in the Daynard document?
19	A.	Yes, I see that listed here.
20	Q.	And then the UCSF website's also listed in the
21	Daynard document?
22	A.	Yes. I think for people doing research on
23	tobacco-related questions, these web sites are,
24	you know, well-known resources.
25	Q.	Isn't this conference a conference on how to win a
2	verdict against the tobacco companies?
3	MR. BRODY: Objection.
4	A.	Yes. But I — you know, if there's an inference
5	there or an implication, I don't see necessarily
6	what it is. There’s a lot of public knowledge
7	available to many people who use those web sites
8	for many purposes. I, you know, I mean, I don't
9	know what the tobacco industry is — where they're
10	getting all of their documents now. But, you
11	know, some of these web sites could be useful in
12	recovery of documents to anyone in any litigation
13	associated with tobacco.
14	Q.	Okay.
15	A.	I haven't seen any indication, for example, that
16	the materials covered on these web sites are, you
17	know, in any way inauthentic. And I've assumed
18	that, you know, when I've recovered a document,
19	that, you know, some of the web sites actually
20	give some history to the document; there's
21	additional information. And, you know, I’ve found
22	them to be generally reliable.
23	MR. SMITH: Objection.
24	Q.	Have you had any conversations with Richard
25	Daynard about this case?
2	A.	I have not.
3	Q.	And when was the last time you talked to Daynard?
4	A.	I don't know. I did have a conversation with him,
5	I think, this past spring, because he was applying
6	for a grant on tobacco documents that he listed me
7	as a consultant on.
8	Q.	What kind of-
9	A.	But that was the last time.
10	Q. What kind of grant was that?
11	A. I thought it was a grant, I think, to the Robert
12	Wood Johnson Foundation, but it may have been --
13	there was also an NIH grant contract that had been
14	released on historical documents and their
15	archiving and preservation; and I knew that his
16	group had applied for it. And he called me up and
17	said, you know, Will you serve as an historical
18	consultant to our archival documents grant? And I
19	had agreed to do that.
20	Q. Okay. And what was your role going to be with
21	Daynard on that project?
22	A. I -
23	MR. BRODY: Objection.
24	A. I think that what he wanted was a professional
25	historian who could advise them about archiving
2	strategies for the volume of material that had
3	been produced in the litigation. And that was an
4	area where I had some expertise and had agreed
5	that — you know, he said, periodically, you know,
6	the archivists that they would be hiring to
7	conduct the project or whatever it was would, you
8	know, come see me and consult, Is this an
9	appropriate way of identifying finding aides and
10	so on for historical records? The profusion of
11	materials that had been produced in the litigation
12	has created questions about records management,
13	archives finding aides, as you may well know.
14	And, so, there have been a number of agencies
15	interested in what will be a process of, you know,
16	making it possible to appropriately recover these
17	materials, especially for historical research.
18	Q. And is the Daynard proposal where you've been
19	listed as a consultant, is that a proposal for a
20	grant to the US government?
21	A. You know, offhand, I just don’t remember. There
22	were two grants that I think he was talking about.
23	I don't remember which one I agreed to serve as a
24	consultant for. One of them may have been to the
25	government, but one of them I think was to the
2	Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. And I just — you
3	know, I could check, but I just don't know.
4	Q. Okay.
5	A. So far as I know, they have not gotten the grant.
6	So, I haven’t acted as a consultant, you know, for
7	a Daynard grant.
8	MR. BRODY: Why don’t we break for
9	lunch.
10	MR. SMITH: Okay.
11	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 12:37.

2	AFTERNOON SESSION (1:36 p.m.)
3	VIDEO OPERATOR: It’s 1:37, and we re on
4	the record.
5	Q.	Good afternoon, Doctor Brandt. We were talking
6	about grants before lunch. Do you have any — are
7	there any grants that you're listed on other than
8	the Daynard proposal that are pending now?
9	MR. BRODY: Objection.
10	A. Let me just see. I am listed on one other grant
11	that I know of. Periodically, I get an inquiry to
12	be a consultant on a grant, and it's at a very
13	provisional stage. So, I think this would be the
14	only one. A group of faculty at the Harvard
15	School of Public Health with a Professor Lisa
16	Berkman as the principal investigator, recently
17	got a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson
18	Foundation to develop a postdoctoral training
19	program called "Health and Society's Scholars."
20	And Professor Berkman was awarded that grant, and
21	I’m associated with the project.
22	So, it will bring postdoctoral scholars
23	to Harvard to do interdisciplinary research in
24	health and society, issues broadly construed, and
25	there will be a kind of historical component on
2	the history of epidemiology, pubhc health, and
3	public policy relating to health.
4	Q. And would that include any work on tobacco?
5	A. It could. It depends on what the — what the
6	fellows that come to the program want to work on.
7	But given that I'm associated with work in the
8	tobacco field, that might be an area that people,
9	you know, want to work with me or, you know.
10	Q. But the grant isn’t specifically on tobacco?
11	A. No, the grant's a postdoctoral training grant.
12	Q. In your work on — as a reviewer on the Surgeon
13	General's Report has the US government ever told
14	you not to make copies of the drafts of the
15	Surgeon General's chapters that you’re reviewing?
16	MR. BRODY: Objection.
17	A. I just don't recall, because I haven't reviewed
18	for the Surgeon General's organization in a while.
19	But they may advise reviewers to please not do
20	that. That's pretty common policy in peer review
21	things, because copies of unpublished materials,
22	you know, aren't always copyrighted yet, you know,
23	aren’t protected. And, generally, I think
24	reviewers know not to circulate or copy that
25	material.
2	Q.	The Tobacco Institute was a trade organization,
3	correct?
4	A.	That’s correct.
5	Q.	And there are a number of trade associations in
6	Washington representing different industries, is
7	that correct?
8	MR. BRODY: Objection.
9	A.	I think so.
10	Q.	And trade associations are the way industries
11	lobby or speak in Washington, would that be
12	accurate?
13	MR. BRODY: Objection.
14	A.	It’s one of the ways that industries lobby.
15	Q.	Would you agree that industries have a First
16	Amendment right to lobby the government?
17	MR. BRODY: Objection.
18	A.	I haven't studied the constitutional protections
19	on lobbying. So, you know, I just don’t really
20	know the answer to the question. You know,
21	there's nothing in the constitution that says
22	lobbying is protected, cause it's a more recent,
23	you know, historical development than the
24	constitution. So, I don’t know whether that's
25	been tested or anything like that. But, you know,
2	certainly, you know, much lobbying takes place,
3	you know, within legal parameters.
4	Q. And would you advocate a ban on the tobacco
5	companies being allowed to lobby Congress?
6	A. I never really considered that. I, you know, I
7	just don’t know whether I would. You know, I'd
8	have to know, again, a little bit more about the
9	context. But, you know, I don't think I have
10	advocated that. And I don't necessarily think
11	that I would in the future.
12	Q. Isn't it a fact that Surgeon General Richmond had
13	the relationship between the Tobacco Institute and
14	the US government evaluated when he was the
15	Surgeon General?
16	MR. BRODY: Objection.
17	A. I don't know if he had it evaluated. I don't
18	know.
19	Q. Isn't it a fact that he concluded that the
20	dealings between the Tobacco Institute and the
21	government were professional and proper?
22	MR. BRODY: Objection.
23	A. I don't know.
24	Q. Have you reviewed any testimony by Julius Richmond
25	on the government's evaluation of the relationship
2	between the government and the Tobacco Institute?
3	MR. BRODY: Objection.
4	A.	I have not reviewed any Richmond testimony on
5	that.
6	Q.	Have you reviewed any of the internal US
7	government documents on the Tobacco Institute?
8	MR. BRODY: Objection.
9	A.	No, I haven't.
10	Q.	Are you aware of any scientific study showing that
11	requiring cigarette ads to be black and white
12	reduces cigarette consumption?
13	A.	I've looked at that literature, and I’m aware that
14	there are notions of so-called tombstone
15	advertising or changes in packaging; that one
16	argument is that it could reduce consumption; but
17	I haven't carefully evaluated all the behavioral
18	and scientific studies on that question. I know
19	it's one proposal for potentially reducing
20	cigarette consumption. I think some nations have
21	actually experimented with it.
22	Q.	Are you aware of any data that’s been collected
23	showing that black and white advertising reduces
24	cigarette consumption?
25	A.	I just don’t recall. I don’t know that — I don’t
2	know offhand the literature on that.
3	Q.	Are you aware of any data collected that shows
4	that black and white cigarette packaging reduces
5	cigarette consumption?
6	MR. BRODY: Objection.
7	A.	I don't know that literature.
8	Q.	Okay. Are you aware of any scientific data that's
9	been collected showing that banning promotional
10	Items such as key chains or T shirts reduces
11	cigarette consumption?
12	A.	I think there’s been, you know, the argument that
13	that could potentially be a vehicle for reducing,
14	for example, young people's interest and knowledge
15	of tobacco products. But those things are very
16	hard to study in terms of, you know, is there data
17	which demonstrates it conclusively? So, I just
18	don’t know the data on those types of
19	interventions and how those studies are designed,
20	so —
21	Q.	It would be difficult to design a study that would
22	show that banning promotional items reduces
23	cigarette consumption?
24	MR. BRODY: Objection.
25	A.	It would be complicated.
2	Q.	Okay. Are you aware of any scientific data that's
3	been collected showing that banning self-service
4	displays reduces cigarette consumption?
5	A.	Self-service displays meaning coin-operated
6	machines or —
7	Q.	Self-service displays, I guess, in stores. Have
8	you seen any?
9	A.	Self-service means that you could take the package
10	yourself. I think most of the restrictions now
11	require that tobacco products be behind the
12	counter. So I'm just not familiar with the term
13	"self-service display."
14	Q. Okay. But your understanding is there are already
15	restrictions saying that tobacco items have to be
16	behind the counter?
17	A. I am aware that that's how tobacco is marketed in
18	most places now.
19	Q. Are you aware of any scientific study showing that
20	eliminating point-of-sale advertising and trade
21	promotion reduces cigarette consumption?
22	A. I don't know that literature. I'm not aware.
23	Q. You haven't seen any data like that?
24	A. I just haven’t reviewed the data on these
25	potential interventions for reduction. There may
2	be.
3	Q.	Would it be complicated to develop a study to look
4	at whether point-of-sale advertising and trade
5	promotions reduces cigarette consumption?
6	MR. BRODY: Objection.
7	A.	When I say something’s complicated, I think most
8	things are complicated; and, you know, could
9	potentially be done. So, you know, I don't mean
10	to mean that it's so formidable that some of these
11	issues could not be evaluated. I think that many
12	of them can.
13	Q. Are you aware of the scientific data that's been
14	collected showing that banning vending machines
15	reduces cigarette consumption?
16	A. I think at one time I did take a look at the
17	coin-operated vending machines, and there was a
18	suggestion that that was a popular vehicle for
19	under-aged smokers to obtain tobacco. So, again,
20	I haven't looked at the literature that shows
21	impact, but that's potentially a way to reduce
22	under-age consumption.
23	Q. But you haven’t seen any data that's been
24	collected on the topic of banning vending
25	machines?
2	A.	I haven't reviewed that data.
3	Q.	All right. Yesterday you had mentioned the 1954
4	Hueper article, is that correct?
5	A.	I think you mentioned it.
6	Q.	Are you familiar with the 1954 Hueper article?
7	A.	Yes, I'm familiar with it.
8	Q.	Did you consider the 1954 Hueper article in
9	forming your opinions in this case?
10	A.	No.
11	Q.	Oh, there's one thing I wanted to follow up from
12	before the break. Remember when we were
13	discussing the peak year cigarette consumption you
14	had mentioned that you had written an article on
15	— that had contained graphs on cigarette
16	consumption?
17	A.	Yes.
18	Q.	I'm handing you what’s been marked as Brandt 9,
19	which is a chapter of a book that you wrote
20	entitled, "World Trends in Smoking."
21	(Chapter from "World Trends in Smoking"
22	marked Exhibit 9.)
23	A.	Yes, I had a contribution in this volume.
24	Q.	Is your chapter what's in front of you?
25	A.	Yes, it is.
2	Q.	And on the first page of your chapter there’s a
3	graphic that shows cigarette consumption, per
4	capita cigarette consumption?
5	A.	Yes.
6	Q.	And isn’t it true that the peak year of per capita
7	cigarette consumption was 1964?
8	A.	I think it is true from this graph. It's a little
9	bit hard to read, because, you know, this is not
10	year-to-year data, but a crude graph over time.
11	But, you know, I had said yesterday it was around
12	'64, 65. And the point that I had tried to make
13	yesterday about, you know, declines, and then
14	increases, are reflected in this graph.
15	Q. So, the peak year of per capita cigarette
16	consumption would be either 1964 or 1965?
17	A. Yes, I think that's roughly true.
18	Q. Okay. That's all I have for that document. I'm
19	handing you a copy of what I've marked as Brandt
20	10, which is a document dated February 4th, 1958,
21	from the Chief of the Cancer Control Program of
22	the US Public Health Service, Louis Robbins, to
23	the Chief of the Division of Special Health
24	Services. Is that what's in front of you?
25	A. Yes, it is.
2	(Louis Robbins document, 2/4/58
3	marked Exhibit 10.)
4	Q.	And you see that in this 1958 Robbins document,
5	Point No. 1 in the middle of the paragraph states
6	"About half the scientific community does not
7	believe that cigarette smoking causes cancer"?
8	A.	Yes, I see that.
9	Q.	Have you ever seen this document before, the 1958
10	Robbins document?
11	A.	No, I don’t believe I’ve seen this before.
12	Q.	And you didn’t consider the 1958 Robbins document
13	in developing your opinions in this case?
14	A.	No, I did not.
15	Q.	And based on the 1958 Robbins document, there were
16	people within the US Public Health Service in 1958
17	that had the view that half of all scientists did
18	not believe that smoking caused cancer?
19	MR. BRODY: Objection.
20	A.	I just want to read a bit so I can see exactly
21	what this says. (Witness reviews document.) I
22	was just wondering in this last paragraph, can you
23	read this word where it says "I suggest instead of
24	—" is that "— manning a program," naming a
25	program step at this point"? I just couldn't
2	quite make that out.
3	Q.	I think it might be "making".
4	A.	"Making," yeah. I think that's right.
5	Q.	But it's not clear from —
6	A.	Okay.
7	Q.	-- this copy of the document.
8	A.	Yeah, I see the document. Apparently, that was,
9	you know, Doctor Robbins' perspective, circa '58.
10	Q. Okay. Just so the record’s clear, though, the
11	1958 Robbins document, based on that, you conclude
12	that there were people in the US Public Health
13	Service that had the view that half of the
14	scientific community did not believe that smoking
15	causes cancer?
16	MR. BRODY: Objection.
17	A. The way I would phrase this, from a professional
18	historical perspective, is that in 1958 Doctor
19	Robbins took that position.
20	Q. Okay. And Doctor Robbins was the Chief of the
21	Cancer Control Program at the United States Public
22	Health Service?
23	A. That's correct. I mean, there are other things in
24	the document that, you know, would reflect
25	Robbins' particular, you know, perspective on the
2	issue. So, the document is actually, you know,
3	quite an interesting document in terms of Robbins'
4	perspective on public health, relationship of the
5	scientific community to public health policy. So,
6	you know, if I were provided this piece of, you
7	know, historical data, I would subject it to a
8	kind of careful analysis for its particular
9	meaning.
10	I'm not surprised to find that there
11	were individuals, you know, who believed circa '58
12	that about half the scientific community does not
13	believe that smoking causes cancer. There
14	certainly were individuals like that, some of whom
15	were highly trained and in positions of authority.
16	Q. But the US government never provided you with a
17	copy of the 1958 Robbins document before you
18	drafted your expert report?
19	MR. BRODY: Objection.
20	A. Yes. I think I made clear that, you know,
21	precisely what the government provided me with in
22	terms of documentation did not include this
23	document.
24	Q. I'm going to hand you another document that's been
25	marked as Brandt 11. You see this is another
2	document by Dr. Louis Robbins, dated 7/11/1960.
3	(Louis Robbins document, 7/11/60
4	marked Exhibit 11.)
5	Q.	It's entitled "Double Standard." It's a paper on
6	smoking and lung cancer. Is that what's in front
7	of you?
8	A.	Yes, it says, "Paper on Smoking/Lung Cancer:
9	Double Standard."
10	Q.	If you take a look at the first paragraph of the
11	1960 Robbins document, he states that, "Recently,
12	there have been a great many papers which have
13	criticized the statistical methods used to show a
14	relationship between cigarette smoking and lung
15	cancer."
16	A.	Yes, I see that.
17	Q.	And Robbins also states in his 1960 document, "A
18	recent paper by George Saiger, S-a-i-g-e-r, which
19	appeared in the JAMA for June 11,1960, ably
20	discusses such problems as the sampling bias,
21	absence or inadequacy of controls, and proper
22	interpretation of associations and errors of
23	extrapolation."
24	A.	Yes, I see that.
25	Q.	Do you agree that at this time in 1960 there were
2	a number of papers that criticized the statistical
3	methods in the studies showing a relationship
4	between lung cancer and smoking?
5	MR. BRODY: Objection.
6	A. Yes, there were papers that criticized the
7	scientific work on smoking and lung cancer.
8	Q. And have you ever seen this 1960 Robbins document
9	before?
10	A. No, I haven't seen it before.
11	Q. And you didn’t consider this 1960 Robbins document
12	in forming your opinions in this case?
13	A. No, I didn't. You know, there would be
14	interesting questions about a document like this.
15	You know, marked "rough draft," you know, did he
16	publish it? You know, was it widely distributed
17	in the government? I mean, there would be a whole
18	set of questions, you know, about this.
19	Q. Well, have you ever undertaken any study to
20	determine whether Louis Robbins ever published his
21	views on smoking and lung cancer?
22	A. I don't know whether he did or not.
23	Q. Now, in the document, Louis Robbins also states
24	that, "Since such concerns are not new, one must
25	conclude that the findings to date on smoking and
2	lung cancer are inadequate to prove a relationship
3	between the two." Do you see that?
4	A. Yes, that was not an unusual position.
5	Q. Okay. That wasn't an unusual position that the
6	evidence didn't prove that there was a
7	relationship between smoking and lung cancer in
8	1960?
9	A. Among a small group of, you know, critics of the
10	lung cancer/smoking data, this was essentially
11	their position.
12	Q. And would Louis Robbins be a critic of the lung
13	cancer and smoking data?
14	A. Apparently so.
15	Q. All right. And Louis Robbins worked for the US
16	government?
17	A. Yes, apparently he did.
18	Q. And there were people in the US government in 1960
19	that criticized the data showing a relationship
20	between smoking and lung cancer?
21	MR. BRODY: Objection.
22	A. When you say "people,” you know, the evidence
23	you’ve shown me is that Louis Robbins had that
24	position, so, you know —
25	Q. The head of the Cancer Control Program in the US
2	Public Health Service criticized the data showing
3	a relationship between smoking and lung cancer in
4	1960, true?
5	MR. BRODY: Objection.
6	A. Yes, he did.
7	MR. BRODY: Doug, what's the Bates
8	number reference there?
9	MR. SMITH: There is no Bates number.
10	MR. BRODY: AS000?
11	MR. SMITH: That’s an exhibit number.
12	MR. BRODY: From which litigation?
13	MR. SMITH: It’s probably on our exhibit
14	list in this litigation.
15	MR. BRODY: It is not. There are no
16	exhibit hsts in this litigation. So, you don't
17	know?
18	MR. SMITH: I think it’s in our exhibit
19	list in a number of litigations. It would have
20	been on the exhibit list in the Falise litigation,
21	for example. I don't know how that's relevant.
22	MR. BRODY: I’m just curious.
23	Obviously, relevance is not a standard for
24	yesterday or today.
25	Q. I'm going to hand you a copy of what's been marked
2	as Brandt 15, which is an article by Louis
3	Robbins, published in the 1962 edition of
4	Minnesota Medicine.
5	MR. BRODY: Are we going to come back to
6	12, 13 and 14?
7	MR. SMITH: Did I just mark that? Why
8	don’t we remark that.
9	MR. BRODY: 12.
10	MR. SMITH: 12.
11	A. Okay. So, this is — do you want it back or just
12	put it on top?
13	Q. Yeah.
14	A. Okay.
15	MR. SMITH: So, just so the record’s
16	clear, Exhibit 12 is a copy of an article written
17	by Louis Robbins in Minnesota Medicine, dated
18	1962.
19	(Louis Robbins article, Minnesota
20	Medicine, 1962, marked Exhibit 12.)
21	Q. Is that what’s in front of you, Doctor Brandt?
22	A. Yes, it is.
23	Q. And you see in the attribution on the first page
24	that Louis Robbins is identified as the Chief of
25	the Cancer Control Program?
2	A.	Yes, I see that.
3	Q.	Have you ever seen the 1962 Louis Robbins
4	publication before?
5	A.	No, I haven't seen this publication before.
6	Q.	You didn’t consider the 1962 Louis Robbins
7	publication in forming your opinions in this case?
8	A.	No, I didn't. I haven't covered some of these
9	state medical association journals in my research.
10	Some of these state medical association journals,
11	for example, are not peer reviewed. They reflect,
12	you know, opinion pieces or review articles. And
13	while I find a document like this of considerable
14	interest, I wouldn't say that it is fundamental in
15	any way to understanding the trajectory of the
16	lung cancer/cigarette science. So, you know, I
17	would want to read the article, you know, quite
18	carefully.
19	It appears to be a conventional critique
20	— and there were many — of the lung
21	cancer/cigarette link.
22	Q. There were a number of critiques of the lung
23	cancer and cigarette link in 1962?
24	A. They are getting to be fewer and farther between
25	by 1962. So, that makes this a more unusual
2	document than 1958, and, you know, more unusual
3	than 1956; and, you know, but by 1962, there was a
4	conventional critique of the lung cancer/cigarette
5	smoking relationship, which had been demonstrated
6	for the most elite peer-reviewed scientific
7	articles. So, you do find a tendency for articles
8	hke this to appear in things like the State
9	Association of Minnesota, as opposed to, you know,
10	the Lancet, or the British Medical Journal, or the
11	New England Journal of Medicine.
12	But even there, there were, you know,
13	ongoing criticisms of the lung cancer/cigarette
14	causal science. So, I see articles hke this. I
15	have articles hke this in my files. I don’t
16	think that my statement purports that there
17	weren't critics of the arguments that lung cancer
18	was caused by cigarette smoking. There were more
19	eminent critics than Louis Robbins.
20	Q. But one of the critics of the link between lung
21	cancer and smoking in 1962 was the head of the
22	Cancer Control Program in the US public service,
23	correct?
24	MR. BRODY: Objection.
25	A. Yes, I think that’s been made clear.
2	Q.	Okay. I've got a question about one of your
3	articles; and I'll try to get the exhibit number
4	right this time. I think we're on Brandt 13,
5	which I'm handing to you.
6	MR. SMITH: Brandt 13 is a copy of an
7	article or of part of a book that you wrote
8	entitled "The Rise and Fall of the Cigarette," is
9	that what's in front of you?
10	A.	Yes.
11	("The Rise and Fall of the
12	Cigarette," marked Exhibit 13.)
13	Q.	Now, if you turn to Page 65 of your article.
14	A.	Yeah.
15	Q.	You’re discussing the epidemiological studies in
16	the '50s and '60s on smoking and lung cancer, is
17	that right?
18	A.	Yes.
19	Q.	And in your article you state that the
20	"Epidemiological research touched off an important
21	debate within the scientific community about the
22	nature of causality, proof, and risk."
23	A.	Show me where you are again, I'm sorry.
24	Q.	It’s at the top of the first full paragraph.
25	A.	Oh, top of first — "This type of research touched
2	off an important debate," yes.
3	Q. The epidemiological studies on smoking, would you
4	agree touched off an important debate within
5	the scientific community about the nature of
6	causality, proof, and risk"?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. And later on in that same article you state that
9	"The debate about smoking and health revealed an
10	interprofessional battle between epidemiology and
11	lab science, their values, assumptions, and
12	expectations."
13	A. Yes. Do you have a question about that?
14	Q. Well, do you still stand by that position?
15	MR. BRODY: Objection.
16	A. I largely still stand by that position. I have a
17	more sophisticated understanding of it after 10 or
18	12 years of additional research. You know, I
19	could amplify the character of that debate from my
20	subsequent research, you know, better than I could
21	at this time. But, you know, roughly what I wrote
22	here, you know, I have confirmed in my own work.
23	I think that one of the potential
24	applications of my understanding of the tensions
25	between epidemiological findings and laboratory
2	experimental science is that that turns out, upon
3	deeper historical inquiry, to be somewhat less of
4	a dichotomous — a dichotomous debate, than,
5	perhaps, the way it appears to be categorized
6	here. So, I find epidemiologists, you know, quite
7	interested in the laboratory. I find some
8	laboratory scientists quite interested in
9	epidemiological work. And the idea that
10	epidemiology was this sort of bounded area of
11	inquiry, it turns out that epidemiology was really
12	quite interdisciplinary, even at that time, and
13	utilized findings from the laboratory to frame its
14	questions, related to laboratory science in
15	different w ays.
16	So, I do think that there were
17	interesting issues about the rise of quantitative
18	science in medical science and pub he health that
19	were certainly raised by the introduction of new
20	epidemiological investigations and techniques.
21	Q. I have one other question on this page. You note
22	in the next section at the top that "There was
23	considerable debate about the imphcations of
24	these findings for pubhc health authorities."
25	A. Yes.
2	Q. And it’s true that there was a debate about the
3	implications of the findings regarding smoking and
4	lung cancer as far as for the public health
5	authorities?
6	A. Yes, I think there was debate about the
7	implications of the findings for public health
8	authorities. You know, what would be appropriate
9	for public health authorities to do in the face of
10	identifying the harms of tobacco?
11	Q. If you turn to the next page, 66, at the bottom
12	you note that "The Surgeon General's Committee
13	developed a set of criteria for evaluating causal
14	relationships that has been widely applied since
15	that time."
16	A. Uhm.
17	Q. It's at the bottom.
18	A. Yes, I see.
19	Q. And the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee did
20	come up with a set of criteria for evaluating
21	causal relationships that you've described in your
22	article?
23	A. Yes. You know, what that doesn't make clear is
24	that the committee came up with these causal
25	criteria based upon, you know, a long historical
2	assessment of causal criterias for causality
3	within medicine within — so, these weren’t new.
4	They were the ones that the committee reasoned
5	would be robust in the context of the work that
6	the committee had to do, which is make a
7	decision — Did smoking cause lung cancer and
8	other diseases? So, for people who had followed
9	debates about causality in medicine, you know,
10	these are the ones that they selected to explain
11	how and why they selected them. For people who
12	had been interested in the problem of causality,
13	going back to Koch's Postulates, and the idea,
14	Does an organism cause a disease? And how do we
15	know? And how do we test it? This was part of a
16	long history of scientists and physicians
17	discussing on what basis can we make judgments?
18	Q. Okay. So, would it be fair to say that when — in
19	1964 when the report was issued, there were
20	different criteria that had been developed in the
21	scientific community for evaluating causation?
22	A. I would say there was a range of criteria that had
23	been applied in specific instances. And, you
24	know, depending on the disease and the development
25	of symptomatology and other things, you know,
2	different criteria could be applied for making
3	those assessments and the abihty to get
4	scientific knowledge.
5	Q. And the Surgeon General's Committee selected
6	certain criteria — but not others — that were
7	available forjudging whether smoking caused
8	cancer?
9	MR. BRODY: Objection.
10	A. Well, they didn't select them. They went through
11	a very scrupulous process for making an argument
12	about why these criteria, you know, scientifically
13	ought to apply in this instance.
14	Q. The Surgeon General selected the best criteria in
15	its view forjudging causation that were available
16	at the time, would that be fair?
17	A. I think that's roughly fair.
18	Q. Okay. But it had choices as to what criteria were
19	used to evaluate causation?
20	MR. BRODY: Objection.
21	A. The idea that it had these choices and it made
22	them, you know, it evaluated the best mechanism
23	for making a causal determinism; and these
24	criteria are the ones that they utilized.
25	Q. Okay. Then, on the next page, if you'd look at
2	the first full paragraph, you stated that the
3	ability of self-interested parties, such as the
4	tobacco industry, to disparage the findings was
5	now delimited once the, you know, the Surgeon
6	General issued his report.
7	A. Yes, you know, I think that delimited is the
8	operative term. I would say, given the sort of
9	rich research materials that I've had accessible
10	to me since I authored this, you know, I'm
11	certainly impressed that the tobacco industry's
12	ability to disparage the findings was more
13	powerful than I would have anticipated. So, I
14	know a lot more about the actions of the tobacco
15	industry since I wrote this.
16	MR. SMITH: Objection.
17	Q. At the time, though, when you wrote "The Rise and
18	the Fall of the Cigarette," you stated that the
19	1964 Surgeon General’s Report had delimited the
20	tobacco industry’s ability to disparage its
21	findings.
22	MR. BRODY: Objection.
23	A. Yes, I did write that when I wrote this piece.
24	Q. Now, if you turn back to the last page in the
25	footnotes of — right above the footnotes of your
2	article.
3	A.	Yes.
4	Q.	There's a note on grant support. I think
5	yesterday you had testified that you hadn't
6	received any government grants. But it looked
7	like there was some attribution here to a National
8	Institutes of Health grant, and I was just
9	wondering whether you had actually received a
10	grant from the National Institutes of Health or
11	not?
12	MR. BRODY: Objection.
13	A. Yeah, that’s — I never did receive a grant from
14	theNIH. I have some memory of this, and I could
15	check the records. My understanding is that
16	perhaps my department or the medical school had
17	received a general grant for junior faculty from
18	the NIH; and that I was instructed — during that
19	year or two that they had these funds that were
20	supporting my salary — to acknowledge this
21	particular grant in publications, because the
22	medical school needed to keep track of work that
23	was produced by faculty under this large training
24	grant or something like that. It was a relatively
25	brief period of time. But I received a
2	notification from my administrator saying, you
3	know, since part of your salary may come from
4	these sources -- it was that general. I have this
5	idea that that's where that appeared from. But
6	that could, certainly, be checked. But if we went
7	back and checked these numbers, I'm quite certain
8	that I was not an individual recipient of that
9	grant for any specific work that I did. It had to
10	do with the medical school's overall relationship
11	with the NIH.
12	Q. Okay. Maybe we can just clarify the record then.
13	You haven't specifically received any grants on
14	tobacco from the US government?
15	A. I have not.
16	Q. But you may have received some funds just by way
17	of a training grant to the medical school that
18	were given to the medical school by the US
19	government?
20	A. That certainly is precisely my understanding
21	and —
22	Q. I've got an article that I’m marking as Brandt 14,
23	which is a copy of a paper by K. R. Cross
24	entitled, "A study of the Tracheobronchial
25	Epithehum and Changes Related to Smoking." Have
2	you ever seen the Cross article, which is dated
3	1961 before?
4	(Cross article marked Exhibit 14.)
5	A.	I don't see where it's dated. Can you show me?
6	Q.	If you turn to the last page, at the bottom
7	there's a —
8	A.	I see.
9	Q.	— statement of the date down there at the
10	bottom, and it's 1961.
11	A. 1961. I see that, yes.
12	Q. Have you ever seen the 1961 Cross article before?
13	A. I have not seen it.
14	Q. If you look at the last page in the summary
15	section.
16	A. Yes, this very last page.
17	Q. The Cross article states that "A significant
18	relationship was demonstrated between smoking, the
19	amount and degree of atypical metaplasia, and the
20	incidence of bronchogenic carcinoma."
21	A. Yes, I see that.
22	Q. The Cross articles states that "There's a
23	relationship between cigarette smoking and lung
24	cancer."
25	MR. BRODY: Objection.
2	A.	Apparently, it does. That’s the only paragraph in
3	the Cross article I've ever read.
4	Q.	Okay. If you look at the first page of the Cross
5	article, dated 1961, you see that it was supported
6	by a grant from the Tobacco Industry Research
7	Committee?
8	MR. BRODY: Objection.
9	A.	Yes, I see that.
10	Q. And, so, in 1961, TIRC funded studies that said
11	there was a relationship between smoking and lung
12	cancer?
13	A. It does say that. In order to evaluate the whole
14	thing, you know, I mean, just the way I work, and,
15	you know, I want to make this clear is that, you
16	know, I'd like to read the whole article and put
17	it in a context. But it does conclude here that
18	there was a relationship, a significant
19	relationship between smoking and the incidence of
20	bronchogenic carcinoma.
21	Q. And the US government didn't provide you the 1961
22	Cross article in the packet of documents they sent
23	you for your expert report?
24	A. I think I’ve been pretty clear about what the US
25	government provided me. But, no, they did not
2	provide this article.
3	MR. BRODY: That actually refers to a
4	relevant question, which is, again, on the number.
5	Is that an exhibit list number?
6	MR. SMITH: It's an exhibit list number,
7	and we can discuss it on our own time after the
8	deposition if you want.
9	MR. BRODY: Well, is it from a prior
10	industry litigation? Is it an exhibit that was
11	used by the industry in prior litigation? I mean,
12	do you have any idea is, I guess, the first
13	question?
14	MR. SMITH: I know it's on an exhibit
15	list in tobacco cases, and so does the US
16	government, but they didn’t provide it to Doctor
17	Brandt.
18	MR. BRODY: Do you have any idea why it
19	wasn’t produced to us in response to our
20	preliminary or comprehensive requests in this
21	litigation?
22	MR. SMITH: Because it's apubhshed
23	article that you have access to, Doctor Brandt has
24	access to, and the whole world has access to, but
25	you didn't provide Doctor Brandt.
2	MR. BRODY: Somehow I doubt that is a
3	sufficient explanation for the failure to produce
4	it.
5	MR. SMITH: I don't know that it was
6	produced to you, by the way. Do you know that?
7	MR. BRODY: It’s not Bates numbered.
8	MR. SMITH: Do you know whether it was
9	produced to you?
10	MR. BRODY: I'm pretty sure it was not.
11	If you could look into it, that would be great,
12	and see if there are any deficiencies in the
13	production by the Defendants. I'll follow up with
14	a letter to Jonathan.
15	Q.	Okay, Doctor Brandt, I’m handing you a copy of
16	Brandt 15, which is an article by Hans Falk
17	entitled, "The Effect of Cigarette Smoke and Its
18	Constituents on Ciliated Mucus-Secreting
19	Epithelium." Have you ever seen that article
20	before?
21	(Falk article marked Exhibit 15.)
22	A.	I'm just trying to see where it appeared.
23	Q.	If you look on Page 2.
24	A.	The Journal of the National Cancer Institute. No,
25	I don't think I’ve seen this before.
2	Q.	And the date on it says it was received for
3	publication in March 1959.
4	A.	Yes.
5	Q.	And you didn't consider the 1959 Falk article in
6	forming your opinions in this case?
7	A.	No, I didn't.
8	Q.	I've got another article I'm marking as Brandt 16,
9	which is an article by Herbert Lombard entitled,
10	"An Epidemiological Study of Lung Cancer Among
11	Females." It's dated 1968 in the journal
12	"Growth". Is that what's in front of you?
13	(Lombard article marked Exhibit 16.)
14	A.	Yes, that’s what I have here.
15	Q.	Have you ever reviewed the 1967 or 1968 Lombard
16	article before?
17	A.	I don't think — I don't think so.
18	Q.	And you see that the 1968 Lombard article was
19	funded with a grant from CTR?
20	MR. BRODY: Objection.
21	A.	I'm just looking here. Is that here on the front
22	page?
23	Q.	Yes, in the footnotes on the front page.
24	MR. BRODY: Objection.
25	A.	Yes, I see that now.
2	Q.	So, you see that the 1968 Lombard article was
3	funded by CTR?
4	A.	Yes.
5	Q.	Now, if you turn to Page 54, which is in the
6	middle of the discussion section, do you see that?
7	A.	54, yes.
8	Q.	Do you see that the Lombard article states that
9	"The 1959 to 1962 mortality study showed that the
10	lung cancer death rate in females increased with
11	heavy smoking. This was strengthened in the
12	interview morbidity study in which heavy smokers
13	had over twice the probability of developing lung
14	cancer than did nonsmokers."
15	MR. BRODY: Objection.
16	A.	Yes, I see that.
17	Q.	And CTR, again, funded research in 1967 that
18	showed that female smokers had an increased risk
19	of lung cancer?
20	MR. BRODY: Objection.
21	A.	Yes. This would have been about the same time,
22	you know, that Clarence Cook Little would have
23	been announcing on behalf of CTR that there was no
24	proof that lung cancer was in any way associated
25	with cigarette smoking. So, that’s a very
2	interesting document.
3	VIDEO OPERATOR: Want to change tapes?
4	The time is 2:22. We are off the record.
5	(Discussion off the record.)
6	A. Mr. Smith, can I just amplify my last answer?
7	VIDEO OPERATOR: Let me just announce
8	the fact that the time is 2:24. We are recording
9	and on the record. This is the beginning of
10	Cassette No. 3.
11	A. I just want to say, like, I just read the
12	conclusion of the last exhibit, No. 16 that you
13	provided me, and if you read the conclusion, you
14	know, it says, "While there's some evidence to
15	suggest that certain host factors in previous
16	chronic respiratory diseases may be responsible
17	for some of these cases, the etiology of a large
18	number of lung cancer cases among females still
19	remains obscure." So, this just raises the
20	question for me.
21	MR. BRODY: Cindy, could you hit "mute"
22	on your end. Thanks.
23	A. You know, just getting back to issues of
24	historical method, the implication of the brief
25	statement you took out is that this is a document
2	which confirmed that lung cancer causes — that
3	lung cancer is caused by smoking, you know,
4	researched and supported by the CTR. But one
5	would have to have a full sense of, really, what
6	the predominant findings of this particular
7	article are to know precisely what its full
8	argument is. And, you know, by just taking a
9	brief statement, I can't really assess it from an
10	historical point of view. I can tell you that it
11	says that on Page 5, or whatever the page is.
12	And, you know, that's what we just did.
13	But if I really had time to review this
14	in the way that I review historical documents for
15	evaluation of their arguments and their
16	significance, that we didn’t do.
17	MR. SMITH: Objection.
18	Q. The government didn't provide you a copy with the
19	1968 Lombard article so you could review it and
20	put it in historical context before you drafted
21	your expert report, did they?
22	MR. BRODY: Objection.
23	A. Yes. And I guess what I'm saying is that, you
24	know, I'm not convinced that this would in any way
25	change any of the findings in my expert report.
2	Q.	Okay. Isn't it true that the 1968 Lombard article
3	in the conclusions section says that "There is a
4	positive relationship between cigarette smoking
5	and undifferentiated epidermoid lung cancer among
6	females."
7	MR. BRODY: Objection.
8	A.	But positive doesn’t necessarily constitute
9	causal. So, yes, it says there's a relationship.
10	Anyway, this is a sophisticated and complex
11	article; and I’m just saying, you know, generally
12	the way I address complex articles is not by
13	taking a sentence out and saying, you know, what
14	does it say here, but to evaluate the whole piece.
15	Q.	And you didn’t have this article, the 1968 Growth
16	article to evaluate as a whole piece before you
17	wrote your expert report, did you?
18	MR. BRODY: Objection.
19	A.	I already noted I did not have it.
20	Q.	Isn't it true that the Council for Tobacco
21	Research has funded research that concludes that
22	there's a significant decrease in birth weights of
23	infants bom to mothers who smoke?
24	MR. BRODY: Objection.
25	A.	I think it did fund that research. And, then,
2	when Joseph Cullman, the President of Philip
3	Morris, was asked about that research, he said
4	maybe some women prefer to have smaller babies.
5	MR. SMITH: Objection.
6	Q. Have you reviewed the publications of Paul Kotin,
7	who was a member of the SAB, for his statements on
8	whether lung cancer caused smoking?
9	MR. BRODY: Objection.
10	A. I said I'm familiar with Kotin's work, but I
11	haven’t systematically reviewed his statements on
12	lung cancer.
13	Q. Have you reviewed any of Kotin's statements in the
14	1950s or 1960s on whether smoking causes lung
15	cancer?
16	MR. BRODY: Objection.
17	A. I'm not sure. I may have seen some of his work.
18	Q. Isn't it true that Kotin stated in 1959 that
19	smoking caused lung cancer?
20	MR. BRODY: Objection.
21	A. It may be. If you want to show me the exhibit, I
22	could, you know, tell you more definitively.
23	Q. The government didn't provide you any statements
24	by Kotin from the 1950s or 1960s?
25	MR. BRODY: Objection.
2	A.	I've made clear about what the government provided
3	me. They did not provide me with his statements.
4	Q.	Okay. Have you discussed this case at all with
5	David Kessler?
6	A.	I have not discussed the case with David Kessler.
7	Q.	Have you had any conversations with David Kessler
8	on tobacco?
9	A.	On one occasion, I had a conversation with David
10	Kessler on tobacco. Yale Medical School invited
11	me to give a lecture there probably last October,
12	October 2001, and Kessler introduced me; and then
13	we had a public discussion about tobacco for
14	medical students principally.
15	Q. And what exactly did that discussion entail?
16	A. Well, I briefly presented some of my historical
17	work. And then Kessler likes to play a kind of
18	public role of interrogator; and, so, we sat on a
19	stage in chairs, you know; and it was a little bit
20	like a talk show. And he asked me about the
21	history of tobacco and different issues, the role
22	the industry played, the character of the changing
23	science of causality, implications for other
24	issues in the history of medicine. It was part of
25	a forum that the medical school at Yale was
2	developing on the history — historical topics in
3	medicine and public health.
4	Q. And when was this exactly, do you remember?
5	A. I think I said October 2002. I'm sorry, I said
6	October, 2001, yes. I just said, October, 2001,
7	last October.
8	Q. Okay. Did you guys discuss at all the review you
9	wrote of Kessler's book?
10	MR. BRODY: Objection.
11	A. I think he told me that he liked the review.
12	Q. And did Kessler think that the review was an
13	accurate review of his book?
14	A. He didn't say.
15	Q. I'm handing you a copy of what’s been marked as
16	Brandt 17, which is a copy of a document dated
17	July 31, 1954, which is Hill & Knowlton memorandum
18	to T. B. Hartnett. Is that what you have in front
19	of you?
20	(Memo, 7/31/54 marked Exhibit 17.)
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And you're familiar with Hill & Knowlton's role
23	regarding the Frank Statement?
24	A. I am.
25	Q. And you discussed that in your expert report?
2	A.	I did discuss it in my expert report.
3	Q.	Now, at the last paragraph on the first page —
4	A.	Yes.
5	Q.	— you see that the 1956 Hill & Knowlton
6	memorandum states that, "It was agreed that the
7	wisest course of action would be for the industry
8	to find out, through objective research, what
9	truth there was, if any, in the charges being made
10	against it."
11	A.	Yes, I see that.
12	Q.	Have you ever been provided with a copy of this
13	1954 Hill & Knowlton memorandum?
14	A.	I'd have to check, but this is — I've seen
15	documents like this. I may well have seen this
16	one. Yes, I’ve — you know. I can't say for sure
17	I've seen this one, but I could check my records
18	and see if I've seen it. But I've seen documents
19	like this.
20	Q.	Okay. As reflected in the 1954 Hill & Knowlton
21	memorandum about — the tobacco companies agreed
22	that the wisest course of action would be for the
23	industry to find out, through objective research,
24	what truth there was, if any, in the charges being
25	made against them?
2	MR. BRODY: Objection.
3	A. Yes, it says that right here. And, in fact, that
4	was the basis of the Frank Statement, which said
5	that the, you know, the industry would essentially
6	spare no expense to find out objectively what
7	truth there was. And, then, this document goes on
8	to define a very aggressive public relations
9	campaign for — on behalf of the industry that
10	would, in part, demonstrate how the industry
11	attempted to get very positive messages into the
12	media about their product during a time of
13	considerable public uncertainty.
14	So, it's quite an interesting document.
15	It’s extensive. It’s 20 pages. And here it says
16	that Mr. Hill stated that "It would be a serious
17	public relations mistake for the industry to make
18	any move that could cause it to be accused of
19	disregard for people's health." So, I have no
20	question about any of that.
21	Q. Okay, and you haven't read all 20 pages of this
22	since I handed it to you a few minutes —
23	A. No, I am familiar with this document.
24	Q. You are, okay.
25	A. I'm pretty sure I have this document in my files.
2	It may well be one of the documents that I used in
3	preparing my report, which, of course, I then
4	distributed to Defendants' counsel with my report.
5	Q.	Doesn't this 1954 Hill & Knowlton memorandum state
6	that Doctor Little, who is the Scientific Director
7	of CTR, felt that the industry must make no
8	controversial statement on scientific matters
9	unless they were fully supported by facts and
10	approved by the Scientific Advisory Board?
11	MR. BRODY: Objection.
12	A.	Yes, it says -- that’s what Doctor Little feels.
13	Q.	Okay. Okay.
14	A.	I'd love to walk through a document hke this with
15	you, because this document says many things.
16	Q.	Now, I'm going to hand you a copy of another
17	document, which we'll mark as Brandt 18, which is
18	a December 20, 1962 memorandum from Doctor Hammill
19	to Doctor Hundley from the national archives, do
20	you see that?
21	(Memo, 1/20/62 marked Exhibit 18.)
22	A.	Yes, I see it.
23	Q.	And Doctor Hammill was involved with the Surgeon
24	General's Advisory Committee, is that true?
25	A.	Yes, he was, during a portion of its work.
2	Q.	Okay.
3	A.	My understanding is not for the whole time.
4	Q.	And you see that this memorandum discusses a
5	meeting that the US government had with C. C.
6	Little of the TIRC?
7	A.	I don't see where that is.
8	Q.	(Indicating.)
9	A.	We're now on Page — okay, yes.
10	MR. BRODY: 680903459.
11	A.	Okay. I'm there.
12	Q.	And the 1962 Hammill memorandum describes the
13	meeting with the TIRC as "congenial" and
14	"profitable" in the first paragraph?
15	MR. BRODY: Objection.
16	A.	In the first paragraph?
17	Q.	This is Hammill writing to Hundley, is that
18	correct?
19	A.	Yes. It says, "The meeting was most congenial, I
20	think, most profitable." Yes, I see that.
21	Q.	And, also, they give certain impressions of Doctor
22	Little in this document?
23	MR. BRODY: Objection.
24	A.	Yes, I think so. I think at one time I may have
25	seen this document, although I didn't rely on it
2	in terms of my preparation for my expert
3	statement. But I've seen documents like this.
4	I'm not surprised to see it.
5	Q.	And Doctor Hammill of the US government stated
6	that Doctor Little was one of the most estimable
7	men he had ever met?
8	MR. BRODY: Objection.
9	A.	I haven't found that in here. I'm having trouble
10	reading, just cause it’s not such a good
11	reproduction. But let me just read for a minute.
12	Okay?
13	Q. It’s up at the second paragraph.
14	A. Yes, I see that.
15	Q. And then the document goes on to list a number of
16	types of information that the TIRC agreed to
17	provide to the Surgeon General's Committee on
18	Pages 2 and 3.
19	A. Where it starts with "these numbers from the
20	individual scientist from the Scientific
21	Director,” is that what you mean?
22	Q. Actually, on the bottom of Page 2 it says, "In
23	summary, the types of information to make
24	available to us are," and then it gives a list of
25	different kinds of information.
2	A.	Oh, I see it down here, yes.
3	Q.	And the 1962 Hammill document outlines a number of
4	different types of information the TIRC agreed to
5	give to the Surgeon General's Committee?
6	MR. BRODY: Objection.
7	A.	Yes. Apparently, that's what this is.
8	Q.	And then if you turn to Page 3 of the document.
9	A.	Yes.
10	Q.	In the next-to-last paragraph--
11	A.	Yes.
12	Q.	— it states that "Doctor Little and his staff did
13	not appear to be desperately trying to protect
14	tobacco or to create jobs for themselves. They
15	seemed overwhelmingly pleased with our activities
16	and seemed most desirous to help in any way
17	possible."
18	MR. BRODY: Objection.
19	A.	Yes, it does say that.
20	Q.	Okay, and the 1962 Hammill document indicates that
21	"Little didn't seem to be critical of their
22	activities."
23	MR. BRODY: Objection.
24	A.	Yes, I think it is generally indicative of that.
25	You know, there's a story behind this, which is
2	the relative propriety of Little's meeting with
3	Hammill and Hammill's impression of — Hammill's
4	impression of Little. And Hammill was replaced
5	during the course of the first Surgeon General's
6	Committee's work; and during that period there's
7	some historical indication that he was having
8	emotional problems and was unreliable. And,
9	ultimately, Guthie replaces Hammill. It's not
10	widely known, but it’s in some documentation
11	that’s in the National Library of Medicine. But
12	Hammill was regarded by the committee as
13	unreliable, sometimes immature, eager to get on
14	with senior figures in the industry, and was
15	eventually replaced.
16	So, it's, you know, it's quite an
17	interesting historical document in terms of, you
18	know, its insight into Hammill and his perspective
19	on his meeting with Little.
20	Q. And have you seen any documents following up on
21	this meeting?
22	A. Well, I know that Hammill was replaced, because he
23	was having — my understanding, and it would be
24	good to confirm this, you know, before writing
25	about it, certainly and that I would — was that
2	Hammill was having emotional problems during this
3	period and had to be replaced; and he was replaced
4	by Guthrie; that the committee was pleased with
5	that replacement; and they went ahead and did
6	their work. And there's a lot of information
7	about the industry's relationship with the first
8	Surgeon General’s Committee and the concerns that
9	the industry had during this period about what the
10	report would say, and so on.
11	So, you know, this certainly tells you
12	about, you know, Hammill’s meeting with Little.
13	Q. I'd like to hand you a copy of an article that you
14	had written with Surgeon General Richmond we’ll
15	mark as Brandt 19.
16	("A Smoke Screen" marked Exhibit 19.)
17	Q. It's entitled, "A Smoke Screen: They Can't Hide
18	From the Truth," published in 1997. Is that
19	what's in front of you?
20	A. Yes. I'm just trying to see where this appeared.
21	This doesn't identify — I'm surprised, because
22	usually these things should identify where this
23	appeared. I wrote several things with Doctor
24	Richmond, so I just wanted to be certain that I
25	knew which one this was. Historians are
2	unbelievably scrupulous about citations where
3	things appear and things hke that, you know,
4	so —
5	Q. Do you remember writing that article?
6	A. Yes, I do. I remember writing this.
7	Q. Okay. I had a couple of questions about the
8	article. In your 1997 article with Richmond you
9	state that the public's well informed, right?
10	A. Yes, it does say that.
11	Q. "And, certainly, the litigation against the
12	tobacco industries has made the public well
13	informed about the hazards of smoking."
14	MR. BRODY: Objection.
15	A. I think what I would say is that the litigation
16	has been one element of making the public better
17	informed. You know, it says here, "The
18	traditional role of the tobacco industry has been
19	to confuse the public about the harmful effects of
20	smoking." And the point here is that, you know,
21	very careful litigation can bring many facts to
22	light about the role the industry's played and
23	served to enhance the information available to
24	citizens.
25	Q. And at this point in 1997, you and Surgeon General
2	Richmond expressed the view that at that point the
3	public was well informed about the hazards of
4	smoking?
5	MR. BRODY: Objection.
6	A.	Yes. That's what it says.
7	Q.	Have you reviewed any submissions made by the
8	American Medical Association to the FTC?
9	A.	No, I haven't, I don't think.
10	Q.	Okay. I'd like to hand you a copy of what’s been
11	marked as Brandt 20. It’s a copy of another
12	article you wrote entitled, "Tobacco Epidemiology
13	and the Challenge of Multiple Etiologies,"
14	published in 1998 in the Journal of the American
15	Medical Association.
16	("Tobacco Epidemiology..." marked
17	Exhibit 20.)
18	A.	Yes.
19	Q.	And that's in front of you?
20	A.	Yes, I have it here.
21	Q.	And the last paragraph of your 1998 article you
22	state that "Even tobacco company executives have
23	been forced to accept that smoking is harmful," do
24	you see that?
25	A.	Yes.
2	Q.	And in 1998 you expressed the view that the
3	tobacco company executives had been forced to
4	accept that smoking is harmful?
5	MR. BRODY: Objection.
6	A.	Yes. That's what it says. It says, "Even tobacco
7	company executives have been forced to accept that
8	smoking is harmful."
9	Q.	And, then, you also expressed the view in your
10	1998 article that "Progress in the epidemiologic
11	investigation had helped turn the medical
12	profession and the public powerfully against
13	smoking"?
14	MR. BRODY: Objection.
15	A.	Yes, it does say that.
16	Q.	And your 1998 article also states that "Both the
17	medical profession and the public accept the harms
18	of secondhand smoke."
19	MR. BRODY: Objection.
20	A.	Yes, it says that.
21	Q.	In your 1998 article you express the view that
22	"Both the medical profession and the public accept
23	the addictive nature of nicotine."
24	MR. BRODY: Objection.
25	A.	Yes.
2	Q.	And in your 1998 article you also stated that
3	"Both the medical profession and the public —"
4	A.	You didn’t finish that previous sentence. You
5	interrupted right in the middle of a sentence.
6	Q.	I was going to ask you about the remainder of the
7	sentence right now, all right?
8	A.	Okay. Yeah.
9	Q.	In your 1998 article you also note that "The
10	public had been made aware of the exploitation of
11	children by the tobacco industry."
12	MR. BRODY: Objection.
13	A. Yes, I do.
14	Q. And in your 1998 article you also state that "The
15	public and the medical profession had been made
16	aware of the knowledge and intent of the tobacco
17	industry."
18	MR. BRODY: Objection.
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. All right. Now, maybe 1 11 mark another one of
21	your articles as Brandt 21, which I'm handing to
22	you. It's a copy of a chapter that you wrote
23	entitled "Blow Some My Way: Passive Smoking Risk
24	in American Culture," which was published in 1998
25	in "Ashes to Ashes: The History of Smoking and
2	Health," is that what —
3	("Blow Some My Way..."
4	marked Exhibit 21.)
5	A.	Yes, I'm familiar with the article.
6	Q.	And that’s what’s in front of you?
7	A.	Yes, I see it now.
8	Q.	And in this article did you express the view that
9	concerns about the effects of smoke on nonsmokers
10	began in the 1970s to reenergize the antitobacco
11	movement?
12	A.	Yes, I believe that’s substantially true, yes.
13	Q.	And you also go along to —
14	MR. BRODY: Where are you reading from?
15	MR. SMITH: I was just asking him a
16	question.
17	Q.	You go along to discuss some of the Surgeon
18	General’s Reports on environmental tobacco smoke.
19	MR. BRODY: Objection.
20	A.	I'm just looking here. Yes, I certainly must have
21	mentioned the Surgeon General’s Report on
22	environmental tobacco smoke in this article.
23	Q.	Well, if you turn to Page 169, you are discussing
24	that 1986 Surgeon General’s Report on
25	environmental tobacco smoke put out by Surgeon
2	General Koop, is that —
3	A.	Yes, I see that here.
4	Q.	And you state that "Studying the risks of active
5	smoking in the 1950s have proven complex from an
6	epidemiologic perspective. The problem of
7	specifying the risk of ETS are even more
8	daunting."
9	MR. BRODY: Objection.
10	A.	Yes. That's what it says here.
11	Q.	And it’s true that there have been a number of
12	methodological problems in studying whether
13	environmental tobacco smoke is associated with
14	disease, is that fair?
15	MR. BRODY: Objection.
16	A.	There certainly have been methodological issues
17	that have been the subject of considerable
18	discussion.
19	Q.	And you note that "Only one of the four are
20	prospective studies cited by the Surgeon General
21	and the National Academy of Science reported
22	results statistically significant at the five
23	percent level"?
24	MR. BRODY: Objection.
25	A.	That's one thing I note here, among others.
2	Q.	But most of the studies that purport to show a
3	relationship between environmental tobacco smoke
4	and disease are not statistically significant, is
5	that correct?
6	MR. BRODY: Objection.
7	A.	I don't know that. I would have to review that.
8	In fact, I don't think it says that here.
9	Q.	Well, would it be fair to say that only one of the
10	four studies relied on by the Surgeon General in
11	stating that environmental tobacco smoke causes
12	disease in the 1986 report was statistically
13	significant?
14	MR. BRODY: Objection.
15	A.	Well, it goes on. It says, "Although 10 to 15
16	case control studies found an increased risk of
17	lung cancer, four studies found no increased
18	risk." I think what it says is very clear. And,
19	you know, I'm sure it's an accurate description of
20	the Surgeon General’s Report.
21	Q.	Okay. Is it true that even before the risk of
22	passive smoke had been demonstrated, there were
23	already regulations put in place restricting the
24	right of smoking in public?
25	A.	I don't think that the right of smoking in public
2	was what was restricted. There were specific
3	restrictions about where one could publicly smoke.
4	So, you know, so I think — I don’t accept the way
5	it's characterized in your question. Are you
6	looking at a specific place?
7	Q. Yeah. Actually, I was looking on Page 172—
8	A. Okay.
9	Q. — under the heading, "Regulating Public Smoking."
10	Are you there?
11	A. Now I’m there. Yes, it says, "Even before
12	systematic data was available demonstrating the
13	risk of passive smoking, grass roots antismoking
14	organizations began to push successfully for the
15	public regulation of cigarette smoking in the
16	1970s, demanding their right to a smoke-free
17	environment."
18	Q. So, there were restrictions regulating cigarette
19	smoking at certain public locations before the
20	evidence demonstrating that passive smoking was
21	harmful was discovered?
22	MR. BRODY: Objection.
23	A. For sure. I mean, one of the arguments in this
24	paper is that passive smoking was both being
25	evaluated for its specific health related harms
2	that others might incur, but it was also widely
3	perceived as annoying and a nuisance,
4	environmentally polluting. And, so, there was
5	considerable interest in potential restrictions on
6	certain public smoking, even in anticipation of
7	confirmatory scientific evidence of its health
8	harms. And one of the things I'm trying to argue
9	is that it's not just health harms that led to
10	these strictures, but health harms, in addition to
11	the perceived environmental sort of, you know,
12	pollution associated with smoking.
13	Q. And one other conclusion that you state in your
14	1998 article was that "It's been difficult to
15	sustain an effective public movement in support of
16	smoking."
17	MR. BRODY: Objection.
18	Q. Is that accurate?
19	A. Could you tell me where you are again?
20	Q. I'm over on Page 175 now.
21	A. Okay. I'll just go there. Where? Tell me.
22	Q. In the middle of the middle paragraph there.
23	A. Yeah. (Witness reviews document.) Where it says,
24	"Although the tobacco companies have attempted to
25	counter the grass roots antismoking movement with
2	a smokers’ rights movement all their own, such
3	efforts have fallen on deaf ears." Is that —
4	yeah. "It has been difficult to sustain an
5	effective public movement in support of smoking."
6	Yes, I think that that’s, you know, that's true.
7	I don't think there's going to be grass roots
8	demand to change workplace restrictions. I don't
9	think that, given what we know about smoking,
10	there is going to be, you know, an aggressive
11	citizens' campaign to support more smoking in
12	American society.
13	MR. BRODY: Why don't we take a short
14	break.
15	MR. SMITH: Okay, sure.
16	VIDEO OPERATOR: The time is 2:54. We
17	are off the record.
18	(Recess was taken.)
19	VIDEO OPERATOR: The time is 3:04. We
20	are recording and on the record.
21	Q. Doctor Brandt, do you believe that smoking
22	prevalence is going to continue to decline in the
23	future?
24	A. It would depend on where and under what
25	circumstances. So, I mean, going to decline
2	globally? No. Going to decline in the United
3	States? One would hope, given the consistency of
4	appropriate public health interventions. But the
5	current percentage of approximately 26 percent has
6	been relatively constant over a number of years.
7	There's some speculation we’ve plateaued,
8	actually; that the people who are currently
9	smoking are among those who are having the most
10	difficulty quitting. So, I don’t have a position
11	about the future. I don’t know where smoking
12	rates are going.
13	Q. Haven’t you stated that you expect that smoking
14	rates will decline in the United States in the
15	next two decades?
16	MR. BRODY: Objection.
17	A. I don't remember saying that. It's possible I
18	said it, you know, out of hopefulness. But, you
19	know, it's always hard to have data on the future.
20	Maybe if you have something to show me that says I
21	said it.
22	Q. Well, I'll just move along to something else. Why
23	don’t I mark as —
24	A. Are we up to 22?
25	Q. Actually, why don’t I ask you a question first:
2	Have you reviewed any recent medical texts to see
3	what they say about smoking and causation?
4	MR. BRODY: Objection.
5	A.	I haven't looked at recent medical texts. You
6	know, texts in the 21 st Century, for example,
7	about what they say. I haven't been doing that
8	work.
9	Q.	And would you be surprised if, within the last ten
10	years, there are medical texts that say that while
11	smoking's a risk factor for lung cancer, labeling
12	it as a causative agent would be inappropriate?
13	MR. BRODY: Objection.
14	A. I don't think I would be surprised, because I
15	think that there remains, you know, a minority
16	position that was deeply committed to very
17	explicitly mechanistic assumptions about
18	causality. So, I'm familiar with that — I'm
19	familiar with that sort of strata within
20	scientific debate. So, when people show me things
21	like that, it doesn't surprise me, because there
22	are people who, you know, there are people who say
23	HIV does not cause AIDS — responsible, elite
24	scientists. And there are people who still say,
25	you know, it has not been proven that smoking
2	causes lung cancer.
3	There will always be a full perspective
4	of people saying different things, and that's why
5	it's so hard to reach, you know, strong historical
6	opinions where it says — even though you can
7	locate these people around the universe that will
8	say, you know, things that, you know, are unusual,
9	that they're unrepresentative. So, I'm not
10	surprised. Very few things surprise me. That's
11	the other thing about being an historian.
12	Q.	I'm handing you a copy of Brandt 22, which is an
13	article in Journal of the American Medical
14	Association, and, actually, it says it's the full
15	text of an AMA letter of testimony to the FTC.
16	(Letter of testimony to FTC marked
17	Exhibit 22.)
18	Q.	And it’s dated 1964. Is that what’s in front of
19	you?
20	MR. BRODY: Objection.
21	A.	Yes, I think that is what’s here.
22	Q.	And have you ever seen this 1964 AMA letter to the
23	FTC?
24	A.	It does not look familiar to me.
25	Q.	And you didn’t consider the 1964 AMA letter to the
2	FTC when you were forming your opinions?
3	A. I did not use this in preparing my expert report.
4	Q. If you look at this letter, you see that in the
5	first column it states that "With respect to
6	cigarettes, cautionary labeling cannot be
7	anticipated to serve the public interest with any
8	particular degree of success. The health hazards
9	of excessive smoking have been well publicized for
10	more than ten years and are common knowledge."
11	MR. BRODY: Objection.
12	A. Yes, I see it says that.
13	Q. So, in the view of the AMA in 1964, the hazards of
14	smoking were common knowledge?
15	MR. BRODY: Objection.
16	A. No, in the view of F. J. L. Blasingame, you know,
17	who was an Executive Vice President of the AMA, he
18	felt that labels would not be of benefit. I don't
19	think that — I don’t know that — well, I can’t
20	tell here whether he's representing the AMA or
21	not. I'd have to see precisely what this was.
22	So, I don't know whether he was, you know, making
23	this argument in his official capacity at the AMA
24	for the organization, or whether this is his
25	personal, you know, perspective on it.
2	Q. Well, if you look at the letter, you see that it
3	states right at the beginning, "The American
4	Medical Association is appreciative of the
5	invitation received from George Dobbs, M.D., an
6	Associate Chief of your Division of Scientific
7	Opinions to express its views with respect to the
8	proposed trade regulation rules for the
9	advertising and labeling of cigarettes."
10	MR. BRODY: Objection.
11	A. Yes. Now I see that, and, you know, I think that
12	would be — this is the first time I’ve seen this
13	document. But now I see it, and, you know, I
14	believe that this must have been the AMA position
15	on labeling until 1964.
16	Q. And the AMA position on labeling in 1964 was that
17	the health hazards of smoking had been common
18	knowledge due to the publicity, and, therefore, no
19	label was needed?
20	A. That was their position. There were many, you
21	know, many positions that the AMA took during this
22	particular period of time, you know, that one
23	could evaluate or question. So, I’m not surprised
24	at all to see this.
25	Q. Okay. I'm handing you a copy of Brandt 23, which
2	you’ll see is a memorandum from Samuel Chilcote,
3	C-h-i-l-c-o-t-e, from the Tobacco Institute, dated
4	December 21, 1982. Is that what’s in front of
5	you?
6	A.	Yes, it is.
7	(Memo, 12/21/82 marked Exhibit 23.)
8	Q.	Have you ever seen the 1982 Chilcote document
9	before?
10	A.	I don't believe so.
11	Q.	If you turn to the next page, you see there are
12	some comments of Samuel Chilcote in an Executive
13	Committee meeting in 1982?
14	A.	Yes. That seems what this is.
15	Q.	Now, if you turn to Page 2 of Mr. Chilcote’s
16	comments.
17	A.	I'm sorry, what page?
18	Q.	Page 2.
19	A.	Yes.
20	Q.	Are you there?
21	A.	Yes.
22	Q.	Chilcote states, "Our credibility as a source of
23	information on smoking and health is so low it is
24	almost unmeasurable, and has been for all of these
25	past ten years."
2	MR. BRODY: Objection.
3	A. Yes, I see that. It says that.
4	Q. So in the view of the Tobacco Institute, the
5	tobacco industry's credibility as a source of
6	information on smoking and health was so low it
7	was almost unmeasurable?
8	MR. BRODY: Objection.
9	A. That was certainly Chilcote's view, apparently.
10	Q. And then the Chilcote document goes on to discuss
11	the American Cancer Society.
12	MR. BRODY: Objection.
13	Q. Do you see that?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And the Chilcote memo indicates that at least in
16	Chilcote's view, the American Cancer Society
17	enjoyed high levels of credibility on smoking and
18	health issues.
19	MR. BRODY: Objection.
20	A. Yes, that’s what it says here.
21	Q. Have you seen any other documents about Chilcote?
22	A. I don't believe so.
23	Q. You know, in your work on the 2000 Surgeon
24	General's Report — I can't remember — did I ask
25	you who you worked on that with?
2	MR. BRODY: Objection.
3	A. I think that you did, and I didn't recall
4	specifically who I worked on with it. I think I
5	told you I was — if my memory serves me
6	correctly, I was a general reviewer. I received a
7	late copy saying, you know, Do you think this is
8	good? And I probably, you know, if I responded, I
9	wrote a note saying, you know, that, you know,
10	that — so, I don't remember working on the 2000
11	report with — you know, with any great attention.
12	Q. Okay. We had discussed Mr. Gostin before. Did he
13	author a chapter of your book "Morality and
14	Health"?
15	A. Yes, he was a contributor to an anthology that I
16	was the editor of.
17	Q. Okay, and do you remember reviewing Mr. Gostin's
18	chapter in morality and health?
19	A. Yes, I reviewed it.
20	Q. And did you agree with Mr. Gostin’s conclusions in
21	his piece in morality and health?
22	MR. BRODY: Objection.
23	A. I probably agreed with some and probably had
24	nuanced disagreements with others. You know, my
25	role as the editor was not to put my imprimatur on
2	each essay written by independent scholars and —
3	saying I agree with everything written in every
4	essay. In fact, in that book, because the essays
5	are so, you know, intellectually wide-ranging,
6	there are probably some things by some authors in
7	the book that I don't completely agree with. My
8	own essay in the book I probably would stand by.
9	Q.	You're sure about that?
10	MR. BRODY: Objection.
11	A.	You may have it. You might have it, and I’d be
12	happy to read it with you and ask if I still agree
13	with the conclusions I drew at that time.
14	Q.	Well, why don’t I give you a copy of Professor
15	Gostin’s article in your book, which has been
16	marked Brandt 24?
17	(Gostin article marked Exhibit 24.)
18	Q.	Is that what’s in front of you?
19	A.	Yes.
20	Q.	And if you turn to — actually, if you turn to the
21	end of the article, it notes that you made some
22	contributions to the thinking in Mr. Gostin’s
23	paper.
24	MR. BRODY: Objection.
25	A.	Yes. Let me just see. Yes. These papers
2	originated from a conference. So, there was broad
3	discussion about the papers at the conference, and
4	I was the editor of the collection. So, you know,
5	I'm not surprised to see myself acknowledged, you
6	know, in this paper. So, yes, he did acknowledge
7	me.
8	Q.	Okay. Now, if you turn to Page 346 of the Gostin
9	article. Are you there?
10	A. Not yet. Now I'm on 346.
11	Q. Okay. You see that in the second paragraph he's
12	discussing the scientific work that's been done on
13	ETS.
14	A. Yes, I see that here.
15	Q. And he states — Mr. Gostin states that "The
16	scientific investigations that ensued purported to
17	be neutral assessments of the health consequences,
18	but they had significant design defects, were
19	based upon moral, as well as, scientific
20	assumptions, and had squarely in mind a set of
21	preconceived policies the investigators hoped the
22	research would support."
23	MR. BRODY: Objection.
24	A. Yes, that’s what it says there.
25	Q. And, certainly, there have been commentators who
2	have expressed the view that the scientific
3	investigations on environmental tobacco smoke
4	suffer from design defects?
5	MR. BRODY: Objection.
6	A.	Some people hold that position. I'm aware of
7	that.
8	Q.	And Mr. Gostin holds that position?
9	MR. BRODY: Objection.
10	A.	I think he's talking about a specific period of
11	time, but, apparently, at that time he did hold
12	that position.
13	Q.	And, also, certain commentators have concluded
14	that the environmental tobacco studies on disease
15	were done by researchers who had in mind a set of
16	preconceived policies that they hoped their
17	research would support?
18	MR. BRODY: Objection.
19	A.	I think some people hold that position.
20	Q.	And does Mr. Gostin state that position in his
21	article?
22	MR. BRODY: Objection.
23	A.	Yes, I think that’s, you know, I think that’s how
24	he puts it here. You know, I wouldn’t infer from
25	an acknowledgment that that’s my position.
2	Q.	But, certainly, there have been commentators who
3	are independent of the tobacco companies who have
4	expressed the view that the researchers conducting
5	scientific studies on environmental tobacco smoke
6	had in mind a preconceived outcome —
7	MR. BRODY: Objection.
8	Q.	-- in that research?
9	A.	I think there is much research with a preconceived
10	outcome. If it can be demonstrated that X causes
11	Y, this will lead to these policies. You know, to
12	say, well, you know, they do this work with a
13	preconceived outcome, you know, if we can
14	demonstrate that HIV causes AIDS, then there are
15	things we can do about it.
16	So, that’s a preconceived outcome. So,
17	you know, I just wouldn't want to take the
18	suggestion that preconceived outcome's in a piece
19	of research. We do most of our research with
20	certain hypotheses about if it comes out a certain
21	way, then certain actions are incumbent upon those
22	findings. So, you know —
23	Q.	Well, why don’t we turn to the next page.
24	A.	Yes.
25	Q.	147.
2	A.	Yeah.
3	Q.	Mr. Gostin —
4	A.	347?
5	Q.	347. Are you there?
6	A.	Yes.
7	Q.	Mr. Gostin concludes that, "The scientific
8	conclusions reached in the Surgeon General’s
9	Report on involuntary smoking appeared less
10	rigorous than in previous reports."
11	A. Yes, that was his conclusion.
12	Q. And there have been commentators who have
13	critiqued the 1986 Surgeon General's Report as
14	being less rigorous than prior reports?
15	A. Apparently, Gostin may be one of them. That’s,
16	you know — yes, I think there were critics of
17	that report.
18	Q. And, in fact, if you read down further, he
19	discusses the Surgeon General’s Reports, and says
20	that "Certain statements in the 1986 report seem
21	to be calculated to achieve a policy result
22	cloaked in the name of public health"?
23	MR. BRODY: Objection.
24	A. I haven't located that sentence. But if you read
25	it, I'm sure it’s correct.
2	Q.	Well, why don't you look at the second paragraph
3	at the end of it? Do you see that?
4	A.	At the end of the second paragraph? (Witness
5	reviews document.) The end of the second — the
6	second full paragraph?
7	Q.	Yeah.
8	A.	"The Surgeon General’s second conclusion was that
9	simple separation of smokers from nonsmokers
10	within the same air space," is that where you are?
11	I’m sorry, I'm being, you know, dense.
12	Q. That's okay. If you look at the bottom of the
13	second — first paragraph, it mentions that "The
14	report does not tell the reader — presumably
15	because the data do not support it — that such
16	indirect, intermittent exposure poses a health
17	problem."
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. And then Mr. Gostin stated that "The statement
20	seems calculated to achieve a policy result
21	cloaked in the name of public health."
22	MR. BRODY: Objection.
23	A. Yes, I think you have presented that accurately.
24	That's what that says.
25	Q. And, certainly, you'd agree, based on your review
2	of writings such as those by Mr. Gostin, that
3	there have been commentators, independent of the
4	tobacco companies, who have criticized the 1986
5	report, or at least statements in it, on the basis
6	that they’re aimed at achieving a policy result
7	cloaked in the name of public health?
8	MR. BRODY: Objection.
9	A. Yes, I would agree with that. I, you know —
10	Q. Then if we go to the next page.
11	A. Okay.
12	Q. 348. I think this is my last question about this
13	document, okay?
14	A. Yeah.
15	Q. You note that Doctor Brandt or Professor
16	Brandt cites opinion polls indicating that 90
17	percent of the public believe secondhand smoke is
18	harmful and —"
19	A. I think you mean Professor Gostin.
20	Q. Oh, sorry about that.
21	MR. BRODY: Why don't you start over.
22	Q. Okay. Do you see that Professor Gostin states
23	that "Opinion polls indicate that 90 percent of
24	the public believe secondhand smoke is harmful,
25	and 80 to 85 percent favors restrictions on
2	smoking in public places"?
3	A.	Yes, I see that.
4	Q.	And do you agree that there are public opinion
5	polls conducted in 1992 showing that 90 percent of
6	the public believe that secondhand smoking was
7	harmful?
8	MR. BRODY: Objection.
9	A.	Yes, I do believe that there were polls that
10	indicated that.
11	Q.	And, also, the vast majority of people favor
12	restrictions on smoking in public places?
13	MR. BRODY: Objection.
14	Q.	Is that true?
15	A.	I believe that there were polls that indicated
16	that.
17	Q.	Now, you recently reviewed Kessler's book on his
18	time at the FDA, which we just mentioned, right?
19	A.	Yes, I did review it.
20	Q.	And why don’t I hand you a copy of your review,
21	marked Brandt Exhibit 25, which is entitled "The
22	Tobacco Wars: A Report From the Front." And
23	that’s your review of Kessler’s book, is that
24	right?
25	("The Tobacco Wars..." marked
2	Exhibit 25.)
3	A.	This is a copy of my review, which appeared in
4	Health Affairs.
5	Q.	And your review of Kessler's book — Kessler said
6	that he liked your review?
7	MR. BRODY: Objection.
8	A.	You know, I should be careful about how I
9	characterize it, because, you know, I sort of took
10	it as polite, you know, you know, I liked your
11	review in Health Affairs. We didn't get into any
12	discussion of my review. And it wouldn't surprise
13	me if he was disappointed in the review. I really
14	don’t know how he felt about the review.
15	Q.	Okay. Now, in your review, if you turn to the
16	last page —
17	A.	Yes.
18	Q.	— one thing you note that "Kessler did not
19	adequately assess the impressive role that tobacco
20	liability litigation has played in the overall
21	antismoking strategy."
22	MR. BRODY: Objection.
23	A.	I don't — I know I did say something hke that,
24	but I just — I’m looking for where it is. Can
25	you just show me quickly?
2	Q.	If you look on the last page at the top of the
3	first column.
4	A.	Yeah, okay.
5	Q.	Are you there?
6	A.	It says, "Finally, Kessler does not adequately
7	assess the impressive role that tobacco liability
8	litigation has played in the overall antitobacco
9	strategy." Jodi asked me to read a little bit
10	more slowly.
11	Q.	And in your view, has tobacco liability litigation
12	played an impressive role in the overall
13	antitobacco strategy?
14	A.	Yes. I would say that as I assess, you know,
15	public health in the, you know, last decade of the
16	20th Century, in some of the actions going on now,
17	that tobacco liability, you know, has been an
18	element of tobacco control, you know, that needs
19	to be noted in full assessment of the changing
20	perspectives and knowledge of tobacco and its
21	harms.
22	Q.	And, in fact, in your article you state that the
23	tobacco litigation, more than any other aspect of
24	the antitobacco crusade, has opened the doors
25	of a notoriously secret industry."
2	MR. BRODY: Objection.
3	Q.	Right?
4	A.	"It has been this litigation more than any other
5	aspect of the antitobacco crusade that has opened
6	the doors of a notoriously secret industry." Yes,
7	it says that here.
8	Q.	And do you still agree with that opinion?
9	A.	Yes, most certainly. I completely agree with
10	that.
11	Q.	And then later —
12	A.	I can just tell you why I think that that is so
13	true. When you go to these web sites that we were
14	talking about or you see all these internal
15	discussions about tobacco and its harms, as well
16	as the scientific research of the industry, my
17	assumption is that many of those things could not
18	have been known without the litigation. So, as an
19	historian, I know much more about tobacco as a
20	result of the litigation than would have been
21	characteristic of an industry which is unlikely to
22	share with me, in terms of my own investigations,
23	confidential materials.
24	MR. SMITH: Objection.
25	Q.	You’ve described tobacco litigation as part of an
2	antitobacco crusade, right?
3	A.	Technically, that is how this is characterized
4	here. Yes, I would just say yes.
5	Q.	And, also, you characterize Kessler as a
6	courageous combatant in the Tobacco Wars, right?
7	MR. BRODY: Objection.
8	A.	I do characterize him that way, I think.
9	Q.	And Kessler has advocated that the tobacco
10	companies be disbanded, is that true?
11	MR. BRODY: Objection.
12	A.	He has a kind of policy level recommendation at
13	the end of his book that, you know, that I raise
14	some questions about its, you know, relative
15	feasibility, I think.
16	Q.	In fact, you say that "Kessler's proposal that the
17	tobacco industry be disbanded is a call for
18	radical action."
19	A.	Yeah, I think it’s a, you know, given where
20	tobacco control is, I certainly think calling for
21	the, you know, disbanding of the industry is a
22	radical proposal.
23	Q.	And you attribute, in part, at least, Kessler’s
24	call for disbanding the tobacco industry as his
25	anger at the tobacco companies?
2	MR. BRODY: Objection.
3	A.	I just need to read it so that I know that --1
4	want to make sure you correctly characterized what
5	I said. (Witness reviews document.) I think
6	Kessler was angry at the industry. It says, "His
7	anger at the lengths the industry would go to
8	defect his initiative and their often sordid acts,
9	but, second, and most importantly, his obvious
10	passion for the public health goals of eliminating
11	smoking," that's what it says. That's my
12	position.
13	Q.	And you stand by your position that Kessler’s
14	angry at the tobacco industry?
15	MR. BRODY: Objection.
16	A.	He could tell you better than I, but I think he is
17	angry at the tobacco industry. He's a
18	pediatrician, very committed to children's health,
19	very concerned about adolescent smoking; and I
20	think he's angry at the industry. I think that's
21	accurate.
22	Q.	Haven’t you written articles advocating continued
23	tobacco litigation against the tobacco industry?
24	A.	I think that, you know, my previous answers at
25	least intimated my position, which is that tobacco
2	liability litigation has been one potentially
3	effective vehicle for potentially enhancing public
4	health. So, yes, I see that as one element of an
5	appropriate public health program, vis-a-vis
6	tobacco.
7	Q. And you’ve coauthored articles with lawyers such
8	as Mr. Gostin, advocating continued litigation
9	against the tobacco industry?
10	MR. BRODY: Objection.
11	A. Well, it advocates litigation as one potential
12	public health tool in a comprehensive and
13	effective antitobacco program.
14	Q. And isn’t it your view that the tobacco litigation
15	is an important means of regulating the tobacco
16	industry?
17	A. Yes, I believe that that's true.
18	Q. And I think you've also written that "Litigation
19	against the tobacco industry is an important
20	component of a comprehensive program for reducing
21	cigarette consumption," is that true?
22	A. I believe that that's true. I think, yes.
23	Q. Okay. And does this case play an important role
24	in your view about reducing cigarette consumption?
25	A. Yes, I mean, I think that that would be one
2	element, you know, of the case would be that, you
3	know, that if the industry is found to have
4	hability, then that could potentially be a
5	mechanism towards further reductions in smoking,
6	for sure.
7	Q.	Do you agree with Kessler's proposal that the
8	tobacco industry be disbanded?
9	A.	I haven't carefully evaluated it. I'm less
10	interested in sort of prospective proposals than
11	in sort of questions of their relative feasibility
12	and success in a very specific sociopolitical
13	context. So, in that sense, I haven't made that
14	proposal myself. I haven’t done the kind of
15	sociological and political analysis that would
16	tell me whether it's advisable or feasible or
17	likely to be the most successful mechanism for
18	reducing tobacco use. So, I just — I don't
19	really have a position on it, other than I think
20	when I read it in his book, I was impressed that
21	the feasibility issues might be quite significant;
22	and I think that -- and that led to my, you know,
23	potential skepticism about it.
24	Q. Well, do you think that the tobacco industry
25	should be forced to turn over all the profits
2	they've made on cigarettes?
3	MR. BRODY: Objection.
4	A. I don't know. I haven't evaluated it. I just —
5	I don't know the best strategy for enhancing
6	public health vis-a-vis the industry, and it’s
7	outside the area that I — that, you know, I’ve
8	focused in on my expert testimony.
9	Q. Haven't you characterized the tobacco industry as
10	a deviant industry?
11	A. Probably I have, you know.
12	Q. And haven't you also characterized the tobacco
13	industry as a rogue industry?
14	A. I remember using the term "rogue industry". I
15	think that both of those characterizations are
16	probably accurate in the history of American
17	business and industry. And I could explain why:
18	Finding that one's producing a product in which
19	there is considerable and then overwhelming
20	scientific evidence that it harms the consumers
21	who use it, then the question is what actions does
22	that industry take to protect its consumers from
23	those harms. And, given the pattern of
24	distortion, denial, and aggressive promotion in
25	the face of that evidence, sometimes to under-aged
2	kids, for me, that constituted the conclusion that
3	the industry had acted, you know, as a deviant and
4	rogue industry.
5	MR. SMITH: Objection.
6	Q.	Didn't you characterize the tobacco industry as a
7	rogue industry in an article you wrote in 2000?
8	MR. BRODY: Objection.
9	A.	I thought I just said that I characterized the
10	industry as a rogue industry, and I gave you an
11	explanation for why I did. I — so, I’m — I just
12	don’t get it. But, anyway.
13	Q.	Hasn’t your — haven’t your writings in which
14	you’ve advocated continued tobacco litigation been
15	criticized by members of the medical community?
16	MR. BRODY: Objection.
17	A.	Perhaps. I'm sure there are many critics of my
18	writings.
19	Q.	Well, maybe I’ll hand you what I've marked as
20	Brandt 26, which is a letter to the editor of the
21	Journal of the American Medical Association.
22	(Letter to the Editor, JAMA, 1992 marked
23	Exhibit 26.)
24	Q.	And if you’ll turn the page to the article or
25	letter to the editor, rather, by Doctor Priver,
2	P-r-i-v-e-r?
3	A.	Yes, I see that here.
4	Q.	Have you seen this letter to the editor before?
5	A.	I'm quite certain I saw it at the time. It's now,
6	you know, more than ten years old. But I have
7	some memory of the letter, yes.
8	Q.	And this letter relates to an article that you and
9	Professor Gostin had published in the Journal of
10	the American Medical Association?
11	A. Yes, it does.
12	Q. And the letter from Doctor Priver states, "I am
13	disappointed at Gostin and colleague's solution
14	for the tobacco menace in our country: More
15	litigation. As a physician strongly committed to
16	the elimination of tobacco from our society, I am
17	nevertheless appalled at the notion that smokers
18	diseases are the fault of someone other than
19	themselves." True?
20	MR. BRODY: Objection.
21	A. I don't know what you mean true? True, it says,
22	that, yes.
23	Q. And, certainly, there have been members of the
24	medical community who have criticized your call
25	for continued tobacco litigation, isn’t that true?
2	MR. BRODY: Objection.
3	A. Doctor Priver did. You know, this was the only
4	letter from a physician that criticized that. So,
5	I didn't receive additional correspondence from
6	JAMA showing that other doctors did. So, you
7	know, the conclusion I draw, how does one draw
8	conclusions? Doctor Priver was upset that we had
9	advocated more litigation. He's a critic of mine.
10	That's the inference I can draw from this
11	document.
12	Q. Did you ask the editors of the Journal of the
13	American Medical Association to provide you with
14	all the letters that were written to them relating
15	to your article?
16	A. My understanding is that it’s standard procedure
17	at JAMA — and you could check this; they're in
18	Chicago — that they provide all the letters to
19	authors that come in on a particular manuscript;
20	and then they make editorial decisions about their
21	publication. So, I wasn't aware of additional
22	letters from doctors expressing Doctor Priver's
23	view about our article.
24	MR. SMITH: How much time do we have
25	left? Because I might be towards the ends of my
2	questions.
3	MR. BRODY: You have enough.
4	MR. SMITH: Well, I’m just wondering how
5	much, if the court reporter could give us —
6	VIDEO OPERATOR: We've gone five hours
7	and four minutes so far.
8	MR. SMITH: So we have another
9	approximately two hours.
10	Q. Now, I think we mentioned yesterday that you were
11	involved in a video project that was sponsored by
12	the American Lung Association on the history of
13	tobacco.
14	MR. BRODY: Objection.
15	A. Yes, we discussed it.
16	Q. How did you become involved with that project?
17	A. I got a call from an independent documentary
18	filmmaker who said that she was making a film. At
19	that time, I don't know if she had funding from
20	the American Lung Association or not, but she said
21	she was making a film on the history of tobacco.
22	She had read some of my work on the history of
23	tobacco; and she asked me if I might agree to do
24	an on-camera interview for her documentary film.
25	And then — I forget — she may have sent me some
2	materials about the film or something like that.
3	You know, I periodically get requests hke that.
4	Q. And Stan Glantz was also involved in the video
5	project you worked on?
6	A. As I said, I didn’t know who else she was talking
7	to. I didn't, you know, I didn't evaluate sort of
8	who her sources were. I told her I would agree,
9	given the parameters of what she wanted to talk to
10	me about, to talk to her on camera.
11	Q. Did you look at the video once it was completed?
12	A. She did send me it once it was completed. She
13	didn’t send it to me for comments, you know, at an
14	edit — at a film editing stage. I only saw the
15	film when it was completed.
16	Q. And isn’t it true that in the American Lung
17	Association video you stated that cigarettes had
18	lost all social legitimacy?
19	MR. BRODY: Objection.
20	A. It’s possible that in a context I may have said
21	something hke that. I assume that you have a
22	transcript of the video — or you told me you had
23	actually watched it.
24	Q. I did watch it, but unfortunately, I don’t have a
25	transcript with me. But didn't you also state in
2	the video that consumers regard the tobacco
3	companies with skepticism?
4	MR. BRODY: Objection.
5	A. I may have said that. It does not sound
6	uncharacteristic of something I might have said,
7	but, you know, in a situation Like this, you know,
8	this is a legal proceeding; this is a deposition.
9	You know, now I'm taking your word for it from
10	your having viewed it and maybe taken notes. So,
11	you know, in a situation like that, my, you know,
12	my preference is to, you know, have the video and
13	take a look at it, or have a transcript; and then
14	I can answer your questions better.
15	But, you know, it certainly is possible
16	that I've talked about what I have characterized I
17	think in some of my writings as the
18	delegitimization of the tobacco industry.
19	Q. Well, today, just sitting here today, do you
20	believe that the cigarette has lost all social
21	legitimacy?
22	A. I don't think that’s exactly the way I would put
23	it today. You know, I mean, I've seen many people
24	smoking. I see, you know, a quarter of all
25	Americans continue to smoke regularly. So, I
2	don’t think it’s lost all social legitimacy. It
3	has become an increasingly stigmatized behavior --
4	and, in other places I have written — for which
5	we often blame individuals who smoke for that
6	behavior, and not take into account the full
7	engines of promotion, production, and economy
8	associated with the product.
9	Q. Well, in your view has the cigarette been
10	delegitimized?
11	MR. BRODY: Objection.
12	A. In my view, in certain respects the cigarette has
13	been delegitimized. And I hesitate, for example,
14	to take a statement from an edited video and
15	expect that it reflects the full perspective of my
16	opinion on what I consider to be an important
17	historical and sociological issue, the relative
18	social standing of smoking and smokers and the
19	product and the industry, all of which I partially
20	address in my expert testimony and continue to be
21	an area of investigation and research for me.
22	Q. Well, putting the video aside for the moment,
23	okay?
24	A. Sure.
25	Q. Sitting here today, your opinion is that the
2	cigarette has been delegitimized?
3	MR. BRODY: Objection.
4	A.	I beheve I have attempted to answer that
5	question, and my answer is in certain respects it
6	has been delegitimized. But, of course, it
7	remains, you know, a legal product that many
8	people use. And, so, it has continuing
9	significance in American society and culture,
10	despite the fact that in many ways, as a behavior,
11	it has come to be stigmatized in some ways.
12	That's my answer.
13	Q.	Why don’t I mark as the next exhibit Brandt 27,
14	which I'm handing to you, which is a copy of an
15	article written by Mark Parascandola. Are you
16	familiar with him?
17	A.	I am familiar with him.
18	Q.	And do you regard him as an expert on smoking and
19	health?
20	A.	I understand that he’s been doing some
21	investigations on smoking and health.
22	(Parascandola article marked
23	Exhibit 27.)
24	A.	I think he has some expertise.
25	Q.	And you've reviewed the Parascandola article?
2	A.	This one here that you just handed me?
3	Q.	Yes.
4	A.	I have read this in the past.
5	Q.	And if you'd look at the acknowledgments, didn't
6	you provide comments on the Parascandola article?
7	A.	Yes, I did.
8	Q.	Do you remember providing those comments?
9	A.	I do, because I first heard this paper delivered
10	at a conference, and I disagreed with a number of
11	its conclusions. And this was a, you know, young
12	historian of medicine, I think, who had recently
13	finished his Ph.D.; and at the conference, I, you
14	know, after he had presented the paper, I raised
15	some questions -- if my memory serves me
16	correctly — about the piece. And I think he sent
17	it to me. And I may have either spoken to him on
18	the phone or put some comments on it and sent it
19	back to him at the time.
20	I have — there are some things about
21	this piece — I have to read it more carefully
22	and, you know, show you. But there were things
23	about it that I just didn't really agree with in
24	terms of his interpretation of the character of
25	epidemiological science at mid century.
2	Q.	Mark Parascandola, though, he works for the
3	National Institute of Health?
4	A.	I think he's been, like, a postdoctoral fellow
5	there. What —
6	Q.	Turn back to the acknowledgment section.
7	A.	Yes. That's what it says. It says he is the
8	Stotten Memorial Fellow, which is a postdoctoral
9	fellowship that they give to historians at NIH. I
10	don’t know whether technically that makes you like
11	a, you know, federal employee. I mean, he’s a
12	fellow there, and it’s a — I think it was a, you
13	know, it was a short-term fellowship. And now I
14	don’t know. I think he still is at NIH in some
15	capacity.
16	Q.	And Public Health Reports, who puts out that
17	publication?
18	A.	I think that the American Public Health
19	Association puts it out. But that would not be
20	difficult to check. I don’t know whether Public
21	Health Reports is a peer-reviewed publication or
22	not. Do you know?
23	Q.	How did you come to know about Mr. Parascandola?
24	A.	I heard his paper at the conference. That's when
25	I became familiar with his work.
2	Q.	And what conference was this?
3	A.	This was the American Association for the History
4	of Medicine. I don't remember which year, but I'm
5	pretty sure it was the year it was held in
6	Williamsburg, Virginia. So, well, we could check
7	and see what year it was.
8	Q.	Is Mark Parascandola related to John Parascandola?
9	A.	My understanding is that Mark Parascandola is John
10	Parascandola’s son.
11	Q. Okay. And John Parascandola, do you know whether
12	he’s been named as a witness in this case at
13	all -
14	MR. BRODY: Objection.
15	A. I just don’t know.
16	Q. Have you done anything to look at the use of
17	epidemiology in contexts outside of tobacco?
18	A. Yes, I have some knowledge of the use of
19	epidemiologic techniques in a variety of areas of
20	medicine. The thing is, and I don't know if this
21	exactly disagrees with Parascandola — it’s not
22	really in that context — but I'm impressed by how
23	densely utilized epidemiological knowledge and
24	techniques are in contemporary biomedicin. So,
25	rather than seeing epidemiology as a marginal
2	science, my own interpretive framework for the
3	second half of the 20th Century would be how
4	significant it turned out to have the utilization
5	of certain kinds of epidemiological techniques in
6	our contemporary biomedicine. And, so, there’s
7	Literally not a thing that happens in contemporary
8	biomedical practice — or hardly a thing — in
9	which a physician hasn't, in some degree or the
10	public as patients, haven't, in some degree,
11	relied on strategies of epidemiological
12	evaluation.
13	The FDA requires randomized clinical
14	trials to assess the medications that are then
15	approved in that regulatory process. And all of
16	that utilizes techniques that were really
17	developed by Dahl and Hill and others in terms of
18	inference, knowledge, efficacy. Most of what we
19	know about health policy is utilizing
20	epidemiological techniques. So, rather than
21	seeing it as somehow marginal, you know, I mean,
22	the real story is just how significant those
23	strategies became in defining how we know what we
24	know had in modern medicine.
25	Q. Are there any instances where scientists, using
2	epidemiological evidence, stated that a substance
3	caused certain disease, and then later found out
4	that it didn't?
5	MR. BRODY: Objection.
6	A.	I don't know what you have in mind. I'm —it's
7	possible. I just don't know.
8	Q.	All right. I hand you a copy marked as Brandt 28
9	of an article by Carl Battig, B-a-t-t-i-g,
10	entitled, "Nicotinic and Nonnicotinic Aspects of
11	Smoking Motivation and Behavioral Effects."
12	(Battig article marked Exhibit 28.)
13	A. Yes, I see that here.
14	Q. And that's what’s in front of you?
15	A. Yeah. Let me turn to the article itself.
16	Q. And the article appears in a book that’s a
17	collection of different articles on various
18	substances, is that correct?
19	A. It’s the first time I’ve seen it, but it looks
20	like it focuses on nicotine and then coffee and
21	caffeine. So, those are the two substances
22	discussed.
23	Q. And the Battig article is dated 1998, is that
24	accurate?
25	A. It has a section on social drinking, also. The
2	book looks like it appeared in 98, yes.
3	Q.	Have you ever seen this Battig article on
4	nicotine?
5	A.	No, I haven't, and the government didn't provide
6	it to me.
7	MR. BRODY: Great. Are we done?
8	Q.	If you —
9	A.	I'm sorry.
10	Q.	If you turn to Page 110 of the Battig article.
11	A.	Yes, I'm on Page 110.
12	Q.	And if you’d look at the last paragraph there, it
13	discusses whether smoking should be labeled as a
14	habit or addiction.
15	A.	The last paragraph here where it states
16	"Nevertheless"?
17	Q.	You see that the Battig article states that "It's
18	still a controversial issue as to whether smoking
19	should be considered as an addiction rather than
20	as a, perhaps, strong habit."
21	MR. BRODY: Objection.
22	A.	Yes, I see that. It says that that’s, you know,
23	apparently Battig’s position that it still is a
24	controversial issue.
25	Q.	And, certainly, there are commentators independent
2	of the tobacco industry who have taken the view
3	that whether smoking's an addiction is
4	controversial?
5	MR. BRODY: Objection.
6	A.	I'm sure there are some commentators who have
7	taken that position.
8	Q.	And he discusses that there is an issue of
9	psychopharmacology devoted to discussing whether
10	smoking was a habit or an addiction; and it was
11	part of an international symposium on nicotine?
12	MR. BRODY: Objection.
13	A.	I'm reading along here. You know, that's what he
14	says.
15	Q.	Doesn't Battig indicate that there’s no
16	generally-accepted definition of addiction?
17	MR. BRODY: Objection.
18	A.	I don't agree with Battig’s characterization of
19	this. I think there are some generally accepted
20	definitions of addiction. They’re applied in the
21	American Psychiatric Association's DSMs, and there
22	are textbooks that, you know, are quite explicit
23	about how they are defining addiction, both at the
24	sociobehavioral and at the, you know,
25	pharmacokinetic neurologic level. So, generally
2	they have to do with dependence, tolerance, and
3	withdrawal.
4	I know that the DSM, the most recent
5	version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
6	of the American Psychiatric Association, doesn't
7	use the term "addiction". It uses the term
8	"dependence," the term it would use for heroin or
9	any substance. You know, what is the substance?
10	Is there dependence? They define nicotine in that
11	way, as they would other substances for which
12	people develop dependencies, have difficulty with
13	withdrawal, and, also, begin to develop tolerance
14	for the particular substance.
15	So, you know, I don’t know who Carl
16	Battig is, but, you know, I certainly wouldn't
17	take the position expressed here as one that is
18	definitive.
19	Q. Would you fault the tobacco companies for calling
20	smoking a dependence rather than an addiction?
21	MR. BRODY: Objection.
22	A. I don't believe I've done that. The real issue is
23	the explicit understanding that they've been able
24	to assist the medical profession, the scientific
25	community, and the public with the characteristics
2	of the utilization of their product, which, you
3	know, we could debate whether to use the term
4	"dependence" or "addiction". But, clearly, the
5	industry had very considerable evidence about the
6	properties of tobacco. And they understood this
7	issue of dependence and withdrawal in fairly
8	sophisticated ways at fairly early periods in the
9	investigation of the product.
10	MR. SMITH: Objection.
11	Q.	Would you agree that there are scientists
12	independent of the tobacco industry that have
13	stated that there’s no accepted definition of
14	addiction?
15	MR. BRODY: Objection.
16	A.	Apparently, that's Carl Battig’s position. So, in
17	that sense, there must be people who hold that
18	position. You've demonstrated that.
19	Q.	Now, in your work in preparing for this testimony,
20	are there any people you've discussed any aspect
21	of tobacco with since you’ve been working on the
22	DOJ case that we haven’t mentioned yet?
23	MR. BRODY: Objection.
24	A.	As I said, I have discussed my testimony quite
25	openly with colleagues. So, in order to have a
2	full list of all the names of people who I
3	consulted, I couldn't say that we discussed all
4	the names yesterday. I have a colleague at the
5	Harvard School of Public Health, Matthew Miller,
6	who I discussed my testimony with. I don’t think
7	I mentioned his name yesterday.
8	Many people in my respective faculties,
9	my colleagues, knew that I had agreed to serve as
10	an expert witness and intended to testify. I've
11	discussed it with my students, my doctoral
12	students that I’m participating in this case. I
13	haven’t thought about drawing up a list of names
14	of people I discussed it with. It’s common public
15	knowledge. I assume that participation in a
16	proceeding like this is a public -- is going to be
17	very public. So I told people, you know, I'm
18	doing this work.
19	I put a good amount of time and energy
20	and professional effort into it, and I’ve been
21	discussing it. I've been quite preoccupied in
22	some ways by the idea, especially since I have not
23	participated in legal actions like this ever
24	before in my life. It's been, you know, it's been
25	a subject of, you know, real attention for me.
2	And I’ve been quite open about it. You know, in
3	terms of issues you've raised about disclosure,
4	you know, I plan to tell people I'm doing this.
5	You know, so, I don't know that I mentioned
6	everybody; and I think it would be difficult,
7	because, you know, people would call me on the
8	phone and say, you know, What are you up to? And
9	I would say, I've agreed to become an expert
10	witness for the Department of Justice's case
11	against the tobacco company. And they'd say, you
12	know, What kinds of issues are you working on?
13	And I'd tell them. You know, I have a lot of
14	friends and colleagues, and most of them probably
15	know that I'm doing this.
16	Q. Have you discussed your testimony specifically
17	with Julius Richmond or not?
18	A. I did tell him that I was testifying. And I
19	didn’t discuss it in any great detail, and haven't
20	had an occasion to. But Julius Richmond is one of
21	my closest colleagues. You know, when he's in the
22	office, I see him on a regular basis. I’ve been
23	certainly very aware of the legal actions that
24	he’s been involved in. He's been one of my
25	academic mentors at Harvard. You know, he's
2	followed my work closely. We've had an
3	opportunity to collaborate on occasion. I've been
4	involved in things, like a kind of Fetschrift
5	celebration of Richmond's career. So, he's a very
6	close personal friend, in addition to a colleague
7	of mine. And, so I explained to him what the
8	Department of Justice had asked me to do in terms
9	of expert work. I knew he was familiar with doing
10	expert testimony in tobacco litigation; that he
11	would understand what some of the issues were.
12	So, I did discuss it with him.
13	Q. And is Doctor Proctor also one of your friends?
14	A. Doctor Proctor is a friend. I know him
15	considerably less well than I do, for example,
16	Doctor Richmond, who I’ve seen regularly over a
17	number of years. But certainly Robert Proctor has
18	been a friend of mine over — I think I told you I
19	first met him probably in 1982 -- so a 20-year
20	period.
21	There would be some years where I might
22	talk to Robert Proctor two times a year, and, you
23	know, as we both became experts, I talked to him
24	just slightly somewhat more frequently this year.
25	You know, I spoke to him about this. But, so, you
2	know, he’s a colleague and a friend, yes.
3	Q. Do you want to take a break, and then maybe I can
4	look at my notes, and see if I have any other
5	questions?
6	A. Sure. That would be fine.
7	VIDEO OPERATOR: The time is 4:02. We
8	are off the record.
9	(Discussion off the record.)
10	VIDEO OPERATOR: The time is 4:16. We
11	are recording and on the record.
12	Q. Doctor Brandt, are there any tobacco-related
13	activities you’ve engaged in that we haven't
14	discussed today?
15	A. I think that we've discussed the tobacco-related
16	activities that I'm engaged in. There are
17	different kinds of study groups, things like that
18	that go on. You know, when you asked the
19	question, it occurs to me there's an ongoing study
20	group that goes on at Harvard on tobacco-related
21	issues. I sometimes get to their meetings, and,
22	you know, people will come talk about, you know,
23	work they’re doing in a clinical cessation
24	program, things like that.
25	So, I try to get to those talks, because
2	I've learned a lot from different people, either
3	who are in the local community, or are visiting
4	Harvard who are, you know, tobacco researchers or
5	things like that.
6	But in terms of organized tobacco
7	activity, I think you have an accurate picture of
8	sort of where my work has fit. And I don’t think
9	that there's anything that we haven't mentioned.
10	Q. Who are participants in the study group at Harvard
11	on tobacco?
12	A. I think that it’s administered by a physician
13	named Graham Colditz, C-o-l-d-i-t-z. And I don't
14	know whether he has a grant or what he does. You
15	know, sometimes they serve dinner, sometimes they
16	don’t. And, you know, there’s a pub he health
17	doctoral student who sends out the notices saying
18	when they're going to be meeting. I occasionally
19	get to them, but not as much as I'd like to.
20	Q. Other than Mr. Colditz, who else participates in
21	the Harvard study group on tobacco?
22	MR. BRODY: Objection.
23	A. It’s Doctor Colditz. And other than him, there
24	are some — I don't know all the people's names.
25	There are some — there is a researcher at the
2	Dana Farber Cancer Institute named Glorian
3	Sorensen, S-o-r-e-n-s-e-n, who I think has done
4	workplace cessation programs. And, so, sometimes
5	I've seen Doctor Sorensen at those meetings.
6	Sometimes Dick Daynard will show up for
7	those. They're publicly announced. Anybody can
8	go. And somebody will give a talk on, you know,
9	the effectiveness of the cessation program.
10	There’s an internist at the Mass. General Hospital
11	named Nancy Rigotti, and I've seen Nancy there.
12	She’s done work on smoking cessation. I think she
13	did a study of a Massachusetts state smokers
14	quitter's hotline. I know she was interested in
15	that. So, that would be characteristic of those
16	meetings.
17	Q. Other than the Harvard study group, are there any
18	other study groups on tobacco you've been involved
19	in?
20	A. Yeah. I was involved in a project that the Robert
21	Wood Johnson Foundation had on international
22	tobacco policy, and that group met over a period
23	of a couple of years, I think, three times,
24	something hke that. And I think what the purpose
25	of that group was to make conclusions about —
2	make comparisons, you know, what’s going on in
3	terms of tobacco policy in Canada? What’s going
4	on in the UK? What's going on in Australia? And,
5	so, they invited people from those different
6	places to prepare papers, which they delivered at
7	that meeting. And the Robert Wood Johnson — was
8	interested in how many American health policy
9	analysts concerned about tobacco. You know,
10	Robert Wood Johnson has had a very active tobacco
11	granting program for studies in smoking cessation
12	and policy. And I think they were interested in a
13	specific question -- the RWJ is especially
14	interested in American health, even though there’s
15	some discussion about whether that should be how
16	their programs are circumscribed. And, so, they
17	were interested are there things to learn that
18	could be useful, for example, from the Canadian
19	packaging in terms of the US? And what are some
20	of the issues across different national cultures
21	and systems in terms of antitobacco policy?
22	Q. And who else participated in the Robert Wood
23	Johnson meetings you've attended?
24	A. Ronald Bayer directed that group, and a lawyer who
25	focuses on legal issues in Japan, Eric Feldman,
2	who is a professor now at the University of
3	Pennsylvania. Bayer’s at Columbia. Thomas Murray
4	participated in that group, the ethicist who you
5	mentioned yesterday. There's a philosopher from
6	the University of Virginia named John Arras, an
7	ethicist who participated; and then there was a
8	political scientist from Canada. I don't recall
9	her name offhand; and there was also a policy
10	analyst from Australia who came to the meeting.
11	So, there were people preparing papers. Ted
12	Marmor from Yale, who, I understand, has in some
13	litigation been a defendants'witness. He
14	participated in those meetings.
15	Q. How long do you think it will take you to collect
16	up your notes and drafts that you made in
17	conjunction with your work and the other things
18	we've discussed so that they can be provided to
19	us?
20	MR. BRODY: Objection. Any requests for
21	any sort of documents should come to counsel.
22	A. I don't know. I think, you know, if I had — I
23	haven’t had pen and paper, and I haven’t kept
24	track of the things that you wanted. And, you
25	know, if you let me know in some formal way, and,
2	you know, maybe the best way would be through Mr.
3	Brody.
4	Q. Yeah. We can send him a letter after we get the
5	transcript. Would that be okay?
6	A. That would be fine. And, then, in a timely way,
7	you know, I'll do my best to recover as best I
8	can — you know, given my own record management
9	system — the materials you've requested.
10	Q. Okay. Now, earlier yesterday I believe you
11	mentioned that you had one meeting with Russ
12	Kinner and then one initial meeting — was it with
13	Mr. Brody?
14	A. Yes, Mr. Kinner had come to see me, you know, I
15	think some time ago, And, you know, to discuss my
16	work and my interest in the case. And I can’t say
17	that I put him off, but I — at that time, you
18	know, didn't really — we didn't get into a
19	serious discussion about my possibly serving as a
20	witness. Then, when he came to see me again, I
21	was somewhat more flexible about the possibility
22	that I would consider; and at that point, I think
23	he suggested that it would be useful for me to
24	meet with Mr. Brody, who, sometime later, you
25	know, was going to be in Boston, and stopped by to
2	see me. So, I think that there were probably two
3	meetings with Kinner at some distant times apart
4	and then the subsequent meeting with Mr. Brody.
5	Q. Okay. And at the meeting with Mr. Brody, the
6	first one, what did you discuss?
7	MR. BRODY: Objection.
8	A. We discussed mostly my historical work. You know,
9	I think that I probably, you know, at that meeting
10	did 99 percent of the talking, because I'm always
11	eager to discuss my work, as some of my colleagues
12	know. And, so, I said, Let me tell you what I've
13	been doing in the tobacco history research area,
14	the kinds of materials I've utilized, some of the
15	conclusions that I had been arriving at, some of
16	my opinions. So, I told him what I had been
17	doing.
18	Q. And at that meeting with Mr. Brody, did you agree
19	there to testify on behalf of the US government,
20	or was that later?
21	A. No, it was later, because I'm very considered and
22	cautious about anything in my professional life;
23	and I certainly wouldn't make a decision like that
24	in a meeting like that. And I knew that it was a
25	big enough decision for me to decide to become an
2	expert witness in litigation that it was something
3	that I would have to consider, consult my family
4	about, you know, things like that. So, I did not
5	make that decision in that meeting.
6	Q.	And after your meeting with Mr. Brody, what
7	subsequent communications have you had with the
8	government lawyers?
9	MR. BRODY: Objection.
10	A. I think I described some of this yesterday, but
11	after that meeting with Mr. Brody, I think that we
12	probably had, you know, a phone conversation. He
13	explained to me, you know, that I might write him
14	a letter describing, you know, the areas that I
15	would focus in on in my expert work, which I
16	subsequently did; and then I think we, you know,
17	probably had one more phone conversation after
18	that.
19	And my next communication — my next —
20	you know, then I wrote the report. And I wrote
21	the report, you know, independently; and, you
22	know, did my work; and, you know, used the
23	documents and documents that I had, you know,
24	found in my research. And I wrote the report and
25	I sent it in. And I couldn't really anticipate
2	whether there would be questions about it or
3	things hke that. But the report I sent in at
4	that time is, you know, that's the report you
5	have.
6	Q.	And what did you discuss with Mr. Brody in your
7	second phone conversation?
8	A.	I think we discussed the scope of my report. You
9	know, what were my opinions? What would be the
10	scope of my testimony? Where should I focus my
11	attentions in thinking about, you know, the task
12	of becoming an expert and preparing an expert
13	statement -- also, something I had never done
14	before. So, I, you know, I think that that would
15	have been the focus of that phone call.
16	Q.	Did you discuss any substantive topics relating to
17	the backup?
18	A.	Well, I think in a sense that was substantive,
19	because it was, you know, questions about the, you
20	know, the degree I would focus in on my research
21	on the epidemiological findings of the '40s and
22	'50s, their scientific standing, the types of
23	criticisms that were raised, the origins of the
24	Tobacco Industry Research Council, and,
25	eventually, CTR and TI. So, you know, we probably
2	had a substantive conversation where I framed out,
3	in broad strokes, some of the areas that I was
4	prepared to offer expert testimony; and I think
5	that, you know, that was consistent with Mr.
6	Brody's perspective on areas where, you know, I
7	could be utilized as an expert in the case. And,
8	you know, and I went ahead and did the work.
9	Q. And did you discuss any of Mr. Proctor's opinions
10	in this case with Mr. Brody?
11	A. I did not, because, you know, at that time I don’t
12	know that I was clear that Mr. Proctor was going
13	to be a witness. And I did not discuss his work.
14	I was really focused on what I needed to do and
15	where my expertise could really be brought to bear
16	in an expert statement. So, I didn't discuss Mr.
17	Proctor with Mr. Brody at that time.
18	Q. Well, before you agreed to testify in this case,
19	did you know that Robert Proctor was going to be
20	testifying for the government?
21	A. If my memory serves me correctly, I believe that I
22	decided to be an expert witness without any
23	knowledge of whether Mr. Proctor would be one or
24	not. And I decided I would do it. And I decided
25	that I had done work that was, you know, very
2	consistent with issues that would be coming up in
3	the case. And, you know, as I say, you know, not
4	only was it considered, I had had offers to be
5	expert witnesses in the past. So, I had been
6	through a long process of thinking, Did I want to
7	bring my work to bear in this way? And I decided
8	to do it. And, you know, it was unrelated to what
9	Mr. Proctor would decide. I think that I only
10	later found out after I had come to an agreement
11	with Mr. Brody that, in fact, Mr. Proctor would
12	also be an expert historical witness.
13	Q. Did you find out that Doctor Proctor was going to
14	be a witness in this case before you submitted
15	your expert report?
16	A. Yes, I did.
17	Q. And did you have any discussions with Doctor
18	Proctor before you submitted your expert report?
19	A. We decided that we would not really discuss — I
20	had a conversation with him about, you know, his
21	decision to agree to be a witness. And he was
22	certainly aware that I had agreed to be. And,
23	then, we pretty much decided that we would not get
24	into any substantive discussions about the
25	substance of our report. So that we could go
2	ahead and do them, and, you know, the idea was we
3	neither wanted to check with each other or, you
4	know, there was no concern about potential
5	overlap. So, we just — we worked independently.
6	Q.	And, then, after your reports were done, did you
7	exchange copies of your reports with each other?
8	A.	Eventually, I did get Mr. Proctor’s report. I
9	eventually did. He eventually did send it to me
10	after the reports had been submitted to the court.
11	Q. And did you and Mr. Proctor have any discussions
12	about your reports with each other?
13	A. Yeah, I think we did have one phone conversation.
14	In retrospect, since we did the reports without
15	consultation with each other, I found it notable
16	that I had done my report without explicit
17	reference to Defendants' experts. And I just
18	decided, you know, as I got going, that even
19	though certainly my — certainly my report, I felt
20	extremely effectively rebutted the materials
21	presented by Professor Ludmerer and Professor
22	Enghsh and, to a degree — although I didn’t
23	attend to it as much in my report as I could
24	have — Professor Wilson. And then I came to
25	understand when I read Mr. Proctor’s report, that
2	he had directly addressed their expert reports in
3	his expert report that he would submit. And, so,
4	I think that some of our discussions centered on,
5	you know, those alternative, you know, strategies
6	for presenting an expert report.
7	Q. And at any time did Mr. Brody tell you that the
8	tobacco companies had noted that you hadn't
9	addressed any of the defense experts in your
10	report?
11	A. Mr. Brody never commented on — to me about
12	anything that, you know, anyone said about my
13	report. You know, I mean, Mr. Brody, I think told
14	me that the report was fine.
15	Q. And did you discuss your report, the contents of
16	it, with Mr. Brody after it was submitted?
17	A. We never had quite an extensive conversation. I
18	had spent a lot of time on this, and there was
19	this way that I would like to have discussed a lot
20	of details with Mr. Brody. But Mr. Brody let me
21	know that he thought the report was, you know,
22	appropriate and adequate. This is the way
23	historians like to get a lot of feedback. I only
24	got modest feedback. But, you know, I felt that I
25	had been able to successfully accomplish what I
2	had sought to do in the expert report, and that it
3	had been submitted and went to the court and went
4	to Defendants' counsel; and, you know, that was
5	that.
6	Q.	And after you —
7	A.	So-
8	Q.	Oh, are you done?
9	A.	Yes, I was essentially done.
10	Q.	After you submitted your expert report, what
11	communications did you have with the government
12	lawyers?
13	A.	I understood that it had gone to Defendants. I
14	had supplied the materials I had relied on in
15	producing the report. I had pulled together my
16	up-to-date curriculum vitae and the materials I
17	had published in the last ten years, and the next
18	communication was about scheduling the deposition.
19	And we went through a process of my offering dates
20	and back and forth, before we eventually came up
21	with these dates.
22	Q.	And then how many times did you communicate with
23	the US government lawyers after you submitted your
24	report?
25	A.	I would say not very much. You know, I think that
2	it was mostly in terms of the administrative
3	aspects of the, you know, setting the dates for
4	the deposition. And, you know, if my memory
5	serves me correctly, the report was submitted to
6	the court around May 10th. And, so, it went in,
7	and I worked very intensely on the report in the
8	period before its submission to the Department of
9	Justice; and it went to the court. And then I had
10	a brief sort of pause, and did some other work,
11	and we had communications about scheduling the
12	deposition. And I understood that, you know, this
13	summer one of the things I would be doing would be
14	the deposition. And I have both academic and
15	administrative responsibilities at Harvard and
16	family, so it was about finding dates where we
17	could do it.
18	So, we exchanged a few e-mails on that,
19	and eventually arrived at this date. But in terms
20	of substantive discussions about the case or my
21	testimony, we didn't do it, and I was quite busy
22	with other things. And, then, in this immediate
23	period, you know, Mr. Brody and I worked out a
24	time for him to come visit me, which he did — not
25	this past Monday, but I think a week ago Monday.
2	And, you know, we spent some time together talking
3	about, you know, how the deposition works, the
4	character of my arguments in the expert report;
5	and he said to me, I'll see you, you know, next
6	Thursday morning in Boston. And he sent me the
7	location of G&M Court Reporters by e-mail, and I
8	saw him yesterday morning. And the rest we’ve all
9	been here for.
10	Q. What specifically did you and Mr. Brody discuss
11	when you met to talk about your deposition?
12	MR. BRODY: Objection.
13	A. Well, as I think I explained, we talked about the
14	process of being deposed. He told me some of the
15	procedural aspects of the deposition, the fact
16	that there would be one or more lawyers who would
17	ask me a series of questions about my professional
18	training, my methods, my approach to doing
19	historical work, my personal biography in terms of
20	my training and faculty appointments and so on.
21	He explained to me the rules of the deposition in
22	which he could object, but he would not be
23	explaining his objections; that you could object,
24	but you would not be explaining your objections.
25	He explained to me that there was an order in the
2	case that we would not discuss any aspect of the
3	deposition during the period in which the
4	deposition was occurring. So, I knew these things
5	not quite two weeks ago, but at that time. So,
6	all these things he explained to me; and, you
7	know, I think he understood that I had never been
8	deposed before, so that I was certainly a novice
9	at depositions, and then we looked through my
10	statement together. And, you know, he asked me,
11	you know, how I would summarize my opinions, which
12	I did. It was very congenial.
13	Q.	And did Mr. Brody show you any documents other
14	than your expert report when you met with him?
15	A.	No. We saw no additional documents, other than I
16	think we looked through my CV together.
17	Q.	All right. And did he practice asking you
18	questions like I am today when you met with him?
19	A.	He did it a little bit differently than you do it.
20	Q.	How did he do it?
21	A.	You know, the questions were a little bit more
22	open-ended, I think, when Mr. Brody framed them.
23	And, so, but, you know, it was — you know, I
24	would say, you know, as we’re nearing the end of
25	this process today, that, you know, I felt that
2	Mr. Brody’s preparation with me was time well
3	spent in terms of my being able to anticipate what
4	a deposition is, never having been deposed before.
5	Q. Okay. Would it be fair to say that during your
6	deposition I showed you a number of documents
7	relating to areas of your testimony that you
8	hadn't seen before?
9	MR. BRODY: Objection.
10	A. Let me just think about that for a second. You
11	showed me, you know, we have as many as 27 — I
12	don’t know how many exhibits there were — 28
13	exhibits, I think; and some of those include my
14	writings and other historians' writings, some of
15	which I was familiar with. And then there were a
16	number of papers, you know. You handed them to
17	me. So, you would know the number, as opposed to
18	my knowing the number, that I had not seen in my
19	research. But we could specify the exact number
20	that are here. And, so, I think that there are
21	probably, you know, 10 or 12 medical publications
22	that you showed me that I had not consulted in
23	preparing my expert statement.
24	Q. Have we covered all of the areas of your testimony
25	that you plan to give?
2	MR. BRODY: Objection.
3	A. I don't know how to exactly evaluate a question
4	like that. You know, it’s a little bit like
5	asking me, Have you been thorough in reviewing my
6	statement and my opinions? You know, I’ve been
7	studying the history of cigarette smoking in the
8	United States. I've offered expert opinions,
9	especially focused on the rising knowledge within
10	the scientific and medical communities about the
11	harms of smoking, the reaction of the industry,
12	you know, to that knowledge, the actions of the
13	industry to distort and deny what had become
14	consequential scientific knowledge at a crucial
15	point in time for American consumers who used
16	their product, and their continued aggressive
17	marketing of that product, sometimes in ways that
18	I deemed deceptive in terms of the way the product
19	was promoted.
20	So, I think we've covered a lot of those
21	areas, and, you know, I think that you have
22	questioned me about my opinions that I’ve offered
23	as an expert.
24	Q. Okay. I think that's pretty much it for now.
25	A. Okay.
2	Q. Is there anything you’d like to add?
3	MR. BRODY: Objection.
4	A. No. There’s nothing I’d like to add at this time.
5	Q. Okay.
6	MR. BRODY: Cindy, do you have any
7	questions?
8	MS. GANTNIER: I don't. Thank you.
9	MR. BRODY: The United States has no
10	questions. Doctor Brandt will read and sign.
11	VIDEO OPERATOR: Anything further?
12	MR. BRODY: That's it.
13	VIDEO OPERATOR: The time is 4:42. That
14	concludes today's deposition. That's the end of
15	Cassette No. 3, and we’re off the record.
16	(Whereupon the deposition ended at
17	4:42 p.m.)
