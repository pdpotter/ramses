THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're on the record at 9:15. Today's date is December 20,
2002. This is deposition of Dr. Peter English taken in the matter of Willard R. Brown and Robert Dougherty on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated versus the American Tobacco Company, Inc., et al, in the Superior Court in the State of California, the County of San Diego, number JCCP 4042.
This deposition is being held at 2530 Meridian Parkway, Durham, North Carolina.
My name is Donald Graves, the court reporter is Sydney Silva; we're with Huseby, Inc.
Will counsel introduce themselves for record, please.
MR. FINE: My name is Gary Fine of the firm of Rodham and Fine. I represent, along with my co-counsel here, the Plaintiffs, Robert -- Willard R. Brown, Robert Dougherty and the others similarly
situated.
MR. VERNON: My name is Keith Vernon.
I practice with the law firm of Climaco Lefkowitz; and I'm here today in the capacity as class counsel for the Brown class.
MR. ROSENTHAL: My name is James Rosenthal from the law firm of Arnold & Porter, and I represent Philip Morris in the case.
MS. FRANKEL: I'm Gusti Frankel,
Womble Carlyle Sandridge & Rice, and I represent R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company .
MR. E-’OGARTY: Brian Fogarty from Gray Cary Ware & Freidenrich, on behalf of Lorillard Tobacco.
MS. MOORE: Kellie Ann Moore, from Sedgwick Detert Moran & Arnold, representing the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporat ion.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Before we get started I just want to make a couple statements for the record.
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Should I have her swear in the witness?
MR. ROSENTHAL: It's not relevant to the testimony. We might as well just do this first.
First is I understand this morning there was a little off-the-record confusion about who ordered the videographer. Our position is, you know, obviously, the Plaintiffs have the right to have it videotaped if they want to. You know, if it comes down to us it would be our choice not to videotape it. We're understanding it is being videotaped right now at their request. And the other -MR. FINE: Okay. Actually, it is my understanding after reading the worksheet that Patrick Cafferty -- and we can clear this up later -- is the one who ordered the videographer. We'll clear it up later. It really has nothing to do with the taking of Dr. English's deposition.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Fair enough. I mean, I'm not in a position to comment right now to whether Pat ordered it or not ordered it. Right now I have the authority to say that, you know, my client, if it is our
choice, does not want it videotaped. If we're proceeding with it videotaped it's on your request. If you want it videotaped, that's f ine.
MR. FINE: Well, then I think you ought call Pat Cafferty. Isn't he your co-counsel? I mean, to call the gentleman here under Pat Cafferty's request and then say, well, we don't want him anymore.
MR. ROSENTHAL: That's right, I don't want him. If you guys want it videotaped, that's fine.
MR. FINE: We'll work it out later.
MS. MOORE: Okay.
MR. FINE: Anything else?
MR. ROSENTHAL: The only other thing I would ask just clarify under California law all objections except to objection to form are preserved.
MR. FINE: That's correct.
MR. ROSENTHAL: That's great.
MR. DAVIS: Okay.
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Will the court reporter please swear in the witness.
whereupon, PETER ENGLISH, MD, Ph.D., having been duly sworn, was examined and tesstified as follows:
EXAMINATION
BY MR. FINE:
Q. Dr. English, my name is Gary Fine.
You have just been sworn in the case filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Diego, Brown and Dougherty versus Tobacco Company, et al. And I am showing you -I'm sorry.
Please identify yourself for the
record.
A. My name is Peter English.
Q. Would you please spell your last name? A. E-N-G-L-I-S-H.
Q. All right, let's get back to this. I am showing you Plaintiff's Exhibit 3284, which is a notice of taking your deposition. Do you guys want to see a copy of this?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Sure, why not? Thank you very much.
Q. Doctor, did you receive a copy of that notice of taking deposition?
A. This is the first time I have, I have
seen this particular document.
Q. Had you been given information that your deposition was to be taken today -A. Yes.
Q. -- pursuant to a deposition notice?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And just so we're clear, the deposition notice indicates that we were to do this at the Doubletree Hotel and at Defendants' request we have changed that about 2 00 yards down the road at counsel's office?
MR. ROSENTHAL: We appreciate it.
MR. FINE: No problem.
Q. Doctor, what's your present employment?
A. I work for Duke University in two capacities; I'm a Professor of History in the College of Arts and Sciences and I'm a Professor of Pediatrics in the Medical School. In that capacity I both teach and see patients in a primary care pediatric practice.
Q. I have a copy here -- do you have a recent CV with you?
A. I do not.
MR. DAVIS: I have a copy of a CV I
would like marked, please.
(Deposition Exhibit No. 3285 marked for identification.)
Q. Dr. Elnglish, I have just handed you Exhibit No. 3 2 85. Would you take a second and go through that and see if that is an up-to-date resume curriculum vitae of yourself?
A. It is not. I mean, the date in the lower right-hand corner of the first page says it was updated in July of '99 and so it is a couple years old.
Q. Okay. Why don't you tell me now what type of additions are necessary to bring this up to date.
A. I hope I can recall everything. At the very beginning, I have a new telephone number underneath the pediatric section that's 620-5374.
Since this was done, I have been promoted in the Department of Pediatrics and I have been promoted in the Department of History, so, you know, it would probably be best if I just got you an up-to-date CV rather than going through each line of this.
MR. FINE: Would counsel provide that to us?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Yes, actually, that's fine. Was this the CV that we provided with his disclosure? I would be surprised because this one is -MR. FINE: No. Because I looked through the reliance documents and I didn't see a CV in there.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Okay. My understanding was we provided a CV with the disclosure several months ago. But that's fine; I would be happy to provide you with the most recent CV.
MR. FINE: Okay.
MR. ROSENTHAL: They're always -MR. VERNON: I don't think so. But if they did, maybe we could get it this afternoon if it did occur?
MR. ROSENTHAL: That may not be possible. But we can still get it to you.
MR. VERNON: But I mean we can do that. If you are saying it was supplied with the disclosure, we probably have it; I didn't think there was.
BY MR. FINE:
Q. Doctor, do you have a present CV that
you've used at your office?
A. I have one on my computer.
Q. Would you be able to e-mail counsel here so we could have it in the afternoon or have your assistant e-mail it over here?
A. I don't have an assistant.
Q. Well, whoever is in the office?
A. This is the start of holiday season so there isn't anyone in the office, I'm afraid.
Q. Would you be able to e-mail it to your counsel when you get back to your office?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay, thank you.
MR. ROSENTHAL: And we'll get that to
you.
A. But I think counsel already has a recent copy of it; just unfortunately I don't have it with me at the moment.
Q. Doctor, have you ever testified before under oath?
A. Yes, I have.
Q. Okay. Let me just give you some of the rules that I would request that you follow.
Firstly, all responses need to be verbal in nature, yes, no, use words instead of
uh-huh or the words sure, yeah, things like that. That's subject to interpretation and we would be fighting about that somewhere along the line whether you said yes or no. Is that clear?
A. It is.
Q. Thank you. All questions that I ask you, I request that you understand before you answer. If you don't understand my question -- and lawyers sometimes confuse language pretty well -just say, "I don't; understand," and ask me to repeat the question or ask me to rephrase the question. Is that also clear?
A. That is clear.
Q. Okay. So we will understand if you answer the question you understood the question fully.
MR. ROSENTHAL: You might want to provide a verbal response.
A. Yes.
MR. ROSENTHAL: You're already slipping on these.
Q. Yes, verbal response.
A. Yes. I hear what you are saying.
Q. Okay. We do have a videographer here right now so they will take down head nods, but I
don't want to get into that.
Finally, if we get to the end of the deposition -- at some point we'll get to the end of the deposition. If you wish to supplement any of the questions -- any of the answers you have given, feel free to say, "I just remembered," or, "I wish to supplement", or, "I want to add these particular facts to this particular answer"; otherwise, we will consider that your answer is full and complete as given. All right?
A. I understand that.
Q. Okay, thank you.
Now you said you had testified previously. What type of cases have you testified previously?
A. I have testified in a number of child abuse cases on behalf of children. I have testified in court in one tobacco trial; and that was a Blue Cross case in Brooklyn a couple years ago.
Q. And have you given deposition testimony in any cases?
A. Yes, I have.
Q. Okay. Besides the Blue Cross case and the child abuse cases, what cases have you given
deposition testimony?
A. I have given depositions in the Blue Cross case; in the case in Los Angeles, the Bullock case.
Q. Can you spell that for me, please?
A. B-U-L-L-O-C-K. And I have given a deposition in the Department of Justice case. And I have given a deposition in Miles.
Q. And what state was Miles?
A. Miles is in Illinois.
Q. Miles versus whom?
A. Philip Morris.
Q. Philip Morris. And who were you an expert witness for in that case?
A. Philip Morris.
Q. The Blue Cross case that you testified to in New York, what's the proper name of the case? What was the caption, if you can recall?
A. I don't recall.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I can help you out on
that.
MR. FINE: Okay.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I think first
Plaintiff was Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
New Jersey versus and I can't remember who
the first Defendant would have been. It varied sometimes? they go alphabetical, sometimes they don't. But it is Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey.
Q. Okay. Have you ever provided an affidavit as an expert witness in any cases that we haven't previously discussed?
A. I have provided -- I have had expert disclosures, I don't know whether that is the same as an affidavit.
Q. Well, it depends on the state. We'll go along with your definition of expert disclosures.
A. Wellf expert reports. I had one with the Blue Cross; I had one with DOJ, the Department of Justice case; and I had one with Miles.
Q. Anything else you can recollect?
A. That's, that's all.
Q. Didn't you file one in New York versus Lead Industries?
A. Oh, I thought we were keeping this to tobacco cases.
Q. Well, we have been talking about from child abuse cases, I, through tobacco cases. I had asked you about your submissions as an expert?
A. Okay, I'm sorry, I misunderstood you.
I had an expert report in the New York case in lead litigation. And that has been used I think in a couple -- several -- couple other, couple other cases as well, or at least parts of it has.
Q. Was that used in the case in Wisconsin, Milwaukee?
A. Parts of it I think have been used in a Milwaukee case, yes.
Q. And who did you -- who were you an expert witness for in that particular case?
A. Lead pigment manufacturers.
Q. And who were the attorneys who employed you or retained you in that case?
A. By name or by firm?
Q. By firm.
A. Arnold & Porter.
Q. Okay. Have you done any other work for Arnold & Porter besides these -- the cases that you have just advised us about?
A. In the lead pigment litigation, there are a number of other cases that I have been involved with in addition to the Milwaukee case and the New York City case.
Q. Can you list those cases for me,
please?
A. I don't know if I -- I can tell you the names in, in many of them. I am involved in the Rhode Island case. I have been involved in one or two in the City of Baltimore.
Q. In fact, didn't they use your affidavit from New York in the City of Baltimore case?
A. Probably.
Q. Yes.
A. I think there has been a case involving -- well, there may be additional cases, I can't remember.
Q. Would you have a list of those cases at your office?
A. No.
Q. And who would have a list of those cases that you are involved with?
A. Bill Curtis.
Q. He works at Arnold & Porter?
A. In the New York office.
Q. How did it come to Arnold & Porter's attention that you may be able to provide expert testimony in lead cases?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. Q. You may answer.
A. I had worked with Arnold & Porter initially on tobacco cases in the late 1980s for a couple years; and I believe that one or more of the attorneys that had worked with in the tobacco litigation in the late '80s made a suggestion to other attorneys who were working with the lead pigment litigation that I, I might be able to do some research for them.
MS. FRANKEL: Can I interject? Can we agree that an objection by Mr. Rosenthal is an objection for the other Defendants as well ?
MR. FINE: Agreed.
Q. What about these cases in the '80s, these tobacco cases, what type of services did you provide Arnold & Porter?
A. I did historical research on the knowledge about the dangers of smoking and health and the public health community's response up through the issuing of the first Surgeon General's report in 1964.
Q. And what were the names of those cases that you worked on?
A. The only case that I remember by name is Haynes.
Q. And what state would that have been
in?
A. I don't know.
Q. And who was the counsel who was your contact person at Arnold & Porter?
A. Murray Garnick.
MR. ROSENTHAL: G-A-R-N-I-C-K.
Q. And there were other cases other than the one you just told us about; is that correct?
A. Well,, I didn't, I gave no depositions in, in the, stemming from that particular research and there were no cases that I, that I testified in court.
Q. To your knowledge, was your work product ever produced to the Plaintiffs in those cases?
A. I believe in the Haynes case there was a brief expert disclosure; but that's getting back 12 years ago, so I'm not entirely certain of that.
Q. Well, 12 years ago would be 1990. You said it was some time in the '80s that you started, sir?
A. Right. And at the very end of that
period of time when I was doing research there was some question of whether I was going to be involved in the Haynes case. And so I think there may have been expert disclosure; but to be quite honest, I can't, I know there was discussion of it, I don't know whether it was filed.
Q. What state would that have been in,
sir?
A. I don't know.
Q. Okay.. Did you have to travel to New York to chat with counsel?
A. Well, I never traveled to New York to talk about tobacco. But I, you mean talking about --
Q. In the Haynes case, sir.
A. In the Haynes? No, no. The attorneys I was working with were in Washington, DC, and I did travel to Washington, DC to speak with them.
Q. Okay. Do you know how your name came to the attention of Arnold & Porter in the early '80s -- the mid '80s or late '80s?
A. I don't know how that happened.
Q. Would it have anything to do with the fact that you work at Duke University?
A. It may well have. I'm also a member of the American Association for the History of Medicine; and it could be that being a member of that organization brought my name to the attention. I don't know.
Q. Duke University receives a variety of grants from RJR and other tobacco entities, does it not?
MS. FRANKEL: Objection. Objection to
the form.
A. I'm not sure what financial relations exists currently between Duke University and, and tobacco companies. I do know that I would probably say with the name of Duke that the university was founded on the bequest of the Duke family and their money was made from tobacco as well as Duke Power. And - -
Q. James Buchannon Duke is the one who changed it from Trinity College over to Duke University, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. He's the one who gave the money?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. They have also funded the university through the years, so far as you know?
A. That I'm not sure with. I mean, the Duke Endowment has funded the university in some respects and the Duke -Endowment money comes largely from Duke Power as well as tobacco. But to be quite honest, I don't know the relation.
I do know a number of professorships in the university that I'm aware of that are R.J. Reynolds professorships that come from that.
Liggett St Myers gave money to support the pediatric intensive care unit. I mean, there's been -- there have been a number but I just can't enumerate anything more specifically or what percent of the university's operating budget comes from that.
Q. I understand. You presently, at least according to the CV that we reviewed, a Josiah Charles Trent Associate Professor?
A. I was. That was an Associate Professorship that when I was promoted I was promoted out of eligibility because it is just for an Associate Professor. When I got to be a full professor, that went to someone else.
Q. I see. Is that a funded by this Duke Endowment?
Q. Josiah Charles Trent?
A. No, no, it is not.
Q. Okay. Have there been any projects at all at your department that have been funded by the Duke Endowment?
A. Which department?
Q. The department that you presently work
in.
A. I work in two departments. I'm not sure. In the history department, there are Duke Endowment scholarships and fellowships for history graduate students. The Duke Endowment makes gifts to the university which includes the Medical Center annually. I'm sure some of those go to the Department of Pediatrics; I'm just not sure I can delineate beyond that.
Q. Okay. With Arnold & Porter, what was your rate when you did research for them back on the Haynes case, do you recollect?
A. It was $2 50 an hour.
Q. That was, tell me, was this late '80s, mid '80s?
A. My recollection, it was some, it was probably around 1988. And it may have gone into the early '90s, I just can't remember.
Q. And do you have any records of how much you were paid by the Arnold & Porter firm at that time?
A. No, I do not.
Q. You don't have any tax records whatsoever?
A. I'm not sure I do have tax records in the 1980s.
Q. 10 99 -- would you receive a 1099 from the law firm for your work? Or were you on a salary so you would receive a VI-2?
A* I'm not sure how -- I mean, I was not on a salary from Arnold & Porter, no; and so I assume there must have been a 1099.
Q. And you had taxable income that you paid taxes on from them?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you have another corporation or another entity which assists you or does this work, this type of retainer work, and it filters through that, or does it come to you personally?
A. To me personally.
Q. Okay. On the work that you did on the Haynes case, did you use any other personnel besides yourself?
A. NO.
Q. No graduate assistants?
A. No.
Q. Have you done any other work for Arnold & Porter other than what we have already discussed?
A. What we -- we haven't discussed when I got back into doing tobacco research.
Q. That's correct.
A, Right. So I didn't want to omit that because there was a period of a number of years in between. And then about a year or so before the Blue Cross case in Brooklyn, I was recontacted to do additional research for --by Arnold & Porter.
Q. Okay. And what year would that have been, sir?
A. I think the Blue Cross case was in '99, was it? Or 2000? I can't remember.
So it would be roughly a year before
that case.
Q. Okay. So some time in probably 1998?
A. In the late '90s, yeah.
Q. Okay. Do you have a recollection how much you were paid by Arnold & Porter during the Haynes period?
A. I, I really don't remember.
Q. During your expert disclosure in this particular case you indicate that you are being paid today at $2 50 an hour; is that correct?
A. That's not correct.
Q. That's not correct? And how much, what is your present rate then, sir?
A. $3 50 an hour.
Q. 350. Okay. So we'll correct the formula that was disclosed to us by your counsel.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Actually, I thought it was corrected, or at least my copy.
MR. FINE: My copy says $250 an hour. Q. Now doctor, let's -- oh, you know, you did some work on the Scott case, too, didn't you, down in Louisiana?
A. The name is not familiar. What case
is that?
Q. It's the medical monitoring case that is presently in Louisiana. Scott V. American Tobacco?
A. I'm not familiar with that case by
name.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I would be willing to clarify for you if you want.
MR. FINE: Clarify.
MR. ROSENTHAL: My recollection is this is a while ago and I'm a little shaky. At one point we may have taken his Blue Cross expert report and filed it in Scott and we may not. I think we did that, I'm not positive myself. I know if we filed it, it was ultimately withdrawn; he is not being asked to testify in that case.
Q. Do you have any recollection whatsoever, sir, of executing an affidavit or signing an expert disclosure report in the Scott Louisiana case?
A. I don't.
Q. In the Blue Cross case, did you prepare an affidavit or an expert disclosure?
A. I did.
Q. Did you sign that?
A. I assume I did.
Q. So you would have a record of an original in your office?
A. Yes.
Q. If you are swearing to something like that, you signed it -A. Yes, I assume I signed it, yes.
Q. Okay. What other law firms have you assisted in tobacco litigation besides Arnold & Porter?
A. The lawyers I have worked primarily with have been from Arnold & Porter. There have been a variety of other firms that have represented Philip Morris and other companies and I don't know all of their names. I do know one other one is Winston & Strawn. The counsel who are here today represent additional firms but I can't give you all the names.
Q. Have you discussed your testimony today with counsel other than Arnold & Porter?
A. Well, you mean counsel in this room?
Q. Yes, sir.
A. Counsel in this room, we met yesterday for three hours and we talked about my testimony.
Q. Let's talk about your CV a little bit.
You received your Bachelors in what degree, your baccalaureate?
A. I received a baccalaureate in Chemistry at Duke University in 1969.
Q. What's your birthday, sir?
» Personal Confidential ' Redacted
Q.	is mine.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Is that statistically if you put 10 people in the room the odds are?
MR. FINE: You're the first person I ever met with my birthday.
THE WITNESS: I work with a social worker who has the same birthday, same year.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Which one of you is older?
THE WITNESS: You know, I haven't determined that.
BY MR. FINE:
Q. And okay, so I'm sorry, you piqued me with your birthday. Chemistry and did you have a second major?
A. No.
Q. Okay. You went directly -- you didn't go directly. Did you go to, did you perform some service between '69 and '75?
A. No, I didn't. The reason there's a six-year gap there is I got both an MD and a Ph.D., so it took six years to get both degrees.
Q. I see. And during that time were you
married?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Have any children?
A. Not during that time. We had a son two later.
Q. When you say two years later, you mean in 1971 or?
A. 1977.
Q. 1977. Okay.
When you graduated from Duke in '69, what was your draft number?
A. I was in the lottery.
Q. Yeah.
A. And it was 342, I believe. So it was the only game of chance I have ever one.
Q. I think I was 3 26; I have the same birthday *
A. We would have been in the same one?
Q. Well, no, I had a choice because I didn't graduate until '71.
A. I was in the very first one.
Q. I decided I would take my chances with 346 -- 326? Isn't it 326?
A. Are you sure you were 326? Because I have a recollection it was a little higher than that.
Q. I went to sleep. After they hit 200,
I said, "I'm out of this."
A, See, you're dating us.
Q. Uh-huh.
A. Because the lottery --
Q. They wouldn't have any idea.
A. You may remember, right. But certainly James doesn't remember.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Before my time.
A. Before he was born.
Q. That was a very important night, let me tell you.
A. Very important. As long as you are over 110, as I remember, or was it 125?
Q. I think where I was, 118 you were pretty safe.
Okay. So then we get a dual degree in 1975 from Duke in history and in, as a medical doctor; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Now you have always performed your duties as a pediatric doctor?
A. My medical duties, yes. I'm a primary care pediatrician.
Q. And as such you are a member of
certain professional associations, are you not?
A. I am.
Q. Are you in the AMA?
A. No, I am not.
Q. You're in the American Board of Pediatrics?
A. I am.
Q. Okay.
A. A diplomat of that organization.
Q. Isn't it a fact that they have taken a position against smoking?
A. I am sure they have, yes.
Q. And you're still a member?
A. Absolutely. I take the position against smoking.
Q. We'll talk about that later.
Do you smoke?
A. Never.
Q. Does your wife smoke?
A. She did.
Q. The North Carolina Pediatric Society, you are a member of that society; is that correct?
A. Yes. That's a constituent of the American Academy of Pediatrics,
Q, And they indeed have also taken a
position against smoking; is that correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. Your first position was as a doctor or as a professor, your first full-time position?
A. I was appointed both in the Department of Pediatrics and in the Department of History. In the early years my primary appointment was in pediatrics. Then when I was tenured, because most of my publications were in the field of medical history, my primary appointment shifted to the History Department. But that was mostly administrative reasons for that and how tenure is awarded at Duke University.
Q. Have you ever studied Charles Beard?
A. I did in graduate school.
Q. And do you approve of his methodology of research in history?
A. I don't recall what his method was.
Q. Okay. Tell me about your methodology courses while you were studying for your Ph.D.
What courses did you take, sir?
A. I took a number of graduate seminars that looked at methods in American history, history of science, history of medicine.
Q, Do you teach any of those now?
A. I teach a method in all courses that I am asking students to write research papers.
Q. You don't teach a course directly in methodology?
A. No, I do not.
Q. Or the philosophy in methodology?
A. I do not.
Q. Okay. But you have taken courses such as those?
A. They didn't have those names. They were methods courses; they didn't have the title, "The Philosophy of Method," no.
Q. Okay. Can you give me the specific names of the method courses that you took while you were going for your Ph.D.?
A. I can't give you the specific names.
As I said, there were graduate courses --
Q. One second, do we need the stop? I hear some kind of beeping. (Pause)
MR. FINE: I don't care about those messages. My voice mail goes crazy sometimes. I'm sorry to interrupt you, doctor.
A. I took methods courses in the history of medicine and the history of science and in
American history. I don't recall the names. They may have -- I just at this point I can't remember.
Q. Okay. Would the American history course have been an undergraduate course?
A. No, graduate course.
Q. Graduate course.
A. As would the ones in the history of science and the history of medicine as well.
Q. Now in this particular case who contacted you to do some work in this case?
A. The person who contacted me was James Rosenthal.
Q. Do you recall when that was?
A. In late spring 2002.
Q. Just a few months ago?
A. Yes.
Q. And up until that time the only other tobacco cases that you were working on was the Blue Cross case; is that correct?
A. Well, I, I mentioned a few others. There was are the Swartz case, the Bullock case, the Miles case, very briefly a Browne case that was spelled differently than this one.
Q. Where was that Browne case?
A. I don't remember.
There was a case I think I that may have been mentioned in the Marshall Islands.
Q. These were all cases you were working with Arnold & Porter?
A. Yes.
Q. And Mr. Rosenthal?
A. Yes,
Q. All of them?
A. Well, he is involved in many of the cases. The DOJ case is an exception of that.
Q. And who are you working with on that
case?
A. Working with Kevin Narko, Winston & Strawn in Chicago.
MR. ROSENTHAL: N-A-R-K-O.
Q. Do you have different rates for these
cases?
A. No.
Q. The rate is always $350 an hour?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. How much were you paid for tobacco cases in 2001?
A. I, I can't give you a specific number, I don't recall.
Q. Was it more than a dollar?
A.	Yes, it was more than a dollar.
Q.	Was it more than $10,000?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Was it more than $30,000?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Was it more than $75,000?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Was it more than $100,000?
A.	Yes, I think so.
Q.	Okay. Was it more than $150,000 in
2001?
A.	I can't recall.
Q.	Do you have invoices to Arnold &
Porter and	these other law firms as to your services?
A.	I did. I submitted them invoices.
Q.	Do you have the invoices at your
office?
A.	No. Once they are paid, I, I don't, I
don't keep	them.
Q.	Do you have 1099s?
A.	I assume my accountant does.
Q.	Do you have your tax records for the
last three	years?
A.	I think I can lay my hands on them,
yes.
Q. Okay. What's your salary here at the university?
A. The base salary is $130,000. Then I get bonuses from pediatrics depending on productivity.
Q. So are you in private practice, is that your pediatric practice, or are you employed by Duke the hospital, how is does it work?
A. Complicated in my case because I have a dual appointment in that part of my salary comes because I'm a Professor of Pediatrics and that is a salaried position. Some of it comes from I'm -let me back up, it is complicated.
Q. Take your time.
A. Because I'm a professor in two departments, history and pediatrics. I get a salary contribution from both departments because of my academic work.
Q. Okay., Can I stop you there? The $130,000 you told us about, is that a combination?
A. That's everything. Everything except the bonuses.
Q. Everything except the bonuses. So that's the Pediatric Department payment?
A. Uh-huh.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Yes or no.
A. Yes.
Q. History payment?
A. Yes.
Q. Is that for working in your pediatric practice?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Then the bonuses, how are they calculated?
A. They are calculated based on productivity and seeing patients.
MR. ROSENTHAL: In the HMO world?
THE WITNESS: Something like that.
Q. And, for example, last year, 2001, your productivity would have generated a bonus in your best estimate, sir?
A. Probably around $10,000.
Q. So in 2001 your sources of income at Duke University would have been approximately $130,000; your bonuses from Duke would have been $10,000; is that correct?
A. In that ballpark, yes,
Q. In that ballpark. And what other sources -- we'll get back to Arnold & Porter. But
what other source was income did you have in 2001?
A. We had some investments and I had some income from that.
Q. So nothing else we would call sweat equity, nothing elsewhere you were working with your hands?
A. I also did some consulting work with the lead pigment manufacturers.
Q. This is in 2001?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. In 2001, the lead paint entities, how much did you make from them?
A. I don't remember.
Q. Was it more than $10,000?
A. More than $10,000.
Q. Less than $100,000?
A. I think so.
Q. Okay. Less than 75?
A. I don't know. I can't be more specific.
Q. So 75,000 might be an estimate, somewhere in there? I'm not holding you to it, it's not -MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. Yeah. I just can't be more specific,
I'm sorry.
Q. And you charge them the same rate of $350 an hour; is that correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. Okay. And they paid you via a 1099 also; is that correct, sir?
A. Yes.
Q. Other than the $350 an hour, is there any other type of remuneration that you would have received in these cases? Did you get any kind of bonuses, did you get any kind of travel money, do you get money, for example, if you have somebody assist you in research that they may charge 35 and then you will charge the law firm, 45, $10 administrative fee, things like that?
A. No. I mean, I do have, occasionally I did have someone do some bibliographical work and they usually work for $15 or $18 an hour, but I don't charge an administrative fee for that.
Q. How do you charge the law firm for that $15 or $18 per hour individual?
A. I write the research assistant a check and then I send the cancelled check to the law firm and they reimburse me for it.
Q. They reimburse you that hourly rate or
a different hourly rate?
A. They just pay for the, they reimburse me for the check to the research assistant.
Q. Okay. So you personally give out 1099s, is that correct, to these research assistants for their work?
A. I haven't.
Q. You haven't?
A. No.
Q. Did you take out any taxes for these individuals?
A. I don't think so.
Q. In 2 001, how much were you reimbursed for these individuals?
A. I can't remember.
Q. Okay. Are they collected on your invoices?
A. They would be. It is a fairly occasional activity.
Q. Would it be fair to say you may have paid out perhaps $1,000 in the whole year for having someone assist you on bibliography actives?
A. Probably.
Q. How about 2,500?
A. I don't remember.
Q, Okay. It could be something more than $1,000, though, right?
A. It could be.
Q. Did you discuss this with your accountant, this particular type of deduction?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. Deduction?
Q. Well, what you -- you received a reimbursement and you also made a payment. So it would look as if you were making an additional profit when, in fact you were not, you were making solely the deduction?
A. No. I think from the accountant's point of view he just sees what I received. So there wasn't a deduction from that point of view.
Q. Okay. Now with lead paint individuals do you have another entity or is it you personally that work for them? Like I say, a consulting firm or - -
A. I don't have a consulting firm, it is just me personally.
. Q. Okay. So these checks that you would give to the individuals, they would be personal checks?
A. Yes.
Q. And you have copies of those checks from last year? You won't have destroyed your checks since last year, would you?
A. What I did was I sent the check, the cancelled check, to the law firm to be reimbursed.
Q. Ha. So the law firm would have the cancelled check?
A. I don't know if they do or not.
Q. Okay.. So would it be fair to say that in 2001 you earned approximately $330,000?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. I can't remember what the -- it would be that or it might be a little more than that.
Q. And your Arnold & Porter portion of that, what would you say, around 130?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form, mischaracterizes his testimony.
Q. You can answer that, sir.
A. I don't want to, to --Q. We're not, it is what it is.
A. The reason I say that is occasionally I get paid a check, for example, that comes from Arnold & Porter sometimes because I am -- their client is Philip Morris. Sometimes a portion, some of that comes through Philip Morris.
Q. I see.
A. So you asked me the question specifically and I was talking about an aggregate fee* But some of the checks come from Arnold & Porter, some of the checks comes from Philip Morris.
Q. Some of the checks come from Philip
Morris?
A. Yes.
Q. So when you told me somewhere in excess of 100 or probably around 130 -- and I'm not holding you to that figure -A. Right:, that was a total. But what proportion comes through Arnold & Porter I can't, I can't remember.
Q. Does Philip Morris send you also a 1099 or do they send you a W-2?
A. Oh, a 1099.
Q. 1099.
Do you consider yourself an employee of Philip Morris?
A. No.
Q. Do you get any other benefits from Philip Morris?
A. No.
Q. Just the straight subcontract or the contract that you receive?
MS. FRANKEL: Objection.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I mean, I perform historic research at $3 50 an hour. I submit statements for that.
Q. I understand. And do you have any, do you have any understanding as to why sometimes it is Arnold & Porter that pays your retainer fees and sometimes it is Philip Morris that pays your retainer fees?
A. No.
Q. Have you ever signed a contract with Philip Morris directly?
A. No, I have not.
Q. Now when you bill this out, you bill by the hour; is that correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. Do you specify on your bills, on your invoices, as to what the work is for?
A. Sometimes I specify for the particular case that I'm involved in, yes. Let me be specific.
Q. You take your time and tell me.
A. Yeah. Again I don't want to be
confusing here.
When I started back working for Arnold & Porter, I had a new assignment and that was what the public health community's response, especially in the years after the first Surgeon General's report. So in the beginning I did a lot of background reading. At the same time, I was also, you know, preparing for the Blue Cross case.
So in that period of time, because I was doing a lot of background reading, I don't think that was -- I didn't bill that directly for Blue Cross.
Since that time, I have been working for individual cases that I normally would specify in the bill which case that it is for.
Q. Have you ever billed for the Scott case to your knowledge?
A. I'm sure I haven't.
Q. You're sure you haven't?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. Now -- and you advise me how your business practice is. Let's assume that you have done work about your area of what you say is your expertise for Philip Morris or Arnold & Porter up through 1964 and you were paid in the Haynes matter
for that type of research. Is that correct?
A. Well, Haynes came in at the very end. In other words, for much of that time, I was not -I don't think I was paid specifically for Haynes.
Q. Okay.
A. I was being compensated for the research --
Q. Okay.
A. --up through 1964.
Q. All right. When you were then employed by, say, Blue Cross in the Blue Cross case and you now have this body of research up to 1964, how do you bill for incorporating that aspect into your next report?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I had to go back and review the pre '64 material. There was a fairly substantial body of material and it will be a number of years when I hadn't given it much thought other than teaching.
I mean, I teach smoking and health.
But as far as the detail of pre 1964, I needed to review that.
Q. Give me a second, please. (Pause) as a professor in the Department of Medicine, how many hours are you required -- is that the way you work,
by the hour?
A. No. I have responsibilities.
Q. Do you have responsibilities and
tasks --
A. I have responsibilities in the Department of History; I have responsibilities in the Department of Pediatrics.
Q. Okay. Your responsibilities in the Department of History would be to teach several courses?
A. Yes, I teach one course each semester in the Department of History and participate in departmental committees and all.
Q. How many years have you only taught one course in the Department of History?
A. The entire time I have been employed. That calculation, a full load is considered two courses; and since I have a dual appointment, my load has been one course a semester.
Q. Okay. Backing up, a full load is considered two courses?
A. Two courses a semester.
Q. So you only have to teach one course
in each?
A. Semester,
Q. In each department?
A. No. That's the -- stay in history for a moment.
Q. Okay, that's fine.
A. Stay in history. A full load in history is two course each semester.
Q. Right;.
A. I teach one course each semester.
Q. The Department of Medicine?
A. The Department of Pediatrics.
Q. Pediatrics, I'm sorry.
A. Currently I see patients in three clinics, three half-day clinics, a week, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday mornings.
Q. And what would be considered a full
load?
A. Roughly twice that. And the difference is depending on the level of administrative work someone is doing, it can go up and down.
In my career, depending on what I was doing mostly in my life at that point, I have had as many as five clinics a week and I have had as few as three.
Q. And when you say a half a day, what do
you mean by a half a day?
A. Well, the clinics are from 8:00 to 12:30 but it actually extends more than that. Usually, I do my managed care work from before clinic, so roughly 7:00 to 8:00. I also have --am in a rotation of night call and weekend call.
That's all added on to that.
On the days I'm not in clinic I'm still responsible for following up on laboratory work and contacting patients.
I call into my office every day whether I'm in the History Department or doing pediatrics. And many of my patients contact me by e-mail; and I look at my e-mail every day to be able to respond to them if they decide to contact me.
Q. Seems to me as far as the Pediatric Department could be pretty conservative maybe 30 hours a week you might apply to that?
A. Could be. Depends on the week. May not be that much.
Q. And teaching a course you have to research for each particular class? I mean, you have been teaching the same course, you don't have to do a full load on the research?
A. I modify each course every time I teach to it some extent, bringing various lectures up to, up to the current level of research and understanding. Sometimes I change topics altogether.
So there is work involved.
Q. So you mean like us students who always thought it was only three hours a week, it really isn't?
A. I wish it were three hours a week.
Q. Okay. Would 15 hours a week be more
like it?
A. It is, really, it, it depends. It depends. In my freshman seminar I ask them each to turn in 10 papers; so I will, every week I had lots of grading, I had student conferences. It is really hard to put a, an hourly figure on it.
Q. In the year 2000, did you still have your salary here at Duke at $130,000?
A. I can't remember what my salary was in 2000. It would be somewhat less than that.
Q. And the bonus would be commensurately less a little bit?
A. I don't remember what my bonuses were.
Q. And Arnold & Porter, what would you
have invoiced them for that year?
A. I really can't remember.
Q. More than $50,000?
A. Probably.
Q. More than 75?
A. I, you know, I, I really can't remember. I mean, it might be.
Q. Okay. You don't think it topped $100,000?
A. I don't, I can't be more specific.
Q. When it was Blue Cross case active?
A. You know, I can't remember whether it was '99 or 2000. And given that this CV has '99, that could be for the Blue Cross case.
Q. Okay. So in 1999 when you were first employed, you would have had to review -- by the way, in the year 2 000, would you have received any of those Arnold & Porter checks, would they also have included Philip Morris checks?
A. I can't remember.
Q. Okay.
A. I think probably but I, I wish, I just want be more specific.
Q. Your invoices you always prepare on your computer?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And what program do you use to prepare your invoices, Quick Books or something like that?
A. Word Perfect.
Q. Word Perfect?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. So you saved all these on a disk, all your invoices?
A. Well,, some of them go -- I have had a number of computers and so they're on some disk.
Q. They're on some disk. Are they in your computer, too?
A. No, I meant some hard disk.
Q. The hard disk that is presently that you are using -A. No.
Q. --or perhaps you are using at home?
A. No, the old -- I mean, I have, I have had a new computer for the last nine months or so, so I have those data.
Q. You didn't transfer your data from your prior computer -A. You know, once the bills are paid, I, I mean, I could -- I mean I'm trying to think. I
have, I may have some, some that go a little bit beyond that? but I don't, I don't transfer everything over when I get a new computer.
Q. When you say "beyond that," do you mean beyond nine months ago?
A. Right, earlier than nine months.
Q. Well, it's December now. You don't have the information that you have given to Arnold and Porter the first quarter of this particular year -A. Yes, I do.
Q. -- you wipe it out?
A. I mean, I got the new computer probably about this time last year so it is probable about a year's I have.
Q. In any event, the law firm where Philip Morris would have -- sorry, lost my mike.
The law firm of Philip Morris would have all the invoices you would have generated over the past two years?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
Q. So far as you know?
A. I assume. I don't know what their accounting practices are.
Q. And you think some of these invoices
Dr most of these invoices for the past two years still exist in the hard drive that you presently have?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I can't tell you how far back they go, but probably the last two years.
Q. I'm requesting you at this time not to destroy any invoices when the new year comes about. Sir?
A. Okay.
Q. Thank you. How many computers do you have in your office that you use at this time?
A. I have one. I have a computer in my pediatric office and I have a laptop.
Q. Do you prepare your expert affidavits or expert disclosures on that particular computer or are they delivered to you and you scan them in? How does it work?
A. I write them on my computer.
Q. And do you have those expert disclosures back to 2000?
A. I have the federal disclosure. I have the Mile -- well, let me. I'm getting a little tangled here in --- in my expert reports, is that different from an expert disclosure?
Q. Depends on the state.
A. That's what I'm trying to figure here. But I have the reports. That's the one that is usually around 20 or so odd pages. I have -- what I usually do is I start; I write a draft; and then I change it and correct it, correct over on top of that. And I have the Department of Justice one, I have the Miles one currently I have.
Q. Now do you have a computer program, some of us do, that keeps corrections; so that once you correct something, you have the old corrected copy and then the new copy?
A. You know, I don't know. I don't know whether Word Perfect does that automatically or not.
Q. It has the capacity to do it, you have to tell it to do it.
A. I don't know. I just type into it and make corrections; and so I don't, you know, I don't know whether you can go in the program in some way and see what my corrections are or not.
Q. Okay. Do you have any other computers in your office that you personally use?
A. No.
Q. Do you have a laptop?
A. Let me stop back there.
Q. Go ahead.
A. In the clinic there are all sorts of computers that I use for patient data. And I do use those. But when I said no quickly initially, I thought you meant to do with my historical research.
Q. Do you ever do any historical research on those computers?
A. No, no.
Q. How about at home?
A. I take my laptop at home.
Q. And how long have you had this particular laptop?
A. That's the same one I was talking about a minute ago. I have had it roughly a year.
Q. So this is the computer you take back and forth?
A. Yes.
Q. We forgot about one particular aspect of your work week. As a tenured professor, don't have you to keep publishing?
A. I do.
Q. Okay. And don't you need to do some research that has to be submitted to the department
to retain -- maybe not retain your tenure, but to keep up your accreditation?
A. No.
Q. You don't have to now that you are
tenured?
A. Well, to be promoted I had to do additional research so I could be promoted. But -and I'm expected to be productive. But there's no requirement of numbers of papers or books.
Q. I see. And for your promotion from Associate Professor to full Professor?
A. That's correct.
Q. What type of research did you do?
A. I wrote a book to the history of rheumatic fever, i	Q. Does that have any relationship to the
' work that you did on typhoid Mary? i	A. No.
i	Q. Just curious. I know it is all around
I	the same time.
.	When you went to -- let's stay with
! one topic for a while. The book on rheumatic ! fever, by whom was that published?
[	A. Rutgers University Press,
>	Q. Did you receive any income in the year
2	000 from that book?
A. I don't think so. Academic books don't sell very many copies.
Q. Are you sure?
A. And as I remember, I think I probably received something like $500 or $1,000 when I signed the contract to publish the book; and then, the only way I would make additional money from the book is if, after Rutgers, you know, made up, made the cost of the production of the book, then I would get a proportion of the, of the excess. And
1	don't believe that that has occurred.
Q. When was that book published?
A. I have to look. 2000? '99? '99.
Q. '99. And do you know what the first run on the book was, how many copies?
A. I do not know.
Q. Have you published any other books?
A. I have. I have a book that I published before that, it was on the history of surgery. And I have one that I published on childhood lead poisoning after that.
Q. So it is fair to say that in the year
2	0 00 in your income tax you feel that you made something in excess of $200,000; is that correct?
MR- ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. Yes, that, that's correct.
Q. Okay.. 1999, you started working on the Blue Cross/Blue Shield case and several other of these cases. How much were you making as a full professor again?
A. It would probably be 4% or 5% less than it was the year before. But, you know, we're getting into a very, a very foggy area.
Q. Well, we're still within the three-year or seven-year retention for your income tax records.
A. Yes, but not retention in my brain.
Q. Okay. Well, I'm not holding you to the Penny. This isn't an accounting seminar, that's for sure.
Now Arnold & Porter and Philip Morris, you would have invoiced them that year; is that correct?
A. Again, I hope I have the right year for Blue Cross and that's what I'm, you know, just so but --
Q. We're focusing in what you have provided -A. I mean, if it was '99, yes, I would
have, I would have sent them invoices.
Q. Okay.. Now was that the first year you started working again on the Blue Cross/Blue Shield case you believe? Or you said originally that they contacted you in '98 and you had to bring your research up to snuff?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. Right. Originally '88, and then I worked for a few years in and around the late '80s. Then there was -- they recontacted me before the Blue Cross case, and then I started then.
What I can't, I'm sorry, I just can't remember precisely what month that was, but...
Q. I understand. But you would have started working for them you believe in 1998?
A. I can't remember when it was. It may have been, it may have been in the middle of 1998.
Q. Okay. Let's talk about 1999. You would have invoiced Arnold & Porter or Philip Morris, did you ever invoice Philip Morris directly, sir?
A. No.
Q. Who were you working with in 1999,
Mr. Rosenthal?
A. Mr. Rosenthal.
Q. And approximately would you have invoiced him about what you had the previously two years you stated, about $130,000 or thereabouts?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. Q. You may answer, sir.
A, In that initial year it may have been more than that.
Q. How much more do you believe?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
Q. Maybe 150?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. I can't remember.
Q. Okay. Would that be an untoward
figure?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. No, it would not.
Q. How about 2 00,000?
A. I can't remember.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. Q. You can't remember. But would 2 00,000 be out of line?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. I, I just can't give you any more specificity on that. I'm sorry.
not be out of line?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. Q. Okay. And in that particular year you made approximately 126,000, approximately. Your bonus would have been that much less, so maybe around $9,000?
A. I can't remember.
Q. Yeah. But it is less than the 10 you are making presently?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. I think that's correct, yes.
Q. Okay.. And you had your additional source of income, your book, you made about $1.37 on that?
A. No - -
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
A. -- I don't think it was that much.
Q. Were there any other sources of income
in 1999?
A. We do have some investments, my wife
and I.
Q. Okay. How about the lead paint cases? A. I, I was -- I think in 1999 I probably did some, was doing some work with them also as well.
Q. Would that have been again around $75,000 to $100,000 for the lead paint people?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form, A. It might, it might be. I just don't
recall.
Q. Okay. 1998, Arnold & Porter, you had to bring up your work for them; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form, mischaracterizes his testimony.
A. Again, I'm not, you know, I can't remember precisely when I was retained by them the second time, whether it was in 1998 or not.
Q. Okay. Your best estimate is probably 1998. It is prior to the Blue Cross case?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form, mischaracterizes his testimony.
A. Well, it was prior to Blue Cross, yes, Q. Okay.
A. This would be made easier if I could recall when Blue Cross was.
Q. Well, the only -- we're not representing Blue Cross and the only thing I have to rely upon for that would be you your CV.
A. I don't put cases on my CV,
done some work in 1999.
MR. ROSENTHAL: We all know, honestly, I would be happy to tell you when Blue Cross was.
MR. FINE: Go ahead.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Blue Cross, the trial started in early spring in 2001.
MR. FINE: When did the case begin?
MR. ROSENTHAL: When did they file the
case?
MR. FINE: Yeah.
MR. ROSENTHAL: To be perfectly honest I don't know that.
MR. FINE: Do you want to tell us now or later as to when he was initially retained, if you can recollect?
MR. ROSENTHAL: I would be surprised if it was in '98. I'm not positive myself. I think it was '99.
MR. FINE: You think it was '99?
Okay.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Yeah. In fact, '98 would have been -- yeah, there's no way it would be '98. It would be '99.
BY MR- FINE:
Q. Now given what counsel has said -- and I understand there may be a leeway here of three or four months, doesn't make all that much of a difference -- in '98 your sources of income is basically Duke University?
A, Yes.
Q. And the lead paint people?
A. Correct.
Q. And your private investments?
A. Yes.
Q. What's your wife do, by the way?
A. She's a Professor of English at Meredith College in Raleigh,
Q. Does she ever clean up your language in your disclosures?
A. She does -- not the disclosures. I thought you were going to say in my research. She has done some wonderful copy editing in my books.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Do you want us to send
her a transcript's.
A. No, I don't want that.
Q. That's pretty cheap labor.
A. What do you mean by that?
Q. You don't pay her, do you?
A. No I, don't pay her.
Q. That's what I mean, you have a Ph.D. doing your copy work.
A. Well...
Q. Now in '97 were you doing any consulting or retainer work?
A. I was consulting for the lead pigment manufacturers.
Q. When did that start, sir?
A. What year?
Q. Yes, sir.
A. '96.
Q. 96?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Could we just go off the record for a second?
A. Yeah.
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're off the record at 10:37.
(Recess taken.)
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're on the record at 10:51.
MR. FINE: Doctor, I'm sorry, if I could ask the court reporter, was the last question answered before we decided to take a break?
(Record read.)
MR. ROSENTHAL: The question, what year did you start consulting with.
MR. FOGARTY: Off the record for a second.
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record at 10:52 (Pause)
We're on the record at 10:53.
Q. Doctor, just to pick up from where we were, you had indicated that in 1996 you had started doing some consulting work with the lead pigment industry. I don't think you ever told us exactly who your client was.
A. The attorneys I worked for I think I did tell you --
Q. Yeah, it was Arnold & Porter.
A. It was Arnold & Porter and they represent ARCO.
Q. ARCO, okay. And what type of research brought you to Arnold & Porter's attention in 1996 regarding lead pigment litigation?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. I'm not entirely sure how they got my name. But I, I think it is likely that because I had worked for a different office of Arnold &
Porter in a tobacco case at that point six years earlier that that's how my name got to the New York office of Arnold & Porter.
Q. They were satisfied with your work in the Haynes case, so they?
A. I assume.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. Q. Okay., So now we come to a hiatus of approximately five to six years where you did not do any resulting work whatsoever?
A. That is correct.
Q. And during that time your income was derived basically from Duke University being a professor?
A. That's correct.
Q. And being a pediatric doctor. Did you have a private practice at that time?
A. Part of my role as Professor of Pediatrics, at that time I was an Associate Professor of Pediatrics, I participated in a primary care practice.
MR. VERNON: Doctor, let me stop you just a second. We consulted with Brown counsel in San Diego and in fact we did not request the videographer. So I think at
this point, unless Patrick Cafferty does want to keep it going, he probably could -MR. ROSENTHAL: Yeah. I mean, we took a look at the notice, and the notice says, will videotape. Obviously, that is -MR. VERNON: Certainly the option.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Well, that's the question between the notice and who actually ordered it.if you guys don't want the videotape that's fine, we're happy not having it.
MR. FINE: We never asked.
MR. ROSENTHAL: The notice says, "Please take further notice that this deposition will be videotaped.11
MR. FINE: That may well be, but that doesn't mean we contacted the videographer.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I understand the difference between the notice and whoever requested it. If you guys don't want the videographer, that's fine; we don't want him either.
MR. FINE: Okay.
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're off the video record at 10:56.
(Videotaping ended. Recess.)
BY MR. FINE;
Q. I think we were at '96 and I had asked you about how you came to Arnold & Porter's attention with the lead paint?
A. And then I think you said that in the years prior to that was my income primarily -MR. ROSENTHAL: Are we on the record?
Okay, we are?
MR. FINE: We're on the record?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Yes.
(Record read.)
A. Came primarily from Duke University, and that is correct.
Q. Okay. This address that we have on the CV that's from July 1999, is that your present home address?
A. It is.
Q. And when did you move in there, sir?
A. 1988, I think.
Q. So I think we were discussing that you may have had a bit of a private pediatric practice in '96, I think that's where we left off.
A. Well, I have always seen patients since I joined the faculty in 1978. How many
patients, that varies from year to year and as the managed care referral revolution took place; and so I have seen more patients -- I saw more patients from the mid 1980s than I had up until that point. But I have always had a patient practice.
Q. But the patient practice, you're primarily paid by bonus from Duke; is that the way it works?
A. No. Most of my money comes as a salary. But as a:n addition to that, there's small bonus which is usually less than 10% of what my salary is.
Q. Is it fair to say that during those five or seven years, whatever your salary was between 1990 and 1996 that the bonus was in that measure of about 10%?
A. Less than 10%.
Q. Less than 10%.
I notice in your CV, Exhibit 3285, you have a history of grants. I would like to ask you about that.
A. Okay.
Q. The grant from 1984 to '86 states the "Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation (salary support)."
Who funds that foundation, sir, the Josiah Macy,
Jr. Foundation?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. That is, I believe that was initially a family of tugboat money in New York City but it has been a foundation for many decades.
Q. And Josiah Charles Trent Memorial Foundation, who would fund that?
A. Josiah Charles Trent was the first thoracic surgeon at Duke; and he died young and his family made an endowment. Even though he was a surgeon, he had a tremendous interest in the history of medicine, and so they have a family foundation; one of the areas that the Trent foundation funds is that of medical history.
Q. The Burroughs Wellcome Fund Travel Grant, a research trip to London?
A. Yes.
Q. Who would fund that?
A.	Well, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, which is the American counterpart of the Burroughs Wellcome Trust, which is initially a British pharmaceutical company.
Q. The American Philosophical Society Travel to Archives Grant, that would be that type of society?
A. The American Philosophical Society funds academic work in the humanities and social sciences; and that was a summer travel grant, yes.
Q. Okay. The National Institutes of Health Grant, that's a federal government?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Mary Duke Biddle, is that Pennsylvania the Biddles, the ones that signed the Constitution?
A. Could be. But these are the North Carolina Biddles, a member of the Duke family James
B.	Duke family.
Q. I worked in a law firm that had Biddle and Sparr and they both were signers of the Declaration of -- not the Declaration, the Constitution, I'm sorry.
MS. FRANKEL: You don't look that old.
MR. FINE: They did. (Laughter)
A. I think the Pennsylvania Biddles and the North Carolina, there is a relationship there.
Q. Ha. Probably came over on the same
boat.
Have you ever received -- these grants, these would be to defray the particular cost for the, as you have here, salary, lecture
series, a research trip, that would be to defray your personal costs?
A. Yes. And the one there for sabbatical support so that I can leave my practice as well as my history for a year in London.
Q. Has your wife ever received any income from Arnold & Porter?
A. No.
Q. Has she ever received any income from any tobacco source?
A. No.
Q. Okay. Have you ever received a grant from CTR?
A. No.
Q. TI?
A. No.
Q. TIRC?
A. No.
Q. Has it ever been offered to you?
A. No.
Q. Have you ever made application for a grant from those folks?
A, No.
Q. Do you know who they are?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. You have taught in the past a course, "Epidemics In History"?
A. I have taught epidemic diseases in a number of different time periods. The course has a variety of different names. But the first one I taught, "Epidemics In History," that was the first year I was a member of the faculty.
Q. And how do you go about researching for a course like that? What would, what type of, say, primary -- you would first look for primary sources, I would suffice?
A. That particular course I dealt with sort of world epidemics and because the person I was teaching with, Ann Carmichael, was a plague expert.
Q. We're not talking about the black
plague?
A. We were talking about the black plague --
Q. Okay.
A. -- but that was not the first epidemic. But we first from our historic readings came up with a list of epidemics that we wanted to teach, and then we went and did the secondary research first to what other historians had read.
Ann was, because she was doing her dissertation and then eventually her first book on the plague, she had obviously done, in that large segment dealing with the bubonic plague, she had the primary sources already done.
But basically was we identified a number of epidemics, read mostly secondary sources, and then some primary sources.
Q. Are you familiar with a plague in Alsace, Lorraine, I guess around the 14th and 15th century had to do with parasites in wheat?
Are you familiar with that?
A. You mean the ergot dancing mania?
Q. Yeah, where they have that, they have that striking altar piece in Colmar of the Christ figure with the lesions that the same people have. Are you familiar with that?
A. No, I'm not.
Q. Okay, you can't talk about that then.
We can talking about the bubonic plague I suppose. Is that one of your favorites?
A. I have read a fair amount on the bubonic plague. More recently when I teach the epidemics courses it deals more with 20th Century epidemics than the bubonic plague. There are some
20th Century epidemics of the bubonic plague but I don't think --
Q. How about what was it, in the war of 1950 or I960, what was that, pneumonia among our population?
A. It was influenza.
Q. Influenza,
A. It wais 1918.
Q. 1918.
A. I do use that epidemic in my course.
Q. Okay.. Well, let's chat about that. When you first start researching that, the methodology that you would use, you would go to the secondary source, other historians?
A. Yes, I do. There are a number of books on the 1918, a number of articles as well on 1918. It's a fascinating epidemic because more people, more Americans, more people worldwide died of influenza than died of battle wounds. And so from that point of view I use it.
Another reason I use it is because it is one of the first real examples of a worldwide epidemic, in that it wasn't just something that happened in the United States, it happened in Europe, Asia, Africa, and around the world.
Q. And, doctor, how would you define an epidemic?
A. It is a disease that's important to people. "Epidemics" means "upon people." And what I mean by important, it can have many possibilities. It could be important to a group of people, such as child bed fevers. Death in childbirth is something that is important primarily to women; breast cancer to women; prostate cancer would be to men. It could be a disease that is like AIDS, which has been very important for one particular group of people.
It can be a disease that is fascinating because it comes and goes. Heart attacks I think is particularly interesting from a historic point of view because, as far as we can tell, in 1890 and 2000, virtually no one was suffering from heart attacks. It rose to become the most important disease in the country; it peaked somewhere in the early 1950s; it has receded by 40%. That makes for fascinating history about how diseases come into contact.
The same thing is true of lung cancer. There weren' t very many cases of lung cancer in the 19th Century.
Q. How would you differentiate, say# lead paint, the syndrome of children getting sick -- I have not been involved in that litigation at all so I'm not really asking you really for that one -and the epidemic definition that you just used? Or would you not differentiate?
A. I would put it in the same -- I use an ecological model when I look at epidemics that consists of the disease, the population, the society, cultural and physical environment all interacting.
If you deal with an infectious disease, it could be something like influenza virus would be plugged into the ecological model.
Dealing with lead poisoning, it would be, you know, lead would be -- it wouldn't be an infectious disease, obviously.
If you're dealing with lung cancer, one of the things you would put in there would be cigarette smoking.
Q. This ecological model that you use for defining epidemics, is that an accepted model in your area of history?
A. I use it. I think some people -- I mean, I spend a lot of time talking about it in my
rheumatic fever book. It has a strong biological component to it; and that's, I think that's somewhat controversial in some historic circles but I think all epidemics have biological components so I put equal stress on that as well as some of the social and cultural aspects.
Q. Could you tell me in the influenza a portion epidemic - - let's stay on this, this is really interesting. Let's stay on this.
Where did you come up with this particular theory of determining what an epidemic is? I mean, did you devise this or is this something that you have read about and other historians have viewed?
A. You mean sort of looking at this from an ecological point of view?
Q. Well,, the ecological, and I was writing down, I'm not as technically talented as our young counsel there. You say it has three aspects, and one of the aspects is broken down into social and cultural -A. Four aspects.
Q. Four aspects? Okay.
A. The population, the agent, the physical environment and the cultural environment.
Q. Okay. The cultural environment.
A. Influenza, it would be influenza virus, the population would be a world population but particularly the recruits, the cultural environment would be a world war, and the mobilization and the transit of hundreds of thousands of troops from continent to continent.
And the physical environment is the particular nature of the influenza virus and what it requires; it usually has mixing of the human virus with the animal influenza virus to yield a more potent strain.
Q. Could I question the physical environment?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. Would I be fair in calling it a catalyst?
A. I think they all can be catalysts.
Q. Okay, I'm just, for my own mind -A. I would look at in that case really the war would be the catalyst. Because there were -- in any given epidemic you need to have all these components interacting; but I think one of the reasons why 1918 was the pandemic, the worldwide epidemic, is the war.
Q. Okay. If -- so if you are going to research influenza, you're going to break out your research into secondary sources, then primary sources - -
A, Right. And I think --
Q. -- but you are going to categorize it, you're going to categorize it in the fashion for your own teaching methods and for your own writing methods in these four categories. Is that fair?
A. Yeah, usually. What I say, there's a different type of research that I do when I'm actually going to be publishing on it as opposed to researching a lecture or a seminar on it. There's a level of detail that I go into.
I haven't published on influenza, so that's an epidemic that I spend most of my time on secondary sources and less so of primary sources. But to get on to the second part of your question was directly I think ecologically and so yes, I do tend to, every epidemic doesn't fit neatly into those categories but I do tend to think that way. And I also think that epidemics move through history through ecological patterns.
Q. Let go back to the one you're not familiar with, the wheat one. I just like that
because I read some about that since I went to Colmar and it turned out there was a parasite in the wheat - -
A. Right:, a fungus on the wheat, I think.
Q. Yeah. And if they cooked it, heated it before they milled it, it went away so it got rid of the hospice that it had there. But from a - -
A. That would be a combination of a physical and cultural environment. The cultural environment is how they cooked the wheat.
Q. How else would you look at it?
Because as I understood it what I read about that part of the cultural environment is that the priests said that this was a, the malignancy or this, was some type of disease from God and you just to take it rather than look for a remedy. Would that be part of the culture?
A. Could be.
Q. Would you research that if you were researching that particular project?
A. Certainly.
Q. Would that be a primary source or a secondary source in your considered opinion?
were researching what historians had looked into and analyzed as parts of priestly behavior, that would be a secondary source. If it was some, if it was, you know, the actual priests' sermons to the parishioner, that would be a primary source.
Q. Okay. You have to have it translated from the Latin, I suppose. Do you speak Latin?
A. I took Latin in high school.
Q. Ha. Okay. The bubonic plague, for example, cultural aspects of the bubonic plague, there was -- I have read about they decided that Jewish people were carriers and the priest talked about that. Would you research that aspect, that red herring?
A. I would.
Q. In making an analysis, you would?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. And what would make your determination on these cultural types of information? What would you, how would you categorize it that you would think that that would be significant in your ecological analysis when you were defining an epidemic? What would you look -- I mean, just, I mean from a general standpoint?
know, I mean, that's an aspect of the cultural history of that disease I would look at.
The question is, would I use it in my course? I may or may not, depending on what points I have made; what I have made it with prior epidemics. Whether I would, you know, use scapegoating as a, you know, as for this epidemic or another epidemic really depends on, you know, how I was working on the course.
But certainly I would probably look at
it.
Q. Okay. Let's talk about rheumatic fever, since you have written so extensively on it. The disease is, let break it down the way you would if I was sitting in your class -A. That's what I --Q. -- almost failing.
MR. ROSENTHAL: There's no question pending. Is there a question?
Q. Well, yeah, I want to go through the analysis. The disease would be?
MS. FRANKEL: Objection to the form.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. Q. Okay, sir.
fascinating diseases that came into existence at the end of the 18th Century. And it largely rose to prominence during the course of the 19th Century, and then ameliorated and largely disappeared in the 20th Century. So part of it is the story of a rise and fall of a disease.
The reasons for that I think are many. One is I think the nature of the disease changed biologically; and that has to do with the streptococcus, which is sort of an instigator of that disease.
Rheumatic fever has a heart component, it has had a skin component, it has a favor component, it has a sore throat component, it has an arthritis component. And streptococcus has different chemicals in it that have been added along the historical path to account for the changing nature of the disease.
So what my book was is chronologically how the disease rose in prominence as it varied, how it disappeared, and try to connect it with the biology.
Q. The population would be the population of the United States?
have to do in history, you have to limit the scope. I mean, rheumatic fever has existed in many parts of the world. It is mostly a disease that occurred in sort of temperate areas of the globe; but I would -- I chose to tell the story in America and Britain.
Q. Okay. And the physical environment, how would you describe that? Or does that evolve over the course of the change in the disease, or the microbes, however you want to describe it?
A. Because the streptococcus is the instigator of that disease, it tended to be a disease of proximity. And so it is largely a disease of slums and poverty.
Q. It was airborne?
A. Yeah, coughing. Could also be touching, put your finger on your face and touch someone else.
Q. Now the fourth element, the cultural environment, how would you define that, that aspect of it?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. In rheumatic fever?
Q. Yes, sir.
hospitals because that was the, the institution where these children went who were very sick. It had partly to do with the technological history, because heart disease was detected with a stethoscope. So that required a history of when stethoscopes were introduced, how they were used, how their results were interpreted.
Q. Would you research in the cultural aspect different modalities of treatment? Red herrings, if you will.
A. We always had to make choices. I, I have some in my book. I mean, things that seem a little peripheral now but were important at the time, yes.
Q. How would you make a determination as to what alleys to run down in researching a particular epidemic, particularly with the cultural aspects?
A. I think you sort of go where the leads take -- I go where the leads take me. Where they end, how it is defined. It is hard, it is hard to make a general rule,
Q. You agree it would be important on a cultural aspect if you felt when you are reading it that it had an impact on the subject population and
perhaps it kept the disease going for a longer period of time because they were treating it in a wrong fashion?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I might do that, yeah.
Q. What other historians employed this ecological viewpoint of, I suppose it is of, epidemics?
A. I really can't come up with a list of them. One of the people who has done this prominently is Alfred Crosby. He is someone who has looked at epidemics of European diseases in the New World. He's also written on the influenza epidemic that we spoke on.
Q. Where is that professor located?
A. University of Texas.
Q. Would you say he was one who divined this particular theory?
A. No, I don't; I'm not sure who particularly did it. Another influential book was I believe Neil's Plagues and People has a similar approach in that.
Q. When did you start employing this approach?
I have done -- I have used it throughout my since I have been teaching the history of disease.
Q. So you were exposed to this prior to your dissertation?
A. Some of it, yes.
Q. That would have been at Duke?
A. Yes, yes, as a graduate student.
Q. Have you ever written anything specifically on this particular methodology of analysis?
A. There are elements of it in my book on rheumatic fever and in my book on lead poisoning.
Q. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you?
A. In my book on lead poisoning, introductory chapters of each.
Q. Would you list for me what you consider to be secondary sources in research? In your opinion as a historian, what would you look at for secondary sources as a historian if you were going to begin a research project?
A. I would go to some of the standard indexes and look at what other historians had written.
Q. When you say, "standard index," can you give me, we're not talking going to Google and
punching a button and see what is there? Maybe we are.
A. I think that we maybe are coming closer to that. One of the things that I --
Q. But then you are letting some computer geek decide what is important and what isn't.
A. That's true. That's one of the limitations. There's an up side to using computer indexes, and there's a down side. The up side is if you take a complicated 2 0th Century problem there might be tens or maybe hundreds of thousands of studies. The idea of trying to get a comprehensive view of that is hard to do in some cases without the use of computer tools.
But certainly, I have learned that sort of the hands-on study, one of the things I would turn to is Index Medicus for biological, something with medical topics would be one of the ways to get a handle on certainly the primary source materials.
The secondary source materials, there are bibliographies in the history of medicine that would be places where I would go to start.
Q. If you started there and you started picking out different sources to take a look at
these primary sources, how would you categorize those for me?
A. How would I identify them?
Q. Yes.
A. Okay. Well, in medicine, medicine I think is probably one of the most carefully indexed bodies of knowledge and Index Medicus in there country began cataloging primary sources in medicine from 1879 onward.
That's where I would go as a starting point for primary sources.
Q. And would you give me a list -- I know it would be exhaustive -- of what you would consider to be primary sources as a historian?
A. Depend on the topic. If I'm looking at a particular person, I would look to see what that person had published. If I was looking at a particular institution, I would look to see what was going on within that institution. If I was looking at a particular disease, I would look at what people had published about that particular disease.
Q. And when you talk about that, we get back to the four aspects?
A. Generally- Generally, that's how I often think of, yes.
Q. Now suppose one of the aspects -- we were talking about this, with the bubonic plague or with the wheat disease -- a priest's sermon as a primary source. You might be able to read it because you can read some Latin.
Where would you find, how would you get to that in your research techniques? Would that be something that you would be reading, say, a primary source of a book of history about that and there would be a footnote and you would go there, or how would you arrive at that?
A. Well, there, historic interest in bubonic plague -- we're not talking about --Q. We can talk about -A. In bubonic plague the historic interest in that has been so immense there are separate bibliographies dealing just with that and that's how would you identify that.
Q. So you would find the cultural aspects from that. Let's make it smaller, let's make it the cultural aspects of influenza, for example. Perhaps you want to read about newspaper articles, articles where people who have quick fixes, snake
oil salesmen, that kind of thing. Where would you discern out at least some of those topics for you to decide whether it would be fruitful for you to continue that research?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. If you are interested in newspapers, in the case of influenza epidemic we can date it precisely. And so with the newspapers, it would be going to libraries that have those newspapers -- or if they now are on line, doing it that way -- and looking through the newspapers either electronically or manually for the dates that you are interested in.
Q. Okay. But I'm looking more you have decided upon a topic, this wheat topic I'm talking about, and you're researching it and you -A. Well, the wheat topic -MR. ROSENTHAL: Wait until there is a question pending.
THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.
Q. You can continue with your thought, professor.
A. Well, the means of doing research for something in the 16th Century is very different than the means of doing research on something in
the 20th Century. We're flipping back and forth there; there's a difference.
My personal research has been done in the late 19th/early 20th Century so I have much more specific knowledge about how that goes about than going into rural France or Germany in the 16th Century.
Q. Okay. What I'm interested in, and maybe you can help me clear it up, is you have an aspect of your ecological analysis which is this cultural analysis. You begin researching. And how does something come to your attention in a medical index which may be culturally important unless you have some type of predetermined idea that you are going to look somewhere else at the same time?
MS. FRANKEL: Objection to the form.
A. Sometimes cultural aspects will come even in the medical indexes like Index Medicus. Because there will be an article written on let's say rheumatic fever in the poor of New York City that will be in a medical journal. And in looking at that article, you can see descriptions of how children with this particular disease were living, what social workers or physicians discovered when they visited the homes, and that kind of thing.
Q. Would you find -A. There's not a category of cultural, you have to get into the documents and see what's there.
Q. What if you found a newspaper article, for example, that said. Everybody that has influenza, come to this particular hospital, we're going to wash your hands with alcohol and make you better. And you also knew that two weeks later there was an outbreak of influenza because everybody went to one spot and they coughed on each other. Would you find that interesting, something you may follow up?
A. I might. I might.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. Q. A part of the cultural impact, of course, would be the public awareness of the public of what people knew about the diseases that they were being inflicted upon?
A. Yes, I think so.
(Interruption in the proceedings, electricity fails.)
Q. I'm fine with, we can go a couple more minutes but I'm fine with taking our break now, my stomach always starts to rumble around 12:00
anyway. Then we can finish up in the afternoon.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Is that okay with you?
THE WITNESS: Fine with me.
MR. ROSENTHAL: It's your deposition.
MR. FINE: I mean, I don't want to start and then lose the next 15 minutes?
MR. VERNON: Are you stopping because you think there might be a technical problem? Looks like it is growing.
MR. FINE: Well, typically I would stop in about 10 minutes.
MR. VERNON: It's Duke Power, you're aware they're stopping -MR. FINE: But typically I would stop in about 10 minutes; but if we're going to flicker on and off, maybe we ought to just have lunch and come back.
THE WITNESS: If you are going to be at a stopping point in 10 minutes why don't we just do that and pick up on another topic perhaps.
(Discussion off the record.)
BY MR. FINE:
Q. Presently in your methodology, I'll ask you again, maybe because I keep on asking you
questions in between: Your primary sources would be the indexes. Your secondary sources would be -and I'm just asking you to list what you would look at for secondary sources.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form* MS. FRANKEL: Objection to the form.
Q. You can just list it just generally.
A. You mean which bibliographies I would look into? I'm a little --
Q. As a secondary source?
A. Yes.
Q. I'm sorry, I got that backwards. I mean as a primary source.
A. Okay.
Q. You have looked at the secondary sources, you have cited to me a couple of different indexes. How about primary sources?
A. Primary sources, what I would look at for medicine would be Index Medicus and the index catalog of the Surgeon General's library and various indexes dealing with the National Library of Medicine which I would give a very comprehensive view for the late 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.
If this was an epidemic that had a governmental component to it, I would look for
primary sources in the various indexes of governmental documents. Many -- some governmental documents are picked up in Index Medicus, some aren't. I would have to get into the epidemic in some.
If it had to do with a foundation or a particular voluntary group, I would go to that particular voluntary group or organization and look at the primary sources there.
If it had a public component there that I was interested in, I would look at newspapers and magazines. In some health concerns, there are even public opinion polls, I would look at that. The Gallup organization and the --Q. With that aspect -MR. ROSENTHAL: Are you done?
Q, I'm sorry.
A. Primary sources just mean firsthand accounts --
Q. I understand -A. -- and again, it depends on the nature of the problem who has the firsthand, the firsthand --
Q. These aspects, these last aspects you had indicated, would all have to do with, whether
it was Gallup polls or articles in newspapers, with communication with other individuals.
MR, ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
Q. A knowledge of awareness of certain things. Let's say for an influenza that there was an outbreak in this particular borrow, take care.
Is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. Right. There are all sorts of newspaper type accounts. I, I am not familiar about any public opinion poles about influenza in 1918; there may have been, but I'm just not personally aware of them.
Q. But I'm just saying that the basis of your looking at these particular aspects in your analysis of whether it is influenza or rheumatic fever or some other disease is the communication of the public awareness; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
Objection to the form.
A. I'm not sure entirely, I'm not sure I understand your question. Can you?
Q. Well, part of the basis, part of the cultural basis in any particular disease would be the, the not only the physical but the mental
communication between individuals -MS. FRANKEL: Objection.
Q. --is that correct?
MS. FRANKEL: Objection.
A. Yeah, I think that's part of it, yes.
MR. FINE: Okay. I think it's time that we take our lunch break.
MR. ROSENTHAL: That's fine. Do you want to agree upon meeting back at a time? MR. VERNON: 1:00.
MR. ROSENTHAL: That's fine with me.
Is that okay with you?
THE WITNESS: Uh-huh.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Okay.
{Lunch recess 11: 45 a.m. to 1:07
p.m. )
BY MR. FINE:
Q. Good afternoon, doctor.
A. Good afternoon.
Q. I think this morning you had discussed that you were retained as an expert in this case, the Brown case, about six months ago, maybe a little bit more, in the spring?
A. Yes.
Q. Is that correct?
A. I think that's right, yes.
Q. And Mr. Rosenthal was the individual who contacted you to be employed in this case?
A. Yes.
Q. And to that end, how many times have you met with Mr. Rosenthal?
A. We had a meeting on this case once for part of a day in July; and then we had had a meeting on this case yesterday afternoon.
Q. Now you have been meeting with Arnold Sc Porter attorneys pretty regularly for the past, what, two-and-a-half years?
A. Yes. I don't know what you consider regularly, but on many occasions.
Q. But only on two particular occasions did you chat about this case?
A. That is correct.
Q. Were you given any materials to review for this case by your counsel?
A. No.
Q. Did you discuss what you would be offered for, your expertise?
A. You mean what topics I would be --
Q. Yes, sir.
scientific and development of ideas about relations of smoking and disease and the public health community's response on that relationship,
Q. Okay. Let me ask you if this is a fair expression or an expression perhaps you even wrote of what you are being offered for in this case. Defendants made a submission of their particular experts and they state in your little block, "The development and state of medical knowledge of the relationship between cigarette smoking and disease. The Government's and the public health community's response to the evidence linking smoking to disease, including tobacco control efforts, public education campaigns regarding the dangers of smoking, and the regulations and restrictions concerning tobacco companies. About the public health community's considerations of potentially safer cigarette designs, including its consideration of tar and nicotine reductions. On matters raised in the testimony of other witnesses as well as the evidence upon which they rely."
Now that's what was submitted to us.
Is that a, is that your understanding of what you are being submitted for?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you write that?
A. Those particular words, no. But I, I understood that that was what was being asked of
Q. And to that end did you review anything for this case?
A. No.
Q. Pardon me?
A. No. Nothing specific for this case.
In the --
Q. Did you review the Complaint of this
case?
A. No.
Q. Did you review any depositions of this case? This is the Brown case.
A. I don't think so.
MR. ROSENTHAL: You mean, based on your memory.
A. I don't, I don't think I have read any Brown-specific depositions.
Q. Are you aware that this case is a case based upon the California business and professional code 17200 and/or 17500.
A. (Witness shakes head from side to
Q. You're shaking your head.
A. No.
Q. We have to go back to our rules, you have to use words, sir.
A. You're right.
I	am not aware of that, no.
Q. Are you aware that the Plaintiffs in this action, the class which the Plaintiffs seek to represent in respect to the business and professions code i3ection 17200 and 17500, are people who at the time they were residents in California smoked in California one or more cigarettes during the applicable class period and who were exposed to the Defendants' marketing and advertising activities in California? Are you aware of that?
A. In a general sense. I don't think I have had it read to me in so many words.
Q. And who would have read that to you?
A. I can't remember whether that was part of the July meeting or not. And it could have been James Rosenthal when he first talked to me about the suit.
Q. About this particular case?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you -- when you were given this task back in April, what were you requested to do?
A. Just what you read to me.
Q. Just what I read?
A. Right.
Q. And to that end, you did not take any documentation whatsoever from the case that's filed in California?
A. That's correct.
Q. So you reviewed -- you didn't review the Complaint?
A. No.
Q. You didn't review the Answer?
A. No.
Q. Is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. You didn't review any depositions of any witnesses?
A. I think some of the witnesses in this case have been witnesses in other cases; and what I don't know is that in some of these depositions were they the one for Brown-specific? I just don't have a recollection of that.
Q. Do you know which witnesses'
depositions you hcive reviewed in this case?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. As I said, I don't know. I don't think I have done any. But, for example, I believe David Burns is one of the witnesses on the Plaintiff side and I have read many deposition of his. I just what I can't remember is whether I read a Brown-specific one of his.
Q, Did you review any of the deposition for the Brown Plaintiffs?
A. Plaintiffs, no.
Q. Did you review any of the answers to interrogatories by the Brown Plaintiffs?
A. No.
Q. Answers to the interrogatories by any of the Defendants in this particular case?
A. No.
Q. Did you review any motions for production?
A. What's a motion for production?
Q. I'm sorry. Did you review any documents that were produced by the Plaintiffs?
A. No.
Q. Did you review any documents that were produced by the Defendants?
A. I, I, no, I don't think so.
Q. In this particular case?
A. No.
Q. Did you review any internal corporate documents in this particular case?
A. No.
Q. How much have you billed so far since April for the Brown case?
A. I have, I have probably worked maybe
2	0 hours on Brown.
Q. Is that counting the three hours this morning and the three-hour meeting you had?
A. It could be. I haven't actually totalled it up; but it is in the ballpark of 20. Yes, that would include that.
Q. That would include this morning, that would include yesterday?
A. Yes.
Q. So prior to yesterday you worked approximately 14 hours on this particular case?
A. That's correct.
Q. Out of that 14 hours you had a meeting with Mr. Rosenthal in July?
A. I did.
Q. How long did that meeting take?
A. About two hours.
Q. So that's 12 hours you worked on this case. And then initially in April you had worked on this case when you spoke to Mr. Rosenthal briefly?
A. Well, I'm not counting that.
Q. Okay. Now that 12 hours, did you compile any type of information whatsoever?
A. During the meetings?
Q. Not during the meetings, during the 12 hours that you were working on this case.
A. No.
Q. What did you do for the 12 hours you billed as an expert?
A. I read over my expert reports in other cases and I thought.
Q. Which other cases, sir?
A. Department of Justice and Miles.
Q. And what else?
A. That's all I did.
Q. Did you do any further research?
A. No.
Q. We had delivered to us some time after December 14th by Mr. Cafferty what is known as reliance documents, which would be documents that
you are relying upon here today. And did you compile these reliance documents for Mr. Cafferty to submit to us?
A. I worked with Mr. Rosenthal on the reliance list.
Q. When did you do that?
A. Some of the -- I mean, the reliance list began for the, the Blue Cross case; and as I have done additional work, it has been added to.
So there were materials added for the Swartz case, the Bullock case, the Miles case, and other documents that I have looked at.
Q. This particular case you did no additional research over the past six months?
A. That's correct.
Q. Eight months?
MR. FINE: Would you mark this.
(Deposition Exhibit No. 3286 marked
for identification.)
Q. Doctor, I, contained within the -- and we're going to need a copy of that back -contained within the reliance documents was a document that says, "California reliance documents."
A. Uh-huh.
Q. Did you compile that?
A. I think these are the materials that I compiled in working for the Bullock case.
Q. And what kind of case is the Bullet
case?
A. Bullock.
Q. I'm sorry, Bullock?
A. That's a smoker case.
Q. That's the $28 billion case that is now $28 million?
A. I believe that's one way to characterize it.
Q. Okay. You were an expert witness in that case, right?
A. I was deposed in that case, I did not
testify,
Q. And that case was a personal injury
case?
A. I think that's correct.
Q. And this case is an advertising case. But you didn't supplement any of your list there with any type of advertising references; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. That is correct.
Q. Okay. May I have that back?
What is your understanding of the
Brown case?
A. I don't have a firm understanding of what the case is.
Q. You don't have a firm understanding as to what the Brown Plaintiffs are seeking?
A. I don't know they are seeking.
Q. You don't -- do you have any idea as to what the damages are that the Brown class has, has posited?
A. I do not.
Q. The opinion that you are offering today, based upon the 12 hours of work, past work, is based upon your prior case work and in these other cases; is that correct? Not Brown?
MS. FRANKEL: Objection to the form.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form,
A. Is based on the research I have done on tobacco and health that go back many years. But I have not done specific work on the Brown case.
I don't want to quibble on this, I just want to —
Q. No, I think it is real clear that you have told us today that you don't know anything
about Brown.
A. That's correct.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, misstates
the testimony.
Q. Is that correct?
A. Other than what you have read to me.
Q. What I read to you from the Complaint?
A. That's correct.
Q. You said you believe Mr. Rosenthal may have read you that paragraph; is that correct?
A. I believe that's correct, yes.
Q. Now this California-specific, "California English Reliance List," Plaintiff's Exhibit 3286, you didn't type that?
A. No.
Q. Okay. Have you reviewed it before
today?
A. I generated the list based on my research in preparation for the Bullock case, B-U-L-L-O-C-K, case.
Q. And that was when?
A. I think I generated that list probably about a year ago, so the end of 2001.
Q. So this list was generated not for today but for a case that you were working on prior
to you even being retained in the Brown matter; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. That is correct.
Q. Okay. Do you use in your research capabilities any of the web sites, like tobacco.org, or the Minnesota depository, or Philip Morris, or any of the web sites at all?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. As a general, no. I have visited the Philip Morris web site but the -- and I'm aware of the others. But as a general rule, I don't use them.
Q. So as such today what we are talking about when I get around to asking you what your opinion is it is not actually an opinion about the Brown case but in actuality your opinion about the subject matter that you said was correct from your submittal to us; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I'm not sure I understand the question.
Q. You have no Brown -- you don't know what the Brown case is about?
A. That's correct.
Q. You don't know what the advertising case is about; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. That is correct.
Q. You don't know about the damages that the Brown folks suffered because of the advertising -- the market; is that correct?
A. That is correct.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
Q. You have never been briefed as to what the gist of the statute was by counsel, 17200 or 17500?
MS. FRANKEL: No.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
Q. Those numbers are alien to you?
A. That is correct.
Q. Okay. You don't know what the particular issues are in the Brown case that have been litigated and they have not been brought to your attention?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. What you are requested to do is basically -- not basically, but it is to tell us what your research has indicated in either the Blue
Cross case or the Bullet case - - am I saying it right?
A. Bullock.
Q. I'm sorry. The Bullock case and then recounted for here; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. And the other research I have done. I mean, I have done more than just --
Q. Okay, the research in Haynes?
A. And the Department of Justice.
Q. And the Department of Justice?
A. And Miles and other cases that I have been involved in.
Q. Okay. But in the past year you have not in any fashion reviewed anything which would have affected the class of people as I have defined in the Complaint in juxtaposition to your research?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. That is correct.
Q. Is this definition of -- I'm sorry.
Is this description of your opinion that I have recited to you at the beginning of our session essentially the same description that was given in the Bullock case?
a copy we can mark as an exhibit.
MR. FINE: Yeah, we can mark it as an exhibit.
A. I don't remember precisely.
MR. ROSENTHAL: These are Pages 4 and 5 of the Epstein declaration in support of joint expert designation; and it contains the disclosure number 8, which relates to Peter English.
(Deposition Exhibit No. 3287 marked for identification.)
MR. ROSENTHAL: You have, for the record, you are in fact correct, it does say $250 an hour, that's a mistake. It also says he is a female. It refers to it says "her rate," I think. Obviously, you are a male and -MR. FINE: We haven't gotten that far in the deposition yet. (Laughter) He's a doctor, he knows there's a whole broad spectrum here.
THE WITNESS: Hourly fee, oh, "for her services."
MR. ROSENTHAL: "For her services."
MR. FINE: Well, we stand corrected.
At the beginning, you corrected us, it is not 250, it is 3 50.
MR. ROSENTHAL: That's our mistake.
MR. FINE: No problem, that's no problem.
THE WITNESS: I forget, you had a question about this?
BY MR. FINE:
Q. Is that the same description of your testimony, expert testimony -A. It is very -- sorry.
Q. --as was used in Bullock and/or the Blue Cross case and/or the DOJ case?
A. It looks like it is very close. We have to put it word-for-word. But should I read this one out loud just for the record?
Q. Well, I think it is the same one I have already read.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I was tracking you and you were taking out the words in terms to testify, but it is -- it's in the record.
Q. Why don't you take a look at that just to sort of refresh your recollection.
A. (Witness peruses document.)
And out of that 12 hours you said you read two expert disclosures that you have made and you thought about things.
A. {Nods head up and down.) That's
correct.
Q. That's it?
A. Uh-huh. Yes.
Q. You spoke to counsel. And that's it. Did counsel show you any documentation in preparation for today's testimony?
A. No.
Q. Doctor, you have an opinion, an expert opinion, based upon not the information in the Brown case but the information that you have researched; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. That is correct.
Q. And in fact, the information that I'm going to be asking you for, you have no idea whether it has any relevance, you personally, in the Brown matter?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I don't know the specifics in the Brown case. I would anticipate that the, the relevance would be that smoking and health and
public health stories are similar in various parts of the country based on my research. But I have not looked at Brown-specific documents, that is correct.
Q. Again you have no -- you don't have any idea as to how helpful or nonhelpful this case and your testimony would be to Plaintiffs or Defendants; is that your testimony here today?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form,
mischaracterizes his testimony.
A. As I say, I haven't read the material so I don't really know how helpful it would be.
Q. Have you gone over, prior to today, your opinion with counsel?
A. On those issues that we read?
Q. Yes, sir.
A. Yes.
Q. Do that yesterday?
A. I have done it in the past.
Q. Okay. Did you do it yesterday?
A. No.
Q. Did you do it in July?
A. I, I don't believe I went through it in July either,
first chatted?
A. No.
Q. So counsel has not vetted your opinion in the Brown case at any time; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. Well, counsel knows my opinions on all of those subjects in the discussion of other cases, so I think he's well-informed on them.
Q. Well, he knows the opinion but not in the Brown case; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. That is correct.
Q. And in fact, in the other cases -say, for example, in the Bullock case, that's a personal injury case. Do you have any idea as to whether this is a personal injury case?
MS. FRANKEL: Objection, asked and
answered.
A. I think you told me it is a class
case.
Q. It is a class case. But you don't know what the damages are in the case?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. No. I mean, you did tell me a little bit about the class when you read it a moment ago,
but that' s . . .
Q. Okay. This opinion that you have, based on your research prior to the Brown matter and based upon your submission in this case -- I want to take a break for a minute, okay? Can we take a break?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Sure.
(Recess taken.)
Q. Doctor, do you request any materials from counsel you need to review in this case?
A. No.
Q. Do you think it would have been helpful to have something to review in this case so far as couching your opinion for the Brown matter?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form,
calls for a legal conclusion.
Q. You can answer the question, sir.
A. I did not request any. I suspect that, as the case goes forward if there are documents or opinions that are expressed by experts, Plaintiffs experts, I may be asked to respond to those documents or opinions.
Q. Today is the day for your opinion.
Are you telling me that today your opinion really isn't formed on the Brown matter and that at
another time, ones; you receive documentation, that your opinion may change dependent upon what you have reviewed?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, mischaracterizes his testimony and calls for a legal conclusion.
Q. You can answer.
A. Well, I think the last paragraph of what you mentioned there did have the proviso in there that I might be asked to respond to experts' opinions on the Plaintiffs ' side. And I assume that I will have -- I might have opinions about documents introduced at trial. But I'm here to discuss the, with you, the opinions based on my research.
Q. That you testified to over a year ago prior to reviewing any information in the Brown case?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, mischaracterizes his testimony.
A. Well, I mean, my testimony is over a year ago. But, of course, I have been deposed several times this year and that's a matter of, of record.
issues in the Brown case, such as addiction -MR. ROSENTHAL; Objection, calls for a legal conclusion.
Q. -- that is not a matter in the Brown case? Do you realize that?
MR. ROSENTHAL; Objection to the form. A. As I say, I haven't read it, the material related to the Brown case.
MR. FINE: I'm objecting to his testimony as premature. I will continue with his deposition; however, I will advise my co-counsel as to the premature taking of an expert who in fact has no opinion as to the matter before him but has an opinion as to a matter he has testified to previously. And we'll take that matter as it will.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Obviously, I oppose the objection.
MR. FINE: Sure, okay.
MR. ROSENTHAL: So the record is clear, you're mischaracterizing what he said. He has done his historical research; he has opinions on historical issues that are relevant to this case.
MR. FINE: Are you going to testify?
MR. ROSENTHAL: No, but you are making -MR. FINE: No, his testimony stands for itself.
MR. ROSENTHAL: You're mischaracterizing his testimony.
MR. FINE: I'm not mischaracterizing anything. You can strike whatever characterization you would like. His testimony stands the way it is and that's what's going to be brought before Judge Prager.
MR. ROSENTHAL: We obviously oppose the motion.
MR. FINE: That's fine.
BY MR. FINE:
Q. Sir, have you ever reviewed a document, a 1956 memorandum from the Vice President of Philip Morris Research & Development, informing the top executives of the company regarding the advantages of ventilated cigarettes, which stated that: "Decreased carbon monoxide and nicotine are related to decreased harm to the circulatory system. As a result of smoking, decreased irritations is desirable as a partial elimination
of a potential cancer hazard."
Have you ever read a document like
that?
A. Do you have a copy of the document?
Q. I can provide a copy of the document. Have you ever read a document like that?
A. I can't say whether I have or not just from what you have quoted to me.
Q. Do you have a recollection of reading the document, a 1958 memorandum sent to the Vice President of Research at Philip Morris?
MS. MOORE: Objection to this line of
questioning, lack of foundation.
Q. Okay. Who later became a member of the board of directors from a company researcher stated, "Evidence is building up that heavy cigarette smoking contributes to lung cancer either alone or in association with physical or physiological factors."
Do you have any recollection of reading a 1988 memorandum such as that?
A. You're going to have to give me the document to look at.
Q. Do you have any recollection at all of ever seeing a document like this?
A. I have seen many documents. I don't know whether that's one I have seen or not, I can't tell you.
Q. Has a document like that been factored into your opinion?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. I don't know what that document is.
Q. Have you read a 1961 document presented to the Philip Morris Research & Development committee by the company's Vice President of Research & Development including a section entitled, "Reduction of carcinogens and smoke?
MS. MOORE: Objection, lack of foundation.
Q. Noted. That document stated in part: "To achieve this objective will require a major research effort because carcinogens are found in practically every class of compounds. The best we can hope for is to reduce a particularly bad class of class, i.e., the polynuclear hydrocarbons or phenols - -
MR. ROSENTHAL: Are you done with your question.
Q. "Flavor substances and carcinogenic substances come from the same classes in many instances."
Do you recall ever seeing a document
like that?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Before you answer, do you know, any of the documents you are reading, are any of these documents Bliley documents or documents that any tobacco company would claim privilege to?
MR. FINE: Keith?
MR. VERNON: Do I think any of them are? It very well may be. Although I don't know for certain, I'm not even quite sure what set he is reading from. If I look at the source?
He is reading from documents cited in the Complaint, which is public record; so I would imagine not. But I can't say one way or the other.
MS. FRANKEL: The fact that it is a public record does not mean it is not a confidential document that we assert confidentiality over.
such a privilege, I don't know.
MR. ROSENTHAL: There are documents that, whether or not they are available on the Internet, various tobacco companies still claim privilege to.
MR. VERNON: Then you should -MR. FINE: Wait. I'm asking if he relied upon these documents.
MR. ROSENTHAL: No, I understand the question. Right now I'm not talking about the question. I'm talking about reading of documents that we cannot tell, based on the reading, whether or not these are documents for which we claim privilege.
MR. VERNON: I'm not -- I guess you should say you assert that general privilege then to the extent any of these documents are Bliley documents.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Certainly since you have not afforded us the opportunity to review the actual documents from you are reading, to the extent that we -- any tobacco company -- claims privilege to any of these documents we continue to assert that.
We are in no way waiving the privilege by listening to the reading of these documents; and to the extent that we later determine that any of these documents are in fact privileged, we would move to have this deposition be put under seal.
MR. FINE: Counsel, you did receive the Complaint in this case, right? That's what I'm reading from.
MS. FRANKEL: We understand, and Reynolds joins in that objection and we understand he's reading from the Complaint.
MS. MOORE: Can we also have on the record a joint stipulation that any motion or - -
MR. FINE: We did that already.
MS. MOORE: -- made on behalf of -MR. FINE: We did that already.
MS. MOORE: -- is for all Defendants?
MR. ROSENTHAL: We asked him about that, Kellie, we got it,
BY MR. FINE:
Q. Have you ever seen a document and incorporated this into your opinion: A 196 3 memorandum to Philip Morris' President and CEO from
the company's Vice President of Research.
Describes a number of classes of compounds in cigarette smoke which are known carcinogens. The document goes on to describe the link between smoking and bronchitis and emphysema. 11 Irritation problems are now receiving greater attention because of the general media belief that irritation leads to chronic bronchitis and emphysema. These are serious diseases involving millions of people. Emphysema is often fatal either directly or through respiratory complications. A number of experts have predicted that the cigarette industry ultimately may be in greater trouble in this area than in the lung cancer field."
Have you ever read a document like
that, sir?
A. I don't know whether or not I have.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. You'd have to show me the document.
Q. I can't -A. If you could show me the documents, I might be able to answer your questions.
Q. Well, originally you said that you did not read any internal memos from the tobacco industry.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection,
mischaracterizes his testimony.
Q. Is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
A. I don't remember if you asked me that question at all today.
Q. Yes, I did.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. In my comprehensive research I did not research company documents, documents. However in my participation in these cases in the last several years I have seen a fair number of company documents that have been produced by Plaintiffs.
And I can't tell from the, the summaries and snippets that you are giving me here whether that's a document I have seen or not.
Q. Doctor, can you tell me within reasonable medical certainty whether smoking causes lung cancer?
A. Sitting here in 2002?
Q. Yes, sir, from this advantage point of
2002 .
A. I certainly think smoking causes lung cancer. I think the public health community has --
MR. ROSENTHAL: Let the witness
answer.
Q. We'll get to public health.
A. In 2002, yes, I think that smoking causes lung cancer.
Q. How about in 2000, your opinion?
A. 2 000 smoking caused lung cancer.
Q. 1995,, your opinion?
A. Same.
Q. Same opinion. 1990, your opinion?
A. Same.
Q. 1980, your opinion?
A. Same.
Q. 1970, your opinion?
A. Same.
Q. Within a degree of reasonable medical certainty does smoking cause emphysema, vantage point of 2002?
A. Yes, I, I believe it does, or contributes to it. I think emphysema is a little bit more complicated problem than smoking, but certainly smoking contributes to it.
Q. How about the year 2 000, does it contribute to emphysema?
Q. Yes -A. Yes.
Q. --in the year 2000 within reasonable medical certainty. How about 1995 within reasonable medical certainty, under those standards?
A. I certainly did, yes.
Q. 1990, reasonable medical certainty, smoking causes or is associated with?
A. As a physician?
Q. Yes, sir.
A. I think I probably believed that in 19 90, yes.
Q. 1980?
A. I don't remember.
Q. Okay, Within a degree of reasonable medical certainty, vantage point of 2002, is smoking hazardous to your health?
A. 2002?
Q. Yes, sir.
A. As a physician?
Q. Yes, sir.
A. Absolutely.
Q. 2000?
Q. Within a degree of reasonable medical certainty smoking hazardous to your health in 1995?
A. Absolutely.
Q. 1990, sir?
A. Absolutely.
Q. 1980, sir?
A. Absolutely.
Q. Within a reasonable degree of medical certainty does smoking cause heart disease, vantage point of 2002?
A. It is complicated in heart disease because there are multiple risk factors, but yes, I believe that, yes.
Q. How about year 2000, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty based upon your --
A. Yes.
Q. -- opinion as a physician?
A. Did I?
Q. Yes, sir.
A. Yes.
Q. How about 1995?
A. Yes.
Q. 1990?
Q. 1985?
A. I can't remember what I thought in
Q. Let's go back to the Complaint. Continuing to read from Paragraph 54: "A document from Brown & Williamson and its parent company, BATCo, researched the health effects of nicotine and were aware early on as reported at a BAT group research conference in November 1970 that nicotine may be implicated in the etiology of cardiovascular disease."
Have you ever seen a document like
that, sir?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. MS. MOORE: Objection, lack of foundation.
MR. FINE: Noted.
Q. You can answer, sir.
A. That's someone writing a description of a document? Because that's not -- that don't sound like an actual document that we're...
MR. ROSENTHAL: If you're going to read from the Complaint, do you have a copy so he can at least read -MR. FINE: I don't have an additional
copy. I can allow you to read but I need
it back.
A. I don't know if that's going to help me, because I need to see the document before I could comment on the document. I mean, because you are not even saying from whom the document is.
Q. It is from Brown & Williamson.
A. But who? Did they -- see, I don't
have --
Q. You don't recollect ever seeing a document like that?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I don't know whether I have or not.
Q. If you saw a document like that, you'd think it would have been provided by Plaintiffs' counsel during a deposition?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
MS. FRANKEL: Objection, speculation.
A. It would have been produced in one of these cases most likely by Plaintiffs whether at deposition or at trial.
Q. And that's because you did not research personally any internal corporate memoranda; is that correct?
Q. Of the tobacco companies?
A. As a general rule, yes* The internal documents -- the most part the internal documents I have seen, company documents, have come from Plaintiffs.
Q. From Plaintiffs? Never from the
defense?
MR. FiOSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A.	There have been, there have been some specific cases where I have, I have asked for some documents. Let me give you an example.
In the Blue Cross case there were 11 facts alleged that the companies had which were not known to the public health community at the time that the companies had these facts. And there were three that were of a historical nature; and so I asked for some, some documents that provide background for those -- investigating those particular issues.
And so in cases like that, I have seen internal documents that I have specifically requested. But in the sense it was generated by Plaintiffs, because they were Plaintiffs' allegations.
memorandum from the consulting research firm hired by Liggett to do research for the company states, 'There are biologically active materials present in cigarette tobacco. These are: A, cancer causing;
B,	cancer promoting; C, poisonous; D, stimulating, pleasurable and flavorful.'"
Have you ever seen that document
before?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
MS. MOORE: Foundation.
A. Again I have to see the regular document. But that particular one and that particular phrasing was used in the individual depositions in the Blue Cross case, so I'm fairly certain that I have seen that document.
But again, it is, without the actual document in my hands and having had a chance to review it, I can't say.
Q. And finally: "A 1963 memorandum from Liggett consulting firm, research firm, states, 'Basically we accept the inference of a causal relationship between the chemical properties of ingested tobacco smoke and the development of carcinoma which is suggested by the statistical association shown in the studies of Doll and Hill,
Horn and Dorn with some reservations and qualifications, and even estimated by how much the incidence of cancer may possibly be reduced if the carcinogenic matter can be diminished, by an appropriate filter, by a given percentage.'"
Have you ever seen that document?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
MS. MOORE: Foundat ion.
A. My same response. Though I have read the Doll Hill and the specific published scientific documents that are; mentioned in there. But again, without the document in front of me or any more identifying materials than you gave me, I can't say whether I read it or not.
Q. When is the last time you took a look at industry internal documents?
A. I can't remember if I was shown some in my deposition for the Department of Justice or not.
Q. When would that deposition have been?
A. August of this year.
Q. August of this year. And prior to that time?
A. I think I looked at some in preparation for the Swartz case that I did not
testify in, and I believe I saw some in the Bullock case.
Q. But the testimony you are talking about in those two instances would only have been provided by Plaintiff?
MR. FiOSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
Q. Or would they have been your own independent research?
A. Those are Plaintiff documents. I
believe.
Q. So if the Department of Justice deposition of yourself has no documents, no internal industrial documents, then you haven't looked at any internal industrial documents for almost two years; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
Mischaracterizes his testimony.
A. I think I said I saw some in Bullock and I saw some in Swartz; that would be from this year.
Q. This year? Okay. But you have never done your own independent study of internal industry documents?
A. No, I have not.
Q. Okay. As a physician in 1970s, what did you do to combat RJR's denial that cigarette smoke caused lung cancer?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
MS. FRANKEL: Objection to the form.
A. What did I do?
Q. Well, you're a pediatric physician; you must have some kind of stance on that.
A. Your question again?
Q. In the '70s, what did you do?
A. Do what? I'm sorry, I didn't hear your question.
MR. VERNON: Wait just a second.
Q. Well,, you have stated in the '70s you felt you believed as a physician that cigarette smoke caused lung cancer?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. And you also know that the tobacco companies, whether it was RJR or Philip Morris, denied that?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
MS. FRANKEL: Before you answer,
objection, lack of foundation.
MR. FINE: Okay.
A. You know, I haven't any systematic way to review what tobacco companies were saying about causation. I have some, I have some generalized, I have seen some documents that's the case, but you are asking specifically your initial question was what did I tell my patients about smoking?
Q. What did you do personally to combat
it?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form,
lack of foundation.
A. In the 1970s I wasn't putting myself in opposition to any particular statement anywhere. What I was doing to my patients was telling them not to smoke.
Q. Did they ever come to you and say, "Well, I saw this pretty keen advertisement from Kools or Winstons," or anything like that?
A. Never.
Q. Never showed that to you?
A. No.
Q. Did you have a sign in your office that said, "Don't Smoke"?
A. We've had "No Smoking” information. Whether it was a sign or a pamphlet, we have had it the whole time I have practiced.
Q. What did you do in the '80s to combat this particular denial?
MR. DRUMMOND: Objection.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form, lack of foundation.
A. Again, I'm not going to -- I didn't do anything to, in, in response to any, any particular statement by, by a tobacco company. What I did do was advise my patients not to smoke and I advised pregnant women who came to me before the baby was born not to smoke.
Q. Doctor, so I'm clear, you're a professor of medical history; is that correct?
A. That is correct.
Q, And you're taking the position today that you have no idea as to whether RJR or any other company, tobacco company, has ever denied that cigarette smoke causes cancer?
MS. FRANKEL: Objection.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form, misstates his testimony.
A. I didn't say that. I said that I never made a systematic study of tobacco company documents or statement as to the public.
to me along the way. I can sort of in a general sense answer, I mean, what tobacco companies were saying. But I haven't made a systematic -- done a systematic research in that way.
Q. Well, you felt very strongly that tobacco smoke caused cancer?
A. I did.
Q. And you are telling me today that you are not real sure when RJR finally admitted that tobacco smoke caused cancer?
MS. FRANKEL: Objection, lack of
foundation, mischaracterizes his testimony.
Vague.
MR. FINE: Noted.
A. I'm not sure what RJR.
Q. Ever?
A. I'm not certain, no.
Q. So if I asked you in the 1940s or 1950s whether RJR denied or Philip Morris denied that cigarette smoke caused any type of diseases you have no idea?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form,
mischaracterizes his testimony.
A. No, no. I said that I have made -- I have not made a systematic review of their -- in a
general sense I know what the tobacco companies tfere saying because I have come across --
Q. What is your opinion of what -MR. ROSENTHAL: Wait. You were talking over each other. Finish your answer.
A. Right. Because I have come across them in other research. But as a general view I think the tobacco companies recognized the statistics early on. Later in the '70s, they, they said that smoking was a risk factor in cigarette smoking but they denied that causation had been proved.
Q. When did they admit causation was proved, in your opinion?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. You know, I think they may still have some, some doubts about it; but I think on their current web sites that they acknowledge that smoking causes lung cancer.
Q. The last couple years?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. I'm not sure exactly when that happened.
statement that we had prefaced this afternoon session on but you don't have an opinion on the Brown matter; is that correct?
MR, ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form, calls for a legal conclusion.
MS. FRANKEL: Vague and unintelligible.
A. Which paragraph do I have the opinion on, is it the one you read me?
Q. I think it is exhibit -A. Right, I have opinions on the items that I have been asked to testify to --Q. Could I see that?
A. -- and the ones that you read me. And they are similar, it may be slight differences in the wording that appears.
Q. But you don't have an opinion about the Brown matter, any of the issues in the Brown matter?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form, vague, calling for a legal conclusion.
Q. Is that right?
A. I have not read any Brown-specific materials.
any Brown-specific: issues?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Same objections.
Q. Are you aware of any Brown-specific issues? Let's put it that way.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form, calls for a legal conclusion, vague.
Q. You may answer.
A. I think I have answered that question. I don't know what those issues are.
Q. What materials for the opinion you are going to express today have you reviewed?
A. I read the materials on my reliance
list.
Q. And that's it?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. My understanding is there are materials I have read in the Department of Justice case that are not on the reliance list.
Q. Have you read any materials concerning advertising?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. Ever? I mean, let me tell you --Q. That's going to contribute to your opinion here today?
systematic study of cigarette advertising. I have come across many cigarette advertisements and I have been particularly concerned about what the public health community was saying about cigarette advertising and I can speak to that.
Q. How about individuals, like the class that's being affected in the Brown case, do you have any idea how advertising affects them?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. No.
Q. No idea?
A. No.
Q. Positive or negative, you don't have a
clue?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I do not.
Q. Well,, doctor, based upon your studies and this opinion that you have, why don't you tell me what your opinion, what the opinion is?
MS. FRANKEL: Objection.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
Overbreadth.
A. On advertising?
Q. No, on what you are being offered here today, not for the Brown case but for this
development and state of medical knowledge. Why don't you tell me what the opinion is?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the character!zation.
A. Okay. That in the, in the first case that is in -- that the first hard scientific evidence relating smoking and disease began in 1950. That between 1950 and 1964, lines of evidence came from three different sciences -- the science of epidemiology, toxicology and experimental biology -- that related smoking with, with lung cancer.
That there was a controversy about that which eventually led to the Surgeon General forming a committee in 1962 that looked into the matter and resulted in the first Surgeon General's report in 1964, which, among other things, said that smoking was causally related to lung cancer in men.
Q. That is your opinion in this case?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form, mischaracterizes his testimony.
A. You asked me to go through there and that's, I can go into any level of detail that you want me to. I was giving you a shorter version.
Q. Well, why don't you -A. In the second sentence there, that the public health community in response to this information linking cigarette smoking with lung cancer began a -- responded with an overwhelming public health campaign. At least that's the first thing that they did, telling people not to smoke and to stop if they did. And as a third measure, if you couldn't stop or didn't want to stop, either smoke low tar cigarettes.
The second prong of the campaign was to encourage the development of low tar cigarettes because, based on research current at the time from a number of different sources, low tar looked like it might be a safer alternative for people who continued to smoke.
And the third prong was based on public opinion polls that the American people heard and understood what the public health community was telling them.
Q. The American public's awareness of what was going on is an important component in your opinion; is that correct?
A. It is an important component, yes.
research indicated a communication by the public health community; is that correct?
A. Well, public opinion polls represent sort of the bottom line of all the information that a person is receiving on this issue. So whether a person is getting the information from a kindergarten course on health or the American Cancer Society public service announcement or a cigarette ad or a government position paper or listening to the nightly news or whatever, the, what a public opinion poll measures is the bottom line of all that.
Q. And it is important for this to be communicated to the individual; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. This information?
Q. The information from the public health community -A. Yeah?
Q. --to the public?
A. Uh-huh. Yes. Well, yes. Then, of course, what an opinion poll measures is the success of that.
Q. And that impacts your opinion as to -that impacts your opinion, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. It does.
Q. Now would you classify the illnesses propagated by cigarette smoke as an epidemic? Can you analyze it that way?
A. I think you can, yes.
Q. And as such, using your previous analysis, the disease would be classified as what?
A. Lung cancer.
Q. Emphysema ?
A. Emphysema and heart disease get complicated because they are multifactorial. So you if you are using my model I use in my class --
Q. I'm going back, I'm cheating, I should have written it on my hand.
A. We should have a blackboard.
It becomes a little bit -- the ecological diagram becomes more complicated when you have eight factors as there are in heart disease where cigarette smoking is one. So it is simpler to do it with lung cancer.
Q. COPD?
A. The same issue, sort of the same issue as with emphysema. It is a multifactorial illness.
enough to smoke?
A. Would be smokers.
Q. Would the population include non-smokers?
A. Certainly as a part of the public health story that would pick up a little bit in the '70s and into the '80s, the issue of environmental tobacco smoke and the public health concerns about that would be part of the story, yes.
Q. How about people who haven't started smoking yet? Children, for example.
A. Well, you know, that's part of the environmental tobacco, you know, smoke story.
Q. Okay. Physical environment catalyst, how would you describe that, sir?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I'm not sure physical environment here is a catalyst.
Q. Okay. Well, I'll take back my word. "Physical environment," which is your words.
A. Yeah. Part of that has to do with the growing of tobacco plants and engineering of tobacco plants, and so I think it would play a role in that particular way.
tobacco and certainly the public health community was interested in, in engineering tobacco in different ways, especially after the 1950s.
Q. Finally, social and cultural environment. How would you define that in this particular case?
A. Well,, certainly the development of cigarette smoking would be one of particular cultural factor. The development of public health community's response to, to smoking and health issues; and I can go in and enumerate the public health community as I see it. Development of the scientific community and its, its response.
Q. The public health response -- again, we get back to that word "communication," don't we? it is the response to the population, it is what they do to make people know what's going on?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I think it is more complicated than
that.
Q. Okay. Well, then, tell me how you
view it.
A. I think part of the it is that the public health community has to become aware of the problem, has to begin to discuss it, has to reach
its own conclusions, and then has to communicate that to the, to the public. So I think communication is part of it but X don't think it is the total of it.
Q. And the rest of it would be as you just described, how they have to come to discern it?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I think it is how the public health community reaches a consensus. That they begin to identify a problem, come together, discuss the problem, reach a formulation and then communicate that.
Q. Now going with the social and cultural factor, I stopped you at a public health response and you were --
A. Right. And then I think there is a scientific response. I look at the public health community as that group making -- working with a policy and education. I think of the scientific community as that group of people in the laboratory trying to figure out some of these problems. I think I look at the medical community as the people who are treating at the level of the individual patient.
I think the media is part of the
response.
I think, in the case of smoking and health, governmental bodies have been very important, both at the local, state and federal level.
Q. So these are all elements that you would look into in defining this epidemic for descriptive purposes?
A. Yes.
Q. And for curative purposes, how would, would that be the last chapter of your book on rheumatoid fever or?
A. Rheumatic fever.
Q. Sorry, I didn't go to medical school, obviously.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
Q. But isn't that the logical outcome, you are going to have suggestions how perhaps the system could have been more streamlined or how care for the patient would have been better either communicated or received?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
Q. What would be your last chapter in that book?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. Well, I tend to write books in chronology so my last chapter would be the end year which I'm dealing with.
But of course there are public health responses all along the way. And so what I would do is I would chronicle the public health responses at each interval of the story.
I mean, there's no answer at the end. Historians don't look necessarily at the answers. And 2002 is the sum of the public health responses.
I mean, the public health community began responding to this issue in the 1950s and I would tell that story. The public health community responded in a big way in 1964 with a response to the Surgeon General's report and at different points along the way.
So I wouldn't have a curative chapter at the end; I would tell the story as it, as it emerged.
Q. What would be the end result of an epidemic in your opinion, the curing of the epidemic?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
just going to describe it and that's the end of that?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form,
mischaracterizes his testimony.
A. You know, I, diseases can go on. For example, I mean, we still have polio in certain parts of the world.
People -- you know, you can tell the story of the heart attacks. Looks like heart attacks are diminishing but you don't necessarily have to have no heart attacks before you can write the history.
I mean, I write on a certain capsulized period of time that makes sense.
Q. You reviewed documentation as to the scientific response which is one element contained within this cultural/social factor; is that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. In the scientific response you discussed the people that are in the labs trying to figure a way out of this?
A. Yes.
Q. And in our case, we could be talking about a way out of this cancer crisis?
A. I think the way the scientific specific communities that were dealing with this problem, let's say in the 1950s, were in the epidemiological community. And it had its own evolution in how it was dealing with this; I can give you the details if you wish.
The experimental biology community, those were people trying to produce cancer in the laboratory using tobacco products.
The third is the toxicological community, people looking for carcinogens in tobacco smoke and tobacco tar, I think that's the way the evidence emerged in this case.
Q. It would be interesting and helpful to you to review all the laboratory work during the '50s, '60s or '70s in coming to a particular appropriate description, conclusion or opinion as to the responses; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A, It would be hard to review all of the data simply because there is so much of it. Even for the publication of the first Surgeon General's report, for example, they reviewed 7,000 studies. That's a lot of studies. I checked on a web site, the Med Lines, a couple days ago. And like between
1964 and 2002 there are like 64,000 or 65,000 additional ones.
So you can't -- so a historian can't read all of them. That is typically not -- I can tell you how I selected them if that's?
Q. How did you select them?
A. What I did, when I went through Index Medicus, you can't do that electronically until the mid '60s. So I went through it month-by-month, year-by-year, looking at smoking and health and from a scientific point of view.
I also went through the bibliography of the first Surgeon General's report so I didn't miss anything that the Surgeon General's committee thought was important. And that's how I did that.
Q. Did you review any of the grants or papers written by CTR?
MS. FRANKEL: Objection.
A. Well, CTR, I forget when the name changed, are we talking about?
Q. Center for Tobacco Research.
A. Council for Tobacco Research.
Q. Council?
A. I think they changed their name in the '60s, I thought in the pre '64 era --
Q. Right.
A. Yeah, I have read the annual reports of the TIRC and I have read certainly some of their materials that were supported by them and I have made an analysis of cofunding of TIRC-sponsored research.
Q. And that would have been counterproductive for trying to solve -counterproductive against the public health response?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
MS. FRANKEL: Also vague.
A. I'm not sure I understand the question.
Q. Well CTR did many studies, none of which they published, as to cancer being caused by tobacco smoke.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A, I think between the Tobacco Industry Research Council and the Council On Tobacco Research, there are over 3,000 publications.
Q. That say cancer is caused by tobacco
smoke?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
all sorts of basic science reports in there. But these were all published, published in research --Q. Are any of those in your reliance document s, sir?
A. I think some of them are. I have never broken them out by whether they were TIRC-sponsored. I think some of them are there, but I can't, I haven't done that.
Q. Would those particular studies have had an influence on the impact of the public health response?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. I think the public health community was certainly very aware of what the TIRC-sponsored research was saying. They may, these bodies may well have incorporated that material into the public health message, I can't be --
Q. You have no idea how it affected the class of people in California; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form, Q. Any of the work that TIRC, CTR or TIB?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. That is correct.
Q. Okay. Now therefore it is not incorporated into your opinion?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. Well, wait a minute, that's not exactly --
Q. As to the people in California?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him finish.
A. Okay. I think I have, I do have a role. I mean, TIRC was an organization that existed in the '50s and the '60s; and so I have taken into account how that -- because so much of the research, virtually 75% of it, was cofunded by the U.S. Public Health Service or the American Cancer Society or the National Cancer Institute.
So I think the TIRC-based research was intimately involved in the, the public, you know, the scientific community.
Similarly, there's CTR research again was in the 60%, 70%, 80% cofunded by other groups in the public health and scientific community. So I think that that was, you know, was factored into what the scientific community was, was saying.
I know less well what the Tobacco Institute did because I didn't actually make a systematic study of Tobacco Institute documents.
counsel?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. No.
Q. Nobody ever told you you should look into this particular area or that particular area?
A. You know, I usually I generated the research questions, the documents, and then we would discuss them. Occasionally, counsel would raise an issue and say, Have you looked at this or that? I said, I might say no. They might provide me with a document. But this is largely Peter English-generated.
Q. Okay. So when you completed your engagement for this particular opinion you didn't feel that it was important for you to consider tobacco companies using this type of scientific evidence to rebut the public health concerns?
MS. FRANKEL: Objection.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
MS. FRANKEL: Vague. What scientific evidence you are talking about? What is "this"?
Q. You can answer it.
A. Well,, it is -- I don't know how to, how to begin to answer that.
published 3,000 articles. Are you talking about any particular article?
Q. Talking about the mass of articles.
A. The mass of articles?
Q. Being disinformation?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
MS, FRANKEL: Objection.
A. I don't think that's the case. I think you're wrong.
Q. You think mass of articles are appropriate information?
A. I think they were published by serious scientists in peer review publications; that they were cofunded by other serious scientific agents.
I think that the, that the TIRC-sponsored literature is, is, is good science.
Q, TIRC. And CTR, it is good science
also?
A. That part of CTR which is directed by the Scientific Advisory Board, yes.
Q. It is all good science. And you
have - -
A. I can't say, I haven't read all of them. But I --
MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him finish.
A. Let me finish.
Q. Yes, sir.
A. I based this on the fact that it was cofunded by contemporary scientific bodies of high repute.
Q. Or is it your opinion -- is it your opinion based upon the fact that they received funding from other scientific bodies, or is it your opinion that you have actually reviewed these items and you think it is good science?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I have not reviewed all of them. It is based on the fact that contemporary scientific bodies, no connection at all with the tobacco industry, gave them funding.
Q. Well, we get back to the same point.
Do you believe, not based upon who gave them money but upon the research that you reviewed, that it is good science, CTR?
A. I go back to my original statement that that's how I'm basing that opinion.
Q. You're basing it on the fact that other people gave them money so it must be good?
mischaracterizes his testimony.
A. And the fact that it was published in peer review journals.
Q. And you have also read these articles? A. Have not read all of them, no.
Q. Have you read half of them?
A. I can't tell what you percentage I have read.
Q. Have you read 100?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. 100?
Q. You said there were about 3,000, have you read 100?
A. I'm sure I have. I have never counted
them.
Q. Have you read a substantial amount?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. I can't give you a number.
Q. Okay. You said there was a massive public health response in the '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s that they made; is that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And the public health message was, don't smoke, it causes cancer?
the message that, that, after 1964. But even before that, there was a campaigns not to smoke, especially those by the American Cancer Society.
Q. And - -
A. So the message was, "Stop." "Don't start," and then a third tier message was, "If you must smoke, then smoke low tar."
Q. Okay. And considering that, the public health community was one particular community that was; disseminating information about smoking; is that correct?
A. Well, it is a very diverse community. It is not one.
There were attempts to coordinate it all, the National Interagency Council On Smoking and Health was an attempt to coordinate all the efforts. But it had many components not altogether in lock step -- although the message, even though from many different organizations, was very consistent. No one was arguing to the contrary.
Q. Now that's the public health community. And the public health community is trying to reach the public and make them aware of what the problem is; is that correct?
A. Yes. And they were successful in
ioing that.
Q. Well, but we also had a competitor to the public health community that's the tobacco industry; is that not true?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. As I say, I have not systematically reviewed tobacco industry statements but I have seen quite a few of them.
Q. Well, we have tobacco industry statements. You have seen some of them but you haven't reviewed them; is that correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. Could that have possibly impact on your opinion if you made a systematic review of their statements?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I think that the use of public opinion polls, which at the end nets the total sum of information that a person receives -- whether it is going to a coffee klatch run by the American Cancer Society volunteer or work, you know, workplace, whether they see an advertisement in the newspaper, whether they, you know, whether they -- some of them may even have read the Surgeon General's report. Whether --- at the end of the day that's
what public opinion polls demonstrate. And they demonstrate, you know, virtual total awareness and the belief of a steady increase of the American public hearing the public health message.
Q. Get back to my question.
A. But I mean my response --Q. My question -A. --to your question as I understand it is that, even though I haven't reviewed all company statements or TI statements, I think I can say what the net effect is because I'm using the public opinion polls.
Q. Well, if we use the public opinion polls we can talk about President Gore, so they're not always -A. What? I don't understand that.
Q. We would be talking about President Gore because that's who was winning right up to the day the final vote took place.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. Q. But let's talk about -A. I don't understand that question,
but...
Q. Okay. You're telling me that, regardless of your review of all company
statements, it wouldn't change your opinion based upon some Gallup polls you have reviewed?
A. I have reviewed all the Gallup polls from the 1940s to the late '90s.
Q. And have you read the questions in the Gallup polls?
A. I have.
Q. Have you read the raw data in those Gallup polls?
A. I have seen the raw data, yes.
Q. What other polls have you read?
A. I have read other polls that are cited in the Surgeon Generals' reports over the years.
Q. Now do you know what disinformation
is?
A. Disinformation?
Q. Yes, sir.
A. I assume it is information that is put out that is not correct.
Q. Okay. Have you read any of the advertising schemes for advertising to people in California?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I mean, I have seen advertisements in my research. I don't know which ads ran in
California, so I guess the answer to that is I would have to say no.
Q. Have you read any of the marketing budgets for California or nationally for any of the particular brands?
A. I have seen in the Surgeon Generals' reports figures about what the marketing budgets are in the general sense off and on but not in a systematic fashion.
Q. So you have never made an analysis of
that?
A. No.
Q. And you haven't included that in your
opinion?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. Q. An analysis of those marketing patterns?
A. No.
Q. You haven't included the analysis of the amounts of advertising by dollar figure as an impact on the public awareness, have you?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. MS. FRANKEL: Objection, lack of foundation.
A. Well, again, I think the public opinion poll takes that into effect. Because no matter what amount is being spend, at the end of the day a person being asked by the Gallup pollster is, "What do you think?" And so they may have looked at no ads; they may have looked at 10,000 ads; but it is whait their answer is, you know, what, what do they say? Do you believe that smoking causes lung cancer? Yes or no. Do you believe heart disease, yes or no.
Q. Have you ever heard the old saw that you speak with your pocketbook? You may tell the Gallup poll one thing while you are standing there smoking a Salem?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Is there a question?
MR. FINE: I'm asking him.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. Are you trying to say did smokers believe that smoking caused lung cancer?
Absolutely. The public health opinion polls said that they usually had a separate categories for smokers and non-smokers from the '4 0s on.
Q. Without reviewing the marketing, without reviewing the ad schemes, without reviewing all the advertisements in California or the Western
United States, you totally discount all of that and don't include it in your opinion?
MS. E'’RANKEL: Objection.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form,
mischaracterizes his testimony.
A. I think that the public opinion poll shows the net effect of all information that the people asked, are,, are exposed to.
Q. Have you ever read any polls for advertising as to how to advertise a program, for example, internally?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I'm not sure I understand the question.
Q. Have you ever seen any marketing schemes for, say, "No Bull" natural cigarettes?
MS. FRANKEL: Objection.
A. I don't think I have.
Q. Have you ever seen any polls about no additive cigarettes?
A. A poll?
Q. Yeah.
A. No.
Q. Have you ever read any information about no additive cigarettes?
MS. FRANKEL: Objection, lack of f oundat i on, vague.
A. I have read quite a bit about the use of additives in cigarettes from the 1960s onward and, and the public health had a concern about additives. But I don't know if that answers your question specifically.
Q. No, we're talking about in the 1990s advertising cigarettes as "natural." Have you ever read anything about that at all?
A. I think I may have seen advertisements of cigarette -- I mean, in my normal reading about with the word "natural," and I may have seen them with the "no additives." I don't know what cigarette that is..
Q. Winston.
MS. FRANKEL: Objection to the characterization. Lack of foundation.
A. I think I may have seen that. There's also an FTC agreed-upon disclaimer about what "no additives" means, doesn't it? I think seems to me I have come across to that as well.
Q. I don't think there's a -A. I think it says, "'No additives' does not necessarily mean it is healthier," or something
like that.
Q. It started recently. There was a period of time -- I'm not -- I'm asking you the questions. We can talk about that later.
MS. FRANKEL: I'm going to object to the characterization and the testimony by counsel.
MR. FINE: There's no question on the record. There's no question on the deck. Q. Have you ever read any type of polls about what individuals in California or elsewhere think about the term "natural"?
A. No.
Q. Okay. You have not included that in your opinion?
A. About what they, how they interpret the word "natural"?
Q. Yes, sir.
A. No.
Q. How about "no additive"? Have you ever read a poll or any internal studies about the phrase, "no additive"?
A. No.
MS. FRANKEL: Objection as to vagueness.
Q. As a doctor, what's your opinion about the word "natural"?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. Tobacco is a plant, I assume it is
natural.
Q. Do you think "natural" means "healthier"?
A. No.
Q. Doesn't mean healthier?
A. Just means "of nature," to me.
Tobacco is a plant, means nature.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Would this be a good
time to take a break? We have been going
for an hour.
MR. FINE: Yeah, we can take a break.
(Recess taken.)
Q. Doctor, these Gallup polls we will discussed previously, were any of them California-specific that you reviewed?
A. I can't remember now. When I was doing my work with, research with, the Bullock case, I think I did see some California-related polls.
Q. Are they contained within these reliance documents that you have given to me?
A. I think they would be on the documents, the California-specific, the one that says "English California."
Q. And so if it is contained in there, it is; if it is not, then there are none. Is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
Q. Do you want to take a look at that
exhibit?
A. I don't think it would help me. I can't remember whether, because California has had such and ambitious program, the Surgeon Generals' reports in the '90s in particular has devoted large sections and there may be some polls reported in those Surgeon Generals' reports. I think there may be .
Q. But as of today you can't tell us -A. I can't.
Q. -- as to whether any of the Gallup polls are California-specific?
A. No, I can't tell you, no.
Q. And insofar as the reliance documents that you have given us, that's it? These lists, these documents you have handed over, there are no other documents; is that correct?
A. I think I mentioned to you that there are some materials that I have read --Q. There the depositions?
A. -- in the Department of Justice case are not on the reliance list.
Q. And what would those, where would I find a list of those particular documents?
A. I'm not a -- I'm not 100% sure how you would get a list of that. You would have to, maybe Mr. Rosenthal can help us with that.
Q. So you're saying that, so far as your opinions are concerned, you don't have a copy of that list, you're just using your recollection from what you flipped through while you were reading doing the DOJ case?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, mischaracterizes his testimony.
MR. FINE: Well, I'm asking. If he has it in his office and he's relied up on it, I'm entitled to it. If he doesn't have it, he doesn't know where it is or he hasn't used it, then I'm not entitled to it. It's real simple.
A. I'm in the process of getting all the documents that I have retained in my office put
into a master list. I have a research assistant tfho is helping me with that.
I think that there are some documents that I have received as part of the disclosure in Lhe Department of Justice case that are neither cataloged on my list yet and I think are not on the, on the reliance list.
Q. So you have not relied upon them, or they are just not on the list?
A. I think all of the things -- all the Tiajor documents that I relied upon are on the list. There may be a few that I have read that I have not, that are not on the list.
Q. So when you say, "a few," less than a half a dozen is not on the list?
A. I can't give you a number.
Q. Less than 100 pages?
A. Well, some of these reports from the DOJ case are thousands of pages.
Q. I'm just asking you what you have relied upon. I'm supposed to have the documents and you are telling me I don't.
A. See, I'm relying on everything I have read. I mean, I can't totally exclude documents from my brain that I have read over time. I think
there are some documents I have read that are not on that list.
Q. Well, I'm not asking for your 10th grade biology text., I'm asking for what you relied upon in your opinion today.
A. And I think I told you I think there are some that were some produced in the Department of Justice case that are not on the reliance list but I can't tell you how many.
Q. Do you have that in your office?
A. I have the documents I have retained from the Department of Justice case in my office but I do not have a list of them.
Q. Could you provide us with a list?
A. 1,1 certainly I can provide you with one when it is produced. I'm not sure, you know, my research assistant is going through this slowly.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I can also, my understanding is that that is -- and Dr. English can correct me if I'm wrong -that those are the ones he has relied upon in forming his opinions in this case.
There was a DOJ production of U.S. government materials, some of which he has seen. I don't believe they in any way
alter his opinions, although you can certainly inquire to the extent to which they altered his opinions or he has formed any new opinions based on them. Certainly we would be happy, just by, you know, just literally as a result of time, no list -and a variety of other issues I won't get into -- no list has ever been generated of the documents he has read.
MR. FINE: I can't cross-examine him about a document when he doesn't even know what the document is. I mean, you're saying -MR. ROSENTHAL: Can you inquire whether or not they in any way changed his opinions in this case and whether or not he as - -
MR. FINE: He doesn't even know what it is. How is it going to change his opinion? He doesn't know the title. He doesn't, he said he has looked through some of these documents and he doesn't know how old they are, he doesn't know, you know -MR. ROSENTHAL: That's not what he said. He said in the last year he reviewed
documents produced by the Department of Justice. He already testified prior to the time you -MR. FINE: Don't characterize his testimony, it is what it is, okay? I'm just saying that if he has a list in his office I' rn asking for the list. That's all. If he has relied upon it for his opinion today.
Now you're telling me that I have the reliance documents, that you have provided reliance documents, that there really isn't anything else. He's telling me something different. I just want to know which way it is, that's all.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Could I take a minute?
MR. FINE: Sure.
(Recess taken.)
MR. ROSENTHAL: Let me explain my explaining what that list is. I'm going to represent to you that list is the documents that Dr. English is relying upon for his opinion in this case. Obviously, he may have read, you know, his 10th grade biology textbook.
He may not understand, you know, what the word "reliance11 means in the legal context; we both do, but he does not. In that sense, he will not be offering an opinion about his 10th grade biology textbook. And he will not be -- my understanding is his reliance what he is to date he will offer opinions about.
If in the future something coming comes up, he may, you know, review it and want to offer an opinion on it, and we will obviously disclose that to you. And to the extent you are allowed to, you can examine him in deposition. But today that consists of what he is relying on.
MR. FINE: The main reason I want clarification is that about 10 days ago we had a meeting with Evan Nadel in San Francisco. We had reviewed a production by RJR of approximately 107 boxes -MR. VERNON: That's highly confidential, those documents.
MR. FINE: Okay, I'm not going to talk about them. I'm just going to talk about the quantity. Then the last 10 days ago we
found out that there may be an additional 204 crates that had not been given to us.
So I am just trying to be careful that we find out that this is by and large what you have represented it to be and not that we are going to get an additional crate of reliance documents a week before trial.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Oh, no, certainly that will not happen. If there are additional documents that Dr. English discoveries and Dr. English feels it necessary to rely upon and testify about at trial, you know, we will obviously disclose that to you and discuss what the appropriate remedy is.
I mean, Dr. English testified for two days in Blue Cross based on essentially 95% of those same documents. I think those documents are a good representation of what he is relying on.
MS. FRANKEL: I object to counsel's characterization of RJR production.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Obviously, I'm not in a position to testify to that.
MR. FINE: Well, you weren't sitting in the room, right?
MR. FOGARTY: Well, the person representing RJR was not sitting in the room, either, so your representation is on the record.
MR. FINE: Whatever. It is not part of this deposition and it has nothing to do with you, doctor.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Let's just go on.
THE WITNESS: I take your word for it. Q. Doctor, in the sense of food, what would "natural" mean to you as a physician?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. You know, I don't have -- never really thought about it. I think that "natural" justs means that it exists in nature; so I assume that that's the -- maybe if you give me a product I might be able to be more specific.
Q. Well -A. I mean, to me as a consumer as not as a government regulator to determine what the word has been used for.
Q. You wouldn't expect, say, natural milk to be irradiated milk, would you?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form,
legal conclusion in terms of --
Q. I'm asking for his medical opinion.
I'm not asking for -- I'm specifically not asking for a legal conclusion. Okay, doctor?
A. Well, I mean, radiation is natural, too. I mean, so I'm not sure what it means in this context.
Q. In 1994, in March and then again in April, the CEOs of: the tobacco industry testified before Congress. Did you consider that in rendering your opinion today about the public health awareness?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I have read some of that testimony; I have read newspaper accounts of it; and I have seen some of it, some news organization I think made a video clip and I have seen a portion of it on video clip. So I'm aware of it. So it forms part of my opinion, yes.
Q. It does form part of your opinion?
MR. ROSENTHAL: He already said that.
Asked and answered.
A. Yeah.
Q. We're talking about testimony that occurred in front of Congress March 25, 1994, and
MR. ROSENTHAL: Is there a question?
Q. Yes. I just want to make sure that the testimony that he recounted is that testimony.
A. The, the material that I am referring to is the one where Congress and the tobacco company executives discussed addiction. I'm not -I mean, I want to make sure we're talking about the same 1994.
Q. Right;, right.
A. Okay,
Q. Now you had expressed in your opinion that there are certain regulations regulating tobacco that you have opinions on?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And what regulations were you talking about?
A. I'm talking about FTC regulations on advertising. I'm talking about various public health organizations and political bodies on restricting access to cigarettes, restricting smoking in public spaces. I'm talking about warnings that are placed on cigarette packages.
I'm talking -- ■
A, -- about excise taxes that are placed on cigarettes. Talking about -- well, I guess I was going to say, there are many states that have mandatory educational programs in public schools but that's not really a request from the tobacco companies.
Q. How about the cigarette advertising code. Did you consider, have you ever read it?
A. Which cigarette advertising code?
Q. The one, the self-imposed one from the governor, is it Keane? As I understand it, there's three codes, 1970, 1974 and 1980?
MR. VERNON: DI think the first one is
'64, I think.
Q. '64, 1990. Have you reviewed any of those codes?
MS, FRANKEL: Objection.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form,
lack of foundation.
A. The one that Governor Meyner of New Jersey --
Q. That's right.
A. Monitored, I have read it. It has been a while back.
enforcement of that code?
A. No.
Q. How about enforcement of any of the codes, the three codes?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I don't know the other two.
Q. Okay. And did -- have you reviewed any information which, where the CAC acted -sorry, cigarette advertising code -- as a restriction on tobacco advertising?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form,
lack of foundation.
A. I'm not sure I understand. This is not ringing a bell for me. You can maybe rephrase the question?
Q. Okay. Have you read anything about the CAC acting as a restriction on the tobacco industry?
A. And CAC is what?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
Q. The cigarette advertising code.
A. I don't know that.
Q. The one we were just talking about with Governor Meyner.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. -- I didn't realize that was the term.
I	have not really, I'm not aware of the influence or effect of that code, no.
Q. Okay.. So that was not included in your opinion?
A. I have read the code; but I don't know what the, what the effect of that was, no.
Q. You belong to a series of societies we had discussed originally in your CV. The North Carolina Pediatric Society, do they have a position on advertising to, to youth?
A. I don't know.
Q. How about, let's see, do you have a position on advertising to youth?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
Q. People under, near the age of 18?
MR. FOGARTY: Objection.
A. Advertising cigarettes?
Q. Cigarettes, yes, sir.
A. I'm against it.
Q. How about the American Board of Pediatrics, do they have a position on advertising to - -
.	have opinions on me but I don't think they have
;	opinions -- the American Academy of Pediatrics, I'm
I	sure.
[	Q. I'm sorry, I flipped --
j	A. That's because of my CV. The North
j	Carolina Pediatrics Society is a subsidiary of the
1	American Academy of Pediatrics, that's why it is
3	listed that way. But I am sure that they do. I
5	can't cite it to you, but I am sure that they
)	oppose advertising cigarettes to minors.
L	Q. The Joe Camel campaign, so far as
I	advertising to youth, do you have opinion as to
}	that?
1	MS. FRANKEL: Objection, lack of
5	foundation, mischaracterization of the
5	campaign, vague.
7	A. I haven't studied -- I certainly
3	remember Joe Camel advertisements. I also remember
U	that there was a concern in the public health
D	community raised about that, that particular
L	campaign.
2	Q. Did you have a personal concern?
3	MS. FRANKEL: Objection.
i	MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
concern for me?
Q. As a physician.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. You know, I haven't really given it much, much thought.
The reason I say that, I am worried about my patients smoking, I'm worried about my son smoking, and so I do question them about when they do smoke what has been it.
I have never had a patient tell me that a cigarette commercial had anything to do with why they smoked and so I tend not to be terribly concerned about that.
Q. So your research as to cigarette advertising is what your patients told you?
MS. FRANKEL: Objection.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form, mischaracterizes his testimony.
A. Well, certainly, I do listen to my patients and beca\ise I have conversations with them about smoking from the time they're four years old every year. My research on that from the public health, what the public health community's concern has been about advertising, certainly the public health has been worried about the potential
influence of cigarette commercials on smoker initiation, especially dealing with children.
And the Surgeon General's report has large sections on that in 1979, 1989, and again in 1994. And the research on that is that when children are asked about, you know, the influences that cause them to start smoking, it is, it is the family and it is their peers, it is not commercials. It is not ads.
Q. And you, but you have never read any marketing surveys by any of the industry?
A. No.
MS. FRANKEL: Objection.
Q. And you have never read any advertising surveys from Hill & Knowlton or any of the advertising agencies; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. Unless they have been -- I don't think
so, no.
Q. Okay. And you haven't reviewed the advertising budgets; is that correct?
MS. FRANKEL: Same objection.
A. No. Except for what I mentioned to you earlier today; and that is that from time to time the public health community has reported on
that budget in the Surgeon Generals' reports that I have seen.
Q. In any of the documents have you seen, have you reviewed,, have you seen indications that the tobacco companies have tried to market anything to individuals under the age of 18?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. Q. Out of all your research?
A. Have I seen internal company documents to that effect?
Q. Internal, okay, internal company documents.
MS. FRANKEL: Same objection.
A. I can recall -- I can't give you even the date except I think it came from the 1950s, there may have been some one that talked about smokers in their teens, but I can't be more specific than that.
Q. So you think that out of all the thousands of pages that you reviewed you have seen one document that indicated what you just said?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form -A. I don't know what document -MR. ROSENTHAL: -- mischaracterizes
his testimony.
A. I don't know what the document indicates. You just asked if I had seen anything;
I don't know whether that document represents the actual path or what the company did.
I think I have seen a document produced in one of these cases and I wish I could be more specific and have the document in front of me but I don't. But I think I have seen one.
MR. FINE: Would you give me a second
here?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Sure. (Pause)
Q. Let rne ask you one other question.
Out of all the documents you reviewed, in your opinion as a physician, as a medical historian, do you think that the tobacco companies have attempted to market to individuals under the age of 18?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form, lack of foundation.
A. I can't say what, who they were -that's the marketing. I haven't studied the marketing decisions exactly what happens.
Q. So whether it is Joe Camel or the Marlboro man or any of these other different types of marketing schemes, you have no opinion as to
whether they attempted to market to individuals under the age of 18?
MS. FRANKEL: Objection.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, asked and answered.
MS. FRANKEL: Objection to the term scheme.
A. I can't, as I say, I don't know what the aim of those campaigns were.
Q. Based upon the documentation you have reviewed?
A. I mean -MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, asked and answered.
A. As I mentioned to you, I know the public health community has been concerned that there were, that they had a influence on children under 18. But, you know, I have no idea what the intent of the marketing campaign was.
Q. Well, I'm asking you what your opinion, not what they think.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, asked and answered five times now.
tell --
Q. How about as a physician?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, asked and answered.
A. You asked me as a physician. I don't think ads play a role in smoking initiation.
Q. You don't think ads play any role whatsoever?
A. Because it's only the -- the data on children, When you ask teenagers who smoke, what were the influences on why they smoke, they tell you their peers, their girlfriends, their parents, their families. You know, When in the polling information they list advertisements it gets a percent, you know,, it is really very low.
As I say, when I ask -- I start my smoker education with children when they are prekindergarten visit, talking about it every year. Some of my adolescent patients do and I ask them why; and I can tell you the reasons they give me are precisely the reasons that the polling data indicate is that, you know, "Doc, I was dating this girl and she smoked and so I started smoking."
Q. And the polling data, you can't point me to any California polls?
mischaracterizes his testimony.
A. What I said was I, I, I can't -- I think there are some California-specific polls in this material here but I can't specifically recall one for you as I sit here.
Q. Let's move on to a different area that you have stated that you may have some testimony on. It says that you may comment on witnesses and I would like you to comment on Dr. Jeffrey Arnett,
A. I don't have a comment.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I don't know anything about him.
Q. You don't know anything about him?
A. No.
Q. You have never read anything by Dr. Jeffrey Arnett?
A. I have not.
Q. Have you ever read any of his depositions?
A. No.
Q. Any of the cases he has worked on?
A. I don't think so.
Q. You don't know who he is?
A. I do not.
A. I have read a number of things that Dr., a number of his depositions. I have read his, some of his opinions as the author of Monograph 13.
Q. And what is your opinion as to his writing of Monograph 13?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, vague.
A. That's a very complicated issue. Let me tell you how I look at Monograph 13 as a historian. In the public health community, based on the science of tar paintings, experiments from the '50s, epidemiological studies beginning in the 1960s, recommended to the American public to smoke low tar cigarettes. For those people who wouldn't stop -- you know, who wanted to continue smoking, that was the consistent recommendation of the public health community from the '60s through the end of the 1990s when, when a number of factors came together that began to undermine that recommendation.
Monograph 13 is sort of a compilation of the evidence that would undermine the public health recommendation for 30 years. But from the point of view of the historian, this is a formulation that took place in the year 2001 and so needs to be considered as, as that; which is, an
attempt to change the public health recommendation of 30 years in the year 2001.
Q. Well, now I know what you feel the public health community says about Dr. David Burns. But you are being submitted to us to comment on the testimony of other witnesses as well as the evidence upon which they rely. Again, I ask you your opinion as to Dr. Dave Burns and what you have read about him and the evidence upon which he relies. Not the public -MR. ROSENTHAL: First of all.
Q. Excuse me, I'm not done. Not the public health's opinion, I'm asking for your opinion, sir.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
MR. FINE: Okay.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Beyond that, I mean, a lot of that is obviously Dr. Burns is going to testify at trial. It is impossible for Dr. English to answer how he is going to respond to Dr. Burns' testimony when Dr. Burns hasn't given his testimony.
MR. FINE: He has reviewed Dr. Burns testimony; he said he is commenting on that. He has been commenting on other
things that he has done in the past in other cases. And you're the ones that proffered that he is going to comment on testimony and evidence upon which they rely. He just told me he's familiar with it, so I'm asking his opinion. Not the public health community's opinion, I'm asking him opinion.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Which opinion?
MR. FINE: Of Dr. Burns and the evidence that he relies upon.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
BY MR. FINE:
Q, Okay, doctor.
A. Dr. Burns has been a member of the group that has written many of the Surgeon Generals' reports and so I know his work as part of, as one of the authors on the Surgeon General's committee that has written those reports.
You know, I, and I look at those reports as being important statements.
I don't review every scientific article that is based on a scientific report or one that Dr. Burns relied on. I am a public health historian and that's how I form my opinions is to
know what the public health community and how they are evaluating these documents.
So I have Dr. Burns was an important person in the authorship of Surgeon General's report '81 on the changing cigarettes. I can answer an opinion on --
(Interruption in the proceedings by the telephone operator. Discussion off the record.)
MR. ROSENTHAL: Sorry, doctor.
A. So I can comment on that report.
It is hard to, for example, comment on what he particularly did in the Surgeon General's report '81 because he is acting as a part of the large group. I have never read his individual personal papers on that, so I have trouble commenting on him particularly in that regard.
Maybe you can refine the question for
me?
Q. Well, so far as do you find that Dr. David Burns, based upon what you have read about him and the testimony -- and maybe you have object served him, I don't know -- that he is indeed a credible person?
A. You know, I have not seen him, not met him; so I, you know, it is hard to say that. I think he has been parts of groups that have made some very credible contributions to the smoking and health campaign over the years.
Do I agree with everything he has said at trial? Some things yes; some things, no.
Q. And how much of this trial -- how many cases of trial testimony have you read?
A. I have, well, I have read the Blue Cross/Blue Shield one. I think I read his trial testimony in Swartz and in Bullock.
Q. Credible testimony?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I'm not exactly sure what you mean by "credible." In the sense of did I agree with all of it? No,
Q. What did you disagree with?
A. I can't -- I would have to have the testimony in front of me to know that, I can't recall.
Q. Do you know Gregory Niles Connolly?
A. No.
Q. Have you ever read anything written by Gregory Niles Connolly?
A. I don't think so but I can't recall.
Q. Professor K. Michael Cummings?
A. I don't think I have read any material, no,
Q. Ever read any of his testimony?
A. I, I can't recall.
Q. Have you no opinion about Professor Cummings?
MR, ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I don't recall reading him so I have no opinion at the moment.
Q. How about Dr. Wayne Farone?
A. I have read some of Dr. Farone's testimony, yes.
Q. And your opinion as to whether his testimony is credible?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. He testifies to quite a number of things, you can give me a specific?
Q. Well, you're the one who is commenting; I don't know what you have read.
A. I have read testimony about whether certain cigarette modifications, had they been made, would have made a difference in, in the safety of cigarettes over time. I have looked at
some of his recommendations, so I can answer questions about those I have read about.
Q. In which cases did you read that testimony?
A. Bullock.
Q. In Bullock. Did you find that testimony to be helpful?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. Helpful in what respect?
Q. Well,, apparently it was helpful to the Plaintiff in that case.
A. I don't know when it was or not. But I, what I took note of is that the kinds of recommendations that he thought would have been worthwhile were ones that the public health community at the time would never have made a recommendation towards. So I, I, it didn't jibe with my historical understanding.
Q. Can you give me an example?
A. The example I gave I can think of now is a cigarette that would have added large amounts -- basically have been a nicotine-only cigarette, a recommendation that he thinks occurred in the 19, late 1970s.
documents at the time was that, that certainly in the '70s the public health community did indeed discuss adding nicotine to cigarettes as a way of counteracting compensation. Michael Russell's name was associated with it.
But eventually the public health community never made that recommendation at all and could not, in my opinion, have made it in the late 1970s for a variety of reasons: Among them was the concern of the role of nicotine in heart disease; the public health community's concern of nicotine as an addicting drug in the late 1970s and early '80s, we never would have recommended adding it to cigarettes.
So, you know, I -- that particular recommendation he thinks should have taken place or was rejected, I'm not sure, remember, the specifics of that; but it doesn't jibe with what my understanding what the public health community was interested in.
Q. Are you aware of any tobacco company documentation that indicates that the nicotine/tar ratio was manipulated?
A. The whole issue of that is a very complicated one. If we have a moment, I can give
you what my understanding about that is.
Q. Sure, okay.
A, Okay. What the public health community was concerned I believe was tar. And that was the concern stemming from the '50s and '60s and '70s about what caused lung cancer. So the concern for a safer cigarette was lowering, lowering tar.
And so there was a whole range of possibilities that the public health community did, and thinking particularly what the Tobacco Working Group did. But that's a whole other issue we can go into if you wish.
But one of things that was suggested in the -- one of the things that people found was that as the cigarette tar got lower and lower and lower smoker acceptability declined. And what the public health community wanted was, of course, remember these cigarettes were going to be designed for residual smokers, smokers who were going to continue to smoke, but that the cigarettes had to be acceptable.
That led to the additive to make the flavor and also raised the issue should these tar and nicotine ratio be altered because in plants it
is relatively fixed. So the public health community investigated that in a number of different ways.
One is that the Department of Agriculture, for example, genetically engineered tobacco plants to effectively raise the level of nicotine, so that raised the ratio.
The whole process of reconstituted tobacco sheets, which was, again, one of the technologies used to make low tar cigarettes as in the process of removing nicotine and then adding it back; and that's another way to change the ratios.
So there were a number of technologies that did it in the public health community. I certainly investigated that.
I personally have never looked at any tobacco company's formulas of how they made cigarettes. I know that they in general adopted the recommendation of the Tobacco Working Group; but I don't know how a specific cigarette was made, so I can't tell you whether, you know, how these, you know, this particular altering of ratios occurred in a given cigarette.
Q. So you have no opinion as to whether the tobacco companies manipulated or altered the
tar/nicotine ratio because you have not reviewed those particular documentations of the manufacture of cigarettes?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I know what the public health community was doing about altering that ratio but I do not know what the tobacco companies were doing.
Q. If you were able to research those particular items, would that alter your opinion about nicotine, about a safer cigarette?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
Q. If you were able to have these particular documentations available to you?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I don't think so. The reason for that is what the public health community was interested is getting smokers to smoke low tar cigarettes and that's what they did. If you look at, you know, smokers smoked cigarettes with ever-lower tar ratings as time went on.
They were less concerned about the nicotine level.
Q. Jack Henningfield, do you know Jack Henningfield?
Q. What have you read?
A, He has a number of publications from the '80s and '90s and I have read a number of those.
Q. Do you know their names or?
A. No.
Q. Okay. Have you read any of his deposition testimony or his testimony at trial?
A. I don't think I have.
Q. Okay. Do you have any comments about Dr. Henningfield?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I, I, I mean he, I think he is a recognized researcher on nicotine but that's all I can say.
Q. Have you ever read any documents authored by Mr. Rodgman?
A. Alan Rodgman?
Q. Yes.
A. Yes.
Q. How about Mr. Clyde Teague?
A. I have read a couple of documents by Clyde Teague.
Q. And Linda Beasley?
Q. Did you ever have opportunity to interview any of those individuals?
A. No.
Q. Do you think it would be helpful to interview any of those individuals in forming your opinion?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. Not particularly, no.
Q. Would you consider them to be a primarily source for some of these matters we discussed together?
MS. FRANKEL: Objection, vague.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. Yes, I would.
Q. Wouldn't you as on paid retainer for Philip Morris have access to these individuals?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form,
lack of foundation, object to the
characterization.
A. I'm not on paid retainer, I do research for them. But, you know, I can't do everything and I, I didn't interview those people, no.
Q. Do you know James Lackritz?
Q. He's an individual that had to do with economic modeling. Does that strike a blow?
A. No.
Q. How about Professor Richard Pollay, P-O-L-L-A-Y?
A. I have read some of Dr. Pollay's testimony. I can't remember which case, however.
Q. He testifies and he's an expert in advertising promotion and public relations?
A. I understand that to be the case.
Q. Yes. But these are the documents basically you said you really did not consider in your public health analysis?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form,
mischaracterizes his testimony.
A. I would have to actually look at the materials. I mean, some of them I may have seen in the sense that I have made -- I haven't surveyed all advertisements, I have seen some. There may be some overlap there. He undoubtedly cites some literature; I may have read some of the same literature. Without seeing it, I can't say exactly what the overlap is.
Q. Do you have any comments on Dr. Pollay?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form, vague.
A. His view of the role of advertising is a little different than the one I think the public health community at least has had about smoking initiation --
Q. How about on your -MR. ROSENTHAL: Wait, are you done?
Q. I'm £?orry.
A. My reflection of this is basically what the public health community has said.
Q. What is your comment on Professor
Pollay?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. Q. Your opinion.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. I don't have a, I really don't have an
opinion.
Q. Paul Slovic, S-L-O-V-I-C, is that name familiar to you?
A. The name is familiar. I, as I sit here, I can't, is he another advertising expert?
Q. Psychological psychiatrist -- I'm sorry, psychological framework for consumers.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Object to that characterization of that testimony, it isn't fully informative. But you can answer.
A. I'm not sure I recognize -- I think I recognize his name but I'm not certain.
Q. He's from Oregon, does that help?
A. No.
Q. Okay. Robert Wallace?
A. I don't have an opinion; I don't know who he i s.
Q, Do you know Weinstein?
A. I may have read something of his but I can't remember what it is.
Q. He surveys means and methods and public risk perceptions triggered by following claimed unlawful unfair and/or fraudulent business acts?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Once again, I object to that characterization of Dr. Weinstein's testimony as not fully complete in a way that doctor -MR. FINE: Do you want me to read the whole thing? I just read it to jog his memory. I will be happy to read the whole
thing if you like.
A. I don't think I have read anything by
him.
MR. FINE: Okay. Let's take a break and see if we can't finish.
(Recess taken.)

Q. You don't think any of these primary sources could have been helpful in forming your opinions?
MS. FRANKEL: Objection.

A. He didn't seem to be very tightly written, if I am remembering it well. And he seemed to be challenging another -- a Plaintiffs ' expert; and he went right to the heart of the matter, as I remember.
Q. How about Kip Visusi?
A. I have never met Kip Visusi but I have read his, a number of his, works and at least one of his books.
Q. Do you have any comments on him?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
A. I, I, I think I understand his viewpoints on risk perception and how -- at least in some of his work on how people, smokers and other people, overestimate the risk and dangers of smoking. So I'm aware of the arguments. I'm not in a position really to comment on, on him beyond that.
Q. Isn't he the individual who comments on using tobacco to prune the human herd?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form,
mischaracterizes the document.
Q. Visusi testified.
A. I have no idea.
Q. William Wecker?
A. I have heard the name. What does he
do?
Q. He is a statistical and econometric analysis model. I suppose he is going to comment on the Plaintiffs' model.
haven't read any of: his materials.
MR. E^INE: I'm sure that would be fascinating.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Wecker is an interesting guy.
MR. FINE: I'm not doing statistics.
I took one course in statistics and you won't see me do one of those.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I highly recommend Wecker.
MR. FINE: No. no.
Q. Christine Wright-Isak, I-S-A-K, advertising?
A. I'm not familiar with her work.
Q. When you say you're not familiar with her work, I would take that to mean that in your reliance documents you also would not have any particular articles, testimony, deposition, contained within your reliance documents?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form. A. As I sit here I don't think I have read material of those people but I can't be 100% certain. I do not have the two lists memorized so
I	can't --
you commented you have read it -A. Right.
Q. -- and maybe we will find that in
there?
A. Yes, you will find those. But on some of the others I cannot be 100% certain I have not read something by them.
MR. FINE: Okay. We'll take a minute. MR. ROSENTHAL: That's fine.
(Recess taken.)
Q. Doctor, as I told you at the beginning of this deposition, if there was any answers that you wished to supplement now would be the time?
A. I don't wish to.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Okay, I'm through. EXAMINATION
BY MR. ROSENTHAL:
Q. Dr. English, we met yesterday, right? A. Yes.
Q. And the two individuals to my left were at that meeting as well?
A. They were.
Q. Did you ask us any questions about the nature of the Brown case?
broad strokes to me.
Q. And did we explain the case in broad strokes to you?
A. Yes.
Q. And did you ask any questions about what the allegations were the Plaintiffs were raising in this case?
A. I did. And what I recall, you said that in some ways that they were similar to other cases that I had participated in dealing with fraud, burying scientific data, and to which had been addended some low tar issues.
Q. What do you mean by "to which had been addended some low tar issues"?
A. Well, I mean that perhaps low tar was going to be -- might be more prominent in this case than perhaps it had been in Blue Cross.
Q. Was it your understanding based on our conversations yesterday that issues relating to low tar cigarettes were one of the issues in this case?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you have an opinion as to whether you could assist the trier of fact in understanding how allegations related to low tar cigarettes -strike that.
Do you have an opinion as to whether you could assist the trier of fact in understanding allegations related to the marketing of low tar cigarettes?
A. I'm not sure I understand what "the trier of fact" is.
Q. The person who has to decide the issues in this case.
A. I think I can, yes.
Q. Why?
A. Well, because I have read the public health community's, scientific community's, interest in low tar cigarettes from their inception.
Q. Are you a lawyer?
A. No.
Q. Do you have an understanding of exactly what a Plaintiff must, must show to -- what the Plaintiff in this case must show to establish liability?
A. No.
Q. Do you have any understanding as to any of the defenses that any of the Defendants here can raise that would avoid liability?
Q. Giving -- we talked about low tar cigarettes. Given your understanding of other issues that have been raised by Plaintiffs in this case, do you have an opinion as to whether the research you have done could assist a trier of fact in understanding those issues?
MR. FINE: Objection, move to strike, ambiguous question.
Q. You can answer.
MR. FINE: The question is also leading.
Q. I'm just asking whether you have an
opinion?
A. Yes, I think I could be of assistance. Q. Why?
A. Well, I, in the area of, of the growing scientific and medical and public health appreciation for, for the relation of smoking and health, I have read literally thousands of scientific publications. I have read all of the Surgeon Generals' reports and thousands of documents that they are based upon. I have read materials in a very comprehensive way from the American Cancer Society, American Heart Association. I have read countless federal
documents, I have reviewed documents in other cases that have dealt with California.
So I feel like I can answer, I could be of assistance, yes.
Q. Now in the meetings that you have had with us in this case, did you ever ask for the class definition t:o be read to you?
MR, FINE: Objection, leading question.
A. Yes. I, I can't remember, I can't recite it back to you, but I understand there was a temporal component to it and there was a definition what is, what a smoker was; but I can't, I can't, as I said, I can't recite it to you.
Q. And generally I think this is consistent with what Plaintiffs' counsel has said to you. I'll represent to you that the class in this case generally are smokers who were residents of California at any point between some point in 1993 and some point in 2001 who smoked at least one cigarette and who were exposed to tobacco marketing during that period.
Have you made any specific study as to that particular group of people?
Q. Now have you made a, have you studied the nation as a whole as to the understanding of the health risks of smoking?
A. Yes.
Q, Have you studied the people in the state of California generally what their understanding was of the health risks of smoking?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you have any reason to believe that the class of people I have just identified would be any different than California as a whole or the nation as a whole?
A. No reason to think they would be different.
Q. Actually, one other question just because -- have you read Monograph 13?
A. Yes.
Q. If I represent to you that Neil Weinstein wrote a chapter in Monograph 13, have you read anything that Neil Weinstein wrote?
A. Yes, I'm sorry, I have. There is a chapter on the public perception of low tar; it's Chapter 6, I think.
Q. It's been a long day, hasn't it?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Okay. I have no further questions at this time.
FURTHER EXAMINATION
BY MR. FINE:
Q. Has Arnold & Porter ever attempted to retain you and listened to your opinion and then not retained you?
A. No.
Q. Every time they have asked you to do work for them they have been satisfied with your work and continued to use you?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form and foundation.
A. I can't tell you whether they have been -- what level of satisfaction. But I assume that they are happy with my work.
Q. Have they ever dropped from you a
case?
A. No. Well, for example, I was named as an expert in Bullock and Swartz; and they decided at the last minute that they were going to take a different trial strategy.
So, you know, I don't know what goes into a trial lawyer's decision about which witnesses to employ.
MR. FINE: Thank you, nothing else.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Okay.
