THEREUPON,
LUIS MARTINEZ-FERNANDEZ, PH.D.,
having been first duly sworn, was examined and testified upon his oath as follows:
THE WITNESS: I do.
MR. HARRIS: Would the court reporter kindly swear the witness in?
(Court reporter tells attorney the witness has already been sworn in.)
MR. HARRIS: Okay. I'm sorry. First of all, can you guys hear me? The speaker phone isn't the greatest.
MR. CHUMBLEY: You're coming through okay.
The people whispering in the background aren't coming through okay though. Are you there?
MR. HARRIS: I'm here. Who else — is there anyone else on the phone?
MR. CHUMBLEY: I don't think there's anyone else on the phone, except you.
MR. HARRIS: That's fine.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Obviously, we're on the phone, but we're here private.
MR. HARRIS: You're there, right?
MR. CHUMBLEY: I'm there. So is Mr. Alvarez
—	Cruz-Alvarez. And there's an "also present."
MR. HARRIS: All right. J.B. Harris on behalf of the plaintiff.
DIRECT EXAMINATION
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor, please state your name for the record. A Luis Martinez-Fernandez.
Q Okay. Let me ask you, Doctor, you've been retained as an expert witness in this case, correct?
A That's correct.
Q Have you ever given a deposition in the past?
A Yes, I have.
Q And in what cases or case have you appeared as an expert to give a deposition?
A Depositions? Probably 10 of them. One of the cases is Odom. One of the —
Q You provided a case list, is that correct?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Within a certain time frame.
We provided a case list in his disclosure, yes.
MR. HARRIS: That's fine. I don't have to, you know, tell you everything, go over everything. But just as a courtesy to you, if you feel like you need to take a break, obviously, you'll let us know.
If you don't understand the question that I
ask the way in which I ask it, feel free to ask me to repeat myself in a way that's more clear for your understanding.
The attorneys in the room have the authority to object on the record to preserve their rights — or the rights of their client.
MR. ALVAREZ: J.B. —
MR. HARRIS: If you decide — unless they instruct you not to answer, you’re required to answer all the questions that I ask.
MR. ALVAREZ: J.B., it's Frank Cruz-Alvarez. Can I ask — would you be agreeable, if we could agree, that an objection by either Doug or me is an objection for both defendants, so we don't —
MR. HARRIS: Yes.
MR. ALVAREZ: Thank you.
MR. HARRIS: That will be fine.
MR. ALVAREZ: Thank you very much.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor, what do you perceive your role as an expert witness to entail in this case?
A My role is to give expert opinions on several matters, beginning with the issue of awareness in Cuba as to the health effects of smoking.
Q Right.
A Also, awareness in Cuba as to the fact that cigarette smoking can be addictive. And I also have opinions in terms of the availability of various kinds of tobacco products in Cuba during the lifetime of Mr. Gonzalez.
Q Okay. What — what have you done to prepare for today's deposition?
A Do you mean in the recent past, or from the beginning?
Q Just for — yeah, for this deposition from the time you learned about the case.
A I've conducted research. I have taken notes from various materials. I have read the depositions for this case, the interrogatories. That is —
Q Do you recall whose depositions you read?
A Yes. I read all of them.
MR. CHUMBLEY: We have them — we brought the transcripts that he's read. He has them here with him. If you want him to go through the transcripts and tell you which ones he read, he can do that.
MR. HARRIS: Yeah. That will be fine.
THE WITNESS: I have one from a Teresa Gonzalez. And the date, November 19, 2013. I have one from Juana Gonzalez, November 27, 2013.
Bertine Lindsson (phonetic), with two S's.
THE WITNESS: August 20, 2010.
MR. CHUMBLEY: 2 0 — yeah. Sorry.
THE WITNESS: Tomas Gonzalez, July 8, 2010. Agustin Gonzalez, December 29, 2009. Carlos Gonzalez, September 25, 2013. Carlos Gonzalez, October 16, 2013. I have a Teresa Gonzalez, September 9, 2013. I have another one, Teresa Gonzalez, dated September 13, 2013.
MR. CHUMBLEY: I think that's the same one. I think one had the wrong date. I think September 13
—	that was the deposition where you realized maybe she had been deposed, and you guys were going to look for the transcript, so you adjourned it early.
MR. HARRIS: Okay.
THE WITNESS: I have Agustin Gonzalez, continued deposition, April 29, 2010. I have continuation deposition of Agustin Gonzalez,
May 4, 2010. Jesus Gonzalez, July 22, 2010.
Update deposition of Juana Gonzalez, November 7, 2013. Juana Gonzalez, July 19, 2010.
MR. CHUMBLEY: There's — I don't see it here — I don't know why — but you also read the deposition of Dr. Suchlicki, correct?
THE WITNESS: Yes.
MR. CHUMBLEY: He read the deposition of Dr. Suchlicki.
MR. HARRIS: Okay.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q All right. So, Doctor, let me — let's begin. That's your — in terms of witness testimony, those are the depositions that you read. Are there any others you haven't covered or any other depositions from any other cases or in this case that you haven't spoken about right now —
A No. That's —
Q — that you looked at?
A That's an entire list.
Q What in your history — in your professional history — designates you as an expert witness in this case?
A I am a professional historian with a Ph.D. I have over 30 years' experience researching, teaching history. My field of specialty, broadly speaking, is Latin America. More narrowly, the Hispanic Caribbean, with particular emphasis on Cuba, which is the topic I've been devoting the most energy and time to, including the period of the Cuban Revolution, beginning in 1959, up to the present.
Q Okay. Do you know Dr. Suchlicki?
A I don't know him personally.
Q Are you familiar with the Cuban Studies Institute?
A Yes, I am.
Q Okay. The — where were you born?
A I was born in Havana, Cuba.
Q What year?
A 19 60.
Q Okay. When did you leave?
A 1962.
Q Okay. So is it safe to say you don't remember anything about your life in Cuba between 1960 and 1962?
A That's correct.
Q Where did you emigrate to?
A I — my family briefly came to Miami. After a few weeks — maybe a couple months — we moved to Lima, Peru.
Q Right. And then where?
A In 1970, we moved to Puerto Rico.
Q Okay. And after that?
A I lived in Puerto Rico until I was — until
1986.
Q Okay. After that?
A I came to the United States to pursue a doctorate in Latin American history.
Q You got your — you got your BA at the University of Puerto Rico —
A Correct.
Q — is that correct? And your MA in history at the University of Puerto Rico?
A That's correct.
Q Rio Piedras?
A That's correct.
Q Then from there you went to Duke?
A That's correct.
Q All right. When you graduated with a Ph.D., did you begin teaching?
A Yes, I did.
Q Where were your teaching positions?
A My first teaching position was at Augusta College.
Q Right. Are they on your CV?
A Yes.
Q Do you have a copy of your CV present?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Yes. He brought the most current version with him.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Can you have the —
MR. CHUMBLEY: I'm sorry. Say again?
MR. HARRIS: Can somebody have the court
reporter mark it as Exhibit 1?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Hold on. Looking for it.
(Exhibit 1 was marked for identification.)
MR. CHUMBLEY: It’s been marked.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Sir, if you could take a look at your CV, this will speed things up a little bit. You — on what page is your teaching experience listed?
A On the first page there's — we find the names of the institutions and the years where I taught.
Q Okay.
A And that continues onto the following page.
Q Well, I — on the first page, August State University, Colgate, Rutgers and University of Central Florida. Have you taught anywhere else besides those four institutions?
A Yes, I have.
Q I must not have your most current CV then. Where else have you taught, other than that — other than those four which I have?
A Okay. My first teaching experience was at the University of Puerto Rico in Rio Piedras.
Q Right.
A I taught there — it was just one class — in the fall of 183.
Q Okay.
A The next was Interamerican University of Puerto Rico, '85, '86. Then Augusta State University 1990, '92. Colgate University 1992, 1994. I had a visiting professorship at the University of Puerto Rico for part of the year in 2003. I also taught courses at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania —
Q Right.
A — 2003 and 2004.
My teaching at Rutgers University is from 1994 through 2 0 0 4.
Q Okay.
A And the last one is — since 2004 — the University of Central Florida.
Q Okay. In all of those teaching positions, did you ever teach a course specifically on Cuba and history?
A Yes, I have.
Q And you know — do you have listed on this CV the courses that you taught relating to Cuba and history?
A If you see, on the second page, on the "teaching expertise" —
Q Right.
A — there's a little paragraph that's — toward
the last sentence — says, "History course — national history courses on Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic."
Q Right. So that was — Cuba was studied along with Puerto Rico and the DR —
A No.
Q — or was that taught as a separate course?
A No. I've been teaching that Cuba course as a separate course at least as far back as 1994.
Q Since you became a doctor of history, have you ever taught a course on Cuban smoking?
A I have taught courses on Cuban history, which touch upon the history of tobacco somewhat. That's the extent.
Q Okay. So you didn't — you're not an expert in Cuban cigarettes, are you?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I'm a historian who has studied Cuba and who, over the past few years, has studied the history of tobacco in Cuba, of smoking, of what types of cigarettes were available, about what types of warnings the population received, and other related topics.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Let's take — let's take cigars off the
table. This case doesn't involve cigar smoking. We know cigars are a big economic and — a large economic and historical significance in Cuba.
We're speaking about cigarettes. Is it safe to say your only knowledge relating to Cuban cigarettes or cigarettes smoked in Cuba, whether from Cuba or the U.S., was developed as a result of your being retained in what's called these Engle cases? Is that correct?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: As far as cigarettes go, yes.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Who's paying your fees?
A Jones Day.
Q Okay. Do you know that Jones Day represents R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?
A Yes.
Q And you also know — are you getting paid directly from them?
A Yes.
Q All right. Do you know how much money you have billed in this — how many — strike that. Do you know what your fees are in this particular case so far?
MR. CHUMBLEY: We brought the invoices, if you
want him to refer to that, J.B.
MR. HARRIS: Let's go ahead and mark that,
please.
MR. CHUMBLEY: I thought you'd ask for them, so we brought them.
MR. HARRIS: That's fine. Have her mark those.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Let me find them.
(Exhibit 2 was marked for identification.)
MR. HARRIS: Thank you.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor, how much — what is the extent of your fees in this case?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: In terms of per hour, it's $225.
MR. HARRIS: Right.
THE WITNESS: And in terms of hours, specifically for this case, is about 130 hours.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. So that's $2,000 and change — or $20,000? What's the total bill?
A It's about 27,000.
Q 27,000. Have you been paid?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I have been paid. There's — one of the invoices was sent recently, so I have not received payment for that one yet.
Q Okay. All right. What — let's see here.
When you were retained — let's see, you testified in
—	see how many cases you testified in — you testified in the Clinton case, right, versus Brown & Williamson?
A Did you say Clinton?
Q Clinton, right.
A No.
Q I have on your — on the disclosure statement
—	that's not your statement. I'm sorry. Wrong expert. You've testified in Ojeda, right?
A That's correct.
Q And Skolnick?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Just for clarity sake, are you talking about depositions or in-trial testimony?
MR. HARRIS: It says "previous testimony." It doesn't say on your disclosure statement.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Okay. Go ahead.
MR. HARRIS: I'm asking if — tell you what, go ahead and mark the disclosure, please, as — what are we? Three?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Did you bring the disclosure with you? Here it is. Hold on. That was — that was included in the material you sent up here, right ?
MR. HARRIS: That's correct. I think — ours may be marked Number 2. But since I marked other things, this will be three.
MR. CHUMBLEY: It's marked Number 1 on the things you sent over, but we'll mark it as three here.
MR. HARRIS: Disregard that. It's Tab 1. Disregard that. We'll stay in the order in which we're doing it over the phone.
So has that been marked as Number 3?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Not yet. You have to stop talking before she can mark it.
MR. HARRIS: I thought I would talk and let her mark it at the same time.
(Exhibit 3 was marked for identification.)
MR. CHUMBLEY: It's been marked, J.B.
MR. HARRIS: Thank you.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor?
A Yes.
Q I just want to get it on the record. Can you take a look at this document — excuse me — and turn to page — well, it doesn't have this many pages, but it says "18" at the bottom.
A Yes.
Q Okay. You see your name there, is that correct ?
A At the bottom, yes.
Q All right. If you go forward until the end, you'll see this is relating to your area of expertise, subject matter of expert testimony, and so forth. Is that correct?
A I see those headings, yes.
Q Okay. Have you seen this document before today?
A Yes.
Q All right. So if you go to Page 20, it has listed here — excuse me — it has listed here the cases in which you've testified in. And it doesn't appear to distinguish between deposition testimony or trial testimony. So, as I was asking, you testified in Ojeda, right?
A Yes.
Q Okay. Was that in trial or deposition or
both?
A I don't remember if it was both.
Q Okay. How about Larkin? Same question.
A Larkin, I know — I gave testimony in court.
I don't remember — I think I remember having had a deposition on that one as well.
Q Okay. And the next one, I guess it's pronounced Bakst.
A I see that, but I don't recognize that name.
Q Is it possible you didn't have any affiliation with that case at all?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Hold on. It might be known by another name.
MR. SMALL: That's the Odom case he referred to. It was renamed recently to Bakst.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Does "Odom" ring a bell, Doctor?
A Yes.
Q Did you testify in deposition, in trial, or
both?
A Deposition.
Q Okay. Skolnick. Same question.
A Skolnick. Deposition.
Q And Wendel?
A Deposition.
Q Other than the cases listed here, are there any other cases in which you've testified, either in deposition or trial, that were not included in this list?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Okay. This is for the past three years, Dr. Martinez-Fernandez.
Q You know, to the best of your knowledge. Did you testify in Blasco (phonetic) also?
A No.
Q Suarez?
A Yes.
Q Okay.
MR. CHUMBLEY: For the record, I believe the Suarez deposition occurred after the most recent disclosure that we gave in this case for Dr. Martinez-Fernandez .
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Do you know how many of the cases that we just reviewed, including Suarez — strike that. How many of the cases listed on Page 20 of this disclosure and Page 21 involved Cuban smokers?
A Ojeda. From this list, as far as I can tell, Ojeda.
MR. CHUMBLEY: And Suarez. He's including Suarez.
THE WITNESS: Oh.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q We'll get to that. Was Suarez a Cuban smoker? A Yes.
Q You've got one, two, three, four, five, six,
including Suarez. And of those six, two involve Cuban smokers, right? Ojeda and Suarez?
A That's correct.
Q Why were you called to testify in cases not involving Cuban smokers, like Larkin, for example?
A Because of my many years of experience doing research in matters related to awareness about tobacco and health.
Q Where, though? In Latin America? In the
U.S. ?
A In Puerto Rico and the United States.
Q Okay. How many years?
A I believe I began in 2001.
MR. CHUMBLEY: You began your research in
2001?
THE WITNESS: Working cases.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Okay.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q So you began researching in 2001 this broad topic?
A That's correct.
Q Why were you doing that? Was — were you approached by Jones Day or a tobacco company — cigarette company — to undertake this type of research?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I was originally approached by a firm in Puerto Rico, and then I began communications with Jones Day.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q How did you — do you recall — I'm sorry. By "a firm," you mean a law firm?
A That's correct.
Q Okay. How did you go about commencing your research?
A To obtain knowledge relating to the health effects of smoking in Puerto Rico and the U.S.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: First of all, I planned a strategy in terms of thinking of all the possible forms of communication that could lead to awareness about the negative consequences of smoking and the fact that it could be addictive.
Then I pursued research looking at a variety of documents, including government documents, school materials, materials put out by not-for-profit organizations, the media and other sources.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q How long was it between the date of your
beginning your research into this topic until your first deposition was taken, do you recall?
A Deposition? That's probably — I can give you an estimate date that may or may not be accurate.
Q Well, estimate.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Dr. Martinez-Fernandez, I don't want you to guess. If it's an educated estimate, that's fine. But if it's just a flat-out guess, I don't want you to guess.
THE WITNESS: At this point it would be more of a guess.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Well, I mean, if you look at — at the six cases in which you testified in —
MR. CHUMBLEY: J.B., those six cases, if you read the disclosure, those are cases within the last three years. I'm not sure that's the entire universe of the cases where he's testified. It may be. But the disclosure itself says within the last three years.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor, is this the universe of cases you've testified in involving tobacco or cigarette smoking?
A Are you referring to the ones listed on Page 20?
Q 18 — I'm sorry — yes, 20 and 21.
A It is not the universe.
Q You have a list of all the cases you've testified in involving tobacco or cigarettes?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Do you have a list like that?
THE WITNESS: I don't have one.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. But you did state earlier, I believe, that you were contacted by a firm in Puerto Rico. In what year?
A 2001.
Q 2001. So between 2001 and the date of your first deposition, you don't recall how long that was?
A I can't give you that with certainty.
Q Is that information that you would have in a file somewhere, your office or your records?
A I do have — I believe I have that, yes.
Q Okay. Would you be willing to produce that to Mr. Chumbley and Mr. Cruz-Alvarez?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Produce what? If you want him to try to produce an answer to the question, that's one thing. If you want him to produce whatever it is he's going to be looking at —
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q I want a list of all the cases he's testified
MR. CHUMBLEY: He told you he doesn't have that list.
Does such a list exist?
THE WITNESS: I don't have that here.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Can you compile a list or retrieve such a list and produce it to me?
A Yes.
MR. CHUMBLEY: He could. But whether we agree to do it or not is another issue. The rules require —
MR. HARRIS: You want to catch that flight tonight at 6:30?
MR. CHUMBLEY: I'm doing what the rules require. That requires you to provide a list of testimony within a reasonable time. We've done that for the last three years, which we consider to be a reasonable time.
I'll take your request under advisement and let you know. He doesn't have it today. There's no sense in talking about it today. He doesn't have it.
MR. HARRIS: Well —
MR. CHUMBLEY: I understand —
And if you keep interrupting my deposition, you're going to miss that flight. So let me proceed.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Were you paid for the research you did,
Doctor, or were you simply paid for your testimony?
A I'm paid for both research and testimony.
Q Okay. Have you ever published any articles on cigarette smoking in any publication, whether it related to American cigarette smoking or cigarette smoking in Cuba?
A I have not.
Q Okay. Have you ever published any books on the same topics?
A No.
Q Have you ever given any lectures on those topics ?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I've given lectures on Cuba where the subject of tobacco is part of that — of the lecture.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Has that strictly been limited to cigars? Or was it cigarettes? I'm only interested in cigarettes.
A I don't remember having spoken about
cigarettes.
Q Let's go through your disclosure, please. On Page 19, the area of expertise, I think we covered that, right? I'm just going through the broader headings at the top.
A I see the heading, yes.
Q So we covered your area of expertise. You're a professor at UCF, and you have your CV attached — the most recent one — is that right?
A That's correct.
MR. CHUMBLEY: The most recent CV has been marked as an exhibit. There was no attachment to
—	to the disclosure you sent up here. And I'm assuming, J.B., for the record, that this is the most recent disclosure that we served you for Dr. Martinez-Fernandez. Because what you have sent up here and what we've marked is not dated.
MR. HARRIS: And there's no date on this.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Under the next heading, "subject matter of expert testimony," it looks, to me, like
Dr. Martinez-Fernandez is expected to testify about the history of the use of tobacco and cigarettes in Florida, Cuba and the United States. Is that sentence in your disclosure statement, Doctor?
A Yes.
Q From what time frame — what time period of history are you prepared to testify about?
A I can go back to the early colonial era at the time of the discovery of the New World.
Q And from that period moving to the present day? Or was there some cutoff?
A Basically, the last few years.
Q Okay. And, again, for clarification, when it says "use of tobacco," we're talking about cigarettes in this case, is that correct?
A In this case —
Q It says -- per your disclosure — it says "use of tobacco." What are you referring to there?
A Well, what I mean here is tobacco, broadly, and then more specifically, cigarettes.
Q Okay. But cigars were invented way before cigarettes, is that correct?
A Yes.
Q And when, in your mind, were cigarettes first invented?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I've seen allusion to them
beginning in the 1850s. Probably before.
Q When was the modern-day cigarette invented?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I'm not clear what you mean by "modern."
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q When was the flue-cured tobacco invented, rather?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I'm not sure of that.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Can you read the next sentence to yourself, please, beginning with, "He will also testify about the information."
A "He will also testify about the information disseminated to the public concerning the health risks associated with smoking cigarettes and the public's knowledge of those risks."
Q When you refer to "the public," which public are you referring to?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I'm referring to the public — for this case, in particular — the public in Cuba, where Mr. Gonzalez lived, and also the public in the United States.
Q Okay. What methodology did you use to determine the universe of information or the information environment that the public in Cuba had or was exposed to involving the risk of cigarettes?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I've used the usual methodology, which includes attention to newspapers, magazines, government reports, posters, word-of-mouth, a variety of other sources.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Do you have, by way of example, any of those publications, or can you point to any of those publications that would support your position relating to the public's knowledge?
A Sure.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: One of them is Bohemia.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q That's a magazine, is that correct?
A That's correct.
Q And what years of Bohemia did you review?
A I looked at various years, beginning in the 1950s. And, actually, beyond that. I used a search mechanism for that.
Q Do you know whether or not — do you know whether or not Mr. Gonzalez read Bohemia?
A I have no way of knowing that one way or another.
Q Okay. All right. And what in Bohemia supports your conclusion that there was information about the risk associated with smoking cigarettes?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: There were several articles that
appeared as well as some ads for products.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q And this was pre — pre-embargo, is that correct ?
A Yes.
Q Did Bohemia — was Bohemia published after Castro took power?
A Yes.
Q Do you know whether or not any of those articles that you're referring to appeared in Bohemia after Castro took power?
A I would have — I don't have a recollection of that at this point.
Q Okay. Of the ones you do recall, do you have dates that you recall, or can you — can you give me the specific date or volume of those editions in which
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I read some from the early 1950s. I recall 1958 through 1961. And there are many other years as well.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Do you have the actual articles listed in your — in your bibliography?
MR. CHUMBLEY: You mean his reliance list?
MR. HARRIS: Yeah, your reliance list.
THE WITNESS: Yes. I've seen those, and they're there.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Do you have them highlighted, by any chance?
A No.
Q Okay. Do you know whether or not Bohemia was distributed in the town of Arusco (phonetic), where Mr. Gonzalez was born or from?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: It was a national magazine, and I understand that it was distributed throughout the country.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Do you know whether or not Mr. Gonzalez could
read Spanish?
A Yes.
Q Do you know the level of education Mr. Gonzalez had?
A I recall somewhat what level he has — he had.
Q Does your recollection recall that he quit school when he was 12 years old?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: That date sounds familiar.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Would you expect a Cuban male who quit school at 18 to be in the demographic of people who would read Bohemia?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q But you don't know whether or not the Gonzalez family subscribed to Bohemia?
A I don't have information one way or the other pertaining to that.
Q All right. Now let's move to the next disclosure statement. Quote, In addition,
Dr. Martinez-Fernandez will testify about information disseminated to the public concerning the fact that some people, once they start smoking, find it very
difficult to quit.
What sources of information would have contained that in Cuba?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Generally speaking, it would have been the same sources. Again, what I gave you last time was not a comprehensive list of sources. There are others besides the one that I mentioned. BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. What other — what other — what other sources do you have in mind in addition to Bohemia?
A One of them would be the bulletins of the Cuban Cancer League.
Q Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about the Cuban Cancer League?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q When was it established?
A I don't have a clear recollection of the specific date when it was established.
Q Was it part of the medical community, or was it a charitable organization, like the American Cancer Society? How would you define it?
A It was more along the lines of the American Cancer Society.
Q And what was its purpose?
A The purpose was to combat cancer, to support research, to support patients, and to — to educate about cancer.
Q Okay. Do you know, is the organization still in existence? Did it survive the revolution?
A It is in existence in Miami. As far as Cuba goes, other health organizations took on those tasks.
Q Okay. Mr. Gonzalez left Cuba in 1980. Are you aware of that?
A Yes.
Q Okay. Did this cancer organization exist between the time he was born and the time he left Cuba?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. Not all of that period,
but it did exist.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Do you know whether or not these bulletins were distributed nationally?
A I believe that the distribution was national,
yes .
Q Do you have any of those bulletins contained in your reliance materials?
A I don't have the exact number in mind.
Q Do you have samples of those bulletins?
MR. CHUMBLEY: On your reliance list, he's asking.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Do you know — do you know whether or not Mr. Gonzalez ever saw any of the bulletins you're referring to?
A I have no way of saying that one way or the other.
Q Okay. So you've mentioned Bohemia, you mentioned the bulletins, the cancer society and Cuba. What other sources would you point to as disseminating the message that smoking is bad for you or has a risk inherent in smoking?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: The Diario de la Marina.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q What is that?
A That was a major newspaper in Cuba that circulated before the revolution.
Q Can you say that a little slowly for me, please?
A Yes. The title of the newspaper is Diario — Q Diario. Okay.
A — de la Marina.
Q I'm familiar with that. Okay.
And with Diario, what did they do? Run ads? Articles? What is it you looked at?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: They had numerous articles on the subject.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q And that — did you say Diario lasted until the revolution? Or did I misunderstand that?
A Well, my understanding is that in 1960 it ceased to exist.
Q And what took its place? A State-run newspaper?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: There were a couple of papers that were circulating during the early years of the revolution.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Do you know their names?
A One of them is Revolucion.
Q Anything else?
A Hora, H-O-R-A.
Q Right.
A And I — the other one is El Mundo.
Q Right.
Q The ones you just mentioned, were they State-sanctioned newspapers?
A As far as — well, let's see, the government acquired El Mundo. The two other ones were circulating before. One was the official newspaper of the communist party, and that was Hoy. The other one was the newspaper of the 2 6th of July Movement.
Q Right. Now, by my count here, you've mentioned five different publications. I'm not going to read them back to you, because I didn't commit them to memory.
Of those five you just mentioned, did you — did those publications have articles or health warnings regarding the risk of cigarette smoking?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I don't recall Hoy. El Mundo, yes. I don't have — I'm not sure about Revolucion.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q You read Dr. Suchlicki's deposition, is that correct ?
A Yes.
Q Did you read the section where he mentioned that for a brief period of time, I think, Fidel
undertook a health campaign to quit smoking, but then he realized that would be an economic — cause an economic downturn for the country, so he stopped talking about the risks of smoking?
A I would rather see the segment in that deposition so that I can give you a better answer.
Q Well, does that — my paraphrasing that event
—	cause you to recall any — from a historical perspective — anything that may have happened that related to that type of conduct on Castro's behalf?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
MR. HARRIS: Essentially, he shifted policies in terms of his views on smoking.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: So I can give you a full and honest answer, I would have to read that segment and the context of that segment.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Well, that's a good segue into the final sentence in this paragraph. It says you may also comment on the opinions expressed by other witnesses in the case to the extent they are related to your area of expertise.
I assume — first of all, what other witnesses would you comment on?
A I'm not sure what witnesses I will be commenting on.
Q Well, you said you read Dr. Suchlicki's testimony already, correct?
A That's right.
Q And are you prepared today to make any comments about his testimony?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I read the — I read the testimony. In order for me to address any aspect of that, I really need to look at what particular segment of that document we're referring to.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q After reading Dr. Suchlicki's testimony, do you consider him to be an expert on Cuban history?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: He is an expert on Cuban history.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Is there any reason why you would determine that he is not qualified to testify in this case?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form. Calls for a legal conclusion.
THE WITNESS: I have no basis to answer that.
Q Okay. By the way, Doctor, the statements that I'm referring to in the disclosure statement, did you write these yourself?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: These are — this disclosure is very similar to previous disclosures. And the original disclosure was something that I wrote.
And, of course, each case is different.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Right. But did you have — did you have a chance to review the content of this disclosure or previous disclosures that are similar to this one prior to its publication?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
I think he's asking you did you review it before we sent it to him. I think that's what he's asking.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. So you approved — you approved the content of the disclosure, right?
A Yes.
Q Now, under the substance of "facts and opinions," it says here that you're expected to testify
that for centuries a variety of sources have disseminated information to the public about the health risks associated with smoking and the use of tobacco.
How do you — how did you reach that conclusion?
A Based on the research that I've been doing for the last 12 years or so.
Q And when you say "centuries," what century are you beginning with?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: As far back as I can go is the early encounters between European explorers and the natives who introduced tobacco to Europeans. And that would be late 1500 — the late 1400s.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q And you found information going back that far relating to the health risk of smoking?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form. Go ahead.
THE WITNESS: I found information about the — the fact that it was difficult to quit and also about the consequences. I don't recall any specifics.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Do you know when lung cancer became a widely suspected outcome from smoking in the United States?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Could you repeat the question?
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Do you have any information relating to the rate of lung cancer from the time you began researching this topic, say the 1500s until the present day? When was lung cancer first suspected as a — as related to smoking?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I have seen evidence to that effect. I don't recall, specifically, the earliest one. But I have seen, actually, some documentation that as far back as the 1700s tobacco and cancer were associated. And some of this appeared in — in the scientific literature. And, of course, there was knowledge of a variety of lung ailments associated with smoking that was made public.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Again, I ask, is that information contained on your — your reliance materials — or contained in your reliance materials?
A I believe so, yes.
Q And it's your testimony that smoking tobacco in the colonial period and during the time of the explorers was as dangerous as smoking cigarettes that
are considered to be the modern-day version of cigarettes ?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q In other words, when people were smoking cigarettes in the time period you referred to earlier, the 1500s, weren't they smoking raw tobacco rather than cured tobacco?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I don't recall that they were smoking cigarettes in the 1500s.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q So you're simply referring to tobacco just rolled up and smoked, right?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: In a variety of forms. It could be snuff. It could be —
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q What about — go ahead.
A It could be cigars.
Q What about just rolled-up tobacco —
(Court reporter asks for question to be
repeated.)
MR. CHUMBLEY: My cough got in the way.
Q What about pipes? Like the Indians smoked pipes, and they smoked it with tobacco, is that right?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Yeah. Pipes was another form. BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Let's move forward. It says here in the next paragraph that you're expected to testify that during the life of Agustin Gonzalez, before and after he began to smoke, information that cigarette smoking could be hazardous to your health and could cause serious diseases, including deadly illness, and that some smokers could find it very difficult to quit was widely disseminated and available to the public, including Agustin Gonzalez.
How was it available to Agustin Gonzalez? Through what means?
A It was available to Mr. Gonzalez through a variety of means, beginning with the home setting, where his parents, according to the deposition, warned him against smoking.
This is also something that would have been manifested through word-of-mouth, which is a very important form of communication in Cuban society.
This is also something that was addressed in
the curricula in the schools, such as the one that Mr. Gonzalez attended.
This kind of information was also made available through magazines, through newspapers, and — and other forms of communication.
Q Okay. Would the fact that Mr. Gonzalez may or may not have been able to afford cigarettes because of their cost, would that play any role in deterring him from smoking?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I have no opinion on that.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Despite the fact that his parents told him not to smoke because it cost too much money?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Could you repeat the question?
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Wasn't it — didn't his parents tell him not to smoke because of the cost of smoking — in other words, the cost of purchasing cigarettes as opposed to food and that they were very — they were desperately poor and the money they had needed to go to food rather than cigarettes?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
brother's deposition, Tomas. And I don't recall the — that the admonition about not smoking had to do with cost. That's my recollection.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Do you recall that Agustin grew up in a house that had no floor? In other words, it was dirt.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I vaguely remember that.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Would you expect that the home of a rural Cuban growing up in the '30s, '40s and '50s, where they lived in a house that had a dirt floor, would have the means to buy the magazines and newspapers that you referred to?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I can't pass judgment on that. But what I can tell you is that you can read a magazine without buying it.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q But whether or not Mr. Gonzalez actually did that, you wouldn't know, right?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Whether he did what? I'm sorry. BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Read a magazine or not.
A I — I — I can't say one way or the other whether he read any specific magazine.
Q Okay. Including magazines that would contain health information on smoking?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: What I can tell you is that I don't know directly. But I can tell you, based on my knowledge of Cuban society and culture, that information that reached individuals was disseminated through word of mouth. Cuba has a very strong oral tradition.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q What about — you said that there were health warnings in textbooks, is that correct?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I — I don't recall whether I used the word "health warnings" as such. But there was coverage of that in various textbooks, yes.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Do you know what years those — that covered?
A I don't have that information with me.
Q Okay. How about what decade? Do you know
that ?
A I know that these materials pertain to the period during which — some of these materials pertain
to the period during which Mr. Gonzalez was in school.
Q Do you have any — do you have any of the books you're referring to?
MR. CHUMBLEY: You mean physically? Or are you asking if they're on his reliance list?
MR. HARRIS: On your reliance list or in your files somewhere.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
Go ahead, Doctor.
THE WITNESS: I believe they — they are.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q If you were — if you are to testify in this trial, would you be bringing those books with you?
A I'm not sure whether I would be asked to bring them or not.
Q Okay. Let's see. Doctor, just so I'm clear, your testimony is that — that Mr. Gonzalez would have seen coverage of the topic of health and smoking in his
—	in textbooks for grades one through six —
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
MR. HARRIS: — since he quit school when he was 12 years old?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I can't tell you.
MR. HARRIS: Which would have been in the
1940s.
THE WITNESS: I can't tell you, specifically, for every grade, but I know that it was a part of the curriculum, and that the schools he attended were called civic military schools, which paid extraordinary attention to physical fitness and, of course, were also academic.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Let's see, moving to the next paragraph, you talk about there was debate within the scientific, medical and public health communities regarding the issue — regarding this issue, which received widespread national and international attention in the press and the media.
Are you talking about in the U.S. or in Cuba in the 1950s?
A May I look at the paragraph again?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Let him look at the paragraph. He wants to read it.
THE WITNESS: Yes. I read the first two sentences, and that's what — that's my opinion.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q I understand that. Are you talking about the U.S. or Cuba here?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Or both?
THE WITNESS: Both.
Q Okay. Well, I'm interested in Cuba in the 1950s. Was there a substantial scientific, medical and public health community or public health communities in existence in Cuba in the 1950s?
A Yes. Cuba actually had a very strong medical infrastructure compared to other countries in Latin America. They had a very active scientific community. And it had — I believe, more than any other country, Latin America had a very large circulation of newspapers and radio, tv.
Q Do you know whether or not Mr. Gonzalez had a radio or television in Cuba?
A If I recall correctly from the depositions, he had one after the revolution.
Q Had one what?
A A tv. Radio is something that would have been ubiquitous in Cuba before the revolution.
Q It says here that extensive coverage of the smoking and health issues continued throughout the 1950s, and was particularly intense in 1854. What was it about the year 1954 that made coverage of those issues intense?
A Those were years of new research being
conducted, both in Great Britain and the United States, that was making very strong connections between smoking tobacco and a variety of diseases, including lung cancer.
Q Do you know whether or not Mr. Gonzalez was aware of this — you know, this revolution in the scientific community in 1954?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: As part of Cuban society and in Cuban society, that kind of information was made available to the public in a variety of ways. As a member of that society, yes, he would have been aware of that.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q But you don't know that for certain, is that right ?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I know that from an early age he received that kind of advice from his parents about not smoking and it being bad for him.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. What about did — you mentioned the surgeon general's advisory committee. Does Cuba have an equivalent — or did it have an equivalent to the surgeon general in the '50s and '60s?
A It had a health ministry which would have been in charge of public health. Besides the health ministry, there were a number of non-governmental organizations, such as the cancer society that I mentioned.
Then after the revolution, there was a new Ministry of Health, of course, and that's a period during which information to the public, in terms of prevention of disease, was really — really became something extraordinarily massive, because of the efforts of the government to provide information to the public about health and the prevention of disease.
Q You're talking about the government in Cuba?
A Yes.
Q Did Cuban — let me ask this way. Did American cigarettes sold in Cuba before the revolution contain warning labels?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
Go ahead, Doctor.
THE WITNESS: I — I haven't seen any evidence to that, no.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q How about Cuban cigarettes sold in Cuba before and after the revolution? Did they contain warning labels ?
A Not before. But after the revolution, yes.
Q And what were the warning labels on Cuban cigarettes? What types of warning labels did they contain?
A I can tell you the text. "Fumar dana la salud" (phonetic).
Q What does that mean?
A "Smoking harms your health."
Q Okay. Is that — was that on all cigarette packets, or just selected ones?
A That would have been uniform.
MR. HARRIS: Doctor, would you care to take a
five-minute break?
THE WITNESS: Sure. I appreciate that.
MR. HARRIS: Okay. Five or 10 minutes?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Okay.
MR. HARRIS: Off the record, please.
(THEREUPON, a break was taken.)
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor, are you there?
A Yes, sir.
Q All right. Now, some of the information contained in the disclosure seems a bit repetitive. I guess to the extent that you're stating, you know, again in the — in the next paragraph that this is —
the information about the health risks of smoking was widespread and well known. Is that what the essence of your testimony is, given this disclosure statement?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Are you referring to some line or paragraph?
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q I'm on Page 20, the first full paragraph, up near the top of the page. The one that begins "Dr. Martinez-Fernandez is expected to testify" so on and so on.
A I see that.
Q Does that summarize your testimony, that paragraph? If you'll read it for me. Read it to yourself.
MR. CHUMBLEY: He's read it. The question again was what, J.B.?
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Does that summarize the essence of your testimony, what you expect to testify to at trial?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Only partially.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q All right. Well, I need to hear from you, you know, the extent of what you intend to testify to if
and when you're called to trial in this case.
A It's hard for me to tell, because I don't know what questions I'm going to be asked.
MR. CHUMBLEY: He did say, in the beginning of this deposition, as I recall, J.B., that he was going to talk about the availability of American cigarettes in Cuba, and I think, stuff like that, which wouldn't necessarily be covered by that paragraph.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Well, what — what research have you done regarding the availability of American cigarettes in Cuba, and what testimony are you prepared to give based on that research?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I looked at a variety of sources on that subject. And based on that testimony, based on those sources, what I discovered is that, before the revolution, the availability of American cigarettes was only a very, very small proportion of what was available to the consuming public. Roughly, around three, four, five percent, max.
I also found that — after the revolution — that the availability of American cigarettes, based on what I have seen, they were no longer being —
at least in early '61 would have been, perhaps, the latest when U.S. cigarettes were being sent to Cuba. Again, that is based on the information that I have looked at.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q All right. And what information did you look at where you were able to conclude that American cigarettes only made up three to five percent of the market for cigarettes in Cuba prior to the revolution?
A I recall reading that in a — in a Cuban magazine that had produced government statistics to that effect.
Q Okay. Was there — do you know whether or not there were — the cigarette companies, like Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds had distribution facilities in Cuba prior to the revolution?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I haven’t seen that.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Do you know whether they advertised American brands in Cuba?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Who’s "they"?
MR. HARRIS: R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
Tobacco Company advertising a variety of cigarettes from different parts of the world.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Who is Roberts Tobacco Company?
A Roberts Tobacco Company was a distributor of tobacco products in Cuba, and they were also publishers.
Q Were they an American company?
A I believe that Mr. Roberts was American, and he had become established in Cuba.
Q Okay. So we've talked about the information environment in Cuba relating to the health effects of smoking. We talked about the — what you — what you've described as a relatively small market share in Cuba for American cigarettes — for the sale of American cigarettes.
What other areas of expertise are you — do you intend to testify to in this case?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I really can't anticipate what kind of questions I'm going to be asked.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor, I'm not asking you to anticipate what type of questions you're going to be asked. I'm trying to determine the scope of your expertise. You're a
historian on Latin America and Cuba. You have an expertise, according to this disclosure, on the information that was disseminated relating to the health effects of smoking. You have some information or expertise in the area of marketing American cigarettes. The effect of the revolution on the subsequent sale of American cigarettes. What other areas of expertise do you have?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I have many other areas of expertise, as you're defining that. For example, rationing in Cuba. I have knowledge of the embargo.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q As it relates to the sale and consumption of cigarettes in Cuba — American cigarettes in Cuba?
A That's correct.
Q And what effect did the embargo have on the consumption of American cigarettes in Cuba?
A It put a stop to the importation — exportation from the U.S.
Q But isn't it true that it created a black market for American cigarettes in Cuba?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
been — was there a black market in Cuba?
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q For American cigarettes, yes.
A I'm not aware of that.
Q You're not aware of a black market in Cuba for American cigarettes?
A I'm not aware of that, no.
Q What about — what about an inventory — an existing inventory of American cigarettes in Cuba post-embargo or post-revolution? In other words, is your testimony that the cigarettes dried up the day after the revolution or the day after the embargo?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: What I know is that even prior to the embargo the Cuban government was making every effort possible for Cubans to stop smoking foreign cigarettes. And that began very, very early in the revolution.
What I can tell you, also, is that even before the embargo came into effect in February of 1962, the exportation of tobacco products to Cuba dropped significantly, so that, by 1961, it was very, very small compared to previous years.
I can, also, tell you — well, this is something that — in terms of an inventory, I don't
have specific information on that. But due to the fact that Cuba and the United States were so close geographically and that they had so much interchange commercially and as far as even ferries, that perhaps that proximity and those links did not require a high level of inventory. That is a conclusion that I am reaching based on everything that I know about Cuba and the United States.
I should also add that it would have been virtually impossible for anybody to keep an inventory of cigarettes given the type of police state that was established in Cuba.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Doctor, do you recall the testimony of Mr. Gonzalez where he spoke about obtaining American cigarettes from sailors who would come to the port in Havana?
A I recall mention of that. I also recall mention of the fact that the vast majority of what he smoked were Cuban cigarettes. But I do remember hearing something about sailors.
Q Would that have been considered — buying cigarettes from sailors after the revolution, would that have been considered black-market cigarettes?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: That would have been contraband. And that would have been illegal. And that's —
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Aren't black-market cigarettes considered illegal, by definition — by their definition?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: In Cuba, yes.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. So if he obtained cigarettes from sailors — foreign sailors who came to Havana — he would have been obtaining black-market cigarettes, is that correct?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I don't know whether that's a technical term or not. What I can tell you is that would have been very risky business, particularly because of the fact that people could get in trouble.
Mr. Gonzalez himself got in trouble with the law for having illegal products in his home. So that's the kind of regime that was established.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q What was the illegal product?
A Illegal in terms of the Cuban government's
view of what was legal or illegal, the testimony — the depositions contain information about foods and, if I recall correctly, wine.
Q Okay. Do me a favor, Doctor. Turn to Tab 2 in our notebook we sent up to you.
MR. CHUMBLEY: It didn't come in notebook
form.
MR. HARRIS: Whatever. Clipped.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Okay.
MR. HARRIS: I didn't lick the envelope.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Tab 2 is the reliance materials that I sent you last week. Is that what you think it is?
MR. HARRIS: I believe so. I want him to identify just to authenticate it or identify it.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Do you want the court reporter to mark it as an exhibit?
MR. HARRIS: Correct.
(Exhibit 4 was marked for identification.)
MR. CHUMBLEY: Marked as Exhibit 4. It looks like the reliance list that I sent you last week, but I haven't looked through every page.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q I'm not asking you to look through every page. Does this look like your reliance materials that were
sent to me by counsel?
A Yes.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Just for the record — just for the record, J.B., I sent you more reliance materials yesterday. And, also, obviously, he's relying on the deposition testimony you've already discussed and the other specific case materials, like answers to interrogatories and such like that.
MR. HARRIS: Right. I got that. We did receive the additional supplemental reliance materials yesterday.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Okay.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q As a — just from — from — looks like Document 1 through Document 4930. Is this your core reliance materials, Doctor?
A For this case, yes.
Q Did you create this list?
A This is a list that has been taking shape for some time. Because I've been working on other cases in the past. This is a list that I — particularly for this case — I looked at. And there were some materials that were added to it. It is a list that I accept. I did not put it together in the format that it has, however. But it is my list, yes.
Q Who put it together for you?
A As far as the format and the numbering, this is something that was done by the lawyers.
Q And you're talking about the lawyers at Jones
Day?
A I believe so, yes.
MR. HARRIS: Okay. If the court reporter would mark Tab 3 for us, the next exhibit to the deposition.
MR. CHUMBLEY: J.B., I don't want to change or interrupt you, but you also sent the discs up here, which have the images that relate to the reliance list. I don't know if up want those marked or not. MR. HARRIS: Sure. Go ahead and mark those. MR. CHUMBLEY: We'll — there are three DVDs that contain —
MR. HARRIS: Mark them as one composite. (Exhibit 5 was marked for identification.)
MR. CHUMBLEY: All right, J.B. Now what?
MR. HARRIS: Number 6 will be the re-notice of taking the deposition duces tecum, which is our Tab 3. If you could mark that, please, and hand it to the witness.
(Exhibit 6 was marked for identification.)
MR. HARRIS: Can you hand that to the doctor,
please?
MR. CHUMBLEY: He's got it in front of him.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor, have you seen this document before?
A No.
Q Okay. This is the re-notice of taking your deposition. We had it set previously, but you had some conflict. So in an effort to accommodate you, we changed to today.
A Thank you.
Q If you'd turn to Exhibit A.
A Yes.
Q Let's go down this list. I want to see whether you have complied with this request for the various items on this list.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Keeping in mind that we did serve some objections.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Have you produced with you today all reports, notes, summaries, correspondence, including e-mails, faxes or other records relating to the decedent,
Agustin Gonzalez?
A To the best of my knowledge, yes.
Q The notes that you took, with respect to when you read the depositions of the witnesses, did you keep
separate notes or write in the depositions themselves?
A I kept separate notes.
Q Did you bring copies of your notes?
A Yes.
MR. HARRIS: All right. Why don't you go ahead and have her mark that as the next exhibit.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Do you want all his handwritten notes marked, or just the ones that summarize his reading of the depositions?
MR. HARRIS: All the notes.
MR. CHUMBLEY: All right.
MR. HARRIS: Do it as a composite.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Let me get a clip. Take a look at this, Doctor, and make sure those are your handwritten notes before we have that marked.
I'll look through this stack to see if we're missing some. He's got notes that aren't handwritten, that are typed. Do you want them separately?
MR. HARRIS: No. Put them together.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Okay. Hold on. I need to add.
MR. HARRIS: While you're doing that, Doctor, is there any reason why some of your notes are handwritten and some are typed?
that.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Then we're going to add to that, Doctor, these typed notes. Make sure those contain all your typed notes.
THE WITNESS: (Witness nods head.)
MR. CHUMBLEY: Yes? Okay. Let me put the clip around everything, and we'll have her mark it.
MR. HARRIS: Okay.
(Exhibit 7 was marked for identification.)
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Thank you. Doctor, I don't want to sit here and read, verbatim, every item listed on Exhibit A. Do me a favor, read Item 2 to yourself and tell me whether you complied with Item 2.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Again, subject to the objections that we filed.
THE WITNESS: I did comply.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Same with Item 3?
A I complied as well.
Q All right. Item 4?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Again, this is all assuming they exist. I don't know if anything in Item 4 actually exists in this case.
there's nothing. But as far as having complied with four, everything that I have, I've turned in today.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Have you interviewed anyone in preparation for today's deposition?
A No, I have not.
Q Okay. Number 5?
A Complied as well.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Just — J.B., just so you know, there are a couple additional little odds and ends he brought today that would probably be included in what he refers to as reliance materials.
There are two separate articles that he brought with him today that would be additional reliance materials. If you want me to mark this separately, there are two articles, basically.
MR. HARRIS: I'll — we'll put that on hold until I get through this list. Put it aside for a minute.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Okay.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Number — where are we? Number 6 —
A Complied.
Q Did you review any medical records in
preparation for today's deposition?
A No medical records.
Q Number 7? You gave us that. I have that. Number 8, your invoices, you brought that,
right ?
A That's correct.
Q Number 9. You're going to supplement that by giving it to opposing counsel or the gentleman sitting there, and they will provide me with a comprehensive list, right?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Well, again, subject to me — I mean, we've made an objection as to overbreadth.
And I think a reasonable time is what we've given you in his disclosure, which is the last three years.
So I'm not — I cannot commit, as I set here today, that we'll give you what you are referring to as a comprehensive list.
MR. HARRIS: Well, it says, Between 2007 and the present.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Again, the question is whether that's overbroad. I'm not saying we will, I'm not saying we won't, J.B. But let's move on. You've got the last three years.
Q Number 10.
MR. CHUMBLEY: He brought some of that with him today.
MR. HARRIS: Go ahead and mark the two articles as a composite, and then whatever communications or correspondence that complied with Number 10, and anything else he may have brought.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Hold on. I have to leave the room to get more clips.
Okay, J.B. What do you want marked as the next composite? The articles, or the correspondence.
MR. HARRIS: The articles will be the next
one.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Hold on. She's going to mark it. Don't talk or else she can't mark one.
(Exhibit 8 was marked for identification.)
MR. CHUMBLEY: Then you want the correspondence ?
MR. HARRIS: Correct. That will be nine.
(Exhibit 9 was marked for identification.)
MR. CHUMBLEY: You want me to tell you what else he brought with him?
MR. HARRIS: Go ahead and tell me what you
MR. CHUMBLEY: He also brought what I think is the exact same thing that I sent you yesterday, which you have as Exhibit 20 in the materials that you sent to us.
MR. HARRIS: Okay.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Those are the pictures of the cigarette packages and pictures of some of the health posters —
MR. HARRIS: Okay.
MR. CHUMBLEY: — that existed in Cuba. He brought that.
He brought a copy of your expert witness disclosure. Although I think it's an old one.
Yeah, way back in 2010, when you still had — our
—	hold on.
It says "plaintiff's expert witness disclosure." And he brought — that's from September of 2009. Along with the original expert witness disclosure that we served in this case in February of 2010. He brought that with him.
He brought Plaintiff's notice of service of verified answers to Philip Morris' first set of interrogatories, which was served on September 14, 2009.
He brought Plaintiff's supplemental answers to Defendant Philip Morris' first set of interrogatories served on November 24, 2009.
He brought an original — not an original — but he brought the summons and the complaint, which was filed in the case in 2008.
And he brought Defendant R.J. Reynolds' — the most recent expert disclosure, dated August 21,
2013, which I believe contains the one you've been reading from earlier today. That's it.
MR. HARRIS: Okay. Why don't you put a rubberband or clip around that and mark it. I'm not going to ask questions about them.
MR. CHUMBLEY: How about the stuff that I sent you yesterday? Do you want me to mark that separately?
MR. HARRIS: Yeah. Mark that separately. And everything else that follows, clip it and mark it.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Okay. I'm putting a rubber band around, for lack of a better term, what I would refer to as case filing material. That will be the next composite.
MR. HARRIS: Is that everything?
MR. CHUMBLEY: No. I'm going to mark the — I'm going to take what you have as Exhibit 20 in
your box that you sent up, and I think that's every
—	the same thing that he also brought with him.
MR. HARRIS: Okay.
MR. CHUMBLEY: We'll mark that as the next exhibit. That will be 10.
(Court reporter makes correction regarding exhibit numbers.)
MR. CHUMBLEY: The rogs? Okay. This will be Exhibit 11. Hold on just a second.
(Exhibit 10 and Exhibit 11 was marked for identification. )
MR. CHUMBLEY: Okay, J.B.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. All right. Doctor, let me ask you — before we move on to the ads that were in our materials that we sent up — do you have any way — any way of gauging the comparative knowledge that U.S. citizens had with — compared with Cuban citizens on the health effects of smoking?
In other words, what was the — has there ever been any polling done in Cuba that would determine how much the Cuban people knew and when they knew it with respect to the health effects of smoking?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
that sort.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. And in terms of relative knowledge based on the dissemination of information, do you have any information or empirical studies on that information?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: No empirical studies that I have found.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Let's turn to our Tab 4.
MR. CHUMBLEY: You want that marked?
MR. HARRIS: Hold on one second. Yeah, if you would mark that, please.
(Exhibit 12 was marked for identification.)
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Could you take a look at Number 12, please?
A I have it in front of me, yes.
Q Can you identify this document, first of all, just by reading the title at the top?
A This is a memo from Mr. George Weisman to Mr. G.C. Dawson. And the date is April 1, 1954.
Q And it was — it's published on Philip Morris letterhead, is that correct?
A That's correct.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
Q Can you read it for me and — and let me know if you have ever seen this document before?
A I have seen this document before.
Q Where did you see it?
A I'm not 100 percent sure. I — what seems more possible, based on my recollection, is that this was included in — in the documents that Mr. Suchlicki presented. I don't know that for 100 percent sure, but that's — that's what I think it is.
Q Okay. Can you read it to yourself and tell me if you have an opinion with respect to the last statement, the last paragraph?
A Okay.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Hold on. Let me read it. Let me know when you're done reading it.
THE WITNESS: I'm done reading it.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Okay. What's the question?
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q First of all, it appears as though Mr. Roberts took the position that — that Cubans — Cuba has — has the highest consumption but the lowest incidence of cancer. And Mr. Dawson says his figures do not bear that out.
Do you know which — who's telling the truth here or who has the most accurate figures?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Well, the information provided Mr. Roberts — I don't have any information on whether — on where Cuba ranked as far as the incidents of cancer.
MR. HARRIS: Okay. Okay. Then let's turn to Tab 5. We'll mark that as a composite exhibit, please.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Just for the record, Tab 5 appears to be a composite of either —
MR. HARRIS: Should be a composite of advertisements.
MR. CHUMBLEY: I don't know whether they're actually ads that appeared or actual proofs or what have you. But I want to note for the record, there's highlighting on it that was put on, I assume, by somebody in your office, J.B.
There's blue and yellow highlighting. I want, for the record, to — I want the record to reflect this composite came to us today with the highlighting on it already.
MR. HARRIS: We sent it to you with highlighting so it would be easier to identify.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Okay. I just wanted to make it clear that no one here put that highlighting on.
MR. HARRIS: We did.
(Exhibit 13 was marked for identification.)
MR. HARRIS: Can you take a moment to review the documents, please?
MR. CHUMBLEY: They've been marked as Exhibit 13, for the record. He's looking at them now.
MR. HARRIS: Fine.
THE WITNESS: I've taken a look at them already.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Did you read them, Doctor?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Well, I mean — you want him to read the text for each one?
MR. HARRIS: I want him to review it, not read it into the record.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Well, I mean, he's looked at what's been marked as Exhibit 13. I don't think he's read each and every page word for word. If you want him to do that, he will.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Let me ask you this: Can you confirm that the ads that I sent to you to take a look at — if you can
see it — that the highlighting in yellow indicates that these ads apparently were run by — or were published by the Roberts Tobacco Company?
A I looked at all of them.
Q Let me restate — let me re-ask my question. The name "Roberts Tobacco Company" appears at the foot of each one of these ads, is that right?
A I can see that in most of them. In some of them, it's barely legible, so I can't make it out.
Q Okay. Well, the ones you can make out, it says "Roberts," is that correct?
A "Roberts Tobacco Company."
Q Right. Now — and the ads are of American cigarettes ?
A Well —
Q Like Camel, for example, in the first one. They're all Camel ads, is that right?
A I will disagree that they're ads.
Q What are they?
A They seem to be proofs or some record for ads. But I cannot tell whether they appeared or not — based on what I have in front of me — whether they appeared or not in Cuban publications.
Q Well, if you turn to — if you look at Number 1, for example, the first page —
A Yes.
Q — it says The Havana Post, does it not, week of August 11, 1947?
A Yes.
Q All right. Is there any reason, other than the fact that that would be an advertisement in The Havana Post that it would have, "The Havana Post, week of August 11, 1947"?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: It suggests that. However, I don't know what kind of record this is. Whether this actually took place or not would have to be verified to be 100 percent sure against the actual publication.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q How about the second page?
MR. CHUMBLEY: What's the question?
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Do you see the publications listed at the foot in the blue highlighting?
A Yes.
Q It says Havana Post, Diario de Cuba, Bohemia, Carteles, Informacion, El Pais, El Mundo —
MR. CHUMBLEY: J.B., the court reporter — the court reporter is having trouble. She's not
Hispanic. You have to go slower with those Hispanic titles.
MR. HARRIS: You read it then, Doctor.
THE WITNESS: It’s very hard to read. I'll do my best. The first one is El Camaboyano (phonetic), La Correspondencia. The next one appears to read Avance. The next one Diario de la Marina. El Crisol. El Mundo. El Pais.
MR. HARRIS: I think the next one is El Cristo. No. El Mundo and El Cristo.
THE WITNESS: Well, in the order — I mentioned El Crisol. I mentioned El Mundo. I mentioned El Pais. The next one, I think, is Informacion.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. That's enough. Let me ask you this:
Do you agree that American cigarettes were advertised in Cuba?
A Based on all of the publications I have seen,
I have seen some ads for American cigarettes. However, they are a minority within the universe of ads for cigarettes.
Q That's not my question. My question is: Weren't American cigarettes advertised in Cuba?
A I have seen ads in Cuba, yes.
Q Okay. When you — have you done other — have you done any research on your own to try to quantify the number of ads that ran in Cuba, advertising American cigarettes?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, I have.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q And how many ads were you able to find in your research?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I would say that, maybe — well, I've seen many ads. I have taken a more systematic look at Bohemia, a number of issues, and I've been able to compare the two, meaning the number of ads for American cigarettes and the number of ads for Cuban cigarettes. And if I were to tell you — I couldn't give you an exact ratio, because I don't have that in front of me, but it's much larger than U.S. cigarettes.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. But given the list of cigarettes on the second page that we went through — the list of publications, rather — those are also — those far exceed just one publication of Diario. While Diario may be included, there were a number of other
publications listed there as well, isn't that right?
A There are other publications, that's correct.
Q Now, if you would —
MR. HARRIS: If the court reporter would mark our exhibit — Tab No. 6 as the next exhibit.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Hold on a second. I'm looking for it.
(Exhibit 14 was marked for identification.)
MR. HARRIS: Doctor, if you could read that for me, please.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Read it to yourself. He doesn't want you to read it out loud.
THE WITNESS: I read it.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. So if you look at those ad numbers —
A Yes.
Q — like 1-5255.
A Yes.
Q And, for example, you turn to the second page of the ads in the previous exhibit that we were looking at.
A Okay.
Q The Ad No. 1-5255.
A That's correct.
ran in those various publications during that time period.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Would you agree with that?
A The numbers correspond, yes.
Q Okay. And that — do you know who — do you know William Esty and Company?
A Based on what I see here, it appears to be an advertising company, based —
MR. CHUMBLEY: He asked if you know. If you don't know, you don't know. I don't want you to speculate.
THE WITNESS: The only thing I know is what I have in front of me.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Have you ever heard of the Legacy Library? If you look down at the foot of that letter, it says "Legacy Library."
A I see that.
Q What's that ?
A I have heard about it, yes. Yeah.
Q Have you ever used the Legacy Library to do original research with respect to Cuban advertising?
A I have not.
MR. HARRIS: Okay. Can I have the court reporter please mark our Tab No. 7, please?
(Exhibit 15 was marked for identification.)
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Doctor -MR. CHUMBLEY: Again — for the record, this has highlighting on these, as well, that was here
—	that was put on by someone other than someone in this room.
MR. HARRIS: Yeah. We put the highlighting on to make life easy for everybody.
MR. CHUMBLEY: All right.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor, if you would look at the first ad. I can't — I don't read Spanish. Can you have translate that for us in the highlighting?
A Within the highlighting, it's incomplete.
MR. CHUMBLEY: It's cut off. On the right-hand side, it's incomplete.
MR. HARRIS: I got it. Read what you can.
THE WITNESS: You're asking me to read it — translate it?
MR. HARRIS: Yes. Translate it for me. The yellow box.
MR. CHUMBLEY: The part within the yellow
highlighting. Do the best you can.
THE WITNESS: "Not one single case" — there's a letter D — "of irritation of" — and then it says "Garga," G-A-R-G-A — that's the part that is visible — "that could be attributed to" — and what's visible is "F-U" — and then the last line "Camel." And it has an exclamation mark.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q So would you disagree if I told you that it says, Not one case of irritation that can be attributed
—	irritation of the throat, Garganza, that can be attributable to smoking Camel? Does that make sense?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: That makes sense. Not all of that is included here.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q I understand. Given what's included, if you fill in the blanks — pretend — what's that game show called?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Wheel of Fortune?
MR. HARRIS: The Wheel of Fortune. Fill in the blanks.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Let's go to the next one. You'll see, as well, that this has "Roberts Tobacco Distributors,
Havana, Cuba," right, at the bottom?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Not on the second page it doesn't say that.
MR. HARRIS: On the first page.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Keep some sort of order here.
THE WITNESS: The question was?
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q You'll acknowledge that "Roberts Tobacco Company, Havana, Cuba" is listed at the bottom, right?
A Yes.
Q Okay. If you'll turn to the next blue tab.
MR. CHUMBLEY: The next blue tab, not the next ad, right? The next blue tab.
MR. HARRIS: Next blue tab, right.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Okay. I'm hoping this is your next tab as it is ours. Okay. He's got it in front of him.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor, what's the yellow highlighting sentence or clause say there in the bottom half of the page?
A Okay. It is a segment of a sentence, and it says, "Camel es mas suave." "Camel is softer."
Q Okay. And do you know why Camels were advertised as smooth or soft?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form. Don't guess. If you know, answer. If you don't, tell him you don't.
THE WITNESS: I don't know that for a fact. (Conference call was dropped. A break was taken to reestablish conference call.)
MR. CHUMBLEY: Okay. J.B., welcome back.
J.B. ?
MR. HARRIS: Yeah, I'm here.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Okay. We're all here.
MR. HARRIS: Our phones — can you hear me? MR. CHUMBLEY: Yeah.
MR. HARRIS: Our phone system went dead. I'm using my cell phone to continue.
MR. CHUMBLEY: We're here, ready to go. We took that opportunity to take a bathroom break.
MR. HARRIS: That's fine.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor?
A Yes.
MR. HARRIS: Are we back on the record?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Yes.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor, are you aware that Roberts Tobacco Company was merely a distributor of American cigarettes
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form. I think that's been asked and answered. I'll object to the form too.
THE WITNESS: I understand that, besides distributing cigarettes, it was also a publishing company.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Is it your opinion that they're a publishing company? They published ads on behalf of American cigarette companies?
A No. When I meant "publishing," I meant postcards and other printed materials.
Q So they're not an advertising agency?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form. If you know, Doctor.
THE WITNESS: Based on what I know, I don't see them as an advertising agency.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Okay. Doctor, if you could turn to the next blue tab, please.
A I have it in front of me.
Q Okay. Again, can you translate for me the portion in the highlighted — circled in yellow highlighting?
A Sure. "I did the test of the softness of my cigarette. My preference is Camel."
Q Okay. Do you know what the "smooth cigarette test" is?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. I didn't hear that. BY MR. HARRIS:
Q It says, "I did the test for the smoothness of Camel." And my question is, do you know what the smooth cigarette test is?
A No.
Q Okay. Doctor, by the way, let me ask you a question. Are you an expert in Cuban cigarette advertising — American cigarette advertising in Cuba?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I'm an expert on Cuba, but I'm not an expert in advertising.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q And that would include American cigarette advertising in Cuba, pre-embargo?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: As far as me not being an expert in advertising, it would include that.
MR. CHUMBLEY: He also — he told you what he did in terms of comparing the frequency of American
cigarette ads in Cuba with those of Cuban cigarette companies. He's told you he's done research regarding ads. I don't know what your question is. BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. He's answered my question. But do you have any published studies on your research on comparing American ads to Cuban ads —
A No.
Q — and cigarettes?
A No.
Q Okay. All right. Okay. This stack of ads, were these marked previously? I'm lost now because of the break-up of the phone call.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Yes. These were marked as Composite 15.
MR. HARRIS: All right.
MR. CHUMBLEY: At least the ones we've been talking about the last couple minutes are part of Composite 15.
MR. HARRIS: Okay.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor, do you know anything about — let's do this. If you can turn to our Tab No. 8.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Hold on.
MR. ALVAREZ: J.B., do you want that one
Tab 8 .
(Exhibit 16 was marked for identification.)
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor, can you just look at the first page and identify the document for me?
MR. CHUMBLEY: If you can.
You might want to ask him if he's ever seen it before. I don't know how you can identify a document if he's never seen it before.
MR. HARRIS: By reading the title into the record.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Again, he's got — he's got Exhibit 16. He's looked at the first page. What do you want him to do again, J.B.?
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q First of all, Doctor, have you seen this page or any other pages that follow? There are nine pages, total. Have you seen these before?
A I am not 100 percent sure that I have.
Q Did you see them during your deposition in the Suarez case, if you recall?
A I was shown some documents. I don't recall whether these were the ones.
Q Okay. Would you agree that they appear to be scripts for radio ads in Cuba —
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
MR. HARRIS: — for cigarettes?
THE WITNESS: There is the word "locutora," which means "announcer." Then there's a text. And "Cuba" appears mentioned, along with "Panama."
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Do you have — do you know that station in Cuba? CMQ? Are you familiar with that radio station in Cuba?
A Yes.
Q Okay. And where was — where was that station located? Was that a national station or a local station?
A It was in Havana.
Q How about —
MR. CHUMBLEY: He's not finished with his answer.
MR. HARRIS: That's fine. Go ahead.
THE WITNESS: It was based in Havana. I'm not sure whether it had relay stations for the rest of the island.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Have you heard of this station, CMBS, in Cuba?
A No.
Q Okay. Does this appear to be a radio announcement regarding Camel cigarettes?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form. Asked and answered.
THE WITNESS: There's mention of radio stations. There's mention of the announcer. And Camels are mentioned.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Do you know what the substance of the ad says
—	or the announcement, rather?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I haven't read it yet. If I
may.
MR. HARRIS: Yeah. Go ahead.
THE WITNESS: I finished reading it.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. What does the substance of the announcement say?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
MR. HARRIS: Summarize it.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: There's an allusion to a jury, which I'm not sure what that means, and the state —
Q Doctor, let me ask —
MR. CHUMBLEY: He's trying to answer your question.
MR. HARRIS: Go ahead, Doctor.
THE WITNESS: And the statement attached to — attributed to that jury is the smokers of — the smokers of cigarettes — and then there is the word "el fallo," which means, sort of, the Court determination — I don't take that literally — "more people smoke Camels than any other cigarette."
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. All right. Anything else I should know about that ad?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form. How is he supposed to know what you ought to know?
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor, let me ask, are you a native Spanish speaker?
A That's my first language, yes.
Q Okay. Because you seem to be having difficulty reading your own language. I'm just curious.
MR. HARRIS: Let’s turn to our Tab No. 9. If you would mark that, please.
THE WITNESS: I believe I read this accurately. I'm sorry.
MR. CHUMBLEY: You want your Tab 9 marked as the next exhibit?
MR. HARRIS: Yes, please.
(Exhibit 17 was marked for identification.)
MR. CHUMBLEY: I'm sure he's go to ask you a question. Maybe he's not.
MR. HARRIS: Take a look at it. I'm going to ask you a question on the second page, the highlighted portion.
THE WITNESS: I'm on the second page.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. It says here, Broadcast from Hollywood by shortwave radio to the Americas, North and South, about Camels.
Now, "north" and "south" would include Cuba, would you agree with me?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Cuba would be part of the Americas, yes.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q So if R.J. Reynolds was advertising in the
Americas, they would be advertising in Cuba, is that right ?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: If they are advertising in all of the Americas, then the conclusion would be that Cuba would be among — is among the countries of the Americas.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. That would also — — would Cuba also be considered part of Latin America?
A Cuba is part of Latin America.
Q If you would turn to — let's skip over —
MR. HARRIS: Let's have her mark our Tab 10, please, as the next exhibit.
(Exhibit 18 was marked for identification.)
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. The first page of that document there, Doctor, it says, in highlighting, "Presented to North America, Hawaii, the Philippines in shortwave, in Spanish to Latin America, by Camels, the cigarette of costlier tobaccos." As you stated, Latin America includes Cuba, right?
A Latin America includes Cuba.
MR. HARRIS: Let's turn to Tab 11. Have her mark that.
(Exhibit 19 was marked for identification.)
Q Doctor, if you would turn to the second and third pages, in the highlighted portion of this — of this document.
A Yes.
Q You'll see -- the title page says, "Advertising costs for 1950." And Cuban spots were $6,000, I guess — $6,847 — is that right, according to this highlighted portion, on radio stations?
A That's what the highlighted portion reflects,
yes .
Q And on the newspapers, $2,581.65 on the other page. Is that right?
A Let's see. 2,581.65.
Q Right. Okay. Okay. Let's skip to Tab No. 14.
MR. CHUMBLEY: 14. We're skipping a few?
MR. HARRIS: Yeah.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Hold on.
(Exhibit 20 was marked for identification.)
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Doctor, we're now in the year 1955 advertising costs. This is, again, the William Esty Company. And you'll see, in highlighting,
advertisements for Camel.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Where do you see — wait a second. Where does it say William Esty? I want to make sure we're talking about the same document.
MR. HARRIS: That was my mistake. It's not William Esty.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Looking at the cost of advertising Camels in
1955	in Cuba, it says $5,634.52. Is that correct, Doctor?
A That's what — yes. That's the right amount, according to this.
Q Okay. And on the next page, for Winstons, in 1955, advertising in Cuba was $4,215 and, apparently,
80 cents, I believe.
MR. CHUMBLEY: I don't see any reference to Winston.
MR. HARRIS: Look at the top.
MR. CHUMBLEY: I'm sorry. I see.
THE WITNESS: That's the correct amount, as far as I can read.
MR. CHUMBLEY: At least that's — that's the correct number, according to this document, right?
THE WITNESS: Yes.
MR. HARRIS: If you will turn to the next tab,
15,	and mark that, please.
(Exhibit 21 was marked for identification.)
THE WITNESS: I have it.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Doctor, you'll see it shows the cost of advertising in Cuba for Camels and Winstons on their respective pages. This appears to be quite a significant jump in advertising. Do you know why there would have been this jump in advertising for Camels and Winstons in Cuba in 1956 as compared to 1955?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I don't know why that would be the case.
MR. HARRIS: Okay. Okay. Let's turn to Tab
16.	Mark that, please.
(Exhibit 22 was marked for identification.)
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor, let me ask you to take a look at the title page, and ask you if you've ever seen this document before?
MR. CHUMBLEY: It's not a complete document.
MR. HARRIS: Right. I know.
MR. CHUMBLEY: All right. So, I mean, he's never seen it in this form before, that's for sure. I'm sure if he's seen it, he's seen the entire
document, as opposed to pages you picked and chose. THE WITNESS: I saw the entire document.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q You have — you have seen the entire document? A Yes, I have.
Q Okay. And when did you see it? In preparation for today's deposition?
A I saw it —
MR. CHUMBLEY: I think it was attached to Suchlicki's deposition. Wasn't it? Maybe not.
I'll let him answer. Sorry.
THE WITNESS: It has to have been within the last 10 days.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Do you see that portion highlighted on what's marked — what says "Page 15" at the bottom?
A Yes.
Q All right. If you would read — you don't have to read it into the record. Just read it to yourself and tell me if you disagree with the statement
—	the two sentences there.
A Okay. I'm done reading.
MR. CHUMBLEY: The question again was?
BY MR. HARRIS:
—	that — those two sentences and the statistics mentioned in there?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Well, my first comment would be that, for the first sentence, I don't see a date. And I was trying to see if there was any footnote or endnote, and there seems to be none. So I can't really comment not knowing the date.
As far as the second sentence, I don't have any way of saying whether this is true or not. If there had been notes, that would have helped, but there are no notes or citations.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Have you done any research on the issues that are addressed in this particular summary? For example, the age — the average age when people start smoking in Cuba, the percentage of the population that smokes or smoked over any period of time, the per capita consumption of cigarette smokers in Cuba? Have you done any research on those issues?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: As part of my research, I have come up — I have seen some information about where Cuba ranks as far as the consumption of cigarettes. That I've seen.
I don't recall having seen anything pertaining to the age at which people start smoking in Cuba. Again, as I said earlier, this first sentence does not have a date that I can attribute to it.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. It says here that in 1986 Cuba had the third largest consumption, per capita, of cigarettes in the world. Do you know whether or not that statistic still holds true to this day?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I have a recollection that the number — the statistic — the consumption has fallen — or, actually, that the consumption fell. Other than that, I don't have those numbers with me or in my mind.
MR. HARRIS: Okay. Let's take a look at the next tab. If the court reporter would mark our 17 as the next exhibit.
(Exhibit 23 was marked for identification.)
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. Doctor, can you take a look at this and tell me if you've seen this document before?
A Yes, I have seen this before.
Q And what is it?
A This is a transcript of a Cuban magazine from
1958 that appears on a web page which is Cuban Information Archives.
Q All right. On the second page, it states, in highlighting, "The consumption of American cigarettes has risen markedly in recent years. This consumption has risen from 2.2 million packages in 1939 to three million in '40; 6.2 million in '45; 13.9 million in 1960; 16.8 million in 1966.
Is there any reason you would have to dispute those figures?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I have no reason to agree with or dispute those numbers.
MR. HARRIS: Okay. If you would — if the court reporter would mark our 18, please, as the next exhibit.
(Exhibit 24 was marked for identification.)
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor, just if you would look at the document and tell me — or the tile page, I guess — and tell me if you've ever seen this document before.
A I don't recall having seen this one before.
Q Okay. Have you ever heard of the name Jorge Posse?
A Jorge Posse, from what I gather, used to work in Cuba for a government organization in charge of promoting Cuban tobacco products.
Q What type of organization — is that, like, a lobby group, or advertising?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: My understanding is that it was part of the government.
MR. HARRIS: Okay. If you would mark our Number 19 as the next exhibit, please.
(Exhibit 25 was marked for identification.)
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor, can you look at this and tell me if you've ever seen this document before?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Kind of a bad copy. He's doing the best he can.
MR. HARRIS: You don't have to read the entire document. Just look at the title, the author.
THE WITNESS: I'm not sure.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. It happens to be written by the same Jorge Posse, right?
A That is the case.
Q And what does the title say?
A "Air pollution, and not the smoking habit, possible cause of lung cancer."
MR. HARRIS: Okay. And then, finally, if you would turn — mark Number 20, which was —
MR. CHUMBLEY: That's already been marked.
MR. HARRIS: What's that?
MR. CHUMBLEY: We marked that earlier when we marked — because that matched what he brought with him. So I used your Exhibit 20. That's been marked already.
MR. HARRIS: Well, if you can find it now, go ahead.
MR. CHUMBLEY: We can find it real quick.
Stand by. For your edification, it's marked as Exhibit 11.
It matched, page for page — what he brought with him matched, page for page, with what you sent us. So we marked the one you sent us.
MR. HARRIS: That's fine.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q So, Doctor, you sent us these, I guess, yesterday or two days ago — or the lawyers did. Let's take a look at these. Are these cigarette — Cuban cigarette brands?
A Yes.
Q Okay. And Populares is one brand, I assume. Aroma another?
A Yes.
Q Do you know when these were sold?
A Specifically, no. They are post-revolution.
Q Post-revolution. Are there any warning labels on these cigarette —
A Yes.
Q — packages?
A Yes.
Q Where are they? Where are they?
A They're in the front of the packages themselves.
Q What does the warning say?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form. Asked and
answered.
A "Fumar Dana su Salud."
Q What does that mean?
A "Smoking harms your health."
Q Okay. And you don't know what decade — you said they're post-revolution, but you don't know what decade, right?
A I don't know that for a fact. I can situate them, probably, the '70s, maybe early '80s.
Q And, finally, on the last page, you have
consumption of cigarettes in Cuba in 1956.
MR. CHUMBLEY: He doesn't have it. Turn to the last page of the exhibit. He's on the last page. What's the question?
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q I'm asking him if that's one of his reliance documents.
A Yes.
Q Okay. And your — what is it you're trying to convey here by producing this?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: If you'll give me a chance to read it.
MR. HARRIS: Sure. Take your time.
THE WITNESS: It includes information from
1956	on the types of cigarettes that were consumed in Cuba. And there's also mention of the prices.
And the — the source is the organization that I was referring to earlier. And this is the full title. "Comsion Nacional de Propiedad y Defensa del Tabaco, Havana," which is "National Commission of Property and Defense of Tobacco."
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q What is that — what is that exactly? Is that a government agency? Commission of National Property
and Defense of Tobacco?
A That is my understanding.
Q And that's the source for these statistics?
A That's one of the sources.
Q Okay. Do you know which brands of cigarettes Agustin Gonzalez smoked?
A Based on the depositions, which is the only thing that I have in order to get to that information, he's smoked a variety of cigarettes. He smoked Cuban cigarettes, and he also, according to the depositions, smoked American cigarettes.
MR. HARRIS: Okay. Doctor, we're going to take a quick five-minute break. I'm about ready to wrap up here.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Let us know when you want to continue.
(A break was taken.)
MR. HARRIS: I'm back.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Okay. We're here.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Doctor, other than the opinions you've given here today, is there any other opinion that you are prepared to give in this case relating to your area of expertise —
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
MR. HARRIS: — that we haven't covered already?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Still object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I have discussed my general opinions. However, I may be asked to opine on other topics that are related.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q But as we sit here today, you covered every topic that's related in which you're prepared to offer an opinion, is that correct?
MR. CHUMBLEY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I feel comfortable that that's the case, but I would not want to rule out that I may be asked to offer other opinions.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. If you do offer other opinions, you'll be prepared to give another deposition as a follow-up, is that correct?
MR. CHUMBLEY: That's going to be, probably, an issue for the Court to take up. But if the Court says he needs to appear for another one, he will.
BY MR. HARRIS:
Q Okay. What about — Doctor, have you ever heard of the Bonsack machine?
A Bonsack?
Q Right.
A Probably. But I’m not sure what it is.
MR. HARRIS: Okay. All right, Doctor. Thanks for your time. I appreciate it. You guys have a safe trip back.
MR. CHUMBLEY: He does not waive. He wants to
read.
MR. HARRIS: That’s fine. Are you asking questions ?
MR. CHUMBLEY: I'm not.
MR. ALVAREZ: No questions.
MR. CHUMBLEY: No questions.
MR. HARRIS: All right. Signing off.
MR. CHUMBLEY: He’s going to read and sign.
MR. HARRIS: Okay. Very good.
MR. CHUMBLEY: See you.
MR. HARRIS: I’ll order. Ma’am, I’ll order a copy, please.
MR. CHUMBLEY: Thanks, J.B.
