8	(DR. THOMAS DIBACCO)
9	having been first duly sworn or affirmed, was examined
10	and testified as follows:
11	THE WITNESS: I do.
12	DIRECT EXAMINATION
13	BY MR. LATINBERG:
14	Q. Good morning, Mr. DiBacco.
15	A. Good morning, sir.
16	Q. What unique education, experience or training
17	do you have that qualifies you to provide expert
18	opinions in this case?
19	A. I am a professional historian having received
20	my Ph.D. in American history from the American
21	University in 1965. And with that background in
22	American history I developed courses at American
23	University in the field of American social history.
24	In fact, I was one of the first professors in
25	the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area to concentrate on
0005
1	American social history as a field of specialization.
2	And that specialization, social history is the history
3	of everyday life, what Americans did in their everyday
4	life from earliest times to the present. And as part of
5	that everyday life, the issue of cigarettes, in
6	particular tobacco in general was a focus of research
7	and how Americans over the years utilized cigarettes and
8	tobacco products.
9	I also use that expertise with respect to
10	continuing my research for articles and books in the
11	history of everyday life, or at least focused in part on
12	that.
13	Q. All right. Anything else other than as a
14	professor, Ph.D. and having established those courses?
15	A. And writings. I've written a major textbook
16	in the history of the United States, a large portion of
17	which deals with everyday life.
18	Q. Have you written any textbooks on tobacco?
19	A. No, sir.
20	Q. What do you understand your role to be in this
21	case?
22	A. My role in this case was to examine the extent
23	to which information relating to the health risks of
24	cigarettes, in particular as those risks relate to
25	disease, death, habituation, addiction, and the
0006
1	difficulty of quitting, the extent of which that
2	information was disseminated and publicly available to
3	individuals such as the decedent in communities where
4	she lived throughout her life.
5	Q. Any other role?
6	A. No.
7	Q. Now, in connection with -- well, let me ask
8	you, as a history professor, when you teach your
9	students, are you instilling in them any particular
10	skill that you have developed in those students?
11	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
12	THE WITNESS: I don't understand.
13	BY MR. LATINBERG:
14	Q. Well, obviously if a person took a class from
15	an accounting professor they would learn the skill of
16	accounting, and by taking a class from a history
17	professor are they learning a particular skill or are
18	they simply learning facts and information?
19	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
20	THE WITNESS: I don't see any difference
21	between the two. Accounting professors teach
22	accounting. History professors teach history.
23	How they use that history is often for purposes
24	of enlightenment. Sometimes they go on to
25	pursue advanced degrees in that field in terms
0007
1	of history.
2	BY MR. LATINBERG:
3	Q. Is there any particular skill that you bring
4	to this case, apart from your having studied various
5	articles, with respect to the opinions that you're going
6	to render?
7	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
8	THE WITNESS: Yes, I have the skills of
9	having done research for the last 15 years for
10	cases from the Engle case beginning in 1999
11	until most recently, this case.
12	MR. FEIWUS: I just note for the record
13	that he was qualified as an expert and
14	testified at the Engle trial. Since this is an
15	Engle Progeny case, I hope that we will cut
16	through the basics and get to the meat.
17	BY MR. LATINBERG:
18	Q. So, Doctor, you were an expert in the Engle
19	Progeny case?
20	A. I was an expert in the Engle case, yes, sir.
21	Q. Have you been -- have you received or reviewed
22	the final judgment entered in that case?
23	A. I have not.
24	Q. Have you been provided a copy of the Supreme
25	Court opinion following the appeals of that final
0008
1	judgment?
2	A. Only as I have read about that in the press.
3	Q. Have you been told anything about the impact
4	of the Engle judgment on these Engle Progeny cases?
5	A. No. Nothing except what I've read in the
6	press.
7	Q. And any of the things that you read in the
8	press, are they included in the disk of reliance
9	materials?
10	A. No, because they did not relate to this
11	particular case, but cases in general, no.
12	Q. Now, the documents that you provided in
13	connection with the reliance materials, are those all of
14	the articles and other information that you rely upon
15	for your general opinions as well as your specific
16	opinions?
17	A. No. They are not all of them. I've been
18	doing this since 1965 and there is a body of knowledge
19	that I've accumulated over that period which is not
20	susceptible to putting down into literate form.
21	Q. Other than the body of knowledge that you have
22	the intangible, if you will, that you just know, does
23	the disk contain all of the tangible materials that you
24	have relied upon?
25	A. Again, they contain as much as I've used in
0009
1	the past for similar cases and to give an analysis of
2	the work that I've done in this area.
3	MR. FEIWUS: Just to clarify, because our
4	office sent you the disk I believe either
5	yesterday or two days ago as with reliance list
6	as well, Dr. DiBacco has a lot of materials and
7	there are a lot of materials on his reliance
8	list and we've endeavored to give you on the CD
9	hard copies of -- copies, electronic copies of
10	all the hard copy documents that we have.
11	Now, we have about 13 boxes of those materials
12	so if there's anything on the reliance list that
13	for whatever reason you don't have on the CD, you
14	know, we haven't brought 13 boxes with us today
15	but, you know, please do let us know and we will
16	endeavor to get you a copy if for whatever reason
17	it's not on there. My office prepared the CD based
18	on his hard copy materials, not him.
19	In addition to that, there are video -- there
20	are videotapes and other -- there are other
21	electronic media that are contained in his
22	materials that we did not reduce to the CD, but we
23	have them and they are listed on his reliance list.
24	So if there are any of those in particular that you
25	would need --
0010
1	MR. LATINBERG: Do you have a copy of the
2	reliance list, because I don't recall having
3	seen the reliance list. The only thing we got
4	was the disk.
5	MR. FEIWUS: Well, we did send you a
6	reliance list. I don't think I have one with
7	me.
8	No, I didn't bring one with me but I'm fairly
9	certain we sent it to you. It's a long list, about
10	48 pages.
11	MR. LATINBERG: I acknowledge receiving
12	the disk.
13	MR. FEIWUS: Tom, are you sure that you
14	don't have that?
15	THE WITNESS: No. I know you said you
16	sent it.
17	MR. FEIWUS: I'll check with my office.
18	MR. LATINBERG: Maybe we can take a break
19	and they can fax it over.
20	And just for clarification, counselor, the CD
21	that you indicated was created by the law firm, was
22	it a CD of the paper materials within the 13 boxes?
23	MR. FEIWUS: Yes. That's what we endeavor
24	to do.
25	MR. LATINBERG: Okay. So apart from the
0011
1	videos, the disk contains that which is in the
2	13 boxes?
3	MR. FEIWUS: Yes. We endeavored to do
4	that. And so if there's anything that's on the
5	reliance list that for whatever reason isn't on
6	the disk, you just let us know.
7	MR. LATINBERG: You think it would be an
8	inadvertent omission?
9	MR. FEIWUS: Yes. I think so. The
10	electronic materials I don't believe are on
11	there.
12	BY MR. LATINBERG:
13	Q. All right. Now, Doctor, I did have an
14	opportunity to take a look at the CD and from what I
15	could gather there were 1596 items. Does that sound
16	about right?
17	A. Well, I didn't make a count.
18	Q. And that included some items that are, and,
19	again, I guess you didn't create them but they are named
20	exhibit things like 4825, 4826. Do you have a list that
21	corresponds to those exhibit numbers?
22	MR. FEIWUS: I think that would be the
23	reliance list.
24	THE WITNESS: That's the reliance list.
25	BY MR. LATINBERG:
0012
1	Q. All right. And in looking at those documents
2	it appeared that they consisted entirely of news
3	articles, is that accurate?
4	A. Newspaper articles, magazine articles. They
5	were the predominant ones but there were also public
6	service announcements, clips on television news
7	stations, movies, to the best of my recollection.
8	MR. FEIWUS: And, again, I think the
9	reliance list will be more clear about what's
10	on there.
11	BY MR. LATINBERG:
12	Q. Let me ask you this. Included in the 13 boxes
13	or for that matter the body of knowledge that you carry
14	around, are you including in your opinions any
15	advertisements that were put out by the tobacco
16	industry?
17	A. Yes. In the body of knowledge, absolutely.
18	Q. Do you have any of those advertisements within
19	the 13 boxes?
20	A. There may be. I don't know if there are, but
21	the advertisements are part of the body of knowledge.
22	Q. But as you sit here today you can't recall --
23	identify a specific ad?
24	A. No, I can't. Not at this point.
25	Q. And would it have been difficult to have
0013
1	identified and copied and marked advertisements?
2	A. No, because I'm dealing with information
3	relating to the health risk of smoking, and
4	advertisements by tobacco companies do not relate to the
5	health risk of smoking.
6	Q. What's your basis for the statement that
7	advertisements don't relate to the health risk of
8	tobacco?
9	A. Advertisements by tobacco cigarette companies
10	are designed to sell products, and they do not provide
11	information, credible information with respect to the
12	health risks of smoking. There are third-party sources
13	that provide that such as the Surgeon General's reports,
14	American Cancer Society reports, et cetera.
15	Q. You said the statement that they don't provide
16	credible information on health risks of smoking. What's
17	your basis for that statement?
18	A. Well, until they were required to put the
19	Surgeon General's warnings on them which wasn't until
20	1980 -- 1972, many of these products, particularly in
21	the early years, made claims which the Federal Trade
22	Commission ultimately required the companies to
23	eliminate, claims that -- such as not a cough in a car
24	load.
25	Q. Whose advertisement was that?
0014
1	A. It may have been Old Gold's, but I'm not an
2	expert on the slogans.
3	Q. But you made a statement that they are not
4	credible, and I'm trying to understand the basis for
5	your -- you're providing an expert opinion that they are
6	not credible?
7	A. I'm providing an expert opinion that they are
8	not credible.
9	Q. And on what basis do you make the statement
10	that they are not credible?
11	A. Common sense. Manufacturers cannot be relied
12	upon solely as the basis for credibility for their
13	products, whether they make hamburgers or cigarettes.
14	Q. Do you have an opinion as to whether or not a
15	consumer has a reasonable basis to rely on the voracity
16	of the statements made by a manufacturer such as a
17	tobacco company?
18	MR. FEIWUS: Objection. He testified that
19	the FDC determined that cigarette companies
20	could not make such claims.
21	MR. LATINBERG: If you could confine your
22	objections to form, that would be appreciated.
23	THE WITNESS: In 1955 the Federal Trade
24	Commission eliminated those claims.
25	MR. LATINBERG: Would you read back my
0015
1	question, please?
2	(The last question was read.)
3	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
4	THE WITNESS: No. I don't have an
5	opinion. And I've confined myself, sir, to the
6	brands that the decedent, Mrs. Blitch smoked
7	that were brands by Liggett and those ads were
8	very narrow according to her 1996 listings of
9	the cigarettes that she smoked. And the bulk
10	of her smoking of Liggett brand Eves was in the
11	period when there were warnings on them.
12	BY MR. LATINBERG:
13	Q. Do you have an opinion on whether or not Betty
14	Blithe had a reasonable basis to rely on the voracity of
15	the statements by Liggett?
16	MR. FEIWUS: Objection. Lacks foundation.
17	You haven't identified any statements by
18	Liggett.
19	THE WITNESS: She smoked a Liggett brand
20	and I think Chesterfield for one year in
21	1945/'46. And I don't recall of any statements
22	by Liggett at that time so I don't have an
23	opinion. When she smoked Eve cigarettes in the
24	'80's, there were warnings on them.
25	BY MR. LATINBERG:
0016
1	Q. Do you recall what the statements those
2	warnings were?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. Now, I thought you had identified your role
5	earlier as providing opinions of the extent to which
6	information related to the health risks of cigarettes
7	including disease, death, habituation, addiction and the
8	difficulty of quitting. Did I get that right? That's
9	one of your rolls in this case.
10	A. That's right.
11	Q. And then you have obviously provided expert
12	testimony in this area both generally as to other
13	smokers and the time periods and the products that they
14	smoked, correct?
15	A. Generally and specifically. Sometimes they
16	were multi-plaintiffs as in the Engle case.
17	Q. And apart from reading the deposition
18	transcripts of various fact witnesses in this case, have
19	you read any other transcripts?
20	A. Transcripts of depositions?
21	Q. Yes.
22	A. No.
23	Q. Have you ever read any deposition transcripts
24	of any tobacco employees in connection with any of the
25	opinions that you render in these cases?
0017
1	A. No.
2	Q. Have you read the deposition testimony of
3	Bennett Lebow?
4	A. No.
5	Q. Do you know who Bennett Lebow is?
6	A. He's an executive with Liggett.
7	Q. Have you ever requested to read any of the
8	deposition testimony of tobacco employees, executives or
9	representatives?
10	A. No. I'm dealing with publicly available
11	information during the period of the decedent's smoking
12	history lifetime.
13	Q. And do you understand the smoking history of
14	Betty Blitch to span 50 years?
15	A. I'm not certain. She did smoke. She was bom
16	in 1924. She died in 1998. There was no specific
17	reference as to when she started. So I don't know how
18	long that period was.
19	Q. But you acknowledge that she smoked at least
20	in 1946?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And she certainly was smoking in the '80's and
23	the '90s?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. And you have no information to suggest that
0018
1	she wasn't smoking in between?
2	A. No.
3	Q. Now, I'm trying to understand -- well, let me
4	ask you this. As a history professor, isn't it
5	important as a part of studying history to understand
6	all of the facts that relate to a particular event, both
7	those publicly disseminated as well as those perhaps
8	discovered later as internal documents?
9	A. No.
10	Q. Why not?
11	A. Because my focus is not what was internally
12	covered. It's what was publicly available to the public
13	and the extent at which it's available. If something is
14	internal and not disclosed to the public it's not
15	relevant in the particular focus that I have as an
16	expert in this case.
17	Q. But as a scholar and as someone who has worked
18	on these cases for a while, don't you think that it's
19	relevant to the inquiry as to whether or not there's a
20	disconnect between the information that's being publicly
21	disseminated and the information that's known
22	internally?
23	A. No, because if individuals are dealing with
24	publicly available information, then the focus should
25	remain on publicly available information. And that's
0019
1	been the focus that I've utilized throughout these
2	cases.
3	Q. In your evaluation of the publicly available
4	information, would the brands of the cigarettes matter?
5	MR. FEIWUS: Object to the form.
6	THE WITNESS: I do not deal with specific
7	brands relative to what information is publicly
8	available because the information regarding
9	health risks is not brand related except for
10	the fact that during a period of time the
11	Federal Trade Commission did permit smoking
12	machines to evaluate nicotine and tar -- or
13	tar, excuse me. But that is not a focus of my
14	investigation.
15	BY MR. LATINBERG:
16	Q. Now, within the quantum of publicly available
17	information, I didn't notice that you had any Surgeon
18	General reports in your reliance materials; is that
19	correct?
20	A. No. I used the summaries from the Surgeon
21	General's reports that were published in newspapers.
22	Most people do not read Surgeon General's reports or
23	have them available to them, but the summaries on the
24	newspapers are there.
25	Q. I also did not see any transcripts of any
0020
1	federal hearing on issues involving tobacco and health;
2	is that correct?
3	A. Only as they related to being summarized in
4	newspaper articles or magazine articles or television
5	clips.
6	Q. I also didn't notice any scholarly books on
7	the issues of tobacco or health; is that accurate?
8	A. Be specific.
9	Q. Well, are you familiar with the work of Allan
10	Brandt?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. You read The Cigarette Century?
13	A. No. I looked through it.
14	Q. Do you own a copy of The Cigarette Century?
15	A. No. I own Richard Kluger's book, Ashes to
16	Ashes.
17	Q. Ashes to Ashes?
18	A. Uh-huh.
19	Q. Have you read that?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. Have you considered any of the information
22	that you read in the Ashes to Ashes book in your
23	opinions?
24	MR. FEIWUS: Objection to form.
25	THE WITNESS: I've considered it.
0021
1	BY MR. LATINBERG:
2	Q. And is there a reason you haven't read the
3	Cigarette Century by Allan Brandt?
4	A. No. I've looked through it.
5	Q. When did you look through it?
6	A. A few months ago.
7	Q. Did you look through the sections that
8	describe constructing controversy?
9	A. I don't recall that.
10	Q. And do you understand what I mean when I talk
11	about the controversy as it relates in this area of
12	public knowledge?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. What do you understand that --
15	A. My understanding is that there is a
16	controversy that is illustrated in certain periods of
17	time in which the Surgeon General's statements and those
18	of other health authorities is being modified by tobacco
19	companies.
20	Q. How did you come to understand that that's the
21	controversy?
22	A. It's in the newspapers. It's in the public
23	available information. Usually when there is a report
24	of a Surgeon General, the American Cancer Society, some
25	health organization, particularly in the 1950s and
0022
1	'60's, there are statements of various organizations
2	representing the cigarette companies that take issue to
3	some degree.
4	Q. And those organizations that take issue, what
5	are the names of those organizations?
6	A. The Tobacco Institute. The Committee for
7	Tobacco Research. Council for Tobacco Research.
8	Tobacco Industry Research Committee. These are the
9	major ones.
10	Q. You mentioned the three main, I guess lobbying
11	arms the tobacco arms, the Tobacco Institute, TI?
12	A. That's a lobbying group. That's a trade
13	group.
14	Q. Council for Tobacco Research, CTR.
15	A. That is a research group.
16	Q. And TIRC, Tobacco Industry Research Committee.
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. How would you describe that?
19	A. Well, I think it's another -- the first name
20	of the four-word name was the initial one and that was
21	changed to the Council for Tobacco Research. CTR.
22	Q. Now, do you know publicly how the Tobacco
23	Institute, the Council for Tobacco Research and TIRC
24	described themselves in terms of whether they were
25	independent or dependent with the tobacco companies?
0023
1	A. Only as it was related in the press releasees
2	and news press release at the time.
3	Q. At the time of the formation of TI, what did
4	TTI described itself as, independent or non-
5	independent?
6	A. I don't know.
7	Q. You don't know?
8	A. I don't know. It's a lobbying group, squarely
9	viewed from an outsider's view as independent. They
10	represented the tobacco company.
11	Q. But you don't know whether or not the Tobacco
12	Institute described itself as independent?
13	A. No, because it was described in the newspapers
14	when they issued a statement as representing the tobacco
15	company. And the newspapers didn't feel -- the writers
16	and the editors who looked over those articles did not
17	feel it important to mention it because it was
18	understood that they represented the tobacco industry.
19	Q. Would it matter to you if the Tobacco
20	Institute described itself as independent of the tobacco
21	industry in its mission?
22	A. No. And the reason is that the Tobacco
23	Institute got very little press throughout the 1950s,
24	'60's, '70's, '80s with respect to its stance.
25	Q. Are you familiar with a company by the name of
0024
1	Hill and Knolton?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Now, in connection with your opinions, have
4	you considered at all any of the public relations work
5	of Hill and Knolton?
6	A. Only as they were found in the press and I
7	found very few.
8	Q. What examples did you find of Hill and
9	Knolton's work in the press?
10	A. I found a couple of examples of their
11	indicating. I remember one story in which they sent out
12	a press release, a couple of newspapers, a few
13	newspapers indicating how in early times tobacco was
14	used as a medicine to deal with certain diseases or
15	mental states.
16	Q. Do you have any knowledge as to the
17	involvement of Hill and Knolton with respect to the
18	activities of TI, CTR or TIRC?
19	A. No. Unless they were revealed in the press
20	and I have no knowledge of that being done.
21	Q. Would it matter to you if internally the
22	documents revealed that Hill and Knolton as a public
23	relations arm of the tobacco industry engaged in a
24	campaign of dis-information to enhance the so-called
25	cigarette controversy?
0025
1	MR. FEIWUS: Objection to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: Only if that information
3	were publicly available and disseminated to
4	individuals. If it were not publicly
5	available, it was not disseminated, it would
6	not matter. The information related to the
7	health risk of smoking was overwhelming.
8	BY MR. LATINBERG:
9	Q. Now, in reaching your conclusions about what
10	was known or understood by the public, have you
11	personally read the Surgeon General's report of 1989?
12	MR. FEIWUS: Objection. I think you
13	misstated his testimony.
14	THE WITNESS: No. I didn't say what was
15	known by the public. I said what information
16	was available to the public.
17	BY MR. LATINBERG:
18	Q. Okay.
19	A. I did not state anything what was known by the
20	public.
21	Q. I appreciate that clarification.
22	As you sit here today, you're not providing an
23	opinion as to what Betty Blitch knew regarding the
24	health risks of smoking?
25	A. I'm not, no.
0026
1	Q. And you're not providing an opinion as to what
2	Betty Blitch knew about the risk of death from smoking?
3	A. No.
4	Q. Or the risk of habituation from smoking?
5	A. No.
6	Q. Or the risk of addition from smoking?
7	A. No.
8	Q. Or the difficulty of quitting?
9	A. No. I don't know what she knew.
10	Q. Chapter four of the 1989 Surgeon General
11	Report is entitled Trends in Public Beliefs, Attitude
12	and Opinions about Smoking. Have you read that chapter?
13	A. May I see it? I'll be happy to read it.
14	Q. Sure.
15	A. Is there a particular section?
16	Q. Just I'm asking you whether or not you have
17	had occasion to read any aspect of Chapter four of the
18	1989 Surgeon General report?
19	A. Let me state this, first of all, that there
20	have been Surgeon General reports issued almost yearly
21	since 1964. Virtually every one of these, including the
22	first one which was issued on January 11, 1964 was
23	voluminous. 387 pages. Extremely technical. What I
24	have done over the years is to look at the summaries of
25	these.
0027
1	Q. But as to Chapter four of the 1989 Surgeon
2	General report, is that a chapter that you have read or
3	familiarized yourself with in any way?
4	A. I would like to know the actual critical area.
5	I can tell you that. I can't read it right now. It's a
6	long chapter. What area are you --
7	Q. I'm not asking you about it yet. I'm asking
8	you whether or not you have read it.
9	A. I would not know unless I read what the
10	information was being disseminated.
11	Q. So as you sit here today, you have no
12	recollection of whether you read it or not?
13	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
14	THE WITNESS: I didn't say that. There
15	are summaries of each of those, and if you can
16	point to an appropriate summary of what this
17	Chapter four is about, I can tell you that.
18	BY MR. LATINBERG:
19	Q. So you have read summaries, you believe, of
20	Chapter four?
21	A. I have read summaries of the Surgeon General's
22	reports.
23	Q. Have you been provided with any of the expert
24	reports of plaintiffs marketing expert in this case?
25	A. No, sir.
0028
1	Q. Do you know who Dr. Marvin Goldberg is?
2	A. I have no idea, no.
3	Q. You haven't seen this report of Dr. Goldberg
4	before?
5	A. No. I have no idea who he is.
6	Q. Now, of the 13 boxes of documents that have
7	been placed on the CD, of all those various articles,
8	have you read them all?
9	A. Yes. At one time or another. I haven't read
10	them all prior to this case. But, yes, I've reviewed
11	them.
12	Q. Have you organized the articles in a way that
13	identifies those that are drawing a relationship between
14	smoking and disease and those that suggest that there is
15	no relationship?
16	A. Every article that was placed in there deals
17	with the health risks and if there was a statement by
18	anyone taking issue with that, it was included as well.
19	Q. I understand. But I'm trying to understand,
20	you said that there's --1 guess you testified that
21	there's overwhelming information about the health risks?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. And there are, you would agree that there are
24	articles that are critical of those that have drawn a
25	relationship between smoking and illness?
0029
1	A. That take issue with it.
2	Q. That take issue with it?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And my question to you is whether or not you
5	have segregated in some way those that take issue with
6	whether or not it's unhealthy and those that state that
7	it is unhealthy?
8	A. I'll answer that in two parts. In the 1950s
9	when major research was being disseminated to the public
10	about the relationship of cigarettes and cancer, there
11	were stories that related specifically to individual,
12	both scientists as well as companies that took issue.
13	Beginning in the 1960s, once the Surgeon
14	General's report was issued in 1964, most of those
15	contrary statements were taking issue with the smoking
16	and health matter or modifying it, were usually included
17	in the substance of the story delineating the health
18	risk just as they would be on television when you would
19	have reference to the smoking and health risk and then
20	reference to the contrary view.
21	Q. What did you understand to be the tobacco
22	industry's view of the contrary view of the relationship
23	between smoking and adverse health affects?
24	A. As reported in the press, I'm not an expert on
25	tobacco industry conduct, but as reported in the press,
0030
1	the tobacco industry was reported as arguing that there
2	was a statistical relationship which researchers had, in
3	fact, established between cigarettes and cancer; that
4	more research needed to be done in order to find
5	scientific causation. And that was the statement of the
6	industry throughout much of this period.
7	Q. Okay. And is it also true that you now
8	understand that in the public press certainly as a
9	byproduct of the Engle case that the tobacco company now
10	agrees that cigarette smoking causes disease?
11	A. The tobacco companies have agreed with the
12	term "medical consensus" that cigarettes are health
13	risks. The word "medical consensus," and from my
14	reading of the newspapers, the issue of scientific
15	causation has yet to be fully explained. But the
16	tobacco industries did, in the period of the Engle case,
17	agree with the medical consensus.
18	Q. What about the position with respect to
19	addiction, is it true that today the public position of
20	the tobacco companies is that nicotine and cigarettes is
21	addictive?
22	A. Again, I'm not an expert in the tobacco
23	industry conduct, but, indeed, executives testified
24	before Congress in 1994 to that effect, that is,
25	executives of cigarette companies.
0031
1	Q. And you're familiar with the, as a historian,
2	with the saying those who cannot remember the past are
3	condemned to repeat it, are you familiar with that
4	sentence?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. Are you familiar with the story about Dr. John
7	Snow and the cholera epidemic of 1849?
8	A. In terms of how he discovered the matter of
9	the source of cholera?
10	Q. That's right.
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. At the Broad Street Pump?
13	A. Uh-huh.
14	Q. He did a statistical analysis of the locations
15	of where the cholera was found and realized that it was
16	close to the Broad Street Pump, correct?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Not too different from the statistical
19	analysis that showed the causation between cigarette
20	smoking and health?
21	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
22	THE WITNESS: Again, I'm not - I'm not
23	here to speak on behalf of the stance the
24	tobacco companies. You asked what the tobacco
25	industries' stance was. I'm giving it to you.
0032
1	That doesn't necessarily imply that that's my
2	stance.
3	MR. FEIWUS: To ask this witness questions
4	about scientific epidemiology is way beyond the
5	scope of his expertise.
6	BY MR. LATINBERG:
7	Q. Are you aware of the public position taken by
8	the tobacco companies with respect to the benefits of
9	filters on cigarettes?
10	A. Back in the 1960s, there were significant
11	pushes by the Surgeon Generals to move in the direction
12	of a safer cigarette. And there was research and the
13	Federal Trade Commission and some scientists, including
14	a gentleman by the name of Robert Strickman attempted to
15	come up with a better filter. This was encouraged by
16	the Public Health Commission or Public Health Service,
17	and they even went so far as to rely upon smoking tests
18	to ascertain the effectiveness of these filters. So
19	that was a push by both industry as well as the
20	government in the 1960s and '70's.
21	Q. My question focuses, you have limited the
22	scope of your opinions in this case to public knowledge.
23	I'm trying to understand what you understood to be the
24	tobacco industry's position publicly with regard to the
25	efficacy and health benefits of filters on cigarettes.
0033
1	A. Those particular industry standards were based
2	upon what the Federal Trade Commission permitted.
3	Federal Trade Commission did permit research in this
4	area. They also permitted the use of the term "light."
5	This was a situation in which both the government and
6	the industry seemed to work together.
7	Q. But my question isn't about how they worked.
8	My question to you is, a proffered expert in the area of
9	public understanding is --
10	MR. FEIWUS: Objection. That's not the
11	scope of his -- that's what he testified to.
12	BY MR. LATINBERG:
13	Q. As an expert in the area in which you're
14	testifying which you said is publicly available
15	information.
16	A. Right.
17	Q. I'm asking you what was publicly disseminated
18	by the tobacco companies with respect to the efficacy or
19	health benefits of filters?
20	A. Those benefits were disseminated along with
21	approval by the Federal Trade Commission of tar ratings
22	of cigarettes. And I'm not an expert in terms of what
23	the tobacco industry itself did. I'm an expert in terms
24	of whether information was available and the newspapers
25	and magazines of the time would provide stories in terms
0034
1	of ratings of cigarettes by tar, the story about the
2	Robert Strickman filter, the attempt to develop and
3	encourage the development of a safer cigarette. These
4	were stances that were published.
5	Q. Part of your answer said that you were talking
6	about information available about the benefits, and I'm
7	trying to understand what benefits were articulated by
8	the tobacco industry with respect to filters?
9	A. Whatever benefits were articulated were those
10	that were approved by the FDC. And those were benefits
11	in terms of lower tar. I might add that throughout this
12	period, the Surgeon General eventually coalesced on the
13	argument and the finding that no filter was safe. And
14	this was also widely publicized.
15	Q. Do you know how long a time period it was
16	between the time that there were benefits being touted
17	about filters and when the public was -- publicly
18	available information was that there was no benefit?
19	A. Well, it depended upon the Surgeon General.
20	There were public health officials in the '60's right
21	after the initial smoking and health report of 1964 who
22	believed that filters were not at all helpful. So there
23	was an argument throughout this period.
24	Q. Are there any articles that you can recall
25	that speak to the fact that there really is no material
0035
1	benefit to the use of a filter?
2	MR. FEIWUS: Objection. Beyond the scope.
3	THE WITNESS: As I said, I am only
4	reiterating what the Surgeon General said and
5	that is that no filter was safe.
6	BY MR. LATINBERG:
7	Q. I'm trying to understand, as you sit here, the
8	basis for your information or your opinion testimony is
9	that there was publicly available information in this
10	regard, and that primarily you're relying on articles
11	and magazines and newspapers. So I'm trying to ask you
12	if you recall, as you sit here today, any specific
13	article, magazine or newspaper that questioned the
14	efficacy of the filters at the time that they were being
15	promoted as beneficial?
16	MR. FEIWUS: Objection to the form.
17	THE WITNESS: Yes. There are statements
18	of public health officials who are arguing
19	that. Yes.
20	BY MR. LATINBERG:
21	Q. I understand that there are statements. I'm
22	asking you whether or not you can point me to any
23	particular article?
24	A. Not as I sit here today.
25	(Plaintiffs Exhibit No. 1 was marked for
0036
1	identification.)
2	BY MR. LATINBERG:
3	Q. Sir, I'll show you what we will mark as a
4	composite exhibit. It's a number of documents produced
5	by the defendant Liggett in this case and some documents
6	used by Dr. Goldberg. As a part of your opinion
7	testimony, have you reviewed or considered any of the
8	marketing efforts or promotional efforts of Liggett at
9	any time?
10	A. These were not publicly disseminated, no.
11	MR. FEIWUS: Do you have a copy of that
12	for me?
13	MR. LATINBERG: I don't. Sorry about
14	that.
15	BY MR. LATINBERG:
16	Q. I want to be clear about this. I asked you
17	about books and you mentioned Ashes to Ashes as a book
18	that you have read. Are there any other books -- well,
19	let me ask you this way. Are there any books that have
20	been written by others on the subject of tobacco,
21	health, marketing, available information that you rely
22	upon in any way for your opinions?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. Can you tell me the titles of those books?
25	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
0037
1	THE WITNESS: Robert Sobel, They Satisfy.
2	S-o-b-e-1. Cassandra, C-a-s-s-a-n-d-r-a Tate,
3	Cigarette Wars. There's a book by E. Douglas
4	Branch, E. Douglas Branch, which is A Social
5	History of the 19th Century. Not all of it.
6	Nelson Blake, B-l-a-k-e, A History of American
7	Life and Thought. Those are ones that come to
8	mind right now.
9	BY MR. LATINBERG:
10	Q. Do you have any opinions on whether or not
11	tobacco intentionally disseminated information that was
12	inconsistent with what it knew internally about the
13	health effects of smoking?
14	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
15	THE WITNESS: Again, I have concentrated
16	my focus on what was publicly available.
17	Whatever was publicly available is what I
18	concentrated on.
19	BY MR. LATINBERG:
20	Q. Again, I understand that you have limited the
21	scope of your opinion. I just want to be clear for the
22	record.
23	So to the extent that since the '50's and
24	'60's when -- and in the '70's and I assume the '80s,
25	when the public position of the tobacco companies were
0038
1	sort of consistent with the health controversy regarding
2	cigarettes, that you have not made any effort to look at
3	any of the now publicly available information with
4	regard to the truthfulness or the voracity of the
5	positions taken in those days?
6	MR. FEIWUS: Objection. Misstates his
7	testimony and it's also compound.
8	THE WITNESS: No. I have dealt only with
9	what was publicly available, and if there have
10	been statements made that were reflective of
11	internal documents, they were disclosed in the
12	1990s which is a period when the health risks
13	of smoking are widely disseminated.
14	BY MR. LATINBERG:
15	Q. And now that you are aware of what has been
16	widely disseminated in the '90's, have you drawn any
17	conclusions about whether or not the tobacco industry
18	manipulated the public into believing that a legitimate
19	dispute exited as to health risks of smoking?
20	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
21	THE WITNESS: I have no opinion on that.
22	That's beyond my expertise.
23	BY MR. LATINBERG:
24	Q. Do you have any opinion as to whether or not,
25	if the public is conflicted with information, some of
0039
1	which is accurate and some of which is not but it
2	doesn't know which is which, that it can make an
3	informed decision regarding the health effects of
4	smoking?
5	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
6	THE WITNESS: Again, my focus was on the
7	information relating to the health risks of
8	smoking that was disseminated. I am not in the
9	expertise of deciding what is known or what is
10	truthful. It's only the information that's
11	being disseminated regarding the health risk of
12	smoking.
13	BY MR. LATINBERG:
14	Q. So that's not an area that you have an opinion
15	on?
16	A. No.
17	Q. Do you have an opinion as to whether or not a
18	corporation who does make information publicly available
19	has an obligation to tell its customers what it knows
20	about the health effects of its products?
21	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
22	THE WITNESS: Again, that's outside my
23	realm of expertise.
24	BY MR. LATINBERG:
25	Q. Have you considered at all the statements made
0040
1	in advertisements regarding filters such as "This is it,
2	L&M filters are just what the doctor ordered"?
3	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
4	THE WITNESS: Those ads were eliminated by
5	the Federal Trade Commission and they had no
6	relevance to the decedent who didn't smoke
7	those cigarettes in terms of a Liggett product.
8	BY MR. LATINBERG:
9	Q. Do you have an opinion as to whether or not
10	the publicly available information or advertisements
11	regarding cigarettes generally by any other brand would
12	have an impact on a particular smoker even if it wasn't
13	the brand that they smoked?
14	A. I have no opinion.
15	Q. But you would agree that among the publicly
16	available information to a cigarette smoker are the
17	content of advertisements by the tobacco companies?
18	A. Excuse me?
19	Q. You would agree that within the quantum of
20	information available to a smoker would be the
21	information contained in advertisements by the tobacco
22	companies?
23	A. No, I would not. I'm not an expert in this
24	field in terms of advertising with regard to the issue
25	that you raised here. That's beyond my expertise.
0041
1	Q. I'm asking whether or not it would be
2	information available to them. That's not beyond your
3	expertise.
4	A. Advertising available to them?
5	Q. Yes.
6	A. Sure. But advertising are not -- remember, my
7	focus is on health risk. Advertising is not a credible
8	source of health risk information.
9	Q. And apart from your comment that common sense
10	tells us that advertisements are not credible, do you
11	have any scholarly treatise or articles or books that
12	you rely on for that proposition?
13	A. I read about it in my textbooks, History of
14	the United States. Advertising Heroes in the late 19th
15	Century. If there weren't a concern about advertising,
16	they would not have established the Federal Trade
17	Commission to regulate it.
18	Q. Have you heard the Kent advertisement, "What a
19	Priceless Difference in Protection a Few Extra Pennies
20	Make" with respect to their filter?
21	A. Again, for the purposes of this case, this
22	decedent, it wasn't relevant.
23	Q. But have you heard it?
24	A. No.
25	Q. Are you familiar with that ad?
0042
1	A. No.
2	Q. Are you familiar with the ad for Viceroy, "New
3	Health Guard Filter makes Viceroy Better for your
4	Health"?
5	A. Again, these were eliminated by the Federal
6	Trade Commission in 1955.
7	Q. What about the ad from Parliament, are you
8	familiar with this ad that said "Recessed Filter Maximum
9	Health Protection" ?
10	A. Again, same answer. These so-called health
11	claims were eliminated by the Federal Trade Commission.
12	Q. Now, are you, as part of your research in
13	terms of what was publicly available, did you consider
14	the form and content of the advertisements in terms of
15	their glamor or use of stars or sports figures?
16	A. Again, advertising is designed to sell
17	products; it's not a source of health information.
18	Q. Now, do you rely at all on any polls with
19	regard to what the public knew or understood regarding
20	the health effects of smoking?
21	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
22	BY MR. LATINBERG:
23	Q. Your opinions?
24	A. Not what they knew and understood, no.
25	Q. Do you have on any policies in any way with
0043
1	regard to your opinions?
2	A. Only as they relate to if people have heard
3	about the controversy or about the issue of or about the
4	report of, but I don't recall utilizing those.
5	Q. So there aren't any particular polls?
6	A. No.
7	Q. Gallup policies or other polls?
8	A. If they are referenced, and I can't recall
9	whether they are on the reliance list, they are polls
10	asking whether you have heard that scientific studies
11	have suggested a link between smoking and cancer but not
12	what people knew or understood because there's no way to
13	gauge that.
14	Q. And just so that I'm clear and we can be
15	prepared for trial, I just want to understand what --
16	the extent to which you rely on polls for any aspect of
17	your opinions.
18	A. There are very few polls that measure what
19	people have heard. Most of the polls deal with what you
20	believe and what you understand. So the answer is
21	rarely.
22	Q. So you're drawing a distinction between a poll
23	that might ask have you heard of the existence of a
24	particular position one way or another versus what they
25	believe to be --
0044
1	A. That's correct. Most of the Gallup polls are
2	belief polls.
3	Q. So you haven't considered any polls undertaken
4	by the Tobacco Institute in 1966 for your opinions?
5	A. Not unless they were publicly disseminated.
6	Q. And as you sit here today, do you know whether
7	or not the Tobacco Institute Poll of 1966 was publicly
8	disseminated?
9	A. Not to my knowledge.
10	Q. Do you recall the advertising campaign of
11	Liggett which had a headline, "Just what the Doctor
12	Ordered"?
13	A. Again, this was eliminated by the Federal
14	Trade Commission.
15	Q. I understand. But you acknowledge that it was
16	an advertising campaign?
17	A. It was an advertisement. Yes.
18	Q. Okay. And do you have an opinion as to what
19	the public would have taken away from an advertisement
20	that used a title "Just what the Doctor Ordered"?
21	A. I have no idea.
22	Q. And you don't know anything about the doctor
23	who was promoted in those advertisements as the one who
24	was, quote, making the statement, "Just what the Doctor
25	Ordered"?
0045
1	A. No.
2	Q. Would it matter to you if the doctor was a
3	Ph.D. and an employee of Liggett and not a medical
4	doctor?
5	A. Again, it's what's publicly available. If it
6	weren't publicly available, it wouldn't matter.
7	Q. And, again, in the publicly available scope of
8	information, do you have an understanding as to what
9	Tobacco Institute or CTR promoted itself with respect to
10	its independence or lack thereof with the tobacco
11	industry?
12	MR. FEIWUS: Asked and answered.
13	THE WITNESS: No. I've already answered
14	that.
15	BY MR. LATINBERG:
16	Q. You don't know?
17	A. As I indicated, they were described in the
18	press and the press described the tobacco industry or
19	institute as a trade group. The other groups, their
20	names indicated what they were doing. They were not
21	references as being independent.
22	Q. Are you familiar with the concept of cognitive
23	dissidence?
24	A. No.
25	Q. You're not familiar with that concept?
0046
1	A. No.
2	Q. Are you aware of an article by the title "To
3	Smoke or Not to Smoke?"
4	A. I have to have more information on that.
5	Q. It was published in the magazine True. Are
6	you familiar with that?
7	A. 1956.
8	Q. 1967.
9	A. 1967? I know there was one True magazine
10	article that drew the wrath of the press because there
11	was a relationship between the reporter and the
12	industry. And that raised a furor in terms of
13	credibility.
14	Q. And do you know whether that was the article
15	in True magazine called "To Smoke or Not to Smoke"?
16	A. I think it may have been. Yes.
17	Q. What do you understand to be the publicly
18	available information regarding both the article and the
19	wrath that followed the revelation that it was
20	propagated by the industry?
21	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
22	(Brief interruption.)
23	BY MR. LATINBERG:
24	Q. What do you understand to be the publicly
25	available information regarding the article published in
0047
1	True entitled "To Smoke or Not to Smoke," that is still
2	the question, and the revelation that the article was
3	propagated by the industry?
4	A. What I recall --
5	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
6	THE WITNESS: -- and it was disseminated
7	in the press is that there was a major outcry
8	that this was not proper. It was unethical.
9	BY MR. LATINBERG:
10	Q. Anything else that you can recall?
11	A. That's it.
12	Q. Are you familiar with the Auerback Study
13	involving Smoking Beagles?
14	A. Oscar Auerback, yes, the pathologist in New
15	Jersey.
16	Q. What do you recall about the publicly
17	available information regarding the Smoking Beagles'
18	experiment?
19	A. It was widely publicized. The tobacco
20	industry took issue with it and the outcry over it was,
21	again, like the True magazine story, rather critical of
22	the tobacco industry.
23	Q. Are you aware of the involvement of the
24	Surgeon General with respect to the controversy
25	involving the Smoking Beagles, was that publicly
0048
1	available information to your knowledge?
2	A. I don't recall that.
3	Q. Do you recall what was publicly disseminated
4	with respect to the Tobacco Institute's interactions
5	with the American Cancer Society as it related to the
6	Smoking Beagles' experiment?
7	A. No.
8	Q. And you're not providing any opinions
9	regarding what Betty Blitch knew about the risks of
10	smoking or its hazards at all?
11	A. No, I am not.
12	Q. And then included on the disk of reliance
13	materials there were articles from a variety of
14	newspapers, specifically in a subfolder, Florida Times
15	Union, Atlanta Constitution. Are you familiar with
16	those?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. How were those gathered?
19	A. When we did the Engle case back in 1998, '99,
20	one of those years, we reviewed Florida newspapers and
21	also we reviewed subsequently for future trials the
22	Atlanta Constitution. Those were reviewed back in that
23	era and collected.
24	Q. So they weren't collected in connection with
25	this particular matter?
0049
1	A. No. This was done a long time ago.
2	Q. Am I correct in understanding that from time
3	to time your wife helped you in gathering some of the
4	articles that you -- contained in those 13 boxes?
5	A. She did.
6	Q. And does your wife have any particular
7	training or experience in the area of history?
8	A. She is a Ph.D.
9	Q. In what?
10	A. She has a Ph.D. in education.
11	Q. Do you have any opinion as to what was
12	publicly available regarding what is described in the
13	Surgeon General's report as three levels of belief?
14	A. No. I do not deal with belief. I dealt with
15	publicly available information. Not belief.
16	Q. Are you familiar with Fishbein's work from
17	1977 regarding the three levels of belief?
18	A. It's outside my area of expertise.
19	Q. I'm asking if you're familiar with it?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. The concept that there's one level of belief
22	which is described as level one awareness?
23	A. Again, I'm aware of it but I can't comment on
24	it. I'm not an expert in that field.
25	Q. When you used the word "belief" or I'm using
0050
1	the word "belief" in terms of the scope of your
2	testimony, you're not providing opinions as to what
3	people understood or believed?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. Do you have any specific testimony with
6	respect to available information to Betty Blitch
7	regarding Eve cigarettes?
8	A. No.
9	Q. Do you have any specific opinions regarding
10	Betty Blitch's availability of -- for information from
11	the Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company?
12	A. No.
13	Q. Do you have a date at which the public became
14	more or generally aware of a health risk associated with
15	smoking?
16	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
17	THE WITNESS: Again, I don't deal with the
18	issue of what people are aware of, know,
19	believe, et cetera.
20	I will say that the publicly available
21	information became significant in the 1950s and it
22	increased throughout the decade of the '60's, '70's
23	and '80's and to this day continues.
24	BY MR. LATINBERG:
25	Q. And have you, in providing expert testimony in
0051
1	terms of what was publicly available, did you consider
2	or include the efforts of the tobacco industry in
3	reprinting publicly available articles and disseminating
4	those to opinion leaders such as doctors and other media
5	outlets?
6	A. If they landed in the press, yes. If they
7	landed in a doctor's office who didn't go to a newspaper
8	and bring it to their attention, there's no way for me
9	to know it.
10	Q. So you have no knowledge about reprints and
11	dissemination of reprints?
12	A. I do not. Not unless it's in the press and I
13	didn't see these.
14	Q. When were you retained in this case?
15	A. In December. 2010.
16	Q. And who were you retained by?
17	A. Kelly Ann Luther, Ms. Kelly Ann Luther.
18	Q. And do you understand what tobacco company is
19	being sued?
20	A. Yes.
21	MR. FEIWUS: I'm sorry. What was the
22	question?
23	BY MR. LATINBERG:
24	Q. What tobacco company is being sued?
25	A. Liggett.
0052
1	Q. Any other defendants to your knowledge?
2	A. Not to my knowledge.
3	Q. When you were retained by Ms. Luther, what
4	were you told would be the scope of your engagement?
5	A. The same as it has been with respect to other
6	cases I've done for Liggett with respect to my emphasis
7	upon the extent to which there was publicly available
8	information relating to the health risks of smoking for
9	this particular individual.
10	Q. I will show you what we will mark as Exhibit 2
11	and ask if you have seen this Plaintiffs Second Amended
12	Notice of Taking Deposition Duces Tecum of Dr. Thomas
13	DiBacca?
14	A. Yes. I got a copy of that.
15	(Plaintiffs Exhibit No. 2 was marked for
16	identification.)
17	BY MR. LATINBERG:
18	Q. And then I'll show you what's marked as
19	Exhibit 3 it's the objections of Liggett with respect to
20	that notice, and ask if you're familiar with that?
21	A. No, I'm not.
22	(Plaintiffs Exhibit No. 3 was marked for
23	identification.)
24	BY MR. LATINBERG:
25	Q. Okay.
0053
1	A. Do you want me to look it over?
2	Q. If you would, please.
3	(Brief recess.)
4	BY MR. LATINBERG:
5	Q. Let's go back on the record.
6	Dr. DiBacco, before the break you indicated
7	that you hadn't seen the objections that were filed by
8	counsel with respect to the subpoena. Have you now had
9	occasion to look at that?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. Do you agree or disagree?
12	A. I agree.
13	Q. And in there at I guess paragraph 35, category
14	35 with respect to I requested deposition transcripts,
15	it doesn't list any depositions that you read, does it?
16	It ends with a colon and then no information where the
17	yellow highlighter is?
18	A. I see. And I've given you all those.
19	Q. So you brought with you today the deposition
20	transcripts of the fact witnesses in the Betty Blitch
21	case?
22	A. Yes.
23	MR. FEIWUS: Not only that, I think if you
24	ask Tom he can probably supplement that
25	information.
0054
1	THE WITNESS: I can tell you who they are,
2	but they are all there. Do you want me to name
3	them?
4	BY MR. LATINBERG:
5	Q. That's okay. It's just those that you brought
6	with you today.
7	A. There are eight of them.
8	Q. Have you prepared any written report to this
9	case?
10	A. No.
11	Q. Have you prepared any summaries for this case?
12	A. No.
13	Q. Have you ever prepared a written report or
14	summary for any case?
15	A. No. I filed affidavits for various cases in
16	support of a summary judgment motion, but, no, I've
17	never prepared a report.
18	Q. Have you ever been asked to prepare a report?
19	A. No.
20	Q. Give you what we will mark as Exhibit 4.
21	MR. FEIWUS: Off the record, by the way.
22	(Discussion off the record.)
23	(Plaintiffs Exhibit No. 4 was marked for
24	identification.)
25	BY MR. LATINBERG:
0055
1	Q. I show you what's been marked as Exhibit 4.
2	It's a 1961 document. It's called L & M, A Perspective
3	Review, and it describes biologically active materials
4	present in cigarette tobacco as causing cancer and
5	promoting cancer and poisonous. Have you ever seen this
6	document before?
7	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
8	THE WITNESS: No. It was never put out in
9	the press.
10	(Plaintiffs Exhibit No. 5 was marked for
11	identification.)
12	BY MR. LATINBERG:
13	Q. I'll show you what we will next mark as
14	Exhibit 5. It's a composite exhibit of a variety of
15	documents. The top one is entitled "The Cigarette
16	Controversy: Why More Research is Needed." It's a
17	review by the Tobacco Institute of recent medical and
18	scientific evidence presented to the United States
19	congressional committees.
20	My question is whether or not you recognize
21	that as something that was disseminated into the
22	publicly available information?
23	A. Is there a date on this?
24	Q. At the page that has a 707 on the bottom
25	comer indicates it's February 1984.
0056
1	A. Yes. This was covered in the press,
2	April 24th is what I have. What do you have?
3	Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. Okay. There was
4	reference to this in the press and I remember one Time
5	article indicating -- this was a response to the Surgeon
6	General's report and the Time article began, expectedly
7	the Tobacco Institute took issue.
8	Q. One of my questions is whether or not this
9	document, the Cigarette Controversy, Why More Research
10	is Needed, is this included in your 13 boxes?
11	A. No, because this never went into the press in
12	total. You have some news stories and it did go through
13	in news stories.
14	Q. So this public relations document upon which
15	articles might have been written is not a document you
16	include in your reliance materials but it is the
17	articles that might have derived from it is something
18	that you rely upon?
19	A. That's correct. As an indication of the
20	tobacco industry stance, yes.
21	Q. An then on the page following that page that
22	we were just looking at there's a memo from 1954 and it
23	talks about a booklet by the TIRC entitled A Scientific
24	Perspective on the Cigarette Controversy. In the
25	interest of being green, I printed this double-sided.
0057
1	Right there.
2	A. Right here.
3	Q. Right here we are. It has a number 747.
4	A. Okay.
5	Q. At the bottom -- and there it describes a
6	booklet called A Scientific Perspective on the Cigarette
7	Controversy. Have you ever heard of that booklet
8	before?
9	A. And this is dated May 1954.
10	Q. Yes, sir.
11	A. Yes. This was covered in the press and
12	there's reference to it as well, and I do recall.
13	Q. But did you know, as you sit here today, did
14	you know that there were 205,000 copies of the booklet
15	printed and disseminated?
16	A. I think that was included in a press story.
17	Yes.
18	Q. Do you know what press story?
19	A. No, not offhand.
20	May I give this to her?
21	Q. Yes, please.
22	I'll show you what we will next mark as
23	Exhibit 6.
24	(Plaintiffs Exhibit No. 6 was marked for
25	identification.)
0058
1	BY MR. LATINBERG:
2	Q. It was marked as Exhibit 8 to Dr. Goldberg's
3	deposition as well and it's an article or an ad I should
4	say that describes work by Liggett and Myers Company
5	involving a half million dollar 30-ton machine, the
6	World's Most Powerful Source of High Voltage Electrons
7	designed solely for our use has tested tens of thousands
8	of cigarettes.
9	A. Is there a date on this?
10	Q. I don't have the date. I believe it's the
11	early '50's.
12	But is this a document that you're aware of?
13	A. No. I've never seen it. I'd like to know the
14	date but there's no date on here.
15	Q. No. I acknowledge that.
16	Sir, you made reference to the fact that Ms.
17	Blitch smoked Chesterfield cigarettes in the '40's.
18	What was your basis for that?
19	A. The form that she filled out in 1996 that
20	indicated usage.
21	Q. And I did not notice that amongst the stack of
22	documents that you brought here today or in the
23	documents on the CD?
24	A. Mr. Feiwus was trying to send it to me and for
25	some reason I could not get it. He showed it to me this
0059
1	morning.
2	Q. So he previously tried to provide it to you?
3	A. He did and my machine, for whatever reason --
4	MR. FEIWUS: He was unable to open it.
5	THE WITNESS: I couldn't open it.
6	(Plaintiffs Exhibit No. 7 was marked for
7	identification.)
8	BY MR. LATINBERG:
9	Q. So I'm showing you what was marked as
10	Exhibit 7 to this deposition. Is this the questionnaire
11	to which you just referred?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. And so you relied upon that information for
14	the proposition that she smoked in the '40's
15	Chesterfield?
16	A. And Eve in the --
17	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
18	THE WITNESS: For one year, Chesterfield.
19	(Plaintiffs Exhibit No. 8 was marked for
20	identification.)
21	BY MR. LATINBERG:
22	Q. I'll show you what we will mark as Exhibit 8.
23	It's a chapter from the 2007 Surgeon General Report
24	titled Factors Influencing Tobacco use Among Women and
25	ask if you're familiar with this Surgeon General report?
0060
1	A. Now this is beyond the time span of my
2	research if it's 2007.
3	Q. So it's not anything that you considered in
4	connection with the opinions in this case?
5	A. No. There is no date on this.
6	Q. I acknowledge that. I don't have the full
7	volume.
8	A. All right.
9	(Plaintiffs Exhibit No. 9 was marked for
10	identification.)
11	BY MR. LATINBERG:
12	Q. I'll show you what we will mark as Exhibit 9.
13	It's an article by Robert Cirino entitled "Don't Blame
14	the People," and ask if that's a document that you're
15	familiar with?
16	A. Do we have a date on it?
17	Q. 1971 according to the second page of the
18	exhibit.
19	A. Is this an article or is this a book?
20	Q. It may be a book. It may be a chapter from a
21	book.
22	A. I think this is part of a book. I've seen
23	this.
24	Q. Do you consider any aspect of the information
25	in that exhibit as a part of your opinions in this case?
0061
1	MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
2	THE WITNESS: No. This is an interpretive
3	study and critical study on the media. My job
4	is to look at what was out there and how
5	abundant it was.
6	BY MR. LATINBERG:
7	Q. So you did not consider what was marked as
8	Exhibit 9?
9	A. No.
10	(Plaintiffs Exhibit No. 10 was marked for
11	identification.)
12	BY MR. LATINBERG:
13	Q. I'll show you an exhibit with a cover page
14	that says Eve Promotions. And it's an advertising as
15	well as some internal documents regarding Liggett's
16	efforts to promote the Eve package. Are these
17	advertisements anything that you would consider as a
18	part of your opinions in this case?
19	A. These all reflect the Surgeon General's
20	warnings so it was post-warning period.
21	Q. My question was whether or not it's anything
22	that you consider as a part of your opinions?
23	A. Yes. The warnings on the ads in terms of the
24	information that was disseminated. That's a part of
25	health risks of smoking with all these warning ads.
0062
1	Q. Other than the fact that they contained
2	federally mandated warnings, is there any other aspect
3	of the information contained within the promotions or
4	advertising that you consider as a part of your opinion
5	in terms of what was publicly available regarding the
6	health effects of smoking?
7	A. Remember what I said earlier, I testified or
8	said earlier with respect to advertisements, they are
9	designed to sell products and they are not credible
10	sources. After 1972 with the warnings on there, then
11	there are parts of the ads that are credible sources of
12	health information.
13	Q. So just the white box?
14	A. That's right.
15	(Plaintiffs Exhibit No. 11 was marked for
16	identification.)
17	BY MR. LATINBERG:
18	Q. I presume the same would be true of what I'll
19	mark as Exhibit 11 with a title of Eve Pleasant
20	Environment Ads?
21	A. Yes. That's correct.
22	(Plaintiffs Exhibit No. 12 was marked for
23	identification.)
24	BY MR. LATINBERG:
25	Q. And the same is true with what I'll mark as
0063
1	Exhibit 12, Roswell Park Eve Woman Ads?
2	A. Yes. That's correct.
3	(Plaintiffs Exhibit No. 13 was marked for
4	identification.)
5	BY MR. LATINBERG:
6	Q. And the same with respect to what I'll mark as
7	Exhibit 13, Eve Packaging?
8	A. Yes. That's correct.
9	Q. Now, you have -- we have talked about the fact
10	that the scope of your testimony is as to what was
11	publicly available with respect to areas of disease,
12	death, habituation, addiction, difficulty of quitting.
13	Do you have any specific opinions as to what available
14	information was the -- was the available information
15	different decade by decade?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. And what was the different information that
18	was available, for example, between the '50's and the
19	'60's as it related to habituation or addiction?
20	A. With respect to the '50's, the word that was
21	used throughout the '50's and '60's was habituation.
22	The Federal Government does not use the term addiction
23	until the Surgeon General of 1988. And throughout most
24	of this period of the '50's and 60's and '70's the term
25	habituation was used. And then increasingly by the
0064
1	'80's the term "addiction" began to surface.
2	Q. What about the differences with respect to
3	available information as it related to difficulty of
4	quitting in those decades?
5	A. That was always a very strong part of the
6	information environment. The difficulty of quitting was
7	a major component. It's one of the reasons why groups
8	such as the American Cancer Society, American Lung
9	Association and other groups set up toll-free lines so
10	that people could get help such as 1-800-ACS-2345 or
11	1-800-Quitnow and the American Lung Association did that
12	and the Federal Government also chimed in as well.
13	Q. So the public information that was available
14	you're saying basically throughout the time period --
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. — was that it was very difficult to quit
17	smoking?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. And that the terminology used to describe the
20	hook, if you will, on the cigarette smoker more from the
21	word habituation to addiction?
22	A. It did.
23	Q. What about the publicly available information
24	as it evolved through the '50's to the present with
25	respect to the risks of disease or death?
0065
1	A. That increased too and the number of diseases
2	added on throughout the period increased so that by the
3	period of the '90s you have a litany of diseases that
4	are associated with smoking.
5	Q. How did you come to be an expert in the area
6	of -- in this topic area, how did you ultimately get
7	hired?
8	MR. FEIWUS: Objection. It's two
9	different questions.
10	THE WITNESS: I was never hired. I do not
11	work for any of the tobacco companies or the
12	law firms. I had done an article for USA Today
13	back in 1995 and it was an article dealing with
14	the federal -- the Food and Drug
15	Administration. And the USA Today had a for
16	and against type column and I did the column
17	that suggested that there was not any need for
18	further regulation of tobacco or cigarette
19	products because the information regarding the
20	health risk of smoking had been so widely
21	disseminated.
22	And a lawyer from one of the firms called me
23	up and asked me if I might be interested in
24	preparing myself for more research and eventual
25	utilization in trials involving the cigarette
0066
1	companies.
2	BY MR. LATINBERG:
3	Q. In October 2010 you provided deposition
4	testimony in the David Katz case?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. At that time you indicated that since 1995
7	until the present you had been paid about $380,000; is
8	that correct?
9	A. Right. That's correct.
10	Q. And a little bit since then?
11	A. Yes. I've made about -- billing for this
12	case, I think I billed about $2,000.
13	MR. LATINBERG: Nothing further.
14	MR. FEIWUS: I have nothing.
15	MR. LATINBERG: Thank you very much.
16	Do you want to read or waive?
17	THE WITNESS: I want to read.
18	MR. FEIWUS: Can we get it in a week?
19	Hard copy and e-trans both.
20	MR. LATINBERG: I'll have someone call and
21	let you know.
22	(Witness excused.)
23	(Deposition was concluded.)
