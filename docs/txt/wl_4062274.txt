Graham. And I'm wondering if there is any evidence in the record to suggest that Ms. Smith heard Billy Graham preach on
the issue of cigarette smoking?
A. Her father, of course, was a Baptist minister. Therefore -- but we don't know. And there is no testimony that indicates she went
and saw Billy Graham speak at any time. Although, she did read the Florida Times Union, in which Billy Graham appeared.
Q. As you sit here today, is there any evidence in the record that Ms. Smith actually read the article in the Florida paper in
which Billy Graham may have appeared?
A. No, there is not. We don't know what specific articles she would have read.
Q. Your report also talks about the effort of Presbyterians or the Presbyterian church on tobacco-related issues.
And my question is, is there any evidence in the record to suggest that Ms. Smith was aware of the efforts by the Presbyterian
church to educate on the issue of tobacco and how --
A. Again, we don't know what specific articles she would have read. So the newspapers that she subscribed to would discuss
it. But we don't know, and I don't know, if she read the articles about the Presbyterians.
Q. Same question for The Seventh Day Adventists, is there any evidence in the record that Ms. Smith was aware of the efforts
of The Seventh Day Adventists and what they were doing specifically on the issue of smoking and health?
A. Well, she attended an anti-smoking clinic at one point, which may well have been one of the ones sponsored by The Seventh
Day Adventists. But there is no testimony that specifically states who offered the clinic that she attended briefly.
Q. And is there any evidence in the record that Ms. Smith was aware of the anti-smoking efforts of the Mormons?
A. That -- the same answer would apply. I am unaware that she -- we don't know what specific articles she read.
Q. In the next part of your report you focus on various textbooks in Florida and what they said about smoking.
My question is, do you have any doubt that Ms. Smith would have seen television commercials or commercials on television
for cigarettes during the time when she was a child and a teenager?
A. I think that there is no reference in the case materials, the depositions to that, that I'm aware of or
[Note: Pages 91-180 missing in original document]
A. She might have seen Florida Health Notes. I don't think she would have seen this one from 1906.
Q. Okay. There is a slide, Slide 49, that has Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! by Tex Williams. Is it your intent to -- you know, is there
a -- do you have intend to play this in connection with your testimony, play the song?
A. Yes, I do.

Q. And Slide 50 is a popular -- it's entitled “Popular Movies.” My slide is completely blank. Do you know what movies this
is referencing?
A. I haven't really decided which movies yet to show. There are a number of movies that are in the reliance materials we
provided. But mine is blank too. I've got what you've got.
Q. Okay. Then Slide 51 through 56 are all Reader's Digest slides. Is that correct?
A. That's right, they are.
Q. As you sit here today, do you have any evidence to the effect that Ms. Smith actually read any of the articles that are profiled
in these slides?
A. We know she was a regular reader of Reader's Digest. But these slides would precede when she would have been a reader.
They're to establish context.
Q. All right. So as you sit here today, you have no evidence that Ms. Smith read any of these articles. Is that correct?
A. No. She might have -- I don't think she would read any of these particular ones. They're just too early. But they would
establish the context in Florida, the climate of information in which she was born and grew up.
Q. As you sit here today, do you have any evidence that Ms. Smith has read any of these Reader's Digest articles that are
depicted in Slide 51 through 56?
A. Oh, no.
Q. Slide 57 is a Newsweek article. As you sit here today, do you have any evidence that Ms. Smith would have read this
Newsweek article from 1950?
A. No, I don't. This was before she was born.
Q. Do you have any evidence that Ms. Smith read the article that is depicted in Slide 58 from Newsweek?
A. No, not -- no, I don't think she would have read that, per se, because she was only three-years-old.
Q. Do you have any evidence that Ms. Smith would have read the articles in Time or Newsweek that are depicted on Slide 59?
A. No. Again, this would go to her family, older siblings and parents possibly, but not Ms. Smith herself.
Q. Do you have any evidence that Ms. Smith would have been read any of the articles that are depicted in Slides 60 or Slide 61?
A. No.
Q. Do you have any evidence that Ms. Smith would have read any of the articles -- the Life Magazine articles depicted in 62
or Slide 64?
A. No, I don't think she would read them herself.

Q. Do you have any evidence that Ms. Smith would have read any of the articles, the Reader's Digest articles that are in Slide 64?
A. No. These would have preceded her years as a reader, I believe. She might have -- older siblings again, or parents, but not
herself.
Q. Do you have any reason to believe that Ms. Smith read any of the articles inside Slide 65 -- depicted in Slide 65?
A. No, the same answer applies.
Q. Does the same answer apply to all of the articles that are depicted in Slide 66?
A. Yes.
Q. Does the same answer apply to the article depicted in Slide 67?
A. Yes. This goes to the state of knowledge in Florida, not to her particular reading.
Q. Does the same answer apply to Slide 68?
A. Yes, it does.
Q. And Slide 69?
A. Yes.
Q. And Slide 70?
A. Yes. This, again, is contextual for her family, not for her reader -- her own reading.
Q. Same question as to Slide 71?
A. Yes.
Q. Same question as to Slide 72?
A. Yes. That's right, I don't expect she would have read that.
Q. Same question as to Slide 73?
A. Yes, that's right.
Q. Okay. And same question as to the articles depicted in Slide 74?
A. Yes, they're contextual.
Q. Do you have any reason to believe that Ms. Smith would have read any of those articles?
A. No.

Q. Do you have any reason to believe that Ms. Smith would have read the article on -- depicted in Slide 79?
A. No.
Q. Same question as to Slide 80?
A. No. This is 1957. So she would have only been two. I don't believe she would have read this.
Q. Same question as to Slide 81?
A. No, I don't think she -- she wasn't in school yet. So I don't think she would have been reading that material.
Q. Same with Slide 82, same question?
A. And that would be the same answer.
Q. Slide 83, same question?
A. Same answer.
Q. Slide 84, same question?
A. Yes. This simply is to establish the context of the information in which she was growing up at the time. But I don't believe
she would have read that article.
Q. Same question for all of the articles depicted on Slide 85?
A. Yes, the same answer.
Q. Same answer, that is, that you have no evidence that Ms. Smith would have reviewed any of these articles. Correct?
A. That's right. She would have been too young at that time to read that.
Q. Slide 86, did counsel provide that photograph of the Surgeon General to you?
A. Oh, I don't think so. It's one I think I have had for a long time. But it's easy to get them on Google images. I just don't
remember. It's been around for a??
