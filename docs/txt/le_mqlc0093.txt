Q. What do you mean by an exhibit list?
A, A list of exhibits.
MR. purvis: I believe the witness is referring to Ms. Tyler's letter to Stanley of May 21 forwarding the list of exhibits that this witness is relying upon.
Is that correct, Professor?	.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
Q. How many items are on the list?
A. There's a total of 863 items.
Q. 863 items?
A. 863 items. And my reliance is on numbers one through 848.
Q. What are the other items?
A. Do you want me to read them?
Q. No. Why are they on the list?
A. They relate to items, as the letter indicates here, that could conceivably be used in the trial.
Q. I do not have a copy of that list.
Let me check with someone and see if I can find that real quickly. If not, I'll ask you to maybe fax it over. Let's take a few minute break.
(Recess taken,)
MS. SCHNEIDER: I don't see where we've gotten that letter with the list of
exhibits. Could you all have someone fax that over to us?
MS. JOHNSON: This is Jan. This was sent by fax to Stanley on May 21 and it's a 45-page document plus cover sheet.
MS. SCHNEIDER: I'm telling you that I don't have it and I don't believe that we have received it and I'm asking you to fax me a copy. MS. JOHNSON: 1 said okay, we can do
that.
MS. SCHNEIDER; Thank you.
[Discussion off the record]
MR. PURVIS: That's going to take a few minutes.
MS. SCHNEIDER: That's fine. We can
go on,
Q. Doctor — I guess not. Are you a doctor?
MS. JOHNSON: it's going to take us a few minutes to get the fax under way.
MS. schneidbr.: Just lot me know when you all are ready.
(Recess taken.)
MR. PURVIS: The fax is on the way.
MS. SCHNEIDER: So we are ready?
MR. PURVIS: Yes, we are.
Q. The items that are on this list, are these items that you obtained or were provided to you or both?
A. These were items I obtained.
Q. So you obtained every item that's on the list, 860-some-odd things?	'
A. No. You will note that in the letter, mine only rely upon or mine are only placed upon one through I believe I said 838. I do not have the exhibit list-here because it's being faxed to you but only one through 838, or whatever number 1 gave you.
Q. I wasn't asking you about what you relied upon or what you are relying upon. My question was were these items, all of them, provided to you or did you obtain them yourself or both?
A. The sum of 838. 1 believe that was the number I stressed,
Q. Those are the articles that you obtained?
a, Yes.
q. The remainder of the articles were provided to you?
A. No. I have no idea what they are.
MS. JOHNSON: That may clarify the situation. The Broin exhibit list was served on you. It was a lengthy document and you received a letter from Ms. Tyler on the 21st informing you that Dr. DiBacco would be relying on documents numbered in the letter, which I don't have in front of me because it's being faxed -1 believe it's one through 838 - so that explains what the other documents are. They are part of another bigger exhibit list.
Q. So that, Doctor, the items up through 838 relate to what you are relying upon and the other items do not relate to your testimony?
A, That is correct. I have no idea what the other items are.
Q So there is not a separate list with each of the other experts?
We've had a separate list with the experts' names at the top and then a list of articles or items that they were relying upon.
That is not what we have in your case; we have the exhibit list and you're referring to the exhibit list, is that correct?
A Thai k nrrt twrrari. We sent vnu &
letter faxed May 21,1997 which reads "Dear Mr. Rosenblatt: Please be advised that Dr. DiBacco may rely on some or all of the exhibits numbered one through 848 as set forth on the defendant's exhibit list for his testimony in this case.”
Q. Right. So there's no separate list of articles that you are relying upon, is that correct?
A. This is the list.
Q. But it is an exhibit list, correct?
A. It is an exhibit list.
Q. Right. Did you review more than 838 articles?
A. Yes.
Q. How did you determine which articles to copy and which articles not to copy?
A. 1 discussed these with the attorneys and decided to use these.
Q. What attorneys did you discuss them with?
A, Allen Purvis and I believe Janet Johnson,
Q. Have you read any depositions in this case orior to todav?
A. No. ■

A. Not to my knowledge, no.
Q. Have you made any court appearances in any of the tobacco litigation?

n Dnr.tAr are vrm reading from
something?
A. This is my case statement in terms of my expertise.
Q. So you were reading from something, is that correct?
A, 1 was.	.
Q. When 1 ask you a question, if you need to refer to something, I have no problem with that but please tell me what you are referring to. I do not want the record to be misleading . that you are giving an answer without referring to something so please, if you need to look at something to answer a question, please let me know what you are looking at or reading from.
A. All right. I'm looking at a summary of the expectations of testifying or the testifying that I’ll do that was provided to you.
Q. Did you draft that document?
A. I drafted it in conjunction with Mr. Purvis. Do you want me to finish the reading?
Q. No, if you're telling me that the document is what your testimony will be and it is accurate, you can tell me that.
A. Yes. it is accurate.
Q. When did you draft tbs document with Mr, Purvis?
a, 1 don't know the precise date. It was recently.

Q. Well, after you did all this research, do you have any opinions about what the purpose was of the frank statement to cigarette smokers?
A As T -recall, the statement
acknowledged the widespread publicity occurring at the time about cigarettes and health so it was part of the public awareness literature.
q. Tell me what you mean by public awareness literature.
a. Literature that indicated to the general public that there were risks involved, health risks involved in terms of smoking.
Q. Doctor, without the research that you have done in this case or since you were hired by Shook, Hardy & Bacon in October of 1995, would you have any opinions in this case?
In other words, without your research that you've done since you were contacted by Shook, Hardy & Bacon, would you have any opinions?
A. Excuse me. I don't understand that.
You said without the research?
Q. Yes.
A, Then the rest of the question?

Have you ever known a doctor who recommended to a patient that they take up smoking?
i A. 1 deal only were my doctor. 1 don't ask doctors about whether they recommend smoking to their patients. That's medical i confidentiality.

! Q. And that was just in this case,
1 correct?

several newspapers a day.
Q. Have you ever seen anything in any of the literature that you have ever read where a doctor recommended to a patient that they take up smoking?

A. Thank you. I can't think of any.
Q. You will agree, would you not, that in terms of the numbers of Americans who have quit smoking in the last 20 years or so, that the .vast majority of them have quit smoking because they became convinced that smoking was unhealthy?
A, 1 have no way of getting into the . , minds and the thinking of smokers. I have no idea.
Q. Well, what did the public do with this awareness that you are telling us about that they had with smoking and health risks?
Did they ignore it or did some people stop smoking because of the health risks?
A. Excuse me. Repeat the question.
MR. PURVIS: I object to the form.
Q. Please answer the question, Doctor.
A. I'm thinking, 1 think it provided the public with choices.

A
Q. Have you ever done any work for any tobacco company or tobacco entity before being hired by Shook, Hardy & Bacon in 1995?

Q. Answer my question, Doctor.
A, Well, with the notation that I made, I have never worked as an independent contractor with the 1099 relationship or been hired by any tobacco company.
Q. How did Shook, Hardy & Bacon know that you might be willing to do research in these tobacco litigation cases?
