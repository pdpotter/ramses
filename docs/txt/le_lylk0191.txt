JAIVES Kl RBY MARTI N, having been first duly sworn, testified as follows:
EXAM NAT I CN Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Good morning, Doctor.
A. Good mor ni ng.
Q Please state your name for the record.
A. ivy name is James Kirby IVkrtin.
Q And you've been retained by the tobacco conrpani es to do some work on their behalf in this case, cor r ect ?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form A. I've been retained by Jones Day to do some work on this case.
Q (BY IVR. PAI GE) Do you know who Jones Day's cl i ent i s?
A. Yes, I do.
Q Tel I me.
A. The client i s R. J. Reynolds.
Q Have you ever met anybody from R J. Reynolds? A. I once met one individual for approximately 10 seconds and shook his hand after a court appearance
Page 2
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt back in 2001. That's the only person I've ever met from R. J. Reynolds.
Q How many cases have you been retained -- well, st r i ke t hat.
I n t he, i n t he t obacco I i t i gat i on, is Jones Day the only I aw f i r m t hat' s ever retained you?
A. I wduI d, I wduI d have to give you the general yes. But I have been involved in cases where more than one I aw f i r m was involved. Because -- I hope that makes sense t o you.
Q R ght . But usually you go through, Jones Day i s t he one who cont act s you and who you cont act ?
A. Yes.
Q And on how many occasions has that occurred where you've been hired or retained in a case with Jones Day?
A. I wduI d have to give you an estimate. But I woul d say, I ' m goi ng to gi ve you an est i mat e i ncl udi ng right up to the moment, approximately 40 cases. Four oh.
Q Four zero?
A. Forty cases. Four zero. Yes, sir.
Q Ckay.
IVR. PAI GE: Can you hoi d on one second. Hold on one second. I want to fix this.
(Dscussion off the record)
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Wien i s i t t hat you were f i rst r et ai ned t o be i nvol ved i n t obacco I i t i gat i on?
A. The year that I was first retained was 1994.
Q And so in t he 40 cases t hat you've been r et ai ned on, how many t i mes di d you act ual I y gi ve a deposi t i on?
A. I ' m goi ng t o have t o guess at t hat. I'd say five. And that's a guess on nry part, but I'd say five.
Q And how many t i mes have you t est i f i ed at t r i al ?
A. Two. Two t i mes.
Q And on t he, on t he ot her 33 cases, approximately, were those cases where you were hired as an expert witness; or were you hired as a consultant on t hose cases?
A. \Afel I , I t hi nk t he best way for me t o answer that is probably both. Except some of those cases were dismissed and about -- t o gi ve you a specific nunrber right now, about 17 of them are active in Florida. As part of the Engle progeny cases.
Q All right. And do you know appr oxi mat el y what you bi I I ed I ast year f or your i nvol vement i n t he Engl e cases?
A. Yes. In -- and you're talking about 2009 or 2008? Because I know we just went into the new year.
Q Cor r ect.
A. Ckay. I ' m goi ng to say -- you're talking 2009?
Q Yes. 2009. Then I was going to ask you about 2008.
A. Ckay. Fine. I t hi nk i t was approximately $120,000 I ast year.
Q And the year before?
A. It was closer to 90 to 92,000.
Page 3
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt
Q And prior to 2008, over those 14 years, was there, like, an average that you billed per year to do your tobacco litigation work on t he I guess it would have been about 23 ot her cases?
A. Ri ght . It's very hard for me t o say because it depended on the year. For instance, I did, I was not involved in any cases between, roughly, June of 2004 and August of 2007. So for those three years there would have been basi cal I y no bi I I s.
Q Ckay.
A. Before that time, it would be pretty mjch a stretch of nry memory. But I would say, if you wanted an average figure, between 1994 and 2004, I'd say around
75,000	a year. But that's a total guess on nry part.
Q Ckay. So your best, your best estimate between '94 and '04 would be approximately 75,000 a year ?
A. That's about right. Yes.
Q And i n 2007, si nee i t wasn't t hat I ong ago,
how mjch do you t hi nk you bi I I ed f or t he part of t he year that you did this type of work?
A. I would, I t hi nk i t' s around 32 to 33,000.
Let me say $33,000 i n 2007.
Q Ckay. And when you were retained in the Q i va case, were you approached and retained in that case specifically; or did they come to you with these
17	Engle cases and say hey, we have these cases in Florida, their issues are sirrilar, and we want you to look at these 17 cases and as materials come available in those cases we' I I give you more information?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Just t el I me basi cal I y how i t was that you were retained i n t he Engle cases, I guess.
A. I n, I believe it was roughly late July of 2007, Christine Lawson called me and said there were a nunrber of cases t hat may be, at t hat poi nt , devel opi ng in Florida, would I perhaps be interested in serving as a consul t ant on t hem
Then at t hat poi nt i n t i me, I was not assigned to any cases because I don't believe there were any cases available to be assigned. But I started to do general research.
And then you move into 2008. And the cases have come to me over a period of time. In other
words, there nri ght be one or two or one or two or three over a period of ti me i n 2008 and 2009.
And I bel i eve, i f I coul d gi ve you a good date for t he Q i va case, I was asked to serve as a consultant on that case in late June of 2009. But that was, that was a separate -- in other words, there weren't any other cases involved in that except that one.
Q Wiat, before -- who contacted you in '94, do you remenrt>er?
A. Yes. A gentleman by the name of Steve Kaczi nski . I can't spell it for you. And his associate at t hat t i me was Paul Koet he, whi ch I can spel I .
K- o- e-1 - h- e.
Q And do you know -- did you have a special interest in cigarette conrpani es at that time that they sought you out for, or do you know how they chose you or
Page 4
how t hey f ound you?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. It's ny inrpression that the work that I di d i n t he f i el d of dr i nki ng and al cohol , Dr i nki ng i n Amer i ca, the book was published in 1982 with the revised version in 1987, that they were aware as certainly I was aware at t he t i me t hat there's a parallel history with respect t o t he history of smoking. And I can only guess; but it
was nry assunrpt i on that was probably the reason they approached me, because of that work. And it had actually been recognized in an inrportant case with respect to drinking as a standard work with respect to cormnon knowledge and historical awareness issues having to do wi t h al cohol .
Q (BY IVR. PAI GE) Wfel I , when you say t here was a parallel history, is there a history with the alcohol industry where they concealed information and knew of the health hazards and lied about t hem t o the public?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form IVR MURPHY: Cbj ect to t he f or m A. \Afel I , you've bui I t i n a cer t ai n ser i es of assunrpt i ons about what we were looking at. And we weren't looking at the alcohol industry. Wfe were looking at what was the public awareness and popular understanding and changing attitudes toward alcohol over a 300-year per i od.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. But i n your work as a historian of the alcohol industry, did they, are you aware of the fact that they lied to the public and concealed information that they knew about ?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form A. I'm not - - I don't know how t o answer t hat question because it wasn't a focal point of our
r esear ch.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Did you, the Engle cases, do you generally know what they're about? The Engle findings, have they been shared with you?
A. I would say in a very general way, yes.
Q Ckay. You're aware of the fact that tobacco conrpani es and the industry was found to have conspired to conceal the health hazards of smoking and the addictive nature of nicotine?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Do you know t hat ?
IVR MURPHY: Cbj ect - -A. I'm awar e t hat - -
IVR MURPHY: - - t o f or m A. I'm generally aware, although I haven't read that specifically, that that's what the Engle conclusion was.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) How i s i t t hat you were made generally aware of that?
A. V\fel I , this case did get national coverage in the newspapers. And as I recall I remenrtoer reading about the case in the late 1990s. That's the best date I can give you. Because of the size of the settlement, it certainly received national headlines. I have not specifically read the details of the Engle findings at
any t i me.
Q \Afel I , t he fact that the industries were found
Page 5
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt to have conspired and concealed adverse effects of smoking and the addictive nature of nicotine, do you, do you di sput e t hat ?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) That that occurred?
IVR MURPHY: Object to form
A. Those are, those are the Engle findings. I'm not here to dispute those.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) \Afel I , are they consistent or inconsistent with what you know?
A. \Afel I , nry subject area is public awareness.
IVR MURPHY: Same obj ect i on.
A. ivy - - I'll repeat that. I\ty subject area is public awareness with respect to what the general popul at i on knew about t he heal t h r i sks associ at ed wi t h smoking and also questions about the difficulties in quitting smoking. And the word, cormnon word, today is addiction. Those are nry subject areas. I did not investigate the history of the conrpani es.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Ckay. \Afel I , t he t obacco executives were menrbers of the general public, correct?
A. That' s cor r ect.
Q And you've read about their public statements
over the decades, correct?
A. \Afel I , there are -- yes, there are st at ement s - -
Wfe've got st at i c in t he I i ne. Coul d you r epeat t he quest i on?
IVR PAI GE: Ji m you' re I eani ng on your
rri cr ophone.
IVR MURPHY: Ckay. Thank you. I won' t
do t hat .
A. I didn't quite hear the question. I'm sorry.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) No, that's okay. The -- you're aware of the fact that the tobacco executives made certain statements t o t he public about their beliefs of the adverse effects of smoking over the '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s and into the '90s, correct?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form
A. I'm aware that many different statements were made about t he heal t h ef f ect s of t obacco by many different people and I presume including and, yes, I've seen statements by tobacco conrpany executives.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Wien di d t he, when di d R. J. Reynolds first, based upon your research -- and I take it you have not looked at their internal documents -A. That' s cor r ect.
Q - - i s t hat r i ght ?
A. I'm sorry. I talked over you. That's cor r ect.
Q Ckay. So t he onl y way you woul d know about the beliefs of the tobacco conrpani es are based upon their statements t o t he public, correct?
A. Yes. I'm aware that there have been statements t o t he public. Cr statements that have certainly surfaced i n t he public record.
Q Wien di d R. J. Reynolds first believe that their cigarettes caused cancer?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. That' s a quest i on t hat woul d have to do wi t h
Page 6
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt internal documents, and I can't answer that question. I don't have an answer to t hat.
Q (BY IVR. PAI GE) Ckay. Wfel I , assunri ng t hat t he statements they made t o t he public were truthful, according to your research of public statements when did R. J. Reynolds first believe cigarettes caused lung cancer ?
M3. LAV\8CN: Same obj ect i on.
A. \Afel I , what I can t el I you is t he st at ement s that I'm aware of basically would say that further research is needed. And the statistics or statistical or epi derri ol ogi cal st udi es i n and of t hemsel ves don't
prove causation. Those are the statements I'm aware of that were in the, were available t o t he general public as part of the public record.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Those are the -- all right. Those are the belief statements by the tobacco executives that they made over the '50s, '60s and '70s, cor r ect ?
M3. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. Those are, those are statements that are part of the public record, yes.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Wien di d, when di d R. J. Reynolds first publicly -- strike that.
There was a t i me t hat R J. Reynolds publicly stated that they did believe that their product caused lung cancer, correct?
M3. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. I ' m not aware of that.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. You never, you never I ear ned t hat t her e was a t i me t hat R J. Rey nol ds and Philip MDrris came forward, either -- in a variety of public media and stated that they agreed and believed that their product was addictive and caused lung cancer?
M3. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) You've not heard of that?
A. I ' m not aware of those statements.
Q Ckay. So as you sit here today, you've never, you've never heard that R J. Reynolds or Philip MDrris has finally adrritted that their product caused lung cancer or i s addi ct i ve?
A. I ' m not aware of those statements.
Q You've, you've, you've -- okay. Have you looked at any of their Wfebsites?
A. Actually, I don't believe I have.
Q So as far as you know, R. J. Reynolds has never adrritted that their product caused lung cancer?
As f ar as you know?
A. I can't answer t hat quest i on because I don't know. I haven't investigated that question.
Q Ckay. As far as -- okay. So you don't know whether Philip MDrris has ever adrritted that their product caused lung cancer?
A. I haven't investigated that question so I can't answer t he quest i on.
Q \Afel I , you read the paper, correct?
A. Ch, sure. I read it every day.
Q You watch the news, correct?
A. \Afel I , actually, given nry schedule, I don't watch the news very often.
Q Ckay. You're an expert on the history of
Page 7
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt public awareness of the health hazards of smoking,
cor r ect ?
A. That' s cor r ect.
Q And you don't know - - st r i ke t hat.
And the tobacco conrpani es are part of the general public, correct?
A. WI I , yes. W've agreed to that.
Q And you don't know, as you sit here today, whether they've ever adnritted that their product was addi ct i ve?
A. I haven't investigated that question.
Q And when did you -- your reading of newspapers to be an expert, was there a certain cutoff date that you had in your reliance materials where you didn't look at newspapers after a certain date?
A. Generally speaking, yes, that's the case. And if you want -- well, it would depend on circumstances, but probably the late 1980s or early 1990s.
Q Have you read any depositions of other hi st or i ans?
A. Yes, I have.
Q Wii ch ones have you read?
A. WI I , I ' m sor r y. I may be nri xi ng up t est i mony and depositions. But I have -- going back to, going back to 19 -- let's say '95, 1996. I'll try to come up with some names. Cne name would be M chael Schaller.
Another name would be Lacy Ford. A third name would be Jeffrey Norvel I . Those are the ones that come t o nri nd of f t he t op of nry head.
Q Wien's the last time you read one of Lacy Ford's depositions or trial testimony?
A. Probably -- well, within the past week.
Q And which one did you read?
A. 11 was a deposi t i on t hat was done appr oxi mat el y, I'm goi ng t o guess at this, a year, year and a hal f ago, somet hi ng I i ke t hat.
Q Ch what case was t hat ?
A. WI I , I didn't work on the case so I get them-- I t hi nk t he name was Sherman.
Q And - -
(Interruption by recorded teleconference message)
IVR PAI GE: D d you hear t hat ?
IVB. LAW5CN: Wi hear d t hat.
THE WTNESS: Yes.
IVR MURPHY: Yeah.
(Dscussion off the record)
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Di d you read t he Schal I er deposition or testimony from the Hess case?
A. I bel i eve t hat was r i ght . I bel i eve t hat' s cor r ect.
Q So you read -- now, was it t he t r i al testimony or the deposition testimony or both?
A. 11 may wel I have been bot h. But t hat woul d go back -(Interruption by recorded teleconference message)
(Dscussion off the record)
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) And t hen what about on - -IVR PAIGE: You can hear me, right?
Page 8
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt
THE WTNESS: Yes. W)' re still here.
IVR PAIGE: Ckay.
THE WTNESS: No, we' re not . W) j ust I ost Ji m IVUr phy.
IVB. LAWSCN: Can we go of f the record for a nri nut e and get Ji m back? Off the record.
(Break from 9: 29 to 9:37)
(Discussion off the record)
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. So t he Schal I er t est i nrony that you looked at, as I understand it, was the deposition and trial for the Hess case. And the Lacy Ford was the deposition and trial testimony for the Sherman case. Is that correct?
IVB. LAWSON: Cbj ect to form
A. I don't recall reading the trial testimony or looking at t he t r i al testimony for the Sherman case. I
don't r ecal I doi ng t hat .
Q ( BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. Now, t he - - do you know M chael Schal I er? Do you know who he is?
A. I've met him two or three times. He's a historian at the University of Arizona.
Q And do you know who Lacy Ford is?
A. Yes. I ' ve don't know hi m very wel I , but we' re acquai nt ed.
Q And have you ever met wi t h M chael Schal I er on t obacco-r el at ed matters?
A. I bel i eve t here was one t i me, I ' m goi ng t o say back in 1998 or 1997, when he asked me i f I had certain documents. And I had those documents. Wiat they are at t hi s poi nt I have no i dea what was i nvol ved. But he came out and visited for a day and looked at those documents. But that was approximately 11 or 12 years ago.
Q And what about Lacy Ford, have you ever met with hi m on any t obacco-r el at ed matters?
A. Yes. Wien, when I was contacted about the Engle cases, the progeny cases, in June -- I'm sorry,
I ' m nri xi ng -- well, yes. It was late July of 2007. I asked, because I had not done very nruch work on Florida, where I nri ght begin to find materials, perhaps, which had already been done which would save me a I ot of time
in nry own research. I received the r ecormnendat i on to contact Lacy Ford. I made arrangements to go visit.
And I looked through his materials and copied some of his materials that related, historical materials, obviously, that related to tobacco awareness in Florida.
Q Q her than looking at the Sherman deposition of Lacy Ford, have you looked at any other of his deposi t i ons r ecentIy?
A. Not r ecent I y, no.
Q And the Schal I er and Lacy Ford testimony that you t ol d me about that you reviewed, both would have been in t he I ast coupl e weeks?
A. The depositions, yes. The testimony, the Hess t est i mony woul d have been a whi I e back. I don't know when that trial occurred. As I say, a year or two ago, somet hi ng I i ke t hat.
Q Ckay. Do you - - as a historian, do you find M chael Schal I er and Lacy Ford to be leading historians i n t he, i n t he i ndust ry?
A. They' r e bot h - -
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt
Q I n t he f i el d?
A. VVfel I , I woul d say yes. I think they're both very wel I-known and wel I - r espect ed historians, yes.
Q Do you find Lacy Ford t o be - - well, strike t hat .
You've gone to his office, you've looked at his materials, you've read his testimony. Do you find hi m t o be an authoritative source on the, i n t he topics of which you're going to testify on?
M3. LAWSCN: Object to form
A. I think he's done some very good research which I would give him great credit for. That would be the best -- that would be the way I would describe it. He's done some very good research. And it certainly helped me get st ar t ed i n t er ms of the Florida cases.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) But you don't consider hi m t o be aut hor i t at i ve?
A. That's a tough term for anybody to use because I know t hat it has legal i nrpl i cat i ons. So I prefer not t o use t hat t er m
Q Ckay. But so because there's legal i nrpl i cat i ons, you won't use that ternrf?
A. That's right. I'd say he's a very good historian and he's very thorough and that I respect that i n hi m
Q Ckay. So i f we could just step away from the word authoritative, you would agree that's he's -- well, you respect hi m and he is either the leading or one of the top leading historians, in your opinion, on this subj ect mat t er ?
A. He i s very wel I informed on the subject.
Q Do you consider hi m t o be one of the leading historians on this subject matter?
A. I would say he's very wel I informed on this subj ect .
Q So he's not one -- i s he or i s he not one of the leading historians?
A. It's a characterization --
Q If not, I ' m goi ng t o ask you who i s.
A. It's a characterization that is very, very difficult for me t o respond to because leading can mean lots of different things in lots of different si t uat i ons.
Q \Afel I , what do you t hi nk, what do you t hi nk it means?
A. Wiat I t hi nk i t means i s t hat he woul d be i n t he t op t wo or three or four or something like that.
Q Ckay. Yeah. That's what it means. So do you consider hi m t o be in the top two or three or four historians on the subject matter of public awareness of health hazards of smoking?
A. I doubt whether there are many people who are better informed than he i s on that subject. And I'm talking about the historical subject, obviously. Historical awareness.
Q Now, when you read -- okay. Wien you read his testimony and you read M chael Schaller's testimony, was there anything in there that you disagreed with and said hey - - wel I , st r i ke t hat.
Dd you take notes what you read their Page 10
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt
t est i rony?
A. No, I di d not .
Q D d you hi ghl i ght i t or make any not at i ons on t he deposi t i ons or - -
A. W)l I - -
Q -- transcripts you were provided?
A. I may have put a highlight or two in, but I didn't write anything down.
Q Ckay. And is there -- when you read the Lacy Ford deposition, was there anything that struck you as being inaccurate or untrue?
A. I didn't really read it from that point of view. I read it for informational purposes. I didn't consi der t hat.
Q \Afel I , was there any, was there any information that you saw i n his deposition that struck you as being i naccur at e or unt r ue?
A. I didn't, I didn't read it from that point of vi ew.
Q \Afel I , from what ever point of vi ew you were
reading it I just want to know, did you at any point say hey, this is not true or this is inaccurate?
A. \Afel I , it's very difficult for me t o say I did when I didn't read it from that point of view.
Q V\fel I , to be honest with you, I don't know what that means. I mean, if I read something, from any point of view, if something strikes me as a I i e, I don't know how I woul d j ust i gnore it. So I ' m aski ng you f rom whatever point of vi ew you think you read it from did anything strike you as being untrue that you recall?
A. I read a I ot of things from the point of view of the information that's available. And I don't try to eval uat e t hat i nf or mat i on at t he t i me I ' m r eadi ng i t from the point of vi ew of whether it's true or a lie.
Q \Afel I , was there information that you read that you felt was accurate?
A. I didn't evaluate it from that point of view.
I read that for the purposes of the information that was avai I abl e.
Q Ckay. I ' m goi ng to ask you this question.
Yes or no. And you tell me i f you can't answer this yes or no. Wien you read it for the informational purposes that you were reading it -- well, st r i ke t hat .
How I ong did you take reading Lacy Ford's
deposi t i on?
A. Wfel I , I read it very quickly. I've got to go back i n nry nri nd. I t hi nk i t was approximately 200 pages. The way I would read 200 pages like that might have been two to three hours maxi nrum IVfexi nrum
Q Ckay. Did you see -- okay. Wien you read it, were you conrprehendi ng what you were readi ng?
A. Wfel I , I hope so. I mean, I was reading it for i nf or mat i on.
Q D d you - -
A. And that's part of the conrpr ehensi on process.
Q -- understand it? Sure. And were you able to understand what you were reading?
A. I t hi nk I understood there was information there that I wanted to read.
Q Ckay. Wfere you confused at any point where you couldn't understand what was going on?
Page 11
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt
A. I'm not, I don't , I don't know how t o answer that because I read it, I read it for the information.
I don't t hi nk I was conf used.
Q Ckay. And what information were you reading it f or ?
A. I wanted to see the kinds of questions that were being raised and to get a general sense of what those questions were and what the issues were.
Q And were you also interested to see what the
answers were, or did you just read the questions?
A. I read both.
Q \Afel I , why were you reading the answers if you just wanted to see what the questions were?
A. Wfel I , I just wanted to see what the i nf or mat i on was.
Q \Afel I , you told me the reason you were reviewing it was you wanted to see what the questions were. So was there any other reason you were reviewing it other than to see what the questions were?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. I was reading it for the information. The questions and the answers would be part of that i nf or mat i on.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. So did you have any pr obi em under st andi ng Lacy Ford's answers t o t he quest i ons?
A. I don't think I had any problems understanding what was i n t he deposi t i on.
Q And did any, was there anything that you read i n hi s answer s st r i ke you as new i nf or mat i on t hat you didn't know already as an expert historian? Dd you I ear n anyt hi ng new?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. Wfel I , I didn't read it from that point of
view; but it's hard for me, it's hard for me t o evaluate, say yes or no, because I didn't read it from t he poi nt of vi ew of t r yi ng t o gat her new i nf or mat i on.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) So you di dn't, t here's not hi ng that you said hey, I never knew t hat and took note of that and recalled that?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. I -- I mean, again, I didn't read it from that point of view. But I can't recall anything along that I i ne.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. And was there anything i n M chael Schal I er' s - - wel I , st r i ke t hat .
Dd you read M chael Schaller's deposition and trial t est i nrony for the same informational purposes?
A. Yes. I was interested i n t he information that was, was i n t he Schal I er, both the deposition and trial testimony. Wth the trial testimony, it's so long ago that I read it, I don't remenrtoer, really remenrber anything about it. Wth respect t o t he deposition, I read it extremely quickly. Probably I spent less than two hours, maybe no more than an hour and a hal f with i t.
Q Ckay. It was about a four-hour deposition?
A. I don't recall. I t hi nk t he length, again,
was around 200 pages. But I, I do read -- I speed read
Page 12
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt a I ot of things. And I remenrber speed reading that deposi t i on.
Q And was there any -- were you able to conrprehend the deposition of M chael Schaller?
A. I cer t ai nl y - -
Q Dd you understand it?
A. I certainly -- I read that information. And hopefully I conrprehended it.
Q Ckay. As an expert historian was there -look, I know as a historian it's inrportant to read and r ead a Iot.
A. Ri ght .
Q And you're always looking to learn new things; is t hat cor r ect ?
A. \Afel I , t hat' s par t - -
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. That's part of nry occupation, is I'm interested i n t he past and I ' m I ooki ng for new information to better understand the past. That's part of nry j ob.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Ri ght. Ri ght. And you' re open if -- you're open to reading and to continue to read to continue to be educated and open to learning new i nf or mat i on and new i deas?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. Wfel I , I viasn't -- in those instances I was just looking for basic information.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) I ' m not t al ki ng about t hose i nst ances.
A. Ch.
Q I' m t al ki ng - -
A. I ' m sor r y.
Q - - a hi st or i an - -
A. Am I open t o new i nf or mat i on?
Q - - hi st or i ans - -
A. Yes. I do research all t he t i me.
Continuously. If there's enough time today I'll get some done before this evening. And that's new i nf or mat i on.
Q Ckay. Ri ght. And as a historian you read -historians in general do a I ot of reading?
A. That's -- yes. That's true.
Q And when you read M chael Schaller's deposi t i on, was t her e any new i nf or mat i on t hat you gleaned that you said to yourself I did not know t hat ?
A. I honestly don't recall.
Q That you r ecal I ?
A. I don't r ecal I .
Q You don't recall that occurring?
A. Wfel I , I read it so quickly it wasn't, it wasn't I i ke I was reading some detailed monograph on some totally new subj ect that I didn't know anyt hi ng about i n t he f i r st pi ace.
Q The M chael -- who gave you M chael Schaller's deposition and Lacy Ford's deposition?
A. The best of nry recollection, Jones Day supplied that material to me.
Q And are you going t o bi I I for reading those?
A. I believe I di d bi I I for them yes.
Q And in what case did you bill for reading t hose deposi t i ons?
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt A. I would say probably for Q i va, but one there may have been one other. But I don't want to -- I'll j ust say, I et me j ust say Q i va.
Q Ckay. So part of the reason for you reviewing the Lacy Ford deposition and the M chael Schal I er deposition was to help you, possibly, prepare for this deposi t i on?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form A. That may well have been one of the reasons.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) And I guess, I guess the thing that really started this whole line of questioning is kind of silly. But i n t he information that you read, didn't you notice that Lacy Ford and M chael Schal I er
both took note or both stated that the tobacco conrpani es did not publicly admit that cigarettes caused lung cancer and nicotine was addictive until t he I at e '90s or early 2000s? Did you, were you able to conrprehend that part of their testimony?
IVB. LAW5CN: Cbj ect to form A. I believe that information was there, yes.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. So before, when you told me you weren't aware of it, that wasn't really the t r ut h?
A. W)l I - -
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form A. -- I wasn't aware of it because I haven't done research on that particular issue. They may have said it, but I don't know whet her it's true or not.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. So you think Lacy Ford, who's one of the top two or three historians, who you respect and took the time to read his testimony, is i naccur at e on t hat ?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) You wouldn't just take his word f or it?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Same obj ect i on.
A. Wiat I would have to say to you is, i s t hat I ' m cer t ai nl y wi I I i ng to r ead what ot her peopl e have t o
say. But nry primary responsibility as an historian is that I have to go find the information nrysel f as best as I possi bl y can. And t hat i s nry basi c met hod of oper at i on.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) But somet i mes f or you to f i nd information it just takes going to Lacy Ford's office and taking his information.
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form A. V\fel I , it got me - -Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) - - done t hat ?
A. It got me started. And it was very good information. Newspaper documents, that sort of thing.
But I've made, I can't count them a nunrber of trips to Florida to seek further information on what's going on, historically speaking, in terms of the awareness issues and questions of difficulty of smoking. I've made any nunrber of t r i ps t o Florida. Five or six, approximately.
Q So t he fact that your research never revealed that to you, and your reading that in Lacy Ford's deposition, you didn't f i nd t hat t o be at least an interesting piece of information that you thought maybe you would look into if you were going to hold yourself out to be an expert ?
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. I have to go back to what I said before, and
that is that that information was in there, as I recall. IVkybe it was; maybe it wasn't. I can't say for sure. I don't, it doesn't stand out in nry nri nd.
But as I ' ve t r i ed t o indicate to you already with respect t o t hat, with respect t o t he question you're asking, I have not researched that par t i cul ar quest i on.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) You received our subpoena, correct? Cr the notice, notice of duces t ecum of what you're supposed to bring to the depo?
A. \Afel I , yes. Yes, I di d. I mean, I ' ve seen t hat document.

A. Sure.

A. Ckay. Wfe're going to get all the material.

Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) You brought your CV?
A. I brought the CV updated to last -- I update i t once a year. The I ast - - I'll updat e i t agai n i n another couple of months. I brought --
Q Ckay.
A. --the various depositions, conrplaints, interrogatories with respect to the Q i va case. I brought nry disclosure statement. I brought -- I ' m j ust going to go through this as fast as I can for you.
I brought materials -- I teach a course whi ch wi I I st art, act ual I y, i n a week and a hal f cal I ed Addiction and Disease i n t he American Experience. And one of the subject areas, we look at drinking, we look at smoking, we look at hard drugs. I brought a handout that's a senri nar on the undergraduate level handout about the changing nature of defining addiction over four centuries. I brought that document.
I brought a Supreme Court of Texas case which references Drinking in America as an authoritative work on matters of drinking and cormrDn knowledge. I brought four book reviews that I've written about books
dealing with smoking. I brought an analysis of the Honolulu Star Bulletin, January 1964. A cont ent analysis of who said what. I brought copies of nry notes that I took from the interrogatories and on some of the depositions. Those notes are here for you.
I brought a sheet which gives you the nunrber of hours through Decenrtoer that I worked on this case and gives you the exact figures I was trying to
Page 15
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt recall. I can see I was off a couple thousand up and down, but that information is here for you.
I brought you articles about -- excuse me -- Hunrphrey Bogart because he was associated with smoking and M". Q i va mentioned that he was a f an of Hunrphrey Bogart.
I brought you new material from the European Stars and Stripes. And that material is from 1972 and 1973 when M. Q i va was i n Europe. He sai d he did read, he mentioned that i n hi s deposition, Stars and St r i pes.
I brought you notes that I have put together on the Hawaii laws, codes, statutes, and t ext books havi ng to do wi t h educat i on about t obacco issues. I brought you an i t em the Honolulu Star Bulletin, 1950, 1968 of articles that I specifically went to the Library of Congress and reviewed to make
sure that they were as accurate as possible. I mean, I wanted to see the actual articles.
I brought you statements for the last six months that include all of nry Q i va hours.
I brought you a series of e-mails that you requested -- there aren't many -- about conrmjni cat i ons about -- if I ' m not nristaken, these are primarily conrmjni cat i ons with lawyers. You had asked f or t hat.
And t hen I al so i ncl uded some Gal I up polls that I received from a researcher who is helping me in another case. That person, that researcher is in Chicago and is a professional researcher.
And in addition I brought you nry reliance list -- and I believe you have a copy of that -- the CDs containing the documents.
And apparently we've got -- oh, here are all of -- I take it this, what I have here are copies of nry - - I don't have these nrysel f -- but copies of nry deposition dated August 19th, 2003 i n t he Turner Lights case i n I I I i noi s.

A. The Fal i se trial was held in Federal court in 2001. Fal i se, F- a-1 - i - s- e.

A. Cut side of the historians? I s t hat -- do you mean I i ke - - I've never e-mailed students. I've never e-mailed colleagues. The only, the only person that I -- there are e-mail exchanges when I was working on the case, the Gel ep case, G-e-l-e-p. There was somewhat of a rush, and I asked to get assistance. And I received some assistance from a research firm in Chicago. Public, public historian, Terry Fife. And there are e-mails about that in here.

A. Ckay. That' s F- i - f - e.
Q Now, tell me - - I know you brought some of -you mentioned, I t r i ed t o wr i t e nry not es as you were talking. But you brought some course materials. You're teaching a course that has to do with addiction; is that cor r ect ?
A. Yes. The history of addiction. History of addiction and disease. It is a senior level seminar.
Wfe have what we call capstone courses. And the first handout t hat I gi ve t hem i s about t he quest i on of t he changing nature of definitions of addiction over, I'd say, a four-century period going back to King James the Fi r st.

Q Tel I me t he required reading.
A. There are -- I ' m j ust t r yi ng t o t hi nk. In terms of t he - - we I I , this document I brought is required reading because it's the basis of a discussion we have. But in addition, there is, w do drinking; and we use nry Drinking in America book. There is a book by Eric Burnes on tobacco that I've adopted this, for this course. In terms of, in terms of hard drugs, there's a book by Vteyne Morgan. The t i 11 e of that is actually something like Drugs in America. And then I have --

Q Is there any required reading on tobacco and ni cot i ne?
A. \Afel I , t he book that I use, that I'm usi ng this semester is a book by Eric Burnes, B-u-r-n-e-s. I'm trying to remenrber t he t i 11 e. I read so many different things I don't remenrber the titles very wel I . But it's a history that is, was published within the last five year s.
Q How di d you come to pick that book?
A. \Afel I , there were -- actually, the books aren't very good on the subject from nry point of view But this is, I would describe, one of the better ones of what I wduI d generally say are not very good books.
I also select books very nruch in their readability these days because one of the challenges that we all face at the college level is getting students to read. And Burnes is a popular writer; and, therefore, the prose is certainly nruch easier for students to handle, for today's students to handle than, let's say, something that's been a more learned tome, if I coul d put it t hat way.
Q And I'msorry. Again, what i s t he name of t hat cour se?
A. 11' s I i st ed as Addi ct i on and Di sease i n t he American Experience. It's a t opi cal course which we are
required -- our seniors are required to take a topical course whi ch wi I I get t hem i nvol ved i n doi ng pr i mary historical research and writing serious research papers. And so what we do i s we pi ck topics. The topic nri ght be slavery or the progressive movement or the women's movement. And since I have done a I ot of work in those areas, I decided t o put this course together. And it's a senri nar. Wfe sit around a table, and we discuss the issues. \Afe t al k about doing research. And ultimately the students go off and write research papers based on pr i mar y r esear ch.

A. Not beyond the book reviews. No, I haven't published any books or articles.
Q Do you teach any other courses about cigarettes or nicotine other than the one that you just t ol d me about ?
A. No. I do not .
Q And have you ever before that course taught any other courses on the history of cigarettes or ni cot i ne?
A. V\fel I , t he course is about more than just -it's about smoking and drinking and hard drugs. But
except working some material into survey history courses and that sort of thing, the answer would be no.
Q Have you ever submitted a grant proposal?
A. No. No, I haven't.
Q Have you ever, have you ever received any type of grant from any organization?
A. Yes. Back in-- and we' re goi ng back a I ong way now. Back i n t he nri d - - no. I'm sorry. Back in the - - no, it was i n the 1970s. The person I worked wi t h on t he Dr i nki ng in Amer i ca book, a f or mer gr aduat e student, and I subnritted a proposal t o t he National Endowment for the Humanities t o do a series of scripts on the history of drinking in America that would be PBS programs. V\fe di d it in conjunction with New Jersey Public Television. Wfe received one grant, and we were funded to write the scripts. The scripts were written.
I don't remenrber the name of the man who we brought in to write them I could look that up if you need it.
Wfe then went back for additional money to get preproduction work done; and we were turned down for that, which is quite characteristic of the NEH. And we never went back.
That's the only grant that would have, that I can think of except for an individual fellowship or something like that which would be irrelevant to your
quest i on, I t hi nk.
Q Ckay. Have you ever received a grant from or submitted a grant proposal to NI DA or the National Cancer I nst i t ut e or anybody i nvol ved wi t h, I i ke, i ssues involved with cigarettes or nicotine?
A. No, I haven't .
Q Look at your reliance list and your reliance materials. You included on them New York Times and other national publications. Do you recall that?
A. Yes, I do.
Q Wiy di d you i ncl ude t he New York Ti mes on your r el i ance list f or M". Q i va who di d not I i ve in New Yor k?
A. V\fel I , t he New Yor k Ti mes - - we I I , I t hi nk until recently was considered -- I don't t hi nk i t is anymore -- a newspaper of national record. That would be one reason, if there is a national newspaper. It's distributed throughout the United States. I mean, I could get i t at nry home if I wanted to in the morning her e i n Houst on.
A second reason is that the New York Times news service, a nunrber of those articles would be
Page 21
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt picked up by regional and local newspapers just like the AP or t he UPI woul d make st or i es avai I abl e. And it is, it goes back, I think, also to that matter of it being
recognized, at least until recently, as a major national paper. It's part of the overall --Q \Afel I , what -A. -- information base that's available.
Q But what does t hat mean i t was t he newspaper of national record? How does that relate to M". Q i va?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. \Afel I , what I can tell you is there is an incredible amount of information out there. It's on the national level. It's on the regional level. It's on the local level. And I t hi nk i t' s inrportant -- after all, as a historian I work in context. And the historical context is there's been an overwhel nri ng amount of information available on the subject of smoking, questions of the health consequences of smoking, and also on questions of the difficulties of quitting smoking or addiction.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) You know, it's funny because I've heard historians talk about the New York Times as being the newspaper of national record. And I never, to be honest with you, I never really understood what that meant. But hearing you tell me about it I think what it means is, if I ' m not nristaken, is like now we have -you have the USA Today, which is a national paper. And that's a paper that covers, it's covered nationally. So
I guess back before we had the USA Today you would have, like, the New York Times. And even though it's titled the New York Times, it was really a national paper that was received everywhere; is that correct --
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) -- or not? Q am I wrong?
A. ivy understanding is that if I -- when I was growing up, I grew up in northern Chi o, I could have gotten the New York Times and nry parents could have got t en t he New Yor k Ti mes on a dai I y basi s. I can get it here in Houston on a daily basis. I choose not to. And that it's available all over the country. I guess that's part of being a national newspaper.
You're right, the USA Today is a national newspaper. But one of the differences i s t he USA Today i s not a distributor of major national news stories to other regional and local newspapers, so far as I know, whereas the New York Times is.
So part of it is journalists go to the
New Yor k Ti mes.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Ckay. So t hey' re bot h - - t he USA Today and the New York Times, I guess, are distributed nationally. But the USA Today is not really a wi r e ser vice like t he New Yor k Ti mes - -
A. That's nry understanding of the situation.
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Now, you have other papers in there. You have the M anri Herald. You have papers in Tal I ahassee, Pensacol a, Wfest Pal m Beach. Jacksonvi I I e, obviously. Cbvi ousl y, when you get t o t r i al I'm assunri ng you're really goi ng to concentrate your testimony on the papers i n t he areas where he lived and
Page 22
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt some of the national publications on your reliance list. Is that more or less of what you intend to do?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. It's very difficult for me t o answer at this point in time. Those papers -- the Florida papers have been included because they're part of a story i n t he st at e of FI or i da whi ch ar e an i ndi cat i on of how widespread this information was. So, yes, I may draw upon that information in nry testimony. I can't say for sure because I don't know exact I y what additional i nf or mat i on is goi ng t o become avai I abl e so I ' m not i n a position to really answer that.
Certainly, too, I would want to present material that was more directly r el at ed t o M". Q i va before he moved to Florida, I believe, in approximately nri d 1980s.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Now, do you agree that advertisements also help to shape public opinions and
bel i ef s?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form
A. Advertisements are out there, and they're available. But as a source, one of the things that historians do -- and I presume the general public does it, t oo - - we evaluate documents as to their relative merit and relative worth. And with respect to advertisements it's pretty wel I known that we, we approach advertisements from a very skeptical point of vi ew because we r eal i ze peopl e ar e t r yi ng t o sel I us something. And so it makes it a little more difficult to take advertisements literally or seriously in conrparison -- and that's a key point -- to, let's say, the headlines that appear in newspapers.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) R ght. But do you have any speci al i t y in mar ket i ng?
A. I've not been trained in marketing, no.
Q Che of the things that you probably know of marketing is if you, if you advertise one time, it probably doesn't do anything. So advertisers are told to advertise over and over and over and over and over agai n and t hen peopl e wi I I st art to buy t hei r product . Are you f anri I i ar wi t h t hat type of branding or adver t i si ng met hod?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form
A. I ' m not a marketing expert so I can't really address that particular issue.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) \Afel I , do you know what weight -- do you give the advertisements any weight at al I in shapi ng publ i c opi ni ons and publ i c bel i ef s?
A. \Afel I , advertisements are there. They're part of the public record. But in terms of weight, based on everything I've read about public awareness with respect to advertising, they're not given the same weight as, let's say, mainline news stories, television stories, what Wil t er Cronkite or other majors reporters had to say on television. They're si nrpl y not given the same weight. There is some evidence to that effect.
And let me add that as I read M". Q i va's deposi t i on, he made i t cl ear at I east one pi ace i f not more that he didn't pay any attention to advertisements. So t hat woul d al so af f ect how I nri ght eval uat e t hem as it relates to hi m per sonal I y.
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ri ght. Ckay. You brought three interesting things. Nunrber one, there are headl i nes on your rel i ance I i st t hat you know M". Q i va didn't read. So obviously he didn't rely upon those, either. But it's part of the general information to shape public opinions in general, correct?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form
A. W)l I - -
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) He didn't read everything on your r el i ance I i st ?
IVR MURPHY: Cbj ect to form
A. No. But he did - -
IVB. LAV\8CN: Same obj ect i on.
A. - - i ndi cat e - -
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Did he read everything on your r el i ance list?
A. D d he read everything -- let me try to attenrpt to answer that. He di d indicate that he read the Guam Dai I y News. He mentioned that. He mentioned Honolulu Star Bulletin. And he also mentioned Stars and Stripes from the several years that he was i n t he military both in the European and i n t he Asian theaters. So he did indicate that he read those.
Q Can you answer nry quest i on? Can you answer nry quest i on?
A. I j ust - -
Q Wiy don't you answer nry question first. Dd he read everything on your reliance list?
A. Dd he r ead - -
Q -- everything on your reliance list?
A. I have no idea what he read.
Q Ckay. Thank you. Now, did he rely upon
everything on your reliance list?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form
A. Based on his, based on his statements, he didn't seem t o rely on this kind of information. That doesn't mean the information wasn't out there and readily available to hi m ever ywher e he went across the gl obe.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. I\ty understanding is a lot of times historians, I ' m assunri ng yourself, you put things on your reliance list that not only the person reads and the person relies upon but what also his f anri I y menrbers, his friends and colleagues may also read and rely upon because that's part of his, part of, you know, where he's going to get information from Is that cor r ect ?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form
A. I ' m not sure howto answer that particular question. Wiat I can tell you is there is an absolute tidal wave of information that is out there. And wherever he went, whether he was in school or whether he was in the military, whether he was i n hi s various locations occupationally as he moved across the country, this information, wherever he was, was out there and available t o hi m That's what I can tell you.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. Let me - - okay. So
let's go back to what I was asking before. And I discussed it with Lacy Ford. You may have seen it in his deposition, and you may di f f er wi t h hi m If you do,

t hat' s f i ne.
Do you agree that advertisements -- I'm not aski ng you what you wei ght. \Afel I , I wi I I ask you what wei ght because you sai d t hat act ual I y t he wei ght given is different. But I want to know, do you agree that advertisements help shape public beliefs; or do you not know because you're not a marketing expert?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. \Afel I , I t hi nk we've already agreed t o t he answer of the second question. I ' m not a marketing expert. Wiat I do understand is that advertisements are out there and available. But as I've already indicated in terms of evaluating them they're not as significant a source of information as many other types of information are out there and available.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Do you think -A. From the historian's perspective.
Q -- advertisements hel p - - I really still haven't understood your answer. Do you believe that advertisements help shape public beliefs on this topic?
A. \Afel I , you j ust j unrped i nt o t he bel i ef category; and I'm presented as an awareness expert. So
you' re aski ng me a quest i on t hat I'm not real I y prepared to answer when you bring up the belief issue.
Q Ckay. You understand there's a difference between being aware of something or knowing something and believing it, correct?
A. R ght . I certainly do. If you're not aware, you can't bel i eve.
Q Ckay. But just because you are aware doesn't mean that you do believe, correct?
A. \Afel I , you have -- people make choices. That's the way, that's the way people are. Wfe all make choices. But it's based on awareness.
Q Actually, that's not, that's not true. Are you a psychologist or a psychiatrist?
A. I'm a cormrDn- knowl edge person. And yes, people do make choices. And I'll stand by that statement. I don't have t o be a psychologist to make t hat st at ement.
Q No, no. But you have to answer nry questions.
I asked you, are you a psychologist or a psychiatrist?
A. Of cour se not .
Q Ckay. So t hen nry ot her quest i on was di d you know t hat just because somebody is aware of something doesn't necessarily mean that they believe it?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Do you know t hat ? Have you ever hear d of t hat ?
A. I think that I ' m not supposed to know t hat based on what you j ust sai d because I' m not a psychologist or whatever else, a psychiatrist.
Q Ckay. So you don't know t he answer to that?
A. I do know t he answer to that. You ruled me out on i t , so I can't speak to it.
Q Ckay. If you can't speak to it, t hat' s f i ne. And you know - -
A. I can't speak to it because you ruled me out.
Q Ckay. That's fine. Do you think that, do you t hi nk t hat if I ask you a question you're now disqualified f r om answer i ng something that you might

IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. V\fel I , I sai d i f it was a cormrDnsense statement t hat you sai d you woul dn't accept a cormrDnsense statement. You ruled me out on i t , so I don't knowhow I can answer t o i t .
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Have you ever heard that just because somebody heard something doesn't mean that they bel i eve i t ?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) \Afel I , I et me st r i ke t hat.
A. I believe I indicated that I did. And then you asked me whet her I was a psychol ogi st or psychiatrist. So you ruled me out.
Q (BY IVR. PAI GE) Wfel I - -
A. You said -- no. I would assume, I ' m assunri ng that you indicated that I had t o be a psychologist or a psychiatrist in order to know t hat . Wiereas I sai d i t' s a cormrDnsense assunrpt i on on nry part as a historian.
Q Ckay. Ckay. Look, whether, whether I feel that you're answer really exhibited that you're using your cormrDn sense or not, we'll agree to differ on t hat.
But I just want to ask you, nry question t o you is, wi t hout you bei ng a wi se guy, i s do you, have you heard -- or strike that.
Do you know t hat j ust because somebody hears something dos not necessarily mean they believe i t ?

IVB. LAV\8CN: No.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Do you know t hat just because somebody hears something -- if you don't know, you don't know. I'll rephrase it this way.
Have you heard or learned that just because somebody hears something that doesn't necessarily mean they believe it?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form Q (BY IVR. PAI GE) Do you know t hat, or do you not know t hat ?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form A. I'm awar e t hat bel i ef foil ows awar eness.
That' s what I ' m aware of. And some peopl e may bel i eve, and some peopl e may not bel i eve. That' s what I ' m aware of.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Ckay. AI I r i ght. Bel i ef follows awareness, but it doesn't necessarily -- belief doesn't always f ol I ow awar eness, correct?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form A. I don't know how you coul d bel i eve somet hi ng if you weren't aware of it. That's just basic logic.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. So what's the answer to nry quest i on, t hen, yes or no?
A. Wiat is your question? Please repeat it for
me.
Q Di dn't you just hear me ask -Just because somebody hears something doesn't necessarily mean they believe it, correct?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. That's one of many possibilities out there,
yes.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Have you learned that as an exper t ?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form
A. I didn't need to learn that as an expert. I learned that as a human being. Its called cormrDn sense.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. Perfect. So you know that you're not an expert on belief, but you're an expert on awareness or -- awareness, not belief, cor r ect ?
A. I was - -

A. To go back over it, I was presented as an expert and am bei ng presented as an expert on awareness.
I ' m not being presented as an expert on belief. As you pointed out, that gets into psychology and psychiatry.
Q (BY IVR. PAI GE) Wfel I - -
A. Wii ch I ' m not an expert.
Q And do you agree there's a I ot of reasons, there's a I ot of reasons other than choice why people
may hear somet hi ng and bel i eve i t or not bel i eve it? It doesn't just come down to a si nrpl e choice by a person; there's more involved, a lot more involved than that, isn't t her e?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form
A. \Afel I , you' r e get ting i nt o an ar ea t hat it's very difficult for me t o cormnent on because that's going to vary with every individual out there so far as I know.

A. But you're asking me, you're asking whether I believe people can make choices. And the answer to that i s yes.
Q I didn't hear what you said. Can you -- you said something and you cut off. And I asked you a question, and you then answered something else.

A. Wfel I , I suppose it does. But that has to do with belief; and I ' m not, have not been presented as a bel i ef exper t.

IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. I ' m not sure howto answer that kind of a
question because i t' s st i I I on t he bel i ef side of the equation. And what I've tried to indicate to you is that people have to have information available for them before they can believe something. That's, that's what I ' ve sai d r epeat edl y.

IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. I can't tell you whet her i t says t hat or not. Wiat I can tell you is that C.

A. I ' m guessi ng it was 1999, 2000. I can't say for sure.

IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt public at particular points in time, yes, I've been interested in that. But those documents did not become available until the year 2000 -- I t hi nk we can agree on that particular year. So i t' s not a mat t er of that information being available to somebody in 1950 or 1960 or 1970. It wasn't there. So it could not affect public awareness in those years and decades.

Q And tel I me about how many hours you spent i n those four years looking through the tobacco archives.
A. About how many hours? I don't have the slightest idea. So I don't really want to just toss out a nunrber. I think that would be inappropriate.

A. Ri ght .
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. If that material was i n t he public record, I cert ai nl y saw it f rom t hat perspect i ve and t hat poi nt of view. And I may well have gone and looked for other kinds of things. But at this point, we're talking about years ago; and I can't, can't be any more specific than t hat .
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Have you ever read any articles written by Dr. Proctor?
A. Yes. I've read one article. That I recall.
Q And, and for what purpose?
A. V\fel I , it was an art i cl e t hat, as I recal I , it
appeared in a journal called Tobacco Control. It came out wi t hi n t he I ast f i ve years, f i ve years or so. I'm guessing at that. And it was a article in which he said that everyone should know t hat smoking isn't good for peopl e, basi cal I y. And t hat, t hat was what he was t al ki ng about.
Q Wiat is Tobacco Control?
A. It is a non-acadenri c journal that is sponsored by anti -tobacco advocacy groups.
Q And what -- do you receive that journal?
A. It's readily available on the Internet.
Q Do you subscr i be - -
A. No. Do I buy it personally? No.
Q Ckay. And how i s it that you came to read Dr. Pr oct or' s ar t i cl e?
A. I can't honestly recall.
Q And what about have you read any articles by Dr. Kyriakoudes?
A. Yes. I read an article that I believe was a Tobacco Control article. That came out three or four years ago. I ' m guessi ng at these dates. And I found it on the Internet, and I read it. Yes. It had to do with his opinions on expert witnessing, if I recall cor r ectIy.
Q Wio's Allan Brandt?
A. Allan Brandt is a historian, medical historian, affiliated with Harvard University.
Q Ckay. He contributed to some of the surgeon general reports?
A. ivy understanding is yes, he did.
Q And will you agree that he is either the leading or one of the top two or three leading historians on tobacco and cigarettes?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form
A. I wouldn't agree to that ever.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) You don't consi der hi m to be a leading, respectful historian?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form

Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Do you, do you respect his wor k?
A. No, I do not.
Q Do you know why Lacy Ford, who you consider to
Page 35
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt be a leading historian, said that he respects the work of Al I an Br andt ?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. I don't know whet her Lacy Ford said that or not. I have no i dea.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Do you have -- have you read any of Allan Brandt's work?
A. Yes, I have.
Q And for what purpose?
A. Wfel I , I was asked t o do a book review by the Journal of Social History of his most recent book on -whatever the title is, The Cigarette Century, I believe is the title, something like that. And I've read a couple of articles that he's written. I think his earlier work was somewhat better than his current work.
Q And what about Stan Qantz, who is he?
A. He's a i ndi vi dual in Cal i f or ni a who i s a leading anti-tobacco advocate. And I ' m not sure what hi s degree i s i n. He's ei t her a soci ol ogi st or a soci al worker. That's -- I ' m guessi ng at that. Che of those ar eas.
Q And do you consider him to be a leading authority on cigarettes and tobacco knowledge?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form
A. I ' ve I ooked at one book t hat he hel ped put together. And the thrust of that book was very mjch that smoking is bad for people and they should quit. So that's part of the body of information out there available to people that smoking isn't good for their heal t h.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) And that's part of the materials that you've reviewed and relied upon to form your opi ni ons?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form
A. I don't think that's on nry reliance list. I don't know. But I di d I ook at t he book a whi I e ago. Because I ' m i nt erest ed i n what' s conri ng out on t he subj ect .
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) I spoke t o Dr. Ford about this yesterday. And, you know, basically what he told me and which I tend to agree wi t h i s that, you know, you started out in college at some point and you got t o t he point where you are today. And for you to include every single book or paper or textbook or study that you've relied upon to come to your conclusions or opinions would be virtually i nrpossi bl e. Do you agree with that?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form
A. I t hi nk t hat if I t r i ed t o put everything out there, I've got -- t o gi ve you an indication -- over 200 linear feet of information, documents in nry little office in Wfest Houston. I have to store it somewhere.
I don't think you'd want al I of t hat because t hi s particular document, the reliance list, would probably have 50 to 100,000 items on it instead of whatever the total nunrber is, 5000 and change.
Q (BY IVR. PAI GE) Do you have a I i brary at home that you keep your information in?
A. Yes. I have a I ot of books. But I have them in nry office on canrpus. I have in nry little hideout office that I mentioned. I have books at home. I have

A. I t hi nk i t was Amazon. But they charged me about 30 or 40 bucks.
Q All right. Just I i ke me. W both get char ged.
A. Isn't that amazing? But I bought it. Yes.
Q Wiat about t he - - well, for what purpose did you order and read that book?
A. WI I , I was very interested i n t he documents that were in there. Some of the documents, for instance, have to do with, of a particular interest of rri ne, had to do wi t h smoki ng in t he movi es and t he presentation of smoking i n t he movies. And so I was interested in that section in particular. That one does st and out.
Q Wat about Ashes to Ashes? Dd you read that book?
A. I've read virtually all of that book. I can't say I've read every page. It's not particularly short. It's Kluger's book. I s t hat --

A. \Afel I , I'll try.
Q Ckay. Ashes to Ashes, who gave you that book?
A. I bought t he book.
Q And for what purpose did you read that book?
A. Because I, because I wanted to know what the content of that book, what it had in it and what nri ght be relevant t o t he awareness story.
Q And have you read any other tobacco -- did you read, for exanrpl e, a book titled Tobacco, A Culture and History and How an Exotic Plant Seduced Ci vi I i zat i on?
Did you read that book as well?

A. Ian Gat el y, G-a-t-e-l-y or something like t hat .
Q And why did you read that book?
A. Because it was on the subject of tobacco. And I actually, in years past, I've used that particular book, because there's a paperback edi t i on of it, i n nry addiction and disease class. The students hate the
book. So I had to try to find something else. It's just not an easy book to read.

Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) You know, i f you can j ust t el I me, I'm not goi ng t o ask you a whol e ser i es of questions. IVfey be you can just tell me i n your words -I guess what I ' m I ooki ng for is, like, the story about how we got f r orri, from a historical perspective, how we came f r om how peopl e wer e snroki ng ci gar et t es in t he 1800s t o t he 1950s. Do you know what I ' m t al ki ng about or no?
A. Ri ght . Yes. That general time period.
Q Ckay. Can you - -
A. Ri ght . I mean, I can give you a quick -Page 38
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt Q --in general people -A. Ri ght . I won't go on. But --Q Yeah. That's what I -A. --really around the year 1880, a conrbi nat i on of James B. Duke and I bel i eve hi s name i s James Bonsack -- and I believe it's B-o-n-s-a-c-k -- who perfected a ci gar et t e- r ol I i ng machine so you can produce cigarettes by the thousands, literally, on a daily basis. The two of t hem came together. And that was, really, the beginning of the nroder n cigarette industry as we woul d know i t. And t hat i t cont i nued to grow modestly at various points of times. And there were other points in time when the amount of cigarette smoking did increase significantly as part of American cul t ur e.
And t he t wo most significant -- well, there are -- let me gi ve - - I'll just very briefly identify certain factors, very briefly, three or four.
Urbanization is an important factor. People living in urban settings, moved, crowded together, didn't quite as, have as nruch time. And that woul d go wi t h t he whol e i ndust r i al i zat i on movement and the short smoke as opposed t o t he long cigar.
Certainly W)rld Wir I had an influence in
terms of smoking and troops.
And then, certainly, the women's movement f ol I owi ng t he r i ght t o vot e i n 1920 was al so a f act or. And more and more women began to smoke during the 1920s.
And so that it went from a period where, rough nunrbers, a small percentage of people smoked cigarettes to, by about 1950, I think that was one of the peak periods. It nri ght have been close t o hal f the population. But that would be broken up by various demographic groups, the latter figure. In other words, more men than women smoking.
Q Ckay. Ckay. So it would be at the turn of the century, smoking was not very popular for a variety of reasons. And then we had the invention of the Bonsack, Bonsack machine -- or by Bonsack?
A. Bonsack.
Q Ckay.
A. Bonsack, I bel i eve it is.
Q -- machine and also the fluke shearing as wel I , cor r ect ?
A. I -- fluke shearing I don't know a lot about. I'm certainly not an expert in growing tobacco. So I don't know. You need --
Q Ckay. \Afel I , before the 1900s, back into the 1800s, cigarettes were not as i nhal abl e because they
hadn't yet done the fluke shearing. And once they began fluke shearing, they became more i nhal abl e. And then we had the Bonsack machine. And then we got to the -A. Ri ght .
Q -- to the turn of the century where -A. That may be true or not. I really don't know anything about the agricultural side of tobacco.
I should have, I forgot to mention another element. And that i s t he safety match. The invention of the safety match is also very, very inrportant so that you could light the product more quickly. And that also facilitated the, say, the
Page 39
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt movement away from pipes and cigars toward cigarettes. The saf et y mat ch.
Q Do you know, do you know t he percentage roughly, the approximate percentage of adults who smoked in, I i ke, 1900?
A. The approximate percentage? No, I couldn't give you -- I don't want to give you a nunrber because I,
I ' m not sur e.
Q Ckay. But before, before the Bonsack machine and before the turn of the century, we could agree it was a very low nunrber of percentages of the people who smoked i n Amer i ca?
A. I would think that's correct, yes. It was not
a I ar ge nunrber.
Q And then the third -- and then in 1913 is when they began mass marketing the Camel cigarette, correct?
A. I n t er ms of - - I can't give you a specific date. But in terms of standard brand development, that does occur roughly between 1910 and 1921, of which would have been -- which one did you say? I'm sorry.
Lucki es?
Q I sai d Camel s.
A. Ch, Camel s.
Q Wfe have - -
A. \Afel I , Camels, Luckies, Chesterfield. I'm sor r y.
Q Ckay. So we have, we have W>r I d Wir I. And then we have between 1910 and 1920, the mass marketing of cigarettes is taking place along with the urbanization and other factors you mentioned. And that helped, they all helped in their various ways to contribute to the rise in usage of cigarettes, correct?
A. \Afel I , certainly some of t hem di d. Yes, that's cor r ect.
Q Ckay. Do you think any of the factors did not contribute to the rise in cigarette usage in America?
A. V\fel I, I think -- that's a good quest ion. I'm not sure howto answer it. I think different factors
may have contributed in different ways.
Q Ri ght . But, I mean, they all contributed in t hei r own way, obvi ousl y?
A. Somewhat . Dependi ng.
Q And then -- all right. Depending on what?
A. Wfel I , we'd have to go, we'd have to evaluate the particular factors at particular times at particular I ocat i ons.
Q Ckay. And then for a variety of factors, we have in 1950, I t hi nk i t was half of the, roughly half of t he adul t s in Amer i ca wer e smoki ng, cor r ect ?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form
A. I can't give you an exact figure. But I'd say roughly -- but I will qualify it by saying that generally speaking more men than women smoked. In 1950.
Q (BY IVR. PAI GE) I think you sai d, I thi nk you sai d - -
A. But if you averaged it out, if you average it out, it would be - - if you use an average, it would be ar ound 50 per cent.
Q R ght . And in fact in 19 -- in 1950 it was approximately 60 percent of doctors in America smoked, cor r ect ?
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt
A. In what year? I'm sorry. In 1950?
Q 1950.
A. I don't have a specific figure on that.
Q Ckay. Have you, in your review of the historical data, have you ever learned that there was a poi nt i n t i me where 60 percent of t he physi ci ans i n Amer i ca smoked?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form
A. I haven't seen material on that. I've seen material on canrpai gns such as the canrpai gn in Florida to encourage doctors not to smoke. But I don't have a specific figure like 60 percent or whatever it rri ght be.
I haven't seen t hat.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Ri ght. The canrpai gn t o discourage doctors from smoking occurred in the late '50s and into the '60s, correct?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. I believe that's correct. Yes.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. And what percentage of men smoked in 1950, then?
A. Again, that's a guess. But it would be slightly more than 50 percent if -- for women it was, women were -- I think women were, like, one in three or maybe 35, 40 percent, something like that. These are rough nunrber s. I can't give t hem t o you exactly. I mean, I could if we went through all the documents. But I don't, don't have them off t he t op of nry head for you.
Q But i n t he reliance materials that you have and the books that you've read, you've never learned that i n t he 1950s it was 60 percent of physicians were smoki ng?
A. I can't confirm that nunrber without really goi ng back and I ooki ng. It's not somet hi ng t hat is stuck in nry brain today.
Q Ckay. And then tell me about, historically, the rise in lung cancer in America.
A. \Afel I , that story is very, I think very wel I documented. I can present it this way to you very quickly. There was a M nnesot a pathologist by the name of Moses Baron, as I recall. I t hi nk i t' s B-a-r - o-n.
And around 1920, he was noticing as he was doing autopsies a I ot of people were corri ng in with fried lungs, if I can put it that way. And he would see --

'	THE WTNESS: I'll try. Except I ' ve got
Page 41
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt the table in the way. That's the problem
IVR PAIGE: Ckay.
A. There was -- I mentioned a M nnesot a pathologist by the name of MDses Baron. And he started to notice there was an increase in, when he was doing autopsies in lung cancer cases, he noted that. And that is one of the early signs that lung cancer was on the i ncr ease.
And then, in turn, the other story I remenrber i s t hat a doctor by the name of Alton Cchsner,
O-c-h-s-n-e-r. And he talked about how he, when he was in medical school -- and he was in medical school, I believe, i n t he 1920s -- that they actually were doing an aut opsy and t hey cal I ed al I t he medi cal st udent s together because they hadn't seen lung cancer before.
So that's sort of the beginning. And then the nunrber is going to begin to increase i n t he 1930s. And
Dr. Cchsner and Dr. M chael DeBakey -- who ends up in Houston. And let's see, the first successful, I guess, lung operation based on lung cancer was -- I've got to go through nry I i st here -- was Dr. Graham And that was i n t he 1930s. And so it started to - - the lung cancer cases started to increase and started to become more visible to the point that epi denri ol ogi cal work began in t he 1940s.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. And when did, when did t he - - I guess there was a poi nt i n t i me when there was ultimately a scientific consensus that cigarette smoking was causing or contributing to the rise in lung cancer, cor r ect ?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form A. There was a poi nt i n t i me when i t was cont r i but i ng to...
Q (BY IVR. PAI GE) Are you - -A. Are you talking about -- well, there's a medical scientific debate i n t he 1950s into the 1960s about the validity of epi denri ol ogi cal research which is a relatively new t ool in questions about statistical associations and how nruch you can derive from them But in terms of, in terms of public awareness, there's quite a high level of public awareness with respect to lung cancer and smoking that is developing i n t he 1950s. As
these studies are reported i n t he newspapers and i n t he news media more generally.
Q R ght . As I understand it, there was -- lung cancer, like you said, i n t he 1920s they were bringing i n medi cal st udent s because t hey had never seen I ung cancer. And i n t he early 1900s it was extremely rare. And over time, we were getting a rise in lung cancer.
And at the same t i me we were getting a rise in cigarette smoke. And at some point the doctors started investigating this, and they figured out smoking caused lung cancer. And that was actually published in Reader's D gest and the newspapers i n t he 1950s, cor r ect ?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form A. \Afel I , it's a little more conrpl i cat ed than that. But I do recall, since you mentioned Reader's Digest, the article in 1952 was entitled Cancer by the Car t on.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Ckay. Wien di d t he publ i c
Page 42
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt really first hear -- you know, not bits and pieces. But when di d it become public awareness, when did public awareness start turning t o t he fact that cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. Public awareness with respect to lung cancer
specifically, I would say by 1954 if not before in terms of general public awareness among the public. And the reason I'm r ef er r i ng t o t hat --
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Wis t hat - -
A. --that's because -- I'm sorry. I should just el abor at e j ust a t ad.
That relates to the HarmrDnd and Horn study sponsored by the American Cancer Society, the broad, progressive epi derri ol ogi cal study that was being sponsored by the American Cancer Society. That -- an incredible amount of media coverage beginning in 1954.
So i f I had to pick a year, there may be other years; but I ' d say I woul d, I woul d go wi t h t hat.
Q Wien you were saying it could have been before, I don't know what that means. I mean, how f ar back are we goi ng to go? So can we agree for your purposes sometime in 1954 or shortly before that is when there became a public awareness about the link between smoking and lung cancer?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. I woul d say t he, when t he epi derri ol ogi cal studies begin to appear, they start in 1950, there is, there is some information before that. But generally speaking, in terms of corn ng out i n t he news media and other possible sources of information, I would have to
go back t o t he, t o t he early 1950s, '50 to '54 period, somet hi ng I i ke t hat.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. Now, before 1950, there were other illnesses associated with cigarette smoke even into, that were being reported i n t he press, even before 1940 and 1930, correct?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. That' s cor r ect.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) And some of t hose ot her illnesses were coughing. That was one of them correct?
A. Coughing, definitely. That's mentioned repeatedly all over the place. Textbooks that are used i n school s. Ch and on and on.
Q All right. And Lucky Strikes was advertising that their cigarettes, with their cigarettes you would have no more cough, correct?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form A. I don't think that was what the advertisement said. The one that I remenrber, and whether it was Lucky St r i ke, was somet hi ng I i ke not a cough i n a car I oad.
And if that was Lucky Strike, fine. I don't know whether that's Lucky Strike or not.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) And there were other -- and it was highly publicized i n t he textbooks and i n t he media that cigarette smoking would stunt your growth, correct?
A. \Afel I , t hat' s --
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form A. -- part of a broader issue. And that has to do wi t h mental and physical efficiency. And that's
Page 43
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt really what the textbooks enrphasi zed.
Ch the mental efficiency side, there were a nunrber of studies that were done i n t he '20s and into the '30s that cigarette smoking tended to stunt mental development i n t he young. If you want to use the term stunt your growth. And so we could say mental growth.
And then also physical efficiency has to do with all sorts of things. Everything from various heart disease pr obi errs to swelling of the arteries to -I mean, I could give you a I i st if I spent a little bit of time thinking about it. I ' m j ust trying to remenrber what the textbooks would say about this. Coughing, lung condition, so on and so forth. And in some instances that could be references to cancer.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) The surgeon general -A. So a I ot of these, a I ot of these diseases are ment i oned. I ' m sor r y?
Q You're breaking up. I'm sorry.
A. Ckay. Do you want me t o go back?
Q Cigarette smoking -- no. Don't worry about
i t.
The surgeon general did not conclude that smoking caused lung cancer until 1964, correct?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. Wii t a nri nut e. Could you repeat the question, please? IVfey be I ' m get t i ng a little break-up here, too.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. The surgeon region did not conclude that smoking caused lung cancer until 1964?
IVB. LAWSCN: Same obj ect i on.
A. I, I would disagree with that statement. In terms of statements that were --
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Wien did the, when did the -A. The first statement that I remenrber by a surgeon general was based on a scientific study group that was drawn out of the American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, and other such voluntary organizations. And that was in 1957. And Leroy Burney said in the summer of 1957 that there was a possible causal link between smoking and lung cancer. And that was covered very widely in newspapers across the count r y.
Q Ri ght . But there was still a debate or a controversy as to whether cigarette smoking caused lung cancer, which actually caused the surgeon general to do a report which came out in 1964 on that topic, correct?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. \Afel I , t her e was, t her e was cer t ai nl y a sci ent i f i c/medi cal debate that was going on which is somewhat different, perhaps, than the public awareness issue. Scientists went off, and they debated whether that causal link was really there because there was quite a lengthy discussion about other possible causal factors such as air pollution and macadam i n the hi ghways and on and on.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay.
A. And anyway, the surgeon general at the behest of President Kennedy put a ten-per son cormrittee together in 1962. And the report was actually t o t he surgeon gener al . It wasn't hi m It was a r epor t by a conrrri 11 ee t o t he surgeon general that came out in January '64.
Q And then the surgeon general report linking
Page 44
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt smoking to heart disease came out in 1979, correct?
A. \Afel I , but the connection to heart disease received a I ot of coverage long before 1979. You can go back t o t he 19-teens, 1920s, the 1930s and all the discussion of raising, smoking raising body t enrper at ur e, raising blood pressure, expanding the capillaries, on and on and on as a source of what they call tobacco heart or tobacco disease, potential tobacco disease.
But the 1964 surgeon general's report talks about heart disease. But if you want to say there
was a specific report focused on heart disease, I don't remenrber the year. But you said it was 1979. I can go wi t h t hat . I know there was a report on heart disease.
Q Are you f anri I i ar with advertisement endorsements i n t he 1940s and 50s with doctors, nurses, athletes, and movie stars endorsing cigarettes and smoki ng?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. Yeah. There were a I ot of advertisements with lots of different products which were endorsing by celebrities and so on and so forth. It's something that's done in advertising down to this particular day.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Ri ght. Ther e's st i I I - -athletes are still endorsing products today, different products today. But not cigarettes, correct?
A. I would, there are no advertisements on television. There haven't been since, what was it,
1971. So I doubt whether they're endorsing cigarettes or other tobacco products today. But --
Q I di dn't say anyt hi ng about TV.
A. Ch.
Q I didn't say anything about TV. There are print -- athletes and doctors endorse products today.
Are you aware of that?
A. Ch, of course.
IVB. LAV\8CN: For m
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) But not cigarettes, correct?
A. Actually, athletes and doctors today often endorse products that encourage people to stop smoking.
Q I'm sor r y?
A. Athletes and doctors quite often today encourage and advertise products to encourage people to stop smoking. St op-smoking aids.
Q Exact I y.
A. But -- right. But i n t he 1930s and 1940s and the 1950s, the tobacco conrpani es were using doctors, nurses, athletes, and movie stars to endorse cigarettes, cor r ect ?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form
A. I don't know, I can't , I can't answer t he quest i on. The onl y i ndi vi dual I come up wi t h t hat I remenrber in an advertisement as an athlete would be M ckey IVfent I e. That's the only one I remenrber.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Ckay. So i n al I t he Reader's Digests that you -- well, Reader's D gest -A. \Afel I , no - -
Q - - di dn't have - -
A. -- there weren't any ads in Reader's Digest.
So we can strike that one. Ckay.
Q Yeah. But t he - - i n al I the newspapers that
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt you reviewed and all the other magazines that you looked at, you didn't notice that there were doctors and nurses and athletes and movi e stars endorsing cigarettes? You j ust happened t o not see t hat ?
A. No, I - -
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. I saw, I saw adver t i sement s in which there were kinds of endorsements. And there were athletes and there probably were -- I don't know. I remenrtoer an opera singer, but I don't remenrtoer the person's name. Various kinds of ads. But I ' m j ust saying that's nothing unusual in advertising. That's all. It's cormrDn pr act i ce.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) But I ook - - but i t woul d be unusual today. I ' m t al ki ng about the 1940s and 1950s.
A. R ght .
Q Do you agree i n the 1940s and 1950s it was not unusual to have doctors, nurses, athletes, and movie stars endorsing smoking?
A. \Afel I , par t of - -
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. Part of the problem we have here is what does not unusual mean. And I can't say t hat t hat was t he donri nant form Not unusual i nrpl i es that's the donri nant form I can't say that because I haven't done a
systematic study. I've seen a I ot of advertisements, but I haven't done a systematic study.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) All right. The only reason I sai d not unusual is t hat you sai d not unusual . So i f you just answer nry question, we don't have to have this game, qui t e f r ankl y.
A. Ckay.
Q You reviewed all these newspapers. I've looked at these newspapers. Ckay? I've seen the advertisements i n t he newspapers. So I ' m assunri ng if you di d a thorough job that you were paid to do, it would be pretty difficult t o nri ss t he advertisements.
So nry only question to you is: Are you aware of the fact that the cigarette conrpani es used doctors to endorse their product i n the 1940s and 1950s? Yes or no?

IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. I'm aware that there were advertisements out there in which -- I've seen a I ot of t hem i n which various individuals did appear in them Names --Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Are you aware -A. Actors. I don't know, either actors or opera singers or nrusi ci ans or whatever.
Q And the same would be t r ue wi t h - - i s t he onl y athlete ad that you ever saw was M ckey IVfent I e for

IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. I'm sure there are others. It's just that M ckey IVfent I e, I remenrber that, because of the horrible health pr obi errs that he did have which got widespread coverage i n t he '70s and the '80s.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. And are you aware of the fact that i n t he 1950s and 1960s a large percentage, more than 50 percent, of the programs were sponsored by cigarette conrpani es?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. Programs --

Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Yeah. Television programs.
A. I ' m not aware of that figure.
Q Yeah.
A. I couldn't substantiate that or support it. I know there were a I ot of advertisements for, you know, kitchen appliances, cars, all that sort of thing. There are a lot of advertisements on TV.
Q Do you know how many TV, what percent -- do you know -- have you ever Iooked i nto how many TV shows were sponsored by cigarette conrpani es i n t he 1950s?
A. I once saw an article about that. I, unfortunately, did not make a copy of it at the moment. I've never been able to find it since. And I've looked f or it. So I can't answer t hat .

A. I Love Lucy.
Q That were sponsored by cigarette conrpani es.
A. I Love Lucy. The -- I t hi nk t he name of it was The Lucky Strike Hit Parade. It was a Saturday night program havi ng to do with the top ten songs. I'm trying to think of others. But those two certainly I do remenrber among other -- I'm sure there were, perhaps, ot her s.

A. Do I smoke? No.
Q D d you ever smoke?
A. Yes. Yes.
Q Tel I me when you smoked. Wien di d you smoke?
A. I started smoking -- I smoked on and off for a long time. I started when I was a freshman in college in 1961. And I stopped conrpl et el y in 1996. But I also

IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt had periods of time when I'd stop nowand then and not smoke at al I .
Q I'm sor r y.
A. I had times when I'd stop and not smoke at all. And I also went through a long period when I used snuff. Wii ch doesn't count because it's --
Q And how I ong -- how mjch -A. Go ahead.
Q How mjch di d you smoke a day?
A. V\fel I , it depended. The circumstances. If I was nervous and writing, I probably smoked a lot more than when I was wal ki ng t o t he car or something like that. I was a, I was both a social smoker but also, probably, I also did smoke quite a bit when I would be writing. At least in nry early years.
Q Ckay. So t hat' s what I ' m t ryi ng to f i nd out. Wiat type of smoker were you, a pack-a-day, a t wo-pack-a-day, a f our - pack-a-day? How woul d you descr i be your sel f ?
A. 11 depended on t he, it depended on t he moment in time. Some days I'd smoke more. Some days I'd smoke less. It could be up t o a pack a day. It nri ght have been two or three a day. It nri ght have been two or three a day. It rri ght have been a pack a day. Just depends on the circumstances.
Q Two or three cigarettes a day or two or three packs a day?
A. No. Two or three cigarettes a day.
Q So somewhere between a very light smoker up to a pack a day at t he most ?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. I n t hat, i n t hat general area, yes.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Di d anybody ever t el I you you were addicted to nicotine?
A. No one -- I don't recall anyone t el I i ng me. I remenrber lots of people telling me it was really stupid that I was smoking, including nry parents, both of whom quit i n t he early 1950s, both of whom who were very strong on the issue and very upset wi t h me when I did start to smoke. So I was fully informed f r om ci gar et t e one about the health risks of smoking.
Q But you were young -A. And also that it would be difficult to stop.
Q -- you were -- you were young and presumably you were watching the doctors and the movie stars who were endorsing the product and whether it was peer pressure or whatever, you began smoking despite what your parents were telling you?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form IVR MURPHY: Cbj ect to form
A. I started smoking in college because of peer pressure. Advertisements never had anything to do with nry decisions to start or to stop.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. I'msorry?
A. Advertisements never had --
Q I didn't hear the last part. Can you repeat

Q And then how di d you finally stop in 1996?
A. ivy oldest daughter, who's a trained social worker, said Dad, you know what you're doing is stupid and I'd like you to try, can you stop smoking for a day as part of the O'eat American Smokeout. And I stopped t hat day, and I ' ve never I ooked back. I ' ve never had a cigarette since that time. I don't have any interest in t hem what soever. I have no - -
Q Do you have a - -
A. You know, I don't get any of t he - - what are, what do you call it, the urge to go back. I've none whatsoever. Haven't. So I've been stopped for nearly
14	years.
Q D d you use any qui t ai ds?
A. ivy daughter bought me some Nicorette. And to be perfectly honest with you, it totally grossed me out because I couldn't take the nicotine. I just -- it was such a bolt or shot I sai d i t would be better not to use
it. So after a couple of days I put it aside. I rri ght have had one or two chews over a two-week period after that. But that was all. And I just walked away from i t.
Q Ckay. So the first couple of days you chewed t he gum and t hen - -
A. Wfel I , a f ew pi eces.
Q --that was basically it?
A. Ri ght . I remenrber that I -- I don't remenrber what we did. I t hi nk we gave t he gum whi ch at t hat point was very expensive, to someone else who was trying to stop smoking. But, I mean, I rri ght have had four or f i ve or six chews. I ' m guessi ng at t hat . I don't remenrber anymore.
Q And did you have any other, do you have any other friends or f anri I y menrbers who still smoke today?
A. No. Not that I can think of off t he t op of nry head. None of nry children smoke. None of nry sons-i n-1 aw smoke. ivy wi f e has never smoked. Both nry parents were smokers i n t he '50s, and they both quit in t he ear Iy 1950s.
Q I n, i n t he 1950s when you say half of all Americans smoked or American adults smoked, you would agree that would be roughly, roughly 50 rri I I i on people smoked in t he 1950s?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. That's a good -- I don't know what the exact population is. But if i t' s 50 percent then the population would have had to have been, because you're assunri ng adults smoke. And so you've got to el i rri nat e a significant part of the population because America's population i n t he 1950s was mjch younger on the average than it is today. I can't assume that until you're t al ki ng about a popul at i on base of 150 t o 200 rri I I i on, which may be high for 1950.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Ar e you f anri I i ar wi t h t he Fr ank St at ement ?
A. Yes.
Q Do you know what percentage of Americans smoke t oday?
A. I believe if you want a rough nunrber it would be around -- and this is a t ot al guess on nry part so let me wrap that around it -- I'd say about 20 percent. I'm
Page 49
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt guessing at that. It may not be that high; it may be a little hi gher.
Q \Afel I , that's pretty close. I've heard it was

A. Coul d be.
Q And t he pol I -- you reviewed certain polls.
You i ncl uded t he Gal I up and Roper pol I s on your rel i ance

Wfe, I t hi nk t he Gal I up pol I , bot h t he '54 and ' 57 pol I s ar e ver y i nrpor t ant because t hey show high levels of public awareness; and that's an inrportant part of the evaluation process. And in addition, in 1957, George Gal I up made the statement that wi t h 77 - - I think that's the nunrber, 77 or 78 percent of the population being aware of the HarmrDnd and Horn study, that he said that that was -- and it's his words -- a phenomenal nunrber i n t he annal s of pol I i ng, t hat i t woul d be hi gh, that that many people were aware of what was going on.
So that's inrportant i nf or mat i on f or me t o have i n t he overall evaluation of the awareness, of the levels of awareness i n t he population.
Q \Afel I , do you consi der t he Gal I up pol I s to be aut hor i t at i ve?
A. I -- since there's a legal i nrpl i cat i on with t hat , I cannot, I cannot answer t hat. I can't, I t hi nk,
I think they are pretty good polls in terms of what's going on. They were better than what was going on in the 1930s and the 1940s. But polling was also very nruch in its i nf ancy.
Q I know - -
A. Gd ahead.
Q Ckay. I understand a I ot of experts don't like to use the word authoritative because of legal i nrpl i cat i ons. But woul d you agree t hat t he Gal I up pol I i s ei t her t he I eadi ng or one of t he t op polI i ng organizations i n t he warld?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form
A. It, certainly it would be up there among the top four or five or six, I wduI d think. There are a nunrber of them Wiet her it be Gal I up or Harris or Roper. That's, t hat' s al I I can tell you.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Those are probably the top three? W)ul d you agree?
A. \Afel I , they're among the best known. Let me phrase it that way. They're among the best known.
Q Ckay. \Afel I , are you relying upon t hem because they're reliable or just because they're popular?
A. I'm relying upon t hem because in terms of awareness, they ask very direct questions, understandable questions t o t he population about awar eness. And that is inrportant information in terms of trying to get an overall sense of how t hi s tidal wave of information was getting through t o t he American peopl e.
Q Do you consider t hem t o be a reliable source of i nf or mat i on?
A. Wth respect to awareness issues, I think

IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt they're a reliable source of information.
Q Do you agree that currently the understanding of t he I i nk between smoking and lung cancer or smoking and COPD i s great er t oday t han i t was in t he ' 50s, ' 60s and ' 70s?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. I'm sor r y. I ' m goi ng to t hi nk about t hat .
The -- you're asking whether there's a higher level of awareness today with respect to lung cancer than i n t he 1950s? I s t hat the question? I'msorry. I just didn't qui t e hear it. I di dn't qui t e, I di dn't qui t e hear i t.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ch. Ckay. You keep using the word awareness, and that's not what nry question is. If I ask you red, you don't have to say blue. You can say you don't know or you do know. So I understand awareness and belief are two different things.
A. Ckay.
Q I understand that the polls that you're relying upon differentiate between awareness and beliefs. There's different questions about awareness and beliefs. And quite frankly I don't want to waste nry time today going through each of those questions with
you. But, obviously, I've read your reliance materials; and I see that there are differences in awareness and bel i ef. And we've t al ked about t he f act t hat you understand that. So do you agree with, do you agree with Professor Ford that virtually everybody now believes, i n t he year 2010, virtually everybody now believes that smoking causes lung cancer?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form A. I don't know whet her I can say everyone. But the nunrbers that I've seen --

Q I sai d vi r t ual I y.
A. I understand. Like glasses are virtually spotless. I understand. Wiat I ' m sayi ng i s t he nunrbers that I've seen would be in terms of the most recent polls in the 1990s would be in the 90 percent range, somet hi ng I i ke t hat.

Q - - t hat t he poi I s ar e now 10 or 15 - - par don

A. In 2010? I haven't looked at polls for 2010.
Q Yeah.
A. Cr even 2009.
Q Do you agree that i n t he polls that you reviewed and you relied upon the belief levels among smokers is I ower than the belief levels of nonsmokers?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. \Afel I , t hat woul d depend upon t he t i me and pi ace. I mean, I can't - -
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) \Afel I , do you - -A. Generally speaking the pattern is that nonsmokers, even though we're not going to go back to the bel i ef / awar eness thing, the general pattern is that nonsmokers are less interested and don't -- they really generally believe it a I i 111 e bi t more than smokers but that the gap has closed over the years on that.
Q Ckay. Ckay. I ' m goi ng to ask you, I don't
Page 51
IVkr t i n depo t r anscr i pt think it's necessary to ask you for the '50s, '60s,
'70s, ask three different questions because it's the same on your reliance material. So i f you can't answer it, I'll ask three different questions.
But do you agree that according to your reliance materials and what you've seen, the belief levels among smokers about the link between smoking and cancer was mjch, was lower than the general population in t he ' 50s, ' 60s, and ' 70s?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. Wis I ower i n t he popul at i on?
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) V\&s I ower. V\£s I ower t han nonsmoker s.
A. Wis I ovver than nonsmoker s. I would say that from what I can remenrber from the polls that would be somewhat I ower.
Q Ckay. And do you agree with Professor Ford in the information that you read and his deposition where he said the majority of smokers i n t he '50s did not believe smoking caused lung cancer?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Do you agree wi t h t hat or di sagr ee?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Same obj ect i on.

A. I don't recall whether I di d or I didn't. I don't t hi nk I di d.
Q \Afel I , do you agree that, do you agree, do you agree, nry question is and I ' m goi ng t o t al k - - do you agree that the majority of smokers i n t he '50s did not believe smoking caused lung cancer?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. I don't believe the nunrbers that I have in nry rri nd that the majority of smokers did not believe.
Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Ckay. Do you agree that in 1957 there were, there were approximately 10 to 30 million smokers -- strike that.
In 1957, according to the polls that you have relied upon, there were 25 to 30 rri I I i on smokers who either didn't believe or were uncertain as to whether or not smoking caused lung cancer?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. V\fel I , t he uncert ai n woul d be t he no opi ni on category? I s t hat -- I just would I i ke a refinement of t hat .
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) \Afel I , t hat - - i s t hat what t he Gal I up poi I says? Is t hat what t he Gal I up poi I s says t hat means?
A. It says believe, unbel i eve --Q That uncertain means no opinion?
A. Wfel I , I mean, uncertain can mean different things besides no opinion. Wiat I can tell you is you can't - -
Q I s t hat what you t hi nk?
A. Wfe're going right back where we started again, a hundred percent had to be aware of it whether they
Page 52
believed it or not. That I can tell you.
Q All right. \Afel I , do you think uncertain in t he pol I s meant no opi ni on? Is t hat what you t hi nk t hat means?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. I s t he word uncertain, or i s t he ward no opinion? I don't -- I mean, if we want we can go and I ook at t he document and see what i t says. Wiat I r ecal I i s no opi ni on.
Q (BY IVR. PAI GE) Ckay. Do you know i n 19, in the 1950s whether there were nri I I i ons of American smokers who did not yet believe smoking caused lung cancer ?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. Wiet her there were nri I I i ons of Americans? I can't answer t hat quest i on.
Q (BY IVR. PAI GE) You don't know/?
A. No. I sai d I can't answer t he quest i on.
Q \Afel I , why can't you answer i t ?
A. The reason I can't answer it is I know what poll nunrber s say, but I can't certify that that poll is conrpl et el y accurate in t er ms of belief levels and I don't know, I don't know-- I'd have to go back and do an analysis of how sci ent i f i cal I y that poll was put together in t er ms of belief issues. And I haven't done
t hat . It may or may not have been t ot al I y r epr esent at i ve.
Q Ckay. According to the polls that you relied upon, there were millions of American smokers i n t he 1950s who did not believe smoking caused lung cancer?
A. And there may wel I have been --
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. -- many different reasons why they didn't. I haven't I ooked i nt o t hat i ssue. It's beyond nry awareness --

A. I j ust di d.

A. I'm not bei ng evasi ve.

Nobody had any pr obi em under st andi ng the question. And they actually relied upon the same polls you rely upon. So nry question to you will be t he same question I asked t hem And I et' s j ust see i f you coul d answer nry question before you go on a different topic.
Do you agree with me that according to the polls that you relied upon that there were millions of American smokers i n t he 1950s who did not believe smoking caused lung cancer?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. I can't answer t hat quest i on - -

Q Ckay. But according t o t he polls, whether they're reliable or unreliable, that's what the polls that you relied upon state, correct?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form A. That' s not what t he poi I s st at e at al I . They don't t al k about nri I I i ons of peopl e. Ther e i s no wor d there that I have seen that says this means that nri I I i ons of peopl e don't bel i eve or nri I I i ons of peopl e do believe. It doesn't talk about the population generally. It's meant t o be a sanrpl e of the population, not t he popul at i on, per se.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) So what, so how - - what poi I are you relying upon to say what percentage of people were aware of the fact that smoking caused lung cancer
in t he ' 50s?
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form A. WI I , what I ' m t el I i ng you i s t hat t he Gal I up organization asked awareness questions and they asked bel i ef quest i ons. And what I ' m sayi ng t o you i s I haven't studied the belief side of the equation. That isn't part of nry assignment.
Q ( BY IVR. PAI GE) Ckay. So t he bel i ef quest i ons are, may be unreliable; but the awareness questions are not unr el i abl e?
A. I di dn't say t hat.
IVB. LAV\8CN: Cbj ect to form Q (BY IVR. PAIGE) Wiat percentage of Americans were aware of the fact that smoking caused lung cancer i n t he 1950s?
IVB. LAWSCN: Cbj ect to form A. Wre aware? Wat percentage were aware?

A. That they're aware, that they're -- well, of course this gets into the semantics. But were aware t her e was a possi bl e I i nk bet ween smoki ng and I ung cancer. I ' d go t o t he 19 - - I believe it's the 1954 Gallup poll, but I don't remenrber the exact nunrber. It was a high nunrber in terms of the awareness side of --Q Wis that, was that poll a sanrpl e of the entire
population or just a certain -A. I don't know.
Q -- segment of the population?
A. I can't answer t hat quest i on.
Q WI I , then, how coul d you rely upon it? How could you rely upon it, then?
A. WI I , i t' s t he one nunrber that's out there and avai I abl e.
Q So you're comfortable relying upon it?
A. I ' m conrf or t abl e that it's the one nunrber that's out there and available and it squares with other polling information about awareness i n t he '50s, '60s,
' 70s, and ' 80s.
Q Wat -- tell me t he poi I s t hat you rely upon to say the public was aware that smoking caused lung cancer i n t he 1950s which are the specific polls that you' re rel yi ng upon.
A. There are two that I recall. The 1954 Gal I up poll and the 1957 Gal I up poll. Those are the two I'm awar e of.

There were some government polls. There may have been some Roper poi I s.
