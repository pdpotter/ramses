Whereupon,

Q. Could you state your full name?
A. Peter Calvin English.
Q. And where do you live?
A. In Durham, North Carolina.
Q. Could you give me the street address?
A, Personal Confidential Redacted
Personal Confidential Redacted
Q. What is your Social Security number?
A.	Personal Confidential
RpHar+eri
Q. Dr. English, it is my understanding you have had your deposit ion taken previously; is that correct ?
A. Yes.
Q. And you understand the basic procedure we will be going through today?
A. I believe I do.
Q. If at any time you don't understand a question I have, let me know and I will try to rephrase it. While this is a formal proceeding, we try to do this informally, so if at any time you need to take a break, stretch your legs or whatever, I will try to accommodate you.
A. Okay.
Q. Have you read the amended complaint in this case?
A. No, I haven't.
Q. Do you know what this case is about?
A. I have a general sense.
Q. What is that?
A. It is a class action case in the State of Illinois based on an issue of whether low tar
cigarettes constituted a fraud on smokers of that state.
Q. And have you investigated the issue of whether the sale of low tar cigarettes in the State of Illinois constitutes a fraud on the residents of 111inoi s ?
A. Well, the issue of fraud is a legal question and I am not really able to make comments on legal issues. I do know a fair amount about what the public health community has said over the last 50 or so years on the issue of low tar, so I guess to get back to your specific question of in the State of Illinois, fraud, I haven't specifically looked at that issue.
Q. Let me make sure you and I are straight
on something. I guess it may be my confusion.
This is a case of the citizens of Illinois, not
public health authorities; do you understand that?
A. Yes.
Q. And you understand this is whether the citizens were defrauded and had this information, not whether various public health officials had it;
are you aware of that?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Well, I certainly have a pretty good understanding about what people understood about the dangers of cigarette smoking.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Unless I ask for public health, could you tell me what you know the people were aware of over time, the public and citizens of Illinois — fair enough?
A. I can try to answer that.
Q. Do you have expertise in that area?
A. I have not specifically looked into the area of State of Illinois. I do have quite a bit of knowledge about what the people, and specifically know about issues of smoking and health in the country, yes.
Q. Because I read your report and your ' report talks about what public health officials knew all over this country; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: In part.
BY MR, BRICKMAN;
Q. It didn't talk about what the public in general knew at all about the safety of low tar cigarettes, did it?
A. I am prepared to talk about --
Q. That is not the question. Bear with me.
I don't want to be rude, but I want you to try as
best you can to answer my question. Just so we
don't get in fights later, if I ask you a question
that has a yes-or-no answer, if you would answer it
yes or no first, that would be very helpful to me,
and if you want to explain, you are entitled to
take the time to explain it. But if you would
answer yes or no first, okay.
MR. ROSENTHAL: And I would advise Dr. English, to the extent that you feel the question cannot be answered in a yes-or-no fashion.
MR. BRICKMAN: Counsel, the rules of Illinois limit you to just stating objections to form, so that we can move quickly and we don't have to court and all that, I would appreciate if you can stick to that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Does your report deal with what the public or the citizens of Illinois knew about the safety of low tar cigarettes?
A. No.
Q. And you would agree with me that what public health authorities knew does not necessarily equate with what the public knew, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't agree with you.
Can I explain?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Yes, sir.
A. Well, I think that what the people understand frequently corresponds to the types of information that is out there. The public health community ran a tremendously effective campaign about the dangers of all cigarettes beginning, in many respects, in the 1950s and continuing to this present day, and public opinion polls indicate that the American public heard and understood that message.
Q. Sure. I agree with you. There are a lot of general things that the public knows that public health knows. But as a general rule, wouldn't you agree with me that public health knows a lot more about health issues than the public does?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think the basic message that the public health community wanted to get across - -
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I apologize for interrupting you -- but if we do this at the beginning before things get really hard, if you could answer yes or no, and then explain, it will make it so much faster, because then I have to go back and ask you, was it a yes or no, and I don't want to cut you off, and I don't want you to be rude, but I ask you not to be rude to me, and give me the courtesy of the yes or no, if you can answer it yes or no.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Dr. English was trying to answer and you interrupted him.
MR. BRICKMAN: Absolutely, I did, because
he was going off without the yes or no that we agreed to.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Would you agree with me as a general rule, public health officials know a lot more about public health issues than the public?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, but please let me
explain - -
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Ab solutely.
A. In the sense that I do think that public health officials know a lot more details than perhaps the average person knows, but in the case of smoking and health, the primary message was that all cigarettes are dangerous, all cigarettes cause disease, that smokers are not advised to not smoke at all, and stop if they are, specifically that smoking can cause a variety of different diseases, and that the main point to the public health message were all understood. Now, did the public read every paragraph in the Surgeon General's
report, of course not, but I think the key points that the public health community wished to convey to the American people were understood.
Q. We will go through that in some more detail. Let's move a little bit further.
You would agree with as a general principal that the manufacturer of a product shouldn't be allowed to deceive consumers about its product, wouldn't you?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Would you also agree that if a manufacturer like a tobacco company made false or misleading statements on its cigarette packs or on its advertisements, it should be responsible for those misleading statements even if public health authorities knew better, as long as the public was misled, wouldn't you agree?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Historians have trouble with all these hypotheticals. Are you going to
show me a specific example here?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. No. Let's see if you have a problem with this concept. If you do, don't understand it, tell me. Manufacturer is selling a product that has deceptive claims on it. I think you told me he should be responsible for that.
A. Yes.
Q. Now, if the public is misled by that, those statements, but public health authorities are not, that is still a deceptive or misleading practice, isn't it?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I guess in that scenario, it could be, yes.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Have you come across any statement by public health authorities that a Marlboro Light is in fact lower in tar and nicotine than a Marlboro regular when it is smoked?
A. Yes, I think I have.
Q. Tell me who said that and when they said
it .
A. Well, I think that the tar and nicotine ratings of the FTC was meant to convey that there was a relative difference when cigarettes were smoked at different tar and nicotine levels, and of course, Marlboro Lights and Marlboros are both on the list that the FTC published every year.
Q. So is it your understanding of the FTC listings that they are telling people that when they are smoked, that the smoker will get less tar and nicotine than he will from getting a -- than in smoking a Marlboro regular?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No, but -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I want to know about actual inhaling, actual intake of the smoke. Are you telling me the FTC told consumers that when they actually inhaled the cigarette, they will get less from a Marlboro Light than they will from a Marlboro regular, first, yes or no, did the FTC say that?
A. I think what the FTC rating system said,
knowing that the -- that the whole issue of compensation was there, nevertheless, because these cigarettes were smoked in a machine in the same way on a relative basis, that there was a chance they would get less tar and nicotine.
Q. That is not my question. I want you to pay attention to my question. If you don't understand, I will explain it. You seem to be a pretty intelligent guy, but I want to keep you on track. I am not asking if there is a chance they will get less tar and nicotine. I want to know, did the FTC say you will get less tar and nicotine, Mr. Marlboro Light smoker?
A. No.
Q. See how much easier it is if you stick to yes or no?
A. But some of these questions are complicated.
Q. That wasn't complicated. Let me go back, and make sure. Is there any public health authority that said that, that you will get less tar and nicotine when you smoke that Marlboro
Light ?
A. I think going back in history, that the public health community believed up until very recently that when a smoker smoked a cigarette with less tar and nicotine rating based on the FTC, that they would indeed get a lower tar and nicotine.
Q. Dr. English, I don't want you and I to keep getting at odds with each other, but that wasn't my question. The question was did any public health authority, public health organization, public health entity say specifically, consumer, if you smoke a Marlboro Light, you will get less tar and nicotine on inhaling than you will when you smoke a Marlboro regular?
A. They didn't mention a specific brand. However, if you will met me explain —
Q. Sure, but first the answer is there is no such answer - -
A. No, but -- if you will please let me explain here.
Q. Absolutely.
A. They mention cigarettes with similar tar and nicotine ratings as a Marlboro Light and comparing it with tar and nicotine ratings of regular Marlboro, and they said if you smoked a cigarette lower in tar and nicotine, you would get, by the FTC ratings, that you would get less tar and nicotine. I don't want to quibble. That is something you are concerned I am doing, but it is an important point.
Q.	I want to make sure you and I are clear. When you	used the term by the FTC rating, method -A.	The FTC method.
Q.	That is not through a human inhaling, is
it?
A.	Of course not.
Q.	Stay with my question. I want to know
what the	consumers actually got, not what some machine got. You understand there is a difference?
A.	I understand that.
Q.	Do you know, sir, based upon your study
and your	review, how high or how much tar and nicotine a smoker, a human smoker of a Marlboro
Light can actually get?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS; No.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Do you know how much tar and nicotine a smoker of a Cambridge Light can actually get?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware, however, and I believe you have testified in these general terms, that a human can smoke a Marlboro Light cigarette and based on the way he smokes it, get as much tar and nicotine from that Marlboro Light as he could from a regular - - a regular Marlboro -- would you agree with that?
A. I think that is probably possible. I am not entirely sure of the numbers on that.
Q. You previously testified, I would be happy to show you your testimony, that if a person compensates sufficiently, he can get the same amount of tar from a light cigarette as he can from
a regular cigarette. Would you agree with that?
A♦ I am not sure I ever did say that specifically in the sense that -- there are all kinds of cigarettes. I am not sure that you can get, let's say, from a cigarette that has one milligram tar, as much tar as you would from, let's say, a 35 milligram cigarette. I don't know if that is humanly possible.
Q. I just said low tar. I didn't say an ultra light or anything and a Marlboro Light is low tar. The phrase you used is low tar?
A. But low tar is actually a spectrum, depending on which historical time period we are dealing with, it can be down to low tar.
Q. Would you agree that -- do you recall your testimony in the Blue Cross Blue Shield case?
A. I certainly testified in that case. I haven't read that testimony in quite some time.
Q. Testified at trial in that, didn't you?
A. I did.
Q. And do you recall being asked in that case on May 7, 2001, question --
MR. BRICKMAN: This is on page 5412,
counsel.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Quote: "My question is, if a person compensates sufficiently, it can get the same amount of tar from low tar cigarettes than they get from a regular cigarette, right?" Answer: "Okay, yes, I would agree with that."
A. I don't know the context of that.
Q. Check the context. It is on the left-hand side, sir.
(Pause.)
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Did you say that?
A. Yes.
Q. Was that true at the time?
A. Yes.
Q. Is it still true?
A. Again, with the proviso, there -- I really do think it depends on the lower tar cigarette in the sense that I don't really believe
that a cigarette with one or two milligrams, it is possible to get the equivalent of 35 --
Q. We can put aside to what I refer to as the ultra lights which are the one or two level.
But for Marlboro Light, that would be true, wouldn/t it ?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I am not sure about that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Tell me why not.
A, Because I haven't seen any studies about a Marlboro Light versus a Marlboro regular and so,
I can't answer specifically about a Marlboro Light.
Q. As a general rule, you would agree with that, but you can't say in this case because you haven't seen a specific test; is that a fair statement ?
A„ Yes.
Q. Are you aware that Philip Morris has conducted such a test?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I am not aware of it.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Based on that general understanding of the light cigarette generally being able, if it is smoked, to deliver about what a regular would also deliver, let me ask you this hypothetical, and I want you to consider it from the point of view of public health because that is what you looked at.
If, in the 1970s there was a hypothetical cigarette identical in all respects to a Marlboro Light, flavor, taste, price, et cetera, and the only difference between this hypothetical cigarette and the Marlboro Light that actually existed was that the hypothetical cigarette delivered to the smoker, not the FTC machine but to the smoker, lower tar and nicotine under all circumstances. Do you understand the basic hypothetical facts?
A. I think so.
Q. Would you agree that during the ^70s, if you were in public health and you had somebody who said, "I am not going to quit, I am going to smoke one of these two cigarettes,” you would have recommended that hypothetical cigarette I just gave
you versus the actual Marlboro Light?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: There are so many questions I would want to know about -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Fire away. Let's see what you want to know to answer that question. Seems simple to me, but maybe I am more simplistic than you.
A. How do you know that it is delivering
less?
Q. Because I get to make up the hypothetical, and I said it did. You get to assume that. You are an expert. I can give you assumptions, and just assume it true.
A. The question is -- is there a different method -- how would you know?
Q. Doesn't matter. I waived my magical wand over it. It works that way. Seems pretty simple to me .
A. Historians have to deal with facts, and the question to me, having gone through the 1970s and all of the design modifications that
organizations like the Tobacco Working Group were doing, the idea of getting the same taste --
Q. I did it. I waived the magic wand. It i s done.
A. They worked very hard -- the historical facts don't meet your hypothetical.
Q. That is okay. Obviously it didn't happen. I am asking you if it had happened, if it had happened. That is all.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection. Form.
THE WITNESS: The same thing is true with filtration, and just knowing what I do about people working on filters. I think the whole idea of measurement of taste, filtration, tar -- it is hard for me to imagine it in a 1970s context. That is what I am struggling with this.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Loosen up a little, think outside of the box, whatever the expressions are.
A. Historians can't think out of the box.
We are constrained by the facts.
Q. We can debate that, but put that aside.
I can ask you hypotheticals and you get to answer. With the hypothetical, and I understand all your caveats you have given me, put those aside for the moment. They are all on the record. Which one would you have recommended from a public health point of view?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: The one with the lower tar and nicotine.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Why is that?
A. In the 1970s, the public health community, first-tier recommendation was not to smoke at all, not to start. Second tier was to stop if you were. Third tier was if you are going to smoke, smoke cigarettes with as low a tar and nicotine rating as possible. So in the 1970s, it would make very good public health sense to recommend cigarettes that had the lower tar and nicotine rating.
Q. We are talking about delivery, because both cigarettes had the same rating with the FTC.
That is not why you recommended it, was it?
A. You know, in the context.
Q. Bear with me.
MR. ROSENTHAL: He is trying to answer the question.
MR. BRICKMAN: I am trying not to be rude. I just need to get to know. He can explain. I am happy to explain. I have let him explain everything he wants. I just want my yes or no f irst.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Did you recommend it just now, that hypothetical cigarette, because of the FTC rating or because it actually delivered lower tar and nicotine?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Your hypothetical question dealt with what the person actually received and that is the question I answered. However, if you will allow me to explain, in the 1970s, and I think this is where a historian can contribute to this discussion, people understood, public health
community understood, the FTC understood, tobacco companies understood, that the FTC method did not measure specifically what a smoker got. However, the recommendations of the public health community and individual physicians were nonetheless based on those ratings, knowing all of the weaknesses in the FTC. So they really aren't two separate issues. Everyone knew that the system was flawed, knew it was flawed from even before the system was started, but nevertheless, because the cigarettes were all smoked in the same fashion, the public health community made the recommendation to smoke lower tar and nicotine based on the assumption that the smokers might get less.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Have you read any of the depositions of the Philip Morris executives in this case?
A. No.	.......
Q. Are you aware that even up until the '90s, they didn't understand that concept that the FTC numbers were not what the smoker would inhale?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
Mischaracterizes the testimony.
THE WITNESS: I haven't read that f but certainly the tobacco company submissions to the FTC even prior to the institution of the method in 1966 or '67 indicated they understood that. The FTC has on a variety of occasions since 1967 reviewed the FTC method, and tobacco company submissions to the FTC has understood the shortcomings of the method.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Do you mean to tell me tobacco companies throughout time have understood the FTC method and the effect, like compensation, could have on it?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, the answer is yes.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. So that if they understood that compensation would affect the FTC numbers, if they came in to the FTC and said there is no such thing as compensation, don't bother taking it into consideration, if they said that in the 1980s, that would have been a misleading statement to the FTC,
wouldn't it ?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't understand that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you telling me Philip Morris knew about compensation?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Yes, they knew about compensat ion.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. And they knew it would impact the amount of smoke, or tar and nicotine a smoker inhaled if he smoked a cigarette in a certain way, such that he could be compensated?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: That could happen, yes.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. If a company like Philip Morris told the FTC in the 1980s, "We don't believe compensation exists, and if it does, it doesn't impact these tests," would that be a misleading statement to the FTC?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I would have to see -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Assume my facts to be true. Would that be a misleading statement -- if it is not true, you are not stuck with it.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: The history of compensation is a very complicated subject and you are asking a specific time in the 1980s. I am imagining this, is this in and around the Barclay cigarette -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Just take 1980. Did they know about compensation in 1980, or are you telling me maybe they didn't know about it in the early '80s?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Compensation was a known phenomenon, but I can't tell you specifically about what Philip Morris knew in 1980. I have read some documents that they submitted in and around the Barclay case in, I guess that was, '83, but I would have to see them in front of me to be able to
recall.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. If they sent something to the FTC saying, "We don't think compensation exists," would that have been a misleading statement in 1980?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I would have to see the
statement.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. No, no, no. I am asking you would that, in and of itself, be a misleading statement?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: That hypothetical is -- I want to see some other questions about the context of it. I know that Philip Morris had been interested in the issue of compensation before then. I don't know the context of any kind of submission.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. If they said it didn't exist, would that have been a misleading statement?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I would have to see the statement. I can't comment on that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You can't comment on that. You don't understand it -- tell me what you are missing.
A. I am missing all the facts.
Q. What do you need to know? They said compensation doesn't exist.
A. I haven't seen the document.
Q. I want you to assume that is what they
said.
A. I have to see the document.
Q. I don't have to show you the document. I am asking you as a hypothetical to assume that is what they said.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
BY MR. BRICKMAN;
Q. Would that have been a misleading statement to the FTC, or do you think they really didn't know?
A. I would have to see the document. I would have to see what the FTC response was. I
would have to see what the context is. It is not possible for me to answer a question like that.
Q. I ask that of all people and they seem to be able to answer all of it, except for people who testify for the tobacco companies. Do you think there is something to this, do you all get some shock, you can't answer questions, it hurts the tobacco companies?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: As I said, I need to see the documents. I would be happy to look at the documents and give you some questions about it. I don't know what they are talking about.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Do you understand the concept of compensat ion?
A. I do.
Q. Tell me what compensation is?
A. That smokers change their smoking behavior in response to a cigarette that is lower in tar and nicotine.
Q. As a result -- is there some reason they
compensate?
A. To maintain the same amount of nicotine or to approach the same amount of nicotine.
Q. Would you think that Philip Morris knew about compensation in 1980?
MR. ROSENTHAL: objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I really haven7t studied all the Philip Morris documents, so I can't -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You are not able to say whether the idea of compensation was known to a tobacco company like Philip Morris by the 1980s, is that what you are telling me?
A. I can't tell you.
Q. Because of some limitation in the research you did, you are not able to state under oath today whether Philip Morris was aware of the concept of compensation by 1980; is that correct?
A. No, I didn't quite mean to say that. Philip Morris was interested in compensation. They performed a number of experiments in the '70s. The issue came up with the degree of compensation, and
at least my reading of some of the Philip Morris documents that have been produced in other cases, is that they were all over the board in whether — to what degree compensation actually existed, if it existed.
Q. They were all over the board to the degree that it existed, but it existed by 1980, correct ?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. And they knew it, correct?
A. Well, I --
Q. If you can't say they knew it existed, just tell me. Did they know it, yes or no?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: The they is -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. The Philip Morris companies, however many this gentleman to your left represents.
A. I can't specifically say in 1980 what Philip Morris understood about compensation. And
of course, Philip Morris is a large company, so I don't know what an individual scientist -- it is beyond what I can answer at this point.
Q. Would the same be true of public health authorities, it is a large group, so just because
one says it doesn't mean all of them know it?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: What is the question?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Because one person in Philip Morris knows it doesn't mean that everybody in the company knows it because it is a large company, and my question is, that is the same with public health, just because one public health official knows it doesn't mean all public health officials know it?
A. Yes.
Q. And same with the public, just because one person in the public knows it doesn't mean everybody else knows it?
A. That is correct.
Q. Do you know how many people in Illinois knew about compensation in 1980?
A . No .
Q. Do you know how many know about it today?
A. No .
Q. Do you know how many people understood it or knew it from 1980 through today?
A. No.
Q. You mentioned earlier, and we will go out of my line here because you talk about other things, so bear with me -- you talked earlier about the FTC understanding the limitations of the FTC method. Do you recall that?
A. Yes.
Q. Is it your understanding that Philip Morris knew when they were contemplating putting in the FTC method for calculating tar and nicotine that it specifically knew that those numbers would be lower than what smokers were actually inhaling?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't know that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You haven't seen that in any of your document reviews?
A. I don't believe so.
Q. Are you aware that Philip Morris wanted to keep that FTC method in effect because specifically it gave lower numbers than people were actually receiving?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: What year is that?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Does it make a difference to you? I want to know what why you asked me that question.
A. Because the first question asked about a specific timeframe, which was 1966 and 1967.
Second question, again, historians have to deal with a time context. Are you -- was this something that emerged in 1966 or '67, or do you have in mind a different period.
Q. Does it make a difference?
A. It makes a difference to me historically.
Q. You tell me if it makes a difference in my question and if it does I will go through some dates. What difference does it make? I am asking you if you are aware that they knew that?
A. I am not aware if they knew it.
Q. Are you aware that they knew it at any point in time from 1967 through today?
A. I can't recall that I have seen that.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. That doesn't form the basis of any opinions you gave in your report, does it?
A. Well, the basis and support of the FTC method was a comparison. So, again, in your hypothetical question about whether they gave lower or higher numbers, presumably they would be relative to other cigarettes being measured. So, again, there is so much to these types of questions that I can't answer, so I don't think it would make a difference.
Q. My question to you, sir, you didn't rely on that for any of the conclusions in your report, did you?
A. No .
Q. You don't base any of your opinions upon the statement I gave you, do you?
A. No.
Q. Thank you, sir.
We will move much faster if you stick with me. I know you want to say certain things, but if you stick with my questions -- he will ask you a bunch of questions at trial.
What does the phrase lowered tar and nicotine mean to you? And that is quote, lowered tar and nicotine?
A. Are you quoting from a particular document ?
Q. No. I am just quoting that phrase as I gave it.
A. In general, from roughly the late 1960s, 1970s on, lowered tar and --
Q. Lowered, E-D, I just want to make sure you have it in there -A. I am not sure what the E-D means. Lower tar means roughly 15 milligrams of tar and less.
You have made a particular point of adding the E-D, so I am not sure -- I have to understand your question of what the E-D means.
Q. Have you come across that phrase in your review of all the literature on cigarettes and how were viewed over time?
A. Certainly the term low tar, lower tar, lowered tar --
Q. Lowered, that was my question, lowered tar. Have you come across that phrase?
A. I don't see any difference between all of those. That is why I was wondering if you were quoting from a specific document that may have that.
Q. You don't see a difference between lowered tar and nicotine and lower tar and nicotine and low tar and nicotine, is that correct, those three phrases, you view them as all the same?
A. I don't see the difference --Q. Is the question yes -MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him finish.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I am trying. Are they all the same, in your mind?
A. Yes, but the way you are asking the
question, if I can explain --Q- Sure -
A. Perhaps in some document they are used in slightly different ways, in which case if you show me the document I may be able to put it in some kind of context.
Q. Let's go back. If something is described as lowered tar and nicotine, what is it lowered from, if you know?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I would interpret a statement like that as lower on the tar and nicotine ratings of the FTC.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Lower than that what?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Lower than other cigarettes that have a higher tar and nicotine rating.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You added in there the phrase -- you would have assumed it meant or you would have taken it to mean lower in tar than under the FTC method,
correct, is that what you said?
A. Yes, I did say that.
Q. If a consumer in 1971, '72, was told cigarettes -- these cigarettes are lower in tar than some other brand of cigarettes, and didn't say lower by the FTC method, lower by the smoking machine, lower by some analytical testing only, would you agree with me, that consumer would have assumed that that phrase, lower in tar, meant lower than what he was actually inhaling than if he had smoked some other cigarette?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, I don't think that is
the case.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Tell me what you base that on, that a consumer would know in the early '70s that the expression lower in tar meant not what you are going to inhale but lower in tar only by the FTC method.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
Mischaracterizes his testimony.
THE WITNESS: In 1971 and 1972 is, of course/ right after the American brands decision by the FTC which dealt with the use of terms like lower tar and similar terms, I think was the phrasing in there. So certainly the use of those terms in advertisement, which I believe is what your question was, was certainly a legally sanctioned term. Now -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Again, that wasn't my question.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him finish.
MR. BRICKMAN: He seems to be going off on a tangent.
THE WITNESS: No. It is just a complicated subject. In 1971 and 1972, the issue of compensation was something that was -- the public health community was interested in, was getting some serious research in this, and so -are you still with us?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I am with you. I think you are not paying attention to me. I don't care about public
health. I want to know about a consumer. I don't care if a public health authority is buying the cigarette. I want to know about the consumer, the man on the street.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Is there is a question?
MR. BRICKMAN: Yes, there is a question.
I want to know where he is going with it. He quit talking for a while. He was off on a tangent, anyway.
THE WITNESS: You had your head back.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Because I was letting you finish. I don't want to be rude.
A. If I understand, your question is -certainly I think that since the whole issue of which cigarette to smoke and the recommendation to smoke cigarettes with as low tar and nicotine as possible were based on the ratings that were conducted by the PTC, I think that that would be a reasonable supposition of what people thought they were getting.
Q. Is it your position -- I want to be sure
we are clear. You are going to come to court and swear under oath that the consumers in 1971, 1972, the men and women on the street, understood that when people used the phrase lowered tar and nicotine that meant, without anything else added to it, lower tar and nicotine only when smoked by that smoking machine used by the FTC?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Is that what you are telling the Court? Yes or no, and then you can explain if you need to.
A. No, and let me explain. You asked the question in the historical context of '71 and '72, and why people chose low tar and nicotine --
Q. No, I didn't ask that question. That is not my question. I didn't ask you why they chose low tar and nicotine cigarettes.
A. Well, in a way.
Q. No, not in any way. When they saw the phrase lowered tar and nicotine, nothing else with it, you just told us that they knew that meant lower tar and nicotine by the smoking machine at
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.	1
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Have you reviewed any documents by public health authorities to indicate that you are wrong?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, form.
THE WITNESS: Can you show me one?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I want to know how good an expert you
are .
A. I can't recall one. Can you --Q. I can show you plenty. I am asking you. You are not aware of any, and your understanding is and what you can tell the Court come trial time is that in 1971, ’12, when that phrase lowered tar and nicotine was shown, consumers took it to mean lowered tar and nicotine by the FTC method and not what they were actually getting when they smoked that cigarette?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You are saying am I aware
of public - -
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You are not aware of any public health statements to the contrary. We already have that on the record. What I want to know now is is that what you are going to tell the Court?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Yes or no?
A. Yes.
Q. I know you are not aware of any public health statements to the contrary. Are you aware of any internal Philip Morris documents that say you are wrong, and that consumers did not understand that?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Can you point to some specific document that says specifically consumers, and I will give you in this country as opposed to just in Illinois, understood the phrase lowered tar and nicotine to
mean lower tar and nicotine by the FTC method? Do you have any specific example with that phraseology in it ?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I am not sure I can give you one with that term, lowered, in it.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Now, if you are wrong, and consumers didn't understand the phrase the way you just said and in fact thought it meant actually lower when they smoked it, would that then mean to you that they did not understand the significance of the tar and nicotine rating system?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, that is a hypothetical question.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I am not sure it is a hypothetical any more. I think yours is hypothetical. But that is our argument. I am not going to agree it is hypothetical. But go ahead, with the understanding that we disagree.
A. Certainly the public health community understood --
Q. I don't care. Stick with my question.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You are asking about the specific documents. I am not sure I can answer that .
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Why not?
A. I am not aware of any particular polling data that asked that specific question.
Q. Let me ask you this, you looked at some of the advertisements, correct?
A. I have looked at some advertisements. I haven't made a -MR. ROSENTHAL: Wait a minute.
THE WITNESS: I have looked at some advertisements. I have not made a special effort to look at a representative sample of advertisements over a particular time, but certainly in looking at -- through magazines and newspaper reports and things like that, public
health literature, I have seen a fair number of cigarette advertising.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. And you have looked at a lot of statements from Philip Morris and the Tobacco Institute to the public?
A, I have never made a systematic analysis of those, but I have seen quite a few of them over the last several years.
Q. Did you ever see a statement by Philip Morris that when they used the phrase lowered, with an E-D, tar and nicotine, they meant only if you look at it by the FTC method?
A. Again, I would have to look -- you are making a big thing about the E-D at the end, and I just don't recall all of those statements, whether they had E-D at the end.
Q. Even if it didn't have the E-D, did you ever see a statement by them telling the public that when we use the phrase lowered tar and nicotine, that what we are referencing is just the FTC method and not what you are actually inhaling?
A. I can't answer that. I don't recall the documents —
Q. You can't answer it or -- you can answer it. You just don't know.
A. I don't know.
Q. You don't know of any such documents?
A. I can't recall one, no.
Q. I am here for your discovery deposition. Do your opinions and conclusions in any way rely on such a document?
A. I don't think so.
Q. Now, as we discussed earlier, and we finally got to that point, somebody could smoke a cigarette, like a Marlboro Light, and get as much tar and nicotine if they smoked it in a certain way as if they had smoked that Marlboro regular — do you recall our discussion about that?
A. Yes.
Q. And I think we finally came to the conclusion as a general rule, that would be true, correct ?
A. I think that is theoretically possible.
Q. You just haven't seen the actual test data. I have that benefit.
But if that is in fact the case, a Marlboro Light in actuality is not necessarily lower in tar and nicotine than a Marlboro regular when it is smoked; isn't that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, this is a theoretical question because every smoker smokes differently, so in the sense that perhaps in one smoker that might be the case -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. For whoever smokes it in such a way as to get it -- if you smoke it in such a way to get as much tar and nicotine as you would get if you smoked the Marlboro regular, in that sense, that Marlboro Light is no longer lower in tar and nicotine than the Marlboro regular, right?
A. In the way you phrase that question.
Q. And you understand before the cigarette is smoked, the Marlboro light and the Marlboro regular have the same inherent ingredients?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I am not sure.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Do you think a Marlboro light has less tar and nicotine in it than a Marlboro regular, and that is an odd question because you don't get the tar until you smoke it, but do you think they inherently have different tar and nicotine levels before they are smoked?
A. I don't know that.
Q. You didn't come across that in your research on this subject?
A. I don't know what precisely is in a Marlboro Light.
Q. Does that mean you didn't come across this in your extensive review of this topic?
A. That is correct.
Q. Do you have an idea how it is that a Marlboro Light gets less tar and nicotine to the FTC machine than a regular?
A. No. I could make some -i
Q. I don't want you to guess. I want to
know what you as an expert know. You don't know t hat ?
A. No.
Q. You don't rely upon that for any of the opinions you have given in this report or the opinions you hold for this case, correct?
A. No.
Q. No, or that is correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. If it is all right, we have been about an hour. Can we take a break?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Sure.
VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now going off the video record at 10:56 p.m.
(Discussion off the record.)
(Recess.)
VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now back on the video record. The time is 11:05 a.m.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Dr. English, the people that compensate when they smoke a light cigarette and who are getting the same numbers as the regular
cigarette -- remember that little scenario we talked about?
A. Yes.
Q. To those people at least, the phrase lowered tar and nicotine is not applicable, correct ?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Insofar as what they are actually getting, that phrase would be inapplicable, right?
A. Well, that is a hard question for me to answer. We are getting off into hypotheticals . Lower than if they had smoked in the same fashion another cigarette?
Q. Lower than if they smoked that regular cigarette?
A. But we don't know how they would have smoked the regular cigarette.	......
Q. You wouldn't expect them to compensate with that regular cigarette?
A. I don't know.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Do you think people compensate with regular cigarettes?
A. Compensation is a comparison to when people shift, in other words, as a response, and so -- and the terms regular and low are relative terms, not only historically but at any given moment. Do you see where I am going?
Q. No, sir.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Are you done with your
answer?
MR. BRICKMAN: He was asking me a question. My turn to answer.
THE WITNESS: You don't know when one switches from one to another, it is really an individual response, so it is hard to say how an individual smoker is used to smoking one particular low tar cigarette, if they move to a regular tar, I don't know how they would smoke that, I don't know.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Under your theory of compensation as you have just given it to me, if a person is a Marlboro
regular smoker and he smokes another Marlboro regular, does he compensate?
A. First of all, it is not my theory of compensation --
Q. The theory you just gave me, whatever that is. You just explained it in some fashion. I want to use your phraseology. However you understand it and gave it to us under oath. If a smoker is a Marlboro regular smoker and smokes a Marlboro regular, is he going to compensate?
A. Certainly what the public health --Q. Yes or no?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him answer.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I want a yes-or-no, and I am not asking public health. I am asking you.
A. Of course, my knowledge is based on public health and scientific understanding of this. Q. I am asking you -MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him answer the
que s t ion.
MR. BRICKMAN: I want him to answer my
MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him answer, and if you think it is unresponsive, you can go back.
THE WITNESS: Are you asking me as a physician in 2002 or as a historian?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. 2002. Smoker smokes a Marlboro regular and smokes another one; is he going to compensate?
A. The smoker can smoke the same cigarette in different ways and different fashions at different times. So I suspect that at any given moment, it is possible to get different tar and nicotine ratings.
Q. That wasn't my question.
A. Okay, but --
Q. I am using the term compensation -A. If you are using the term compensation, which means change in smoking patterns due to a change in nicotine, and if there was no change in nicotine, the answer would be no with the proviso that smokers can smoke differently cigarettes with the same content.
Q. You and I, I think, both understand that. There is one thing between compensation and the idea of smoking cigarettes differently just because you are in a rush or on occasion you can't smoke the whole thing or you smoke more of it or less. That is not compensation. Those are mechanisms of compensation, but simply smoking a cigarette differently is not compensation, is it?
A. I think it goes into the mix because when people measure the effects of compensation, they measure them no matter how a cigarette is smoked. That is what the epidemiological studies are looking at. So how individual cigarettes are smoked do factor into that.
Q. Do you think then under your definition of compensation, I thought we were where we were, but may be not, under your definition of compensation, simply smoking a cigarette differently is compensation?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think it is a component
of that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. A person who smokes Marlboro regular who then smokes another Marlboro is not going to compensate ?
A . No .
Q. I am wrong or that is correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. However, if that person who regularly smokes Marlboro regular goes to a Marlboro Light, in all likelihood he is going to compensate, correct ?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't know any particular studies that go between Marlboro and Marlboro Light, so I can't answer that specifically.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. If a person went from a regular cigarette to an equivalent brand light version of that samie cigarette, that person is going to compensate, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: What the public health
community and scientific community has said about compensation is there is a chance that they would compensate at varying levels. They have never said -- I think your question implied that all smokers compensate -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Let's take the person who does compensate. Some of them are going to compensate, in your opinion?
A. Again, are you asking -- are you asking me as a historian of medicine at what particular point in time -- what people thought about compensation?
Q. No, sir. I am just asking you -A. It is important to know because I am here as a historian of medicine.
Q. But you also have a report that talks about public health authorities, and they are not involved in my lawsuit. I am trying to avoid going off of what is involved in my lawsuit.
Now, that smoker who went from a -- who went from a regular cigarette to a same brand but
light version who does compensate, and he compensates sufficiently, as is possible, as you told me earlier, so that he is getting the same level as that regular cigarette, to that person at least, would you agree he did not get quote lower tar and nicotine upon smoking that cigarette?
A. Yes.
Q. So that for that consumer, that we just described, the phrase lowered tar and nicotine may not be applicable under all circumstances, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, we have to go back. In what context is the statement being made?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Just by itself. It doesn't say anything. Just says lowered tar and nicotine.
A. I think it does --
Q. Let's say it is on the cigarette pack?
A. On the pack?
Q. Yes. Can you believe that. Have you ever seen that phrase on a cigarette pack?
A. I am not sure if I have or not.
Q. You don't rely upon that statement being on a cigarette pack for any of the opinions you gave in your expert report; is that correct?
A- That is correct.
Q. And you don't rely upon that phrase being upon any cigarette pack for any opinions you hold with regard to any fact in this case, do you?
A. That is correct.
Q. But let's just say, hypothetically speaking, the phrase "lowered tar and nicotine" was on a pack of cigarettes, nothing else, the name and all the other imagery but nothing else; would you agree that phrase on the cigarette pack might be misleading without telling people about the FTC smoking machine?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: My belief is in that particular context, what the lowered refers to is the FTC rating system.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. But you would agree with me that there is nothing out in the public forum -- strike that.
You would agree with me if there was nothing on the cigarette pack, the consumer couldn't look at the cigarette pack and figure that out?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I would have to see the
pack.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Let's just say it says Marlboro cigarettes, lowered tar and nicotine, nothing about an FTC method, nothing about a smoking machine, nothing else. Let's just say, under that hypothetical, would you agree with me that a consumer might not understand, based just upon looking at that cigarette pack, that there is an FTC machine they are referring to and it may not be applicable to human smoking?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I can't tell you what an individual smoker would say without talking to the individual smoker. Certainly, even beginning before the FTC methods, the issue of what was lower
in tar and nicotine dealt with nicotine ratings, whether they were done by Consumers Report or Readers Digest or the FTC. So I think -- when it said lowered, it meant lowered by the FTC method.
Q. Just by looking at a pack of cigarettes, they would know that -- I think we have occurred that -- that is your opinion?
A. That is my opinion.
Q. You have no documents that refer to that?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I forget how your question was phrased, but certainly all the FTC lists were published on an annual basis. Virtually every public health message in the '60s, '70s and '80s dealing with lower tar and nicotine, and dealing with the recommendation, the third-tier recommendation, was all predicated on the notion of the FTC method.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. If I could look at the FTC lists -strike that.
I have to tell you -- I have to preface
that, up until I got involved in this litigation, I have never seen a list of FTC ratings. Had you seen the list?
A. Sure.
Q. Where had you seen it?
A. You can see it published every year.
Q. Where?
A. Associated Press usually publishes it.
Q. Tell me when you first saw it so I can check the Associated Press list for it.
A. I can't tell you when I first saw it.
Q. Approximately?
A. I know they began publishing it in 1967.
Q. I want to know when you first saw it.
A. I can't remember.
Q. Did you see it in the '60s when you were in college?
A. I am sure I saw it in the '60s.
Q. You were in Duke. What were the papers at Duke that you were reading?
A. Late '6 0s?
Q. Yes.
A. New York Times - -
MR. ROSENTHAL: You read the New York Times in college?
THE WITNESS: of course, every day. I also read the local papers and they carried the AP -- Associated Press -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. What was the local paper?
A. At that point it was the Durham Morning Herald. It is currently the Durham Herald-Sun.
Q. So I can look in the local papers and they have that every year and you being interested in that would have looked at those PTC lists?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Do you remember what any cigarette was rated as having as its tar and nicotine numbers?
A. Specific numbers, no.
Q. General numbers?
A. In -- as I remember, the articles from --Q. I want to know about the list -A. You want to know the range of numbers?
Q. Do you know any cigarette numbers from the late ' 60s?
A. Sure.
Q. What?
A. The range was —
Q. I don't want the range.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him finish.
MR. BRICKMAN: We are on different wavelengths.
THE WITNESS: You said the specific
numbers ?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. The specific numbers.
A. No. I know the range.
Q. What was the range?
A. Probably in the high 30s down to one or
two.
Q. Which one would have had one or two?
A. I can't remember.
Q. Which would have been in the high 30s? A. Can't remember.
Q. How did Marlboro compare to Winston?
A. I don't know.
Q. Did you know at the time?
A. Since I wasn't a smoker, I wouldn't have been concerned at the time.
Q. Your sister smokes?
A. I have three sisters.
Q. Does one of them smoke?
A. In the 1960s?
Q. Let's say in the 1960s, sure.
A. Two of them did.
Q. If I go take their deposition, do you think they will know what the tar and nicotine levels were for their cigarettes?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I don't know. You would have to ask them.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I am asking you.
A. I have no idea.
Q. Do you think the general public knew what the tar and nicotine levels were?
A. Certainly the numbers were out there.
Q. That is not what I asked.
A. I can't tell you specifically did a given member of the public know what tar and nicotine ratings were for their cigarettes.
Q. You don't know if your own sisters knew
that ?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Were you done?
THE WITNESS: That is certainly a relevant piece of information that was easily available, so I think it is indeed probable that they knew it, but you are asking for a given smoker; I can't tell you that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Just because something is published doesn't mean people know about it?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: But the issue of —
MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him answer.
MR. BRICKMAN: He is supposed to answer yes or no. That is the rule.
THE WITNESS: Just because something is published doesn't mean the public has to know, the
answer to that is yes, that is correct, but let me please explain, and that is that the tar and nicotine ratings, the issue of the third-tier recommendation for low tar was not something that was just published once; it was published over and over and over again, carried in public service messages, educational programs. This was an integral part of the public health educational campaign of the American people, so it is not a one-off publication- In fact, the whole purpose of the FTC lists was, of course, to inform the public that there were differences among cigarettes.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware of Philip Morris documents where they did surveys that found out that smokers had a lack of knowledge of tar numbers and lack of sophistication in interpreting the tar number lists?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, I am not aware of that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware of public health
authorities telling people — publishing articles that consumers did not understand the tar and nicotine lists?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Do you have a specific
document ?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I do. I am asking you if you know of any document. I am trying to test your knowledge.
A. Is there - -
Q. Do you know of a document, yes or no?
A. As I sit here —
Q. Do you want your reliance list —
MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him finish.
THE WITNESS: As I sit here, I can't recall a specific document that specifically said that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I am going to mark as Exhibit 1, we just got this this past Friday, this apparently is a supplemental reliance list for you, and we will mark it as Exhibit 1.
(English Exhibit No. 1 was marked for identification.)
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Let me hand you what was delivered to my co-counsel Friday morning, and I got it Saturday morning. Is that an additional list of reliance documents or is that the new amended reliance list?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Do you have a copy for
me ?
MR. BRICKMAN: No. I just got it Saturday at my home. Do you have a copier at your home ?
THE WITNESS: I would have to look at the two lists together to tell you. I can't tell you whether this is the amended one or it is the supplemental one.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. That is the latter that was sent to Mr. Flack, that says it was the supplemental. Did you prepare that?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you intend it to be the amended or
A. Supplemental.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I would be happy to clarify this.
MR. BRICKMAN: Sure.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I am confused between the difference between supplemental and additional.
MR. BRICKMAN: Supplemental versus amended. I want to know if that is in addition to the list he gave us.
MR. ROSENTHAL: No. I think everything
that is -MR. BRICKMAN: Let's mark this as Exhibit
2 .
MR. ROSENTHAL: I am not going to take the time to look through this to see if it is the complete list, but my understanding is with his expert report we submitted a reliance list, and you can ask Dr. English about this. This list is supposed to replace the old reliance list. The old reliance list is no longer in effect. Basically the old reliance list should all be in here with a
couple of additional documents.
MR. BRICKMAN: That is all I need to
know.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. So the old list that I was about to mark I don't need to. I hope that has all of the pages in there.
MR. ROSENTHAL: That is my understanding.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Is there any document on your list marked as Exhibit 1 that specifically would indicate consumers were aware of the FTC numbers and how they should be interpreted?
A. You know, I can't remember the content of all of those documents.
Q. Well, if you want, I will take a break, we will go off the record and I will let you look through this list ad nauseam. I need to know so I am not surprised at trial. That is all. I will be honest with you, I don't think there is, but I haven't read everything here. You seem to be a
pretty smart guy.
A. Your question is public perception of the FTC numbers?
Q. Yes.
A. There are some polls that indicated that. I know you are going to ask me for a specific document and I will have trouble giving that. What did people -- what did smokers think that the term lower tar meant.
Q. Or the tar and nicotine numbers themselves. I will be honest with you, I don't think they understood what you say they did. I am trying to figure out what you are basing it on.
A. What the polls indicated is there was a variety of different things. Some people thought it meant lower tar and nicotine. Some people thought it meant a change in taste, among other things.
Q. Did any of them think, though, it was lowered tar and nicotine for a machine, and only for a machine?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I can't recall a document that specifically said that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Take your time. Do you think looking through the list -A. The list wouldn't help me. I would have to go back and look through the original documents.
Q. If you do find such a document, will you advise counsel so he can tell me and I can verify that before trial -- is that fair?
A. That is fair.
Q. As of today, under oath, you are not aware of any such document, are you?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection. Mischaracterizes his testimony.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Yes or no, and then you can explain.
A. I think I mentioned to you that when people were asked what they mean, how they interpreted the term lowered tar and nicotine, there were people that understood that term to mean a variety of different things including that they
had less tar and nicotine.
Q. But what I want to know, did any of them say less tar and nicotine by a machine?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Right, but I think that is
assumed.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I am telling you it is not.
A. That is my opinion.
Q, That is your opinion?
A. Yes.
Q. You have no document to back you up on that; isn't that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think that is my interpretation from reading these. I can try to give you a more specific document when I have had a chance.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. As you sit here today under oath, you have no document you can reference, can you?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: That uses the term machine?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. That explains that it is a machine smoking it, and not the human?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: People understood that the FTC method was a machine.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q- Tell me where the public understood that. That is what I am trying to get at.
A, I think that is implicit with the whole nature of a list.
Q. That is your opinion, but I am trying to get if you have some document to back up your opinion.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Every time those lists were published there was always a mention in the publication of those lists that this was done by the FTC machine method.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. So you are basing it on the lists that
were given each year, and that is how the public knew, from then on -- bear with me, let me ask my question -- from then on, that those numbers were simply done for a machine?
A, And all of the public health literature when talking about lower tar always said by way of the FTC method.
Q. Do you have some document to indicate that, the public knew what "by the FTC method” meant ?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think the public understood it to be a comparative method, but the question is -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Give me a document.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him finish his
answer. Are you done?	......
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Give me something that said that the FTC method was understood by the public to mean that a machine was smoking it. Do you have that document?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I can't recall one, a specific document, as I sit here, but I will work on that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Up until you tell me, I am going to rely on the fact that there is no such document because I can't search it until you tell me; is that reasonable for me to assume, that if I don't hear from you, you couldn't find it?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: That is reasonable.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I know you are not a communications expert; you have so testified, correct?
A. Can you give me --
Q. They have people that are communications ; experts, communicating skills and how people take messages from the media, how they are interpreted. Are you familiar with that field?
A. I am not —
Q. I am assuming you are not an expert in
that field.
A. I didn't know where you were going with the question, so I wanted to --
Q. Do you hold yourself out as an expert in the field of communications?
A. Not specifically, no.
Q. Now, there is, in this case experts, communications experts who have stated that when the term "light" is paired with a product name, that consumers interpret that to mean less bad or less harmful; are you aware of that, sir?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I am not aware of any of
that .
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Can you tell me how you interpret the word "light" when it is added to the end of a product?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, form.
THE WITNESS: I have never really given it any thought.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Here is your chance.
A. Probably less.
Q. When you see it in terms of a light beer, what does that mean to you, less what?
A. It can mean a whole bunch of different things, I guess.
Q. What does it mean to you?
A. I think it can mean less alcohol, less calories, it could mean less filling. There are all sorts of lesses.
Q. When you see it in conjunction with a cigarette, what does it mean to you?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: It could mean -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Not could. What does it mean to you? When you think Marlboro Light, what does that word light mean?
A. I suspect it has to do — depending on who is receiving the word. It could mean less nicotine, less tar, a different taste, it could mean any or a whole variety of things.
Q. What does it mean to you?
A. I am not a smoker.
Q. But you see it -MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him finish.
THE WITNESS: For me, it is not a personal issue.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. It is in this case. You understand we are here on a case involving Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights; are you aware of that, sir?
A. Yes.
Q. The word Marlboro Light, what does the word light, when attached to that Marlboro name, mean to you?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I am here as a historian of medicine. The issue is what did the term light mean at different points in time -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. My question is what does it mean to you today? I get to ask the questions. You may want to tell the Court certain things and Mr. Rosenthal
may want to ask you certain things, but you are obligated to answer my questions today as I phrase them, and I am asking you not as a historian, I am asking you as an educated person, what does the term light mean when it is attached to that cigarette known as Marlboro?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I have a little trouble divorcing that because I know what the term -- to me it is a descriptor that has been around in cigarettes for 20 or 30 years, and it is connected with the FTC ratings. In order to use it, a cigarette company has to have a published tar and nicotine rating that goes along with it.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. And in conjunction with that, the FTC is not measuring taste, are they?
A. No .
Q. So under that, what it references is a lower tar and nicotine, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I am not sure I know what
the purpose -- you know, what the meaning -- you know, what a cigarette company means by putting that on a label.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I didn't ask that.
A. You are asking me what I interpret it as. It is basically what I mentioned.
Q. What is lower tar and nicotine; is that correct? I think we are on the same wavelength; is that correct?
A. Or it could mean a different taste.
Q. So the PTC method does measure taste?
A. No. You said what does the word light
mean.
Q• No, no, I did, but I thought we were still in the context of the Marlboro Light and I thought you gave me the definition that it had to do with the FTC rating. What does the word light mean to you when it is connected to the word Marlboro and put on a package of cigarettes?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Well, to me it doesn't mean
a whole lot because I don't smoke, and because I can't really divorce what I have read for the last 30 years, the permissibility of the use of the word light is allowed when it is joined with the FTC's rating for that particular cigarette.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Under your definition as you have just given it, does that word mean then, as you understand it, lowered tar and nicotine?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: It can mean that, but I think it has a broader meaning than that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. When it is attached to the word Marlboro, what does it mean to you?
A. I tried to answer that.
Q. Maybe I am the slow one here.
A. It has to be connected with the FTC -mandated -- it has to be connected with the FTC rating system.
Q. And we both agree the rating system has nothing to do with taste correct?
A. But I think it can also have to do with issues such as tastes.
Q. Are you aware of surveys that have been conducted over time, over the last 30 years, that indicated consumers interpreted the word light to mean "better for you"?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, I am aware of that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Maybe you can help me because I have been thinking about this -- you are a smarter man than I am -- are you aware of any product -- the regular product and then the product that has the word light attached to it where if you consume the same quantity of both, that it is possible to get more of the bad stuff in the light than it is in the regular?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, form.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Do you understand that question? Let's take the beer. If you drank a light beer, a Miller Light, and then you had a Miller regular, and you
drank the same number of bottles, each of which contained the same amount of beer, is there any way you could get more calories from that -- drinking those lights than if you could the regular?
A . No .
Q. Do you understand what I am getting at# the scenario of consuming the same quantity?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Unless drinkers compensate and you are not aware of that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You are not aware of that, and you are a doctor, aren't you?
A. I don't know that.
Q. Is there compensation with alcohol?
A. I don't know. I was throwing out a hypothetical.
Q. I am asking you for things you know to be correct. I don't care whether on the planet Mars it might be different. Do you know of any product where you could get more of the bad stuff in the light than you can in the regular if you consume
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I can't think of one.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Except with cigarettes?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I can't think of one.
Q. Except for cigarettes?
A. You could.
Q. By smoking the same number, same quantity, you could get that?
A. It is possible.
Q. Is there any other item where it is possible to get as much of the bad stuff in the light as you can from the regular?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I can't think of one.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. In your opinion, is a purchaser of Marlboro Lights entitled to believe that they are in fact "light”?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think that goes to how the individual smoker interprets the word light.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. If he interprets it as meaning less harmful to you, is he entitled to get that?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Is he entitled to get what he hopes to get.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. What he hopes it to mean.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form. Calls for a legal conclusion.
THE WITNESS: I don't know how to answer that question.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. What is so difficult with that question? Tell me what you need.
A. I can think of all sorts of products that may not quite give what you want to get.
Q. You have said it depends on what the consumer thinks of it. Is there some
interpretation of light that you now have different
from what you told me before -MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. That the consumer is not entitled to get if he thinks that?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection. Calls for a legal conclusion.
THE WITNESS: Let's see if we can puzzle through this. Maybe you can help. If a smoker wants a cigarette that tastes different and that is how he interprets the word light, is he entitled to have what he anticipated the benefit of taste --
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Let's take taste. Is he entitled to
t ha t ?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, I am not sure he is entitled to that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Under your interpretation of light, lowered tar and nicotine, is he entitled to get lowered tar and nicotine, the way you interpret it?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Again, the word -- you know, you are asking my opinion. The word light means, you know - - is connected with the FTC machine measured ratings and I think that is what he is entitled to get, is that. But, again -- this may have different meanings for you than it does for me.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. How much money have you been paid over time from tobacco companies?
A. I have never totaled it up.
Q. Approximately?
A.	in this case -I
Q.	No, sir, not in this case.
A.	Several hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Q.	Close to a million?
A.	I have never totaled it up.
Q.	Do you think it is close to a million dollars ?
A.	I really can't tell you.
Q.	How much have you -- how much time have
you spent on this case that you can get paid for?
A. Less than $15,000 at $350 dollars an
hour .
Q. Less than $15,000 -A. Fifteen.
Q. That is not what you have been billed or paid but how much time that you have spent but will bill and get paid to date?
A. To date, yes -
Q. And when were you first contacted about this case?
A. A little more -- about a year ago.
Q. And have you done anything specifically to prepare for this case, specific to the State of 111inoi s ?
A. No.
Q. Have you met with attorneys in preparation for this deposition?
A. I have.
Q. How many occasions?
A. Once.
Q. For how long?
A. About four hours.
Q. When was that?
A. Yesterday.
Q. How many attorneys were there?
A. One.
Q. Was that Mr. Rosenthal?
A. Yes.
Q. Which other attorneys have you dealt with with regard to this case?
A. George Lombardi.
Q. That is it?
A. That is it.
Q. Other than your testimony in depositions in Blue Cross Blue Shield case, the Bullet case, and the Department of Justice case, have you had your deposition taken or given trial testimony in any other tobacco case?
A. No.
Q. Have you had your deposition taken in any other type of case?
A. I have been deposed a number of times in child-abuse cases. I have been deposed on a few
occasions in malpractice cases, and I have been deposed twice in lead-paint cases lead-paint cases.
Q- And the malpractice cases, I don't mean to imply anything, but were those in cases in which you were being sued or someone else's malpractice or alleged malpractice?
A. Other people. I was an outside expert.
Q. And were you testifying on behalf of the doctor or institution or on behalf of the injured party?
A. Depends on what you consider the injured party to be, but I was on behalf of the pediatrician.
Q. And in the lead-pigment cases, have you testified in court?
A. No.
Q. Do you have any plans to testify in court in any of those?
A. I have been named as an expert in a number of cases. Whether I will be called in those cases, I don't know.
Q. Are you going to be testifying in the case in Rhode Island?
A. I will not be testifying in phase one.
If it goes beyond that, I probably will be.
Q. And you have had your deposition taken in that case?
A. Yes.
Q. And did you have your deposition taken in the New York case?
A. No .
Q. Which other case were you deposed in?
A. I was deposed in a case in Baltimore in
1996 .
Q. Do you have copies of those depositions? A. I suppose I might. I can't remember.
Q. Can you check with counsel and see if we can get a copy of those?
A. Sure.
MR. ROSENTHAL: We will take that request under advisement.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Who was your counsel?
A. Phil Curtis.
Q. Which firm?
A. Arnold & Porter.
Q. Which depositions -- the attorneys representing the lead industry or the lead defendants in those cases that were represented by Arnold & Porter, they are the ones that contacted you?
A. Yes.
Q. And they are the ones that are here today?
A. Yes.
Q. And are the ones you have done your tobacco work through?
A. For the most part.
Q. How many total hours have you spent reviewing the literature, reviewing governmental agency reports, published material, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, involving tobacco matters?
A. A lot, but I --
Q. Thousands of hours?
A. Yes.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form, by the
way .
MR. BRICKMAN: Too late.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You have also met with lawyers on countless numbers of occasions as well?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I am not sure it is countless. It is a definable number, but I am not sure I can help you with that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. More than 50?
A. I doubt i t.
Q. Less than 50 but more than 30?
A. I can't help you. I don't know.
Q. In any event, that is secondary.
Would you agree that in your profession as an expert in history of medicine, that there are often two sides to various stories that have taken place in history?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Two or more.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Now with all your work, your deductive reasoning powers that you use to make assumptions, your meetings with the attorneys, all your work, tell me what you found Philip Morris did over time to mislead the public about the hazards of its cigarettes.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I am not aware of that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Not aware of anything they did to mislead the public?
A. That caused the public to be misled? I am not aware.
Q. Do you consider yourself unbiased in this
case?
A. I would like to consider myself to be a critical thinker.
Q. That is not what I asked you. Do you consider yourself to be unbiased?
A. It ry to be.
Q. Do you consider you have been?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you consider yourself honest?
A. Absolutely.
Q. And you found nothing to indicate Philip Morris did anything to mislead the public about the hazards of its cigarettes?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: The question, the way you phrase it, am I convinced that the public was misled, I don't believe that is the case.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. On any point over any period of time?
A, You have to give me a specific set of documents, but I can't think of any as I sit here.
Q. Are you aware of allegations of the same?
A. Certainly involving these cases, I am aware of that, yes.
Q. And you have investigated those ......
questions?
A. In many of the cases, I have. I can't say I have investigated every one.
Q. But you found in your extensive review.
or comprehensive review, that historians have to go through to do it correctly, in your comprehensive review, you have not found one such instance, correct ?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Sitting here, I can't see where I can say that the public was misled.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware based on your comprehensive review of any instance in which Philip Morris attempted to mislead the public about the hazards of its cigarettes?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That gets to the question
of intent.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. No, sir.
A. Sure it does.
Q. Whether their any attempts -- did they commit any acts that were misleading?
A. I interpret your question to mean one of intent.
Q. Take intent out of there.
A. I don't think you can.
Q. I just did. Did they do any act that was misleading, even if it didn't succeed?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I am not aware of one where I can demonstrate that the public was misled.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware of attempts to mislead?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Attempts to mislead gets to a question of intent, and I can't answer that question.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Have you looked at any document that indicates that even if you use the word intend, which I have not/ that they attempted to mislead the public?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I think intent is in there and I can't tell that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Why not? You said you can interpret what people were interpreting from FTC numbers based on your deductive powers and certain evidence that was out there; can you not do the same with Philip Morris as you can with the public?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection. Mischaracterizes testimony.
THE WITNESS: Again, I cannot tell intent from a document. That is different from trying to make a global interpretation of what the public health community wished to convey to the public about issues of tar and nicotine ratings and numbers. I think it is a different kettle of fish.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I am not asking about public health. Can you interpret what public health officials were thinking?
A. No.
Q. Can you interpret what the public was thinking?
A. A given person, no, unless --Q. In general?
A. Certainly public opinion polls measure what they believe.
Q. And would written documents by Philip Morris executives indicate what they were believing at the time?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: What they believed, perhaps. Intent, I can't say.
MR. BRICKMAN: The videographer needs to change tape.
VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now going off the video record at 12:01 p.m. This is the end of tape 1 .
(Discussion off the record.)
(Recess.)
VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now back on the video record. The time is 12:09 p.m., and this is the start of tape 2.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Following up with what we were just talking about, in that comprehensive review you have to do as a historian of medicine, what you
found Philip Morris did to mislead or even attempt to mislead public health officials about the hazards of low tar cigarettes?
MR. ROSENTHAL: objection.
THE WITNESS: I am not aware that they
did that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Can you tell me what you found in your comprehensive review that Philip Morris did to mislead the public about the hazards of its low tar cigarettes?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I am not aware as I sit here of any attempt to mislead. Again, it goes to intent.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Can you tell me what you found in your comprehensive review about Philip Morris' attempts or actual efforts to frustrate public health efforts to get people to stop smoking?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I can't answer that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware of any such efforts?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I am not aware of any.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Can you tell me about what you found out in your comprehensive review about Philip Morris executives withholding information it had about the hazards of its products including low tar cigarettes ?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I am not aware of any.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Can you tell me what you found from your comprehensive review to indicate Philip Morris withholding or attempting to withhold from the public information or evidence regarding the hazards of its cigarettes, including its "low tar" cigarettes?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I am not aware.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Can you tell me what you found Philip Morris did to get underage consumers to smoke its cigarettes ?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That is not something I
studied.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware of any such efforts?
A. No, I am not.
Q. In the last two months, have you made any systematic review of -- or systematic analysis of what Philip Morris knew that the public did not know about cigarettes or smoking and health?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Did you say the last two months?	.
MR. BRICKMAN: Yes, because two months ago he gave a deposition and said he hadn't done any such.
THE WITNESS: That is correct, I don't
know .
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q, You haven't done any such search?
Q. And I assume your answer two months ago was also true, that prior to that time you didn't do any systematic search of what Philip Morris knew or didn't know?
A. That is correct.
Q. Have you done any systematic analysis to see what Philip Morris knew that public health officials did not know?
A. About what?
Q. Smoking and health?
A. No.
Q. Have you made any investigation into the research done by Philip Morris in Europe about smoking and health?
A . No .
Q. Are you aware they did research in Europe ?
A. In a general sense, yes.
Q. Are you aware that one of the reasons they did research in Europe is so that it would not be discovered in the United States?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You have not come across any such document?
A. No.
Q- If there were such a document, would you consider that an effort to frustrate public health?
A. I would have to see the document and try to place it in some kind of context.
Q. Tell me in what context that would be acceptable to you.
A. is this one person's opinion, is it -MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him finish.
THE WITNESS: Is it a person's opinion on day one and not on another day? Did this person who raised this, did he get clobbered by other people ?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Let's say it is one of the heads of the company and he said, let's do this research in Europe so people in America won't find out about
A. I would have to see the document.
Q. Is there any circumstance where you think that would be tolerable under your opinion of what is right and wrong?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I would have to see the context, discussion about reasons for research in one place over another.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q* I am giving you the entire reason given, is so that it would not be uncovered by people in the United States.
A. Can you show me the document?
Q. I am telling you to assume it. You haven't seen it. I don't want to show you things you haven't seen.
A. I would like to see it.	. .
Q. I am sure you would, but you have all the time in the world to do your systematic review of documents of Philip Morris?
A. That is not something I have done.
Q. But you could?
A. That is not what I want to do.
MR. ROSENTHAL: If you think there is a document that would be relevant to his opinions, we would be happy to have him see it.
MR. BRICKMAN: That is objection to form.
Thank you.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. What do you mean?
A. I have been looking at what the public health community knew. I have seen Philip Morris documents in other cases, but I have not made a systematic review of Philip Morris documents.
Q. Why is this something you don't want to do? Don't you want to know what they were thinking?
A. I don't think that is part of the public health community's response to this problem of smoking and health.
Q. Did you ever think they might know more than what public health knew?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: If you have the document and want to show me, let me look at the document.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Maybe I know about it because I have looked at the documents, but you are not in a position to say whether Philip Morris knew because you haven't looked at the documents?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I have looked at a lot of documents that have been put forward in other cases, but I have not made a systematic review.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Well, in all the documents you have looked at, are you aware of any effort on their part to hide research by doing it in Europe?
A. I can't recall a document that says that. Q. Can you tell me a context in which it would be morally acceptable to you for them to hide research by doing it in Europe?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, I would like to see the whole context of that and what is being done.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q- You will not be given it now. You may be given it later, but what I have just described to you, can you tell me of any circumstance you think that would be acceptable to you as a doctor?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Were that the only consideration, I think companies probably make decisions on where research is going to take place on a whole host of reasons having to do with regulations and economics -- and who has the resources to do it and the expertise of local scientists. There are all sorts of reasons.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Those are all valid reasons, aren't they. A. You are adding this one.
Q. I am telling you that is the reason.
A. I haven't seen the document.
Q. But you make assumptions about what people knew and understood without any document.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I want to you assume that is what this company said. Is there any context that you can tell this court that that is morally acceptable from a public health point of view?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I want to go back to the statement where you characterized about my statement and the FTC ratings. It was not based on a single document; it was based on a much more systematic research. In this particular case here, you are making a hypothetical case, and if it is based on a document, please show it to me.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I don't have to do that. That is not my obligation. I am asking you to assume that. Are you incapable of making that assumption?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I need to know because I may go to court to force you to answer. Can you answer or won't you answer?
A. I am trying to do the best I can. You
said the only reason they are doing it would be to hide research. I say that is sort of outside my experience about how decisions are made. So I am asking you to show me the document.
Q. You think companies don't hide research, is that -- based on your review of the history of medicine?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That that is the sole reason that decisions are made, no.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. That is one major reason that companies do things like that -- have you come across that in your study of medicine?
A. No.
Q. Never?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:	.....
Q. Are you aware of allegations like that, of companies hiding material?
A. I am not aware of that, no.
Q. Are you aware of this company, Philip
Morris, destroying documents?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection. Form.
THE WITNESS: I have no knowledge of
that .
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware of this company, Philip Morris, stating that if certain research doesn't turn out the way we want it to, we will bury that research?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form:
THE WITNESS: I have seen that document.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Is that acceptable from a public health point of view?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, it is not, but again, putting the document in context, we don't know, for example, whether the research was ever carried out - -
MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him finish.
THE WITNESS: We don't know if it was carried out, what kind of answers that the research
reached. We don't know whether indeed any information was indeed destroyed. We don't know whether the information was -- whether it was significant. We don't know what the response of the person this was directed to -- there is a whole bunch of things we don't know.
Q. Those are all things -MR. ROSENTHAL: Don't interrupt him.
MR. BRICKMAN: I never know when he is finished. He is rambling.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Finish the answer to the question to the extent necessary and then we can go on.
THE WITNESS: When you uncover a single document out of a universe of 33 million documents, the question is what is the significance of the document, and where a historian can help is trying to place the document within the context. So there is this document. I would have to look at the whole document to get the right wording, but the question is I would want to know a whole bunch more about that document.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. If in fact they destroyed research because it was bad for them, is there some morally acceptable reason you would give them for doing that ?
A . No .
Q. That would be wrong, wouldn’t it?
A . Yes.
Q. Thank you.
A. Please let me explain.
Q. It is a yes-or-no. You have to explain right or wrong.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Doctor, finish your
answer.
THE WITNESS: There are many reasons why people publish or don't publish. The fact is was there a contribution to be made in the sense that not all data that is done in a scientific laboratory is published.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I didn't ask you about publishing. Did I mention publishing?
Q. Let me ask you this, be honest with me, do you feel you have to defend the acts of Philip Morris here today?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No, I don't.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. It would be wrong to bury documents that are contrary to your position so that other people can't find them; isn't that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you make an investigation to see if they did in fact bury documents?
A * No .
Q. Now, apparently you said you saw the document that referenced them burying documents.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: We would have to read the document. It didn't say quite that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You said you read the document that referenced burying documents?
Q. Did you make any investigation to see if they carried it out?
A. No .
Q. Are you aware of a Mr. Thomas Ozdine?
A. I know his name.
Q. He is one of the ones that was ordered to bury documents?
A. I don't know if that is the case or not.
Q. Are you aware of the deposition he gave in the State of Texas Attorney General case against the tobacco companies?
A. I don't know.
Q. Do you know what it means to take the Fifth Amendment?
A. I know what the Fifth Amendment means.
Q. Let me read to you some of the questions he was asked and the answers he gave, and maybe you can help explain to me some of his answers. Okay?
I am referencing his deposition of May 13, 1997, and Mr. Thomas Ozdine was one of the head vice presidents of science and technology.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Do you have a copy for counsel or the witness?
MR. BRICKMAN: No. I will just read it
to him.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Question: "Did Philip Morris order Dr. Ray Morgan to destroy research results that demonstrated that aged sidestream nitrosamines were, greater when released from a commercially available Virginia Slims cigarette than from an artificially prepared so-called reference cigarette used in previous tests?" His answer: "On advice of counsel, I respectfully decline to answer based on my Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination because there is an ongoing criminal investigation."
What does that mean?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection. Calls for a legal conclusion.
THE WITNESS: I don't have a clue. I don't know Mr. Ozdine. I don't know the nature -I don't know where it fit in the testimony. I
don't know what his counsel was intending.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Do you know what it means to take the Fifth Amendment under that circumstance?
A. That is a legal --
Q. Do you understand that it is your right not to incriminate yourself?
A. In general.
Q. Can you imagine what circumstance it might be that he would give an answer that might incriminate him?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I can't answer the question because I don't know anything about this proceeding, the subject matter, of the people involved, and I also haven't even read the deposition.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I can tell you it is all the same answer throughout. Maybe you can explain this question. Did Dr. William Dunn -- do you know who Dr. William Dunn is?
Q. One of the head researchers?
A. Yes.
Q. Question: "Did Dr. William Dunn ever advise you that he was counseling that results of nicotine tests if shown to demonstrate the influence similar to morphine, should be 'buried'?n Do you know what he answered?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. "On advice of counsel, I respectfully decline to answer based on my Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination because there is an ongoing parallel criminal investigation."
Do you have any idea why he would answer
that way?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Same answer as I gave before, I have no basis on which to answer that quest ion.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Can't imagine why he worried about
incriminating himself?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I can't.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Have you investigated any such -- strike
that.
Let me ask you, in the lead case you testified in, did you also say there that the industry didn't mislead the public?
A. Well, of course, the contexts are very different. I would be happy to go through my opinions in the lead cases if you are interested.
Q. Did you say at that time that the lead industry did not mislead the public?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I am not sure I was asked that question specifically. But that would be my opinion.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. And in that case, didn't you also say like you are saying in the tobacco cases that public health community knew whatever the lead
industry knew?
A, Yes.
Q. Now, earlier today you mentioned the fact that the FTC had given a definition for the word 1ight.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection. Mischaracterizes the testimony.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Do you recall that? You said there was some regulated use of the word light?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: What I hoped to convey was that in the American Brands decision in 1970 or 19 71, the question came up with the use of low tar, and then the descriptor was -- and it gave the provisions of when the term descriptor like low could be used, and it used the term or other similar terms, or something like that, and other similar terms is something like light.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Would you agree with me that the FTC has not issued any regulation or any statement with
regard to the word "light”?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I can't answer that specifically. My general understanding is that the term light would come under the phrase or similar descriptor, or whatever -- I don't have the ruling right here in front of me.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You have your reliance list in front of you. Tell me any document on there, any FTC ruling, even if it is not on there, where the FTC regulated the use of the term "light."
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I can't cite that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. In fact, they have not done so?
A. I do not know.
Q. Can you tell me under oath that you are aware of any such regulation? Because I am not. I will be honest with you, I don't think there is, so if you know something I don't know, and I am sure you do, but enlighten me on this one.
A. My understanding is that the word light would come under the descriptor low tar, or whatever the phrasing of the FTC was.
Q. When I was asking you earlier about the phraseology light, you equated it with low tar?
A. We have had a lot of questions about light, and light beer, and I don't want to --
Q. Does light mean low tar in the sense of cigarettes?
A. Yes, in the terms of the FTC -MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Which, if they are going to use a descriptive phrase, my understanding of the FTC ruling on this is they have to have the FTC ratings displayed at the same time.
. BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Other than your reference to American Brands and their use of the term other, is there any document on your reliance list or anywhere in the world that says the FTC is regulating the use of the word light?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I am not aware of that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You can't state under oath there is such a document, can you?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I am not an attorney. I don't know what -- all the hearings of the FTC, but I am not aware of that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You are not a aware of any such hearing, any such regulation where they use the term light and regulate the use of the word light, right?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Other than what I said at the beginning, is that I think it is subsumed under the provision of similar topics, and, again, I am butchering your phrase because I don't have it in front of me.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. And you are not a lawyer and making some legal interpretation of what the FTC was doing, is that correct?
Q. Could you tell me what low tar means, the phrase low tar," how do you define it?
A. In a general sense, the public health community has defined low tar as roughly 15 milligrams or less.	'
Q. And does that go all the way down to one?
A. Yes.
Q. And how do you define the word light with reference to cigarettes?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Again, are you asking me as a historian of medicine?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Yes, as historian of medicine.
A. I would interpret that the same way --
Q. Fifteen milligrams or less of tar?
A. Yes, but again, with the proviso if it is used in an advertisement, that it has to be accompanied by the FTC measurements.
Q. But there is no regulation on that word light?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Again, it goes back to — I think it is subsumed into the phrase.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. But that is just your assumption?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
MR. BRICKMAN: I want to know if he has some basis.
MR. ROSENTHAL: He has explained it six
t ime s.
MR. BRICKMAN: He has no document. It is just his assumption. I just want to know if he is changing his testimony.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Do you have anything new other than what you told me?
A. New in the last 10 minutes, no.
Q. Would you agree with me that sometimes in the past when people used the term low tar, they were simply referring to filter cigarettes?
A. Can you specifically give me a. document there? Because --
you whether you, as the expert in the history of
medicine, can tell me whether that was done or not. If you are not aware, fine.
A. There may indeed be a document that makes that equation. People used the term low yield, low tar.
Q. Do you want me to rephrase the question? Did you not understand?
A. Go ahead.
Q. Are you aware of any occasions in documents you have reviewed where people were using the phrase low tar to mean filter cigarettes?
A. I think that is possible. Certainly --
Q. Can I ask --
MR. ROSENTHAL: Counsel, let me him finish. You haven't heard the rest of his -- you haven't heard -MR. BRICKMAN: This is wasting time. He is going off on tangents. If he is knows about it, tell me.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Are you done?
MR. BRICKMAN: I am sitting here wasting
my time.
THE WITNESS: In the historical context, especially in the 1950s, you didn't give me a time, there was a time when the term low tar could be used in the same term as filter. As the nature of the product changed that most people were smoking, filter cigarettes became essentially the universal form of cigarettes, and that is why I was struggling with the issue, at what particular historical moment -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I don't care about possible or could, I don't care about -MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him finish.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Did you have more to say?
A. In the 1950s when people used the term low tar, they could mean filter. Are there documents? There are a fair number, but as I sit here today, I can't give you a particular document. Q. Are you aware of some documents in the
'60s where people use the term filter to also mean low tar, yes or no?
A. That could happen also -- and sometimes it was filtered, sometimes it was filtered low tar, it was used especially in public health literature and in the popular literature, they were used in many cases synonymously.
MR. ROSENTHAL: The faces, the nodding of the head, shaking of the head, are entirely unprofessional.
THE WITNESS: He answered that question very professionally at the end -MR. ROSENTHAL: And you were mocking him the whole time.
MR. BRICKMAN: You are under an obligation to answer the questions directly* He clearly answered it right then and there in the last sentence in five seconds.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Tell me all the different ways smokers compensate, all the different mechanisms.
A. There were two basic ways that smokers
compensate. One is to smoke an individual cigarette more intensely, and the second way is to smoke more cigarettes.
Q. And when you say intensely, are there various ways they can smoke it more intensely?
A. Yes.
Q. What are those ways?
A. They can take more puffs or hold puffs, hold puffs longer. They can block ventilation of holes in the filters.
Q. Can you tell me if each of the ways you described, what year that was established as an accepted fact within the medical community?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I will go through them, and you give me the date.
A. What is the established fact?
Q. I want to go through the specific method of compensation; okay? Do you understand that?
A. Well, I mean --
Q. When was it established that a method of
compensation was smoking more cigarettes -- when was that established within the medical community?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think that is still under debate. But I —
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I don't need any more.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Do you need to clarify your answer?
MR. BRICKMAN: If he doesn't know a date, he doesn't know a date.
THE WITNESS: If you permit me to clarify. For example, as early as 1957, Ernst Wynder, when he proposed the benefits of lower tar cigarettes, mentioned the possibility that could be negated with increased numbers of cigarettes. The issue of whether smokers indeed, when they smoke lower-yield cigarettes increase the number of cigarettes has been something that the public health community has been concerned about over the last several decades and they have reached a number of conclusions about it, and I think that there is
still some debate about whether that indeed happens.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q- So it is still under debate even as of today?
A. I think it has become under debate as of today because of the NCI Monograph 13. I think up until Monograph 13 there was the assumption of the public health community that smokers did not substantially increase the number of cigarettes when they smoked low tar, and that was based on a number of studies and a number of surgeon generals' report s.
Q. You referenced the Wynder study in '57 as to his citing smoking more cigarettes as a method or mechanism of compensation, and as we described compensation, you recall, sir, that had to do with the need for a nicotine quota within the body.
A. Can I answer?
Q. Of course you can answer.
A. Of course, Wynder did not use the term compensation, but he was aware at least of the
potential that a smoker would change the smoking patterns with a cigarette that had a different tar and nicotine rating.
Q. Is it your understanding that within that article that you just referenced, Wynder 1957, that he said people might be smoking more cigarettes because of their need to get to their nicotine level regardless of whether he used the word compensation or not?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: It is two articles. They ; are in a series. I referenced both.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I will give you both because I don't think he said it in either one, but tell me.
A. He didn't use the term nicotine.
Q. And he didn't understand that the reason you might smoke more cigarettes was because of the need to get the nicotine level to a certain point for an individual, did he?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I can't tell you what
Dr. Wynder thought in 1957.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q- He did not publish about it, though?
A. He did not publish about it.
Q. It is now under debate. Prior to Monograph 13 coining out, when did you think it was or it was not accepted as a means of compensation? If it was never accepted that they smoked more cigarettes, then it is not a problem.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: The issue was addressed in 1979, 1980, by Dr. Garfinkel who was a member of the research team down at NCPS.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Was that accepted by the medical community in 1979, that people smoke more cigarettes as a mechanism of compensation?
A. He said they didn't smoke more cigarettes.
Q. Prior to that, was it accepted that they
did?
A. No.
Q. So up until 2001, it has never been accepted, is that what you are saying?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think in 2001, I think that is a hypothesis that has been suggested in Monograph 13.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Up until 2001, it was never accepted that people smoke more cigarettes to compensate; isn't that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I don't want to be vague here, but that was certainly a possibility that people threw out, but my understanding is that the public health community, and that is based on surgeon generals' reports, '84 and '89, was that their conclusion was that after having been investigated, that they did not think that smokers of light cigarettes smoked appreciably more cigarettes.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. So it was never accepted within the
medical community that people compensated by smoking more cigarettes; is that correct?
A. That is my understanding, yes.
Q. When was it accepted by the medical community that people took more puffs to compensate?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: This is part of the nicotine compensation theory. This was raised as a possibility in the early 1970s. Certainly was proposed by a number of researchers. It was discussed in length at the '79 and '81 surgeon general reports, and was one of the hypotheses out there - -
BY MR. BRICKMAN;
Q. When was it accepted, if at all?
A. It is hard to put an exact date --
Q. Give me a range then.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I would put it in a,range from the mid-'70s to mid-'80s.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Mid-'70s to mid-'80s it was accepted -not hypothesized, not suggested -- it was accepted by the general medical community; is that the date or the range?
.	MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think that is a reasonable approximation, yes.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. How about taking deeper puffs, when was - -
A. I would put all of those in the second category, with the exception of covering the ventilation holes, in the same --
Q. And when would you give that category -A. The ventilation was proposed by Lynn Koslowski in 1980 and it was picked up by the public health community as a potential issue.
Q. I want to know when it was accepted, not by the specialists, but by the general medical community.
A. General medical community?
Q. I kept saying that.
A. I misunderstood you. I thought you meant the specific public health community dealing with cigarettes.
Q. When was it -- we have done more cigarettes. When was it accepted by the general medical community that one of the mechanisms of compensation was taking more puffs?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think I would put it in the same range. I have to reconsider your questions. I was reading public health community in those questions.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Apparently doesn't make a difference?
A. I think it is in the same range.
Q. Deeper puffs, hold longer, general medical community accepted it when the public health community accepted it, same ranges of dates?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Probably. It is a range.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. How about when they accepted the blocking
of the ventilation holes?
A. Certainly was available in the surgeon general's reports of '80 and '81, so it was out there then. There were public service announcements about it in that timeframe as well, and it was in the public media, so I would put it probably mid-'80s as a possibility. There is always a question of how significant this is as a form of compensation, at least the potential that it was there.
Q. When did it become a significant issue for the medical community as opposed to just a possibility?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: The ventilation holes?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Sure.
A. I am not sure when it became a significant issue. It was raised. The significant --
Q. That is what you said. I want to know when it was a significant issue in the medical
community based on your review?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Certainly with surgeon general reports in the early 1980s, it is there.
It is a problem. Whether it is a significant problem, I have a problem struggling with that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. So you can't give me an answer?
A. Yes.
Q. Is that correct?
A. Yes, that is correct.
Q. Let's go through each one, and tell me when Philip Morris was aware of these various items as means of compensation, if you can.
Can you tell me when Philip Morris recognized that one method of compensation was smoking more cigarettes?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Of course, I am not sure when scientists in Philip Morris knew that. Philip Morris is a company and they have research groups and people within there. When you say when did
Philip Morris know -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. They act through their agents. When did their agents know? When did their employees know? When did their researchers know?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: When did they do research on whether —
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. No. I said when did they know that one method of compensation was smoking more cigarettes? A. I don't know.
Q. When did they know that taking more puffs of a cigarette was a method of compensation?
A . I don *t know.
Q. When did they know that taking deeper puffs was a method of compensation?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't know.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. When did they know that holding the smoke in longer was a method of compensation?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I don't know.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. When did they know that vent blocking was a method of compensation?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I don't know.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Have you seen any public document put out by Philip Morris advising the public of any of those methods of compensation or mechanisms of compensation you have just gone over with me?
A. I am not aware of any.
Q. When was it accepted by the general medical community that compensatory smoking could be an unconscious activity?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I can't answer that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You don't know the answer to that?
A. I don't know the answer.
Q. When did Philip Morris learn that
compensatory smoking behavior could be an unconscious activity?
A. I don't know.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Marlboro Lights, whatever you know about them, are designed in such a way that the vent holes can be blocked -- isn't that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't know if that is the case or not.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Do you have any information to indicate that the vent holes on Marlboro Light cannot be blocked?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Is it your belief they can be blocked?
A. I just don't have any information about
that .
Q. Do you think Marlboro Lights are
different than other light cigarettes in their ability of smokers to engage in the activity of vent blocking as a means of compensation?
A. I don't know.
Q. Haven't looked at that, have you?
A . No .
Q. Is it your understanding that Philip Morris designed cigarettes, Marlboro Lights, knowing full well that smokers compensated by vent blocking and yet still designed a cigarette that would allow vent blocking?
MR. ROSENTHAL: I don't know if that is the case or not.
THE WITNESS: Objection.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware of whether Marlboro Lights were designed in such a way that smokers can take more puffs from them than would be done under a regular cigarette such that people could compensate?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I don't know if that is
true or not.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware if they are designed in such a way that smokers can take deeper puffs in smoking Marlboro Lights in order to compensate?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I am not aware of that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware that Marlboro Lights can be designed in such a way that smokers can hold in the smoke longer as a method of compensation?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, I am not aware of that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware that Marlboro Lights can be designed in such a way that smokers can smoke more of them as a method of compensation?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: No, I don't know that.
VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the record at

(Discussion off the record.)
(Recess - )
VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now back on the video record. The time is 1:14 p.m.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Dr. English, when did you personally, as a medical doctor, fully understand that the compensation mechanism could be an unconscious act ivity?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I am not sure I can give you a date.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Was it the last decade?
A. Maybe. I just can't be precise on that.
Q. You don't know when the general medical community knew about unconscious compensation, correct ?
A. That is correct.
Q. And you are not sure when you knew about it, but you did at some point know about it?
A. If I am understanding unconscious meaning the smoker is unaware of what is going on -- or
could be unaware of what is going on, I am not sure .
Q. Do you think you learned it in medical school?
A. I don't think so.
Q. Do you tell your patients now about unconscious compensation?
A. No, I don't. I tell my patients not to smoke.
Q. But for those that do smoke, even though you are a pediatrician, I believe you said you do have some children who smoke.
A. I do.
Q. Do you explain to them compensation?
A. The whole issue of low tar cigarettes, things like that, is what I call a third-tier response, and we don't get there.
Q. You don't tell them about compensation?
A. My approach to them is stop and don't start.
Q. But for those who smoke, and are continuing to smoke, you don't tell them about
compensation, correct?
A- That is because I don't get to that point. Yes, that is correct.
Q. And as I understand, you are not aware of any data that indicated that the American people knew of compensation with low tar at any point in time -- strike that.
As I understand, you are not aware of any data that indicated that the American people knew that there was compensation when they smoked low tar cigarettes; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think what I said was there was a considerable amount of information out there about that in various forms which I hope I let you know. What I can't recall sitting here, whether there was a particular poll which indicated that the public understood that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. So you are not in a position to tell the Court under oath that the public did or did not understand compensation; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Some of it I think is common sense. But as far as a poll, a poll and some scientific enumeration, I don't recall that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Of course, common sense would be you could smoke more cigarettes and get more tar and nicotine?
A. I think what I meant by common sense is the same thing as the low fat recommendation, you can get the same amount of calories if you smoke more low-fat cookies -- I think common sense would be you would negate the benefits of a lower-yield cigarette if you smoked more of them.
Q. I don't mean this to be a rhetorical question, although maybe it is. When smokers compensate unconsciously, they can't then take steps to stop that since they don't know they are doing it; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I don't know how to answer
tha t .
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You say there is unconscious compens at ion?
A. I say I suspect it is possible.
Q. I am sorry. Maybe I misunderstood you.
I thought you told me you knew about unconscious compensation, you just didn't know when you first knew about it. Are you now telling me that it may not even exist?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Mischaracterizing the
testimony.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Is there unconscious compensation?
A. You know, if all we are meaning here is that smokers are not always aware of it, as opposed to a research question that has a specific definition of unconscious -- is that what we are talking about?
Q. No, sir, we are not. Do you understand that smoking -- that compensatory smoking behavior can be an unconscious activity?
A. I think it can be, yes.
Q. Now that we have clarified that, do you know when you first knew it could be an unconscious activity?
A. I said I didn't know that.
Q. But it is no longer a possibility, it can happen — it does happen?
A. I think it is possible to happen, yes.
Q. Are you aware of it being written about in the medical literature?
A. Compensation?
Q. Unconscious compensation?
A. You know, I am not entirely sure that I have seen those two words put together the way you are putting them together this morning and this afternoon.
Q. The way I phrase -- strike that.
Are you aware of some other phraseology that uses the term unconscious activity along with compensatory smoking behavior?
A. No.
Q. So that your report that you have given in this case does not rely upon any literature or
documents that references compensatory smoking behavior that is done as an unconscious behavior; is that correct?
MR, ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: In putting those two words together, no.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. They are not even together. They are separated by some words. Do you understand it the way I phrased it just now?
A. My assumption is that some compensatory smoking activity is not conscious. You are shaking your head.
Q. You and I are on different wavelengths. You did this search, this review, you said it was comprehensive in order for it to be done correctly. I am assuming you carried out a comprehensive review.
A. Yes.
Q. Are you aware, based on this comprehensive review, of any documents, literature, that talked about the fact that compensatory
behavior of smokers can be an unconscious activity?
A. I am not aware sitting here this afternoon that the public health community used the term unconscious in the same phrase or next to compensat ion.
Q. I am not talking about just public health. It is wide open, sir. Are you aware of any article, document published, unpublished or otherwise that discussed the fact, even -- not next to each other, the two words or phrases, but simply the idea that compensatory smoking behavior could be an unconscious activity? And if the answer is no, fine. If it is yes, just tell me what it is.
A. I am not sure I have seen the word used, as I said, together.
Q. So you are not aware of any such article; is that correct?
A. That uses the word unconscious.
Q. If, however, there is such a thing as unconscious compensatory smoking behavior, how do you get a smoker to deal with it so he doesn't
\
compensate?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: How do you — how did the public health community decide to deal with this i s sue?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Public health, medical doctor, someone in the field.
A. The way the public health community dealt with the issue of compensation is they believed, certainly since the mid-1970s, that the epidemiological data on low-yield cigarettes took compensation, at least compensation in the first form I talked about -- actually the second form in this discussion, smoking cigarettes more intensely, that the epidemiological studies took that into account; so, therefore, advising smokers on the third-tier recommendation, to smoke low-yield cigarettes, they were taking that into consideration.
Q. Let me make sure I understand. You simply told me that epidemiological studies that determined risks took that into consideration; is
that what you just said?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: What I said was that the public health community believed that studies, epidemiological studies such as the American Cancer Society CPS1, took the former compensation which dealt which dealt with the concept of smoking cigarettes more intensely, took that into consideration, so when those cigarettes showed there was a health benefit for people smoking-low yield cigarettes when compared to higher tar and nicotine cigarettes, it took that into account.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. That is not my question. What I asked you, sir, was not factoring in the risk factor, not looking at epidemiological studies, but how does a doctor, a public health official, in talking to a smoker, explain to him how to avoid unconscious compensation?
A. Well, the point is the way the public health community did that is it didn't make any difference that the smoker was compensating from
the point of view of an epidemiological study.
They did other things too in addition to basing the low tar recommendation on epidemiological studies. If you go and look at the public health pamphlets in the If You Must Smoke series that the federal government put out, they say don't smoke the cigarette down to the butt, take fewer puffs, they mention -- there are five ways not to smoke --Q. To consciously smoke.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: But you see, from the public health point of view, the epidemiological studies take into account, no matter how cigarette smokers are smoking those cigarettes, they still, in these studies that were published in the late '60s on into the '90s, showed no matter how they were smoked by smokers, that there was less risk, and that is what the public health community was basing its recommendation to smokers and what they advised physicians to tell smokers.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Epidemiological studies study large
groups of people. That is not advice to an individual, is it?
A. No, but that is certainly part of how physicians make their recommendations.
Q. You make your recommendation when somebody comes to you and says what about unconscious compensatory smoking, you tell them epidemiological studies take that into consideration?
A. No one ever asked me that question.
Q. If I were to ask you how do I deal with unconscious compensation, are you going to say to me, epidemiological studies -A. I will tell you not to smoke.
Q. If I tell you I am smoking anyway, are you going to tell me to go look at epidemiological studies and that ought to deal with unconscious compensation?
A. I wouldn't deal with it in those terms if I an adolescent that was smoking.
Q. If you had an adult, would you tell them about epidemiological studies as a method of
dealing with unconscious compensation?
A. I don't treat adults.
Q. Are you incapable of giving advice to adults?
A. My patients are children and adolescents.
0. So you don't claim expertise in how to give medical advice then to anybody older than whatever age group, up to the age group of ballpark 18; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: As a historian of medicine - -
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. As a doctor?
A. I can tell you generally what I do -- my practice goes up to 22. Occasionally friends ask.
I can tell you that.
Q. Do you have expertise in giving health advice to people that are not children?
A. I think my knowledge on smoking is such that I could give advice on that.
Q. Would you then give advice to somebody
that was smoking who was asking you about unconscious compensation, would your answer be go look at the epidemiological studies?
A. No. That is my job.
Q. How would the person smoking learn how to deal with unconscious compensation?
A. What I would tell them, after the first two tiers, would be if you must smoke, then I would tell them to smoke as low a yield cigarette as they could.
Q. How does that deal with unconscious compensat ion?
A. It deals with it in the sense that, again, based on the epidemiological studies, depending on -- it doesn't make any difference how smokers are smoking an individual cigarette.
Q. Epidemiological studies don't necessarily mean somebody is not going to get a cancer because it is a reduced risk, correct?
A. No. It has to do with the population.
Q. So that one individual might still get a cancer?
Q. But his risk of getting that cancer would be less if he didn't compensate?
A. I don't know that.
Q. Does compensation affect the likelihood somebody is going to get a disease from a cigarette?
A. I don't know that.
Q. In your review of the literature, as a history of medicine person, did you come across that?
A. I haven't come across that. What I have come across is —
Q. I don't care what you came across. I want to know if you came across this.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Answer to the extent you need to to fully answer.
THE WITNESS: Do you want to hear my
answer?
MR. ROSENTHAL: I want you to respond.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. If it is a pat answer you give to defend
the tobacco companies, no. But if it has to do with how you found that information, yes, I do want to hear it.
A. The decrease in the risk that would form the basis of the advice of low tar cigarettes came in many respects from the epidemiological studies. The epidemiological studies took compensation into effect in making that recommendation. Ask me a question. I am unaware of any study that tried to assign a differential risk due to compensation.
Q. Is there a reason then people were told not to compensate?
A. I think there is a common sense reason.
Q. But no medical evidence that compensation is going to impact risk in smoking cigarettes, based on your comprehensive review of the literature?
A. No, I am not aware of that.
Q. Just common sense would tell you that; that is all, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you think based upon common sense,
compensation effects risk of smoking?
A. I don't know that. I think it makes sense that if you take in less tar, that helps, but I don't know if that has been -- the issue of compensation, to know whether someone takes deeper puffs, if that has ever been shown in a scientific fashion.
Q. So that when people were smoking low tar but don't compensate, they had no basis, no scientific basis for saying compensation would affect that person's smoking and risk factors thereafter; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: What they were saying primarily was smoke low tar.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. They weren't telling people not to compensate?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: In the If You Must Smoke campaign, the five reasons to take fewer puffs and don't smoke down -- that was based on issues like
if people smoke fewer cigarettes, they would have less risk of lung cancer, but the primary scientific evidence was from the epidemiological studies which took that form of compensation into account.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. What study are you referencing for saying compensation was taken into account?
A. I am thinking of the CPS1.
Q. I assume you have looked at some of the data from CPS1?
A. I looked at the data published in the original CPS1.
Q. Tell me what you have looked at with regard to published data from CPS1?
A. That which occurred in the paper which was published in 1976. Now, as you know, some of those data have been reanalyzed as a — was reanalyzed by Dr. Garfinkel for number of cigarettes in '79 and '80, and I looked at that, and it was reanalyzed by Garfinkel and Tellman in articles in the '80s. Dr. Burns and his colleagues
have looked at it again in preparation of Monograph 13 and I have not seen those data other than some that were published in Monograph 13.
Q. Is there anything in CPS1 or any of the articles that say they are based upon the data from CPS1 that indicate that there is any reduction in risk in going from 16 -- 15 to 16 milligrams of tar to around 10 milligrams of tar?
A. CPS1, in the historical period, dealt with the reduction from a higher level to the level that you began your question with, because the cigarettes were rapidly changing during that period, and becoming less and less -- had less and less tar and nicotine. So how Dr. Hammond interpreted that in 1976 was that -- he was hopeful that with the trends of cigarettes having even less tar and nicotine in the future, currently and in the future, that the benefit would be even greater than what he found in CPS1.
Q. Don't care about hopeful. I don't care about what might be. I am asking you, is there any article, publication, based on CPS1 data that says
going from a 15 or 16-milligram tar cigarette to a ballpark 10-milligram cigarette is going to reduce risk?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection. Asked and
answered.
THE WITNESS: I will give you the same answer I did before.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Tell me the study and I will look it up and show it at trial.
A. As I said, how Dr. Hammond used those
data .
Q. What year?
✓
A. 1976.
Q. Let's make sure we are clear on the record. I am going to find a statement that says if you go from ballpark 15, 16 milligrams of tar to 10 milligrams of tar specifically, there is going to be a reduction in risk?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: What you are going to find is what I mentioned —
Q. I don't care what you mentioned -- what I am about is whether it says the reduction to those levels will reduce harm?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: What I can't tell you precisely is when Dr. Hammond made his predictions for the future, whether he tied it tightly to a 10-milligram cigarette.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q* He did or did not?
A. I can't tell you whether he mentioned 10 or not.
Q. Truth of the matter is none of those analyses looked at the issue of risk deduction from a 15- or 16-milligram tar cigarette to a 10-milligram tar cigarette, did they?
A. Based on CPS1?
Q. Right.
A. Yes, but I tried to mention to you that certainly Dr. Hammond -- Dr. Hammond certainly hoped and expected that there would be continuing
Q. Did you hear that I was not concerned about hope? I wanted hard data. And there is no hard data to that effect?
A. I believe that is correct.
Q. See, we went through a series of questions that you could have answered quickly. Help me if we can go through them faster.
The articles you mentioned, Garfinkel, Tellman, none of those analyzed any data that indicated a reduction in risk from 15 or 16 milligrams of tar down to ballpark 9 or 10?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: The ones I mentioned were ones that dealt with CPS1 data.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. So they do not deal with that issue?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I believe that is correct.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Is there any study that you have uncovered that discussed the reduction of risk
based on the data, whether it is from CPS1 or 2 or any other study, of a ballpark 15- or 16-milligram tar cigarette smoker going down to a 9- or 10-milligram tar smoker?
A. I can't give you the answer to that. I am unaware - -
Q. You are not aware of any.
A. Right.
Q. Now, you have testified that insurance companies are, in your opinion, considered part of public health; is that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you are aware, based upon your cross-examination at the Blue Cross Blue Shield trial, that the insurance company in that case claimed that the tobacco company had misled it; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I think that was one of the allegations.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. And in fact, at trial they went through
some statements where they said they had been misled by tobacco companies, under cross-examination, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Looks like you are going to show me that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You recall that as a general sense?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I can't remember.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Do you recall them reading interrogatories to you where they said that the insurance company said this is not information we had, that the tobacco companies had?
A. As I recall, there were 10 issues.
Q. That basically the insurance company said they had been misled in some fashion, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: That is my general recollection. As I remember, I tried to address three of those 10.
Q. You also testified in the Department of Justice case on behalf of United States of America against tobacco companies -- you didn't testify, but you were under oath in a deposition, correct?
A- Yes.
Q. And in that case it was the federal government claiming they were misled by the tobacco companies ?
A. I think that is one of the issues in that
case .
Q. Are you aware in this case we have here, or from other cases, that various public health officials have made allegations in sworn statements or in depositions that they have been misled by the tobacco companies?
A. I am aware of some of those, yes.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Do you rely upon any discussion or conversation you had with insurance company executives for any of your testimony or any
opinions you gave in the Blue Cross Blue Shield?
A . No .
Q. Do you rely upon any conversations you have had with any federal government employee for any opinions or conclusions you came to in the Department of Justice case?
A. No.
Q. And in the case we are having here today, do you rely upon any conversations you have had with public health officials for any of the opinions or conclusions you have drawn?
A. No.
Q. And have you had any discussions or conversations with tobacco company executives or researchers or scientists for any of the opinions or conclusions you have in any of these cases?
A. No.
Q. You have made statements both in this report and in your testimony that public health officials directly urged tobacco companies to make cigarettes safer by reducing tar and nicotine; does that sound right?
A. They urged them to make lower tar cigarettes, yes.
Q. And the purpose was what?
A. The public health community believed that low-yield cigarettes were safer.
Q. Now, is it your understanding that until the public health officials were telling them they needed to do this, that the tobacco companies were not looking into low tar cigarettes as possible marketing opportunities?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: The public health community's recommendations to the tobacco industry I think began with roughly Dr. Wynder's comments and certainly accelerated in the mid-1960s. Cigarette companies were beginning to manufacture cigarettes that were lower in tar and nicotine from the earlier point of view, certainly in sort of the mid-1950s onward.
BY MR. BRICKMAN;
Q. Are you aware that they were marketing or beqinninq their marketinq plans for those back in
the '50s in order to capture what they referred to as "the health market”?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I am not sure I do understand that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware that they marketed these low tar cigarettes not because public health was urging them but because they thought they could make money in selling them?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't know what the motivation behind that marketing strategy was.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You are not saying they responded to public health, because you don't know why they did it, do you?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I can't tell you their motivation entirely for that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You couldn't tell me what their intent
was before, so I am assuming you can't tell me what their intent was now, can you?
A. I can't tell you -- certainly the public health community urged, and they continued to make cigarettes that were lower in tar and nicotine. Since I haven't looked and I haven't seen -- I can't say what the entire mix was in their decision-making.
Q. Some of your answers previously have been a little vague. You are not going to say under oath you know for a fact or can opine based upon facts that tobacco companies sold their low tar cigarettes as a result of public health officials urging them to, are you?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think it is a reasonable supposition because certainly that was the recommendation that was strongly coming from the public health community.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. But that is just an assumption on your
part ?
A. Certainly the tobacco companies joined in with the Tobacco Working Group to work toward a safer cigarette, so in that sense -- in that sense they showed they were responding because they were cooperating with that public health --
Q. When was that?
A. Tobacco Working Group?
Q. Yes.
A. 1968 until it was abandoned in 1977.
Q. Are you aware that they had been already marketing these low tar cigarettes before the Tobacco Working Group came out?
A. Sure.
Q. Did the tobacco companies come out with a safer cigarette as a result of the work with the Tobacco Working Group?
A. What they did --
Q. Did they come out with a cigarette?
A. They came out with many cigarettes. They certainly incorporated many of the recommendations the Tobacco Working Group had formulated.
Q. Which were those recommendations?
A. There were a number of them that were put out dealing with porous papers, ventilated filters, puffed tobacco, using reconstituted tobacco sheets.
Q. Tell me which of those Philip Morris didn't already know about before the Tobacco Working Group came up with these -A. What the Tobacco Working Group did was to show that each one of these technologies yielded fewer skin cancers on rodents, and that particular knowledge is what was new. So basically they showed that these particular technologies made a difference in animal experiments, anyway.
Q. So they tested these various things you just gave me for animal experiments, paper, porosity and whatever the things were?
A. Yes.
Q. But Philip Morris already had these, didn't they?
A. I can't tell you precisely what they had.
Q. It would be interesting to have the item in your product and then test it afterwards, that wouldn't be good public health policy, would it?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I think it is good public health policy to know what they have and to test i t .
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Don't you think they -- don't you think it makes better public health sense to test it before you let humans use it?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: As a general rule, yes.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are there any exceptions to that rule?
A. I can't think of any.
Q. Since we are taking about the Tobacco Working Group, the tobacco companies touted a safer cigarette with lower tar and nicotine, correct?
A. I am not aware that the cigarette companies ever advertised low tar cigarettes as being safer.
Q. Didn't the Tobacco Working Group say you could have a safer cigarette under certain circumstances?
A. There are two articles that Gio Gori published, one in '76 and one in '78, that gave a prescription for that.
Q. Based upon his work with the Tobacco Working Group and the tobacco companies, correct?
A. In my reading of the documents though, there was never a vote by the Tobacco Working Group that Dr. Gori should public with that.
Q. Did they disavow that?
A. Of course, the whole committee was disbanded shortly thereafter -- actually in between the two documents.
Q. Did tobacco companies and Philip Morris disavow Dr. Gori?
A. I don't know if they did or not.
Q. Are you aware if they said this guy is
nuts?
A. I am not aware of that.
Q. Are you aware that he went to work for one of the companies?
A. I am not aware of that.
Tobacco Working Group was shut down was because Dr. Gori was too close to industry?
A. I am certainly have not seen that.
Q.	Have you seen any documents that the
tobacco companies were going to use the government and the Tobacco Working Group as a method of advertising their lower tar cigarettes?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I have not seen that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Now, you have testified on behalf of not just Philip Morris but, I believe, several other tobacco companies, correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. Furthermore, even when they were selling these low tar cigarettes, the tobacco companies like Philip Morris, they were also offering to consumers the higher tar cigarettes, weren't they?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you have any information, sir, as to when the public became aware that the FTC tar and nicotine numbers were not what the individual
smoker was actually receiving?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, certainly within the very first press release when the FTC. announced to the public -- it contained in that message that the machine measurements were not going to be what the actual smoker received.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. So is it your understanding then that the public knew at that point in time?
A. Certainly that is when it was announced.
Q. I didn't ask you that. There is one thing in having information out there -- there is a difference between what people comprehended and took in versus what was out there, correct?
A. Yes, but the message with these rating systems, in every one I can recall sitting here, always had in there, as part of all these lists, always had in there, as measured by the FTC machine.
Q. So you assumed -- strike that.
Do you have any hard data to indicate the
public was aware that the Federal Trade Commission tar and nicotine numbers -- they were not what consumers were actually getting when they were smoking the cigarettes?
A. You mean potentially not what they were getting?
Q. Potentially.
A. My assumption is they knew that. Was there a poll that would indicate that? As I sit here this afternoon, as I sat here this morning, I can't recall one.
Q. Are you aware of various scientists, public health officials who have stated on the record that they were not aware of that?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: That that they were not aware that the FTC method did not measure -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. What a smoker was inhaling, yes, sir.
A. No, I am not aware of that. I would have to see the document and see what the context was of that statement, but certainly people -- public
health officials who were involved in making low tar recommendations and things like that certainly knew that it was a machine average - - not an average, a machine rated number. So I would have to see the document to sort of put it in context.
Q. My question simply is are you aware of any such?
A. I can't recall any.
Q. Are you aware of any testimony by Philip Morris executives under oath that they did not understand that concept up until the early to mid-'90s?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection. Asked and
answered.
THE WITNESS: I am not aware of that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware of the head of Philip Morris USA making such statements?
A. I am not aware of that.
Q. Are you aware of any public health official stating that consumers did not understand they were -- that the FTC numbers were not the
numbers that they were getting when they actually smoked the cigarettes?
A. I can't recall any.
Q. You know, about a year or so ago, you said you had not read Monograph 7; have you read it since then?
A. Monograph 7?
Q. Yes. This one right here.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I have a strong suspicion that mischaracterizes the testimony.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. When did you read Monograph 7?
A. I can't remember what context I read it.
I may have said something like that I have not read it totally from beginning to end.
Q. When did you read the whole thing, if
e ver ?
A. I have read two to three articles in it and I think I have looked at all of it, but I probably would have read it -- certainly would have read it before a year ago.
Q. The whole thing?
Q. Are you aware during the '70s and '80s that Philip Morris had a smoking machine that could mimic human smoking?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, form.
THE WITNESS: I am aware that they had a machine that worked in a different fashion than the Cambridge method. I am not sure -- the conclusion that it more closely mimicked human smoking, I am not sure if that was ever validated, but I think — they had a slightly different machine.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. What do you understand the difference
wa s ?
A. I don't know. I know I have seen that in other cases that I have been involved with, but the conclusion that you reached that it mimicked human smoking better is the part -- I know they had a different machine. I don't know if it was better.
Q. Do you know what difference it had from the FTC method?
A. No.
Q. Do you know whether it could be adjusted to different above volumes?
A. I don't know. What I do know is they made it available to the FTC as part of the Barclay discuss ion - -
Q. They made what available?
A. I think they made the machine available.
I	think I read that. How the machine worked and how it was different from the Cambridge method, I can't help you on that.
Q. Now, are you aware that when the FTC looked at possibly changing their method of measuring tar and nicotine, that Philip Morris opposed it?
A. In what year?
Q. Any year.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, form.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware of that or not?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, form.
THE WITNESS: I am aware of that in 1983, in their major investigation as part of the
Barclay.
Q. Are you aware of subsequent years in which they opposed changing the FTC method?
A. No .
Q. You haven't looked at subsequent years?
A. Eighty-three I know in detail because I know what the various tobacco companies came down on different issues because of that one because that part of the proceedings. What I don't know, in subsequent years, in other discussions with the FTC, whether Philip Morris committed opinions.
Q. Are you aware of -- we touched on this earlier today. Let me just make sure. Are you aware of Philip Morris claiming that as of 1994, compensation had not been established by reliable data?
A. No, I am not aware of that.
Q. You are not a psychologist, are you?
A. No, I am not a psychologist.
Q. Are you aware, however, of certain tenets or principles of psychology that have been applied
to smokers and why they continue to smoke?
A. I have done some reading in it. I don't know I would be able to answer some of your questions on that or not.
Q. Are you familiar based on your history of medicine and analysis of efforts on the part of Philip Morris to provide a psychological crutch to consumers so that they would continue smoking?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I am not aware of that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware of any efforts on Philip Morris to help smokers rationalize continuing to smoke ?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I am not aware of that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. If there were such efforts, would you consider that efforts to frustrate public health policy?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
measure, first tier, don't start. Second tier, stop, and if you must smoke, smoke low tar -- so in the sense that they were producing low tar cigarettes, I guess it supports at least the low tar component of the public health message.
BY MR. BRICKMAN;
Q. Do you think that is what public health really wanted individuals to do?
A. I think what public health people wanted was stop and don't start, but they also realized that there were millions of residual smokers that presented a public health problem that needed addressing, and for them, for those smokers, they thought that the best approach was low tar cigarettes.
Q. But for those smokers who would otherwise quit except for the fact that there was a low tar cigarette out there, would that be good to promote that low tar cigarette?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
MR. BRICKMAN: Strike that. Forget that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Tell me what you are aware of that Philip Morris did to keep people from quitting smoking?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I am not aware of anything.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware of any efforts Philip Morris took to tell smokers that cigarette smoking was not harmful?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I am not sure in precisely those terms. I know there were some public statements about causation that tobacco companies made, but I am not sure -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. No, sir. I am not concerned about the causation. I am talking about statements where tobacco company executives even after 1964, even after 1970, said cigarette smoking is not harmful. A. I am aware of some of those statements,
yes .
Q. Would you agree those statements are misleading?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: A couple of things about that. I have seen some of those press releases. I have seen almost no -- I haven't seen press coverage of those. The issue is was anybody misled by them especially when you have the surgeon general standing up there staying cigarettes are deadly, the American Cancer society, American Heart Association, every other public health official in the country saying cigarettes were dangerous and harmful. I simply don't think anyone was misled.
Q. Was it -- strike that.
A. Certainly the public -- I realize there was a pause there. But certainly if you look at public opinion polls, it comes very close to even universal understanding that cigarettes are dangerous.
Q. Was it a lie?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: My understanding of the word lie means is intent. I have no idea of what the intent of making those statements were.
Q. What is your supposition?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: If you look at the context of many of those statements, they are usually -were usually done in the context of some particular scientific report that had been released recently, and so oftentimes they were meant to counteract a particular fact or something in that scientific report. So I think it is important to put each within in their context.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware of statements made by Face the Nation by the head of Philip Morris that cigarettes are not hazardous?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: What was the year and what was the context of that?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Do you have a statement to show Dr. English?
MR. BRICKMAN: I have plenty of them. I want to see how good this guy is.
A. What is the --
Q. Are you aware of the statement on Face the Nation in 1971 that cigarettes are not hazardous?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware of that or not?
A. I can't remember if I read that specific one, but I assume he was asked the question or he was on a panel or something that we could then -- I could intelligently respond to your question.
Q. If he said, "We do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous," is that a truthful statement ?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Can you give me -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. No, no, no. Tell me, is that statement in 1971 a truthful statement?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: If the question was do you think, in 1971, seven years after the surgeon general's report, that cigarettes cause lung cancer?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I am not saying that* Are they hazardous? Do you know what the word hazardous means - -
A. I am trying to answer the question --
Q. I withdraw the question. Do you know what the word hazardous means?
A. To me it means causing harm.
Q. Can cigarettes cause harm?
A. Of course.
Q. Was there any question in 1971 cigarettes could cause harm?
A. In the context of cigarettes causing lung cancer and lung cancer being harm, yes.
Q. Could cigarettes cause harm in 1971?
A. Yes.
Q. Was that accepted in your opinion?
conclusion and it was my conclusion in 1971.
Q. Do you know anybody that honestly believed in 1971 cigarettes could not cause harm?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: The question in 1971 was do cigarettes cause lung cancer -BY MR- BRICKMAN:
Q. That was not my question. Did you know anyone in 1971 that believed that cigarettes were harmful? I did not limit it to lung cancer. You are evading the question.
MR. ROSENTHAL: The witness is not being
evasive.
THE WITNESS: We are now devoid of this particular comment where we established I don't have the context of that -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I am asking you did anybody in your opinion honestly believe that cigarettes were not hazardous in 1971?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
community did not believe that. Could someone hold a different opinion? Of course.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Do you think tobacco company executives honestly could hold that opinion?
A. I think it is possible.
Q. Do you consider the tobacco company executives irrational in some fashion?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I have no basis.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Rational people could have thoughts like that, that it may not be harmful?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I have no -- can rational people have what now?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Can rational people think that tobacco was not harmful in 1971?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Certainly the public health community didn't feel that.
Q. That was not my question. Could a rational person believe in 1971 that cigarette smoking was not harmful?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I think so, yes.
MR. ROSENTHAL: We have been going about an hour. Want to take a break?
MR. BRICKMAN: Sure.
VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now going off the video record at 2:15# and this is the end of tape
2	.
(Discussion off the record.)
(Recess.)
VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now back on the video record. The time is 2:30 p.m., and this is the start of tape 3.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. What is the latency period for tobacco related lung cancer?
A. About 20 years, at least.
Q. So that if there are -- when you say 20
years or so, is that a median number, is that the earliest period within the latency range, what do you mean by that 20 years?
A. Usually the public health community has given it in terms of 20 years or longer.
Q. A minimum of 20 years is typically given as the latency period?
A. Usually. Doesn't mean there couldn't be a problem earlier.
Q. As a general rule, however, we would not expect to see cancers relating from the sale of Marlboro Lights until 20 years after they went on the market; is that correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: That would be correct.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. So any study that came out with data, ballpark, before 1990 would be unlikely to have specific information about the cancer risk as a result of the specific cigarette, Marlboro light?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Well, these epidemiological
studies, I don't know whether they included Marlboro Lights as such. Probably ones even before Marlboro Lights were introduced, which I believe was in the early '70s, dealt with cigarettes that were like Marlboro Lights in milligrams, I believe, so I am not sure that there couldn't be some recommendations based on cigarettes that are similar.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. But actually, cigarettes differ in the amount of cancer causing agents they have in them, don't they?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: You mean in a pack of a cigarettes, in the 20 cigarettes, there are differences among those 20 cigarettes?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. No. Let me explain better. A Marlboro Light may have more or less tobacco-specific nitrosamines than a Winston light?
A. I don't know that.
Q. You don't know that?
Q. You didn't factor that in in any consideration of epidemiological studies in comparing various light cigarettes?
A . No .
Q. Are you aware of different mutagenicity levels of different cigarettes?
A. I know about mutagenicity tests. I am not sure I am aware of any specific mutagenicity scores with any particular cigarette.
Q. What is a mutagenicity test?
A. They were developed in the 1970s as a way of, I guess, screening, I guess would be the way to put that -- let me back up. Carcinogenicity in the 1970s, let's say when the Tobacco Working Group was working or Wynder before that, involved painting tars on the backs of mice week after week, month after month, year after month. That was the gold standard for animal testing, but it took a look period of time. Mutagenicity tests were developed, and a quite a few of them, in the 1970s as a way to shortcut or screen potential substances that might
be carcinogens, so that it could happen -- so you wouldn't have to wait months and months and years and years. Mutagenicity is not the same as carcinogenicity and I am not sure you can relate scores, but it was sort of a screening test.
Q. A red flag?
A. I think that is safe to say.
Q. And if you have a high mutagenicity score, it is a red flag that you need to do more invest igat ion?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I am not sure how to interpret thresholds and high and low and whether a high level is more likely to correspond -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Some level corresponds such that you have a red flag raised?
A. I think the correspondence is with the red flag. It is the two or three steps down the line -- my understanding is this started a cascade effect. Then the scientists would go to another level and eventually they would get to those animal
skin paintings if they passed all those tests.
Q. Are you aware of mutagenicity studies on light cigarettes?
A. No .
Q. You didn't come across that in any of your comprehensive review?
A. I think the Tobacco Working Group did some work on mutagenicity, but I can't this afternoon say in what way it was down. It would have made sense for them to have done this because they were in the business in the early '70s when these studies were started. I suspect they did, but I can't --
Q. Do you rely upon any mutagenicity testing for any of the opinions you have in this case -A. No.
Q. Or any opinions on smoking and tobacco related to health?
A. No.
Q. Do you know how much money tobacco companies spent on advertising low tar cigarettes?
A. No.
Q. Are you aware of tobacco company efforts to implicitly state in their advertisements that low tar cigarettes are in fact safer?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form:
THE WITNESS: I don't know if that is what they are saying or not.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Have you made any analysis in your comprehensive review of articles or documents or anything to indicate that in fact the tobacco industry, including Philip Morris, were putting in implicit statements of safety with their low tar cigarettes?
A. In advertisements?
Q. Yes.
A. I haven't studied advertisements, so I can't —
Q. Not just your own analysis of the advertisements, but are you aware of other documents or other people that have studied that and come to that conclusion?
A. Yes, I am aware of that.
Q. Do you have any reason to disagree with those people?
A. I haven't gone through them in any particular way. I am not aware that tobacco companies ever said that low tar is safer.
Q. You are aware that people have written that the tobacco companies have implied within their ads that they are in fact safe?
A. I have read that.
Q. Do you have any information to indicate that is not the case?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Certainly when I look at ads, every ad that I have seen has a big warning/ surgeon general says this is causing cancer involved there. It has the tar and nicotine ratings on it. I am not sure I do accept that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:	.....
Q. You have made an analysis of all of the
ads ?
A. No, I have not made an analysis. When I have seen an ad, there is not an ad that doesn't
have the cancer warning or heart disease warning or pregnancy warning, stop now and you will be better warning.
Q. I am not saying that the tobacco company is saying they are safe, simply that they are saying it is safer than high tar cigarettes -- they are implying that, rather.
A. You would have to show me the ad and we would have to look at it.
Q. Other than your own opinion with regard to the ads you have seen, and, again, you haven't done a systematic analysis, I know that, other than your opinion, do you have any information to indicate that is not correct?
A. Well, I do know in their public statements, at least the ones I have read, they have certainly never made that claim in a statement. That is sort of an indirect answer to your question. I can't think as I am sitting here that they have ever testified before Congress or anything to say that low tar cigarettes were safer.
Q. I am talking about people that have
analyzed their advertisements for the imagery and verbiage they used.
A. I haven't read that literature, so I can't tell you.
Q. You don't have any information that that is not correct?
A. I have given you some information why I think it is unlikely, but I have not analyzed all of those data.
Q. Are you aware of Philip Morris document statements where they say implicitly within our own ads is the assumption that less tar and less nicotine represent a safer cigarettes?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Do you have a document?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I sure do. I have it. Are you aware of
it?
A. I can't recall seeing that.
Q. Do you base any of your opinions such as you have just given me upon any document that indicates that Philip Morris said implicitly in our
ads is the assumption that less tar and nicotine represents a safer cigarette?
A. No .
Q. Such a statement would be contrary to your opinion? A statement that Philip Morris said implicitly in our ads is the statement that less tar is safer -- you haven't drawn that conclusion -- in fact, you said you assumed just the opposite?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form. Mischaracterizes the testimony.
THE WITNESS: I have not seen a public statement by Philip Morris saying that low tar cigarettes were safer.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. That is not my question. My question to you, sir, is -- and maybe you have changed your mind in the last minute or two -- did you see anything indicating that implicitly in their ads they were trying to convey the message that less tar and nicotine means safer?
A. Can you show me the ad so we have
something we can actually be looking at?
Q. I could do lots of things, but I am not. What I am asking you is you, as the alleged expert on the history of this topic, are you aware of any such information? You can go through your reliance list, you can tell me what you have -- you could have brought all your boxes of documents, you could have brought all your filing cabinets. I assume you chose not to for some reason, but based upon your review, are you aware of anything to indicate that Philip Morris was implicitly stating to consumers that less tar and nicotine means safer?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I really can't say without seeing the document. Certainly the public health community was saying that. I can't necessarily tell in the low tar ads that I have seen, that I have seen the implicit statement that they are safer, but maybe if you have an ad, I can make a comment.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You are not aware of any such evidence,
Q. And you are not aware of the document where Philip Morris discussed such implicit assumptions within their ads, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't recall it.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Now, would you agree with me that tobacco companies like Philip Morris fought public health on issues of environmental tobacco smoke and the harm it causes?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: You had your hand up. Thought or fought?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q . Fought.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I am not sure if that is the case or not. There has been a long public health discussion on the dangers of environmental tobacco smoke and so you would have to pull out the
Philip Morris document and let's see what they were saying and at one particular historical moment to see if we can put it into context.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware of any effort -A. I am not finished. You said fought the public health community. The public health community was divided on the dangers of environmental tobacco smoke depending on the year in which environmental tobacco smoke was being considered. As a historian, you need to show me the document, the context, and I can give you a opinion.
Q. I am asking you if you are aware of any effort at any point in time by the tobacco companies to fight public health officials on the concept of environmental tobacco smoke. If you are, you are. If you are not, fine. I am asking if you are aware of any such instance?
A. Come back to the word fight. You know it is perfectly legitimate for people to offer other sets of opinions or other studies perhaps of a
given scientific topic which is not necessarily a fight. It is a contribution to the discussion.
That is why I say you need to provide me with a document in the context, and then maybe I can help you .
Q. I am just asking you, are you aware of any efforts on behalf of public health officials to fight tobacco groups?
A. I thought I answered that.
Q. You didn't do a very good job. Are you aware at any point in time of tobacco companies such as Philip Morris opposing efforts by public health officials with regard to environmental tobacco smoke?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection, form.
THE WITNESS: In any jurisdiction in the
country?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Yes, sir.
A. I think there may have been some jurisdictions where companies such as Philip Morris may have opposed regulation, but again, I would
have to go back to the specifics of the situation.
Q. Are you aware of Philip Morris opposing public health efforts to ban tobacco advertising on billboards?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I am not specifically aware
of that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware of Philip Morris efforts to oppose public health efforts to ban advertising in sporting events?
A. These are all things that were eventually covered in the master settlement agreement which they entered into. In the negotiations leading up to that, what their negotiations were, I can't help you .
Q. You are not aware of them opposing public health efforts to ban advertising at sporting events, are you?
A. I think there may have been times in local and state regulations where companies, I don't know whether they are Philip Morris or not,
have opposed local regulations. All of the ones you mentioned are part of the master settlement agreement that Philip Morris entered into.
Q. You are not saying they entered into them because they were good guys?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: They entered into them.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. They were about to get hit with big judgments in state court.
A. I am sure they thought it was in their best interests, but they entered into it.
Q. Do you think they entered into it because they are good guys?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: It is certainly speculative. I can't tell you why they did it. I think it could certainly be because they were facing litigation by 40 attorneys general, but I don't know what went into their decision-making.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Do you consider the tobacco companies
admirable companies?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Admirable companies?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Yes.
A. They make a legal product.
Q. Does that make them admirable?
A. Yes.
Q. If it were up to you, would you ban all cigarettes in this country?
A. Hell, no. One of the things history will tell you is what happened with alcohol and prohibition in the '20s, when you had millions of people who want to consume, I think that would be — would open up tremendous problems.
Q. Are you in favor of allowing people to smoke marijuana?
A. That is a difficult question. I am concerned that -- about marijuana to a degree as a pathway to other drugs, not from a medical point of view as concerned about that, but I would have to think about that.
Q. Which cases more disease, marijuana smoke or tobacco?
A. Tobacco.
Q. Are you aware of Philip Morris' efforts to oppose putting on warning labels on their cigarette packs?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: In 1965?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Any time.
A. I know they entered into decisions. Congress decided what went on cigarette parks.
Q. Is entering into discussion a euphemism for opposed it?
A. I think they had a right to do that.
Q. I am asking you is that a euphemism for having opposed to it?
A. Certainly they had to a right to it. Certainly when Congress passed the wording, they complied.
Q. They didn't have a choice. It would have been against the law, wouldn't it?
Q. Do you have a problem saying they opposed public health efforts in certain areas?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You use the phraseology entered into the debate. You and I both know they opposed it.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I am not specifically aware of what Philip Morris' position was in 1965.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Your review of the literature company was so comprehensive that you don't know whether Philip Morris opposed putting on the warning labels in '64-'65? I just want to make sure the Court understand how comprehensive you were.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't specifically know what Philip Morris' position was.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware of efforts by Philip Morris to stop Dr. Wynder from making public statements
about the hazards of cigarette smoke?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Would that be contemptible in your eyes?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I would have to see the context of that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Tell me under what context that would be acceptable.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I would have to see the
context.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Is that ever acceptable to you, that they would try to muzzle Dr. Wynder in talking about smoking being implicated in carcinoma causation?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I haven't seen the document you are talking about and I am not aware of the context they could have muzzled him, and I am aware
that he certainly wasn't muzzled, so it is hard to know what to make of the document, but you didn't show that to me.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Hard to imagine an admirable company trying to muzzle Dr. Wynder, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: He certainly wasn't
muz zled.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Do you know if they tried to muzzle him? A. I don't know.
Q. Do you know of efforts to attack Dr. Oscar Auerbach in his research?
A. Certainly Dr. --Q. Let's strike that.
Are you aware of efforts by Philip Morris specifically to attack the research done by Dr. Auerbach linking smoking with cancer, or do we have the euphemism entered into debate?
MR. ROSENTHAL: I object to the colloquy.
looking at is the Beagle experiments in 1970 as opposed to his autopsy studies in the 1950s and 1960s. When he published those studies there was an enormous controversy in the public health and scientific literature as well as in tobacco company researchers as well as to the validity of his research and the conclusions that he reached. For example, this was done as part of the Tobacco Working Group and I know the Tobacco Working Group had concerns about those studies and sent a subsection of the Tobacco Working Group to a laboratory on two or three or maybe more occasions to talk over that, so subsequently when the surgeon general's reports in he 1980s and the IARC decided that Dr. Auerbach had not achieved the cancers that he thought he had done. So this is a long way, I know, from your point of view, around the question, but I think there were a lot of people who were upset with Dr. Auerbach's studies and the conclusions or the interpretations he had reached.
(Discussion off the record due to technical difficulties with the reporter.)
VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now back on the video record. The time is 2:58 p.m.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Dr. English, that was not my question. I agree, however, it was long-winded. Are you aware of Philip Morris making efforts to attack Dr. Auerbach in his research, just Philip Morris?
A. The issue is the Beagle experiments?
Q. Any work that he had been doing?
A. The only one I am aware of that companies commented --
Q. Just Philip Morris. I want to know if you know about Philip Morris?
A. I can't as I sit here know whether Philip Morris was part of that. I think so, but I am not sure.
Q. Are you aware of them trying to get Dr. Gori to make the issue of Dr. Auerbach's experiments a controversial issue?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware of various efforts by Philip Morris and other tobacco companies to usurp any publicity the surgeon general would get with any of its reports when they came out?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Usurp?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Take over, not give them any publicity, take over the headlines. Are you aware of any effort they made to do it?
A. As I recall, there has been some discussion about the 1979 surgeon general's report and perhaps an issuing of a Tobacco Institute report a day or two ahead of the surgeon general's issuing of the report. That is the only one I can think of.
Q. Are you aware of public efforts by Philip Morris to stop the Dow Company from putting out anti-smoking material in publicizing their nicotine patches?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
Q. Are you aware of efforts by Philip Morris to put up or create organizations, allegedly grassroots organizations that were made up of Philip Morris executives or -- in order to give the impression that the public was against certain efforts of public health legislation?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: If you have something you can show me, but I am not aware of any.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Your comprehensive research didn't include that?
A. That is correct.
Q. Are you aware of efforts by Philip Morris to not put warning labels on cigarette packages in countries outside of the United States?
MR. ROSENTHAL: What could this possibly have to do with this case?
MR. BRICKMAN: Goes to the basis of his statement that this is an admirable company.
Q. You don't think other countries are so different than us they shouldn't get warning labels, do you?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think that is up to the country that you are dealing with. I think people in other countries have the ability to have their own public health programs, and as far as tobacco is concerned, there are countries with much more restrictive legislation, the EU, for example, so I can't make a comment. But I don't think the United States should dictate what form a tobacco program should take into another country.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Can you imagine any scenario where a warning label on a cigarette pack wouldn't be a good thing to do from a public health standpoint, no matter what country you are in?
A. I agree with warnings, I think they should be there.
Q. Should be on the pack?
A. Ye s.
Q. And any effort to oppose that would be wrong?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: We would have to know the context of that. I have been in favor of warnings since they were issued in 1966.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you aware of Philip Morris licensing its name and logo to candy makers to make candy c igare 11es ?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No, I am not aware of that.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Would you think that would not be a good
idea?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Actually, I chewed candy cigarette gum when I was a youth.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
A. I don't know. It was probably before Marlboro was a brand. Didn't lead to me smoking, I know that.
Q- Are you thinking that is an okay idea?
A. I would not recommend that cigarette candy be made, no.
Q. In the Blue Cross Blue Shield testimony you gave, you cited a study called the Sabbath study. Does that ring a bell to you?
A. I did?
Q. Yes, sir.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Sabbath as in -MR. BRICKMAN: Sabbath as in Sunday. I would be happy to get the page.
THE WITNESS: That does not ring a bell.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Having been there, that was one of the worst court reporters I have ever seen.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I will show you the transcript of May 1, 2001, and I am going to look at page 5420 and specifically line 5. There is a Dr. Sabbath, and
let me ask you if there is any such doctor to your knowledge?
A. I think that must be Sammet.
Q. I just wanted to be sure I wasn't missing something. We looked all over for Dr. Sabbath.
You have also stated that the public had a tendency not to believe the statements of tobacco company executives and their representatives. Do you recall that?
A. I think what I said was that the public has revealed in public opinion polls -- certainly got the public health community's message that cigarettes were dangerous and could kill.
Q. Is it your belief then that the American public did not believe what tobacco executives were saying in their public statements?
A. I think when you compare what tobacco company executives were saying, the trickle that were saying there is an avalanche from the public health community, it is my belief that the American public looked to the public health community for these issues. I don't think they turned to the
tobacco industry at all.
Q. That is not my question. My question is is it your opinion that the American public did not find the statements of the tobacco companies credible?
A. I think given the total mix of what the American people were given, whether it is from kindergarten health program to an ad to a public health statement of a Public Health Service announcement, I think they followed the public health community rather than the industry.
Q. Is that because they did not believe the tobacco companies?
A. I think largely that is the case.
Q. The information that you rely on in your reliance statement, do you have computerized versions of these documents?
A. No.
Q. Do you have computerized analyses of these documents?
A. No.
Q. Is the only method you have for analyzing
these the notes you have on your versions?
A . Ye s .
Q. Have you ever made any written notes other than on the documents themselves, other than maybe formal reports have you written?
A. There may be Post-Its on some of them to indicate a particular paragraph that I wanted to remember to go back to, especially in thick documents, but my standard procedure is to write on the document I have.
Q. And where do you keep these documents?
A. In my office.
Q. And they are all cataloged in some fashion?
A. I wish.
Q. But they are someplace where if I issued a subpoena to get them copied, I could do it?
A. Yes.
Q. Were you ever told by anybody on behalf of the tobacco companies or their representatives not to keep written notes?
Q. When you did the work on the lead industry, did you keep written notes?
A. Same procedure, I write on the documents I have. There is a little difference with lead in the sense that I have written a book on it.
Q. So you have written notes, just because you wrote a book?
A. I wrote a book -- actually I don't have written notes --
Q. Typed notes?
A. I have computer files that are written as I made additions and subtractions over it. It is not a written file.
Q. Something on your computer somewhere?
A. An old computer.
Q. Have you talked to other people that are witnesses in this case?
A. No .
Q. Did anybody help you draft your report in this case?
A. James Rosenthal.
Q. The gentleman to your left?
Q. You submitted drafts and he made corrections?
A. Didn't make suggestions. I wrote the report and James made changes to that and that kind of thing. It is my report, but he helped in that regard.
Q. Stylistic changes?
A. For the most part.
Q. That is what the other witnesses say too. You guys are good at stylistic changes.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Your witnesses said the same thing.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Is that a euphemism?
A. Euphemism for what?
Q. Changing substance to your report?
A . No .
Q. In your review primarily of the public health documents but also some government documents, are you aware that the -- it is sort of obvious, that the push that was being made for low
tar cigarettes was in the hope that they would cause less cancers in the people smoking them than in the higher tar cigarettes; is that correct?
A. That is correct. And other diseases as
well .
Q. But the basic premise was they were being pushed because they were hopefully less harmful?
A. By the public health community, yes.
Q. And is it your understanding that the public acted upon these statements and went to low tar cigarettes in the hopes that they would be less harmful and safer?
A. It is actually a more complicated question. Certainly they went to them. If you look at sales-weighted averages of cigarettes, they are far lower in tar and nicotine now than they were in 1954. The question what the public sought in these, that is actually covered in a chapter in Monograph 13, chapter 6 is a review of some of the public opinion polls that deal with what people actually sought, but certainly in that mix was that the people were responding to the public health
message that it would cause less disease.
Q. Are you also aware of any documents in your review where consumers perceived a less harsh cigarette to be less harmful to them?
A. I think in some of these polls where people talked about wanting milder taste as being a cigarette that was less -- having less tar, that that may get to the question you are talking about. Harsh might mean more tar, but beyond that I can't really go.
Q. You are not certain, but there may be some -- strike that.
There is some indication that some consumers took that harshness to correlate with higher tar and therefore a more harmful cigarette, correct?
A. I think there is a common sense to that, but as far as the actual whole, I can't think of harsh and high tar being related.
Q. Maybe they were using the word milder, but would you agree with me that they often equated a milder cigarette with something lower in tar and
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think some people probably did. I think in my reading of the public opinion polls about why people smoked, some people -- you asked sort of a three-part question there, milder taste was less tar and nicotine and safer, and the polls don't ask those three together. So it is hard to say with specificity.
MR. BRICKMAN: We are done. Thank you
very much.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I have a couple of
questions.
MR. BRICKMAN: I suspect it will led me to ask a few questions.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I understand.
EXAMINATION BY COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT
BY MR. ROSENTHAL:
Q. Occasionally I will characterize what your testimony will be. I don't have the transcript in front of me. If in any way my characterization is incorrect, please let me know.
I think you testified relatively early this morning that you were not aware specifically as to how Philip Morris made Marlboro Lights compared to Marlboros.
A. That is right.
Q. Is that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you have a general understanding of the types of techniques that have been employed to make lower tar cigarettes as opposed to regular or full flavor cigarettes?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. And what is that general understanding of the types of techniques that have been used?
A. The ones in general that the TWG recommended in paper, porosity, packaging, selection of tobacco blends, use of ventilated filters.
Q. I also believe you testified you have never done any systematic research -- let me go back a step. Several times both you and Mr. Brickman used the ohrase svstematic research.
A. Yes .
Q. What do you define systematic research to
mean?
A. When I tried to locate every relevant document that I could have which deals with the issue, deals on the periphery of the issue, to deal with it from its antecedents to the follow-up. The difference is between preparing a lecture and writing a book. In other words, to get -- in the lecture, get a sense of -- sort of a sketch, a good sketch, but it is not the sense of actually writing a book on it.
Q. And I believe you testified, and please correct me if I am wrong, that you had never done any systematic research about whether Philip Morris had done any research about low tar cigarettes that was not within the possession of the public health community. Is that your testimony, that you had never done systematic research on that?
A. Never done systematic research, no.
assess whether a particular Philip Morris document reflected knowledge that was not in the public health community?
A. Yes, I have been asked to do that in a couple of cases. I was asked to see whether the document was in the public domain and also would it have made a difference.
Q. Were these documents chosen for tobacco company lawyers or -A. These were all plaintiffs documents.
Q. Have you ever seen a Philip Morris document during the course of this work that reflected knowledge that Philip Morris had that the public health community did not have?
A. No .
Q. There was a long conversation about unconscious compensation during this deposition; is that correct?
A . There was.
Q. You have read Dr. Koslowski's work regarding ventilation hole blocking; is that correct ?
Q. And that work dates -- when did Dr. Koslowski publish the first study?
A. I think 1979 or 1980, and his work on that has continued throughout the '90s.
Q. And the work starting in the early 1980s, did Dr. Koslowski express the concern that smokers might not realize they were blocking ventilation holes ?
A. Yes.
Q. Prior to Dr. Koslowki's writings, were other members of the public health community ever expressing concerns that smokers might be compensating and not realizing the full extent of their compensation?
A. Yes. Certainly Dr. Russell in his nicotine work prior to that.
Q. I believe you testified that CPS1 does not offer any hard data that a 16-milligram cigarette would be safer than a 10-milligram cigarette.
A. Other way around.
Q. With that revision, is that a fair characterization?
MR. BRICKMAN: Objection to form.
BY MR. ROSENTHAL:
Q- I believe you testified that CPS1 did not have hard data specifically examining whether a 10-milligram cigarette would be safer than a 16-milligram cigarette?
A. Yes.
Q. Was CPS1 viewed by the public health community to offer evidence of the health benefits of the 10-milligram cigarette over the 16-milligram cigarette?
MR. BRICKMAN: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, certainly I think the interpretation that Dr. Hammond wanted to say was that in the future, as cigarettes continued -because, of course, there were cigarettes on the market in 1996 that had 10 or even lower than that, that in the future these cigarettes would hold out the hope that the differences between the moderate and the higher cigarettes and the lower -- but that
is the best I can do without the article in front of me .
BY MR. ROSENTHAL:
Q. Do you recall testifying about whether or not a product should be tested before one puts it on THE market?
A. In a general sense it is possible 20 do
so -
Q. Do you recall generally that line of t e st imony?
A, Ye s.
Q. Has the public health community ever commented on what the best measure of testing the health effects of a cigarette is?
A. It would be post-epidemiological studies, probably a double blind in some way.
Q. Is it possible to conduct an epidemiological study on cigarettes before putting it on the market?
A. It would be hard to imagine how it would be done -
required that epidemiological studies be required on -- conducted on a particular brand of cigarette before it is marketed?
MR. BRICKMAN: Objection. Do you know what you mean by the public health community demanding it? I don't know who that is.
THE WITNESS: I am certainly not aware of
that, no.
BY MR. ROSENTHAL:
Q. Mr. Brickman asked you several questions about Philip Morris and disease.
A. He asked me a lot of questions.
Q. In general, do you recall the questions?
A. Yes.
Q. You have not systematically studied, as you used that word, the entire world of Philip Morris' statements about the relationship between smoking and disease?
A. No.
Q. Have you seen any Philip Morris statements ?
Q. Have you seen any Philip Morris statements at any point in time indicating that Philip Morris did not think that it conclusively established that smoking was a cause of lung cancer?
A. Yes.
Q. Have you ever see any statements after 1964 surgeon general's report in which Philip Morris said that smoking did not cause any disease?
A. No, I have not seen that.
Q. Mr. Brickman also asked you questions about what Philip Morris did or may have done regarding regulatory efforts by the public health community over a long period of time?
A. Yes.
Q. Have you systematically studied Philip Morris' efforts with respect to regulatory efforts throughout the last 50 years?
A. No, I have not.
MR. ROSENTHAL: That is it.
MR. BRICKMAN: I have a few questions.
FURTHER EXAMINATION BY COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF
Q. Did counsel tell you in advance that he was going to be asking you questions about the Tobacco Working Group and the general techniques for ventilating and putting other things in effect to reduce the tar and nicotine levels in cigarettes?
A. You mean the questions he just asked?
Q. The first question he asked.
A . No .
Q. He didn't go over any of that with you during the brakes?
A. No.
Q. So you just happen to know now how about the various techniques to make a light cigarette lighter than a regular cigarette? But when I asked you you didn't recall.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I am going to object to that. That is not Marlboro versus Marlboro Lights.
MR. BRICKMAN: That is right, we are talking about Marlboro versus Marlboro Lights.
That is what this case is about.
THE WITNESS: The question you asked me was did I know specifically about Marlboro Lights. The question he asked me, which was the same question you asked me earlier, was what kind of recommendations did the Tobacco Working Group make about how to make light cigarettes in general.
MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Is that what you took his question -- let me hear what you think his question was so that I know what you think you answered.
A. What I heard his question to be was, you answered a question about Marlboro Lights specifically, but can you give me -- do you understand what the public health community was recommending about how light, low tar cigarettes were made in general.
Q. That was your understanding of his quest ion?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you now know how lights were made allegedly light?
A. Do I now know?
A. As opposed to 3:00 in the afternoon --
Q. As opposed to five minutes ago or an hour a ago? Do you now know?
A. As I told you this morning, I know what the Tobacco Working Group recommended in terms of technologies for cigarettes.
Q. Do you know now know what Philip Morris did to make its cigarettes "light"?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: My general understanding from reading articles on cigarette technology is that all cigarette companies have used those techniques, but specifically about a Marlboro Light, I have not studied about a Marlboro Light.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Now, you mentioned before that you were shown documents in trial that were put up by plaintiffs; is that correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. Weren't you in fact shown most of those documents by defense counsel asking you to comment
upon them after the fact?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to the form.
THE WITNESS: I think we are talking about different documents here.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. The ones I read you were shown documents by the tobacco company lawyers saying this is what the plaintiffs have put in evidence, we want you to comment on that -- wasn't that done in the cases at which you testified at trial? Yes or no?
A. What I looked at was all documents that plaintiffs had put into evidence at trial.
Q. Yes or no?
A. What I looked at was all the documents that plaintiffs had put in evidence.
Q. Who were you shown them by?
A. At trial?
Q. Yes.
A. I think some by the plaintiff lawyers and some by defense.
Q. And somehow you were able to look at those out of context and give conclusions on them.
or did you read all the documents that surrounded them before you gave your opinions?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I looked at only in those particular -- the questions I was being specifically asked was, was this information, this particular information, was this known in the public health community, which I had studied in greater detail —
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Were you able to make that analysis by looking at the document by itself, without putting it in context of all the other documents that may have surrounded it, so forth and so on?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Depending on --Q. Depending on who asked it?
A. No, no, no.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Let the witness finish.
THE WITNESS: There were some comments such as arsenic, which was being raised as a possible hidden fact. I did ask to see additional
documents to sort of settle that issue. There were two carcinogens that allegedly were found by an R.J. Reynolds scientist, methyl colantin and colantin. I knew from reading documents from the 1990s that those chemicals were not in tobacco, so I asked how could this have possibly come about to get some sort of context, and that may have been the case in one or two others, but for the most part, the questions I was being asked to evaluate was here is a piece of information. Was that allegedly a secret piece of information, was this known in the public health community? And in those cases, I think I could take just the document and say whether it was.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q- You didn't need a context for it?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I did have a context. The context was the public health community.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you able to tell me whether the public health community was aware of documents by
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I need -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I know, you need the context. When the plaintiffs' lawyer asks you are to give an answer, but when the defense lawyers asks you are able to give an answer.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Isn't that correct?
A. Entirely different set of facts. The other -- you haven't even shown me the document in the first place to know --
Q. I asked you the same question, were these things known, did you know about them, and you keep saying, "I need to know the context." I think you don't want to answer it depending on who asks it.
Is that true?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I am trying to answer the best I can.
Q. I am being very blunt. Do you answer questions differently depending on who asks them?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I try to answer them in the same fashion.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Now, you also mentioned that Dr. Koslowski had articles that talked about people not realizing they were compensating. Do you recall that statement? And actually the statement was -- you didn't say they realized it, but they didn't realize the extent to which they were compensating, and I am trying to figure out, is there any difference in that?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't think so.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. So when Dr. Koslowski's article came out, he was referring to unconscious compensation?
A. I don't think he ever used that term.
Q. But it meant the same thing, they didn't
realize it?
that .
Did Philip Morris know about this Dr. Koslowski article?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form and outside the scope.
THE WITNESS: I think so.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Tell me then what efforts Philip Morris made to let people know they may not realize they are compensating when they smoke low tar cigarettes?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection. Outside the
scope.
THE WITNESS; I have seen documents in other cases, and this is a vague recollection -you may have the documents right there in your hand, and we could look at them together -- was that Philip Morris read the material that Dr. Koslowski did, tested it and reached a
conclusion that cigarette hole blocking was not a significant form of compensation.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. So you have seen their studies they did on hole blocking? '
A. My recollection is I have seen that in another case, but I haven7t reviewed it in a while. To give you an informed opinion, I would have to read it again.
Q. So when I asked you earlier was Philip Morris aware of vent blocking and you said you didn't know, you did know in fact they were knew about vent blocking?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
Mischaracterizes the testimony.
THE WITNESS: I forget the exact context of the original question.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. It is context again.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him finish.
THE WITNESS: Sitting here this afternoon and you asked another question you prompted a
memory, but I would have to see the documents again to make sure I am remembering correctly.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You need to put it in context or you just don't remember now?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
MR. BRICKMAN: I am just trying to understand what he is telling me.
THE WITNESS: Context is a good thing, gives us some perspective, but I would have to read the document. But my recollection is they were aware of Dr. Koslowski's studies.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. What did they do to tell the public about compensating with their light cigarettes?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form. And outside the scope.
THE WITNESS: You mean what did they say about the experiment they did checking on Dr. Koslowki's -BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I want to know what they told the people
about the potential for compensation pursuant to Dr. Koslowski's article.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I am not aware they did make a public statement.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Is it your opinion that the research they did on vent blocking indicated that it did not cause higher tar and nicotine yields to the actual smoker?
A. I would have to go back and look at it.
My recollection is that it did not make a significant difference.
Q. Did not make a significant difference in the inhalation numbers of tar and nicotine for the person actually smoking?
, A. That is correct, and of course Dr. Koslowski's studies were not making actual measurements either. This was a potential also.
Q. Now, you used a funny phrase when counsel was asking you about any testing to indicate whether going from 16 to 10 milligrams of tar
showed any reduction of risk, and you said, what Hammond wanted to say -- is there something you know he wanted to say that was not published?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
BY MR - BRICKMAN:
Q. Are you able to read his mind?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: I think what I was trying to say, and prompted by all these questions, I probably should have his study in front of me, was that Hammond used his study and made some comments toward the end to project what he hoped would be further benefits in low tar and low yield cigarettes.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Now, you mentioned the idea that you need epidemiological studies in order to determine whether something is harmful or not, especially with cigarettes. Do you recall that basic testimony?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
Mischaracterizes the testimony.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I believe you said you a double-blind epidemiological.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. If in fact you have to wait for a prospective double-blind epidemiological study# what you are in essence suggesting is that we have humans be human guinea pigs to determine if they are going to get sick before we decide whether that product is dangerous or not?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
Mischaracterizes the testimony.
THE WITNESS: Certainly that would be the
best test.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. As a result of that test, humans would
die?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. That is why the test shouldn't be done?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Right.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. So what we really need to do is test it on animals or do mutagenicity studies before we market the product, so that we know it is safe before we let humans be exposed to it, correct?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection.
THE WITNESS: We already talked about mutagenicity studies may or may not be,helpful in carcinogenic studies.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. But they raise the red flag?
A. And animal studies are only so helpful for all sorts of reasons, animals don't get lung cancer when they smoke, for example.
Q. You don't propose, however, that we market items and test them on humans and then determine if humans are going to die -- strike
You don't -- you are not saying that from a public health point of view, it is a good idea to make the determination that a product is harmful or not by exposing humans to it, are you?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: What the public health community said -BY MR. BRICKMAN:	x
Q. I am asking you.
A. The public health community knew that all forms of cigarettes were dangerous, and the recommendation was stop and don't start. The third-tier recommendation was smoke as low a tar cigarette as you can make, and the recommendation to the tobacco companies was to make a cigarette that was low yield.
Q. You would never recommend testing on humans to determine whether a product is safe or not, would you?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
about a particular issue -- I think it depends on the product, whether it is even possible to test.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You were also asked, and again, I apologize, maybe I didn't understand, whether there any statements after '64 by Philip Morris that its products did not cause disease -- is that what you said, or what you were asked?
A. Yes.
Q. Are you telling us under oath that you are not aware of any statements by Philip Morris after '64 to the effect that its cigarettes did not cause disease?
A. What they often said was that it had not been definitively proven, which is a different thing than saying -- they didn't deny it outright, but they said there were different scientific facts that had not been proven.
Q. So that in your comprehensive review of what was out there for public health officials and the public, you didn't come across one statement by Philip Morris that its products did not cause
disease, or something to the equivalent?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I can't say I saw absolutely none.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. You already said that.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Let him answer.
THE WITNESS: Usually the statements were not stated in the way you stated it# but more likely it has not been definitively shown.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. Put aside definitively shown. Are you aware of any statements after Philip Morris made after '64 wherein they said that cigarette smoking did not cause disease, is not harmful, something along those lines?
A. I would have to look, again, at the particular subject matter because usually -usually there is a qualifier.
Q. You didn't qualify it when counsel asked you before; you are not qualifying -MR. ROSENTHAL: That is not an accurate
THE WITNESS: What I would really like to do is see the statement, Then we can look at it together.
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I am asking you. I want to know how comprehensive your review was. I have got to tell you, I have lots of these statements that don't sound like you did a very good job of looking, if you are not aware of any of them. I am just putting you on notice about it. You can go ahead and make another search.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Do you have another statement where Philip Morris said cigarettes are not harmful?
BY MR. BRICKMAN:
Q. I have statements where they say it does not cause disease. Does that sound like the same thing to you?
A. I am just not aware of it.
