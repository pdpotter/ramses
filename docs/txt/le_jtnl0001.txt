21	A. [DELETED] V i	..... . ]
22	Q. And I understand that you live part of,	j •;

5	during the summer and Mississippi in the winter.
6	A. No, 1 do it the other way around.
7	Q. Oh. you do? I won't go down that line of .
8	questioning. I'm running away from the humidity.
9	Dr. Ambrose, have you ever given a deposition
10	• before?
11	A. No.	■ .
*	12 Q. I'm sure your counsel have explained to
13	you a little bit about what a deposition is like and
u	some of the things you should cxpcct, but let me just
15	tell you, and I feel like a broken record because; : f;
16	lawyers repeat this all the time, but if you don't „ -.->t
17	understand any of my questions, you're not obligated
18	to answer them. Ask me to clarify the question. Ask
19	me to repeat it. Take whatever time that you feel is:
20	necessary. I don't want you to answer any question
21	that you don't understand. I'll try my best, but I
22	fail, like anyone else sometimes, to ask the right
23	questions. Anytime that you feel like you need.to
24	take a break, please just all you have to do is tell
25	me, and we'll take a break. So I don't want you to
'	■	. "“"'’.‘Page6

2	1 Let me start out by asking you, when did
3	you begin working for the defendants in this case? ,
4	And often times during the questioning I may refer to
5	them as the tobacco defendants or the tobacco , \
6	industry. Could you tell me when you began working
7	for the tobacco industry for the purpose of this
8	litigation?	• - :

13	come about that you began working for the industry?
14	A. I don't feel that I'm working for the :
15	industry.

11	in the discussions?

u	you're being retained by us and not by the tobacco
is	industry or any particular tobaoCo defendant; is that

17	A. That's correct.."	! ;
18	Q. Okay. Do you see yourself in providing
19	testimony in this litigation as offering testimony on
20	behalf of the defendants in this litigation?

5	Q. Mr. Purvis or Ms. Johnson contacted you

7	of service that they asked you to provide by way of
8	testimony the same type or nature of testimony that
9	you provided in the Covert case?	* :
10	A. Yes.	.
11	Q. And what was the nature of the testimony
12	in the Covert case?
13	A. I testified as to the public's awareness
14	of the dangers of smoking.
15	Q. And is that the type of testimony that
16	Ms. Johnson or Mr Purvis asked you they wanted in -
17	this litigation, meaning the Florida State	' ■
18	litigation?	' v'
19	A. Yes.	- ;
20	Q. In preparing for work for the Florida,
21	for the testimony that you were to give in the ' .
22	Florida litigation, did you do any work in addition
23	,	to the work that you did in preparation for the
24	Covert case?	' •	ai r . .
25-- AcYes.-.^-.f.:‘^:.::::-:.....
■	V	,	Page 14
li	Q. You did? When the attorneys— Rather v>:
2;	than keep referring to them by name. I'll just say
3!	the attorneys. When the attorneys asked you to
4	provide services in connection with the Florida case,
5	did they prescribe for you the type of work that you
6	were to do in order to provide the service they
7	wanted, that being testimony in connection with ;
8	awareness of smoking? Did they prescribe to you the
9	type of work' they wanted you to do in order for you
10	to be able to do toat,' to provide testimony abotft ®i
11	awareness? , ,	• ' '
12	A. That's a pretty strong verb, that they
13	prescribed. They said they wanted - They outlined
14	the case and said, "We want you to testify," and that is	obviously meant being more specific in the research
16	with regard to the state of Florida than I did in the
17	case that was in Louisiana. ; ; ■ ■- ;	' >
18	Q. In the case in Louisiana, I'm assuming, '
19	and correct me if I'm mistaken, that you probably
20	dealt with public awareness in general and then maybe
21	public awareness specific to Louisiana; am I
22	correct?	.	»
23	. a. Among other things, yes.	‘
24	Q. And obviously in this case it was. I'm	•
25	assuming again; public awarehess in general and then
‘j " ; '	. ■ . : ’ ' ' Page 15
I	i	public awareness, Florida specific; is that correct?.
| 2 a That's corrcct. That's.close to v , ' .
J 3	corrcct.	• : ■ • • ; :	'
! * Q. All right. Straighten me out.
5	a. What I had done in.thc Covert case was
6	looking at the national picture and then being veiy
7	specific with regard to Louisiana and to a person, an
8	individual.	; .	: ;	....
9	Q. An individual.	, .	'
10	a. And in the case that we are now
II	discussing, I needed to do for Florida what I had
12	done for Louisiana, and I don' t know that anyone
13	prescribed that I do it. That was perfectly ^ >
14': obvious. - , i-; .. -,v; :.<?■ . . ■ ^ . ■ . , , ; '
15	Q. Let me maybe ask the question a different
16	>yay. Did the lawyers set parameters for you in the
17	type of preparation and the typ$ of research that you
18	were to do in order to provide th& service, t£at you
19	were to provide?; . .	: .
20	A. NO.	..	.
21	q. Did they suggest to you or ask you to
22	limit yourself to any particular source material in •
23	your research?, - • ;	i , ‘ '
24	A. NO.	i,	.
25	Q. Did they ask you tojook at anymaterial
: ............11.....Page 16

2	available in the public record?^,	m
3	■ A. .NOvflJi fj;.^V,' i&iW	1'
4	Q. Is it your testimony that when they asked ■ ^ ■
5	you to study the issue ofa\vajeness and to give
6	testimony on it, thiey did not limit you to what is
7	available in the public record?	1. ,
8	A They asked me to examine and come to
9	conclusions on the state of public awareness and'
10	specifically to Florida..,.,., A	” Z\
U	Q. Did they s|y anything about looking at
12	what the public record reveals about the state of
13.	awareness? < ... . .

16	the discussion? , ^	w *-• 'V
17	A-	i
18	Q. It did not. Did they offer to provide ..
19	you with any internal ntarpublic tobacco industry
20	sourc? material in prepauratlon for tte work that you
21'	were to provide foy them?, .	:	7

25	information to the publicjn the public formulating	: Pfltro -) 1 - Pncw* OA	A ,WII 1.1 AM
1	or shaping an awareness?
2	A. Certainly people that are selling :
3	products to the public afc advertising those
4	products. My hcsitancy is on the word "information",
5	and I'm not an expert on advertising. If advertising
6	is putting out information. I'm not sure I'm happy
7	with that. Advertising has a purpose different from
8	a government pamphlet or an ACSpamphlet.
9	Advertising i i dcsigned tp sell, and people make ‘
10	judgments. I don't know of very many people who
11	believe everything that they read in advertisements.
12	Q. Well, isn't advertising by a manufacturer
13	a form of communication? You earlier said that any
14	form of communication to the public. Isn't
15	advertising by a manufacturer of cigarettes a form of
16	communication? ' ' '

20	role in fonnulating awarenpss about the product, ...
21	correct? •	r
22	a. Yes.	,

2	a. 1 felt, feel that the counter by the
3	tobacco companies is so well-known a story and
4	presented on all of the news releases and all of the
5	television interviews and all the other sources of
6	information that it wasn't necessary for me to look
7	at a pamphlet produced by TIRC to know what TIRC was
8	telling the public. What 1 am concerned with is what
9	is getting across to the public and how the public is ; to	reacting to what's getting across. So as a l
11	historian. I'm satisfied that I have a basis for	I
12	having an opinion on what the public was aware of.	I
13	.	Q. In being able to formulate an opinion ■ ' I
14	about the public's beliefs and opinions from various 1
15	sources of information that they received, are you ' i
16	not, leaving out a critical piece of evidence or.'a	l

18	what information the industiy is putting out to the	l

22	the tobacco industiy has to the other information the 2

3	A. How briefly? Do you want the 5-second
4	sound bite of 60-second sOund? I mean, it's a v
5	terribly big subject. You want me to get specific? ?•
6	The heart of the story, I suppose this would be my ,
7	own judgment, is you haven't found the substance that
8	causes Cancer. There are lots of people who smoke
9	who don't get cancer. Everyone is free to smoke,
10	Everyone makes their own choice and accepts whatever 1
11	risks they are convinced is out there. They make a	l
12	judgment and on and On and on and on, as you know, l
13	Q. I didn't mean to interrupt you. Are you	l
14	finished with your answer for now?	v 1
15	A. Yes. That's the 5-second sound bite. .	1
16	Q. I was going to help you out a little	l
17	bit. The information from the voluntary health	1
18	groups and religious groups is that tobacco is < -	i
19	dangerous to human health, causes cancer, emphyzema, l
20	heart disease and many other ailments and it's habit 2
21	forming. You can get hooked on it, et cetera. What 2
22	is the tobacco industiy message about those specific 2

9	A. You're talking about a 40-year period to

12	Q. Okay. Fair enough. What was the message
13	of the tobacco industiy about the subject of the .
14	effect of tobacco on ,human health in the 1950s?
15	A. Even you still got toJ>reak it down ''	'

10	It was an advertisement claim. ' '
11	q.Isn't it t^, Pr. A^rose, that the
12	message in the 1950s and maybe even before in the
13	194Qs by the tobacco industiy to the public was that
14	tobacco was something that is to be desired, that it
15	was appealing? They had athletes and actors, people
16	who were young and^vibrant. Freshness was a word
17	that was used, that th^were communicating a inessage

20	MR. PURVIS: Object to the foiim.
21	Q. (By Mr. Mikhail) Yoii Way answer.
22	A. I guess my answer to that is the
23	advertising is advertising.

25	a "yes" or "no" and then explain it any way'that you
, * **©'■'
1	feel necessary?	'	i /
2	A. There certainly were an awful lot of ads ■'
3	in there with good-looking young people smoking
4	cigarettes, yes.
<	Q. And the message they were convoying then
6	is a little bit different than the message they're
7	conveying today, correct? They're not making the
8	type of health claims today about their product that
9	they did the 140s and’50s?	..... v
10	A. They didn't make health claims in the'40s
11	or '50s.
12	Q. What about -- Do you think that "Doctors
13	Prefer Camel" was a health claim in one form of
14	another? ..
15	A. 1 don't know if that's a health claim or
16	not. It's a way to play on the precipe of your
17	doctors in this society. ’	• ■
18	Q. And the message is that doctors won't do ,
19	anything that's not healthy, correct?
20	A. That as we've established. I am not an J>v
21	expert on advertising and what the motivations of
22	the -- What they expect their ad to produce in the "
23	way of feelings, how they come to those expectations

9	Q. You can't disassociate communication from
10	awareness, can you?;	,,	T
■ 11	■ ' A. No. ■	■ . '
12	Q. Okay. So the message that they were
13	conveying in the '40s and '50s, as we talk about this
14	counter story or the message that the public gels
15	from all these other sources, was that it was
16	something desirable and appealing, correct?
17	A. My only problem with your question is ■
18	that desirable and appealing, I don't want to Y[-
19	characterize how they formulated these

18	smoked and is alleging that they suffered a disease .
19	or damages as a result of cigarettes knew that
20	cigarettes were dangerous and chose to smoke

18	virtue of the fact that that ’infpj^$tiop about a
19	controversy was publicized arid ^was out there for ^
20	the public to receive, then that raised the level of '
21	awareness, if I understood you oorrectly?
22	, a. Yes, but that controversy, maybe help out
23	here to get through this, that controversy is what
24	spurred Luther Terry to act. ’	; r , . ;
25	Q. But my question would betheninthb same ’ I
Page 161
1	vein, why would not a Surgeon General of tlie United
2	States' report about tlie dangers of smoking not
3	impact significantly on tlie level of awareness?
4	a. I'm just getting lost here. I think I've
5	answered the question. Let me try one more time.
6	Luther Terry's report was tlie culmination of years of
7	intense controversy in which tlie American public
8	became aware of tlie dangers of smoking cigarettes.
9	The attorney, the attorney general -- Excuse me, the
10	surgeon general, in issuing the report, was
11	responding to a level of awareness that was already
12	very much out there.
13	Now, when the surgeon general spoke, it
14	had an effect on policy. Of course it did,
15	obviously. It had an effect on laws. It had an
16	effect on all kind of things, but it responded to a '
17	level of awareness that was already out there.
18	Q. Well, how do you account then,
19	Dr. Ambrose, that after the surgeon general's report
20	in 1964 there was a significant reduction in people
21	who smoked?
22	MS. JOHNSON: object to the form.
23	. MR. PURVIS: Object to the form.	-
24	A. Because it scared them. It scared them	>■
25	in a way that they-r Without.the imprinter of the
Page 16
1	surgeon general, they ha<l not previously been scared.1
2	Q. But you're saying that doesn't *«;*«>:•• otfe .
3	necessarily mean that the level of the awareness was :
4	increased?	; ‘
5	, A. That's right. I do not believe -- That's
6	right.	■ '•
7	Q, Okay. All right.	:
8	A. I’m going to try one little quip, having
9	annoyed you. I tend to do that. It's one more-- ;
10	The Terry thing was one more nail in the coffiri,and
11	it was the final nail for many people.	i ' > : ;
12	Q. Except the tobacco industry, correct?
13	A. Except that many of them went back to
14	smoking very soon.
15	Q. Except the tobacco industry, correct?
16	A. I can't speak for the tobacco industry.
17	Q. You're speaking for everybody else.' s
18	A. As you have established, I do not look at	■
19	the internal records of the tobacco industry.
20	Q. But you have spoken for everybody else
21	other than the tobacco industry, correct?
22	MS. JOHNSON: Object to form.
23	A. Well, that's a nasty way to put it.
24	Q. (By Mr. Mikhail) No. I'm asking you,	;
25	you looked at everything but the tobacco industry? :vl
-	..........Page 16,
I i a. No, 1 haven't looked at everything but
: 2	'he tobacco industry. I've looked at what people
3	were aware of about the charges, about the dangers of
4	smoking cigarcttcs.
s q. 1 heard you.	"
6	A. 1 can't resist adding a little bit to
! ^	that.
8	y. Okay. Go ahead.
9	a. I'm not going to read every pamphlet the
10	American Cancer Society puts out to make a judgment
11	on how the public reacted to this. I know how the
12	public reacted to it, and I know the general points
13	that are in the pamphlet. The historian cannot look
14	at everything obviously and doesn't and would be
15	foolish to do it.	,	,
16	Q. You're familiar, aren't you, with the ’ 1
17	fact that ultra lights and different type of low-tar
18	and low-nicotine cigarettes have been manufactured
19	and marketed and sold in the United States over the
20	last few dccadcs, correct?
21	a. Yes.
22	Q. And are you aware of any studies that •
23	conclude what the public's perception or level of
24	awareness or knowledge is, about the .health effects ’
25	are of low-tar and low-nicotine cigarettes? ;/
2	" .........■ '.............*...........-....... Page 16*
1	A; In a general ,way, yes.^	..
2	Q. And what do you know about that? ' '	;
■■ I i I " ( i i ; \ ■' J.y jJ ■ ,«	/
3	A. Well, it's shifted over time. t., * <
4	Q. What was it before it shifted, and what
5	did it end up being after it shifted?	!
6	a. Well, I may be testifying on this at some
7	^length, I don't know, but as a general outline, I
8	mean, I don't know at this time how I'm going to say
9	it or what length. In the early 1950s, with the
10	introduction of the filters, there was a widespread
11	hope that this would solve the problem that was
12	shared by quite a few people in the research end of
13	cigarettes and cancer so that there was a point in
14	time which there was some scientific opinion that
15	these filters will have dealt with the problems of ’
16	the health hazards of cigarettes. ..	/
17	Q. Isn't it true that with the availability.....
18	of low-tar and low-nicotine cigarettes, that as’to
19	the public's awareness of the effect on health,'was
20	that they were not as harmful than previous	.
21	cigarettes?	, ,
22	A. Initially.	. .	1
23	. . Q. All right. Do you know what smokers of	*
24	low-tar and low-nicotine cigarettes believe today; 'i
25	about the dangers or harm or degree of harm of h ,
1	low-tar, low-nicotinc cigarcttcs?
2	ms. JOHNSON: objcct to the form.
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. (By Mr. Mikhail) You do? And what is
5	that?	.
6	a. That they have no effect.	j
7	q. I'm not sure i understand you.	j
8	a. That the filters do not not have an	!
9	effect on the dangers of smoking cigarettes.
10	Q. So currently your opinion is that smokers
11	don't believe that low-tar and low-nicotine
12	cigarettes are safer for them or less hazardous?
13	a. No, 1 don't think that they think that.
14	I think that they have been presented with
15	overwhelming information that that is not the case.
16	Q. Okay.' Do you believe, Dr. Ambrose, that
17	a manufacturer of a consumer product has a duty to
18	inform consumers of that product of known hazards and
19	known dangers of that product?

4	say unequivocally that you believe that the scliool of
5	thought or the notion that the Civil War could have

7	seemed pretty,unequivocal about it, that you wlieye
8	it could not have been avoided; is that correct?! *'

10	Q. And, what is ,{he|ype of infonnation that
n	you are relying on, and I'm nbt asking for a lecture
12	in history bn that, and I know you want to get out of
13	here, but I really want to know what is the nature
14	and what is the extent and what is the type of
15	information that enables you to utKiquiyocally .state

20	had studied and others have studied and that I've
21	read about the situation in the United States in
22	I860. S..........J	; ’
23	Q. Well, what type of infpjmation would you
24	need as a historian in order to |ble to answer the ,
25	question ‘about vvhether .ocjnot the ttagedy or problem %
'	rage i 11i
1	of tobacco-rclatcd illnesses could have been avoided i
2	by tlic tobacco industry? What type of information j
3	would you want to have that would enable you to draw |
4	a conclusion?	j
5	ms. JOHNSON: objcct to the form.	■
6	Q. (By Mr. Mikhail) You may answer,	j
7	A. That's so entirely -- You’ve got my mind
8	on the Civil War. and tl is is so entirely different.
9	Q. Lawyers do thaoftcn. You seem to--
10	a. You want me to distinguish between a way
11	in which I would come to a conclusion on the
12	inevitability of the -- And I don't like the word
13	inevitable, and I never use it.
14	Q. Well, 1 didn't use it either.
15	A. Of the coming of the Civil War as
16	‘	compared to a hypothetical about what private
17:	corporations might or might not have been able to do
18:	with things that 1 don't know if they have an ability
19	to do. whether or not and what effect this might have
20	had on the public. It's an apple and an orange.
21	Q. What if you were given a mission, you
22	were given a research project to determine whether or
23	not the problem could have been avoided by the
24	tobacco industry? What type of information would you
25	set out to review and examine that would enable you c
Page 17*
1	to make some conclusion? ;
2	MS. JOHNSON: Object to the form.
3	A. I wouldn't take such an assignment
4	because I wouldn't be qualified to do it. If I were
5	in a position of supervising such or being involved
6	on a board or something and making a decision, I
7	would go to medical historians and chemists and
8	people who -- This is their field. It's not my
9	field.
10	Q. (By Mr. Mikhail) So you believe that's
11	outside your area of expertise?
12	a. Yes.
13.	MR. MIKHAIL: Unless counsel has any
14	direct examination, which I doubt, but you're free to
15	do so -16 MR. PURVIS: Appreciate the offer, but we
17	would respectfully decline.
18	MR. MIKHAIL: Dr. Ambrose, it was a
19	pleasure your meeting you and thank you.
