(Whereupon, a conference call was placed to the Court at 10:11 a.m.)
MS. REXACH: Good morning, I'm Attorney Clotilde Rexach, we have a controversy in a deposition.
LAW CLERK: Which case is this?
MS. REXACH: This is Hirsa Caraballo Rodri#uez. The case number is 03-1646.

LAW CLERK: 1646. Yes. What I can do is, I can hear both sides. The judge is currently not in attendance. If you can tell me
briefly what the issue is, as soon as he comes in, I will ask him and give you a call back.
MS. REXACH: Are you the law clerk?
LAW CLERK: The law clerk in charge of this case is out on vacation, so I'm the only person here.
MR. MURIEL: Do you want me to tell her what the problem is?
MS. BUCHANAN: You can talk about it Herbert, and I will respond if that's what you want to do.
Let me introduce myself if I may. My name is Christine Buchanan. I'm here on behalf of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
I will let Mr. Muriel introduce himself.
MR. MURIEL: My name is Herbert Muriel. I'm here on behalf of the Plaintiff in the case.
The problem is the Defendant has noticed an expert witness to be deposed. The expert witness is Dr. Díaz who is a historian
who holds a Ph.D., and he has been named as an expert historian in the case. And the Defendants have indicated that they do
not want to pay him for attending the deposition.
MS. BUCHANAN: Our position is --
MR. MURIEL: Wait a minute. I haven't finished.
MS. BUCHANAN: I'm sorry, Herbert. Please go ahead and finish.
MR. MURIEL: I think that he should not have to submit himself to a deposition if he's not going to be paid.
Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require the Defendants to pay an expert witness who is going to testify at trial.
MS. BUCHANAN: Are you finished now?
MR. MURIEL: Yes.
MS. BUCHANAN: Okay. The Defendant's position in this case: We have deposed Dr. Diáz in a number of other cases and he
has charged us at a rate of $275 in previous cases.
In the last case in which we deposed him, in a case called Valle, that was in front of Judge Fuste, we filed a motion to limit his
fees on the grounds that the Plaintiffs had / paid him no money at all for the work that he was doing for them, and that it was
inappropriate for the Plaintiffs not to pay him anything and expect us to pay him everything.
What I told Mr. Muriel is that Dr. Diáz was welcome to submit his invoices in this case, but that we would be filing a similar
motion to the one we filed in Valle?
LAW CLERK: You will be filing a motion for him to reduce his fees?
MS. BUCHANAN: Precisely. That's exactly right.

4Hirsa Caraballo ARABALLOZ, Individually and as..., 2005 WL 6768206...
The other portion that I need to ask is that in the Valle case, Judge 1 Fuste granted our motion and said that we did not have
to pay him anything 1 for the deposition in that case.
LAW CLERK: Who's is deposing him?
MS. BUCHANAN: We are deposing him. The issue is the Plaintiffs have I paid him nothing for anything he has done, and
they are using us to I bankroll their litigation against us.
MR. MURIEL: My understanding of the rule is if they are taking a deposition, they have to pay for it. Because they don't have
to take a deposition. They have an expert report, which means that they don't really need to take a deposition.
But since they are opting to do that, then under those circumstances, they have to pay for it. And they don't want to pay for it.
What Dr. Diáz is doing with the Plaintiffs has nothing to do with their obligation under the rules.
MS. BUCHANAN: Unfortunately we disagree, and we will file case law when we file our motion in this case indicating that it
is inappropriate for an expert to charge high amounts to a defendant for the purpose of a deposition when the plaintiff is paying
little to nothing for that expert's work in the case.
LAW CLERK: Can you hold on a second, please?
(Whereupon, a recess was taken from 10:15 a.m. to 10:16 a.m.)
LAW CLERK: Okay.
MR. MURIEL: I want to add. Dr. Díaz came all the way from Ponce --
THE WITNESS: Peñuelas.
MR. MURIEL: --to attend the deposition. He had to be there at 9:30 in the morning.
LAW CLERK: When's the deposition? Is the deposition today? Are you at the deposition?
MS. BUCHANAN: Yes. We are sitting in the deposition right now.
MR. MURIEL: He has come all the way from Ponce to attend the deposition, he has prepared for the deposition, and they want
him to do all of this for nothing.
MS. BUCHANAN: No, Herbert. We are not saying that we are not paying him. We are saying that we will do whatever the
Court tells us to do. But we are going to file a motion in this case seeking to have his fees reduced on the basis that you have
paid him nothing.
MR. MURIEL: Are you saying that you are going to seek to have the fee reduced? Or are you going to try to get out of paying
it altogether?
MS. BUCHANAN: We would seek to have it reduced to zero on the same basis we will seek to have it reduced to zero in Valle.
The basis being that you have not paid him anything.

5Hirsa Caraballo ARABALLOZ, Individually and as..., 2005 WL 6768206...
MR. MURIEL: I don't think you can pay zero.
LAW CLERK: What's the case in Valle?
MS. BUCHANAN: 03-1883, and it was in front of Judge Fuste.
LAW CLERK: How much is the fee right now?
MS. BUCHANAN: In other cases, he has billed us $275 an hour. Mr. Muriel indicated this morning, or asked, how we would
feel about $125 an hour.
Obviously, we consider that more reasonable. But the problem still remains that he should not have one rate for defendant
depositions and some other rate, which is zero, for plaintiffs.
MR. MURIEL: The Plaintiff will pay Dr. Diáz.
MS. BUCHANAN: Well, Herbert, you are --
MR. MURIEL: I don't know where you get this from that the Plaintiffs are not going to pay.
MS. BUCHANAN: Well, he told me in a previous deposition that he had received no money from plaintiffs in any of the cases
that he's worked on.
LAW CLERK: Are these the same plaintiffs?
MS. BUCHANAN: Different plaintiffs. There are four or five different cases that he's been deposed in. In the last deposition
that was done of him, he said that he received no money from plaintiffs.
LAW CLERK: But that would be irrelevant to this Plaintiff?
MS. BUCHANAN: I understand that. I haven't had a chance to ask him this morning, but I'm certainty going to ask him if he
has been paid any money by the Plaintiffs in this case.
And if he has not, which I suspect to be the case, then I will take the same position, that Plaintiffs have paid him nothing for
all the work he's done, and he's asking us to pay him hundreds of dollars an hour.
MR. MURIEL: Well, you're taking a deposition.
MS. BUCHANAN: I understand that, Herbert.
MR. MURIEL: You're supposed to pay for a deposition.
MS. BUCHANAN: But the fee has to be fair. That's the issue.
MR. MURIEL: He is being fair. He's there. He is submitting himself. He's going to be there for several hours and you're going
to be deposing him all that time, and you should pay for it.

6Hirsa Caraballo ARABALLOZ, Individually and as..., 2005 WL 6768206...
MS. BUCHANAN: I don't have an opposition to paying a fair fee. But when you have paid him nothing, and we have paid
him thousands of dollars so far. I think actually, in entire depositions, he's already garnered more than $7,000 from us. That's
not right. That's not fair.
MR. MURIEL: Well, you are the ones taking the deposition.
MS. BUCHANAN: I understand that. But the fee has to be fair.
MR. MURIEL: You know exactly what he's going to say.
MS. BUCHANAN: No, I don't. We have a brand-new report.
MR. MURIEL: You are going over the same things in each and every case.
MS. BUCHANAN: We have a brand-new report in this case.
MR. MURIEL: Today you have. Not before.
MS. BUCHANAN: The fee still has to be fair, Herbert. I don't want to argue with you. The issue is, the fee has to be paid.
Our position is we will pay a fair fee.
MR. MURIEL: $125 an hour is fair. That's what you're paying your historian. Dr. Diáz has a Ph.D., your historian has a Ph.D.,
Therefore, we are willing to accept $125 an hour.
MS. BUCHANAN: The issue is we actually pay our historians billable hours on a continuum basis.
s far as we can tell, you have not paid Dr. Diáz anything in five or six cases. I suspect that's the issue in this case.
MR. MURIEL: Our clients are not filthy rich, billionaire corporations.
MS. BUCHANAN: I understand. But the fee still has to be fair and it's not fair.
MR. MURIEL: In Rule 26(a), there is a rule that the Court can take into consideration the relative wealth of the parties. I think
this is an appropriate case just to do that. I think under Rule 26(a)(iii).
MS. BUCHANAN: The fee has to be fair. It is not fair for you to expect Defendants to bankroll the litigation that you filed
against them. You know under Rule 11, when you go and file a case, you have to 1 have a basis for it.
MR. MURIEL: When we get the money, we will pay him. Nobody is 1 asking him to do anything for nothing.
MS. BUCHANAN: Are you paying him in the Ramos case? Because that case has been dismissed. Are you paying him in the
De Jesus case? Because that case has been dismissed. Are you paying him for those?
MR. MURIEL: We are concerned with one case, the one before the Court now.
MS. BUCHANAN: You don't want to answer the question. You don't have any intention to pay him for Ramos; you don't have
any intention to pay him for De Jesus.
MR. MURIEL: I don't have to pay him. The classes have to pay him.

7Hirsa Caraballo ARABALLOZ, Individually and as..., 2005 WL 6768206...
LAW CLERK: Let me get this straight. The Defendants want the fee reduced?
MS. BUCHANAN: We will file a motion to that effect. We expect Dr. Diáz to send us an invoice for his deposition time.
LAW CLERK: $60-an-hour invoices.
MS. BUCHANAN: We will file a motion to have his fee reduced, and we will pay whatever the Court tells us to pay.
LAW CLERK: What exactly is being sought this morning through this conference call?
MS. BUCHANAN: As I understand it -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- but unless we agree to pay him $125 an hour, I think
Mr. Muriel was planning on telling his witness to leave.
MR. MURIEL: That's correct. That's the issue before the Court this morning.
LAW CLERK: Who is your witness?
MR.MURIEL: Dr. Diáz.
LAW CLERK: So you called him for deposition.
MS. BUCHANAN: No. The Defendants noticed his deposition and subpoenaed him for deposition today. Mr. Muriel has told
me that unless we agree right now to pay him $125 and not contest that, then he is going to instruct the doctor to leave.
MR. MURIEL: A reason --
LAW CLERK: The $125, together both parties? Or just Defendant? MS. BUCHANAN: Just Defendant.
LAW CLERK: $125 an hour, and then Plaintiff --
MR. MURIEL: We will not pay him anything.
LAW CLERK: -- will not contribute to that.
MR. MURIEL: We are not supposed to pay him anything for deposition. This is Defendant's deposition, not our deposition.
MS. BUCHANAN: The fee has to be fair.
MR. MURIEL: We have nothing to do with this deposition. I want to get this straight. It is your deposition. It is the deposition
of R.J. Reynolds.
MS. BUCHANAN: I understand that. And we are entitled to find out what his opinions are in this case, and that's why we are
taking this deposition. But you cannot hold us at gun point and extort money from us.
LAW CLERK: The point is, Mr. Muriel, if you are not going to be paying for this deposition, what is the issue reducing it
to $125?
MR. MURIEL: I'm sorry?

8Hirsa Caraballo ARABALLOZ, Individually and as..., 2005 WL 6768206...
LAW CLERK: If the Plaintiff is not paying for the deposition, what is the issue if the fee is $125.
MR. MURIEL: The Plaintiffs don't have any obligation to pay for the deposition. It is the Defendant's deposition.
LAW CLERK: But as I understand it this morning, aside from the motion that will be filed at later date about reducing the fee,
there is an issue now as to agreeing to the $125?
MS. BUCHANAN: Well, not exactly. What I understand the issue to be is that Mr. Muriel has said --
LAW CLERK: He will not pay for anything.
MR. MURIEL: I'm not supposed to pay for anything. You got the whole thing backwards. The Defendant has noticed Dr. Díaz
for a deposition. They are asking for his deposition. He is present there in their office. He's waiting to be deposed.
The only thing we're trying to find out is whether they're going to agree to pay him for being there. He's traveled all the way
from Ponce to San Juan to be deposed by the Defendant. Under Rule 26, they are supposed to pay him for his attendance at
the deposition.
LAW CLERK: Which rule are you citing?
MR. MURIEL: 26(a).
MS. BUCHANAN: Reynold's position is that we will pay him whatever the Court directs us to pay him. But after we take his
deposition today, probably later on this week or the beginning of next week, we are going to be filing a motion to reduce his
fees on the basis that it is not fair that Plaintiffs pay him nothing for any of his work and charge us a substantial amount of
money for the time that we spend deposing him.
And when the Court rules on that motion, we will pay him whatever the Court directs us to pay him. But I think the problem is --
MR. MURIEL: Now I see what the problem is.
MS. BUCHANAN: I think the problem is the witness --
MR. MURIEL: We are not paying him anything. The clerk is getting him confused with what is going on today. The fact
that we are not paying him anything has nothing to do with the fact that you have subpoenaed him for your office to take his
deposition today, and that's what the issue is, what do we do about today, not what do we do about the Plaintiff, and the work
he's rendered for the Plaintiff.
MS. BUCHANAN: It is pertinent whether the fee is fair and reasonable. As I said, we will pay whatever the Court directs us
to pay when it reduces our motion to pay his fees.
I think the issue comes in that Dr. Diaz is going to want immediate payment of some amount of money, and we will, obviously,
hold his invoices until we get a ruling from the Court. The Court told us how much to pay.
MR. MURIEL: All of this is on the record; is that correct?
MS. BUCHANAN: That's correct.

9Hirsa Caraballo ARABALLOZ, Individually and as..., 2005 WL 6768206...
MR. MURIEL: All right. Suppose we proceed on that basis, that you file a motion, and you will be bound by the Court's ruling
on the motion.
MS. BUCHANAN: That's exactly what we said all along.
MR. MURIEL: So this resolves it for now.
MS. BUCHANAN: I think we are resolved.
MR. MURIEL: Thank you very much for listening to us.
MS. BUCHANAN: Thank you very much.
(Whereupon, a recess was taken from 10:27 a.m. to 10:28 a.m.)
MR. MURIEL: I just want to ask Dr. Diáz: How many bills are outstanding that have not been paid? I would like to get that
on the record, if I could.
THE WITNESS: For the record, two bills, May the 3rd and May the 12th of this year.
MR. MURIEL: What case is that?
THE WITNESS: I think it is Angelo Valle.
MR. MURIEL: How much were the bills for?
THE WITNESS: It's around $3,000.
MR. MURIEL: And you've already submitted those bills? THE WITNESS: Yes.
MR. MURIEL: And you have not been paid?
THE WITNESS: Yes. I have not been paid.
MR. MURIEL: That's all.
MS. BUCHANAN: Herbert, just in response to that, I will refer you to the Valle case, Docket No. 57, Judge Fuste's order on
that, stating:
“Payments already made to the expert will not be reduced or otherwise discounted. Defendant will not pay any extra money
to this expert. If further deposed, Defendant's only obligation will be to provide, and pay for, an interpreter's fee accrued as a
result of the deposition-taking process.” Signed José Fuste, June 17, 2005.
MR. MURIEL: Docket 57 did you say?
MS. BUCHANAN: 57. Docket 57 in the Valle case.
MR. MURIEL: Okay. I'll check that.

EXAMINATION BY
MS. BUCHANAN:
Q. Good morning, Dr. Diáz. I hope you're well today.
A. No, I'm not well.
Q. You're not well?
A. My pressure is high, and I think that my blood sugar went down.
Q. Do we need to get you something to eat?

11Hirsa Caraballo ARABALLOZ, Individually and as..., 2005 WL 6768206...
A. Well, I don't know. I think that it should wait. Because I'm not in condition to do the work right now. I feel, because of my
blood pressure and because of my blood sugar and my diabetes. I think that the discussion had something to do with this.
Q. Doctor, would you like us to find you a quiet place to sit down and get you something to eat and let you calm down for a
while and see if you're ready to go on?
A. I think so.
MS. BUCHANAN: Is that all right with you, Herbert?
MR. MURIEL: Yes.
MS. BUCHANAN: We will put him in a conference room. Just so you know, neither I nor Clotilde nor Joe will bother him.
We will sit him in a conference room by himself, let him calm down where it is cool, and get him something to eat. And we
will call you back as soon as we know one way or the other whether he will be able to go forward.
MR. MURIEL: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.

MS. BUCHANAN: Carlos, if you will translate for me.
(Interpreter complying.)
Q. What we were planning to do is to stop the deposition for today. And as I think has already been offered to you --
A. Does Muriel already know?
Q. He's on the phone?
MR. MURTEL:I'm here, Dr. Diáz.
Q. If you are still not feeling well, we are very happy to call you an ambulance, or have someone take you to a doctor, a clinic
or a hospital. I'm sorry. You had a response?
A. That's okay. I think that I can...

Q. And we're also happy to allow you to continue in the conference room for however long you like.
A. Ms. Rotgers already told me.
Q. And if you need somebody to escort you home, we will be happy to do that, too.
A. No. No. Because you're going to spend a lot of money on that.
Q. Okay. That being said, we are happy to stop for today.
A. Okay.
Q. But we do need to reschedule.
A. Okay. For the record?
Q. Right. And I would suggest next week.
A. Okay.
Q. Either Tuesday or Wednesday.
A. Any of the days that I'm well.
Q. Okay. Do you have a preference between Tuesday and Wednesday?
A. No. Any of the two.
MS. BUCHANAN: Herbert, would either Tuesday or Wednesday be good for you?
MR. MURIEL: Yes.
MS. BUCHANAN: Then why don't we say Tuesday.
