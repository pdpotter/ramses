1	LOUIS M. KYRIAKOUDES, Ph.D.,
2	the witness, having been produced
3	and first duly sworn, testified as follows,
4	to-wit:
6	EXAMINATION
8	BY MR. SEBOLD:
9	Q. Professor, you understand that
10	you're under oath today?
11	A. I do.
12	Q. Okay. And that's the same oath
13	you take at trial?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And you understand that your
16	testimony today may have the same effect as
17	if given in front of the judge and jury?
18	A. I understand that.
19	Q. And you understand that you're
20	obliged to tell the truth to the best of
21	your ability?
22	A. I understand that.
23	Q. Okay. And you understand that
24	this is my opportunity to learn your
25	opinions and the basis for them?
0006
1	A. I understand that.
2	Q. All right. And you've had --
3	maybe by phone, but you've had a chance to
4	meet with plaintiffs counsel before the
5	deposition at some point?
6	A. Yes. By telephone.
7	Q. Okay. Can you just briefly
8	summarize for me the opinions that you plan
9	to offer in this case?
10	A. Sure. Again, I have not discussed
11	the specific content of the testimony with
12	the plaintiffs counsel prior to this point
13	or up to this point, but I anticipate that
14	my testimony will be along the lines of my
15	prior testimony in cases such as the Hess
16	case, such as the Alexander case in Alachua
17	County of June of last summer. So by way
18	of a reference, I'll refer to that.
19	Would you like me to go further,
20	in more depth?
21	Q. Well, tell me, do you plan to
22	offer any opinions in this case different
23	than those that you've offered in the other
24	tobacco trials, like Hess and Alexander?
25	A. No, I don't.
0007
1	Q. Do you plan to offer any
2	case-specific opinions in this case, that
3	is dealing specifically with the plaintiff
4	in this case?
5	A. Well, I may be asked questions
6	and, therefore, would respond for things
7	that explain, for example, the historical
8	context of the world from which Mr.
9	Calloway emerged, was bom into, for
10	example.
11	The plaintiff may on the direct
12	examination ask me to kind of explain what
13	Mississippi was like in the 1930s, where he
14	was bom. I guess that would be
15	case-specific.
16	I may discuss certain brands that
17	appear in the deposition that Mr. Calloway
18	was reported to have smoked, although that
19	is a fairly broad set of brands.
20	I may be asked and, therefore,
21	would respond if asked questions about
22	specific subgroups of the population, in
23	this case African-American Southerners and
24	the history of their smoking as a group and
25	how Mr. Calloway may fit into that group, 0008
1	those kinds of things.
2	Q. And I appreciate those examples of
3	specifics.
4	Any other specific things that you
5	may talk about as it relates to Mr.
6	Calloway?
7	A. Sure. Issues of marketing, for
8	example. Mr. Calloway, it is reported in
9	the fact depositions, read certain
10	magazines like Jet, Ebony. So I may
11	discuss the role of cigarette marketing or
12	the -- let me rephrase that, the cigarette
13	marketing within those magazines or
14	cigarette advertisements.
15	Mr. Calloway is reported to have
16	clipped the coupons. I may discuss that if
17	asked. Mr. Calloway is reported to have --
18	again, just based on my reading of the fact
19	depositions -- is reported to have smoked
20	filters -- I'm sorry. I meant to say
21	smoked light cigarettes. So I may talk
22	about, if asked, the role of light
23	cigarettes, particularly in the 1960s, 70s
24	and '80s in the cigarette market.
25	Q. Anything else that you consider
0009
1	specific to his circumstances or case?
2	A. Again, locating him in historical
3	time and place and things that I've just
4	discussed. That's what comes to mind as I
5	sit here.
6	Q. In any of your other trials, have
7	you discussed African-American Southern
8	smokers?
9	A. I have.
10	Q. Which cases were those?
11	A. Well, there is a case in
12	Gainesville, Florida, Alachua County, in
13	June of last year, 2010, Alexander versus
14	R.J. Reynolds. I don't know exactly how
15	it's styled, you know, on the case, but
16	it's called the Alexander case. And that
17	one would be a good one to refer to. I
18	thought that was a pretty succinct and
19	successful direct examination that
20	summarized my opinion on African-American
21	smokers, particularly on the issue of
22	menthol, which is something I didn't
23	mention, that just occurred to me, which
24	would be relevant to the prior question,
25	but the role of menthol in the market,
0010
1	particularly as it relates to
2	African-American smokers. And I talk
3	extensively about that in that particular
4	case.
5	Q. In the Alexander direct
6	examination?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. That would be a pretty good
9	summary, you said, of your opinions on
10	African-American Southern smokers?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. How about this historical context
13	of Mississippi in the '30s, have you
14	testified about that previously?
15	A. No. That, I have not.
16	Q. How about issues of marketing that
17	you described in certain magazines, Jet and
18	Ebony, have you testified previously about
19	that?
20	A. Yes, I have.
21	Q. Can you give me a good reference
22	point for that?
23	A. Well, I believe I talked about
24	that in the Alexander case.
25	A long time ago, maybe perhaps
0011
1	2004,1 testified in a case in St. Louis,
2	Missouri, called Mash versus Brown &
3	Williamson, and I believe I talked about
4	Jet and Ebony in that trial.
5	Q. How about the role of light
6	cigarettes, particularly in the '60s to the
7	'80s, have you testified previously on that
8	subject?
9	A. Yes. That seems to have come up
10	in just about every trial in which I have
11	discussed marketing.
12	Q. Is it true, though, Dr.
13	Kyriakoudes, that you don't purport to be
14	the historian of any specific plaintiff, do
15	you?
16	A. Right. To just be a little bit
17	more precise, I'm not the biographer of Mr.
18	Johnnie Calloway or any other plaintiff.
19	That's true.
20	Q. Is it true that you allow the
21	Engle plaintiffs to identify you as an
22	expert witness before you know anything
23	about the circumstances of their particular
24	case?
25	A. It has been the case where people
0012
1	have listed me as an expert witness and
2	then called me about it. That has
3	happened.
4	Q. And that would be before you knew
5	anything about the particulars of that
6	specific case; is that right?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. Did you gather any information
9	about Mr. Calloway from any source other
10	than plaintiffs counsel?
11	A. Well, when you say plaintiffs
12	counsel, can I assume within that category
13	the fact depositions that were taken of his
14	family members and the like?
15	Q. Sure. So you read some fact
16	depositions in this case?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. And other than those fact
19	depositions and talking to plaintiffs
20	counsel, do you have any other sources of
21	information regarding Mr. Calloway?
22	A. Not him personally, no.
23	Q. Do you know when Mr. Calloway
24	began smoking cigarettes?
25	A. I don't. It wasn't clear from my
0013
1	reading of the fact depositions. His early
2	life seemed to have not been well
3	documented on those. So I don't know
4	exactly when.
5	Q. Do you know why he began smoking
6	cigarettes?
7	A. No, I don't know why he personally
8	began smoking.
9	Q. Do you have any knowledge about
10	any attempts by Mr. Calloway to quit
11	smoking?
12	A. Most of the fact depositions refer
13	to no attempts. There may have been some
14	fleeting reference to the thought of
15	quitting in I believe his brother's
16	deposition, but not a lot. Not enough to
17	make a big impression.
18	Q. Your major impression was that
19	there were no meaningful attempts by Mr.
20	Calloway to quit smoking?
21	A. Yeah. With that modification, I
22	think I would -- yeah. With the word
23	"meaningful," I would agree with that
24	statement.
25	Q. Do you have any information about
0014
1	Mr. Calloway's educational background?
2	A. A little bit, yes.
3	Q. What's your understanding of that?
4	A. He attended the public schools in
5	Hattiesburg, Mississippi and went at least
6	into high school. I don't know that he
7	graduated or not.
8	Q. Have you made any study of the
9	curriculum in the Hattiesburg schools at
10	that time to see what they may have taught
11	about the risks and benefits of smoking?
12	A. Not specifically for Hattiesburg.
13	I know a lot about the history of public
14	education in Mississippi during the era of
15	segregation, but -- and I've reviewed a
16	large number of health textbooks.
17	I would say that given the
18	particular realities for segregation in the
19	1940s when Mr. Calloway would have been in
20	school, late '30s and 1940s, in
21	Mississippi, public education was for
22	African-Americans a pretty -- pretty
23	marginal affair.
24	Q. In terms of specific review of
25	health textbooks used at the time of Mr.
0015
1	Calloway's education, have you made a
2	specific review of those?
3	A. No. I don't know what specific
4	health books, if any, might have been in
5	his school.
6	Q. Do you know anything about Mr.
7	Calloway's employment history?
8	A. Well, again, reported in the fact
9	depositions, he's reported to have worked a
10	variety of jobs most consistently in
11	construction and concrete finishing work,
12	but there are other jobs that are mentioned
13	as well, janitorial service.
14	Q. Did you make any review of the
15	types of magazines or newspapers that Mr.
16	Calloway read?
17	A. Well, he's consistently -- the
18	magazines that come up in the depositions
19	are Ebony, Jet, Time magazine. And I have
20	previously reviewed those.
21	The Fort Lauderdale paper, the
22	Sun-Sentinel is mentioned. I looked at
23	some aspects of that newspaper in the
24	1980s.
25	Q. Have you made a review of the
0016
1	Sun-Sentinel's advertising as it relates to
2	cigarette smoking, to the extent it carried
3	any?
4	A. No, I have not done that.
5	Q. Have you reviewed the
6	Sun-Sentinel's articles that would have
7	related to the health effects of smoking?
8	A. For certain periods of time.
9	Q. What periods of time have you
10	reviewed the Sun-Sentinel?
11	A. It would be in 1988, related to
12	the release of the 1988 Surgeon General's
13	report and the news coverage of that
14	particular event.
15	Q. How about before that, have you
16	made a review of the Sun-Sentinel before
17	1988 to determine what the coverage was
18	like regarding smoking and health effects
19	of smoking?
20	A. I have not.
21	Q. And how about post 1988, did you
22	do any review of the Sun-Sentinel to see
23	what it reported about smoking and its
24	effects?
25	A. I have not.
0017
1	Q. Is there a reason why you
2	particularly focussed on the 1988 report as
3	it relates to the Sun-Sentinel?
4	A. Well, that's an important
5	milestone in history of the smoking and
6	health debate.
7	You know, one could compare it to
8	the 1964 report. That is another important
9	-- particularly important statement by the
10	Surgeon General that attracted a
11	significant amount of coverage in the
12	press.
13	Q. And, Doctor, why do you
14	characterize the 1988 Surgeon General
15	report as an important milestone?
16	A. Well, it was widely covered in the
17	press because its conclusion concerned or
18	its finding concerned the addictiveness of
19	cigarettes, but it was much discussed, much
20	anticipated and covered widely both in the
21	national news and other things like that.
22	Q. In the 1988 report, how was that
23	covered in the Sun-Sentinel?
24	A. There was newspaper coverage. I
25	mean, it was a front-page story.
0018
1	Q. Was there follow-up coverage in
2	the Sun-Sentinel to the 1988 report?
3	A. I believe so.
4	Q. What caused you to take a look at
5	the Sun-Sentinel at that particular point
6	in time?
7	A. Well, it's been awhile since I've
8	done that. I just knew that that was an
9	important event, much like, for example,
10	looking at the 1964 coverage.
11	Q. Okay. Did you go back and look at
12	the Sun-Sentinel and see how it may have
13	covered the 1964 report?
14	A. No, I haven't done that.
15	Q. Are you familiar with Mr.
16	Calloway's television viewing habits?
17	A. Again, all I know is from the --
18	from the fact depositions. I have some
19	familiarity.
20	Q. Let me jump back just a minute.
21	Is it fair to say that he was
22	described as a fairly regular newspaper
23	reader?
24	A. Yes. One of -- I'm forgetting
25	which particular person made that
0019
1	statement, but it is reported that he would
2	read the paper regularly.
3	Q. And I'm sorry to jump around.
4	Television viewing habits, what's
5	your understanding, if any, about Mr.
6	Calloway's habits in that regard?
7	A. That he watched some TV and seemed
8	to have an affinity for westerns.
9	Q. Is it fair to say, Doctor, at
10	trial you don't intend to testify as to
11	what Mr. Calloway actually read in the
12	newspaper?
13	A. When you say actually read, I mean
14	-- can I try to clarify that question?
15	Q. Sure.
16	A. I mean, if -- if you're -- if by
17	that you mean am I going to put him at a
18	particular place in time and put a
19	particular issue of a newspaper in his
20	hand, so to speak, by way of historical
21	reconstruction, the historical record, that
22	is the evidentiary record, doesn't allow me
23	to do that. I cannot do that based on the
24	evidence available.
25	So the best -- the best I can do
0020
1	is talk about the kinds of information that
2	were generally available on national media
3	and the kinds of information that was
4	available and the things that he's reported
5	to have read, like, for example, Jet or
6	Ebony, Time magazine, for those things that
7	I've looked at for the Sun-Sentinel.
8	You know, so I can't, you know,
9	put him in a -- in a particular chair, so
10	to speak, at a particular moment in time.
11	And I wasn't sure where you were
12	going with your question.
13	Q. Well -- and I appreciate that
14	clarification. And as it relates to the
15	Sun-Sentinel, really the only specific
16	thing you can talk about is the 1988
17	report, correct?
18	A. That's correct.
19	Q. And similar question in terms of
20	his television viewing habits, you won't be
21	able to tell us what Mr. Calloway saw or
22	didn't see at any particular point in time;
23	is that fair to say?
24	A. That's correct. I can talk about
25	what was on television, you know, that
0021
1	changed over time, relating to issues of
2	smoking, health, marketing and the like.
3	But, no, I can't put him in front of a TV
4	at a particular hour of a day -- in a
5	particular day in history.
6	Q. Okay. And putting him in his
7	school seat, let's say, can you tell us or
8	are you going to be able to tell us what he
9	was taught in school as it relates to the
10	health effects of smoking?
11	A. Again, I can talk generally about
12	the conditions of public education in
13	Mississippi, the kinds of information that
14	appeared in health textbooks, but I do not
15	know what specific health textbook, if any,
16	and whether he took a health course at his
17	school.
18	He went to -- he would have had to
19	have given his age. He would have had to
20	gone to the Eureka School, which was a
21	union school, which means that all grades
22	were in one building.
23	There's not a lot of investment in
24	African-American education in Mississippi
25	in the mid 20th century due to the
0022
1	realities of the extreme segregation that
2	prevailed at the time.
3	Q. Given that, though, as you said, I
4	think, you can't tell what he was taught at
5	any specific point in time about the health
6	effects of smoking; is that fair to say?
7	A. That's correct. Yes.
8	Q. Is it also fair to say, Doctor,
9	that you don't plan to testify about Mr.
10	Calloway's beliefs about the risks and
11	benefits of smoking?
12	A. Well, I can only testify as to
13	what appears in the evidentiary record.
14	There is some evidence that he
15	chose light cigarettes because he believed
16	them to be healthier. That was a common
17	view. And that's a significant part of the
18	story generally in the history of light
19	cigarettes. So in that regard, there's --
20	I mean, there's some specific information
21	there about him.
22	Q. Anything beyond that in terms of
23	what he believed about risks and benefits
24	of smoking that you intend to testify
25	about?
0023
1	A. No, nothing else. That's what
2	comes to mind.
3	Q. As it relates to light cigarettes,
4	during what time period was Mr. Calloway
5	reported to have smoked light cigarettes?
6	A. Well, as I sit here and recollect
7	from the depositions, it's not entirely
8	clear, but, you know, we know when light
9	cigarettes were manufactured initially,
10	entered into the marketplace or put forth
11	in the marketplace. So it certainly would
12	have been sometime in -- you know, after
13	the mid 1960s.
14	Q. But as it relates specifically to
15	Mr. Calloway, you don't know during what
16	period he actually smoked light cigarettes;
17	is that fair to say?
18	A. Right. It's just that sometime
19	during that period he's reported to have
20	smoked light cigarettes. Yes.
21	Q. But you don't know, for example,
22	how long he smoked light cigarettes; is
23	that correct?
24	A. That's correct. I don't have a
25	detailed census, for example, of his
0024
1	particular cigarette consumption.
2	Q. Also fair to say you don't know
3	what brand of light cigarettes he smoked?
4	A. I think that's correct. He's
5	reported to have smoked a wide variety of
6	brands. It's hard to identify which
7	particular brand he may have smoked.
8	Q. Do you have any information,
9	Doctor, about any specific cigarette
10	advertisement, if any, that Mr. Calloway
11	may have actually seen?
12	A. You mean a -- again, going back to
13	what we were -- the way we styled it
14	earlier and putting him in the chair with a
15	magazine in his hand at a particular point,
16	no, I can't be that specific.
17	I can talk about the ubiquity and
18	pervasiveness of cigarette advertising
19	during his lifetime and how that changed
20	over time as a historical phenomena.
21	I will say -- and this may answer
22	an anticipated -- this may be anticipating
23	a question, but he did use the product. He
24	did -- the advertising was significant.
25	The marketing efforts were significant. I
0025
1	mean, to some degree, I think it's a
2	reasonable historical inference to identify
3	a connection between the advertising and
4	his smoking.
5	Q. But in terms of whether Mr.
6	Calloway saw any cigarette ads or any
7	specific ads, you can't testify to that,
8	correct?
9	A. No. I can --1 can testify to
10	what appeared, for example, in Time or
11	Ebony or Jet. I can identify the fact that
12	he read those magazines, but I can't put
13	him in a -- again, a specific --1 can't
14	historically put the magazine in his
15	hands -- a particular edition of a magazine
16	in his hands at a particular point in time.
17	Q. And the historical inference you
18	talk about between advertising and smoking,
19	you can't say, though, can you, Doctor,
20	that Mr. Calloway was specifically
21	influenced in his smoking by the
22	advertising, can you?
23	A. Distinct from the general public?
24	Q. Correct.
25	A. No. It's --1 -- it's -- what I
0026
1	can say is that he like many millions, you
2	know, African-American smokers -- I'm
3	fighting some allergies. Sorry. I
4	apologize.
5	He like millions of other
6	African-American smokers, you know,
7	gravitated towards certain products that
8	were heavily marketed to the
9	African-American community. That's --
10	that's the degree of specificity I can
11	offer.
12	Q. But in terms of whether
13	advertising actually influenced Mr.
14	Calloway, you can't say that to any degree
15	of historical certainty, correct?
16	A. Well, all I can say is that Mr.
17	Calloway was responding the way that the
18	manufacturers of the product had intended
19	him to respond, and that's the -- that's
20	the extent.
21	Again, I can't put the ad in his
22	hand. I can't go back there and ask him,
23	you know. So I don't have that level of
24	perfect knowledge, but as a historical
25	inference, I can --1 can say that, you
0027
1	know, he was responding as the industry
2	intended him to, as he chose those
3	products.
4	Q. There were certainly people who
5	chose to smoke regardless, though, of
6	whether they saw advertising. You would
7	agree with that, wouldn't you?
8	A. Well, it would have been very
9	difficult, extremely difficult to have
10	lived in the United States during this
11	time. "This time" meaning, let's say, the
12	period of Mr. Calloway's likely smoking
13	history, which would have been sometime
14	during his teen years, the '40s through the
15	1980s. And it would have been extremely,
16	extremely difficult to not encounter
17	cigarette advertising.
18	Q. Sure. But in terms of the
19	cigarette advertising acting on people and
20	influencing them, there were obviously in
21	your mind millions of people who saw the
22	advertising, but they didn't necessarily
23	start smoking, correct?
24	A. Oh. Yes. That's a little bit --
25	maybe I misheard your first question. That
0028
1	is correct. Not everybody smoked. Not
2	everybody responded to cigarette
3	advertising with that action. That's true.
4	Q. And you can't say for sure that
5	Mr. Calloway was responding to cigarette
6	advertising versus some other stimulus, can
7	you, in terms of what he intended to smoke?
8	MR. BRENNER: We should at least
9	let the record reflect -- what was that
10	ring tone?
11	MR. SEBOLD: I'm not really sure.
12	I think mine is automatically on there,
13	somehow, or my kids did it.
14	Would you read that back?
15	(Whereupon, the question was read
16	by the reporter.)
17	A. You raise a good issue. And
18	cigarette advertising is not the only
19	stimulus or -- to use your term, or factor
20	or element that, you know, would be
21	involved in the smoking initiation process
22	and the smoking continuation and
23	maintenance process. There are other
24	factors. That's true.
25	MR. SEBOLD:
0029
1	Q. And what are those other factors,
2	Doctor?
3	A. Well, you know, one would be the
4	availability of the product.
5	One of the points that I made in
6	the Alexander trial was that the early
7	1950s, farm-dwelling African-Americans, who
8	are principally Southern -- that we know
9	because of the history of sharecropping and
10	row crops, like cotton, tobacco.
11	African-Americans exhibited one of the
12	lowest rates of smoking, kind of major
13	demographic route.
14	A lot of that had to do with the
15	fact that they were in places where
16	cigarettes were not as available. You have
17	stores that are fairly and frequently
18	located. In the case of sharecroppers,
19	they tended to exist outside of the cash
20	economy, you know, lived off kind of a
21	complex system of credit.
22	THE COURT REPORTER: Can you speak
23	up just a little bit? I'm having trouble
24	hearing you.
25	THE WITNESS: Yes.
0030
1	A. I'm not trying to give you an
2	agricultural history -- I'll be as concise
3	as possible. But, you know, those are
4	factors.
5	As African-Americans moved into
6	cities, as they moved into wage labor, you
7	know, cash economy, as they moved north
8	into cities, the continuing process of The
9	Great Migration, they became a market that
10	attracted the attention of the industry.
11	The industry began to realize that this was
12	a market to direct their advertising
13	efforts to.
14	So, you know, there are these
15	other factors. Yes.
16	MR. SEBOLD:
17	Q. Other factors for smoking could be
18	enjoyment, right? I mean, a person can
19	smoke simply because they like to smoke,
20	right?
21	A. If -- if -- if enjoyment was also
22	meant to mean, you know, satisfying a
23	nicotine addiction, that would be a factor
24	in the continuance of smoking. Yes.
25	Q. Is it your belief that the only
0031
1	reason that people continue to smoke is
2	because of nicotine addiction?
3	A. For the vast preponderance of the
4	American public, that is the principal
5	reason for the continuation of smoking is
6	addiction maintenance. I mean, that's just
7	a -- you know, a well-established fact of
8	tobacco scholarship, tobacco control or
9	tobacco behavioral research.
10	Q. Let me just ask you, do you
11	consider nicotine addiction to be within
12	your area of expertise?
13	A. No. I'm not a pharmacologist, and
14	so I don't intend to offer opinions on
15	that, but, you know, the issues came up.
16	I've read, you know, in that area, and I
17	know a little bit about it. No, I don't
18	intend to offer opinions about the
19	pharmacology of nicotine addiction.
20	Q. So at least we agree that the
21	reasons why people would smoke could be
22	multifactorial, correct?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. Can you say that Mr. Calloway
25	started smoking because of advertising
0032
1	versus other factors? Can you say that to
2	any degree of historical certainty as you
3	sit here today?
4	A. He as an individual distinct from
5	groups of people?
6	Q. Yes, sir.
7	A. No. I don't have --1 can talk
8	about tendencies, trends, the historical
9	context of smoking initiation as a
10	population-based behavior, as a demographic
11	behavior, but -- and for demographic
12	subgroups as we were talking about, but I
13	can't make up, in essence, a kind of
14	historical diagnosis of him as an
15	individual distinct from that broader
16	historical process that I just described.
17	Q. Similarly, you can't make a
18	historical diagnosis that Mr. Calloway
19	continued to smoke because of advertising
20	as opposed to the other multifactorial
21	explanations; is that correct?
22	A. Again, my answer would be the
23	same. You know, we know tendencies. We
24	know the reality of cigarette marketing.
25	You know, a lot of the story is
0033
1	not so much continuing or not continuing to
2	smoke, at least from my expert opinions, as
3	much as the way in which different products
4	changed the cigarette market over time,
5	filters, lights and things like that.
6	Q. But in terms of the historical
7	diagnosis, to I guess use your term, of Mr.
8	Calloway, you can't make a historical
9	diagnosis that he continued to smoke
10	because of advertising as opposed to the
11	other factors that can explain his
12	behavior, correct?
13	A. That's right. And I've never done
14	that in the past and don't anticipate --1
15	mean, I'll be consistent. My testimony is
16	going to be consistent with prior testimony
17	particularly on that issue.
18	Q. You don't have any particular
19	information about any specific advertising
20	from R.J. Reynolds that Mr. Calloway saw;
21	is that correct?
22	A. Well, that's a complicated
23	question. I mean, that's a long question,
24	so I'll start at the back end of your
25	question and work my way forward.
0034
1	That Mr. Calloway saw, if that's
2	essentially the same kind of thing we were
3	talking about earlier relating to all
4	cigarette advertising or I'm putting him in
5	the chair, so to speak, with a magazine or
6	a TV show in front of him, no, I can't do
7	that.
8	To go to the front half of your
9	question, I do have a significant amount of
10	material in Reynolds products as they
11	advertised in the media that Mr. Calloway
12	is reported to have at least encountered to
13	some degree.
14	So I can say the first half, but
15	the second half, which I interpret to be
16	part specific, again, like putting him in a
17	-- in his hands, so to speak, no, I cannot
18	do that.
19	I hate to give you that
20	long-winded answer. If you want to pare it
21	down, we can move quicker on that because
22	I'm going to be consistent with all the
23	other companies in that line of
24	questioning.
25	Q. Also fair to say that, again,
0035
1	putting him in the historical chair, you
2	can't say that Mr. Calloway was influenced
3	in his smoking by any Reynolds ads that he
4	saw, can you?
5	A. Well, again, you know, my position
6	is that this -- well, let's take a product,
7	Salem, to use a specific product, heavily
8	marketed, mentholated product, heavily
9	marketed nationally to everyone, but in
10	particular to African-American smokers,
11	widely available.
12	We haven't talked about
13	billboards. That's another form of
14	marketing. Point-of-purchase marketing at
15	the store, at the gas stations and the
16	markets where one would buy cigarettes.
17	The advertising was extensive,
18	widely disseminated and nearly everywhere.
19	So the best I can say is, well, you know, I
20	mean, it's a reasonable historical
21	inference to say that it did have
22	influence, but I can't put him in front of
23	a particular ad at a particular point in
24	time.
25	Q. And you can't say for sure that
0036
1	Mr. Calloway was specifically influenced by
2	Salem ads, can you?
3	A. No. I can talk about the -- you
4	know, the kinds of marketing and the kind
5	of advertisements that were used, for
6	example, for Salem, but I can't say what
7	particular thought process went on in his
8	head, except to the extent that he used the
9	product. That's one of the products he is
10	purported to have used.
11	Q. Do you know whether Mr. Calloway
12	ever saw the Frank statement?
13	A. I don't.
14	Q. Did you make any review -- and I
15	may have asked you this earlier -- of the
16	type of television shows that Mr. Calloway
17	watched?
18	A. You did ask me that. And, again,
19	he's reported to have watched television.
20	Apparently had a fondness for westerns.
21	Q. Beyond that, anything that you
22	know of in terms of his television viewing
23	habits?
24	A. No.
25	MS. GOTTLIEB: Objection, asked
0037
1	and answered.
2	MR. SEBOLD:
3	Q. Did you review what he may have
4	listened to on the radio?
5	A. No. I mean, I've researched the
6	history of the industry, cigarette news
7	coverage on the radio generally. These
8	things especially tended to be part of the
9	national networks. As it relates to Mr.
10	Calloway, specifically what stations he
11	liked, for example, I don't have enough
12	information on that.
13	Q. Did you check out -- in the area
14	of the country in Florida that he lived,
15	did you make any survey of the radio
16	contents as it related to tobacco and
17	smoking issues?
18	A. No.
19	Q. Just maybe so we can shorthand it,
20	how would you describe the geographic
21	region that he lived in in Florida?
22	A. Oh. In Florida?
23	Q. Yes.
24	A. You mean where did he live in
25	Florida?
0038
1	Q. Yeah. Exactly.
2	A. Fort Lauderdale, in that area,
3	Melbourne, some time in Melbourne. It was
4	either he or his wife -- Fort Pierce, maybe
5	they had some time in Fort Pierce.
6	Q. But for the most part, your
7	understanding is he was in the Fort
8	Lauderdale and Melbourne area?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. During his time in Florida?
11	A. Correct, during his time in
12	Florida.
13	Q. Did you see anything in the
14	deposition that characterized Mr.
15	Calloway's personality? Some people are
16	characterized as strong willed. Some
17	people are characterized as a hard worker.
18	Anything that you saw in terms of how you
19	would characterize Mr. Calloway?
20	A. There were discussions of that.
21	Frequently the deposer would ask questions
22	like that. None of that really made a
23	particular impression upon me as providing
24	information that was necessary for my
25	opinions. So I couldn't recharacterize
0039
1	those statements to you today as I sit
2	here.
3	Q. You talked before about historical
4	inference. Just so we're on the same page,
5	how are you using that term?
6	A. Sure. That's a good question.
7	I simply -- it's looking at, you
8	know, historical trends, events, aspects of
9	the past. In this case, the ubiquity of
10	cigarette marketing and then looking at
11	human behavior, for example, smoking rates,
12	and making a judgment as to how the two are
13	connected.
14	Q. I'm sorry. Making a judgment
15	between how what and what are connected?
16	A. How, for example, smoking behavior
17	and marketing are connected causally, as a
18	cause-and-effect connection.
19	Q. Do you consider that to be within
20	your area of expertise, to make a
21	cause-and-effect judgment about smoking
22	behavior and marketing?
23	A. As a historical -- broad
24	historical pattern, yes. Again, not for
25	any particular individual. I'm not going
0040
1	to diagnose any particular individual.
2	Looking at the broad patterns of
3	behavior, for which we have data, and the
4	broad patterns of marketing, for which we
5	also have data, yes, you can do that. It's
6	a reasonable historical inference to
7	connect the two.
8	Q. Have you ever written about that
9	subject, this purported cause-and-effect
10	relationship between smoking behavior and
11	marketing?
12	A. I believe I mentioned that. Not
13	as a standalone publication, no.
14	Q. Do you have any peer-review
15	literature you've done on the purported
16	cause-and-effect relationship between
17	smoking behavior and cigarette marketing?
18	A. That I draw upon, for example?
19	Q. No. No. No. That you've
20	written, you yourself. Have you written
21	any peer-review literature on that topic?
22	A. No.
23	Q. I haven't had a chance to review
24	your CV in great detail, but do you have
25	any peer-review literature that you've
0041
1	written about cigarette-related topics?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Okay. Do any of them address
4	marketing?
5	A. I wrote a piece on the Grand Ole
6	Opry and tobacco marketing.
7	Q. Have you ever written any
8	peer-review literature on African-American
9	marketing on cigarettes and tobacco
10	products?
11	A. No.
12	Q. Other than the Grand Ole Opry
13	piece, which I look forward to reading, any
14	other peer-review literature relating to
15	cigarette marketing?
16	A. I believe I discussed the subject
17	in a piece I published in Tobacco Control
18	in 2006.
19	Q. Anything else that I could look at
20	in your CV that would address peer-review
21	writing on smoking behavior and marketing?
22	A. Those two.
23	Q. Okay. I said anything else.
24	A. Oh. I'm sorry. So my correct
25	answer would be no, nothing else. Sorry
0042
1	about that.
2	Q. Let's talk a little bit about Mr.
3	Calloway's smoking history. Did you review
4	his smoking history?
5	A. Well, again, as it's reported in
6	the depositions.
7	Q. Do you know when he began smoking?
8	MS. GOTTLIEB: Objection, asked
9	and answered.
10	A. I don't know exactly when he began
11	smoking, no.
12	MR. SEBOLD:
13	Q. Do you know in what era? I mean,
14	was he in his teens, his 20s, his 30s?
15	A. Well, he very likely began smoking
16	as a teenager, as the vast preponderance of
17	people who begin smoking do so when they're
18	teenagers. That's just a well-established
19	fact of smoking initiation.
20	So, again, it's very likely that
21	he began in his teens while he was
22	presumably in Hattiesburg.
23	Q. Did anybody say that in a
24	deposition, or is that your historical
25	inference?
0043
1	A. Again, that's just an inference.
2	It's likely, but I can't say for sure
3	because I don't recall getting that
4	detailed information.
5	Q. Do you know who Mr. Calloway was
6	with when he got his first cigarette?
7	A. His brother -- there's a
8	deposition with his brother who was just a
9	couple years younger than him. There may
10	be some discussion about it. I'd have to
11	refresh my recollection on --
12	Q. Do you know whether -- I'm sorry.
13	A. To finish, I'd just have to
14	refresh my recollection on that particular
15	issue.
16	Q. Do you know whether Mr. Calloway
17	saw any marketing or advertising of
18	cigarettes before he had his first
19	cigarette?
20	A. Again, I can't put him in a
21	specific place like we were referring to
22	earlier. The best I can say is that
23	cigarette advertising was extensive and
24	pervasive, including in a place like
25	Hattiesburg. Cigarettes were available.
0044
1	They were sold by a variety of means. But
2	I can't put a particular ad in front of his
3	eyes, for example, at a particular point in
4	time.
5	Q. Okay. And you can't say either,
6	Doctor, can you, that any marketing of
7	cigarettes actually caused Mr. Calloway to
8	start smoking, correct?
9	A. No. I can't put any particular
10	marketing --1 can simply describe what was
11	going on.
12	Q. Do you know whether Mr. Calloway's
13	father was a smoker?
14	A. I do know that. Yes. He was.
15	Both his parents are reported to have been
16	smokers.
17	Q. Do you know where Mr. Calloway got
18	his first cigarettes?
19	A. It's a lot of deposition material,
20	and I'm trying to recall. His brother may
21	have indicated that he got cigarettes from
22	his parents, but I'd have to check that. I
23	don't know exactly as I sit here. I'm not
24	exactly sure.
25	Q. Did you read his brother Ronnie's
0045
1	deposition?
2	A. Yes. His brother's -- yes.
3	Q. Okay. And in terms of reviewing
4	Mr. Ronnie Calloway's deposition, is it
5	fair to say that Ronnie was keenly aware of
6	the risks of smoking during his lifetime?
7	A. For him personally?
8	Q. Uh-huh (affirmative).
9	A. That may or may not have been the
10	case. I just did not --1 was really
11	interested only in the --in Mr. Johnnie
12	Calloway, so I don't recall either way.
13	Q. Why is that? Wouldn't you want to
14	know what the multiple influences were on a
15	particular individual?
16	A. Just as I sit here, I can't
17	characterize Mr. Ronnie Calloway's
18	knowledge.
19	Q. Right. But when you're trying to
20	draw these historical inferences, isn't it
21	important to know all the factors that
22	might have an influence on an individual?
23	A. As much as -- as much as one could
24	know, yes.
25	Q. Sure. And you would agree,
0046
1	wouldn't you, Doctor, that family members
2	are likely to have a significant influence
3	on another family member, or they -- isn't
4	it fair to say that family members may very
5	well have an influence on their -- other
6	members of the family as it relates to
7	smoking?
8	A. They might. You know, it's often
9	reported that people have family members
10	that object to their smoking. It's very
11	difficult to disentangle that. That's
12	certainly one of numerous factors.
13	Q. And how about whether Ronnie
14	Calloway urged his brother to stop smoking,
15	do you know that?
16	A. Help me --1 believe there's two
17	brothers. There's one significantly
18	younger than him and one closer in age. A
19	number of people -- he may have urged him
20	to stop smoking. That wouldn't be a --
21	that would certainly be, you know, part of
22	his family dynamic.
23	Q. Which of his brothers was he
24	closest to?
25	A. I believe --1 would anticipate
0047
1	the one that was closest to him in age.
2	Q. And which one was that?
3	A. Well, I'd have to --1 brought
4	them with me. I'd have to look at the
5	names and refresh my recollection, and I
6	brought them in response to the Schedule A
7	of the notice.
8	Q. Okay. But as we're talking
9	history right now, you're just not sure
10	which of the brothers he was closest to?
11	A. Right. I knew that one brother
12	was closer to him in age. I'm just kind of
13	getting the names confused.
14	Again, I'm not the biographer of
15	Mr. Calloway.
16	Q. Along those lines, do you know
17	what Mr. Calloway's reaction was to his
18	first cigarette, whether he liked it or
19	disliked it?
20	A. I don't know that. I didn't see
21	anything on that.
22	Q. Do you know anything about the
23	brand of cigarette that Mr. Calloway first
24	started smoking?
25	A. I did not learn that.
0048
1	Q. Did you learn anything about when
2	Mr. Calloway -- let me ask you this: Do
3	you characterize Mr. Calloway as a regular
4	smoker?
5	A. Yes. He -- it's pretty clear that
6	he was a regular smoker. Yes.
7	Q. Do you know when he became a
8	regular smoker?
9	A. That's not so clear.
10	Q. I use the term, but it seems like
11	you are, too. How do you characterize a
12	regular smoker?
13	A. Well, an addicted smoker.
14	Certainly at a minimum somebody who smoked
15	every day.
16	Q. So in your mind, someone that
17	smokes every day no matter the amount, are
18	they a regular smoker?
19	A. Well, that's your term. I'm just
20	simply trying to understand what you're --
21	you know, what you're trying to get from
22	me.
23	He's reported to be a -- sometimes
24	a two-pack-a-day smoker in the depositions.
25	It's a fairly broad agreement on that from
0049
1	a number of different perspectives. That
2	would certainly fall under the category of
3	regular. I have no independent personal
4	definition of what regular is.
5	Q. Did you make any survey of the
6	brands of cigarettes that Mr. Calloway was
7	reported to have smoked?
8	A. Well, he was reported from a
9	number of sources in the depositions to
10	have smoked a set of brands, I mean, the
11	specific brands that were mentioned.
12	Q. And I think you mentioned Salem at
13	one point; is that correct?
14	A. That's right.
15	Q. Do you have any indication of how
16	long he smoked Salem?
17	A. No.
18	Q. Did you make any other study of
19	how long a time period he smoked any
20	particular brand?
21	A. That was -- there was not enough
22	information in the fact depositions that I
23	reviewed to get to that level of detail in
24	his smoking history. It's just simply a
25	mentioning of a set of brands.
0050
1	Q. But in terms of any ability to
2	individualize and make a survey of how long
3	he smoked a particular brand, you didn't
4	have the facts to do that?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. Do you know whether he smoked
7	filtered or unfiltered cigarettes?
8	A. Yes, I do.
9	Q. What's your understanding in that
10	regard?
11	A. Well, my understanding -- well,
12	again, based on the set of brands that he's
13	reported to have smoked, filtered
14	cigarettes were within that population of
15	brands, and so, therefore, he smoked them
16	--he smoked filtered brands. Salem, Kool,
17	Newports, for example, those are all
18	filtered, Alpine.
19	Q. Do you know what -- I'm sorry.
20	Were you finished?
21	A. Well, those are some of the
22	brands. There's a large set of brands. I
23	don't have them all memorized, but --
24	Q. Do you know what --
25	A. Let me finish. They're mostly
0051
1	filtered brands.
2	Q. Do you know whether he had a
3	preference between filtered and unfiltered?
4	A. Well, it seems that most of the
5	brands that were mentioned were filtered,
6	so I would infer that he preferred those
7	based on what's reported in terms of his
8	smoking history.
9	Q. Do you know what years he smoked
10	any particular brand?
11	A. Well, you kind of asked me that
12	already. It's not -- I'm not able from the
13	information that I have to give a detailed
14	smoking history of Mr. Calloway.
15	Q. As a result, then, when we look
16	through your reliance materials, you're not
17	able to identify ads for the brands that he
18	smoked from the particular point in time
19	that he was actually smoking those brands,
20	are you?
21	A. Right. That's true. Because I
22	don't know when he was smoking particular
23	brands.
24	Q. Did you see any indication in the
25	materials that Mr. Calloway chose a brand
0052
1	because of any particular cigarette
2	advertising that he read or saw or heard?
3	A. No, I did not.
4	Q. And you didn't see anything in the
5	case-specific materials you reviewed, did
6	you, that Mr. Calloway chose a brand
7	because of any tobacco industry statements
8	he read, saw or heard, did you?
9	A. No, I did not.
10	Q. And are you going to be offering
11	any opinions why Mr. Calloway smoked any
12	particular brand ?
13	A. He as an individual?
14	Q. Yes.
15	A. No, I'm not going to -- and,
16	again, this goes -- we began our interview
17	or line of questioning with --1 can't give
18	like a diagnosis of his particular smoking
19	situation.
20	Q. Did you see any evidence in the
21	historical record indicating why Mr.
22	Calloway may have switched brands?
23	A. Well, there is, you know, some
24	indication that he -- well, it's reported
25	that he smoked light cigarettes because he
0053
1	believed they were better for him, is the
2	language used, and so that would be an
3	example, the only example that I have.
4	Q. And you didn't see any indication
5	in the case-specific materials that you
6	reviewed, did you, that Mr. Calloway
7	changed his brand because of any cigarette
8	advertising or marketing that he saw or
9	read; is that fair to say?
10	A. Not direct evidence related to
11	him, no. It gets back to the earlier way
12	that I conceived this, as kind of a broad
13	tendency, general behavior of smokers in
14	the United States.
15	Q. But in terms of any specific
16	advertising campaign, for example, you
17	can't link that up to Mr. Calloway; is that
18	fair to say?
19	A. That's fair to say, yes.
20	Q. And you didn't see anything in the
21	case-specific materials you reviewed, did
22	you, that Mr. Calloway ever changed brands
23	because of any tobacco industry statements
24	that he read or saw; is that right?
25	A. That's correct. Similar --
0054
1	similar answer to the previous question.
2	Yes.
3	Q. And in terms of his smoking
4	behavior, did you take a look, for example,
5	at how long it took him to smoke a
6	cigarette?
7	A. You mean an individual cigarette?
8	Q. Right.
9	A. I don't recall anything responsive
10	to that in the evidence. But, no, I didn't
11	look at that.
12	Q. Did you look at how deeply he
13	inhaled his cigarettes?
14	A. There's a mention of that in the
15	deposition that I'm recalling that someone
16	reports. He did inhale.
17	Q. Okay. But beyond that, did you
18	see anything else?
19	A. There's some reference to
20	inhaling, but I'm not recalling the details
21	right now.
22	Q. You mentioned light cigarettes.
23	Was there any indication in the historical
24	record that he changed his smoking behavior
25	in response to light cigarettes?
0055
1	A. When you say change, I'm not sure
2	what you mean.
3	Q. Smoking more or less, for example,
4	when he was smoking light cigarettes.
5	A. I'm not recollecting anything like
6	that as I sit here.
7	Q. Or changed how he approached an
8	individual cigarette when he was smoking,
9	any indication in the historical record
10	that he inhaled less or more when smoking
11	lights?
12	A. I don't know. I don't have any
13	knowledge of that right now.
14	Q. And I apologize because I'm pretty
15	sure I did ask you this in the beginning,
16	but in terms of any quit efforts that Mr.
17	Calloway made, do you know when, if ever,
18	Mr. Calloway first tried to quit smoking
19	cigarettes?
20	A. I don't.
21	Q. And do you know how many times, if
22	any, Mr. Calloway tried to quit smoking
23	cigarettes?
24	A. I don't.
25	Q. Let me know if you need a break.
0056
1	We'll take one probably in another 15 or 20
2	minutes, but if you need one before that,
3	just let me know. Okay?
4	A. (Nods head affirmatively.)
5	Q. Doctor, I wanted to talk a minute
6	about your reliance materials. And without
7	going into any painstaking detail, can
8	you --
9	MR. SEBOLD: And maybe we'll just
10	mark this, to move this along here.
11	(Exhibit Number 1 was marked.)
12	MR. SEBOLD:
13	Q. Doctor, I'm going to show you
14	what's been marked as Exhibit Number 1. It
15	has your name, and then it says Reliance
16	List. It doesn't really have page numbers,
17	but it's fairly thick, and it came off a
18	jump drive that I was provided by
19	plaintiffs counsel.
20	I'm going to tell you, that's my
21	understanding that that's at least your
22	first set of reliance materials that we've
23	been provided in the case.
24	Does that look generally familiar
25	to you?
0057
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. Okay. And, again, without going
3	into painstaking detail, can you just give
4	me a brief overview of how that's
5	organized?
6	A. Yes. And the short answer is not
7	very well, and I apologize for that. In my
8	defense, it's an overwhelming amount of
9	material, and I -- you know, I bum things
10	to my hard drive, little portable hard
11	drive where I keep this stuff, and
12	periodically I make DVDs and give it to
13	y'all. So there is some disconnect on
14	what's on the hard drive and what I managed
15	to put in the spreadsheet.
16	This is basically mostly internal
17	documents. I would characterize it as
18	mostly internal documents with some
19	brand-specific materials towards the end as
20	they relate to marketing and advertising.
21	And I believe that this is
22	similar, very similar to the reliance list
23	I put together for the Alexander case I
24	referred to earlier. And that was the last
25	time I put a lot of time into trying to get
0058
1	the list in usable format.
2	And so as I go through this, it's
3	-- my newspapers are in here, my New York
4	Times by date. It's a lot of material.
5	Q. And how did you select the
6	materials that are reflected in Exhibit 1 ?
7	A. This is --1 mean, this is the
8	work of many years of just collecting and
9	reading industry internal documents,
10	collecting newspapers and magazine stories
11	and just -- you know, every time I find
12	something interesting, I put it in the
13	file.
14	This is a lot of material. I
15	understand that.
16	Q. Have you conducted a survey of the
17	advertising, cigarette advertising in the
18	area of Florida where Mr. Calloway spent
19	most of his living years?
20	A. Not specifically for Florida, no.
21	For that area, no.
22	Q. In Exhibit Number 1, as you said,
23	there are obviously a lot of materials.
24	Are there any specific materials that
25	you're relying on for Mr. Calloway's case?
0059
1	A. Yeah. I mean, I anticipate my
2	testimony and my exhibits to be generally
3	similar to the kinds of things I've talked
4	about, for example, in the Hess case or the
5	Alexander case, the Sherman case, which was
6	another Engle Progeny case.
7	Things that I rely heavily on, for
8	example, will be the surveys of smoking
9	behavior. For example, The Tobacco
10	Institute began these polls of smoking
11	behavior beginning in the late 1950s. Some
12	of them were done by the manufacturers.
13	Philip Morris did a few. So there's
14	surveys of smoking behavior. You can call
15	them polls, although they tend to go beyond
16	that.
17	Things like internal documents
18	that relate to the goals of the
19	manufacturers, in terms of how they
20	responded to the smoking/health challenge
21	in the 1950s and their goal with the
22	public's fear over the risks of smoking,
23	and that I think continued into the '60s
24	and '70s. The Hill & Knowlton documents,
25	for example, are important in my analysis.
0060
1	In this particular case, there's a
2	set of documents in which both Brown &
3	Williamson and R.J. Reynolds in particular
4	begin to really look more carefully at --
5	and Philip Morris as well. They apply to
6	this, too -- looking more carefully at
7	various subgroups of the smoking public,
8	kind of more carefully and with greater
9	sophistication dividing the mass market of
10	smokers into racial, age, other kind of
11	demographic and social categories and,
12	therefore, shaping their approach.
13	For example, Kool, utopian values,
14	which is a Kool marketing document, Brown &
15	Williamson obviously, where they outline
16	their goals for that particular product. I
17	think it's a 1979 document.
18	Myron Johnson has a good report on
19	filter cigarettes from the mid 1960s that
20	explains the Philip Morris position on
21	that. That's a document that I think is
22	very useful.
23	I mean, I could go on. I'm sorry.
24	It's a lot of material that I've looked at
25	over the years.
0061
1	Q. All right. I'll call it kind of a
2	historical review of the tobacco industry.
3	Have you conducted a historical review of
4	any other industries or manufacturers?
5	A. Well, I've written on the history
6	of the lumber industry. That's in my book.
7	There's a significant discussion there.
8	Q. Let me be more specific. I'm
9	sorry.
10	In terms of marketing and
11	marketing efforts, have you written on any
12	other industries other than the tobacco
13	industry?
14	A. No. Just--in that regard, just
15	tobacco.
16	Q. In this I'll call it, again,
17	historical review of the tobacco industry,
18	did you begin that as part of your academic
19	work, or did you begin that at the request
20	of plaintiffs lawyers for the tobacco
21	litigation?
22	A. Well, I began it before I got
23	involved in litigation as an expert
24	witness. I've written about tobacco
25	growing.
0062
1	Back in the mid '90s, I
2	interviewed, for example, the head of the
3	Flue-Cured Cooperative Tobacco
4	Stabilization Corp. and growers' marketing
5	organization for an oral history project.
6	I was involved in efforts to connect
7	academic research with public policymakers
8	to try to help chart a future for the
9	tobacco south as tobacco agriculture was
10	undergoing significant transformation.
11	This would be my years in North Carolina.
12	I moved to the industry actions
13	and the industry's internal actions in
14	marketing cigarettes specifically once I
15	got involved in this particular activity,
16	and as those documents became available,
17	this is, again, in the late '90s.
18	Q. So your academic work was focussed
19	more on sort of the agricultural aspects of
20	tobacco growing; is that fair to say?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And then your litigation-related
23	work was focussed on marketing and these
24	internal documents and things along those
25	lines; is that fair to say?
0063
1	A. Yes. I moved up the production
2	chain a bit.
3	Q. All right. That's one way to look
4	at it.
5	So you had written about marketing
6	campaigns and marketing efforts of the
7	cigarette companies prior to engaging in
8	litigation; is that correct?
9	A. That's correct. Yes.
10	MR. SEBOLD: This was also
11	included with your reliance materials.
12	We're going to mark this as Exhibit 2.
13	(Exhibit Number 2 was marked.)
14	MR. SEBOLD:
15	Q. The court reporter has handed you
16	Exhibit Number 2, and for those of us that
17	aren't here in person, it appears to be a
18	number of folders that I'm assuming are
19	also I think on the jump drive, and they're
20	listed by title and category.
21	Can you briefly describe for me
22	what's reflected here in Exhibit 2?
23	A. Yeah. This is a screen shot of
24	the folders. It's pretty clear of that.
25	And it's -- these are the documents that I
0064
1	keep. And I've tried to put them in
2	folders that are explanatory so that people
3	can use it. So they're by subject, or at
4	least how I interpret their relevance to
5	me.
6	So, for example, in terms of the
7	folders, it's pretty self-explanatory.
8	African-American Ads, Alpine, ATC Docs,
9	stands for American Tobacco Company, BAT
10	Docs, Bonsack, and there's some materials
11	there related to the cigarette machine, so
12	that kind of thing.
13	Q. Yeah. And you don't have to go
14	through each one.
15	A. Yeah.
16	Q. I just want to make sure I
17	understand. How does Exhibit 2 relate to
18	Exhibit 1, which is your reliance
19	materials?
20	A. There is a high level of
21	congruence, but think of it as a diagram in
22	which the two circles don't completely
23	overlap. And this is just the -- you know,
24	my own difficulties. I don't have a staff
25	to help keep track of these records, and
0065
1	the time constraints are pressing on me.
2	There are some materials that are
3	listed in the document list that are not
4	saved on this hard drive, and the reason is
5	that many of these documents have URLs to
6	the Legacy database or tobaccodocuments.org
7	database.
8	These are on the repositories,
9	durable repositories, long-term
10	repositories. They're also on the
11	manufacturers' Web site. So I can click on
12	the link to get the document and don't have
13	to use the storage space.
14	Some of the newspaper stories are
15	not on this. I don't have copies. I just
16	looked at them and recorded the citation.
17	Many of them I had in paper form, and I
18	have subsequently lost those paper copies.
19	MR. SEBOLD: Just to kind of close
20	the loop or maybe open it even further, I'm
21	going to show you what we're going to mark
22	as Exhibit Number 3, which has your name,
23	and then it says Supplemental Reliance
24	Materials.
25	(Exhibit Number 3 was marked.)
0066
1	MR. SEBOLD:
2	Q. There are I would say --1 don't
3	know what the front cover reflects -- maybe
4	seven or eight entries reflected on Exhibit
5	Number 3, and then there are some backup
6	materials, it looks like.
7	Can you tell me how Exhibit 3 was
8	gathered?
9	A. Yeah. These are just copies from
10	the microfilm of a newspaper called
11	Hattiesburg American, which is a local
12	Hattiesburg paper from the 1940s that I got
13	from the library from my university --
14	well, actually, I had to go down to the
15	public library in Hattiesburg.
16	They are examples of ads that
17	appeared in the paper in the 1940s, in the
18	Hattiesburg paper.
19	Q. Exhibit 3 is -- are some ads that
20	you found that were in the Hattiesburg
21	paper in the 1940s?
22	A. Yes. And then there's a couple of
23	other things, too, which I can characterize
24	to you, if you'd like.
25	Q. Please.
0067
1	A. There's a table I put together
2	from a historical work, a book called
3	Dark Journey: Black Mississippians in the
4	Age of Jim Crow, which summarizes school
5	expenditures. So that might be technically
6	demonstrative, if you want to call it that.
7	It's data taken from that book, which
8	itself is derived from State Department of
9	Education data.
10	And then I searched for
11	Hattiesburg in the industry archives and
12	found a couple letters from the mid '50s,
13	and I just threw them in there. They were
14	interesting. Those are the last two items.
15	And these I sent to the plaintiffs
16	not that long ago, maybe a week or so,
17	fairly recently.
18	MR. BRENNER: Can I see what
19	you're holding?
20	MR. SEBOLD:
21	Q. And what caused you to gather the
22	materials that are reflected in Exhibit
23	Number 3?
24	A. Well, I was interested in the kind
25	of advertisements that might have appeared
0068
1	in the Hattiesburg newspaper. I went down,
2	and since it was right there available to
3	me, I went and did a review.
4	Q. And so these are microfilm,
5	microfiche from the Hattiesburg paper?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. How would we know if we're looking
8	through here, first of all, that it even
9	came from the Hattiesburg paper and,
10	second, from what time period it's from?
11	A. Well, the way I did it was I
12	grouped them by year in the computer file,
13	which I mail to the attorneys, and so the
14	computer file has the dates. It's from
15	1942, '43, '44. That's the years.
16	Q. Do you have any indication that
17	Mr. Calloway was looking at the Hattiesburg
18	paper back in 1942 or '43 or '44?
19	A. I don't really know.
20	Q. Do you know how old he was in
21	let's say 1942?
22	A. Would have been turning 10 that
23	year.
24	Q. In your experience, are
25	10-year-olds big readers of a newspaper
0069
1	typically?
2	A. I don't know. I read the paper
3	when I was 10, but for Mr. Calloway, I
4	couldn't say.
5	Q. Okay. And do you have any feel
6	for whether African-American 10- or
7	12-year-olds in Hattiesburg, Mississippi
8	were big paper readers in the 1940s?
9	A. I just don't have an opinion on
10	that.
11	Q. Okay. And fair to say that any of
12	the ads reflected in Exhibit Number 3, you
13	don't have any indication one way or
14	another that Mr. Calloway saw any of these,
15	correct?
16	A. Right. My answer is consistent to
17	the earlier line of questioning about that
18	issue.
19	Q. I may have asked you this
20	regarding light cigarettes, but is there
21	any evidence that you saw indicating that
22	Mr. Calloway ever relied upon any ads or
23	industry statements regarding light
24	cigarettes?
25	A. Again, a specific ad or a specific
0070
1	statement, I can't say.
2	Q. Do you intend to talk about any
3	youth advertising in this particular case?
4	A. I might if asked. There's lots of
5	youth advertising at the time. I mean,
6	there's sports figures, comic figures. If
7	asked, I'll discuss that.
8	Q. Well, do you have any indication
9	of what -- given that the trial may not be
10	that far away, of what you intend to
11	testify about?
12	Well, first of all, do you intend
13	to testify at trial in the Calloway case?
14	A. My understanding is that they want
15	to bring me in to testify. That's my
16	understanding.
17	Q. And do you have an understanding
18	as to what topics you're going to be asked
19	to testify about?
20	A. I haven't discussed that with the
21	plaintiffs attorneys.
22	Q. I'm sorry. You have or have not?
23	A. I have not.
24	I anticipate talking about the
25	kinds of things I talked about in the
0071
1	trials I mentioned previously. I intend to
2	be consistent with the scope of material as
3	in the prior testimony and opinions with
4	prior testimony consistency.
5	Q. Have you testified about Joe Camel
6	and whether that was targeted to youth?
7	A. I don't believe I ever testified
8	about Joe Camel in a trial. I may have
9	been asked questions about him in
10	depositions. But, no, I don't believe I've
11	ever testified about that at trial.
12	Q. Have you offered opinions about
13	Joe Camel and whether that was
14	youth-targeted advertising?
15	A. Well, I don't recall that I've
16	offered an opinion about Joe Camel. I
17	mean, it's well established that it is
18	youth-targeted advertising. That's clear
19	from a broad body of research, but that's
20	not something that I've ever talked about
21	in the past.
22	Q. Is that something you intend to
23	talk about in this particular case?
24	A. It had not occurred to me until
25	you brought it up. So as I sit here, I
0072
1	don't think it's going to come up. But,
2	again, I -- you know, they can ask me
3	questions about whatever they want, I
4	guess, or whatever they're allowed to ask.
5	Q. There you go. Now you're catching
6	on.
7	All right. In terms of Joe Camel,
8	do you know when the first Joe Camel ad ran
9	in the United States?
10	A. The very first Joe Camel? Oh,
11	gosh. I'm not exactly sure. No. I'd have
12	to review that.
13	Q. Is there any testimony that you
14	saw in the record indicating that Mr.
15	Calloway relied upon any ads featuring
16	celebrities or athletes?
17	A. In the evidentiary record, I don't
18	recall seeing anything relevant to that.
19	Q. And fair to say that it was not
20	unusual to see celebrities in the cigarette
21	ads during the 1960s?
22	A. Well, there's a point where the
23	industry moved away from explicit
24	celebrities. They began dropping sports
25	figures and stuff. It was in the 1960s. I
0073
1	think I'm recalling now they came out with
2	an advertising -- what did they call it?
3	Basically an advertising agreement with the
4	manufacturers around '64.
5	After that, I believe that's when
6	they -- certainly by then they stopped
7	using celebrities. Before then they were
8	fairly common.
9	So to make a more accurate
10	statement, in the 1950s, it was common to
11	see celebrities in cigarette advertising
12	and prior to that.
13	Q. I should have asked you, when you
14	were looking at the Hattiesburg paper from
15	the 1940s, do you know whether Mr.
16	Calloway's parents were regular readers of
17	the Hattiesburg paper?
18	A. I don't know.
19	Q. Do you know whether they had a
20	subscription to the Hattiesburg paper?
21	A. I don't know if they had that.
22	Q. Do you know whether Mr. Calloway
23	had access at home to the Hattiesburg paper
24	in the 1940s?
25	A. I just don't know.
0074
1	The advertising code, that was the
2	term I was trying to think of in my prior
3	answer.
4	MR. SEBOLD: Can we go off the
5	record for a minute and take a five-minute
6	break?
7	(Off the record.)
8	MR. SEBOLD:
9	Q. I think we were talking about
10	celebrity advertising in the '60s.
11	Are you taking any position that
12	cigarette advertising with celebrities was
13	any different than advertising of any other
14	products during that time period?
15	A. Well, I mean, the difference was
16	the product was different.
17	Q. But in terms of approach, isn't it
18	true that many products were advertised
19	with celebrities during the 1960s?
20	A. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Other -- other
21	manufacturers also sought to build
22	awareness of their product and a favorable
23	response to their product through the use
24	of identifying the product with well-known
25	sports, movie, entertainment, musical
0075
1	figures. Yes.
2	Q. Other than the product being
3	different, is there any -- have you
4	observed any different approach that the
5	cigarette manufacturers used as it related
6	to celebrity advertisers compared to other
7	products?
8	A. No. The celebrity promoters of —
9	or the celebrity participants, I guess --
10	kind of awkwardly phrased -- in the
11	advertisements, like other advertisements,
12	presented the product as something fun,
13	desirable, you know, that you should buy.
14	Q. Some of your reliance materials
15	include reference to the New York Times; is
16	that correct?
17	A. That's correct. I have a large
18	number of those articles.
19	Q. In fact, a lot of the newspapers
20	that you cite are the New York Times; is
21	that right?
22	A. When you say cite, you mean like
23	in an expert report?
24	Q. Well, that's one place.
25	Is it fair to say in expert
0076
1	reports you've often cited the New York
2	Times?
3	A. Yes. That's correct.
4	Q. And in your reliance materials,
5	are there a fair amount of those that are
6	drawn from the New York Times?
7	A. Yes. I've looked at the New York
8	Times. I've looked at Chicago Tribune.
9	I've looked at a wide variety of papers,
10	but especially the New York Times. It's a
11	paper of record.
12	Q. Do you know whether Mr. Calloway
13	ever read the New York Times?
14	A. I don't know that he read it or
15	didn't read it. I have no information on
16	that.
17	Q. Did the New York Times operate a
18	wire service?
19	A. They did. They operated the
20	secondary news wire service. Yes.
21	Q. During what years?
22	A. What years? I think I used to
23	know this. Certainly in the '60s and the
24	'70s. I don't know exactly the beginning
25	date of that activity.
0077
1	Q. For the cigarette brands that Mr.
2	Calloway was identified as having smoked,
3	have you gone through your reliance
4	materials and identified particular ads
5	that relate to those particular brands?
6	A. Well, there are some that are kind
7	of groups. You know, there's Alpine,
8	should be some Kool, Salem. So I've done
9	that somewhat. Yes.
10	Q. Did you do that for this
11	particular case, or is that just generally
12	how you grouped your materials?
13	A. I went back through my materials
14	for this case as part of a process of
15	getting better control over my materials.
16	Q. And in doing that, did you try to
17	organize them by brand in some fashion?
18	A. Somewhat, yes.
19	Q. And have you pulled out the
20	particular brands that he smoked and
21	matched those up to particular advertising
22	campaigns?
23	A. Well, I mean, there were certain,
24	you know, campaigns at certain points in
25	time, and I'm familiar with those.
0078
1	Q. Do you intend to testify about
2	particular ad campaigns at a particular
3	point in time?
4	A. I might. Yes. I mean, you know,
5	I'll show the ads and give the -- again, if
6	asked to show the jury -- the kinds of
7	marketing materials, advertising materials
8	that appeared in certain points in time so
9	that they can have a feel for that kind of
10	information that appeared.
11	Q. And can you give me an example
12	without going in great detail of a
13	particular campaign that you think you
14	might talk about?
15	A. I might start, you know, in the
16	1940s and talk about the Lucky Strike and
17	Camel campaign, you know, "Toasted for your
18	throat protection," Lucky Strike, "What
19	cigarette do you smoke, Doctor?" and
20	"T-Zone" for Camel.
21	There's a variety of those that go
22	into the '40s, the military themes in the
23	mid '40s during the World War II period. I
24	go forward, choose others.
25	Q. Have you made any effort to match
0079
1	any particular campaigns up to see whether
2	Mr. Calloway actually saw any of those
3	campaigns?
4	A. Well, I interpret your question as
5	a variety of the line of questioning that
6	we've been dealing with a lot in this
7	deposition, which is putting him in a
8	particular place at a particular time and a
9	particular advertisement, and that, I
10	haven't done. I don't feel that I have
11	enough data to do that.
12	Q. And that would be true for any
13	particular campaign that you would cite,
14	correct?
15	A. That's correct. I mean, what I
16	can do is show the jury what cigarette
17	advertising looked like and represent where
18	it appeared.
19	Q. In terms of whether Mr. Calloway
20	saw it or was influenced by it, you can't
21	make that historical diagnosis; is that
22	correct?
23	A. Him as an individual.
24	MR. SEBOLD: I'm going to ask the
25	court reporter to mark this as Exhibit
0080
1	Number 4. It's labeled with your name, and
2	then it says Second Supplemental Reliance
3	List.
4	(Exhibit Number 4 was marked.)
5	MR. SEBOLD:
6	Q. Doctor, if you could at a high
7	level describe for me what is reflected in
8	Exhibit Number 4, the second reliance list.
9	A. These are printouts of Chicago
10	newspapers that I've researched. These
11	have been part of my standard reliance set
12	that I've provided many times.
13	It does look like the attorneys
14	have made a list for you, and that's good,
15	but these ads are what I've researched over
16	the years.
17	Q. And largely they derive from
18	Chicago newspapers you said?
19	A. This is all Chicago. Yeah.
20	Chicago is one of the cities because of its
21	importance I focussed on. So these are my
22	Chicago exhibits.
23	Q. All right. Do these Chicago
24	exhibits have any relevance to the Calloway
25	case?
0081
1	A. Well, I learned from the
2	depositions that he had spent some time in
3	Chicago, and so that was the reason why.
4	Q. Do you know what time period he
5	was in Chicago?
6	A. Not exactly. It's unclear. You
7	know, people refer to it. It looks like it
8	would have been likely in the '50s, but
9	it's a little bit unclear.
10	Q. And these materials that you've
11	gathered run a gamut looks like from the
12	'50s through the '80s; is that right?
13	A. That's correct. That's just what
14	I have on Chicago.
15	Q. And in terms of whether Mr.
16	Calloway saw or was exposed to any of the
17	materials that are reflected in Exhibit
18	Number 4, you just can't say; is that
19	correct?
20	A. Right. My answer would have to be
21	the same answer like I've been providing
22	today. I can't put him in the chair with a
23	magazine in his hand or in this case the
24	newspaper in his hand.
25	Q. Do you know anything about his
0082
1	newspaper reading habits when he was in
2	Chicago?
3	A. I don't.
4	Q. Doctor, you haven't conducted any
5	research, have you, on whether cigarette
6	advertising causes a particular individual
7	to start smoking, have you?
8	A. On a particular individual, no.
9	Q. What about in general, have you
10	conducted research as to whether
11	advertising caused people to start smoking?
12	A. Yes. At a population level, yes.
13	Q. And what research have you done in
14	that regard?
15	A. Well, I've looked at the
16	advertising. I've looked at behavior,
17	smoking behavior at a population level.
18	That would be prevalence, race, the market,
19	types of cigarettes. I've looked at
20	industry -- the evaluations of the
21	industry's internal research on their
22	marketing. So those are the kinds of work
23	I've done on that.
24	Q. And as you said, you haven't done
25	any research that goes down to the
0083
1	individual level, though, right, in the
2	sense of whether cigarette advertising
3	caused a particular individual like Mr.
4	Calloway to start smoking?
5	A. Not the individual, no.
6	Q. Let's talk about sort of
7	probabilities.
8	Have you done any I'll call it
9	probabilistic analysis to determine whether
10	it's likely or not that Mr. Calloway saw
11	any particular ad?
12	A. Well, when you use that word, I
13	immediately think of a quantitative
14	assessment of the likelihood, like an odds
15	ratio or -- that, I haven't done. I don't
16	know how you could do that.
17	The best you can do on this, given
18	the data that's available, is to give the
19	jury an idea of how pervasive cigarette
20	advertising was.
21	So, for example, we know that Mr.
22	Calloway watched television. We know that
23	in the early '60s, 40 percent of the
24	evening programming was sponsored by
25	cigarette manufacturers. So you put those
0084
1	two together. You can say it's very likely
2	that Mr. Calloway saw cigarette
3	advertisement while watching television.
4	So that's the kind of thing that
5	I've done.
6	Q. I'm sorry?
7	A. That's the kind of analysis I've
8	done.
9	Q. All right. And in terms of his
10	reaction to any particular advertisement,
11	you don't know what that was, do you, as it
12	relates to cigarette advertisement?
13	A. Well, again, my answer would have
14	to be the same along this line of
15	questioning. I just don't know.
16	Q. You touched a little bit on
17	advertising to African-Americans. Are you
18	planning to offer any particular opinions
19	in that regard in this case?
20	A. Well, I mean, that's a significant
21	part of the history of cigarette marketing.
22	So, yes, I would offer some opinions.
23	Q. And what opinions do you intend to
24	offer in that regard?
25	A. Well, there's two trends that are
0085
1	apparent from industry documents. There
2	are two trends that the industry was aware
3	of and sought to capitalize on, to shape
4	and direct. That was the increasing
5	movement of African-American consumers into
6	what we might call mainstream patterns of
7	consumption as they moved from relatively
8	more isolated places say, for example, the
9	rural south, cities and towns both in the
10	region, and in the north or outside of the
11	region. Therefore, increasingly they were
12	a growing market.
13	So the industry begins to identify
14	African-Americans as a market to direct
15	their advertising and marketing efforts
16	towards or as a demographic.
17	Within that, there's also a
18	recognition by the 1960s that menthol is a
19	particularly important part of
20	African-American smoking behavior. And so
21	the industry begins to really identify
22	black smokers as a market for the
23	mentholated products, and you see
24	subsequently a sharp increase in the use of
25	mentholated cigarettes among smokers
0086
1	generally, including African-American
2	smokers.
3	So as part of the pitch to develop
4	the menthol market, African-American
5	smokers were part of that. They weren't
6	the only ones. There were pitches to other
7	populations, but African-American smokers
8	were part of that.
9	Q. So as it relates to menthol
10	cigarettes, you're not suggesting that
11	African-Americans were specifically
12	targeted as opposed to some other group,
13	right?
14	A. Well, there were specific
15	targeting efforts towards the
16	African-American smokers as part of the
17	effort to sell menthol. Yes.
18	Q. But it wasn't limited to
19	African-Americans, is that what you're
20	saying?
21	A. No. I mean, the industry also
22	marketed menthols to other demographic and
23	social groups within the American
24	population, within the consumer market.
25	Q. And what are those other groups
0087
1	that were marketed mentholated cigarettes?
2	A. Well, I think the best way to
3	think of it is that the industry maintained
4	a broad national marketing campaign for
5	mentholated products, which had its own
6	dynamic, for which they also developed
7	materials that were specifically directed
8	toward African-American consumers as well.
9	The two can operate side by side.
10	Q. Right. But what other groups
11	were, I guess in your words, targeted for
12	mentholated cigarettes?
13	A. Oh, sure. And these groups
14	overlap. Women, health-conscious smokers
15	were -- there's a health component to
16	public perceptions of menthol. Those would
17	be examples.
18	Q. If I understand you correctly,
19	then, as it relates to menthol advertising,
20	African-Americans were among the group of
21	consumers that may have been targeted; is
22	that what you're saying?
23	A. Yes. That's fair enough.
24	Q. African-Americans weren't singled
25	out for specific exclusive targeting as it
0088
1	relates to menthol cigarettes; is that
2	right?
3	A. Yeah. That's correct.
4	I mean, the industry was happy to
5	sell cigarettes to anybody. And it's clear
6	from the documents -- series of R.J.
7	Reynolds documents where they're trying to
8	kind of figure out success of the Kool
9	cigarette, and so they do a lot of
10	research, and they realize that what's
11	really pushing Kool ahead of Salem, for
12	example, is that Kool has a strong market
13	presence among black smokers, and,
14	therefore, that's pushing Kool ahead of the
15	Salem brand. So they begin to respond, try
16	to build up the African-American market for
17	Salem.
18	Q. And remind me, again, if we have
19	talked about this already. Do you know
20	what -- let's put it in percentage terms --
21	percent of cigarettes Mr. Calloway smoked
22	that were menthol?
23	A. I couldn't -- no, I don't. I
24	can't assign a number to it.
25	Q. Do you know anything at all about
0089
1	the prevalence of menthol cigarettes in his
2	lineup of cigarettes that he smoked?
3	A. There's not enough information in
4	the materials I reviewed and the fact
5	depositions to make that specific
6	evaluation. So I don't know.
7	Q. Do you know whether he was
8	anything other than an occasional smoker of
9	menthol cigarettes?
10	A. Again, I don't know.
11	Q. Is there anything in the materials
12	that suggest that he had a preference for
13	mentholated cigarettes?
14	A. I really didn't gather that. You
15	know, it's just a population of brands, a
16	set of brands that are discussed with not
17	much more detail than that.
18	Q. And in terms of cause and effect,
19	you haven't matched up menthol cigarette
20	advertising as a cause of any of Mr.
21	Calloway's behavior; is that correct?
22	A. His individual behavior?
23	Q. Yes.
24	A. No.
25	Q. I am correct?
0090
1	A. You are correct. Yes.
2	Q. Thank you.
3	A. I have not done that.
4	Q. There may have been too many
5	double negatives in there.
6	This first trend you talk about,
7	African-American as a growing market, that
8	would have been true for all -- let me back
9	up. Recognizing African-Americans as a
10	growing market would have been smart
11	marketing by any seller of consumer
12	products; is that fair to say?
13	A. Yes. I agree. And the tobacco
14	industry, they were especially smart at
15	marketing. So, yes, that's true.
16	Q. And did other manufacturers
17	recognize this growing trend of
18	African-Americans as consumers?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. What other industries kind of
21	recognized that and marketed toward
22	African-Americans?
23	A. Personal care products.
24	Q. How about other consumer goods?
25	A. Automobiles, alcoholic beverages,
0091
1	beer.
2	Q. Any other categories of consumer
3	manufacturers that you can think of that
4	recognized this growing trend of the
5	African-American consumer?
6	A. Well, you can --1 mean, you can
7	open up a -- any issue of Ebony or Jet from
8	-- just pick any date at random -- say the
9	early '60s would be a good time. You'll
10	find food products, convenience food
11	products, TV dinner type thing.
12	I mean, it's a significant fact
13	that African-Americans were becoming an
14	important -- recognized as an important
15	part of the American consuming public after
16	World War II.
17	Q. And when you say you can open up
18	Ebony and Jet, is it true that oftentimes
19	the ads for particular consumer products
20	would depict African-American models for
21	those particular products?
22	A. Yes. That's true.
23	Q. Okay. And you might look at a
24	more --1 don't know what the right term
25	would be -- a publication that was less
0092
1	focussed on the African-American, let's
2	say --1 don't know what that would be.
3	Can you think of an example?
4	A. You mean like a national
5	publication that saw itself as being not an
6	ethnic --
7	Q. Sure.
8	A. -- or niche market?
9	Q. Right.
10	A. Life magazine, for example.
11	Q. Okay. So is it fair to say that
12	you might see the same advertising in Life
13	magazine, but it might use Caucasian
14	models?
15	A. Yes. I mean, that was very --
16	very common with -- with cigarette
17	advertisements. Yeah.
18	They would use models that
19	reflected positive images of what -- of the
20	magazines demographics. So in Ebony, Jet,
21	you have African-American models, you know,
22	attractive folks. And Life magazine, not
23	so much, tended to be more white.
24	Q. And you mentioned cigarette
25	manufacturers doing that. It's true, isn't
0093
1	it, that a number of other consumer
2	manufacturers, personal care, automobiles,
3	alcohol, food products, they took a similar
4	approach in terms of their use of models
5	and demographics?
6	A. Yes. That's true. Yes.
7	Q. Do you have an opinion, Professor,
8	on whether African-Americans are more or
9	less susceptible to marketing compared to
10	other racial groups?
11	Let me back you up.
12	Is that an issue that you ever
13	studied? Have you ever looked to try to
14	determine whether African-Americans are
15	more susceptible to marketing campaigns
16	than any other ethnic or racial group?
17	A. No. I don't have -- I've not
18	looked at that. I don't have an opinion on
19	that. I mean, they're just another group
20	of people. I don't have an opinion on
21	that.
22	Q. Okay. Is it fair to say you're
23	not suggesting that there's anything
24	pernicious about targeting products to a
25	particular demographic, are you?
0094
1	In this case, if you're targeting
2	African-Americans, are you suggesting that
3	there's anything wrong with that, or is
4	that just kind of a run-of-the-mill good
5	market?
6	A. Well, that's an interesting
7	question. I mean, the industry was -- the
8	tobacco industry has been historically
9	especially good at marketing and
10	advertising. They've been innovators.
11	In many ways, the cigarette was
12	the product that opened up modem consumer
13	culture in the broad historical period.
14	The pemiciousness is in the
15	product, you know, which is deadly when
16	used as directed. The marketing itself was
17	just very, very good marketing.
18	I mean, I don't have an opinion on
19	its pemiciousness, except to the extent
20	that it was very effective in promoting and
21	maintaining smoking in the American
22	population generally and all of the
23	subpopulations, and to the degree that the
24	product is a dangerous product, that's the
25	problem.
0095
1	Q. But in temis of whether it was
2	more or less successful among the --
3	advertising that is -- among the
4	African-American population compared to the
5	rest of the population, have you looked at
6	that issue?
7	A. No, I haven't. I don't have an
8	opinion on that.
9	It's just, you know, there are
10	many subsets of the American population
11	that the industry begins to market towards
12	over time. African-Americans are one of
13	those subsets, women, working-class people,
14	later Hispanics, even later gay and
15	lesbians.
16	So you can follow the history of
17	their segmented marketing efforts over
18	time. They change over time. And
19	African-Americans are one of those
20	segments.
21	Q. And just as you said, they're one
22	of the segments. There's multiple segments
23	out there that various industries have
24	tried to advertise to, correct?
25	A. Yes.
0096
1	Q. You're not suggesting that there's
2	anything discriminatory, are you, about
3	marketing towards African-Americans?
4	MS. GOTTLIEB: Object to the form.
5	A. No. The black market segment was
6	a market segment that the industry in a way
7	discovered and began to market towards. I
8	mean --
9	MR. SEBOLD:
10	Q. In fact, in some ways -- you have
11	your opinion about the products, but in
12	some ways, it's a respect for the growing
13	economic force of African-Americans, isn't
14	it?
15	A. Well, my father used to say, "The
16	money is all the same color when it's in
17	the till of the cash register. Green."
18	I don't know that it's respect. I
19	wouldn't use that term. The industry is
20	trying to sell as many cigarettes as it can
21	and to promote smoking in every which way
22	that it can, and it recognizes
23	African-Americans as a population that is,
24	in essence, under-smoking compared to the
25	rest of the population, to develop more
0097
1	sophisticated marketing analysis tools in
2	the 1950s, and they identified
3	African-Americans as a -- as a target
4	market.
5	You know, when someone comes in
6	your neighborhood and puts up billboards
7	for Salems -- and there's been good
8	research on the prevalence of billboards in
9	African-Americans neighborhoods, so as to
10	promote the Salems.
11	I don't know if that's respect.
12	It's just trying to get as many
13	African-American teenagers hooked on
14	smoking as possible.
15	Q. Well, you said other consumer
16	products also in your opinion targeted the
17	African-American market, right? We talked
18	about that earlier.
19	A. That's correct.
20	Q. And, again, to kind of take it to
21	the granular level, you're not aware of any
22	evidence that Mr. Calloway himself was
23	influenced by any of the advertising that
24	you contend was targeted towards the
25	African-American market, correct?
0098
1	A. He as distinct from the
2	population, no. I'm not going to offer his
3	particular thought processes as part of my
4	expertise or as part of my opinion.
5	Q. Is it true that before the
6	cigarette advertising ban or even before
7	the cigarette advertising ban, magazines
8	like Ebony sought out tobacco companies as
9	advertisers?
10	A. Yes. That's true. I mean,
11	tobacco advertising was very lucrative.
12	The industry often paid for the full color
13	ads often on the back page or inside back
14	cover. They also worked with
15	African-American advertising agency to
16	reach out.
17	Q. So tobacco companies, in a sense,
18	actually helped magazines like Ebony to
19	flourish, right, by helping them fund their
20	operations through advertising?
21	A. Yes. That's true.
22	Q. And after the broadcast media ban,
23	there was actually a lot more advertising
24	in the print media; is that right?
25	A. That's correct.
0099
1	Q. And the African-American print
2	media like Ebony and Jet continued to
3	actively seek out advertisers including
4	tobacco companies?
5	A. That's right. Marketing
6	expenditures actually increased after the
7	end of television advertising, and most of
8	that went into direct market sponsorships
9	and magazines. When I say direct market, I
10	meant to say point-of-purchase marketing.
11	I misspoke.
12	Q. Is it your understanding that in
13	the Surgeon General's reports, that the
14	Surgeon General has concluded that there's
15	no evidence that menthol was developed to
16	have a special appeal to the
17	African-American population?
18	A. There is a lot of research going
19	on right now about menthol, and, in fact,
20	the most recent volume of the journal,
21	Tobacco Control, a supplement just released
22	this week is devoted to menthol.
23	I have not had time to review
24	those -- those articles, but I intend to
25	because this is current scholarship. A
0100
1	number of them are historical in their
2	nature, rely on history documents. Some
3	are more of a medical approach.
4	I don't know what you're referring
5	to in terms of the Surgeon General. I
6	mean, menthol has a history in the
7	cigarette market.
8	Q. You're familiar with the 1998
9	Surgeon General's report, correct?
10	A. Remind me of the title of that
11	one. I remember them by titles and not
12	years.
13	Q. I'm not sure I have the title
14	handy in front of me right now. Yes, I do.
15	"Tobacco Use Among U.S. Racial and Ethnic
16	and Minority Groups."
17	A. Yes. I've read that one.
18	Q. Is that one of the materials that
19	you rely on for your opinions?
20	A. I don't have it on my reliance
21	list, but I've looked at it.
22	Q. Do you have any reason to question
23	any of the findings in that particular
24	report?
25	A. Well, as I sit here --1 mean,
0101
1	it's a long report. I've reviewed it. The
2	only way to question the findings would be
3	to compare them, for example, to more
4	recent scholarship, newer findings that are
5	more reliable. I mean, our knowledge
6	advances. I haven't done that for that
7	particular document.
8	Q. If that report, the 1998 report
9	concluded that no evidence exists that the
10	menthol market was initially conceded as
11	having any special appeal to
12	African-Americans or other racial or ethnic
13	groups, do you have any reason to doubt
14	that conclusion?
15	A. Well, yes. I mean, there's been a
16	lot of research since 1998. Industry
17	documents were only becoming available in
18	1998.
19	Again, I'd have to review that
20	particular document to find out what the
21	basis of that particular finding is.
22	That conclusion, you know -- as
23	new evidence becomes available --1 mean,
24	the way you phrased that sentence, I'm not
25	exactly sure what you mean.
0102
1	I'll just say this, you know,
2	menthol was first put into cigarettes --
3	well, take like Spud, first mass-marketed
4	menthol cigarette as a -- really as a
5	kind of a health cigarette with a
6	quasi-medicinal approach, Kool in the mid
7	'30s similar.
8	I'm not aware any of explicitly
9	African-American bias towards the
10	conception of the product. Is that what
11	you're saying?
12	Q. Well, what I'm saying is in terms
13	of the initial concept for mentholated
14	cigarettes --
15	A. Well, I guess -- okay. I follow
16	you. All right.
17	Well, in terms of the initial
18	concept, which I just described, no. That
19	would be a -- there's nothing explicitly
20	African-American about that.
21	I mean, what the story is really
22	is that there is a discovery --
23	Q. Let me break that --
24	A. Okay.
25	Q. All right. So in terms of the
0103
1	initial concepts, you're not aware of any
2	evidence that the concept that the
3	mentholated cigarette was developed to be
4	targeted at the African-American
5	population; is that fair to say?
6	A. Right. In the 1920s and the early
7	1930s, with the two most important early
8	brands of mentholated cigarettes, Spud and
9	Kool.
10	Q. How about awareness of smoking and
11	health-related risks, have you studied that
12	as part of the material that you've
13	assembled?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. Isn't it fair to say that it's
16	been known for fairly a long time that
17	someone who starts to smoke can have a
18	difficult time quitting?
19	A. For much of the 20th century --
20	and I say 20th century since we're dealing
21	with the life of Mr. Calloway. The general
22	understanding among the public was that
23	smoking was a habit, that if one wanted to
24	stop, they could stop. Generally low
25	understanding amongst the general
0104
1	population of how difficult it really is to
2	stop smoking for people who have become
3	addicted to nicotine.
4	Q. And what's your basis for that
5	opinion?
6	A. The basis is multiple sources and
7	multiple types of sources. Let's take
8	survey data, simply asking people is it an
9	addiction or a habit. Two to one, it's a
10	habit.
11	Depictions of -- let me rephrase
12	that. Narrative description of what it
13	would entail to actually quit smoking, some
14	narrative descriptions, take "Nicotine
15	Knockout," describe it as something that's
16	difficult to quit, and same magazine,
17	Reader's Digest will run stories
18	particularly in the '50s where this is more
19	of a timely issue that said it's not
20	difficult to quit at all, it's just simply
21	a habit, like eating three square meals a
22	day.
23	So that's the general awareness.
24	Now, if you break it down as you must to
25	understand this accurately into subgroups
0105
1	of the population, there's even less
2	awareness, particularly among youth,
3	especially notable and established by lots
4	of research, simply don't understand the
5	addictive quality of cigarette smoking and,
6	for that matter, the cumulative risk of the
7	career of smoking on their health.
8	Generally lower income
9	individuals, lower social economic status
10	have lower knowledge of both the addictive
11	qualities and the negative health outcomes
12	of cigarette use.
13	Q. Where do you place Mr. Calloway in
14	the socioeconomic strata?
15	A. He's a working-class person, good,
16	solid, you know, steadily employed
17	working-class person.
18	Q. Does that make him in a lower
19	socioeconomic status?
20	A. It puts him in the working class,
21	which is not the bottom, not the top
22	either, somewhat in the middle, maybe in
23	the bottom portion of the middle.
24	Q. Well, you said that the awareness
25	of the risk of smoking might be lower in
0106
1	the lower socioeconomic status. Is Mr.
2	Calloway in your definition of the lower
3	socioeconomic status?
4	A. You know, it's -- over time,
5	particularly by the '60s and the '70s, you
6	know, the cigarette market shifts. It's
7	kind of a downscale/downshift as the
8	industry realizes that the future of their
9	market is with people who are less well
10	educated.
11	I mean, he doesn't have a college
12	degree. He works with his hands. He has a
13	manual occupation, cement finishing being
14	his profession. So he would be someone
15	relatively lower socioeconomic status from
16	the sociological point of view than say,
17	for example, a physician or a professional,
18	who I call a professional.
19	Q. His wife described him as an avid
20	reader of information, didn't she?
21	A. He read the papers. He read
22	magazines. Yes. He liked to read.
23	Q. Didn't she also describe him as
24	someone who could converse with anyone
25	considering -- given his sort of
0107
1	intelligence and curiosity?
2	A. This has nothing to do with it.
3	These are objective social class and income
4	designations. It has nothing to do with
5	one's own internal understanding of your
6	own intelligence.
7	What you make is not a function of
8	your intelligence. I think that's a pretty
9	-- a lot of it has to do with -- in fact,
10	most of it has to do with where you happen
11	to be born in life and the advantages that
12	you have.
13	I mean, someone like Mr. Calloway
14	had a very heavy burden to bear because he
15	faced a hard road of discrimination and
16	closed opportunities to him that were open
17	to no doubt lesser-qualified people who
18	happened to be born into more favored
19	circumstances, income and race.
20	Q. But in terms of Mr. Calloway's
21	awareness of the risks of smoking and his
22	intelligence level and all those types of
23	things, you haven't conducted any
24	particular analysis of those issues, have
25	you?
0108
1	A. Him as a person?
2	Q. Yes, sir.
3	A. No. Again, my answer is the same.
4	You know, I'm not his biographer.
5	Q. When you say lower socioeconomic
6	status, you're generalizing, correct?
7	A. Yes. I'm dealing with categories
8	of people and tendencies, which is how the
9	tobacco industry viewed the American
10	cigarette market. They saw categories of
11	people which they sought them to develop
12	effective marketing campaigns.
13	Q. In terms of where Mr. Calloway
14	fits, though, you're not necessarily
15	characterizing him as a lower socioeconomic
16	status, are you?
17	A. Well, he's someone who is a
18	working-class individual.
19	Q. Okay. But you just told me that
20	you can't generalize from there about
21	intelligence and awareness, right?
22	A. Right. Well, socioeconomic status
23	has nothing to do with intelligence.
24	Q. I couldn't agree more, but you
25	were the one I thought who said that lower
0109
1	socioeconomic status played a role in terms
2	of the awareness of risk.
3	Didn't you just say that a couple
4	minutes ago?
5	A. Yes, as a principle, but that has
6	nothing to do with intelligence.
7	Q. Or Mr. Calloway's own individual
8	awareness of the risks of smoking, correct?
9	A. Yeah. That gets back to the
10	earlier issue that we've been talking
11	about.
12	Q. You talk about the survey with
13	people noting addiction versus habit for
14	smoking. In your mind, what's the
15	difference between addiction and habit?
16	A. Well -
17	Q. And let me back you up.
18	What survey are you referring to?
19	A. I believe it's the 1982 R.J.
20	Reynolds Tobacco Institute survey. It's in
21	my reliance documents. I have also in my
22	polling demonstratives -- and I've used
23	this widely, you know -- taken the raw
24	table and made my own graph to illustrate
25	visually the numbers. So that's the
0110
1	source.
2	The habit -- and this is -- when
3	you say my conceptions, this is my reading
4	of how the term is used as in discourse
5	historically. Habit is portrayed as
6	something that is essentially a voluntary
7	activity that one can stop with willpower,
8	that the source of -- if it's a so-called
9	bad habit, the source of the bad habit is
10	not a physical dependency process, but
11	rather simply a lack of will on the part of
12	the person engaging in that habit, you
13	know, smoker or any other habit.
14	You've got good habits and bad
15	habits, and you should strive to have more
16	good habits than bad habits. Addiction, on
17	the other hand, refers to a physical
18	dependency process. That's pretty clear
19	that that's been part of the understanding
20	for quite some time.
21	Q. Have you done any research on the
22	numbers of smokers who have quit over time?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. What's your understanding about
25	that?
0111
1	A. Well, people do quit. Over time,
2	'60s and '70s, the rate of people that do
3	quit has increased somewhat. The principal
4	way of reducing the smoking rate, though,
5	is to prevent initiation of the addiction.
6	Q. But in terms of let's say a
7	percentage of former smokers, people who
8	smoked but quit, do you have any statistics
9	on that group?
10	A. I don't have those memorized. You
11	know, just the literature I've read on
12	quitting is that it takes multiple
13	attempts. There are high rates of
14	recidivism and that large portions of the
15	population despite many attempts to quit
16	are never successful in quitting. And then
17	when asked the vast preponderance, the vast
18	majority of adult long-term smokers wish
19	they weren't smokers and feel that they
20	can't quit.
21	Q. To return to what I think was my
22	original question, do you have any
23	statistics at hand on the number of smokers
24	who have quit?
25	A. Not at my fingertips. That data
0112
1	is collected and available.
2	Q. Do you have any working knowledge,
3	thumbnail sketch of what percentage of
4	smokers have quit over time?
5	A. I don't have those numbers
6	memorized. No.
7	Q. In 1964 when the Surgeon General's
8	report came out, do you have an
9	understanding of the degree of awareness of
10	the risk of smoking at that point in time?
11	A. At the point the report was
12	released? Well, on the eve of the report,
13	based on the survey data that I've looked
14	at, Roper polls, the majority of smokers
15	had not yet agreed to the principle -- and
16	this is a fairly low standard -- that
17	cigarettes were one of the causes of lung
18	cancer, for example.
19	So, you know, on the eve of the
20	report's release, you don't even have a
21	majority of smokers really understanding
22	that this product causes this particular
23	disease, not to mention all the other
24	diseases that it causes.
25	Q. How about after the 1964 report
0113
1	came out, did the majority of the
2	population then understand that cigarette
3	smoking could be associated with lung
4	cancer?
5	A. After the report comes out,
6	subsequent polls, you do begin to poll a
7	majority of smokers in this case agreeing
8	to the proposition that cigarettes are one
9	of the causes of lung cancer.
10	But, you know, subsequent analyses
11	by government groups like the Department of
12	Health, Education and Welfare show that
13	there are -- persisted well into the late
14	'70s and very early '80s significant gaps
15	in knowledge among the general public and
16	the smoking public in particular.
17	Q. And just so I'm clear, you haven't
18	done anything to test or analyze Mr.
19	Calloway's specific understanding of the
20	risks of smoking, correct?
21	A. That's correct. For example,
22	everything I've referred to in this
23	previous question is based on survey data
24	of statistically representative
25	populations, of the United States
0114
1	population -- statistically representative
2	samples of the United States population.
3	Pardon me. I misspoke.
4	Q. But in terms of surveying Mr.
5	Calloway, you weren't able to do that,
6	right?
7	A. No. He's been dead for 19 years.
8	Q. And these polls that you talked
9	about, have you tracked those over time in
10	terms of measuring awareness of the risks
11	of smoking?
12	A. For those where you have a time
13	series, yes.
14	Q. And which of those do you have a
15	time series for?
16	A. Well, the standard question I just
17	referred to a few minutes ago, do you think
18	cigarettes are one of the causes of lung
19	cancer, that really is the one question
20	that has been asked consistently in this
21	case by the Gallup Poll organization from
22	the early 1950s into the 1990s.
23	Q. And how is that awareness tracked?
24	A. How have they done that?
25	Q. No. No. No. Bad question or
0115
1	ambiguous question.
2	What does that polling show in
3	terms of the public's awareness of a link
4	between lung cancer and smoking?
5	A. Oh. Sure. I see what you're
6	saying.
7	Well, let me break it down decade
8	by decade, since it is such a long period
9	of time.
10	In the 1950s, interestingly
11	enough, it shows that particularly among
12	smokers, but also the general population,
13	that the portion of the -- of the sample
14	responding in the affirmative that
15	cigarettes are one of the causes of lung
16	cancer actually declines over the course of
17	the 1950s. So you actually have a
18	deteriorating or eroding understanding of
19	that.
20	It picks up again in the 1960s.
21	You reach majorities of smokers in 1964,
22	around 54 percent or so. I'd have to
23	double-check the exact number. By the
24	1970s, it's approximately 70 percent of the
25	general population expressing affirmative
0116
1	that cigarettes are one of the causes of
2	lung cancer. There's always a lower figure
3	for smokers. Late '70s, early '80s, the
4	numbers go upward from there.
5	Q. Fair to say there's been a growing
6	public awareness over time of an
7	association between smoking and cancer?
8	A. Well, at some points, it's
9	declined and some points it's increased.
10	Q. Fair enough.
11	From the Surgeon General's report
12	in 1964 forward, the trend is a growing
13	public awareness of the risks of cigarette
14	smoking, correct?
15	A. Well, the trend is upward in that
16	particular polling instrument. In terms of
17	-- that's not the only measure of awareness
18	of the risks of smoking because smoking has
19	so many risks to health, and lung cancer is
20	the one that people focus on because it's
21	the one that gathered the press attention,
22	but it's certainly not even the most
23	important in terms of the number of deaths.
24	Many times, more people are killed
25	by heart disease induced by -- or
0117
1	aggravated and induced by cigarettes than
2	lung cancer.
3	Q. Have you tracked the awareness of
4	heart disease linked to cigarette smoking?
5	A. Yes. There's some data on that,
6	not as -- again, the polling data is not as
7	extensive at least in the early periods
8	that I'm talking about, '50s and '60s.
9	Q. How about from the Surgeon
10	General's report forward, isn't there also
11	reflected in the polling a growing
12	awareness of a linkage between heart
13	disease and smoking?
14	A. Yes. Less -- it lags behind that
15	of lung cancer, but the trend is upward.
16	Yes.
17	Q. And, again, you don't know
18	anything about Mr. Calloway's specific
19	awareness of the linkage between heart
20	disease and smoking, correct?
21	A. No. I don't know his personal
22	knowledge.
23	Q. What about his family members,
24	like his brother that he was close to, do
25	you know what his knowledge was of the
0118
1	awareness of risks of smoking?
2	A. Not really, no.
3	Q. And did you attempt to look and
4	analyze the influence of any of his family
5	members' awareness of smoking on Mr.
6	Calloway?
7	A. No.
8	Q. The 1964 Surgeon General's report,
9	when that came out, fair to say that that
10	was generally front-page news?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. And you're obviously aware that
13	cigarettes contain warning labels since
14	approximately 1966; is that right?
15	A. Well, 1966 to 1970, you had a
16	caution label that a warning -- single
17	warning label basically to 1984. Since
18	'84, '85 --1 forget exactly when they went
19	on -- had the rotating labels that are
20	still on packs today.
21	Q. The majority of time that Mr.
22	Calloway smoked, there was some type of
23	warning or caution on the cigarette packs
24	about the risks of smoking, right?
25	A. Warning or caution, yes.
0119
1	Q. Did you analyze Mr. Calloway's
2	brother's awareness of messages from the
3	public health community about the health
4	risks of smoking?
5	A. No.
6	Q. You didn't see any indication in
7	the materials that you reviewed, did you,
8	that Mr. Calloway chose his brand of
9	cigarette because of any particular
10	advertising he saw, did you?
11	A. Not for any particular ad, no.
12	MS. GOTTLIEB: I'm sorry. The
13	connection just got bad. Can you just
14	repeat that last question?
15	MR. SEBOLD: Can you read that
16	back?
17	(Whereupon, the question was read
18	by the reporter.)
19	MS. GOTTLIEB: Objection, asked
20	and answered.
21	A. And my response is, no, not for a
22	particular advertisement, consistent with
23	my prior answers in this deposition.
24	MR. SEBOLD:
25	Q. You didn't see any indication in
0120
1	the materials that you reviewed that Mr.
2	Calloway declined to quit smoking because
3	of any cigarette advertising he read or
4	saw, did you?
5	A. No.
6	Q. And as far as you know, in the
7	case-specific materials, there's no
8	statement where a witness said that Mr.
9	Calloway smoked because of this ad he saw
10	or this statement that he heard, is there?
11	A. A particular statement, no. My
12	answer is --1 elaborated on that earlier
13	in my deposition, and my answer is the
14	same.
15	Q. You talk about reviewing company
16	documents. There isn't any indication in
17	those documents that you saw that any
18	statement from the tobacco company was made
19	in bad faith, is there?
20	A. What do you mean by bad faith?
21	Q. Well, what's your understanding of
22	the term?
23	A. Well, I would consider a lie to be
24	a bad faith statement. I think the way in
25	which -- over the long period of time in
0121
1	which the industry sustained a campaign of
2	disinformation to persuade the smoking
3	public that the science was unproven, that
4	the case against cigarettes was an open
5	debate, for example, my perspective is that
6	that was done explicitly to sell more
7	cigarettes and solely to sell more
8	cigarettes, the public's health be damned.
9	And so that would qualify as bad
10	faith in my mind.
11	Q. In terms of evaluating science of
12	a link between smoking and cancer, you're
13	not suggesting that you have the expertise
14	to make that evaluation, are you?
15	A. No. I don't do independent
16	evaluation say, for example, state of the
17	art. I just rely on the industry's own
18	statements that they make internally, which
19	are in variance with what they said
20	publically.
21	When the number two man at Philip
22	Morris, George Weissman, says, well,
23	there's nothing good for us in the Surgeon
24	General's report, but we must continue to
25	give smokers a psychological reason to
0122
1	smoke, internally tells the public if we
2	think these are bad or we get information
3	these are bad, we'll stop making them,
4	public statements in the media, the press,
5	that qualifies.
6	Q. Well, that actually wasn't my
7	question, I don't think.
8	My question was, in terms of your
9	expertise, you're not suggesting that you
10	have scientific expertise to evaluate a
11	link between cigarette smoking and cancer,
12	are you?
13	A. That's right. I've never given
14	testimony in that area.
15	Q. You mentioned a statement from
16	Philip Morris that you consider to be I
17	guess bad faith. Are you aware of any
18	statements from anyone at Reynolds where
19	they said something that -- to the public
20	that was contrary to their personal
21	beliefs?
22	A. Gosh, in the 1990s, the head of
23	Reynolds said if he thought cigarettes were
24	bad, they would stop making them too. I
25	forget the name of the company. It was in
0123
1	the mid 1990s.
2	Look, you can take all of the
3	advertising to essentially be in bad faith.
4	I've never seen a cigarette advertisement
5	that depicts the product the way it
6	actually functions when used by the public.
7	Q. From what time period forward was
8	every cigarette ad accompanied by the
9	warning label?
10	A. Well, again, from 1966 to 1970,
11	it's the caution label. Then the Surgeon
12	General's warning succeeds that on the
13	pack. Then the mid '80s, the current
14	rotation.
15	But that was put on there by
16	legislation. That was not a Reynolds
17	statement. You asked me about statements
18	by Reynolds. Reynolds is telling you that
19	Salems are fresh. Reynolds is telling the
20	public in 1950, "What cigarette do you
21	smoke, Doctor?" They're telling you about
22	the "T-Zone" and how the cigarettes are
23	mild and not irritating.
24	Where do you want to begin? I
25	mean, how much time do you have?
0124
1	Q. I just want to be clear of when in
2	these ads that it came that the caution or
3	warning labelling was included. What's
4	your understanding in that regard?
5	A. Well, I just gave you the date.
6	This will be the third time I said that.
7	Q. That's fine. You don't have to
8	repeat it, then. I just want to make sure
9	I'm understanding.
10	In these surveys that you talked
11	about reviewing, isn't it true that a very
12	low percentage of the people identified the
13	tobacco industry as their source of
14	information?
15	A. What survey are you talking about?
16	Q. Well, are you aware of any surveys
17	where people indicated that information
18	about -- their predominant source of
19	information about smoking came from the
20	tobacco industry?
21	A. I'm not aware of a survey that
22	asks that question.
23	Q. I think you talked about The
24	Tobacco Institute at some point in time.
25	Are you aware of polling data from the '50s
0125
1	through the '80s that indicated -- excuse
2	me. Let me start over.
3	You talked about The Tobacco
4	Institute earlier. Are you aware of
5	polling data from the '50s through the
6	1980s that indicate that The Tobacco
7	Institute was not viewed as a reliable
8	source of information?
9	A. There is some polling data that
10	assesses the relative credibility of
11	sources -- categories of sources, and The
12	Tobacco Institute tends to come out low on
13	that. That's true.
14	That's different than your
15	previous question.
16	Q. Well, whether it is or not, we'll
17	have the nice record, and we'll have your
18	answers.
19	In terms of information that you
20	alluded to earlier that wasn't disclosed to
21	the public, you don't have any way of
22	knowing whether Mr. Calloway himself would
23	have changed his smoking behavior if any of
24	this alleged information had been revealed
25	to him, do you?
0126
1	A. He as an individual? Again, I
2	can't say. I have opinions about the
3	course of the history of American smoking
4	prevalence and how that would have changed.
5	Q. But in terms of Mr. Calloway
6	himself, you can't say that if he had
7	received any of this information that you
8	purport was hidden, that would have changed
9	his actual conduct, correct?
10	A. We can't know because he's dead
11	from a smoking-related disease. So we
12	can't know that.
13	Q. Well, it's true, isn't it, that
14	even after a lot of this information that
15	you talk about has come to light, people
16	continue to smoke, right?
17	A. Yes. The product is still
18	marketed, although far fewer people
19	continue to smoke.
20	I think one of the outcomes of the
21	revelation of the industry knowledge about
22	the risks of smoking, which emerged from
23	the documents that we first got access to
24	in the 1990s, has been to help
25	significantly tobacco control efforts,
0127
1	tobacco education efforts.
2	Q. You've expressed some fairly
3	strong views today. I guess I can use that
4	term. Is it your belief that all
5	plaintiffs in tobacco lawsuits should win
6	their lawsuits?
7	MS. GOTTLIEB: Objection to the
8	form.
9	A. I'm not qualified to offer an
10	opinion on that.
11	I'll honestly say that I have
12	never seen a human activity as complicated
13	as a lawsuit. And there are so many
14	aspects upon which the legal aspect of
15	outcome hinges upon. I mean, I'm really in
16	no position to say.
17	MR. SEBOLD:
18	Q. How about Mrs. Calloway, is it
19	your belief that she should win her
20	lawsuit?
21	MS. GOTTLIEB: Objection,
22	relevance.
23	A. That's not --1 have no opinion on
24	that. That's not my role in this. That's
25	the jury's role. They'll make up their
0128
1	mind.
2	MR. SEBOLD:
3	Q. Do you think the tobacco company
4	should be punished for selling their
5	products?
6	MS. GOTTLIEB: Objection,
7	relevance.
8	A. Well, that's a different -- you're
9	using the term "punished" -- you're a
10	careful person, so you deliberately chose
11	not to use the term "punitive damages,"
12	which I see as a legal concept.
13	In my last deposition, I explained
14	this at great length. So first of all,
15	we're going over something that I believe
16	Mr. Hank asked me, your colleague
17	(indicating).
18	MR. SEBOLD:
19	Q. Give me the short version, if you
20	can.
21	MR. BRENNER: I'm sure you gave
22	Pete the long version, if it was Pete
23	asking questions.
24	THE WITNESS: I did. He gives
25	long versions back. That's something we
0129
1	agree on perhaps.
2	A. The short version is the products
3	manufactured by your client and the other
4	clients represented by the other attorneys
5	in this room have caused demonstrable
6	grievous harm upon the health of the
7	American population.
8	This was done by these companies
9	without regard for the health and the
10	effects of the product, that is simply
11	interested in selling the product. I mean,
12	to the -- you know, in a moral sense, I
13	think there is some punishment.
14	What I said last time, if somebody
15	comes into my house and steals my
16	television and then simply returns my TV to
17	me, I mean, there's no -- usually they go
18	to jail. The justice system implements a
19	punishment or they pay a fine or what have
20	you or they do community service,
21	something.
22	So to the extent that the products
23	of this -- of your clients collectively
24	have caused grievous harm -- they account
25	for one-fifth of U.S. mortality from
0130
1	cigarette-related diseases. Some
2	punishment -- some remediation --1 mean,
3	really I don't like the word "punishment"
4	-- remediation is involved. What that
5	should be, I don't know because I'm not
6	really qualified, but some remediation is
7	probably -- not probably -- some
8	remediation is needed.
9	And in that regard, we're going
10	back to what Luther Terry called for in the
11	1964 Surgeon General's report, that this is
12	a problem of health that needs remediation,
13	and we haven't yet reached that point.
14	That's the best I can do. I'm not
15	a lawyer. I don't have an opinion on the
16	outcome of this particular lawsuit.
17	MR. SEBOLD:
18	Q. But you believe the tobacco
19	company should provide this remediation; is
20	that correct?
21	MS. GOTTLIEB: Objection,
22	relevance.
23	A. Well, they've been the primary
24	beneficiaries, so they should -- they
25	should be part of that solution. Yes.
0131
1	MR. SEBOLD:
2	Q. And is your view that one of those
3	solutions is lawsuits like this one?
4	MS. GOTTLIEB: Objection,
5	relevance.
6	A. I think this is a very inefficient
7	and expensive and I might add not very fair
8	way to solve the problem of tobacco in
9	America. So I -- you know, I mean, it's --
10	I can think of much better ways to do it
11	than this slow and expensive and kind of
12	hit-or-miss process where individuals have
13	to go and file suit.
14	MR. SEBOLD:
15	Q. And why do you say that this
16	process is not very fair?
17	A. Well, it's just expensive. It
18	takes lots of people, you know, a -- it's
19	inefficient. I mean, if -- if -- the goal
20	--in my mind, the goal is to reduce and
21	eliminate tobacco-induced disease in the
22	American -- we'll just stick with the
23	American population.
24	I think -- and, again, I'm just
25	speaking here as an individual, not as a
0132
1	historian because it's not an item of
2	historical research, but there are most
3	certainly more effective ways to reduce the
4	harms of smoking in the future. You know,
5	lawsuits are slow, expensive. The outcomes
6	are uncertain.
7	Lots of people have been injured
8	by cigarettes. Whether they should get
9	compensation for that, I don't know. It
10	takes a long time. That's part of the
11	unfairness, drags out. Lawsuits are--
12	they're tough. I mean, that's --1 mean, I
13	know that's what you do for a living, but
14	they're almost bizarre to me.
15	Q. You say the outcomes are
16	uncertain, some plaintiffs win, some
17	plaintiffs lose. Is it your belief there
18	should be more certainty so that every
19	plaintiff wins?
20	A. No, not that every plaintiff wins.
21	I think—
22	Q. What's the uncertainty, then, that
23	you're alluding to?
24	A. Well, some plaintiffs win. Some
25	plaintiffs lose. Sometimes it's on the
0133
1	merits of the case. Sometimes it's on the
2	merits -- I've not done a study of this.
3	Sometimes it's on the merits of the quality
4	of the representation, a whole host of
5	things. There are a whole host of
6	variables that seem unrelated to the harm
7	that cigarettes have caused on a lot of
8	people.
9	So, you know, it's -- you know,
10	some get more, some get less. And I've not
11	made a study of this, you know, and I don't
12	follow this aspect of it, but it -- just as
13	a layperson, it --1 can think of better
14	ways to solve the issue as I define it.
15	Q. Do you see yourself as an advocate
16	for the public health?
17	A. I would see myself for an advocate
18	of the truth, and to the extent that the
19	truth does help public health, perhaps. I
20	mean, I'm not a public health practitioner.
21	My job is not improving, you know, people's
22	health. So in that regard, I don't
23	advocate for the public health. I do
24	believe in health. I like health over
25	sickness. I have a bias towards that.
0134
1	But, you know, principally I see myself as
2	someone who is telling the truth about this
3	particular aspect of history.
4	Q. Back to your example of the
5	television set, I receive an understanding
6	that it has been and currently is legal to
7	sell cigarettes in the United States,
8	right?
9	A. That's true. It is legal.
10	Q. In terms of the subpoena and the
11	documents that you brought, what materials
12	have you brought in response to the
13	subpoena?
14	A. Oh. Sure. You wanted the
15	documents I received from --
16	Q. Correct.
17	A. I've got three versions of the
18	notice of the deposition.
19	Q. You can hang on to those.
20	A. Yeah. There were new names. I
21	didn't realize it was going to be Jones
22	Day. There were new names on the lawyer
23	list. I've given everything -- well, y'all
24	periodically get all my stuff, but I
25	haven't given this in a year. I thought if
0135
1	it was new -- but you guys already have
2	that --
3	MR. BRENNER: Can we stop one
4	second and identify what that is, or at
5	least pass it around?
6	THE WITNESS: Let me describe it.
7	MR. SEBOLD: Why don't we just
8	mark it.
9	THE WITNESS: Just mark it.
10	MR. SEBOLD: This is a version for
11	us?
12	THE WITNESS: Yes.
13	(Off the record.)
14	(Exhibit Number 5 was marked.)
15	MR. SEBOLD:
16	Q. Doctor, in response to the
17	subpoena, one of the things you brought was
18	what we've marked as Exhibit Number 5,
19	which has a title The Cigarette Epidemic in
20	the American South and Global Tobacco
21	Control in the 21st Century.
22	Can you describe for us what that
23	is and how you view that as responsive to
24	the subpoena?
25	A. Yes. First of all, I'll say what
0136
1	it is. It is a PowerPoint presentation
2	that I gave at the University of North
3	Carolina. It's on my CV. It was either
4	January, early February of either '07 or
5	'08.
6	To be honest with you, I can't
7	exactly remember, but it's responsive to
8	Number 11 on the Schedule A. And I gave
9	all this -- have given all this before, and
10	I just printed it out again because there
11	seemed to be new people that I was -- new
12	law firms I was unfamiliar with and under
13	the idea that, well, maybe y'all don't have
14	this stuff.
15	I --1 gave this -- not only have
16	I given this to Jones Day attorneys, but I
17	gave it particularly to Mr. Koethe, Paul,
18	in one of the earlier Engle Progeny
19	depositions. So it's a document you have,
20	but now you have another copy.
21	Q. And what is it intended to show or
22	reflect?
23	A. It's an overview of the history of
24	the cigarette, with a particular emphasis
25	on the role of smoking in the American
0137
1	South was the center for the study of the
2	American South. It takes -- it asks the
3	question, you know, what can we learn from
4	the history of cigarette smoking in the
5	South, which is a distinctive region in
6	American history, and how does that inform
7	some of the more broader issues related to
8	tobacco control, particularly in the Third
9	World or developing world.
10	Q. And do you believe there's a
11	different attitude and approach to smoking
12	in the American South compared to the rest
13	of the United States?
14	A. This are some differences. Yes.
15	Q. Can you briefly outline those
16	things?
17	A. Sure. At least certain parts of
18	the South, of the Southeast are
19	tobacco-growing areas, and so you had a
20	political nexus to support the tobacco
21	industry in states like North Carolina, for
22	example.
23	The South also was a poorer
24	region, less modernized, if you will. It
25	undergoes a kind of modernization process.
0138
1	That's a broad generalization, but it
2	undergoes that process later than the rest
3	of the country. For example,
4	industrialization, urbanization, those
5	happened in the South after they happened
6	say, for example, in the Northeast or in
7	the Midwest.
8	Tobacco smoking patterns developed
9	a little bit later in the South,
10	cigarette-smoking patterns, and then -- so
11	that's the basic approach, and that has
12	some relevance to the developing world
13	which now is undergoing a modernization
14	process.
15	Q. Any other materials that you
16	brought in response to the subpoena?
17	A. Yeah. You guys had asked for --1
18	burnt some CDs, a couple of DVDs of
19	material. This is -- you've already got
20	this stuff. This is duplicative. I was
21	just reading, you know, when I went through
22	the list. You asked for these things, so I
23	burnt a couple of DVDs.
24	Q. These DVDs, what are they, and how
25	are they responsive to the subpoena?
0139
1	A. I think you asked for all
2	publications, literature, deposition
3	transcripts and/or data you relied upon to
4	form your opinions related to this case.
5	That would be Number 6. I burnt what was
6	on my hard drive.
7	Q. And are those different than the
8	reliance materials that we've seen depicted
9	in Exhibit, whatever, 1 through 4?
10	A. No. They're organized a little
11	bit differently, but the materials are the
12	same. These are duplicative.
13	I didn't realize the extent to
14	which they had already supplied you with
15	this. Otherwise, I wouldn't have brought
16	that.
17	Q. So you think these CDs that you
18	just talked about are duplicative of the
19	materials that have been identified in
20	Exhibit 1 through 4 as reliance materials?
21	A. Yes. There are going to be some
22	exceptions because I'm a little behind on
23	some of my -- there's a little less
24	material on this relating to -- the
25	exhibits that I used in the Alexander case,
0140
1	for example, are reflected in this, my
2	materials. I haven't downloaded all those
3	from my own digital copies yet. I'm a
4	little behind.
5	Q. Okay.
6	A. There's a few things -- the ads
7	are not as organized on this as they are by
8	brand.
9	Q. The CDs that you brought, there's
10	copies for us?
11	A. Yeah. You can have them.
12	Q. Okay. Well, maybe we'll mark them
13	next in line.
14	Is there a difference between one
15	CD and the other?
16	A. Yes. This is part one and part
17	two. This one has video. Part two is my
18	video exhibits. Part one are my documents.
19	MR. SEBOLD: Why don't we go ahead
20	and mark that as Number 6.
21	(Exhibit Numbers 6a and 6b were marked.)
22	MR. SEBOLD:
23	Q. So 6a and 6b will be some of your
24	reliance materials that you've just
25	described, which may very well duplicate
0141
1	what we've already seen in these lists,
2	correct?
3	A. Yes. For example, Document Number
4	1, Exhibit Number 1, which is my list for
5	which I don't always have a copy of all
6	those, and that's a bit larger. So not
7	every document listed on Exhibit Number 1
8	is -- do I have a copy of. Many of these
9	were originally on paper.
10	Q. Any other documents or materials
11	that you brought in response to the
12	subpoena?
13	A. You generally ask for any
14	communications between me and the attorneys
15	of the Schlesinger law firm. I -- let me
16	get those communications, cover letter that
17	came with the paper copy of the notice of
18	the deposition.
19	Q. This group of materials that you
20	have here, those are communications with
21	the Schlesinger law firm?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. Why don't we just mark all
24	those --
25	A. And e-mails. I can represent the
0142
1	e-mails are basically giving dates, but one
2	of them had the Hattiesburg American
3	materials, supplemental. That's the e-mail
4	that I used to send it.
5	(Exhibit Number 7 was marked.)
6	MR. SEBOLD:
7	Q. Any other materials in response to
8	this?
9	A. Yeah. You asked for my CV.
10	MR. SEBOLD: Okay. We'll make
11	that Exhibit Number 8.
12	(Exhibit Number 8 was marked.)
13	MR. SEBOLD:
14	Q. All right. So we marked as
15	Exhibit Number 8 your CV; is that correct?
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. All right. What else did you
18	bring in response to the subpoena?
19	A. Well, I've got a document --
20	earlier this week I noticed as I was
21	reviewing -- part of my deposition review,
22	I noticed there was a couple of depositions
23	that referenced coupons. It has magazine
24	inserts. In fact, one of the attorneys
25	doing the deposition explicitly asked Mr.
0143
1	Calloway's widow about that. She was
2	affirmative.
3	So I identified just from the
4	industry Web site, the document Web site an
5	example of a coupon that appeared in Ebony
6	magazine.
7	MR. SEBOLD: I'll mark that as
8	Exhibit Number 9.
9	(Exhibit Number 9 was marked.)
10	MR. SEBOLD:
11	Q. Anything else that you brought in
12	response to the subpoena?
13	A. I received the depositions for
14	this case in paper form, and I brought them
15	with me.
16	Q. All right. We might catalog those
17	later.
18	Have you -- do you know which --
19	everything in the back, have you read it,
20	or are there specific ones you read?
21	A. I can tell you right now. I read
22	the fact depositions from family members.
23	I was sent -- and probably just because I
24	just got what they had on the shelf -- some
25	depositions with medical treaters.
0144
I	Once I realized that those were --
2	like, for example, a document custodian, I
3	did not see those as relevant to my
4	opinions. They included an expert witness
5	official, Dr. Cook, who's been deposed
6	before, an official with RJ. Reynolds,
7	head of research. I skimmed through that,
8	but it didn't seem to be relevant for my
9	opinions in this case. I've read other
10	testimony by him. And then they included a
II	large amount of medical records, which I
12	did not review.
13	Q. So you haven't reviewed any
14	medical records in this case?
15	A. No.
16	Q. Anything else in response to your
17	subpoena that you brought that we haven't
18	talked about?
19	A. That's it.
20	Q. Any other documents that you
21	relied on in forming your opinions that we
22	haven't identified so far?
23	A. I think we've covered it.
24	Q. When were you first contacted by
25	plaintiffs counsel about the Calloway
0145
1	case?
2	A. I got an e-mail asking for
3	deposition dates, and I believe that e-mail
4	came back in October, and I supplied some
5	dates, but then didn't do anything relating
6	to this case until I received these
7	documents. They came a few weeks ago.
8	Q. These documents being the
9	deposition transcripts?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. So between October of 2010 and a
12	few weeks ago, you didn't do any work on
13	the Calloway case?
14	A. That's right. I mean, I supplied
15	-- aside from supplying dates, it was just
16	a -- you know, one of a series of cases
17	that I was retained to handle for the
18	Schlesinger law firm.
19	Q. When you say one of a series of
20	cases, how many cases have you been
21	retained to work on by the Schlesinger
22	firm?
23	A. Well, I've been deposed, although
24	I have not testified at trial, on the
25	Hatziyannakis case, Katz and Tullo cases.
0146
1	Those were the earlier -- those were the
2	ones that I put some time in to preparing
3	for a deposition, but for reasons I don't
4	know, I have not testified at trial.
5	Q. To date, how much have you been
6	paid by the Schlesinger firm for your work?
7	A. In this --
8	Q. No. All cases so far.
9	A. For this set of cases?
10	Q. Uh-huh (affirmative).
11	A. Nothing.
12	Q. You haven't received any payment
13	from the Schlesinger firm so far?
14	A. No. For the Hatziyannakis case, I
15	did submit a bill for $2,000, which was for
16	preparing for the deposition and supplying
17	a short affidavit. I sent that off about
18	--maybe two or three weeks ago. I expect
19	to receive that.
20	Q. Have you received any payment to
21	date for any work that you've done for the
22	Schlesinger firm?
23	A. You mean ever?
24	Q. Yes.
25	A. Yeah. I testified in '09 in a
0147
1	case called Barbanell. I was paid for that
2	case.
3	Q. When you say the set of cases,
4	that's the series that you just identified?
5	A. Well, it might be easier if you
6	review this Exhibit Number 7. You can see
7	there's an e-mail asking for dates for
8	those cases.
9	Q. Okay. How much have you billed so
10	far in this case?
11	A. Nothing. I have not put together
12	a bill for this case.
13	Q. And your first contact was back in
14	October of 2010 you said?
15	A. Right. Just asking for dates from
16	a paralegal or secretary from the firm.
17	Q. Did you review any expert
18	disclosures for this case? I should say
19	your own. Did you review your own expert
20	disclosure?
21	A. I don't think so, no. They have a
22	standard expert disclosure, which I wrote
23	some time ago. I'm assuming we're using
24	that same disclosure.
25	Q. And your understanding is that
0148
1	just gets repeated case after case?
2	A. Yes. That's my understanding.
3	Q. So you didn't individualize your
4	disclosure for this particular case?
5	A. No, I did not.
6	Q. When the original disclosure was
7	prepared, did you review it?
8	A. Not for this case, no.
9	Q. But in terms of the original one
10	that you talked about, the one that's been
11	used repeatedly, did you do that?
12	A. No. I -- it's been a number of
13	years. I wrote that one myself some time
14	ago. Maybe '08. It was in 2008.
15	MR. SEBOLD: Let's just take a
16	very quick look at the disclosure.
17	(Exhibit Number 10 was marked.)
18	MR. SEBOLD:
19	Q. Doctor, Exhibit 10 is labeled
20	Plaintiffs Amended Notice of Filing Expert
21	Witness List, and I'm more than willing to
22	look at the whole thing, but just to save
23	time, on page 17 there's a disclosure
24	listed for you, 17 and 18.
25	A. Uh-huh (affirmative).
0149
1	Q. Did you play any role in preparing
2	that disclosure?
3	A. I did.
4	Q. Is that what you were talking
5	about when you prepared sort of a general
6	description several years ago?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. But you haven't tailored it to
9	this particular case; is that right?
10	A. No. This seems to be pretty much
11	in the same language.
12	My recollection is that I
13	originally prepared this disclosure for
14	what ultimately became a preservation
15	deposition that was taken either in January
16	or February of '09, but that had been in --
17	you know, I had been contacted about
18	earlier. This was a videotaped
19	preservation deposition. I guess the idea
20	was to show the videotape.
21	Q. Have you interviewed Mrs. Calloway
22	or spoken to her?
23	A. No.
24	Q. Have you interviewed any of the
25	family members?
0150
1	A. No.
2	Q. Other than the Hattiesburg
3	newspaper search that you did, have you
4	done any literature searches specific to
5	this case?
6	A. No. Just the Hattiesburg
7	newspapers.
8	Q. And I probably -- I'm sure I asked
9	you this before, but you didn't do a
10	Sentinel search, did you?
11	A. No. We talked about that earlier,
12	and that's --1 described that earlier.
13	Q. Is there anything in the
14	deposition transcripts that you relied on
15	in forming any of your opinions in this
16	case?
17	A. Well, I mean, the depositions
18	provide, you know, objective -- you know,
19	the objective conditions, the basis of Mr.
20	Calloway's life, where he was bom, where
21	he was raised, where he lived. So to the
22	extent that that infomiation is in the
23	depositions, I relied on that.
24	We pretty much talked about all of
25	that over the course of today. We
0151
1	commented about coupons. There's a
2	reference to light cigarettes, you know,
3	the brands that he smoked, those kinds of
4	materials.
5	MR. SEBOLD: Okay. Why don't we
6	go off the record for a minute.

16	EXAMINATION
17	BY MR. PEDROSA:
18	Q. Good afternoon, Professor. Once
19	again, I'll introduce myself. My name is
20	Eliot Pedrosa. I represent Lorillard
21	Tobacco Company in this case.
22	Now, I've never taken your
23	deposition before, but I know you've given
24	many depositions and you've answered many
25	questions from my colleagues on behalf of
0152
1	Lorillard, so I'm going to try not to
2	repeat ground that they've already covered,
3	except to ask you whether there's been any
4	change in any of your opinions or any of
5	the bases for your opinions.
6	So, hopefully, we'll be able to
7	get through quickly. And I'll have a few
8	follow-up questions with respect to the
9	questions Mr. Sebold asked you, so I might
10	jump around a little bit.
11	If at any point in time you don't
12	understand my question or it seems like it
13	doesn't make any sense, please let me know,
14	and I'll do my best to rephrase it, to make
15	it more understandable. Is that fair?
16	A. Sure.
17	(Off the record.)
18	MR. PEDROSA:
19	Q. All right. Professor, you've
20	given some other depositions this year in
21	2011 already, right?
22	A. I have. Yes.
23	Q. And most recently, you gave a very
24	short deposition in the Tullo case; is that
25	right?
0153
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. And then in February and March,
3	you did two days of depositions in the
4	Jewett case; is that right?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. Okay. I want to ask you some
7	questions with respect to the opinions that
8	you gave to my colleague, Roger Geary, in
9	the Jewett case and just see if any of
10	those opinions have changed.
11	Do you remember that deposition?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Great.
14	Have any of your opinions with
15	respect to Lorillard Tobacco Company
16	changed since the ones that you expressed
17	to Mr. Geary at that deposition?
18	A. No.
19	Q. Have you done any new research
20	that has either informed or expanded the
21	opinions that you gave with respect to
22	Lorillard Tobacco Company in the Jewett
23	deposition?
24	A. No.
25	Q. Have you come up with any new
0154
1	opinions with respect to specifically
2	Lorillard Tobacco Company since that Jewett
3	deposition?
4	A. No.
5	Q. Have you located or maybe
6	rediscovered any additional documents to
7	support any of your opinions as they relate
8	to Lorillard Tobacco Company since that
9	Jewett deposition?
10	A. No.
11	Q. And is that true for all the
12	different topic areas that Mr. Geary asked
13	you about?
14	A. Well, I -
15	Q. If you'd like me to go through
16	them, I can. Just --
17	A. Well, I haven't done any
18	additional work on Lorillard since that
19	deposition. So what I knew at that
20	deposition is what I know right now. So I
21	haven't done any additional activity.
22	Q. And the reason I ask is because
23	there were some questions where you
24	answered, and your answer was something
25	along the lines of, well, I'm not aware of
0155
1	anything in that regard, I would have to do
2	more research.
3	And so I want to make sure you
4	haven't done any more research and that
5	there's nothing new that I don't know
6	about.
7	A. I haven't done any research since
8	then. So there's nothing -- if I thought
9	that I might discover anything new, I have
10	yet to engage upon that discovery. So I
11	haven't done anything since then.
12	Q. Okay. For purposes of this case,
13	the Calloway case, what documents -- what
14	internal Lorillard Tobacco Company
15	documents do you intend to use in
16	connection with your testimony at trial?
17	A. Internal Lorillard documents?
18	What comes to mind, there's a 1964 summary
19	of polling data. I don't know if I would
20	show that to the jury, but that's something
21	that comes to mind, where Lorillard had the
22	Gallup organization pull together a wide
23	variety of polling information, some of it
24	publically available, some of it internal
25	polling.
0156
1	I don't really -- you know, I
2	haven't really considered much by way of
3	Lorillard documents. So I as sit here, I
4	cannot think of any others that I would
5	use.
6	Q. The 1964 summary of polling data
7	that you mentioned, what relevance or
8	impact does that have on your opinions?
9	A. Well, earlier in the examination
10	today, we discussed the issue of what
11	percentages of smokers knew based on
12	certain polling instruments, do you think
13	cigarettes are one of the causes of lung
14	cancer, kind of Gallup polls, long-term
15	time series, that particular document is a
16	nice summary of all of that pulling that
17	material together up to 1964. That's
18	really it.
19	The significance is that it pulls
20	together a mix of publically-available and
21	internal polling information and supports
22	the opinion that I gave earlier in the
23	examination, about the direction of public
24	knowledge on the issue of lung cancer and
25	cigarettes.
0157
1	Q. And do you draw any conclusions or
2	opinions that are specific to Lorillard
3	from that particular document?
4	A. I do not.
5	Q. You've already told us you can't
6	think of any other internal Lorillard
7	documents that you intend to use in your
8	testimony --
9	A. Yeah. As I sit here --1 mean, I
10	could use lots of Lorillard documents, but
11	right now I don't think, you know, I would
12	use them.
13	Q. And I just want to make sure.
14	What about -- maybe you're including
15	advertisements. Maybe you're not including
16	advertisements. So I'll ask you the
17	question specifically in respect to
18	advertisements.
19	Do you expect to use any Lorillard
20	advertisements in connection with your
21	testimony at trial in this case?
22	A. Yes.
23	Just for clarification. I
24	understood your previous question to mean
25	kind of internal memoranda and that kind of
0158
I	stuff --
2	Q. And that's why I --
3	A. Yeah. Newport ads, sure. I think
4	that's one of the enumerated brands used by
5	the decedent. And I think Newport is an
6	important part of the Lorillard product
7	line.
8	Q. And which Newport ads are you
9	planning to use in connection with your
10	testimony in this case?
II	A. I haven't selected any particular
12	ads, but probably ones from the 1970s,
13	maybe even the 1980s, maybe the '60s. I
14	haven't made that decision yet.
15	Q. When do you expect that you'll
16	make that decision?
17	A. You know, when I discuss with the
18	attorneys, you know, what they intend to
19	ask me at the direct examination. I don't
20	know when that would be. It might be
21	sooner. It might be later.
22	You know, I've been deposed in two
23	previous cases in which I wasn't called to
24	testify. So I don't know. I mean, really,
25	I don't know.
0159
1	Q. What opinions do you plan to use
2	of Newport advertisements to support or
3	illustrate?
4	A. Sure. The same way I would use
5	the other brand advertisements, to show the
6	jury what cigarette advertising looked
7	like, and this is something that -- at
8	least at these points in historical time.
9	Q. And is it true that, as with your
10	testimony earlier today in response to Mr.
11	Sebold's questions, you don't intend to
12	give any kind of opinion as to whether or
13	not Mr. Calloway, the decedent, saw any
14	particular Newport ad?
15	A. Right. I mean, the same time, my
16	answers to that line of questioning about
17	placing Mr. Calloway in front of a
18	particular advertisement apply to all
19	advertisements, including the ones put
20	forth by the Lorillard Tobacco Company for
21	Newports.
22	Q. And just to make sure that I'm not
23	missing something by the wording of my
24	questions, you don't plan to give any
25	opinion that Mr. Calloway was exposed to or
0160
1	saw any particular ad campaign, as
2	distinguished from a particular ad, the
3	campaign itself?
4	A. Well, I mean, I'll talk about the
5	advertisements and give a statement how
6	widely they were circulated and where they
7	appeared and the kind of publications. You
8	know, it's likely that Mr. Calloway
9	encountered at least to some degree any and
10	all of these ads, but I can't put him
11	specifically in front of a particular ad or
12	campaign based on the information in the
13	depositions, which is all that I have
14	available to me.
15	But, again, keeping in mind what I
16	said earlier today, I mean, that's --1
17	would be consistent with the line of
18	questioning from this morning.
19	Q. Have you identified any particular
20	Newport campaign as distinguished from
21	individual ads that you intend to discuss
22	in your testimony in this case?
23	A. I have not yet. No.
24	Q. What is your understanding of the
25	brands that were manufactured by Lorillard
0161
1	that the decedent Johnnie Calloway smoked
2	in this case?
3	A. Well, there are a lot of brands
4	listed, and I can't recall if Kent was one
5	of them. I don't think it was, but I could
6	refer to the -- to Mrs. Calloway's
7	deposition, I guess. But the one that
8	stood out, that has stood in my mind is
9	Newport.
10	Q. And do you have any information
11	about what period of time in his life Mr.
12	Calloway smoked any brands manufactured by
13	Lorillard?
14	A. I don't.
15	Q. Is it safe to say that your
16	understanding of the brands of cigarettes
17	that Mr. Calloway smoked comes primarily
18	from the deposition of his second wife,
19	Marvine Calloway, the plaintiff in this
20	case?
21	A. Yes. That's correct.
22	Q. And do you remember when it was
23	that Mrs. Calloway, Marvine Calloway
24	actually started dating and subsequently
25	married the decedent?
0162
1	A. I believe they were married around
2	1971. So she did encounter him later in
3	his life.
4	Q. Do you recall that she testified
5	that she really didn't know what brands of
6	cigarettes he smoked prior to the time that
7	they started dating?
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. So to your knowledge, is there any
10	indication in this case that Mr. Calloway,
11	Johnnie Calloway, smoked any brands
12	manufactured by Lorillard prior to the
13	1970s?
14	A. I just don't know either way. You
15	know, his brother talks about some of his
16	brand choices. The list isn't nearly as
17	expansive.
18	You know, it's -- given the
19	tentative and tenuous nature of all of the
20	reports of what Mr. Calloway smoked, it
21	sounds like he was not a one-brand
22	cigarette smoker, but someone who smoked a
23	wide variety of brands, and my sense is
24	that explains the wide number of brands
25	that are mentioned and the fact that people
0163
1	say, well, I'm not sure what he smoked, but
2	I know he was always smoking. So it seems
3	that he probably smoked a wide variety of
4	manufacturers and brands of cigarettes.
5	Q. Professor Kyriakoudes, you're not
6	planning on giving any opinions that
7	anything in an advertisement for Newport or
8	any other Lorillard brand was false; is
9	that right?
10	A. False? You know, I've never
11	really talked about advertising that way in
12	the past. I've put forth the advertising
13	to show the ways in which the industry
14	sought to persuade people to smoke and to
15	use their particular products.
16	Q. But it's not your intention to put
17	forth an advertisement and say the
18	following statement of this advertisement
19	is false as of the time it was made?
20	A. No. That's not my intention.
21	I've never made that type of direct -- that
22	type of direct testimony.
23	Q. That's not the type of testimony
24	you've given in any other trials in which
25	you've given testimony?
0164
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. And it's not your intention to
3	give that type of testimony in this case?
4	A. That's right.
5	Q. And if you're not planning on
6	testifying that Johnnie Calloway saw any
7	particular advertisements or advertising
8	campaigns by Lorillard, I assume you're
9	also not going to be testifying as to
10	whether or not Johnnie Calloway relied on
11	any particular advertisement or advertising
12	campaign by Lorillard; is that right?
13	A. Well, I mean, again, we talked
14	about this this morning. I can't put him
15	in a particular place at a particular time
16	with a particular ad.
17	I do think that's a reasonable
18	historical inference once we look at the
19	pervasiveness of cigarette advertisements
20	during this historical period and then look
21	at the behavior of individuals in terms of
22	choosing a product, that there is to some
23	degree a reasonable inference that they
24	have chosen that product on the basis of
25	the advertisement. I mean, that was the
0165
1	intention of the advertising, to persuade
2	people to use the product.
3	To the extent that any smoker,
4	including Mr. Calloway, behaved as the
5	product manufacturer intended them to
6	behave, is that reliance? I mean, that's a
7	legal term. They certainly were doing what
8	the industry had hoped they would do, by
9	buying and using the product.
10	Q. But you agree with me that if you
11	can't put -- if you can't testify that
12	Johnnie Calloway saw a particular ad, you
13	certainly can't testify that Johnnie
14	Calloway relied on that particular ad?
15	MS. GOTTLIEB: Object to the form.
16	A. On a particular ad, yes. But on
17	cigarette advertising as a cumulative
18	historical reality in American life, well,
19	I mean, that's -- you know, it was
20	everywhere.
21	MR. PEDROSA:
22	Q. I understand that. You discussed
23	that I think with Mr. Sebold, and I'm not
24	trying to get you to restate all that
25	testimony.
0166
1	As I understand it, you're going
2	to draw a historical inference that -- what
3	you call a historical inference that
4	atmospherically there was cigarette
5	advertising and consumers acted in a
6	certain way, and you draw conclusions from
7	that, but you're not going to say that
8	Johnnie Calloway in particular relied on a
9	particular statement in a particular ad or
10	ad campaign to chose one brand over another
11	brand at one particular moment in time?
12	A. That's correct. Yes.
13	Q. Sir, you testified among the
14	depositions that you read in this case was
15	the deposition of Frank Calloway, the
16	decedent's brother?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. Do you recall Frank Calloway's
19	testimony about his conversations with his
20	brother Johnnie with regard to a public
21	service announcement that he had seen on
22	television which described as showing,
23	quote, unquote, a black lung from cigarette
24	smoking?
25	A. Let me -- since I've got it here,
0167
1	literally right here, what page?
2	Q. I just want to know if you
3	remember it. If you don't remember it —
4	A. It may have been in there. I'd
5	just have to refresh my memory.
6	Q. Really my only question is going
7	to be whether you've done any research to
8	try to identify that particular public
9	service announcement and to review the
10	public service announcement itself?
11	A. I've looked at all of the American
12	Cancer Society public announcements that
13	were released during the late 1960s and
14	showed through the early 1970s. So it's --
15	I no doubt have seen the one they refer to.
16	But from public health groups, American
17	Cancer Society, American Lung Association,
18	American Heart Association and the like --
19	I haven't actually connected this
20	particular deposition with that body of
21	knowledge.
22	Q. So I take it you also have not
23	gone back to your reliance list to
24	determine whether or not that particular
25	public service announcement appears on your
0168
1	reliance list?
2	A. That's correct.
3	Q. Does that particular public
4	service announcement have any impact on
5	your opinions in this case?
6	A. Well, I mean, all of the public
7	service announcements are part of the story
8	of the smoking/health debate. It is an
9	interesting story. They are relevant.
10	Q. Does the fact that the evidence in
11	this case that Johnnie Calloway was
12	specifically aware of that particular
13	public service announcement give it greater
14	weight or more importance in your testimony
15	or opinions than the atmospheric
16	information that you're going to testify
17	about?
18	A. No. No. If asked, I -- if they
19	would ask me about the Fairness Doctrine
20	and the public service announcements that
21	were aired, including Perry Mason's
22	prosecutor and the like and others and --
23	I mean, they're part of the history as
24	well.
25	I mean, there was, you know, a
0169
1	counter-narrative to the industry, and I do
2	try to tell both sides in my testimony.
3	Q. So is it your intention in your
4	testimony in this case to specifically
5	reference items like this public service
6	announcement that the plaintiff in this
7	case actually was aware of and we have
8	specific evidence about?
9	A. Yes. That's part of the story.
10	Q. Mr. Sebold asked you a series of
11	questions about the newspapers and
12	magazines that Mr. Calloway read.
13	Do you remember whether or not
14	Reader's Digest was also among the
15	magazines that he read?
16	A. I don't recall Reader's Digest
17	being mentioned, but that was a widely
18	circulated magazine and an important
19	magazine in the past. I've always talked
20	about Reader's Digest. I mean, just
21	because it's not mentioned in the
22	deposition doesn't mean that it wasn't out
23	there. I mean, you go to the doctor's
24	office, you sit at the machine shop or the
25	car shop, I mean, information flows, and,
0170
1	of course, it has a secondary life as
2	people talk about it.
3	Q. Well, do you recall Marvine
4	Calloway testifying that her sister had a
5	subscription to Reader's Digest and she'd
6	hand down the copies over to Johnnie
7	Calloway and Marvine? Does that ring a
8	bell?
9	A. Yeah. That does sound familiar.
10	Reader's Digest is an important magazine.
11	Q. Now, I wanted to ask you some
12	questions about Exhibit 3, which is a
13	supplement to your reliance materials. I'm
14	not going to actually ask you about the
15	supplement. This is the ads that you got
16	from the newspaper in Hattiesburg from the
17	1940s.
18	Mr. Sebold already asked you if
19	you had seen evidence or indication that
20	Johnnie Calloway read the newspaper in
21	Hattiesburg during the 1940s, and I believe
22	you said you have no specific indication of
23	that; is that correct?
24	A. That's right.
25	Q. Now, nevertheless, you went
0171
1	through the exercise of pulling
2	advertisements that appeared during the
3	1940s in that newspaper and compiled them
4	into this exhibit, correct?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. Now, there is evidence in this
7	case that later on in life, when he was
8	living in Melbourne and in Fort Lauderdale,
9	that Mr. Calloway did read the newspaper on
10	a daily basis, correct?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. And as a matter of fact, there's
13	testimony that he read cover to cover; is
14	that right?
15	A. I don't remember that phrase, but
16	I do remember that there was testimony that
17	he read the paper.
18	Q. Now, did you do a similar search
19	on the newspapers available in Melbourne
20	and in Fort Lauderdale, Sun-Sentinel, Miami
21	Herald, to find the same type of
22	information that you looked for in the
23	Hattiesburg newspaper for the 1940s?
24	A. No. My interest was looking at
25	the formative period in his life.
0172
1	Q. Why did you not -- why did you not
2	do the same type of search for the
3	newspapers that were available in Melbourne
4	and Fort Lauderdale?
5	A. Well, by then, he was an adult,
6	and I -- my purpose in looking at the
7	Hattiesburg paper was to understand some of
8	the information that was circulating around
9	in terms of marketing when he was a young
10	person, you know, at the beginning of the
11	period where smoking initiation likely
12	would have begun.
13	Q. I understand that as the reason
14	why you searched for the information from
15	the Hattiesburg newspaper in the 1940s.
16	I'm not sure if that answers my question as
17	to why you didn't also search -- in other
18	words, it's not an either/or.
19	You weren't limited to what
20	newspaper you could search. Why didn't you
21	also search the records that were available
22	from the newspapers in Melbourne and Fort
23	Lauderdale that Mr. Calloway read?
24	A. Sure. Right. I'll clarify.
25	The significance of the
0173
1	Hattiesburg paper is that was, you know,
2	part of the information or media, if you
3	will, during his youth and adolescence.
4	He's in Fort Lauderdale an adult, and it's
5	-- by then, it's the 1970s, and it's a
6	different point in the life cycle.
7	I mean, I just didn't feel the
8	need given that he was already an adult and
9	a well-established smoker, a regular
10	smoker, what have you, to do that kind of
11	marketing and advertising research.
12	Q. So you didn't feel that
13	information that may have come to Mr.
14	Calloway's attention as an adult was
15	relevant to your opinions in this case?
16	A. In the later part of his life,
17	it's just -- you know, there's only so much
18	time, and I've always had a strong emphasis
19	on the formative portion of a smoker's
20	career as a smoker. You can look at all of
21	my testimony. It's always kind of
22	front-loaded to the beginnings because that
23	sets the pattern that people tend to follow
24	for the rest of their lives.
25	Q. You understand that this is my one
0174
1	chance to ask you questions in this case
2	and understand what your opinions are,
3	correct?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. So you're not planning to come
6	back and surprise me at trial of having
7	done a search of the Fort Lauderdale and
8	the Melbourne newspapers at some point
9	between now and the trial of this case, are
10	you?
11	A. I'm not intending to do that.
12	Q. Have you seen any evidence in this
13	case that Johnnie Calloway ever smoked a
14	brand of cigarette that was manufactured by
15	Lorillard back in the 1940s?
16	Do you understand my question?
17	A. Yeah, I do. And I don't.
18	Q. So when was Newport first
19	introduced?
20	A. I don't know the exact year, but
21	it's a 1960s or late '50s product, the
22	filter, you know came in with the filter.
23	Q. And you weren't sure about whether
24	or not he smoked Kent, but you also know
25	that Kent was not available in the 1940s,
0175
I	just as --
2	A. Right. Kent is '53.
3	Q. Now, Exhibit 4 is your second
4	supplement to the reliance list, and these
5	are ads that appear in the Chicago
6	newspapers; is that correct?
7	A. Well, they're more news stories
8	than they are advertisements. There are
9	some ads, but mostly news stories.
10	Q. And these are not news stories
II	that you pulled specifically for this case;
12	is that right?
13	A. That's correct.
14	Q. Did you supplement the Chicago
15	news stories that you had for this case in
16	any way?
17	A. I interpret that question to mean
18	did I do research in Chicago newspapers for
19	this case that I had not done previously.
20	Q. Correct.
21	A. No. No. These were things that I
22	already had. They're just kind of pulled
23	and highlighted. They've always been part
24	of the materials that you guys have been
25	getting.
0176
1	Q. But just to close the loop, if
2	there are 25 items on the list, it's not
3	the case that 20 of them were preexisting
4	and then you found five more for this case;
5	this is the list that it's been -- you
6	know, going back even before any work you
7	did in this case?
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. Do you know how long --1 know you
10	don't know exactly what time period Mr.
11	Calloway lived in Chicago, but do you know
12	how long a period of time he lived in
13	Chicago?
14	A. There seemed to be uncertainty --
15	and maybe I missed it. I don't know
16	exactly how long he was in Chicago.
17	There's references. His wife knew he lived
18	in Chicago, but she doesn't have precise
19	dates. It was a not uncommon destination
20	for young people who wanted to get out of
21	Hattiesburg.
22	Q. And find work?
23	A. Yes. At that time -- in fact,
24	there's a well-known barber shop called the
25	Hattiesburg Barber Shop on the south side
0177
1	of Chicago. I don't think it's there any
2	more, but it's documented in the '50s and
3	'60s, Great Migration.
4	Q. You gave some testimony concerning
5	opinions that you intend to offer in this
6	case relating to advertising that was
7	directed to the African-American
8	demographic.
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. Do you have any specific opinions
11	that you intend to offer with respect to
12	Lorillard within that category of opinions?
13	A. Well, Lorillard -- Lorillard's
14	actions were quite similar to that of the
15	other major menthol manufacturers, Brown &
16	Williamson with Kool and Reynolds with
17	Salem, in that they too, you know,
18	discovered the African-American market, and
19	early on, Newport had a strong presence
20	among African-American smokers.
21	So that's -- that's really the
22	opinion there, that they also saw the
23	African-American consumer as a significant
24	component of the demand for the mentholated
25	product.
0178
1	Q. Is there anything else you expect
2	to say concerning Lorillard with regard to
3	those opinions?
4	A. That's about it. That's it.
5	Q. Now, Lorillard didn't create the
6	menthol cigarette market, correct?
7	A. That's correct. I mean, the
8	menthol cigarette itself had an earlier
9	introduction, which we talked about this
10	morning. Newport was introduced to
11	participate in that market. It was a
12	growing market. No, they didn't create it.
13	Q. And Lorillard did not create the
14	market for cigarettes, mentholated or
15	unmentholated, among African-Americans,
16	correct?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. By the time that Lorillard
19	introduced Newport, were there other
20	mentholated cigarettes already on the
21	market that were being advertised in
22	particular or among different groups to the
23	African-American demographic?
24	A. That's a good question. Was
25	Lorillard the first in that? I don't know.
0179
1	I just don't know. That's a good point.
2	Q. Well, that actually wasn't my
3	question.
4	A. Okay.
5	Q. Although I appreciate --1 would
6	have asked you that question, so I
7	appreciate you answering that you don't
8	know.
9	But my question is by the time
10	that Newport was introduced, had there
11	already been other mentholated cigarettes
12	on the market, and had some of the research
13	that you have already described with
14	respect to Salem and Kool been ongoing by
15	other manufacturers in regard to the
16	African-American demographic and their
17	particular preferences?
18	A. Okay. Well, the first part of
19	your question, yeah, there were menthol
20	cigarettes that predated Newport.
21	Second part, I'm not exactly sure.
22	I've never put the story together in that
23	way, did Newport -- my sense is that --1
24	am just not sure. I am just not sure to
25	the second part of your question. I don't
0180
1	know.
2	Q. Since you don't know, I assume
3	it's not your intention to make that claim
4	in your testimony at trial in this case?
5	A. I haven't intended to. I haven't
6	really thought of that question.
7	Q. And, again, I assume that you're
8	not planning to surprise me at trial by
9	going out and doing research on this issue
10	and come up with new opinions --
11	A. Do you think you put the idea in
12	my head? No. I have no surprises. I try
13	not to be surprising.
14	Q. I appreciate that. Thank you.
15	In the same vein, you mentioned
16	that the most recent volume of the journal
17	of Tobacco Control is devoted to menthol,
18	and you said that you've not reviewed it,
19	but you plan to; is that right?
20	A. That's right. It just came out
21	this week. I haven't had time to read the
22	articles.
23	Q. But you're not -- again, you're
24	not planning to surprise us at trial by
25	reviewing the journal of Tobacco Control's
0181
1	most recent volume and offer new opinions
2	that you haven't told us about as of yet,
3	correct?
4	A. If during the course of reading
5	that volume I develop some new opinion, I
6	will identify that to the plaintiffs
7	attorney and make myself available prior to
8	the trial so that you have an opportunity
9	to ask me so that you can best prepare for
10	your client.
11	Q. I appreciate that. In addition,
12	will you do the same if you find anything
13	within that volume that you decide you are
14	going to use to illustrate an opinion that
15	you were already going to give, but what
16	you're going to now use to provide further
17	support?
18	A. Sure. Yeah. If I come up with
19	anything new, be it a new exhibit, a new
20	document that fulfilled a preexisting
21	opinion or a new opinion, I will make that
22	known and make myself available with a very
23	flexible --1 mean, absolutely.
24	I believe in you being able to be
25	prepared for your job. That's important.
0182
1	Q. Thank you.
2	You mentioned a couple of times
3	that you had seen some evidence -- you
4	thought you had seen some evidence in this
5	case that Johnnie Calloway smoked light
6	cigarettes because he believed they were
7	healthier. Do I have that right?
8	A. Yes. There's a reference in his
9	daughter's --1 think it's Starr Williams'
10	deposition.
11	Q. You have that. That deposition is
12	not terribly long. Can you point me to the
13	page where that appears?
14	A. I think I can. Give me -- okay.
15	Yeah. I can't believe I found it this
16	quickly.
17	On page 47, towards the bottom and
18	then continuing on the top of page 48.
19	There might have been another reference
20	too, but I certainly got at least that one.
21	Q. May I see that transcript,
22	Professor?
23	A. Yeah. Right there.
24	Q. Well, Professor, as I read this,
25	it's describing a fact that Johnnie
0183
1	Calloway smoked light cigarettes at some
2	period of time, but I don't see where it
3	explains that the reason for that is a
4	belief on his part that they were
5	healthier, so --
6	A. Let me see that.
7	Q. You agree with me that that
8	particular passage doesn't describe the
9	reasons that he smoked light cigarettes,
10	right?
11	A. Let me go farther, then.
12	Q. I understand. I do want to look
13	for it, but just so we have a clear
14	record --
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. — you agree that pages 47 to 48
17	does not describe any reason why Johnnie
18	Calloway smoked light cigarettes?
19	A. You're right. You're right about
20	that. Just give me a second.
21	Q. Take your time. Flight's not
22	leaving for hours.
23	A. Do you have one with the
24	concordance in the back? This one doesn't
25	have the --
0184
1	Q. You know what, I do not have that
2	one with me. I was going to point you to
3	Marvine Calloway's deposition and ask you
4	if that's where you were basing that on,
5	but I --
6	A. It might have been -- in fairness,
7	they do run together --
8	Q. Well, why don't you take a moment
9	just to see if there's anything else in
10	that particular deposition, and then if you
11	don't find anything, I will point you to a
12	passage from Marvine Calloway's deposition,
13	and you can tell me if that is where you
14	are getting that particular piece of
15	information.
16	A. Okay. I'm not able to find the
17	passage that I thought -- oh. No. Here.
18	Yeah. On page 55,1 think this is -- lines
19	4 through 9 on page 55.
20	MR. BRENNER: Which deposition
21	were you in? I'm sorry.
22	THE WITNESS: This is Stan-
23	Williams.
24	MR. BRENNER: Thank you.
25	MR. PEDROSA:
0185
1	Q. May I see that again?
2	So this a passage where Starr
3	Williams testifies that she saw Mr.
4	Calloway smoking a light cigarette, and he
5	said, quote, these are better for me,
6	unquote?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. That's what you're relying upon?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. Do you have any other information
11	from which you're able to understand what
12	Mr. Calloway meant by, quote, these are
13	better for me?
14	A. Just what the deposition says.
15	Q. Do you know -- do you know how old
16	Johnnie Calloway was at the time or what
17	year this conversation took place?
18	A. Well, it's during Ms. Williams'
19	youth. She's about 10, more or less, and
20	-- when was she born? I don't have it
21	memorized, her birth year.
22	Q. Let me ask you this: Does it
23	impact your opinions in any way when that
24	statement was made by Mr. Calloway?
25	A. Well, it was made in the -- you
0186
1	know, in the late '70s or the 1980s, which
2	is when I expect that it was made,
3	somewhere around that time. That's how I
4	understood it. That's consistent with
5	other things, you know, other changes in
6	the cigarette market.
7	Q. When you say other changes in the
8	cigarette market, what do you mean?
9	A. That was pretty vague. Yeah.
10	Good follow-up question. I appreciate
11	that. It's the afternoon. I apologize for
12	not being precise.
13	You know, the era of the light
14	cigarette. You know, you get the filter
15	first, then lights, high-filtration
16	products and light.
17	Q. Is it your intention, Professor,
18	to offer any specific opinions about how
19	Johnnie Calloway came to any conclusion
20	about light cigarettes?
21	A. Him specifically?
22	Q. Him specifically.
23	A. No. I can only talk about what we
24	know about general patterns of public
25	knowledge on light cigarettes.
0187
1	Q. You're gonna talk about the
2	atmosphere, but not specifically what
3	Johnnie Calloway thought, believed or why
4	he thought or believed it?
5	A. Right. Yeah. Although, my
6	preference instead of atmosphere is
7	context, but same --1 understand where you
8	are. Yeah.
9	Q. Now, in response to Mr. Sebold's
10	questions, you explained that part of what
11	you do is to draw conclusions --
12	cause-and-effect conclusions connecting
13	cigarette advertising in general with
14	smoking behavior among populations. Do I
15	have that right?
16	A. Right. Yes. I mean, to a
17	reasonable degree of certainty.
18	Q. What methodology do you use to
19	draw those conclusions?
20	A. Well, we talked about that this
21	morning. I can summarize that.
22	I look at quantitative data, which
23	is both based on quantitative measures of
24	population-based smoking behavior,
25	prevalence, per capita cigarette
0188
1	consumption, for example, even total
2	cigarette sales, changes in the market for
3	cigarettes. So that is the changing
4	balance in the types of cigarettes sold and
5	how those change over time, and then the
6	qualitative examination of the content of
7	the advertising and the way -- you know,
8	and the positioning of the advertising, the
9	pervasiveness of it, and then finally
10	internal evaluations of the success of the
11	advertising. So it's multiple sources.
12	Q. Internal evaluations by whom?
13	A. Oh. By manufacturers and their --
14	and their agents, that is marketing
15	companies, advertising companies,
16	statements by marketing executives and the
17	like.
18	Q. Are there internal evaluation
19	documents specific to Lorillard upon which
20	you base any opinions in this case about
21	the cause-and-effect relationship between
22	cigarette advertising and smoking behavior?
23	A. Right. I am not recalling any
24	particular Lorillard document.
25	Q. If you don't recall any, I assume
0189
1	you're not currently planning on using any
2	in your testimony to illustrate or support
3	this particular opinion?
4	A. Right. And if I find one in my
5	files, I'll let you know or let the
6	plaintiffs attorneys know.
7	Q. Again, because you don't want to
8	surprise me at trial with something I'm not
9	prepared for, right?
10	A. Yeah.
11	Q. Are you familiar with the concept
12	of a confounding variable?
13	A. Confounding variable? That one, I
14	haven't heard of.
15	Q. So you understand that when
16	undertaking an experiment or an analysis,
17	one may find a correlation in time between
18	two factors, but that there may be multiple
19	explanations that would -- that would
20	explain why one thing occurred at the same
21	time as the other, but they aren't
22	necessarily related in a cause-and-effect
23	relationship?
24	A. That's true. Yes. I see. I just
25	never heard that particular term of art in
0190
1	my training.
2	Yes. To restate what you're
3	saying so that -- it seems like I
4	understand what you're asking about. You
5	could have correlations without a causal
6	connection. You can have coincidence. You
7	can have unaccounted-for variables. You
8	could have latent variables. You could
9	have things that you have not accounted
10	for. There's a whole manner of elements.
11	And that's true. That's true. That's one
12	of the reasons why you've got to look at
13	multiple types of evidence and use both
14	quantitative and qualitative approaches.
15	Q. When you are drawing conclusions
16	about cause-and-effect relationship between
17	cigarette advertising and smoking behavior
18	and populations, what, if anything, do you
19	do to make sure that you are accounting for
20	all of the types of things that you just
21	described that might give the appearance of
22	a correlation even in the absence of a
23	causal relationship?
24	A. Yeah. Well, that's a good
25	question. First and foremost, you know, I
0191
1	don't actually formally develop
2	correlations between say, for example,
3	consumption and expenditures on
4	advertising. That's too simplistic.
5	People who have done that usually have come
6	up with not very good results or not very
7	reliable results because there's other
8	factors. There's changes in the
9	composition of the -- there's a lot of
10	dynamic changes that are happening.
11	So, you know, you look at the
12	broad patterns of what's happening, you
13	know, the way in which cigarette
14	advertising, for example, bleeds into the
15	culture. I mean, it's no longer the case,
16	but, you know, 40, 50 years ago, if someone
17	sang the LSMFT song or any of the Winston
18	jingles, for example, or heard the theme
19	song from The Magnificent Seven that was
20	also used in the Marlboro campaign, that
21	would have had a cultural reference that it
22	no longer has.
23	So, you know, you have got to look
24	at it from all perspectives than just
25	simply make a judgment.
0192
1	Q. But aside from essentially trying
2	to review multiple sources of information
3	and making a judgment call, is there any
4	scientific approach or a particular
5	methodology that you'd use to ensure that
6	you are, to use my term, not being
7	confounded by some other variable that you
8	haven't accounted for?
9	A. Right. No. I use the methods
10	that historians employ, which is to use
11	multiple sources of evidence, so that we
12	have a complete picture of this process as
13	possible.
14	Q. But ultimately it's your judgment
15	that you are relying upon?
16	A. Yes. And training and methods as
17	a historian.
18	Q. Well, you say judgment and
19	training and methods as a historian, but
20	could another historian who has the same
21	training and uses the same methods on
22	occasion come to different conclusions than
23	you come to with regard to whether or not
24	there's a causal relationship between
25	cigarette advertising and smoking behavior?
0193
1	A. No doubt. And I'm sure you know
2	many of them.
3	Q. And I take it -- so I take it
4	there is no objective way that you could
5	say, well, I can disapprove this other
6	historian's judgment because it's not an
7	objective determination, it is a matter of
8	your judgment?
9	A. Well, no. I think it's objective.
10	Just because it involves, you know, my
11	analysis --1 mean, when I say judgment, I
12	mean my analysis of the evidence. You
13	know, we're dealing with social phenomena,
14	and it's not, for example, a chemistry
15	experiment, whereby if we increase the
16	amount of a particular enzyme, we're going
17	to get a commensurate increase in some
18	outcome in terms of a chemical reaction.
19	We're dealing with complex social
20	phenomena, and it's -- you know, my methods
21	are objective as anyone who involves
22	themselves in the analysis of complex
23	social phenomena.
24	Q. I understand. What I'm asking you
25	is when two historians both with the same
0194
1	or equally good training and both adopting
2	and employing the same methods come to
3	different conclusions on a question like
4	this one about whether there's a causal
5	relationship between cigarette advertising
6	and smoking behavior, is there a way for us
7	to objectively determine which of them is
8	right and which of them is wrong, or is it
9	simply a matter of two professionals who
10	have differing professional opinions?
11	A. Right. This is a very good
12	question and --
13	MR. SEBOLD: Do you get any extra
14	points when it's a good question? I just
15	wondered if it's kind of like class. Sorry
16	to interrupt.
17	MR. PEDROSA: Now you're trying to
18	compete with me. I've had a couple of
19	those.
20	MR. SEBOLD: I had some, too.
21	A. And my position on that is if—
22	if the other historian, Mr. X, Dr. X —
23	MR. PEDROSA:
24	Q. I think you're Dr. X.
25	A. Okay. Dr. Y —
0195
1	Q. Okay.
2	A. -- follows the same methodology I
3	follow, which is to look at the same data
4	and to weigh it the same way, he must come
5	or she must come to the same conclusion
6	that I come to.
7	Now, as a practical matter, what
8	they may -- the way historians actually do
9	it, they'll come in and say, well, I
10	disagree with your use of that particular
11	piece of evidence, or I don't think, you
12	know, your -- you know, I dispute how you
13	-- you -- you -- the weight that you give
14	to this particular piece of evidence, and,
15	therefore, I come to a different
16	conclusion.
17	But if we take the same steps, I
18	think -- and -- and look at the same
19	evidence and weigh the evidence the same
20	way, which is the method, then they will
21	actually come to the same conclusion.
22	And so to finish -- and I hate to
23	be long-winded. I'm sorry. The criticism
24	is to say, for example, well, you know,
25	this piece of evidence or that piece of
0196
1	evidence is incorrectly considered, and
2	that's, in essence, the method.
3	Q. But that --1 understand what
4	you're saying, that the dispute really is
5	limited to how one selects or how one
6	weighs the evidence, and if you hold those
7	variables constant, then the conclusion
8	should be the same, but there's a lot of
9	room for subjective interpretation in
10	deciding how one selects the evidence and
11	how one weighs the evidence in your
12	particular field, correct?
13	A. Well, that's true. And I might
14	add it's true in all fields. I mean, even
15	in statistics, an area which I have a
16	significant amount of training and have
17	published, you know, how you weigh era
18	terms, you know, how you're going to
19	transform a particular variable, am I going
20	to need to use a two-level regression or am
21	I going to stick to a one-level regression
22	or am I going to use a multi-level model or
23	not, and, I mean, there is a lot of
24	subjectivity in the statistical analysis of
25	social behavior as well.
0197
1	And, you know, we're getting into
2	graduate seminar topics, and I don't mean
3	to do that, but --
4	Q. I feel like I should be paying
5	tuition for this education.
6	A. No. No. No.
7	Q. Okay. Let's try to get back on
8	track a little bit.
9	Professor, the voluminous
10	materials on your reliance list, which you
11	testified you compiled over time, you've
12	read everything on that list?
13	A. At least once.
14	Q. And although you may not be able
15	to recall it from memory, at some point in
16	time, when it went on your list, it was
17	something you had reviewed, read and
18	decided it was significant enough for you
19	to include on the list?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. You were asked some questions at
22	your deposition in the Jewett case by Mr.
23	Geary about Lorillard submission to the
24	Surgeon General in advance of the 1964
25	Surgeon General report. Do you remember
0198
1	that series of questions?
2	A. I do. And I have not followed up
3	on that. So my knowledge of that is frozen
4	in time.
5	Q. But the actual submission itself
6	does appear on your reliance list, correct?
7	A. Does it? I — I —
8	Q. You don't know?
9	A. I --1 --1 meant to review that
10	and haven't. And maybe I'm juggling too
11	many -- you know, got to many --
12	Q. Let me put it this way: If it
13	does appear on your list, that means at
14	some point in time you've read the
15	submission?
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. And that at that point in time,
18	you, first of all, determined that it was
19	an accurate and correct copy of a
20	submission that was made to the FCC and
21	that it was important enough to your
22	opinions to include on the list, right?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. Do you have any particular or
25	specific opinions with respect to light
0199
1	cigarettes as it relates directly or
2	specifically to Lorillard that you plan to
3	give in this case?
4	A. No, that are not any different
5	than the category of light cigarettes as
6	they were perceived by the smoking public.
7	Q. Are there any particular Lorillard
8	documents or facts that relate to Lorillard
9	that you plan to use to illustrate your
10	opinions with respect to light cigarettes
11	in this case?
12	A. I can't think of that right now.
13	None come to mind.
14	Q. As you've said in the past, if
15	some come to mind before your testimony,
16	you'll let us know so that we can explore
17	that issue, correct?
18	A. Yes. And I'll make myself
19	available.
20	Q. If I ask the same questions with
21	respect to filters, are there any
22	particular facts or documents relating to
23	Lorillard that you plan to use to
24	illustrate or explain your opinions in this
25	case as they relate to filters?
0200
1	A. I don't anticipate talking about
2	the Kent cigarette. There's quite a big
3	story there, but I don't anticipate talking
4	about Kent. I don't have any specific
5	Lorillard documents that come to mind
6	related to filters.
7	Q. You've referred us today on a
8	number of occasions to your testimony in
9	the Alexander case, correct?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. And the Alexander case involved
12	another plaintiff who was a Southern
13	African-American, correct?
14	A. That's correct.
15	Q. Now, Lorillard was not a defendant
16	in that case, correct?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. Given that Lorillard was not a
19	defendant in that case, I assume that in
20	your direct testimony, you did not rely
21	upon or use Lorillard documents or facts to
22	illustrate any of your opinions; is that
23	fair?
24	A. That's fair and true.
25	Q. So given that Lorillard is a
0201
1	defendant in this case, is there any
2	Lorillard documents or facts that you
3	intend to use to illustrate opinions that
4	you'll be giving in this case that we
5	haven't already talked about?
6	A. None come to mind. I can't think
7	of any.
8	Q. We're making progress, Professor.
9	Bear with me. I'm trying to flip through
10	and make sure I've covered everything that
11	I need to cover.
12	You don't plan to use, for
13	example, any Kent advertisements to
14	illustrate your opinions in this case; is
15	that right?
16	A. I don't think Kent is a brand that
17	he was listed as smoking, so I don't intend
18	to use Kent.
19	Q. Well, assuming with me for a
20	moment that among the list of 30 some-odd
21	brands that Marvine Calloway gave for her
22	husband, that Kent was one of the brands --
23	A. Oh. Okay. I'm misremembering.
24	Sorry.
25	Q. Well, what I want to make sure is
0202
1	-- because there are Kent advertisements on
2	your reliance list, and in other cases you
3	said I'm going to talk about some of these
4	Kent advertisements. You haven't said that
5	here.
6	I want to know whether or not
7	that's something you plan to do, and if so,
8	which ones?
9	A. Well, I mean, if I show a Kent ad
10	and --1 mean, I haven't planned out my
11	direct testimony and discussed that with
12	the attorneys. But the Kent ads that I
13	have on my reliance list -- and I think
14	some of them are in the PowerPoint in
15	there, in the composite, are ones from the
16	'53 to '56 period, and Kent had some ads
17	where they touted an endorsement by the
18	American Medical Association and made
19	fairly strong statements about the efficacy
20	of their filters. So it would be from that
21	period.
22	Q. If it's the case and if you
23	confirm that there's no evidence in this
24	case that Johnnie Calloway smoked Kent
25	cigarettes at any time before 1970, at the
0203
1	very earliest, would you still expect to
2	use those in your testimony?
3	A. You know, my position has been
4	that cigarette ads inform the public about
5	the product category of cigarettes,
6	including subvarieties of cigarettes, such
7	as filters and the like.
8	I haven't thought about it. I
9	mean, as I sit here, it was not my
10	intention to pull those Kent ads out. I
11	would probably choose other ads.
12	Q. If you -- if you -- again, given
13	that it's your current intention not to use
14	those Kent ads and you're expecting to use
15	other ads, if you change your mind and
16	decide you will be using Kent ads, you will
17	agree to provide that information to
18	plaintiffs counsel and make yourself
19	available for a follow-up deposition so I
20	can ask you which Kent ads you're going to
21	be talking about; is that fair?
22	A. Absolutely. Yes, it's fair. I
23	will do that.
24	MS. GOTTLIEB: I'm sorry. If I
25	could just chime in here for a second. As
0204
1	far as the Kent ads and advertisements in
2	general, I think it's fair to say that any
3	of the ads that are already on his reliance
4	list -- you know, you already have those,
5	and if there are any new additional ads,
6	that we would provide and be able to make
7	Dr. Kyriakoudes available again, however,
8	only with new information.
9	MR. PEDROSA:
10	Q. Let me ask you a question, Dr.
11	Kyriakoudes. You agree that there are
12	hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
13	cigarette advertisements on your reliance
14	list, right?
15	A. Yes. There's a large number.
16	I've collected a lot.
17	Q. You agree to put hundreds and
18	hundreds and hundreds of advertisements on
19	a general reliance list and give that out
20	for every case and then pick and choose
21	half a dozen for a particular case, it's
22	not exactly fair to make me guess which
23	half a dozen you intend to use?
24	A. I mean, you know these materials.
25	I mean, you're a full-time professional on
0205
1	that. I mean, you've got a staff. I mean,
2	you know the stuff.
3	I'm -- I'm --1 have not planned
4	out the direct testimony for this case.
5	So, you know, I've got my opinions, which
6	you've been asking me about, and I -- you
7	know, my intention is to be consistent with
8	prior testimony -- you know, prior
9	testimony about the nature of the
10	cigarette, how it's operated in the
11	American life, how it's changed over time
12	and all the issues that are relevant to my
13	disclosure.
14	In each trial, I use different
15	exhibits, sure, to illustrate that,
16	different advertisements. I mean, in some
17	of the trials, you know, Hess, for example,
18	the very first of the Engle trial, we put
19	up composites with over a hundred ads in
20	the composite and just pull certain ones
21	out to talk about.
22	You know, I haven't met with the
23	plaintiffs attorneys to select those
24	exhibits from my reliance documents
25	that they want to show.
0206
1	Q. I understand. All I'm trying to
2	do is avoid having to ask you a whole
3	series of questions that's going to turn
4	out to be moot and irrelevant because it's
5	not having anything to do with your
6	opinions.
7	A. Sure. Yeah.
8	Q. Do you remember giving a
9	deposition in a case called -- for a
10	plaintiff named Cindy Evers?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. And in that case, you were
13	questioned by my colleague Roger Geary on
14	behalf of Lorillard, and you said that you
15	may use some Kent advertisements to
16	illustrate your opinions, and then he asked
17	you some questions about those. That
18	deposition was given back in August of
19	2009.
20	Is it the case that -- or have any
21	of your opinions with respect to Kent
22	advertisements changed or been modified in
23	any way since the time you gave that
24	deposition back in August of 2009?
25	A. No.
0207
1	Q. You haven't done any additional
2	work to expand upon or further support any
3	of your opinions in that regard, have you?
4	A. No.
5	Q. And you don't plan to do that
6	before the trial in this case?
7	A. I do not. So, no, I don't.
8	Q. Bear with me, Professor. I think
9	we're at the finish line.
10	A. I'm with you.
11	Q. I had one more.
12	Sir, you testified that the
13	reliance list that we received and the
14	materials that go with it came from your
15	hard drive which you bum from time to time
16	and provide and that that's where the
17	folder structure reflected on Exhibit
18	Number 2 comes from as well.
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Are there any folders on your hard
21	drive that contain documents, information
22	or data related to tobacco or cigarettes
23	that are not contained within Exhibits 1
24	and 2? Is there another folder somewhere
25	that has more stuff?
0208
1	A. No.
2	Q. Do you have a folder of your let's
3	call it greatest hits or most-used
4	documents or anything like that?
5	You said this is a very voluminous
6	set of materials. I want to understand if
7	you have a smaller set that you go back to
8	from time to time.
9	A. I don't. I mean, I have my
10	favorites that I keep in my head, which
11	have come up in most every trial. You
12	know, I like Reader's Digest. I like --1
13	have certain favorite New York Times
14	stories when those are relevant. Not so
15	much here. My favorite radio and TV
16	broadcast scripts, Dave Garroway on The
17	Today Show holding up the Frank Statement,
18	radio reports, things like that. But I
19	don't --1 don't have them segregated like
20	that.
21	Q. And that's what I'm trying to
22	understand. I know you have a lot of
23	information in your head, but do you have a
24	grouping of material somewhere that you go
25	back to to brush up or that is your kind of
0209
1	standard I-start-from-here list when
2	putting together my direct testimony?
3	A. I don't.
4	Q. It's all in your head?
5	A. Yeah. I try to tell the same
6	story each time. It might be a good idea
7	to do that, though, and when I do, I'll let
8	you have it, all y'all, you, the collective
9	group. I mean, I --
10	Q. "All y'all" being the plural of
11	"y'all."
12	A. Yeah. That's right. That's my
13	special version on the Southern lexicon
14	there. It's better than "you's guys,"
15	which is what I grew up saying.
16	I don't have it. I just don't
17	have it that way. I'm drowning in
18	information. I mean, it's --
19	Q. I'm trying to throw you a rope.
20	A. I know. I think it's --
21	Q. I really am.
22	A. I need to grab that rope.
23	MR. PEDROSA: Professor, those are
24	all the questions I have, subject to any
25	additional recross or redirect, whatever
0210
1	you want to call it.
2	Thank you. I appreciate your
3	time, and I appreciate all of your answers.
4	MR. BRENNER: I just need a
5	two-minute break.
6	(Off the record.)
7	EXAMINATION
8	BY MR. BRENNER:
9	Q. Professor Kyriakoudes, again,
10	Andrew Brenner on behalf of Philip Morris
11	USA. I promise to be briefer than my
12	colleagues.
13	You shared with us earlier in the
14	deposition that if we wanted to look to
15	sort of the best example of your direct
16	testimony, you pointed us to the Alexander
17	case. Do you recall that?
18	A. That would be the one related to
19	African-American smokers. Yeah.
20	Q. Right. And I believe you said it
21	was a good model, if we looked at that, and
22	we could understand your opinions at least
23	on that area of the African-American
24	smoking area; is that a fair statement?
25	A. That's fair.
0211
1	Q. And I understood in the testimony
2	that you gave -- initially this morning you
3	were asked whether there was --1 believe
4	the word was "pernicious," but I'm a
5	simpler person than that. I'm going to
6	change the word. You were asked if there
7	was anything bad about the fact that
8	cigarette manufacturers marketed to various
9	different segments of society, including
10	African-Americans, and you said there was
11	nothing bad about it, other than the fact
12	that they were selling a product that when
13	used as intended kills people.
14	Is that a fair summary of what you
15	testified to?
16	A. Yes. I mean, that's -- that's
17	what's negative about it.
18	Q. Right.
19	A. If it had been a different
20	product, it wouldn't be so negative.
21	Q. Right. And you know from your
22	review of documents -- and you were kind
23	enough to share with us many, many
24	documents -- but that the various different
25	cigarette manufacturers directed marketing
0212
1	campaigns to all different segments of
2	society. Is that a fair statement?
3	A. Yes. And over time, there's a
4	story there. Yes.
5	Q. And that would be true also of
6	sellers of other commercial products, it's
7	not uncommon for sellers of products to
8	direct particular ad campaigns or marketing
9	strategies to different groups of society;
10	is that fair to say?
11	A. Yes. That's fair to say.
12	Q. Nothing bad about that, right?
13	A. No. No. Segmented marketing is a
14	-- is a significant part of the development
15	of modem marketing.
16	Q. Right. I wanted to make sure. A
17	word was thrown around that sometimes could
18	have a negative connotation, that they
19	targeted different segments of the
20	population. You don't use the word
21	"targeted" in a negative sense, correct?
22	A. No. It's simply descriptive.
23	Q. Right. I mean, segmented
24	marketing is another way to say targeted
25	marketing?
0213
1	A. Yes. Those would be synonyms.
2	Q. Now, Mr. Pedrosa asked you about
3	the Alexander case in particular, and he
4	asked you if you recall if Lorillard was a
5	defendant, and you said your recollection
6	was they were not, correct?
7	A. Right. I think that was just RJ.
8	Reynolds and Philip Morris.
9	Q. Was Philip Morris a defendant in
10	that trial?
11	A. In fairness, to me, these trials
12	often start with many defendants, and by
13	the time it actually goes to the jury, it's
14	not everybody.
15	Q. Right. Okay. Well, in that -- be
16	it as it may, whether they were in it or
17	not, in that trial, as you told us, you did
18	talk about as part of your testimony the
19	various ways that cigarette manufacturers
20	targeted their advertising, correct?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And you used a term there several
23	times throughout your testimony which you
24	called -- alternatively either called it
25	downscaling or downshifting. Do you recall
0214
1	that?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Okay. And as I understood that
4	from reading your testimony, your
5	description of downscale or downshift
6	marketing was the cigarette manufacturers
7	targeting their marketing to parts of
8	society that were less aware of the health
9	risks of smoking. Is that --
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. Is that something you still
12	believe, that that was done?
13	A. Yes. I mean, that's a development
14	over time. And I referred to that this
15	morning.
16	And just for accuracy, I call it
17	the downscale/downshift. So it's a phrase.
18	Q. Okay.
19	A. And beginning in the late 1960s,
20	the industry as it learned more and more
21	about its customer basis, that is it
22	developed more sophisticated methods of
23	discovery in terms of social research began
24	to identify that, you know, kind of a —
25	what you mentioned, as really their
0215
1	principal market, that is, you know, people
2	who were less well educated and more
3	working class, who were less concerned
4	about their own personal health if only
5	because they had many other things to worry
6	about.
7	If you look at the beginnings of
8	cigarette marketing, say, for example, in
9	the 1920s and an earlier period than the
10	1920s, cigarettes are being put forth as a
11	much more kind of sophisticated product,
12	you know, with an appeal towards kind of
13	elite status. The implication is that
14	people would aspire to those qualities.
15	So, you know, it changes over time.
16	Q. But it's your opinion starting in
17	the late 1960s, that cigarette
18	manufacturers specifically started
19	directing their marketing to groups of
20	folks that were less educated and less
21	aware of the health risks of smoking?
22	A. Well, less aware of -- through
23	their internal marketing research, groups
24	that were less aware of the health risks of
25	smoking. Yeah.
0216
1	Q. And what is -- first, before we
2	get into the bases for that opinion and
3	which companies you're talking about, which
4	groups are you identifying as groups that
5	were less aware of the health risks of
6	smoking?
7	A. Well, that's a group in and of
8	itself.
9	Q. That group, meaning identifiable
10	group, regardless of where they came from,
11	what socioeconomic class, the group of
12	people that were less aware was a target of
13	cigarette manufacturers?
14	A. Right. And I mean they are a
15	correlate for characteristics of that
16	group, tendencies, you know. They tend to
17	have less education on average. I mean, as
18	a tendency, tend to have lower incomes.
19	You know, in 1950, "What cigarette
20	do you smoke, Doctor?" is not the appeal,
21	for example, in 1970 and as you get into
22	the '70s.
23	You know, RJ. Reynolds, for
24	example, you know, forges a marketing
25	relationship with the Grand Nationals and
0217
1	they rename the -- the NASCAR championship,
2	the Winston cup in '71, but things like
3	that.
4	Q. Is it your opinion that -- well, I
5	won't ask about that.
6	I want to ask you mainly about
7	Philip Morris. At least as I read your
8	testimony in Alexander for this issue of --
9	you said -- downscale/downshift is the term
10	that --
11	A. That's right.
12	Q. The issue of downscale/downshift
13	marketing, you focussed at least in that
14	case on the marketing of Kool cigarettes;
15	is that correct?
16	A. Yes. The Kool story was very
17	prominent in that trial.
18	Q. I want to know if you have similar
19	opinions regarding any cigarettes
20	manufactured by Philip Morris. Was there
21	any marketing strategy at Philip Morris
22	that you think fell within this
23	downscale/downshift paradigm?
24	A. Well, I think, you know, all
25	cigarette marketing shifts in that
0218
1	direction, you know, appealing to those
2	segments that are not giving up smoking to
3	the extent -- or less likely to give up
4	smoking or not to engage in the initiation
5	of smoking. So Philip Morris would be part
6	of that as well.
7	Q. Well, as I understand the
8	downscale/downshift paradigm, it's a little
9	different than what you just said. What
10	you told us originally -- and correct me if
11	I'm wrong -- was the downscale/downshift
12	paradigm was directing marketing towards
13	folks that were less aware of the health
14	risks of smoking, but you perhaps
15	inadvertently just switched that to
16	directing marketing to folks that were less
17	likely to want to give up smoking.
18	Are you saying those are the same
19	things?
20	A. Well, yeah. I kind of muddled it
21	there. Let me take another swing.
22	Q. You bet.
23	A. What's going on at this time,
24	particularly in the 1960s, is that certain
25	segments of the American population are
0219
1	dramatic -- some segments of the population
2	are either not initiating smoking at the
3	same rate or moving out of the smoking
4	category, quitting and what have you, and
5	all of this -- all of the trends, industry
6	research, you know, and for that matter,
7	public health research --1 mean, anyone
8	that's doing social survey work on this
9	realizes that, you know, by the early '70s,
10	smoking is becoming increasingly a kind of
11	working-class phenomena.
12	And so that's what I mean by the
13	downscale/downshift. And one of the
14	findings for the survey research is that,
15	well, for a variety of reasons,
16	working-class people were just less, you
17	know, aware of the effect of cigarettes on
18	their health, either that they worked hard
19	or whatever. A lot involves increasing
20	prevalence of smoking among women, and
21	particularly women in the workforce and
22	working-class positions.
23	And so all of these factors are
24	part of this kind of reconfiguration of the
25	cigarette in the late '60s and 1970s. And
0220
1	that's all I mean by that.
2	Q. And as I read your testimony in
3	Alexander -- and perhaps not being there,
4	it didn't come across like that in person,
5	but on the transcript page, it certainly
6	seemed that you were making a correlation
7	between marketing towards African-Americans
8	being some sort of marker or equivalent to
9	marketing towards folks that were less
10	aware of the health risks of smoking.
11	Is that what you meant to do?
12	A. Well, I mean, African-Americans,
13	when you break the survey data down, are --
14	tend to have lower levels of knowledge of
15	the risks of smoking, at least at this
16	particular point in time, this historical
17	period of time, which I attribute to it's
18	true of all working-class people and poorer
19	people, and you have -- you know, in terms
20	of the composition, you know, the
21	occupational composition and income
22	composition of African-American population,
23	you have a over-representation of lower
24	income people in that population than you
25	do in the general population for a variety
0221
1	of historic reasons. That's all.
2	And working-class people for a
3	variety of reasons, education, having to
4	make do with life, stressful lives, what
5	have you, seem more resistant to the
6	messages of public health education, public
7	health community, don't get the messages,
8	don't encounter them as much perhaps, you
9	know, a variety of characteristics.
10	But the phenomena of the
11	downscale/downshift, that can be very
12	apparent when you look at the way
13	cigarettes are marketed at this time, real
14	changes--
15	Q. Since our record is a little
16	muddled now, probably partly due to your
17	answers and partly due to my questions, let
18	me just ask you straight up. Explain to me
19	what is the downscale/downshift theory as
20	you use the term.
21	A. Yeah. I mean it to mean that the
22	industry begins to market the product to
23	what becomes the new core constituency of
24	the cigarette, which is, you know, more
25	working-class people, people who have less
0222
1	knowledge of the risks of smoking, people
2	who tend to have less education, less
3	income, on balance, you know, these are
4	tendencies.
5	Q. Now, in the -- before I get to
6	that, with respect to some of the
7	discussion you had earlier regarding the
8	push towards marketing menthol cigarettes,
9	do you recall discussing that?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. With regard to Philip Morris in
12	particular, would you agree with me that
13	that was not a major push of the Philip
14	Morris marketing directive?
15	A. That's true. Philip Morris not so
16	prominent in the menthol market.
17	Q. And you would agree with me also
18	that in this time period, in the late
19	1960s, that the product -- the brand that
20	Philip Morris was promoting most was the
21	Marlboro brand? Would you agree with that?
22	A. Oh, yeah. That was the flagship
23	brand.
24	Q. And the Marlboro brand is in the
25	cigarette market considered a premium
0223
1	cigarette; isn't that right?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And would you agree with me that
4	to the extent cigarettes are marketed to
5	different socioeconomic levels of society,
6	the Marlboro brand was not directed at the
7	folks that you're including in this
8	downscale/downshift group?
9	A. No. I would not agree with that
10	at all. I mean, within the product
11	category of cigarettes, Marlboro was not a
12	discount cigarette, but then the discount
13	cigarettes really only begin to become a
14	significant component of the market later
15	in the time we're talking about, '80s
16	especially, as the cost pressures some of
17	it derived by taxation and the like begin
18	to raise the price of cigarettes
19	significantly.
20	Marlboro had, you know, a very
21	macho appeal and had a broad appeal. I
22	mean, today it's, what, half of the market.
23	I think 40 or 50 percent of all cigarettes
24	are Marlboros. So it's rapidly becoming
25	the dominant brand.
0224
1	No. I mean, Philip Morris was
2	also engaging in the same activity.
3	Q. Now, I guess where you were a
4	little bit ago, you talked about -- which
5	is not surprising -- that all the cigarette
6	manufacturers at least at one core level
7	were trying to market their cigarettes to
8	the folks they thought were most likely to
9	buy them; is that fair to say?
10	A. Yes. That's fair to say.
11	Q. And as part of that, as I
12	understand it, you're telling us that the
13	cigarette companies learned that the folks
14	that were most likely to buy their
15	cigarettes were the folks that had the
16	lowest levels of awareness about the health
17	risks of cigarettes?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. And that that's where the
20	downscale/downshift -- that's where the
21	medium of those two concepts come together,
22	correct?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. So that leads me to question, do
25	you have any documents from Philip Morris
0225
1	that you can recall or you're aware of that
2	indicate to you that Philip Morris had an
3	intent to market their cigarettes to folks
4	because they believed that they were less
5	aware of the health risks of smoking?
6	A. Yeah. There's quite a bit of
7	survey research that's conducted, a lot of
8	materials by Myron Johnson, who is a
9	demographer, in the Philip Morris -- with
10	the Philip Morris company, who is beginning
11	to identify these characteristics of the
12	market. You know, he's got -- there's an
13	often-cited report called "Report on the
14	Health Cigarette," which is usually held up
15	as an example of filter issues, but if you
16	read that report, it says a great deal
17	about other aspects of the cigarette
18	market, so that would be a good example,
19	from the mid '60s, one of the early
20	identifiers of that.
21	It's also something that --1
22	mean, it's not a secret. It's something
23	that was apparent in the adult use of
24	tobacco surveys and other systematic
25	surveys that were done of the smoking
0226
1	public. You know, other people identified
2	changes, you know, in the composition of
3	the smoking population of the United
4	States.
5	Q. Right. I'm just trying to get to
6	the question of intent.
7	Is it a fair statement to say that
8	the intent of Philip Morris' sort of
9	overall marketing strategy was to market
10	its cigarettes to the people that they
11	believed were most likely to buy them?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. And as I understand your
14	downshift/downscale -- did I get those in
15	the right order?
16	A. No, but that's okay.
17	Q. Well, I'll do it again. As part
18	of your downscale/downshift paradigm, are
19	you saying that Philip Morris and the other
20	tobacco companies learned that the folks
21	that were most likely to buy their
22	cigarettes were the people that had the
23	lowest level of awareness about the health
24	risks of smoking?
25	A. Yes.
0227
1	Q. And other than the one document
2	you identified, which I believe is called,
3	"The Market Potential For a Health
4	Cigarette" -- is that the Myron Johnson
5	document you're talking about?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Other than that document, are you
8	aware of any other Philip Morris documents
9	that support that theory that you just
10	opined on?
11	A. Johnson writes about it into the
12	'70s. Yeah. There's others. They're in
13	there. I mean, it's -- they're in there
14	and in my -- you know, in my Philip Morris
15	marketing report folder on my reliance
16	documents.
17	Q. In your opinion, were there any
18	particular groups of people, whether you
19	divide it by race, gender, socioeconomic
20	class, that Philip Morris identified as
21	being less aware of the health risks of
22	smoking?
23	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. Say it
24	again. Read it back.
25	(Whereupon, the question was read
0228
1	by the reporter.)
2	A. Yeah. I mean, it --1 mean, it
3	primarily comes down to socioeconomic
4	status, which is a term of art to identify
5	income --a combination of income and
6	occupation. So as you move down the
7	socioeconomic scale, if you think of
8	society in the hierarchy of income and
9	occupational hierarchy -- because it
10	doesn't always work out right. College
11	professor being an example, low on the
12	income scale. But that's the main point.
13	And I might add as well, you know,
14	youth, you know, tend to not fully
15	comprehend the -- you know, the full impact
16	of this. One of the reasons why in that
17	document we've been talking about, Johnson
18	feels it's important to know -- survey
19	people in parks and beaches and the like
20	where young people congregate.
21	Another part of it, you know, is
22	the industry identified certain
23	psychological characteristics or social
24	characteristics -- let me rephrase,
25	psychological or personality
0229
1	characteristics which also fit into this
2	and, you know, people who are, you know --
3	I'm trying to remember exactly the language
4	they used, but people who want to be part
5	of the group, people who want -- who see
6	the comradery of the cigarette culture as
7	something that they want to belong to.
8	And so there's a whole literature
9	on that, and that tends to correspond with
10	more objective socioeconomic hierarchies.
11	It's never perfect. It's not all neat and
12	pretty. You know, it's all tendencies, and
13	it's all being derived from marketing
14	research and focus groups, which are part
15	of the -- you know, the marketing effort of
16	how the industry learns about its customer
17	base.
18	MR. BRENNER:
19	Q. And I agree with you, and that's
20	the point I'm trying to get at is that the
21	various different characteristics you just
22	talked about in the end do fall across many
23	different socioeconomic statuses, correct?
24	A. Yes. Yes. People are not in
25	discrete and separate groups. They have
0230
1	overlapping qualities as it relates to
2	this. So you're dealing with tendencies.
3	Q. It includes men and women,
4	correct?
5	A. That's right.
6	Q. It includes Caucasians and
7	African-Americans and Hispanics, correct?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. But is it fair to say at the core
10	of what's going on is that the manufacturer
11	of the product, really what they're trying
12	to identify is people that are most likely
13	to buy their product, correct?
14	A. Yes. That's --1 mean, their
15	intent is to sell their product.
16	Q. And that's who they market to or
17	direct their marketing to, the best they
18	can, that's their concept, correct?
19	A. Yeah. Yeah. We agree on that.
20	Yeah.
21	Q. Just let me follow up on a couple
22	issues that Eliot talked about, that's
23	Elliot Pedrosa.
24	Are there any particular Philip
25	Morris advertisements or even advertising
0231
1	campaigns that you have an opinion on that
2	you can say with a reasonable degree of
3	certainty had an impact on Mr. Calloway?
4	A. That's a different question.
5	Q. I didn't mean it to be the same.
6	A. Good. You catch me at the last
7	minute, late afternoon.
8	Mr. Calloway had an affinity for
9	westerns. That's mentioned. And the
10	"Marlboro Country" campaign was a very
11	powerful and evocative campaign that
12	obviously used the western motif.
13	It would be hard to sustain the
14	position that did not have an effect on
15	someone like Mr. Calloway, that it didn't
16	resonate with him at some level, I mean,
17	particularly because that "Marlboro
18	Country" becomes part of American popular
19	culture. So that would be an example.
20	Q. Before I quiz you any more on
21	that, any other examples you have?
22	A. That would be the one.
23	Q. When did Mr. Calloway smoke
24	Marlboro cigarettes?
25	A. I don't have a good handle based
0232
1	on the evidence I read as to when he smoked
2	any particular cigarettes. His daughter
3	mentions Marlboro. So certainly he was
4	smoking them in the '70s.
5	Q. You don't know for how long he
6	smoked them?
7	A. No, I don't.
8	Q. By the way, when you -- in between
9	one of the breaks, you provided a list to
10	the court reporter of the depositions you
11	reviewed, correct?
12	A. That's right.
13	Q. Now, for your understanding of the
14	factual record of this case, is that your
15	sole -- let me back up.
16	Are you relying on those
17	depositions as the sole source of
18	information for facts about Mr. Calloway?
19	A. That's all I've got. There are --
20	I was also sent the interrogatories, but
21	they didn't seem to have a lot of
22	information in them.
23	Q. For example, you're not going to
24	say, well, I read this in the deposition,
25	but the plaintiffs lawyer told me
0233
1	something else that I'm also relying on?
2	A. No. What I know is from the
3	depositions.
4	Q. From sworn testimony, family
5	members and friends?
6	A. I have no -- I'm not in the
7	possession of any non-recorded sworn
8	information about Mr. Calloway from any
9	other source.
10	Q. And because of that, it makes it
11	difficult for you to ascertain, for
12	example, when Mr. Calloway smoked any
13	particular brands of cigarettes, correct?
14	A. That's true. And I might add it's
15	-- you know, it's not that important for my
16	opinions to know that.
17	Q. Would you agree with me that if we
18	were to accept as true the testimony from
19	the fact witnesses and the family members
20	and friends you've read that Mr. Calloway
21	smoked many different brands of cigarettes
22	over the course of his lifetime?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. And can you ballpark that number
25	for me?
0234
1	A. I mean, I could count the list of
2	brands. It's a couple dozen at least.
3	Q. Let's call it 25 for now. Okay?
4	A. All right. Two dozen plus one.
5	You counted them.
6	Q. No, I haven't. Just so we can use
7	an even number.
8	Would you agree with me that if we
9	were to accept that as true, that he smoked
10	about 25 different brands of cigarettes
11	over his lifetime, that he was not a
12	particularly brand-loyal cigarette smoker?
13	A. That's true. He -- that's another
14	-- that's another marketing category that
15	the industry was concerned about, the
16	switchers and the stayers, so to speak.
17	Q. Sure. The cigarette companies in
18	the marketplace for consumers of their
19	product are fierce competitors; are they
20	not?
21	A. They are.
22	Q. And the folks at Reynolds would
23	like the folks that smoked Philip Morris
24	brand cigarettes, for example, to switch to
25	Reynolds brand cigarettes, correct?
0235
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. There's nothing wrong with that,
3	right?
4	A. That's their competition.
5	Q. But you would agree that at least
6	according to the factual record we have
7	before us, that Mr. Calloway was not overly
8	influenced by any particular cigarette
9	company's advertisement to smoke their
10	brands; is that a fair statement?
11	A. Well, you just don't really know.
12	I mean, there's two -- and I'm not going to
13	offer an opinion on that about him. But,
14	you know, you could take the evidence one
15	of two -- three ways. You could say, well,
16	maybe the guy was just extremely price
17	sensitive and was chasing the cheapest
18	cigarette, whoever had the most coupons in
19	the magazine, for example, or what was on
20	sale at the local store, or he just didn't
21	care about brands at all, which is a
22	variation of the first category, or
23	theoretically -- and I can't say why, but
24	maybe he was hypersensitive to marketing
25	and that whatever he just saw on the TV was
0236
1	what he bought the next time he was in the
2	store or read in the magazine or what have
3	you.
4	And I don't have an opinion of him
5	on any of those three. I mean, he did clip
6	the coupons, but lots of people did that.
7	So it could go any of those ways.
8	Q. You would agree that option number
9	three would be the least likely of those
10	three, wouldn't you?
11	A. They're all possible.
12	Q. You can't agree number three would
13	be the least likely?
14	A. The least likely? I'm not going
15	to offer an opinion on that and -- and so
16	--of those three possibilities --
17	Q. Well, let me -
18	A. Maybe price sensitivity, maybe
19	marketing -- these all mix together in the
20	mind of the -- of the consumer in ways that
21	from this evidentiary record are too
22	complex for me to tease out and disentangle
23	and offer the jury one opinion.
24	Q. And that's fair. I appreciate
25	you're not going to offer an opinion
0237
1	between those three different options, but
2	let me make sure I also know what you're
3	not offering an opinion on.
4	Is it fair to say you're not going
5	to offer an opinion that Johnnie Calloway
6	smoked any particular brand of cigarettes
7	because of advertisement for those
8	cigarettes?
9	A. Okay. Now that's a different
10	question.
11	Q. Yes, it is. That's why I said it
12	was a different one.
13	A. Yes.
14	Well, I do think the advertising
15	really matters. The advertising matters
16	historically for building the market, in
17	the period of growth in the cigarette
18	market, and then sustaining the market once
19	it reaches its maturity, and it also
20	matters to you guys, brand share, market
21	share particular brands. Both operate--
22	both are functions of industry marketing.
23	To the extent that there was lots
24	of marketing for cigarettes and that Mr.
25	Calloway was buying cigarettes, I mean,
0238
1	he's -- at some degree, he's influenced by
2	the marketing.
3	Q. And my question was imprecise at
4	best. I'm just trying to tease out the two
5	things.
6	I understand you have an opinion,
7	which you've given many times, including
8	today, that cigarette advertising in
9	general had an impact on the population in
10	general and their decisions about smoking
11	or not smoking.
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. And I'm not questioning you about
14	that. I understand that's your opinion.
15	A. Okay.
16	Q. My question was a bit more narrow,
17	which is do you have an opinion in this
18	case whether cigarette advertising impacted
19	--are you going to offer an opinion
20	whether cigarette advertisement impacted
21	Mr. Calloway's choice of brands in this
22	case?
23	A. His choice of brands? Given the
24	difficulty in ascertaining what his brands
25	were at any particular time, I don't feel
0239
1	comfortable offering that kind of opinion
2	in this case. I have in other cases. The
3	record is -- because we're separated by
4	time --1 mean, he's been dead for almost
5	two decades. There isn't as clear a brand
6	history as in some other cases where I
7	could follow the history. So I'm not going
8	to go --1 don't feel comfortable going
9	there for this case.
10	I think the way you first phrased
11	it as a general proposition, I will make
12	that statement, but not -- not like on a
13	point-by-point basis and instead will
14	probably present the full spectrum of
15	cigarette advertising for the jury to
16	consider.
17	Q. Do you have an understanding --1
18	appreciate that. I was trying to segregate
19	the two different concepts, and I think
20	you've given that opinion in other cases,
21	but I wanted to segregate it here.
22	Do you have an understanding as to
23	if Mr. Calloway smoked full-flavored
24	cigarettes at any point after he smoked
25	light cigarettes?
0240
1	A. No. I mean, that doesn't --1
2	mean, the light cigarette issue is a
3	different issue from brand. That's a type
4	of cigarette. And I think, you know,
5	there's evidence of his shift there, like
6	we talked about earlier. Whether he went
7	back to full-flavored and varied between
8	one type or the other is not significant to
9	me. That doesn't matter to me.
10	Q. Why does his switch to light
11	cigarettes matter to you, then?
12	A. Well, like most --1 mean, the
13	evidence -- at least if we take the
14	testimony of his daughter, Ms. Williams,
15	like most people, he turned to light
16	cigarettes out of health concerns, the
17	belief that this was a safer product or a
18	safe product. You know, that doesn't close
19	the door to other factors shifting a smoker
20	back to other brands and then back again.
21	You know, the -- the evidence
22	doesn't support -- the evidence just isn't
23	there for this, but, you know, it's
24	perfectly reasonable to see a smoker
25	struggling between -- attention between
0241
1	wanting to smoke what they perceive as a
2	healthier brand, maybe a light cigarette,
3	but then, you know, the insistence of their
4	brain chemistry for nicotine that may not
5	be satisfied by the light cigarettes.
6	There's lots of variations that
7	are theoretically possible there that would
8	explain moving between those two product
9	categories. I don't have evidence for that
10	in this case. That's nothing I've really
11	ever testified about, but that's certainly
12	within the realm of possibility.
13	Q. Can I see the little part of Ms.
14	Williams' testimony you relied on? I think
15	it's page 54, maybe, 5 through 9; is that
16	right?
17	A. Yeah. Here you go.
18	Q. Thank you. It's not 54, 5 through
19	9.
20	MR. PEDROSA: It's 55.
21	MR. BRENNER: Okay. Let me check
22	that out. Let me just review my notes for
23	a second.
24	MR. BRENNER:
25	Q. The downscale/downshift concept,
0242
1	is that a term of art that you found in any
2	tobacco company documents, or is it a
3	Professor Kyriakoudes term of art, or is it
4	something else?
5	A. It's the second option.
6	Q. Professor Kyriakoudes term of art?
7	A. Yes.
8	MR. BRENNER: Okay. I think
9	that's all I have.
10	MR. SEBOLD: Does anybody on the
11	phone have questions? I have a few
12	follow-up questions, which we can do at any
13	time, but if people on the phone --1 don't
14	know if there's anybody else that wants to
15	ask questions.
16	MS. FISCHER: This Julie Fischer
17	for Liggett. I have a few questions.
18	MR. SEBOLD: You're up.
19	EXAMINATION
20	BY MS. FISCHER:
21	Q. Hi, Dr. Kyriakoudes. I'm Julie
22	Fischer for Liggett, and I should be
23	briefer than anyone.
24	Similar questions to what
25	Lorillard has, have there been any changes
0243
1	in your opinions since the last time you
2	testified in depositions with respect to
3	Liggett?
4	A. No.
5	Q. Can you hear me, Dr. Kyriakoudes?
6	A. I can. I can hear you fine. My
7	answer was no. Can you hear me?
8	Q. I couldn't hear you. I'm sorry.
9	A. Okay.
10	Q. Do you intend to use any internal
11	Liggett documents?
12	A. Do I intend to use any internal
13	Liggett documents? As I sit here, I had
14	not intended to use any Liggett documents.
15	None come to mind.
16	Q. Okay. What about any Liggett ads?
17	A. Yeah, maybe some -- yeah, some
18	Liggett ads. I like Liggett ads. I used
19	some in the past.
20	Q. Can you describe which one?
21	A. "Just what the doctor ordered."
22	Q. Any others?
23	A. "Will not harm nose, throat or
24	accessory organs." And anything with Dr.
25	Darkus, Rosalyn Russell.
0244
1	Q. Okay. Okay. And do you have any
2	specific opinions with respect to Liggett's
3	marketing to the African-American
4	community?
5	A. I don't.
6	MS. FISCHER: Okay. That's all my
7	questions. Thank you.
8	MR. SEBOLD: Anybody else on the
9	defense side that has questions? Is that
10	our whole group?
11	MR. PEDROSA: I'm going to have a
12	couple follow-ups.
13	EXAMINATION
14	BY MR. SEBOLD:
15	Q. Doctor, I have a few follow-up
16	questions.
17	Mr. Pedrosa asked you some
18	questions about whether you evaluated ads
19	to see whether they were true or false at
20	the time they were made. Do you remember
21	those questions?
22	A. Yes. Yes.
23	Q. Okay. And I think your testimony
24	was that's not an exercise that you've
25	engaged in, you haven't evaluated the truth
0245
1	or falsity of any particular ads; is that
2	correct?
3	A. Well, yeah. I mean, some ads,
4	like, "Will not harm, nose, throat or
5	accessory organs," well, that's not true,
6	is it? Chesterfield's will, in fact, harm
7	the nose, throat and especially the
8	accessory organs.
9	Q. Well, at the time they were made,
10	was there any indication that somebody knew
11	that that particular statement was false?
12	A. I think in 1955, yes, there was
13	ample information that Chesterfield's would
14	harm nose, throat or accessory organs.
15	What I -- what I was explaining to
16	Mr. Pedrosa during the direct examination
17	was -- or his questions was that, you know,
18	in my prior testimony, I presented the ads
19	as examples of messages by the industry to
20	communicate to the public what the product
21	does, what it is, what it isn't, how to use
22	the product, for example, and that's an
23	important function of the advertising, and
24	I haven't in my direct examination before
25	iuries made much as to whether they were
0246
1	true or not.
2	I believe that's what the import
3	of that line of questioning was. I mean,
4	some of the ads --
5	Q. So~
6	A. Well, I mean, you know, the ads
7	are -- all cigarette ads are not true in
8	the sense that no ad shows -- that I've
9	ever seen by a cigarette company showed the
10	outcome of a career of smoking, you know,
11	somebody's in poor health and wishing that
12	they had not smoked and wishing that they
13	weren't sick.
14	So in that regard, all of the ads
15	are deceptive, but that's -- you know, when
16	I've presented it to the jury, I've usually
17	used the ads as an example in ways which
18	the industry has communicated to the client
19	base.
20	Q. So in other words -- okay. I
21	can't go through your prior testimony and
22	see any evaluations that you've done of the
23	truth or falsity of any ads; is that
24	accurate?
25	A. Yeah. I mean, I don't put up ads
0247
1	and say this is a false ad, this is a true
2	ad and offer some elaborate analysis. I
3	mean, it's --1 put them up as examples of
4	what the industry has said.
5	Q. Do you intend to testify on the
6	truth and falsity of any ads in this
7	particular case?
8	A. Well, I mean, if somebody asks me,
9	Dr. Kyriakoudes, is it true based on what
10	you know about what the tobacco executives
11	understood as to be the risks of smoking in
12	the 1950s, is it true that Chesterfields
13	would not harm nose, throat or accessory
14	organs, I would have to say that it was not
15	true.
16	So, I mean, you know, I've never
17	been asked that question.
18	Q. For purposes of what you propose
19	to testify about in this case, have you
20	been asked to evaluate the truth and
21	falsity of any ads?
22	A. No. I've not been asked to engage
23	in that activity.
24	Q. All right. And I believe you said
25	that there was a contrary narrative to the
0248
I	tobacco --
2	A. Counter-narrative.
3	Q. Counter-narrative. All right.
4	Tell me the general pieces of that
5	counter-narrative.
6	A. Sure. Well, there is -- in fact,
7	there always -- just about always has been
8	first an anti-tobacco component to American
9	life. We'll just stick with the 19th and
10	20th centuries.
II	You know, there was an
12	anti-cigarette movement, which I'm sure
13	you're familiar with as the anti-cigarette
14	league, the very late and early 20th
15	century that passes by the wayside as
16	cigarettes become a fully mainstream
17	product and as the market for cigarettes
18	explodes over the course of the first half
19	of the 20th century.
20	Once the health crisis begins to
21	have an impact -- when I say health crisis,
22	I mean the publicity -- publicizing of the
23	science implicating cigarettes with disease
24	begins in the late '40s and early '50s.
25	Once that happens, you do get a movement
0249
1	among scientists, public health operatives
2	and their allies in the press and other
3	medias to counteract cigarette marketing
4	and messages of the industry and persuade
5	people not to smoke.
6	And that's part of the history as
7	well. In fact, it's often a history that
8	defense experts focus on in their testimony
9	based on my prior reading. So that's what
10	I meant by the counter-narrative.
11	Q. And that would include public
12	health announcements like we talked about
13	before?
14	A. Yes. Public health announcements,
15	those components of government that were
16	charged with protecting the public's health
17	and awareness of the risks of smoking,
18	educating the public.
19	Q. And you've told us before that you
20	try to give the whole story, I think you
21	said, right?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. If I look in any of your little
24	folders that are on Exhibit 2, will I find
25	any counter-narrative folders or materials?
0250
1	A. I don't call it that. I mean,
2	it's not named that. But if you look in my
3	reliance list here, you know, yeah, there's
4	quite a bit of material in here.
5	Mostly things from the media, you
6	know, "Cancer of the Lung," News Week;
7	"Cancer & Horror," Time, 1954; news
8	broadcasts; "Cigarettes: Do They or Don't
9	They?" Newsweek; "Cigarettes on Trial
10	Again" and "Cigarettes Get It Again,"
11	Business Week.
12	Q. So it may be listed in your
13	reliance materials, but there's not a
14	particular folder that I can go to; is that
15	fair to say?
16	A. Yeah. Well, "I Quit Smoking or
17	Cooper's Last Stand."
18	Q. How about public health
19	announcements, do you have those listed in
20	your reliance materials?
21	A. Well, I have the -- you know, the
22	Surgeon General's reports.
23	When you say public health
24	announcements, do you really mean the
25	public service announcements that were
0251
1	broadcasted on TV ?
2	Q. Sure.
3	A. I don't have those listed, but
4	I've looked at those. And I've often
5	testified about the Fairness Doctrine, for
6	example, an important period of time where
7	there were large number of very effective
8	public health announcements related to
9	smoking.
10	Q. And have you evaluated the
11	effectiveness of the counter-narrative?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. And have you testified on that in
14	various trials?
15	A. Yes, I have.
16	Q. Was there any counter-narrative
17	that was directed to smoking in the
18	African-American population?
19	A. That was strictly within the
20	African-American population?
21	Q. That was focussed on the
22	African-American population.
23	A. I mean, yeah, public health
24	education efforts reached out to
25	African-Americans as well. I mean, there's
0252
1	an interesting symmetry to the segmented
2	marketing of the industry. You know,
3	public health education efforts over time
4	grow more effective. So by the 1980s and
5	the 1990s, you have a number of groups
6	reaching out to African-American smokers in
7	that community, again, trying to spread
8	public health information and awareness
9	and --
10	Q. And are those -- I'm sorry. And
11	are those public health and advocacy
12	materials that are targeted to the
13	African-American population reflected in
14	your reliance materials anywhere?
15	A. No. They're not. I know about
16	them and they're -- they're important.
17	They're a part of the story.
18	Q. Okay. Well, if you want to tell
19	the whole story and I want to know the
20	whole story, where can I find those types
21	of public health counter-narrative
22	materials that are targeted to the
23	African-American population if they're not
24	reflected in your reliance materials?
25	A. You know, it's a big story.
0253
1	There's a lot of material. You know,
2	that's --1 mean, that's part of the
3	history.
4	Q. I agree, but I can't find those in
5	your reliance materials, is that correct,
6	public health counter-narrative materials
7	directed to the African-American
8	population?
9	A. That's correct. I haven't, you
10	know, saved those and collected them and
11	put them in as part of this set.
12	Q. Okay. And for purposes of this
13	case, where you've told us you might talk
14	about African-American marketing, have you
15	tried to tune up your knowledge as to the
16	counter-narrative in relationship to the
17	African-American population?
18	A. Well, for the time period under
19	consideration here, I mean, my knowledge is
20	tuned. I don't need a tune-up. That's an
21	interesting metaphor. I know what I know.
22	You know, this isn't like a
23	medical diagnosis where there's a set
24	amount of documents. My knowledge is a bit
25	larger than the documents I manage to put
0254
1	onto these lists and disks and the like.
2	Q. I know, but I want to get the
3	whole story, and so I'm trying to
4	understand that from your reliance
5	materials where I can get the whole story
6	as to the counter-narrative particularly as
7	it relates to the African-American
8	population.
9	And what I understand is it exists
10	out there, but it's not reflected in your
11	reliance materials?
12	A. Right. It's a much more recent
13	phenomena, in the last 20 years especially.
14	At some point, things become current events
15	and cease to be history.
16	Q. Well, is that where you bow out in
17	terms of your knowledge? Are you a
18	historian or a current-events guy?
19	A. I'm a historian.
20	Q. So if it crosses into current
21	events, do you bow out then?
22	A. Well, I mean, I keep up on tobacco
23	control, and I read in that area and do my
24	best to keep up on the trends, but in terms
25	of my professional research, I am a
0255
1	historian.
2	Q. And this may be a graduate level
3	seminar question, but where do you cross
4	the line from history to current events?
5	How far back in time do you go to be a
6	current events versus history?
7	A. You know, if you look at my
8	testimony, with just a few notable
9	exceptions, usually my testimony stops in
10	1994. Usually end ends with the Waxman
11	hearings.
12	Occasionally, I've been asked
13	about some Philip Morris' anti-smoking
14	pamphlets from the earliest years of this
15	century, but, you know -- for example, I've
16	been asked many questions even in
17	depositions about current aspects relating
18	to the current Family Smoking Prevention
19	Act. I might have that mangled. And I'm
20	not up on all the aspects of that current
21	legislation. I know about it. I read
22	about it. I'm trying to keep up, but
23	that's not something I made a study of.
24	Q. Mr. Pedrosa asked you questions
25	about research that you did on advertising
0256
1	in various periods of time as it relates to
2	Mr. Calloway.
3	I think you said that kind of --
4	you were looking at his early years because
5	you typically sort of front-load your
6	analysis; is that right?
7	A. Well, I -- you know, right. I
8	think it -- for my research interests or my
9	research -- the research questions that are
10	relevant here or the questions that are
11	relevant here, it's important to know the
12	context as much as possible in terms of
13	types of products and development of a
14	smoking culture or information, as much as
15	one can know, the point of likely smoking
16	initiation in early adulthood. The vast
17	preponderance of people develop their
18	smoking practices as adolescents, late
19	adolescents, early adults.
20	Q. Doesn't that suggest, then, if
21	you're true in that analysis or assumption
22	that advertising after that doesn't really
23	matter?
24	A. Well, I think a lot of the
25	function of the advertising after that, a
0257
1	lot of the industry public relations
2	campaigns really are geared towards
3	persuading people not to quit. So, yeah,
4	there is a different function there.
5	There's a different function there.
6	Q. In terms of the historical
7	research -- and we talked about this before
8	--in terms of placing him in time, you
9	looked at those Hattiesburg materials that
10	are in Exhibit 3, but that's really the
11	only Calloway-specific work you've done,
12	right?
13	A. That's correct.
14	Q. There's some materials I noticed
15	in your Exhibit 5, "The Cigarette
16	Epidemic." Have you studied cigarette
17	advertising in any foreign countries?
18	A. A little bit. Yes.
19	Q. Let's say in China, are cigarettes
20	advertised in China?
21	A. Yes, they are.
22	Q. And how are they advertised, like
23	in what forms of the media?
24	A. They're advertised in Chinese
25	magazines, billboards.
0258
1	Q. And do you know -- I'm using China
2	as an example. Do you know whether the
3	advertising for cigarettes there in the
4	2000 time frame is more or less prevalent
5	than it is in the United States?
6	A. That's hard for me to say. I
7	really can't say.
8	Q. Have you done any comparative
9	analysis of prevalence of advertising of
10	tobacco products in foreign countries
11	versus the U.S.?
12	A. No. I've not engaged in that
13	explicit comparative analysis.
14	Q. Let's talk about smoking
15	prevalence for a minute, and let's use
16	American males. Do you know what the
17	prevalence of smoking was of American males
18	in the 1960s?
19	A. Yeah. At the peak -- and, you
20	know, I might be off by a percentage or two
21	or three -- approximately of all males, 56,
22	57 percent did, over half.
23	Q. In the 1960s?
24	A. Yeah. Mid '60s.
25	Q. And it's declined over time?
0259
1	A. It has. Yes.
2	Q. What was it in the'70s? Do you
3	have a ballpark?
4	A. I mean, I'd have to look that
5	figure up. I think it --1 think by the
6	1980s, it's 30 percent. I don't know the
7	70s. But there's a standard reference
8	work on this that I can just look that up.
9	Q. By the early '90s, what's the
10	prevalence of smoking among the American
11	male population?
12	A. About a third, 30 percent, a
13	little bit over 30 percent.
14	Q. Okay.
15	A. It's about a fifth now, a little
16	bit over a fifth.
17	Q. I think -- although you've
18	corrected me several times when I thought I
19	understood what you said. I think you said
20	you haven't done a formal correlation
21	between advertising and cigarette smoking
22	prevalence; is that correct?
23	A. Well, yeah. That is, you know,
24	run a, you know, analysis between
25	expenditures on advertising and smoking
0260
1	prevalence. Right.
2	Q. As an example, that's not
3	something that you've done?
4	A. No. That's actually statistically
5	an extremely difficult procedure because
6	you're dealing with time series trends that
7	almost defy what these standard analytical
8	techniques were designed to measure, and
9	that is smoking prevalence is a complex
10	phenomena that enters -- has plateaus in
11	the mid '60s and then begins to decline in
12	the 1970s with some variation. Industry
13	marketing expenditures increase.
14	So what you've got, in essence, is
15	a situation where the industry is trying to
16	shore up what becomes after 1982 a market
17	that is shrinking.
18	Q. So if you were to look at it just
19	purely in knowledge and sense terms,
20	expenditures are going up, but prevalence
21	is going down?
22	A. That's right.
23	And so the issue, then, is without
24	the -- without those expenditures, would
25	prevalence have fallen even farther -- and
0261
1	because you've entered a new phase. If you
2	defined the history of the cigarette in the
3	20th century in two phases, growth phase --
4	three phases, stability phase and the
5	decline phase, and we're in the decline,
6	different companies have taken different
7	approaches to that.
8	Q. And I think you said one of the
9	reasons you haven't done that type of
10	regression analysis is that it's too
11	multifactorial, correct?
12	A. Yes. It's too complex. People
13	have tried it. I mean, there's an
14	econometric literature with this, and
15	generally I think it's a case where the
16	methods are not adequate to the
17	questioning.
18	Q. And you told us I think you had
19	some training in statistics. Have you
20	applied any statistical analysis to any of
21	the data that's in your reliance materials?
22	A. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've
23	cross-tabbed and things like that,
24	significance testing. Yes, I have.
25	Q. Significance testing of?
0262
1	A. Polls.
2	Q. Okay. But in terms of conducting
3	your own statistical analysis, have you
4	done your own statistical analysis on any
5	of the data here to try to determine
6	whether there is a relationship between
7	advertising and consumer behavior?
8	A. Well, on that particular issue,
9	no, for the reasons that I said. But, you
10	know, I manipulate my own polling data.
11	You know, I don't just rely on the printed
12	polls. The results, I get the raw data and
13	run it through my own analysis. That would
14	be an example there.
15	Q. Okay. But in terms of conducting
16	statistical analysis on this causal
17	relationship question, you haven't done
18	that because you believe it's too complex
19	and doesn't lead to results; is that
20	correct?
21	A. Well, let me put it a little bit
22	differently. I think the methods are --
23	from my reading of, for example, the
24	econometric literature -- and these
25	articles are on that disk under articles.
0263
1	The econometric literature is pretty clear
2	to me that the methods, the statistical
3	methods cannot give a reliable result for
4	the reasons I described. That is, you
5	know, you've got, you know, a market that's
6	in long-term decline after the peak of
7	sales I think in '82.
8	And so, in essence, you're asking
9	statistics to deal with a hypothetical,
10	which is to what degree is it resisting
11	even further erosion in the market, and
12	that's, in essence, what really happens
13	with, you know, the industry's efforts to
14	block or to counter the emerging science of
15	smoking and health.
16	I mean, they delay -- and you can
17	argue about when and how much, but they
18	delay basically the tipping point whereby
19	fewer and fewer people pick up smoking.
20	Q. You talk about methods as a
21	historian. What training do you have as a
22	historian in determining whether
23	advertising has a causal impact on consumer
24	behavior?
25	A. Well, again, in the ways that I
0264
1	described earlier. I went in great detail
2	about that. I'm not a professor of
3	marketing. I'm not going to evaluate a
4	contemporary marketing campaign for
5	somebody. I look at advertising as a
6	historical phenomena and as an expression
7	of social and cultural history and
8	advertisement, a form of communication to
9	the public by the advertiser and engage in,
10	you know, a complex interaction with the
11	buying public.
12	And it's a complex interaction
13	because the advertisements, particularly in
14	the modem period, '50s and onward, are the
15	product of careful research and lots of
16	thought on the part of advertisement and
17	marketing representatives.
18	Q. I'm sorry. I may have asked you
19	this before, but in terms of evaluating
20	whether advertising has a causal impact on
21	consumer behavior, have you evaluated that
22	in any other context other than tobacco
23	advertising?
24	A. No. That keeps me busy.
25	Q. Haven't done that as an academic
0265
1	pursuit?
2	A. For tobacco?
3	Q. Right. I'm saying outside
4	tobacco, you haven't engaged in an academic
5	pursuit of evaluating whether advertising
6	has a causal impact on consumer behavior,
7	correct?
8	A. That's correct. I deal just with
9	the history of tobacco advertising and
10	marketing.
11	Q. And you may have been asked this
12	question in earlier depositions, but how
13	much have you earned working with
14	tobacco-related litigation?
15	A. In the now 14 years that I've --
16	13 years or so I've participated in this,
17	approximately 220 to 230 thousand dollars.
18	That's my guess. I don't keep a running
19	track.
20	Q. When did -- in the 1960s and
21	1970s, did tobacco companies typically
22	advertise on the basis of price?
23	A. Not so much in the 1960s. More in
24	the '70s and especially in the 1980s. The
25	exception being, you know -- when you said
0266
1	price, I interpret that to mean the
2	segmentation of the product categories into
3	discount, budget brand of cigarettes, say,
4	for example, today what Pall Mall -- Pall
5	Mall was a premium brand. Now it's a
6	discount brand, Merit, Doral, Misty.
7	That's a more -- that's something really
8	developed in the '70s and the '80s.
9	But the coupon -- you know, the
10	coupons in the bag, catalog items, stuff
11	like that, that has a long history. That
12	goes back to the beginning of cigarettes.
13	So it depends what you mean by price. I
14	mean, both are I guess price oriented.
15	Philip Morris, you know, used to
16	-- during the Depression, they were a --
17	they sold their cigarettes for a little bit
18	less, the Philip Morris brand. So they
19	were a price-competitive brand for awhile.
20	It's a big story and more complex
21	than your question suggests.
22	Q. I want to give you a hypothetical
23	and have you apply your methodology to it,
24	okay, your methodology to determine or
25	evaluate whether advertising has some kind
0267
1	of causal impact on behavior.
2	Here's the hypothetical. It's not
3	necessarily true. Assume for the minute
4	that I like to drink beer. Assume that I
5	like to watch a lot of sporting events.
6	Assume, which I think is true, that beer is
7	frequently advertised in sporting events.
8	Some people might even say it's pervasive
9	advertising. Also assume that -- and I'm
10	not sure where else beer is advertised, but
11	maybe in magazines. Assume I like to read
12	magazines with a lot of beer commercials in
13	it.
14	All right. Now, apply your
15	methodology to determine whether beer
16	advertising has a causal impact on me and
17	whether I drink a particular brand or
18	whether I drink more beer because I've seen
19	it advertised.
20	MS. GOTTLIEB: Object to the form.
21	A. Well, again, for you as an
22	individual or for that matter Mr. Calloway,
23	I'm not going to put a particular ad and do
24	like a psychology of it. That's not my
25	area.
0268
1	MR. SEBOLD:
2	Q. Just to be clear, it's pervasive.
3	It's out there. It's not whether I saw one
4	ad. I mean, I'm watching probably too much
5	sports, and every time I turn it on,
6	there's a beer ad.
7	A. Well, I think your example is a
8	good one because, you know, beer
9	advertising is now -- if you're an
10	advertising agency and you pick up a major
11	beer client, like Budweiser or Miller, you
12	know, that is the mark of real success for
13	your agency.
14	And there was a time when that
15	role was fulfilled by a cigarette company.
16	For example, Bruce Barton, head of --1
17	forget what the initials were, but one of
18	the major -- still in business. They
19	picked up the Lucky Strike campaign after
20	World War II, and the congratulatory
21	letters fill a huge file --
22	Q. And that's all well and good, but
23	apply the methodology now and determine
24	whether that advertising, pervasive as it
25	may be, has had a causal impact on my beer
0269
1	drinking behavior.
2	A. Well, it's had a causal impact on
3	the amount of beer that -- that beer
4	companies sell. You know, I mean,
5	Budweiser has very effective advertising.
6	Miller has very effective advertising.
7	Schlitz, not so much. You know, that's --
8	that's it right there. It's also --1
9	mean, I've not done an analysis of the beer
10	market, and many things -- just like with
11	smoking, many things affect prevalence, as
12	we talked about multifactorial things, but
13	certainly one thing that affects the total
14	market for beer is the way which it's
15	advertised.
16	The advertising helps grow the
17	market, but it also helps prevent erosion
18	of the market in the face of other social
19	trends, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, you
20	know, social attitudes towards sobriety,
21	for example, and social sanctions --
22	college sanctions against binge drinking
23	and all the other things that are part of
24	our current attitude towards alcohol.
25	And so it's the same with
0270
1	cigarette advertising, which makes it so
2	unamenable. It's a fairly linear based --
3	linear relationship between a set of
4	variables that --
5	Q. It's all out there. We
6	acknowledge that there's beer advertising
7	and things are happening, but how do you
8	determine whether it's had any impact on my
9	behavior?
10	MS. GOTTLIEB: Object to the form
11	of this whole line of questioning.
12	A. Well, I can't answer that
13	question. I don't know how to do that, and
14	I don't know how to do that for Mr.
15	Calloway or any other plaintiff. That's
16	why I say I can't put a particular ad in
17	Mr. Calloway's hand.
18	Now you've entered the realm of
19	psychology, and the methods that I use
20	don't work. My methods are for
21	understanding a broad social phenomena over
22	time and change over time --
23	MR. SEBOLD:
24	Q. Part of the reason why you can't
25	answer it for me is because it is
0271
1	multifactorial, right?
2	MS. GOTTLIEB: Object to the form.
3	A. Well, yes. It also involves you
4	as an individual as opposed to groups of
5	people. Group behavior is different than
6	individual behavior. That's why I'm not
7	the biographer for any particular
8	plaintiff.
9	It involves things like psychology
10	and particularly kind of historical
11	individualistic traits. Understanding
12	group behavior and how that changes over
13	time, on the other hand, is what I can do
14	with advertising.
15	MR. SEBOLD:
16	Q. But just knowing the advertising,
17	you don't know anything about why I started
18	to drink beer, do you?
19	A. Well, I could interview you, learn
20	your individual circumstances.
21	A hypothetical you say, well, we
22	used to hang out after school and we would
23	sneak in and whatever. You know, let's say
24	you were a teenager, and when I went to
25	college, I was 18, and that's what -- you
0272
I	know, it could have been anything and --
2	Q. And why I keep drinking could be
3	multifactorial, too, right? Could be
4	advertising, could be I enjoy the taste,
5	could be peer pressure. I mean, there's a
6	variety of reasons why I might continue
7	to --
8	A. Well, one of the things --
9	Q. Do you agree with that, that why I
10	continue to drink beer is multifactorial as
II	well?
12	A. Sure. Yes. And we talked about
13	that this morning. I mean, it's not --
14	advertising is not the sole cause of any
15	particular human behavior, but what
16	advertising does, both in the case of beer
17	and in the history of cigarette
18	advertising, is it creates an environment
19	where the product is seen as normal,
20	acceptable, socially desirable, personally
21	desirable, pleasurable thing to do. The
22	advertising helps break down the social
23	sanctions against both drinking beer and
24	smoking cigarettes, two activities which in
25	American history have at certain periods of
0273
1	time been strongly frowned upon and, in
2	deed, even illegal.
3	And so advertising works to shape
4	the culture so that the product's use is
5	acceptable, and the product is a normalized
6	and legitimate product. That's why one of
7	the things about -- one of the strategies
8	of tobacco control is so called
9	demoralization of the industry and its
10	products as a contemporary tobacco --
11	Q. That would be a current event?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. In the Alexander case that you
14	mentioned, do you know how that came out,
15	in terms of verdict?
16	A. I think they got a plaintiffs
17	verdict, but I don't know any more than
18	that.
19	MS. GOTTLIEB: Sorry to interrupt.
20	I just want to make sure you guys are
21	hearing me. I know we were having a
22	problem with the phone line earlier.
23	MR. BRENNER: Have you been
24	objecting?
25	MS. GOTTLIEB: Yes.
0274
1	(Off the record.)
2	MR. SEBOLD: Doctor, I don't have
3	any further questions for you.
4	EXAMINATION
5	BY MR. PEDROSA:
6	Q. Professor, you mentioned in
7	response to one of Mr. Brenner's questions
8	having looked at some polling data
9	regarding the level of awareness of risks
10	of health effects from cigarette smoking
11	among African-Americans, and I just wanted
12	to find out what's the earliest polling
13	you've seen that actually is broken down
14	demographically by race in terms of
15	awareness of risks from smoking?
16	A. For me, the stuff I've seen that I
17	can bring to mind would be '64 and '66, the
18	adult use of tobacco polls, called HEW
19	polls, which are on my disk, and you might
20	be familiar it.
21	Q. '64 and '65, those are broken down
22	by the race of the persons who are
23	respondents to the poll?
24	A. I believe so. Yeah. I think they
25	were taken in '64 and then again in '66,
0275
1	published in '69.
2	Q. And is it true that from that
3	point onwards, there is polling data
4	available on regular or some irregular
5	intervals that is broken down by race?
6	A. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that has
7	been a research question that people have
8	engaged in. Yes.
9	Q. Mr. Brenner asked you a question
10	which drew a distinction by you as
11	questions I had asked you, and I thought
12	his question was quite good. So I want to
13	ask you the same question with respect to
14	Lorillard. So here it goes. Hopefully I
15	got it down right.
16	Were there -- are you going to
17	give an opinion that there were any
18	particular Lorillard advertisements or
19	advertising campaigns that had a particular
20	impact on Johnnie Calloway?
21	A. As an individual, no, I'm not.
22	Q. You gave some explanation about
23	the fact that he liked westerns and how
24	that might cause him to have an interest in
25	some of the Marlboro advertisements. Any
0276
1	connections like that that you draw between
2	something specific that you know about Mr.
3	Calloway and something that appeared in a
4	Lorillard advertisement or advertising
5	campaign?
6	A. I don't have something like that
7	for Lorillard in mind.
8	Q. Mr. Sebold asked you some
9	questions about price competition and
10	advertising related to price, and you
11	talked about coupons and the fact that
12	coupons go back to the beginning of the
13	cigarette story.
14	My question to you is you agree
15	that cigarette companies did not invent the
16	concept of coupons, correct?
17	A. No, I'm not aware that they did.
18	That's a common device.
19	Q. Are you planning on giving any
20	opinions that make a value or normative
21	judgment about the use of coupons by
22	cigarette companies?
23	A. No. I mean, I think I follow what
24	you mean. No. The function of coupons is
25	it's just another form of advertising.
0277
1	Q. And another form of price
2	promotion?
3	A. Price promotion and marketing.
4	Yes.
5	Q. Neither good nor bad, just is?
6	A. Yeah, just is.
7	Q. What about with respect to
8	sampling, giving out free samples. I know
9	you testified in your generic deposition
10	for the Engle cases the fact of sampling.
11	Do you plan to give any opinions about
12	sampling that are specific to this case?
13	A. Well, sampling was, you know, a
14	practice that the industry engaged in. I
15	would give the same testimony. I don't
16	have any specific information about
17	sampling from this case that makes it any
18	different than other cases. I mean,
19	there's no testimony that I saw about free
20	cigarettes being handed out.
21	So it would just be that sampling
22	was a part of the way in which the industry
23	sought to build their business.
24	Q. I read another transcript of one
25	of your depositions. I think it might have
0278
1	been in the Perry case, where you talked
2	about sampling on college campuses, and you
3	drew the distinction from Alexander because
4	you said the plaintiff in Alexander didn't
5	go to college, so you didn't talk about
6	that, but in Perry, the plaintiff did, so
7	you were going to talk about that.
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. Is there anything specific about
10	the Calloway case that's going to lead you
11	to give any opinions with regard to
12	sampling?
13	A. No. In the Perry case, there was
14	testimony of sampling at a particular
15	college in Florida, and, in fact, there was
16	documentary evidence in the files of the
17	industry to support that sampling -- the
18	document, we give away cigarettes at this
19	college. I don't have something like that
20	in this case.
21	Again, you know, cigarettes were
22	part of military ration. They were given
23	out on airplanes and other public places.
24	That was a common marketing activity. But
25	nothing special or unique to this case that
0279
1	I've encountered.
2	Q. I take it, Professor, you're not
3	planning on giving any opinions in this
4	case that are specific to sampling
5	practices or projects by Lorillard?
6	A. No. I have no independent -- you
7	know, I don't have anything special to this
8	case with Lorillard.
9	Q. And last question, Exhibit 9 I
10	believe is a coupon that you pulled out
11	from Ebony magazine for Kool. Are you
12	planning on using any Lorillard coupons for
13	illustrative purposes or otherwise in --
14	A. Right. Newport did -- also put
15	coupons in Ebony magazine. Will I use
16	those? I don't know. If I do, I'll let
17	you know. But they are in the files. I've
18	seen them -- the files of the industry
19	records. I have seen them.
20	Q. But aside from possibly saying
21	here's an example of a coupon, do you plan
22	to give any testimony or opinions about any
23	coupons for Lorillard brands, Newport or
24	any other brands in this case?
25	A. Well, just that they engage in
0280
1	that practice.
2	Q. But other than that, no other
3	opinions that you plan to give about
4	coupons?
5	A. No. Just that they existed.
6	Just as an aside --
7	MR. SEBOLD: I would really
8	appreciate it if —
9	THE WITNESS: Yeah. Okay.
10	MR. SEBOLD: I know I made this
11	longer but--
12	THE WITNESS: Next time.
13	MR. SEBOLD: Next time. Give us
14	something to look forward to.
15	MR. PEDROSA:
16	Q. Lastly, I know I asked you about
17	Kent ads, Newport ads, is there any other
18	Lorillard brand that you plan to use any
19	ads to talk about in connection with your
20	opinions in this case?
21	A. Right now, I think that's it. I
22	mean, there are so many brands that are
23	identified in this case. You have to focus
24	on the high points.
25	MR. PEDROSA: Thank you,
0281
1	Professor. I appreciate your time.
2	THE WITNESS: You're welcome.
3	MR. BRENNER: I have nothing else
4	I think some people on the phone do.
5	MS. FISCHER: I just have a couple
6	follow-up questions.
7	EXAMINATION
8	BY MS. FISCHER:
9	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you had said that
10	there was ample evidence in the industry
11	that Chesterfield caused harm. You just
12	said that, correct?
13	A. Yes. Yeah. Chesterfield being a
14	cigarette. Yes.
15	Q. Exactly. What evidence do you
16	have that Liggett had knowledge of that?
17	A. I think --1 think by -- by 1955,
18	there was certainly scientific evidence --
19	no matter what position people took on the
20	various issues of cancer causation, there
21	was ample evidence that -- just in
22	published scientific literature that the
23	statement "will not harm nose, throat or
24	accessory organs" was false.
25	Whether Liggett knew, they
0282
1	certainly should have known. So that's --
2	Q. You've not been asked to testify
3	in this area; is that correct?
4	A. That's correct.
5	MS. FISCHER: Thank you. No
6	questions.
7	EXAMINATION
8	BY MS. GOTTLIEB:
9	Q. Good evening, Dr. Kyriakoudes. I
10	know it's been a long day, so I'm going to
11	try and keep this really short.
12	For the record --
13	A. Could you just speak up a little
14	bit?
15	Q. Sorry. Let me get the phone
16	closer. Is this better?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Okay. Again, my name is Morgan
19	Gottlieb, and I'm with Schlesinger Law
20	Office representing the plaintiff in this
21	case.
22	Dr. Kyriakoudes, you testified
23	earlier that there's evidence that Mr.
24	Calloway chose light cigarettes because he
25	believed them to be safer or better for
0283
1	him, correct?
2	A. That's correct.
3	Q. Would you say that in your opinion
4	the concept that light cigarettes are
5	healthier or safer is with the position
6	that was used and expressed by the tobacco
7	industry through their advertisement?
8	MR. BRENNER: Object to the form.
9	MR. PEDROSA: Object to the form.
10	A. Yes.
11	MS. GOTTLIEB:
12	Q. And that that concept could be
13	seen in a wide variety of their
14	advertisements for light cigarettes,
15	correct?
16	MR. BRENNER: Object to the form.
17	A. Yes. Yes. That's right.
18	MS. GOTTLIEB:
19	Q. With the prevalence -- you've
20	testified about the prevalence of cigarette
21	advertisements in general. Would you say
22	that it's also likely that due to the
23	prevalence of cigarette advertisements,
24	that Mr. Calloway was exposed to
25	advertisements for light cigarettes?
0284
1	MR. BRENNER: Object to the form.
2	A. Yes. It's highly likely.
3	MS. GOTTLIEB:
4	Q. And is it your opinion or are you
5	able to say that whether or not you believe
6	that Mr. Calloway relied more likely than
7	not on the industry's position that light
8	cigarettes were healthier or safer?
9	MR. BRENNER: Object to the form.
10	A. Yeah. And keeping in line with my
11	testimony this morning, when I was asked
12	about the effect of advertising, it's --
13	given the appeal or -- let me rephrase
14	that. Given the prevalence of the
15	advertising of light products, light
16	cigarette products, the movement towards
17	the light product and then evidence that --
18	of belief that the light product was, as
19	you said, better for him would suggest
20	within a reasonable historical inference
21	that at some level, the advertising was
22	having an effect on his --on millions of
23	people, including Mr. Calloway.
24	MS. GOTTLIEB:
25	Q. Just one last area of questioning.
0285
1	I want to go back. You testified that
2	there was also evidence in the record that
3	Mr. Calloway clipped coupons for
4	cigarettes, correct?
5	A. It was mentioned. Yes.
6	Q. Okay. And coupons that are placed
7	in magazines or other publications, is that
8	a form of marketing, would you say?
9	A. Yes. Form of marketing and
10	advertising. Yes.
11	Q. So the fact that he was actually
12	clipping these coupons shows that he was
13	exposed -- Mr. Calloway was exposed to
14	those particular advertisements?
15	MR. BRENNER: Object to the form.
16	A. Yes. He would have had to, you
17	know, use his hands to pull them out of the
18	magazine and save them. Yes. So he was,
19	therefore, interacting with them and
20	manipulating them.
21	MS. GOTTLIEB:
22	Q. And getting at my next question,
23	which is the fact that there's evidence
24	that he was clipping these coupons and, you
25	know, using them to purchase cigarettes,
0286
1	would you -- is that evidence in your
2	opinion of the way in which that particular
3	form of marketing influenced his smoking
4	behavior?
5	MR. BRENNER: Object to the form.
6	A. Yes. He would've had to make an
7	affirmative action to save the coupons and
8	redeem them and the like. Yes. So that
9	was a particularly active form of
10	interaction with the advertisement.
11	MS. GOTTLIEB: I have no further
12	questions.
