Videoconference deposition of THOMAS DIBACCO, held at the offices of, Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman LLP, 1633
Broadway, New York, New York, pursuant to Notice, before Penny Sherman, a Notary Public of the State of New Jersey.
THOMAS DiBACCO, called as a witness, having been duly sworn by a Notary Public, was examined and testified as follows:
EXAMINATION BY
MR. GDANSKI:
Q. Good morning, how are you?
A. Good morning, how are you?
Q. I'm doing all right. Can you tell me your full name?
A. Thomas DiBacco.
Q. My name is Jonathan Gdanski. I'm going to take your deposition today. I know you've had your deposition taken in the past.
I'm just making the volume a little louder on my end.
But I'm going to go over some of the basic ground rules of the deposition, okay?
A. Fine.
Q. I'll ask you some questions, and hopefully you'll give me answers to those questions. If you don't understand any of my
questions, just let me know, okay?
A. Can you hear me all right?
Q. I hear you perfectly fine. Can you hear me?
A. I can hear you perfectly.
Q. Great.
MR. FEIWUS: And Jonathan, just so we're clear, an objection by one defendant is an objection with respect to all defendants.
We're reserving -- we're preserving all objections.

2David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
MR. GDANSKI: Okay. I don't know what you mean when you say you're preserving all objections. I mean --
MR. FEIWUS: Standard stips, reserving all objections except for objections to form. So I don't have to object if you lack
foundation or there's hearsay evidence or anything like that. It's a standard stip in a deposition in Florida.
MR. GDANSKI: Yeah, that's -- okay, that's fine. That's fine.
MR. FEIWUS: That's all I meant.
MR. GDANSKI: Okay.
Q. Well, have you ever had your deposition taken through a video teleconference system like this one?
A. No.
Q. So, all of the regular rules of a deposition apply. If you need a break, let me know. If you don't understand a question, let
me know. I won't talk over you, to the best of my ability, and hopefully you'll do your best to not talk over me and wait for
me to finish my question.
All those rules apply, but with special force and effect, the rule of not talking over each other applies, because there's an
occasional lag or some kind of disconnect in the system that connects me to look at you and you to look at me.
So if you could really do your best to wait a few seconds after I finish my questions to answer, and I will do my best and wait
a few seconds after you finished your answer to ask you another question. That way it'll be as clear as possible, okay?
A. Yes. I have one other issue. In a normal deposition, if I choose to pause, I can pause for an inordinate length of time. Now,
in this videoconferencing, will this have any effect? Is this being recorded permanently, or are we using the record as the basis
for the deposition?
Q. Yeah, there is no video. I'm not videotaping this, even though I can see you on the television screen.
A. That's fine.
Q. So there's no video nature to this deposition. If you pause for an indeterminate length of time, I might ask what's going on.
A. Of course not.
Q. Right. Okay. But, no, you can take your time. And if you're in the middle of an answer, and I didn't appreciate that when I
ask you my next question, just let me know, and I'll, you know, stop asking my question, okay?
A. That's fine. You answered my question.
Q. All right. Good. Hopefully that will be the last question you get to ask me.
A. Okay.
Q. What is your current home address?
A. [ DELETED ], [ DELETED ].

Q. When did you get you to New York for your deposition today?
A. I've been here for about a week.
Q. Who flew you to New York?
A. I flew myself.
Q. Are you going to be reimbursed for that flight?
A. No.
Q. Did you go to New York for leisure and you happened to be there at the same time as this deposition?
A. I have an apartment in New York.
Q. Where is your apartment in New York?
A. Midtown.
Q. What is the address?
A. [ DELETED ].
Q. Where is [ DELETED ]? What street is that, what's the cross street?
A. [ DELETED ].
Q. Okay, gotcha. Did up come to New York because you had your deposition scheduled, or were you going there anyway
on vacation?
A. No. I spend my summers, my wife and I, here in New York in order to avoid the heat of Florida. And I go back and forth
between Palm Beach and New York during the summer.
Q. When were you last in New York before this trip?
A. Well, I was here the entire month of September until September 29th, and I flew back to Palm Beach, came back on October
2nd.
Q. What is your current business address?
A. 1295 North Lake Way, Palm Beach, Florida.
Q. What business do you operate at that address?
A. I do consultant work.
Q. What's the nature of the consultant work that you do?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
4David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
A. Well, I do consultant work for cigarette companies. I do consultant work for book editors. I do consultant work for schools,
when I'm asked.
Q. Do you have any professional work or professional practice outside of your consulting work that you do from home?
A. No, except for occasional pieces that I write for journals or newspapers.
Q. Are you paid for those on a per diem basis, or is it just voluntary?
A. Which ones? All of them or --
Q. No, the occasional pieces you write for journals or newspapers.
A. No, I'm paid for them.
Q. Are you on salary at any newspaper or journal?
A. No.
Q. What percentage of your time is currently spent doing any kind of consulting?
A. Very little. I'm retired, so whatever I do, I choose to do between my retirement schedule. So I would say that very little of
my time is actually spent in terms of consulting, although it varies year to year.
Q. Which cigarette companies have you consulted for?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection. Just time frame, what are you talking about?
MR. GDANSKI: Ever.
Q. Which cigarette companies have you ever consulted for?
A. Well, I essentially work as a consultant for law firms. And I'm not sure which ones are represented -- are representing which
particular cigarette companies. I've worked with law firms such as Kasowitz Benson. I've worked with Winston Strawn. I've
worked with Shook Hardy & Bacon. I've worked with Jones Day. Those are the ones that come to mind.
Q. No other firms come to mind that you've worked with?
A. I think, a long time ago, now that we have Mr. Stoever on from Arnold & Porter -- is it Arnold & Porter? I think I did
represent -- did represent Arnold & Porter in a case in New York, but I'm not positive. That comes to mind, the name.
Q. Do you know Mr. Stoever?
A. I do not.
Q. You're aware that all the firms that you mentioned, they represent cigarette companies, correct?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
5David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
A. Those are the firms that I work with that represented cigarette companies. I'm not certain which firms represented which
cigarette companies.
Q. So you don't know what firm Kasowitz Benson represents -- I'm sorry, you don't know what company?
A. In this case I do. But with respect to the other firms, some of these cases involved many companies, and I'm not certain that
I could identify which company was representing which firm.
Q. But you understand you're doing the work on behalf of the tobacco companies, correct?
A. Absolutely.
Q. And when you're called to trial, you're going to be a witness on behalf of a tobacco company, right?
A. I am going to be a witness on behalf of a firm representing a tobacco company, that is correct.
Q. Well, no, that's not what I asked. When they get up at trial, they're going to say, Philip Morris calls as its next witness, and
they may say your name or someone else's name. You understand that a tobacco company is going to call you as a witness
in this case, correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection to form.
A. Again, I don't know the legalities of it. I know that I work directly with a lawyer representing Kasowitz Benson, and that
company represents Liggett.
Q. And you understand that in these cases, you're testifying on behalf of a company, not a law firm, right?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection to form.
A. Again, I'm not certain of the legal relationship.
Q. Well, is Kasowitz Benson being sued in this case?
A. No.
Q. Okay. Liggett Tobacco Company is being sued, right?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection to form.
A. To the best of my knowledge, that's correct.
Q. When did you retire?
A. In 1998, from my teaching position at the American University.
Q. For how long were you a professor?
A. From 1965 to 1998.

6David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. What was your doctorate in?
A. American history.
Q. Any subspecialty of American history?
A. No. I developed subspecialties as I progressed as a teacher.
Q. So it was just general American history, or was it focused on a specific time period?
A. Doctorates awarded at the time, in 1965, when I received mine, were awarded only in a general field.
Q. Okay. What subspecialty do you think you developed over the course of your teaching and educational history?
A. Well, the first subspecialty was American social history, which is the history of everyday life. And that was my primary
focus. Then --
Q. Okay. Go ahead.
A. I'm sorry.
Q. No, go ahead, I'm sorry.
A. Then as time went on, I developed other subspecialties based upon particular dissertations that I had a hand in participating
in or chairing in terms of a committee. And they included such areas as 20th century American history, American business
history, recent American history. These are the main areas.
Q. What did you do to become an expert or develop a specialty in the history of everyday life?
A. Well, I did a lot of research in developing courses. I developed a course entitled, American Social History, which was a two-
semester course taught at the American University.
And I worked with researchers who were doing work in that field, using their books and expertise and developed a course in
the history of American life. And I did independent research on my own in order to ascertain the history of American life.
Q. That's, I think you'd agree, a broad subject matter, history of everyday life. What are you talking about? I mean, what are
you specifically referring to?
A. Most history is designed to talk about politics. Students some in and they are exposed to the presidents of an era, what
Congress does, what the courts and, in particular, what the supreme court does.
That has been the focus of teaching American history from earliest times until about the 1920s, when a historian by the name
of James Truslow Adams believed that students were being overwhelmed with politics. And they didn't understand enough
about what the everyday person did throughout history; what they did when they got up in the morning, what they did for work,
what they did for leisure, what they ate, what their marital practices were in terms of when they married, and the raising of
children, what they did in terms of recreational activities. And beginning in the 1920s, with Mr. Adams' help, historians slowly
began to pay attention to this area.

7David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. Would you agree that the cigarette has played a significant role in the history of American everyday life from the 20th
century?
A. I would say, not only the cigarette, but tobacco in general.
Q. And cigarette companies, as well, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. I think you said something about what people do when they wake up in the morning; is that what you said?
A. Yes.
Q. What do people do when they wake up in the morning?
A. Well, it depended upon the era, Mr. Gdanski.
Q. In the 1950s, what were people doing when they woke up in the morning?
A. Many individuals would have a cup of joe, coffee, first thing in the morning. Some of them would smoke, some of them
would eat breakfast first. Many of them would sit in breakfast with their family, which has changed over the years. And then
the mother would stay home in the 1950s, and the father would go to work, and the children would go to school.
Q. In the 1960s, would people still wake up and drink coffee and eat breakfast and smoke cigarettes?
A. Yes, although --
Q. Okay.
A. Excuse me.
Q. Uh-huh.
A. Although, by the 1960s, you had more information with respect to the hazards of cigarette smoking, and that began to change.
Q. Okay. I didn't ask you about the information -- about the hazards of cigarette smoking. I didn't ask you about the information
of the hazards of smoking -- of drinking coffee, either. I know that's that your area, the information out there on the hazards, but
maybe, just to try to ease things along and smooth -- you know, make it a little easier, just try to answer my questions, okay?
A. Certainly.
Q. All right.
What percentage of American females smoked cigarettes in the 1950s?
A. Very small percentage. Most of the smoking was done by men. About 40 percent of men smoked in the 1950s.
Q. That wasn't my question, either. If you don't know the percentage, that's okay.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
8David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
A. I said a very small percentage. Less than 40 percent.
Q. Less than 5 percent?
A. No, 40 percent.
Q. Right, I'm asking you less than 5 percent?
A. I don't know if it's that small.
Q. More than 10 percent?
A. I don't know that.
Q. So do you know if it was more or less than 30 percent?
A. I don't know that.
Q. What percentage of females smoked cigarettes in the 1960s in this country?
A. It increased. I don't know the percentage, but it was enough for the Surgeon General to express concern about it.
Q. What percentage of females smoked cigarettes in the 1970s in this country?
A. Again, the percentage, I'm unaware of, but there was a, again, concern from the Surgeon General pointing to the rise in the
number of women who smoked. I don't --
Q. And so, is it -- go ahead.
A. So I don't know the percentage, but it was increasing.
Q. Is it fair to say that you don't know the percentage of female smoking in this country at any one point in time?
MR. FEIWUS: You mean with -- you mean with an absolute number?
MR. GDANSKI: I mean a rough number, 30, 40, 50. So far I haven't heard any numbers.
MR. FEIWUS: You're talking about off the top of his head.
MR. GDANSKI: We are sitting here.
MR. FEIWUS: I know, but you're not asking him to find that information for you in his materials or, you know, to look at any
documents. You're asking him, off the top of his head, what the number -- what the percentage is in a particular decade.
A. By 1980, the Surgeon General had a special report on the increase. It was one of the surgeon general's reports usually issued
on January 11th of every year. And he issued one on female smoking in 1980.

9David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
And in that report, he argued that cigarette smoking by women would lead to increased cancers that would increase -- that
would actually exceed the number of cancers from breast cancer.
Q. All right. I'm aware of the 1980 Surgeon General report. I'm asking a very, very simple question, I think. And if you don't
know the answer to it, that's absolutely okay. And if you want to tell me you need to look through things to find the answer,
you can do that.
My question is, do you know what percentage of American females smoked cigarettes in the '60s, '70s or '80s?
A. I do not.
Q. You do not know that answer with regard to the 1950s, either, do you?
A. I do not.
Q. Okay, thank you.
What's the name of the case that we're here for today?
A. David Katz, et al. versus Liggett.
Q. What's the name of the smoker?
A. Janice Katz.
Q. When was Janice Katz born?
A. 1931.
Q. When did she pass away?
A. 1998.
Q. How old was she when she started smoking?
A. Well, there's disagreement about that. Some of the testimony in the deposition would suggest that she started when she
was a teenager.
Q. Specifically who suggests that?
A. Her husband, David Katz.
Q. Anybody else?
A. No, to my knowledge.
Q. Does anybody suggest a different start date?
A. No, to my knowledge.

10David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. Will you accept that Janice Katz began smoking cigarettes as a teenager?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection. Are you asking him to assume that fact.
MR. GDANSKI: No.
Q. I mean, is that what you're accepting to be her start date?
A. I don't know. That was stated by the husband, and that's the only evidence we have to that effect.
Q. Do you have any reason to believe that that's inaccurate?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. I don't know. I'm not here to deal with the accuracy or inaccuracy of that.
Q. What year would that have been, she began smoking, if David Katz's recollection is accurate?
A. It would have been in the mid-'40s.
Q. Where did she live?
A. Well, first she lived in Brooklyn.
Q. In the mid-'40s, do you know where she lived?
A. She lived in Brooklyn.
Q. What was Janice Katz's first brand of cigarettes that she smoked?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. Again --
MR. FEIWUS: Lacks foundation.
A. According to the testimony of David Katz, Chesterfield.
Q. Do you have any reason to disbelieve the testimony of David Katz?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. Again, I'm not here to testify to the accuracy or inaccuracy.
Q. Did you read the deposition of Georgie Levine?
A. I did.

11David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. Did she also recall that the first brand of cigarettes that she smoked was Chesterfield?
A. She did.
Q. Who manufactured Chesterfield during the period of time that Janice Katz smoked them as her first cigarette?
A. Liggett.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection to the form.
Q. Do you know who manufactures Chesterfield cigarettes today?
A. I do not.
Q. On whose behalf are you providing testimony in the case?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection. That was asked and answered.
A. I'm providing it for Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman.
Q. Do you know what tobacco company they represent?
A. Liggett.
Q. Are you providing testimony for the Arnold & Porter law firm in this case?
A. I have no idea about that.
MR. STOEVER: Objection.
Q. Are you providing testimony for the Greenberg Traurig law firm?
MR. STOEVER: Objection.
Q. Well, are you providing testimony on behalf of all the tobacco companies or just Liggett and Vector?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. The only thing that I know of is that I am providing testimony to Kasowitz & Benson. I don't know the relationship of
these other firms.
Q. Okay. Unless -- we have all the lawyers on the phone, so unless there's some misunderstanding, I'll state my understanding.
My understanding is that he provided testimony just on behalf of Liggett and Vector and as a witness for the Kasowitz Benson
firm. If I am wrong, now might be a good time to correct me.
MR. STOEVER: John, this is Tom Stoever. You can draw any conclusions that you want. I'm going to stand on the expert
witness disclosure that we filed in this case.
MR. FEIWUS: And we will stand on our expert witness disclosure, as well.

12David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
MR. GDANSKI: Okay.
Q. How many depositions have you given in your history, professional history?
A. I gave a deposition in the Broin case in 1997. I gave a deposition in the Engle case. I gave a deposition in the Lucas case.
I gave a deposition in Blue Cross/Blue Shield case in New York. I gave a deposition in a case entitled, Tune, a deposition in
a case entitled, Eastman, a deposition in a case entitled, Mattern, a deposition in a case entitled, Tross, and a deposition in a
case entitled, Ferlanti.
Q. Were all those cases tobacco cases?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know where the Tune case was filed?
A. St. Petersburg.
Q. St. Petersburg, Florida, correct?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. Do you know who the plaintiffs were or was?
A. Howard Acosta.
Q. Same thing with the Eastman case, correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. How about the Mattern case?
A. That was Kasowitz Benson.
Q. Right, but I assume they weren't representing a smoker.
Do you know where the case was filed?
A. I'm sorry.
Q. No problem.
A. I misunderstood you.
Q. No problem.
A. That was a Missouri case, and I think it was a firm entitled, McLane something.
Q. How about the Frost case?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
13David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
A. That was -- I don't know the plaintiff's firm. I can't remember it. It may have been --
Q. Do you know what --
A. It was Kansas City, Missouri.
Q. And Ferlanti I'm familiar with. In how many of those cases have you testified at trial?
A. I testified in Engle, in Lucas, in Tune, Eastman, Mattern and Ferlanti.
Q. Six times; did I count it right?
A. I didn't count. I know by names.
Q. Engle, Lucas, Tune, Eastman, Mattern, and Ferlanti, did I miss one?
A. That's correct.
Q. The last time you testified at trial, that would be in Ferlanti; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Have you given any depositions in any nontobacco cases?
A. When I was a member of the faculty at American University, I was dean for faculty affairs, and I gave testimony on behalf
of a faculty member who sued the university on an employment matter, and I was deposed in that case.
Q. Any other cases other than that one?
A. No.
Q. Have you ever been sued personally?
A. No.
Q. Have you ever sued anybody?
A. No.
Q. And when was the first time you were approached by anybody about the possibility of working for the tobacco companies?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. In 1995.
Q. Who approached you?
A. A gentleman by the name of Allen R. Purvis, P-U-R-V-I-S.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
14David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. What firm is he with?
A. At the time, he was with Shook Hardy & Bacon.
Q. And you said at the time, did that change?
A. Yes.
Q. What changed?
A. I think he became a member of another firm subsequently.
Q. Do you know what firm?
A. It was entitled, Johnson Tyler & Purvis.
Q. Do you know what firm Shook Hardy & Bacon represents?
A. At the time he approached me, it was Philip Morris.
Q. From what case were you initially approached to work on?
A. I was not asked to work on a specific case.
Q. Do you know how Mr. Purvis came to know of you?
A. I had written about the health hazards of smoking and history of it for USA today, and he had seen the article or someone
he knew had seen the article and referenced my article to him.
Q. What was that article about?
A. It was about the discussion of whether or not the Food & Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission should
have more regulation of cigarette products on the grounds that there was not enough information available about the health
hazards of smoking.
And I wrote an article which pointed out that the history of cigarettes and tobacco in general was replete with information
regarding the health risks of smoking that was publicly available throughout the country.
Q. Did your article reach a conclusion or a recommendation?
A. Yes.
Q. What was the recommendation or conclusion?
A. That there was no need for additional regulation.
Q. Did the FDA decide to accept an initial regulation?

15David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
A. Excuse me?
Q. Did the FDA undertake additional regulation?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. In 1995, no.
Q. Have they since?
A. Yes.
Q. What percentage of the American public was smoking in 1980?
A. About 20 percent, a little more.
Q. How about 1970?
A. A little more than that. At the height of smoking, it was about 40 percent in the 1940s and early-'50s.
Q. What do you understand your role to be in this case?
A. My role was to ascertain the extent to which information regarding the health risks of smoking, in particular, the risk of
disease, death and addiction were available to individuals like Janice Katz living in the community she did throughout her
lifetime.
Q. What was your role in the Broin litigation?
A. That was a case involving flight attendants, and to be honest with you, that was in 1997. I, frankly, don't recall, other than
provide general information about the health risks of smoking. I don't recall that deposition.
Q. What research did you do in order for you to be able to offer opinions in the Broin litigation?
A. Well, I had done research -- excuse me -- for many years prior to ever being asked by anyone to do research for the tobacco
companies. I did this research in order to do my teaching in American social history.
So I had done a great deal of research in that background era, and I believe, when I was asked to do a deposition in the Broin case,
I was asked to do a deposition to deal with the research I had done on, I think, two areas, as I recall it. First of all, information
regarding health risks in general, and secondly, of secondhand smoke.
Q. Right. In Broin, the people weren't smokers, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. When did Janice Katz first know that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection to form.
A. I don't know that.

Q. Can you point to any one point in time in which Janice Katz came to become aware that smoking cigarettes causes lung
cancer?
A. I cannot.
Q. Can you tell me any one point in time when Janice Katz was aware that smoking cigarettes was addictive?
A. I don't know.
Q. When did Philip -- sorry, strike that. New verbiage.
When did Liggett Tobacco Company first know that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. I don't know that.
Q. When did Liggett Tobacco Company first admit that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer?
A. Again, I think it was during the 1990s.
Q. Do you know when during the '90s?
A. I think '97.
Q. When did Philip Morris first admit that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer?
A. I think that the tobacco companies, including Philip Morris, indicated they agreed with the medical consensus that smoking is
the causative agent of lung cancer. I think that was the wording used. And Philip Morris did it during the course of the Engle trial.
Q. Do you know when during the course of the Engle trial?
A. I think it was the year 2000 or 1999.
Q. Same thing with RJ Reynolds and Lorillard Tobacco Company.
A. I believe that's so.
MR. STOEVER: Object to form.
Q. Do you know when any of these companies were first aware that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. The cigarette companies, when studies began to come out in the 1950s by such researchers as Evarts Graham and Ernst
Wynder argued that this was a statistical relationship, and they wanted more search -- research and they wanted scientists to
pursue causative research.

17David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
In other words, to find the specific causation. And that was the tobacco companies' stance during the 1950s and throughout
that era.
Q. When you say the tobacco companies, are you including all of the major American tobacco companies, which would include
Liggett, Philip Morris and Lorillard Tobacco Company?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection. This entire line is beyond the scope of his testimony. He's not here to testify about tobacco company
conduct. He's here to testify about information that was publicly available.
A. I don't know that. I don't know all of the companies.
Q. Let's back up, then.
You haven't studied any of the internal documents of any tobacco company, correct?
A. No, I dealt with only publicly available information.
Q. But you are aware of the public position taken by all of the tobacco companies, correct?
A. When?
Q. Over the periods of time that you researched.
A. I indicated that to you, that during the 1950s, that, in general, the tobacco companies, during the period when reports were
being issued regarding the relationship of cigarette smoking and lung cancer, that they argued that more research should be done,
that the relationship that the studies had confirmed was statistical, and they wanted to find scientific causation of lung cancer.
Q. Did they maintain that there was no connection between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. No, that isn't what they said. I just indicated what they said.
Q. And what you've indicated they said as their position in the '50s, was that also their position in the '60s?
A. Yes.
Q. Was it also their position in the '70s?
A. Yes.
Q. Was it also their position in the '80s?
A. As that information was being -- more research was being done, the companies attempted to work with their researchers to
establish that scientific causation. But for the most part, that was the argument that they maintained, to the best of my knowledge.
Q. So, just to make it a little clearer. During the course of the '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s, the tobacco company's public position,
to the best of your knowledge, was that more testing needed to be done. The statistical association was not enough, and there
needed to be further causative testing done; is that correct?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
18David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
A. That's correct.
Q. And now, throughout the '90s, was that also their position, up until the point in time that each company changed their position?
A. To the best of my knowledge, by then, I think there was a great medical consensus, and the tobacco companies, as I indicated
to you, agreed with that medical consensus over the period of the '90s.
MR. STOEVER: Objection.
Q. What agency, group, scientific organization or individual, other than the tobacco companies, maintained in the 1980s that
additional testing needed to be done in order to prove that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer?
A. The American Cancer Society, Public Health -- may I finish?
Q. Yeah, sure.
A. Public Health Service, which is the domain of the Surgeon General, Public Health Officials of the States, American Lung
Association, American Medical Association, end.
Q. Did you say and, A-N-D or E-N-D?
A. E-N-D.
Q. Okay.
A. It's hard in this context to put an end to it, but I'll try to nod to you.
Q. Okay. You're telling me that in the '80s, the American Cancer Society, the Surgeon General, the American Lung Association,
American Medical Association, all maintained that additional testing needed to be done in order to prove that smoking cigarettes
causes lung cancer?
A. No. They needed more research to deal with the issue of lung cancer and the matters of the relationship of smoking and
addiction. All of this was done and urged throughout this entire period.
Q. Okay.
A. And that included the issue of addiction, which also came to be a matter in the forefront of continued research, which was
illustrated by the 1988 surgeon general's report.
Q. I understand. We'll get to that.
My question, though, is, you agree, then that in the 1980s, the tobacco companies maintained that it was not conclusively proven
that cigarettes causes lung cancer and more testing needed to be done, correct?
A. It was a statistical relationship. I would go to that term. I think that's a very important term. To this very day, there has not
been, to my reading of the information which is being sent out, I don't know if we have scientific causation.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
19David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
So the argument of the companies was that more research needed to be done and that the statistical association needed to be
confirmed by causation, scientific causation.
Q. And their position was, it may cause cancer and it may not cause cancer, correct?
A. No, I didn't say that.
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
Q. I'm not asking if you said that. I'm asking if that was their public position.
A. No. Their public position was that it was a statistical association, and that is part of an association.
Q. Did the tobacco companies in the 1980s, admit that their product caused lung cancer?
A. No, because they argued what I have just indicated, that this was a scientific -- it was a statistical association.
Q. And their position was that statistics are not enough, correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. Their argument was more research, statistics and scientific causation.
Q. Did anybody else, other than the tobacco companies, make that same argument?
A. I indicated those organizations earlier, who urged that more research be done to unravel the enigma of lung cancer, yes.
Q. That's not my question. The tobacco companies did not accept that the statistical association between smoking cigarettes
and lung cancer was sufficient in order to make a causative connection between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer, correct?
MR. FEIWUS: I object. I object to form, and I object to this line of questioning. You are making a broad characterization
over, as I hear your question, a decade of time and multiple companies. And you're generalizing it and asking him to accept
your generalization.
If you have a specific statement by a specific company at a specific time that you want him to address, then please show it to
him or ask him about it. But don't make broad generalizations about multiple parties over a decade period of time as to what
their position was or what they said and ask him to agree or disagree or characterize it in any way.
MR. GDANSKI: How about we just keep objections to object to the form?
MR. FEIWUS: I will certainly try to do that. But I've given you some leeway on this line, and you keep persisting and arguing
with the witness and trying to box him in on what is an unfair line of questioning, and it's highly misleading. So I'll let you
go, keep going.
Q. Do you have any specific opinions about the public positions of different tobacco companies over time?
A. No, I don't.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
20David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. For purposes of your testimony, you're grouping the public position, the publicly known and publicly available position of
the tobacco companies together as one, correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. I'm not doing any of that, no, sir.
Q. You're not doing that?
A. No, I'm not.
MR. FEIWUS: You're doing that.
Q. Did the American Medical Association in the 1980s, publicly maintain that more testing was needed in order to prove that
smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer?
A. The Medical Association did not believe that warnings were necessary when the first warnings came out, but I don't know
of any stance of the American Medical Association which would disagree with the association of smoking and lung cancer.
Q. Do you know of any stance of the tobacco companies that would disagree with the association of smoking and lung cancer
taken publicly?
A. I don't understand that.
Q. I'll ask it again. You said a moment ago that you don't know of any stance of the American Medical Association taken in the
'80s that would disagree with the association between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Now I'm using your same words and asking you, do you know of any stance taken by any tobacco company that would
disagree with the association between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer in that same decade?
A. That's outside my realm of expertise. You've gone beyond what I've done for this case.
Q. Well, for this case, you've analyzed the publicly available information that affected the smoking environment over the period
of time in which Janice Katz lived?
A. I examined the publicly available information relating to the health risk of smoking that was available to Janice Katz.
Q. And that would include information from all kinds of different sources, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Some sources are sources like the Surgeon General or the American Medical Association, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. Some sources are sources like schoolteachers and school textbooks, correct?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
21David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
A. That's correct.
Q. And some sources are sources from the manufacturer or statements from cigarette companies made in the public press,
correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. In the public press, the tobacco companies would make their position known on the connection between smoking cigarettes
and adverse health consequences, correct?
A. They would make their position known, that is correct.
Q. Their position was that more testing needed to be done, the statistical association was not enough to make a causative
connection --
A. Right.
Q. -- between cigarettes and any adverse health consequence, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you've seen that position in many newspaper articles or publicly available pieces of information, correct?
A. That is not correct. There are very few indications of that in the publicly available information. And the evidence of that is
the work I did in the Engle case, in which I compiled all of the newspaper and magazine articles relating to the health risks of
smoking or relating to smoking in general. And I found that the stack of papers in which smoking and the health risks were
highlighted and evidenced far out numbered the stack in which the tobacco industry's statements regarding smoking and health
risks. So they were not widely available. The tobacco industry's stance was rarely covered.
Q. How many articles have you seen where the tobacco companies' position was covered in the public media?
A. In the Engle case, I found about -- of all of the articles that were published during the period of 1950 until about 1985, 6
percent of all the articles gave the tobacco company position press, very small percentage.
Q. What was the total amount of articles you amassed?
A. Thousands.
Q. Hundreds of thousands or just thousands?
A. No, thousands.
Q. How many thousands?
A. Several thousand.
Q. So, out of the several thousand articles you reviewed, 6 percent had a tobacco company denial or statement in it?
A. Yes.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
22David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. And often, in those particular statements, the health risks of smoking were highlighted, and three-fourths or more of the
article would be given to the Surgeon General or other medical authorities, and then a very small line or paragraph to the
position of the cigarette companies.
Q. What original research did you do for this case?
A. Basically, I read the depositions of the family members, as well as friends, and I used the materials that I had used in the
Ferlanti case, and I reviewed all of these for this case.
Q. When you say all of these, what does that mean?
A. All of the ones that I had presented as my reliance material in the Ferlanti case.
Q. So is your reliance list in this case the exact same as it was in the Ferlanti case?
A. Yes.
Q. Have you included any advertisements in your reliance materials?
A. No. Except for smoking cessation advertisements.
Q. What depositions have you read in this case?
A. Mr. David Katz, two volumes; Mrs. Susan Seltzer; Ms. Ellen Katz; Mr. Terry Katz; Dorothy Levine; Stanley Mestel; Bernice
Mestel; and Dr. Bruce Berenson.
Q. Why would you read Dr. Berenson's deposition?
A. Again, to ascertain the smoking history of Mrs. Katz.
Q. When did Mrs. -- what's Mrs. Katz's smoking history?
A. That's in confusion and in debate. Mr. Katz --
Q. What is --
A. Mr. Katz argued, Mr. David Katz, that his wife smoked until she was diagnosed with lung cancer. The children indicate
she quit when she had her surgery in 1983.
Q. Do you have a position as to when she stopped smoking?
A. No. I have no idea when she stopped smoking.
Q. Does it make a difference to you?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
23David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
A. It would make a difference in terms of the types of materials with respect to my focus. If she isn't smoking, there would
be little reason to present information after her smoking years. So I had to make a comprehensive list of materials that would
include her entire life.
Q. But you didn't make any list of any materials. You included your Ferlanti reliance list, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. You didn't go back and alter that list to tailor, to fit Janice Katz, right?
A. Actually, I did make a list, I just kept the box. The list that you have is a product of Mr. Feiwus, not me.
Q. So you did not put your reliance list together?
A. You asked me to put a -- bring my reliance materials. Here they are.
Q. Well, I'm not there with you. So, did the materials that you have in those boxes correspond to the reliance list that I've
received?
A. Yes.
Q. There's nothing in those boxes that's not on your reliance list, correct?
A. Not to my knowledge, no.
Q. There's nothing on this list that's not in those boxes, correct?
A. Not to my knowledge.
Q. This list is exactly the same as the one in Ferlanti, correct.
A. To my knowledge, that's correct.
Q. You didn't include or exclude any materials because they either related to Janice Katz or they did not relate to Janice Katz,
correct?
A. I don't understand that.
Q. Well, for example, Janice Katz smoked Eve cigarettes, right?
A. It doesn't matter to me what cigarette she smoked.
Q. Okay.
A. That's immaterial. I'm dealing with the health hazards of smoking. The cigarette brand use is immaterial to me.
Q. Janice Katz smoked Chesterfield cigarettes, right?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
24David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
A. Again, I'm not an expert in that. I can't verify that. I'm not here to testify to the voracity of what she smoked.
Q. The testimony is that Janice Katz smoked Chesterfield cigarettes?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. No.
Q. No?
A. There were other brands mentioned in that -- in the depositions.
Q. I didn't say exclusively Chesterfield cigarettes, but there is testimony she smoked Chesterfield cigarettes, correct?
A. There's testimony that among cigarettes, she smoked Chesterfield.
Q. And there's also testimony that amongst other brands of cigarettes, she smoked Eve cigarettes, right?
A. Again, I'm not concerned with that. I'm not concerned whether she smoked Chesterfield or Old Gold. The issue is, I'm
concerned only with providing information about the health risks of smoking.
Q. The health risks of smoking that were publicly available, right?
A. That is correct.
Q. And cigarette advertisements appeared in publicly available medium, correct?
A. They did.
Q. They appeared in newspapers, magazines and television commercials, correct?
A. No, that has to be refined. There were no television commercials after 1971. And every advertisement in print after 1972
had the surgeon general's warning.
Q. Well, you'll have an opportunity to advocate on behalf of tobacco companies at some point in the future, but that just was
not my question. I didn't ask you about when warnings went on cigarette advertisements, and I didn't ask you when there was
a ban on television advertisements. I'm simply asking --
MR. FEIWUS: Well, Jonathan, I'm going to ask you not to argue with the witness, okay?
And the reason you got the answer you got is because your question was unclear as to time frame. So if you would ask a more
specific question instead of open-ended questions about tobacco advertisements on television over a 50-year period of time,
you might get better answers.
MR. GDANSKI: My question had nothing to do with warnings on advertisements, it just didn't, okay?
MR. FEIWUS: Well, don't argue with the witness. Just ask your questions and move on.

25David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. Would you agree that over the course of the 20th century, there were cigarette advertisements on television, in print media
and in newspapers?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection to form. That question and asked and answered. You want to ask a question as to a specific period of
time and a specific type of marketing, please focus your question. It's a compound question.
Q. In the 20th century, were there television commercials that advertised for cigarette products?
A. Not 1910.
Q. What?
A. Not in 1910. You said in the 20th century. Was there television?
Q. Was there television in 1910?
A. Did you say television?
Q. I did.
A. There wasn't any television in 1910.
Q. Okay. At any point in the 20th century, were there television advertisements for cigarettes?
MR. FEIWUS: At any point?
MR. GDANSKI: Yeah. I can ask my questions however way I'd like, and that's how I'm asking this one.
Q. If you can't answer it, that's fine. If you choose not to because it's -- I don't know why, but that's fine, too, but that's the
question.
A. From 1948, when the first television stations were publicly available to consumers, until 1971, there were television
advertisements for cigarettes.
Q. Thank you.
Throughout the course of the 20th century, at any point in time was there advertisements for cigarettes in the publicly available
print media, magazines or newspapers?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. Some newspapers chose not to use -- some periodicals chose not to use cigarette advertising, but for the most part, yes,
there was advertising.
Q. What you agree that the purpose of the advertisements was to market and sell more cigarettes?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. No, I would not agree.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
26David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. Why not?
A. The purpose was to try to get individuals to change brands. Most advertising is designed to get people to change brands.
Q. So the purpose of Eve cigarette advertisements was designed to get non-Eve smokers to switch to Eve cigarettes, correct?
A. Again, I'm not an advertising expert, and I don't want to go along this line, because I don't care about the specific cigarette
brand. That's immaterial to me.
Q. The purpose of any cigarette advertisement, then, is to get smokers to go to that brand of cigarettes from some other brand,
in your opinion, correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. Do you know when Eve cigarettes were first publicly made available?
A. Again, I'm not an expert in that, but I believe it was the early-'70s.
Q. Do you know who manufactures Eve cigarettes?
A. No, I don't.
Q. Do you know what an Eve cigarette looks like?
A. No.
Q. Have you ever seen an advertisement for an Eve cigarette?
A. No.
Q. Would you agree that cigarette advertisements make up the publicly available information regarding tobacco throughout
the 20th century?
A. I would agree that they are one part, but remember, my particular focus is on the publicly available information relating to
health hazards. Individuals do not get their health messages from cigarette ads.
Q. Are you familiar with any cigarette advertisements that had a health claim?
A. They did, and they were banned by 1955.
Q. So before 1955, there were cigarette advertisements that made health claims, correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection to form.
A. Often the health claims indicated that there were hazards of smoking.
Q. I assume you include those advertisements that indicate there are health hazards to smoking in your reliance materials, right?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
27David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
A. No.
Q. Of course not. Why not?
A. Because they are not credible sources. Individual ads are designed to sell products, not to provide health information.
Q. But they did provide health information, right?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. Until 1955, when the Federal Trade Commission banned it.
Q. Janice Katz was smoking before 1955, correct?
A. I don't know that.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
Q. Have you reviewed the medical records in this case?
A. No.
Q. Let's assume for a moment that Janice Katz did smoke cigarettes to some extent before 1955, correct -- okay?
A. I really can't assume that. I don't know when she smoked, and you want me to make an assumption based upon that which
is not evidence clearly in the testimony of the deponents.
Q. Can you tell me a specific point in time in which Janice Katz for sure smoked?
A. No, I can't.
MR. GDANSKI: I need to use the restroom. And I also, you know, don't understand how the witness does not know if she ever
smoked at any one point in time or if she ever smoked, but I'm going to take a break and use the restroom, okay? We can all
take a break for a second, I guess.
(A recess was taken.)
Q. Doctor, would you agree that cigarette companies are not credible sources when it comes to smoking and health matters?
A. I think that's a fair statement. Any --
Q. How much money have you --
A. Any manufacturer of any product in an advertisement must be viewed with, I think, some degree of suspicion. That's why
we have third-party ratings of products.
Q. Well, I'm talking about matters relating to life and death, smoking and -- smoking and death, people dying of serious
conditions. So would you agree that cigarette companies are not credible sources of information when it comes to smoking
and health?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
28David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
MR. STOEVER: Object to the form.
A. I would argue that cigarette companies and any other manufacturers of products are not credible sources of information
regarding their products, even if they may result in a life-and-death situation.
Q. Okay. Is that because the motivation for the company is to make a profit, right?
A. No. I think advertising is essentially a hyperbole. Advertising is puff. I've never found a Big Mac that's as big as the one you
see on television. And I think advertising is hyperbole. You have to look at it with suspicion.
Q. I didn't ask about advertisements. I'm asking as sources of health information, not just ads, but also the publicly made
statements, the publicly available statements regarding positions on smoking and health.
So are cigarette companies credible sources of information when it comes to matters of smoking and health?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. And as I indicated, manufacturers of any products relating to health and smoking have to be viewed with suspicion.
Q. How much money have you been paid for all of your work in tobacco litigation?
MR. FEIWUS: Object to the form.
A. Since the origin or in recent times? What would you -- what time frame?
Q. Since the origin of your work in this field.
A. Okay. Since 1995 until the present, I've been paid about $380,000.
Q. Is that from any one particular law firm or company, or is that in the aggregate?
A. Everything.
Q. How much money have you been paid in this case?
A. Less than $2,000.
Q. That's because you performed no additional historical research in this case, other than reading through the depositions,
correct?
A. That is correct. Except for today and review of materials in the last couple of days, that's correct.
Q. So the opinions you have in this case are exactly the same as the opinions you had in the Ferlanti case, correct?
A. I focused my opinion more narrowly, although I include what I've done in Ferlanti. Since we do not have any testimony
from Mrs. Katz, and since we have conflicting information regarding the smoking history from the deponents, I've chosen to
focus specifically on the materials, public information available regarding the health risks of smoking during the period of Mrs.
Katz's lifetime. So I have focused on that area.

29David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. How is that more narrow than what you did in Ferlanti?
A. I think in Ferlanti we talked with what specific awareness. In other words, the issue of awareness by Mr. Ferlanti. And we
talked with respect to common knowledge. And I think, while we can still talk about these issues with respect to my opinion,
because of the unique circumstances of this case, I chose to focus primarily on the publicly available information.
Q. You have no opinion as to what Janice Katz was aware of at any one point in time, correct?
A. I do not.
Q. And that is true with regard to all matters relating to smoking and health, both addiction, dependency, difficulty in quitting
and whether it causes any adverse health consequence, correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. Your opinions are entirely generic in that sense; they don't relate one way or the other to Janice Katz, correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. No. They relate specifically to Janice Katz in terms of her lifetime and what information was available to her regarding
publicly available to her during the period of her lifetime regarding smoking and health risks.
Q. Okay. They relate in Janice Katz in the same way they relate to anybody who was born in her decade and died in the same
decade in which she died, correct?
A. No.
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. No, I have geared these to her specific communities where she lived.
Q. When did Janice Katz move to Florida?
A. 1993.
Q. What information or research did you do after 1993 regarding the publicly available materials on smoking and health?
A. Very little. In 1993, she may not be smoking, according to the confusion in the deponents' testimony. And by that time, I
provided articles prior to 1993 in the south Florida area, just to show how extensive that material is.
Q. And you're not relying upon or going to comment on any television media in this case, correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. I don't understand that.
Q. Anything that appeared on television or in the movies?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
30David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
A. I don't understand that.
Q. Sure.
Are you going to use and rely upon anything at all that appeared on television or in the movies?
A. Well, of course, that's part of the information environment. This was part of the information environment that was available
to Janice Katz during the period of her lifetime and the communities that she lived.
Q. The reason I asked that question is because I have a CD here that is supposed to be the materials you relied upon, but there's
no -- there's no films, television segments or any clips from any movies on it.
MR. FEIWUS: I can clarify that. The materials -- the materials regarding stuff on movies or on news programs or on television
are identified in the reliance materials, but they're not on the CDs. We don't have them to put on the CDs. They're too voluminous
to reduce to CDs.
So if you're interested in getting any specific things, you know, let me know, but those materials -- I mean, there are -- there are
materials generally that he's relying on beyond what are in these 13 boxes. And, you know, there's a general font of knowledge
that forms his opinion, and we can't give you everything over a 50-year period of time that is relevant to his opinion.
So we've identified those things on the reliance list, but we can't give you all those things.
MR. GDANSKI: Yeah, well, I don't have -- I think you can appreciate that absent me getting them from you, I don't actually
have an opportunity to look at them, you know, and see what portions were included on the clip, what portion was excluded
from any movie, so --
MR. FEIWUS: Well, if he's relying on it, he's going to rely on it in total. I can't give you a library of, you know, all news
clipping -- all news programs for a ten-year period of time. It would be enormously -- it's like providing you with a library --
it's like asking a doctor to provide you with his library on cancer. It just can't be done.
MR. GDANSKI: No, it's not like that. It's not, and you know it's not.
MR. FEIWUS: Yes, it is. It's exactly like that. The professor will tell you that he relies on sources of information that he has
viewed in various different libraries or repositories and has access to but can't necessarily be put in his possession, custody
and control.
So he can't -- he can't deliver to you everything in the Library of Congress or everything at a particular repository or library. So
we've identified to the best we can, you know, materials that reflect his opinion, but I can't give you all the clips. I just can't.
MR. GDANSKI: If you're telling -- okay, if you're telling me now that when you call this witness, you're not going to, through
him, play any video or television clips, then I'll proceed.
If you're telling me otherwise, then I'm not going to proceed, because then I'm hearing that there are materials that you never
gave to me that he's relying upon that you're going to try to show to some jury later on. And so I'm going to ask for clarity
from the judge on that.
I mean, you know, you're telling me now he's relying on everything in the Library of Congress. I don't accept that. It's not fair.

31David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
MR. FEIWUS: Well, your experts also testified -- and I took Dr. Burn's deposition -- testified that there's a general font of
knowledge. Came to the deposition, he didn't bring his casebooks on cancer or his articles on cancer that exist in the public
record, but he's still relying on those things, and that's what Dr. DiBacco is doing.
So I'm not going to tell you -- I'm not going to give you my work product and tell you what I'm going to identify at trial, but
you will be given an exhibit list, and you will, within the contours of your rights, be shown whatever exhibits we plan to put
into evidence at the appropriate time.
But this is, you know, I can't give you an entire library of, you know, news programs or television programs that informed his
opinion. That's just impossible.
MR. GDANSKI: You know, I can't proceed with the deposition unless I know the materials that he's relying upon and you're
going to plan to utilize at trial to show to a jury that formed the basis for his opinion on common knowledge.
MR. FEIWUS: I've already --
MR. GDANSKI: It's just not fair.
MR. FEIWUS: All right. I've already --
MR. GDANSKI: It's different than Dr. Burns. He's not permitted to get up here and show a textbook that says, Cancer looks
like this. That's not permitted. You would object that it's bolstering and it would be sustained. And I wouldn't try to do it. You
are, though, going to try to, through this witness, show video clips, movies, newspapers, television clips from the '40s, '50s,
'60s, '70s and '80s, and I don't have those. And I don't know how you can expect me to ask questions about them.
MR. FEIWUS: Well, here's what I will --
MR. GDANSKI: In every other case, the other parties make CDs and have video clips. I just assumed you didn't have any.
MR. FEIWUS: All right, here's what I'm going to tell you. He's got 13 boxes of materials that he brought with him today. You
can ask him questions about it. You can ask him questions about the sources of his information, repository, what he relied on.
You can ask him about his reliance list, but I don't have to tell you, I don't have to reveal my work product to you and tell you
what 15-second clip I'm going to show Dr. DiBacco at trial. I just don't have to do that.
And you're asking for my work product, I'm not going to do that. You will get, at the appropriate time, an opportunity to look
at exhibits that we plan on putting into evidence. And you will, you know, be able to, you will have whatever opportunity you
have, and whatever rights you have.
But you're here to ask this witness about his opinion, his reliance materials, the sources of his information; you're not here to
ask him what exhibits I'm going to move into evidence at trial.
MR. GDANSKI: Come on. I'm not asking about the exhibits you're moving into evidence in trial. But I'm entitled to know which
television clips he is going to use. Are they going to be focused on women, are they going to be focused on men, which ones?
MR. FEIWUS: Look at the reliance list.
MR. GDANSKI: The reliance list doesn't indicate anything. It's just a -- it's a 41-page list of things that say, you know -- I mean --
MR. FEIWUS: Why don't you ask him some of these questions instead of asking me these questions.

32David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
MR. GDANSKI: Because I don't have an opportunity to look at any of the things that you're telling me he's relying upon.
MR. FEIWUS: Why don't you ask him what he's relying on, okay?
MR. GDANSKI: I've asked him.
Q. Doctor, are you relying upon television and movie clips for your opinions in this case?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you have those television and movie clips there with you today?
A. I have references to them in my box.
Q. No, not references. Do you have those television and movie clips there with you today for you and me to look at together?
MR. FEIWUS: I think we do have videotapes of materials here in the boxes.
THE WITNESS: We have a couple. We have a couple. There's one right there.
MR. FEIWUS: Yeah, we do have videotapes in the boxes.
Q. Can you tell me all the videotapes, television and movie clips that you have there with you today, please?
MR. FEIWUS: Well, there are 13 boxes of materials, so I can't do it. Maybe you can ask Tom if he can do it.
MR. GDANSKI: No, I'm asking him.
A. No, I don't have a listing of these. They are in here by reference. For example, there are PSAs mentioned, for example,
that -- Tony Curtis, PSA. There's a William Tolman, PSA. There is a clip from 30 Seconds Over Tokyo. I don't know whether
we're going to use those as exhibits.
There is a clip from Sweet Bird of Youth. There is a clip from Here to Eternity, clip from PSAs for the American Cancer Society
such as Smoke Out. But these are things that come to mind.
There are PSAs, movie clips. There's a See It Now clip from 1954. There is an NBC News special January 11, 1964. These are
some of these that are in the box and some of which we will use as exhibits.
MR. GDANSKI: I'm familiar with some of those, and some of those were just not provided to me in hard copies. I got a CD
or DVD that had a ton of things on it yesterday, and I'm prepared to take the deposition, but not with regard to things that
were not given to me.
I'm not asking for exact exhibits. I'm not asking for exact tape clips. I'm not asking for your PowerPoint slides. I'm simply
asking for what I'm entitled to, which is the materials that he's relying upon.
MR. FEIWUS: You can ask him --
MR. GDANSKI: I haven't seen them.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
33David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
MR. FEIWUS: You can ask --
MR. GDANSKI: And so I'm prepared to continue to take the deposition and to not ask questions about anything which was
not provided to me, or I can stop and you can get me the exact materials that would correspond to the list you gave me. But,
I can't do both.
MR. FEIWUS: Well, I'm just looking through the list, and on Page 7, I see that there are PSAs identified specifically with --
by ID number and exhibit. I see video news clips that are identified specifically by ID and exhibit number.
There are tons of materials on this reliance list that reflect video news broadcasts at different periods of time and different PSAs
and other things that appeared on television and in the movies, so why don't you go through it and ask him questions about it.
You've got -- you have a reliance list that identifies those things, and we've brought here today 13 boxes of materials that include
those videotapes. So, you know, don't tell me what you don't have when it's on the list.
MR. GDANSKI: Your list is fascinating, and I'm happy to have it, but you didn't give me the materials. You didn't give them
to me. You know, you just didn't. I don't have those corresponding clips, which is fine, but I don't have them. You didn't give
them to me.
Other defendants, when they have their witnesses, I get DVDs that have the clips, and I'm able to look at them and see what
portions are there, what portions are not there. Simply telling me, you know, on Page 7 -- I don't want to continue arguing.
I'd rather use my time, you know, usefully, to the extent that this is useful, but telling me Page 7 from PSA from whatever
date is meaningless to me.
And so, you know, Larry Hagman, It's a Snap, American Cancer Society video PSA means nothing to me unless I can see it.
And I can't see it.
MR. FEIWUS: Well, we -- as I said, we do have 13 boxes of materials here, so -- and I don't know what else to tell you.
Q. Doctor, did you include the Frank statement on your reliance list?
A. No.
Q. Why not?
A. Because the Frank statement had relevance only to the mouse experiments.
Q. The Frank statement was a publicly available piece of information, correct?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. Is that a yes?
A. Yes.
Q. Janice Katz could have seen that, correct?
A. I don't know.

34David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. Well, she could have, right?
A. She could.
Q. It discussed issues relating to smoking and health?
A. No, it did not. It dealt with mouse experiments. There was the painting of tar on mice, and it began the recent experiments
with mice.
Q. And it continues to discuss issues relating with smoking and health, correct?
A. Well, it argued that painting tar on the back of mice is not a direct relationship of smoking and health.
Q. Did it take a position as to whether or not smoking cigarettes caused lung cancer?
A. I don't think that was the issue at the time, but I'm not certain.
Q. Did it take a position as to whether or not smoking cigarettes caused adverse health consequences?
A. No.
Q. When was it published?
A. January 1954.
Q. Who published it?
A. It was published by, I believe, the Committee on Tobacco Research. And as I recall, Liggett was not a signatory to that.
Q. Why are you offering the fact that Liggett was not a signatory to that?
A. Well, I wanted to make as much information possible as I recall that ad.
Q. Was Philip Morris a signatory to that?
A. I believe so.
Q. What is the Committee on Tobacco Research?
A. It's a committee that was designed by the tobacco industry to promote research into the matters of tobacco and health.
Q. When was it formed?
A. I believe, in the 1950s, early 1950s.
Q. When was it disbanded?
A. It became the committee or Counsel For Tobacco Research, the CTR.

35David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. When was CTR disbanded?
A. I don't recall.
Q. When did Liggett become a member of CTR?
A. I don't know that.
Q. So you just know that they were not a member in 1954, right?
A. I know that there's -- that they --
MR. FEIWUS: I object as beyond the scope of his expertise.
A. The only thing I know is, they were conspicuous for not being part of the 1954 statement.
Q. What is the Tobacco Institute?
A. That's a trade association of tobacco and cigarette companies.
Q. When was that association founded?
A. I don't know the founding date. It was around in the 1950s.
Q. Was Liggett a part of that association?
A. I don't know.
Q. You don't know if at any point in time they were a part of it?
A. No, don't know.
Q. Do you know what the purpose was of the Tobacco Institute, outside of just being a trade organization?
A. No, I do not.
Q. Do you know if the Tobacco Institute had any PSAs which they published?
A. Any what?
Q. PSAs, public service announcements.
A. No, not to my knowledge.
Q. Did you include any statements of the Tobacco Institute on your reliance materials?
A. Only if it pertained to smoking and health. And it would be not included, because for the most part, they did not provide
smoking and health risk information.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
36David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. What type of information did they provide if they didn't provide smoking and health information?
A. I don't know. It was a trade group.
Q. Do they have representatives that spoke on behalf of the industry in the public media?
A. Again, I would refer to the answer to the question earlier, and that is that the tobacco industry, and that would include the
CTR, the Committee For Tobacco Research, the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, the Tobacco Institute, their particular
statements in the press were essentially very limited in terms of the space they got. So if they did, it was overwhelmed by the
information regarding smoking and health risks.
Q. That's not my question. My question is very simply, did the Tobacco Institute have individuals who spoke on their behalf
in the public media?
A. Yes, they did.
Q. What are the names of some of those individuals?
A. Timothy Hartnett was the individual who's probably the most prominent.
Q. Anybody else?
A. That's the only one I remember at this time.
Q. When did Timothy Hartnett work for the Tobacco Institute?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. In the 1950s, to the best of my knowledge.
Q. Are you familiar with anybody in the 1970s who would speak on behalf of the Tobacco Institute?
A. No.
Q. When did the American public become generally aware that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. The information relating to lung cancer was provided to the American public consistently beginning from about 1938 on,
and I can't answer your question as to whether people became aware.
The information grew, and if you asked in polls whether individuals had heard of this research which established a link, there
was a high percentage of Americans who had heard of this research. Whether they believed in it or not is difficult to measure.
Q. So you can't tell me any one point in time that the American public became generally aware that smoking cigarettes causes
lung cancer, correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
37David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
A. I can tell you that throughout the period of the 1930s and '40s and '50s and '60s, the information relating to the health risks
of smoking grew and were -- and became significant in terms of the American public.
Q. Do you have a date or a year or a general time frame in which it's your opinion that it was generally aware in the public
that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer?
A. There's no way to verify that. You are asking about what people believe. And that's a very difficult thing to do. You can
ask, Have you heard news reports that lung cancer is associated with smoking, and in the mid-1950s, Americans, by a majority,
had heard those reports.
Q. You're basing that on polling data, correct?
A. Polling data and stories that are done by feature writers who try to ascertain that through sample groups.
Q. Say that last part again, I'm sorry?
A. Feature writers and newspapers who, on their own initiative, try to sample the public.
Q. You're aware that the tobacco companies have commissioned polls relative to the subject of what people were aware of and
what people believed regarding smoking and health, correct?
A. No, because they were not in the news media.
Q. No, I'm not asking if you included it in your reliance materials. I know that you don't. I'm asking just simply whether or not
you are aware of the tobacco companies having commissioned such polls.
A. I didn't find that in my research.
Q. No, I know that. I'm asking if, at this point sitting here today, are you aware of that?
A. No.
Q. So you don't know one way or the other; you've never been asked a question or confronted with the issue of whether tobacco
companies commissioned polls on issues of smoking and health?
A. I've not done research on that, and I can't answer that question.
Q. So, they may not have done any polling; is that correct?
A. And they may have, I don't know.
Q. If they did do polling, would you be interested in such polling?
A. Only if it was available to the public and was covered in the press, and I didn't find that.
Q. Which polls did you include on your reliance list were available to the public to read and analyze?
A. A Gallup -- for the most part, Gallup.

38David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. What would Janice Katz have had to do to go in and look at a Gallup poll the same way you've done it in this case?
A. But I didn't use the Gallup poll as the basis for my opinion.
Q. So -- go ahead.
A. My opinion is not based upon the Gallup polls with respect to my opinion, but those polls were publicly available.
Q. So you're not relying upon the Gallup polls for purposes of your opinion?
A. I'm relying -- remember, I'm concerned about what information was available to the public. That's very difficult to quantify.
And some of the polls deal with belief, and therefore, that is not my concern. Some of the polls deal with whether or not you've
heard. I am concerned about that. So it depends upon the polls.
Q. My question is, what would Janice Katz have had to do to look at and study any of the polls that you're relying upon in
this case?
A. Read the newspapers.
Q. So the polls were actually in the newspapers --
A. Yes.
Q. -- the same way you're looking at them?
A. Yes.
Q. What newspaper article can you point me to here that shows the response to any one Gallup poll?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. I don't have it at my fingertip. I can look, but I don't have it. But they are covered. Gallop polls are covered periodically in
the press in this time period, just as they are polls with regard to public opinion about other issues today.
Q. Okay. So you're telling me that every one of the polls that you included on your reliance materials was covered in the
popular press?
A. It was in the form of a newspaper article, that's correct.
Q. How long would it take for you to find me one?
A. I can take a look.
Q. Well, I'd like for you to show me, for example, I don't know --
A. Do you have a number to it?
Q. I'm looking. Where are the polls in your reliance materials?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
39David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
A. I'd have to look in the box. I don't have the list, but let me look.
MR. FEIWUS: Do you want to look at my list?
THE WITNESS: I found one in here the other day, so...
MR. FEIWUS: You know, just so the record is clear, Jonathan, while you were examining the witness, I went through the 42-
page list that we have provided to you before the deposition, and there are voluminous amount of materials in here that are
movies and television programs and news reports around video PSAs, and they're all identified on here.
And we also provided to you what we received from Dr. DiBacco, three CD-ROMS containing electronic information, and we
produced for you here 13 boxes of materials which contained at least some videotapes and other types of video materials today
in compliance with your duces tecum requests.
So I just want the record to be clear that the prior characterization that you were not notified that this was something that Dr.
DiBacco was going to be relying upon is incorrect.
(Discussion off the record.)
THE WITNESS: I have a Gallop poll in 1949 and -- let me see what I've found here. Here is a Gallop poll, Mr. Gdanski, in
1941, conducted from November 1st to the 5th in 1949. Do you think cigarette smoking is harmful or not? 52 percent said
yes, 45 percent no.
Q. Okay.
A. I believe there are others in here, but I'm not certain.
Q. Yeah, let's back up. Let's move on.
A. Okay.
Q. Now, just with regard to that poll, was that poll cited in any newspaper article that you're aware of?
A. I believe it was, but I would have to recheck it in my files.
Q. After the deposition today, can you recheck and then send me the one specific article that you're referring to --
A. Yes.
Q. -- that references that poll?
A. It may not be that poll, but it will be some Gallop poll.
Q. No, I want to know about that poll.
A. I can look at it right now and see if it was referenced.
Q. Okay. I'm going to step out for a second.

40David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
MR. GDANSKI: We can go off the record.
(A recess was taken.)
THE WITNESS: I can't find it, Mr. Gdanski.
Q. Okay. Well, what is it you can't find?
A. I can't find the newspaper article. So, I do have the poll. And it came from -- Gallop has a compendium of polls called public
opinion, and that's where this came from.
Q. So do you agree that in 1949 -- sorry. Do you agree that in 1949, 45 percent of Americans did not believe that smoking
cigarettes had any adverse health consequences?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. Yes. According to this poll, that was the result.
Q. Is that your opinion? Do you share that opinion as far as what people believed at that point in time?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection. The witness has no -- lacks foundation.
A. As you know, my concern is what people -- what information is out there. I have no way to know what they know, so this
deals with knowledge.
Q. When did Janice Katz become aware that there was a connection between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection. Asked and answered.
A. I have no idea.
Q. When did the American public generally become aware that smoking cigarettes was addictive?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection. Asked and answered.
MR. GDANSKI: I didn't ask that.
MR. FEIWUS: You did. You asked all these questions already.
A. It's very difficult to indicate what the American people knew. I can tell you that the information relating to the habit-forming
nature of cigarettes is illustrated by popular culture in the term, nicotine fiend, nicotine fit. This goes way back in the early
20th century. This was part of the culture.
Textbooks in the early 20th century would write about the habit-forming nature of tobacco. The information grows and grows
and grows over time as to the difficulty of quitting smoking once begun.
Q. Do you agree that Janice Katz had long been aware of the health risks and addictive nature of cigarettes?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
41David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
A. Would you state that again?
Q. Sure. Do you agree or disagree that Janice Katz had long been aware of the health risks and addictive nature of cigarettes?
A. I don't know. I can tell you that information was widely disseminated in her communities regarding that.
Q. Have you seen your disclosure in this case?
A. I have.
Q. Who wrote that?
A. I did.
Q. Would you agree that in the 1960s, '70s and '80s, there were multiple messages in the public arena regarding the health
hazards of smoking?
A. I don't know what that means.
Q. Well, would you agree that in the 1960s, '70s, and '80s, there was a message out in the public that smoking cigarettes causes
lung cancer?
A. Yes.
Q. Would you also agree, to some extent in the '60s, '70s and '80s, there was a message in the public that it was not yet proven
that smoking cigarettes causes cancer?
A. There was a very miniscule amount of information that was being disseminated and was being picked up by the press, but
the overwhelming majority of the information pointed to the health risks of smoking and lung cancer.
Q. Without getting into the relative difference in the size of the amount of information and the quantity of information, there
were those two messages out there, correct?
A. Yes, but they were very different. The quantity is very important. The quantity --
Q. I understand.
A. The quantity is very important. To argue that someone is standing on a street corner and saying the world is flat is not to
suggest that this is an important message.
Q. Is that what the tobacco companies were doing, in essence, standing on a street corner saying the world was flat?
A. No, but their message was viewed with very little credible evidence.
Q. In your opinion, was their message as credible as standing on a street corner saying the world is flat?
A. No, I didn't mean to suggest that it was, but what I'm suggesting, it was treated in the same way by the press, and that is,
it's given very little press.

42David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. Did you include on your reliance materials, interviews in Nightline News or 20/20 where tobacco industry representatives
spoke on behalf of the industry?
A. Some of the See It Now clips, some of the ABC, CBS, NBC news specials would include tobacco representatives. And that
would be even as late as the surgeon general's report.
Q. What about after the 64 surgeon general's report?
A. There's some, but it diminishes.
Q. Did you include any of, you know, the Anne Browder television clips in your reliance materials?
A. No, I don't know what that's about.
Q. How about the Edward Horrigan interviews on Nightline news?
A. When?
Q. 1984.
A. No, I don't know anything about that, no.
Q. Do you know who Edward Horrigan is?
A. No.
Q. Did you include any of the Joseph Cullman interviews on television?
A. Of the Tobacco Institute?
Q. That's right.
A. In some of those, he was included, along with Timothy Hartnett, yes.
Q. Did you include the interview on television where he suggests that women might like to have small babies?
A. I don't recall that, no.
Q. Have you ever seen an interview with Mr. Cullman where he suggests that some women smoke cigarettes because they
might want to have a small baby?
A. No.
Q. Do you think an interview like that that appeared in the public media, something that Janice Katz could have seen; is
something you should include in your reliance material?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
43David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
A. Again, I go to my argument that here's the stack of information about the health risks. The information coming from the
tobacco industry is given little press.
Q. Did you exclude any information from the tobacco industry?
A. I don't know what that means. If it were in the press -- if it were in the press and it dealt with smoking and health, yes,
it was considered.
Q. And you would include that as something you relied upon, right?
A. Yes, absolutely. And that's why I argue that the information with regard to the third-party sources coming out in terms of
smoking and health risks, as compared to that of the tobacco industry, there's a great discrepancy, far more for the third party,
very little for the tobacco industry.
Q. Can you define common knowledge, please?
A. Well, common knowledge, is an art form among historians, would suggest that information is so widely disseminated and
for so long a period of time that it becomes part of the culture. That is, you don't have to explain it.
Q. When was it common knowledge that smoking cigarettes was habit forming?
A. Well, again, I think it's -- you can't place a -- you're dealing with belief with common knowledge for many, many people.
I think it's a confusing point for individuals outside of the profession.
For people outside the profession, it's belief, and that isn't what common knowledge is designed to emphasize. It's designed to
show how widespread information is on a certain point. Whether you believe it or not, that's difficult to ascertain.
Q. And you don't have any opinions on belief, correct?
A. No.
Q. What percentage of Americans, when Janice Katz began smoking, had heard that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer?
A. I don't know when she began smoking.
Q. Let's assume that her husband's recollection is correct. When would she have begun smoking then?
A. In her teenage years.
Q. So, what percentage of Americans in Janice Katz's teenage years had heard that cigarettes causes lung cancer?
A. Again, I don't know if polls, except for this one that I just pointed out, in which -- this really measures belief. I don't know
if polls would have suggested that the information was heard. But the information relating to smoking and lung cancer was
growing enormously in the 1950s, beginning with the research of Wynder and Graham.
Q. Okay, and -- go ahead, sorry.
A. That's all right.

Continuing through the seven experts' report in 1957.
Q. What year was Janice Katz born again?
A. 1931.
Q. If she started smoking in her teens, that's around the mid-'40s, right?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. By the Wynder and Graham studies in the mid-'50s, she'd be smoking for ten years, right?
MR. FEIWUS: Well, object to the form. Why do you say that the Wynder and Graham studies are in the 1950s? There's a 1950
Wynder and Graham study, so what are you talking about?
Q. I thought you were referring to the mouse painting study.
A. No, they did an article for the New England Journal of Medicine in the 1950s, which pointed to the association between
lung cancer and smoking.
Q. All right. And she would have already been smoking at that point in time; is that correct?
A. If that assumption is -- this is an assumption, yes.
Q. What studies were available for Janice Katz to read at the time she began smoking as a teenager that would have informed
her of the association between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer?
A. Well, she would have been informed -- she went to school in New York State, in Brooklyn. New York State passed laws, as
did most other states, in the late 19th century, requiring the teaching of students about the health risks of smoking. And some
of these early texts in schools did talk about adverse affects in terms of the lungs. So as a high school --
Q. What study -- sorry.
A. As a high school student, she could have been exposed to these.
Q. My question is specific to lung cancer. Which studies would have been available for Janice Katz to see and to read when
she began smoking in her teens that discussed the association between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer?
MR. FEIWUS: Object to the form.
A. Okay. There are several studies that get great, great publicity in the 1950s. First of all, there's the Wynder and Graham New
England study in 1950.
In 1952, there's the Doll and Hill report in Great Britain about the relationship of smoking and health, which gets enormous
publicity throughout the United States and the world.
In 1954, two researchers for the American Cancer Society, Cuyler Hammond and Daniel Horn began a study of 187,000
veterans. And that shows the relationship of smoking and lung cancer. That got enormous respect. Published in the -- in fact,

45David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
so much so, that when the American Medical Association was convening in San Francisco in that year, they presented their
report, even though it had not been finished, and it was front-page news in terms of their findings.
In 1957, seven experts reported their findings that showed the relationship of smoking and lung cancer. And then the final point,
which is probably the most significant, is that on July 12, 1957, Surgeon General Leroy Burney announced that as far as the
public health service was concerned, the relationship of smoking and lung cancer was clear. His statement was sent to every
public health officer in the United States and it got enormous publicity.
Q. Okay. My question, though, was with regard to when Janice Katz began smoking in the mid-'40s. What information was
available to her to read, see, study and analyze that discussed the association or the causation between smoking cigarettes and
lung cancer?
A. As I indicated to you, if she started to smoke in her teens, she was born in 1931, that would mean that she would be exposed,
if she started at this time, to the first Wynder and Graham study in 1950, and if she continued as an adult, the other studies
I just mentioned.
Q. So she'd be 19 in 1950, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Let's assume for a minute she started smoking in 1945, okay?
A. Okay.
Q. What information was available to her that discussed the association between lung cancer and smoking cigarettes?
MR. FEIWUS: Object to the form.
A. I think, information would be in popular culture. She was probably around to hear, Smoke Smoke Smoke That Cigarette,
which was the number one tune in 1947, '48, which would have shown the deleterious effects of smoking and death. The
relationship of smoking and death.
She may well have heard in her -- read in her textbooks -- as a high school student, the work of Alton Oschner, who did a
surgery in 1919 at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis, in which he found cancer of the lung in a smoker. That was also widely heard.
In 1938, Raymond Pearl did a study of smokers and longevity for the Johns Hopkins University, and it showed high mortality
rate in terms of lung cancer between smokers and nonsmokers.
Q. Again, my question is very specific to lung cancer, not mortality or adverse health consequences. So the only one that you
can point to is a 1919 surgery study by Dr. Oschner?
MR. FEIWUS: I object --
Q. Is that right?
MR. FEIWUS: I object to your characterization of his testimony.
A. No, I think when you talk about lung cancer, you're also talking about the next stage of death, which is quite common. I
think the relationship is identified.

46David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. How many people have died from smoking cigarettes in the 20th century?
A. I have no idea.
Q. What's the estimate on the yearly death associated with smoking cigarettes?
A. I don't know.
Q. You haven't come across those numbers in any of the material you've reviewed?
A. No. There are PSAs, particularly in this state, in New York, which point out how many people die in New York City. I saw
one the other day at several thousand. I have no way to pinpoint specifics.
Q. So you don't know how many people died of tobacco-related deaths in 1992, do you?
A. No, I do not.
Q. 1982?
A. No, I do not.
Q. Have you ever read any of the testimony of any of the plaintiff's historians in this case?
A. No, I don't know of any plaintiff's historians.
Q. Would you agree that there was significantly more smoking and health-related information in 1980 than there was in 1950?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. I would agree.
Q. Would you agree there was significantly more smoking and health-related information in 1970 than in 1940?
A. I would agree that it grows, but the information in 1940 and 1950 is on an upward rise.
Q. That's the point, it rises upward, correct?
A. Absolutely.
Q. So, for example, today, there's a lot more known publicly about smoking and health and society understands a lot more
generally about smoking and health than they did in 1950, correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. I would say that in the 1950s, there was popular culture. That popular culture was widespread about the adverse affects of
smoking. The popular culture, which often precedes medical findings.

47David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
In other words, people may make conclusions long before medical doctors make theirs. And in the 1950s, the idea of smoking
as deleterious was a very significant part of the culture.
What happened in the 1950s and '60s and '70s is, you added medical reports to substantiate popular culture, which identified
cigarettes as coffin nails as early as the 1980s. And this is not unusual in terms of looking at public awareness. Public awareness
often precedes medical findings.
Q. Would you agree that in the 1940s and '50s, cigarettes were, in some mediums, depicted as romantic or cool or an attractive
thing to do?
A. I think that cigarettes in ads and movies and in other forms were depicted in that fashion. At the same time, individuals were
also given information through popular culture about their adverse effects.
Q. And you are familiar with the examples of cigarettes being depicted as romantic or the cool thing to do, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You would agree, of course, that some people may have begun smoking cigarettes as a result of the way they were depicted
in popular culture, as cool or sexy or a fun thing to do, correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. The research that I've seen, which has been published in the newspapers and magazines, suggest that many, many people
began to smoke because their friends smoked. When advertising takes effect, pictures, in the movies, I'm not qualified to answer
that.
Q. Do you have a chapter on advertising in your American history textbook?
A. I don't have a chapter on advertising. I have a section on it within a chapter.
Q. You have a section on it, correct?
A. I have a section, yes, sir.
Q. What are the conclusions in that section on the effects of advertising?
A. I don't know. I didn't write that part, so I'd have to look at that.
Q. It's your textbook, though, right?
A. It's my textbook with two other people. I take the blame for the good things; I don't take the blame for the bad things. But
there is a section on that in the textbook.
Now, that also relates to advertising when it was first used. And it's a very different culture than today. When advertisers used
advertising in the 1860s and '70s and '80s, they had a culture which was unprepared for it.
That isn't the case as time goes on. Americans become very sophisticated about advertising. They recognize that a lot of it is puff.
Q. Americans are a lot more sophisticated about advertising today than they were in the 1930s and '40s, correct?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
48David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
A. No. I would say they're probably more sophisticated in the 1930s than they were in the 1980s. I think the degree of
sophistication from the '30s to today is relatively little. It's fairly sophisticated.
Q. I'm sorry. You're saying that Americans were more sophisticated when it comes to weighing advertisements in the '30s than
they were in the '80s?
A. No, I'm saying they're about the same. I think it's just refined very little. I think the great period of advertising came to an
end in terms of puff with the Federal Trade Commission in 1913, so...
Q. Okay. And you're familiar with advertisements from tobacco companies in the '30s, '40s and '50s, where movie stars or
athletes would market cigarette products, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You're familiar with advertisements where doctors would be shown as smoking cigarettes, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You're familiar with advertisements which had a tag line of, More doctors smoke a certain cigarette than any other brand,
correct?
A. Yes, which it was probably true. It was Camels. Since it was a leading cigarette, it wasn't a lie.
Q. Do you know the background as to why or how RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company was able to make a claim that more doctors
smoked their cigarettes than any other cigarette?
A. No, I don't.
Q. You've seen cigarette advertisements with Ronald Reagan, right?
A. Yes, I have.
Q. Santa Claus?
A. Absolutely.
Q. Babies?
A. No, I've never seen one with babies.
Q. Okay. And all those advertisements were available publicly for consumers to see, correct?
A. Right, and also to be skeptical of.
Q. Can you point to any one of the school textbooks on your reliance list that Janice Katz for sure saw?
A. No.

49David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. Do you know what school textbooks were used in her school?
A. No.
Q. Do you know exactly what message she received in her health education class in the 1930s?
MR. FEIWUS: I'll object to the form.
A. No.
Q. Was smoking cigarettes allowed in elementary schools in the 1930s?
A. No.
Q. How do you know?
A. Because of the state laws of the -- New York.
Q. Would it be uncommon for a teacher during recess or on the playground to smoke cigarettes?
A. Usually in the teachers' room that was done.
Q. So the teachers, they would go to the teachers' room and smoke their cigarettes there, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Right after class sometimes, right?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. It varied by state. I don't know in terms of how this differed from state to state.
Q. Do you know if Eve cigarettes were ever marketed in any movies or television shows?
A. No.
Q. Do you know if Eve cigarettes were marketed to a certain segment of American society?
A. No, I'm not a specialist in advertising of certain cigarette brands.
Q. When is the first textbook that you have that Janice Katz could have seen that described cigarettes as being addictive?
A. Do you want me to point to one?
Q. I want to go home. And I think you do, too, to your nice apartment on the -- in midtown. So if it's going to take you more
than five minutes --
A. No, I don't think it will take me more than five minutes --

50David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. Just so it's clear, I'm asking a specific question. I don't want you to come back with a textbook that says smoking cigarettes
is hard to stop. The question is with regard to the word, addictive, okay?
A. No. It would be habit-forming. The word used in the 1930s and '40s and '50s, would be habit-forming.
Q. So you're not familiar with any textbook that Janice Katz could have possibly seen that says smoking cigarettes is addictive,
correct?
A. No. This is an anachronism. You would not have seen that in the 1930s and '40s. In other words, the term addiction was not
referenced in terms of smoking and cigarettes until well after the 1950s. The word was habituation or habit-forming.
Q. Would you agree that the words addiction and habit are different?
A. I'm not an expert in -- I'm not an -- I'm not expert in this field of medicine. I'm not a medical doctor.
Q. I'm not saying from a medical perspective. I'm saying from a public awareness. The public being aware of something being
habit-forming is different than the public being a aware of something being addictive, correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. Again, you're asking me to put on my hat as an expert, and I'm not a medical expert. If you want a response in terms of what
the popular culture would perceive, I would argue that if you say habit-forming and addiction, those terms were interchangeable
for many people in the 1950s, '60s and '70s.
Q. Did the tobacco companies in the 1960s, '70s or '80s acknowledge that smoking cigarettes was addictive?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. Again, I'm not an expert on tobacco industry conduct.
Q. Are you familiar with any publicly available information at any point in time, in which any tobacco company or their
representative organizations ever publicly acknowledged and stated that cigarettes are addictive?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. I'm not aware of that.
Q. Are you familiar with any publicly available information which any tobacco company or its representatives or trade group
speaking on the company's behalf ever publicly acknowledged that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. Again, I'm not an expert in specific companies and what they do, no.
Q. But I'm saying, as far as what was publicly out there and publicly available, you've never seen any statement by the tobacco
companies or their representatives that smoking cigarettes was addictive or causes lung cancer publicly, correct?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
51David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
A. No, I would say that the cigarette companies, beginning in the late-'90s, accepted the medical consensus regarding lung cancer
and smoking. You're using the term, causes. The medical consensus term is the term that's used by the company or companies.
Q. Okay. So starting in the late-'90s, they accepted the medical consensus on the association between smoking cigarettes and
lung cancer, correct?
A. That was the association that I -- yes.
Q. So at any point in Janice Katz's lifetime, from birth to death, are you familiar with any publicly available statement by any
tobacco company in any publicly available medium that said, either smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, causes any adverse
health consequence or is addictive?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Let's repeat that one more time. Can you repeat it for me?
Q. Sure.
(The question was read.)
A. Again, I think this is so broad a statement with respect to her lifetime. I would say that she may well have been, as part of
her life, part of the information environment relating to the medical consensus statement, but I'm not sure whether she would
have, I don't know.
Q. Well, that was in the late '90s, correct?
A. Right. And she died in '98, so --
Q. And you said --
A. So, I don't know. It could be. She could have been.
Q. Let me ask the question a little bit differently, then.
A. Okay.
Q. Because you have a fair point there. Same question, but not from birth to death, from birth to diagnosis of lung cancer, okay?
A. 1996.
Q. The question is, from any date from her birth until the diagnosis of lung cancer, are you familiar with any statement publicly
available, made in any public medium, by any tobacco company or their representative organization which said, either that
smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, causes any adverse health consequence or is addictive?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. Again, I never came across that in my research. That's it.

52David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. I'm just looking through -- I'm trying to wrap up. You've been deposed many times, so, you know, I'm not going to go through
every single thing you've ever been asked, but you have some things in your reliance list from Bergen County newspapers?
A. Yes.
Q. Did Janice Katz live in Bergen County?
A. No, but I put those in there because I wanted to have as wide an information environment to suggest that this isn't only in
New York City or Long Island. There are in Philadelphia. I have Philadelphia Inquirer newspapers.
Q. Did Mr. Ferlanti live there?
A. Again, I did it for the same purpose. I wanted to expand the net.
Q. Would you agree that to some extent, however slight, tobacco companies' message and position regarding smoking and
health had an affect on the American public perception?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. No, I would not. I think the -- it is -- that message is hard to find. It's not widely disseminated. I think -- I would not agree.
Q. Are you aware of any evidence to suggest that while the tobacco companies publicly maintained that their product did not
cause any adverse health consequence or was not addictive, they had any internal knowledge that it was, in fact, causing adverse
health consequences and was, in fact, addictive?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. No, I'm not aware of that.
Q. Would you be interested, as a human being, to know whether or not, while the tobacco companies publicly maintained that
their product did not cause any harm at all and was not addictive, they knew internally for a fact that it did cause harm and
was, in fact, addictive?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection. I don't understand what you mean by as a human being. He's offering expert testimony here. You
can ask him about his opinions. Are you asking him a moral question? I mean --
Q. Yeah, I'm asking you morally, does your conscience compel you to know what these companies knew?
A. The information that is so widespread, so abundant, so disseminated would not in any way make what the tobacco industry
does or didn't do significant. It was insignificant.
Q. So you're not interested in knowing what they really knew, because it wouldn't have mattered?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. No. That information came out when the internal documents were disclosed. And my argument to you today is, whatever
that information, as it was disclosed, would not have in any way affected the message which is so voluminous about the health
risks of smoking, that it wouldn't have in any way modified what the public health authorities said.

53David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. Is that an opinion that you hold in this case?
A. My opinion is that the information, it was publicly available about the health risks of smoking concerning disease, death,
addiction was voluminous in the communities where Janice Katz lived throughout her life.
Q. Right, I understand that. Is it also your opinion that the information that the tobacco companies had, whatever it was, would
not have at all affected the public awareness, because the public awareness was so dramatic at that point?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection. Are you asking him a hypothetical, in a counterfactual world, that information the tobacco companies
had, whatever it might have been, was different and disseminated into the public, that it would have changed? I mean, I don't
understand the question.
MR. GDANSKI: Well, that's okay if you don't understand it.
Q. Doctor, I'll just ask it again.
A. I don't.
Q. Is it your opinion in this case that had the tobacco companies disclosed whatever internal information they had, it would
not have made a difference on public awareness?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. That's a hypothetical I can't answer. I deal with whatever information is out there.
Q. Okay.
A. I can't deal with that.
Q. Sure. What books have you read discussing the issues of smoking and health and of historical analysis between smoking
and health?
A. They Satisfy, by Robert Sobel.
Q. Sorry, say it again. Sorry.
A. They Satisfy, by Robert Sobel; Cassandra Tate, T-A-T-E, The Cigarette Wars. I read Richard Kluger's book. Those three
come to mind.
Q. What's the name of Richard Kluger's book?
A. Ashes to Ashes.
Q. Do you own a copy of that book?
A. I have it in my library.
Q. You've read it, correct?

54David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
A. I've read it years ago.
Q. Have you ever read The Cigarette Papers, Stanton Glanz's book?
MR. GDANSKI: S-T-A-N-T-O-N, G-L-A-N-Z.
A. No, I have not read the book.
Q. Have you ever heard of that book?
A. I've heard of the book.
Q. Do you know what it's about?
A. I do not.
Q. Have you read Allan Brandt's book, The Cigarette Century?
A. I have read material by Mr. Brandt or Dr. Brandt. I have not read that book.
Q. What material have you read by Dr. Brandt?
A. He's a -- there is a museum in Washington D.C., which is on the campus of Walter Reed Hospital devoted to health issues,
and Allan Brandt has a number of exhibits there. And I went to that a couple years ago and saw it.
Q. Exhibits on what subject matter?
A. Smoking and health.
Q. What was the purpose of his display or of his exhibit room?
A. Well, he was very critical of, as I recall, the cigarette companies.
Q. For doing what?
A. Well, I don't recall. In terms of certainly the product they produced. That's what I recall.
Q. Would you agree that the cigarette companies undertook a campaign of disinformation relative to issues of smoking and
health?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. That's a matter of industry conduct, and my argument is, if they did, it had very little effect in terms of getting in the press.
Q. Would you agree that the Surgeon General of the United States is an authoritative source of information when it comes to
matters of smoking and health?
A. He's one of the many sources, but he is certainly one of the authoritative sources, absolutely.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
55David KATZ as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537162...
Q. Who are the other authoritative sources when it comes to matters of smoking and health?
A. American Cancer Society, which is very old, founded in 1913; the American Lung Association, which is called by another
name; National Respiratory and Tuberculosis Association; American Medical Association. There's an American Thoracic
Association of doctors. There are many subspecialties, but the Surgeon General is certainly one of these.
Q. Would you agree that Dr. Brandt is an authoritative source of information for smoking and health matters?
A. I don't know. I would have to have more information about his peer review status.
Q. Well, would you agree that Ashes to Ashes is a generally reliable source of historical information on the subject matter?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. No, I think it's an opinion piece. Mr. Kluger won a Pulitzer Prize for his previous book on the Vietnam War, I believe. No,
I think it is -- I think it is a book, but I am -- it's not definitive.
Q. But is it a reliable book?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. I wouldn't rely upon it from the standpoint of my reliance list.
Q. No, I understand that you don't rely upon it. I'm asking, is it a, you know, in the field, a reliable book?
MR. FEIWUS: Reliable for what?
Q. Is there any reason to doubt the accuracy of the book?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. Oh, yes. Yes, absolutely. There's a great deal of controversy in that book, as there is with Dr. Brandt's writings. That's why
I did not refer to them. I referred to Surgeon General, American Cancer Society, et cetera.
Q. Do you agree that The New York Times is considered a paper of record?
A. Record of what?
Q. Paper of record, to look to as to what the major issues discussed in this country were?
A. That depends upon what you're looking for. If you're looking for editorial opinion, the answer is no. If you're looking for
widespread coverage, the answer is yes. If you're looking for local news, the answer is probably no.
Q. But for purposes of widespread national issues, you would agree, it's a paper of record, correct?
A. Widespread national issues, excluding editorial areas in terms of coverage, I would agree that that's probably so for the
period of the 1940s and '50s and '60s and '70s and '80s. The New York times has cut back dramatically, and I think it's hurt
the quality of the paper.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit 5, Two invoices, marked for identification, as of this date.)
Q. When did warnings first go on cigarette packages?
A. January 1, 1966.
Q. What was the first warning?
A. Caution, cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health.
Q. So it was not a warning, right?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. That's a warning. It's a caution sign.
MR. FEIWUS: You're saying, it's not a warning because it doesn't use the word “warning”? What's your question? Why are
you --
Q. The future references said, Warning, correct?
A. No, not the ones after October 12, 1985 to the present. Before rotating, I don't think they say warning, but whatever -- it's
a cautionary, warning note, the first one, January 1, 1966.
Q. When was the second set?
A. November 1, 1970, it said, Warning: The Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health.
Q. And for how long did that remain on packages?
A. October 11, 1985.
Q. What types of warnings were those?
A. Excuse me?
Q. What type of warnings? Was it one consistent warning?
A. Well, no. You said how long did it remain in effect, and I said October 11, 1985. Now what --
Q. Right, in '85, what happened?
A. October 12, 1985, there were four rotating warnings.
Q. What were they?
A. One of them said, Cigarette smoking causes lung disease, lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema and may complicate
pregnancy. The second warning said, Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risk to health. The third one said, Smoking

by pregnant women may lead to fetal injury, low birth weight and may complicate pregnancy. And the fourth one said, Cigarette
smoke may contain carbon monoxide.
Q. Are those warnings currently on?
A. Yes.
Q. Is there going to be a rotation or change in those warnings soon?
A. Not to my knowledge.
Q. Do you have any opinions about any specific tobacco company's voluntary warnings on any packages of cigarettes anywhere
in the world?
A. No.
Q. Do you have any opinions about any one specific tobacco company's position at any point in time regarding cigarette and
health matters?
A. No.
Q. Do you know in how many cases you are currently listed as a witness for the tobacco companies?
A. Only this one.
Q. Have you been called or contacted by any law firm to testify or even review any case other than this one?
A. No.
Q. Who contacted you regarding this case?
A. Mr. Feiwus.
Q. Who have you spoken to regarding this case other than Mr. Feiwus?
A. His assistant, Ms. Kaschel.
Q. Anybody else?
A. My wife.
Q. Does your wife do work for you or help you work in this regard?
A. She used to, but she does not anymore.
Q. What have you talked to your wife about in this case?
A. Just that I have this case. I didn't discuss the details.

Q. Are you opposed to working in any other tobacco cases at this time?
A. Excuse me?
Q. In other words, is there a reason this is the only case? Have you turned down other tobacco cases?
Have you been requested to look at other tobacco cases and said no, or is this the only case they've approached you about?
A. No, I haven't been asked. I'm retired.
Q. Retired from what?
A. Major work. I occasionally do cases.
Q. Well, like, if tomorrow someone from Shook Hardy came to you and said they wanted you to work on a case, you would
say yes or no?
A. I don't know.
Q. What would be the reasons for you to say yes, what would be the reasons for you to say no?
MR. FEIWUS: Objection.
A. Well, I plan to do some traveling. I'd have to ascertain all of those factors.
MR. GDANSKI: I don't have any other questions for you today. I appreciate it.
MR. FEIWUS: Okay. Thank you.
MR. GDANSKI: You know what, one second, I just want to be clear.
Q. Can you take out your disclosure there for a second? Sorry. Do you have your disclosure there with you?
A. Yes.
Q. Is that an unmarked copy of your disclosure?
A. Yes.
Q. Can you just turn to your section in the disclosure, please?
A. Okay.
Q. Do the opinions expressed in this disclosure accurately reflect the opinions you're going to give at the trial in this case?
A. I've changed my focus with respect to the opinion. When I took this case, I didn't realize that there would be disagreement
with respect to when Mrs. Katz smoked or didn't smoke. And so the focus that I have in this case will be to look at the information
that was disseminated regarding the health risks of smoking, in terms of the lifetime of Mrs. Katz.

And while I will perhaps concentrate on the issue of awareness and common knowledge, those are secondary to the focus with
respect to Mrs. Katz's information available.
Q. I'm not sure what that means. Are there any opinions that you have in this case that we've not talked about today?
A. No.
Q. We've gone over all the opinions you hold; is that right?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you have any depositions scheduled in the next 60 or 90 days?
A. No.
Q. Do you have any vacations planned, scheduled in the year 2011?
A. Yes.
Q. During what period of time?
A. Mostly, I'm told that this case now has a new trial date, but essentially, the first three months of the year 2011.
Q. Where are you going?
A. Italy.
MR. GDANSKI: For three months, enjoy. Thank you for today and your time, I appreciate it.
THE WITNESS: You're welcome.
MR. GDANSKI: Now I do not have any more questions for you.
MR. FEIWUS: Okay, great.
Any questions from the folks on the phone?
MR. BIDEAU: None from me. This is Mark.
MR. STOEVER: None from Tom Stoever.
MR. BIDEAU: None from me.
