And we'll proceed.

Do
you, by any chance, have it in front of you?

Q.

You've got it in front of

7 A. Yes, I do.
8 Q. Where did you attend college?
9 A. I attended the University of Minnesota
10 for my B.A. degree, then went to the University
11 of Wisconsin at Madison for my M.A. and Ph.D.
12 in History.
13 Q. Okay.
14 A. It was in History.
15 Q. And how about your B.A.?
16 A. Same thing.
17 Q. And what was your -- did you write a
18
What did you get a B.A. in?
thesis?
19 A. Yes, I did.
20 Q. What was your thesis?
21 A. It was on tax revolts during the 1930s
22
23
24
25
during the Great Depression.
Q.
And what did that entail, that type of
research?
A.
212-279-9424
Oh, it entailed a fair number of
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
212-490-3430Page 9
1 interviews with some people that were still
2 surviving from the period, going through all
3 the Chicago newspapers, which were, like, four
4 or five dailies at that time, looking at court
5 records.
6 entailed.
7
Q.
Those were some of the things it
When you were -- when you were in your
8 undergraduate program and later in your
9 graduate program at the University of
10 Wisconsin, were you taught different historical
11 or different methods for doing research in
12 history?
13 A. Yes, I was.
14 Q. Can you describe for me what various
15 methods you were taught or used to do your
16 research?
17
18
MS. LAWSON:
A.
19
20
Sure.
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
You can answer.
Well, the main method would be -- the
21 historical method I would use would be, first,
22 you try to find out as much as you can about a
23 topic by reading the secondary sources, what
24 other historians have written about the topic.
25 All right.
212-279-9424
Then, you try to frame some sort of
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
212-490-3430Page 10
1 question, research question.
In some sense,
2 you may want to even start with that, but
3 probably it's best in some ways to read the
4 secondary stuff.
5 From there, you go to the actual raw
6 material of history, the primary sources, you
7 know, things like newspapers, letters, court
8 records from the period, that kind of thing.
9 Then, you do as much research as you can on
10 that until you feel you've got a good picture
11 of the situation, you know, a good sense of how
12 to answer your starting question, and then you
13 start writing.
14
Q.
What was your -- I'm not familiar with
15 tax revolts of the '30s, but what was your
16 conclusion in that?
17 was your premise, and what was your conclusion
18 of --
19
20
MS. LAWSON:
Q.
21
Well, first of all, what
Object to form.
-- that particular type of research?
MS. LAWSON:
Same objection.
22 A. Okay.

24 information, Ms. Lawson or any of the other
25 lawyers are allowed to interpose objections to

6 can ask me to rephrase it, and I'll try to
7 clarify it.

A.
Unless you're
If you don't understand what I've
Sure.
As a historian, I was aware of
key tax revolts in America, such as the Whiskey
10 Rebellion in the 18th Century, and I always
11 wondered if you had things like that happening.
12
Later, a fellow graduate student
13 called this to my attention that there were tax
14 revolts, tax limitations, tax strikes, tax
15 protests, because you had a big budgetary
16 crisis, especially at the local level, in the
17 1930s.
18 even at that time it was a very relevant issue,
19 so it was a good opportunity for a historian to
20 delve into it.
21 I got a book out of it.
22
23
24
25
Q.
Nobody had written about it.
I thought
And it ended paying off because
That's nice.
What's the title of the
book?
A.
Taxpayers in Revolt:
Tax Resistance
During the Great Depression.
212-279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

212-490-3430Page 12

Q.
Now, when I think of a revolt, I think
2 of people in the streets and, you know,
3 demonstrating, or were people demonstrating
4 during the tax revolts of the '30s?
5
6
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
Yes, there were.
There were some big
7 protests.
You had a lot of this take the form
8 of people just voting in tax limitation
9 amendments into their state constitutions.
10 Then, one place was Chicago where I focused on
11 quite heavily where you had a tax strike, and
12 that was an organization that urged taxpayers
13 not to pay their local property taxes in
14 protest of the way they were being levied.
15 that went on for a couple of years.
And
16 Q. Where were you born, by the way?
17 A. I was born in Minneapolis.
18 Q. So this was -- you attended schools in
19
your home state?
20 A. Yes, uh-huh.
21 Q. All right.
22
23
And how long did it take
you to complete your masters program?
A.
Oh, let's see.
I believe it took --

So the M.A. merged with your doctoral;
10 you had to complete the M.A. class work and
11 then --
12
A.
It was class work, and it would
13 involve some research papers and things.
14 didn't actually do an M.A. thesis.
15
Q.
I've got you.
All right.
But I
And your
16 Ph.D. was ultimately published.
Is it in a
17 book form or just housed in a library
18 somewhere?
19 A.
A little bit of both maybe.
It was
20 published by University of North Carolina press
21 in 1989, and a few people bought it.
22 Q. Now, where do you currently work?
23 A. I'm at the University of Alabama.
24 Q. And what are you teaching there?
25
Well, before I ask that question, after you got

1
your Ph.D., did you go to work as a historian?
2 A. Yes, I did.
3 Q. And where was that?
4 A. Several different places.
5 Q. Let's start from the latest and go to
6
7
the earliest.
A.
Okay.
Well, since 1994, I've taught
8 at the University of Alabama.
Before that, I
9 was at a research institute at George Mason
10 University, and I also taught part time there.
11 And before that, I was at the University of
12 Nevada at Las Vegas.
13 the same research institute at George Mason
14 University and taught a little bit there as
15 well.
16
17
Q.
Okay.
And before that, I was at
You said you were at UNLV; is
that what I understood you to say?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. Good basketball.
20 A. Yeah, it was the Tarkanian era when I
21 was there.
22 Q.
That's excellent.
So, when you
23 graduated your Ph.D. program, you went to
24 George Mason Think Tank?
25
A.
212-279-9424
It's an institute that is affiliated
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

Were you paid to work there?
Were you given a stipend?
A.
Yes, I was given a stipend, a
fellowship.
21 Q. In Virginia, right?
22 A. Yeah, yeah, Fairfax.
23 Q. Now, I'm flipping through your CV.
24 You'll have to forgive if I've missed it, but I

5 A. It's the first page.
6 Q. Oh, academic experience, I see it,
7 okay.
So, back in '83, '84, you were a

12 A. Yes, yes.

It was American Diplomatic History.
And '86 to '88, you were at the Humane
Studies Program, or Institute, rather?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. And you were the director of a history
21 project, and what was the project you were
22 working on?
23
A.
Basically, they have, oh, seminars,
24 undergraduate seminars.
25 summer seminars every year.
212-279-9424
They especially do the
And they come in

2 in history.
3 encourage study of history.
4 called up -- it was great, a lot of fun.
5 called up a lot of these students and would ask
6 about how they are doing and point out
7 opportunities to appear on panels that might
8 exist, help them with research, that kind of
9 thing, so sort of a quasi faculty member, you
10 know, I guess you would say, quasi mentor, at
11 least to some extent.
12
13
Q.
And they really wanted to
Okay.
So what I did is I
I
Did you yourself give lectures
or just to help put these seminars together?
14 A. Yeah, I gave lectures at the seminars.
15 Q. Is George Mason -- how would you
16 characterize the political vent of this
17 institute, conservative institute, liberal
18 institute?
19
20
Did it have a political --
MS. LAWSON:
A.

Yeah, I think it was -- the
21 terminology that they would use would be
22 classical liberal, but you could also say, you
23 know, libertarian of a type.
24 have had those kind of issues that they would
25 have been emphasizing.

But they would

1 Q. (By Mr. Harris) What type of issues?
2 A. Oh, well, I mean, the work I did on
3 tax revolts, certainly, was of interest, and
4 then I did another book on mutual aid, you
5 know, before.
6 of social welfare, fraternal societies, and my
7 earlier research on that, which ended up as a
8 book, also, was when I was there.
9
10
Q.
You know, this was the main form
Okay.
And while you were there, you
were also an adjunct professor at George Mason?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. What course did you teach?
13 A. I only taught one course there, and
14 that was -- it's been a long time, but I
15 believe -- I may have taught both halves of the
16 U. S. Survey.
17 half of the survey, which would be 1877 to
18 present.
19 taught the first half there, too, but I'm not
20 sure of that.

Q.
I at least taught the second

Q.
When you say you weren't physically
4 there, you were a fellow, but you didn't have
5 to live there?
6
A.
Yeah, they gave me a fellowship, and
7 that helped me to begin my next book, which was
8 the book on the fraternal societies.
9 pretty much had completed the previous book,

10 and that helped me to get rolling on the next
11 one in terms of research.

17
Q.
All right.
Now, do you recall where
you were physically living at the time?
A.
I was physically living at the time in
Virginia in Fairfax.
Q.
Is the Institute for Humane Studies
still in existence?
18 A. Yes, it is.
19 Q. Did you have a mentor or a supervisor
20
while you worked there?
21 A. Yes, I did.
22 Q. Who was that; do you recall?
23 A. The main one was -- he was really the
24 guy that ran it.
25 President, but his name was Walter Grinder.
212-279-9424
It wasn't officially the
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
He
212-490-3430Page 20
1 was the head of sort of their academic affairs.
2 And there was a gentleman that I also worked
3 with there who was the President, and his name
4 was Leonard Liggio.
5 Q. Now, is Walter Grinder still there?
6 A. No, he isn't.
7 Q. And Liggio, is he still around?
8 A. No, he isn't.
9
Still both alive, but
they are not there.
10
Q.
Okay.
All right.
So, from the
11 institute, you moved to University of Las --
12 University of Nevada, Las Vegas?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. What did you teach there?
15 A. Oh, a lot of different courses.
I
16 taught the U. S. Survey.
17 History course.
18 course.
19 terribly much.
20 once I left there; though, I learned a lot in
21 it.

A.
Well, it's looking at their role as

No.
Although that's fraternal in the

13 A. Yeah, I wanted to point out, you know,
14 the extensive role that these organizations

Similar in terms of libertarian or --

Libertarian, I don't know,
10 conservative, but having said that, they did

13 So they probably were a little broader in their
14 support that they gave.
15

23 anything to do with the history of tobacco,
24 cigarettes, or cigarette design?

Yes.

2 certainly discuss the important role of tobacco
3 farming, tobacco crops during the colonial
4 period in early U. S. history.
5 as public awareness or that issue, I would
6 certainly discuss that in both my upper
7 division courses 1877 to 1917 when you had a
8 lot of anti-cigarette leagues being formed, and

Q.
Now, in terms of the first course you
15 mentioned, which was the colonial era, tobacco
16 growing during the colonial era, is that a
17 topic covered in a particular textbook you use,
18 or do you use a secondary source devoted to
19 that issue?

MS. LAWSON:
A.

No, it would be covered -- it would be

(By Mr. Harris) What type -- what's
the title of the textbook you use?
A.
I've used several, including a

5 title is.
6 but the author is Tyndall.

Q.
All the titles tend to sound alike,
But the second area of American

17 lot of anti-cigarette leagues, Lucy Gaston and
18 all of those folks, and then I do discuss that

That's most of my research.

Regarding the cigarette league area,
22 do you use, again, any particular books that
23 are devoted specifically to that, or is that

A.
I don't really have a larger textbook.
2 I have a lot of series of shorter readings, and
3 in the past, I do believe I've used Burnham's
4 book, which it's been a while, though, since
5 I've read that.
6 And I think I took a section out of there on
7 anti-cigarette leagues and that kind of thing.
8 It's really not the main focus of the course by
9 any means.
10 Q.
But it's called Bad Habits.
It's touched on.
The leagues themselves, were they like
11 prohibition or leagues that were set up to set
12 up cigarette prohibition?
13
MS. LAWSON:
Object to form.
14 A. Yes, many of them were.
15 Q. (By Mr. Harris) What timeframe was
16
17
that?
A.
This would be -- we're talking about
18 beginning in maybe the 1890s.
19 really quite significant up until World War I.
20 That was sort of their golden age.
21 they are kind of still there, but they are
22 shifting more to issues such as limiting
23 tobacco use for minors.
24 trying to ban tobacco use or cigarettes.

After that,
Early on, they were

MS. LAWSON:

They were all over -- they were all
4 over the country.
5 You see them in the Midwest and West, probably
6 not as much in the Northeast.

Q.
They are there,
(By Mr. Harris) And then the third era
that you looked at where cigarettes were
involved or tobacco was involved?
11
12
You see them in the South.
MS. LAWSON:
A.

Well, those -- I mean, one would be I
13 would look at the colonial period.
14 would look at roughly 1877 to -- well, to about
15 1920s or so.

22
Tell me again what your opinion is
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
Well, my opinion is that Evelyn
23 Thibault was exposed through multiple sources
24 to the evidence that cigarette smoking was bad
25 for you, that it could kill you, that it could

1 be highly habit forming for many people, habit
2 that was difficult to break, and that these
3 sources of information that she received this
4 were from, you know, wide range, including
5 educational materials in Nebraska where she
6 went to school and also Oregon where she
7 completed her education and popular culture,
8 including songs that she was familiar with like
9 "Smoke Smoke Smoke Smoke That Cigarette," and
10 potentially, even although I would like to know
11 more details about what she read, the novels
12 that she read, which were mystery novels
13 involving police work, and that would be an
14 additional source.
15 newspapers, magazines, and very important,
16 family members advising her, advising her to
17 quit smoking.
18 sources I would look at.
Then, of course, newspaper,
So those would be some of the
19 Q. Do you know what year she was born?
20 A. She was born in 1936.
21 Q. And do you know what year she started
22
23
smoking, approximately?
A.
Little bit of dispute on that, but it
24 was either 19 -- about 1950, possibly as late
25 as 1952.
212-279-9424
So 14 to 16 years old, in that range.

So, from 1936, you add 16 years

What sources did you look at in
MS. LAWSON:
A.

Well, textbooks in Nebraska, course
9 study guides, course of studies in Nebraska,
10 then the same for Oregon during that period.
11 Also, newspapers such as the Oregonian and the
12 Oregon Statesman would be, you know, a couple
13 of examples that I would look at for that early
14 period.

4 answers respecting your research.
5
A.
Sure.
Well, there would be specific
6 textbooks in both Nebraska and Oregon, and I

14 Q. I need you to identify these, if you
15 would. 16 A.
Well, in Nebraska, the school
17 textbooks are chosen at the district level.
18 that is one of the things I want to do is go to
19 the district and find out precisely what
20 textbooks were offered.
21 textbooks that were used, and there were also
22 study guides.
23 for elementary schools in Nebraska from 1936
24 which indicates that they -- it was standard,

Interestingly enough, it quotes
14 Dr. Daniel Kress and his arguments about the
15 dangers of smoking, and it lists many of the
16 diseases that smoking causes, blood vessels,
17 lung disease, various kinds of bronchitis.
18 it also emphasizes the critical attitude
19 towards tobacco, towards cigarette ads, and
20 emphasizes that cigarettes are deadly and can
21 kill.

22 MS. LAWSON:
23
Q.
Sure.
(By Mr. Harris) When we left off, you
24 were talking about elementary school or high
25 school.
212-279-9424
Which grade levels do you recall when
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
212-490-3430Page 50
1
2
you were talking about the curriculum?
A.
It says Course of Study for the
3 Elementary Schools of Nebraska Grades One
4 Through Eight.
5
Q.
During that time period when Ms.
6 Thibault was in elementary school, you're
7 saying, if I hear you correctly, that there
8 were health courses that dealt with the dangers
9 of smoking?
10
A.
There were physiology courses,
11 hygiene, and then in the '40s when she was
12 attending, there was a formal health
13 requirement.
14
Q.
All right.
And they were, then, in
15 the course guides that you were reading from,
16 it specifically mentioned cigarettes?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. Just so the record is clear, you've
19
never met Ms. Thibault; is that right?
20 A. No.
21 Q. You never interviewed her or any of
22
her family members about her education?
23 A. No.
24 Q. How did you determine that she went to
25
elementary school?
212-279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

212-490-3430Page 51
1 A. From the depositions.
2 Q. And how far in her education did she
3
4
go; do you know?
A.
That's a little unclear, but according
5 to most sources, including her husband, she
6 dropped out at age 16.
7
Q.
So that would have been about junior
8 high school or sophomore or junior in high
9 school?
10
MS. LAWSON:
Object to form.
11 A. Or I guess first year of high school.
12 Q. (By Mr. Harris) Okay.
Now, are you
13 making a judgment based on her information
14 environment as to whether she was capable of
15 understanding the risk of smoking --
16
17
MS. LAWSON:
Q.
18
19
20
21
-- and should not have smoked?
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
Yes, I am.
Same objection.
I think she comes across
in the depositions as a very capable person.
Q.
(By Mr. Harris) Are you simply -- I
22 guess my question is:
23 describing the information environment that she
24 grew up in with respect to risk in her life
25 including smoking, or are you saying given the
212-279-9424
Are you simply
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

1 risks that were out there or the informational
2 environment she grew up she should not have
3 started smoking?
4
5
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
Well, I guess it was ultimately her
6 choice, but I'm certainly looking at the
7 information environment, which included family
8 members, included school records, included
9 popular culture, and the information was out
10 there that smoking could kill you, that it was
11 habit -- potentially habit forming, that
12 nicotine was the element in cigarettes that
13 created the habit, and that that information
14 was available to her.

17 shouldn't smoke, that it's dangerous.
18
19
Q.
And she had family
She had her education, so forth, was
Now, you're not an expert on
addiction; is that right?
20 A. No, I'm not.
21 Q. And you're not a psychologist?
22 A. No.
23 Q. Or a medical doctor?
24 A. No, I'm not.
25 Q. And you're not an epidemiologist?
212-279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
212-490-3430Page 53
1 A. No, I'm not.
2 Q. And have you ever done any studies on
3 whether influences in the home or among family
4 members are stronger than influences outside
5 the same, say, in school?
6
MS. LAWSON:
Object to form.
7 A. I haven't done a study of that type.
8 Q. (By Mr. Harris) Is it possible that
9
she was more greatly influenced in her decision
10 making by those she knew better, knew best,
11 like siblings or parents, than what she may
12 have read in a study guide at school?
13
14
15
16
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
It's quite possible that she was more
influenced by peers and by family members.
Q.
(By Mr. Harris) At the age of 16, in
17 your opinion, are peers more important than
18 teachers and parents with respect to influence?
19
MS. LAWSON:
20 A.
21 think.
22 Q.
Object to form.
It really depends on the person, I

-- versus teachers and what books may
have been trying to teach her?
4
MS. LAWSON:
5
A.
Same objection.
Well, I know that her sister Diana
6 urged her to quit smoking.
7 parents were very much against their children
8 smoking, and that Ms. Thibault, according to
9 deposition, actually tried to hide her smoking
10 from her mother because she was afraid of what
11 her mother would do if she found out.
12
Q.
I know that her
(By Mr. Harris) Doesn't that indicate
13 that she was acting like a typical teenager
14 when doing something her parents may not have
15 approved of?
16
MS. LAWSON:
17
A.
Object to form.
In some respects, I suppose it does,
18 but she also is getting this advice from people
19 like her -- her husband's sister.
20 getting this advice later, certainly, from her
21 sister.
22 according to depositions, such as "coffin
23 nail," such as "cancer stick" at an early age.

11 and its ability to understand risk?
12
A.
13
14
No, I'm not.
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
I may have read about that, but I
15 wouldn't be able to comment intelligently on
16 them.
17
Q.
(By Mr. Harris) Do you have an opinion
18 as to when a teenager or when a young person
19 who has not reached the age of maturity or
20 majority is capable of making a rational
21 decision?
22
23
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
Not precisely, no, I don't have a

MS. LAWSON:
A.

The research is ongoing.
As I said, I
5 want to go to Oregon and Nebraska.
6 as a historian, I want to visit the place, go
7 to the school board and see if there's more
8 information out there.
9
Q.
I want --
(By Mr. Harris) Have you been -- have
10 you made plans to do that?
11 travel arrangements to actually do that now as
12 we talk?

A.
Have you made
No, I haven't, but I plan to go within
the next two to three weeks.
Q.
Have you been asked to provide a
16 written report or written summary of your
17 findings so far?
18
A.
Well, no.
You know, I haven't written
19 a report, per se, no, because, again, my

11 Q. So from elementary school, she, then,
12 went to, I guess, middle school.
13 think about this for a second -- well, she
14 started smoking when she was 16, approximately.
15 And prior to that, in that 16-year period, she

7 A. Yeah.
8 Q. Beyond -- beyond the immediate

There's
classroom exposure to knowledge that, you know,
10 she may have obtained regarding cigarettes and
11 their risk, what else in her information
12 environment would you have looked at or did you
13 look at?
14
A.
Well, certainly, you know, influences
15 of popular culture, television, movies, more
16 directly with her, country music, and she was
17 aware of the song, and according to one of the
18 depositions had even sung it, "Smoke Smoke
19 Smoke That Cigarette," which I think has a very
20 strong message about the addictive nature of
21 smoking and the dangers of smoking.
22
I would be looking at the novels,
23 right now, just trying to, in general, look at
24 detective novels, mystery novels, television
25 shows.
212-279-9424
She was interested in television shows

1 involving police.
So I've certainly looked at
2 shows like that, movies that have police,
3 police themes, newspapers.
4 you know, she moved around a lot, but as trying
5 to get as many of those newspapers as possible
6 that she may have been exposed to, New York
7 Times, the household -- her husband subscribed
8 to that, and she would read it occasionally,
9 and then trying to find the various local

10 newspapers in places that she lived or places
11 when she was overseas such as Stars and Stripes
12 and Air Force Times that she might have seen,
13 and magazines, as well.
14 Q. 15 there. 16 A. Uh-huh.
17 Q. And it's a little hard -- well, strike
18
You covered a lot of media right
that.
19
Can you break it down for me in terms
20 of TV shows and movies that she may have seen
21 during the '50s and '60s?

3 1950s.
4 Sterling Hayden.

Q.
But certainly looking at shows like
I'm trying to remember.
One starred
(By Mr. Harris) Hold on a minute.
6 Those shows you just mentioned during the '50s,
7 is it safe to say that people or characters in
8 those shows would smoke during the show itself?
9
10
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
Yeah, in some cases, but not always.
11 One of the shows I'm looking at is Leave It to
12 Beaver, for example, where I don't really
13 recall the main character smoking in that.
14 Certainly, there was a lot of smoking in movies
15 and television shows.
16
Q.
(By Mr. Harris) And in your opinion,
17 did those movies and television shows that
18 featured smoking as a prop or an aspect of the
19 show transmit a negative message about smoking
20 or a positive message about smoking?
21
22
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
It's hard to say because you would

24 would also be smoking.

Smoking was common in

1 both the villains and heroes.
2 really kind of depend on a specific example,
3 but I think it didn't necessarily come out as
4 one positive or negative because you would
5 have, like I said, a mix of people doing it.
6
Q.
So it would
But, certainly, it was prevalent in
7 the media, movies, and TV shows up to a certain
8 point; would you agree with me?
9
MS. LAWSON:
Object to form.
10 A. Where you would see people smoking?
11 Q. (By Mr. Harris) Yeah, in TV and
12
movies.
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Just so we're clear, you're not an
15
16
expert in cigarette advertising, are you?
A.
I'm not an expert in advertising, but
17 as a historian, that would be one of the many
18 sources I would legitimately use and have used
19 in the past, advertising.
20
21
Q.
Have you looked at any cigarette
advertising for the decades she smoked?
22 A. Yes, I have.
23 Q. What ads have you looked at?
24 A. I've looked at a wide range of ads.
25
It's standard practice when I'm going through
212-279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
212-490-3430Page 63
1 newspapers and periodicals and so forth to look
2 at the ads.
3
4
Q.
Now, the purpose of the ad is to sell
something; would you agree with me?
5
MS. LAWSON:
Object to the form.
6 A. Yes, I would agree.
7 Q. (By Mr. Harris) Those ads you looked
8 at, I assume, were published in an effort to
9 promote or sell cigarettes?
10
MS. LAWSON:
Object to form.
11 A. To sell particular brands, yes.
12 Q. (By Mr. Harris) Now, among those
13 publications that you reviewed that had ads in
14 them, how many had articles or advertisements
15 or notices that discouraged people from
16 smoking, say, during the '50s and '60s?
17
18
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
I mean, it was fairly frequent.
For
19 example, in The Oregonian, you had a lot of
20 advertisements from stop smoking, you know,
21 programs that were offered or devices to help
22 people stop smoking.
23 that, as well as you would see, certainly,
24 cigarette ads.
25
Q.
212-279-9424
So you would see ads like
(By Mr. Harris) Can you pinpoint the
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
212-490-3430Page 64
1 timeframe these stop smoking programs were
2 advertised?
3
A.
Like I said, my memory is not
4 photographic.
5 Looking at the Oregonian, I saw advertisements
6 like that for the early 1950s.
7
8
9
Q.
I know I recently reviewed this.
And do you know what geographic area
the Oregonian covered?
A.
I believe it was published in
10 Portland, which is some distance from Coos Bay,
11 but it was one of the main papers taken there,
12 according to some of the sources I've seen.
13
14
Q.
Do you know whether or not Ms.
Thibault read the Oregonian?
15 A. No, I don't.
16 Q. All right.
17
18
Now, you seem to make
reference to detective novels, I believe.
A.
Mystery novels involving police work.
19 The depositions indicate several places that
20 she was interested in detective magazines, but
21 aren't terribly specific beyond that.
22
Q.
And what about detective magazines or
23 even novels has any impact one way or the other
24 on her exposure to cigarettes?
25
MS. LAWSON:
212-279-9424
Object to form.
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

A.
Well, it would have the impact in that
2 it would contribute to the information
3 environment about the dangers of smoking, about
4 the habit-forming qualities of smoking, because
5 those issues would be discussed in many of
6 these novels.
7
Q.
(By Mr. Harris) Are you -- can you
8 give me an example, specific example, of one
9 novel that would discuss the dangers of
10
smoking?
11 A. Well, I'm looking right here.

Q.
I thought you said it was important to
have her in Fort Myers.
A.
It's good to have somebody in Florida
because I've got several cases.
9 Q. All right.
Anyone else?
10 A. On this particular case, I'm thinking
11 -- I'm thinking just to make sure I'm giving
12 you a correct answer.
13
Q.
Okay.
I believe that's it.
Now, there's something going
14 past these ledger entries, Coos Bay and North
15 Bend City Directory.
16
A.
What does this tell me?
Well, city directories used to be
17 produced in many large cities and many smaller
18 cities, and they would endeavor to list all the
19 adults, certainly, in the community and give
20 their occupations.
21 And often the city directories give a little
22 bit of background about the community at the
23 beginning of the directory.

Q.
It was used as a guide.
Is there anything in here referencing
the Thibaults in this directory?

9 A. Yes.
10 Q. Did you pull out those pages that have
11 cigarette advertisements in them or pages that
12 may include topics that are anti-smoking?
13
A.
Stars and Stripes, I don't believe the
14 index covered cigarette ads, but I did
15 certainly do that for Air Force Times.

to you?

Public awareness, what does that mean
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
Public awareness, that means what
6 information, you know, is available to the
7 public on a particular issue, in this case, the
8 dangers, the risks, of smoking and whether or
9 not smoking is addictive.
10
Q.
(By Mr. Harris) Is awareness something
11 you can quantify empirically, or how do you
12 measure awareness?
13
14
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
You have to have various measures.
15 You know, as a historian, I think you need to
16 look at a wide range of sources, and those
17 sources would be what did people read, what
18 were, you know, newspapers.
19 television shows.
20 music.
21 awareness, what was the public exposed to, and
22 then poll data as well.
23 that as poll data would be used.

Does my research involve any

Q.
No, public awareness, when you're
studying public awareness.
7
8
Did it involve any type of statistical
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
It can, it can involve some
statistical analysis.
I haven't done any
10 statistical analysis in this particular case,
11 however.
12
Q.
(By Mr. Harris) Is this a case that
13 even can be analyzed from a statistical point
14 of view?
15
16
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
That's one of many sources, and to
17 sketch out the immediate or the overall
18 information environment, I think, statistics
19 such as poll data can be very helpful giving
20 you a read on what the levels of public
21 awareness are.
22
Q.
(By Mr. Harris) Right.
All right.

23 there anything other than what we've discussed

case?
2
3
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
Well, as we sit here today, I can't --
4 I think I've covered -- I've covered the bases
5 pretty well, given you a pretty broad summary,
6 but I'm sure as I do more research that things
7 might come up.
8
9
Q.
(By Mr. Harris) Is it safe to say your
thesis remains the same throughout her lifetime
10 at least up through the time she stopped
11 smoking?
12
13
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
It remains the same in the sense that
14 I think from an early age, from her years at
15 school, that she was exposed to evidence that
16 smoking was a risky behavior, could kill you
17 that nicotine was -- could create very strong
18 powerful habits that were difficult to break.
19 So I think, over time, certainly, sources of
20 information really multiply, but they are there
21 from an early age.
22
Q.
(By Mr. Harris) And just so the record
23 is clear, among all the sources of information,
24 unfortunately quite a lot, you have no evidence
25 showing that she sought any particular source
212-279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
212-490-3430Page 92
1 of information other than what's in the
2 deposition transcripts?
3
4
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
Other than what's in the depositions,
5 I mean, I know -- I do know that in Oregon, if
6 she -- you know, when she went to school there,
7 there was a list of books that were assigned in
8 required health classes.
9 sure.
10
11
12
And I don't know for
I can't say she had a particular book in
her hand, but I do know that much.
Q.
And you don't know whether she read
The Oregonian, do you?
13
MS. LAWSON:
Object to form.
14 A. No, I do not.
15 Q. (By Mr. Harris) Or whether she knew or
16 was aware of the Surgeon General's reports in
17 subsequent years?
18
19
MS. LAWSON:
A.
Object to form.
The evidence indicates that she was
20 aware that it was bad for you, that she was
21 aware that cigarettes could cause cancer, but
22 specific statements that she had read the
23 Surgeon General's report, I don't recall seeing
24 any of those in the depositions.
25
Q.
212-279-9424
(By Mr. Harris) Is there any other

Other than what I've already
