3	THEREUPON,
4	LUIS MARTINEZ-FERNANDEZ, Ph.D,
5	A Witness herein, acknowledged after having
6	been duly sworn and testified upon his oath as
7	follows:
8	THE WITNESS: I do.
9	DIRECT EXAMINATION
10	BY MR. PORTAL:
11	Q. Good morning. Can you please state and spell
12	your name for the record?
13	A. Luis Martinez-Fernandez, L-U-I-S,
14	M-A-R-T-I-N-E-Z, hyphen, F-E-R-N-A-N-D-E-Z.
15	Q. Do you go by Dr. Martinez-Fernandez?
16	A. That would be fine.
17	Q. I introduced myself to you earlier today. My
18	name is Janpaul Portal. I'm with The Ferraro Law Firm
19	and I represent the Estate of Pio Manuel Suarez in
20	this lawsuit that's been filed against RJ. Reynolds
21	and Philip Morris.
22	Do you understand that?
23	A. Yes, I do.
24	Q. You've been disclosed as an expert witness in
6
1	that?
2	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
3	A. In this case?
4	BY MR. PORTAL:
5	Q. Yes, sir. Strike that. What is your
6	understanding of your role as an expert witness in the
7	Suarez matter?
8	A. In the Suarez matter, I've been doing
9	research pertaining to his particular case. I
10	understand --1 came up with conclusions based on
11	that. I have brought these materials today for the
12	deposition. I'm going to be deposed today -- I'm
13	being deposed -- and I may testify in trial.
14	Q. Dr. Martinez-Fernandez, you've given both
15	deposition and trial testimony before. Correct?
16	A. Correct.
17	Q. Let me refresh your recollection. As you
18	know, I'm going to be asking today a series of
19	questions in a fashion. There's a court reporter to
20	your right, so I ask that you allow me to completely
21	ask my questions before you answer so we can avoid
22	speaking over each other.
23	At any time you do not understand my
24	question, please do not answer it. Let me know and
7
1	you.
2	If at any time you need to take a break, if
3	there's a question pending, I ask you that please
4	answer the question before taking the break and we'll
5	certainly accommodate you.
6	Are these procedures fair and acceptable to
7	you?
8	A. Yes, they are.
9	Q. What do you do for a living?
10	A. I'm a professor of history at the University
11	of Central Florida.
12	Q. What does it mean to be a professor of
13	history?
14	A. As a professor of history, my
15	responsibilities are to teach history courses, to do
16	research and publish in my areas of expertise, and to
17	be active in the area of service to the profession.
18	Q. In connection with the services that you're
19	rendering in the Suarez matter, who have you been
20	retained by?
21	A. Jones Day.
22	Q. Jones Day is a law firm, correct?
23	A. Correct.
24	Q. In this case, the lawsuit has been brought
8
1	Do you understand that you're here testifying on those
2	defendants' behalf?
3	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
4	A. Yes.
5	BY MR. PORTAL:
6	Q. Certainly you're not testifying for the
7	plaintiff, Mr. Suarez, in this case. Correct?
8	A. No I'm not.
9	Q. The testimony that you are offering in this
10	case would be testimony to assist the defense of this
11	case, correct?
12	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
13	A. These are materials that I have found. They
14	may be used by the defendants or they may be used by
15	somebody else.
16	BY MR. PORTAL:
17	Q. Do you have a corporate entity or how do you
18	bill for the services that you render in litigation
19	cases like the one you're on today?
20	A. I bill --1 used the -- well, I used my name,
21	so it's directly. I do consulting on the side as
22	well.
23	Q. So do you have a separate PA or do you go by
24	a d/b/a? How does that work?
9
1	Q. Do you have a professional association, a
2	corporation, some other type of legal entity for which
3	you are paid for the services you render in your
4	consulting and litigation work?
5	A. Could you repeat the question?
6	Q. Sure. You work with the University of the
7	Central Florida, correct?
8	A. Correct.
9	Q. You're a salaried employee of the university?
10	A. Yes, I am.
11	Q. For the services you're rendering in the
12	Suarez case and the other cases that you've testified
13	in tobacco-related litigation, are any of those moneys
14	paid to the university for the services that you
15	render?
16	A. No.
17	Q. Who are those moneys paid to?
18	A. They're paid to me.
19	Q. So my question is: Are they paid to you as
20	Luis Martinez-Fernandez, individually, or are they
21	paid to -- have you set up a corporation to do your
22	consulting business -- how are you paid?
23	A. In terms of these, it's directly to me.
24	Q. It's my understanding that you bill your work
25	at a rate of $225 an hour?
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. Are you billing $225 an hour for the services
3	you rendered in connection with the Suarez matter?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Let's start first -- we premarked some
6	exhibits, so let's go to those on the record first and
7	then I'm going to ask you some details.
8	First of all, we marked as Plaintiffs
9	Exhibit 1 to your deposition the amended notice of
10	taking deposition for today, which also includes a
11	duces tecum.
12	Have you seen this document before?
13	A. Yes, I have.
14	Q. To the best of your ability, have you brought
15	with you and produced the records that were requested
16	in that duces tecum?
17	A. Yes, I have.
18	Q. Now, we were provided a correspondence from
19	counsel on behalf of RJ. Reynolds dated October 9,
20	2013, which included a log of reliance materials that
21	appears you will be relying on in order to render your
22	opinions in this case. They were also included on CDs
23	or DVDs.
24	Are you aware of that?
11
1	A. Yes, I am.
2	Q. And that's been premarked as Plaintiffs'
3	Exhibit 2 to your deposition, correct -- the actual
4	correspondence, copies of the CDs and the log of
5	reliance materials.
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Now, those reliance materials, there are some
8	over 5,000 documents, ballpark, correct, listed there?
9	A. That's my recollection, yes.
10	Q. In the reliance materials, you do not
11	disclose any depositions or other records specific to
12	Mr. Suarez's case that you reviewed. Is that correct?
13	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
14	A. Can you repeat the question?
15	BY MR. PORTAL:
16	Q. Sure. The log of reliance materials, I had
17	an opportunity to review it in preparation for your
18	deposition. I noted that there was no reference to
19	any of the depositions, pleadings or other documents
20	specific to this case.
21	So my question to you: Is that consistent
22	with your understanding in preparing your list of
23	reliance materials?
24	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
25	A. Well, first I would like to make sure that
12
1	we're talking about the same list.
2	BY MR. PORTAL:
3	Q. Sure.
4	A. This one has 181 pages.
5	Q. In a review of what's been premarked as
6	Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2 to your deposition, there's also
7	a reliance list of 181 pages.
8	A. Correct.
9	Q. So, again, what I just want to have an
10	understanding is -- number one -- did you formulate
11	that reliance list or did you defer to the attorneys
12	who work in this case to create the reliance list?
13	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
14	A. We have worked together in the past. This is
15	a list that has been changing, of course, pertaining
16	to each case. I, of course, had input in the process.
17	Everything that is in there has my approval and those
18	are materials that I have seen and read.
19	BY MR. PORTAL:
20	Q. So in reviewing the reliance list, again,
21	I'll represent to you that I didn't see any reference
22	to any specific materials relating to Mr. Suarez --
23	that being medical records, depositions, pleadings,
24	answers to responses to discovery. Is that consistent
13
1	contained or not contained in the reliances list?
2	MR. COTTON: Object to form. You're
3	asking him if case-specific materials are
4	referenced in here?
5	MR. PORTAL: Right.
6	MR. COTTON: If you need to look at it,
7	you need to look at it. For the benefit of
8	the record, Dr. Martinez-Fernandez has
9	brought certain case-specific materials that
10	he has reviewed, including several deposition
11	transcripts, interrogatory responses, and he
12	certainly reserves the right to rely upon
13	those if that's the question.
14	BY MR. PORTAL:
15	Q. The question is a little different, but
16	that's what I want to establish. In reviewing your
17	reliance materials, I saw that there are references to
18	multiple media references, newspaper articles, things
19	of that nature. What I didn't see is any
20	case-specific materials, meaning depositions,
21	pleadings and things like that.
22	I understand that you brought here today with
23	you certain depositions which you've reviewed,
24	correct?
1	Q. So that's what I just want to know. I want
2	to understand -- what is the entire universe of
3	documents you reviewed in formulating your opinions
4	that you anticipate offering in this case? I have
5	your 181-page reliance list. I know now that you've
6	reviewed depositions and some discovery.
7	What else have you reviewed so that I have a
8	full understanding of the entire universe of documents
9	that you're going to be relying on?
10	A. That reflects the -- with the exception of
11	these materials that you just mentioned, which I
12	didn't know had to be part of the list -- that
13	reflects the universe of materials that I intend to
14	rely upon.
15	Q. By that, you're referring to what's been
16	previously marked as Exhibit 2, the 181-page reliance
17	list. Correct?
18	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
19	A. Yes.
20	BY MR. PORTAL:
21	Q. And in addition to the 181-page reliance
22	list, you reviewed some depositions. Correct?
23	A. Correct.
24	Q. And some discovery answers in the Suarez
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. Of the depositions that you reviewed, is it
3	your understanding that you only were provided fact
4	witness depositions in this case?
5	A. Fact witness depositions?
6	MR. COTTON: Have you seen any expert
7	transcripts?
8	THE WITNESS: Expert transcripts, no.
9	BY MR. PORTAL:
10	Q. So all the depositions that you reviewed in
11	this case is what you produced here today, correct?
12	A. Yeah, the depositions are here and some of
13	the other legal materials, like the interrogatories,
14	which I think may be here.
15	Q. So I had an opportunity before your
16	deposition to go through those depositions and I did
17	not see any of the plaintiffs' experts depositions,
18	including, for example, the testimony of Dr. Proctor
19	or Dr. Miller or Dr. Davila, plaintiffs' experts in
20	this case. So I just want to make sure that you
21	weren't provided those depositions and you have not
22	reviewed them.
23	A. I have not seen them.
24	Q. Have you reviewed any of Mr. Suarez's medical
1	A. No.
2	Q. Have you reviewed any applications for life
3	insurance pertaining to Mr. Suarez?
4	A. No.
5	Q. Have you reviewed any of Mr. Suarez's
6	employment records or income tax returns?
7	A. No.
8	Q. So that we're clear then for the record, as
9	of today, the only materials that you've reviewed in
10	terms of case-specific materials are the depositions
11	of the fact witnesses that I'll represent to you is in
12	the binder or accordion file that you have to the left
13	of you. Correct? There's nothing else in your office
14	or somewhere else that you viewed that you didn't
15	bring today, is there?
16	A. There is one item.
17	Q. What's that?
18	A. These are something that I requested to see.
19	In one of the depositions, there's photocopies of some
20	Bohemia and Carteles magazines.
21	Q. Those are Cuban magazines?
22	A. Correct.
23	Q. Have you been provided those magazines?
24	A. As exhibits, yes.
17
1	ads from Cuban magazines from the 1950s, do you have
2	any materials that you didn't produce here today?
3	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
4	A. No, I don't.
5	BY MR. PORTAL:
6	Q. So let's go down the list of items that we
7	premarked for housekeeping purposes. Exhibit 3 is
8	your -- it's a two-page invoice. Correct?
9	A. There are two.
10	Q. And those invoices are for July 12, 2013 and
11	September 13, 2013, correct?
12	A. Correct.
13	Q. In fact, in this case, you were first
14	contacted to do work back on October 3rd of 2010,
15	correct?
16	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
17	A. It's within that ballpark of the time I
18	recall.
19	BY MR. PORTAL:
20	Q. We premarked -- and we'll get down the
21	line -- but Exhibit 11 -- you produced to us all of
22	your correspondence -- and feel free to refer to it —
23	correct?
24	A. Yes.
18
1	deposition, is all the correspondence that you
2	generated or you received regarding your involvement
3	in this case. Correct?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. And I take it this exhibit is in date order
6	with the oldest correspondence on top and then
7	proceeding chronologically. Correct?
8	MR. COTTON: I'm not sure he can confirm
9	that on the spot, but object to form.
10	A. I can't confirm that unless I have a chance
11	to look through it.
12	BY MR. PORTAL:
13	Q. Sure. Feel free.
14	MR. COTTON: For the record, I think the
15	dates will speak for themselves.
16	A. They're not in precise order.
17	BY MR. PORTAL:
18	Q. The first page of Composite Exhibit 11 is
19	dated October 3, 2010, correct?
20	A. It says October 3. I don't see the year
21	here.
22	Q. Do you mind if I take a look at it, please?
23	It looks like, if you look at the first page, that
24	this is an e-mail from Paul D. Koethe at Jones Day.
1	A. Correct.
2	Q. And it appears to be that Mr. Koethe is an
3	attorney with Jones Day, correct?
4	A. That is correct.
5	Q. And there's the date reference of October 3,
6	correct?
7	A. October 3.
8	Q. It appears this first page is an e-mail
9	chain, where the e-mail continues on page two of this
10	document. Correct?
11	A. Let me see. I can't verify that by --1
12	can't verify that.
13	Q. Certainly on page two of Composite
14	Exhibit 11, this is dated August of 2010. Do you see
15	that?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. So is it fair to say then that you would have
18	started working on this case somewhere in the middle
19	to fall of 2010?
20	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
21	A. That's within the ballpark.
22	BY MR. PORTAL:
23	Q. And you've continued to work on this case
24	since 2010 to the current date in 2013, correct?
20
1	A. Yes.
2	BY MR. PORTAL:
3	Q. However, you've only produced invoices for
4	July of 2013 and September 2013, is that correct?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. As you sit here today, can you tell us how
7	many hours in total you've spent, in terms of doing
8	work in preparation up till today, in the Suarez
9	matter?
10	A. I believe there's one that is missing here.
11	I'm not a hundred percent sure. These are--you
12	asked me about the --
13	MR. COTTON: He asked how many hours --
14	THE WITNESS: My estimate is that it may
15	be probably 100 to 150. It's a good faith
16	estimate.
17	BY MR. PORTAL:
18	Q. So 100 to 150 hours, correct?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. And that's what you bill out at $225 an hour,
21	correct?
22	A. Correct.
23	Q. So in this case so far, ballpark, if we take
24	the range you've provided to us, your fees would range
21
1	150 hours. Does that sound accurate to you?
2	MR. COTTON: That would speak for itself.
3	If you want him to get out a calculator, he
4	can.
5	A. I trust the math as it came out of your
6	machine.
7	BY MR. PORTAL:
8	Q. You reviewed a lot of materials in this case.
9	The ballpark of 100 to 150 hours, is that the average
10	amount of hours that you would put in a case like this
11	or is it actually below your typical average?
12	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
13	A. I don't recall that.
14	BY MR. PORTAL:
15	Q. You recall providing litigation support in
16	deposition and trial testimony in other tobacco
17	related cases in Florida, correct?
18	A. Yes.
19	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
20	BY MR. PORTAL:
21	Q. As a matter of fact, you recall recently, in
22	February of this year, providing testimony in the
23	Wendel case. Correct?
24	A. Deposition, yes.
22
1	testified you had put in somewhere of approximately
2	250 to 260 hours of work. Does that seem fair to you
3	based on your recollection?
4	A. For that case?
5	Q. Yes.
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. And that case involved a smoker in the United
8	States only, correct?
9	A. Correct.
10	Q. This case actually involves a Cuban smoker
11	who smoked both in Cuba and in the United States,
12	correct?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. So that, in this case, you spent doing
15	research not just on issues of --1 take it that
16	you'll testify about public awareness of smoking and
17	health effects of smoking. Correct?
18	A. Correct.
19	Q. In this case, you did research in order to
20	prepare for your testimony regarding public awareness
21	of the health effects of smoking in Cuba. Correct?
22	A. Correct.
23	Q. And you also did research and prepared for
24	the health effects of smoking in the United States.
1	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
2	A. Correct.
3	BY MR. PORTAL:
4	Q. In addition, within the United States -- and
5	you testified a lot about general public awareness and
6	then plaintiff-specific awareness.
7	In this case, did you do any research
8	specifically related to public awareness of the health
9	effects of smoking of, number one, Hispanic smokers in
10	the United States?
11	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
12	A. I wouldn't put it in those terms.
13	BY MR. PORTAL:
14	Q. What terms would you put it in?
15	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
16	A. In terms of focus on Miami and the greater
17	Miami area.
18	BY MR. PORTAL:
19	Q. So did you perform additional research
20	specifically related to public awareness of the health
21	effects of Hispanic smokers in the Miami-Dade County
22	area?
23	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
24	A. Yes, I did.
25	BY MR. PORTAL:
1	Q. Did you perform even further specified or
2	detailed research regarding public awareness of the
3	health effects of smoking amongst Cuban smokers in the
4	Miami-Dade County area?
5	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
6	A. I don't believe the information was
7	specifically about Cubans, so I don't know.
8	BY MR. PORTAL:
9	Q. Certainly that's a lot more area to cover and
10	to research than what you had done in the Wendel case,
11	correct?
12	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
13	foundation.
14	A. Not necessarily.
15	BY MR. PORTAL:
16	Q. You've testified in other cases before that.
17	I think in 2012, in October, there was the Buonomo
18	case. Do you recall that?
19	A. Yes, I do.
20	Q. In that case, how much time do you recall you
21	had spent in doing research and preparing for your
22	testimony?
23	A. I don't recall the number.
24	Q. When did you first start working on
1	A. That was in 2001.
2	Q. I understand you were contacted by a law firm
3	in Puerto Rico, who then subsequently put you in
4	contact with the Jones Day law firm. Correct?
5	A. That is correct.
6	Q. And that from 2001, you've been primarily
7	retained by or working for Jones Day in connection
8	with tobacco-related litigation in Florida. Correct?
9	A. Not in Florida at the beginning. That came
10	later.
11	Q. When did you first start testifying in
12	Florida?
13	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
14	A. I don't remember with precision. What I do
15	remember is that the first few years I focused on
16	Puerto Rico.
17	BY MR. PORTAL:
18	Q. In Puerto Rico, you testified just in one
19	federal case. Correct?
20	A. One federal case.
21	Q. Outside of that one federal case in Puerto
22	Rico, the rest of your testimony in terms of
23	tobacco-related litigation has all been in Florida.
24	Correct?
26
1	A. In Florida, yes.
2	BY MR. PORTAL:
3	Q. Since you were retained by the Jones Day firm
4	back in 2001 and through the current date, can you
5	tell us ballpark or approximately how much moneys
6	you've earned in connection with that service?
7	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
8	A. I can only give you an estimate.
9	BY MR. PORTAL:
10	Q. Sure.
11	A. It's a rough estimate. I would say perhaps
12	$600,000. I want to underscore that it's a rough
13	estimate.
14	Q. That would be from starting in 2001 to the
15	current date, 2013?
16	A. Correct.
17	Q. Is there any additional work that you
18	anticipate doing in connection with your opinions in
19	the Suarez matter that you have still not done?
20	A. I anticipate the possibility of looking at
21	the materials again or perhaps new materials.
22	Q. You indicated that there might be an invoice
23	that's missing. Would that be for services that you
24	invoiced or billed for prior to July of 2013?
27
1	prior to July.
2	Q. So is there a different invoice or separate
3	invoices for the time that you billed when you were
4	first retained on or about the middle of 2010 up to
5	July of 2013?
6	A. Is there a difference in terms of?
7	Q. Your invoice.
8	A. Of the invoices ?
9	Q. Right.
10	A. Yes, there's a difference.
11	Q. You indicated to us that you, approximately,
12	have put in 100 to 150 hours; yet, the invoices you
13	produced are only for about, I believe, in total
14	15 hours.
15	A. Uh-huh.
16	Q. So we're missing a significant amount of time
17	in terms of your billing, correct?
18	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
19	A. As it appears in these two invoices.
20	MR. PORTAL: So what I'd like to do-
21	I'll do this by request to defense counsel --
22	I'd like to leave open and supplement
23	Exhibit 3 to your deposition -- we'll mark it
24	as Exhibit 3 -- the amount of the invoices
28
1	in this case leading up to today.
2	MR. COTTON: We'll reserve our right to
3	make any appropriate objections.
4	BY MR. PORTAL:
5	Q. All of your litigation work in connection
6	with tobacco litigation has been 100 percent for the
7	defendant tobacco companies, correct?
8	A. That is correct.
9	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
10	BY MR. PORTAL:
11	Q. You've never testified in any case on behalf
12	of a smoker, correct?
13	A. No.
14	Q. I'm not correct or I am correct?
15	A. Okay. I'm sorry.
16	Q. I'll re-ask the question. Is it fair to say
17	that, in connection with all of your work testifying
18	as an expert and in doing research in tobacco-related
19	litigation, you've never been retained or offered
20	opinions on behalf of the smoker or the smoker's
21	family?
22	A. That is correct.
23	Q. Based on the testimony list that I have, it
24	looks like -- I'm aware of your deposition testimony
29
1	year.
2	From that date to the current date, have you
3	offered deposition or trial testimony in any other
4	matter?
5	A. Not in trial, and I'm not sure whether I had
6	another deposition during that period. That may be
7	the case. I don't recall the timing.
8	Q. Let's go ahead and, just for the record,
9	identify what we premarked. Let's put it on the
10	record and we can come back to them later. Exhibit 4,
11	you can just tell us what this is for the record.
12	Just identify what that contains.
13	A. These are handwritten notes that summarize
14	some of what I found in the depositions.
15	Q. Exhibit 4 is two pages of handwritten notes,
16	correct?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Then Exhibit 5, this is another set of 17
19	pages of handwritten notes. Please identify what that
20	is.
21	A. These are notes from the interrogatories as
22	well as depositions.
23	Q. These are your notes basically summarizing
24	whatever information you gleaned from review of that
1	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
2	A. Notes that I took as I was reading them.
3	BY MR. PORTAL:
4	Q. Exhibit 6 is, again, another composite
5	exhibit of approximately ten pages of handwritten
6	notes. Please tell us what that is.
7	A. These are notes that I took from the
8	Elizabeth Daily Journal.
9	Q. What is the Elizabeth Daily Journal?
10	A. It is the local newspaper in Elizabeth,
11	New Jersey. There's actually a typo here. It says
12	New York, but it's New Jersey.
13	MR. COTTON: Are you talking about the
14	first page of the exhibit?
15	THE WITNESS: Yes.
16	BY MR. PORTAL:
17	Q. You're talking about the title that you have
18	handwritten on the top page. You have the initials
19	"NY," which in fact you're now correcting and it
20	should be "NJ" for New Jersey instead of New York.
21	Correct?
22	A. Correct.
23	Q. Is the Elizabeth Daily Journal a Spanish
24	language newspaper or English language newspaper?
31
1	Q. Now, we've also marked a one-page typewritten
2	document as Exhibit 7. Tell us what that is.
3	A. These are more notes which I took from
4	depositions for this case.
5	Q. Are they notes reflective from any particular
6	document or set of documents? What are they
7	summarizing?
8	A. A deposition by Linares, a deposition by
9	Maria Migdalia, a deposition by Obdulio Tapanes and a
10	deposition from Fernandez Franco.
11	Q. To your knowledge, these are all fact
12	witnesses in the case. Correct?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. We premarked Exhibit 8 and this is five pages
15	of typewritten notes. It looks like this makes
16	reference to the document numbers for the documents
17	identified in your 181-page reliance list. Correct?
18	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
19	A. No, that's not correct.
20	BY MR. PORTAL:
21	Q. Tell me what those document numbers are there
22	that are typed out in this composite exhibit.
23	A. These -- the first ones, I believe, reflect a
24	previous reliance list.
1	A. And then, towards the end, it pertains to the
2	draft for the 181 pages.
3	Q. So the initial pages, when you say prior
4	list -- I'll represent to you that we were provided by
5	defense counsel, Carlton Fields, a reliance list dated
6	December of 2010, also containing, similarly, three
7	CDs with approximately the same number of reliance
8	materials, give or take some documents.
9	Is that what you're referencing?
10	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
11	A. I'm not sure whether I'm referencing the one
12	that you ended up receiving.
13	BY MR. PORTAL:
14	Q. I see. Is there any way for us to
15	cross-reference them to be sure, when you list those
16	document numbers, to which reliance list you are
17	referring to?
18	A. Is there a way to do that? I guess if --
19	yes, there's a way.
20	Q. So let's start this way. How many reliance
21	lists do you have?
22	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
23	A. Reliance lists?
24	BY MR. PORTAL:
1	MR. COTTON: You're talking about just
2	the Suarez case?
3	MR. PORTAL: Correct.
4	A. I have one for sure. I don't know if I have
5	another one.
6	BY MR. PORTAL:
7	Q. What I'm getting at -- we've already marked
8	to your deposition, as Composite Exhibit 2, a 181-page
9	reliance list and it's numbered one through --
10	documents 1 through 5,414.
11	A. Yes, it's the same.
12	Q. So the document that you have in front of
13	you, Exhibit 8, it references document numbers from
14	the reliance list. Correct?
15	MR. COTTON: Object to form,
16	mischaracterizes --
17	BY MR. PORTAL:
18	Q. From a reliance list.
19	A. From a reliance list.
20	Q. What I'm trying to figure out is for you, as
21	Dr. Martinez-Fernandez, when you're going back and
22	overlooking Exhibit 8, how can you tell what document
23	numbers contained in Exhibit 8 reference which
24	reliance list?
34
1	order to answer that question.
2	Q. Again, as you sit here today, you can't tell
3	us how many different reliance lists have been
4	prepared by you in the Suarez case in order to
5	crosscheck or cross-reference what document numbers
6	those are that are listed on Exhibit 8?
7	MR. COTTON: Object to form,
8	mischaracterizes testimony.
9	A. Well, there's one that I provided today.
10	BY MR. PORTAL:
11	Q. Correct.
12	A. There's another one, which I believe I have,
13	and I'm not sure whether there's a third one or not.
14	Q. I see. I'll represent to you that we've only
15	received two reliance lists, one in December 2010 and
16	the current one of October 9, 2013. So when I go back
17	and I cross-reference the documents that you have on
18	Exhibit 8,1 want to be able to tell which reliance
19	list I should be looking at. How can I do that?
20	A. The one that you're referring to --
21	Q. Which is Exhibit 2 to your deposition dated
22	October 9, 2013. Please continue.
23	A. -- my understanding is that it begins on the
24	third page where it says number two.
35
1	total of five pages. Correct?
2	A. Uh-huh.
3	Q. And on page three of Exhibit 8, towards the
4	middle of the page, there's a line and then it says
5	"two," correct?
6	A. It says "two."
7	Q. So any documents listed underneath the middle
8	of page three, underneath number two, would refer to
9	the October 9, 2013 reliance list produced today. Is
10	that fair?
11	MR. COTTON: Form.
12	A. I don't know that for sure.
13	BY MR. PORTAL:
14	Q. But is that your general understanding?
15	A. That's my understanding.
16	Q. Fair enough. Back to the housekeeping
17	issues. Exhibit 9 to your deposition, this is a
18	composite of typewritten notes. Tell us what this
19	contains.
20	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
21	A. The title is "Notes on Cuba Materials," and
22	what it contains are notes that I have taken as I've
23	examined a variety of sources for Miami in general.
24	BY MR. PORTAL:
36
I	said this --
2	MR. COTTON: Did you say Miami or did you
3	say Cuba?
4	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. Cuba.
5	BY MR. PORTAL:
6	Q. That's where I'm confused. Let's start over.
7	Exhibit 9 is a composite exhibit, correct, of multiple
8	pages?
9	A. Correct.
10	Q. You indicated that it is your notes regarding
II	materials you reviewed regarding Cuba, correct?
12	A. Cuba, correct.
13	Q. Specifically what as it pertains to Cuba were
14	you reviewing or researching?
15	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
16	A. I was researching information on health
17	consequences of smoking and I looked into newspapers.
18	BY MR. PORTAL:
19	Q. What else?
20	A. Articles, speeches, books, reports,
21	magazines, journals, government publications, public
22	awareness. Those are the categories.
23	Q. Your research of those Cuba materials, was
24	there a scope in terms of the number of years that you
37
1	A. The scope was generally from the start of the
2	20th century to the present.
3	Q. You understand in this case that the
4	decedent, Mr. Suarez, was born in 1938 in Cuba.
5	Correct?
6	A. Correct.
7	Q. You understand that he resided in Cuba from
8	1938 until approximately 1967, at which time he
9	immigrated to the United States. You understand that,
10	correct?
11	A. Yes, I do.
12	Q. In terms of any materials regarding public
13	awareness, as it pertains to the health effects of
14	smoking in Cuba after Mr. Suarez left Cuba in 1967,
15	they wouldn't be relevant to this case?
16	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
17	A. I can't say that categorically.
18	BY MR. PORTAL:
19	Q. Can you offer an opinion in this case that
20	Mr. Suarez was aware of and believed any public
21	statements regarding the health effects of smoking in
22	Cuba that were issued or generated after he left the
23	island in 1967?
24	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
38
1	BY MR. PORTAL:
2	Q. And you cannot testify to that within a
3	reasonable degree of professional certainty as a
4	historian in this case, correct?
5	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
6	A. The answer would be the same, that I'm not
7	aware. I can't categorically say that he did have
8	access to them or not.
9	BY MR. PORTAL:
10	Q. So you're an expert and you've testified in
11	these cases before. Correct?
12	A. Correct.
13	Q. And you understand, in order for you to offer
14	an opinion in this case, you have to be able to
15	testify within a reasonable degree of professional
16	certainty based on your expertise as a historian as to
17	whether or not an individual, such as Mr. Suarez
18	specifically, or the public in general more likely
19	than not was aware of the health effects of smoking
20	within the community that they were present in.
21	Correct?
22	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
23	foundation.
24	A. Well, that's part of it. In this case,
39
1	in the depositions that information about risks of
2	smoking was exchanged between him and his family in
3	Cuba.
4	BY MR. PORTAL:
5	Q. Are you referring to a one-week visit that
6	occurred in 1979, when Mr. Suarez -- it was the one
7	and only time, you understand that he had returned to
8	Cuba since leaving in '67. Correct?
9	A. That's what I'm referring to.
10	Q. And what you're referring to is just whatever
11	communications by his family -- for instance, his
12	sister and parents -- may or may not have conveyed to
13	him during that one-week visit. Correct?
14	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
15	A. No. It goes beyond that.
16	BY MR. PORTAL:
17	Q. What else are you basing that on?
18	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
19	BY MR. PORTAL:
20	Q. What other information are you referring to?
21	MR. COTTON: Form.
22	A. I'm basing that on information from the
23	depositions, particularly his sister, where she makes
24	it very clear that there was telephone communication
40
1	subject of smoking and health.
2	BY MR. PORTAL:
3	Q. As you sit here today, though, can you
4	testify that more likely than not, within a reasonable
5	degree of professional certainty, any communications
6	regarding the public awareness of the health effects
7	of smoking in Cuba, as it was known to Cuban citizens,
8	was communicated to Mr. Suarez and/or that he believed
9	them?
10	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
11	A. When you say communicated, do you mean
12	through the letters and phone calls?
13	BY MR. PORTAL:
14	Q. You're the expert for the defense in this
15	case, correct?
16	A. That is correct.
17	Q. I take it that your testimony that you intend
18	to offer in this case is that, number one, there was
19	public awareness about the health effects of smoking
20	at or around the time periods that Mr. Suarez was
21	alive and smoking. Correct?
22	A. Throughout his lifetime.
23	Q. And, further, you intend to offer opinions as
24	to whether or not Mr. Suarez specifically was aware of
41
1	them. Is that true?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. In every case in which you've testified in
4	tobacco-related litigation on behalf of the defendant
5	cigarette companies, like R.J. Reynolds and Philip
6	Morris, your testimony has always been, has it not,
7	that there's public awareness about the health effects
8	of smoking during the particular plaintiff-smoker's
9	lifetime and that that particular plaintiff-smoker
10	believed those statements regarding the health effects
11	of smoking ?
12	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
13	A. Certainly aware of that information.
14	BY MR. PORTAL:
15	Q. You've never testified in any tobacco
16	litigation case that there was no public awareness
17	about the health effects of smoking and that that
18	smoker, the plaintiff-smoker, had not somehow been
19	communicated or became aware of those statements?
20	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
21	A. Can you recast the question?
22	BY MR. PORTAL:
23	Q. Sure. The scope of your opinions that you
24	intend to offer in this case -- the Suarez case --
42
1	the health effects of smoking during Mr. Suarez's
2	lifetime. Correct?
3	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
4	A. That's one of them.
5	BY MR. PORTAL:
6	Q. Secondly, you intend to offer opinions that
7	Mr. Suarez, this smoker, specifically was aware of
8	these public statements of the health effects of
9	smoking and believed them. Correct?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. Is it correct that, in every case where
12	you've testified as a defense expert on behalf of the
13	defendant tobacco companies, including R.J. Reynolds
14	and Philip Morris, you've offered the same exact
15	opinion as it pertains to the plaintiff-smoker?
16	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
17	foundation.
18	A. I can't tell you whether it was exact or not.
19	BY MR. PORTAL:
20	Q. As you sit here today, you agree that, in all
21	of the cases you've testified for the defendant
22	tobacco companies, you've testified that there was
23	public awareness about the health effects of smoking
24	during that plaintiffs lifetime. Correct?
43
1	A. That was part of the testimony, yes.
2	BY MR. PORTAL:
3	Q. And then every single case that you've
4	testified on behalf of the defendant tobacco
5	companies, including R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris,
6	you've offered opinions that the plaintiff-smoker was
7	aware of those statements about the health effects of
8	smoking during his or her lifetime. Correct?
9	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
10	foundation.
11	A. That is correct.
12	BY MR. PORTAL:
13	Q. Which is, in this case -- obviously, there
14	are other details -- but, generally speaking, it's the
15	same opinions that you're going to offer in this case.
16	Correct?
17	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
18	A. I don't agree with the fact that it's the
19	same opinions because I don't know what questions I
20	will be asked.
21	BY MR. PORTAL:
22	Q. But certainly those two opinions you have
23	formulated in this case and you do anticipate
24	rendering those opinions, correct?
44
1	A. Can you repeat the two opinions?
2	BY MR. PORTAL:
3	Q. Sure. Let's go to what's been premarked as
4	Plaintiffs' Exhibit 12. It is the defendant R.J.
5	Reynolds' expert witness disclosure. I ask you to
6	take a look at that. Specifically look at pages 23,
7	24 and 25 of that disclosure.
8	A. Okay. I'm on 23.
9	Q. You've seen this disclosure before, correct?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. In reviewing the disclosures contained on
12	pages 23, 24 and 25, regarding the scope of your
13	opinions in this case, you agree with what's disclosed
14	here. Correct?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. So based on the scope of your opinions
17	as contained herein, it says, "Dr. Martinez-Fernandez
18	will testify about the information disseminated to the
19	public concerning the fact some people, once they
20	start smoking, find it very difficult to quit."
21	Do you see that?
22	A. What page?
23	Q. I'm sorry. Page 23. In fact, why don't you
24	read into the record under the paragraph titled
45
1	read that into the record.
2	A. "Dr. Martinez-Fernandez is expected to
3	testify about the history of the use of tobacco and
4	cigarettes in Cuba and the United States. He will
5	also testify about the information disseminated to the
6	public in Cuba and the United States, including
7	Florida and New Jersey, concerning the health risks
8	associated with smoking cigarettes and the public's
9	knowledge of those risks. In addition,
10	Dr. Martinez-Fernandez will testify about the
11	information disseminated to the public concerning the
12	fact that some people, once they start smoking, find
13	it very difficult to quit. Dr. Martinez may also
14	comment on the opinions expressed by other witnesses
15	in the case to the extent that they are related to his
16	area of expertise."
17	Q. Is that your understanding of the subject
18	matter of your testimony that you intend to offer in
19	this case?
20	MR. COTTON: Object to form. He's got
21	four more paragraphs that summarize the
22	substance of that opinion.
23	BY MR. PORTAL:
24	Q. Understood. But you understand that that's
46
1	A. It is the subject. And the rest of the page
2	and part of the following -- actually up to page 25 --
3	expands on that.
4	Q. All right. So going back to my original
5	question, which is --1 understand there's details
6	here involving awareness of smoking health effects in
7	Cuba, in Florida and New Jersey, and there's details
8	you intend to offer about that. Correct?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. But, generally speaking, if you were to take
11	the sum and substance of your opinions, as you've
12	testified in prior cases, it's your opinion that there
13	was public awareness about the dangers of health and
14	that Mr. Suarez was aware of those dangers of smoking
15	and believed them?
16	MR. COTTON: Object to form. Can you
17	read that back?
18	(The reporter read back the last
19	question.)
20	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
21	A. That's only part.
22	BY MR. PORTAL:
23	Q. That part of your opinion is the same part of
24	the opinions that you've rendered in each of the cases
47
1	case, correct?
2	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
3	foundation.
4	BY MR. PORTAL:
5	Q. As it pertains to the particular specific
6	smoker.
7	A. Can you repeat the specific fact again?
8	Q. Sure. Let me just ask you this way. Have
9	you ever testified that the plaintiff-smoker was not
10	aware of the dangers of smoking during that smoker's
11	lifetime?
12	A. I don't recall that.
13	Q. No. Have you ever testified that it was your
14	opinion that, more likely than not, the
15	plaintiff-smoker did not believe that there was
16	dangers of smoking that was made aware in the public
17	domain?
18	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
19	A. That's not accurate.
20	BY MR. PORTAL:
21	Q. What case have you testified such that the
22	plaintiff-smoker didn't believe the public awareness
23	regarding the health effects of smoking?
24	MR. COTTON: Object to form,
1	A. I would really have to look at the
2	transcripts of those testimonies.
3	BY MR. PORTAL:
4	Q. As you sit here today, do you recall any case
5	where you said that?
6	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
7	A. About the belief, I really don't recall any
8	case.
9	BY MR. PORTAL:
10	Q. Let's go back to this housekeeping and we'll
11	get back to your opinions.
12	MR. COTTON: We've been going about an
13	hour. Is it a good time for a comfort break?
14	MR. PORTAL: Let me just finish this.
15	MR. COTTON: Okay.
16	BY MR. PORTAL:
17	Q. I believe we left off on Exhibit 10. This,
18	again, is another composite exhibit similar to
19	Exhibit 9 regarding your review of certain articles
20	and publications, but it pertains to Cubans in Miami.
21	Correct?
22	A. To Cuban Miami, yes.
23	Q. Exhibit 11, we have already discussed. That
24	is the composite containing your correspondence in
1	A. That is correct.
2	Q. Then, lastly, Exhibit 12 is what we just
3	discussed, which is your expert witness disclosure.
4	Have we now attached -- other than the actual
5	depositions and discovery responses that you reviewed,
6	have we attached all the other materials within the
7	universe of materials that you've reviewed and are
8	going to be relying on?
9	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
10	BY MR. PORTAL:
11	Q. Strike that. You indicated to us that you
12	have two exhibits to a depo which were the ads from
13	Bohemia and Carteles, which are not here today.
14	Correct?
15	A. Correct.
16	Q. Other than those two documents and the
17	missing invoice, are there any other documents that
18	you have that you reviewed and you are relying on in
19	formulating your opinions that you have not brought
20	with you today?
21	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
22	A. These reflect what I was asked to bring.
23	BY MR. PORTAL:
24	Q. And I just want to make sure there's no other
50
1	any additional notes, memos, e-mails, anything of that
2	nature, which you've done in the course of formulating
3	your opinions and which you intend to rely on in this
4	case?
5	A. I don't think so.
6	Q. Now, the trial in this case is scheduled for
7	January of 2014. As it stands today, do you
8	anticipate being called to testify at the trial?
9	MR. COTTON: Object to form, calls for
10	speculation.
11	A. I'm not sure whether that will be the case.
12	BY MR. PORTAL:
13	Q. In the past, you've testified live at trial
14	on behalf of the defendants. Correct?
15	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
16	A. I-
17	BY MR. PORTAL:
18	Q. In the past, you have been called to testify
19	live at trial on behalf of the defendants, correct?
20	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
21	A. I've been asked to testify.
22	BY MR. PORTAL:
23	Q. All I'm getting at is, you've given trial
24	testimony before, correct?
1	Q. In each of those instances, in rendering your
2	opinions at trial, have you prepared a demonstrative,
3	such as a PowerPoint, to assist in rendering your
4	opinions ?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. So in this case, have you created -- even if
7	it's an early draft -- a PowerPoint or similar type of
8	demonstrative regarding your opinions ?
9	A. I have not.
10	Q. But if you were to be called to testify at
11	the trial in January, would you anticipate creating
12	such a demonstrative PowerPoint presentation like
13	you've done in the past?
14	A. I don't know that for sure. What I can tell
15	you is about the past, and that has been the case in
16	the past.
17	MR. PORTAL: Let's take a break.
18	(Brief recess.)
19	BY MR. PORTAL:
20	Q. Back on the record. Doctor, I want to talk a
21	little bit now about, first, your background. You are
22	a professor of history at the University of Central
23	Florida, correct?
24	A. Correct.
52
1	understand you're of Cuban descent. You were born in
2	Cuba?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. You left when you were approximately
5	two-years-old, correct?
6	A. Correct.
7	Q. From what I understand, you left Cuba, you
8	came to Miami, Florida for some brief moment of time
9	with your family when you were young?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. When did your family and you leave Cuba?
12	Strike that. Did you leave with your family when you
13	first left Cuba?
14	A. Yes, I did.
15	Q. And what year was that?
16	A. That was June of 1962.
17	Q. So you were born sometime in 1960?
18	A. '60.
19	Q. So you were born after the revolution shortly
20	after Fidel Castro came into power?
21	A. That's right.
22	Q. At two-years-old, I take it, you didn't
23	attend any grammar school in Cuba. Correct?
24	A. No.
53
1	and you came to Miami, Florida. How long were you in
2	the United States for?
3	A. It was actually in June. Not approximately.
4	Q. So in June of 1962, your family emigrated
5	from Cuba and went to the United States. Correct?
6	A. Correct.
7	Q. And you lived for a brief time period in
8	Miami, Florida, right?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. How long was that?
11	A. I can't tell you whether it was one month or
12	two months. In the ballpark of perhaps three months.
13	That's what I've been told.
14	Q. Just a couple months then approximately?
15	A. Yeah.
16	Q. At that point, your family then moved to
17	Lima, Peru?
18	A. Correct.
19	Q. Where you lived for some eight to ten years
20	until sometime in 1970 or early 1970s?
21	A. Eight years.
22	Q. So then in 1970, is that when your family
23	moved and relocated to Puerto Rico?
24	A. Correct.
54
1	A. The first place we moved is a municipality of
2	Bayamon, which is part of the metropolitan area of --
3	Q. Of San Juan, Puerto Rico?
4	A. -- of San Juan.
5	Q. Puerto Rico, is that where you attended high
6	school and ultimately went to the University of Puerto
7	Rico?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. So in terms of your personal knowledge
10	regarding Cuba and any public awareness regarding what
11	was known in Cuba as it pertains to the health effects
12	of smoking, fair to say you were too young to really
13	have ascertained or have any personal firsthand direct
14	knowledge of that?
15	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
16	A. When I lived there?
17	BY MR. PORTAL:
18	Q. Correct.
19	A. I don't have any recollection.
20	Q. I understand that you had a grandfather who
21	lived in Cuba up until not too long ago or is he still
22	alive?
23	A. He's still alive.
24	Q. Good for you. And he's still in Cuba,
1	A. Correct.
2	Q. Have you ever been to the island of Cuba
3	after you left when you were two-years-old?
4	A. Yes, I have.
5	Q. How many times?
6	A. It's between nine and ten.
7	Q. When was the first time that you returned to
8	Cuba and when was the most recent time that you've
9	been there?
10	A. I believe the first time was 1994 and I
11	believe the last time may have been 2003.
12	Q. So in terms of any public awareness regarding
13	the health effects of smoking in Cuba during
14	Mr. Suarez's lifetime, while he lived in Cuba --
15	meaning the late '30s, '40s, '50s and up to 1967 --
16	you would have no direct firsthand personal knowledge.
17	Correct?
18	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
19	A. It is direct because I've researched it.
20	BY MR. PORTAL:
21	Q. In terms of firsthand knowledge, you have
22	none. Correct?
23	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
24	A. Some of them are primary materials that I've
25	used, but firsthand knowledge as to being there and
56
1	seeing or hearing anything during the time when
2	Mr. Suarez was there, the answer is no.
3	BY MR. PORTAL:
4	Q. In the course of doing your research and
5	review of materials, have you actually spoken with any
6	eyewitnesses who provided to you firsthand eyewitness
7	accounts regarding smoking and public awareness of
8	smoking in Cuba? And I'm going to limit it to the
9	time period that Mr. Suarez was a smoker in Cuba.
10	So for purposes of predicate, I'll represent
11	to you that Mr. Suarez began smoking around
12	approximately 18 or 19-years-old, sometime in 1957 or
13	1958, and continued to smoke until he left Cuba in
14	1967. So that's the timeframe that I'll provide to
15	you -- 1955, let's say, to 1967.
16	With that in mind, have you spoken with any
17	eyewitnesses who provided to you their accounts of
18	what the public awareness was regarding the health
19	effects in Cuba during that time period?
20	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
21	A. I don't recall specifically about awareness.
22	BY MR. PORTAL:
23	Q. Did you speak with any eyewitnesses who were
24	alive around that time in Cuba regarding just a
57
1	males -- and I'll put that at, say, age 18 to 30 years
2	of age -- during that timeframe -- and their exposure
3	to American brand cigarettes in Cuba?
4	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
5	A. I don't recall those specific aspects.
6	BY MR. PORTAL:
7	Q. Do you have an understanding as to whether or
8	not American brand cigarettes, and specifically
9	cigarettes from the defendants R.J. Reynolds and
10	Philip Morris, were exported to and sold and
11	distributed in Cuba in the 1950s and early 1960s?
12	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
13	foundation.
14	A. Can you repeat the question?
15	BY MR. PORTAL:
16	Q. Sure. I've gone through some -- not all --
17	of the 5,000 documents of your reliance materials. In
18	there it contained several documents regarding Cuban
19	archived materials, Cuban magazines and articles that
20	talk about the incidence of smoking in Cuba, both
21	Cuban cigarettes and American cigarettes. Correct?
22	A. There's information on both.
23	Q. So as you sit here today, based on your
24	review of the material regarding cigarette smoking in
58
1	understanding that American brand cigarettes,
2	specifically R J. Reynolds' Camel cigarettes and
3	Winston cigarettes and Philip Morris's Marlboro
4	cigarettes, were sold and distributed in Cuba during
5	that time period?
6	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
7	A. I have seen evidence to the effect that
8	Camels were advertised and sold. I'm not sure about
9	the other two brands.
10	BY MR. PORTAL:
11	Q. Based on your review of the documents,
12	materials, depositions and in speaking with
13	individuals from that timeframe, do you have an
14	understanding as to the popularity of RJ. Reynolds'
15	Camel brand cigarettes in Cuba in terms of rankings
16	with other American brand cigarettes?
17	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
18	foundation.
19	A. I can say that American cigarettes were a
20	very small minority of what was sold and consumed in
21	Cuba. As far as the popularity of Camels, vis-a-vis
22	other US cigarettes, if that's the question, I vaguely
23	remember that they were perhaps the ones who were sold
24	the most, but this is a vague recollection.
1	Q. You certainly read testimony from the fact
2	witnesses in this case, including Mr. Tapanes,
3	Mrs. Suarez, Migdalia Suarez, the decedent's sister,
4	and some other folks, who have testified to the fact
5	that, amongst the American brand cigarettes sold and
6	distributed in Cuba during this timeframe, Camel
7	cigarettes were the most or the number-one ranked
8	cigarette. Correct?
9	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
10	foundation.
11	A. I don't remember that fact off the top of my
12	head, whether that was mentioned or not in the
13	depositions.
14	BY MR. PORTAL:
15	Q. Is there anything that you've read, or based
16	on your understanding of the role of American
17	cigarettes in Cuba, that would be inconsistent with
18	that, meaning that Camels were in fact amongst the
19	most popular, if not the most popular, brand of
20	American cigarette sold and distributed in Cuba at the
21	time?
22	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
23	foundation.
24	A. Could you repeat that, please?
1	BY MR. PORTAL:
2	Q. Based on your knowledge of the sale and
3	distribution of American cigarettes in Cuba during the
4	1950s and early '60s, would you agree that Camel brand
5	cigarettes were amongst the most popular, if not the
6	most popular, American brand cigarette sold in Cuba?
7	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
8	foundation.
9	A. I can't speak specifically to the issue of
10	popularity. What I vaguely recall was that Camels
11	were towards the top of the list of the most sold
12	American cigarettes in Cuba, which, again, all
13	American cigarettes combined were a very small
14	minority of what was consumed.
15	BY MR. PORTAL:
16	Q. Thank you for that last portion. I
17	understand you said that. But if I represent to you
18	that the witnesses -- certain fact witnesses --
19	including Migdalia Suarez, the decedent's wife
20	Mrs. Suarez, Mr. Tapanes and others, had testified to
21	the effect that, amongst young Cuban males ages
22	ranging 18 to 30, Camel brand cigarettes were amongst
23	the more popular of American brand cigarettes, if not
24	the most popular, in terms of volume, use and sale, is
61
1	or you believe would be inconsistent with the facts?
2	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
3	foundation.
4	A. I would like to see the segments in which
5	that kind of information that you're mentioning
6	appears.
7	BY MR. PORTAL:
8	Q. Well, I understand. You have the depositions
9	here. Feel free to refer to them, but I'm asking you
10	to assume that that's what they have testified to. So
11	for purposes of my question, if I'm asking you to
12	assume that that's what they've said, based on your
13	understanding as a historian -- you've looked at Cuba
14	and smoking trends in Cuba and health issues regarding
15	smoking in Cuba during those timeframes --is there
16	anything about those statements that you would say,
17	"You know what? That's inconsistent. That's not what
18	I remember. It just doesn't make any sense to me."
19	MR. COTTON: Object to form. I've lost
20	track now of what we're talking about.
21	BY MR. PORTAL:
22	Q. I think you understand the question, don't
23	you, Dr. Martinez-Fernandez?
24	A. I understand the question. My answer is --
62
1	the question? I don't understand the
2	question.
3	MR. PORTAL: Well, the witness is
4	answering. Let him answer the question.
5	MR. COTTON: Read back the question,
6	please.
7	(The reporter read back the last
8	question.)
9	MR. COTTON: I'll object to form.
10	BY MR. PORTAL:
11	Q. Now you can answer.
12	A. My response is that I don't want to assume
13	anything. In order for me to reply to your question,
14	I would like --1 would need to see the specific parts
15	of the depositions that, as you say, refer to that.
16	Q. We can certainly do that, but to not delay
17	this any more than we need to -- as a general
18	statement, you would agree that, based on your
19	understanding of historical facts as it pertains to
20	American brand cigarettes in Cuba -- and I think you
21	already testified to this -- Camel certainly was
22	amongst the most popular in terms of use by young
23	Cuban males. Correct?
24	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
1	A. No.
2	BY MR. PORTAL:
3	Q. Why not?
4	A. First of all, because I don't think I
5	mentioned popularity. I may have mentioned sales.
6	And, secondly, I have no way of knowing whether that
7	range of ages and men --1 have no foundation to speak
8	to that.
9	Q. In terms of your background, you're a
10	professor of history. You told us that. You've
11	published, I believe, three books. Correct?
12	A. I think there's four, at least, and some
13	monographs.
14	Q. As it pertains to Cuba, I'm aware of three
15	books -- "Torn Between Empires."
16	A. Right.
17	Q. The second is "Frontiers, Plantations and
18	Walled Cities," correct?
19	A. It deals with Cuba.
20	Q. Right. And then third, it's a list of essays
21	on Hispanic Caribbean, I think, is what you refer to
22	it as.
23	A. Can I refer to my curriculum vitae?
24	Q. Sure. By all means, feel free to do so.
64
1	MR. PORTAL: His publications, his books.
2	THE WITNESS: You're talking about books
3	specifically?
4	MR. COTTON: They're all listed. Is
5	there something he's looking for is my
6	question.
7	BY MR. PORTAL:
8	Q. It's very simple, Dr. Martinez-Fernandez. I
9	asked you about books that you've published in this
10	area as it pertains to Cuba or to Hispanics in the
11	Caribbean. I've identified three books. You thought
12	there might be a fourth, right?
13	A. Yes. I was not sure about the number so I'm
14	going to check on this list.
15	"Frontiers, Plantations and Walled Cities,"
16	that is a book that covers Cuba. I was chief editor
17	of the "Encyclopedia of Cuba." Another book is
18	"Protestantism and Political Conflict in the
19	Nineteenth-Century Hispanic Caribbean." Another book
20	is "Fighting Slavery in the Caribbean." Another book
21	is "Torn Between Empires."
22	As far as books that have already been
23	published, that's what is accurate as reflected here.
24	I have, however, finished "The History of the Cuban
65
1	University Press of Florida.
2	Q. Of all of those publications, is it fair to
3	say that you never published on the topic of the
4	public awareness of smoking hazards and the addictive
5	nature of smoking?
6	A. In those publications, I've touched upon the
7	topic of tobacco, but not specifically the issue of
8	awareness.
9	Q. And I've read your depositions in multiple
10	cases and trial testimony. In all of those, you
11	testified that you've never published, whether
12	peer-reviewed articles, books or as such, regarding
13	public awareness of the health risks of smoking and
14	addictive nature of smoking.
15	Is that still true today?
16	A. I've researched it for many years, but I've
17	never published on that subject.
18	Q. And that's my question. In terms of
19	publishing a book or publishing peer-reviewed
20	articles, you've never done such a thing specifically
21	as it relates to the public awareness of smoking
22	hazards and the addictive nature of smoking. Is that
23	correct?
24	A. I may have mentioned something about the
66
1	Q. Which one was that?
2	A. I believe that would be, "Fighting Slavery in
3	the Caribbean." But that was a comment, not based on
4	research.
5	Q. So as it pertains to -- now let's break it
6	down even further -- public awareness of smoking
7	hazards and the addictive nature of smoking in Cuba in
8	the 1930s, '40s, '50s and '60s, you have not
9	published. Correct?
10	A. That is correct.
11	Q. And as far as it pertains to the public
12	awareness of smoking hazards and the addictive nature
13	of smoking pertaining to Hispanic smokers in the
14	United States in the 1960s, '70s, '80s and '90s, you
15	have not published. Is that correct?
16	A. Just researched, not published.
17	Q. Now, in terms of your background, you're not
18	a medical doctor. Correct?
19	A. Correct.
20	Q. You don't have any particular specialty in
21	oncology or psychiatry or addiction medicine, correct?
22	A. That is correct.
23	Q. And you have no expertise on cigarette
24	design, correct?
1	Q. Certainly, in this case, you're not offering
2	any opinions regarding smoking cigarettes containing
3	nicotine causes certain diseases like lung cancer?
4	A. Can you repeat the last part?
5	Q. Sure. In this case, you're not offering any
6	opinions regarding whether smoking cigarettes
7	containing nicotine causes certain diseases like lung
8	cancer?
9	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
10	A. Not my opinions.
11	BY MR. PORTAL:
12	Q. And you're not going to be offering any
13	opinions as to whether or not smoking is addictive,
14	correct?
15	A. Not my personal opinions.
16	Q. Nor your expert opinions, because you're not
17	an expert in that field. Is it that true?
18	A. Nor am I an expert.
19	Q. I take it then that you will be offering no
20	opinions on a smoker's ability to successfully quit
21	smoking, correct?
22	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
23	A. Not my opinions.
24	BY MR. PORTAL:
68
1	any opinions as to whether a smoker can cut down and
2	control their smoking, correct?
3	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
4	A. Not my opinions.
5	BY MR. PORTAL:
6	Q. You reviewed a number of documents regarding
7	Cuban newspapers, magazines and articles as it
8	pertains to smoking and related health disease.
9	Correct?
10	A. There were items and stories in these
11	materials that spoke to that topic, yes.
12	MR. PORTAL: I'd like to mark this as the
13	next numbered exhibit, Exhibit 13.
14	(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 13 was marked for
15	identification.)
16	MR. COTTON: Just for identification
17	purposes, the Bates number on this
18	document is 1005039743.
19	MS. VIEIRA: Can I see it one second?
20	BY MR. PORTAL:
21	Q. For the record, Dr. Martinez-Fernandez, this
22	is a document from Philip Morris dated April 1, 1954,
23	from a Mr. G.C. Dawson to Mr. George Weisman. I'll
24	ask you to take a look at it and then I'm going to ask
1	MR. COTTON: Have you ever seen
2	Exhibit 13 before?
3	THE WITNESS: This is the first time I've
4	seen this. Should I look at the second page
5	or just the first?
6	BY MR. PORTAL:
7	Q. Just page one and page two. I'll represent
8	to you that this just shows that this was a document
9	that was obtained from the Philip Morris public
10	website located at www.pmdocs.com. As previously
11	referenced, it's Bates number 1005039743.
12	Have you had an opportunity to review this
13	document right now?
14	A. I looked at it just now, yes.
15	Q. This letter dated April 1st of 1954, it's a
16	letter where it indicates that Mr. Dawson, Philip
17	Morris & Company, had recently returned from a visit
18	from Cuba. Correct?
19	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
20	foundation. The document says what it says.
21	He doesn't know who Mr. Dawson is or who he
22	works for or any of the background about this
23	document.
24	Do you, Doctor?
70
1	don't know -- I've never heard of Weisman or
2	Dawson.
3	BY MR. PORTAL:
4	Q. Are you familiar with the importation of
5	American cigarettes in Cuba during the 1940s and '50s?
6	MR. COTTON: Object to form, vague.
7	A. I don't have any information on the
8	importation itself.
9	BY MR. PORTAL:
10	Q. Have you ever heard of a company by the name
11	of Roberts Tobacco Company in Cuba?
12	A. I have.
13	Q. What do you know about the Roberts Tobacco
14	Company?
15	A. It was a distributor of imported cigarettes.
16	Q. Is it your understanding that Roberts Tobacco
17	Company imported American brand cigarettes, including
18	the defendants Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds brand
19	cigarettes, to Cuba?
20	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
21	foundation, calls for speculation.
22	A. I'm not aware of that direct connection.
23	BY MR. PORTAL:
24	Q. We'll get to that in a minute. What else do
71
1	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
2	A. What I know is they were distributors of
3	foreign cigarettes in Cuba.
4	BY MR. PORTAL:
5	Q. In this letter that you have that's been
6	marked Exhibit 13, it refers to "our agent, Mr. Alex
7	M. Roberts." Do you see that in the first sentence?
8	A. I see that.
9	Q. Do you have any understanding as to whether
10	or not Roberts Tobacco Company was owned and operated
11	by Mr. Alex Roberts?
12	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
13	foundation, calls for speculation.
14	A. I don't know that.
15	BY MR. PORTAL:
16	Q. Do you know who ran and operated the Roberts
17	Tobacco Company in Cuba?
18	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
19	A. I don't know.
20	BY MR. PORTAL:
21	Q. In this letter, it reads, "On a recent visit
22	from Cuba, our agent, Mr. Alex M. Roberts, brought up
23	the question of the publicity on cancer. He informed
24	the writer that Cuba has the highest consumption in
72
1	incidence of cancer. He has promised to send us full
2	data as soon as possible."
3	First of all, did I read that right?
4	MR. COTTON: I'll object to the form.
5	Obviously the document speaks for itself.
6	The second line, I can't tell if that's an
7	"on" or an "of". The document says what it
8	says.
9	BY MR. PORTAL:
10	Q. What I read was right, right?
11	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
12	A. You read it accurately.
13	BY MR. PORTAL:
14	Q. Now, in preparing for your testimony today,
15	you looked exactly at this issue, right -- the
16	publicity of cancer in Cuba and the incidence of
17	smoking-related cancer in Cuba during this timeframe.
18	Correct?
19	MR. COTTON: Object to form,
20	mischaracterizes testimony.
21	A. I don't remember at this point any
22	information on incidence.
23	BY MR. PORTAL:
24	Q. Fair enough. Do you intend to offer any
73
1	certainty, regarding the incidence of cancer among
2	Cuban smokers in Cuba in the 1950s and '60s?
3	A. I don't know whether I'm going to be asked
4	that question.
5	BY MR. PORTAL:
6	Q. That's not my question, Doctor. My question
7	is: As you sit here today, have you formulated an
8	opinion within a reasonable degree of professional
9	certainty as to the incidence of cancer amongst
10	smokers in Cuba in the 1950s and 1960s?
11	A. No, I haven't.
12	Q. And it indicates that, based on this letter,
13	that, although there's a high consumption of
14	cigarettes in Cuba, they have the lowest incidence of
15	cancer.
16	Is there anything that you've reviewed or
17	read that in any way would contrast or dispute that
18	statement?
19	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
20	foundation.
21	A. I don't know for a fact, nor have I seen
22	information as to whether Cuba was the world's largest
23	consumer of cigarettes per capita. Neither do I
24	recall having read anything about Cuba having the
1	BY MR. PORTAL:
2	Q. In the course of reviewing your information,
3	you have some handwritten notes that you prepared
4	regarding certain articles, including -- one of them
5	was a document from the Cuban archives entitled, "How
6	Many Millions of Dollars to Cubans Spend on
7	Cigarettes?" Is that correct?
8	A. Can I see it?
9	MR. PORTA: Sure. We'll mark this as
10	Exhibit 14.
11	(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 14 was marked for
12	identification.)
13	MR. COTTON: Did you say he has notes
14	about it?
15	MR. PORTAL: We're going to mark the
16	document and I have his notes, but we'll get
17	to that in a minute.
18	BY MR. PORTAL:
19	Q. Doctor, let me show you what's been marked
20	Exhibit 14. You've reviewed this document before,
21	correct?
22	A. Yes, I have.
23	Q. In fact, it's one of the documents listed in
24	your 181-page reliance materials -- strike that. It
75
1	reliance material list, correct?
2	A. I don't recall that specifically.
3	Q. I'll represent to you that that document
4	attached as Exhibit 14 was retrieved from the disk
5	provided to us and is identified in your reliance
6	list.
7	Any reason to dispute that?
8	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
9	A. If you say so, I'll take your word.
10	BY MR. PORTAL:
11	Q. Do you have the originals of all of your
12	handwritten notes? What's been produced here are just
13	the copies. Where are the originals?
14	MR. COTTON: The yellow pads ?
15	BY MR. PORTAL:
16	Q. I see you have some of the documents in front
17	of you. Are those your notes?
18	A. These are the originals.
19	Q. Can I see those real quick, please? Okay.
20	The originals that you've produced here today, these
21	are from yellow legal pad pages and they correspond to
22	what's been marked as Exhibit 4, Exhibit 5 and
23	Exhibit 6. Correct?
24	A. That's correct.
76
1	materials, Composite Exhibit 2 -- and specifically I'm
2	referring to APS-3126. It's actually document number
3	5,300 on page 178 of your reliance materials. It's
4	identified as notes on Cuban materials.
5	Do you see that?
6	A. Notes on Cuban materials.
7	Q. And the image number is APS-003126, correct?
8	A. Correct.
9	Q. I only brought one copy, which is my
10	handwritten notes -- my notes on your notes.
11	MR. COTTON: Do you want to mark that as
12	an exhibit?
13	MR. PORTAL: No.
14	BY MR. PORTAL:
15	Q. Where are these notes? I can show you my
16	copy of it. They weren't produced here today
17	separately printed out? Is there another set of --
18	MR. COTTON: They're on the disk.
19	MR. PORTAL: They're on the disk?
20	BY MR. PORTAL:
21	Q. Do you still have those original notes?
22	A. I keep the notes, and, yeah, I should have
23	them.
24	Q. They're not here today. That's why I'm
25	asking you --
77
1	MR. COTTON: They're here. They're on
2	the disk.
3	MR. PORTAL: No. The original notes are
4	not here.
5	MR. COTTON: We've got copies of the
6	notes. We've got copies of lots of things,
7	including the notes.
8	MS. VIEIRA: He didn't bring originals of
9	any of the documents that are on the CD. He
10	only brought originals of the stuff you
11	didn't already have.
12	MR. PORTAL: What we'll do then on a
13	break, we'll print out a clean copy for you,
14	Dr. Martinez-Fernandez, and we'll attach that
15	as Exhibit 15 to your deposition, which is
16	going to be the notes contained in document
17	number 5,300 as previously identified.
18	(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 15 was marked for
19	identification.)
20	BY MR. PORTAL:
21	Q. In this document -- it's a composite
22	exhibit -- on pages 143 through 145 of number 5,300,
23	there's handwritten notes. It looks like it contains
24	a summary of a document from 1957.
78
1	A. I see it.
2	Q. In fact, those are your notes -- number
3	one -- correct?
4	A. These are my notes.
5	Q. Those are your notes based on your review of
6	what's been marked as Exhibit 14 to your deposition,
7	the Cuban archives material. Correct?
8	A. Let me double-check. Yes.
9	Q. Can you just read into the record that
10	portion referencing the 1957 Cuban archives article so
11	that we can go back in case we can't read your
12	handwriting?
13	A. First it says 1957. Quotation mark, Cubans
14	are among the smokiest people in the world, end of
15	quotation. And then six million equals five million
16	packs of cigs, 16 million packs of imported cigs most
17	US. And then there's another quotation mark. There
18	is no doubt that Cuban cigarettes are considered to be
19	the purest and healthiest in the world. End of
20	quotation. Another quotation --
21	Q. They contain a minimum of nicotine?
22	MR. COTTON: He gets to decide the
23	handwriting. Are you able to read it or not?
24	THE WITNESS: They contain a minimum of
79
1	and the majority of the brands are subjected
2	to a long cleaning and purifying process, end
3	of quote.
4	MR. COTTON: Is this quoting from an
5	article?
6	BY MR. PORTAL:
7	Q. In fact, Doctor, so that we're all on the
8	same page, Exhibit 14 -- if you turn to page two of
9	that article and you go to the second paragraph where
10	it says page 71, do you see that?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. In fact, the quotations that you've just read
13	into the record come from that paragraph, correct?
14	A. They come from that paragraph.
15	Q. Right.
16	MR. COTTON: So your notes are quoting
17	from that document?
18	THE WITNESS: Yes.
19	BY MR. PORTAL:
20	Q. What you've written there is the quotation
21	that Cuban cigarettes are considered to be the purest
22	and healthiest in the world, correct?
23	A. You mean in the document or my notes?
24	Q. What you took from the document and what
80
1	statement, correct?
2	A. Purest and healthiest in the world -- purest
3	and healthiest in the world. Yes, they correspond.
4	Q. You also quoted a document for saying that
5	they, meaning Cuban cigarettes, contain a minimum of
6	nicotine. Correct?
7	A. They contain a minimum of nicotine.
8	Q. Same paragraph, second sentence.
9	A. They contain a minimum of nicotine.
10	Q. Okay. In fact, if you turn to the bottom of
11	page three and page four of six of Exhibit 14, the
12	actual article --
13	A. Page three.
14	Q. And then if you continue reading your notes,
15	if you could read those into the record where you left
16	off, regarding the quantity of nicotine in American
17	brand cigarettes versus Cuban brand cigarettes. Let
18	me restate the question.
19	Can you please read into the record your
20	handwritten notes where it addresses the quantity of
21	nicotine in American brand cigarettes versus Cuban
22	brand cigarettes?
23	MR. COTTON: Are you talking about
24	excerpts from the same article?
81
1	Dr. Martinez-Fernandez has noted in his
2	handwritten document.
3	BY MR. PORTAL:
4	Q. And feel free to turn to the next page of
5	your handwritten notes as well.
6	A. There is information on the level of nicotine
7	in US cigarettes and Cuban cigarettes.
8	Q. And what information, if any, did you
9	document regarding the comparison of nicotine levels
10	of Cuban cigarettes versus American cigarettes as
11	reflected in the actual document Exhibit 14?
12	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
13	A. So the question again?
14	BY MR. PORTAL:
15	Q. Exhibit 15 is your handwritten notes, your
16	summary, essentially, of what you took from the actual
17	document Exhibit 14. Correct?
18	A. That is correct.
19	Q. That's information --1 take it that you
20	would have documented information that you felt was
21	relevant and important information for you in
22	reviewing these materials. Correct?
23	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
24	foundation.
25	A. Relevant or potentially relevant.
82
1	BY MR. PORTAL:
2	Q. Fair enough. And part of what you documented
3	was that, as reflected on Exhibit 14, the quantity of
4	nicotine in American brand cigarettes -- and, in
5	particular, Camel brand cigarettes -- was identified
6	as 2.21 percent versus a much lower percent in Cuban
7	brand cigarettes listed at 1.05 percent. Correct?
8	A. That's what the document reflects and that's
9	what my notes reflect.
10	Q. In fact, Exhibit 14 also refers to various
11	medical articles published both in the American
12	Medical Journal, as well as Wright and Moffat
13	published in The Journal of the American Medical
14	Association, regarding the lower level of nicotine
15	percentage in Cuban cigarettes versus American
16	cigarettes. Correct?
17	MR. COTTON: Object to form. If you're
18	asking about what the article covers, he's
19	going to have to look at the article.
20	MR. PORTAL: He's got both of them in
21	front of him. He's got both his notes of
22	what he read and the document.
23	BY MR. PORTAL:
24	Q. Doctor, I'm referring to the little chart you
83
1	article on top and the medical article on bottom on
2	page four of six of Exhibit 14.
3	MR. COTTON: The article says what it
4	says in there. What are you looking for him
5	to confirm it says?
6	MR. PORTAL: The question stands and it's
7	referring to his notes.
8	MR. COTTON: Object to form. The exhibit
9	speaks for itself.
10	A. There's mention of one book and one article.
11	BY MR. PORTAL:
12	Q. The chart that's on page four of six appears
13	to be based on information gleaned from an article in
14	the American Medical Journal from a Dr. Bauer.
15	Do you see that?
16	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
17	foundation.
18	A. I can't reach that conclusion based on what
19	I'm reading.
20	BY MR. PORTAL:
21	Q. So the information here is, you're saying,
22	from a book that was published by Dr. Bauer entitled,
23	"The Poison of Nicotine." Correct? And then
24	published with the permission of the Medical American
1	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
2	foundation, calls for speculation.
3	A. I'm not saying that.
4	BY MR. PORTAL:
5	Q. Tell me what you're saying. Maybe we can
6	clarify it for the record.
7	A. A man by the name of Dr. Bauer published a
8	book entitled, "The Poison of Nicotine." That's a
9	book. In this book --
10	MR. COTTON: For the record, you're just
11	reading from the article at this point,
12	aren't you?
13	THE WITNESS: Yes. Not what I said
14	before, but it's based on what I'm reading.
15	MR. COTTON: Okay. Are you familiar with
16	Dr. Bauer and his publication?
17	MR. PORTAL: Hold on, Mr. Cotton. It's
18	my deposition. You get to ask questions when
19	it's your turn.
20	MR. COTTON: I'm saying-
21	MR. PORTAL: No, no, no. You're not
22	coaching the witness anymore. I've given you
23	a lot of leeway here. Object to form and you
24	can ask your question when it's your turn.
1	Number one, this is an article containing
2	his reliance materials, which you produced to
3	us, which, not only are they contained in
4	reliance materials, but he summarized in his
5	own handwritten notes. So I'm entitled to
6	ask him questions, because, clearly, he's
7	reviewed it and he's relying on it. So
8	that's what I'm doing here today. That's the
9	question.
10	BY MR. PORTAL:
11	Q. All right, Doctor.
12	A. My answer is: There is mention of a book by
13	Dr. Bauer entitled, "The Poison of Nicotine." And
14	then there's a statement that talks about permission
15	of the American Medical Journal. I don't -- from what
16	appears here, it's not clear what the connection
17	between the journal and the book is.
18	Q. Understood. But the conclusion from --
19	strike that -- the data that comes from the book and
20	the publication, however it is that was ultimately
21	produced is what is in front of you, which is what you
22	documented -- what that reflects is that Cuban
23	cigarettes have approximately 1.05 percent of nicotine
24	as compared to American brand cigarettes, including
86
1	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
2	foundation.
3	A. No, I didn't say that, because, again,
4	there's mention of two -- there's just mention of a
5	specific book and there's mention of a journal. So
6	from this, I can't tell where it came from.
7	BY MR. PORTAL:
8	Q. But certainly what you documented -- strike
9	that. What you took from this article and what you
10	documented was the fact that, as reflected here, Cuban
11	brand cigarettes had lower nicotine levels than
12	American brand cigarettes. Right?
13	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
14	A. Cuban cigarettes had 1.5 and all of the
15	brands that are American have a higher nicotine
16	percent.
17	BY MR. PORTAL:
18	Q. Now, you also pulled -- and are part of your
19	reliance materials -- and I'll attach that as
20	Exhibit 16. Let's mark Exhibit 17 too.
21	(Plaintiffs' Exhibits 16 and 17 were
22	marked for identification.)
23	BY MR. PORTAL:
24	Q. Let me show you what we marked as Exhibit 16
87
1	you and then I'll ask you some questions.
2	MR. COTTON: Do you have any extra copies
3	for us?
4	MR. PORTAL: Sorry. That's what I've
5	got.
6	BY MR. PORTAL:
7	Q. Doctor, before we get to Exhibits 16 and 17,
8	I do have some further questions regarding Exhibit 14.
9	Let's do that before we move on so we can be
10	consistent here.
11	What you documented and what this article
12	reflects -- Exhibit 14 -- was the fact of the rising
13	levels of Cuban consumption of American cigarettes
14	from the late 1930s to the mid 1950s, particularly in
15	1956. Correct?
16	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
17	A. There's information on rising consumption of
18	US cigarette packs.
19	BY MR. PORTAL:
20	Q. In fact, you documented there that they had
21	risen from some 2.2 million packages in 1939 to
22	16.8 million packages by 1956. And that's also
23	consistent with the actual article in front of you
24	right there. I'll refer you to page two of six of
1	A. Sorry. Did you say page six?
2	Q. Two of six.
3	A. What appears in the document is consistent
4	with what appears in my notes.
5	Q. Then there's also -- if you could read into
6	the record the rest of your notes, there's a mention
7	there of Cuban cigarettes being healthier and having,
8	I believe, lower levels of furfural --1 think you
9	wrote down there. Can you just tell me what you wrote
10	there?
11	A. In Cuba, many doctors have proven and
12	demonstrated bad effects of US cigarettes. It
13	mentions some examples. And then there's a table on
14	the content of nicotine with information on some of
15	the brands: 3.11 percent, Piet Mount; 2.21, Camel;
16	1.94, Marlboro; 1.26, Benson & Hedges; 1.05, Cuban.
17	Almost no furfural.
18	Q. And that's, for the record, F-U-R-F-U-R-O-L.
19	Correct?
20	A. I'd have to look at this one.
21	Q. I'll make it easier. I'll just represent
22	that's in, at least, the document at the top of page
23	five of six.
24	A. Okay.
1	A. No potassium-40, and, in quotations,
2	cancerous substance, end of quote.
3	Q. On page five of six of Exhibit 14, the term
4	"furfurol" is used in connection with aldehyde, which
5	irritates the bronchial tubes and the larynx, and its
6	effects are worse than those of nicotine.
7	A. Page five?
8	Q. Yes. That's what the document states, right?
9	A. It says that it irritates bronchial tubes and
10	the larynx. Its effects -- referring to furfural --
11	are worse than those of nicotine. Then I'm going to
12	read the last sentence.
13	Q. Please.
14	A. "All tobacco in the world, with the exception
15	of Havana tobacco, contain furfurol in a greater or
16	small quantity, the analysis published in 'The Lancet'
17	show."
18	Q. And you can read the next paragraph. It's
19	one sentence.
20	A. "It should also be noted that studies of the
21	ash of Havana tobacco show that qualitatively it does
22	not contain potassium 40 (K-40), the cancerous
23	substance found in the ash of other tobaccos."
24	Q. And then if you could just read the last
90
1	it says, "nicotine and tar," starting with "It can be
2	definitely stated."
3	A. "It can be definitely stated that Cuban
4	cigars and cigarettes are the pures" — P-U-R-E-S —
5	"and healthiest in the world. They do not contain,
6	therefore, any substances which may be considered
7	injurious to the health, and much less which can
8	produce diseases of the gravity of cancer."
9	Q. And that, along with what we had previously
10	read on page two of six, is consistent with what you
11	had documented in your notes, being that there's no
12	doubt Cuban cigarettes are considered to be the purest
13	and healthiest in the world. Right?
14	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
15	A. Is that on the second page? The only
16	difference is that, in the original, it appears -- the
17	word appears "pures," and in my notes, "purest."
18	BY MR. PORTAL:
19	Q. Page two of six. It says, "purest." We
20	already read that into the record.
21	A. Oh, it does? 206?
22	Q. Page two of six.
23	A. I read "purest." Now you're referring to
24	another segment?
91
1	It's says, "purest and healthiest." Two of six starts
2	with the premise that Cuban cigarettes are the purest
3	and healthiest, and the conclusion, after all the
4	data, is, again, that they're the purest and the
5	healthiest. Correct?
6	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
7	A. Which paragraph?
8	BY MR. PORTAL:
9	Q. It's what you read here, Doctor -- "There is
10	no doubt that Cuban cigarettes are considered to be
11	the purest and healthiest in the world," which is what
12	you wrote in your notes?
13	A. Correct.
14	Q. Doctor, now I want to turn your attention to
15	the two documents in front of you, Exhibits 16 and 17.
16	MR. COTTON: Before we go too far, we've
17	been going another hour or so. I don't know
18	how much you time you want to spend on this,
19	but --
20	MR. PORTAL: These two exhibits go hand
21	in hand. Why don't we finish those and then
22	we'll break for lunch in about 10 or 15
23	minutes?
24	MR. COTTON: Fair enough.
1	Q. So if you could turn your attention to
2	Exhibits 16 and 17, please?
3	A. Okay.
4	Q. I will represent to you that Exhibit 16
5	has -- you see on the bottom -- your image number. It
6	comes from the CDs that you or defense counsel had
7	produced to us -- APS-5958. That's a document that
8	you've reviewed and you're relying on in your
9	testimony. Right?
10	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
11	A. Yes, I have reviewed it and I will rely or
12	potentially rely on it.
13	BY MR. PORTAL:
14	Q. This is an article that appears in a Cuban
15	newspaper, Diario de la Marina. Correct?
16	A. Correct.
17	Q. Dated October 10, 1954, right?
18	A. October 10, 1954.
19	Q. And in this article that you've referenced,
20	it talks about the determination of nicotine in
21	cigarettes. Right?
22	MR. COTTON: Go ahead and read the
23	article.
24	A. I would like to have the full picture of the
1	BY MR. PORTAL:
2	Q. Doctor, this is from your reliance. This is
3	what you produced. So take your time to read it.
4	And just for the record, while the doctor is
5	reading, this is document number 985 contained on
6	page 35 of Dr. Martinez-Fernandez's reliance list.
7	A. Okay, I read it as well as I could, given the
8	quality.
9	Q. It's your document, Doctor, so I can only go
10	with what I have.
11	A. This is a copy.
12	Q. I understand, but it was produced to us on a
13	CD just --
14	MR. COTTON: He looked at it.
15	BY MR. PORTAL:
16	Q. First of all, this Exhibit 16, a newspaper
17	article, it refers to, actually, an American
18	scientific study. Correct?
19	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
20	A. Yes, it's an American scientific study.
21	BY MR. PORTAL:
22	Q. It was actually regarding a study conducted
23	in New York by the Foster D. Snell, Inc. entity,
24	right?
1	Q. With the Dr. J. Mitchell -- it's a bit
2	illegible -- Fain, F-A-I-N, director of the group
3	investigators for that firm?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. This article -- basically what it's talking
6	about is a summary of what these Americans scientists
7	at Foster D. Snell had found regarding nicotine in
8	cigarettes, right?
9	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
10	A. Nicotine in cigarettes, yes.
11	BY MR. PORTAL:
12	Q. Now, I also want you to turn now to
13	Exhibit 17, which you have before you. This is an
14	article in Spanish. You see this is an article -- it
15	look like it is from the Boletin de la Liga Contra el
16	Cancer.
17	First of all, you are familiar with La Liga
18	Contra el Cancer?
19	A. Yes, I am.
20	Q. In fact, throughout your reliance materials
21	for Cuba, you have literally tens, if not hundreds, of
22	documents from La Liga Contra el Cancer. Right?
23	A. I would say tens, not hundreds.
24	Q. But certainly you're familiar with the entity
95
1	you've listed on your reliance materials. Right?
2	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
3	A. Correct.
4	BY MR. PORTAL:
5	Q. And La Liga Contra el Cancer originated in
6	Cuba. It was The League Against Cancer, right?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. And then subsequently recreated here in the
9	United States some years later, correct?
10	A. Correct.
11	Q. And this article that we've attached as
12	Exhibit 17, again, is referencing a study performed by
13	the same entity as referenced in Exhibit 16, Foster D.
14	Snell, Inc. in New York, regarding the levels of
15	alquitran y nicotina?
16	MR. COTTON: For the record, it's unclear
17	to me whether Dr. Martinez-Fernandez has seen
18	this document before.
19	Have you seen this before?
20	THE WITNESS: I believe so.
21	BY MR. PORTAL:
22	Q. In fact, this is a document that was -- it's
23	also Bates-stamped 501875052 and also made available
24	to the public through the Legacy website, which is
96
1	document.
2	A. Let me say something about this.
3	Q. Sure.
4	A. I looked at numerous issues of the Boletin de
5	la Liga Contra el Cancer. I believe, but I'm not
6	100 percent sure, that I've seen this one in
7	particular.
8	Q. That's fine. First of all, for the record, I
9	used the word -- this talks about the content of
10	alquitran. That, you understand, is tar, right --
11	that's what they're talking about?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Nicotina means nicotine, right?
14	A. Correct.
15	Q. So what this study is, it's based on a study
16	performed by Foster D. Snell, Inc. from New York
17	regarding the content of tar and nicotine in the four
18	Cuban cigarette brands of highest sales or volume.
19	Right?
20	MR. COTTON: If he's going to speak to
21	what the document addresses, he's going to
22	have to read the document.
23	MR. PORTAL: Let's take a break while you
24	read that document. Once you're done with
97
1	(Brief recess.)
2	BY MR. PORTAL:
3	Q. Ready?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. So we're talking about Exhibit 17. This is
6	an article that talks about tar and nicotine levels in
7	Cuban cigarettes versus American cigarettes based on a
8	study conducted by Foster D. Snell, Inc. in the United
9	States sometime, it looks like, in 1954.
10	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
11	BY MR. PORTAL:
12	Q. Is that consistent with what you read in
13	reviewing this document?
14	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
15	A. There's another study in the same piece.
16	BY MR. PORTAL:
17	Q. Correct.
18	A. So there are two studies.
19	Q. All right. Essentially what this study
20	concludes is that, of the three most smoked Cuban
21	brands in Cuba, as compared to the three most American
22	brands smoked in Cuba, the Cuban cigarettes had less
23	nicotine. Right?
24	MR. COTTON: Object to form, the document
1	A. (No response.)
2	BY MR. PORTAL:
3	Q. By way of reference, Doctor, I'm looking at
4	page 123 of this document. It's the last page.
5	A. The last page?
6	Q. Bottom paragraph of the last page.
7	A. I want to have something clear. There are
8	two different studies in these two articles that
9	appear side by side. For the first one, we're talking
10	about four Cuban brands and this is the study
11	conducted in New York. The second study is a
12	different one, which is the comparative one, and that
13	includes three brands of Cuban cigarettes and three
14	brands of US cigarettes.
15	Q. Okay. The conclusion, you would agree, is
16	that, when comparing the Cuban brand cigarettes to
17	American brands cigarettes smoked in Cuba, the Cuban
18	brand cigarettes had less nicotine?
19	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
20	foundation.
21	A. You're referring to the second study, the
22	Cuban study?
23	BY MR. PORTAL:
24	Q. Yes. Looking at the summary and the studies
99
1	you draw?
2	A. I'm going to refer to the authors so it's
3	clear. Drs Gonzalo E. Arostegui and Antonio
4	Navarrete, who are of the Tobacco and Cancer
5	Commission of La Liga Contra el Cancer, which is a
6	Cuban organization. And the title of this study is,
7	"Estudio Del Contenido De Alquitran Y Nicotina En Los
8	Cigarrillos De Las Marcas Mas Fumadas En Cuba."
9	So as I understand it, your question pertains
10	to this study that I just mentioned?
11	BY MR. PORTAL:
12	Q. Right.
13	A. Okay. And the question again is?
14	Q. That the conclusion drawn from this study by
15	Drs Arostegui and Navarrete, and in comparison with
16	the studies from Foster D. Snell, Inc., is that the
17	Cuban brand cigarettes -- strike that -- the Cuban
18	brand cigarettes most smoked in Cuba contain less
19	nicotine than the three most smoked American brands in
20	Cuba?
21	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
22	foundation, document speaks for itself.
23	A. The Cuban brands contain less nicotine than
24	the United States brands.
1	Q. And that would corroborate or further support
2	the same conclusions that were drawn from Exhibit 14,
3	the Cuba archives documents, and the notes that you
4	took from it. Right?
5	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
6	foundation, beyond the witness's expertise.
7	BY MR. PORTAL:
8	Q. Meaning that these documents are consistent
9	in that the Cuban brand cigarettes have lower nicotine
10	than the American brand cigarettes?
11	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
12	foundation, beyond the witness's expertise.
13	A. I can only read these documents as a layman.
14	BY MR. PORTAL:
15	Q. Yes.
16	A. As a layman, the first document that we
17	talked about, which was from Gente Magazine stated
18	that Cuban cigarettes had less nicotine than US
19	cigarettes. Also, as a layman, I read in this second
20	document, which is the study carried out by the
21	Cubans, that Cuban cigarettes had less nicotine than
22	the United States cigarettes.
23	Q. So that this scientific study that was
24	conducted by Drs Arostegui and Navarrete would further
101
1	Magazine article?
2	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
3	foundation, beyond the witness's expertise.
4	A. I can't comment on that specifically because
5	I am not aware of the differences or comparing the
6	methods of these two studies. What I can tell you is
7	the information that they contain, which I just
8	expressed to you.
9	BY MR. PORTAL:
10	Q. Which would be consistent with each other,
11	right?
12	MR. COTTON: Objection, form, asked and
13	answered, beyond the witness's expertise.
14	A. I don't understand what you mean by
15	consistency.
16	BY MR. PORTAL:
17	Q. Dr. Martinez-Fernandez, you pulled documents
18	that you want to rely on regarding public awareness of
19	the health effects of smoking. Amongst the documents
20	that you researched and have produced as part of your
21	reliance materials includes this article from the
22	Cuban archives from Gente Magazine, Exhibit 14, and
23	this news article regarding an American study done on
24	nicotine in cigarettes regarding Foster D. Snell, Inc.
102
1	the studies with Foster D. Snell, Inc. by Cuban
2	doctors and these three documents, two of which are in
3	your reliance materials.
4	All come to one consistent conclusion, which
5	is Cuban brand cigarettes, when compared to American
6	brand cigarettes in the time period of the mid 1950s,
7	contain lower nicotine in the Cuban cigarettes.
8	Right?
9	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
10	foundation, the documents speak for
11	themselves.
12	A. I don't want to use the word "consistency,"
13	because that would require me to know more about the
14	way they were carried out. What I can tell you is
15	that in the news item -- well -- in the first study
16	and the second study, there's information to the
17	effect that Cuban cigarettes have less nicotine than
18	American cigarettes.
19	BY MR. PORTAL:
20	Q. By the way, you reviewed a lot of documents
21	both from the United States and Cuba regarding public
22	awareness of the dangers of smoking, including
23	scientific articles published by different medical
24	doctors. Right?
103
1	Q. Are you familiar with Dr. Wynder?
2	A. I am familiar with him.
3	Q. Are you familiar with several studies that he
4	published in the turn of the 20th century, around the
5	time of the 1950s, regarding cigarettes, nicotine and
6	all that stuff. Right?
7	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
8	A. I'm familiar with those studies, yes.
9	BY MR. PORTAL:
10	Q. Did you ever see any studies that were
11	authored with Dr. Wynder and Dr. Arostegui and
12	Dr. Navarrete, the ones that are referenced in that
13	article?
14	A. I don't recall that for a fact.
15	Q. Would that surprise you?
16	MR. COTTON: Object to form, calls for
17	speculation.
18	A. Would what surprise me?
19	BY MR. PORTAL:
20	Q. The fact that these Cuban doctors,
21	Drs Arostegui and Navarrete, coauthored medical
22	documents with Dr. Wynder.
23	A. I'd like to see the source of that
24	information so I can comment on it.
104
1	way or the other. Is that right?
2	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
3	A. I'm not sure one way or the other.
4	MR. PORTAL: Let's break for lunch.
5	MR. COTTON: Okay.
6	(Lunch recess.)
7	BY MR. PORTAL:
8	Q. Dr. Martinez-Fernandez, we talked earlier
9	about the Roberts Tobacco Company and you had
10	mentioned that you're familiar with the name as they
11	were distributors of foreign cigarettes in Cuba.
12	Correct?
13	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
14	A. Yes, correct.
15	BY MR. PORTAL:
16	Q. And you understood, based on your review of
17	the documents both in this case and just in your
18	general knowledge of Cuban history, that Roberts
19	Tobacco Company, amongst certain products, imported
20	R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris brand cigarettes into
21	Cuba. Right?
22	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
23	foundation.
24	A. I've seen their ads including those
1	BY MR. PORTAL:
2	Q. In fact, I'll show you what will be our next
3	numbered exhibit. I believe we are up to 18.
4	(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 18 was marked for
5	identification.)
6	BY MR. PORTAL:
7	Q. Let me identify it for the record and then
8	I'll ask you questions. It's a document dated
9	December 16, 1947, Bates-stamped 504272986, and then
10	there's two attachments, 502472713 and 502472712.
11	Doctor, are you familiar with William Esty
12	Company?
13	A. William Esty Company?
14	MR. COTTON: He asked if you're familiar
15	with that company.
16	THE WITNESS: I'm not familiar with that
17	company.
18	BY MR. PORTAL:
19	Q. You're not familiar with William Esty being
20	one of the, if not the principal, advertising
21	companies for R.J. Reynolds?
22	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
23	foundation.
24	A. I don't remember the name or that connection.
1	Q. I will represent to you that William Esty
2	Company is an advertising agency in the United States
3	who, throughout the years, including the '40s and '50s
4	and continuing onward, did a lot of the advertising
5	for R.J. Reynolds. As a predicate for my next set of
6	questions, I just want you to assume that. Okay?
7	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
8	foundation.
9	A. (No response.)
10	BY MR. PORTAL:
11	Q. On this letter, this exhibit that we've
12	attached as Exhibit 18, it is a letter from the
13	William Esty Company to the Advertising Department at
14	R.J. Reynolds Tobacco and it references advertisement
15	for Camel brand cigarettes in several foreign
16	newspapers, including in Cuba as well as Puerto Rico.
17	Do you see that?
18	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
19	foundation, the document speaks for itself.
20	A. Earlier you asked me to "let's assume." I'm
21	taking your word rather than assuming.
22	BY MR. PORTAL:
23	Q. Sure, that's fine.
24	MR. COTTON: The document says what it
107
1	BY MR. PORTAL:
2	Q. This document, Exhibit 18, as referenced
3	here -- Doctor, as it's stated here -- it pertains to
4	ads that are for Camel brand cigarettes to be
5	published in foreign newspapers, including those in
6	Cuba and Puerto Rico.
7	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
8	foundation, document speaks for itself.
9	A. That is the subject.
10	BY MR. PORTAL:
11	Q. Right. In fact, in the second paragraph, it
12	also references certain ad numbers, where it says, for
13	example, 1-5255, as well as 1-5259, both of which are
14	attached to this composite exhibit. I'll ask you to
15	take a quick look at those.
16	MR. COTTON: Object to the form, lack of
17	foundation.
18	BY MR. PORTAL:
19	Q. And you see that these ads that are
20	referenced in the letter, some of those are attached
21	to this composite exhibit, correct, as referenced
22	there?
23	A. Documents with the same numbers ?
24	Q. Yes, sir.
1	Q. And those documents are copies of what appear
2	to be ads for Camel brand cigarettes in the Spanish
3	language, right?
4	A. That's what they appear to be.
5	Q. And it references the Roberts Tobacco
6	Company, Havana, Cuba?
7	A. Let me take back what I said and clarify.
8	I'm not sure whether they're ads or proofs of ads.
9	Q. Understood. But certainly they're from --
10	they reference Camel brand cigarettes. That's an RJ.
11	Reynolds product, correct?
12	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
13	A. Yes, they're Camel ads.
14	BY MR. PORTAL:
15	Q. And it lists Roberts Tobacco Company on each
16	of these documents, whether they're proofs or ads.
17	Right?
18	A. The name Roberts Tobacco Company appears.
19	I'm not sure whether it's part of the ad itself or it
20	relates to the information below.
21	Q. And underneath there, where it says ad number
22	1-5255, it reads, "This advertisement appears in:" --
23	and it has a list of publications all in Cuba. Right?
24	A. Yes.
109
1	Marina in Havana, Cuba?
2	A. It includes that, yes.
3	Q. And it also includes Bohemia magazine
4	published in Havana, Cuba?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. So when you said earlier, "I don't know if
7	these are proofs or ads," it certainly appears that,
8	whether it's a proof or an ad, this is the depiction
9	that was published, as referenced here, the
10	advertisement that appears in these Cuban newspapers
11	and magazines. Right?
12	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
13	foundation, calls for speculation.
14	A. I can't say for sure whether it's the same.
15	BY MR. PORTAL:
16	Q. Now, you've reviewed in the course of
17	preparing for your testimony in this case, as well as
18	your general historical review of Cuban documents, the
19	Diario de la Marina newspaper in Cuba. Correct?
20	A. Correct.
21	Q. And you also reviewed and seen the Bohemia
22	magazine, correct?
23	A. Correct.
24	Q. And you've also seen Carteles magazine?
1	Q. And in your review of those magazines, do you
2	recall ever coming across cigarette advertisements for
3	RJ. Reynolds' Camel brand cigarettes as those that
4	are depicted in this document?
5	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
6	A. Not these in particular. These are quite
7	early, from '47.
8	BY MR. PORTAL:
9	Q. Let me show you then what we'll mark as
10	Exhibit 19.
11	(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 19 was marked for
12	identification.)
13	MR. COTTON: Did you intend it to be the
14	black-and-white and the color?
15	MR. PORTAL: Yes. We'll go ahead and
16	just mark these also.
17	(Plaintiffs' Exhibits 20, 21 and 22 were
18	marked for identification.)
19	MR. COTTON: Did you look at Exhibit 19?
20	THE WITNESS: 19,1 looked at.
21	BY MR. PORTAL:
22	Q. And you have 20 and 21 and 22. Why don't you
23	take a look at those too?
24	Ready?
1	Q. Dr. Martinez-Fernandez, we have attached now
2	to your deposition as Exhibits 19, 20 and 21 what are
3	exemplars of advertisements for Cuban -- strike that.
4	We have attached as Exhibits 19, 20 and 21 what are
5	exemplars of advertisements for RJ. Reynolds' Camel
6	brand cigarettes in Cuban magazines in the 1940s and
7	'50s, and particularly in the Bohemia magazine.
8	Have you seen those?
9	MR. COTTON: Object to form. Are you
10	asking if he's seen them before today?
11	BY MR. PORTAL:
12	Q. I'm just telling you that that's an exemplar
13	set that's been produced to you. You've had an
14	opportunity to look at those now, right?
15	A. When you say exemplar set, I want to make
16	sure I understand what you mean.
17	Q. Meaning, we haven't obviously attached every
18	single advertisement. This is a sample set of ads
19	that appeared in some of the magazines, particularly
20	in Bohemia, regarding Camel brand cigarettes.
21	A. Which is not reflective of the diversity of
22	ads that appeared in this magazine?
23	Q. It's not reflective of all the advertisement
24	that R.J. Reynolds conducted in Cuba regarding its
112
1	are some of the ads and I just want to ask you some
2	questions. All I'm telling you is, what I provided to
3	you, that's what it appears to represent. Right?
4	MR. COTTON: Object to form,
5	mischaracterizes testimony.
6	A. It's not reflective of the universe of ads
7	that appear in Bohemia pertaining to cigarettes.
8	BY MR. PORTAL:
9	Q. Correct.
10	A. Yeah.
11	Q. So you're certainly aware that Camel
12	cigarettes, R.J. Reynolds' product, were advertised in
13	Bohemia magazine, just like the type of exemplar set
14	that's been produced and marked here today. Right?
15	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
16	A. I would feel more comfortable with the word
17	"example" than the word "exemplar."
18	BY MR. PORTAL:
19	Q. That's fine. You feel more comfortable with
20	examples than exemplars?
21	A. They're examples.
22	Q. And certainly you see that, in each of these
23	magazine advertisements for the Camel brand
24	cigarettes, there's a reference to the distributor
1	A. In all three, yes.
2	Q. And, additionally, we've attached as
3	Exhibit 22 to your deposition a printout, I'll
4	represent to you, from the R.J. Reynolds public
5	document website at www.rjrtdocs.com, where the search
6	term -- if you look at the top of the page -- see
7	where it says "Roberts Tobacco" right here?
8	A. It says "Roberts Tobacco."
9	Q. In fact, based on that search query and as
10	reflective here right underneath Roberts Tobacco, it
11	says it produced some 76 results.
12	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
13	foundation.
14	BY MR. PORTAL:
15	Q. Correct, that's what it says?
16	A. It says 76. I do have an issue with this
17	list, however.
18	Q. Well, first of all, answer my question. It
19	does list, in terms of documents produced, that there
20	are 76 records. And each one of those 76 are what's
21	actually attached and part of this composite as listed
22	here?
23	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
24	foundation.
114
1	BY MR. PORTAL:
2	Q. It's numbered. You don't have to count them.
3	You can just read them. It's 1 through 20; and it
4	continues 21 through 40 and 41 through 76.
5	MR. COTTON: Objection, lack of
6	foundation, the document speaks for itself.
7	BY MR. PORTAL:
8	Q. Is that right?
9	MR. COTTON: Same objection, form, lack
10	of foundation.
11	A. This is a very incomplete list which includes
12	76 examples.
13	BY MR. PORTAL:
14	Q. But certainly you agree that, at least as it
15	pertains to the R.J. Reynolds website -- and obviously
16	I'm not asking you to testify as an IT expert as to
17	how they scanned in their documents and how they OCR'd
18	the document, so when you put in the words "Roberts
19	Tobacco," which documents come up or don't. I'm not
20	asking you all that.
21	All I'm simply asking you is, if you put the
22	term "Roberts Tobacco" into their website, you get a
23	result of 76 records and that's at least what's
24	reflected here?
115
1	foundation.
2	A. I can't say that one way or another.
3	BY MR. PORTAL:
4	Q. All right. Bottom line,
5	Dr. Martinez-Fernandez, what you do as a historian is
6	you go back in time and you look at documents, you
7	research documents and you try to put them in
8	historical perspective. Correct? It's part of what
9	you do?
10	A. That's right.
11	Q. That's part of what you call a historical
12	method -- one of the steps that you perform, right?
13	A. That's correct.
14	Q. In doing that, in going back and looking at
15	these documents now before you, where you have the
16	reference to Roberts Tobacco as a distributor, your
17	understanding of Roberts Tobacco as an exporter of
18	foreign cigarettes in Cuba, and now the reference to
19	each of these Camel ads referencing Roberts Tobacco
20	Company, as well as the William Esty Company ad proofs
21	and approvals -- using that historical method, what,
22	if anything, do you, as a historian, conclude from
23	that?
24	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
1	A. Well, it would take me some time to really
2	digest these documents. But one thing that I would
3	not do, as a professional historian, is limit the
4	sampling to a few dates which are way back in the
5	past, including '47 and '48. So I don't know what
6	range -- what they were looking for when they did
7	this. But the latest one is 1950.
8	So that, in and of itself, is problematic and
9	I would be very critical of that. I don't know
10	whether it's a complete list; I don't know if there
11	were other dates available. But this is very
12	incomplete as far as the whole record of Bohemia
13	during the lifetime of Suarez.
14	BY MR. PORTA:
15	Q. You would agree then that, beyond 1947,
16	you've seen ads for Camel cigarettes in Bohemia dating
17	into the late '50s -- '59, for example, correct?
18	A. In Bohemia, as late as 1959.
19	Q. Okay.
20	A. But I must add something.
21	Q. Please.
22	A. They don't have this kind of wording that
23	appears in the late '40s up to 1950. The ads are
24	very, very different.
117
1	cigarettes, including Roberts Tobacco -- same Roberts
2	Tobacco you see in the 1940s -- that are then again
3	listed in the 1950s, including up to 1959. Right?
4	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
5	A. As far as this document goes, up to 1950.
6	BY MR. PORTAL:
7	Q. Right.
8	A. There --
9	MR. COTTON: What is the question? I
10	didn't quite follow that question.
11	MR. PORTAL: You know, you're
12	interrupting the witness from answering.
13	You've done this a couple times. He clearly
14	understood because he was answering the
15	question. Let him answer, please.
16	MR. COTTON: Go ahead and read the
17	question.
18	MR. PORTAL: Let the witness finish his
19	answer first and then you can have it read
20	back.
21	MR. COTTON: Please read back the
22	question.
23	THE REPORTER: Well, what do I do?
24	MR. COTTON: Would you like the question
1	MR. PORTAL: No, no, no. With all due
2	respect, you've been doing this time and time
3	again. It's a blatant attempt to coach this
4	witness. With all due respect, please stop.
5	MR. COTTON: All I asked was to have the
6	question repeated.
7	MR. PORTAL: There's no reason for it
8	when you're interrupting the witness from
9	answering. If he has a problem with the
10	question --
11	BY MR. PORTAL:
12	Q. You understood my instructions at the
13	beginning of the depo, right,
14	Dr. Martinez-Fernandez -- if you don't understand the
15	question, don't answer it. Ask me and I'll be happy
16	to re-ask it to you.
17	A. I remember that, yes.
18	Q. And you didn't ask me to re-ask the question.
19	You understood my question when I asked it, right?
20	A. I understood it, but now I don't know what it
21	is.
22	MR. PORTAL: Of course, of course. So...
23	MR. COTTON: Would you like her to read
24	back the question?
119
1	THE REPORTER: "But, certainly, ads for
2	Camel brand cigarettes, including Roberts
3	Tobacco -- same Roberts Tobacco you see in
4	the 1940s -- that are then again listed in
5	the 1950s, including up to 1959. Right?"
6	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
7	THE WITNESS: It's the same name, Roberts
8	Tobacco. I see that for ads in the 1950s --
9	sorry -- in 1950 and late '40s. And if I
10	look at this whole set, this is also from
11	1950. That is Exhibit 19. Exhibit 20 is for
12	1959. And this one I don't believe has a
13	date. I'm referring to Exhibit 21.
14	BY MR. PORTAL:
15	Q. I'll represent to you that it's 1959. Be
16	that as it may, all of those reference the Roberts
17	Tobacco Company for the Camel ad, right?
18	A. Excuse me. I actually just read in hand. It
19	says 1958.
20	Q. All right. Dr. Martinez-Fernandez, you're
21	aware that, in addition to the print ads for these
22	American brand cigarettes in Cuba, there was also a
23	radio advertisement in Cuba for American brand
24	cigarettes. Correct?
120
1	A. I don't know that for a fact. What I can
2	tell you is that Cuban cigarettes dominated the
3	airwaves as sponsors of major programs and I've never
4	read or heard anything to that effect relating to US
5	brands.
6	MR. PORTAL: We'll go ahead and mark
7	Exhibit 23 and 24 to your deposition and ask
8	you some questions about that.
9	(Plaintiffs' Exhibits 23 and 24 were
10	marked for identification.)
11	BY MR. PORTAL:
12	Q. While Mr. Cotton is looking at these, I'll
13	just put into the record that Exhibit 23 is
14	Bates-stamped 50016333 and Exhibit 24 is Bates-stamped
15	500228053.
16	A. I'm done with 23.
17	Q. Okay. First of all, Exhibit 23 has been
18	attached to your deposition. It appears to be radio
19	ads from December of 1951. This is from the William
20	Esty Company regarding R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company
21	and Camel radio ads, as I indicated.
22	First of all, you've had an opportunity now
23	to review Exhibit 23, correct?
24	A. Yes, I have.
121
1	what purports to be radio advertisements for Camel
2	cigarettes and announced in different foreign radio
3	stations, including radio stations in Cuba -- CMBF and
4	CMQ.
5	Do you see that?
6	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
7	foundation.
8	A. I see that, but I don't agree with the
9	statement that you made that these are ads that were
10	actually heard or planned. I don't see anywhere
11	explaining what the reality is.
12	Certainly, the date typed doesn't tell me
13	much about when they were -- if they were actually
14	read on the radio.
15	BY MR. PORTAL:
16	Q. Well, as you sit here today, whether
17	reviewing this document or based on any other
18	document, do you have information that there was no
19	radio advertisement for any cigarettes in Cuba during
20	this timeframe?
21	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
22	A. I can't say one way or another.
23	BY MR. PORTAL:
24	Q. Fair enough. As you sit today, you just
122
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. Fair enough. Moving on. Exhibit 24, take a
3	look at that.
4	A. I've looked at the document.
5	Q. Exhibit 24 is a document entitled,
6	"Advertising Costs for 1956." And then it appears to
7	be a list of costs of advertising Camels in 1956 with
8	the different line items for where those costs were
9	spent.
10	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
11	foundation, calls for speculation.
12	A. Honestly, I don't know the origin of this
13	document. I don't know where it was found. I don't
14	know who to attribute it to. There's no way of me
15	attributing this document. So that does not really
16	allow me to speak to this document the way I should.
17	BY MR. PORTAL:
18	Q. On page three of this document where it says,
19	"Costs of advertising Camels-1956," do you see that?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. In there is a line item for advertising in
22	Cuba. Do you see that?
23	MR. COTTON: Object to form, document
24	speaks for itself.
123
1	is has an amount connected to it.
2	BY MR. PORTAL:
3	Q. What is that amount?
4	A. I'm not aware of what currency this is. It's
5	18 million --18 million, 336 and 70.
6	MR. COTTON: Object to form,
7	mischaracterizes -- the number is what it is.
8	It's not 18 million. We all know it's not
9	18 million.
10	THE WITNESS: I'm very sorry. My glasses
11	are not working well after all these hours.
12	It's 18,336.70.
13	BY MR. PORTAL:
14	Q. Again, this document would suggest that, in
15	fact, RJ. Reynolds was advertising its Camel
16	cigarettes in Cuba during this timeframe?
17	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
18	foundation.
19	A. I can't tell that from this document to be
20	honest with you. I don't know the origin. There's no
21	explanation to what this is. There's an item which I
22	just read the amount of 18,336.70. I don't know what
23	the currency is. Based on what I have here, I can't
24	agree with what you said.
1	Q. When was it, to your knowledge, that R.J.
2	Reynolds stopped exporting its Camel brand cigarettes
3	to Cuba?
4	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
5	foundation.
6	A. I can't tell you exactly when they ended
7	exporting them to Cuba.
8	BY MR. PORTAL:
9	Q. Now, you're familiar with the history of Cuba
10	and the Cuban Revolution and the current Cuban
11	government, correct?
12	A. I just finished a book on that subject.
13	Q. So you have a lot of knowledge about that,
14	correct?
15	A. I'm an expert in that area.
16	Q. So let's talk about the Cuban Revolution and
17	the embargo. First of all, under President
18	Eisenhower, is it fair to say that there was initially
19	a partial embargo that was put into place in 1960?
20	A. That is correct.
21	Q. What was the partial embargo and when did
22	that start specifically in 1960?
23	A. (No response.)
24	Q. Does October 19, 1960 sound familiar?
125
1	Q. The partial embargo initiated by President
2	Eisenhower in 1960, did that include a prohibition of
3	the exportation of American brand cigarettes to Cuba
4	to your knowledge?
5	A. I don't remember that specific item.
6	Q. In February of 1962, now John F. Kennedy is
7	President of the United States?
8	A. Correct.
9	Q. On February 7th of 1962, there is additional
10	movement in terms of implementation of the embargo.
11	And then in March and October of 1962, there's further
12	restrictions placed by the embargo. Correct?
13	A. That is correct.
14	Q. To your knowledge, did any of those
15	restrictions as part of the embargo prevent or stop
16	the exportation of RJR's Camel brand cigarettes to
17	Cuba?
18	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
19	A. Yes.
20	BY MR. PORTAL:
21	Q. So when along that timeline do you believe
22	that the embargo would have limited the exportation of
23	the Camel brand cigarettes to Cuba?
24	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
1	A. As I said, I'm not sure about the one during
2	Eisenhower. I would have to check on that. But I'm
3	certain that, by the second one under Kennedy, that
4	that was not allowed --US exports of cigarettes to
5	Cuba.
6	BY MR. PORTAL:
7	Q. And President Kennedy's embargo, so to
8	speak -- the full embargo -- that would have taken
9	place somewhere along -- that continued between
10	February and October of 1962?
11	MR. COTTON: Objection to form,
12	mischaracterizes.
13	A. I believe it was 1962, the early one.
14	BY MR. PORTAL:
15	Q. Now, when did American companies, including
16	companies like R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris, stop
17	advertising in Cuban print media and newspapers?
18	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
19	foundation.
20	A. I can give you a ballpark figure.
21	BY MR. PORTAL:
22	Q. Please.
23	A. I have not seen any ads beyond late 1959.
24	Q. Do you know whether the Cuban government put
25	a ban preventing American companies from advertising
111
1	in Cuba, in its print media and newspapers, such as
2	Diario de la Marina and Bohemia?
3	A. These publications were nationalized. As far
4	as a ban, per se, I have no information on that.
5	Q. Would you agree that none of the RJ.
6	Reynolds Camel brand cigarette packs that were
7	exported to Cuba in the 1950s, let's just say right up
8	before the implementation of the full embargo in
9	1962 -- you would agree none of those had any warnings
10	on the packs?
11	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
12	A. I have not seen any, which was the same as in
13	the United States at that point.
14	BY MR. PORTAL:
15	Q. On that end, going back to Composite
16	Exhibit 23, in terms of the radio advertisement for
17	Camel cigarettes -- first of all, based on your
18	testimony in other litigation, you're familiar with
19	the type of radio advertisement for American brand
20	cigarettes, particularly Camel, that was aired in the
21	United States. Correct?
22	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
23	BY MR. PORTAL:
24	Q. Let me re-ask the question. Are you aware of
128
1	cigarettes in the United States at around that time of
2	the early '50s and mid 1950s?
3	A. Not at all.
4	Q. So you can't offer an opinion one way or the
5	other, as you sit here today, as to whether or not the
6	radio ads reflected on Composite Exhibit 23 are
7	consistent with the radio ads for Camel brand
8	cigarettes in the United States?
9	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
10	foundation.
11	A. Well, first of all, I already raised a
12	question about this document -- its accuracy, who
13	produced it, the date and all of that. I read the
14	text. I am not familiar with the type of ads in radio
15	produced in the United States during this time.
16	BY MR. PORTAL:
17	Q. Fair enough. That's what I wanted to know.
18	Otherwise, you don't intend to offer an opinion that
19	the text of the radio ads in the United States for
20	Camel brand cigarettes would be different or
21	inconsistent with the text as reflected in Composite
22	Exhibit 23 because you just don't know one way or the
23	other. Is that fair?
24	A. I don't know one way or the other.
129
1	Castro and the relationship between Cuba and the
2	United States, did there come a time where the Cuban
3	government put a blackout or media restrictions in
4	terms of propaganda -- what the Cuban government
5	termed propaganda -- coming from the United States to
6	Cuba in the early 1960s?
7	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
8	A. I don't have specific data about the
9	propaganda.
10	BY MR. PORTAL:
11	Q. When was the Bay of Pigs Invasion?
12	A. April 1961.
13	Q. When was the famous standoff, so to speak, of
14	the Cuba Missile Crisis?
15	A. October 1962.
16	Q. After the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis,
17	do you know if the Cuban government put any
18	restrictions on the type of communications that were
19	being broadcast in Cuba originating from the United
20	States?
21	A. Can you repeat the question?
22	Q. Sure. I guess what I want to find out -- to
23	your knowledge, did the Cuban government put any type
24	of media ban or restrictions from information,
130
1	originated in the United States entering the island?
2	A. What I can tell you is that I have seen in
3	Cuban publications -- Bohemia in particular -- stories
4	about health issues related to smoking in the United
5	States which are included in Cuban-printed articles.
6	Q. That would've been for what timeframe?
7	A. I can't pinpoint it at this point.
8	Q. Fair to say that, by 1964 and continuing
9	through the late 1960s, tensions were very high
10	between the United States and Cuba politically?
11	A. In'64?
12	Q. Yes.
13	A. I wouldn't say beginning in '64.
14	Q. No. I'm just saying during that timeframe
15	that tensions were very high.
16	A. Between '64 and --
17	Q. End of 1960s, say '69.
18	A. Tensions were high certainly, but they were
19	not as high as they had been before.
20	Q. When did the first United States Surgeon
21	General's Report come out?
22	A. The first?
23	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
24	BY MR. PORTAL:
1	A. As far as tobacco?
2	Q. As far as tobacco.
3	A. 1964.
4	Q. Was there a subsequent report or
5	recommendations that came out in the 1960s after the
6	'64 report?
7	A. Yes, I believe so. I've seen several, yes.
8	Q. As you sit here today, do you intend to offer
9	any opinions that the United States Surgeon General's
10	Report from 1964, and the subsequent material
11	pertaining to that report, were disseminated in Cuba
12	during that timeframe?
13	A. My recollection is that, at the very least in
14	one instance, there was information on either the
15	Surgeon General's Report or similar reports being
16	produced at that time.
17	Q. What evidence do you have of that?
18	A. Because I saw it.
19	Q. What are you talking about? What did you
20	see?
21	A. I saw reference to studies. And, again, I'm
22	not 100 percent sure whether it was specifically on
23	the '64 report or whether it had to do with actions by
24	the government after 1964.
132
1	to offer opinions that Cuban citizens in Cuba,
2	including Mr. Suarez, were aware of the United States
3	1964 Surgeon General's Report in 1964 and continuing
4	into the late 1960s?
5	A. Whether they were aware or not?
6	Q. Correct.
7	A. I don't have one opinion one way or the other
8	on that.
9	Q. That's what I want to find out. You have
10	opinions regarding public awareness of the health
11	effects of smoking, right?
12	A. Yeah.
13	Q. I just want to make sure that, at trial,
14	you're not going to offer -- intend to offer any
15	opinions that Cuban citizens living in Cuba, like
16	Mr. Suarez, that the U.S. Surgeon General's Report was
17	part of the general awareness.
18	MR. COTTON: Object to form,
19	mischaracterizes.
20	A. I said previously that, in the Cuba media, I
21	saw at least one instance in which these studies --
22	and I'm not sure whether it was exactly the 1964
23	report --1 would have to go back to my notes -- in
24	which that coverage appeared in Cuban publications.
1	Q. When did those publications appear? Are you
2	talking about publications in 1970s that refer back to
3	the 1964 report? Are you talking about in 1964?
4	Specifically what are you talking about and what
5	document?
6	A. I'm talking about a publication -- it was
7	either Bohemia or Granma -- that alluded to studies in
8	the United States pointing to the fact that smoking
9	tobacco could lead to a variety of diseases. That I
10	remember.
11	Now, you will understand that I have looked
12	at thousands of documents and I really want to give
13	you an accurate answer. At this point, I can't give
14	you an answer as to whether it was in '66 or '69 or
15	'71 or any other date. I would have to go back to my
16	materials.
17	Q. And based on all the materials you reviewed,
18	you can recall just one instance where such an event
19	occurred?
20	A. One printed instance.
21	Q. So as you sit here today -- you've already
22	told us this, but I want to make sure -- you don't
23	intend to offer an opinion that Mr. Suarez, while
24	living in Cuba, before leaving in 1967, was made aware
25	of the United States Surgeon General's Report from
134
1	1964?
2	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
3	A. I don't have a way at this point of making
4	that kind of statement.
5	BY MR. PORTAL:
6	Q. Fair enough. Quickly, do you intend to offer
7	any opinions regarding the rationing of cigarettes in
8	Cuba and whether or not that had any impact on
9	Mr. Suarez?
10	A. I've read on that topic. I will be ready to
11	speak to that effect if I'm asked to speak to that
12	effect.
13	Q. Here's my opportunity to ask you all the
14	questions you intend to offer at the time. This is
15	the one opportunity I have. So what are your opinions
16	as it pertains to rationing of cigarettes in Cuba as
17	it pertains to Mr. Suarez?
18	A. There was rationing of cigarettes beginning
19	in 1962 when la libreta was established.
20	Q. Do you know what month?
21	A. I don't know what month off the top of my
22	head.
23	Q. But it started in 1962?
24	A. That's my best recollection.
1	A. And I know it rationed cigarettes, as many
2	other products, and prices were raised, and fewer and
3	fewer cigarettes were available as provided by the
4	Cuban government through the rationing system. So the
5	numbers fell, but prices went up.
6	Q. Fair to say then that it became more
7	difficult for Cuban citizens, like Mr. Suarez, to
8	obtain or access cigarettes?
9	A. I would say that every family household --
10	and, of course, it depended on the ages -- was
11	entitled to purchase cigarettes every month according
12	to the rationing system.
13	Q. But, overall, the net effect of the rationing
14	system was to decrease the access to cigarettes?
15	A. I don't know if it was a net effect or not.
16	I know that consumption dropped.
17	Q. Okay. Do you intend to offer any opinions as
18	to whether or not American brand cigarettes were still
19	accessible to Cuban citizens in Cuba post the 1962
20	embargo and continuing up to the time that Mr. Suarez
21	left in 1967?
22	A. Yes, I'm ready to speak to that.
23	Q. What is your opinion in that regard?
24	A. My opinion is that -- for a variety of
136
1	that smoking, quote, unquote, the enemy's product was
2	something that was looked very badly upon and it was
3	even considered treason -- and I read to that effect,
4	actually, even before that -- beginning in the 1950s.
5	So there were no --
6	Q. Did you say 1950s?
7	A. Yeah, in 1959 begins the campaign -- I'm
8	sorry -- 1959, there's a campaign, very aggressive, of
9	"consume Cuban, don't buy US."
10	Now, they were not accessible at that point
11	to the Cuban public. And I'm talking about the
12	embargo. That's my general answer. They were not
13	accessible to the public.
14	Q. Do you have an opinion that they were
15	accessible to Cuban smokers, like Mr. Suarez, either
16	through the barter system or through the black market
17	in Cuba?
18	A. What I can say is that, given all that I know
19	about the atmosphere, given what I know about the
20	Committees For the Defense of the Revolution, that
21	were watchdog organizations controlled by the state,
22	that it's extremely unlikely that somebody like
23	Mr. Suarez, who, as I understand from the depositions,
24	did not have a good relation with the state, would
137
1	Q. Why do you say that?
2	A. For one thing, they were not coming into the
3	island. It was banned. It was banned not just by the
4	US embargo, but also Cuban authorities.
5	Q. What happened to the inventory of American
6	brand cigarettes that were already existing on the
7	island before the implementation of the embargo?
8	A. I'm not sure what happened to it.
9	Q. Isn't it possible that there was an inventory
10	of American brand cigarettes prior to the embargo?
11	For decades, you would agree, American brand
12	cigarettes were freely sold and distributed in Cuba.
13	Correct?
14	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
15	foundation.
16	A. American cigarettes were sold in Cuba.
17	BY MR. PORTAL:
18	Q. Certainly, even though there was the
19	implementation of the embargo in 1962 and restrictions
20	and bans by the Cuban government, there was still
21	inventory of American products -- not just American
22	brand cigarettes -- other American products on the
23	island. Correct?
24	A. Well, let me go back to what I said earlier.
138
1	specifically occurred in 1962 or 1960. I would have
2	to look at that in detail. Now, the other question is
3	-- well, I don't know about an inventory to be honest
4	with you. I don't know how large they were, how long
5	they would last, if there were any. I can't speak to
6	an inventory.
7	Q. So as you sit here today, you just don't know
8	one way or the other in terms of any inventory of
9	American cigarettes in Cuba post the 1960 or 1962
10	embargo for that timeframe. Right?
11	A. I can't speak to that, no.
12	Q. Let's switch gears. Oh, wait. Before we do
13	that -- because I know you're a big polls guy. Do you
14	intend to offer any opinions regarding polls conducted
15	of any Cuban smokers in Cuba in the 1950s and 1960s
16	regarding public awareness about the effects of
17	smoking?
18	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
19	A. At this point, what I can tell you is that
20	I'm not aware of any of those. I may have seen them,
21	but at this point, honestly, I don't have --1 can't
22	tell you whether I have or not.
23	BY MR. PORTAL:
24	Q. And, certainly, you haven't formulated any
139
1	in Cuba in the 1950s and '60s regarding public
2	awareness of the effects of smoking?
3	A. I can't answer that because I'm not sure
4	whether I've seen them or not.
5	Q. I understand, Dr. Martinez-Fernandez, but
6	this is my one time to take your deposition before
7	trial, so I need to know the opinions that you
8	formulated and that you intend to offer.
9	So as you sit today, have you formulated any
10	opinions based on polls of Cuban smokers in Cuba in
11	the 1950s and '60s regarding public awareness of the
12	effects of smoking?
13	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
14	A. Let me be as clear as I can. I don't know
15	whether I've seen them or not. If, for any reason, I
16	saw them, they're part of the universe of materials
17	and information that would allow me to reach some
18	conclusion. But, honestly, I don't know whether I've
19	seen them or not.
20	BY MR. PORTAL:
21	Q. As you sit here today, there's not an opinion
22	that you specifically formulated based on a particular
23	poll that you intend to discuss?
24	MR. COTTON: You're talking about Cuba
1	MR. PORTAL: Right.
2	A. Again, the answer is the same. If I've
3	looked at it, that becomes part of the universe of
4	information that allows me to reach conclusions. But
5	I can't make a connection because I don't know for a
6	fact that I've seen polls of that nature in Cuba.
7	BY MR. PORTAL:
8	Q. I understand and appreciate that. What I
9	don't want is to arrive at trial and be surprised by
10	testimony from you directly on the stand saying,
11	"There's a Cuban poll that I've reviewed and I'm
12	relying on and this is what it says regarding Cuban
13	smokers and public awareness and health effects in the
14	1950s and '60s."
15	If you haven't formulated that opinion as of
16	today, I can move on. If you have, I need to explore
17	it. This is my opportunity to do so.
18	A. As of today, specifically about information
19	from Cuban polls, I can't tell you one way or another.
20	About the future, I don't know.
21	BY MR. PORTAL:
22	Q. Perfect. Understood. Now we can switch
23	gears to the United States.
24	MR. COTTON: We've been going about an
1	MR. PORTAL: Let's take a quick five.
2	That's fine.
3	(Brief recess.)
4	BY MR. PORTAL:
5	Q. Dr. Martinez-Fernandez, I want to talk to you
6	a little bit about the warnings on cigarette packs and
7	cigarette ads in the United States. Okay?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. To your understanding, when did the first
10	Surgeon General warnings appear on cigarette packs in
11	the United States ?
12	A. They officially came out in January of 1966.
13	Q. And what happened in 1970 regarding the
14	warning on cigarette packs in the United States?
15	A. The warning was changed and it was
16	strengthened.
17	Q. Do you agree that the warning in 1970 said,
18	"The Surgeon General has determined that cigarette
19	smoking is dangerous to your health"?
20	A. I recall that to be the text.
21	Q. When were warnings placed on cigarette
22	advertisements in print media in the United States?
23	A. I believe that was in 1971 or '73.
24	Q. I represent to you that it appears, from the
142
1	documents that the warnings appeared on the print ads
2	in 1972.
3	Does that refresh your recollection at all?
4	A. It does. It's between '71 and '73.
5	Q. Okay. The warnings that came out on the
6	cigarette packs in 1966 and then it was changed in
7	1970 up until 1972 -- so during that timeframe -- are
8	you with me?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. All of those warnings on the cigarette packs
11	were in the English language, correct?
12	A. The warnings were in English.
13	Q. When was it that the warnings on cigarette
14	packs were first made in the Spanish language in the
15	United States?
16	A. I don't have that information.
17	Q. When was it, to your knowledge, that the
18	warnings on the print cigarette advertisements were
19	made in the Spanish language version?
20	A. I'm not aware of that fact.
21	Q. You are aware that Mr. Suarez came to the
22	United States in 1967, correct?
23	A. '67, yes.
24	Q. When he came to the United States, he
25	initially lived in New Jersey, where he resided until
143
1	sometime approximately in 1973?
2	A. Correct.
3	Q. Then, in 1973, Mr. Suarez relocated to Miami,
4	Florida, where he remained living with his family up
5	until the time of his untimely death in January 1996.
6	Correct?
7	A. Correct.
8	Q. So from the time that Mr. Suarez first
9	arrived in the United States in 1967, and let's just
10	say up until 1972 or '73, when he was in New Jersey,
11	to your knowledge -- first of all, he was smoking
12	Winston brand cigarettes during that timeframe.
13	Right?
14	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
15	foundation.
16	A. Winston? I recall that was the case.
17	BY MR. PORTAL:
18	Q. So assuming that he was smoking Winston brand
19	cigarettes during that timeframe, each of those
20	cigarettes packs that he would have purchased and
21	consumed, none of the warnings would've been in the
22	Spanish language?
23	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
24	A. The warnings may have not been in Spanish,
144
1	about those warnings. And, if I recall correctly,
2	there was information in the depositions that his wife
3	and he saw information on those warnings on TV and
4	they discussed them. That's my recollection.
5	As far as the language of the signs -- I'm
6	sorry -- the warnings -- at that time, they were in
7	English.
8	BY MR. PORTAL:
9	Q. Thank you for that answer. But specifically
10	as to my question, during that timeframe, the
11	cigarette packs that Mr. Suarez would have purchased
12	and consumed in the United States in that earlier
13	portion of 1967 to '72 would not have been in the
14	Spanish language. Correct?
15	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
16	A. Not in the Spanish language.
17	BY MR. PORTAL:
18	Q. Now, you've had an opportunity to look at
19	various Spanish language newspapers and magazines in
20	the United States from the late 1960s through the
21	1970s, 1980s and through the 1990s. Correct?
22	A. I believe in some cases it goes back to the
23	'50s. Yes.
24	Q. My questions to you are -- since we know
145
1	1967,1 want to kind of just limit it to the timeframe
2	that he would've been living in the United States --
3	1967 to 1996. Okay?
4	A. Okay.
5	Q. So during that timeframe, are you aware that
6	there were cigarette advertisements in Spanish
7	language in both magazines and newspapers in
8	New Jersey and in Miami, Florida, where Mr. Suarez had
9	lived -- correct -- for American brand cigarettes?
10	A. Where Mr. Suarez had lived?
11	Q. He's no longer with us today. He's deceased.
12	A. My question is about the timeframe. Because
13	originally you asked about New Jersey, but now the
14	question includes all the way up until '96.
15	Q. Fair enough. Let me break it down for you.
16	Were you aware of cigarette advertisements in Spanish
17	language newspapers in the New Jersey market where
18	Mr. Suarez resided between '67 and '73?
19	A. Spanish language advertising, I don't recall
20	having seen that in actual newspapers, so the answer
21	is no.
22	Q. Were you aware of any advertising in Cuban
23	magazines -- strike that. Were you aware of any
24	advertising in Spanish language magazines in the
146
1	A. '67 to'73?
2	Q. Yes.
3	A. I'm not sure for that specific period that
4	you're talking about.
5	Q. Okay. Fair enough.
6	(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 25 was marked for
7	identification.)
8	BY MR. PORTAL:
9	Q. I will represent to you these are cigarette
10	advertisements for RJ. Reynolds' Winston cigarettes
11	in the Spanish language that were produced by Christy
12	Garner, R.J. Reynolds' corporate representative,
13	during the course of her deposition taken in this
14	case. These are examples of ads from 1967 through
15	'75.
16	A. I'm sorry. I have a question about the
17	markings at the very top -- what they mean. APP, I
18	think--
19	Q. Approved January 30, 1967, if I'm reading --
20	I don't know if it's 30 or 31. I believe it's 30.
21	Then received, looks like, 3/7/67. For purposes of
22	the record, I'll just represent to you that these were
23	produced by Ms. Garner and authenticated as R.J.
24	Reynolds approved cigarette ads that were in the
1	A. So they were printed?
2	Q. Correct.
3	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
4	foundation.
5	A. I don't know whether this is an actual ad or
6	a proof because there's some information at the
7	bottom.
8	BY MR. PORTAL:
9	Q. Again, I'll ask you -- for the purposes of my
10	questions, I'll represent to you that these were ads
11	produced to us at the deposition of a corporate
12	representative for RJ. Reynolds as actual approved
13	advertisements that were actually distributed, went
14	into print in the United States during that
15	timeframe -- during the referenced timeframe.
16	A. But my question is: Is the full document
17	what was printed? Because there's some information at
18	the bottom that I don't think would've been printed.
19	Q. The information that's provided on the bottom
20	is an indication of who the advertisement was prepared
21	by, which, in this case, is William Esty Company. Do
22	you recall I asked you questions about that before
23	about the advertising company? Do you see that?
24	A. Yes.
148
1	indicates the media in which it was printed. In this
2	case, the first one you're looking at is El Diario la
3	Prensa, 1967.
4	A. Again, my point is -- and I understand what
5	you're saying -- my point is that I can't view this
6	whole thing as an ad, because my understanding would
7	be that the bottom -- certainly what's at the very
8	bottom -- would not appear in an ad.
9	Q. Certainly.
10	A. So it's a proof.
11	Q. It's a proof of what was ultimately sent to
12	print in the media.
13	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
14	foundation. It is what it is. Whatever the
15	evidence shows, it shows. Maybe it would
16	help if you gave him an idea of what you're
17	going to ask him and we can move on.
18	MR. PORTAL: Sure.
19	BY MR. PORTAL:
20	Q. The point being, Dr. Martinez-Fernandez, is
21	that you're aware, are you not, that during that
22	timeframe in the late '60s and 1970s, R.J. Reynolds
23	was advertising to Spanish-speaking Hispanic smokers
24	in the United States?
149
1	A. I have not seen ads like this or similar ads
2	for that period in the Spanish language press. Of
3	course, I've seen for later periods in El Herald, for
4	example. So these proofs are the first evidence to
5	that effect that I have seen.
6	BY MR. PORTAL:
7	Q. For example, you can turn to page four of
8	Composite Exhibit 25.
9	A. Page four.
10	Q. There you go. And you see, handwritten on
11	the bottom, it says, "Miami, Florida, Diario Las
12	Americas, it's got a number and then it says March 8,
13	1971 and April 5, 1971. Do you see that?
14	A. I'm sorry. I don't see that. It says
15	Spanish language newspapers --
16	Q. Right here.
17	A. Oh, by hand -- Los Angeles City, El Diario La
18	Prensa --1 see those notes in writing -- which are
19	not part of the ad -- for the proof.
20	Q. So certainly you're aware and recognize
21	Diario Las Americas was a Spanish language newspaper
22	published in Miami, Florida. Correct? And still is.
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. And you've had the opportunity to look at and
150
1	it changed names to El Nuevo Herald in Miami, Florida.
2	Correct?
3	A. Yes.
4	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
5	BY MR. PORTAL:
6	Q. As was Diario Las Americas, the Spanish
7	language newspaper in Miami, Florida, for this period
8	of time in the 70s and '80s, as well as the 1990s.
9	Correct?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. And certainly you're aware, during this early
12	time in the early '70s, that there were in fact
13	Winston cigarette advertisements in these Spanish
14	language newspapers. Correct?
15	A. I don't recall having seen them. What you're
16	showing me is what I have as far as those ads. What I
17	can tell you is that, of course, if these ads
18	appeared, they appeared in a context of a newspaper
19	that carried a lot of stories and many stories
20	pertaining to the health consequences of smoking and
21	some other ads for smoking cessation. So I would like
22	to place these proofs in the context of that.
23	(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 26 was marked for
24	identification.)
1	Q. Let me then attach the next numbered exhibit,
2	which will be Exhibit 26, to your deposition. Now, as
3	reflected on Exhibit 26 to your deposition, I'll
4	represent to you that this is another cigarette ad for
5	Winston and Winston Light cigarettes, and, as
6	reflected on page two, prepared by the William Esty
7	Company for R.J. Reynolds, and that this appeared in
8	both the El Miami Herald on March 1, 1982, and Diario
9	Las Americas on March 1, 1982.
10	Do you see that?
11	MR. COTTON: Object to form. The
12	document speaks for itself.
13	A. I see that.
14	BY MR. PORTAL:
15	Q. And this is a Spanish language advertisement
16	for Winston, right?
17	A. The advertising is in Spanish and so is the
18	warning from the Surgeon General.
19	Q. Now, is this the type of ad that you would
20	have seen in your review of El Miami Herald and Diario
21	Las Americas during this timeframe in the early 1980s?
22	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
23	foundation.
24	A. I have seen similar ads in El Miami Herald.
1	Q. Have you also seen ads for Philip Morris's
2	Marlboro brand cigarettes in Spanish language both in
3	El Miami Herald or El Nuevo Herald, Diario Las
4	Americas and other Spanish print media in the Miami
5	market?
6	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
7	A. I believe I have.
8	(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 27 was marked for
9	identification.)
10	BY MR. PORTAL:
11	Q. Now, what's been attached as composite
12	Exhibit 27 to your deposition, is this examples of the
13	type of Philip Morris cigarette advertisement for its
14	Marlboro brand products for the Hispanic market in the
15	United States?
16	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
17	A. The first thing that I would like to say is
18	that, what appears at the very top, it is illegible
19	and I would have liked to be able to tell what it
20	says. The second thing is that it's hard to judge,
21	because this is an illustration of the ad itself, and
22	it's hard to tell the size and the placement and if it
23	actually appeared in any newspaper at all. There's no
24	information about that, so I wanted to put that first.
1	Q. I'll represent to you that these are ads that
2	were produced at the time of Jeanne Bonhomme's
3	deposition, who's the corporate representative for
4	advertising for Philip Morris USA regarding Spanish
5	marketing in the United States, and specifically
6	advertising in the Miami market from the 1980s to
7	1996.
8	With that predicate in mind, my question
9	simply is: Is this the type of example of ads that
10	you would have seen in the Spanish newspapers or
11	magazines, particularly in magazines, in the Spanish
12	market in Miami?
13	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
14	A. I don't recall magazines. I have seen
15	something similar to this in the Herald publications.
16	BY MR. PORTAL:
17	Q. Miami Herald?
18	A. Miami Herald--El Miami Herald. That's my
19	recollection that I've seen some things similar to
20	this. Again, it's hard to tell because this is not
21	the newspaper itself.
22	But what I would like to underscore is the
23	fact that, when I saw something along these lines, I
24	saw that in a context of a newspaper that carried
154
1	smoking and also events by La Liga Contra el Cancer
2	and also cessation clinics and also ads for a variety
3	of products. So I want to place that in the context
4	of the entire publication.
5	Q. You've indicated -- now you've said it a
6	couple of times, so let's just explore that -- that in
7	the context of the newspaper and the print media that
8	you saw, you saw, one, numerous articles to the health
9	hazards about smoking, articles from La Liga Contra el
10	Cancer and articles about smoking cessation. Correct?
11	A. Smoking cessation, both articles and ads --
12	could you repeat the list again?
13	Q. Sure. From what I wrote down that you just
14	told us -- and you said this numerous times throughout
15	your deposition -- in order to put these ads in
16	context, as you said, there was also numerous articles
17	regarding the health hazards about smoking, articles
18	or some reference to La Liga Contra el Cancer and
19	smoking cessation articles and ads.
20	Did I get that right?
21	A. I included the word clinics, I believe.
22	Q. Clinics, okay. Smoking cessation clinics.
23	All right. And you're saying these are articles and
24	ads that were in Spanish newspapers in Miami,
155
1	are we talking about?
2	A. I'm talking '70s -- I'm talking about the
3	articles.
4	Q. Sure.
5	A. They go as far as back as the '50s regarding
6	the other Spanish language newspaper.
7	Q. Understood, but Mr. Suarez wasn't here in the
8	'50s. So let's just stick --
9	A. From '73 on. Yeah, that's correct. Those
10	kinds of articles and ads.
11	Q. So in the 1980s?
12	A. 1980s.
13	Q. And 1990s, up to the time of Mr. Suarez's
14	death in '96?
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. To put it in context, Dr. Martinez-Fernandez,
17	in all the articles, all the newspapers, all the
18	magazines that you reviewed from the 1970s, 1980s,
19	1990s, leading up to 1996, can you point me to one ad,
20	article published by -- first let's start with R.J.
21	Reynolds Tobacco Company regarding the health hazards
22	of smoking its products?
23	A. An article -- did you say article or ad?
24	Q. Either.
156
1	and health?
2	Q. On the health effects of smoking in Spanish
3	language in any of these magazines or newspapers that
4	you just referenced?
5	MR. COTTON: Form.
6	A. I do not recall seeing that at all.
7	BY MR. PORTAL:
8	Q. Do you recall ever seeing any ad, public
9	statement, article, published or issued by R.J.
10	Reynolds Tobacco Company during this timeframe, in any
11	Spanish language media in the Miami metropolitan area
12	stating that cigarette smoking is a leading cause of
13	preventible death in the United States?
14	A. A statement from?
15	Q. From R.J. Reynolds.
16	A. No.
17	Q. Do you recall seeing in any Spanish print
18	media published in the Miami metropolitan area from
19	R.J. Reynolds that cigarette smoking significantly
20	increases the risk of developing lung cancer?
21	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
22	A. I have seen ads for cigarettes that include
23	those kinds of warnings, so that makes me rethink my
24	answer to the previous questions, because the warnings
157
1	other companies.
2	BY MR. PORTAL:
3	Q. You understand that Reynolds Tobacco Company,
4	as well as Philip Morris, from the 1960s, 70s, '80s,
5	including up to the time that they testified before
6	Congress in the 1990s, denied that smoking cigarettes
7	caused lung cancer and that nicotine in tobacco
8	products is addictive. Right?
9	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
10	foundation.
11	A. I would have to see a document to that
12	effect. I do recall statements calling for further
13	research. I do recall statements that are criticisms
14	of the research and they're calling for more research,
15	which, by the way, is the same thing that the actual
16	researchers were also calling for, but I don't recall
17	that wording.
18	BY MR. PORTAL:
19	Q. In fact, you can't point to any single
20	document in any Spanish language print media that was
21	issued by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company or Philip
22	Morris Tobacco Company admitting that nicotine in
23	tobacco products is addictive prior to Mr. Suarez's
24	death in 1996. Correct?
158
I	Q. In fact, you cannot --
2	A. Well, I should take that back, because, as I
3	said earlier, in the ads, there are warning labels
4	that speak to that.
5	Q. And I'm not talking about the U.S. Surgeon
6	General's warning labels that the tobacco companies
7	were forced to put on their advertisements and
8	cigarette packs. I'm talking about public statements
9	and admissions by these two tobacco companies, Philip
10	Morris and R.J. Reynolds, prior to Mr. Suarez's death
II	in 1996, publically admitting that nicotine in tobacco
12	products is addictive. You can't point to any such
13	document, can you?
14	MR. COTTON: Object to form, asked and
15	answered.
16	A. I don't recall having seen anything like
17	that.
18	BY MR. PORTAL:
19	Q. Can you point us to any document in any
20	Spanish language, print media, newspaper, including El
21	Nuevo Herald, or Diario Las Americas or any other,
22	where Philip Morris agreed with the overwhelming
23	medical and scientific consensus that cigarette
24	smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema
159
1	Mr. Suarez's death in 1996?
2	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
3	A. I don't recall anything beyond the warning
4	labels.
5	BY MR. PORTAL:
6	Q. Was there any public statement in any Spanish
7	language media issued by Philip Morris admitting that
8	there's no safe cigarette prior to Mr. Suarez's death
9	in 1996?
10	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
11	A. I don't recall having seen that.
12	BY MR. PORTAL:
13	Q. Do you recall seeing any public statement
14	issued by Philip Morris Tobacco Company, prior to
15	Mr. Suarez's death in 1996, in any Spanish language
16	media where they publically agreed with the
17	overwhelming medical and scientific consensus that
18	cigarette smoking is addictive?
19	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
20	A. I don't recall having seen that.
21	BY MR. PORTAL:
22	Q. Are you aware of any Hispanic marketing
23	programs, first of all, that were initiated by R.J.
24	Reynolds to target Hispanic smokers, in particular
160
1	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
2	A. I'm not aware of any specific program, no.
3	BY MR. PORTAL:
4	Q. Were you aware of any specific advertising
5	campaigns or programs by Philip Morris to target
6	Hispanic smokers, particularly Cuban smokers in the
7	Miami market?
8	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
9	A. I'm not aware of any specific programs.
10	BY MR. PORTAL:
11	Q. Were you aware of Philip Morris's sponsorship
12	of Hispanic outdoor festivals and events, like the
13	Calle Ocho in Miami, Florida, during the 1980s and
14	early'90s?
15	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
16	A. I don't recall having seen that.
17	BY MR. PORTAL:
18	Q. Do you have any opinions regarding the public
19	awareness of Philip Morris's Marlboro brand
20	advertising in the Hispanic community in Miami during
21	the 1980s and 1990s?
22	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
23	A. People's awareness?
24	BY MR. PORTAL:
1	A. Public awareness? I'm not aware of that at
2	all.
3	Q. Do you have any opinions regarding the public
4	awareness of R.J. Reynolds' Winston brand cigarettes
5	in the Hispanic community both in Elizabeth, New
6	Jersey and Miami, Florida between 1967 to '73 and
7	subsequently, '73 to '96?
8	A. I'm not aware of that.
9	MR. PORTAL: Let's mark these as Exhibits
10	28, 29 and 30.
11	(Plaintiffs' Exhibits 28, 29 and 30 were
12	marked for identification.)
13	THE WITNESS: Should I read all three of
14	them?
15	MR. PORTAL: Might as well so we can get
16	through it.
17	MR. COTTON: Each of those documents are
18	relatively long. Maybe it makes sense to go
19	one at a time.
20	MR. PORTAL: Whatever you feel more
21	comfortable with.
22	THE WITNESS: My preference would be one
23	at a time.
24	BY MR. PORTAL:
162
1	seen this document before?
2	A. Never.
3	Q. So you've testified as an expert for the
4	tobacco industry for approximately the last 12-plus
5	years, correct?
6	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
7	A. Approximately.
8	BY MR. PORTAL:
9	Q. And what's been marked as Exhibit 28 is a
10	document by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company stating,
11	"Can we have an open debate about smoking?"
12	Do you see that's what it's entitled?
13	A. I can't see the date fully. Is it 1984?
14	Q. Yes, sir.
15	A. Okay.
16	Q. And I'll represent to you that this document
17	is a statement issued by R.J. Reynolds in response to
18	the U.S. Surgeon General's Report of 1984.
19	You're aware that there was a Surgeon
20	General's Report that came out in that year, correct?
21	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
22	A. I remember that.
23	BY MR. PORTAL:
24	Q. For the record, Exhibit 28 is Bates-numbered
1	A. Correct.
2	Q. Earlier in your testimony, you talked about
3	that you were aware of certain statements by the
4	tobacco industry -- in particular, the defendants in
5	this case -- about there being a debate about smoking
6	and medicine and addiction and the health consequences
7	of smoking. Do you recall that?
8	MR. COTTON: Object to form,
9	mischaracterizes prior testimony.
10	A. I don't recall having used the word "debate,"
11	so I'd like to be clear and hear from the record, if
12	possible, what I said.
13	BY MR. PORTAL:
14	Q. Well, the record will speak for itself. Are
15	you aware that the tobacco industry, particular R.J.
16	Reynolds and Philip Morris, in the '70s, and even in
17	the 1980s, continued to present an open question as to
18	the health effects of smoking, in particular as it
19	pertains to their health product. Correct?
20	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
21	foundation.
22	A. According to this document -- and I don't
23	know if this was ever published or who it reached --
24	so I'm not aware of the nature of this document. But
164
1	of the things that is stated is that the issue of
2	tobacco and health is not a closed issue.
3	BY MR. PORTAL:
4	Q. You understand, based on your review as an
5	expert testifying in this litigation over the past
6	12 years and earning close to over $600,000, as you
7	told us earlier, that the tobacco companies and the
8	tobacco industry during this timeframe had continued
9	to dispute the Surgeon General's Report findings and
10	continued to debate whether or not smoking of its
11	products caused health consequences and whether or not
12	nicotine was addictive. Right?
13	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
14	foundation.
15	A. I never used the word "disputed" or anything
16	along those lines.
17	BY MR. PORTAL:
18	Q. Pick the word you like. I don't want to put
19	words in your mouth. Whatever you feel comfortable
20	with. You were aware that that's what was going on,
21	right?
22	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
23	A. I am aware that there were comments
24	attributed to tobacco companies about research and
1	BY MR. PORTAL:
2	Q. And comments -- they weren't just closed-door
3	comments -- there were open public statements made by
4	tobacco companies to its consumers -- to the American
5	public -- regarding an open question as to whether or
6	not smoking cigarettes containing nicotine, A, caused
7	deleterious health effects, and, B, was addictive.
8	Right?
9	MR. COTTON: Object to form and
10	foundation.
11	A. What I was referring to were stories in
12	newspapers, for example, that included quotations of
13	the industry's perspective.
14	BY MR. PORTAL:
15	Q. So from a historian's perspective, in the
16	1970s and 1980s, what was the tobacco industry's
17	position on the health effects of smoking and whether
18	or not smoking cigarettes containing nicotine was
19	addictive?
20	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
21	foundation.
22	A. Based on this document, they had been sort of
23	silent and there are a couple of places where it says
24	that they should have been more vocal. That's
1	BY MR. PORTAL:
2	Q. Vocal in what regard?
3	A. Could I read it again?
4	Q. Sure.
5	MR. COTTON: It's unclear to me what the
6	pending question is.
7	BY MR. PORTAL:
8	Q. I asked you as a predicate question,
9	Dr. Martinez-Fernandez -- you reviewed literally
10	hundreds, if not thousands, of pages of documents,
11	magazines, newspapers, regarding the health effects of
12	smoking in the United States, both in the '60s, '70s,
13	'80s and '90s. Correct?
14	A. Definitely thousands.
15	Q. Right. Of all those thousands of pages that
16	you reviewed during the '60s, '70s, '80s and 1990s,
17	leading up to 1996, the date of Mr. Suarez's death,
18	did you ever see any document issued by the tobacco
19	companies in the public statements, like the one
20	before you, where it -- meaning the tobacco company --
21	admitted that smoking cigarettes containing nicotine
22	resulted in deleterious health effects, like lung
23	cancer, heart disease and emphysema?
24	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
1	Q. I'm not talking about the Surgeon General's
2	Reports that they were required to put on their ads.
3	I'm talking about public statements like the one in
4	front of you.
5	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
6	A. Can you repeat the question one more time?
7	BY MR. PORTAL:
8	Q. Sure. Clearly, you're a historian and the
9	scope of the areas that you testify about is public
10	awareness of tobacco-related disease and smoking.
11	Right?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. All right. So you talk about all the stuff
14	that was in the print media and the public domain
15	about how smoking was bad, right? That's what you
16	looked at. And what people knew about how smoking was
17	not a good thing for you; that it had deleterious
18	health effects. Right?
19	A. I looked at everything.
20	Q. So looking at everything, did you see any
21	statements from any of the tobacco companies -- in
22	particular, R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris -- prior
23	to 1996 conceding and admitting to the deleterious
24	health effects of its cigarette products ?
168
1	answered.
2	A. I don't recall seeing that.
3	BY MR. PORTAL:
4	Q. Now, further to that, did you see any
5	affirmative statements by the tobacco companies -- in
6	particular, R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris --
7	creating questions or doubts as to whether or not
8	there was a consensus that smoking its cigarette
9	products caused deleterious health effects and that
10	nicotine in cigarettes was addictive prior to 1996?
11	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
12	A. I recall questions about the methods. I
13	don't recall anything about a consensus, as you
14	phrased the question.
15	BY MR. PORTAL:
16	Q. Now, this document, Exhibit 28, it's your
17	testimony that prior to today, October 11, 2013, you
18	have never seen this document. Correct?
19	A. I don't recall having ever seen this
20	document.
21	Q. So is it fair to say then that you would have
22	seen never seen a Spanish language version of this
23	document prior to today?
24	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
169
1	English or in Spanish.
2	BY MR. PORTAL:
3	Q. So now let's turn to Exhibits 29 and 30 and
4	ask you to take a look at them and let me know if you
5	had ever seen them prior to today.
6	A. Okay, I read it.
7	BY MR. PORTAL:
8	Q. Great. So Exhibit 29, this is a May 16, 1988
9	press release from the Tobacco Institute. First of
10	all, are you familiar with this document? Have you
11	seen this ?
12	A. I've never seen this document.
13	Q. Are you familiar with the Tobacco Institute?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. What is the Tobacco Institute to your
16	knowledge?
17	A. Tobacco Institute is a trade organization for
18	tobacco producers -- I'm sorry -- cigarette producers.
19	Q. To your knowledge, the cigarette
20	manufacturing companies in the United States -- in
21	particular, Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds -- for
22	lack of a better term, supported or sponsored the
23	Tobacco Institute. Correct?
24	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
170
1	BY MR. PORTAL:
2	Q. This release that's been marked as Exhibit 29
3	to your deposition, I'll represent to you is a
4	response from the tobacco industry to the Surgeon
5	General's Report of 1988.
6	First of all, are you aware that there was a
7	subsequent Surgeon General's Report in 1988 regarding
8	tobacco-related diseases and consequences of smoking?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. Again, based on this document, it's a
11	statement issued by the tobacco industry -- in
12	particular, the defendants in this case -- indicating
13	that claims by the United States Government,
14	particularly the Surgeon General -- that cigarettes
15	are addictive is irresponsible and scare tactics.
16	Were you aware of that response by the
17	tobacco industry to the 1988 Surgeon General's Report?
18	A. I have some questions about the document that
19	I'd like to address.
20	Q. Go ahead.
21	A. One of them is, I don't see who the author
22	is. It says here "for release." You characterize it
23	as a press release. I don't see anything to that
24	effect. Then there's sort of a contradictory
171
1	document, I don't know who produced it, for what
2	purpose and for what audience.
3	Q. Well, Dr. Martinez-Fernandez, you're the
4	expert on the public awareness of tobacco-related
5	health effects in the United States, in particular,
6	certainly, by 1988. You've researched it, you've
7	testified to it. You're an expert in that area,
8	correct?
9	A. Yeah. First you said I'm the expert.
10	Q. An expert.
11	A. An expert, yes, that would be accurate.
12	Q. That's what you hold yourself out to be -- an
13	expert on what was the public awareness -- what
14	statements and documents were in the public domain
15	regarding the health consequences of smoking
16	cigarettes in the United States. Correct?
17	A. That's accurate.
18	Q. So you're aware of the U.S. Surgeon General's
19	Report from 1988 claiming that nicotine in cigarettes
20	is addictive, right?
21	A. Yeah. I believe it was Dr. Koop.
22	Q. By the same token, are you aware of public
23	statements made by the tobacco industry, including
24	defendants R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris, in and
111
1	General's claims where they denied that cigarettes
2	containing nicotine were addictive?
3	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
4	foundation.
5	A. I don't recall having read anything to that
6	effect.
7	BY MR. PORTAL:
8	Q. So you only recall articles and statements
9	made by everyone else but the tobacco industry
10	regarding the health effects of smoking?
11	MR. COTTON: Object to form,
12	mischaracterizes prior testimony.
13	BY MR. PORTAL:
14	Q. Is that what your testimony is?
15	A. No, that's not what I'm saying. What I'm
16	saying is -- and I think the record will reflect
17	that -- that there were statements by the tobacco
18	company that appeared as part of news stories and that
19	was clearly there where I saw it. It was by far a
20	minority of the stories that carried those messages
21	from the tobacco companies.
22	Now, anything along those lines, I don't
23	recall having ever seen -- or a specific statement by
24	the tobacco companies that appeared in any of the
173
1	like this.
2	Q. Well, let's take a look at Exhibit 30. This
3	is a statement from Philip Morris USA that's before
4	you. It's Bates-numbered 500846023.
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. Do you see that? Take a look at it and I'm
7	going to ask you some follow-up questions.
8	A. I read it.
9	Q. Dr. Martinez-Fernandez, prior to today, have
10	you ever seen a copy of this document and what's
11	contained in it published by Philip Morris in any of
12	the public media that you reviewed as an expert in
13	litigation?
14	A. I have not.
15	Q. Are you aware the the CEOs of the major
16	tobacco companies testified before Congress in what
17	was called the Waxman hearings?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. You're aware that, during that testimony
20	before Congress, each of the CEOs of the major tobacco
21	companies -- in particular, the CEOs of R.J. Reynolds
22	and Philip Morris, the defendants in this case --
23	testified that they did not believe that cigarette
24	smoking is addictive?
174
1	do remember that they stood up before Congress, I
2	believe, and presented their perspective, but I don't
3	recall that particular wording.
4	Q. Do you recall the CEOs of each of the
5	defendant companies -- in particular, the defendants
6	R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris -- testifying at the
7	Waxman hearings where they denied any harmful effects
8	as a result of smoking any of their cigarette
9	products ?
10	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
11	A. I don't remember that they used that kind of
12	language. I do know that these hearings happened and
13	they were there in defense of their products. The
14	language, I don't remember.
15	BY MR. PORTAL:
16	Q. All right. Well, let me ask it this way.
17	Based on what you know of what the CEOs of R.J.
18	Reynolds and Philip Morris testified to before the
19	United States Congress during the Waxman hearings, did
20	they ever admit or concede, under oath at that time,
21	that smoking their cigarettes was harmful to smokers'
22	health or that smoking cigarettes is addictive?
23	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
24	foundation.
1	BY MR. PORTAL:
2	Q. Now, this document that's before you,
3	Exhibit 30, do you see at the bottom that this is a
4	statement by Philip Morris -- and it references other
5	US tobacco manufacturers as well -- speaking before a
6	congressional committee. Do you see that at the top
7	of the page?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. And what it says here is that, "Philip Morris
10	and other US tobacco manufacturers helped to set the
11	record straight." That's their statement, right?
12	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
13	A. Is that at the top?
14	BY MR. PORTAL:
15	Q. Second sentence, third line down.
16	A. It says, "set the record straight." About
17	what, it doesn't specify.
18	Q. It's got a colon and then it lists
19	underneath, "facts." Right?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. And the last two facts, big and bold, it
22	says, "Philip Morris does not believe cigarette
23	smoking is addictive." Do you see that?
24	MR. COTTON: Object to form. The
1	A. That's what it says.
2	BY MR. PORTAL:
3	Q. And you understood, based on your review of
4	the documents in the public domain in testifying as an
5	expert in the tobacco litigation, that, prior to 1996,
6	it was Philip Morris's public position that cigarette
7	smoking is not addictive. Correct?
8	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
9	foundation.
10	A. I can only speak based on this statement,
11	taking it within the context of everything else that
12	it says, and not knowing when and where and if this
13	was published at all, so I can't call it a public
14	statement.
15	BY MR. PORTAL:
16	Q. Dr. Martinez-Fernandez, based on all the
17	thousands of pages that you've reviewed in the United
18	States regarding public awareness and statements in
19	the public domain, do you agree that it was Philip
20	Morris's public position that it did not believe
21	cigarette smoking is addictive prior to 1996?
22	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
23	foundation.
24	A. I don't recall having seen that in the
1	BY MR. PORTAL:
2	Q. To your knowledge, at any time, did Philip
3	Morris issue any public statements in the public
4	domain stating that it believed that cigarette smoking
5	is addictive prior to 1996?
6	A. The same answer. I don't recall having seen
7	that.
8	Q. Same for R.J. Reynolds. Based on all of the
9	thousands of documents that you reviewed, did you ever
10	see any public statement by R.J. Reynolds prior to
11	1996 saying that it believes cigarette smoking is
12	addictive?
13	A. I have not seen that.
14	Q. So now let me show you then what we're going
15	to mark as the last exhibit to your deposition,
16	hopefully. Actually, it will be Exhibits 31 and 32.
17	A. May I add something to this discussion?
18	Q. You certainly may.
19	A. Okay. That is, as a historian -- and you
20	know this better than I do -- as a lawyer, you have to
21	look at the document in its entirety.
22	And, here, the issue that is being raised is
23	the comparison of cigarette smoking as an addiction
24	compared to drugs. So I think that's an important
178
1	Q. What do you mean by that?
2	A. Well, the statement that you asked me to read
3	or you read -- Philip Morris does not believe
4	cigarette smoking is addictive -- needs to be
5	understood within the broader document.
6	Q. I got that part, but you mentioned within
7	some reference toward a drug. What do you mean by
8	that? What were you talking about?
9	A. I am sorry. I confused what I just said with
10	the previous document.
11	Q. Okay. What document are you talking about?
12	I'm not sure what you were referencing.
13	A. I believe that would be Exhibit 28.
14	Q. What was it about Exhibit 28 that you saw in
15	reference to drugs?
16	A. I need to see that again.
17	Q. Isn't it right there in front of you?
18	MR. COTTON: 28? Here's 28.
19	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. I meant 29. So
20	my point is -- in order to understand this
21	document, Exhibit 29, it's important to keep
22	in mind that, whatever is said here is in the
23	context of mentioning other drugs.
24	BY MR. PORTAL:
179
1	from the defendant cigarette companies, including RJ.
2	Reynolds, dating back to the early 70s where it had
3	recognized that nicotine is a potent drug with a
4	variety of physiological effects?
5	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
6	BY MR. PORTAL:
7	Q. Are you aware of that?
8	A. I am not aware of that. I have not seen that
9	document. I did not look at internal documents
10	because the focus of my research was public awareness
11	based on what reached the public, not internal
12	documents.
13	Q. And part of looking at the public awareness
14	of what reached the public would include public
15	statements made by the tobacco companies denying that
16	their products in fact cause any deleterious health
17	effects or addiction. Right?
18	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
19	foundation.
20	A. Can you point to me one of those?
21	BY MR. PORTAL:
22	Q. One of what?
23	A. One of those statements by the companies
24	directly to the public.
180
1	Exhibit 29, Exhibit 28. And you also have -- we can
2	go back to the 1950s -- part of your reliance is the
3	Frank Statement. You're familiar with that, right?
4	A. I remember The Frank Statement. Yes,
5	which --1 remember The Frank Statement. But I have
6	no foundation to say that these were ever public
7	documents. I don't know whether they appeared in the
8	media or not. So I can't comment on these three
9	documents -- Exhibits 28, 29 and 30 -- as public
10	statements to the public.
11	(Plaintiffs' Exhibits 31 and 32 were
12	marked for identification.)
13	BY MR. PORTAL:
14	Q. Let's then look at Exhibits 31 and 32.
15	Exhibit 31, I'll represent is a printout from the
16	Philip Morris USA website, printed as of yesterday,
17	October 10, 2013, from their position on health issues
18	related to cigarette smoking in the United States.
19	And Exhibit 32 is from the R.J. Reynolds
20	Tobacco Company website, their guiding principles and
21	beliefs, including tobacco use and health, printed
22	October 10, 2013.
23	Dr. Martinez-Fernandez, first of all, have
24	you ever been to Philip Morris's and R.J. Reynolds'
181
1	positions are on smoking and health issues?
2	A. I have not.
3	Q. Are these documents that I produced to you
4	now, Exhibit 31 and Exhibit 32, the first time that
5	you've seen both Philip Morris's and R.J. Reynolds'
6	respectively public positions as it pertains to
7	smoking and health issues ?
8	A. As documents, yes.
9	Q. In comparing Exhibit 30, that we just looked
10	at -- if you could just pull that out, please?
11	Particularly look at the last two facts as identified
12	there at the bottom of the page. The position of
13	Philip Morris at that time was that it did not believe
14	cigarette smoking is addictive; whereas, its current
15	position now is that, as you see on Exhibit 31, it
16	agrees that the overwhelming medical and scientific
17	consensus that cigarette smoking is addictive.
18	Do you see that?
19	MR. COTTON: Object to form-
20	A. I see it.
21	MR. COTTON: -- the documents speak for
22	themselves.
23	A. I saw them.
24	BY MR. PORTAL:
182
1	positions, aren't they?
2	MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
3	foundation.
4	A. First of all, I would like to know the date
5	of this document.
6	BY MR. PORTAL:
7	Q. Well, you see it's in reference to --
8	A. 30.
9	Q. — response to the 1988 Surgeon General's
10	Report and also the time that it testified before
11	Congress.
12	MR. COTTON: Again, the documents speak
13	for themselves.
14	BY MR. PORTAL:
15	Q. So, certainly, before Mr. Suarez passed away
16	in 1996?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. When, to your knowledge -- being an expert on
19	tobacco or health-related disease in the public
20	domain -- when did the defendants, R.J. Reynolds and
21	Philip Morris, finally publically admit, like is
22	reflected here on Exhibit 31 and Exhibit 32 on their
23	websites, that nicotine in tobacco and cigarette
24	smoking is addictive?
183
1	A. I honestly don't know when that happened.
2	BY MR. PORTAL:
3	Q. You've been representing these defendants for
4	over 12 years in this litigation, talking about public
5	awareness in the public domain, about tobacco
6	health-related diseases, and you've never bothered to
7	find out when the companies that you're defending
8	publically admitted that their cigarettes and their
9	products caused deleterious health effects, including
10	lung cancer, and that their product was addictive --
11	you never bothered to find that out?
12	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
13	A. Let me tell you what happens. The vast
14	majority of the cases don't reach that late in terms
15	of chronology. I am aware that at one point --1
16	can't tell you what year -- that there was a change in
17	terms of the acceptance, if you will, of the issues
18	that have been raised about health and the addictive
19	nature. I don't know when that happened. It was not
20	relevant time-wise for the cases that I was looking at
21	and it is not a reflection of a lack of interest and
22	work that is not comprehensive. My work is
23	comprehensive.
24	This change, which I don't know when it
184
1	been working with so far.
2	BY MR. PORTAL:
3	Q. Much later after Mr. Suarez's death in 1996,
4	right?
5	A. I'm not aware of that.
6	MR. PORTAL: That's all the questions I
7	have for you. Thank you.
8	MR. COTTON: Let's take a break --
9	MR. PORTAL: Wait, wait. I do have a
10	follow-up. I lied.
11	BY MR. PORTAL:
12	Q. Polls. What, if any, polls have you reviewed
13	regarding the public awareness of the deleterious
14	effects of smoking amongst Hispanic males in the Miami
15	metropolitan area, say, from the 1970s through the
16	time Mr. Suarez died in 1996?
17	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
18	A. I don't recall having seen or read any polls
19	specifically to Hispanics in Miami.
20	BY MR. PORTAL:
21	Q. Have you seen or do you intend to testify
22	regarding any polls regarding public awareness of the
23	deleterious effects of smoking among Hispanic males in
24	the United States from the 1970s up until 1996?
185
1	A. Can you repeat the question?
2	BY MR. PORTAL:
3	Q. Sure. I just want to find out--are you
4	going to testify based on any polls regarding public
5	awareness of the deleterious health effects of smoking
6	among Hispanic males in the United States during the
7	relevant timeframe, 1970s to 1996?
8	MR. COTTON: Object to form.
9	A. At this point, I don't anticipate that.
10	MR. PORTAL: Now I have no further
11	questions.
12	MR. COTTON: Let me compare notes with my
13	colleague. Let's take a moment's break.
14	(Brief recess.)
15	CROSS EXAMINATION
16	BY MR. COTTON:
17	Q. Back on the record. Doctor, I just have a
18	couple of follow-up questions for you, if I may.
19	Do you have any expertise to offer opinions
20	about the nicotine levels that were in cigarettes at
21	any time?
22	A. Not at all.
23	Q. Do you have any opinions as to the nicotine
24	levels of any cigarettes at any time?
186
1	A. I have no opinions.
2	BY MR. COTTON:
3	Q. You were asked at one point whether there
4	were ever any cigarette ads in the United States that
5	addressed the health effects of smoking. Do you
6	recall that question or those series of questions?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. Do you have any understanding as to whether
9	there came a time that cigarette ads began to carry
10	health warnings?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. What's your understanding of that?
13	A. It happened in 1972.
14	Q. Do you have any understanding as to whether
15	tobacco products advertised in the United States since
16	1972 have carried the Surgeon General's warning?
17	A. It is the law and they have, yes.
18	Q. Doctor, over the course of the day, you've
19	been shown a number of documents. I'm going to ask
20	you a couple of questions about a handful of them.
21	The first one is Exhibit 13. This may have
22	been covered earlier with counsel. Have you seen,
23	prior to today, Exhibit 13?
24	A. I have never seen that until today.
187
1	A. I don't know the source.
2	Q. Okay. Earlier today, you were shown
3	Exhibit 17. Do you recall that?
4	A. Yes, I saw that today.
5	Q. Do you recall whether you've seen Exhibit 17
6	before today?
7	A. I am not sure whether I have seen that one in
8	particular or not.
9	Q. Earlier today, you were shown Exhibit 18.
10	I'll hand that back to you. Before today, had you
11	seen Exhibit 18?
12	A. I have never seen this, no.
13	Q. Do you know the source of Exhibit 18?
14	A. I don't know.
15	Q. Earlier today, you were shown Exhibit 22. Do
16	you recall that?
17	A. Yes, this was shown to me today and this is
18	the first time I've seen anything like this.
19	Q. So you don't know how Exhibit 22 was
20	generated, correct?
21	A. I have no idea.
22	Q. Let me hand to you Exhibit 23. Prior to
23	today, had you seen Exhibit 23?
24	A. Never.
188
1	A. I don't know.
2	Q. And I hand to you Exhibit 24. Prior to
3	today, had you seen Exhibit 24?
4	A. Never.
5	Q. Do you know the source of Exhibit 24?
6	A. I don't know the source.
7	Q. I'm going to hand to you what's been marked
8	as Exhibit 25, which is a composite exhibit. Do you
9	recall seeing that earlier today?
10	A. Yes, I saw it today.
11	Q. Have you seen the material reflected in
12	Exhibit 25 before today?
13	MR. PORTAL: Objection, form, asked and
14	answered.
15	A. I've never seen these materials, no.
16	Q. Do you know the source of Exhibit 25?
17	MR. PORTAL: Objection, form.
18	A. I don't know that for a fact. I think the
19	lawyer mentioned where he received them from.
20	BY MR. COTTON:
21	Q. Other than what you heard from counsel for
22	plaintiff -- when you talk about the lawyer, you're
23	talking about counsel for plaintiff?
24	A. Yes.
189
1	you have any information as to the source of
2	Exhibit 25?
3	A. Not at all.
4	Q. Let me hand to you what was previously marked
5	as Exhibit 26. Do you recall seeing that earlier
6	today?
7	A. Yes, I saw this today.
8	Q. Prior to being shown Exhibit 26 today, have
9	you ever seen that document or collection of materials
10	before?
11	A. I am not sure whether I've seen this one in
12	particular before.
13	Q. Do you know the source?
14	A. I don't remember seeing it.
15	Q. Do you know the source of material reflected
16	in Exhibit 26?
17	A. No, I don't know the source.
18	Q. I hand to you what's previously marked as
19	Exhibit 27. Do you recall being asked questions
20	earlier today about Exhibit 27?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Do you know the source of materials reflected
23	in Exhibit 27?
24	A. No, I don't.
190
1	materials before today?
2	A. I have never seen these materials.
3	MR. COTTON: Doctor, I appreciate your
4	time. I have no further questions.
5	THE WITNESS: Thank you.
6	MR. PORTAL: No questions.
