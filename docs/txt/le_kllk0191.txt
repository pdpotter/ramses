1	CONTINUED RECROSS -EXAMINATION
2	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
3	Q. Ready to go?
4	A. I am.
5	Q. Okay. Good afternoon, Dr. Kyriakoudes.
6	A. Good afternoon.
7	Q. Yesterday, you talked about two of the
8	warnings that appeared on packs of cigarettes beginning
9	in 1966 and then 1970, correct?
10	A. That's correct.
11	Q. Okay. You're not a warnings expert, are you?
12	A. No, that's not an -- in the sense that I
13	evaluate the effectiveness of warnings in a
14	contemporary scenario, no, I don't do that.
15	Q. Right. You don't design warnings for the
16	placement on products, correct?
17	A. No.
18	Q. You don't evaluate the efficacy or
19	effectiveness of warnings that are placed on products,
20	correct?
21	A. No.
22	Q. And nor do you test how consumers perceive
23	the warnings, right?
24	A. No, I don't know how consumers perceive the
25	warnings.
0388
1	Q. Okay. And you don't know what impact the
2	warnings on cigarette packages had on the smoker or
3	smokers in this case; isn't that correct?
4	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
5	THE WITNESS: As individuals, no.
6	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
7	Q. Okay. You don't know whether the smoker or
8	smokers in this case already knew the information
9	communicated to them on the cigarette warnings, right?
10	A. I don't know that.
11	Q. Okay. And what you do know, though, is that
12	in 1966, it was unprecedented for -- are you all right?
13	A. Yeah. I just--I'm sorry. I have a bit of
14	a cough.
15	Q. That's okay.
16	What you do know, though, is that it was
17	unprecedented in 1966 for a warning label to be placed
18	on a consumer product, correct?
19	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
20	THE WITNESS: No. There is previous examples
21	in history --in modem American history of
22	products having warnings prior to that.
23	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
24	Q. Well, you're talking about poisons, right,
25	household cleaners, Comet, Ajax, things of that nature?
0389
1	A. That would be one example.
2	Q. Okay. But other -- other than those kind of
3	household cleaners that would be poisonous or toxic if
4	you swallowed it, cigarettes were the first consumer
5	product that had a warning like the one that was put on
6	in 1966, right?
7	A. Well, I've seen earlier examples of the
8	warnings on products as well.
9	Q. Like what?
10	A. There were --in fact, in my research, I've
11	discovered a class of devices known as medical
12	cigarettes in the 1920s and 1930 that had caution
13	labels on them.
14	Q. Now, let's talk about a product like
15	cigarettes that was, you know, widely marketed, widely
16	used by a large percentage of the American population.
17	In 1966, it was unprecedented for a product like that
18	to have a warning label, correct?
19	A. Well, we've already discussed a couple of
20	examples prior to that that -- so that wouldn't fit the
21	definition of unprecedented for me.
22	Q. Okay. Can you think of another product like
23	cigarettes that was used by as many people as
24	cigarettes were smoked in the United States in the
25	1960s that had a warning in 1966?
0390
1	A. Well, you've added a qualification there,
2	which is -- helps me agree with your answer in that --
3	by adding the qualification used by as many people
4	with, you know, essentially two thirds of men and over
5	a third of women using the cigarette. That's -- that
6	widespread use, the only other examples in something
7	that widely used would be things like cleaners,
8	household cleaners, and other caustic and toxic
9	substances.
10	Q. Right. And those things are poisonous,
11	right?
12	A. As are cigarettes.
13	Q. Okay. Those things have poisons that, if you
14	swallowed, could kill you within hours, right?
15	A. Yes. I would agree with that, yeah.
16	Q. It's a distinction I'm trying to draw. Do
17	you follow where I am going?
18	A. I follow you.
19	Q. Okay. Now, you showed -- this is Plaintiffs
20	Exhibit No. 21. And you and Mr. Acosta talked about it
21	yesterday. It said, Caution: Cigarette smoking may be
22	hazardous to your health. Correct?
23	A. Yes. That's what it says, yes.
24	Q. And this was put on cigarette packages
25	beginning January 1st, 1966, correct?
0391
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. All right. And let me -- I'm going to
3	display it. I don't have an extra copy. I have given
4	it to Mr. Acosta.
5	MR. ACOSTA: I gave it back.
6	MR. GERAGHTY: Oh, you did? Okay.
7	THE WITNESS: I hate to interrupt. I don't
8	want -- but I do really need to reaffirm that
9	there are precedents on these warnings, and so I
10	just wasn't satisfied with my previous answer. I
11	just want to go on the record saying that previous
12	products did have warning and caution labels on
13	them. I, you know, I felt a little bit badgered
14	in that exchange, and I just wanted to be clear.
15	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
16	Q. I will move to strike the response.
17	A. Fine. I was just offering an explanation.
18	It's not unprecedented. I just want to go on the
19	record as saying that.
20	Q. Okay.
21	A. And then you can continue.
22	Q. Well, Doctor, let's -- let me show you what's
23	been marked as Defendant's Exhibit No. 11.
24	(Defendant Exhibit 11 was marked for
25	identification.)
0392
1	MR. GERAGHTY: Go down a little bit.
2	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
3	Q. This is an article -- that's about as best I
4	can do. This was an article that was published in the
5	Tampa Tribune on December 28th, 1965.
6	Do you see that?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. And the point I'm trying to make, Doctor, is
9	the fact that warnings went on cigarette packages in
10	1966 was a newsworthy event, was it not?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. Okay. There was an article in the
13	Tampa Tribune several days before the warnings actually
14	appeared, talking about the fact that those warnings
15	would begin to appear beginning January the 1st, right?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. Okay. And this was an article from the
18	Tampa Tribune that you had not found in your own
19	research, correct?
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. Okay. Because you did not do a -- any kind
22	of review of the Tampa Tribune, correct?
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. Okay. You showed yesterday with Mr. Acosta
25	the warning that went on packs in 1970. And let me
0393
1	show that to you. That's Plaintiffs Exhibit 30,
2	right? You recognize that as the warning label?
3	A. I do.
4	Q. And it reads, Warning: The surgeon general
5	has determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to
6	your health. Correct?
7	A. Correct.
8	Q. And beginning -- help me. Is it 1970 or '71
9	all print advertisements by any cigarette manufacturer
10	were required to include this warning? Is that right?
11	A. That's right. They went on the cigarette
12	pack first, and then there was a gap. And '71 it went
13	on the advertising.
14	Q. Okay. So after about -- from 1971 forward,
15	any print advertisement published in any newspaper or
16	magazine in this country has had this warning or the
17	later 1985 warning on it, correct?
18	A. Yes, '85 warnings.
19	Q. Warnings, right.
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. And I will show you those in a moment.
22	And just so we are clear, if we go back to
23	the first warning that I showed you a moment ago,
24	warnings have appeared on cigarette packs in this
25	country now going back over 43 years, correct?
0394
1	A. Right. A caution label and then the more
2	modem warning regime.
3	Q. Okay. Every pack of cigarettes purchased by
4	the smoker in this case as of 1966 had a warning label
5	on it, correct?
6	A. Had either the caution label initially or the
7	warning -- the second warning that you showed or the
8	more current one, which you may be about to show.
9	Q. Okay. And then let's --1 will show you
10	what's been marked as Defendant's Exhibit No. 12.
11	(Defendant Exhibit 12 was marked for
12	identification.)
13	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
14	Q. And these are the series of four rotating
15	warnings that have been required to be on all cigarette
16	packages sold here in the United States since 1985,
17	correct?
18	A. That's correct.
19	Q. And just--1 don't want to go through all of
20	them, but -- well, strike that. Let's -- the first
21	warning says, Smoking causes lung cancer, heart
22	disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
23	Correct?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. And since 1985, for the last 24 years,
0395
1	essentially, every pack of cigarettes sold in this
2	country has had one of these four rotating warnings on
3	it, correct?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. Okay. Now, I want to ask you -- we talked a
6	little bit about the surgeon general's report, right,
7	and the information that was provided to the surgeon
8	general? And you also showed a clip yesterday from the
9	"See It Now" program where you -- I'm sorry, let me
10	rephrase that.
11	You showed a clip yesterday of Dr. DuPuis
12	from Philip Morris in a lab talking about testing of
13	components in tobacco smoke, right?
14	A. That's correct.
15	Q. Okay. And, Doctor, isn't it true -- I'm
16	going to show you what's been marked as Defendant's
17	Exhibit No. 13.
18	(Defendant Exhibit 13 was marked for
19	identification.)
20	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
21	Q. Let me ask you for a moment here--1 have
22	marked as Deposition Exhibit 13 a document dated May
23	20th, 1963, titled, Chemical Constituents in Tobacco
24	and Smoke, a compilation of published information
25	prepared by Philip Morris, Incorporated, correct?
0396
1	MR. ACOSTA: I need to object to that. I
2	don't remember getting this, and I object to it.
3	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
4	Q. That's the title of the document, right?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. And you had not found this particular
7	document in any of your own research, correct?
8	A. That -- this was not part of the stuff that I
9	gave you -- you mean for the deposition? I have seen
10	this document before.
11	Q. Right. But, Doctor, my question is, you saw
12	this when it was showed to you by a defense lawyer in
13	another trial, correct?
14	A. Yeah, a long time ago.
15	Q. Okay. And when it was shown to you, you had
16	never seen it before, right?
17	A. That's my recollection.
18	Q. Okay. And so this document you never found
19	on your own during the course of your own research into
20	these issues, correct?
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. All right. And what this document is,
23	essentially, if you turn to -- it's the Bates number
24	page 8523. It's about four or five pages in. It's an
25	alphabetical listing of components, chemicals that have
0397
1	been found in tobacco smoke, correct?
2	A. You're in the table of contents?
3	Q. I'm actually on the first page of the list.
4	A. Oh, I see.
5	Q. Do you see that?
6	A. Yeah. Let me catch up with you.
7	Q. Okay. And if you were to flip through this
8	and look through it more thoroughly, what you would see
9	is this is a list of chemicals found in tobacco that
10	had been identified and published in scientific
11	research as of the date this document was provided to
12	the surgeon general by Philip Morris, correct?
13	MR. ACOSTA: Object to the form.
14	THE WITNESS: I - I couldn't hear your
15	question.
16	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
17	Q. Let me -- let me --
18	A. Could you say it again?
19	Q. I'll rephrase it.
20	A. I just--
21	Q. Okay.
22	A. I was looking at this and trying to listen.
23	Q. If you look, Doctor, to the back of the
24	document, you will see that there are a series of
25	literature citations. And if you want me to help you
0398
I	out, I will try to help out with that. Its page is --
2	A. I'm just trying to keep up with you.
3	Q. Sure. I will show you. There is a section 3
4	called Literature references.
5	A. I think I'm finding it. Page 543, just a
6	couple of pages behind. Literature references.
7	Q. Right.
8	So you see this is a document that lists
9	chemicals that have been identified in tobacco smoke
10	and that have been referenced in published literature,
II	correct?
12	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
13	THE WITNESS: Yeah. These are the citations
14	of-
15	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
16	Q. Okay.
17	A. -- various articles.
18	Q. And if you flip to the very second page of
19	the document, there is a letter, right?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. And it's dated May 20th, 1963, from an
22	executive vice-president at Philip Morris to the
23	assistant surgeon general for operations, right?
24	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
25	THE WITNESS: Correct.
0399
1	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
2	Q. Okay. So this list of chemicals in cigarette
3	smoke was provided by Philip Morris to the surgeon
4	general prior to the release of his report in 1964,
5	correct?
6	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
7	THE WITNESS: Yes.
8	MR. ACOSTA: I move to -- move to strike.
9	THE WITNESS: Could you repeat the question
10	again? I'm trying to read and listen, so just --
11	so that I'm clear on what you asked.
12	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
13	Q. No. I think Mr. Acosta moved to strike your
14	response.
15	A. Oh, okay. I'm just trying to keep up.
16	Q. Right. Now, you talked a little bit about
17	the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, correct?
18	A. I did.
19	Q. And as you stated, their job was to fund
20	research, correct?
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. And they have actually published research,
23	have they not?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. And I will just -- I'm going to show it to
0400
1	you. It's a very long -- large book. You've seen this
2	book before, right? I'm holding up a green book.
3	It's, Tobacco: Experimental and Clinical Studies, by
4	Drs. Larson, Haag, Silvette, correct?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. And you have seen this document before, have
7	you not, this book?
8	A. I have.
9	Q. Okay. And you know that this is an
10	encyclopedia or compendium of as many as 6,000 articles
11	on cigarette smoking and health, correct?
12	A. Correct.
13	Q. And that book, as the acknowledgements show,
14	was funded by a grant from the Tobacco Industry
15	Research Committee, correct?
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. Okay. And the information in that -- it was
18	published in 1961, right?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Okay. And the information in that book was
21	provided to the surgeon general prior to the
22	publication of his 1964 report, correct?
23	A. It would have been available to him, yes.
24	Q. Well, you know that the surgeon general
25	actually cited some of the research and this book in
0401
1	support of its conclusions, correct?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Okay.
4	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're going to change
5	tapes while you're --
6	MR. GERAGHTY: Sure.
7	(Brief recess was taken.)
8	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Okay. We're on.
9	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
10	Q. Okay. Doctor, let me switch gears with you
11	for just a moment.
12	You talked yesterday a little bit about --
13	very briefly about nicotine and whether cigarette
14	smoking was addictive, right?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. You're -- you're not an expert in nicotine or
17	nicotine addiction, are you?
18	A. No, I am not.
19	Q. Okay. You don't have any expertise or
20	training in the area of nicotine pharmacology, do you?
21	A. I do not.
22	Q. You don't have any scientific expertise at
23	all on the effects of nicotine on the human body,
24	correct?
25	A. No.
0402
1	Q. And you're not an expert in the field of
2	human psychology, are you?
3	A. No, I am not.
4	Q. Okay. You're familiar with a Dr. Jack
5	Henningfield, right?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Okay. Are you familiar with a Dr. Neal
8	Benowitz?
9	A. I don't know him, but I know the name --of
10	the name.
11	Q. Okay. Did you know that they were both
12	designated as experts by the plaintiff in this case?
13	A. No.
14	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
15	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
16	Q. Okay. Do you know Dr. Jack Henningfield's
17	background and credentials?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. Okay. Would you agree that he knows more
20	than you do about nicotine and nicotine addiction and
21	the addictive effects of cigarette smoking?
22	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
23	THE WITNESS: As - yeah, as a
24	pharmacologist, absolutely, yeah.
25	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
0403
1	Q. Isn't it true -- we talked about this
2	earlier. But isn't it true, Doctor, that you have
3	never done any systematic comprehensive review of any
4	newspaper or any magazine on the issue of nicotine?
5	Right?
6	A. No, I have not found that to be widely
7	covered in my review of the papers.
8	Q. Okay. And you have not done any systematic
9	or comprehensive review of the word "addiction" in any
10	newspaper or magazine or any other kind of literature,
11	correct?
12	A. I mean, I have read about addiction. In the
13	press it's sometimes discussed, but not addiction
14	all -- the entire subject of addiction, no.
15	Q. You have not done a systematic or
16	comprehensive review of references to the word
17	"addiction" in any newspaper, magazine, or any other
18	kind of publication, right?
19	A. Not as a key word search in The New York
20	Times, no.
21	Q. Well, not anywhere, right?
22	A. Well, I have looked up in the Reader's Guide
23	to Periodical Literature, things like that.
24	Q. Doctor, you know what a systematic and
25	comprehensive review of a magazine or newspaper is,
0404
1	right?
2	A. Well, I rely on -- on indexing tools.
3	Q. Okay. But, Doctor, you're a historian. You
4	do research, correct?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. That's what you do for a living, right?
7	A. That's right.
8	Q. And you know what it means to do systematic
9	and comprehensive research, right?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. You have not done any systematic or
12	comprehensive research on the word "addiction" in any
13	publication, have you?
14	A. In any particular publication?
15	Q. Right.
16	A. I have researched the word "addiction,"
17	particularly in the 1950s -- there is not a lot on
18	it -- as it relates to tobacco in popular magazines
19	like the Reader's Digest. So I have done it for the
20	Reader's Digest.
21	Q. So you think you have done a systematic
22	review for the word "addiction" for the Reader's Digest
23	in the 1950s, right?
24	A. Not just the word "addiction"; I was looking
25	for nicotine, smoking habit, smoking addiction.
0405
1	Q. Other than that, you haven't done any
2	systematic or thorough or comprehensive review of that
3	word in any other publication for any other period of
4	time, right?
5	A. Except for that and looking at references
6	that come up in the Reader's Guide to Periodical
7	Literature for the 1950s.
8	Q. Let me show you what we have marked as
9	Deposition Exhibit No. 14.
10	A. Uh-huh (Indicates affirmatively).
11	(Defendant Exhibit 14 was marked for
12	identification.)
13	MR. ACOSTA: I need to object to this one,
14	too. I don't think I've ever seen this, and it
15	wasn't provided to me.
16	MR. GERAGHTY: Well, I think the record will
17	reflect that it was, but your objection is noted.
18	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
19	Q. If you want to see it in a version that's a
20	little bit easier to read, flip to the second page,
21	Doctor.
22	Do you see that?
23	A. I do.
24	Q. Okay. What we've marked as Deposition
25	Exhibit No. 14 is a letter from John Quincy Adams to
0406
1	Reverend Samuel H. Cox dated August 19th, 1845,
2	correct?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. Okay. And do you know who John Quincy Adams
5	was?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. He was the sixth president of the United
8	States? I think that's right.
9	A. Yeah. I could count them out.
10	Q. He was a former president of the United
11	States, right?
12	A. Yeah.
13	Q. He was the son of the first John Adams, who
14	was the second president of the United States, right?
15	A. That's right.
16	Q. Okay. All right. This is a letter that John
17	Quincy Adams, former president of the United States,
18	wrote to this reverend August 19th, 1845. And if you
19	take a look at the second sentence, he wrote, quote, In
20	my early youth, I was addicted to the use of tobacco
21	and two of its mysteries, smoking and chewing.
22	Did I read that correctly?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. If you drop down to the next -- well,
25	actually, let's read the next sentence and the sentence
0407
1	thereafter.
2	It says, I was warned by a medical friend of
3	the pernicious operation of this habit upon the stomach
4	and the nerves. The advice of the physician was
5	fortified by the results of my own experience.
6	Did I read that correctly?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. It says, More than 30 years have passed away
9	since I've deliberately renounced the use of tobacco in
10	all its forms. And although the resolution was not
11	carried into execution without a struggle of vitiated
12	nature, I never yielded to its impulses, and in the
13	space of three or four months of self-denial, they lost
14	their stimulating power, and I have never since felt it
15	as a privation.
16	Did I read that correctly?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. And this is, then, a letter dated well over
19	150 years ago in which John Quincy Adams refers to the
20	use of tobacco as addicting, correct?
21	A. He uses that word.
22	Q. This is a document, a letter, that you did
23	not find in the course of any of your research on the
24	issues of tobacco and health, correct?
25	A. Not the original letter. It's often cited in
0408
1	standard histories of tobacco.
2	Q. In your own original research, did you find
3	this letter, yes or no, Doctor?
4	A. No, no. But it's cited frequently.
5	Q. Now, you mentioned the Reader's Digest,
6	correct?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. All right. Let me show you what we have
9	marked as Deposition Exhibit No. 15.
10	(Defendant Exhibit 15 was marked for
11	identification.)
12	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
13	Q. Deposition Exhibit No. 15, Dr. Kyriakoudes,
14	is an article from the August 1938 edition of the
15	Reader's Digest, correct?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. And the title is, So You're Going to Stop
18	Smoking, question mark, by Henry C. Link, Ph.D.,
19	correct?
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. And if you read -- let me read the very first
22	paragraph, if I could. Well, let me ask you, first:
23	Did you find this article in your own original
24	research?
25	A. I have, yes.
0409
1	Q. Okay. You have seen this article before?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And let me read to you the first paragraph.
4	Sooner or later, nearly every cigarette
5	smoker discovers that he is not smoking by choice but
6	by habit and that the habit is probably harmful. So he
7	tries to break free from it but finds that he doesn't
8	know how. Sometimes half-heartedly, sometimes
9	earnestly, he wrestles with his addiction but in vain.
10	His self-control has been perilously undermined by a
11	mere mechanism of habit.
12	Did I read that first full paragraph
13	correctly?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And so this is an article published in the
16	Reader's Digest in 1938 where Dr. Link refers to
17	cigarette smoking as both a habit and an addiction in
18	the very same paragraph, right? See, he uses the word
19	"addiction" four lines from the bottom?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. Okay. So in this article, Dr. Link refers to
22	smoking as both an addiction and a habit in the same
23	paragraph, right?
24	A. That's correct.
25	Q. Now, we talked about the -- we talked already
0410
1	a little bit about the surgeon general's report, right,
2	the 1964 surgeon general's report? Correct?
3	A. That's correct.
4	Q. And let me -- well, let me ask you this: You
5	had talked about cigarette sales rising over periods in
6	time, right?
7	A. The trend was upward, yes --
8	Q. Okay.
9	A. - until 1982.
10	Q. Now, what you -- what you didn't mention,
11	though, was the prevalence of smoking within the
12	population, however, had begun to decline many years
13	earlier than the date you talked about with Mr. Acosta
14	yesterday; isn't that right?
15	A. Yeah. Prevalence has a different pattern.
16	He didn't ask me about that.
17	Q. And if you look at, for example, literature
18	by the surgeon general, more recent literature by the
19	surgeon general, the surgeon general believes that
20	prevalence of cigarette smoking as percentage of the
21	population is a better indicator of the public's
22	awareness of issues than cigarette sales itself, right?
23	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form. And I need to
24	make sure that we still have our standing
25	objection on the scope regarding awareness.
0411
1	MR. GERAGHTY: Well, I didn't think that
2	that's what I was doing, but if you want to have
3	an objection, you can have an objection to that
4	question.
5	MR. ACOSTA: Well, we -
6	MR. GERAGHTY: To every other question,
7	you've asked me, for the last three hours, you
8	have an objection to it?
9	MR. ACOSTA: Well, we've agreed previously
10	that we had a standing objection to the scope
11	of—
12	MR. GERAGHTY: That's fine.
13	MR. ACOSTA: - cross.
14	MR. GERAGHTY: That's fine.
15	MR. ACOSTA: Thanks.
16	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
17	Q. Isn't that right?
18	A. Well, prevalence and per capita consumption
19	both are good indicators of behavior.
20	Q. Okay. The surgeon general believes that
21	prevalence is the better indicator, correct? Correct?
22	A. For behavior?
23	Q. Yes.
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. Okay. You didn't mention prevalence
0412
1	yesterday, did you?
2	A. I wasn't asked about prevalence.
3	Q. Okay. Mr. Acosta didn't ask you any
4	questions about prevalence; is that right?
5	A. He asked me about sales.
6	Q. Okay.
7	A. I have talked about prevalence many times in
8	this --
9	Q. Okay.
10	A. --in this venue.
11	Q. Let me show you a document that we have
12	marked as Deposition Exhibit No. 16.
13	(Defendant Exhibit 16 was marked for
14	identification.)
15	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
16	Q. Deposition Exhibit No. 16, Doctor, is an
17	article dated January the 11th, 1994, from the
18	St. Petersburg's Times, correct?
19	A. Okay. Yeah, I see that now.
20	Q. Okay. This is an article that you did not
21	find in any of your own research, right?
22	A. No, I didn't read this paper.
23	Q. Okay. Did you look at it last night as one
24	of the documents that we provided to Mr. Acosta?
25	A. I probably skimmed over this one.
0413
1	MR. ACOSTA: Can you give me the number that
2	it -- that it is.
3	MR. GERAGHTY: I will have to do it later. I
4	can't do it right now.
5	MR. ACOSTA: Because I don't --1 don't
6	remember seeing this one.
7	THE WITNESS: Yeah, I don't-
8	MR. GERAGHTY: Well, if you want an objection
9	subject to us demonstrating that we provided it to
10	you, that's fine.
11	MR. ACOSTA: Okay.
12	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
13	Q. The article is titled, The day smoking, lung
14	cancer linked. Correct?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. And if you -- you see by the date that it was
17	actually published on the 30th anniversary of the
18	release of the surgeon general's report; isn't that
19	correct?
20	A. That's true.
21	Q. And reading from the very first paragraph, it
22	says, Thirty years ago today a modest brown paperback
23	book released by the U.S. government started history's
24	sharpest decline in smoking. It was the surgeon
25	general's report on smoking and health.
0414
1	Did I read that correctly?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Okay. Drop down to the fourth paragraph. It
4	says, Researchers had noticed an increase in lung
5	cancer among Americans as long ago as 1900.
6	Did I read that correctly?
7	A. You read it correctly.
8	Q. And does your own historical research confirm
9	the accuracy of that statement?
10	A. Well, in 1900, lung cancer was a very rare
11	cancer, so I'm sure some researchers may have noticed
12	it, but it was not --1 don't want anyone to be left
13	with the impression that it was a pervasive cancer in
14	1900.
15	Q. Well, didn't you tell the jury yesterday that
16	lung cancer was becoming an epidemic in the twenties
17	and thirties and forties?
18	A. That's right. It sharply rises later in
19	time.
20	Q. Okay.
21	Several studies in the 1950s pointed to
22	cigarettes, but the surgeon general's report put the
23	word cigarettes and cancer on front pages of around the
24	world?
25	Did I read that part correctly?
0415
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. Okay. The next paragraph reads, Cigarette
3	consumption in the United States dropped 20 percent in
4	the three months after the January 11th, 1964, release
5	of the report.
6	Correct?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. Okay. And in response to the questions
9	Mr. Acosta asked you, you didn't tell the jury that,
10	did you?
11	A. Well, sales -- in this case, they're dealing
12	with total sales, and sales didn't recover.
13	Q. But it dropped 20 percent after the release
14	of the surgeon general's report, did it not?
15	A. Yes. There was a dip --
16	Q. Okay.
17	A. -- in sales.
18	Q. And you didn't say that to the jury yesterday
19	in response to Mr. Acosta's questions, did you?
20	A. He didn't ask me about that.
21	Q. Okay. It says -- if you read the next
22	paragraph, it says, It has since proven to be a
23	landmark in U.S. public health. It not only halted the
24	decade's long rise in number of American smokers, it
25	initiated a steady decline, right?
0416
1	A. That's what it says.
2	Q. And you agree with that, don't you?
3	A. It is a landmark in the history of public
4	health.
5	Q. Okay. All right. And that's something you
6	didn't find in your historical research in this case,
7	isn't that correct?
8	A. This particular newspaper article?
9	Q. This particular newspaper article, right?
10	A. Right. Yes, I didn't find this.
11	Q. And that was not something you told the jury
12	in response to the questions Mr. Acosta asked you,
13	right?
14	A. Well, I have never seen this. But it doesn't
15	contain any information to which I was, you know,
16	unaware.
17	Q. So you're saying you knew everything that was
18	in this article at the time you testified yesterday,
19	right?
20	A. Sure.
21	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay. Those are all the
22	questions I have.
23	(Brief recess was taken.)
24	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're on the record.
25	CROSS-EXAMINATION
0417
1	BY MR. KOETHE:
2	Q. Good afternoon, Dr. Kyriakoudes. My name is
3	Paul Koethe. We've met before; is that right?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. And I have taken your deposition several
6	times; is that right?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. Okay. I have a few questions for you this
9	afternoon. Yesterday, you spoke briefly about a
10	document entitled, Survey of Cancer Research, written
11	in 1953 by Claude Teague. Do you remember that?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. And that was Plaintiffs Exhibit No. 2. By
14	way of background, Claude Teague was a researcher at
15	R.J. Reynolds in 1953; is that right?
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. And that document was a survey of publicly
18	available peer-reviewed literature in 1953 on the topic
19	of cancer research; is that right?
20	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
21	THE WITNESS: That's what it was.
22	BY MR. KOETHE:
23	Q. Okay. And in that document, in the back,
24	there was a bibliography. Do you recall that?
25	A. Yes.
0418
1	Q. And in that bibliography, there were listed
2	78 published studies relating to cancer research; is
3	that right?
4	A. That's right.
5	Q. Okay. And that bibliography contained
6	articles published in the American Journal of Medicine,
7	Lancet, which is a British medical journal; is that
8	right?
9	A. That's right.
10	Q. That contained references to the American
11	Journal of Cancer. Do you recall that?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. The Journal of the National Cancer Institute?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And that's a government --U.S. government
16	entity, correct?
17	A. Yes. The NCI is a government entity.
18	Q. As well as articles in the Journal of the
19	American Medical Association cited in Claude Teague's
20	bibliography; is that right?
21	A. That's right.
22	Q. And those 78 studies were all publicly
23	available as of 1953; is that right?
24	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
25	THE WITNESS: Publicly available meaning?
0419
1	BY MR. KOETHE:
2	Q. Meaning that the research was available in
3	published journals such as the ones we just discussed?
4	A. Yes, it was available in those published
5	journals.
6	Q. Nothing in the documents that were cited
7	there were known only to Reynolds; is that right?
8	A. Well, the journals were available to people
9	who subscribed to those journals and specialists who
10	could understand it and interpret their contents.
11	Q. Okay. So all the research literature that
12	was cited in this Teague document was publicly
13	available and accessible to anyone who was interested
14	in looking for it --
15	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
16	BY MR. KOETHE:
17	Q. --is that right?
18	A. Yeah. Which would be scientists, generally.
19	Q. And you've testified that you're not an
20	expert in the science of cancer research; is that
21	right?
22	A. That's right.
23	Q. All right. That's not your area of
24	expertise, is it?
25	A. That's correct.
0420
1	Q. Okay. You mentioned briefly yesterday a 1990
2	letter to the principal of Willow Ridge School in
3	Amherst, New York. Do you remember that?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. And none of the smokers in any of the cases
6	that you've worked on ever attended Willow Ridge School
7	in New York, did they?
8	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
9	THE WITNESS: Not that I'm aware of.
10	BY MR. KOETHE:
11	Q. And you have no information that the smoker
12	in this case or the smokers in these cases ever
13	received a consumer letter from R.J. Reynolds, do you?
14	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
15	THE WITNESS: I don't know either way.
16	BY MR. KOETHE:
17	Q. I believe you testified that this particular
18	letter was written in response to several letters that
19	Reynolds had received from students at the Willow Ridge
20	school; is that right?
21	A. It's referenced in the letter, yes.
22	Q. Okay. And were you aware that those students
23	at Willow Ridge school were prompted to write to
24	Reynolds by one of the plaintiffs expert witnesses in
25	this case?
0421
1	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form, and I move to
2	strike that.
3	THE WITNESS: No, I'm not - I don't know the
4	circumstances of how the letter was written.
5	BY MR. KOETHE:
6	Q. Did you know that one of the plaintiffs
7	expert witnesses in this case actually gave an
8	anti-smoking lecture to the students at Willow Ridge
9	school in 1990 that suggested that they write to
10	R.J. Reynolds?
11	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form. Move to strike.
12	THE WITNESS: No, I didn't know that.
13	BY MR. KOETHE:
14	Q. Did Mr. Acosta tell you that one of
15	plaintiffs expert witnesses prompted the students at
16	Willow Ridge school to write to R.J. Reynolds?
17	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form. Move to strike.
18	THE WITNESS: No, I didn't know that.
19	BY MR. KOETHE:
20	Q. You mentioned yesterday --
21	A. I should point out there are many letters in
22	the R J. collection, RJR consumer letter collection,
23	that offer the same kind of information.
24	Q. I move to strike as no question is pending.
25	You have --
0422
1	MR. ACOSTA: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
2	I think he was answering your last question. I
3	will move to strike your motion to strike.
4	BY MR. KOETHE:
5	Q. You are not aware of any smoker in this case
6	or in these cases having received a consumer letter
7	from R.J. Reynolds, are you, Professor?
8	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
9	THE COURT: In this case? No, I haven't
10	researched the particulars of the individuals in
11	this case.
12	BY MR. KOETHE:
13	Q. Yesterday, you briefly mentioned cigarette
14	sponsorship of television shows in the 1960s. Do you
15	recall that?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. And one of the shows you mentioned was the
18	Flintstones.
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Do you recall that?
21	A. (Nods affirmatively).
22	Q. And that show premiered in 1960; is that
23	right?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. And at the time, that program ran on evening
0423
1	television during the week; is that right?
2	A. That's right.
3	Q. And it was billed as an adult comedy by the
4	sponsors; isn't that right?
5	A. It was.
6	MR. ACOSTA: You know, I have the same
7	objection about the scope of -- of your cross
8	considering what happened on direct. Do I -- do I
9	need to object to every question on that basis, or
10	can I have a standing objection?
11	MR. KOETHE: You can have a standing
12	objection.
13	MR. ACOSTA: Thank you.
14	Is that for me or —
15	MR. KOETHE: That's for you.
16	MR. ACOSTA: Thanks.
17	BY MR. KOETHE:
18	Q. I'm going to hand what we have marked as
19	Defendant Exhibit 17 to you. Just take a minute to
20	look at that.
21	(Defendant Exhibit 17 was marked for
22	identification.)
23	BY MR. KOETHE:
24	Q. Have you had a chance to look at it,
25	Professor?
0424
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. And this is an October 1st, 1960, issue of TV
3	Guide; is that right?
4	A. That's right.
5	Q. And in it there is an advertisement for the
6	Flintstones; is that right?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. And it states, New half hour TV cartoon for
9	adults.
10	Did I read that correctly?
11	A. You read it correctly.
12	Q. And it mentions, Every Friday at 7:00 and
13	8:30 p.m.; is that right?
14	A. That's correct.
15	Q. And it notes that the program was sponsored
16	by Winston cigarettes and also by Miles Laboratory, the
17	makers of One A Day vitamins; is that right?
18	A. That's correct.
19	Q. So, certainly, at this time, other companies
20	besides tobacco companies were sponsoring television
21	programs; is that true?
22	A. Yes, that's true. Tobacco companies were
23	among other companies.
24	Q. And it was much later that the Flintstones
25	began running on Saturday morning television, is that
0425
1	right, in syndication form?
2	A. Yeah. I mean, I haven't researched when it
3	became syndicated, but my own personal memory is, from
4	growing up in the late sixties, it was certainly by the
5	late sixties.
6	Q. And you know that no cigarettes were
7	advertised on the Flintstones during the time that
8	program ran on Saturday morning; isn't that right?
9	A. I personally don't remember seeing an ad for
10	that.
11	Q. Isn't it true, Doctor, that no cigarettes
12	were advertised on the Flintstones -- on the
13	Flintstones program when that program ran on Saturday
14	mornings?
15	A. That's my personal recollection.
16	Q. And, in fact, you've testified under oath to
17	that effect, have you not?
18	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
19	THE WITNESS: I may have. If you've got it,
20	then that's fine. I'm not going to disagree with
21	that. You don't have to get it out. I mean, I'm
22	not disagreeing with you.
23	BY MR. KOETHE:
24	Q. Just so we're clear --
25	A. Yeah.
0426
I	Q. — cigarettes --
2	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
3	BY MR. KOETHE:
4	Q. — were not advertised on the Flintstones
5	when that program ran on Saturday mornings --
6	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
7	BY MR. KOETHE:
8	Q. -- is that correct?
9	A. I believe that to be correct, yes.
10	Q. And you don't know whether the particular
II	smoker in this case or the smokers in these cases ever
12	watched the Flintstones; isn't that right?
13	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
14	THE WITNESS: That's correct. I don't know
15	the specific case details of the plaintiffs.
16	BY MR. KOETHE:
17	Q. You made a brief reference yesterday to Joe
18	Camel. Do you remember that?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. And Joe Camel was an advertising campaign
21	that first ran in the late 1980s; is that correct?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. In fact, it ran beginning in 1988; is that
24	right?
25	A. Yes.
0427
1	Q. And you understand that the smoker in this
2	case, and each of the smokers in these cases you're
3	working on in Florida, were grown adults in 1988; isn't
4	that right?
5	A. I will accept that from you. Again, I
6	haven't researched the details of the individual
7	smokers, but I assume they were adults.
8	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
9	BY MR. KOETHE:
10	Q. You know that the smoker in this case, and in
11	all these cases, allege injury from smoking that
12	occurred in 1996 or earlier; isn't that right?
13	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
14	THE WITNESS: Yes, that's what I understand
15	to be the case.
16	BY MR. KOETHE:
17	Q. And so the smoker in this case, and all the
18	smokers in all these cases, would have been adults in
19	1988; isn't that right?
20	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
21	THE WITNESS: Yes. That seems reasonable.
22	BY MR. KOETHE:
23	Q. And you don't know whether the smoker in this
24	case or any of the smokers in these cases saw or relied
25	upon any Joe Camel advertising, do you?
0428
1	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
2	THE WITNESS: No, I haven't made
3	representation to that.
4	BY MR. KOETHE:
5	Q. Yesterday, you briefly discussed a 1985 New
6	York Times article entitled, U.S. Spends $5,000,000
7	Yearly on a Search for a Safe Cigarette. Do you recall
8	that?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And I think Mr. Geraghty asked you about this
11	article today; is that right?
12	A. He's -- it's been a long day. It's been a
13	long day.
14	Q. And you don't know --
15	A. Yeah.
16	Q. -- whether or not this is an article that you
17	found in your research or an article that Mr. Acosta
18	provided to you; is that right?
19	A. That's right. I'll have to check my notes.
20	Q. This is Plaintiffs Exhibit 36 that
21	Mr. Acosta marked yesterday.
22	A. Uh-huh (Indicates affirmatively).
23	Q. Can you read that, Doctor?
24	A. Yeah, I can read it.
25	Q. Doctor, follow along with me. The article
0429
1	begins, The Department of Agriculture is spending 5.3
2	million a year on research to develop tobacco for a
3	safe cigarette, an effort criticized as improper by
4	anti-smoking advocates in the administration in
5	Congress but defended by others.
6	Did I read that correctly?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. And the next paragraph begins, I think it is
9	a waste of money.
10	And that's a quote from Representative Henry
11	Waxman; is that right?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. And I read that correctly?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And then he went on to say, They can't
16	develop a safe cigarette. Is that -- did I read that
17	correctly?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. It goes on to say, Mr. Waxman, a California
20	democrat who has one passage in Congress of bills aimed
21	at discouraging smoking, was supported in his view by
22	Donald R. Shopland, acting director of the office on
23	smoking and health in the Department of Health and
24	Human Services.
25	Did I read that correctly?
0430
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. And Shopland went on to say, The conclusion
3	that we reached some years ago is that there was no
4	safe cigarette, Mr. Shopland said.
5	Did I read that correctly?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. And you know, based on your research, that
8	the U.S. government has publicly stated for a number of
9	years that there is no such thing as a safe cigarette;
10	isn't that right?
11	A. That's correct.
12	Q. And that's something you have seen in The New
13	York Times articles that you've researched and other
14	materials that you've looked at, correct?
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. And in this article, the Department of Health
17	and Human Services director -- and that's a federal
18	U.S. governmental body; is that right?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. And the acting director at the time in 1985
21	indicated that there was no such thing as a safe
22	cigarette; is that right?
23	A. Right. He's actually head of the office of
24	smoking and health.
25	MR. ACOSTA: I would like you to --1 would
0431
1	like to invoke the rule of completeness and ask
2	that you read, along with that, the paragraph
3	under the title, Tobacco Institute Denies Report,
4	please, and include that in your question.
5	MR. KOETHE: I'm happy to do it. I don't
6	think it —
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Bears no relation to --
8	MR. KOETHE: -- has anything to do with
9	the --
10	MR. GERAGHTY: - to the subject.
11	MR. KOETHE: Has no relationship to what I'm
12	asking about, but --
13	MR. ACOSTA: Well, I think it's -
14	MR. KOETHE: Let me finish my questioning,
15	and then we will read that into the record.
16	BY MR. KOETHE:
17	Q. Now, Professor, you said yesterday, at the
18	time this article came out, Reynolds was working on a
19	cigarette called Premier; is that right?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. And Premier is a product that was actually
22	first introduced in test market in the summer of 1988;
23	is that right?
24	A. That's right.
25	Q. So that would have been three years after
0432
1	this article was written, correct?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Okay. And when R.J. Reynolds introduced
4	Premier, they published a 750-page monograph about the
5	product; isn't that right?
6	A. I haven't seen that, so --
7	Q. That's not something you looked at in your
8	research?
9	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
10	THE WITNESS: No. I just followed it in the
11	public press.
12	BY MR. KOETHE:
13	Q. And you previously testified that you're not
14	an expert on Premier or the science behind Premier
15	cigarette; is that right?
16	A. Right. Yeah, I'm not a cigarette design
17	specialist.
18	Q. The topic of Premier and the topic of safer
19	cigarette designs is not an area of your expertise,
20	correct?
21	A. That's right.
22	MR. KOETHE: Howard, if you want to read
23	something in, you're more than welcome to do it.
24	MR. ACOSTA: Okay.
25	MR. KOETHE: Subject to objection.
0433
1	MR. ACOSTA: Well, under the rule of
2	completeness, I would like the jury to know that
3	in this article that Dr. Kyriakoudes has been
4	discussing, which you brought up due to a
5	reference earlier regarding David Fishel, a
6	spokesman for R.J. Reynolds, who indicated that
7	R.J. Reynolds was not attempting to make a safer
8	cigarette because they don't know anything about
9	the cigarette that makes it unsafe, it goes on to
10	say, under the heading, Tobacco Institute denies
11	report, Anne Duffin, a spokesman for The Tobacco
12	Institute, which represents cigarette
13	manufacturers, said cigarette companies were not
14	trying to develop safe cigarettes and disputed the
15	premise of the question. That assumes that
16	cigarettes are not safe, she said. We don't -- we
17	don't know that for sure. We don't know that
18	cigarettes are harmful.
19	MR. GERAGHTY: And I move to strike the--
20	the reading of that because of the speech made by
21	counsel and because counsel also alluded to all
22	that on direct. And there is no rule of
23	completeness that would require this to be read at
24	this point.
25	MR. KOETHE: I would like to go on and finish
0434
1	up about -- after what Mr. Acosta read.
2	BY MR. KOETHE:
3	Q. Do you see the tail end of the article?
4	Mr. Waxman states, I think it's an improper use of
5	government money. Maybe we can stop it.
6	Did I read that correctly?
7	A. Yes, you did.
8	Q. And that's because the government had been
9	publicly advocating for some time that there was no
10	such thing as a safe cigarette; isn't that right?
11	A. Well, keep in mind, just for accuracy, some
12	government agencies. I mean, certainly, the department
13	of agriculture was pursuing that program. And that's
14	also a part of the government.
15	Q. And the Department of Health and Human
16	services and the office of smoking and health had taken
17	the position that the only safe cigarette is a
18	cigarette that's not smoked; isn't that right?
19	A. Yes.
20	MR. KOETHE: I have no further questions.
21	(Brief recess was taken.)
22	MR. ACOSTA: Counsel for Liggett and I are
23	agreeing that I can maintain the same standing
24	objection as to the scope of the questions on
25	cross.
0435
1	MR. GERAGHTY: Can I -- can I have a standing
2	objection to all your questions on direct?
3	MR. ACOSTA: No.
4	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're on record.
5	MR. ROSENSTEIN: Okay. Great.
6	CROSS-EXAMINATION
7	BY MR. ROSENSTEIN:
8	Q. Good afternoon, Professor Kyriakoudes. My
9	name is Michael Rosenstein, and I'm here today on
10	behalf of Defendant Liggett Group, who you have been
11	referring to the predecessor of Liggett as
12	Liggett & Myers during your direct exam. That's
13	correct?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. I don't have a lot of questions for you, but
16	I just want to touch on a few things you talked about
17	during direct examination, hopefully clarify a few
18	points.
19	If we could start by focusing on a few events
20	that occurred in or around the year 1954, is that okay?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And around this time, you will agree there
23	was considerable -- considerable amount of press about
24	certain published studies that associated smoking
25	cigarettes with cancer; isn't that true?
0436
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. And in response, sir, you mentioned that a
3	number of the tobacco companies decided to hold a
4	meeting in New York City at the Park Plaza Hotel,
5	correct?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Now, it's undisputed that Liggett did not
8	attend the meeting of different company officials at
9	the Park Plaza Hotel, right?
10	A. I don't think they were at the meeting.
11	Q. Okay.
12	A. I would have to double check on that. I know
13	they didn't sign the Frank Statement. I don't know if
14	they had a representative or not at the meeting. I'd
15	have to --
16	Q. You just don't know either way at this point?
17	A. If they had a representative or not, yeah.
18	Q. Okay. And as a result of the meeting, a
19	couple things occurred, correct?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. First, an advertisement was placed in
22	newspapers across the country called A Frank Statement
23	to Cigarette Smokers?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. That was sometime in January 1954?
0437
1	A. January 4th.
2	Q. Yeah. And we spoke about that a little
3	earlier during Mr. Geraghty's cross-examination,
4	correct?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. We saw that advertisement yesterday during
7	direct. It was put up on the projector, and you read
8	some of the names of companies that signed on to it,
9	correct?
10	A. That's right.
11	Q. And you testified yesterday it's undisputed;
12	Liggett had nothing to do with the creation or the
13	publication of the Frank Statement, correct?
14	A. They didn't sign the Frank Statement, that's
15	right. They were not part of that announcement.
16	Q. All right. The Frank Statement was announced
17	at the beginning of an industry research group, which
18	we heard about yesterday, called the Tobacco Industry
19	Research Committee, or the TIRC; is that correct?
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. And isn't it true that Liggett was never a
22	member of the TIRC?
23	A. Well, they later joined -- they joined at a
24	later time.
25	Q. And that's fine.
0438
1	A. Yeah.
2	Q. And that's part of what I want to clear up
3	here.
4	A. Okay.
5	Q. Yesterday -- yesterday you mentioned that the
6	TIRC eventually became the research group called the
7	Council for Tobacco Research, otherwise known as the
8	CTR?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. And if we could just clear up the timing of
11	the events for a moment, isn't it true that the Council
12	for Tobacco Research, or CTR, was formed after the
13	publication of the surgeon general's report in 1964?
14	A. That's correct.
15	Q. So while it was still called the TIRC, that
16	is, during the approximately first ten years of its
17	existence, from 1954 to 1964, Liggett was not a member
18	of that group?
19	A. Right.
20	Q. And, similarly, we touched on this earlier.
21	Liggett was not involved in its formation, correct?
22	A. Correct.
23	Q. Eventually, Liggett did join that industry
24	research group when it became the CTR in 1964. But
25	isn't it true that Liggett only joined that
0439
1	organization for a few years?
2	A. That's right.
3	Q. From 1964 to, I think it was, approximately
4	1968; is that correct?
5	A. Yeah, that sounds right.
6	Q. Then in 1968, Liggett withdrew its membership
7	and funding from the Council for Tobacco Research?
8	A. That's my recollection, yes.
9	Q. So for those four years, or so, over the
10	course of almost 50 years of its existence, Liggett was
11	not associated with that particular organization; is
12	that correct?
13	A. That's correct.
14	Q. Okay. I would just like to switch gears and
15	talk about a couple other things that you touched on
16	yesterday concerning Liggett's specific actions.
17	Isn't it true that sometime in 1954, Liggett
18	initiated its own independent research effort aimed at
19	smoking and health issues?
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. And in response, their response involved a
22	large scale investment -- investment and biological and
23	chemical testing of cigarettes; is that correct?
24	A. Can you run the question again?
25	Q. I apologize.
0440
1	A. Okay.
2	Q. Excuse me. I'll repeat it.
3	And in its response, their response was large
4	scale investment in biological and chemical testing of
5	cigarettes, correct?
6	A. Yes, through directly and through independent
7	research groups that they --
8	Q. Yeah. I believe yesterday --
9	A. -- hired.
10	Q. -- you mentioned a company called Arthur
11	D. Little, correct?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. There came a time that Liggett produced the
14	results of its biological and chemical testing program
15	to the advisory committee for the surgeon general that
16	was working on the formation of the surgeon general's
17	report, correct?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. And isn't it true that Liggett submitted nine
20	volumes of its research to the surgeon general in 1963?
21	A. Something like that. I —
22	Q. Okay.
23	A. That sounds right.
24	Q. And isn't it a fact that you never reviewed
25	the research submitted by Liggett to the surgeon
0441
1	general?
2	A. That's true, yes.
3	MR. ROSENSTEIN: I think that's all I have
4	for you.
5	THE WITNESS: Okay.
6	MR. ROSENSTEIN: Thank you for your time.
7	MR. ACOSTA: Why don't we take a little break
8	for a few minutes.
9	(Brief recess was taken.)
10	DIRECT EXAMINATION
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I'm going to get to ask a
13	few follow-up questions. And I'm going to start with
14	some questions following up to the attorney for
15	Liggett & Myers. And he asked you about Liggett back
16	in the mid-1950s.
17	Do you recall those questions?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. And did you state previously that the Frank
20	Statement was a response that the cigarette industry
21	made?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. And what was it a response to?
24	A. It was a response to the -- the appearance in
25	the press of a number of studies implicating cigarettes
0442
1	as a cause of lung cancer.
2	Q. And what was the industry response absent
3	Liggett?
4	MR. GERAGHTY: Object. Beyond the scope.
5	THE WITNESS: Are you -- Liggett was not a
6	signatory to the Frank Statement.
7	BY MR. ACOSTA:
8	Q. So what was the response of the rest of the
9	industry absent Liggett?
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
11	THE WITNESS: Oh, the response of the
12	industry as expressed in the Frank Statement -- is
13	that what you're asking?
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. Yes.
16	A. -- was that health was a paramount issue;
17	that the public's health was of paramount importance;
18	that they would initiate a research program to find the
19	true cause of cancer; and that their products were not
20	injurious to health.
21	Q. Now, did Liggett make a similar response
22	after the publicity that the Frank Statement addressed?
23	MR. ROSENSTEIN: Objection. Beyond the
24	scope.
25	THE WITNESS: Yes. Liggett made similar
0443
1	responses about its own products, yes.
2	BY MR. ACOSTA:
3	Q. Okay. And do you recall earlier we discussed
4	one of Liggett's advertising slogans back in 1955?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. Do you remember what that slogan was?
7	MR. ROSENSTEIN: Objection. Beyond the
8	scope.
9	THE WITNESS: Well, I believe you're
10	referring to an advertisement campaign that had
11	the text, Scientifically proven not to harm nose,
12	throat, or accessory organs.
13	BY MR. ACOSTA:
14	Q. And did they have their own scientists that
15	appeared in some of the Liggett & Myers advertisements?
16	MR. ROSENSTEIN: Objection. Beyond the
17	scope.
18	THE WITNESS: Yes. Liggett & Myers did
19	feature scientists in their advertisements.
20	MR. ACOSTA: You can have a standing --
21	MR. ROSENSTEIN: I ask for a standing -
22	MR. ACOSTA: Yeah. He has a standing
23	objection to the scope of my questions.
24	MR. ROSENSTEIN: Thank you.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0444
1	Q. And what was that scientist's name, if you
2	would recall?
3	A. Dr. Darkis.
4	Q. Dr. Darkis?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. Okay. And did Dr. Darkis's statements appear
7	in Liggett & Myers advertising after the Frank
8	Statement in 1954?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And what was the substance -- in fact, did --
11	was there a particular movie star that advertised
12	Liggett & Myers cigarettes?
13	A. Rosalind Russell would be one.
14	Q. And for younger people, can you tell us who
15	was Rosalind Russell?
16	A. Well, she was a very popular movie star in
17	the 1950s. Examples of films she would have appeared
18	in would be things like "Gypsy," "Auntie Marne," I
19	believe, was the name of one of her films.
20	Q. Could you compare her with -- her with a
21	movie star today with similar fame?
22	A. Well, by the 1950s, she was a little bit
23	older, so she would be, really, like a -- I'm drawing a
24	blank on the name, but the -- Meryl Streep. I would
25	compare her to Meryl Streep of -- in her own time that
0445
1	is a very popular, very well-respected actress, a
2	strong tendency towards sometimes comedic roles, very
3	flexible.
4	Q. And did she endorse L&M cigarettes?
5	A. Rosalind Russell?
6	Q. Yes.
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. And was it in those advertisements that there
9	was a letter appearing signed by Dr. Darkis?
10	A. Yes. These were -- this was the other
11	campaign that said, Just what the doctor ordered, and
12	there was a letter by Darkis.
13	Q. And then you were asked some questions about
14	Liggett & Myers' involvement in this Tobacco Industry
15	Research Committee and when they were involved.
16	Do you remember those questions?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Now, did you indicate that the -- that the
19	Liggett & Myers was not a member of the Tobacco
20	Industry Research Committee up through 1964? So from
21	'54 to '64, they were not a member of that committee?
22	A. Yes, that's what I indicated.
23	Q. But they became -- did they become a member
24	of The Tobacco Institute before 1964?
25	A. Yes, they did.
0446
1	Q. Were they one of the founding members of The
2	Tobacco Institute?
3	MR. ROSENSTEIN: Objection to this -
4	THE WITNESS: They were, yes.
5	MR. ROSENSTEIN: Objection to this line of
6	questioning. Beyond the scope.
7	MR. ACOSTA: Remember, you have a standing
8	objection.
9	MR. ROSENSTEIN: I know. I just thought it
10	was a different subject. Thank you.
11	MR. ACOSTA: Well, you can have it to all
12	subjects.
13	MR. ROSENSTEIN: Okay.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. Okay. So I'm going to ask the question
16	again.
17	Did -- was Liggett & Myers one of the
18	founding members of The Tobacco Institute?
19	A. It was.
20	Q. And The Tobacco Institute, what -- again,
21	what was its role?
22	A. The role of The Tobacco Institute was to
23	defend the cigarette against charges that it was
24	harmful to health.
25	Q. Did it do that in a public relations way?
0447
1	A. Yes.
2	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. All right. How -- and in defending the
5	tobacco industry against the charges that cigarettes
6	were harmful, how did it go about doing that?
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
8	THE WITNESS: It did so by getting its
9	message out through the news and public media and
10	other public ways, and also by lobbying
11	government.
12	BY MR. ACOSTA:
13	Q. And was it paid for by the cigarette
14	defendants in this case?
15	A. Yes. They all contributed to its operation.
16	Q. And did they spend significant money doing
17	the things that you just mentioned?
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection. Form.
19	THE WITNESS: Yes. The Tobacco Institute was
20	very well-funded.
21	BY MR. ACOSTA:
22	Q. And over how many years it was very
23	well-funded?
24	A. Well -
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Object to the form.
0448
1	THE WITNESS: -- from 1958, when it was
2	begun, until it was dissolved as a result of the
3	master settlement part of that agreement --
4	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection.
5	THE WITNESS: - in, like, the 1990s.
6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. All right.
8	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm sorry. Objection. Move
9	to strike the response.
10	BY MR. ACOSTA:
11	Q. Was The Tobacco Institute well-funded from
12	1958 until the late 1990s?
13	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
14	THE WITNESS: Yes.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. All right. I'm going to have to ask it a
17	different way. Where did The Tobacco Institute get
18	funding between 1958 and the late 1990s?
19	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
20	THE WITNESS: It was funded by contributions
21	from the major cigarette manufacturers who were
22	members.
23	BY MR. ACOSTA:
24	Q. All right. Are you talking about -- who --
25	are those members that you're talking about defendants
0449
1	in this case?
2	A. Yes, they are.
3	Q. Can you tell us what those defendants got for
4	their money in funding The Tobacco Institute?
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection. Form.
6	THE WITNESS: They got what is generally
7	acknowledged to be the most effective lobbying
8	organization of its time and the most effective
9	public relations effort of its time.
10	BY MR. ACOSTA:
11	Q. And did the cigarette company defendants
12	renew their pledges to fund The Tobacco Institute year
13	after year?
14	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection. Form.
15	THE WITNESS: Yes, they funded it year after
16	year.
17	BY MR. ACOSTA:
18	Q. Do you think if the--if their efforts in
19	defending the cigarette industry were not successful,
20	that the industry would have kept spending money on
21	them --
22	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection. Calls for
23	speculation.
24	BY MR. ACOSTA:
25	Q. -- as a matter of historical -- of your
0450
I	historical knowledge --
2	MR. GERAGHTY: Same-
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. -- of how the industry worked?
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
6	THE WITNESS: I think the continued support
7	of The Tobacco Institute by its member firms is
8	evidence of the -- of their belief that it was a
9	very effective use of their money.
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Move to strike.
II	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. Now, the Liggett & Myers attorney also asked
13	you about submitting nine volumes of research to the
14	surgeon general.
15	Do you remember that question?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. At the time, did Liggett & Myers take the
18	position that cigarette smoking was safe?
19	A. No, they did not.
20	Q. When -
21	A. I'm sorry, I misunderstood your question.
22	Let me -- ask it again.
23	Q. All right. At the time Liggett & Myers
24	submitted this nine volumes of research to the surgeon
25	general, were they taking the position that cigarette
0451
1	smoking was safe?
2	MR. ROSENSTEIN: I have a continuing
3	objection.
4	THE WITNESS: Yes. They took the position
5	that cigarette smoking was safe.
6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. And in -- do you know if any of that research
8	they indicated that smoking Liggett & Myers cigarettes,
9	for example, would cause cancer?
10	A. Ask me one more time.
11	MR. ROSENSTEIN: Objection.
12	BY MR. ACOSTA:
13	Q. Considering the fact that they took the
14	position that cigarette smoking was safe, was there
15	anything in that nine volumes of research which
16	indicated that cigarette smoking caused cancer?
17	A. I don't think so, no.
18	Q. Was there anything in the surgeon general's
19	report indicating that the research that was provided
20	to them by Liggett & Myers found cigarette smoking to
21	be a cause of cancer?
22	MR. ROSENSTEIN: Objection.
23	THE WITNESS: No, I did not see anything in
24	the surgeon general's report indicating that.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0452
1	Q. Now, I believe the attorney for Philip Morris
2	asked you a question about this book, Tobacco:
3	Experimental Studies, by Larson, Haag, and Silvette in
4	1961. Do you remember that?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. And that's -- let me bring it up and show
7	you, so we can use it demonstratively so people can --
8	so the jury might see it. Is this the book you're
9	talking about?
10	A. This is it.
11	Q. And that was the book that was shown to you
12	by defense counsel, the same -- same book?
13	A. Yes, same book.
14	Q. Okay. And this is the book that was
15	represented to you as being funded by the Tobacco
16	Industry Research Committee in part?
17	A. That's the book.
18	Q. And did -- do you know if the University of
19	Virginia, where these people taught, Larson -- P.S.
20	Larson, Ph.D., and H. Silvette, Ph.D., and H.B. Haag,
21	M.D., the Medical College of Virginia, do you know if
22	there was a relationship between that Medical College
23	of Virginia and any of the cigarette companies?
24	A. Yes, I do know that.
25	Q. Okay. And what was the relationship?
0453
1	A. A sponsored research relationship, granted
2	research, contract research. So the medical college
3	originally had a long tradition of conducting research
4	for the various cigarette manufacturers by -- in fact,
5	in the 1940s, the college was referred to by the
6	American Tobacco as being sold American, a reference to
7	their advertising slogan of the day.
8	Q. What do you mean by the American Tobacco
9	Company said that the Medical College of Virginia was,
10	quote, sold American?
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
12	THE WITNESS: That it was a place where the
13	American Tobacco Company had a sympathetic ear and
14	a cooperative relationship.
15	MR. GERAGHTY: Move to strike as -- move to
16	strike.
17	BY MR. ACOSTA:
18	Q. And have you seen in your research an
19	indication that the Medical College of Virginia and the
20	American Tobacco Company had a friendly relationship?
21	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
22	THE WITNESS: Yes, I have seen that in my
23	research.
24	BY MR. ACOSTA:
25	Q. And that the American -- College of Virginia
0454
1	had done research friendly to the American Tobacco
2	Company?
3	A. Yeah, the Medical College of Virginia had --
4	had done research in support of the American Tobacco
5	Company's --
6	Q. Now, in this --
7	A. -- efforts.
8	Q. -- in this big book, big book of — is it —
9	it's a book of studies, isn't it?
10	A. Yeah. I think it's best considered to be a
11	compendium.
12	Q. And in any of them, does it conclude that
13	cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer?
14	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
15	THE WITNESS: Not that I am aware of in that
16	book.
17	BY MR. ACOSTA:
18	Q. And so these studies were provided to the
19	surgeon general and cited by the surgeon general in the
20	'64 report, but did the surgeon general say that this
21	book helped the surgeon general determine that
22	cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer?
23	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form of the
24	question.
25	THE WITNESS: The surgeon general did not
0455
1	make that statement in the report or afterwards.
2	BY MR. ACOSTA:
3	Q. And I want to read to you something from page
4	526 of this book that was shown to you by Philip Morris
5	counsel.
6	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm going-
7	BY MR. ACOSTA:
8	Q. First of all -- first of all --
9	MR. GERAGHTY: Let me just object that it's
10	beyond the scope, because I didn't read anything
11	from the document myself, but go ahead.
12	BY MR. ACOSTA:
13	Q. Okay. First of all, I want to ask you this:
14	This book -- this book not only covers disease, it also
15	covers tobacco habituation; is that correct?
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. I can show you where it says that, if you
18	want.
19	A. No. I know the -- I'm familiar with that
20	book.
21	Q. Okay. Let's put this on the screen. And
22	this is under the section, Tobacco habituation. And it
23	says that smoking produces a craving for more when an
24	attempt is made to give it up is undoubted, wrote H.
25	Rolleston in 1926. But it can seldom be accurately
0456
1	described as overpowering, and to regard tobacco as a
2	drug of addiction may be all very well in the humorous
3	sense, but it is hardly accurate.
4	Now, is that statement in this book
5	consistent with what Quincy Adams wrote in that letter
6	that you were shown?
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: No. That's a different
9	position.
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Mr. Acosta, under the rule of
11	completeness, I would appreciate it if you would
12	read the paragraph that precedes the part you just
13	read that starts with the terms habituation and
14	addiction.
15	MR. ACOSTA: Okay.
16	The terms habituation and addiction, while
17	still used more or less indiscriminately by many
18	writers, have now a generally recognized
19	distinction among pharmacologists and those
20	concerned with the problem of addiction.
21	Habituation and addiction agree in embracing the
22	phenomenon of tolerance and dependence. But
23	dependence upon a habituating drug and withdrawal
24	symptoms following its discontinuance are held to
25	be psychic in nature, while an addicting drug is
0457
1	held to result in physical as well as psychic
2	dependence. And withdrawal leads to serious and
3	predictable physical as well as mental and psychic
4	derangements.
5	According to these definitions, then, the
6	habituation and addiction differ in a qualitative
7	sense, the test being the absence or presence of
8	physical dependence, which has been defined,
9	paren, Severs in Drill's textbook, Pharmacology in
10	Medicine, second edition, 1958 end paren, as a
11	state of, quote, biochemical, physiologic, and
12	possible morphologic adaptation of tissues to the
13	new chemical environment during repeated use so
14	that the presence of the drug is now required to
15	permit the cells of these tissues to function
16	normally.
17	MR. GERAGHTY: Thank you.
18	MR. ACOSTA: Did I read that right?
19	MR. GERAGHTY: You did.
20	MR. ACOSTA: Thank you.
21	THE WITNESS: I'm -- you had asked me about
22	the Adams letter. I'm going back to the Adams
23	letter just to make sure I have that in front of
24	me.
25	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We will change tapes then.
0458
1	Off the record for just a second.
2	(Brief recess was taken.)
3	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on.
4	BY MR. ACOSTA:
5	Q. Now, in 1964, did the surgeon general report
6	that cigarette smoking was addictive?
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: No. The surgeon general's
9	conclusion was that it was a habit.
10	BY MR. ACOSTA:
11	Q. Now, I believe the attorney for R.J. Reynolds
12	Tobacco Company asked you a question about plaintiffs
13	Exhibit 36, which is titled, The U.S. spends $5,000,000
14	yearly on the search for a safe cigarette. And I want
15	to ask you, first of all, is this the same article that
16	we discussed on your direct testimony in regarding the
17	statement of David Fishel, a spokesman for
18	R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, stating, We don't know
19	of anything that makes a cigarette unsafe?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. Okay. And then on the last column, it
22	indicates, Tobacco Institute denies report. Anne
23	Duffin, a spokesman for The Tobacco Institute, which
24	represents cigarette manufacturers, said cigarette
25	companies were not trying to develop safe cigarettes
0459
1	and disputed the premise of the question. That assumes
2	that cigarettes are not safe, she said. We don't know
3	that for sure. We don't know that cigarettes are
4	harmful.
5	Did the cigarette companies, including the
6	defendants in this case, in particular, R J. Reynolds
7	Tobacco Company, continue to maintain past 1985 that it
8	had not been determined that cigarettes were unsafe?
9	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: That was their position, and
11	they maintained that past 1985.
12	BY MR. ACOSTA:
13	Q. Mr. Koethe also showed you an exhibit which
14	says the Flintstones --1 will put that up, again, on
15	the screen -- The Flintstones, new half hour TV cartoon
16	for adults every Friday at 7:00 and 8:30 p.m.
17	Now, do you have children, Dr. Kyriakoudes?
18	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: I do.
20	BY MR. ACOSTA:
21	Q. And what are their ages?
22	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
23	THE WITNESS: Fifteen, 11, and 5.
24	BY MR. ACOSTA:
25	Q. Does your five-year-old stay up past seven
0460
1	o'clock on Friday night?
2	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
3	THE WITNESS: Yes.
4	BY MR. ACOSTA:
5	Q. Does your 11-year-old stay up past seven
6	o'clock on Friday night?
7	MR. KOETHE: Same objection.
8	THE WITNESS: Yes.
9	BY MR. ACOSTA:
10	Q. Does your five-year-old like dinosaurs?
11	A. Yes, very much so.
12	MR. KOETHE: Same objection.
13	BY MR. ACOSTA:
14	Q. Is it -- is it common knowledge that kids
15	like dinosaurs?
16	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form --
17	THE WITNESS: Mine does.
18	MR. KOETHE: -- and foundation.
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. Is there a dinosaur in this advertisement?
21	A. There is.
22	Q. Is it right next to a cute little picture of
23	Barney?
24	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
25	THE WITNESS: It is.
0461
1	MR. GERAGHTY: I think that's Fred, actually.
2	BY MR. ACOSTA:
3	Q. Oh, maybe that's Fred. Is that Fred? Is
4	that Fred? I think it is Fred.
5	MR. GERAGHTY: It's Fred.
6	THE WITNESS: Yeah, I think it is Fred.
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Should have colored in the --
8	MR. ACOSTA: And where --
9	MR. GERAGHTY: They should have colored in
10	the hair.
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. Yeah. The characters in the Flintstones were
13	Fred?
14	A. Fred Flintstone, Barney Rubble, and they each
15	had wives.
16	Q. Wilma?
17	A. Wilma and Rudolph.
18	Q. Rudolph?
19	A. No, not Rudolph. Sorry. I misspoke.
20	Q. Betty?
21	A. Betty. That's right.
22	Q. Okay. And was Bamm-Bamm in the Flintstones?
23	A. Yes.
24	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
25	THE WITNESS: Along with Pebbles.
0462
1	BY MR. ACOSTA:
2	Q. And Pebbles?
3	MR. KOETHE: Object to form.
4	THE WITNESS: Mr. Slate, his boss.
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. Did you ever see Fred and Barney saying,
7	Winston tastes good like a cigarette should --
8	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
9	BY MR. ACOSTA:
10	Q. -- as an adult?
11	A. As an adult, yes.
12	Q. Okay. You don't remember seeing it when you
13	were a kid?
14	A. No. I was born in 1963.
15	Q. So you were bom after this first aired?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. You were asked -- and I'm asking these
18	questions, for counsel's benefit, without waiving my
19	prior objections to the scope and the generic nature of
20	the deposition. And by "scope," I mean your questions
21	that I objected to were beyond the scope of direct.
22	I'm reserving that objection, but I am going to ask
23	questions just in case. Okay?
24	MR. GERAGHTY: And let me just say this. I
25	mean, I -- and I will try not to belabor the
0463
1	point. But the courts in a couple of
2	jurisdictions have agreed that these depositions
3	can be conducted in this manner. But in doing so,
4	none of them have said that the nomial mles of
5	admissibility change. So the notion that you can
6	reference the fact that this deposition is being
7	taken in multiple cases we certainly object to,
8	because I don't think it's relevant in one case
9	the fact that there are pending cases.
10	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. To the extent, though,
11	that you guys made reference to that through your
12	questions, I am going to respond to it.
13	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. You were asked some questions about the
16	letter to the Willow Groves (sic) School in Amherst,
17	New York?
18	A. I was, yes.
19	Q. And that letter was written by the public
20	relations manager for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in
21	1990?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. And it was in that letter that she said the
24	cigarette industry has been doing research for many,
25	many years and has been unable to find that cigarettes
0464
1	were a cause of disease?
2	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
3	MR. GERAGHTY: Object to the form.
4	BY MR. ACOSTA:
5	Q. Okay. Well, then we're going to have to find
6	the letter and ask it again. I'm not angry at you guys
7	for doing that; I just have to find the letter.
8	(Discussion off the record.)
9	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Would you like us to go
10	off the record?
11	MR. ACOSTA: No, no. I just have to turn my
12	mike off.
13	(Discussion off the record.)
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. Okay. All right. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I have
16	got a copy of that letter right here. I'm just going
17	to read this to you.
18	Despite all the research going on, the simple
19	and unfortunate fact is that the scientists do not know
20	the cause or causes of the chronic diseases reported to
21	be associated with smoking.
22	Was that the position of R.J. Reynolds
23	Tobacco Company back in 1990?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. And this letter written by Jo Sprach, was it
0465
1	similar to any other letters written by people at
2	R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to members of the public?
3	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: Yes, very similar.
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. Do you recall ever seeing others written by
7	Ms. Sprach?
8	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
9	THE WITNESS: I haven't seen others written
10	by her, but I have seen others written by other
11	officials with R J. Reynolds Company that say
12	essentially the same thing.
13	BY MR. ACOSTA:
14	Q. And are those consumer -- let me ask you,
15	were those -- were those letters written in terms of a
16	consumer response?
17	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: Yes.
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. Okay. Did consumers contact R.J. Reynolds to
21	ask them about their cigarettes?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. And did R.J. Reynolds often write them back?
24	A. Yes.
25	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.

1	BY MR. ACOSTA:
2	Q. And in writing them back, how common was it
3	for R.J. Reynolds to tell consumers things similar to
4	that said in Exhibit 38, this letter to the Willow
5	Groves school?
6	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
7	THE WITNESS: When a consumer would write a
8	letter inquiring about anything related to the
9	health of the product, the health of cigarettes or
10	the healthfulness or lack thereof, R.J. Reynolds
11	would respond by informing them that they
12	supported a research program and that cigarettes
13	have not been implicated in any disease.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. Did any of the cigarette company defendants
16	maintain telephone answering services to provide
17	consumers with information about their products via the
18	telephone?
19	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form. Beyond the
20	scope.
21	THE WITNESS: Yes. They maintained call
22	centers to handle similar inquiries, in this case,
23	ones where people would telephone in with
24	inquiries similar to that when people would write
25	in.
0467
1	BY MR. ACOSTA:
2	Q. Were those similar responses -- were the
3	responses similar to the -- that made in this letter of
4	1990 to the Willow Ridge school?
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection. Form.
6	THE WITNESS: Yes. Essentially the same
7	thing, that cigarettes were not harmful and that
8	the industry maintained a research effort.
9	BY MR. ACOSTA:
10	Q. Did Philip Morris do that?
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
12	THE WITNESS: Yes.
13	MR. GERAGHTY: Beyond the scope.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. Did R.J. Reynolds do that?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. You were asked questions about doing research
18	and keying in research about particular subjects such
19	as addiction.
20	Do you recall those questions?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. First of all, did you generally do research
23	based upon the issue that you were asked to state what
24	you -- the issue you were asked to give an opinion
25	about, the issue that you were to talk about?
0468
1	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
2	THE WITNESS: Yes.
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. And did you -- oftentimes, these attorneys
5	were paying you to -- did they pay you to do the
6	research?
7	A. Well, my practice is actually not to charge
8	for research, because I do that research on my own.
9	It's part of my normal research agenda.
10	Q. Did you do research on things that you didn't
11	think you needed to research?
12	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
13	THE WITNESS: No. I researched the things I
14	needed to research.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. If you had typed in to your computer and
17	attempted to research the word "addiction," what would
18	have been the result?
19	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection. Form. Calls for
20	speculation. He didn't do it.
21	THE WITNESS: The result would have been to
22	pull up many, many irrelevant things, a huge
23	number that were not central to the research
24	question I had identified.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0469
1	Q. Based upon your knowledge as a researcher, if
2	you had typed "addiction" into your computer, would you
3	have received information about addiction to other
4	things, such as cocaine or heroin or amphetamine?
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
6	THE WITNESS: Yes.
7	BY MR. ACOSTA:
8	Q. All right. If you had typed "addiction" in
9	to your computer, what would you -- what would the
10	result have been?
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
12	THE WITNESS: In the case where we're talking
13	about the newspaper keyword search, it would
14	generate a lot of irrelevant results regarding
15	addiction to opiates and other drugs.
16	BY MR. ACOSTA:
17	Q. When you did your research about cigarettes,
18	did you type in the word "cigarettes"?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Did that pull up addiction with respect to
21	cigarettes?
22	A. Yes.
23	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
24	THE WITNESS: When it was discussed with
25	cigarettes, yes.
0470
1	BY MR. ACOSTA:
2	Q. So -- and how safe would we be to understand
3	that every time an article about cigarettes also
4	mentioned addiction you would get the addiction
5	information with it?
6	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
7	THE WITNESS: I would get it by virtue --
8	yes, very safe, high, nearly certainly so.
9	BY MR. ACOSTA:
10	Q. So there wasn't a black hole in your research
11	with respect to addiction, was there?
12	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
13	THE WITNESS: No, with respect to cigarette
14	addiction.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. With respect to addiction, was there any
17	deficiency in the research you did?
18	A. No.
19	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
20	BY MR. ACOSTA:
21	Q. Now, you were asked about the numbers of
22	cigarettes sold and their sales record over the years
23	on direct testimony.
24	Do you remember that?
25	A. Yes.
0471
1	Q. And what was your testimony about how
2	cigarette sales existed in this country from 1954
3	toward the present? Do you remember the questions
4	about that?
5	A. I do.
6	Q. Okay. What was -- what was your -- what is
7	your knowledge about sales trends from 1954 forward?
8	MR. GERAGHTY: I object. It's beyond the
9	scope and repetitious of the direct exam.
10	THE WITNESS: In terms of total sales of
11	cigarettes during that period, the trend was
12	upward, peaking in 1982, whereupon it began to
13	decline in terms of total cigarettes consumed in
14	the United States.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. And during the 1960s, did at least one of the
17	defendants set sales records?
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
19	THE WITNESS: Yes.
20	BY MR. ACOSTA:
21	Q. Do you remember which defendant was setting
22	sales records in the 1960s?
23	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
24	THE WITNESS: Well, it would have been -
25	Philip Morris was setting records; R.J. Reynolds
0472
1	was also setting records.
2	BY MR. ACOSTA:
3	Q. Did their sales continue to increase in
4	number after the '64 surgeon general's report?
5	A. Yes. Total cigarette sales, the trend was
6	upward again, until peaking in 1982.
7	Q. And you were asked about prevalence on
8	cross-examination by the attorney for Philip Morris.
9	Do you remember that?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. And what is the difference between prevalence
12	and the total number of cigarettes sold?
13	A. Well, the total number of cigarettes sold is
14	just that. It is a number indicating the number of
15	cigarettes produced and sold in the United States
16	totally. Prevalence is the smoking rate, the portion
17	of the population that reports on surveys as having
18	been a regular smoker.
19	Q. Okay. Would that be per capita consumption?
20	A. Per capita consumption would be, yeah, the
21	third measure.
22	Q. Did the surgeon general provide a graph about
23	per capita consumption in his 1989 surgeon general's
24	report on smoking and health?
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection.
0473
1	THE WITNESS: Yes.
2	MR. GERAGHTY: Beyond the scope.
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. What's the difference between per capita
5	consumption and prevalence?
6	A. Per capita consumption is a fraction. You
7	put in the -- it's the ratio of total number of
8	cigarettes consumed in the United States divided by the
9	population, 18 years and older. And so it's a ratio or
10	fractional measure that takes into account total sales.
11	And, again, so that you understand the difference,
12	prevalence is derived from surveys. That data comes
13	from surveys, where they ask people if they smoke or
14	not.
15	Q. After the 1964 surgeon general's report, did
16	those surveys indicate that fewer people were reporting
17	that they were smoking?
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
19	THE WITNESS: Yes. Prevalence begins to --
20	well, it -- it's complicated. And none of these
21	measures is perfectly -- is perfect. Prevalence
22	does begin to slowly decline after the '64 surgeon
23	general's report. And then over time it begins to
24	decline at a more -- at a steeper curve downward.
25	Per -- per capita consumption declines briefly but
0474
1	then recovers, and that begins to decline in the
2	1970s.
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. Okay. You were shown this graph in the
5	January 11th, 1994, St. Petersburg Times, and I don't
6	remember the exhibit number.
7	Do you have that?
8	MR. GERAGHTY: I don't remember either.
9	THE WITNESS: It's Exhibit No. 16.
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Sixteen.
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. Okay. You were shown Exhibit No. 16?
13	A. It's in the pile.
14	Q. And it has a graph?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. Okay. And that graph -- that graph looks
17	like that --
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. -- right? I'm putting it on the screen so
20	that you can see it. And it shows a decline after
21	about 1966 toward 1991?
22	A. Yes, that's correct.
23	Q. Okay. And that's cigarette smokers as a
24	percentage of the population?
25	A. That's correct.
0475
1	Q. That's what it says there, right?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Now, from 1966 through 1991 there, did the
4	population increase in the United States?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. And if smokers stayed the same from 1966
7	through 1991 but the population increased, would you
8	expect to see the line go downward like this?
9	A. Well, you mean in terms of percentage?
10	Q. Yeah. Wouldn't the percentage of smokers go
11	down each year if the number of smokers stayed the same
12	but the population increased?
13	A. Yes. If the number of smokers stayed the
14	same, that's right.
15	Q. So -
16	A. I'm sorry. I missed --1 missed you the
17	first time.
18	Q. Would that explain why this graph goes down?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Now --
21	A. It also would explain why sales keep going
22	up, total sales.
23	Q. Now, let me show you another graph, which I'm
24	going to have to print out later. Okay? It's —
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Another graph?
0476
1	MR. ACOSTA: It was disclosed in my -- it was
2	disclosed in my disclosure materials as a surgeon
3	general graph. And I sent you all a copy of it.
4	And it was also used in Arnitz in all the other
5	cases.
6	MR. GERAGHTY: You don't have it here.
7	MR. ACOSTA: I don't have --1 do have a
8	little --1 have a paper copy that has some stuff
9	on it that I'm not going to use. So I just want
10	to use the cleaner version, and so I'm going to
11	have to print that off for you --
12	MR. GERAGHTY: I object.
13	MR. ACOSTA: -- later. Okay? Let's see.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. So I'm going to show you this,
16	Dr. Kyriakoudes, and ask you to identify it, if you've
17	ever seen it before.
18	A. Okay.
19	MR. GERAGHTY: Object. Beyond the scope of
20	the cross.
21	MR. ACOSTA: You can have a standing
22	objection as to —
23	THE WITNESS: Okay. Howard, did I give you
24	the notary's -- the court reporter's copy of the
25	story you just showed me?
0477
1	MR. ACOSTA: Wait a minute. What?
2	THE WITNESS: I'm just going to get the--1
3	took his paper, and I don't want to mess him up so
4	I'm going to be off the record.
5	(Discussion off the record.)
6	MR. GERAGHTY: This was sent to us, so my
7	objection is just beyond the scope.
8	MR. ACOSTA: Okay.
9	(Discussion off the record.)
10	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on.
11	MR. ACOSTA: April, do I have an exhibit
12	number that I can give them, a new one? Just give
13	me a new exhibit number.
14	MS. MCMANUS: Fifty-two.
15	MR. ACOSTA: Fifty-two. Okay. We will make
16	this Exhibit 52.
17	(Plaintiff Exhibit 52 was marked for
18	identification.)
19	MR. ACOSTA: Why am I touching this for. I
20	don't need it.
21	MR. GERAGHTY: This is 52?
22	MR. ACOSTA: Yeah, Exhibit 52.
23	BY MR. ACOSTA:
24	Q. And, Dr. Kyriakoudes, have you seen this
25	graph before?
0478
1	A. Yes, I have.
2	Q. And tell us what this graph is.
3	A. This is a graph of adult per capita cigarette
4	consumption from 1900 to 1990.
5	Q. And does it -- explain how that graph depicts
6	smoking in terms of what is a per capita basis just —
7	you mentioned earlier it was a ratio. But this is not
8	depicted as a ratio, at least from what I can tell. So
9	how does this work?
10	A. Okay. This is -- this is a measure of the
11	number of cigarettes consumed per person in the United
12	States over -- over the time period that it covers,
13	essentially the 20th century.
14	Q. And did the number of cigarettes per person
15	increase from 1900 to about 1974?
16	A. Yes. It -- per capita consumption, with some
17	dips as -- and declines as indicated on the graph,
18	pretty much straight up to 1963.
19	Q. Okay. Where would 1963 be, about right where
20	my arrow is there?
21	A. Yeah. Just move a little bit to the left
22	there on the peak.
23	Q. Okay. And then -- and then it dips from
24	where -- when to when next?
25	A. Well, in the subsequent couple of years, it
0479
1	dips and then recovers.
2	Q. And when you say "recovers," what do you
3	mean?
4	A. Increases.
5	Q. And what years did it go back up?
6	A. This would be in the later 1960s.
7	Q. Okay.
8	A. You know, '66, '67.
9	Q. Okay. And then is that during the time that
10	the caution label appeared?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. And you were shown the surgeon general's
13	report and then the caution label. And I think
14	yesterday I asked you if that caution label
15	contradicted the surgeon general's report.
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. Is this -- first of all, did it contradict
18	the surgeon general's report --
19	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
20	BY MR. ACOSTA:
21	Q. --the sense that the surgeon general said
22	does cause cancer and the caution label says may be
23	hazardous?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. Okay. Does this -- this graph here, from '66
0480
1	up through about close to 1970 there, demonstrate that
2	more people were smoking when the caution label went on
3	the package than they were right after the surgeon
4	general's report?
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
6	THE WITNESS: Yes. It demonstrates that per
7	capita consumption was increasing after a dip.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. Okay. And the dip being the surgeon
10	general's report and then the rise being the caution
11	label?
12	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
13	THE WITNESS: Yes.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. And then it has another dip after about 1970;
16	is that correct?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. And what do -- does that dip correspond to?
19	A. It corresponds to the period of the Fairness
20	Doctrine, which was the period where there was a
21	linkage between cigarette advertisements and then time
22	provided free to public health groups to present the
23	equal side on the issue of smoking and health.
24	Q. And then did the dip rise again?
25	A. Yes. After the broadcast ban was
0481
1	implemented, where the television commercials -- I'm
2	sorry, where you no longer have cigarette
3	advertisements on TV commercials.
4	Q. So let's see if we can simplify this. In
5	approximately 1970, what happened?
6	A. Well, in 1971, TV commercials for cigarettes
7	stopped appearing over the air waves.
8	Q. And when that happened, what happened to per
9	capita consumption?
10	A. It, again, increased.
11	Q. And why did it increase when cigarette
12	advertising was taken off television?
13	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form. The
14	scope objection is -- okay. We have a standing
15	objection.
16	MR. ACOSTA: (Indicates affirmatively).
17	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay. Go ahead. I'm sorry.
18	MR. ACOSTA: Let me ask--maybe the court
19	reporter can read that back.
20	MR. GERAGHTY: I'm sorry.
21	(A portion of the record was read by the
22	reporter.)
23	THE WITNESS: Well, the number of
24	anti-smoking messages that had been aired during
25	the period of the Fairness Doctrine plunged 80
0482
1	percent, because no longer was the free air time
2	provided under the Fairness Doctrine mechanism.
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. Okay. Now, the attorney for Philip Morris
5	asked you if these public service announcements by the
6	American Lung Association, American Heart Association,
7	and perhaps the American Cancer Society continued on
8	television after the cigarette companies withdrew their
9	television advertising.
10	Do you remember that?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. Now, what was the frequency -- first of all,
13	did -- strike that.
14	Before the cigarette companies took their
15	advertising off television, did those societies, the
16	cancer society, the heart society, or associations, the
17	American Cancer -- let me strike that. That's all
18	garbage. Let me start over again.
19	Before the cigarette companies took their
20	advertising off of television, did the American Cancer
21	Society and the American Lung Association and the
22	American Heart Association have to pay for television
23	time to run their public service announcements?
24	A. No.
25	Q. After the cigarette companies took their
0483
1	television ad -- ads -- advertising for cigarettes off
2	the air, did those same associations, cancer, heart,
3	lung, have to pay for public service announcements, is
4	that the point?
5	A. Yes. They had to pay or occasionally got
6	available to them free air time, usually late at night
7	and unfilled spaces.
8	Q. And, for example, the one -- at least one or
9	two of the public service announcements that were shown
10	to you by the attorney for Philip Morris, did those
11	occur after the cigarette companies took their
12	advertising off television?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. For example, the Yul Brynner one was in the
15	mid-1980s?
16	A. That would be an example, yes.
17	Q. And what was the frequency of public service
18	announcements in that vein before the cigarette
19	companies took their advertising off the air?
20	A. Yeah. And, again, we're talking about the
21	period under the Fairness Doctrine --
22	Q. Okay.
23	A. -- so that applies to all these answers.
24	Q. Compare -- compare -- let me strike that.
25	Compare the number or frequency of service
0484
1	announcements say cigarette smoking was harmful before
2	the cigarette companies took their advertising off the
3	air with the number that occurred after they took their
4	cigarette advertising off the air?
5	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
6	THE WITNESS: First, during the Fairness
7	Doctrine regimen or period, for every three or
8	four cigarette advertisements that were aired on
9	television, space was provided for one public
10	service announcement. So if you showed three,
11	sometimes four cigarette ads, you had to put up a
12	public service announcement for free. That number
13	of public service advertisements, once the
14	Fairness Doctrine mechanism was disrupted, when
15	the industry stopped advertising on television,
16	the number of public service announcements plunged
17	80 percent.
18	BY MR. ACOSTA:
19	Q. And what was the reason that they plunged to
20	20 percent?
21	A. Because there was no longer a mechanism that
22	provided free air time for the public service
23	announcements as -- as had been existing under the
24	Fairness Doctrine, period.
25	Q. And have you seen credible information in
0485
1	your investigation of the history of this event
2	indicating that at least one of the reasons that
3	cigarette companies took their advertising off the air
4	was to cause public service announcements to plunge?
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
6	MR. KOETHE: Objection to the form.
7	THE WITNESS: Yes.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. Now, what I would like to do is ask the
10	cameraman if he could just get a shot of what's on the
11	screen so we can preserve that for everyone, if you
12	don't mind, and then we will know what Exhibit 52 is.
13	And I will get you a copy and get the court reporter a
14	copy of it after we finish. Okay? Just let me know?
15	MR. GERAGHTY: I mean, I trust you. You
16	don't need to -- okay. He's doing it already.
17	MR. ACOSTA: Yeah.
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay. I thought he was going
19	to have to move the camera, and I was going to say
20	let's not bother.
21	MR. ACOSTA: It's easy.
22	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We've got it.
23	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. Let's go back on the
24	witness.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0486
1	Q. Now, I want to ask you, Dr. Kyriakoudes,
2	before the cigarette companies took their advertising
3	off the air in the very early 1970s, how much were they
4	spending on advertising, say, during the year or two
5	before?
6	MR. GERAGHTY: Beyond the scope.
7	THE WITNESS: They were spending
8	approximately in 1970 about $361,000,000 a year on
9	advertising.
10	BY MR. ACOSTA:
11	Q. And then after the Fairness Doctrine, after
12	they took their television ads off the air, after they
13	took their ads off of television, how much were they
14	spending on advertising in America?
15	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
16	THE WITNESS: Yeah. By, say, 1975, just, you
17	know, a few years after that, they were spending
18	just under $500,000,000 a year on advertising.
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. Did they save any money by taking their
21	television advertising off the air?
22	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
23	THE WITNESS: No, they didn't. They shifted
24	those resources to other advertising outlets.

1	Q. Have you seen information indicating whether
2	or not the cigarette companies felt that their
3	advertising was effective?
4	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
5	THE WITNESS: Yes.
6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. And did that begin back in -- you mentioned
8	that there were advertising statements made in the
9	annual reports of some of the companies, on direct
10	testimony.
11	Do you remember when the first one of those
12	was that you testified about yesterday?
13	A. Yes, I do. Philip Morris in 1953.
14	Q. And did advertising budgets increase from
15	1953 up through the present?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. Have they increased every year?
18	A. Up--the data I have looked at goes to 2001.
19	And, yes, overall the industry has increased its
20	advertising expenditures.
21	MR. GERAGHTY: I object and move to strike.
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. Have you -- did you -- have you read their
24	annual reports, the company's annual reports?
25	A. Yes, I have.
0488
1	Q. Did you ever see anything in an annual report
2	indicating that a cigarette company did not think its
3	advertising was effective?
4	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.
5	THE WITNESS: No, I haven't seen anything in
6	an annual report indicating that their advertising
7	didn't work.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. Did you see anything that indicated that
10	their advertising did work?
11	A. Yes.
12	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
13	THE WITNESS: Yes. In the annual reports and
14	in other documents, the industry touted the
15	success of its advertising.
16	BY MR. ACOSTA:
17	Q. You were asked in cross-examination whether
18	the warning -- or, actually, I think you were asked if
19	the warning that went on in 1966 was unprecedented.
20	Do you remember that?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Was it a warning, or was it a caution?
23	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
24	THE WITNESS: Well, it was -
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0489
I	Q. Well, let me ask you this: Was it --
2	MR. GERAGHTY: Unqualified.
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. — was it a warning?
5	A. Well, it didn't use the word "warning" in the
6	text.
7	Q. What word did it use?
8	A. Caution.
9	Q. Okay.
10	A. And it was referred to as a caution label by,
II	for example, people within the tobacco industry.
12	Q. All right. And then the warning went on in
13	1970?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. Now, in either 1966, when the caution label
16	went on the package, or in 1970, when the warning label
17	went on the package, was that unprecedented in consumer
18	products?
19	A. No.
20	Q. You were asked if there was any other
21	consumer product that carried a warning back, say,
22	during that time frame between 1966 and 1970.
23	Do you recall that?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. And you said that you knew that there were
0490
1	some?
2	A. That's right.
3	Q. Do you know what saccharin is?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. And during that time frame, did the
6	government require the makers and sellers of saccharin
7	to have a warning?
8	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection. Form.
9	THE WITNESS: Yes, they did.
10	BY MR. ACOSTA:
11	Q. And had saccharin been used for many years by
12	people to sweeten their coffee and other things?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. It was a sweetener, right?
15	A. An artificial sweetener that had no calories.
16	Q. And was it widely used?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Was it used -- compare its use with
19	cigarettes.
20	MR. GERAGHTY: Beyond the scope and no
21	qualification.
22	THE WITNESS: Certainly, you know, a wide --
23	in almost everybody's home.
24	BY MR. ACOSTA:
25	Q. Saccharin was just about in everybody's house
0491
1	in America, wasn't it?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And saccharin was given a warning that it
4	might cause cancer, in the late 1960s?
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form. Counsel is
6	testifying.
7	BY MR. ACOSTA:
8	Q. Let me ask you, What kind of a warning was
9	required to be put on a saccharin bottle or package?
10	A. Yes. I don't remember the exact year that
11	the warning on -- that the warnings went on on
12	saccharin. But there was a concern about the health
13	effects of saccharin, and a warning went on.
14	Q. Okay. Can you give us some estimate based on
15	your investigation and research as to how much money
16	the cigarette industry spent denying that smoking was
17	harmful?
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form and
19	beyond the scope.
20	THE WITNESS: Well, that would be - that
21	would involve the total budget for the period of
22	the -- if we start with the onset of the TIRC,
23	carry that through The Tobacco Institute up until
24	approximately 2000 -- or 2000 -- it would be many
25	hundreds of millions of dollars, indeed, very
0492
1	likely into the billions of dollars once you
2	tabulated all the costs.
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. And was their effort to deny the idea that
5	cigarette smoking was harmful, was their effort renewed
6	year after year?
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: Yes.
9	BY MR. ACOSTA:
10	Q. Now, you were asked some questions about a
11	man named Cuyler Hammond. Do you remember that?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. And he was a doctor, right?
14	A. Yes. And a prominent researcher.
15	Q. And he was a prominent researcher in the
16	1950s and 1960s?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. And you were asked whether he appeared, I
19	believe, on the -- the show "Need To Know" that was
20	made by The Tobacco Institute.
21	Do you remember that?
22	A. Yes, I remember that.
23	Q. He was also in the -- excuse me. Let me
24	strike that.
25	Did Dr. Cuyler Hammond also appear on the
0493
1	Harry Reasoner news show that was made right after the
2	surgeon general's warning came out in 1964?
3	A. He was on the news show that came out after
4	the announcement of the surgeon general's
5	report results, yes.
6	Q. And in that Harry Reasoner news show, was
7	Cuyler -- Cuyler Hammond interviewed by the interviewer
8	on the air on the show?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And was he considered a very prominent
11	cigarette cancer researcher of the time?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. And did he announce on the Harry Reasoner
14	show that he had been a smoker?
15	A. Yes. He indicated that he had in the past
16	been a smoker and had, as a result of his own research,
17	switched to a pipe.
18	Q. And did he indicate that he had just -- just
19	switched to a pipe?
20	A. He indicated that he had switched to a pipe,
21	yes.
22	MR. ACOSTA: And then I need --1 need from
23	defense counsel a copy of that transcript.
24	Remember, I --1 don't --1 don't remember you
25	giving that to me. Is this marked the same way as
0494
1	the one you showed him?
2	MR. GERAGHTY: I don't know. I don't think
3	so. I think that was --
4	MR. ACOSTA: I need it.
5	MR. GERAGHTY: -- my personal copy.
6	MR. ACOSTA: Yeah. But that's -- you showed
7	him the one that had the -- the yellow -- the
8	orange on it. And I need that to find the place,
9	if you don't mind.
10	MR. GERAGHTY: This is--1 need to give this
11	back to the court reporter, because this is the
12	marked copy.
13	MR. ACOSTA: That's -- that's the marked
14	copy?
15	THE WITNESS: Yeah.
16	MR. GERAGHTY: Well, it's marked as an
17	exhibit, but it doesn't have any markings.
18	MR. ACOSTA: Doesn't have the markings on it?
19	MR. GERAGHTY: I marked as an exhibit one
20	that did not have my highlighting on it.
21	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. Hang on. Let me --
22	THE WITNESS: It's page 9.
23	MR. GERAGHTY: You know what--I'm sorry.
24	THE WITNESS: Off the record, page 9.
25	MR. GERAGHTY: And, actually, let me just
0495
1	correct one thing. We did not mark this as an
2	exhibit. We had the sticker on there. You were
3	marking it for ID.
4	MR. ACOSTA: Yes.
5	MR. GERAGHTY: You asked that it be marked
6	for ID.
7	MR. ACOSTA: Right.
8	MR. GERAGHTY: So we should probably put
9	another number on there.
10	THE WITNESS: And, Howard, off the record, it
11	was page 9 that he showed me.
12	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. We can put -- do you want
13	to mark it as a joint exhibit, if you want. I
14	don't care.
15	MR. GERAGHTY: No. I didn't-
16	MR. ACOSTA: Or I can mark it No. 53.
17	MS. FOOS: Yeah, that will be fine.
18	MR. GERAGHTY: You can name it whatever you
19	want to name it.
20	MR. ACOSTA: Yeah. We will make it
21	Plaintiffs Exhibit 53.
22	(Plaintiff Exhibit 53 was marked for
23	identification.)
24	BY MR. ACOSTA:
25	Q. Okay. Doctor, you were shown Plaintiffs
0496
1	Exhibit 53 earlier by defense counsel for Philip
2	Morris?
3	MR. GERAGHTY: And I'm going to object to him
4	reading from it —
5	THE WITNESS: That's correct.
6	MR. GERAGHTY: -- because I didn't read from
7	it; I just asked him a question. So I think this
8	is beyond the scope if you read from the document,
9	but go ahead.
10	BY MR. ACOSTA:
11	Q. Okay. I believe you were asked something to
12	the effect that -- that Cuyler Hammond was -- appeared
13	on the "Need To Know"?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And that appears at pages 8 and 9 of the
16	document?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. And then, actually, throughout 9 and then
19	down to 10?
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. And then does it indicate, in the middle of
22	page 10, that the narrator criticized Dr. Hammond's
23	method of determining that cigarette smoking was a
24	cause of disease?
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Object to the form of the
0497
1	question.
2	THE WITNESS: Yes. The narrator levels
3	criticisms at Hammond's work.
4	MR. GERAGHTY: Why don't you just read it if
5	you -- you know, rather than him offer opinions,
6	read what Dr. Hammond said.
7	MR. ACOSTA: Well, just a minute ago you told
8	me you objected to me reading it.
9	MR. GERAGHTY: Well, I think to have him -
10	well, fair enough. I will withdraw it, but I
11	object to the form of the question.
12	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. I'll read it, anyway,
13	whether you object or not. How is that?
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. Okay. Does it indicate, after Cuyler Hammond
16	explained his statistical method, that the narrator of
17	the show states, What has not been generally known is
18	that many highly respected members of the scientific
19	community from the very first took vigorous exception
20	to the statistical methods and how the numbers were
21	used?
22	Do you understand that to be a criticism of
23	the methods that Cuyler Hammond and other physicians
24	had used to determine that smoking was a cause of
25	cancer and other diseases?
0498
1	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: Yes.
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. In fact --
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Could - go ahead. I was
6	going to ask you under the rule of completeness to
7	read the last paragraph of what Dr. Hammond
8	actually said. It's right above that.
9	MR. ACOSTA: I don't --1 don't think that
10	has -- is not -- have anything to do with it.
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Well, if you're-
12	MR. ACOSTA: I'm going to let you read it if
13	you want to, but I'm going to object to it because
14	I don't think it has anything to do with what we
15	just talked about. I will tell you what. I will
16	read the whole -- the whole thing, starting with
17	the narrator on page 8.
18	Cancer of the liver is frequently reported
19	among the Chinese. Egyptians suffer an unusually
20	high rate of cancer of the bladder. Japan has a
21	low incidence of cancers generally but is second
22	highest in the world in stomach cancers among both
23	men and women, and so on.
24	In recent years, no single type of education
25	has provoked more questions, more controversy than
0499
1	cancer of the lung. Public awareness of this
2	disease was intensified when a special report to
3	the U.S. surgeon general on smoking and health was
4	released to the press in early 1964. That report
5	showed, among other things, an apparent
6	statistical association between smoking and lung
7	cancer. In subsequent years, it would lead to the
8	warning on each pack of cigarettes that they may
9	be hazardous to health. Later, this warning would
10	be more strongly worded.
11	One of the largest population surveys which
12	helped produce these statistics was comprised of
13	data gathered by some 60,000 nonprofessional
14	volunteers for the American Cancer Society. They
15	selected more than a million men and women over
16	the age of 30 to fill out questionnaires about
17	their health, past illnesses, smoking, and other
18	aspects of living.
19	The material was then turned over to
20	Dr. E. Cuyler Hammond, the chief statistician for
21	the American Cancer Society and his colleagues.
22	Their report would be become known popularly as
23	the Hammond Survey.
24	In an interview with an Australian group,
25	Dr. Hammond explained one important way the
0500
1	statistics were used.
2	Dr. Hammond, that's his -- it now switches to
3	Dr. Hammond.
4	DR. HAMMOND: And I had our computer do a
5	matching problem. I, for this analysis, took the
6	records of men who had never smoked regularly and
7	the records of men who smoked 20 or more
8	cigarettes a day. Then I had the computer take
9	the first man who never smoked regularly and
10	looked through all the files for a smoker who was
11	as much like him as possible. He had to be the
12	same age. He had to be within an inch of the same
13	height. If one was a teetotaler, that is, didn't
14	drink alcohol, the other had to be a teetotaler.
15	They had to be the same race, the same religion.
16	They had to live in a city of the same size or
17	live on a farm. They had to live -- they had to
18	have the same occupational exposures, if any, to
19	dust, fumes, and vapors. And the computer managed
20	to find about 39,000 pairs of men, one smoker,
21	another nonsmoker, who were alike in all of these
22	other things.
23	At the end of 44 months, there were
24	600-and-some deaths in the nonsmokers, and
25	1,300-and-some deaths in the smokers, about 15 or
0501
1	20 times as many smokers as nonsmokers had died of
2	lung cancer.
3	The narrator again.
4	THE NARRATOR: What has not been generally
5	known is that many highly respected members of the
6	scientific community from the very first took
7	vigorous exception to the statistical methods and
8	how the numbers were used.
9	For example, the people surveyed by the
10	American Cancer Society volunteers were from
11	100--1,121 countries in 25 different states with
12	the greatest number from the industrial northeast
13	and Midwest and virtually none from the mountain
14	states, this despite a possible connection between
15	susceptibility to cancer and the environment one
16	lives in.
17	Then it goes on with Dr. Ober. And this is
18	why I wanted the whole thing played as a rule of
19	completeness issue. But I want to -- if I have
20	read that correctly and you don't want me to read
21	anything else right at the moment, I will go back
22	to my questions.
23	MR. GERAGHTY: No, I don't want you to read
24	anything further.
25	MR. ACOSTA: Okay.
0502
1	MR. GERAGHTY: I mean, I object, but it's
2	fine.
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. Okay. And, Dr. Kyriakoudes, what was the
5	purpose of the entire movie made by The Tobacco
6	Institute titled "Need To Know" in 1972?
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: The purpose of the film was to
9	persuade people that the science implicating
10	cigarette with disease was flawed, invalid,
11	untrue, and that cigarettes were safe.
12	BY MR. ACOSTA:
13	Q. Okay. And was the appearance of -- was the
14	appearance of Dr. Cuyler Hammond on that show for the
15	purpose of criticizing his work?
16	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
17	THE WITNESS: That's correct.
18	BY MR. ACOSTA:
19	Q. Okay. Let me ask it a different way. What
20	was the purpose of Dr. Cuyler Hammond's appearance on
21	the "Need To Know" show?
22	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form. Lack
23	of foundation.
24	THE WITNESS: It was a setup to discredit his
25	work. He announced --
0503
1	MR. KOETHE: Move to strike.
2	THE WITNESS: He announced his methods and
3	then subsequently criticized by a number of the
4	experts that had been previously introduced on the
5	program.
6	MR. KOETHE: Move to strike.
7	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We can change the tapes
8	while you --
9	MR. ACOSTA: You want to change them now?
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Yeah.
11	MR. ACOSTA: Yeah. Okay. That's good.
12	(Brief recess was taken.)
13	BY MR. ACOSTA:
14	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you were shown a couple
15	other little video clips that were portions of the same
16	shows or TV shows that I showed you earlier.
17	Do you remember those?
18	A. Which shows in particular?
19	Q. Yeah. The first was "See It Now."
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. Okay. And you saw a short video clip from --
22	that I asked you to look at involving Dr. DuPuis. Do
23	you remember that?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. And then on cross-examination, counsel for
0504
1	Philip Morris asked you to look at another part of that
2	show involving one of the scientists that had indicated
3	that smoking was a cause of cancer.
4	Do you remember that?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. In that show -- first of all, who was the --
7	do you remember who the narrator was of "See It Now"?
8	A. Edward R. Murrow.
9	Q. And was Edward R. Murrow a smoker?
10	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: Yes, he was a very heavy
12	smoker.
13	BY MR. ACOSTA:
14	Q. And he -- and did he smoke on television?
15	A. Yes.
16	MR. KOETHE: Same objection.
17	BY MR. ACOSTA:
18	Q. And it was his show?
19	A. Yes, it was his show.
20	Q. And he had -- who did he have appear on "See
21	It Now" in the same show that had the clips that you
22	saw with Dr. DuPuis and --1 don't remember if it was
23	Dr. Hammond or Dr. --1 can't think of his name right
24	now, one of the others doctors.
25	A. Yeah. Cuyler Hammond, Ernst Wynder --
0505
1	Q. Wynder.
2	A. -- and other -- other doctors as well.
3	Q. Okay. Now, in that show, did Edward R.
4	Murrow present the side of the cigarette industry with
5	respect to whether they thought cigarette smoking
6	caused cancer?
7	A. Yes, he did.
8	Q. And what did the industry say?
9	A. Well, as we saw on the first day, the
10	industry made the statements that they took the
11	public's health as a paramount responsibility and that
12	there was nothing in cigarettes that was harmful.
13	Q. And then did the American -- did a spokesman
14	for the American Medical Association also appear on
15	that show?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. Was it the president of the American Medical
18	Association?
19	A. Yes, president of the AMA.
20	Q. And did -- what position did the American --
21	the president of the American Medical Association take
22	with respect to the idea that smoking caused lung
23	cancer?
24	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
25	THE WITNESS: As I recall, his position was
0506
1	that it was still undecided, that more research
2	needed to be done, that it was premature to
3	implicate cigarettes.
4	BY MR. ACOSTA:
5	Q. And how about -- was there a Dr. Huber on
6	that show?
7	A. Yes. From the National Cancer Institute.
8	Q. And what position did Dr. Huber take about
9	smoking and lung cancer?
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: That other environmental causes
12	were just as likely to be implicated in this and
13	that it was too soon to tell whether cigarettes
14	were the cause of lung cancer.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. What was the balance of the show in terms of
17	those that thought that smoking caused lung cancer and
18	those that didn't?
19	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: It was at least 50/50, indeed,
21	leaning a bit more to the industry's side.
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. And in addition to Dr. DuPuis, did the
24	industry have Dr. Hockett and Dr. Clarence Cook Little
25	appear?
0507
1	A. That's right.
2	Q. And then you were shown a clip of -- from the
3	Harry Reasoner Show. And I believe you mentioned when
4	asked that something was missing from the clip that
5	ended the show --
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. — that counsel for Philip Morris didn't show
8	you the whole thing?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. And it had -- did it have something to do
11	with Harry Reasoner referring to the cigarette as a
12	friend?
13	A. Yes. That's -- this is the ending of the
14	program. And it's, in fact, a very poignant moment
15	where he talks about how the cigarette is like a friend
16	that lets you down: You keep giving it another chance
17	and another chance.
18	Q. And during that time frame, did the cigarette
19	industry go from filters to more filters than lights
20	and ultra lights cigarettes to give people another
21	chance?
22	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: Yes. That was the transition
24	that was occurring in the market.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0508
1	Q. Let me ask you this: From 1954 through 2000,
2	did the cigarette industry provide people with
3	additional chances for safety?
4	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
5	THE WITNESS: No, not real chances, no.
6	BY MR. ACOSTA:
7	Q. When you say "not real chances," did they --
8	did they provide messages that were intended to make
9	people think that they were getting a chance at safety?
10	A. Yes.
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
12	THE WITNESS: Yes.
13	BY MR. ACOSTA:
14	Q. How did they do that?
15	MR. KOETHE: Objection.
16	THE WITNESS: Through their disinformation
17	campaign and propaganda that we've talked about
18	extensively, through changing the types of
19	cigarettes that they were offering to the public,
20	putting filters on, expressly stating and implying
21	that filters would or could remove what might be
22	harmful in cigarette smoke, and then by persuading
23	them that low nicotine, low tar, so-called lights
24	and ultra lights -- and now we're talking the
25	mid-sixties onward, were, in fact, a safer form of
0509
I	cigarette, and --
2	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form. Move
3	to strike.
4	BY MR. ACOSTA:
5	Q. Now, when you said -- you said
6	disinformation, what did you mean by that? What were
7	the cigarette companies doing?
8	A. Well, they were engaging in the things we've
9	been talking about, challenging the science, creating
10	doubt in the mind of the public as to the validity of
II	the science, implicating cigarettes with disease by
12	sponsoring their own research program, by challenging
13	research reports, as we have seen, by sponsoring movies
14	like the "Smoking and Health," the "Need To Know," but
15	also their advertisements, which never informed the
16	public of the dangers of smoking to health.
17	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form of the
18	question and move to strike.
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. Now, earlier in the cross-examination, you
21	were shown a couple of newspaper articles. I believe
22	they were Exhibits 5 and 6.
23	Do you have those up there?
24	A. Yes. No. 5 -
25	Q. Okay.
0510
1	A. -- and No. 6.
2	Q. And I believe that in Exhibit No. 5 -- or
3	with reference to Exhibit No. 5, you were asked some
4	questions by the attorney for Philip Morris.
5	Do you remember that?
6	A. Yes, I remember.
7	Q. And one of the questions that you were asked
8	had something to do with whether or not The Tobacco
9	Institute had made any rebuttals to the idea that
10	cigarettes were a cause of lung cancer.
11	Do you remember that?
12	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: Yes.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. Now, this article was dated, when, 1952?
16	A. Yes, 1952.
17	Q. Was The Tobacco Institute in existence in
18	1952?
19	A. No, it was not, nor was the TIRC.
20	Q. Nor was the agreement in the Frank Statement?
21	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
22	MR. KOETHE: Objection to the form.
23	BY MR. ACOSTA:
24	Q. Was the agreement in the Frank Statement in
25	existence in 1952?
0511
1	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: No. That wouldn't come until
3	January of 1954.
4	BY MR. ACOSTA:
5	Q. In terms of the response that the cigarette
6	company defendants made in the Frank Statement, stating
7	cigarette smoking was not injurious to your health, did
8	that -- that response came on the heels of this 1952
9	article?
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry, can you state the
12	question again? I --
13	BY MR. ACOSTA:
14	Q. Did the response of the cigarette industry
15	come on the heels of newspaper articles such as this in
16	The Miami Herald in 1952, Study Links Lung Cancer to
17	Smoking?
18	A. Well, studies like this that appeared later
19	in 1953 did spark the -- yes, did spark the reaction by
20	the industry.
21	Q. And then you were asked questions about
22	Exhibit No. 6?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. And Exhibit No. 6 was in the news on June
25	22nd, 1954?
0512
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. Again, I believe you were asked whether The
3	Tobacco Institute had responded to any of the charges
4	in Exhibit 6.
5	Do you remember that?
6	A. Yes.
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. Was The Tobacco Institute in existence in
10	1954?
11	A. No. The Tobacco Institute wouldn't have come
12	about until 1958.
13	Q. Now, in Exhibit No. 6, this
14	St. Petersburg Times article of June 22nd, 1954, on
15	the -- it looks like on the third page under cause and
16	effect, the second paragraph states, There had been
17	numerous reports previously linking cigarettes with an
18	alarming rise in lung cancer. Numerous experts have
19	said they felt there has been no proof of such a link.
20	Atmospheric pollution also has been suspected as a
21	cause.
22	Do you see that?
23	A. I see that.
24	Q. Okay. At that --in that time frame, back in
25	1954, did the cigarette industry have any planned
0513
1	relationships with news writers in the news media
2	regarding what -- what would be in stories about
3	smoking and health?
4	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
5	THE WITNESS: Yes, they-
6	MR. KOETHE: Lack of foundation.
7	THE WITNESS: Yes, they did.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. Okay. And how did that come about, that they
10	would have a relationship with reporters regarding
11	smoking and health?
12	A. Through the work of the Hill & Knowlton
13	public relations agency, which was hired by the
14	industry to act on its behalf to influence press
15	coverage on the issue of smoking and health.
16	Q. How much information have you reviewed
17	indicating that the cigarette industry through its
18	public relations firm, Hill & Knowlton, influenced what
19	was in news stories?
20	A. I have read --
21	MR. KOETHE: Beyond the scope. Object to the
22	form.
23	THE WITNESS: Well, fortunately, we - I have
24	read a terrific amount of information on this,
25	including primary documents. We have the records
0514
1	of the Hill & Knowlton -- the head of the
2	Hill & Knowlton company, John Hill, who donated
3	those to an archive for preservation.
4	BY MR. ACOSTA:
5	Q. And have you -- you've read those documents?
6	A. I have.
7	Q. And what do those documents reveal about the
8	intentions of the cigarette company and news stories on
9	smoking and health?
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
11	THE WITNESS: That on behalf of the cigarette
12	manufacturers, the defendants in this case, the
13	Hill & Knowlton agency mounted a broad and
14	aggressive program of dealing behind the scenes
15	with editors, reporters, particularly science and
16	health editors and reporters, to get their message
17	out, to make sure that news stories, when they
18	addressed the question of smoking and health, got
19	the message of the tobacco industry out there,
20	that the science of unconcern, that cigarettes
21	were safe, that it was unproven, that there were
22	other causes, be they genetic, constitutional --
23	an old term referring to something in one's
24	body -- caused by pollution or some other factor.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0515
1	Q. Did Hill & Knowlton --
2	MR. KOETHE: Move to strike. I'd like a
3	continuing objection to this line of questioning
4	on Hill & Knowlton as beyond the scope of cross.
5	Acceptable?
6	MR. ACOSTA: Yeah, you can have a continuing
7	objection.
8	MR. KOETHE: Okay.
9	BY MR. ACOSTA:
10	Q. Did Hill & Knowlton in their work for the
11	cigarette company defendants, with the exception of
12	Liggett at this time, cause any, favorable to the
13	industry, articles to be published on smoking and
14	health?
15	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
16	THE WITNESS: Yes.
17	BY MR. ACOSTA:
18	Q. And can you tell us more about that?
19	A. Well, there are -- there are many cases.
20	There are cases of them going to magazines which have
21	already set their stories in type and making -- and
22	making changes favorable to the industry once the
23	stories had been set in type. Donald Cooley, science
24	writer, wrote -- without identifying himself as such,
25	wrote articles that were favorable to the industry at
0516
1	the behest of the Hill & Knowlton company. They
2	actually sponsored books which they didn't identify as
3	being sponsored by the tobacco industry's publicity
4	effort. So, yes, broad based.
5	They met with the editors of Life magazine.
6	They met with Edward R. Murrow and Fred Friendly --
7	Fred Friendly was Edward R. Murrow's producer -- to
8	make sure that they got a favorable hearing on "See It
9	Now." So it's a very broad-based effort that's very
10	well-documented.
11	Q. Did the cigarette company defendants, other
12	than Liggett at this time, disclose to the public,
13	reveal to the public that they were attempting to
14	influence or influencing stories about smoking and
15	health in their favor?
16	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
17	THE WITNESS: No, they didn't. And, in fact,
18	the reports in which this is documented are all
19	listed as confidential.
20	BY MR. ACOSTA:
21	Q. What do you mean that the reports are listed
22	as confidential?
23	A. Secret.
24	MR. GERAGHTY: Object to the form.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0517
1	Q. Well, how did you find out about them?
2	MR. GERAGHTY: Move to strike.
3	THE WITNESS: I found out about them because
4	John Hill, head of the company, kept these
5	documents in his personal files in his workplace
6	and then, when he retired, donated them to an
7	archive, the University of Wisconsin, what's
8	called the Wisconsin Historical Society, and
9	dictated that they be held closed, that is,
10	unavailable to anybody, secret, for 20 years --1
11	believe it's 20 years after his death. And so
12	they were opened up around 1989 or 1990, give or
13	take a year or two.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. Do you know what the term "fake" means?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. Were some of these stories fake?
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: Yes. Some of them were fake,
20	not real, not true, lies.
21	MR. GERAGHTY: Move to strike.
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. Were the stories lies?
24	A. Yes.
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
0518
1	BY MR. ACOSTA:
2	Q. Now, I want to ask you some questions about
3	your research. You were questioned about research by
4	the attorney for Philip Morris.
5	Do you remember that?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Do you remember him asking you about doing
8	primary research by looking up reports and stories
9	authored or about a number of different scientists?
10	A. This would have been yesterday afternoon?
11	Q. I think so.
12	A. Yes, yes, I remember that line of
13	questioning.
14	Q. And, for example, did he ask you if you had
15	ever put the name Ochsner or Wynder or one of those
16	people into your computer and then attempted to do
17	research to find all the stories that contained the
18	name in your research for your work as a historian
19	regarding smoking and health?
20	A. Yes, I recall that question. It was actually
21	today, yes.
22	Q. If you had typed in, for example, the name of
23	Alton Ochsner -- first of all, who is Alton Ochsner?
24	A. He was a surgeon at the Tulane University
25	School of Medicine.
0519
1	Q. And did he have something to do with smoking
2	and health stories back in the 1940s and, perhaps,
3	early 1950s?
4	A. Yes. He was an early medical doctor who was
5	getting the word out that smoking was deadly. Among a
6	very varied career, this was one of the things that he
7	did.
8	Q. And if you had typed in his name, what kind
9	of information are you sure would have been revealed in
10	your research engines, you know, to do research on
11	smoking and health?
12	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: Well, you know, anything he did
14	in relation to cigarettes, because the word
15	cigarettes would have been in there, but also his
16	extensive other activities. I mean, among other
17	things, he founded a huge hospital system in the
18	New Orleans area and was active on many fronts and
19	in a very busy career.
20	BY MR. ACOSTA:
21	Q. Would it have hindered your research to type
22	in the name Ochsner because it would result in so many
23	hits in the research engine, that you would have a
24	difficult time sorting out those stories and references
25	to cigarettes from all the other references?
0520
1	A. Yes. I mean, I would have gotten a lot of
2	needless information to wade through.
3	Q. Would the same have been true for all the
4	other famous doctors?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. Did you --
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Object -- object and move to
8	strike.
9	BY MR. ACOSTA:
10	Q. Did you do sufficient research to be
11	knowledgeable about smoking and health issues you have
12	testified about?
13	A. Yes.
14	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
15	THE WITNESS: Yes.
16	BY MR. ACOSTA:
17	Q. Okay. And in this case, what were your
18	primary -- strike that.
19	In this case, I asked you to tell us what you
20	thought about the messages that the cigarette industry
21	made to the public; is that correct?
22	A. That's correct.
23	MR. GERAGHTY: I object because that's not
24	what his disclosure says. You never told us
25	that's what you were going to ask him to do.
0521
1	BY MR. ACOSTA:
2	Q. Did you do sufficient research to provide
3	opinions and information about the messages that the
4	cigarette industry made to the public from 1954 up
5	until 2000?
6	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
7	THE WITNESS: Yes.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. Did you do adequate research to know what
10	each of the defendants in this case told the public
11	about smoking and health?
12	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: Yes.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. Did you do adequate research to know what the
16	Tobacco Industry Research Committee and the CTR were
17	for?
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: Yes.
20	BY MR. ACOSTA:
21	Q. And adequate research to know what The
22	Tobacco Institute was?
23	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
24	THE WITNESS: Yes.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0522
1	Q. And what it did?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And what it said?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Now, you were asked some questions about
6	whether plaintiffs attorneys provided you with
7	articles.
8	Do you remember those?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And stories -- excuse me. You were asked
11	questions about whether plaintiffs attorneys had
12	provided you with documents.
13	Do you remember that?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And the reference was to cigarette company
16	documents. Is that how you understood it?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. And those cigarette company documents, are
19	those documents available in the Library of Congress,
20	some of them?
21	A. Well, I mean, through the Internet, yes.
22	Q. And were those -- did any congressman have
23	the same documents?
24	A. Oh, yes, yes.
25	Q. Did -
0523
1	A. Yes. That would have been through, you know,
2	congressional committees, yes.
3	Q. And did United States congressmen put those
4	documents on the Internet?
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
6	THE WITNESS: Yes. The commerce committee
7	did, in fact.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. And the commerce committee of the United
10	States Congress, why did they put those documents on
11	the Internet, do you know?
12	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: Because they were of compelling
14	public interest.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. And did -- you mentioned that you've
17	testified in a number of cases in the past, right?
18	A. Correct.
19	Q. Have you ever been examined by a cigarette
20	company lawyer who said that the documents that you
21	studied and looked at were -- were incorrect?
22	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: I mean, the documents are true
24	industry documents. Do you mean inauthentic? Is
25	that what --
0524
1	BY MR. ACOSTA:
2	Q. Yes. Did any of them say, hey, these
3	documents are -- are not real; they're fake documents?
4	Did any of them ever do that?
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
6	THE WITNESS: No, they've never disputed the
7	authenticity of the documents from their own
8	clients.
9	BY MR. ACOSTA:
10	Q. At least with you?
11	A. At least with me.
12	Q. And did they ever show you any documents that
13	convinced you that the documents you looked at were
14	wrong?
15	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
16	THE WITNESS: No.
17	BY MR. ACOSTA:
18	Q. Have they had a lot of opportunities to do
19	that?
20	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
21	THE WITNESS: I believe I have been deposed
22	around 20 times by tobacco industry attorneys, so
23	that would be a lot of opportunity.
24	BY MR. ACOSTA:
25	Q. And -
0525
1	A. So yes.
2	Q. And you've looked at cigarette company
3	documents over the last ten years and testified about
4	them at least 20 times?
5	A. That's right. I have been looking at
6	cigarette documents for more than 10 -- 11, really,
7	going into a 12th year.
8	Q. In terms of the information contained --
9	contained in those documents, does it make any
10	difference to you whether you got them off the Internet
11	or whether they came from a congressional library or
12	one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs or the
13	attorneys representing the defendants where -- the
14	providing source for the documents, does it make any
15	difference how you get -- got them?
16	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
17	THE WITNESS: No, it makes no difference.
18	Every document is identified with a very long
19	serial number called a Bates number, which allows
20	you to make sure that -- to go back to the
21	original.
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. Okay. Have you done that in most cases?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. Have you verified yourself that the documents
0526
1	that were provided to you by attorneys were true and
2	accurate?
3	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: I have, yes.
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. Now, you were asked a number of questions
7	about whether you knew anything about the smoker or
8	smokers that may be involved in this case.
9	Do you remember that?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. And you mentioned this is a generic
12	deposition?
13	A. Right.
14	Q. What did you mean by that?
15	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
16	THE WITNESS: This deposition could apply to
17	a large number of cases.
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Move to strike.
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. Are you aware that -- are you aware of how
21	many -- well, strike that.
22	Do you have some idea as to how many cases
23	this deposition applies to?
24	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection. Move to strike.
25	THE WITNESS: I don't know the exact number,
0527
1	but my sense is that it could apply to hundreds,
2	perhaps even more.
3	MR. GERAGHTY: Move to strike.
4	BY MR. ACOSTA:
5	Q. And in this deposition, did anybody ask you
6	to look at the specifics of any individual smoker's
7	situation?
8	MR. KOETHE: Objection.
9	THE WITNESS: You mean over the course of my
10	time here testifying?
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. No. For purposes of your testimony in this
13	case, did anyone ask you to look at specific smoker
14	information?
15	A. No.
16	MR. KOETHE: Objection.
17	BY MR. ACOSTA:
18	Q. Is specific smoker information relevant to
19	your opinions in this case?
20	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
21	THE WITNESS: No.
22	BY MR. ACOSTA:
23	Q. Were your opinions and testimony and the
24	information you provided intended to pertain to all
25	smokers?
0528
1	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: Yes.
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. Was there any need for you to look at any
5	particular smoker's information to formulate any of the
6	opinions you had in this case?
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: No.
9	BY MR. ACOSTA:
10	Q. Was knowledge of any particular smoker's
11	situation necessary for you to provide any factual
12	information, which you provided in this case?
13	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
14	THE WITNESS: No.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. In order to give the opinions in this case
17	that you have, did you -- do you feel that you needed
18	to be a cigarette design engineer?
19	A. No.
20	Q. Do you feel you needed to be a physician?
21	A. No.
22	Q. Do you feel that you need to be a marketing
23	professor?
24	A. No.
25	Q. In order to give the opinions and provide the
0529
1	information you have, do you feel that you needed to be
2	anything other than the historian that you are?
3	A. No. The tools I have are what I need.
4	Q. Now, you were asked some questions about a
5	seminar that was put on in Boston about five years ago.
6	A. Yes, I was asked questions about that.
7	Q. And in that seminar, when you walked in, did
8	they have a table set up that you had to check in with?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And when you checked in, they handed you some
11	papers and asked you to sign an affidavit that you
12	signed?
13	A. That's right.
14	Q. And was it your understanding that some of
15	the information that was to be discussed in the seminar
16	was not to be shared with lawyers for Philip Morris or
17	lawyers for R.J. Reynolds or lawyers for
18	Liggett & Myers or lawyers for Lorillard?
19	A. Yes.

21	Justice lawyers also invited to this --

6	THE WITNESS: Yes, they did.
7	BY MR. ACOSTA:
8	Q. And was information about the United States
9	government's case against the defendants in this case
10	to be discussed at that seminar?
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
12	THE WITNESS: That's what was indicated when
13	I was at the conference, yeah. There was
14	indications of that.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. And did you understand that information that
17	might have been revealed during the seminar had the
18	potential of compromising the United States
19	government's case against the cigarette companies?
20	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
21	THE WITNESS: That was my understanding.

6	Q. Do you know whether the defense lawyers, the
7	ones that represent -- these law firms that represent
8	the cigarette company defendants in this case, have
9	meetings together?
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
II	THE WITNESS: Actually, I do know that they
12	have meetings.
13	BY MR. ACOSTA:
14	Q. Do you know if they're ever invited a
15	plaintiffs lawyer to one of their meetings to see --
16	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection-
17	BY MR. ACOSTA:
18	Q. -- what they're talking about?
19	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.

25	seminar at the law school in Boston, you said you

4	Q. Were you -- were you up there with your
5	family?
6	A. Yes. I brought my family up there.

12	an hour and 20 minutes.
13	Q. So you were there on this minivacation; you
14	signed an affidavit; you walked into the seminar; gave
15	your talk on the history; and left?

18	THE WITNESS: Yes. Went, left, and - left

22	anyone else while you were at that seminar?
23	A. Not one.
24	Q. You were shown a statement that was written
25	by an attorney named Norwood Wilner. Do you remember

1	that?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Did you authorize him to make -- to write
4	that statement?
5	A. No, I did not.

7	choices regarding the selection of documents or sources
8	that you looked into.
9	Do you remember that?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. Did you in your research look at choices that
12	the cigarette companies made?
13	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection.
14	THE WITNESS: Yes, I did.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. Did the cigarette companies choose to make
17	the cigarette brands that they made?
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: Yes, they did.
20	BY MR. ACOSTA:
21	Q. Did anyone else choose those brands other
22	than them?
23	A. No. They chose them.
24	Q. Did they choose how to make them?
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection. Can I have a
0534
1	standing objection to this whole line of
2	questioning?
3	MR. ACOSTA: Sure.
4	THE WITNESS: Yes.
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. Did the cigarette companies choose how to
7	sell them?

23	A. Yes.
24	Q. They chose to tell the public, at least after
25	the surgeon general found smoking to be addictive in
0535
1	1988, that it was not addictive?
2	A. Yes.
3	MR. ACOSTA: Give me just a second, and I
4	might --1 might be done.
5	(A pause was had in the proceedings.)
6	MR. ACOSTA: Well, let me ask you a few more
7	questions.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. You were asked questions about, again, about
10	receiving information selected by plaintiffs lawyers.
11	Do you remember that?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Lawyers that sue the cigarette industry?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. Have you ever observed any unethical conduct
16	on the part of the lawyers that you work for?
17	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: No, I haven't.
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. Have you ever observed anything immoral about
21	the way the litigation is handled by the plaintiffs
22	lawyers?
23	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
24	THE WITNESS: No, I have not.
25	BY MR. ACOSTA:
0536
1	Q. Do you find anything improper about the way
2	the plaintiffs lawyers have handled the litigation
3	from the plaintiffs perspective?
4	A. No.
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
6	THE WITNESS: Nothing improper.
7	BY MR. ACOSTA:
8	Q. Do you believe that suing the cigarette
9	industry is justified by people that have been fatally
10	inj ured by smoking ?
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
12	THE WITNESS: Yes, I do.
13	BY MR. ACOSTA:
14	Q. When you read the documents that you were
15	provided about the cigarette industry, how did you
16	feel?
17	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: My first feeling was disbelief
19	and shock and then anger.
20	BY MR. ACOSTA:
21	Q. Okay. Directed at who?
22	A. At the tobacco companies, because I had no
23	idea, even though I had a Ph.D. in history, I had no
24	idea that -- that they had known this much about their
25	products for so long and that they had acted in the
0537
1	manner that they had.
2	Q. Which was to do what?
3	A. Which was to deceive the public about the
4	product, to promote smoking, to engage in a grievous
5	crime against health and life in this country.
6	Q. Back in the mid-1950 --
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Move to--move to strike.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. Back in the mid-1950s, did any of the
10	companies consider going out of business rather than
11	sell products that would kill millions of people?
12	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: Well, that was a -
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. Let me rephrase it.
16	A. Yeah.
17	Q. Back in the mid-fifties, did you receive any
18	original information indicating that any of the
19	companies considered going out of business?
20	MR. GERAGHTY: Same objection.
21	THE WITNESS: If they -- yes, if they found
22	cigarettes to be harmful, they pledged to stop
23	making them.
24	BY MR. ACOSTA:
25	Q. And what happened?
0538
1	A. Well -
2	MR. KOETHE: Objection to the form.
3	THE WITNESS: -- in my opinion, they found
4	them to be harmful, and they kept making them.
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. They changed -- they changed their mind?
7	A. I guess they changed their mind. That would
8	be a good way to describe it.
9	Q. Was it their choice to continue selling those
10	products up through the year 2000?
11	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
12	THE WITNESS: It was their choice to sell the
13	products; it was their choice to represent the
14	products the way they did.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. Do you believe that it's okay for plaintiffs
17	lawyers to attempt to right a wrong?
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: I do. That's why we have a
20	civil justice system.
21	BY MR. ACOSTA:
22	Q. You were asked about neutrality. Do you
23	remember that?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. And when you approached this subject, did you
0539
1	approach the subject as a neutral?
2	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
3	THE WITNESS: When I approached this subject
4	initially?
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. As a brand new Ph.D. knowing nothing about
7	it.
8	A. I did approach it neutral, as a neutral
9	observer.
10	Q. Did you approach it like a jury might
11	approach hearing the facts about a case?
12	A. Yes.
13	MR. KOETHE: Object to form.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. Did you understand the jury is supposed to be
16	neutral?
17	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: Well, after hearing the facts
19	and making a judgment, no, they're not supposed to
20	be neutral.
21	BY MR. ACOSTA:
22	Q. That's right. The jury makes a decision
23	about one side or the other, don't they?
24	A. They make --
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
0540
1	THE WITNESS: They make a decision as to the
2	truth of the matter.
3	BY MR. ACOSTA:
4	Q. Once you -- once you had investigated and
5	determined all the facts in this case, did you form
6	opinions about the cigarette companies?
7	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: I formed opinions about their
9	actions over historical time, yes.
10	BY MR. ACOSTA:
11	Q. And do you believe they're well founded?
12	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: Very well founded.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. Are they sincere beliefs?
16	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
17	THE WITNESS: Sincere, very sincere.
18	BY MR. ACOSTA:
19	Q. Are they in keeping with your professional --
20	are they in keeping with the standards of your
21	profession?
22	A. Yes, they are.
23	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
24	BY MR. ACOSTA:
25	Q. And have your writings on the subject been
0541
1	accepted by other professional historians?
2	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection. There are none.
3	MR. ACOSTA: Except for Lacy Ford.
4	MR. GERAGHTY: No. There are no writings
5	that he has on the subject.
6	MR. ACOSTA: Oh.
7	MR. GERAGHTY: He's admitted that under
8	oath --
9	MR. ACOSTA: Well-
10	THE WITNESS: I have two-
11	MR. GERAGHTY: --several times, Howard.
12	MR. ACOSTA: No.
13	THE WITNESS: I have two articles --
14	MR. ACOSTA: He said-
15	THE WITNESS: - on the history of-
16	MR. ACOSTA: You missed it.
17	MR. GERAGHTY: On historians, defense
18	historians.
19	THE WITNESS: And I have another article.
20	MR. GERAGHTY: Subject of the testimony --
21	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. Wait a minute. Wait a
22	minute.
23	MR. GERAGHTY: Let's get this over with.
24	Come on.
25	MR. ACOSTA: Yeah, I'm almost done.
0542
1	MR. GERAGHTY: Okay.
2	BY MR. ACOSTA:
3	Q. Have you written on the subject of smoking
4	and health?
5	A. I have written on --
6	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
7	THE WITNESS: I have written on the history
8	of the cigarette industry.
9	BY MR. ACOSTA:
10	Q. Okay. And has your article been reviewed by
11	professionals?
12	A. Yes.
13	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
14	BY MR. ACOSTA:
15	Q. Okay. And has it been published?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. And -
18	MR. KOETHE: Object to this whole line of
19	questioning. It's highly improper and --
20	MR. GERAGHTY: And counsel knows it.
21	MR. ACOSTA: Oh, I don't think so —
22	MR. GERAGHTY: Yeah.
23	MR. ACOSTA: -- not considering what you guys
24	asked him.
25	MR. GERAGHTY: No.
0543
1	BY MR. ACOSTA:
2	Q. You were asked some questions about the
3	difference between The New York Times newspaper and
4	local newspapers.
5	Do you remember questions along those lines?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. In some cases, you looked at -- in some cases
8	you've testified in before you've looked at local
9	newspapers; is that correct?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. In this case, you are relying primarily upon
12	The New York Times; is that right?
13	A. That's correct.
14	Q. Okay. What kind of a newspaper is The New
15	York Times?
16	A. Well, it's a national paper. It's, in terms
17	of staff and budget, the -- historically, the largest
18	paper in the United States in terms of its
19	news-gathering abilities, and it's generally considered
20	to be the paper of record.
21	Q. Okay. How many papers of record are there in
22	the United States?
23	A. Generally, The New York Times is considered
24	the paper of record, so, one.
25	Q. Okay. Now, in the cases that you've
0544
1	testified where you've looked at local papers, like --
2	I don't know -- the St. Petersburg Times, for example,
3	in those cases, were you asked to give case-specific
4	opinions?
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
6	THE WITNESS: In some cases, I have given
7	some case-specific opinions, occasionally.
8	BY MR. ACOSTA:
9	Q. In this particular matter, were you asked to
10	give any case-specific opinions about any particular
11	plaintiffs?
12	A. No.
13	MR. GERAGHTY: Object to the form of the
14	question.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. Is there anything -- is it -- well, why did
17	you use The New York Times as a primary reference in
18	this case or in these cases instead of local newspapers
19	in Florida?
20	A. The Times is the most comprehensive paper for
21	this national issue. Florida is a highly diverse
22	state. It has had throughout the 20th century one of
23	the highest in-migration rates, so it -- you know,
24	Florida has a diverse population from all over the
25	country. And so given -- given that reality, it seemed
0545
1	to me appropriate to rely on a national paper of record
2	to establish the general outlines and facts of the
3	matter of the information the tobacco industry was
4	expressing to the public and the kinds of stories that
5	appeared on the issue of smoking and health over the
6	time period.
7	Q. Does Philip Morris have a national
8	headquarters in New York?
9	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
10	BY MR. ACOSTA:
11	Q. Let me ask you this: Where are
12	Philip Morris's offices?
13	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
14	THE WITNESS: Park Avenue, New York City.
15	BY MR. ACOSTA:
16	Q. Is that the same place that The New York
17	Times comes from?
18	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: New York City, yes.
20	BY MR. ACOSTA:
21	Q. And where is Hill & Knowlton in relationship
22	to Philip Morris?
23	MR. KOETHE: Objection.
24	THE WITNESS: Well, at the historical time
25	that we're dealing with, they were located in
0546
1	midtown Manhattan.
2	BY MR. ACOSTA:
3	Q. How about the Tobacco Industry Research
4	Committee, what was its location with respect to the
5	public relations firm Hill & Knowlton?
6	MR. KOETHE: Objection.
7	THE WITNESS: Well, originally, in the spare
8	office in the Hill & Knowlton offices. It was
9	always located very close. It was, in fact, for
10	many years, in the same building, but also in New
11	York City.
12	BY MR. ACOSTA:
13	Q. Did the Tobacco Industry Research Committee
14	interface with this public relations firm,
15	Hill & Knowlton?
16	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
17	THE WITNESS: Very much so, yes. The TIRC
18	was Hill & Knowlton's idea.
19	BY MR. ACOSTA:
20	Q. And based upon your investigation and
21	knowledge regarding the cigarette company defendants in
22	this case, was the health of the smoker truly
23	paramount?
24	MR. KOETHE: Objection.
25	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
0547
1	THE WITNESS: Absolutely not. It was the
2	last thing they thought of.
3	MR. ACOSTA: Thank you. That's all the
4	questions I have.
5	MR. GERAGHTY: Do you need to mike me or —
6	I'm not loud enough?
7	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: No.
8	(Brief recess was taken.)
9	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're on the record.
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Are you ready?
11	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Yes.
12	RECROSS-EXAMINATION
13	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
14	Q. Are you ready?
15	A. Yes, I am.
16	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, Bill Geraghty again. I just
17	have a couple questions I want to ask you about.
18	During the questions he asked on redirect,
19	Mr. Acosta asked you about saccharin.
20	Do you recall those questions and answers you
21	gave?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. Okay. You're not an expert on saccharin, are
24	you?
25	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
0548
1	THE WITNESS: No. I just know that as part
2	of having lived through the saccharin issue.
3	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
4	Q. You said you were bom in, when, 1963?
5	A. That's right.
6	Q. Okay. You've never made saccharin the
7	subject of any historical research of any kind, right?
8	A. Specifically saccharin, no, no. I just know
9	about it. And I know about cyclamates as well.
10	Q. You're not an expert on the history of
11	saccharin, are you?
12	MR. ACOSTA: Object to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: No. I have not - no. I just
14	know about saccharin --
15	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
16	Q. Okay. Well --
17	A. -- as an example.
18	Q. -- when Mr. Acosta asked you when a warning
19	went on saccharin, do you really know the answer to
20	that question?
21	A. Well, my recollection is it was -- yeah, I do
22	know the answer.
23	Q. What year did a warning first go on
24	saccharin?
25	A. I don't remember the exact year, but it
0549
1	was --1 believe was in the 1970s.
2	Q. When in the 1970s?
3	A. I don't know the exact year. I would have to
4	look that up. But I do recall from my youth a debate
5	about saccharin and coming on the heels of the debate
6	over -- after cyclamates --
7	Q. Okay.
8	A. -- to artificial sweeteners. They both had a
9	health problem.
10	Q. And, now, Mr. Acosta's question was referring
11	to the questions I asked you about, whether it was
12	unprecedented for a warning to be on a consumer product
13	when the first warning went on cigarettes in 1966,
14	right?
15	A. That's right.
16	Q. And so now you've -- you agreed with
17	Mr. Acosta an hour ago that there was a warning on
18	saccharin at about the same time that there was a
19	warning on cigarettes, didn't you?
20	A. Roughly. But the cigarettes would have
21	been -- been sooner, you know.
22	Q. Right. Giving you a little bit more thought,
23	you think it was a little bit later in time, in the
24	seventies, right?
25	A. Yes.
0550
1	Q. Was it 1971?
2	A. It could have been. I'd have to look up the
3	exact date, but it was in the 1970s.
4	Q. Was it 1972?
5	A. I couldn't give you the exact date. I would
6	have to look that up.
7	Q. It's because you don't know the answer to the
8	question, right?
9	MR. ACOSTA: Object to the form.
10	THE WITNESS: Yeah, I just told you.
11	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
12	Q. Okay. But you gave Mr. Acosta an answer,
13	anyway; isn't that the truth?
14	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
15	THE WITNESS: I agreed with him that
16	saccharin had a warning label on it, because I
17	remembered that.
18	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
19	Q. At about the same time that the warning went
20	on cigarette packs, which was 1966, correct?
21	MR. ACOSTA: No. Object to form.
22	THE WITNESS: If that's -
23	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
24	Q. Yes or no, Doctor?
25	A. If that's what I said, I was mistaken. I
0551
I	meant to say --
2	Q. You were --
3	A. -- afterwards.
4	Q. You were mistaken?
5	A. Yeah.
6	Q. Okay. You don't really know what year in the
7	decade of the 1970s a warning first went on saccharin,
8	right?
9	A. I've already said that.
10	Q. Okay. So if I were to represent to you that
II	it was 1977, 11 years after a warning went on a pack of
12	cigarettes for the first time, that would be news to
13	you, correct?
14	A. Sounds about right.
15	Q. Okay. But it's news to you, because when
16	Mr. Acosta asked you the question, you didn't know the
17	answer, right?
18	A. The exact year, no, I didn't.
19	Q. Okay. But you gave him an answer anyway
20	because, as you said about 15 minutes ago, you're
21	angry, right?
22	A. I wasn't angry.
23	Q. Didn't you tell Mr. Acosta that you're angry?
24	A. No, I'm not angry.
25	Q. Fifteen or 20 minutes ago, you said you were
0552
1	angered at the documents that you reviewed; isn't that
2	right?
3	A. Oh, when I first read the tobacco industry
4	documents, I was shocked. I felt shock and disbelief
5	and a little bit of anger, that's right.
6	Q. Right. No, you didn't say a little bit of
7	anger.
8	A. Anger, anger.
9	Q. You said you were angry, didn't you?
10	A. I had no idea that -- yes. When I read those
11	documents, I really --1 had anger and other feelings,
12	too.
13	Q. And that's an emotion, right?
14	A. Yeah, it's an emotion.
15	Q. And so you were not, after having done any
16	amount of research, calm, dispassionate, and neutral
17	when it comes to these issues; isn't that true?
18	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
19	THE WITNESS: Once I began to see the
20	documents that indicated the truth of the matter,
21	I began to see the truth of the industry's
22	actions, and I was very -- it was, you know, it
23	was a very interesting experience to read those
24	documents.
25	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
0553
1	Q. Doctor, my question is you were no longer
2	calm, dispassionate, and neutral when it comes to the
3	issues in this case; isn't that right?
4	A. When it comes to the issues of the truth of
5	the tobacco industry's behavior, I -- no, I am --1 am
6	not neutral. I am on the side of what the industry
7	actually did.
8	Q. Okay. You're no longer neutral; isn't that
9	right?
10	A. I'm not neutral; I'm -- I'm on the side of
11	the truth.
12	Q. Okay. But that colors how you answer every
13	question that Mr. Acosta asks, right?
14	A. No.
15	Q. You don't think so?
16	A. No.
17	Q. You told me at the very beginning of this
18	examination, when I first stood up here, that an expert
19	should be neutral and unbiased; isn't that right?
20	A. Yes. And I have been unbiased. I mean, I
21	have been on the side -- well, I have been biased
22	towards the truth. That would be where my bias lays.
23	Q. Okay. You're -- you're so neutral that
24	you're willing to answer a question about when a
25	warning went on saccharin when you have no idea what
0554
1	the real answer is; isn't that the truth, Doctor?
2	MR. ACOSTA: Object to the form.
3	THE WITNESS: I was relying on my memory of,
4	you know, of my own youth on that one.
5	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
6	Q. Well, did you say that when Mr. Acosta asked
7	you the question?
8	MR. ACOSTA: Object to the form.
9	THE WITNESS: No, I didn't.
10	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
11	Q. Did you say to Mr. Acosta, You know what,
12	Mr. Acosta, I'm not an expert on saccharin; I really
13	don't know when the warning went on there? Did you say
14	that to him?
15	A. No, I didn't say that.
16	Q. Right. And that's because you're not
17	neutral; isn't that right?
18	A. I have--no, I'm not neutral in the sense
19	that I have an opinion based on the research that I
20	have done and the documents I have looked at and the
21	truth of the matter.
22	Q. You have a personal opinion, and that is that
23	you're angry at the companies who are defendants in
24	this case, right, and that influences how you answer
25	every question Mr. Acosta asks; isn't that right?
0555
1	A. That's incorrect. That is not a true
2	statement.
3	Q. But you're willing to provide an answer about
4	a warning on saccharin when you have no earthly idea
5	what the true answer is to the question, right?
6	A. Well, you know, I was --1 didn't offer the
7	exact date. But he offered the saccharin as an
8	example, and I thought saccharin was another example of
9	a consumer product that is widely held that had a
10	warning, you know. My precedents, I think, were much
11	better, the ones that I offered, which I did in
12	response to your questions.
13	Q. Well, in response to all your questions, did
14	the thought ever occur to you, You know what, maybe I
15	ought to tell Mr. Acosta, I don't know the answer to
16	the question, Mr. Acosta; I'm not an expert on the
17	subject? Did that thought ever cross your head?
18	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
19	THE WITNESS: Well, I mean, I answered to the
20	best of my ability.
21	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
22	Q. Doctor, that's not my question. My question
23	was did the thought ever cross your head to tell the
24	truth in response to Mr. Acosta's questions and say,
25	You know what, I don't know the answer?
0556
1	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
2	THE WITNESS: Well, I did answer that
3	question truthfully.
4	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
5	Q. Really? By suggesting that a warning went on
6	saccharin at the same time that a warning went on a
7	pack of cigarettes in 1966?
8	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
9	THE WITNESS: I don't think he said at the
10	same time. I understood that to mean after
11	cigarettes went on. I mean, I understood his
12	question to mean afterwards. I knew it was
13	afterwards. I told you it was in the 1970s.
14	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
15	Q. Well, in response to the questions that I
16	asked, right?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. You never once said in response to
19	Mr. Acosta's questions, No, Mr. Acosta, it wasn't 1966;
20	it was in the seventies. Did you say that?
21	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
22	THE WITNESS: No, I didn't say that. Did you
23	say it was -- did Mr. Acosta say it was 1966?
24	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
25	Q. He said, Mr. Geraghty asked you if it was
0557
1	unprecedented for there to be a warning on a consumer
2	product when a warning went on cigarette packs in 1966.
3	That was the question he asked you, right?
4	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
5	THE WITNESS: Yes, something like that, yeah.
6	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
7	Q. All right. And he said, You've heard of
8	saccharin. And you just went right along with every
9	question he asked, didn't you?
10	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
11	THE WITNESS: What do you mean "right along"?
12	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
13	Q. You agreed with every question -- did you
14	disagree with any of the things he told you?
15	MR. ACOSTA: Object to the form.
16	THE WITNESS: He -- he asked me questions,
17	and I gave him answers about saccharin. I knew
18	that saccharin had a warning in response to a
19	health scare related to --
20	BY MR. GERAGHTY:
21	Q. You gave him answers that you knew when you
22	gave were probably wrong, right, and were just made up?
23	A. No.
24	MR. ACOSTA: Object to form.
25	MR. GERAGHTY: No. Okay. Well, those are
0558
1	all the questions I have.
2	MR. ACOSTA: You other guys have any
3	questions?
4	MR. KOETHE: No questions.
5	MR. ROSENSTEIN: No questions.
6	MR. GERAGHTY: We're done.
7	MR. ACOSTA: No, we're not. Dr.
8	Kyriakoudes --
9	MR. GERAGHTY: There is no re, re, re,
10	redirect.
11	MR. ACOSTA: Sure, there is.
12	MR. GERAGHTY: No, there is not.
13	MR. ACOSTA: I know I don't have a mike on.
14	Can you hear me okay?
15	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: No.
16	(A pause was had in the proceedings.)
17	FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION
18	BY MR. ACOSTA:
19	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, when I asked you the
20	questions about the saccharin, do you recall me saying
21	that there was a caution label in 1966, and then there
22	was a warning that was first put on cigarette packages
23	in 1970?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. Okay. And I apologize if I was wrong about
0559
1	this, but I was asking you about that time frame. And
2	did you understand my question to be that time frame?
3	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: In 1970s?
5	BY MR. ACOSTA:
6	Q. Well, '66 through sometime when -- about the
7	time the warning was put on the packages.
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. Okay.
10	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
11	BY MR. ACOSTA:
12	Q. And do you know for a fact that it was 1977,
13	or are you accepting what Mr. Geraghty is saying?
14	A. Well, no. All I'm saying is he's represented
15	to me 1977. I just remember the 1970s. I couldn't
16	tell you the exact year until I look it up.
17	Q. When you answered those questions, did you
18	think you were telling the truth?
19	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: Yes.
21	MR. GERAGHTY: You have to know.
22	THE WITNESS: I know I was telling the truth.
23	MR. GERAGHTY: Thank you.
24	BY MR. ACOSTA:
25	Q. You weren't intending to deceive anybody by
0560
1	your answer, were you?
2	A. No, not at all.
3	MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to the form.
4	MR. ACOSTA: Okay. That's all the questions
5	I've got.
