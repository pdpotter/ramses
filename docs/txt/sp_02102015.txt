No, I haven't.
There's one little

24 Q. Go ahead, tell me what that is.
25 A. It's a very minor exception, but I wrote
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221
61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 10
1 a biography recently of Dr. T.R.M. Howard, who
2 was a civil rights leader, and Dr. Howard's --
3 one of his mentors was a woman who was the 7th
4 Day Adventist daughter of Dr. Kress.
5 Dr. Kress wrote a, was a major sort of critic of
6 smoking and pointing out the health dangers of
7 smoking in the 1910s, 1920s.
8
9
10
11
And
So I just mentioned him a little bit as sort
of background to Dr. Howard.
But that would be
the only thing that even bears on those issues.
Q.
And just my understanding and so
12 historically I just want to make sure I
13 understand this, the criticism, did you study --
14 the criticism that you were talking about, what
15 the specific criticism was about cigarette
16 smoking?
17
18
19
20
A.
It's been a lot of years, but yeah, I
read a little bit about what he had to say.
Q.
Was his criticism concerning cigarette
smoking or just tobacco in general?
21 A. It was both.
22 Q. And was the criticism back in the 1910,
23 1920 area, was it concerning the health hazards
24 of smoking or more associated with the moral
25 hazards of cigarette smoking?

6
A.
No, he was a doctor, medical doctor, so
he focused on the medical side more.
Q.
And did you write any of that stuff in
your -- did you write about that in your book?
A.
Yeah, but it's a matter of a paragraph
or something like that.
7 Q. And when was the book published?
8 A. I'm trying to remember myself when it
9
10
was published.
Q.
2009.
Had you gotten involved in testifying on
11 behalf of the tobacco companies before that book
12 was published?
13
14
15
A.
Yes, but the research and the manuscript
was completed at the time I became involved.
Q.
Had the -- okay, so the -- when were you
16 first contacted to become involved in cases and
17 testifying on behalf of tobacco companies?
18 A. I was around November 2008.
19 Q. And your testimony is that your -- that
20 the passage that you're talking about concerning
21 the doctor's criticism of the hazards of smoking
22 was done before your involvement?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. Have you -- okay.
25
So other than that
one paragraph you're talking about, so I want to

61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 12
1 set that aside.
2 concerning internal company documents of the
3 tobacco industry?
Have you done any research
4 A. No.
5 Q. Have you ever been asked by any of the
6 lawyers representing the tobacco companies to
7 take a look at their internal documents?
8 A. No.
9 Q. Have you ever been asked by the tobacco
10 companies to research the public statements made
11 by the tobacco companies?
12 A. No.
13 Q. Have you published in the area of --
14 have you ever done any research in the area of
15 tobacco public statements --

MS. KANE:
Object --
BY MR. ROSEN:
Q.
-- during the -- between the 1900s and
2000?
A.
During what period of my life are you
asking about?
Q.
Have you ever, have you ever done any of
that, any research --
24 A. Could you repeat the question, please?
25 Q. Yeah, I'm just wondering have you done
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221
61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 13
1 any research specific to what the tobacco
2 companies statements were between let's say 1950
3 and 2000?
4 A.
Yes.
5 Q.
And tell me what that has been.
6 A.
I -- when I look at newspaper articles,
7 for example, often company statements are
8 included or sometimes they are included.
9 I've certainly looked at the arguments that are
10
11
12
13
And so
made by the companies.
Q.
What were some of those arguments
between the 1950s and the 2000s?
A.
They would -- there weren't a lot of
14 different varieties, but it was sort of, well, we
15 need more research, association doesn't equal
16 causation.
17 arguments I'd see.
18 down to two main arguments those would be the
19 ones.
20
Q.
Those were sort of some of the key
Got you.
I mean, if you -- to boil it
Is it -- so is it -- so based
21 on your research and your review of historical
22 records between with the 1950s and 2000, the
23 tobacco companies were essentially saying it
24 wasn't proven that cigarettes caused certain
25 diseases?

2 THE WITNESS:
3
4
Object to form.
Yes.
BY MR. ROSEN:
Q.
And during the 1950s up until the 2000s
5 cigarette companies would say they need more
6 research to figure out if cigarette smoking
7 causes diseases?
8 MS. KANE:
9 THE WITNESS:
10
Object to form.
Up until about 1999,
2000, yes.
11
MS. EGLI:
I'm sorry to interrupt.
12 But Eric, can we just get an agreement that one
13 objection for one is objection for both
14 defendants?
15 MR. ROSEN:
16 MS. EGLI:
17
you off, Dr. Beito.
18
Yes, absolutely.
I'm sorry, I think I cut
I'm sorry.
THE WITNESS:
I think I answered.
19 said up to about 1999, 2000, yes.
20 BY MR. ROSEN:
21
Q.
I
And based on your research, those were
22 statements that you would see kind of peppered
23 through newspaper articles and other publishings?
24 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
25 THE WITNESS:
They did not appear in
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221
61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 15
1 the vast majority of newspaper articles but they
2 did appear, especially during the earlier period.
3 BY MR. ROSEN:
4
Q.
Can you say, do you have an opinion as
5 to the percentage of what their statements, the
6 cigarette companies' statements were during the
7 1950s and 19 -- late 1990s?
8
9
A.
Well, if you were to spread it over that
whole period, it would be I would say, you know,
10 maybe you would be talking about three, four
11 percent.
12 period.
13
Q.
It would be higher in the earlier
But that's just a very rough estimate.
What about just -- just to focus on
14 newspaper articles that would -- that were
15 associated with the release of a Surgeon General
16 report, how often would the cigarette companies
17 respond with their argument in newspaper articles
18 that you reviewed?
19 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
20 THE WITNESS:
I haven't done a
21 precise estimate, but you would certainly see
22 company statements.
23 a lot of stories appear about the Surgeon
24 General's report, about here's quit smoking
25 programs and that kind of thing, and you wouldn't
But then again you would see
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221
61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 16
1 get any industry statement in those.
2 very hard to make an estimate.
3
So it's
If you were to look at the main argument, the
4 main articles sort of that came out reporting on
5 that, I'd say, you know, you would have company
6 statements pretty frequently.
7 a percentage.
8 the companies and ask what their statement --
9 what their reaction was to the report.
10
I don't know about
Just to -- reporters would go to
So if you're talking about the standard news
11 story this report was just done, you know, it
12 would be fairly high.
13 BY MR. ROSEN:
14
Q.
Would you say -- and just a rough
15 estimate, if you were to give me a rough estimate
16 would you say it would be more than 90 percent of
17 the time?
18 A.
I wouldn't say that high.
19 Q.
So just what -- just with respect to --
20 what I'm talking about is just with respect to
21 the release of the various Surgeon General
22 reports throughout history, would you say that it
23 was up around 90 percent of the time that there
24 would be some statement or response about the
25 cigarette companies?

1 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
2 THE WITNESS:
I would say with the
3 early Surgeon General's report, the '64 one, the
4 later ones very often -- I think more often don't
5 include company statements.
6 making a very seat of the pants estimate.
7 were to actually look at the actual news report,
8 you just had the Surgeon General's report, I
9 would say, you know, it would probably be, you
Again, I'm just
If you
10 know, over half would have some company statement
11 maybe at the end.
12 the articles that were generated by that it would
13 be very small.
14 BY MR. ROSEN:
15
Q.
But if you were to look at all
And so you said that more than -- just
16 the main articles that we're talking about that
17 would come out concerning the Surgeon General
18 report, you're talking about more than half would
19 have a response by the cigarette companies?
20
A.
If you're looking at the articles that
21 are on that front page, often above the fold, a
22 lot of those would include some sort of company
23 statement at the end.
24
25
MS. KANE:
I didn't get my form
objection to that last question.

1 THE WITNESS:
2 MS. KANE:
3
I'm sorry.
Object to form.
BY MR. ROSEN:
4 Q. Okay.
5 A. I mean, the ones that occurred right
I got you.
6 after, the day after, you know, reporting the
7 story.
8 Q.
9
10
11
12
13
So let me ask you, let me just get this
out of the way.
Have you -- as part of your work
as a professor -- let me go back.
What do you focus on in your work as a
professor currently?
A.
Okay.
Right now I'm writing a book
14 about the 1930s and the New Deal period in civil
15 liberties.
16 Q.
Is any of your teaching that you do as a
17 professor, does that focus on anything, you know,
18 tobacco or cigarette related?
19 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
20 THE WITNESS:
Very little.
I teach
21 a course occasionally on the progressive period.
22 And in that course I do talk about the various
23 prohibitionist movements if you want to call them
24 it that have occurred.
25 movement about cigarettes, prohibition and
And I will mention the
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221
61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 19
1 restriction that occurred during, say --
2 BY MR. ROSEN:
3 Q. But as far as --
4 A. -- the 1910s, 1920s.
5 Q. Okay.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
So that's a focus, sometimes talk
6 about the progressive stage during the 1910s,
7 1920s, and talk about the prohibitions of
8 cigarettes.
9
A.
Yeah, the movement for that as part of
10 the whole general picture of progressive moral
11 reform.
12
Q.
And as far as from your understanding,
13 that, like you said, progressive moral reform had
14 to do more with the moral negatives associated
15 with smoking than the health aspect of cigarette
16 smoking?
17 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
18 THE WITNESS:
Well, when we use the
19 term "moral reform" it's usually very broad.
I
20 would say that that movement focused -- this is a
21 very scientific era, so I think it focused by the
22 1910s and '20s on the harm that it caused.
23 that would include the movement for alcohol
24 prohibition as well.
25 BY MR. ROSEN:
And

61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 20
1
Q.
Was it social harm as opposed to the
2 causation of a disease, when you say historically
3 when you talk about that era?
4 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
5 THE WITNESS:
It would be physical
6 harm but also if you were to look at, say,
7 alcohol prohibition they would look a lot at
8 drunkenness and how that undermined the family
9 and so forth.
10 BY MR. ROSEN:
11
Q.
And would that be the same thing that
12 you would see historically in the 1910s and 1920s
13 associated with smoking where it could corrupt
14 the mind?
15 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
16 THE WITNESS:
Yeah, that would be
17 part of it, but there was a lot of emphasis on
18 the physical danger.

22
Q.
I think that's primary.
In that period of time what physical
danger was emphasized?
A.
Well, there would be a lot -- a whole
23 menu of issues including heart disease, cancer
24 would certainly -- would certainly be one of
25 those, heart disease, cancer, was blamed for a

1 lot of different health issues, tuberculosis and
2 so forth.
3
Q.
Do you think back in that time that that
4 was a widely held belief by the public that
5 cigarettes did actually cause those harms?
6
A.
It was a widely held belief that
7 cigarette smoking was harmful and could shorten
8 your life.
9 Q.
So yes, I would say yes.
Why then would the cigarette companies
10 during that time and going forward if it was a
11 widely held belief that cigarette smoking was
12 harmful deny that cigarettes actually caused
13 those harms?
14 MS. KANE:
15 THE WITNESS:
16 them actually denying it.
17 the kind of -- I don't see them really sort of
18 making those kinds of arguments until much later.
19 BY MR. ROSEN:
20
Q.
Object to form.
I don't know if I see
I -- you know, you see
That's my point is that if it was
21 actually believed back in the 1910s to 1920s that
22 it's harmful, why then did the cigarette
23 companies later on be denying that there was any
24 proof or that it didn't cause disease?

3 BY MR. ROSEN:
4
Q.
Well, are you talking
Yeah, yeah, let's go forward in time to
5 1950s, but you're saying it was a widely held
6 belief in the 1910s and 1920s and why would the
7 cigarette companies in the 1950s and forward be
8 saying that it's not true?
9
MS. KANE:

Well, what their
11 focusing on of course in the '50s is the issue of
12 lung cancer, not whether or not smoking is -- is
13 harmful.

15 well, we don't have enough research on this,
16 association doesn't equal causation, things like
17 that.

I mean that's what the companies are
And they are making the argument,
It's not really, I don't see them really

20 harmful or not.
21 cancer specifically.

Do you think the companies made those

5 BY MR. ROSEN:

Q.
Do you think for purposes of your
7 testimony in this case that it would be important
8 to know what the cigarette companies' internal
9 documents said about the harms of smoking and
10 what they believed, as what their public
11 statements were?

Object to the form.
13 THE WITNESS:
My focus is the issue
14 of awareness by the public, of the danger of
15 smoking and whether or not smoking was habit
16 forming.
17 it doesn't really bear directly on that topic.
18 BY MR. ROSEN:
19
Q.
I didn't do research on that area.
So
Have you formed any conclusions as to
20 why the cigarette companies between the 1950s and
21 the late 1990s were denying that cigarettes
22 caused harm?
23 MS. KANE:

Q.
I see them questioning,
And since you've read articles going
5 right up until late 1990s and I'm sure past that,
6 have you formed any conclusions as to why they
7 were doing that, why they were challenging the
8 statements that cigarettes are harmful?

I looked at what the -- you
You mentioned before that the focus in

16 1954 when -- after the studies were done that
17 were linking tumors that -- there was a link
18 between the tainting of the mice and

A.
Yeah, it was published I believe in '54

4 studies had come out.

Q.
And those scientific studies were
linking cigarettes to tumors, cancer?
7 MS. KANE:
8 THE WITNESS:
9
Object to form.
They were -- there
were various studies but they were linking --
10 that was one of them and others were sort of
11 making the arguments that, you know, people that
12 had lung cancer were more likely to be smokers,
13 that kind of thing.
14 studies and various kinds of studies were done,
15 including the ones you mentioned.
16 BY MR. ROSEN:
17
Q.
So they were statistical
And like I said, so you mentioned the
18 focus was on lung cancer, not really the general
19 harms of smoking that you described in 1910 and
20 1920s which you say was a wildly held belief.
21 I just want to read from the Frank Statement and
22 ask you a question following it, okay?

At one time or another
One by one these charges have been
Were they just focused on lung cancer with
7 that statement or were they talking about the
8 other harms that you say were wildly held in the
9 1910s and 1920s?
10 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
11 THE WITNESS:
The major -- well, I
12 was talking about the major focus over that
13 period in company statements was focused on the
14 immediate issue of lung cancer throughout that
15 period.

17 lung cancer and, you know, to the extent company
18 statements appeared they focused on that issue.

Q.
So over and over again they would be
Outside of that major focus concerning
21 lung cancer though, the cigarette companies at
22 least in 1950 forward when they issued the Frank
23 Statement were basically saying that one by one

25 practically every disease were abandoned for lack

8 and so forth, tuberculosis, a wide range of
9 health issues.

Does smoking cause tuberculosis, do you
know?

18 was -- that it was not.

20 association but I haven't focused on that.

From what
Now, there may have been
And so just sticking to that
23 topic, there were articles that were coming out

I think it's fair to

It's
So there were -- it's fair

much have you billed so far in this case?

How much have I billed so far?
I didn't

I could try to sort

2 Q. And would that be up until right now?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. And the bills that you sent, would I
5 just be able to take those bills and add them up
6 and that would give me that number or that close,
7 that proximate number?

9 right.

12
Well, I hope so.
I hope my estimate is
But yes, you have all of the invoices and
gives, it gives the amount.
Q.
Is there work that you have done since
your last invoice that you intend to bill for?

Yes.
I generally bill at the end of the
14 month. 15 Q. How many hours since your last invoice?
16 A. How many hours is my last invoice?

A.
200 per hour regardless of what I'm
doing, if it's related to the case.
Q.
Sure.
If you're flying down here from
5 Alabama you would charge $200 per hour for the

7
A.
I generally don't charge the full amount
8 if I'm on a plane, but I generally drive here.
9 But I'm on a plane I generally don't charge the
10 full amount because, you know, I could be doing
11 other work on the plane.

Q.
In all the -- you said you got involved
13 right around 2008 or 2009 with testifying in
14 tobacco cases?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. And all of that testimony has been on
17
behalf of the defendant tobacco companies?

19 Q. And how much -- since you've been
20 involved since 2009 how much have you been paid

Well, I intend to testify about my

12 sources he would have possibly been exposed to
13 that would bear on the issue of the health
14 consequences of smoking and whether or not
15 smoking is habit forming.

Those would include sources such as his
17 church, Baptist, publications of the Baptists and
18 other things related to that.
19 newspapers in communities where he lived over
20 time.
21 the -- news commentary over both the radio and
22 television.

that were used and other educational information.
It would also include some material from
3 Florida for the 1950s in terms of what the
4 schools were teaching because, of course, as
5 children we're attending school during that
6 period.
7
And I'm trying to think if there's anything
8 else offhand.
That's -- I looked at churches, I
9 looked at the union, I looked at the newspapers,
10 news reports.
11 depositions, you know, information in there about
12 family members and so forth and what they said.
13
Q.
Certainly what I read in
I got you.
So now I understand the
14 sources of what the information is that you're
15 going to talk about, I.
16 have an opinion about when Mr. Robertson, when he
17 actually believed cigarettes were harmful as
18 opposed to when he might have become aware that
19 cigarettes were harmful?
Understand that.

Let me ask you about that real quick
10 because you brought up the death in the 1950s.

23 that in one of the depositions that this was
24 raised, people said hey, you know, her death was
25 caused by this.

10 concern.

13 tuberculosis, which caused their sister to die,
14 right?

I think that my memory of that it was a
16 cause of the fact that she died so young.
17 was like 30 years old or something like that.
18 And certainly the tuberculosis would be, you
19 know, part of that.

remember it said precisely that but it may have.

You read -- you did read the deposition,
Q.
And if in fact she reported that
smoking -- to her brother that smoking caused
10 Ida's tuberculosis, you would agree that that was
11 a timeframe where, as you said earlier, there
12 were reports coming out smoking didn't cause
13 tuberculosis?

A.
I'm not sure when those reports came
15 out.
16 I said, sometime during that timeframe.

18 cancer deaths were very new and a lot of lung
19 cancer deaths according to what I read in the
20 literature, again, I'm not a scientist, but what
21 the newspapers said were sometimes tuberculosis
22 would be -- or lung cancer or would be
23 misdiagnosed as tuberculosis.
24
25
It might have been after that period.
Q.
Like
And of

the progression of how long it takes to develop

1 lung cancer and knowing when Ida's sister started
2 to smoke, do you think based on that timeframe
3 that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer in the
4 sister that passed away in early 1950s?
5 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
6 THE WITNESS:
I didn't look at that
7 issue and I'm not a scientist.
8 BY MR. ROSEN:
9
Q.
Well, that's what I'm trying to get at.
10 You're trying to say it could have been
11 misdiagnosed but the point I'm trying to make is
12 from the time that we're looking at it's very,
13 very highly unlikely that she -- that Hattie
14 developed lung cancer, right?
15 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
16 THE WITNESS:
I don't know.
I know
17 very little about her death other than what the
18 depositions say.
19 BY MR. ROSEN:
20 Q. You know that she died in 1951?
21 A. Yes, 1951.
22 Q. And you know she left home in 1941
23
24
25
according to the deposition of Ida Newkirt?
A.
Yeah, I know she left home early.
I
don't know the precise year.

Q.
But you know that she didn't -- Hattie
2 didn't start smoking until after she left home in
3 1941, right?
4
A.
I don't remember that from the
5 deposition.
6 Q.
Could have been in there.
If that's, assuming that's the case
7 would it have been approximate if you were to say
8 that she started smoking immediately it would be
9 approximately a ten-year period that she smoked?
10
11
12
A.
I don't remember what it said about when
she started smoking.
Q.
Okay.
And do you remember this question
13 and answer:
14 tuberculosis?

16 I don't know at that was.

Do you know what caused her

2 right?
3 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
4 THE WITNESS:
It said her lifestyle
5 and the smoking caused it according to the
6 doctor, according to her memory what the doctor
7 said.
8 BY MR. ROSEN:
9
Q.
And we'll talk about the next question
10 and answer then:
11 Hattie's tuberculosis that caused her death was
12 and caused by smoking?
13
A.
16
Answer, yes.
Okay?
Okay.
14
15
So your mother told you that

21
22
Object to form.
Yeah.
BY MR. ROSEN:
Q.
Okay.
And historically that's based on
23 what you reviewed from that prior testimony it's
24 inaccurate to say that smoking caused
25 tuberculosis, right?

Well, we're talking
3 about 1951 and I just don't remember when these
4 studies came out about tuberculosis.
5 BY MR. ROSEN:
6 Q. But you said it was 1940s, 1950s, right?
7 A. Well, if I said 1940s, 1950s I was --
8 like I was saying, I don't remember the precise
9 year.
10
Could have been after, could have been
before.

Let's assume you're accurate as a
12 historian and it is -- let's say it's '40s or

That would have been information available

What about his age, he would have been
5 in his early 20s, right, when that statement was
6 made?
7
8
9
A.
Well, let's see.
He would have been,
yeah, mid-to early 20s.
Q.
And he would have been -- according to
10 the reports that you reviewed he started smoking
11 when he was about 12 or 13 years old?
12 A. 13, so, 13, 14, 13, in that range.
13 Q. He was given tobacco by the owner of the
14
15
farm that he worked on?
A.
Yes, or the wife of the owner.
I'm not
16 sure if it was the owner, but it was somebody in
17 charge, yeah.
18
19
20
21
22
Q.
But it was given to him for medicinal
purposes, right, for his stomach?
A.
According to the depositions, according
to the sister's deposition.
Q.
And that's something consistent with
23 your review of the historical records that there
24 were reports in that timeframe in the 1920s,
25 1930s where there were beneficial uses of

Q.
So I mean, that was -- seems like that
Well, I'm not talking about scientific
literature.
I'm just talking about just in
10 general, would you think that there was
11 information that led people to believe that there
12 were benefits using tobacco in the 1930s and
13 1940s?
14 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
15 THE WITNESS:
Overwhelmingly it was
16 on the negative side.
17 see about smoking -- well, I don't know if I --
18 I'm trying to think if there were things that
19 were regarded as beneficial.
20 that, you know, smoking reduced tension.
21 haven't seen anything much more than that.

A.
Well, I don't have a reliance list in

13 much focused on the news, keeping track of the

Q.
But I know
He was somebody that was tied in with his
So I can't specifically
Is there anything that you say there's

2 to.
3 know like are you going to go to trial and say I

5 a very, very high probability that he looked at

I understand that concept.

I don't know if I can

So just as far as his level
4 of reading you're not exactly sure what his
5 actual level of reading was, right?

8 picked up reading skills.

11 studies.
12 had good reading ability.

What was his level of education based on
your review of the records?
A.
His level of education?
He dropped out
of school when he was about 14.
17 Q. Where do you get the age of 14 from?
18 A. That is from the school records.
19 Q. So is it your testimony you believe the
20 records in the -- the school records, is that
21 inconsistent with testimony of him dropping out
22 in the fourth grade?
23
A.
It is consistent because he was -- he
24 was in the fourth grade but he was 14,
25 thereabouts.

Doctor, are there any other
12 major opinions or conclusions that you intend to
13 offer at trial?
14 to go through the history -- my experience with
15 historians at trial is you kind of give a history
16 of what was out in the public, you know, what
17 Mr. Robertson would have been exposed to.
18 are there any other specific opinions that you
19 have with respect to him that I need to know
20 about?
21 A.
I understand that you're going
But
Well, my opinion of Dr. Robertson was
22 that he -- Dr. Robertson -- Mr. Robertson, was
23 that he was exposed to the health dangers of
24 smoking from an early point, that he was somebody
25 that -- that was very interested in the news,

4 about the fact that cigarette smoking was harmful
5 from an early stage.
6 these -- these sources of information included
7 the union, included his church, included news
8 reports and television and radio and would
9 include newspapers as well as his family members.

2 Q. Is there any specific book or document
3 that you're going to say this was used at his
4 specific school and he would have been exposed to
5 it?
6 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
7 THE WITNESS:
I can't link a
8 specific document to, you know, a specific
9 school.
I can comment on what was -- you know,
10 what were the textbooks that were being used,
11 what was the kind of thing that was out there
12 that was part of the kind of school, you know,
13 the general educational environment at that time.
14 But I can't pick something and link it to him
15 directly.

You know, that's a good point.
No, I

4
No, just part of his biography, who he
was.
Q.
And you and Mr. Rosen also talked about
5 the educational records that you reviewed for Dr.
6 Robertson.
7 A.
Do you recall that?
For Mr. Robertson.
8 MR. ROSEN:
9 MS. KANE:
10
11
12
Mr. Robertson.
Oh, I did it too.
THE WITNESS:
You're promoting him.
BY MS. KANE:
Q.
Did you see from those medical records
13 the ages of the other children who were in
14 Mr. Robertson's grade?
15
Sorry.
A.
Yeah, I saw that, but I don't recall
16 what those -- what those ages were.
They seemed
17 to be about the same age from what I could see.
18 Q. The same age as Mr. Robertson?
19 A. Yeah, but I need to look at those again.
20 Q. Okay.
And you and Mr. Rosen discussed
21 industry statements in newspaper articles.
22 you recall that generally?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. Where in the articles did those
25
Do

7
A.
Typically towards the end of the
article.
Q.
How long were those statements in
relation to the rest of the article?
A.
Might be a paragraph, maybe two, but
usually just one.
Q.
Do you know anything about the
8 circumstances that led newspapers to publish
9 statements from the tobacco industry?
10 A. No.
No, I don't.
11 Q. In your research have you seen polling
12 data indicating what the general public believed
13 about the tobacco industry as being a source of
14 information?
15 A. Yes, I have.
16 Q. And what does that polling data show?
17 A. Well, there were a couple of polls done
18 around 1960, I think the Roper poles, and they
19 would ask questions like who -- who would you go
20 to -- who would you most trust for health
21 information or not just health information,
22 information about whether or not smoking causes
23 lung cancer.
24 organizations and entities such as the American
25 Medical Association, the American Cancer Society,
And it would ask about various
United Reporting, Inc.

61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 63
1 Sloan-Kettering Institute and so forth.
2 would also ask about the tobacco industry or the
3 Tobacco Industry Research Council, would ask
4 about that as well.
5
Q.
And it
And what did the actual data show as to
6 who the general public relied on for smoking and
7 health information?
8
9
A.
Overwhelmingly it relied on groups like
the American Medical Association, like the
10 American Cancer Society, like the public health
11 service.
12 was down there I think at 3 percent in this that
13 particular poll, might have been 2 percent.
14
And Tobacco Industry Research Council
And then there were other polls, I think it
15 was connected to this one, who would you least go
16 to for information, an overwhelming first choice
17 was the tobacco industry.
18 Tobacco Industry Research Council.
19 it asked about tobacco industry per se, Tobacco
20 Industry Research Council.
21 one of who you would at least go to, something
22 like 57 percent, just a blow out.
23 other sources were down there.
24
25
Q.
I think it was the
I don't think
And that was number
And then these
In your review of the materials for this
case, did you see any evidence that Mr. Robertson

61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 64

actually saw any tobacco advertisements?
2 A. No.
3 Q. Did you see any evidence in the
4 materials that you reviewed that he relied on
5 advertising in making decisions about smoking?
6 A. No, I did not.
7 Q. In your research for this case, did you
8 determine whether the State of Georgia had any
9 laws concerning providing underaged people with
10
11
cigarettes?
A.
Yeah, they had a law came in about 1889
12 that prohibited the giving of tobacco products to
13 minors by adults.
14
15
Q.
Would that law have been in effect when
Mr. Robertson received his very first cigarette?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. As part of your work on this case, did
18
you research educational materials in Georgia?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Did you look at textbooks that were
21 approved for use in Georgia at the time
22 Mr. Robertson attended school?
23 A. Yes, I did.
24 Q. And what can you tell us about what was
25
being taught about smoking during the 1930s and

61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 65

2
'40s when Mr. Roberts was in school?
A.
Well, their consistent theme in the
3 textbooks was that nicotine was depicted as a
4 poison and as the -- the agent that made
5 cigarettes habit forming or addictive; that
6 cigarettes were often grouped under the category
7 of narcotic, put in the same, you know, category
8 essentially, overall category; that they were
9 depicted as something that would shorten your
10 life, that would cause respiratory problems, and
11 various other kinds of health problems.
12
13
Q.
And how did you determine that -- well,
strike that.
14 Are these textbooks on your reliance list?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. How did you determine that the textbooks
17 on your reliance list were approved for use in
18 Georgia during the time that Mr. Robertson
19 attended school?
20
A.
Georgia had statewide adoption during
21 that period and every five years or so they would
22 adopt textbooks and you could get most of those.
23
24
25
Q.
In your work on this case, did you also
look at textbooks approved for use in Florida?
A.
Yes, I did.

8 A. Yes.
9 Q. Did you see any evidence in this case
10 that Mr. Robertson was affiliated with a
11 particular religion?
12
13
14
A.
Yeah, he was a member of the Baptist
church.
Q.
Did the Baptist church ever take the

20
A.
Yes, it did, including the Black Baptist
Association, which his church was a member.
Q.
Did the Baptist church publish materials
on the health dangers of smoking?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. In your research, tell us about the
23 religious materials that you found that address

954.525.2221
61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 72
1 from a publication which was the national
2 publication of the National Baptist Convention,
3 and they had a publication called National
4 Baptist Voice and they had articles -- earliest
5 one, I didn't go all the way back to the
6 beginning, but the one I found was 19 -- I found
7 one 1949 and then I found several later as well.

Q.
Dr. Beito, tell us what Exhibit I is
please.
A.
Well, this is a -- an article from the
21 National Baptist Voice, which is the official

1 over to page 15, and it's called Facts About
2 Cigarettes.
3
MR. ROSEN:
Before you go into it,
4 can you just tell me so I can try to find it in
5 the folder that I'm looking at right now, would
6 it be under newspapers, periodicals, national
7 public health, where would it be?
8
9
MS. KANE:
I think, Dr. Beito can
correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it would be
10 under case specific materials and then there
11 should be a sub folder for additional case
12 specific materials.
13
MR. ROSEN:
No, I see Robertson --
14 city records and then Miami city directories.
15 What papers would it be?
16
MS. KANE:
Oh, I know where it is.
17 There's a folder called periodicals.
18 MR. ROSEN:
19 MS. KANE:
20
Okay.
And then there should be
a sub folder that says National Baptist Voice.
21 MR. ROSEN:
22 MS. KANE:
Okay, I got it here.
So this is an article --
23 I don't know how it's described but this is an
24 article from 1949.

MR. ROSEN:
What page are we looking

2 THE WITNESS:
3 MS. KANE:
4
It was page 2 and 15.
It's only a two-page
document.

Is it like very hard to

7 MS. KANE:
8 THE WITNESS:
9
10
Ish.
Yeah, from microfilm,
a poor copy on a microfilm probably is where I
got that.
11
MR. ROSEN:
Again, I can't -- what
12 I'm looking at right now is a 60-page document
13 and so I don't -- I can't see what it is that
14 we're looking at.
15 go so I can find it.
16 right now?
17
18
19
Just tell me where I need to
MS. KANE:
What are you looking at
describe it.
Well, I'll let Dr. Beito
He's holding it.
THE WITNESS:
All right.
Well, it
20 is an article from this publication, National
21 Baptist Voice, published in 1949, should be the
22 first article in that list of articles from that
23 publication or in that reproduction.
24 article called Facts About Cigarettes.
25 has information in there about the history of the

This was in 1949
Yes.
Okay.
BY MS. KANE:
Q.
And I don't remember if you testified to
this already, Dr. Beito, but will you tell us
what the National Baptist Voice is?
A.
It is the periodical of the National
12 Baptist Convention, USA, which is the main
13 Baptist convention for African-American Baptist
14 churches and Mr. Robertson's church.
15 belonged to it and some churches like Martin
16 Luther King's church was part of it.
17
Q.
Churches
And from the work you did in this case
18 were you able to determine how the National
19 Baptist Voice was disseminated?
20
A.
Yeah, the National Baptist Voice would
21 be sent to individual members in some cases and
22 in other cases it would be sent to the church
23 itself and it would be available there at the
24 church.
25

2 A. Yes, it does.
3 Q. What does it say about the 1964 Surgeon

General's report?
A.
Well, it gives -- it gives the sort of

It's very hard to
Dr. Beito, did you see evidence in this
16 case that Mr. Robertson listened to news on the
17 radio?
18 A.
Yes.
19 Q.
And as part of your research, did you
20 look at whether radio stations broadcast
21 information about smoking and health?
22 A. Yes, I did.
23 Q. Tell us what you found, please.
24 A. Well, radio history, it's hard to find
25
stuff for, you know, the earlier you go back.

Q.
Based on the case materials you reviewed
19 here was there evidence that Mr. Robertson
20 belonged to a union of any kind?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. And which unions did he belong to?
23 A. Well, there were two unions out there.
24 One was for the tenders, the assistants, the ones
25 that would be the helpers I guess you could say,
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221
61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 81
1 mixings the mortar and that kind of thing.
2 then there was another union that if you were a
3 plasterer, which Mr. Robertson became according
4 to the depositions at one point, that was a
5 separate union.
6
Q.
Okay.
And
And did you in your research for
7 this case come across union publications that
8 addressed the risk of smoking?
9 A. Yes, I did.
10 Q. And during what time period did union
11
12
publications discuss the risks of smoking?
A.
From the 1950s all the way, I think we
13 went up to the -- looked up to the 1980s, early
14 1980s, perhaps longer, but that was the focus.
15
16
17
Q.
And what was the name of the plasterers'
union publication?
A.
I'm trying to remember what it was
18 called myself.
I'm drawing a blank, but it was
19 the plasterers, bricklayers and masons' union.
20 forget what their publication was called.
21 might have been The Plasterer, but I'm not sure
22 about that.
23 Q.
I
It
In your review of union publications,
24 did you see -- union publications that contained
25 articles that discussed the risk of smoking, did

954.525.2221
61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 82
1
you see any tobacco industry statements?
2 A. No.
3 Q. And what is your understanding based on
4 your review of information in this case as to
5 where those union publications would have been
6 available?
7 A.
Well, in the case of the tenders, the
8 laborers' union that he belonged to at one point,
9 those were mailed to every member.
In terms of
10 the other union, it's a little unclear but they
11 would have certainly been available at the union
12 hall where Mr. Robertson spent a fair amount of
13 time because you had to be in the union, you had
14 to get approval from the union hall for many of
15 these jobs to work on the job.
16
Q.
In your work on this case, Dr. Beito,
17 did you research whether newspapers published
18 articles on the dangers of smoking?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Did you find articles in Georgia
21 newspapers from the 1950s that discussed the
22 risks of smoking?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. Did you also review Georgia newspapers
25
that were targeted to African-Americans?

Q.
Was the Atlanta Daily World available in
6 the part of Georgia where Mr. Robertson was
7 living?
8 A. Yes, it was.
9 Q. How do you know that?
10 A. I spoke to the local museum there which
11 had some people that, you know, were experts in
12 that area and said, you know, it was available.
13
Q.
And are the Georgia newspapers that you
14 reviewed that discussed the dangers of smoking on
15 your reliance list?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. As part of your work on this case, did
18 you review newspapers in Florida that discussed
19 the dangers of smoking?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. Which ones did you review?
22 A. Oh, quite a few.
One of the ones would
23 be certainly the Miami Herald, the Miami News,
24 which is the African-American newspaper, the
25 Hialeah paper, Mr. Robertson's church at one

954.525.2221
61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 84
1 point was there.
2 I looked at, some of the other ones outside of
3 Miami as well.
4
Q.
Those would be some of the ones
Was there evidence that the Miami Herald
5 was a newspaper that was in the Robertson
6 household?
7 A.
Yes, according to one of the
8 depositions, one of the sons said that it was in
9 the home he purchased.
10
11
12
Q.
Did the Miami Herald publish any
articles on the 1964 Surgeon General's report?
A.
Yes, it had quite a few, including the
13 headline story the day after the report was
14 issued.
15
Q.
And did newspapers in Miami continue to
16 cover the health dangers of smoking throughout
17 the 1960s?
18 A. Yes, they did.
19 Q. Did they continue, did those newspapers
20 continue to cover the health danger of smoking
21 throughout the 1970s and 1980s?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Are those articles on your reliance

Q.
Did you see evidence in this case
2 indicating whether Mr. Robertson watched
3 television news?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. Did he?
6 A. Yes, he did.
He would not only watch
7 the news, he would watch -- according to the
8 depositions he would watch the whole program and
9 more than once a day.
10
11
Q.
Was the 1964 Surgeon General's report
covered on network television?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. How extensively did network televisions
14 cover the release of the Surgeon General's
15 report?
16
17
18
A.
It was a top news story and there were
special reports on its.
Q.
And would that type of television news
19 report have reached a lot of viewers at that
20 time?
21 A. Oh, yes.
22 Q. Did information about the dangers of
23 smoking continue to appear on television news
24 throughout the 1960s?

A.
On an even greater basis over time.

10 A. Yes.
11 Q. In your review of Miami newspaper --

21 Q. Were those -- I'm sorry, did you say
22 that they published antismoking clinics in the
23 newspaper articles?
24

A.
I missed your answer.
There were articles about the -- about a
number of different clinics, including the one at

Hialeah Hospital which was an important one.
Q.
Were those smoking cessation clinics
also publicized on radio and television?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. What was the smoking clinic at the
6
7
Hialeah hospital called, do you remember?
A.
I don't remember if there was a specific
8 name to it, but it dated from about the mid-60s
9 and it was a nationally recognized program that
10 received coverage from the likes of Larry King,
11 did a special show about it.
12
Q.
And who ran the clinic at the Hialeah
13 hospital?
14 A.
It was run by the people who tended to
15 be Seventh Day Adventists, but it didn't have a
16 religious focus.
17 Q. How much did it cost to attend?
18 A. It was free.
19 Q. Do you recall how often those clinics
20
21
were held at Hialeah Hospital?
A.
I believe it was on a weekly basis they
22 would have these, you know, these meetings where
23 people would meet and discuss, a little like
24 Alcoholics Anonymous I guess in some sense.

Q.
In your research did you come across

1 information about what the clinics actually did
2 as part of the program?
3 A. Yes, I did.
4 Q. And tell us about that, please.
5 A. Well, they would have national experts
6 come in, you know, like a Dr. Tate, people that
7 were prominent Florida and national scientists
8 talk about the dangers of smoking.

Do you have any of the movies they
showed on your reliance list?

15 A. Countdown.
16 Q. As part of your work on this case, did
17 you also determine whether the Hialeah Hospital
18 offered any quit smoking hotlines?
19 A. Yes, they did.
20 Q. And tell us about that.
21 A. Well, it was a phone, you know, phone
22 hotline that you could call that would give
23 encouragement.
24 geared, partly because -- you know, I've done
25 some research on Seventh Day Adventists because
The whole hospital was kind of

2 were very strongly antismoking, prohibited
3 smoking in the hospital, any on the hospital
4 grounds, and it had a lot of closed circuit

BY MR. ROSEN:
Q.
Dr. Beito, you were just asked some
15 questions by Jennifer Kane who represents R.J.
16 Reynolds Tobacco Company in this case.
17 understand that?
Do you
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. And she asked you about information that
20 was available to the public in the '40s, '50s,
21 '60s, '70s and '80s; is that right?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. And she talked to you about information
24 that was available in Georgia when Mr. Robertson
25 was growing up, right?
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221
61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 90
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. She asked you about information that was
3 a available in the 1950s and going forward in
4 time in Florida that was available -- that was
5 available to the public during that timeframe,
6 right? 7 A. Yes.
8 Q. So I want to go through a few of those
9
things.
First off, you were asked about some --
10 a public school book in Florida that was
11 published in the 1960s.
12 line of questioning?
Do you remember that
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. That book I think is called Modern
15
Health, right?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. That would have been a book that
18 Mr. Robertson's children would have been exposed
19 to, right?
20 A.
Probably.
It was one of the books that
21 was assigned, but I can't -- I can't definitely
22 say they read it or anything.
23
Q.
Okay.
As far as Mr. Robertson though,
24 it's -- that was something that his kids may have
25 been exposed to, not him, right?

3
A.
I don't know if he was exposed to it or
not.
Q.
Okay.
And as far as what that book
4 actually says about whether smoking is harmful or
5 not, did you look at that information?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. And did you notice that there were prior
8 versions of that book, right, the Modern Health
9 book?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. Like, for instance, there was a 1963
12
version on your list, right?
13 A. Uh-huh.
14 Q. And that one talked about tobacco use,
15 right? 16 A. Yes.
17 Q. And you also saw that there were
18 arguments for and against smoking that were
19 identified in that school book, right?
20
A.
I vaguely remember that, but I don't
21 remember what the arguments that were made on
22 each side were specifically.
23 vaguely remember the arguments was something like
24 it reduces tension or something like that.
25
Q.
I think they -- I
Like, for instance, one of the arguments

Object to form.
7 THE WITNESS:
I don't remember that,
8 but I don't have it in front of me.
9 BY MR. ROSEN:
10
Q.
You don't have any reason to disagree
11 that that would be identified in the Modern
12 Health book which is identified on your list as
13 Modern Health, Otto, J, et al., 1.
14 MS. KANE:

BY MR. ROSEN:
16 Q. Right?
17 A. No, I don't.
18 Q. And then -- all right.
I lost my page.

20 another argument for smoking, right?
21 MS. KANE:

That's why some people say they

And so on the why I don't smoke

9 against smoking.

Yes, but the overall focus of that book
10 was on the health -- on the harms created by
11 smoking.
12
Q.
Well, but again, at the bottom of the
13 first chapter, it talks about the arguments for
14 and against smoking, right?
15 debate going on about some people wanting to
16 smoke and some people that are against smoking,
17 right?
18
19
MS. KANE:
MR. ROSEN:
Yeah, chapter 14, the
first page.
22
THE WITNESS:
23 that?

25
Can you point to a
particular page?
20
21
So there's still a
Q.
Okay, what page is
168.

1
A.
Well, if you look at that, it has that
2 list that you were talking about here, why I
3 smoke, why I don't smoke, and those are all --
4 those aren't health arguments made as much as it
5 will quiet my nerves, it's something I enjoy,
6 that kind of thing.
7 the arguments on those next pages from what I'm
8 seeing here, it's emphasizing the case against
9 tobacco over and over again here.
10
11
Q.
And then if you look at all
One of the things it says in the column
why I smoke is advertising invited me, right?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. And on the next page if you go down,
14
actually go two pages forward --
15 A. Okay.
16 Q. -- it says reaction to the report.
17
Do
you see that?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. And it says the report of the committee
20
caused people to look at the facts, right?
21 A. Uh-huh.
22 Q. It talks about the National Institute of
23 Health, many universities, foundations and the
24 American Medical Association, right?
25
A.
Yes.

1
Q.
And then the last sentence says:
The
2 tobacco industry itself has financed many
3 research projects carried out by health agencies,
4 right?
5 A.
Yes.
6 Q.
Do you know if the research projects
7 that were carried out by the tobacco industry, do
8 you know if they are referring to the tobacco
9 industry research committee?
10 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
11 THE WITNESS:
I don't know what they
12 are referring to but that might be what they are
13 referring to.
14 BY MR. ROSEN:
15
Q.
Is it just based on your review of the
16 historical records that more likely than not that
17 what they're referring to is the TIRC or the CTR?
18 MS. KANE:
19 THE WITNESS:
20 say.
21 BY MR. ROSEN:
22

It's hard for me to

Q.
Were the overwhelming research projects
23 that were conducted by the tobacco industry,
24 based on your research was that the TIRC?

THE WITNESS:
I didn't look at the,
2 you know, what the spending was and that kind of
3 thing.
4 and the Tobacco Industry Research Council was
5 mentioned.
6 BY MR. ROSEN:
7
Q.
Certainly I looked at the news coverage
And do you know if the Tobacco Industry
8 Research Council or the Council For Tobacco
9 Research, do you know if they were actually
10 conducting legitimate science or if they were
11 acting as a front organization?
12 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
13 THE WITNESS:
I didn't look at the
14 history of that organization, what it funded and
15 what kinds of projects and that kind of thing.
16 BY MR. ROSEN:
17
Q.
And then it goes down to -- at the
18 bottom it says impact of report.
19 that?
Do you see
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. Now, you testified on direct examination
22 that there were no statements by the tobacco
23 companies, right?
24 A. That was my memory, yes.
25 Q. Okay.
And if we look down here, it
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221
61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 100
1 says -- it talks about impact of the report,
2 right? 3 A. Uh-huh, uh-huh.
4 Q. And at the bottom of that page it says:
5 Surveys made one year after the Surgeon General's
6 report showed a decline of two or three percent
7 in the number of smokers.
8 Did I read that accurately?
9 A.
Yes.
10 Q.
Okay.
And then it states right below
11 that:
12 and advertising budget by tobacco companies of
13 millions of dollars shows that some are taking
14 tobacco hazards seriously.
This, in the face of increased population
15 Right?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. And so based upon this document here,
18
this would be a school book, right?
19 A. Yes, it would.
20 Q. This is pointing out the fact that the
21 tobacco companies are -- have increased their
22 budget on advertising, right?
23 MS. KANE:
24 THE WITNESS:

2 don't think it has a precise figure there as to
3 whether -- you know, how much they have increased
4 or whether they have increased.
5 vague I think.
6 BY MR. ROSEN:
7
Q.
I
It's a little
It says that there was a drop by two or
8 three percent and then they say this is in the
9 face of increased population and advertising
10 budgets by tobacco companies of millions of
11 dollars.
12 Did I read that right?
13 A.
And advertising budgets, yes.
It
14 doesn't -- I don't see an evaluation as to
15 whether they have increased or not.
16
Q.
So you think the sentence should read
17 this in the face of advertising budgets by
18 tobacco companies of millions of dollars?

2 way.
3 BY MR. ROSEN:
4
Q.
You could view it that
And you know it's a fact historically
5 that even after the 1964 Surgeon General report
6 linked smoking to lung cancer, you know that the
7 cigarette industry actually ramped up their
8 advertising of cigarettes, right?
9
MS. KANE:
10
Object to form.
THE WITNESS:
I -- I haven't seen
11 evidence that the amount of advertising went up
12 in reaction to the report.
13 certainly -- tobacco companies are certainly
14 advertising. They are spending a lot of money on
15 advertising. But I haven't seen evidence that
16 they are ramping it up strategically or anything
17 like that. 18 BY MR. ROSEN:
19
Q.
Advertising is
And that's because you've never looked
20 at the internal company documents to see what
21 they did in response to the Surgeon General
22 report, right?

I have not, but I've

2 after specific reports are issued and that kind
3 of thing.
4 BY MR. ROSEN:
5
Q.
And I saw no evidence of a change.
So it's your testimony you don't think
6 there was increased advertising of cigarettes
7 after the 1964 Surgeon General report?
8 MS. KANE:
Object to form.

No, that's not my

I don't know -- what I
16 have done is I've looked at whether or not
17 advertising, you know, just tried to count the
18 number of ads, whether they go up.
19 there is a spurt after a specific news story like
20 the Surgeon General's report and I saw no

No, I -- increases in

But certainly there
Precise amounts, I don't

Now, one of the last pages here, if you
14 go down a few pages to page 174 at the upper
15 left-hand corner, do you see that?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. It says:
18
Tobacco manufactures are
trying to reduce the hazards.
19 Did I read that right?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. And they are spending large sums of
22
money in research.
23 Did I read that right?

2 TIRC or the CTR?
3 MS. KANE:

4 THE WITNESS:
I'm not sure whether
5 it refers to research, TIRC, or refers to
6 research in things like, you know, other -- you
7 know, changing the kind of tobacco produced and
8 so forth.
9 BY MR. ROSEN:
10
Q.
And from your review of the historical
11 record at the time in 1967 when this would have
12 been out, what was the tobacco company's public
13 position concerning the health hazards of
14 smoking?
15 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
16 THE WITNESS:
Well, as I said there
17 were two main arguments they made.
One was we
18 have a -- we might have an association but that
19 doesn't mean we have causation, and then also
20 that we need more research.
21 example, we agree with -- they tried to say we
22 agree with the Surgeon General, but did in fact
23 say we need more research.
24 yeah, we need more research, we agree with them.

Q.
So it's your testimony that the tobacco
2 companies agreed with the conclusions of the 1964
3 Surgeon General report?
4 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
5 THE WITNESS:
No, that's not my --
6 that's not my testimony.
7 that statement out and said we agree more
8 research is needed.
9 with the Surgeon General's report.
10
11
12
They picked that --
So no, they did not agree
BY MR. ROSEN:
Q.
In fact, the cigarette industry denied
that cigarette smoking caused cancer, right?
13 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
14 THE WITNESS:
Well, the arguments
15 were twofold.
16 be an association but we haven't proved it yet,
17 whether there's causation, and we need more
18 research.
19 BY MR. ROSEN:
20
Q.
One they would say we -- there may
Well, you know that in 1967 they weren't
21 saying there was an association, they were saying
22 that we don't believe cigarettes are hazardous to
23 your health, right?

Object to form.

I don't know in '64 if

61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 107
1 I see that kind of argument out there.
2 more of those two kinds of arguments, well, we
3 need more research, maybe there's an association
4 here, there could be an association.
5 they often concede there was, but we still
6 haven't proven causation.
7 thrust of what they were saying.

9 BY MR. ROSEN:
10
Q.
I see
In fact
That would be the
We need more
So it's your testimony that cigarette
11 companies in the 1960s were saying that there
12 could be an association to smoking and lung
13 cancer, right?
14 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
15 THE WITNESS:
That there could be a
16 causation?
17 know yet, we -- we haven't had enough research.
18 BY MR. ROSEN:
19
Q.
Yeah, because they would say we don't
And you recall them saying that we don't
20 believe that there's anything harmful and if
21 there is anything harmful we'll remove it, right?

7 that specifically.
8 BY MR. ROSEN:

No, I don't remember

10 A. What I remember is like I said, the
11 thrust of the argument is we don't know yet, we
12 need more research.
13
Q.
All right.
And then the thrust of the
14 argument you would defer to what the tobacco
15 representatives said on television such as Face
16 the Nation?
17
A.
What they -- you know, again, I need to
18 review what they said specifically in that
19 program, but I'm looking at other statements that

4 A. It wasn't very specific.

7 doesn't mean that the statement wasn't made,

14 Q.
Okay.
And he testified on page 124,

2 others in the union took this information
3 seriously, passed it on to others.
4
Q.
So I asked you about his level of
5 reading and you said he may have gathered some.
6 But you remember the testimony from his son
7 Thomas on page 10, excuse me, page 123, line 10
8 through 13, did your father read on a regular
9 basis, answer, my father really couldn't read

Do you remember that testimony?

You do agree his level of reading is --
20 there's conflicting testimony about his level of

22 Q. And that would have been information
23
available to him, right?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. And now you know from the review of the

1 testimony in this case that starting at least in
2 the 1980s, Mr. Robertson -- or late '70s, 1980s,
3 Mr. Robertson began trying to quit smoking,
4 right?
5 A.
According to the depositions, yes.
6 Q.
Now, also it's historical fact that the
7 message, the health message associated with
8 smoking, increased from the 1960s to the 1970s to
9 the 1980s, right?
10 MS. KANE:
11 THE WITNESS:
12 health dangers increased.

Q.
Okay.
Object to form.
The emphasis on the
In other words, the dangers of --
15 associated with smoking and the publication of
16 those dangers, they increased over time, right?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. Now, you do know there wasn't a unified
19 message in the '60s, '70s and '80s concerning the
20 health hazards of smoking, right?
21 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
22 THE WITNESS:
The overwhelming
23 message being communicated by news sources, by
24 government sources, by religious sources was that
25 cigarette smoking was dangerous, could shorten --

2 sorts of diseases.

5
Q.
And -- but you also know that there was
a controversy that was going on, right?
6 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
7 THE WITNESS:
I wouldn't use those
8 words.
I think you have the overwhelming message
9 being blasted out is that this is very dangerous,
10 PSAs, news stories, et cetera, overwhelming
11 emphasis is on the negative side.
12 call that a controversy.
13 BY MR. ROSEN:
14
15
Q.
So I wouldn't
But you are familiar with the cigarette
controversy though, right?
16 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
17 THE WITNESS:
Again, I wouldn't use
18 the term "controversy."
19 that think well, we don't have enough evidence?
20 Yes, but those are getting fewer and fewer over
21 time and are drowned out essentially by those
22 that are arguing contrary point of view.
23 BY MR. ROSEN:
24
25
Q.
Are there some people
Some people that say there isn't enough
evidence, that included the tobacco companies,

right?
2 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
3 THE WITNESS:
It would -- yeah, it
4 would -- the industry statements and statements
5 from the TIRC would make that argument.
6 BY MR. ROSEN:
7 Q. As well as the Tobacco Institute, right?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. And those were the industry
10 representatives at the Tobacco Institute, they
11 would issue statements that would get picked up
12 in the news, right?
13 A. With decreasing frequency, but yes.
14 Q. The point I'm trying to make is you know
15 that there were mixed messages concerning the
16 health hazards of smoking in the '60s, '70s and
17 '80s and '90s, right?
18 MS. KANE:
19 THE WITNESS:
20 a mixed message at all.
21 BY MR. ROSEN:
22
Q.
Object to form.
No, I wouldn't call it
You do know that -- well, what would you
23 call it when one side is saying cigarettes are
24 harmful and the other side is saying it hasn't
25 been proven to be harmful?
Would you say that

954.525.2221
61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 119
1
that's not a mixed message?
2 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
3 THE WITNESS:
I think that
4 there's -- that you have one side that is
5 emphasizing the negative side and that is -- that
6 is blasting out from multiple sources and it
7 overwhelms any other perspective.
8 BY MR. ROSEN:
9
Q.
Are you saying that there was no debate
10 that was going on in the '60s, '70s and '80s
11 concerning whether cigarettes are harmful or not?
12 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
13 THE WITNESS:
There were some people
14 saying that, with a decreasing frequency, saying
15 that it had not been proven yet, but they are
16 very much in the minority position, and people
17 are getting multiple sources of information that
18 are drowning out, really, any other information,
19 that this is bad for you, it will shorten your
20 life, it will kill you and it's associated with
21 an increasing menu of health problems.
22 BY MR. ROSEN:
23
Q.
And the cigarette companies were one of
24 the groups that were -- as you were saying they
25 were on the other side of the issue.
They

2 life and are harmful, right?
3 that?
4 MS. KANE:
5 THE WITNESS:
They weren't saying
Object to form.
Well, the focus that
6 they had were on -- was on the issue of lung
7 cancer.
8 and their argument was -- the typical argument
9 like I said was we have association possibly but
That was where the debate was centered
10 not causation and we need more research.
11 BY MR. ROSEN:
12
Q.
Well, that's not the only issue they
13 were dealing with with lung cancer, they were
14 dealing with all different types of issues,
15 right?
16 remember them on the other side of the issue
17 concerning the different health hazards?
Specifically R.J. Reynolds, do you
18 MS. KANE:

20 most of what I've seen relates to the issue of
21 lung cancer.

Do you remember the CEO of R.J. Reynolds
7 Tobacco Company going on television in the
8 mid-80s to talk about the health hazards of
9 smoking?
10
A.
I don't remember that specifically.
I

12 companies being interviewed and that kind of
13 thing.

Okay.
And you said that really the

2 some questions.
Okay?
3 A. Okay.
4 Q. You are aware that Mr. Horrigan spoke on
5 Ted Koppel that cigarettes hadn't been proven to
6 cause lung cancer, true?
7 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
8 THE WITNESS:
I don't remember that
9 specifically but if that -- you know, I think
10 that those -- those are the two main arguments
11 and I wouldn't be surprised that he was making
12 those kinds of arguments.

Eric, I object to this
14 whole line of questioning.

Doctor, based upon just watching this

21 recollection that Mr. Horrigan denied that
22 cigarettes caused heart disease?

2 answer questions about it.
3 BY MR. ROSEN:
4
Q.
Do you remember statements -- I'm going
5 to ask you the questions so you don't have to
6 refer to the video, but do you remember
7 statements in the 1980s that Mr. Horrigan, the
8 CEO of R.J. Reynolds, denied that smoking caused
9 lung cancer?

MS. KANE:

Do you remember statements made by R.J.
16 Reynolds Tobacco Company or their representatives
17 that smoking didn't cause heart disease?
18
A.
I remember statements broadly, and I
19 don't know if I can link it to RJR specifically,
20 but that we have an association but not
21 necessarily a causation, we need more research,
22 the jury is still out, things like that.
23
Q.
And do you remember R.J. Reynolds or
24 their representative in the 1980s saying that
25 cigarettes -- it hasn't been proven that

cigarettes cause emphysema?
2 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
3 THE WITNESS:
Well, the thrust of it
4 was lung cancer, but I think other issues might
5 have been touched on as well. But the thrust of
6 it was certainly lung cancer. I don't remember
7 those specifically. 8 BY MR. ROSEN:
9
Q.
And you do -- you did see the CEOs of
10 the tobacco companies in 1994 testifying in front
11 of Congress, right?
12 congressional hearings?
You remember the
13 A. Yeah, I've seen those.
14 Q. And you know that they publically denied
15
16
that cigarettes were addictive, right?
A.
Yes, they denied that it was addictive.
17 But then some of them said, well, that doesn't
18 mean it's not habit forming.
19
20
Q.
And that's what they said when they were
questioned about whether it was addictive or not?
21 MS. KANE:

2 lung cancer?
3 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
4 THE WITNESS:
I'm trying to remember
5 if that issue was discussed.
I certainly
6 remember that they -- you know, where they were
7 asked that very specific question about the
8 addictive quality of smoking, but I -- my memory
9 is that they made those same kinds of arguments,
10 we don't have the evidence yet.
11 BY MR. ROSEN:

It talks about how moderate smokers
don't crave the smoke, right?

I would want
Q.
I need to
I'm going to ask you some questions
13 about -- we were talking about the different
14 statements that were made in the '70s, '80s, '90s
15 from public health and the tobacco companies.
16 you remember that line of questioning?
17 A. Yeah.
18 Q. Okay.
Do
And I asked you about whether
19 there were mixed messages about cigarette smoking
20 and you said there were not.
21
A.
I would not use that terminology to
22 describe it.
23 terminology.
24
25
Q.
Is that true?
I don't think that's an accurate
You do know though that Irene Robertson
did use that terminology, right?
United Reporting, Inc.

61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 127
1
2
3
A.
I remember from the depositions she used
that terminology.
Q.
And her testimony was that there were
4 mixed messages about the harmful effects of
5 smoking, right?
6
A.
She said that initially it was -- she
7 believed that it was harmful and then she had
8 doubt and then she believed again later it was
9 not harmful.
10
11
But it was very unclear as to when
the sequence of events were to me at least.
Q.
But the fact is though that there was a
12 point in time where she reported hearing mixed
13 messages about whether cigarettes or harmful or
14 not harmful, right?
15 MS. KANE:
16 THE WITNESS:
17 that's what she says.
18 BY MR. ROSEN:
19
Q.
Object to form.
In the testimony
And you actually made a note in -- on
20 your notes that on page 307 she talks about this
21 mixed message, right?
22
A.
That's entirely possible.
I don't
23 remember what I wrote in there.
My memory is
24 getting shorter and shorter as I get older, but
25 I'll take your word for it.

61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 128
1
Q.
That's fine.
So you made a note on 307
2 that she wrote -- she talks about mixed messages.
3 And I'm just going to read this to you.
4 question, on page 306, line 23:
5 that led Mr. Robertson to think that filtered
6 cigarettes were safer?
7 also said that it wasn't harmful anymore with the
8 filter, but in the beginning it was a mixed
9 message, there was and it wasn't.
It says
Answer:
So what was it
Because it was
And when it
10 come out in the '80's, then that's when they were
11 saying that they are not harmful.
12 filter came out, and so that's when he switched.
13 That's why he kept smoking because he tried very
14 hard to quit.
15
Do you remember that testimony?
16 MS. KANE:
17 THE WITNESS:
18 testimony.
19 BY MR. ROSEN:
20
And then the
Q.
Object to form.
I remember the
And do you remember the testimony on
21 page 307 where she was asked did Mr. Robertson
22 ever tell you, did he ever use the term mixed
23 message?
24
25
Answer, yes.
Do you remember that testimony?

1
THE WITNESS:
I remember that that
2 was in some of the latter -- latter depositions
3 or testimony.
4 BY MR. ROSEN:
5
Q.
And so based upon your review of the
6 records, the mixed messages, whether smoking was
7 harmful or not harmful, those reached Mr.
8 Robertson, right?
9
There's testimony about that?
MS. KANE:
10
Object to form.
THE WITNESS:
I -- I don't see the
11 evidence of mixed messages if I look at what is
12 coming out during the period on filters, for
13 example.
14 it's -- it's bad for you, although the public
15 health community and others are saying, well, if
16 you're going to smoke, smoke -- maybe you should
17 smoke a filtered cigarette, maybe it's a lesser
18 evil but it's still an evil.
19 BY MR. ROSEN:
20
21
22
Q.
The overwhelming emphasis is that
What were the cigarette companies saying
about their filters?
A.
Cigarette companies I think were -- from
23 my memory were more saying we're responding to a
24 demand and to, you know, a demand for cigarettes
25 that the public wants these, they want filtered

954.525.2221
61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 130
1 cigarettes.
2 by the public health community.
3
Q.
And a lot of that was being promoted
And do you think that the public
4 perception based upon your review of the
5 historical record is that filtered cigarettes or
6 light cigarettes were actually healthier or safer
7 for them?
8 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
9 THE WITNESS:
They -- I would say
10 more along the lines of a -- they will still kill
11 you but maybe they won't kill you quite as fast.
12 And a warning label is on every one of those ads
13 for filtered cigarette, same warning labels on
14 all the other ones.
15 BY MR. ROSEN:
16
Q.
Do you think that the filtered
17 cigarette, the public perception of the filtered
18 cigarette was that it was a less hazardous
19 cigarette?
20 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
21 THE WITNESS:
22 maybe a little less deadly.
23 BY MR. ROSEN:
Still deadly, but
24
25
Q.
Do you think that's the reason why you
think there was a demand is that people wanted

the less deadly cigarette?
2 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
3 THE WITNESS:
I'm not sure entirely
4 why people demanded filters.
5 statement, you know, some people possibly
6 according to some of the testimony anyway and
7 I've seen this elsewhere too, the tobacco
8 wouldn't get in your mouth and so forth.
9
There's some
Could have been a taste issue, but certainly
10 it's partly the issue of what you said, a feeling
11 that -- or what I would say that it's less deadly
12 that people had.
13 by a number of different sources including the
14 public health community at the time.
15 BY MR. ROSEN:

17 right?
And that was being propagated
And including the cigarette companies,

I don't see them -- excuse
They were advertising their filtered

They were advertising their filtered
2 cigarettes and the levels of tar would be
3 advertised and that kind of thing.
4
5
Q.
And do you know were they advertising
light cigarettes also in the '80s?
6 A. Yes, they were advertising them.
7 Q. And you know that based upon your review
8 of the record and depositions that Mr. Robertson
9 believed that light cigarettes were better for

him, right?
A.
He believed that they were less deadly,
but they were still deadly.
Q.
Well, he never used the word "less
deadly," right?
A.
Yeah, you're true -- that's true with
the depositions are that -- don't use that term.
Q.
I mean, deposition testimony is that he
believed they were safer, right?
A.
According to some of the deposition
testimony, yes.
Q.
Now, you talked -- now, you talked about
22 the clinics and things like that in Hialeah, I
23 guess.
24 A.
25
What was the timeframe for that?
Well, the stop smoking clinic in Hialeah
I think started around '65, mid-60s sometime.

Q.
You know as time progressed and more
2 information came out Mr. Robertson started to try
3 to quit smoking, right?
4
A.
Well, it's a little vague as to when the
5 sequence of events was, but '70s and '80s seems
6 to be where the testimony is the strongest.
7 Q. And in the '90s, right?
8 A. Yeah, uh-huh.
9 Q. And so during those three decades,
10 Mr. Robertson tried a number of different things
11 to quit smoking based upon your review of the
12 deposition testimony, right?
13
A.
Yeah, according to the deposition
14 testimony there were several attempts to quit
15 smoking.
16
Q.
And so in the -- he tried according to
17 some -- according to the deposition testimony he
18 tried -- he met with a spiritualist, right?
19
A.
I remember hypnotism, I don't remember
20 if I remember the spiritualist, but that might
21 have been one of the examples.
22
Q.
I just want to talk about while this
23 information about the health -- the harms of
24 smoking are coming out in the '70s, '80s, and
25 '90s, I want to talk about what Mr. Robertson was

3 Q. Mr. Robertson in the late '70s, '80s,
Okay?
4 and '90s was trying to quit smoking during that
5 time frame, right?
6 A. According to the depositions.
7 Q. And according to the depositions, he
8 tried multiple different things, one which you
9 mentioned was hypnosis, right?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. And one of the things that you also
12
remember was that he got cassette tapes, right?
13 A. Yeah, I remember that.
14 Q. All right.
And so if someone was
15 advertising those cassette tapes that reached him
16 and he tried to use them, right?

Q.

Again, according to
Mr. Robertson also tried to use prayer
to quit smoking, right?
A.
I don't remember that specifically but
24 that -- that that's certainly possible, that the
25 depositions had that.

Q.
You remember hearing about him trying to
use burnt toast?
3 A. Yes, I do.
4 Q. And that was a unique way to try to
5
quit, right?
6 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
7 THE WITNESS:
I don't know how
8 unique it was, but I'd never heard it before.

Q.
You also reviewed reports that he tried
the nicotine gum?
A.
Yeah, some of the testimony indicates
that.
Q.
You also reviewed some testimony that he
used the patch?
16 A. Vaguely I remember that.
17 Q. And so the point I'm trying to make is
18 this information that's coming out in the '70s or
19 '80s or '90s, it's not -- during that timeframe
20 it's not like Mr. Robertson's -- if it's reaching
21 him he's just ignoring it, right?
22 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
23 THE WITNESS:
No, I don't think he's
24 ignoring it, I think he's more and more aware
25 that it's, you know, more and more evidence

1 coming out that it's harmful, increased evidence
2 and he's responding to that.
3 BY MR. ROSEN:
4
5
6
Q.
And his behavioral response to that is
trying to quit, right?
A.
Again, I can't look at what was in his
7 mind but certainly the depositions indicate he
8 was -- there were efforts that he made to quit.
9
Q.
And throughout that time, I'm on a
10 separate subject, if we go into the '60s and '70s
11 and '80s, during that timeframe, the ability for
12 people to smoke in public places was different
13 than it is now, right?
14 MS. KANE:
15 THE WITNESS:

I wasn't in

So you just don't know if people could
smoke in courthouses ever?

You've also read that people
could smoke in hospitals, right?

3 data that was taken by Philip Morris in the 1950s

5
A.
Were you
I went to the legacy site and I looked
6 up some of the polling data that was on the
7 legacy site.
8 would have been commissioned polls.
9 Q.
10 back then?
11 A.
12
13
So I guess those -- some of those
Would those have been publicly available
I'm not sure if they would have been
publicly available or not.
Q.
Have you -- so you know that the legacy
14 site is a document repository for internal
15 documents of the cigarette companies, right?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. That document repository didn't exist
18
19
20
21
before 1999, right?
A.
I don't know when it came about, but
that sounds about right.
Q.
In other words, the internal documents,
22 you know historically they didn't come to light
23 until really the late 1990s, right?

Did you choose not to look at -- did you
17 choose not to look at internal company documents
18 or were you told not to look at internal company
19 documents?
20 A.
I wasn't told anything.
I -- I went on
21 the site because it had information, it had
22 documents, polls and transcripts that would help
23 provide more information about what reached the
24 public.
25
Q.
Did you find press releases from

cigarette companies?
A.
I went to the site for two sources of
3 information.
4 radio and television shows, and the other was
5 polling data.
6 because, you know, news releases may or may not
7 have reached the public.
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
One was the -- the transcripts,
I didn't look for news release
What I did look at was the press and what the
press had to say and whether or not they would
have industry statements in them.
Q.
You did know that that repository legacy
has the internal company documents though, right?
A.
I know it has a wide range of sources,
including internal company --
Q.
And one of the specific sources is the
16 internal confidential documents of the cigarette
17 companies, right?

Q.
You didn't look at those when you went
on legacy, right?
A.
As a historian, I focus on what my
24 research topic is, my research question.
And in
25 this case my research question was what reached
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 the public, what was public awareness and
2 measures of public awareness including polls.
3
Q.
Do you know other than polls whether the
4 cigarette companies' internal memorandum talk
5 about what the public's awareness is?
6
A.
I didn't look at that because I'm more
7 interested in, you know, where the rubber meets
8 the road, what did people actually have available
9 to them.
10 Q. Did you look at the 1967 FTC report?
11 A. It's been a while, but I did look at
12
13
that.
Q.
Did you find that to be a reliable
14 source of information that talked about the level
15 of cigarette advertising and what was reaching
16 the public back then?
17
A.
I would need to review that again, but
18 my general impression of that was that it
19 overemphasized the importance of advertising.
20 But I would need to look at that again and I need
21 to review that again.
22
Q.
It's been a few years.
So you don't think it's a reliable
23 source of information?

Probably depends on

MR. ROSEN:
4 here.
5 BY MR. ROSEN:
6
Q.
But it's been so long
Just give me a moment
Just historically from your review of
7 the records, Mr. Robertson -- I think we were
8 talking about this, had he started smoking around
9 age 13, right?
10 A. 13 or 14, around then.
11 Q. And he started with the roll your own
12
13
cigarettes?
A.
You know, it's a little vague but it
14 sounds -- but my memory of that is that they were
15 roll your own, yes.
16
Q.
And then around his teenage years he
17 switches to a manufactured cigarette.
18 what your recollection of the record is?
Is that
19 A. I -- I don't recall when he switched.
20 Q. You know he switched to Camels though,
21 right? 22 A.
23
24
25
That was one of the --
That was one of the brands he smoked
according to the depositions.
Q.
And the Camels were the ones that he
stuck with until the 1980s, right?

954.525.2221
61ed222a-689f-47e4-94a5-a6940e6e0896Page 144
1
A.
I believe so.
And think there were
2 other brands that he smoked as well at various
3 times, including Chesterfield and Winston and
4 Marlboro, certainly when he switched.
5
6
Q.
And he smoked the reports were about a
pack and half to two packs per day?
7 A.
I'm trying to remember who made those
8 estimates.
9 was a little vague as to what her memories were
I think that Irene was a little -- it
10 since she wasn't a smoker herself.
11 remember where those estimates were made, but I
12 think some people did make statements that it was
13 in that range.
14
Q.
I don't
Well, based upon your review of
15 everything including the medical records and the
16 depositions, can you give me an idea, just an
17 approximate idea of the amount he smoked?
18
A.
It would just depend on the time period
19 and everything, but a pack and a half a day
20 sounds consistent with at least some period of
21 his life during his smoking life, from what the
22 testimony said anyway.
23 on.

MR. ROSEN:
here at my notes.
That's all I've got to go

FURTHER EXAMINATION
BY MS. KANE:
Q.
I'm going to start with Exhibit H, which
is the Modern Health book.
Dr. Beito, do you
10 recall Mr. Rosen asking you about these arguments
11 for and against smoking?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Okay.
In all your review of textbooks
14 that you've done, have you seen rhetorical
15 efforts by book publishers as a teaching tool?
16
17
18
A.
Yes, certainly, to make it -- to get
students to think.
Q.
In your review of this particular
19 chapter, what is your takeaway message from these
20 book publishers about tobacco and cigarette
21 smoking?
22
23
A.
That it overwhelmingly stresses the
negative health consequences.

2
Q.
And anywhere in that textbook does it
advocate smoking because of advertising?
3 A. No.
4 Q. Have you seen any evidence in your
5 review of the materials in this case that
6 Mr. Robertson ever saw any ads from the open
7 debate campaign?
8 A. No.
9 Q. Is there any evidence that he saw any
10
statements by Ed Horrigan?
11 A. No.
12 Q. Is there any evidence that Mr. Robertson
13
saw any statements by R.J. Reynolds?
14 A. No.
15 Q. Do you know whether filtered cigarettes
16
existed before the 1970s?
17 A. Yes, they did.
18 Q. Did you see any evidence in this case
19 that Mr. Robertson ever tried filtered cigarettes
20 before 1982?
21
A.
That's a little vague on what years, but
22 yeah, but no, I didn't see any evidence that he
23 tried it in the earlier period.
24
25
MS. KANE:
Okay.
I don't have
anything else for you, Dr. Beito.

FURTHER EXAMINATION
BY MR. ROSEN:
Q.
You do recall testimony, Doctor, in
8 Irene Robertson's deposition that she recalled
9 tobacco company on the news in the 1980s saying
10
smoking was not harmful, right?
11 MS. KANE:
Object to form.
12 THE WITNESS:
I remember her -- and
13 again, it was just very unclear when, how and
14 where, making a statement that she saw somebody
15 from a tobacco company make a statement.
16 BY MR. ROSEN:
17
Q.
So just, you know, there was no
18 testimony specific as to Ed Horrigan from R.J.
19 Reynolds, but as far as the timeframe that she's
20 talking about and the fact that there's a news
21 program, it could have been that Mr. Robertson
22 saw that program, right?
23 MS. KANE:
24 THE WITNESS:
25
Object to form.
I don't know.
It's
hard to say.
