Sure.

testifying as an expert?
2 A Yes.
3 Q Okay.
4 Let me just review briefly things you probably
5 have already discussed in greater detail than I'm able to,
6 but I'll tell you that the lady sitting to your left and my
7 right is the court reporter who's taking done everything
8 that's being said here.
9
The oath that you have taken to tell the truth
10 is the same oath that you would take in a court of law.
11 will be asking you some questions, and everything that's
12 said in this room is going to be reported and printed up in
13 a booklet form and will be handed to you sometime in the
14 next several weeks.
15
I
You will then have an opportunity to review it,
16 make any changes that you may wish to it and then sign it
17 under penalty of perjury.
18 do make any material changes, such as if you testify here
19 today, "He light was red," and then later you say, "The
20 light was green."
I should caution you that if you
No, "I mean red," "I mean green,"Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

21 something of that nature, that could be something that one
22 could comment on and could prove embarrassing at trial.
23 you -- any time you want to speak with either of the
24 lawyers that are present, feel free to do so.
25
If
If you want to take a break anytime, feel free,

reflected communications that you've had with any lawyers?

11 Q Okay.
12
13
How about any billing records, did you bring
any of those?
14 A Yes, I did.
15 Q Okay.
16
17
18
Well, we'll get into -- or won't as the case

And could you express what your opinion is on
that subject?
8Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

Q

I'm sorry.
Page 17 of 219
I mean, lawyer, legal
representative or attorney or --
A
Well, the first person I met who is an attorney
4 who -- I mean, I'm not sure of the exact, direct connection
5 here was Alan Purvis.
6 Q And how did that contact come to pass?
7 A He called me at my office.
8 Q And what was said and by whom during that
9
10
conversation?
A
Well, he told me that he was looking for
11 someone to do historical research on the question of the
12 awareness -- common awareness about the problems of
13 smoking, and would I be interested in participating in that
14 kind of research, undertaking it?
15
16
Q
Did he tell you how your name came to his
attention?
17 A No, he did not.
18 Q Okay.

Page 19 of 219
Okay.
And did you have any idea what it would be used
for?
4 A Yes, certainly.
5 Q What was your understanding?
6 A Well, my understanding was that his firm was
7
involved in the kind of cases that we have before us today.
8 Q Okay.
9 A Is that clear?
10 Q Well, generically speaking, cases where people
11 would be suing the tobacco industry for injuries they
12 sustained in smoking cigarettes?
13 A Correct.
14 Q Okay.

BY MR. GOLDSTEIN:
Q
Sometimes I should tell you that attorneys make
12 objections or statements for the record, and it doesn't
13 mean that he's fighting with me.
14 just -- although he may be, it means that he's just making
15 a statement for the record, so that at trial it may have an
16 impact on any of the questions that you can be asked.
It means that he's
17 A Sure.

Did he tell you the parameters?
I mean --
3 or -- or anything further about what type of research you
4 would be doing or he expected of you?
5 A Yes.
6 Q What did you discuss?
7 A Well, he made it clear that he wanted it to be
8 honest research, that he wanted me to come to my own
9 opinions and to, you know, spend the time necessary to
10
arrive at -- at what I felt were well-founded conclusions.
11 Q 12 when was that?
13 A I think that was about in October of 1999.
14 Q Okay.
15
When was it that you had a meeting with him, or
Did you discuss compensation?
16 A Yes, we did.
17 Q And what was said about that?
18 A Well, he asked me what my rate would be.

20 A I told him that I would charge $200 an hour,Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 26 of 219
21 but that I would also charge somewhat less for research
22 that was less taxing or required less travel or that kind
23 of thing.

How much time have you spent since October of

At any time prior to the commencement of this

7 Q Okay.
8 A You know.

10 A Yeah, that kind of thing.

13
Sure.
One question was the question that you
Okay.
Anything else of a substantive nature about
your testimony or opinions?
14
A
We talked a little bit about what my opinions
15 are, about again, the question -- like the question you

thing.
18Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
1
Q
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 35 of 219
Now, in terms of your expertise, as I
2 understand it, you are -- and I may be making this really
3 overly simplistic, and I apologize in advance if I make a
4 mess of this.
5
My understanding is that you're here to state
6 that sometimes people's opinions are founded based on
7 something other than facts or common knowledge regarding
8 tobacco or -- maybe I didn't artfully ask that.
9 A I'm sorry.
Would you repeat that?
10 Q Would you tell me what it is that -- well, what
11 are your opinions concerning common knowledge other than
12 what you've said for hundreds of years, you said that
13 it's -- or generations, I think you said, that there's been
14 a belief that smoking is dangerous to your health, and
15 other than that opinion, I mean, as defined like that, are
16 there any other opinions that you are -- you expect to be
17 testifying about at trial?
18
A
Yes.
Sure, of course.
Let me just preface by
19 saying that I imagine there are going to be things that
20 Mr. Piuze might bring up during the trial that, you know,Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 36 of 219
21 there will be lots of different questions, and so it's sort
22 of hard for me right now to anticipate all of the
23 directions that he might go in, and of course, I'm still
24 doing my research as we prepare.
25
But I think the other really important point
19Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 37 of 219
1 that I would be testifying to and a conclusion that I've
2 drawn is that another dimension of this issue is that
3 people have also known for hundreds of years that tobacco
4 is addictive.
5
Q
Do you have the belief that those people who do
6 become addicted to cigarette smoking do so of their own
7 volition?
8 believe is common knowledge, people nonetheless choose to
9 follow a dangerous path healthwise?
Despite the risks of the knowledge that you

11 THE WITNESS:
Objection.
Called for speculation.
That is pretty speculative.
12 this kind of a personal opinion, you mean?
13 about it personally?
14 BY MR. GOLDSTEIN:
15 Q Yes.
16 A All right.
Well, is
How do I feel
Well, I don't -- I think that if
17 people take up smoking, it's probably because they've
18 decided to literally pick up a cigarette and smoke it.
19 can't imagine anybody -- at least, I've never heard of any
20 cases where, you know, somebody's literally forced to smoke
IElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

21 a cigarette or to start, except for the poor, you know,
22 doggies and, you know, rats and stuff that get exposed to
23 this stuff.
24
25
Q
Okay.
Do you have an understanding from any --
20Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 39 of 219
1 anything that you've read or anybody -- anything anybody's
2 told you as to how your testimony would fit in to this
3 trial?

Objection.
Calls for speculation
Also, vague and ambiguous.
Go ahead.
THE WITNESS:
I don't know how to fit in.
BY MR. GOLDSTEIN:
9 Q Okay.
10 A I mean, I don't know the order in which things
11
would be done or --
12 Q I didn't mean that.
13 A Yeah.
14 Q I didn't mean sequentially when it would fit
15 in, but what is your understanding as to the importance of
16 your testimony vis-a-vis the whole trial, in terms of why
17 do you feel that your study was commissioned?
18 MR. DOBBERTEEN:
19 Go ahead.
20 THE WITNESS:
Same objections.
Plus compound.
Truly, which part of that would youElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

What is your understanding as to why you were

MR. DOBBERTEEN:
Speculation.
No
foundation.
6
7
Objection.
Go ahead.
THE WITNESS:
Yeah, one -- one difficulty in
8 answering the question is simply, I -- I'm not sure what
9 their reasoning was, and not being an attorney myself, I
10 don't understand exactly how all of those puzzle pieces fit
11 together.
12
But my understanding was that Mr. Purvis wanted
13 to know what historical, you know, what I as a historian
14 would conclude about common awareness and common knowledge
15 during the historical period in which Mr. Boeken in this
16 particular case was alive, was making choices.

Q
Okay.
Can you tell me the methodology you employed in
terms of -- other than reading material, did you -- well,Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
21
24
25
Page 42 of 219
how -- how did you approach the subject?
22
23
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Let me ask you this:
What did you do in order
to reach the opinions that you currently have?
A
Sure.
Well, any historian tends to follow a
fairly set pattern, almost regardless of the project that
22Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 43 of 219
1 you undertake because every project, I assume sort of like
2 every case for you is different, but there's a process that
3 you always follow, you know, when you start out.
4 the most important things is to start out with an open mind
5 and kind of a fresh sheet of paper, and one of the first
6 things you do is to define the question, the research
7 question.
8
Q
9
10
11
So one of
Uh-huh.
In this case what did you -- how did you define
it loosely when you started?
A
Well, loosely, I defined it as:
What did --
12 what were people aware of with regard to the hazards and
13 risks of smoking, and at what point in time historically
14 were people aware of it?
15
16
Q
Okay.
Do you have an opinion today as to whether the
17 general scientific community who studies smoking has
18 reached a consensus that smoking cigarettes today does
19 cause lung cancer?
20
MR. DOBBERTEEN:
Objection.

THE WITNESS:

Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 45 of 219
Could you tell me what that is?
2
A
Again, I -- I think it is important to know
3 that I am not a scientist here, and so I cannot evaluate,
4 you know, scientific reports and that kind of thing; but as
5 I understand it, there's a common consensus within the
6 scientific community, I assume, we're talking the year
7 2001 --
8 Q Yes.
9 A -- right, that this is pretty bad for you.
10 Q Okay.
11
When you say "pretty bad," that -- when you say
12 it's common knowledge from what, you know, that smoking
13 cigarettes can lead to a fatal lung condition?
14 words, other than being bad, it can actually be fatal?
15 A Yes.
16 Q Okay.
17
In other
Now, I'm going to ask you to go back since
18 you're a historian, and fortunately, I just went through
19 this with the last scientific witness, so maybe I won't
20 stumble as badly as I have in the past.Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
21
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 46 of 219
But would you say that going back ten years,
22 would you say that the common knowledge that prevailed in
23 the scientific community, or let's just say, the general
24 populace because you're more comfortable with that, was
25 very similar to that which you have observed today in the
24Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
1
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 47 of 219
year 2000 on that subject?
2 A Yes, absolutely.
3 Q Okay.
4
How about -- let's go back to 1964 when -- I
5 guess when the Surgeon General reports came out, would you
6 say that as of 1964 that there was general consensus that
7 was -- that significant smoking was one of the things that
8 could lead to a fatal disease?
9
A
There was common awareness about the risky
10 nature of -- of significant smoking, that it could lead to
11 fatal diseases.
12 Q Let's go back just, let's say, ten years before
14 A '54.
15 Q Yeah, in 1954, the year I was born.
13
that.
16
17
18
19
20
What would you think the general awareness was
in 1953 or '54 at that time, based on your studies --
A
The general awareness at that time was also
very high.
Q
Okay.Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
21
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 48 of 219
So that as you sit here, you don't believe
22 there was much doubt in the public that cigarette smoking
23 could lead to fatal consequences even 46 years ago?

This is the same question, but we're
2 just pushing farther back in time?
3 BY MR. GOLDSTEIN:
4 Q Yeah, just a little bit.
5 A Okay.
6 Q I think I framed it -- it's very close to the
7 last question.
8 A
I think that by the early 50's, yes, I think
9 that's what you're talking about, there was certainly wide
10 awareness that cigarettes could be -- could lead to fatal
11 diseases.
12
13
Q
Could you point to examples that -- let's say
I'm a doubting Thomas, and I say "okay."
14
It's great that you come up here from San Diego
15 with proof to me.
Point to something in one of those
16 boxes.
17 hopefully, with our limited time, but does anything come to
18 mind that you can say here, "Here, it is right here."
I'm not going to get up and ask you to do that,
19 A Oh, sure.
20 Q Okay.Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
21
22
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 50 of 219
Go ahead.
A
There are countless examples.
A very famous
23 example in American history was the death of General
24 Ulysses S. Grant who died of tongue cancer and was known to
25 be a heavy smoker, and it was known at the time that his
26Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
1 smoking caused his cancer.
2 that it caused his cancer.
It was believed at the time
3 Q And he died what in 1850-something?
4 A Oh, No.
5 MR. DOBBERTEEN:
6 THE WITNESS:
7 MR. GOLDSTEIN:
8
He died after the Civil War.
10 MR. GOLDSTEIN:
15
I'm sorry.
I stepped on your line.
I would ask you who was buried in
Grant's Tomb.
Q
13
14
I should know better than to venture
into somebody else's area of expertise.
MR. DOBBERTEEN:
12
We'd have lost the Civil War.
Caught you there.
9
11
Page 51 of 219
But go ahead.
When was it that he died?
A
I think it was mid-1880's.
I don't remember
the date exactly off hand.
16 Q Okay.
17 A But his death was a great blow because, you
18 know, second only really to Abraham Lincoln, he was
19 credited with winning the Civil War.
20 an enormous event.
So his death was justElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
21
22
23
Q
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 52 of 219
Did you find any material from the 80's -- from
1880's that reflected the tongue cancer reporting?
A
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
There was -- in the 1880's, and
24 actually, really up through -- there were still being
25 references made to General Grant in the 30's and the 40's
27Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 53 of 219
1 and also to the death of his son.
Apparently, Ulysses S.
2 Grant's son also died of cancer which was believed to be
3 linked to smoking.
4 And also, Edward VII and his son -- I'm not
5 sure if he was the VII, but King Edward, who came after
6 Queen Victoria and then his son George, who was succeeded
7 by Elizabeth II, the present Queen of England, these people
8 all died of complications from -- from smoking.
9
Q
Okay.
10 What was in the litigation, say, in 1950 or
11 settles about in the middle of the century that you can
12 point to other than, you know, Ulysses S. Grant, but maybe
13 as a historian, that may be more prominent to you than most
14 people.
It's an issue to use on common knowledge.
15
16
Is it that Ulysses S. Grant died of tongue
cancer?
17 A Not today.
18 Q Okay.
19
20
All right.
How about in 1950 or between 1950 and 1960,
say, can you point to any instances like you just did whichElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 54 of 219
21 are very helpful of any other significant deaths or
22 incidents that would demonstrate to me public awareness
23 during that decade that smoking was potentially fatal and
24 was fatal?
25
A
Well, some of the great cultural heroes came
28Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001

Right.
How about the 50's, anything?
50's and 60's,
you can give to me?
A
Well, there were various famous people who have
died, if that's what you mean.
Q
Well, what I'm wondering is, was there anything
14 that you can point to that occurred in the decade of, say,
15 the 50 -- 1950 to 1966 where you can point to another
16 episode and say, "See, I'm telling you it's common
17 knowledge, and here's an example of that at that time"?
18 MR. DOBBERTEEN:
Excuse me, but you're not limiting
19 it to some death of somebody.

It could be any study orElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
21 MR. GOLDSTEIN:
22 THE WITNESS:
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Yeah, that's what I meant.
Page 56 of 219
Yeah.
Well, the most obvious place to go in
23 the 50's are all of the studies that were done that just
24 mushroomed in that decade that linked smoking to lung
25 cancer.

me?
One example would be the study in 1950
5 published in the "Journal of American Medical Association"
6 by Ernst Wynder and Everharts Graham which was a
7 retrospective study showing that virtually everyone who
8 died of lung cancer was a heavy smoker.
9
Q
10
11
Uh-huh.
In your research, have you ever had occasion to
determine -- I'm sorry.
12
Let me rephrase.
When you talk about common knowledge, is one of
13 the issues also to determine how widespread cancer deaths
14 are as an example?
15 A No.
16 Q "No"?
17
Do you have an understanding as to how -- how
18 many people have died of lung cancer, say, in the last year
19 or any point in time?
20
A
No.Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
21
22
Q
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 58 of 219

Do you have any understanding as to what the
23 reported correlation is in the litigation you reviewed as
24 to the number of people that smoke versus the number of
25 people that come out with lung cancer?

22 Q What is your understanding as to the number of
23 people that are cigarette smokers that come down with lung

25
A
The figure that I've seen cited in the
31Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 61 of 219
1 litigation quite frequently is a ratio of 1 to 10, 1 out of

10 you with any of the information you used in your study?

In fact, did you ever get anything from

people like that.
Q
And you read any of those?
32Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 63 of 219
1 A Yes, I did.
2 Q When you reviewed them, did you review them
3 with an eye toward looking to see whether claims that were
4 made or contentions made by them in their depositions
5 squared with your knowledge of peoples' common experiences?
6 Maybe I didn't ask that -- let me rephrase.
7
When you went to look through the various
8 depositions that you just testified about, did you have
9 something that you were looking for when you went through
10
it?
11 A Certainly.
12 Q Okay.
13
And I take it that, from your perspective,
14 you'd be looking at something different than if you were an
15 oncologist looking at a specialty.
16
17
18
So can you tell me from your perspective what
things you were looking at in the deposition?
A
I was in -- in the deposition, I was looking to
19 see the sources of information that Mr. Boeken and his
20 family recall having gotten, you know, their knowledge ofElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

Do you remember how it was that Mr. Boeken
23 related to having first undertaken smoking?
24 to start smoking, if you remember from the reading you did?
25

What led him
I remember one of the things that he said was
33Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

22 why he did it was because it was the thing that was done.

does that ring a bell?
34Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
1
A
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 67 of 219
Yes, but if I recall correctly, he -- that was
2 a kind of a later -- from the deposition, as I remember it
3 now, and I did read it probably a month and a half ago,
4 that he was asked by Mr. Piuze about the Marlboro man, was
5 he macho and -- and Mr. Boeken said yes, he's macho.

Can you explain what that means?

That you rely on reliable scientific or

Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 71 of 219
1 do in order to reach the present conclusions that you have

of the places I came to was up to Loma Linda University
10 which is fairly close by here in Loma Linda.
And I did
11 research there at the archives at the Seventh Day
12 Adventist.
13 BY MR. GOLDSTEIN:
14 Q And what were you looking for there?
15 A I was investigating the work of private
16 voluntary groups and educating people about the hazards of

18 groups.

21 Day Adventist might have been very effective in the
22 community of Loma Linda, but did you ever determine what
23 segment of the population they were able to reach with

25 A
Yes, I think so.

Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Q What was that?
A Well, they're really remarkable.
Page 73 of 219
How widespread do you think it
was?
I think that
4 their -- their spread was worldwide, oddly.
5 things that makes them so interesting is that one would
6 expect that most church organizations would speak primarily
7 to their own membership.
8 don't do that.

11
One of the
This is fairly standard, but they
Their goal is to reach everybody.
And what was the nature of the message they
were trying to get out?
A
Well, they've been hammering for about
12 150 years or longer at smoking, in particular, as being
13 very dangerous, very risky substance.
14
15
Q
Okay.
What evidence do you have that they reached
16 market penetration of any degree?
In other words, with
17 their message, that you have a group of people and you can
18 say it went worldwide, maybe they mailed letters or had
19 various groups around the world, but what evidence can you
20 point to that the people in the communities whereElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

THE WITNESS:
To give you one example because that
38Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 75 of 219
1 is sort of a large question, but to go to the first part of
2 the question, when I use the word "worldwide," what I was
3 thinking was the fact that the World Health Organization
4 invited the Seventh Day Adventist and particularly the
5 founder of their five-day plan to lecture, I can't
6 remember, to Geneva or something to the World Health
7 Organization, so they achieved fair eminence in their
8 efforts.

that.
2
When you were conducting your research, did you
3 do some sort of impartially trying to gather whatever was
4 out there?
5 specifically looking for messages that were anti-smoking;
6 correct, when you went to do your research?
7
8
A
I mean, you didn't -- you -- you were
Well, I was looking for things that warned
people about the dangers of smoking.
9 Q Okay.
10 A So that would be anti-smoking, I think.
11 Q Okay.
12
And it -- what I mean is, when you conducted
13 your investigation, it was a cross of an entire broad swath
14 of sources; right?
I mean, it was --
15 A Oh, absolutely.
16 Q Okay.
17
Did you ever find a -- in your research
18 anything to quantify or to document efforts that the
19 tobacco companies were undertaking to warn people about
20 smoking during that same period of investigational timeElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

Page 78 of 219
that you've researched the subject?

Anything equivalent to, let's say, the American

1 Cancer Society, you saw that they were undertaking an
2 active public outreach for want of a better word, okay?
3 A (Witness nods head.)
4 Q And if I was to use the same characterization
5 for the Seventh Day Adventist, that would be something that
6 you say sounds reasonable, they were conducting a public
7 outreach on smoking --
8 A Sure.
9 Q You see anything equivalent that was undertaken
10
11
by the tobacco industry?
A
Well, I believe in the last couple of years
12 there has been attempts that I'm not very familiar with but
13 attempts by companies to make clear the message to young
14 people that smoking is not for kids.
15 Q Can you point to some examples of that?
16 A Well, I think that there were -- again, there
17 were sort of educational materials which were distributed
18 to schools and that kind of thing that I've heard about.
19 haven't seen, but I've heard about them.
20
Q
Okay.

Page 80 of 219
Well, going back to, let's say, the decade of
22 the 50's to the 60's, can you point to anything that you
23 ran across in your research that evidenced any attempts by
24 any tobacco companies, Philip Morris included, to try to
25 warn the public of the dangers of smoking?

How about -- let me carry it to the 70's or
80's anything there that you ran across?
A
Well, as I'm remembering it right now, as I sit
6 here, again, I think in that period of time, it really was
7 mostly limited to the -- to the labels, the warning labels
8 that were on the products.
9
10
Q
Okay.
And if I ask you to assume for purposes of the
11 question that those were mandated, they were not undertaken
12 voluntarily by the tobacco industry, but that the
13 government mandated those placement of warning labels --
14 well, let me rephrase it a different way.
15 Let me say voluntary efforts, can you point to
16 anything other than the last couple of years when you said
17 you had a vague understanding, but not a specific
18 understanding of warning to kids?
19

In the research that you've done, can you point
to anything that you ran across specifically thatElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

22 tobacco manufactures, including Philip Morris, where they
23 undertook to warn the population of the dangers of smoking?

of warning.

Did
22 you do it the old-fashioned way where you went down and

2 prospective way, that there is a case that you might be
3 needed for, but I had previously done some research related
4 to a couple of other cases that I'm no longer working on.

something in the future, too.
Q
What are the other cases that were you working
on before?
A
One was a case involving a plaintiff by the

but --
2 Q Do you remember which ones they were?
3 A I think he lived for a time in Hollywood and
4 then Brentwood and Topanga Canyon, those are the ones that
5 come to me off the top.
6
Q
Santa Monica, too.
And in your research, did you try to correlate
7 the information you were gathering based on the years when
8 he was, like you went back, maybe '56 or '57 today, started
9 smoking when he was 10, you went back 47 years roughly.
10
A
I think he said he started smoking about in
11 1957, but I was certainly my research, in general, goes,
12 you know, back really far; and then I've been focusing on
13 events since 1950 more recently.
14
15
Q
Okay.
Would it be fair to state that before you
16 started your research, you were already of the opinion that
17 common knowledge about the risks of smoking were very
18 widespread, you just wanted to -- I mean, you -- you
19 already had a knowledge about widespread smoking before you

3 Q And that's a textbook publisher, isn't it?

5 Q And did you write a textbook?
6 A Mailed it last month.
7 Q And what was the title of it?
8 A "Major problems in American History, 1865 to

the Present."
10 Q Write anything about tobacco in there?
11 A Yes.
12 Q And what did you -- do you remember what the
13
14
subject matter of -- that you dealt with?
A
Well, tobacco is a topic that comes a whole lot
15 in American history, and in the particular connection, I
16 used it, one of them, at least, was in a discussion of the
17 progressive era in American history which is a period
18 roughly 1890 to 1920.
19
20
Q
And did you express an opinion in the book
about the progressive era or characterize it any way?Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

21 A Yes.

25
opinion about the progressive era.
Q
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
That was
52Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
1 a poor question.
2 statements about tobacco in your book.
3
A
Okay.
Page 103 of 219
I'm mostly interested in your opinions or
One thing I used -- this particular book
4 is a collection of documents and also of secondary sources,
5 and in addition to that, the author or editor in my case,
6 describes the era as well; so that's why I was a little
7 confused when you asked if I expressed an opinion --
8 expressed an opinion about the progressive era, in general.
9
The particular item that concerned tobacco,
10 there were a couple of things in that chapter, and also now
11 that I think about it in the chapter on the 1920's also.
12 But the chapter on the progressive era since I was talking
13 about that, there was a selection from Henry Ford's
14 treatise against smoking.
15
Q
And what was the upshot of your -- I mean, if I
16 asked you to summarize briefly what it was that you said
17 about Henry Ford's treatise or about smoking, in general,
18 as appears in your book, can you give me just a brief
19 summary of what it was you said?
20
A
Well, I didn't say anything in this caseElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 104 of 219
21 because it was his document.
Other than to say Henry Ford
22 was an important industrialist which is, you know, pretty
23 obvious, but lots of students don't know that and you -- I
24 think I characterized him as a leader of business opinion
25 and popular opinion; and this was something he said about
53Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 105 of 219
1 smoking, and it was from his book called "he Little White
2 Slaver." 3 Q And did you quote from the book?
4 A Yes.
5 Q And what portions did you quote?
6 A I think I took one or two pages from the front
7 and -- and a selection from the end so that students would
8 have it -- an idea of the gist.
9
10
11
Q
And what was the gist of it, the quote that you
put in there?
A
Well, Henry Ford discussed his relationship
12 with Thomas Edison, and Thomas Edison thought that smoking
13 was really bad for you and so he recounted Edison's views
14 and added his own which is that it's a degenerate practice.
15 It's unhealthful, you know, can harm you.
16 Q Uh-huh.
17 A Especially boys.
18 Q Do you agree with the viewpoint expressed in
19
20
there personally?
A
Do you have a personal view on tobacco?
You mean a general personal view, not --Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 106 of 219
21 Q Yeah.
22 A -- as related to Henry Ford, in particular?
23 Q Right.
24 A Well, you know, I think I personally agree with
25
Henry Ford, that it's bad for you.

Q

4
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 107 of 219
Okay
How about the chapter on the 20's?
What did
you talk about tobacco there?
A
Well, again, I didn't myself talk about it
5 because that came up in an essay by a historian named Paula
6 Fass, who writes a book called "The Dammed and the
7 Beautiful," and she talks about social taboos and the
8 breaking of social taboos in the 1920's by college-aged
9 Americans.
10
Q
11
Okay.
And what else did she discuss about tobacco?
12 A Oh.
13 Q The gist of her expressions?
14 A I was going to say she talks a lot about sex,
15 but about tobacco, she talks about that as having been a
16 point of contention between young people and old people, a
17 point of contention between men and women, about what's
18 proper behavior for -- for young people and for women, in
19 particular.
20
Q
So you were just including it sort of as aElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 108 of 219
21 historical perspective for students to glean from her
22 writings or --
23 A
Well, I -- I think most students have an image
24 of the 20's, you know, as a time of flappers and -- and,
25 you know, kind of wild living as portrayed by people like
55Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 109 of 219
1 F. Scott Fitzgerald and so her book is well-known as
2 being -- as giving a very good description of the changes
3 in social mores.
4 Q
Did anything in the information you included
5 from the Fass materials assist you in reaching your
6 conclusions about the common experiences that people viewed
7 tobacco, say, in that era in 1920's?

Objection.
Vague and uncertain.
Would you mind just repeating it for
I'm sorry.
11 MR. GOLDSTEIN:
Sure.
12 Q Let me rephrase.
13 A Sure.
14 Q Do you have an opinion as to what the
15 prevailing attitudes were of common views were in society
16 in the 20's regarding tobacco?
17 A Yes.
18 Q And what were they?
19 A Well, there were many views.
20
controversial subject within society.
It was a very
One of the views,Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 110 of 219
21 for example, was by many people that women should not
22 smoke, and another contrary view was that smoking was a
23 kind of liberating experience and modern women could smoke
24 unlike their "foremothers."
25
Q
Okay.
All right.
56Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

3 MR. DOBBERTEEN:
4 MR. GOLDSTEIN:
5 THE WITNESS:
With regard to smoking in the 20's.
Right.
Sure.
Right.
There was a lot of discussion
6 about prohibiting cigarettes, legal prohibition that came
7 up repeatedly in the 20's.
8 BY MR. GOLDSTEIN:
9
10
11
Q
That --
What were the sources for that information?
Where did that come from?
A
Oh, gosh.
That comes from lots of places.
12 Congress, congressional hearings, again, industrialists,
13 rather like Henry Ford who, you know, said in the late 20's

Was tobacco a major problem in that time period
24 from 19- -- 1865 on?
I mean, I know the title of your book
25 was "Major Problems Between 1865 and the Present."
57Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

Page 113 of 219
I mean, was the reason you included in there
2 because that was one of the major problems that was out
3 there?
4
A
That's a good observation.
The -- the title
5 "Major Problems" applies really more to whole eras, for
6 example.
7 or within the era of the -- of the progressive period, but
8 the -- the phrase "major problems" refers to much larger

Do you have a -- an understanding as to how

Have you prepared

3 already talked about?
4 A Certainly.
5 Q Okay.
6
7
And what would those areas be?
A
Well, for example, one of the -- I'm not sure
8 that we covered -- this is all -- I would want to talk
9 about the efforts that were made by -- by Government
10 officials, you know, at all levels of government, you know,

Can you detail for me anything that you've

Page 136 of 219
21 reports that you're aware of where tobacco industry's
22 accused of having spiked or included chemicals within the

24 to hook people and keep them as consumer?

A
You don't really want an opinion there; right?
69Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

And do you have a personal opinion of it?

If you were told that that was true, that the

Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 139 of 219
BY MR. GOLDSTEIN:
2 Q You can go ahead.
3 A Well, I guess I think of it that question is
4 reminding me of the charge that went about in the 1880 and
5 1890's that there was opium in cigarettes.
6 that was an allegation, and I think that made people feel
7 pretty bad about the companies; and so if such an
8 allegation were true, then, you know, you'd think was a
9 wrong thing for them to do.
10
At that time
But again, I don't know that
that's what they've done and so --
11
Q
12
Okay.
So in other words, now, do you know one way or
13 another whether there ever was opium in cigarettes in
14 1880's?
15 A Well, again, I'm not a scientist.
16 Q I understand.
17 A I didn't process any of these cigarettes to
18 know.
19 that was kind of a scare -- scare tactic.
20
I didn't --
But I think that people have since recognized that
Q
Okay.Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
21
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 140 of 219
Now, applying what you heard about in the
22 1880's to the present day, is it your personal view that
23 maybe it's a scare tactic that's being employed today
24 against the tobacco industry?
25
A
Well, I think you'd have to look at the source

Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
1 of the allegation.
2 in that regard than others.
3
Q
4
5
10
Right.
about whether those allegations are true, as you sit here?
A
I think you should always investigate
allegations before, you know, you swallow them whole, yes.
8
9
Some sources would seem less credible
So are you personally a little circumspect
6
7
Page 141 of 219
Q
So at this point, your attitude personally
towards Philip Morris would not be hostile or antagonistic
based on unsubstantiated reports which you drew as --
11 A Yes.
12 Q -- being conjecture at this point; right?
13 A Yes.
14 Q But if you were later to find out that it was
15 true, that the tobacco industry did consciously place
16 chemicals, that they knew to be toxic and that they knew to
17 render people addicted and unable to quit on their own,
18 that that may change your opinion if you were presented
19 with documented, substantiated evidence from a credible
20 source?Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
21
A
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 142 of 219
This is a hard question to answer because
22 tobacco, as I understand it, is addictive, and so if they
23 put tobacco in the cigarettes, then there is an addictive
24 product in the cigarettes so that seems to go right, you
25 know, and we already know that.
So I kind -- it's hard for
72Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
1
2
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 143 of 219
me to answer your question considering that.
Q
3
Uh-huh.
You understand that people have been reported
4 to come down with lung cancer and die who have smoked

Do you have a personal opinion about whether --
about the propriety of the tobacco industry selling such a
product to the public?

Do you mean, for example, do I think cigarettes
should be illegal?
Q
Well, let me ask it this way:
Do you think
they should be and remain to be legal?
A
Okay.
Personal opinion here.
Well, I, in my
16 personal opinion, I -- I think they should be legal in the
17 way that alcohol is legal.

THE WITNESS:
Well, my personal opinion, I think it
6 should be legal for won reason:
7 where likely people are going to want to use it anyway and
8 will contrive illegally to get it in a way that prohibition
9 of alcohol collapsed and -- and led to the formation of
10 organized crime in America.
11 BY MR. GOLDSTEIN:
12
Q
13
That this is a product
Okay.
So maybe the lesser of two evils?
14 A Perhaps.
15 Q Were you surprised at the lack of any evidence
16 in the materials you reviewed going back decades and
17 decades that the lack of efforts that you found on the part
18 of the tobacco industry to publicize to the public that
19 smoking cigarettes was very dangerous and harmful to their
20 health?Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
21 A No.
22 Q Okay.
23
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 146 of 219
Was that an expectation that you would have
24 from a company selling or deriving money, selling a product
25 would not knowingly shot "themself" in the foot?
74Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
1
A
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 147 of 219
Well, as I did mention before, they did
2 advertise that it was dangerous because of the significant
3 labeling -- warning labels that were on packages, so I
4 wouldn't characterize it that they did not make any attempt
5 to warn people.
6 Q
7
Okay.
What about prior to the time -- what about the
8 labels that, you know, history change, when were they
9 affixed for the first time to cigarettes?
10 A They were affixed in 1966.
11 Q Okay.
12
13
14
So let's go back in the hundreds of years that
you've recounted.
Do you have any evidence prior to 1966 of any
15 efforts whatsoever that any tobacco manufacturer has

Page 155 of 219
tobacco other than what we've already talked about?
A
Only as it would pertain to preparing for my
3 Ph.D. oral exams.
4 about U.S. History, and certainly, that would have been a
5 part of it.
6
Q
You mean a lot of general information
And can you tell me what it was just briefly
7 succinctly what it was that you learned about or were
8 tested about on tobacco?
9
A
Oh, well, the economy of the south, of course.
10 You know, the slave economy and major crops, and you know,
11 monopolies and trust busting by Teddy Roosevelt.
12 it's something which really goes back to the American
13 revolution, and before so, it's a topic that kind of pops
14 up at different points.
15
Q
I mean,
Have any other tobacco manufacturer sought to
16 use you in any way, in any other case other than Philip
17 Morris in this case other than what you've already
18 testified about?
19 A
20
Well, in some of the other cases that I've
worked on, there were other defendants other than PhilipElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

Page 157 of 219
You know, I just don't -- I don't know which
companies they worked for per se.
4
Q
5
Okay.
From a personal point of view, you received
6 evidence that a tobacco manufacturer was targeting its
7 advertising campaign towards inducting youthful or young
8 people to begin smoking, let's say, under age 18, would
9 that be a -- an issue that you would personally question?
10
A
Yes.
If -- if -- if, you know, contrary to
11 what they've been doing, you know -- the efforts they've
12 made to not target young people going back to the 60's when
13 this was an issue, if there was a reversal of their
14 position, then that would be a problem, I would think, just
15 speaking personally here.
16
Q
In your research, did you -- you know, I don't
17 think we went into the habit-forming addictive issues yet,
18 did we?
19 upon it.
20
I don't think we -- we only just briefly touched
Could you explain for me in your research whatElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

21 you found in terms of whether tobacco's habit forming or
22 addictive?

Well, okay.
That sounds like it might be kind
of a medical question there.

4 Q Historically, can you recount for me what type
Would you mind?
5 of information you ran across that was reported in the --
6 that was contained in what's called public knowledge about
7 cigarettes being addictive or habit forming?
8
A
Well, this information has been repeated in
9 every generation, the first references are from Bartolome
10 de Las Casas who accompanied Christopher Columbus on his
11 voyages and later wrote about the herb that the natives
12 were using, and he observed that when Spaniards began using
13 this herb, that they found themselves unable to stop using
14 it.
15
16
17
18
In effect, they were addicted.
Q
Other than -- and that was in what year did
they first report that, if you can recall?
A
Well, I know it was 1492 Columbus sailed the
ocean blue.
19 Q Okay.
20 A But Casas, his works were published, you know,Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
21
22

a little bit later, his journals.
Q
Well, I take it as thorough as you are, you
23 didn't go back to the 15th or 16th Centuries, did you, in
24 your search of information, or did you?
25
A
Oh, yes.
81Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 161 of 219
1 Q You did.
2 A Of course.
3 Q You went back to the original source documents?
4 A We start at the beginning.
5 Q Okay.
6
Do you have copies in those boxes of reports
7 from the 1500's?
8 A
9
10
11
What you'll find in the boxes are my notes
about that reading, for example, and there are secondary
sources which cite Las Casas.
Q
Where did you -- where did you run across the
12 magazines -- well, let me ask you, first of all,
13 foundationally.
14
Did you actually see publications that were
15 from the 1500's that were -- in which that information was
16 contained?

MR. DOBBERTEEN:

Because when you were answering the
You didn't do that, though?
11 A No.

13
In your quest to inspect original documents,
14 can you tell me the oldest document that you actually
15 looked at?
16
A
Let me tell you that it's a little hard to
17 determine for the reason to give one example, one of the
18 oldest documents that we have is King James's document
19 which he called "The Counterblast," and that's -- goes back
20 to the 17th Century and what you -- what you see in -- inElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

8 Q
Have at it.
Okay.
Other than seeing the reference in the
9 Christopher Columbus times and going forward, other than
10 just seeing the words "habit forming" or "addictive" in
11 connection with tobacco, can you recount any articles that
12 you have seen that may have quantified how addictive or
13 habit forming tobacco can be or is?

Uncertain.

Is it your belief that, let's say at least
23 through the 20th Century, starting, let's say, from the
24 turn of the century, well, let's say, even going back to
25 the progressive era, do you think that it was well

2 forming and addictive?
3 A Yes.
4 Q Can you recall any references you ran across
5
6
that review -- that made a note of a particular feature?
A
There are many books that refer to its
7 addictive character.
The author of "Peter Pan," for
8 example, James Barry, "My Lady Nicotine" is a book he also
9 wrote, makes reference to that.
10 already to the Henry Ford piece.
And then, I referred
11 Q Okay.
12 A That indicates those kinds of things.
13 Q Just out of curiosity sort of along the lines
14 of the opium questions, around the turn of the century,
15 there were reports that Coca Cola contained coca leaves.

17
Did you ever review any of that material, come
across that in the context of your search in tobacco?
18 A Not in that context, no.

Excluding those documents you obtained from

13 came from efforts that you undertook to obtain them?
14 MR. DOBBERTEEN:
15 THE WITNESS:
Same objection.
There are different ways of obtaining
16 documents.
One way in which you obtain documents is to

11 you may have made to historians or visiting archives as you
12 said you have and things of that nature?

Did you in custom and practice expenses in
photocopies when you obtained them from, say, the "San
Diego Union" or "L.A. Times"?
11 A Sometimes, yes.

13 spent in those expenses in terms of obtaining them for
14 paper from third parties?
15
A
You know, I couldn't estimate the photocopying

Well, in relation to this case.
Page 179 of 219
Were you asked
specifically to -- well, let me rephrase that.

Did you discuss with any attorneys prior to
5 your testimony today the frequent/or pervasiveness of
6 anti-smoking or health messages that may have been
7 communicated to the public excluding anything we've already
8 testified about today?
9
A
You know, I'm -- I have told them my opinions.
10 I'm sure the conversations are probably at times been
11 broader than this one conversation today.
12 hard to recall everything I've ever said to anybody about
13 this topic.

I just mean recently in terms of the
discussions you had with attorneys?
16 A No, I don't think so.

Is it your opinion that even if material was

1 messages that you find to be in the public knowledge on the
2 subject of smoking risks or hazards?
3
A
Well, this is speculation, so I would hesitate
4 to say that this is verified because I haven't researched
5 it per se, but I think that people who are developmentally
6 disabled may not be aware of the dangers or less likely to
7 be aware of the dangers, and honestly, that's about the
8 only group that I can think of that wouldn't know.
9 even then, I'm not sure because I have a very good friend

Q
13
Okay.
What about children in your research, did you

8 A The -- one of the things I base my opinion on
9
10
11
12
is the educational efforts that were made by the State of
California within the schools for children of that age.
Q
Okay.
So as you sit here today, you believe that it's
13 absolutely widespread beyond any question that everybody
14 should have known barring developmentally disabled people,
15 say, in 1957, about the harms or risks inherent to begin
16 cigarette smoking?
17 MR. DOBBERTEEN:
18 THE WITNESS:
Objection.
Calls for a conclusion.
It's my opinion that awareness was
19 widespread as of the mid-1950's which is what I think
20 you're referring to.Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001

23 A And that -- that's easily established

4 the presence of coc- -- cocaine or coca leaves in the
5 formulation of Coca Cola, say, around 1907.
6
In any of your research, have you ever
7 considered whether other segments of the population may
8 have had a similar perception in 1957 to some of the -- the
9 materials that you're now saying is out in the public and
10
widespread?
11
A
Well, I -- I -- in my personal opinion, I think
12 that those are not comparable examples for the reason that
13 I didn't hear about that from my Government, that there was
14 cocaine in Coca Cola, and I didn't hear about it from my
15 teachers; and -- and all these other authorities, an old
16 wives' tail, I think by definition, is something that's a
17 sort of a rumor from people who are old fashioned, old
18 wives.
19
20
Q
Okay.
Do you have an opinion about anything that anyElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

21 other witnesses have testified about other than you've
22 already said?

designation.
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 187 of 219
You don't have to be concerned.
2 A Okay.
3 Q And it says that you may be asked to comment
4 upon the opinions expressed by other witnesses and
5 testimony of other witnesses to the extent that they relate
6 to your area of expertise, and my question to you is:
7 Other than what you've already testified about in terms of
8 Mr. Boeken's comment on "everybody smokes," is there
9 anything else that you've read in this case that relates to
10
your area of expertise that you wish to comment on?
11
A
Well, you see, I haven't heard all of the other
12 witnesses, so it's really hard to anticipate exactly what
13 other areas I might go into based on what might come up
14 into the trial and might be asked to comment upon, and I
15 think that's the intent of that statement is to say that I
16 would be prepared to respond.
17
18
19
20
Q
Sure.
And I'm not asking you to be clairvoyant
here.
I'm wondering:
Is there anything else that you
may have read already, say, as an example of the depositionElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
21
22
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 188 of 219
of any other Boeken family members?
A
Well, I'm trying to think of what else might be
23 relevant in those depositions.
Certainly Mrs. Boeken
24 talked a little bit about the kind of things the family
25 read or thought, and Mr. Boeken's sister spoke about their
95Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 189 of 219
1 attempts -- hers and with her brother, their attempt to
2 quit smoking, so perhaps at some point, we might want to
3 talk about, you know, the efforts to, you know, promote
4 smoking cessation clinics, for example, and then we might
5 talk about that.
6 Q
7
And what -- what opinion would you have on
that, if that subject was discussed?
8 A Well, it would depend on the question.
9 Q Well, what is your opinion on smoking cessation
10
11
clinics as it relates to the Boeken case in any way?
A
Well, that they were widespread in Los Angeles,
12 for example, that there were many, many clinics available
13 for people.
14 Q During what period of time?
15 A From 1962 onward.
16 Q And what do you base that opinion on?
17 A Upon -- for one example, upon my research at
18
19
20
Loma Linda and the Seventh Day Adventist archives.
Q
Okay.
As you sit here today, can you recall whetherElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 190 of 219
21 Mr. Boeken said he did or did not undertake any efforts to
22 try to stop smoking?
23
24
25
A
I recall that he said he did undertake a couple
of efforts to stop smoking.
Q
Okay.
Okay.
96Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 191 of 219
You're not being critical of anything that he
2 said or did with respect to smoking cessation, are you,
3 based upon your area of expertise?
4 A No.
5 Q Okay.
6
Have you met Mr. Leiter before today?
7 A Yes.
8 Q Okay.
9
10
All right.
And have you ever had a discussion with
Mr. Leiter?
11 A Yes.
12 Q And can you tell me when it was prior to your
13
14
15
16
deposition today that you last spoke with him?
A
I'm going to guess it might have been six
months ago.
Q
17
Okay.
18
19
20
And what was discussed and by whom during that
conversation?
A
forthcoming.
He told me about another case that might beElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
21
22
Q
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
And was that one of the two cases that you had
talked about previously?
23 A No, it was not.
24 Q Okay.
25
Page 192 of 219
And what was that case, if you recall?
97Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
1
2
A
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
That case involved a plaintiff named Robert
Creighton.
3 Q And where was that case venued?
4 A In Oakland.
5 Q Okay.
6
7
Page 193 of 219
Did you ever end up doing any work on that
case?
8 A Yes, I did.
9 Q And what type of work did you do in that case?
10 A I did some research at the University of
11
12
California at Berkeley.
Q
13
14
15
16
What did you do there?
A
19
20
I did some library research on some of the
newspapers that Mr. Creighton had read.
Q
17
18
My Alma Mater.
Okay.
And how much time did you spend on the
Creighton case when you were involved in that?
A
I'm sorry.
This gets back to my remembering those numbers.
I -- I don't remember exactly the number ofElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

I'm going to guess here at about maybe 5,000,
but that's --
3 Q Okay.
4 A -- truly a guess.
5 Q Okay.
6
Other than the now four cases that you've
7 talked about, present one included, have you had any other
8 involvement in any other cases for any attorneys that you
9 understand worked with or for the tobacco industry?
10 A No.
11 Q Okay.
12
13
Any other prospective cases that you were going
to work on or "no"?
14 A No.
15 Q Okay.

Have you ever worked -- done any work from the

Page 197 of 219
Houghton-Mifflin, have you been retained by any
2 other entities or persons to do -- to undertake work that
3 is secondary to your vocation?
4 A Yes.
5 Q And what else have you been hired to do?
6 A Well, for example, I am also under contract to
7
write a book for McGraw-Hill.
8 Q And what is the subject of that book?
9 A "The History of the World."
10 Q Okay.
11
12
That's overbroad.

13 A I'm sorry.
14 Q Okay.

Page 198 of 219
So I honestly
don't know how it will figure.
Q
Okay.
Reviewing the different cases that we've talked
about in all the four cases that you've had since October
100Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 199 of 219
1 of 1999, it -- I just want to try to get as accurate a
2 statement as possible, understanding that you're not great
3 with numbers, I just want to find out -- I don't mean to be
4 critical, I'm just repeating what you said -- what is your
5 best estimate as to the total amount of time in your
6 compensated life where you are spending time on tobacco
7 cases as a personal of your overall compensated work?
8
9
And in answering that question, let me just
suggest that you consider what your salary is at the
10 University and compare that to the income you've derived or
11 expect to derive for work that you've done so far for the
12 tobacco industry.
13
A
Well, I hope you won't mind if I point out I
14 think that's a different question because different things
15 I do have different rates of compensation.
16 Q Okay.
17 A So if I figured it, just based on a rate of
18 compensation, that would be different from the amount of
19 hours I spent.
20 Q
Okay.Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
21
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 200 of 219
Let me do it both ways --
22 A Okay.
23 Q -- because if I'm -- let me ask you first the
24
25
indelicate question.
Is there anywhere that's on a public record,
101Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

Page 201 of 219
1 somewhere one could go to see how much you're paid as a
2 professor?
3
4
5
A
I understand there is.
I've never looked at
it, but, yes.
Q
6
Okay.
So if I were inquisitive enough and had nothing
7 to do and I wanted to do that, what would I find?
8 is your salary per year?
9 A It's approximately 90,000 a year.
10 Q Okay.
11
How much
Okay.
Now, just in terms of dollars, not in terms of
12 hours, how would you compare the amount of compensation
13 you've received for matters relating to tobacco as opposed
14 to your overall income?
15 MR. DOBBERTEEN:
16 MR. GOLDSTEIN:
17 Q Let's say 15 -- am I right?
18 A Yeah, about 16 months, I would think.
19 Q Okay.
20
Since October, 1999?
Right.
15, 16 months?
So in those 16 months, you would probablyElizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 202 of 219
21 receive something about let's say 120-, $125,000 in terms
22 of your salary --
23 A Uh-huh.
24 Q -- right?
25
I'm just ballparking it.
102Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
1 A Okay.
2 Q Okay.
3
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 203 of 219
I'll take that from you.
Compared to the 125,000 that you would receive
4 from the University, how would you compare the overall
5 amount of money that you think you'd receive for doing work
6 that's tobacco related?

That really is a guess.
But I --
I don't think it's probably wildly off.

Page 205 of 219
Q
No, I would think that it would be in the last
two months, you billed 24 for this case, no?
Because --
9 A Yes.
10 Q Because that would mean that -- that would mean
11 that you'd be at about 20 percent already just based on the
12 last two months.
13 A
Well, the reason why I'm guessing in this

You --
16 A
Well, first of all, I don't have the figures,
14
way --
17 you know, in front of me to figure this out for you.
And
18 also, there have been many months where I was not doing
19 much work on this because I was working on other projects.
20 So --Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
21
Q
Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 206 of 219
Okay.
22 Let me just shift over to the time percentage
23 now, his question, which I really don't want to do -- but
24 what percentage of your overall time do you think you've
25 spent, or is that -- are you able to do that with any kind
104Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)

Boeken v PM Feb 28, 2001
Page 207 of 219
of precision?
A
Yes.
That would be very hard to answer.
I --

5 could not tell you that.

Okay.

8 produce the documents that we requested in the deposition
9 notice to the extent that they exist, and you have them
10
11
12
13
14
available to you?
MR. DOBBERTEEN:
And to the extent that they are
requested, as you believe they are.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:
I have every confidence that they
are because yesterday --
15 MR. DOBBERTEEN: I'm just making my record.
16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- because yesterday in the
17 deposition, in the afternoon, I surrendered my only copy of
18 the Notice to the reporter, but on that Notice, that was a
19 single Notice that went to every party; and it listed seven
20 categories of documents.Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman (Deposition)
