HAVING BEEN FIRST DULY SWORN, TESTIFIED AS FOLLOWS:
EXAMINATION
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Could you state your name for the record, please?
A. Certainly. Elizabeth Cobbs-Hoffman.
Q. And do you prefer to be addressed by Dr. Hoffman or Ms. Hoffman or Ms. Cobbs-Hoffman? Do you have a preference?
A. Dr. Hoffman would be fine.
Q. Okay. Dr. Hoffman, have you ever had your deposition taken before?
A. Yes, I have.
Q. On approximately how many occasions?
A. Three times.
Q. And have you ever testified at a trial before? A. Yes, I have.
Q. On how many occasions?
A- One time.
Q. And was that the Boeken case that you testified in?
A. Yes, it was.
Q. And the cases in which you've had your deposition taken, do you recall the names of those cases?
A. One, I don't. The others I recall were the Daniels case and the Boeken case.
Q. Okay. And in all three occasions in which you've had your deposition taken, were you deposed as an expert witness?
A. No.
Q. Okay. How many depositions were you deposed as an expert witness?
A. I was deposed as an expert witness in two cases.
Q. Okay. That would be the Daniels and the Boeken case?
A. That's correct.
Q. The third case in which you can't recall the name, were you a party to that case?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Were you the defendant or the plaintiff? Do you recall?
Q. Okay. And do you have a recollection as to the general nature of that case in which you were a defendant?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. What is that recollection?
A. It was a real estate matter.
Q. Did it arise out of a sale of a property in California?
A. Yes, it did.
Q. Okay. Were you the seller in that transaction or an agent?
A. I was the seller.
Q. And do you recall where that case was venued?
A. The case was here in San Diego.
Q. And do you recall approximately when that case was filed?
A. That case I believe was filed in 1990.
Q. Do you feel sufficiently familiar with the deposition process so that I could skip the standard admonitions, or would you like me to go over some of the ground rules of a deposition?
A. I feel familiar, but on the other hand, I want to make sure that if you have any particular admonitions, that I hear them.
Q. Okay. Generally, I like to go over with the witness what the ground rules are of a deposition so we're all on the same page and that we can have a clean record. The first rule, and the court reporter mentioned this earlier, that we need to speak one at a time. In the general course of conversations, we can predict the ends of each other's sentences quite often. However, in a deposition proceeding, we need to both be careful to let the other one finish before we begin at an answer or begin another question.
Do you understand that?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. Also, all communications must be verbal.
Shrugs of the shoulders, nods of the heads don't come out well on the record. Maybe yours will because we're on a video. But generally, they don't make for a good record. So all of our communications need to be oral, and we need to use words such as "yes" and "no" instead of "uh-huh" and "huh-uh."
Do you understand that?
A. Yes, I do understand that.
Q. And once in a while we may forget those rules. I do, anyway. If I remind you of those rules, I don't mean to be critical of you. I just want to have a clear record, so I just don't want you to take a
personal offense of me reminding you of those types of rules.
Are you currently on any medications?
A. No, I'm not.
Q. Okay. Is there any reason why you can't give your best testimony today?
A. No, there isn't.
Q. Okay. After today's proceeding is completed, you'll have a written record of the transcript, that is, all the questions and answers given. You'll have an opportunity to review that transcript and make any changes or corrections that you deem necessary. And then you'll sign that transcript under penalty of perjury.
Have you done that in the past?
A. Yes, I have.
Q. Okay. If you make substantive changes to the testimony, we may comment on that at the time of trial, and it may affect your credibility as a witness, if you do in fact testify in trial on this matter.
Do you understand that?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. We need your best testimony today, so if you don't understand a question or it's confusing or compound, which sometimes that happens, just let me
know, and I'll rephrase it. Okay?
A. All right.
Q. Dr. Hoffman, you've been retained as an expert in this case; correct?
• A. That is correct.
Q. On which party's behalf are you an expert?
A. I'm an expert on behalf of the defendants.
Q. Okay. All of the defendants or just some of them, if you know?
A. I believe so.
Q. And what is your understanding of the purpose of your retention in this matter?
A. The purpose, as I understand it, is to testify as to the historical context of awareness about the hazards of smoking, including the hazard of addiction in California.
Q. Now, when you say "awareness," do you mean -well, let me ask you what you mean by "awareness."
A. Historians are typically very interested in the culture of a society, and in this particular case, I'm interested in historically what people knew about the hazards of smoking, as well as what the efforts were of the public health community to educate people as to these hazards. And so common awareness in this sense is the common culture of a society and what
people know within a society.
Q. Okay. And is there a particular time frame that you're concentrating on in your analysis of the common awareness of the smoking risks and addictive -you said addictive nature of cigarette smoking? Is that what you said?
A. That's what I said.
Q. Okay. Is there a particular time frame you're concentrating on?
A. Yes, there is.
Q. Okay. What is that time frame?
A. I'm looking at the period between 1900, approximately, and the year 2001, because as I understand it, that's the end of the class period in this case.
Q. Okay. And when were you first retained in this case?
A. I was first retained in this case last summer, approximately.
Q. And who was your first contact, if you recall?
MS. TYLER: Objection. Vague and ambiguous.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. You know what I mean. Who was your first contact in this case?
A. Actually, I'm not actually sure what you mean
by that.
Q. Okay. Who first contacted you to work in this case?
A. Well, I had a meeting with a group of attorneys.
Q. Okay.
A. And they included Martin Bern, Julia Tyler, Robert Wright, and some other individuals whom I'm not recalling the names of at the moment.
Q. That was approximately last summer?
A. Last late spring, early summer, yes.
Q. And did one of these attorneys first telephone you in order to set up the meeting, or do you recall that first contact?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. Okay. Who was it that first contacted you?
A. Julia Tyler called me on the phone.
Q. Did she identify herself as an attorney?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And do you recall whom she represented?
A. She represents the firm of Johnson, Tyler & Purvis.
Q. Okay. And what defendant did she represent, if you recall?
A. As I understand it, she represents Phillip
Morris.
Q. And do you recall the substance of your first conversation with Ms. Tyler?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. Could you tell me what you recall about that conversation.
A. She told me that she would like to meet with me with a group of attorneys about the Brown case in San Diego.
Q. Okay. Did she tell you at all about the case?
A. Not on the telephone.
Q. And do you recall anything else about your conversation, your first conversation with Ms. Tyler regarding the Brown case?
A. No, I don't.
Q. So at that point in time, you didn't know what kind of case it was, or did you get a little bit of a background in some other manner?
A. I understood it was a tobacco litigation case.
Q. Uh-huh.
A. And at that time, I was working on the Daniels case, so I understood that there was similarity between the two.
Q. Okay. Do you recall anything else about your conversation, your initial conversation with Ms. Tyler
regarding this case?
A. I don't recall any additional information.
Q. Okay. And approximately how long after that initial conversation did you attend a meeting with a group of attorneys that you mentioned?
A. I don't remember the precise time period, but I'm going to guess it was within a few weeks.
Q. One other admonition or ground rule I forgot to explain to you, which you assured my memory, there's a difference between a guess and an estimate. If I ask you to estimate the length of this table in this room, you would be able to do that based upon your visual observation. If I asked you to estimate the length of my desk in ray office, you would have to guess because you've never been there.
So I would like to get your best estimates. I understand that nobody's memory is perfect, but if you could give me your best estimates in response to my questions without guessing. If you would need to guess in order to respond to my question, just let me know. Just say "I would need to guess in order to respond to that question," and we can move on. Okay?
A. Thank you.
Q. So your prior answer was really an estimate more than a guess?
A. No. To be honest, it was truly a guess. I just don't remember the amount of time.
Q. All right. And your first meeting with the group of attorneys, do you recall the substance of the conversations conducted during that meeting?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Could you relate to me your recall of those conversations.
A. Well, one of the things that I recall is that the point was made that this was being --a trial being held in San Diego in the same courtroom as the Daniels case.
Q. Do you recall anything else about your conversations during that meeting?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay.
A. I recall that the issues in the case, again, were very similar to the Daniels case in that they concerned the question of how people in California perceived or what they knew about the hazards of smoking, and also that in this particular case, it's a very broad group of people because unlike in Daniels, which concerned only minors, that this concerned people of all ages who might have smoked.
Q. Okay. Anything else? Do you recall anything
else about that meeting?
A. I recall that another prominent issue in the case, as I was told, concerned the public's perception of low-tar and low-nicotine cigarettes and the activities the public health community to educate people about low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes.
Q. Okay. Anything else, or is that basically it?
A. Give me a moment.
Q. Okay.
A. Well, I'm sorry. That's all I'm recalling at the moment.
Q. All right. And had you already agreed to act as an expert witness for the defendants in the Brown matter at the time that you met with the attorneys?
A. No, I had not.
Q. Okay. So when was it that you were -- that you agreed to act as an expert witness for the defendants?
A. I agreed and began working on the case in approximately July of last year.
Q. Okay. Did you have any other communications with the defendants' attorneys regarding the scope of your role in this case as an expert witness prior to your agreement to act as an expert witness on behalf of the defendants?
Q. Okay. At the meeting --at your meeting with the group of lawyers, did they ask you whether you had in fact developed any opinions regarding the extent of the public knowledge on the hazards of cigarette smoking in California?
A. Do you mean at that first meeting?
Q. Yes.
A. Okay. Well, we discussed a little bit the findings that I had already arrived at because of my involvement in previous cases.
Q. Okay. And you had worked with this group of defendants in other cases or some of the lawyers that represented some of the defendants in other cases; is that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. That would have been the Phillip Morris lawyers in the Boeken case; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And the same group of lawyers in the Daniels case; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And at that meeting, did the lawyers explain to you any additional work that you needed to complete in order to fulfill your assignment in this matter?
Q. Okay. Did you explain to them any work that you felt you needed to do in order to complete your assignment in this matter?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. What was that?
A. Well, one of the things, of course, I certainly needed was to see the complaint and the depositions, so that's one of the things I asked for so that I could study the case before undertaking it.
Q. Anything else?
A. I think that as -- as the case was explained to me verbally at the time and based on my previous experience in other cases, I believe that I explained to them that I would want to do additional research, for example, on this issue of low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes on the historical issue of advertising, and also to review additional information on the period 1900 to 2001 regarding people's knowledge of the hazards of smoking, including addiction.
Q. And have you completed all of the research that you intend to conduct in order to formulate your final opinions in this case?
A. I have completed substantially my research, although my research is ongoing, so I can't say I've
completed it in toto.
Q. Do you at this point in time feel as if you have reached your final opinions that you intend to testify to at the time of trial in this case?
MR. KOETHE: Object. Vague and ambiguous.
THE WITNESS: Could you rephrase that for me.
BY MS. KARAVATOS!
Q. Is there any more work that you feel that you need to complete in order to express your final opinions in this case today?
MR. KOETHE: Same objection.
THE WITNESS: Well -MR. KOETHE: You can answer.
THE WITNESS: I would -- with the caveat I made a minute ago, because my research is ongoing, there may be additional information I'll add, but I feel substantially ready to express my findings.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Okay. You had mentioned that you needed to see the complaint and some depositions and conduct additional research on the low-tar advertising. Is that an accurate summary of the additional work that you felt you needed to do in this matter in order to develop your final opinions in the case?
A. I think that that's substantially what I just
said, although I did add, I think, a third area which is the general-knowledge questions, because that research really is ongoing for me.
Q. Okay. But you're focused on past general knowledge; is that correct?
A. I'm focused on the period 1900 to 2001.
Q. So basically you're looking at the past from today? You're not looking at the actual state of knowledge today; is that correct?
A. Well, in this particular case, as a historian and studying the past, although, of course, the past is very recent and 2001 was just last year, so there is additional information that comes in all the time. And because this is an unfolding issue, it's also the case that I continue to collect information up to the present.
Q. Okay. The additional research that you felt you needed to conduct, have you completed that to a substantial degree?
A. Yes, to a substantial degree.
Q. And what research have you conducted in order to reach your final opinions in this case?
A. Well, a wide variety of kinds of research. As a historian, I take into account all kinds of different sources. One of those sources would be government
programs, for example, so I did additional research on the efforts of the public health community, which includes both governmental and nongovernmental agencies to advocate for the promotion, the manufacturing, the advertising, the testing and of course the use of low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes as an alternative to regular cigarettes.
Q. Did you have any research assistants that compiled information for you in order to assist you in your work in this case?
A. Yes. I have a research assistant who retrieved information for me from various archival depositories.
Q. And what is the research assistant's name?
A. His name is Leland Smith.
Q. And is he still an assistant of yours in this matter, or - -
A, Yes, he is.
Q. How long has he been a research assistant for
you?
A. He has been an assistant for me for approximately two years.
Q. Is he a graduate student?
A. No, he is not.
Q. Okay. What are his qualifications, just in
general?
A. He has a Master's degree in history, and he's an archivist.
Q. I learned a new word right now, "archivist." It's a good word to know.
And do you employ Mr. Smith directly, or is he employed by the university?
A. I do not employ him directly.
Q. And do you know who his employer is?
A. His employer is the University of California at Irvine.
Q. Just briefly, I'd like to go over your background a bit, if we could. If you could just describe for me your general educational background after high school.
A. So you don't want me to begin with elementary?
Q. No, please.
A. After high school, I was an undergraduate student at the University of California San Diego. I graduated from there in 1983. After that I attended Stanford University in Palo Alto where I received my Master's degree in 1984 in U.S. history. And I received a Ph.D. there in 1988, also in U.S. history.
Q. I must have missed it. Did you mention what your undergraduate degree was in?
Q. Okay. What was that?
A. It was in literature.
Q. And do you have any published materials?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. Is it a lengthy list, or is it something we could go over in less than ten minutes?
A. Less than ten minutes,
Q. Okay. Can you list for me what your published works consist of? Just the title and the date would be fine.
A. Certainly. I have three books. The book titles are in chronological order. The first one is called "The Rich Neighbor." Sorry. The title changed. I'm trying to remember the old title and the new title. "The Rich Neighbor Policy: Rockafeller and Kaiser in Brazil." That was published in 1982 by Yale University Press.
My second book was "All You Need Is Love: The Peace Corps and The Spirit of the 1960s." That was published in 1998 by Harvard University Press.
My third book is called "Major Problems in American History, Reconstruction to the Present." And that was published last year by Hoton Mifflin & Company. I also have articles in various publications. Harvard's
Business History is one of them. "Diplomatic History" is another. And I have book chapters in a couple of different books. One is called "Exporting Democracy." Another book was called -- I just don't remember the title of that book. And then as I said, I have various articles in different journals and magazines and newspapers.
Q. Have you ever written any published works on the tobacco industry?
A. I have no books on the tobacco industry. However, I have -- tobacco issues are a part of my third book.
Q. And you mentioned your third book was published last year. That was 2001?
A. Yes.
Q. Are there specific chapters devoted to the tobacco industry in that book?
A. The chapters concern major issues in American history so that, for example, there's a chapter on the 1920s. In the chapter on the broader issues of the 192 0s, there is -- there are references to smoking as a cultural issue in the 1920s.
Q. And is that the extent of your book's devotion to tobacco issues?
A. No, it isn't.
Q. Okay. Could you explain the other manners in which your book addresses tobacco and the tobacco industry?
A. Yes, I can.
Q. Okay. Please do.
A. There's another chapter that comes right before that that's on the progressive period in American history, which was a period of reform and reform movements. And one of the important reform movements at the turn of the century, the last turn of the last century before the last one, was smoking and the use of cigarettes. So there is a document in that chapter from Henry Ford from his book "The Little White Slaver."
Q. And are there any other manners in which the tobacco issues are addressed in that book, other than what you've already explained?
A. Not that I recall.
Q. Okay. And since you obtained your Ph.D. in 1988, have you done any further work towards any other degrees?
A. No, I have not.
Q. And could you just briefly go over your employment history since high school, if it coincided with your academic work and after you graduated from
Stanford?
A. Certainly. My academic appointments have been several. I worked for one year when I first received my Ph.D. as a lecturer at the University of California San Diego. That was not a tenure track position, however. So the next year I applied for and received a position at the University of San Diego, which is a Catholic university here in town. And I worked there for nine years during which I was - - I advanced to associate professor, which is a tenured level, and I also directed the university's honors program there, which is for undergraduates, and additionally the last year I was there, I served as the chair of the history department.
Then in 1989 -- pardon me -- 1998, I was offered a position at San Diego State University as an endowed chair in American history, and so I've been working there ever since. There was also a period of time, however, where I had an appointment as a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C. That was during my tenure at UCSD.
Q. And what's your title at this time at San Diego State University?
A. My formal title is the Dwight E. Stanford chair in American foreign relations.
Q. Sounds interesting.
A. Thank you.
Q. You had mentioned earlier that one of your assignments in this case was to examine advertising; is that accurate?
A. I wouldn't call it an assignment, but as much as that this was what I thought was important based on having read the complaint and having heard the complaint described. And so in that sense, I took it upon myself to do research on the issue of advertising as it's been presented to and understood by the general public in California.
Q. Okay. In order to conduct research in advertising, what steps did you take?
A. Let me make this clear. By research in advertising, I want to clarify I'm not an advertising expert.
Q. Uh-huh.
A. But historians are always very interested in the range of information to which people are exposed.
So advertising would be one component of the input in a way that people are getting over time.
Q. And when you examined what people are exposed to, you look at education; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. You look at advertising?
A. That's correct.
Q. And what other facets do you look at to reach your conclusions on what people are aware of?
A. Well, one of the things that I looked at, because I think this is a very important part of analyzing a society, are its laws, both the laws at the federal level in the case of the United States, but also the state laws and local laws in this case, as they applied to the use and sale and possession of tobacco, so that's certainly one important part of what I did do research on.
Q. Any other areas or categories of information that you researched to formulate your opinions?
A. Yes. Another important one is the realm of popular culture since popular culture reflects values and beliefs and knowledge, and in that respect, I looked at television, both -- you know, one could say the fictional aspect of television, sitcoms and movies and that kind of entertainment, and also the more informational or not factual, nonfictional aspects of television like news broadcasts, so that was one element of popular culture, but there were others as well, like radio and songs, slang, magazines, and I guess in a way you could put newspaper in that same
category. And so I looked at newspapers also to explore these issues.
Q. Do magazines figure into that equation as well?
A. Yes.
Q. And did you focus on any particular newspapers and magazines in_your research?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. And which were those?
A. The newspapers I focused on were the San Diego Union and the Los Angeles Times, and I also drew articles from the Sacramento Bee and the San Francisco Chronicle. With regard to magazines, I gave some attention to the magazines that the plaintiffs named, plaintiffs in this case, as publications they had read, and I also looked more generally, in a way, at the universe of magazines that the general public would have been exposed to, particularly the most popular magazines like Reader's Digest and then, you know, other popular magazines.
Q. Did you conduct any surveys in the course of your work in developing your opinions in this case?
A. Well, historians typically use surveys and polls, but I did not personally conduct any.
Q. Did you examine any that had already been
conducted?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Could you describe those surveys to me?
A. Certainly. Some of the most important ones were the Gallup Polls, the Roper polls, some of the Field Polls, but then also there are quite a number of surveys that have been done in California by the California Department of Public Health, for example, and there are surveys that are conducted for the Centers for Disease Control, so I looked at a sampling of surveys and polls from a variety of well-known, very reputable sources.
Q. And the sources that you have just mentioned, are those the universe of the surveys that you've examined in order to develop your opinions in this case?
A. Those are the ones I'm recalling off the top, but there's a list of -- you know, of one of the things
I	looked at that we already gave you, so there may be things on there that I'm just not recalling at the moment.
Q. Okay. And in the course of your examination of these surveys, is it your practice to review the reported summary of these surveys, or is it your practice to actually examine the underlying data that
supports the conclusions of the surveys?
MR. KOETHE: I object to the question. I think it's compound, and it's vague and ambiguous.
THE WITNESS: I'm not clear, actually, what you mean by the "underlying data," so perhaps you could clarify that just a little bit.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. I'll give you an example. For example, if a survey was based on a written questionnaire filled out by a sampling of the population, would it be your practice to request and examine the actual questionnaires themselves, or would it be your practice just to review and rely upon the reported results from those types of surveys?
A. I would have access, really, only to what's in the public domain. And so, for example, I assume that some of these interviews -- some of these interviews I know were conducted over the phone, and I imagine that the people who were conducting them might have been checking boxes or something, but no, I don't ever get to see the stuff that's underneath, so to speak. I rely upon the printed results.
MS. KARAVATOS: Can we go off the record for just a minute?
VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record. The time is
9:55 A.M.
(Discussion off the record.)
VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the record. The time now is 10:06 A.M.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Before we took a break, we were discussing some of the sources you consulted in developing your opinions in this case, and you had listed for me newspapers that factored into your analysis. And you had mentioned the San Diego Union, the L.A. Times, Sacramento Bee, the San Francisco Chronicle; is that correct?
A. Those are the ones I mentioned, yes.
Q. Were there any other newspapers that you consulted in performing your analysis to reach your opinions in this case?
A. There were a few that I looked at particular articles from, but those were the major ones, and on my list there's some others that are listed.
Q. Okay. And when you refer to your list, are you referring to a list of reliance materials that you prepared in this case?
A. I'm referring to the list of historical materials that I reviewed that we gave to your office or to the office of the plaintiffs, offices
representing the plaintiffs anyway.
Q. Okay. Let me see if I have that handy.
A. By the way, may I clarify something for the record?
Q. Sure. Of course.
A. Because I realized a few minutes ago that I had said I started working on this case in the summer of last year, or something like that. What I meant was this year. We're almost at the end of the year. I guess I've already turned the calendar in my head.
What I meant was 2002.
Q. Thank you.
A. Sure.
Q. I'm going to hand you a document. Actually it's a compilation of documents which purports to be your entire file in this matter.
MS. KARAVATOS: And I'll mark this document as 3196 .
(The document was marked as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit 3196 and is made a part of this deposition.)
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. And ask if you could take a look at it and ask if you recognize it.
A. Yes, I recognize this group of documents.
Q. Could you describe for me what this group of documents consist of?
A. Yes, I can describe it. This is -- this first set of documents here are from the file that I have called the Brown Case, and it's the notes that I took after reading the depositions that I received last summer from the named plaintiffs primarily.
Q. Okay.
MR. KOETHE: Let's note for the record that that consists of 13 pages of handwritten notes.
THE WITNESS: Did you want me to talk about the other documents?
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Yes, if you could just go through and identify.
A. Yes. The next document is a chronology that I compiled concerning the efforts of the public health community, which would include scientists, for example, at the federal level and public health officials at the local level and the state level to promote the use of less-hazardous cigarettes, as they were sometimes called. They're known by various names. Low-tar, low-nicotine is the other very common term. So the chronology that I wrote.
MR. KOETHE: Again, for the record that's an
eight-page typewritten document entitled "Less Hazardous Cigarettes, Elizabeth Cobbs-Hoffman, Ph.D."
THE WITNESS: The next group of documents is a series of billing statements that I devised, where I reported the hours that I worked on this particular case.
MR. KOETHE: That's five pages of bills.
THE WITNESS: And the next document is a list of materials that I reviewed in this case that I compiled so as to let the plaintiffs' attorneys know the materials upon which I will be drawing and will be presenting in the trial, if this case comes to trial.
MR. KOETHE: Again, that's titled "Brown LCH Materials," dated 12/11/2002, appears to be 60 pages, typewritten.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. And the Brown LCH materials, are those materials that you've relied upon in developing your opinions in this case?
A. I hesitate to use the word "relied" for the simple reason that there are several thousand documents, and so I can't tell you that every sentence of every document is something upon which I would rely.
But the materials are very important for showing the historical context of cigarette smoking as an
important historical controversy and, you know, what people knew again of the hazards of smoking and the low-tar issue and the advertising issue.
Q. Okay. You would consider the documents listed here to be relevant to your analysis?
A. Yes. That's a very good word. They're relevant.
Q. Do you have a copy of all of these documents in a file somewhere in your office or some other location?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. Okay. Where do you keep your file that reflects a copy of the documents listed?
A. I keep files in my home office, and I keep some information in my office at the university.
Q. There's a particular file that you keep that contains all the documents listed on your LCH materials document?
A. Well, they all wouldn't fit in one file, if that's what you mean. It would be a very fat file. I keep them in file drawers, you know, individual files for the most part.
Q. Okay. But you do have a hard copy of each one of these documents?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. And they would be located in either your home office or your office at the university?
A. That's correct.
Q. You're not sure which one, or is it both?
A. Oh, it's both.
Q. Okay. Have you been requested to provide a copy of those documents to your -- to the lawyers that retained you in this case?
A. Yes.
Q. Have you done so?
A. Yes, I have.
Q. Approximately how long ago did you provide a copy of all these documents?
A. It would vary a little bit, because some of the documents are from a prior case, and so those documents I provided at the time I was working on those cases. But some I would have provided very recently, even within the last week.
Q. Were you provided any documents from any of the lawyers in this case to consider, aside from the documents you've already identified, that is, the deposition transcripts, the complaint, and I believe that's all you mentioned?
A. Yes. There were a couple of documents that got lost. In other words, I provided them from a
previous case, and I went and looked back, and I couldn't find my original copy, and I think in the copying process, an original or two got sent, so I asked for copies of those.
Q. Is that the extent?
A. Yes, that's the extent of it.
Q. Okay. I'm going to do a little housekeeping before I get into more about your research. I have a document that's seven pages that's entitled "Curriculum Vitae, Elizabeth Cobbs-Hoffman," and I'm sorry, I have only one copy. Could you take a moment to look at that document and let me know if you recognize it.
A. Yes, I do.
Q. Could you identify that document, please.
A. This appears to be a copy of my curriculum vitae that I composed and continuously update.
Q. All right.
A. It's a very poor copy.
Q. Is that your most recent CV?
A. No, it's not.
Q. Okay. You have one that's more recent than that?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. Do you have it with you by any chance?
A. No, I'm sorry, I don't.
MS. KARAVATOS: I'm going to mark that document, regardless, as 3197.
(The document was marked as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit 3197 and is made a part of this deposition.}
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. And I'll ask you, was this -- when was -- how many times has this been updated since that version?
A. It's hard to say, but I do recognize that my third book isn't on the list, and I believe I've written at least perhaps two more articles for the San Diego Union or maybe three since this -- since this list was composed, so it's just a little out of date chronologically. That's all.
Q. Okay. Perhaps six months or more?
A. Six -- yeah, six to nine months, I'd say.
Q. Okay. But in all other respects, everything on Exhibit 3197 is true and correct?
A. That's right.
Q. The next document I'd like you to take a look at I'll mark as Exhibit 3198.
(The document was marked as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit 3198 and is made a part of this deposition.)
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Again, I only have one copy. I apologize.
But it is a two-page document entitled "Declaration of Mark H. Epstein in Support of Defendants' Joint Expert Designation Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section
2	034" on the Brown pleading. It has Page 1 and Page 4. I'd like for you to take a look at it and call your attention to Paragraph 7 under the name "Elizabeth Cobbs-Hoffman."
A. Yes. What's your question?
Q. Have you seen that document before?
A. I'm not sure I've seen this particular document, but I certainly remember this general description of my qualifications in the areas in which I would testify. I don't recall ever meeting somebody named Mark Epstein, although I may have.
Q. You recall seeing that general description that's reflected on Page 2 in some other written form; is that accurate?
A. Yes, I recall seeing this description.
Q. Okay. Is that description, that written description located anywhere in your file that we've marked as Exhibit 3196?
A. No, that description wouldn't be in there.
Q. Where would that description be?
A. I don't own a copy of that description, but
I've seen it before.
Q. I see. Are there any other documents that you've received or that you have generated in this matter that are not located within Exhibit 3196, aside from the documents we have identified as just listed there?
MR. KOETHE: I'm going to object. I think it's compound and vague and ambiguous.
MS. TYLER: Assumes facts not in evidence.
THE WITNESS: Actually I was going to ask you to take that question apart a little bit.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Uh-huh. It's simple. All I'm asking is are there any other documents that either were generated, that you generated in this case or that you received in this case that aren't either located here as a copy within Exhibit 3196 or listed?
A. So I guess you're asking is this a comprehensive list of the materials that I've looked at in this case?
Q. Correct. Have you looked at or generated any other documents in this case that aren't either in Exhibit 3196 or listed?
A. Let me clarify that. I've read many/ many things on this topic and on the topics as I described
them, and so not everything I've ever read on that subject is on the list because otherwise, it would just be too voluminous, and so I selected the things that I thought would be most relevant and pertinent to the case as it would be presented in the trial. So that's --in that sense, it's a comprehensive list of what I can think of that seems particularly germane.
Q. Right. I'm sorry.
A. That's okay.
Q. I didn't explain that question as well as I could have. Let me just ask you, did you receive any correspondence from any of the lawyers that retained you in this case, copies of which are not in Exhibit 3196?
A. No, I did not.
Q. Did you receive any e-mails from any lawyers in this case?
A. No, I did not. Very helpful clarifications.
Q. Did you send any -- did you send any e-mails to any lawyers in this case?
A. No, I did not.
Q. Did you send any letters other than what we have here in Exhibit 3196 to any of the lawyers in the case?
A. No. Our communications were pretty much all
verbal.
Q. Okay. When do you recall reviewing a written , summary similar to what I've shown you in Exhibit 3198?
A. My best estimate is a couple of months ago.
Q. Was that at a meeting with the lawyers?
A. Yes. It was at the time we talked about designating me as a witness.
Q. And you've had a chance to review Paragraph 7 on Exhibit 3198. I'll hand it back to you. But I want to ask you if the subject matters for your testimony as described there -- is that accurate according to your understanding of what your role iB in this case?
A. These are very broad generalizations, and so I think that they do accurately represent the broadest categories of what I'll be talking about. Of course, it's to me akin to when you're going to write a book and somebody says, "Can you tell me what the book will say in one sentence?" Which is actually something we try to do, but that one sentence, of course, simply suggests the breadth and the scope of the matter. But there will be many particulars and subsidiary points that are under that.
Q. But there aren't any other general categories that you anticipate providing testimony on at the time of trial; is that accurate?
A. I would expect that I may be asked about other areas by you or by the defendants' attorneys that might fall outside of this, or I may perhaps may be asked to do additional research at this point. But at this point, I think this is a good broad description.
Q. Okay. Good. In conducting your research in order to reach your final opinions in this case, did you assign to Mr. Smith the task of compiling all of the information for you to review, or did you actually conduct the searches yourself?
A. I did a combination of asking him to retrieve documents that I thought would be important for me to look at, and I also went to the libraries and to the archives myself.
Q. And in communicating with Mr. Smith his assignment, if you will, in assisting you with this matter, do you recall what instructions you gave him?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. What were those instructions?
A. Well, they would be updated continuously. For example, I might find out a book that I wanted to get, and I would ask him, "Could you please get that book for me?" Or I would ask him about, you know, could he do an Internet search on a particular subject and retrieve for me the relevant documents off the -- off
the Internet. So those would be some of the kinds of things he would do.
Q. Uh-huh.
A. Or I might ask him to go to a library and get copies of particular magazine articles and to make copies of the articles for me so that I could actually do the reviewing of them.
Q. In conducting your research on this case, did you or Mr. Smith do any searches that would reveal publications in which any of the defendants were interviewed or quoted?
A. No.
Q. Okay. Did you do any research -A. I'm sorry. You know, may I back up?
Q. Sure.
A. Because I'm not a lawyer, I have to always think about those two words, "defendant" and "plaintiffs" and remember who is on which side. In which the defendants were quoted?
Q. Yes.
A. Yes, there would be, for example, newspaper articles defendants -- rather, their representatives would be quoted.
Q. Right. Did you search for all articles within, say, 1993 to 2001 from the publications that
you've listed that you consulted? Did you search for all articles in which the defendants were quoted?
A. I didn't take that as a subject of search, per se. I was looking more at the issues that I described to you.
Q. Okay. Did you search magazine articles for interviews of any of the defendants' representatives?
A. Again, as I explained, the focus is really not on the defendants. It's on the -- in a way, on the plaintiffs and that group as a class, so I was most interested in finding out about common knowledge regarding the issues, rather than, for example, doing a research or a history of the defendants.
Q. Okay. You had mentioned that you had reviewed some of the information that was published, if you will, by some of the public health organizations; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And sometimes the representatives of those organizations would be interviewed for newspaper articles or magazine articles; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Did you review magazine and newspaper articles in which these public health representatives were interviewed or quoted?
Q. And did you make it a specific point to search for those types of articles in newspapers and magazines?
A. One of the, you know, prominent parts of the research I did was to look at the kinds of warnings that people in the general public heard about cigarettes and addiction and advertising and low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes. And so for example, one of the most important sources of information for people and certainly one of the very most credible was the Surgeon General, so I did a fair amount of work targeted at the Surgeon General or the Surgeons General or the various pronouncements they've made throughout the century.
Q. Uh-huh.
A. So that would be one example of the kind of thing you're talking about.
Q. Did you make it a point to search for all of the articles in which these public health representatives were interviewed or quoted on the cigarette issue?
A. For the most part I wasn't trying to target a particular individual. For example, I didn't put in the director of the National Cancer Institute, please
tell me everything that person ever said- That wouldn't be how I would do it, because what I'm really interested in is the universe of information that people get almost even without trying on cigarettes and on the hazards associated with them. And so, for example, in looking at the Los Angeles Times, I'm just really interested in, you know, all the different ways that people get that, so that, for example, a Dear Abby column to me would be right up there in importance in some ways with an official pronouncement by a governmental official.
Q. Okay. And did you review any advertisements that were placed by any of the defendants in any of the newspapers during what I'll describe as the class period from June of 1993 to April of 2001?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. Okay. Do you recall which ads you reviewed?
A. I recall the ads in kind of a general way, in the sense that, you know, one sees a particular ad. I remember ads for Kools and Marlboro, Camel ads. Those are the ones that come to my mind. Newport I think was certainly another one.
Q. Okay. Do you recall any what I'll call issue advertisements? And I'll show you an example so that you'll know what I'm speaking of.
MS. KARAVATOS: This is a document that I'll mark as Exhibit 3199.
(The document was marked as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit 3199 and is made a part of this deposition.)
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. If you could take a moment to review that document and let me know if you recognize it, as soon as everyone else is finished.
A. You know, they say everything important, you learned in kindergarten, one of which was waiting your turn.
MR. KOETHE: Can we go off the record for a moment?
MS. KARAVATOS: Sure, uh-huh.
VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record. The time is 10:34 A.M.
(Discussion off the record.)
VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the record. The time is 10:35 A.M.
MS. KARAVATOS: I'm going to withdraw the last document as Exhibit 3199, and instead, I'll show you a document that I will designate as Exhibit 3199 instead, entitled "The Tobacco Institute believes the American public is entitled to complete, authenticated information about cigarette smoking and health. The
American Cancer Society does not seem to agree.*'
MR. KOETHE: Okay. For the record, it's a one-page document bearing a TIMN number 0081949, also bearing a trial exhibit number at the bottom bearing the number 18,323, also bears a number in the lower right-hand corner TINY 0003212.
THE WITNESS: I'm sorry, could you rephrase my question, please?
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Yes. Do you recognize that advertisement?
MS. TYLER: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence.
THE WITNESS: I don't -- I don't know if this is an advertisement, but I'm going to take your word for that, but I don't recognize this particular one.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Okay. Are you familiar with the Tobacco Institute?
A. I'm aware of it.
Q. Okay. Are you aware that they're a defendant, the Tobacco Institute is a defendant in this case?
A. I did not -- don't recall that.
Q. You've been retained in this case, but you don't think you have been retained by the Tobacco Institute along with the other defendants; is that
accurate?
A. Well, at the beginning of the deposition, one of the reporters were saying so and so and so, et al., and I don't recall all of the et als at the moment. So it could very well be one of them, and I'm just not recalling it.
Q. So you don't recall whether you have been retained by the Tobacco Institute in this case?
A. I have not been retained by them, per se. I'm aware of -- I have been retained by a particular firm, not by -- actually, that's an important clarification. Perhaps I had been retained by the firm of Munger Tolies. Not by a particular institute or a company. That's how I understand it.
Q. Okay. Being retained by Munger Tolies, do you have an understanding of which defendants designated you as an expert in this case?
A. Yeah, I think that it's the et al that we were discussing earlier. Again, not being an attorney, I'm not exactly sure how they set those up, but it seems to me it's the people that are listed or the companies that are listed here.
Q. All of the defendants, in other words?
A. Yes.
Q. But you're not sure it includes the Tobacco
Institute or not?
A. If you show me -- if I could review the complaint again, then I could refresh my memory about it.
Q. You just don't recall at this time?
A. At this moment, I don't.
Q. Okay. Exhibit 3199 is an example of an issue advertisement. And my question is, do you recall reviewing similar issue advertisements in conducting your research in order to develop your opinions in this case?
MR. KOETHE: I'm going to object to the question. Lack of foundation and assumes facts not in evidence and compound.
You can answer.
THE WITNESS: I'm going to assume -- you know, this is obviously unique to itself, but I have seen other ads which are similar to this in a sense that they talk about the issue of smoking and don't appear to be an ad for a particular product.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Okay. And the documents that fit that description that you've reviewed are listed in your reliance list or, as we discussed earlier, your relevance list; is that accurate?
A. I don't recall -- you know, they may be, but I don't recall specific ads being on the list of materials. As I mentioned earlier, I reviewed a lot of -- a lot of materials, but I didn't put everything -- last thing on the list, so I don't -- I don't know if a particular ad is on there or not.
Q. Okay. You don't know if similar types of ads are on that list?
A. I don't think so.
Q. Okay. Do you think issue advertisements would be relevant to your analysis in assessing what the public knowledge, per se, is on the health risks of smoking cigarettes?
A. Well, as I mentioned before, I think that advertising in general and all of the types of it, examples of it would be relevant to the case to, again, see what the general public was seeing, and so that's why I looked at them.
Q. Okay. And these types would be included in that?
A. That's right.
Q. In conducting your analysis and research in this case, do you recall reviewing any published materials by the Tobacco Institute, pamphlets or brochures, published materials of that nature?
A. Well, I think, for example -- you've just shown me an ad that they did, so this would be the kind of thing I would have been looking at, although as I've said, I don't remember this particular one.
Q. Right. My question really is focused on pamphlets and brochures published by the Tobacco Institute. Do you recall reviewing any such documents in conducting your analysis in this case?
A. I, of course, was mentioning the kinds of places I was looking. For example, the schools and, you know, public domain of newspapers and that kind of thing, you know, generally wouldn't have that in it, so I don't recall seeing any particular pamphlets from the Tobacco Institute.
Q. I'm going to show you another document that I'll mark as Exhibit 3200.
(The document was marked as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit 3200 and is made a part of this deposition.)
MS. KARAVATOS: It's entitled "Women and Smoking," five pages, and it has a TI logo on the first page.
Q. And I ask if you could take a look at that document and let me know if you recognize it.
MR. KOETHE: Just for the record, this document bears a TIMN number 0102598. And again, for the
record, I'm going to object to the use of this. It's a very poor copy. It's not really clear what this is.
And there's no date on it. And there appears to be some handwritten notes on one of the pages that are illegible. But I'll allow you to ask questions about it subject to the objection.
Why don't you take a look at it.
THE WITNESS: I don't recall this particular document.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Okay. Fair enough. The next document I'd like for you to take a look at I'll mark as Exhibit 3201.
(The document was marked as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit 3201 and is made a part of this deposition.)
MS. KARAVATOS: It's a one-page document bearing a Bates number of -- I'm sorry. Correct that. It's a two-page document starting with Bates number 69013702 entitled "The Cigarette Makers of American, Brown and Williamson Tobacco Company, Liggett & Meyers, Inc., Philip Morris, Inc., Lorillard Corp., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company."
MR. KOETHE: I'm going to object to the use of this document on the grounds of lack of foundation, and it's
not clear what this is, where it ran or if it ever ran anywhere in this country.
But you can take a look at it.
MS. TYLER: I object that it's not clear that the two pages of the document as you have marked them relate to one another. I would note that the first page has a 3 and circle, which looks like it could be the last page of a document, and the second page that you've marked may be something entirely independent. It's not entirely clear what we have in front of us.
THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. Would you tell me your question?
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Do you recognize that?
A. No, I don't recognize this particular -- of course, I recognize the warning label: "Smoking is Dangerous to Your Health." But I don't recognize the particular document, otherwise.
Q. Okay. The next document I'd like for you to take a look at I'll mark as Exhibit 3202, a one-page document entitled "I'll fill in the government's blanks. The Tobacco Institute."
(The document was marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 3202 and is made a part of this deposition.)
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. If you could, let me know if you recognize that document, after everyone else looks at it.
MR. KOETHE: Just for the record, this is a document bearing TIMN No. 0133708. It's one page. And again, for the record, I'm going to object on foundational grounds. It's largely illegible and undated and not clear exactly what it is and if it ran anywhere.
THE WITNESS: I would say -- I can't read the typing on it, actually. It's -- I mean, I can read the headline, however, but not the content of the item. "I'll fill in the government's blanks." I don't recognize it at this moment.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Okay.
A. Especially out of context. It's possible that if it were on a page of a newspaper I had seen or something, but I don't know where it ran at all, so it's pretty hard to tell.
Q. You don't recognize it as a document or an ad that you came across doing your research on this case?
A. No, not at this time.
Q. Okay. One of the general items that is included in your expert designation is the statement
that you will testify regarding information to which the people in the State of California have been exposed on issues of claims that smokers of low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes can obtain higher levels of tar and nicotine if they compensate or otherwise alter their smoking behavior.
A. May I see that document that you're reading?
Q. Of course.
A. Yes, that's how it reads.
Q. Okay. Is that accurate?
A. Yes, that's right.
Q. Okay. And what information --do you have an opinion regarding what information the people of the State of California have been exposed to regarding low-tar and low-nicotine cigarettes and -- let me get this quote -- "that they can obtain higher levels of tar and nicotine if they compensate or otherwise alter their smoking behavior"?
MS. TYLER: Objection. Compound.
THE WITNESS: You had to phrase that question very slowly, so I have to tell you I lost the first part of it. Could you break it down a little bit for me?
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Do you have an opinion regarding what information the people of the State of California have
been exposed to regarding low-tar and low-nicotine cigarettes, and that the fact that they can obtain higher levels if they compensate or otherwise alter their smoking behavior?
MS. TYLER: Same objection.
THE WITNESS: I have findings on this phrase that's right here that we just read, so I can tell you about what people were exposed in the State of California to on that issue.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. So you have conducted research to determine what information the people of the State of California were exposed to on this particular issue?
A. Yes, I have.
Q. Okay. And have you reached conclusions from your research as to what information the people of the State of California were exposed to in this regard?
A. Yes, I have.
Q. Okay. And what are those conclusions?
A. My conclusion is that the people of the State of California have been exposed regularly, redundantly and thoroughly on the health risks of low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes, including the dangers that are associated with compensatory habits with regard to those kinds of cigarettes so that, for example, in its
very earliest public literature, the public health service mentioned smokers, that it would be wise -- if they can't quit or if they won't quit, it would be wise for them to switch to low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes, but they must be very careful not to alternate their smoking behavior to compensate for that switch.
Q. Okay. Now, when you say "public literature," are you referring to newspaper advertisements, magazine advertisements or none of the above?
A. I'm referring to the concerted efforts of the public health community in the form of pamphlets, for example. That would be one very good example, and of course, some of those are on my list. One of them was titled "If you must smoke," dot, dot, dot, and then the first thing they asked you to do, "If you must smoke, switch to low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes." So this was conducted in pamphlets, also in public statements to the newspapers. This was also published in the form of the Surgeon General's Reports.
It was also indicated in press conferences and that kind of thing. So there are a lot of different ways in which that information was communicated to the public.
Q. The information you mentioned was with regard to switching to lower-tar cigarettes if you can't quit. But what I'd like to know is where in the public
literature, if anywhere, the dangers of compensatory habits, as you mentioned, with low-tar and low-nicotine cigarettes is explained?
A. That would be in that same literature, so that to go back to the one example I mentioned, in the "If you must smoke" pamphlets, that's where they would also say it's very important not to compensate for this change in the type of cigarette. There were sort of three statements that were typically wound together, one of which -- the first of which really was that the best thing to do is to quit smoking because there is no such thing as a safe cigarette.
And then the concomitant would be but if you must smoke, you're better off switching to a low-tar, low-nicotine brand, but -- and here was the third thing that was pretty much always said in tandem -- if you do make the switch, you should be very careful not to alter your smoking behavior by taking deeper drags on a cigarette or by smoking more of them or by covering up the holes in them. You know, again, there were pretty specific descriptions that typically accompanied this literature.
Q. Okay. If you could take a look at Exhibit 3196 and your reliance list or relevance list, if you could identify for me the documents that you
believe contain these messages from the public health community regarding the dangers of compensatory habits.
A. Sure. Give me a minute because it's tiny print.
Q. Sure.
A. It's a very long list. I can tell you off the top instead of pointing to them. Here's just one example. This is -- these are discussions before Congress. 1967, Item No. 481. Now, here's where -- of course, Congress is a part of the public and congressional hearings tend to be reported to the newspapers as well.
This is one of the places where the public health community, for example, the Surgeon General and a variety of eminent scientists on the subject of smoking testified that they believed their studies and their results had shown that switching to low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes was important as a less-hazardous approach to smoking. I have to tell you that I would have to rereview that document to make sure that in that same place they also said that you shouldn't compensate, because I just don't remember if it's in that particular hearing, although it likely is to be. Let me find others.
Here's another good place to look. Again, I'm not
sure if this is the place, because these are scientific ones. "This is not the direct admonition to the public admonition toward a less harmful cigarette, MCI, monograph 28." Probably in there.
Q. I'm sorry. What's the document number?
A. It's document No. 523.
Here it is. "Document number 533 is -- shows that the U.S. Department of Health, Educational and Welfare pamphlet, "If you must smoke" -- that is what I was referring to earlier. I have several copies of that because it was reprinted and reproduced and redistributed several times, and so there are going to be other ones of them in the same list.
Here's a New York Times article referring to that pamphlet, which again, I'm not sure how thorough the reporting was on the New York Times on that particular day, so I have to look at the article to make sure they mentioned it there.
Q. Sure.
A. But this was generally what was said each time, as I mentioned, when we were talking with the public.
Q. But what was the document number of the New York Times article?
A. Okay. 54 0.
Q. Okay.
A. 558.
Q. That's the same pamphlet, "If you must smoke" --
A. Yes, that's the same pamphlet, another copy of it. It's hard, by the way, to point to them specifically, because I have to review specific materials, but, for example, on 586, it refers to a newsletter of the American Cancer Society, and then that kind of newsletter carried this type of information. I'm not sure if that particular one did. But to point you to the sort of -- kinds of documents I was looking at there.
Some of the news clips --by the way, I'm just reminded as I go through, on the evening news, they would say this kind of thing, that you shouldn't smoke in any way. That's different. And of course, it was also in newspaper articles, but I have to look at the specific articles since I can't remember every line of every article as I'm looking at the headline. I'm looking for the Surgeon General's reports. Can I ask you a question?
Q. Yes.
A. Would you like me to go through the entire 60 pages?
Q. Actually, I would like you to identify the documents that you believe contain the messages from the public health community regarding the dangers of compensatory habits in smoking cigarettes.
A. Uh-huh. And again, let me reiterate. I'll be happy to go through this line by line, but I can't swear on a stack of bibles at each one. Some of them I remember very specifically, and some of them would be the ones that, if I were reviewing this, I would say, okay, I'm sure it was in the ACS Volunteers somewhere, so I need to go back and look at my ACS ones, because this list of course includes the General warnings about smoking and its hazardous -- its hazards to health and its addictive nature.
Q. Okay.
A. I think it's likely in here on 742. These are the proceedings from the Third World Conference on Smoking and Health. The title of the article is "Modifying The Risk For The Smoker," and they refer to Wynder, Hoffman, Gori. Those are important scientists who did a whole lot of work in this area and would typically, in their statements, say that this is safer as long as people don't compensate. So that's another logical place I would be looking.
The same is probably true of 743, which is from
NCI, although I'm not quite as sure there. That's a report by NCI, as the following Item 744. Item 783 is the third report by the National Cancer Institute on this subject. So again, it would be a good chance that particular statement is in there.
In the Items 851, 852, 853 -- this is -- they surround a subject where one of the National Cancer Institute officials, Gio Batta Gori, made statements about safer levels of cigarette use. And I'm not sure -- I just don't recall if he talked about compensation in that, but he was very careful in his choice of words to imply that, you know, it's better not to smoke at all. And I think he may have also had referred to that.
You know, you earlier asked me not to guess, so I have a little bit of trouble in the sense that here's -- from the Los Angeles Times, No. 892, it says "Here Are Tips to Cut the Risk," so I'm not -- again, I'm just looking at the headline there, so I can't tell you every line that's in there.
Q. Uh-huh.
A. But it would likely be in there. The same is true of the following, Item 893, "A Safe Cigarette by Gio B. Gory, the Banbury Report." Item No. 916, "The Health Consequences of Smoking, the Changing Cigarette,
a Report of the Surgeon General." Here under 966 is a newspaper article that -- from the Sacramento Bee that I think would very likely have the same kind of information since the headline reads "Study Doubts Benefits of Low-Tar Cigarettes," and the very next one also, "Low-Tar Cigarettes Declared Useless." This is Item 967 in the San Francisco Chronicle, and also the following Items 968 and 969 and 970.
There was a lot of news coverage of low-tar and low-nicotine cigarettes, as you can see simply by perusing the list. And very frequently, in fact probably most frequently, the criticism that was made of low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes was that people would compensate by smoking them more deeply or in some way altering the -- foiling the design of the cigarette by holding it in an odd way or smoking more of them.
And so as those kinds of studies were released, they were typically reported on in the newspaper, in fact always given very extensive coverage, which you can see partly in the fact that I had to read you four or five numbers in a row because typically what would happen is if a report by a scientist was released stating what I just stated, then newspapers would pick that up off of Associated Press wire or the UPI wire, and so a lot of these stories are literally the same
story, simply reprinted in newspapers across the country and throughout California.
You know, Consumer Reports, Item 979, would probably also pertain. Item 991 from the Sacramento Bee. Item 1040 is from the Los Angeles Times, and it discusses the FTC cigarette ratings, because that has also been a consistent issue related to -- low-tar, low-nicotine is a fact that the machines are machines, and they don't smoke like human beings smoke, and so that's something that's been referred to pretty much since the machines were invented, and that goes back into the 1950s even, but it became especially an important issue after the FTC began issuing its own ratings in the 1960s.
So it appears to me that that article that we're referring to right now is one of those that talks about that. Item 1047 may be quite similar in that respect. Again, Item 1061 referring to "Ultra low-tar Smoke" by the Consumer Reports is a likely spot. Item 1152 may be also relevant because it talks about the cigarette test program being reevaluated, and again almost all of the articles that talked about the testing program were talking about the fact that humans compensate, whereas machines don't. Here is one where I thought I would go to look, Item 1203: "Questions People Ask About
Cigarette Smoking." That's in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services document. And a lot of these public health documents, whether it was Health and Human Services or the American Cancer Society, they frequently would talk about low-tar and low-nicotine( and it's only sort of a last resort and that you've got to be very careful not to use them differently than you would a regular cigarette or your previous cigarette if you had switched.
Again, let me reiterate. I feel a little funny trying to guess at this, because I don't have the particular document in front of me, but I think they're probably good estimates.
Q. Okay.
A. I think Item No. 1308, "The Less Hazardous Cigarette: A Deadly Delusion." In the middle 1980s, the government had, to an important extent, ceased its efforts to encourage people to switch over, and the emphasis really became placed on that people must quit absolutely, and so there was a rejection of scientific efforts, in fact, even to develop a so-called safer cigarette because of the assumption it's never safe.
And so you really begin to see a lot of articles simply saying that. And often the supporting evidence they give for saying it's not safe is that smokers
compensate. So that article was 1308 from the New York State Journal of Medicine.
MS. KARAVATOS: Off the record for just a moment.
VIDEOGRAPHER: This concludes Tape 1 of the deposition of Elizabeth Cobbs-Hoffman, Ph.D. We're off the record. The time now is 11:24 A.M.
(Discussion off the record.)
VIDEOGRAPHER: This is Tape 2 of the deposition of Elizabeth Cobbs-Hoffman, Ph.D. We're back on the record. The time is 12:10 P.M.
MS. KARAVATOS: Back on the record.
Q. Have you had an opportunity to review the list of documents included in Exhibit 3196?
A. Yes, very hurriedly, but I looked it over.
Q. You were in the course of identifying for me the documents that, in your opinion, contained the messages regarding the dangers of compensatory habits in smoking. Is that your understanding?
A. Yes.
Q. And you had already identified quite a few documents for me. The last one I believe was Document No. 1308.
A. That I don't recall.
Q. Okay.
MR. KOETHE: That's right.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Take my word for it.
A. I believe you.
Q. And we broke for 20 minutes or so, and you reviewed the rest of the exhibit and identified by marking which other documents you believe fell within that category; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. Could you read for me what those documents are.
A. Yes. And again, let me preface by saying I read it in a hurry, and also because these are just a brief one-line description of each, I could easily not know offhand if that's the document which has that information in it, so the likeliest thing is underreporting, and it's also possible that I will guess that it's in one of these documents and I would have to go back and double-check the document to be truly certain.
Q. Just your best recollection.
A. My best recollection, I think another place to look would be Document No. 1511, which says "American Cancer Society Pamphlet 'Danger,'" which is from the Bishop's School, which is a local private high school in San Diego. And the American Cancer Society did warn
steadily about why it's dangerous as the others, so that would be a place to look.
Also 1556, which was a San Diego Union article stating that "Study Finds That Smokers Compensate For Cutbacks." The next item, 1527, "Cutting Down May Not Help Smokers," San Francisco Chronicle. That appeared on the same day, so it's likely the same information.
The next item would be 1593. That's an article from the San Diego Union, which says "FTC To Halt Testing of Tar, Nicotine in Cigarettes." I'm not sure what that article is about, but it likely refers to the controversy over machine-smoked cigarettes verses human-smoked cigarettes.
Item 1612 is also from the San Diego Union, and it's titled "Breakthroughs: Low-Yield Cigarette Perils," so that to me again suggests that it's the same kind of subject matter. Under 1625, here it's not quite as clear to me, but it says "The Advice is Basic: Don't Smoke,” and that may be again a reference to that low -- you know, just lower tar, lower nicotine isn't going to help you very much, if at all, and you should just quit. That's in the World -- U.S. News and World Report.
The next item I thought would make sense would be 164 0, Los Angeles Times, "Controversy Heats Up Over
Safer Smokes." And that controversy, to a large extent, tended to revolve around the question of the accuracy of FTC ratings because of compensatory behavior* Item 1662 is a conference from the 66th World Conference on Smoking and Health, and it references -- a reference here to Ernest Wynder. As I mentioned, he was a very prominent scientist who cared a lot about the topic of trying to develop a safer cigarette. He was also, you may recall, the person who first painted mice to discover that tar would create cancer.
1664 is a collection of antismoking articles from the American Heart Association, school site program, and I'm not sure if that has it or not but it could very well. Let me mention here that the schools had a somewhat different approach for the reason that they truly had an absolutist orientation. The presumption was that children weren't smokers, and therefore, there's nothing to be gained from urging them to switch. And so it wasn't the same kind of emphasis as were the pamphlets addressed to adult smokers. On the other hand, those school materials very frequently would point to kids -- point out to kids that there's tar in both kinds of cigarettes. So again, that would not address compensatory behavior, per se, but it's
linked to it in the sense that they're saying any kind of smoking is really harmful, so don't start it at all.
And that kind of statement would have been made in a lot of the school materials, which didn't focus on compensation, but simply said all cigarettes are bad.
I also marked for that reason the Item 1666, which is a State Department of Education price list for health and instructional materials.
Moving on, Item 1760 is an article from the San Diego Union titled "Breakthroughs: Helping Smokers Quit." I'm not again certain what that article says precisely, but I can tell you that a common prescription for helping people quit was to suggest that they switch to a low-tar, low-nicotine brand because there had been studies that suggested that if you could lower your dose of nicotine, it would be like a weaning away of obviously higher doses, and so that's the kind of thing that could have been said in that article and in many other articles and pamphlets where they talked about quitting, again, though, there would be references making sure you don't compensate by smoking more.
Here's one that I'm just guessing, but Item 1806 is a pamphlet from the California Medical Association, which is titled "Five Ways Tobacco Companies Try to
Trick You," and that's Tobacco Free California campaign. And that's -- again, that's the sort of allegation that would be made that the companies wanted you to think that low-tar and low-nicotine was less hazardous, of course even though we knew the label was the same on it, whether it was light or not or a regular cigarette. So it's possible that they would have made those allegations in there and referred to compensatory behavior.
Item 1B75 is from the Sacramento Bee, and it's an article -- an article titled "Heart Risk Isn't Cut by Low-Yield Cigarettes." That's followed by two other articles, Items 1876 and 1877, which are also both articles about light cigarettes and the finding that they're not better for you. I don't know if compensatory behavior would be referred to in those articles, although it's quite likely since that was the common complaint.
Item 1988 is a health book. Here I'm not recalling if it's in that specific book or not, but there are health books for kids where it's referred to that light cigarettes or low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes are not a good alternative, item 2000 is from the Los Angeles Times Business section, and it's titled "New Cigarette Condemned by Health Secretary." I'm guessing there
that this would have been a reference to a low-tar, low-nicotine cigarette, and typically, again, the criticisms of them were that no cigarette is good, so don't try to even develop a safer one because it will make people think that they can safely smoke when in fact they will probably compensate or smoke more.
Item 2 008 is another Los Angeles Times article from a health column columnist, Dr. Neil Solomon, who is an important columnist for the L.A. Times. And it's titled "Reducing Nicotine." That again tips me off to the thought that if it's about reducing nicotine, it's probably about lower-tar cigarettes, or at least it may be about that.
Item 2 085 is a Federal Trade Commission report on "Policy Issues Concerning the Promotion of Less Hazardous Cigarettes." That probably addresses that issue to some extent. Item 2151 refers to an issue of the healthy kids newsletter that's put out by the California Department of Education. And I don't know that this particular newsletter had that in it, but the healthy kids -- that's the kind of thing they talk about. That's distributed to the schools.
Item 2284, I'm guessing a bit here: "Nicoteen:
The Don't Smoke Magazine," published by Scholastic. So it's aimed at teenagers and likely would contain a
warning that you should not think that cigarettes that are advertised as light are less hazardous. Here's one I'm not quite as sure about: Item 2326, "Sex, Drugs and Smoking: Why They're Worse for Women," in Seventeen magazine, but since Seventeen is aimed at girls, for the most part, and this article is talking about how women may tend to perceive smoking somewhat differently from men and women generally want to use things that are light, et cetera, so it's a guess that there might be something there.
Q. What was the number on there? I'm sorry?
A. 2326.
Q. Okay.
A. Near that would be 2328 on "Kicking the Habit," from Time Magazine. There again I'm just surmising that it may be there would be a reference in there because of the advice that was being given around that time period to switch to a lower-nicotine cigarette as a preliminary step in the effort to quit.
Item 2440, "Tobacco Free Challenge Project: Brain Wash." These would be a series of curriculum documents that I'm not sure they have that in there, but I think that would be another place to look. Item 2444 is a book published by Oxford University Press on smoking, politics, law and culture, and I believe that there are
references to that controversy about lights in there.
2538 is another curriculum that's -- that was developed by the American Cancer Society but has been very, very widely used in the states and in California, because the states often adopt curriculum materials that are prepared by the major health agencies. For example, the American Lung Association has a curriculum, and the American Cancer Society. And "The Do It Yourself -- Making Healthy Choices" I think does have references to the lights issue.
Item 2635 is from the San Francisco Chronicle, and it's an article titled "Light Cigarettes May Be Just as Harmful, Experts Say." Right below that is Item 2636, "Low-Tar Cigarette Figures Questioned," San Diego Union. And I think that that's very likely to be an article which talks again about the problem of compensatory behavior by humans.
Item 2655 may also well concern this issue. It's from the Los Angeles Times, and it says "Researchers Try to Separate Smoking Fact From Fiction." And that gets down to this persistent dilemma of how the FTC measures tar and nicotine and the difficulty with the FTC being able to do that in an effective way.
Item 2673 is an ABC Evening News program on smoking and pregnancy, and there I am again making a kind of
educated guess about where to look because I think it's likely they might have said something like, you know, don't think if you're smoking light cigarettes that this is lighter on the fetus, or something like that.
Item 2717 is from the Los Angeles Times. And it says -- it's called, rather, "Panel Calls for Better Way to Measure Tar, Nicotine in Cigarettes," and then right below that, Item 2718 is titled "Tar, Nicotine Ratings Mislead Smokers, Experts Say," San Diego Union. Of course, there they are referring to the FTC's measurements.
Item 2877 is about the attack program in San Diego, which was a theatre program, and it's possible that there are things in there.
Q. Did you say 2 877 or -A. Yes, 2877. Moving on to 2974, this is a National Cancer Institute publication. "Do You Smoke?" Answering the questions -- excuse me. "Answer the Questions Inside to Find Out. Understanding the Reasons You Smoke Can Show You the Best Ways to Quit." This I'm not certain about, but this again may be another reference to ways of weaning yourself away from cigarettes which could include the prescription to try low-tar and low-nicotine.
Item 4307 -- I'm sorry. I said that wrong. Item
3007 and 3009 are references to a color slide presentation developed by the city schools in San Diego, and that -- I actually remember quite specifically part of the slide presentation was to show ads for low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes and then for the presenter of the slide presentation to explain that these aren't any better for you: That, you know, you're just as likely to die from them as from regular cigarettes.
Items 3076 and 3077 are both books, one by Martha Derthick, MUp in Smoke," and the second by Gio Batta Gori, "Virtually Safe Cigarettes," and they both talk about this issue. The second of those items, 3077, particularly does and talks about compensatory behavior and the importance of actually continuing to seek healthier -- healthier is not the right word, but less-hazardous cigarettes. Here's another one, 3142. This is an American Lung Association and American Cancer Society pamphlet called "Tobacco Fact Pack."
I'm not recalling whether this has that information in it specifically, but the American Cancer Society over the years has put out various question-and-answer types of pamphlets where they will say something like our low-tar and low-nicotine cigarettes are better for you, and then they will explain that no, they're still very
dangerous, and people tend to compensate and smoke more of them.
Q. Before we leave that one, I noticed that it doesn't have a date associated with it. Do you have any estimate as to the date that publication was available?
A. You know, that's a very good question. Some of these are not dated for the reason that the agency that publishes it doesn't put a date on it, so as a historian, I generally have to look at the document and actually see the physical document to try and get an estimate, you know, the term circa, circa 2000 or something. Sometimes you can pick up little clues.
For example, I got these from the libraries and libraries will often stamp a pamphlet when it comes in. That even -- that gives you a circa number, though, for the reason that, you know, the library might have gotten it a year late or something like that, so I can't -- I'm sorry, I can't give you an estimate right now, but I could if I went back and took a look at it and found out also where I got it because some of these I got from the schools.
In other words, it might be in the American Lung Association pamphlet, but I got it from Torrey Pines High School, in which I would have a Torrey Pines High
School, you know, collection that would tell me, you know, this was from the same group of materials that they were using in a particular period of time.
Item 3248 is a video called "Confessions of a Simple Surgeon," and this is -- happened to be a particularly popular video used frequently in the schools. Again, I don't remember if there's a scene in this particular video, and that would be the first place for me to look since it was a doctor talking about the subject of smoking and health. Some of those tend to be a little bit more specific when they talk about low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes than some of the other videos. But it's definitely in some of the videos, but I'm not precisely sure which. I'd have to go back to them.
Item 3290, "50 Things You Should Know About Quitting Smoking," would be another one of those pamphlets which would likely tell you this fact, because it says 50 things you should know, so that would probably be pretty comprehensive. And that's it for what I see, off the top anyway.
MR. KOETHE: Karen, we talked about maybe regrouping at 12:30 to figure out where we might want to go from here. We could theoretically break for lunch now, but --
MS. KARAVATOS: I have about an hour tops left to go. And I am fine with breaking for 15, 2 0 minutes or breaking for a whole lunch period, either way. It would be nice to be able to finish up earlier.
MR. KOETHE: Yeah. Can we just take a two-minute break and chat and decide what we're going to do?
MS. KARAVATOS: Sure.
VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record. The time is 12:32 P.M.
(Recess taken.)
VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the record. The time is 12:40 P.M.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Dr. Hoffman, you were kind enough to identify for me on your list of relevant materials the documents or videos or other communication media that you believed contained the message to the public regarding the dangers of compensatory smoking behavior; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. I'm wondering if any of the documents that you mentioned were actually published by any of the defendants in this case.
A. I don't believe so.
Q. Are you aware of any advertisements by the defendants that contained the message to the public
regarding the dangers of compensatory smoking?
MR. KOETHE: I object to the question. Beyond the scope of her designation.
THE WITNESS: Would you -MR. KOETHE: And vague and ambiguous.
THE WITNESS: Could you restate it for me or rephrase it for me, either?
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Are you aware of any advertisements by the defendants that contain the message to the public regarding the dangers of compensatory smoking?
MR. KOETHE: Same objections.
THE WITNESS: I -- I'm aware that on the Philip Morris web site there are references to the dangers of smoking in general, and there may well be something about that on that. But I'm not certain of that.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Okay. Any other advertisements that you're aware of by the defendants that contain the message to the public regarding the dangers of compensatory smoking?
MR. KOETHE: Same objections.
THE WITNESS: I don't recall that being in the advertisements that I came across, but it could be there, and I'm just not recalling at the moment.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Okay. As we sit here today, you're not recalling any?
A. I'm not recalling any as I speak.
Q. Okay. Do you have any opinion regarding whether compensatory smoking behavior is a conscious behavior by smokers or a subconscious behavior by smokers?
MS. TYLER: Objection. Outside the scope.
MS. BARONI: Lack of foundation.
THE WITNESS: I'm going to try to recall the question. It does seem to me that is a question that asks sort of psychological questions about why people are making the internal choices that they are making, and that's not something I've researched. It's really outside my historical expertise.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Sure. So you don't have an opinion on that subject; is that right?
A. I don't have a professional opinion on that,
no.
Q. Okay. And you weren't retained to render an opinion on that topic; is that correct?
A. I wasn't retained to research that question.
Q. Okay. Do you have any opinion regarding the
prevalence of compensatory smoking behavior among the smoking population in California?
MR. KOETHE: Vague and ambiguous.
MS. TYLER: Outside the scope.
MR. KOETHE: Lack of foundation.
THE WITNESS: That also seems to be almost a medical opinion about the physical behavior, and I -it's not my area of expertise. I researched really the questions I told you about earlier.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Okay. I just want to make sure you don't have an opinion that I'm not asking you about, so I don't mean anything except to exclude that whole line of questioning. If you don't have an opinion on it, I just need to know that.
So you don't -- is it correct, then, that you don't have an opinion regarding the prevalence of compensatory smokers -- compensatory smoking behavior among smokers in California?
MR. KOETHE: Same objections.
THE WITNESS: Well, as I understand the question, it is kind of a medical question about how people smoke and to what extent they smoke in that way, and so all I can tell you is that these articles that I pointed to talk about the problem of people doing that, but beyond
that I couldn't -- I don't think I could go with a professional opinion.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. In conducting your research and analyses regarding the messages to the public, were you ever instructed to avoid or ignore publications by the defendants in this case?
A. No.
Q. Okay. I believe that the earlier part of your deposition you had indicated what your understanding was regarding the scope of your retention in this case. And you had indicated that -- let's see if I can find it -- among other things, that you were retained to offer an opinion regarding what the people in California knew about the hazards of smoking. Is that accurate?
A. I was -- I understood the research objective being to understand that as a historical issue, what people knew and how they came to know that smoking was hazardous, not only to their immediate health but as a long-term addiction.
Q. Okay. And you analyzed what people knew in terms of what information was available in communication media in general in California; is that correct?
A. I was looking primarily at the public domain so these would be materials that would be widely available to people in California.
Q. Did you do any investigation into what people believed to be true regarding the health risks of smoking during the time period from, say, 1993 to 2001 in California? *
A. Yes, I did.
Q. And what did you do to investigate that issue?
A. I looked at the same range of materials that I looked at for the period before 1993. And that would include such things as polls which we discussed earlier, in which, you know, there's an attempt to measure what people believe and think and know. I also looked at popular media because they often give a lot of clues to people's beliefs or the values in a society, so television and radio and popular magazines, jokes.
Q. Uh-huh. And did you form an opinion regarding whether or not people in California believed the messages being received by the public health community regarding the hazards of smoking?
A. Yes.
Q. And what is that opinion?
A. My finding was that there was a widespread
conviction that smoking is very hazardous, that it can imperil the health of any individual who engages in it, that there was a widespread confidence in the statements made by the public health service, both in California and at the federal level.
Q. And is it your opinion that that confidence was relatively constant throughout the class period we have here, from June of 1993 to April of 2001?
A. Yes.
Q. And you also indicated, I believe earlier, that another of your assignments in this case was to determine what people in California knew with regard to the addictive nature of cigarette smoking; is that accurate?
A. That's accurate.
Q. Okay. And did you reach an opinion on that issue?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. And what is your opinion?
A. I found that there was an extremely high awareness of the addictive character of cigarette smoking in California.
Q. And upon what do you base that opinion?
A. I base it upon the same universe of materials that I drew from to arrive at my other conclusions.
There's -- again, there are polls to this effect.
There are educational materials that emphasize the addictive character that, you know, children are required to read and that teachers are required to teach from. That's also reflected in popular culture, in movies and in books, children's books, adults books, et cetera.
Q. And your finding that there was an extremely high awareness of the addictive character of cigarette smoking in California, did that --do you have an opinion as to when that awareness developed in the history of the awareness?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. When was that?
A. Well, it preceded actually the period I'm looking at, but in the period I focused on, 1900 to 2001, that awareness was high and constant throughout that time period.
Q. Okay. From the 1900s?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. So is it your opinion that the people of the State of California generally knew of the addictive character of smoking since the early 1900s?
A. Yes, although I would add that they knew about it before the 1900s, but certainly as of 1900.
Q. Are you aware of any publications by the defendants in this case in 1995 stating that nicotine is not addictive?
A. And you're referring to the year 1995?
Q. Correct.
A. I'm not remembering 1995, per se. There well may have been such statements in 1995, but I'm not recalling those.
Q. Are you aware of any such publications in the 1990s at all?
A. I'm aware that there were hearings before Representative Waxman in Washington, D.C. in 1994 at which the companies were asked if they believed smoking was addictive or not.
Q. Okay. But you're not aware of any publications by the companies or advertisements stating that they believe nicotine was not addictive?
A. I want to be precise for you, and so I'm simply not recalling those, but there very well may have been.
Q. And is it your opinion that the people of the State of California basically didn't believe the testimony by the defendants in Congress in 1994 that nicotine was not addictive?
A. I would testify that they didn't believe the
testimony but that they also didn't understand the testimony.
Q. And what is it about the testimony that you believe that they didn't understand?
A. The testimony was about the medical definition of "addiction" and how that medical definition has permutated over time. And there has been a fair amount of controversy about that definition. And so I believe the public was -- what the public was mostly exposed to was a truncated version, in a way, where the executives from the companies were asked to give yes-and-no answers to the question, and so the public was thinking of addiction in the common parlance and what we generally mean when we say “addiction" rather than understanding that this was a very detailed medical debate.
Q. And what do you base that opinion on? Were you able to interview any of the company representatives that testified during the congressional hearings?
MS. TYLER: Objection. Compound.
THE WITNESS: Since you asked two sentences, I'll begin with the first one, which is that I read the testimony. So that's how I based my conclusions.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Anything else that you base that on?
A. Yes. I also based them on the advertisement that was produced by the California Department of Health Services which then portrayed that testimony in a particular way that I believe was in contrast to what was, you know, the intent of the statements being made during the hearing.
Q. And anything else?
A. No. That's all.
Q. Okay. And the California Department of Health Services publication, is that on your list of relevant materials?
A. Yes, it should be.
Q. And that would be in the area of 1994, '95?
A. Right.
Q. Okay. Do you have any opinions in this case regarding the defendants -- and I'll list all of them instead of using the et al. -- Philip Morris,
Lorillard, Liggett, R.J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson, the Tobacco Institute, and the Council for Tobacco Research -- do you have any opinion regarding whether these defendants disseminated any false information regarding the nature of light cigarettes to the California public?
MR. KOETHE: I object to the form of the question.
It's compound. I think it calls for a legal conclusion. It's argumentative and outside the scope of her designation.
THE WITNESS: Do you mind just restating?
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Sure. Do you have any opinion regarding whether any of the defendants disseminated any false information regarding the nature of light cigarettes to the California public?
MR. KOETHE: Same objections.
THE WITNESS: That seems to me to be outside the scope of what I was researching in the sense that what I was looking at was what Californians knew and it heard, and I did not study the companies specifically.
I wasn't studying their histories or their pattern of activity. And also, I would have to -- have to understand this pattern of legal allegations that you're talking about.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Okay. So as we sit here today, you don't have an opinion on that issue; is that accurate?
A. I don't have a professional opinion on that.
Q. Do you have any opinion regarding whether or not any of the defendants in this case disseminated any false information regarding claimed no-additive
cigarettes?
MR. KOETHE: Again, I'm just going to interpose the same objection I did to the last question. I think it's argumentative. It's outside the scope of her designation and may require a legal conclusion.
MS. KARAVATOS: I'll stip to that continuing objection for this line of questions.
MR. KOETHE: Okay.
MS. KARAVATOS: But I need to know whether she has an opinion on these particular issues.
THE WITNESS: Again, that seems to me almost like -- I need to know the chemistry of it and therefore, what they said is true or not, and that's outside my expertise.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Okay. Do you have an opinion regarding whether or not the defendants made any false statements regarding additives used in the cigarette manufacturing process?
MR. KOETHE: Same objections.
THE WITNESS: Because I don't -- I'm not a chemist and I don't know what things they added and therefore what things they reported accurately or not, so I can't testify to that.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. So you don't have an opinion as we sit here?
A. No.
Q. Do you have an opinion regarding whether the defendants made any false statements regarding the health hazards of cigarette smoking?
MR. KOETHE: Same objections.
THE WITNESS: Again, I think that that's a medical opinion, which I cannot offer.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Do you have any opinion regarding whether the defendants made any false statements regarding the addictive nature of smoking?
MR. KOETHE: Same objections.
THE WITNESS: That also seems to be a medical question which I couldn't answer.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. So you have no opinion?
A. Right.
Q. Okay. Are you familiar with the Voluntary Industry Cigarette Advertising Code?
A. I've seen references to it, yes.
Q. Have you reviewed that code in any form in developing your opinions in this case?
A. I haven't reviewed the code, per se. I've seen newspaper and magazine articles on it.
Q. Did you have any opinion regarding whether any of the defendants violated any provision of the Voluntary Cigarette Advertising Code?
MR. KOETHE: Same objections.
THE WITNESS: That seems to me -- yeah, that actually seems to me to be a -- requires me to draw a legal conclusion, which also I'm not qualified to do,
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. So you have no opinion on that issue?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. Do you have any opinion regarding any of the defendants committed any unfair business practices from the time period of June 1993 to April of 2001?
MR. KOETHE: Same objections.
THE WITNESS: I'm unable to offer a professional opinion on that for the same reasons.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Okay. So you have no opinion on that issue?
A. That's correct.
MS. KARAVATOS: Let me just go off the record for a moment, please.
VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record. The time is 1:04 P.M.
(Discussion off the record.)
VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the record. The time is 1:07 P.M.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Dr. Hoffman, we talked a lot about your opinions today in this case and about your expert designation in this matter and the scope of your retention. And ffiy remaining question is whether or not there are other -- any other topics that at this time you intend to testify to at the time of trial that we haven't yet discussed this morning?
A. As I sit here, there's nothing else that I'm thinking of. However, I'll mention as I think I did earlier that it's entirely possible that the defendants or the plaintiffs may ask me questions which are related but are not a part of what I already immediately testified about. It's also possible that some new issue might get raised and I don't know -- and then I would require additional research. But as of right now, this is, I think, a pretty full explanation.
Q. Okay. In the event that you do develop further opinions, I may request to have another session of your deposition.
MS. KARAVATOS: But at this time I don't think I have any further questions with regard to this witness. I sincerely doubt that any other attorney has any
questions for you.
MR. KOETHE: Can we take just a couple of minutes to chat among ourselves, and then we'll see if we need to do any follow-up.
VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record. The time is 1:09 P.M.
{Discussion off the record.)
VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the record. The time now is 1:15 P.M.
EXAMINATION
BY MR. KOETHE:
Q. Dr. Hoffman, I want to show you what was previously marked as Exhibit 3198, the declaration of Mark Epstein, which has a short summary of the expected areas of your testimony in this case, and I'm going to read a portion of that disclosure. And it indicates that you, quote, will testify regarding information to which people in the State of California have been exposed on the issue of, then there's a Subparagraph 3 to that, stating, "Cigarette Advertising."
Have you formed opinions in this case on that issue?
A. Yes, I have.
Q. And could you briefly state for the record the
opinions that you have formed concerning that third issue?
A. Yes. The findings I came to in regard to that third issue about cigarette advertising were that the schools, the popular media and the various public health services were very, very active in educating people to be skeptical and wary of cigarette advertising, and that the result of that was to create a very high level of consciousness about the importance of taking advertising with, you know, a very cautionary attitude.
Q. And could you state briefly the bases or the grounds for the opinion that you just asserted?
A. Yes. The grounds for this opinion are very similar to the ones for the other two opinions that are listed here in the sense that I looked at the universe of information to which people are exposed, particularly in the schools which have a very, very heavy emphasis on tobacco advertising and the importance of being skeptical of it, and also the public health community's work.
Again, this is something that goes -- that really pertains to the entire class period and to many decades before the class period, so there was a very deep skepticism towards advertising in general, and
cigarette advertising in particular.
Q. Okay. And have you formed any opinions in this case on the question --on what effect, if any, cigarette advertising may have had on awareness in the State of California by the public about the dangers of cigarette smoking?
A. Yes, I have formed an opinion about that.
Q. And could you state that opinion for the record, please?
A. Yes. It's my historical conclusion that advertising in no way affected the knowledge of cigarettes' hazardous character, and that in fact people retained a very, very high level of awareness about addiction and about health risks regardless of the advertising.
MR. KOETHE: That's all I have.
MS. KARAVATOS: I, unfortunately, have a couple of follow-ups that I have to -THE WITNESS: No.
FURTHER EXAMINATION
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. I believe you had testified earlier that advertising was one component of what people are exposed to that affects their general knowledge or
consciousness in a culture; is that accurate?
A. As a part of a general culture, yes.
Q. But you've done a specific study regarding cigarette advertising and have concluded that the advertising has not had an effect on the consciousness with regard to cigarette smoking; is that accurate?
MR. KOETHE: I object to the form of the question.
I	think it's vague. I'm not sure it accurately reflects what she said, but -THE WITNESS: Well, I could sort of simply restate what I said which is I believe that cigarette advertising has in no way impaired the high level of public awareness of the hazards of cigarette smoking. BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. And what advertisements have you reviewed in order to reach that conclusion?
A. I've reviewed the advertisements that have appeared in magazines and newspapers, and I have also looked some at the history of advertising.
Q. Are all the advertisements that you've reviewed in order to reach that conclusion listed in your list of documents in Exhibit 3196?
A. No. As I mentioned before, I've looked at many more things than are simply on that list.
Q. Are any of those documents in this list on
Exhibit 3196?
A. I don't think that there are specific advertisements like, you know, people in a boat on a spring day kind of thing. But there are certainly articles and books in which the same topic is discussed, and those are on the list.
Q. So is itr accurate to say that you have relied on the articles and books concerning cigarette advertising that are on your list in Exhibit 3196 in order to conclude -- to reach your conclusions regarding advertising in this case?
A. Those books are one facet of what I've relied upon. I have also relied upon my own historical knowledge of a more general character, for example, the fact that there are apparently 20,000 commercials that children are exposed to every year on television, and none of those are about tobacco, so that's the kind of more general knowledge that I've also used. And that comes from newspaper articles and magazines, as well as from scholarly publications.
Q. Can you recall for me the books that you've read regarding cigarette advertising?
A. I can point to a couple that, for example, are on that list. There's one by Michael Schudson, S-c-h-u-d-s-o-n, called the "Uneasy Persuasion."
There's an article from the 1920s. I think it's on the list. It also talks about that from Printers, Inc.
And there's another more recent book. That author's title -- actually the editor's last name is Rabin, R-a-b-i-n. That also contains pertinent information in it. One of the pertinent items is a chapter in fact by Michael Schudson.
Q. Any other books that you can recall?
A. I'm sure there are others, but I'm just not recalling them off the top of my head.
Q. And is it fair to say that the advertisements that are included in the books and articles on your list of relevant materials are the advertisements that you've evaluated in order to reach your conclusion regarding the advertising issues that you've described?
MS. TYLER: Objection. Vague and ambiguous.
THE WITNESS: As I understand it, you're asking if the advertisements that are reprinted in the books are the only ones I'm talking about. That would not be true because in looking at newspapers and magazines, I've seen many more ads than simply the ones that are referenced in those books.
BY MS. KARAVATOS:
Q. Okay.
A. But I didn't think it was necessary to collect
.	them all.
!	Q. Okay. And those ads aren't listed on your
\	list of documents in Exhibit 3196; correct?
I	A. That's correct. That's largely true.
>	Q. And in doing your evaluation or analysis of
>	the advertising by the defendants, did you search for *	advertisements that were published during a certain
i	time frame, or was your analysis more historically
)	comprehensive than that?
)	A. Let me say by the phrase you used,
L	"advertising analysis" is a little different than how ]
I	think of my work because to me that would imply
i	somebody whose focus is simply advertising, who perhaps
I	is an expert on advertising and would, therefore, know
>	that field in more depth than I certainly do. What I't 5	looking at, really, is the historical context of
1	advertising, and so advertisements are in there, and 3	they, of course, tend to repeat, which is one reason
?	not to collect them all, because they tend to be fairly
)	similar to one another, especially within a particular
L	time period.
2	But I certainly looked at the historical context o:
3	advertising in the entire period that we are speaking 1	of today, 1900 to 2001.
5	Q. I may be a little bit confused, and I
apologize to keep on this issue. But when you say you looked at the historical context of advertising in the entire period 1900 to 2001, are you including in that review of specific advertisements and ad campaigns by the defendants?
A. Specific advertisements would be a part of it, but, for example, what I'm speaking of is a more general historical study in a way. To give you an example of that, one of the things I think is important and relevant is how Americans generally look upon advertising. And there has been a controversy historically about advertising for a long time. Advertising really got its start here in the United States, and so Americans are fairly sophisticated about and skeptical about advertising. And so tobacco advertising is a component of that.
I think the public is generally very warned about source credibility when it comes to advertising. And so that would be the broad string, that I as a historian is telling, not a kind of detailed analysis of a particular ad campaign that an advertising expert might do. I hope that's clear.
Q. That's okay. And you've already testified that the specific advertisements that you have viewed or analyzed are not listed specifically in your
reliance materials. However, some of them may be included in some of the books and articles that are listed on your reliance materials; is that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Are there any other advertisements that you would identify that come to mind -- that you would identify as having analyzed in connection with developing your conclusion that advertisements by the tobacco companies had no effect on the state of general knowledge of the people of California regarding the hazards of smoking?
A. I can't think of any specific ads at this moment.
Q. Okay.
MS. KARAVATOS: I have nothing further. I believe we have a standard stipulation in this case.
MR. WRIGHT: Before we get to that, can we go off the record for a minute?
VIDEOGRAPHER: We're off the record. The time is 1:30 P.M.
(Discussion off the record.)
VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the record. The time is 1:34 P.M.
MR. KOETHE: Defendants have nothing further.
MS. KARAVATOS: I believe we have concluded our
questioning for this witness today. And we have a standard stipulation. I'll just recite that the court reporter is relieved of her duties under the California Code of Civil Procedure; that the copy of the transcript will be -- the original transcript will be sent to the witness to review, correct and sign under penalty of perjury within 30 days of receipt thereof.
Counsel for Philip Morris will give notice of any changes or corrections to the transcript. And the original transcript will be returned to -- return it to your office?
MS. REPORTER: I'll have to check.
MR. KOETHE: The appropriate person.
MS. TYLER: The appropriate person for Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds. I'm not sure which one it will be.
MS. BARONI: I have one further thing. Counsel for Lori Hard Tobacco Company does not have any confidentiality designations to make on this particular deposition.
MS. KARAVATOS: Okay. The office of Dougherty, Hildre & Haklar will retain the original transcript and make it available upon reasonable notice by any counsel and at the time of trial in this matter. I believe that's all.
MR. KOETHE: Thank you, Lisa.
Thank you, Karen.
MS. KARAVATOS: Thank you.
