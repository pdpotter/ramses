3	EXAMINATION
4	BY MS. BRYAN:
5	Q. Good morning, Dr. Martin. My name is Leslie
6	Bryan. I'm an attorney with a law firm in Atlanta
7	called Doffermyre, Shields, Canfield & Knowles. I and
8	my law firm represents the plaintiff in this case.
9	You've obviously had your deposition taken before so
10	really the only thing that I want to say to you is
11	particularly because we're doing this by video
12	conference, I think we need to be particularly careful
13	for the benefit of the court reporter not to try and
14	talk over each other, and I'm guilty of that all the
15	time. So I'll make a commitment to you that I will
16	try hard to make sure that we get a clean record.
17	A. And I will do the same to you. I'll try to
18	hesitate for a second or two before I respond. I
19	understand that we -- we have a little bit of a delay
20	issue here.
21	Q. Okay. And obviously any time that you'd like
22	to take a break, please feel free just to let us know,
23	and we'll be happy to take a break.
24	A. Fine. Thank you.
25	Q. Would you go ahead, please, and state your
0005
1	name and business address?
2	A. Yes. My full name is James Kirby Martin, and
3	my business address in Houston is the University of
4	Houston, department of History.
5	Q. Do you have any other business address or
6	just the University of Houston?
7	A. Yes. I have -- well, obviously my home
8	address, and I also have a small office on the west
9	side of Houston, which is at 955 Dairy Ashford.
10	Q. Would you spell that, please?
11	A. Yes. Dairy is just like dairy, D-A-I-R-Y.
12	Ashford is a separate word. A-S-H-F-O-R-D.
13	Q. And what business do you transact in that
14	office?
15	A. Well, it primarily is a place for me to work
16	on various historical-related projects when I'm not at
17	the University of Houston on campus. I also store
18	many of the documents that I've collected over the
19	years in doing tobacco-related research.
20	Q. So do you do any work other than tobacco work
21	in that office?
22	A. Yes, I do.
23	Q. How large is the office?
24	A. I -- I'm going to have to guess at that. I'd
25	say about 700 to 750 square feet.
0006
1	Q. Is it an office that you use primarily for
2	expert witness work or do you also use it for academic
3	work?
4	A. I -- yes. I use it for academic work, as
5	well. I have various book projects, and I also work
6	on movie projects and pretty much when I really want
7	to get things done, that's where I go to have time to
8	concentrate on my various projects.
9	Q. Nobody knocking on your door?
10	A. Very rarely.
11	Q. You go there--okay. Good. Yesterday, Ms.
12	Lawson provided me with an updated CV. Do you have a
13	copy of your CV in front of you?
14	A. No, I don't, but I think we can come up with
15	one fairly quickly.
16	MS. LAWSON: I have it right here,
17	Leslie.
18	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) All right.
19	A. Got it.
20	MS. BRYAN: Could you go ahead and mark
21	that, please, as Exhibit 1.
22	(Exhibit No. 1 was marked.)
23	A. We're set.
24	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Doctor, you have in front of
25	you a copy of your CV. Is that the most current CV?
0007
1	A. Yes, it is.
2	Q. And just from scanning through it, it
3	appeared to me that the most recent publication listed
4	is and online publication from Archer this year
5	entitled, "No Way Out Lord Comwallace, the Siege of
6	Yorktown and America's Victory in the War for
7	Independence."
8	A. Yes. That's my most recent publication, yes.
9	Q. All right. Is there anything significantly
10	different in this publication from any prior one that
11	we've seen other than updating your publications?
12	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
13	A. No, I -
14	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) No new academic positions or
15	things like that?
16	A. I'm sorry. I don't understand the question,
17	ma'am.
18	Q. I'm sorry. It was a bad question. Let me
19	try again.
20	Is there anything significantly different in
21	this version of your resume than in other
22	relatively-recent versions of your resume?
23	A. No, there's not. Just -- just a few updates.
24	That would -- that would be all.
25	Q. Doctor, you are clearly an expert on the
0008
1	American Revolution. Tell me how you developed your
2	interest in that area?
3	A. Well, I went to graduate school at the
4	University of Wisconsin, and I had -- my two major
5	fields were early American history and 20th century
6	American history and I decided to write my doctoral
7	dissertation on a subject dealing with the American
8	Revolution.
9	Q. When you were doing your doctoral work, did
10	you run across John Quincy Adams' letter to Reverend
11	Cox from August of 1845?
12	A. I ran across that letter when I was working
13	on a book called, "Drinking In America," which was
14	published back in the 1980s.
15	Q. When you publish an article in a scholarly
16	journal, you don't get paid for that, do you?
17	A. Well, it depends. In a scholarly journal,
18	the answer would be no.
19	Q. What's the leading journal in your field?
20	What do you consider to be the leading journal in your
21	field?
22	A. Well, there are a number of them.
23	Probably -- that's very hard to say. Probably the
24	Journal of American History. I throw in the William
25	and Mary Quarterly, and the Journal of the Early
0009
1	American Republic.
2	Q. Do those articles pay authors whose papers
3	they publish?
4	A. In those journals, no.
5	Q. So publishing in academic journals is
6	something that you do as part of your professional
7	development or scholarly work, correct?
8	MS. LAWSON: Object to the form.
9	A. Yes. Generally speaking, yes.
10	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Well, generally you don't
11	publish in academic journals to make money, correct?
12	A. Only in the indirect sense that publishing
13	does affect one's salary at one's university, but
14	that's just an indirect matter.
15	Q. Fair enough. Now, according to your CV,
16	you're currently working on a project entitled,
17	"Smoking in America." Is that correct?
18	A. I've done a lot of research on that subject,
19	yes.
20	Q. What's the status -- do you intend to publish
21	a book like you did with, "Drinking In America"?
22	MS. LAWSON: Object to the form.
23	A. That's a long-term goal, but it's among about
24	four or five projects that I'm actually working on
25	right now.
0010
1	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) What's the status of the,
2	"Smoking In America," project?
3	A. Well, the status is that I'm continuing to do
4	research but I haven't started to write in any
5	significant way on that subject, that is in terms of a
6	book manuscript.
7	Q. Do you have a date when you anticipate
8	starting that?
9	A. No, I don't because I have two other projects
10	that are really focus of my -- are the focus of my
11	attention right now.
12	Q. What are those projects?
13	A. One is a study of the American Revolution, a
14	general history of the American Revolution, and the
15	other is a movie project that focuses on World War II
16	and the Battle of Dresden, and I'm involved in writing
17	the script for that particular project and in
18	developing a book as part of that project.
19	Q. How did you develop your history -- your
20	interest in the battle of Dresden?
21	A. Well, it came out of a trip to Germany two
22	years ago when a tour guide said that the allies had
23	no reason to bomb Dresden and I knew better than that
24	and that's how the project actually started.
25	Q. Okay. So it was a difference in perspective
0011
1	from the tour guide -- tour guide in Germany as
2	compared to what you actually knew about the
3	historical events?
4	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
5	A. Yes. And it roused my curiosity about what
6	the real story was and that's what started this
7	particular project.
8	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Okay. With respect to your
9	Smoking In America project, has anybody indicated to
10	you that you should hold off on that project for now?
11	A. No.
12	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
13	A. No one has at all.
14	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Nobody has asked you to slow
15	it down?
16	A. Not at all.
17	Q. In connection with your Smoking In America
18	project, tell me the kind of research that you've
19	conducted?
20	A. Well, I have conducted extensive research
21	going all the way back to the 17th century and even
22	beyond back to the time of Christopher Columbus, and
23	I've moved forward through the 19th century into the
24	20th century. I've gathered a whole series of
25	documents about what was going on in the 19th century
0012
1	and then, of course, have also gathered a tremendous
2	amount of material on the 20th century part of that
3	story, which is standard procedure.
4	Q. Do you anticipate that, that will result in a
5	book?
6	A. I -- well, yes, I would hope so. Yes, I
7	would.
8	Q. And will the book deal with the history of
9	tobacco use in the United States?
10	A. Yes. That would be one focus of the book.
11	It would be parallel. Just as the drinking book dealt
12	with the history of the use of alcohol in the United
13	States history, the parallel would be to deal with the
14	use of tobacco products in United States history, yes.
15	Q. Will you in the course of conducting your
16	research and writing that book review any of the
17	internal tobacco company documents?
18	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
19	A. Well, I've seen some internal tobacco company
20	documents, yes, but that hasn't been a necessary focal
21	point of my research.
22	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Do you have RJR's expert
23	disclosure in front of you or can you get a copy?
24	MS. LAWSON: I've got it right here,
25	Leslie.
0013
1	MS. BRYAN: Thank you, Christine.
2	MS. LAWSON: I've got the entire
3	disclosure, and I'm just opening it to his particular
4	one.
5	MS. BRYAN: That's fine.
6	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) I believe yours starts on Page
7	56, Doctor?
8	A. Yes, that's correct.
9	MS. LAWSON: Did you want that marked,
10	Leslie?
11	MS. BRYAN: Yes. Would you mark that,
12	please, as Exhibit 2?
13	(Exhibit No. 2 was marked.)
14	A. We're set.
15	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Okay. Do you understand that
16	this section of the disclosure discusses the opinions
17	that you may be offering at the trial of this case?
18	A. Yes, I do.
19	Q. Let's talk first about the subject matter of
20	your testimony. The first sentence says that
21	Dr. Martin -- this is under the summary of facts and
22	opinions. "Dr. Martin is -- I'm sorry. It's under
23	the subject matter and substance section. "Dr. Martin
24	is expected to testify about historical research
25	methodology and the history of tobacco and
0014
1	cigarettes." Is that generally what you expect your
2	testimony will be about?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And it goes on to say that you will also
5	testify about the vast amount of information
6	communicated and available to the public, including
7	James Sikes. Do you see that?
8	A. Yes, I do.
9	Q. And specifically, the information that was
10	available concerning the health risks of smoking
11	cigarettes and the widespread awareness that smoking
12	can be habit forming, addictive or very difficult to
13	quit. Again, is that generally what you expect your
14	testimony will be?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. Yesterday, Ms. Lawson provided me with an
17	analysis that you had done for the Pensacola
18	newspapers.
19	MS. BRYAN: Could we mark that as
20	Exhibit 3, please, Christine.
21	MS. LAWSON: Yes, ma'am. Let me get it
22	out here.
23	THE WITNESS: Do you want it marked?
24	MS. LAWSON: Yes, she's marking it.
25	MS. BRYAN: Yes, please.
0015
1	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry.
2	(Exhibit No. 3 was marked.)
3	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Will you identify that for me,
4	please?
5	A. Yes. This is an analyses of articles that
6	appeared in the Pensacola News in January 1964
7	touching upon the health risks associated with
8	smoking, mostly in light of the Surgeon General's
9	report that appeared in January. I believe the actual
10	date was January 11th of 1964.
11	Q. And does it include other months, as well?
12	A. No. It includes -- this -- this particular
13	document I'm looking at is just January of 1964.
14	Q. The document that I received yesterday was a
15	multi-page document. How many pages are in the
16	document that you have?
17	A. If I counted correctly, ten.
18	Q. The document that I received yesterday was 14
19	pages and also addressed February and March of 1964.
20	Advertising.
21	A. Yes. It's 14. I'm sorry. I must have mixed
22	it up here with the other document I have in front of
23	me.
24	Q. All right.
25	A. I have 14.
0016
1	Q. And does it include information on months
2	other than January of 1964?
3	A. Yes, it does.
4	Q. All right. Did you perform the work that
5	ended up resulting in this document?
6	A. Yes, I did.
7	Q. And when did you start doing the work?
8	A. This -- this particular work I would say
9	would have been within the last month. Yes, within
10	the last month.
11	Q. And why did you do it?
12	A. Because I wanted to know what kind of press
13	coverage there was in the Pensacola news with respect
14	to the health risks associated with smoking, those
15	stories at the time of the Surgeon General's report,
16	which, generally speaking, I've found out over the
17	years in doing such analyses is an absolutely huge
18	story with dozens and dozens of stories appearing all
19	over the country and in this case confirmed these
20	stories were appearing in the Pensacola news in
21	January, '64.
22	Q. Who asked you to do this work?
23	A. I asked myself to do this work. It's part of
24	my ongoing research.
25	Q. Did you do it particularly for this case?
0017
1	A. No. Actually, I didn't do it particularly
2	for this case.
3	Q. Did you do it for another case?
4	A. Well, I've done several of these as cases
5	come up in different parts of the country just to see
6	what the pattern is, so I was particularly interested
7	in what the pattern might be in the area of western
8	Florida as compared to other parts of the country. So
9	it's part of my ongoing research.
10	Q. And how does the pattern in western Florida
11	compare to other parts of the country?
12	A. It's very similar.
13	Q. Now, the time that you selected here was the
14	publication of the first Surgeon General report; is
15	that correct?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. Have you done a similar analysis for any
18	other point in time?
19	A. Well, yes. I've looked over the years at
20	probably more than 100 newspapers, and I've done
21	similar analyses for -- not in this detail, but other
22	stories that have cropped up over the years over and
23	over again about the health risks of smoking going
24	back from the 1950s into the 1980s.
25	Q. For example, are you aware that the 1988
0018
1	Surgeon General report dealt with addiction?
2	A. Yes, I am.
3	Q. All right. Have you analyzed the articles
4	that appeared in newspapers in any given location
5	around that -- the issuance of that Surgeon General
6	report?
7	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
8	A. I believe you're referring to C. Everett
9	Koop's report on addiction in 1988?
10	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Yes, sir.
11	A. I want to make sure that's the one you're
12	referring to.
13	Q. Yes, sir.
14	A. Yes. There was some press coverage of
15	that -- of that particular story.
16	Q. And have you done an analysis of that press
17	coverage that is like the analysis you've conducted in
18	Exhibit 3?
19	A. There wasn't --1 can tell you there was not
20	as much press coverage in the '88 report as compared
21	to the 1964 report, because my 1988, there certainly
22	was no news in the -- at least the newspapers assumed
23	there was no news in the story that cigarette smoking
24	was addictive. It was hardly -- hardly anything new
25	about that.
0019
1	Q. I appreciate your answer, but that's not what
2	I asked. My question was: Have you performed an
3	analysis of newspaper articles that appeared in 1988
4	that is similar to the analysis that you prepared for
5	Exhibit 3?
6	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
7	A. Well, the analysis is there aren't many
8	stories in 1988. That's all I can tell you about
9	that. So it makes it very difficult to do a
10	comparative analysis.
11	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) So the answer is no, you
12	haven't?
13	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
14	A. Well, if you want to say no, you can; but
15	there's no way to do a similar analysis because it's
16	not a comparable situation.
17	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) All right: you say in 1988, it
18	wasn't a story because everybody knew that it was
19	addictive. Is that what you just said?
20	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
21	A. That's what I just said, yes.
22	Q. Okay. If everybody knew it was addictive,
23	why did the tobacco executives, six years later, deny
24	that it was addictive?
25	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
0020
1	A. Well, I am familiar with that. I watched
2	some of that on television at the time, and it's very
3	difficult for me to answer that particular question
4	for you, but my impression was they were responding to
5	the notion that Dr. Koop had compared the difficulties
6	of quitting smoking to, let's say, getting off of
7	various kinds of hard drugs such as heroin, that sort
8	of thing. That's what they were objecting to.
9	Q. You've reviewed the video of the appearance
10	before the Congressional committee?
11	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
12	A. Yes. And I also watched some of it when it
13	was on TV.
14	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And had you been retained by
15	the tobacco company, by R. J. Reynolds at the time of
16	the testimony before the Congressional committee?
17	A. I don't believe so. You'll have to give me
18	the exact date. I think the testimony was in the
19	spring, and the first time I did anything was in the
20	summer so the time frame would be fairly close, but I
21	don't think it overlapped. I really would have to go
22	back and check.
23	Q. Okay. I appreciate that. The question that
24	they were asked was whether cigarettes were addictive,
25	wasn't it?
0021
1	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
2	A. Yes. That's what Congressman Waxman asked
3	them, yes.
4	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Congressman Waxman did not ask
5	is it addictive -- do you disagree that it's as
6	addictive as heroin; he just asked is it addictive,
7	correct?
8	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
9	A. I believe that's what he asked, yes.
10	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And universally the tobacco
11	executives said they do not believe the cigarettes
12	were addictive, correct?
13	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
14	A. Well, I've given you what I think is the
15	context of that statement, but, yes, that's what they
16	said.
17	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Look back at Exhibit 2, your
18	disclosure statement in this case, did you have any
19	role in preparing that?
20	A. Yes, I did.
21	Q. And what was your role?
22	A. Well, I've written various reports over the
23	years, and some of this comes from reports that were
24	done in other situations, federal cases, and I
25	reviewed this with the attorneys, a draft of it, and
0022
1	we agreed on the content and at that point, it was
2	finalized.
3	Q. Which attorneys did you review it with?
4	A. Attorney by the name of Paul Koethe.
5	Q. And he's a lawyer at Jones Day?
6	A. Yes, he is.
7	Q. Is he the person that you deal with
8	primarily?
9	A. Yes. I would say primarily, yes.
10	Q. You get your assignments from him; you send
11	your bills to him?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Now, the disclosure doesn't mention the
14	analysis that we see in Exhibit 3, does it?
15	A. Well, it mentions newspapers, but I don't
16	know whether it has the Pensacola paper in there.
17	I'll have to go look. It was supposed to be there.
18	Q. Well, there are some references to the
19	Pensacola papers in your reliance materials, but I
20	didn't see anything in the disclosure statement on the
21	Pensacola paper.
22	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
23	A. Well, it says -- I'm just turning to Page 57.
24	It says that I've done research in various sources
25	here, including the Pensacola News Journal. It's on
0023
1	the bottom line of Page 57 in the copy I have.
2	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Yes. I agree with you that
3	it says that, but it doesn't say -- there's no mention
4	of that kind of analysis, is there?
5	MS. LAWSON: Object to form and Leslie
6	can I ask if you'd repeat that? You were breaking up
7	as that question was coming through. If we can either
8	have the court reporter repeat it or you repeat it.
9	MS. BRYAN: I'll repeat it.
10	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) The analysis that you
11	performed of the Pensacola newspaper in 1964 is not
12	mentioned in your disclosure, is it?
13	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
14	A. Well, it's -- no, that specific -- that
15	specific item is not mentioned, but the newspaper that
16	I'm working in that newspaper is mentioned.
17	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Okay. So I'm just trying to
18	find out how this analysis of the Pensacola paper --
19	and I guess I should ask: Which Pensacola paper is
20	this? Is it the Pensacola News --
21	A. Yes, ma'am.
22	Q. - only?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. There are other newspapers in Pensacola, are
25	there not?
0024
1	A. I believe there are. There was another paper
2	at that time, yes, but I did not --
3	Q. Why did you choose --
4	A. Why did --
5	Q. Go ahead.
6	A. Why did I choose this particular paper?
7	Because we were able to get it on interlibrary loan.
8	When I say "we," that's a royal we. I mean I. I was
9	able to get it on interlibrary loan.
10	Q. Do you know how many newspapers there were in
11	Pensacola in 19 -- in January, 1964?
12	A. I believe there were two.
13	Q. Do you know the name of the other paper?
14	A. It's not coming to my -- it's not coming to
15	me at this point. No, I don't. Not at this
16	particular moment. I -- but I'm sure it's the second
17	paper.
18	Q. And was the Pensacola News a daily paper?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Was it the morning paper or the afternoon
21	paper, if you know?
22	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
23	A. I believe it was the morning paper, but I'm
24	not positive. I didn't spend time looking into that.
25	Q. Do you know what the circulation was of the
0025
1	Pensacola News?
2	A. I don't know whether I've acquired those
3	figures yet or not, but I can very easily. They're in
4	the Ayers guides.
5	Q. How much will the Ayers guides break down the
6	circulation numbers? Will it just give you a lump sum
7	or will it break it down by areas of Pensacola?
8	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
9	A. It's A-Y-E-R-S. I probably didn't sound it
10	out correctly for you. It would break it down in
11	one -- actually, two figures. One would be the
12	weekday number, and the second would be the Sunday
13	number. Usually the Sunday number is a little bit
14	larger than the weekday number, but no, it would not
15	break it down by areas of the community. It's just an
16	overall number.
17	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) All right. I'd just like to
18	ask you some questions about Exhibit 3 so I understand
19	what you've done here.
20	A. Okay.
21	Q. You reviewed the Pensacola News for the
22	entire month of January, 1964, correct?
23	A. Yes. That's correct.
24	Q. Every copy?
25	A. Yes.
0026
I	Q. Meaning every day's --
2	A. Every day's, four articles, yes.
3	Q. All right. And you found 60 articles about
4	cigarettes?
5	A. About --
6	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
7	A. -- cigarettes as they relate to health
8	issues.
9	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) So an average of two a day?
10	A. That's right, yes. About that.
II	Q. And based on your research, it's your view
12	that not one of those articles quoted an industry
13	person?
14	A. That's correct.
15	Q. Did that seem odd to you?
16	A. Not really because in doing this research
17	with several different newspapers across the country,
18	there are actually very, very few industry comments
19	that appear in that particular month.
20	Q. If you would look over at Page -- at least in
21	my copy is Page 6. It says, "Pensacola News Summary
22	of Advertising Data."
23	A. Yes. Just a second. I've got -- wait a
24	minute. There, I've got it. Yes.
25	Q. Okay. Looking at the January, '64, data, it
0027
1	says, "Day's sampled were." Explain that to me,
2	please.
3	A. Well, to go through literally every day and
4	to count every advertisement -- and we're not counting
5	personals and all that sort of thing. We're talking
6	about real advertisements. We -- to do that would be
7	prohibitively expensive, if I can put it that way, so
8	what we do is we have a sampling method where we take
9	representative days, and then we will go through those
10	representative days, and by the formula that's
11	described here, we will come up with a ballpark figure
12	of the number of overall advertisements. So that's
13	step one.
14	The second step then is to go through
15	literally every issue, every day and look for every
16	cigarette advertisement that appears. So that is not
17	done selectively, that is done comprehensively, and
18	that's how we come up with these numbers.
19	Q. Did you have any assistance with this
20	project?
21	A. Yes. I have a research assistant that helps
22	me with this.
23	Q. And who is your research assistant?
24	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
25	A. He is a graduate student at the University of
0028
1	Houston.
2	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And what's his name?
3	MS. LAWSON: Leslie, I'm going to object
4	to Dr. Martin giving you the -- the gentleman's name
5	just because of problems that have arisen with
6	graduate students being identified in historian's
7	depositions, and -- but feel free to ask about his
8	qualifications, just anything other than his name.
9	MS. BRYAN: All right. I will do that,
10	and I would also agree to a protective order for his
11	name.
12	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Doctor, tell me about this
13	graduate student's qualifications?
14	A. He is currently an ABD student. That means
15	that he's passed his PhD qualifying examinations, and
16	he is beginning research on his doctoral dissertation.
17	Q. Do you know the topic of his doctoral
18	dissertation?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. What is it?
21	A. It's a study of a man by the name of James
22	Thompson Calendar who has often been described as the
23	first yellow journalist in American history.
24	Q. That actually sounds fairly interesting.
25	A. Actually, it is very interesting.
0029
1	Q. How much time has your graduate student spent
2	working with you on tobacco-related projects?
3	A. That's a good question. He actually helps me
4	a great deal because of limitations in my own
5	schedule. It's really hard for me to say how many
6	hour -- something like hours a month something, would
7	that help you?
8	Q. Yes. That would be fine.
9	A. Okay. Let me try to just go through this in
10	my mind. Maybe 50 to 60 hours on a monthly basis,
11	something along that particular line.
12	Q. So 15 hours or so a week?
13	A. Yes. I would say that's about right.
14	Q. Okay. And how long has he been working with
15	you?
16	A. Kelsey started working with me --1 hope I'm
17	telling you the right year, but I believe it was the
18	summer of 2009, so he's been -- he and I have been
19	working together for three years.
20	Q. Okay. Before he began working with you, did
21	you have another research assistant who worked with
22	you?
23	A. Yes, I did.
24	Q. And was that a man or a woman?
25	A. It was a man.
0030
1	Q. And how long did he work with you?
2	A. For approximately a year.
3	Q. Do you pay your research assistants directly?
4	A. No. I send in their statements to Mr. Koethe
5	on a monthly basis.
6	Q. What is your current research assistant's
7	billing rate?
8	A. The current student, the billing rate just
9	went up from 30 to $35 a month. I'm sorry. I
10	misstated. From 30 to $35 an hour.
11	Q. Do you know how much time he has billed
12	that's attributable to the Sikes case?
13	A. I could only give you a ballpark on that.
14	I --1 can --
15	Q. And what would that be?
16	A. I would guess -- and I don't like to guess,
17	but I'm going to estimate 40 to 50 hours.
18	Q. And that's time that does not appear on your
19	bills, correct?
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. Looking back again at your disclosure
22	statement, it says at Page 58 that you have testified
23	exclusively for defendants?
24	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
25	A. Yes. That's correct.
0031
1	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And there it lists -- other
2	than testifying in tobacco litigation, have you
3	testified in any other litigation?
4	A. No, I have not.
5	Q. The disclosure lists four cases in which you
6	have testified, Reese, Oleeva, Alonzo, and Vasco. Of
7	those four, which case is the most recent, if you
8	know?
9	A. I believe it's Reese.
10	Q. Have you testified in any other tobacco cases
11	in the past year?
12	A. No.
13	Q. The disclosure also indicates that you have
14	spent about 10 to 15 percent of your professional time
15	working as an expert witness. Is that still correct?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. And so that's entirely related to tobacco,
18	correct?
19	A. In terms of -- yes, that's correct.
20	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
21	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And I believe that according
22	to this statement, you've billed $250 an hour; is that
23	right?
24	A. Yes. Except this month, it went up.
25	Q. To what?
0032
1	A. 275.
2	Q. And by "this month," you mean August the 1st?
3	A. Yeah. Actually, beginning July 1st.
4	Beginning July 1st.
5	Q. Okay.
6	A. I keep forgetting we're in August.
7	Q. And -- excuse me. In terms of your billing,
8	you don't differentiate between work that you do just
9	sitting in your office and testifying, do you?
10	A. No, I do not.
11	Q. Recognizing that you spend about 10 to 15
12	percent of your time working as an expert witness,
13	what percentage of your current income comes from
14	working as an expert witness?
15	A. Well, that's going to vary month to month,
16	year to year, whatever, but I'd say 15 to 20 percent,
17	something like that.
18	Q. So a little bit more -- a little bit greater
19	percentage of your income than time, correct?
20	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
21	A. Something like that. I --1 mean, I don't
22	keep accurate records of that sort of thing. I don't
23	worry about it.
24	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) I appreciate that. I'd like
25	to turn for a moment to what you know about James
0033
1	Sikes. Yesterday, Ms. Lawson provided me with some
2	notes that you had jotted down pertaining to
3	Mr. Sikes.
4	MS. BRYAN: Could we mark that as
5	Exhibit 4?
6	MS. LAWSON: I've got them right here.
7	MS. BRYAN: Thank you.
8	(Exhibit No. 4 was marked.)
9	A. I have the documents in front of me.
10	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) All right. Thank you. When
11	was James Sikes bom?
12	A. March of 1948.
13	Q. Where was his family living when he was bom?
14	A. They were in the Mobile, Alabama area, if I
15	recall correctly.
16	Q. Well, before we get into that, in order to --
17	first of all, when did you prepare these notes?
18	A. I prepared these notes as I read through the
19	depositions that had been taken in this case.
20	Q. What depositions did you review?
21	A. Well, I believe there were 12, but three of
22	them involved one person, Mr. Sikes's wife so there
23	would have been ten individuals represented in those
24	12 depositions if I -- if I recall correctly.
25	Q. Can you tell me which depositions you
0034
1	reviewed?
2	A. Yes. I reviewed all of them.
3	Q. Can you give me the names of -- can you give
4	me the names?
5	A. Of all 12 people or 10 people?
6	Q. Yes, sir.
7	A. Well, okay. There were two daughters,
8	Jennifer and Laura Sikes. There was a brother, whose
9	name is Fletcher Sikes. There is Mr. Sikes's second
10	wife, Janice Sikes. There was Mr. Sikes's first wife,
11	and I believe her --1 don't want to guess at her
12	name. I don't recall it.
13	Q. Would that have been --
14	A. There were friends and associates, a sailor
15	friend by the name of James Meadow. There was a
16	businessman who managed the ships. There was the
17	owner of the La Cmise, and -- and I'm trying to think
18	if there was any one else at this point. I don't have
19	that list in front of me.
20	Q. When did you --
21	A. There was a daughter. Yes, there's one other
22	one that I remember. There was a deposition with
23	Fletcher Sikes's daughter. I don't remember her --of
24	course, her last name as I recall is Sikes, but I
25	don't remember her first name. I don't recall at this
0035
1	point. And then, I'm sorry, there's one more. Carla
2	Slicker. A woman by the name of Carla Slicker.
3	Q. Okay. When did you prepare the notes that we
4	have marked as Exhibit 4?
5	A. Probably over a two to three-month period as
6	I read through depositions.
7	Q. When was the last time you added any of these
8	notes?
9	A. I would say probably within the past month
10	but certainly not within the last couple of weeks.
11	Q. When did you provide a copy of these to any
12	lawyer representing Reynolds?
13	A. I brought them yesterday, according to what I
14	was asked to bring with me when we met yesterday.
15	Q. Now, in your notes you list --1 think it's
16	on the second page -- various places where Mr. Sikes
17	lived?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. Where did you get the information on where
20	Mr. Sikes lived?
21	A. Well, this was derived from --1 believe this
22	particular sheet from the interrogatories that I
23	received, and as you can see because there's a
24	question mark, I'm not completely sure about this. I
25	was guessing based on the information that wasn't
0036
1	completely clear in the interrogatories and, actually,
2	there was some modification of that second page based
3	on information that appeared in the depositions.
4	Q. Okay. So you reviewed interrogatory
5	responses. You reviewed 12 volumes of depositions.
6	Are there any other materials that you reviewed
7	particularly to Mr. Sikes?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. What else?
10	A. I reviewed materials that had been -- had
11	been obtained about his education, and that is I'm
12	talking about primary and secondary education. I also
13	reviewed military records that related to his career
14	in the Navy and also in the Florida and Alabama
15	National Guards.
16	Q. Anything else?
17	A. I think there was -- yes, there was one other
18	item related to education. There was a query as to
19	whether he had attended college at the University of
20	California at Riverside.
21	Q. And what did you review in connection with
22	that issue?
23	A. A statement by the University of California
24	at Riverside that they had no record that he had
25	attended school there.
0037
1	Q. Did you review anything else?
2	A. I'm not recalling anything besides the
3	materials --
4	Q. For example --
5	A. Go ahead.
6	Q. Did you review the complaint in the case?
7	A. Yes. There was one complaint. I believe it
8	was the second amended complaint.
9	Q. Okay. So you reviewed the complaint. You
10	reviewed interrogatory responses. You reviewed 12
11	volumes of depositions. You reviewed educational
12	records and military records. Anything else?
13	A. Not that I'm recalling.
14	Q. Is there anything that was in the complaint
15	that you think is important to the opinions you're
16	going to offer in this case?
17	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
18	A. I'm not sure how to answer that question.
19	The complaint deals with legal issues that I don't
20	necessarily feel qualified to respond to.
21	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Why did you review it?
22	A. Well, for one thing, quite often it's the
23	first item which gives me a sense of when the
24	individual involved in the litigation was bom and
25	sometimes where they live and who might be filing the
0038
1	case should that person be deceased. So it's just
2	basic information like that, that I would be looking
3	for.
4	Q. Now, looking at this list that you've
5	compiled of places where Mr. Sikes lived, would you
6	agree with me that he was about seven when his family
7	moved to Freeburg, Illinois?
8	A. Just a second. I'm not sure whether he was
9	seven, but let's say he was close to seven. I'm just
10	going to the education records because that was --1
11	would say some time in the mid '50s. That's -- that's
12	my best guess on that. '55, '56, '57, based on the
13	education records.
14	Q. So he's under ten?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. School age but under ten?
17	A. Yes. That's correct.
18	Q. Okay. And would that have been about the
19	time when he was learning to read?
20	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
21	A. I would assume so, even though I'm not trying
22	to assume that sort of thing, but generally speaking,
23	reading begins to be taught in the first and second
24	grade, third grade.
25	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) What kind of area was
0039
1	Freeburg, Illinois in 19 -- in the mid 1950s?
2	A. I would say because I've been in that area,
3	but it was not in the 1950s. It was somewhat rural,
4	but it was still within the extended urban district of
5	St. Louis, Missouri.
6	Q. He lived on a farm, though, didn't he?
7	A. Yes. I believe they did.
8	Q. So that's probably pretty rural?
9	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
10	A. Well, it still is -- yes, rural to urban, I
11	would say.
12	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Well, I don't want to get into
13	an argument about semantics, but you usually find
14	farms in rural areas, not urban areas, correct?
15	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
16	A. I grew up on a farm, and it was in a virtual
17	urban area, so I can envision that possibility.
18	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Where did you grow up?
19	A. Between Akron and Cleveland, Ohio.
20	Q. Were you surrounded by tall buildings or open
21	fields?
22	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
23	A. Probably mostly open fields when I was
24	growing up.
25	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) What year were you bom,
0040
1	Doctor?
2	A. 1943.
3	Q. Do you know whether there were any newspapers
4	in the home in Freeburg when Mr. Sikes was growing up?
5	A. I don't know whether there were any
6	newspapers. I know that one of the depositions said
7	that Mr. Sikes's father read newspapers.
8	Q. Did you also see testimony in one of the
9	depositions that Mr. Sikes's father was cheap and
10	didn't read newspapers?
11	MS. LAWSON: Object to fomi.
12	A. I believe that was in reference to magazines,
13	not newspapers, but I'd have to go back and check
14	that.
15	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) So going back to my question:
16	Do you know what newspapers were in the home in
17	Freeburg, if any?
18	A. Not specifically, no. I know what newspapers
19	are in the area, but I can't say what newspapers may
20	have been in a particular home.
21	Q. What newspapers were circulated in Freeburg
22	in the mid 1950s?
23	A. Well, that's part of the general area of the
24	St. Louis Post dispatch. There's also some -- there's
25	some local papers in that general area like the
0041
1	Edwardsville and Intelligencer. There may be a few to
2	the south, but they would probably be too far south
3	for that particular area, so I would say the main
4	newspaper in that area would be the St. Louis Post
5	Dispatch.
6	Q. And that would have been in the mid 1950s?
7	A. Yes, ma'am.
8	Q. Do you know what magazines, if any, were in
9	the home in Freeburg?
10	A. No, I don't.
11	Q. How long did Mr. Sikes' family stay in
12	Freeburg?
13	A. I believe--I'd have to look here, but I
14	think they moved from Freeburg to Detroit. There's
15	some conflict in the information, but it was -- I'm
16	going to say that if I look at the school records, he
17	started in school in the Detroit area in '63, so I
18	would have to say that, that would be around the time,
19	'62 to'63. 1962 to 1963.
20	Q. Turning to the first page of your notes, you
21	have a section on schooling?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. Tell me where Mr. Sikes went to elementary
24	school.
25	A. He went to elementary school in Freeburg,
0042
1	Illinois. That's the record that I've seen.
2	Q. Have you seen any other records about
3	elementary school?
4	A. No. I haven't seen any other records. It's
5	possible he may have been in a school in Alabama
6	before moving to Freeburg, but I did not see a record
7	about that, that I recall at this time.
8	Q. And what about after school in Freeburg?
9	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
10	A. Well, there's a question as to whether there
11	was a semester in Alabama, but there are no records
12	about that, and after that, he went to junior high
13	school in the Detroit, Michigan area beginning --1
14	have the dates here. I guess that would have begun in
15	1963, approximately 1963.
16	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And what about after junior
17	high in Detroit or in Grosse Point?
18	A. That was the end --
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. That was the -- from what I can tell, that
21	was the end of his schooling. He did not proceed
22	beyond the ninth grade.
23	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) You have a reference here to
24	Hopewell High in Virginia. What's that about?
25	A. I have no idea because that -- in the second
0043
1	page -- and this goes back to what was in an
2	interrogatory. There's something about Hopewell,
3	Virginia, but from his military records, there's no
4	indication that he went to school beyond the schooling
5	in Detroit, and that is in his enlistment papers.
6	They give him credit for eight years of schooling,
7	which would bring him to the ninth grade.
8	Q. And what about this reference to a school in
9	Panama?
10	A. There's no indication that he went to school
11	in Panama, rather his parents signed him up for the
12	military in approximately April of 1965, and that was
13	because he was under age.
14	Q. Do you know what Mr. Sikes's parents'
15	educational background was?
16	A. No, I don't.
17	Q. When Mr. -- in other cases, you have
18	testified about school curricula that addressed health
19	concerns about smoking. Do you intend to do that in
20	this case?
21	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
22	A. Yes. I have been looking at the records that
23	are available from the State of Illinois, which relate
24	to Freeburg, and the State of Michigan that would
25	relate to the Detroit suburbs, and my expectation
0044
1	would be yes, I would be presenting information about
2	what state requirements were with respect to teaching
3	about the health effects and the difficulties in
4	quitting smoking.
5	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Do you know how long Mr. Sikes
6	remained in Panama?
7	A. Actually, I think for Mr. Sikes it was a
8	fairly brief period in time because my -- my
9	understanding is that the family moved there in 1965.
10	He enlisted -- actually, joined or actually started
11	his active service in May of 1965, and I believe his
12	training was not in the Panama area, that is his nine
13	weeks of basic training.
14	Q. Do you know whether there were any newspapers
15	in the family home when he was living in Panama?
16	A. I don't know. I'd have no idea about that.
17	Q. Do you have any idea of what -- what
18	newspapers might possibly have been in the home in
19	Panama?
20	A. No.
21	Q. Do you know whether James Sikes had any
22	fluency in Spanish?
23	A. No, I have no idea.
24	Q. What is your understanding of Mr. Sikes's
25	time in the Navy after he enlisted in 1965?
0045
1	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
2	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) What did he do?
3	A. Well, he went to basic training. He was
4	assigned to a naval vessel, the USS Pickaway, which is
5	a troop transport vessel, and he began his tour with
6	that vessel late summer, early fall of 1965. That
7	transport was operating between San Diego and Vietnam,
8	and that he was in the Vietnam zone approximately give
9	or take a few months -- well, he was in three
10	different years, let me put it that way. That vessel
11	was back in San Diego in 1968, and he mustered out
12	with a two-year commitment to the reserves in January
13	of 1969.
14	Q. Have you researched what newspapers or
15	magazines were available to servicemen on the ship?
16	A. Yes, I have.
17	Q. And tell me about that.
18	A. Well, the standard publication that is
19	available would be the Pacific Stars and Stripes, and
20	that was certainly made readily available in the
21	Pacific theater where some of his service time, he —
22	he would have been in that area. He was in San
23	Diego --
24	Q. Anything else?
25	A. Yeah. When he was in San Diego there was a
0046
1	San Diego newspaper, I believe, that's called the San
2	Diego Union.
3	Q. I'm specifically talking about while he was
4	on the ship at sea.
5	A. Well, that would be the Pacific Stars and
6	Stripes would be the primary publication that was
7	available.
8	Q. Do you have any evidence that James Sikes
9	ever read the Pacific Stars and Stripes?
10	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
11	A. I can't place it in his hands, no. I can say
12	it was there and available.
13	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Do you have any evidence that
14	he ever saw it?
15	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
16	A. Well, I just have to repeat what I just said.
17	It was there and available. Whether he saw it, I
18	don't have any idea at this point.
19	MS. BRYAN: Christine, we've been going
20	for about an hour and 15 minutes. You want to take a
21	quick break?
22	MS. LAWSON: Sounds good.
23	THE WITNESS: Fine.
24	MS. LAWSON: We'll do that.
25	MS. BRYAN: Ten minutes, five minutes?
0047
1	MS. LAWSON: Five minutes is fine if it
2	works for you.
3	MS. BRYAN: Yeah, that's fine.
4	(Break.)
5	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Doctor, looking again at
6	Exhibit 4, your notes about Mr. Sikes, you've noted
7	who his children are and where he went to school and
8	his work history. Are his children important to any
9	of the opinions that you're going to offer in this
10	case?
11	A. No, I don't think so.
12	Q. And what about his work history?
13	A. You broke --
14	MS. LAWSON: Leslie, I apologize. You
15	broke up. Could you repeat that?
16	MS. BRYAN: Yes.
17	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Is his work history
18	significant to the opinions you intend to offer in
19	this case?
20	MS. LAWSON: I'm sorry. You broke up.
21	One more time. I apologize. I'm not sure what's
22	going on.
23	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Is his work history
24	significant to any of the opinions you're going to
25	offer in this case?
0048
1	MS. LAWSON: One more time. The sound
2	went out.
3	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Is his work history --
4	MS. LAWSON: It's freezing.
5	THE WITNESS: We're frozen.
6	MS. LAWSON: It froze, Leslie. We're
7	sending for our technical person.
8	MS. BRYAN: Got it.
9	MS. LAWSON: I apologize. I don't know
10	what's going on. Although, now, it actually looks
11	fine.
12	THE WITNESS: It could be sun. The sun
13	streaks or something like that, which could happen.
14	MS. BRYAN: Can you hear me?
15	MS. LAWSON: Yeah.
16	MS. BRYAN: Can you hear me?
17	MS. LAWSON: Yeah. It seems to be okay.
18	Go ahead right now. We'll see what happens.
19	MS. BRYAN: Okay.
20	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Does Mr. Sikes's work history
21	have any significance to the opinions that you are
22	going to offer in this case?
23	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
24	A. I'm --1 don't think I'm prepared to answer
25	that at this particular point.
0049
1	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Why not?
2	A. Because certainly where he was working at
3	particular points in time would be important, but I
4	don't --1 don't want to say that his occupations
5	would not be important, but I haven't really thought
6	about that issue at this juncture.
7	Q. Well, Dr. Martin, you understand, first of
8	all, that this is my opportunity to find out what your
9	opinions are, and second of all, this case is set for
10	trial in a month, correct?
11	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
12	A. Yes. And we're still sort of breaking up,
13	but I think I understood what you were saying.
14	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Well, this is my only shot at
15	finding out what your opinions are?
16	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
17	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) So about his work history, I'd
18	like to know what they are?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. Well, in terms of work history, there are
21	issues that have to do with where he might be located
22	and what kinds of materials would be available to him
23	at particular points in time. Just to give you an
24	example, we just talked about the availability of the
25	Pacific Stars and Stripes while he was in the Navy.
0050
1	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) What additional work do you
2	anticipate doing to analyze his work history?
3	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
4	A. Well, not -- I'm not concerned so much about
5	the work history, as I am about where he may have been
6	working at a particular point in time, which would
7	relate to the kinds of information that might have
8	been available in the areas in which he was working
9	and directly available to him.
10	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And how are you going to go
11	about ascertaining that?
12	A. Well, if he was--could give you an example,
13	if he was in the Pensacola area in the 1970s, which is
14	my impression, then that would certainly relate to,
15	let's say, the kinds of publications that would have
16	been available to that community and to him such as
17	the newspaper, the Pensacola News, that we have talked
18	about.
19	Q. Okay. Again, if you are not prepared to
20	testify about the role his work history plays in your
21	opinions today, when will you be prepared to testify
22	about the role his work history plays in your
23	opinions?
24	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
25	A. I don't know whether I'm going to testify
0051
1	about his work history as whether it's relevant or not
2	to the question of availability of information about
3	the health risks of smoking. His particular
4	occupations, is that what you -- that must be what
5	you're referring to, but I haven't spent time trying
6	to think about his particular work occupations at
7	various points in time, rather it is of greater
8	concern as to what locations, where he was, what might
9	have been available or what was available in those
10	particular locations, the kinds of information that
11	would have been available at particular points in
12	time.
13	MS. LAWSON: Leslie, I don't want to
14	interrupt --
15	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) I appreciate that. And
16	what --
17	MS. LAWSON: I apologize, Leslie. It's
18	still going in and out, and I have our technical
19	person here. She suggested if we cut off and dial
20	back in, it might take care of the problems we're
21	experiencing. Would that be okay with you?
22	MS. BRYAN: It's okay with me. I have
23	no idea how to do that so it's going to take me awhile
24	to get the technician back in this room.
25	MS. LAWSON: Okay. I'll ask my
0052
1	technical person if she can come back in maybe five
2	minutes, and we'll just try and see what we can do
3	until your technician arrives. Does that sound okay?
4	MS. BRYAN: He's ten minutes away so let
5	me just see.
6	MS. LAWSON: Hang on just one moment if
7	you would.
8	MR. MURPHY: Christine, I'm just going
9	to stay on the phone here.
10	MS. LAWSON: All right.
11	MR. MURPHY: Thank you.
12	MS. LAWSON: We're off the record at
13	this moment.
14	(Break.)
15	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Dr. Martin, you said that it
16	was important to you to understand where Mr. Sikes was
17	physically located during his work life, correct?
18	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
19	A. Yes. I think that is important to know.
20	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And you don't -- you haven't
21	figured that out?
22	A. I'm sorry. There you broke up, but I think I
23	got the question. You said, I believe, that -- that I
24	had not figured that out?
25	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
0053
1	A. Yes, I have a pretty good idea where he was.
2	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Well, this whole thing
3	started, this whole line of questioning started
4	because you told me that you were not prepared to talk
5	about his work history, including places where he
6	worked. Those are relevant to the opinions you intend
7	to offer, correct?
8	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
9	A. I've said now for the third or fourth time,
10	if I'm not mistaken, that it is important to know
11	where a person is at a particular point in time. That
12	does relate to where the person is working. But
13	whether he held --
14	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Yes.
15	A. -- a particular occupation, I -- that's not
16	something that is really relevant to the questions
17	that I've been asked.
18	Q. I appreciate that, but when I asked you about
19	what role his work history would play in your
20	opinions, you said exactly what you've just said, it's
21	the location that's important. And I get that, but
22	you also said that you were not yet prepared to
23	testify about the locations, and all I'm trying to
24	find out is when you will be because this is my shot?
25	A. I -
0054
1	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
2	A. I understand, and if I was unclear, you have
3	my apologies, but I now will say it again. I am
4	prepared on the subject of the locations. If I
5	misunderstood or did not answer your question clearly,
6	I -- that's all I can say; but now I'm saying as
7	clearly as I can, where he was located is important to
8	understanding in those locations what kinds of
9	information was available about the health risks of
10	smoking and also about the difficulties in quitting
11	smoking.
12	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) All right. Now, when was
13	Mr. Sikes -- when did Mr. Sikes leave the Navy?
14	A. He left the Navy in January of 1969,
15	according to his exit form. I believe it's called a
16	DD214.
17	Q. And then where did he go?
18	A. Where did he go?
19	Q. And then where did he go?
20	A. Well, there's some confusion on that point
21	because one record indicates that he stayed in
22	California and went to college in California, but
23	other records indicate that he did not stay in
24	California and he did not go to California, he went
25	back to the Pensacola area and started to work in the
0055
1	Pensacola area, I believe, managing a pizza store in a
2	shopping center.
3	Q. (Unintelligible) Had he been available had
4	he remained in California?
5	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
6	A. The question broke up. Could you repeat,
7	please? I'm sorry to ask you to do so.
8	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Have you examined what
9	materials would have been available to him about the
10	dangers of smoking and the difficulty in quitting had
11	he remained in California?
12	A. Yes. I've done extensive work in the
13	California records over the years.
14	Q. Have you done it in connection with this
15	case?
16	A. No, I haven't in connection with this
17	particular case because I believe the records say that
18	he did not stay in California for a long time, rather
19	he returned to Florida.
20	Q. Returned to Florida, he returned to
21	Pensacola?
22	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
23	A. In that general area, yes.
24	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Is it your understanding that
25	Mr. Sikes spent a lot of time at sea?
0056
1	A. That is -- the record would indicate --
2	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
3	A. -- during certain periods of time he spent
4	some time at sea. That is correct.
5	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Have you attempted to analyze
6	what would have been available to him while he was at
7	sea?
8	A. Well -
9	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
10	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And this is after he gets out
11	of the navy?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. This is --
14	A. When he mustered out of the Alabama National
15	Guard in 1975, his occupation was listed as a
16	comptroller at American Cyanamid in the Pensacola
17	area. Some time after that point in time, he
18	apparently did some training and spent some time
19	working on oil-related vessels in the Gulf of Mexico,
20	so he would have been in and out of ports in a regular
21	basis running from Pensacola over to New Orleans over
22	to Houston. Then sometimes --
23	Q. Did you analyze --
24	A. I'm sorry?
25	MS. LAWSON: I don't think he was
0057
1	finished, Leslie.
2	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Go ahead.
3	A. I was going to say, then some time around the
4	mid 1980s, he became involved as a captain of gambling
5	vessels, but they were going in and out of port on a
6	daily basis so he was in contact with the land. As I
7	understood it, these cruises averaged about six hours
8	so he was on land and sea, land and sea during that
9	period of time, and those were operating out of
10	Alabama over into Florida.
11	Q. When he was working in connection with oil
12	rigs, have you analyzed what information would have
13	been available to him during (unintelligible.)
14	MS. LAWSON: I apologize, Leslie. You
15	broke up. Can you repeat that?
16	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) When he was working at sea on
17	oil rigs, have you analyzed the information that would
18	have been available?
19	A. I think I have the gist of the question, that
20	have I analyzed what information was available while
21	he was running between ports or working at sea in the
22	Gulf of Mexico. That information would definitely be
23	available every time he landed wherever he landed.
24	Q. How long were they at sea?
25	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
0058
1	A. Well, if you're operating in the Gulf of
2	Mexico, he could have been at sea for a day or two on
3	any one of those runs or three or four days. I can't
4	answer that question because those records were not
5	available.
6	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Also, looking at Exhibit 4 at
7	the bottom of the first page, you've listed some
8	information about when he quit smoking and I think it
9	says I Love Lucy. There's a reference to Agent
10	Orange.
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. And that he used an inhaler and Bonanza. Can
13	you tell me how those fit with the opinions you're
14	going to offer in this case?
15	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
16	A. Well, those were notes I was taking from
17	the -- the first Janice Sikes deposition. I was
18	simply noting what she said. The question about I
19	Love Lucy, I presume had to do with cigarette
20	advertisements. The question about exposure to Agent
21	Orange is a Vietnam related, health-related question.
22	Agent Orange from my understanding was there in areas
23	where he was located in Vietnam. Things like
24	inhalers, asthma, I can't tell you, Bonanza --1 think
25	there was some statement that he liked to watch
0059
1	Bonanza, and that's all I can say about that.
2	Q. Does the fact that Mr. Sikes may have been
3	exposed to Agent Orange influence your opinions in
4	this case at all?
5	A. I'm really not a medical doctor. It's a
6	point of curiosity, because I've spent a lot of time
7	studying the Vietnam war as a historian and also as a
8	contemporary of that war, and I just have interest in
9	those kinds of matters. But, no, I'm not qualified
10	because I'm not a medical doctor. I can't speak to
11	those issues.
12	Q. And the same would apply with respect to his
13	asthma?
14	A. Yes. I don't --
15	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
16	A. Again, I'm not -- I'm not qualified to speak
17	about those kinds of subjects. I'm not a medical
18	doctor.
19	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Well, I appreciate that you're
20	not qualified to draw a link between exposure to Agent
21	Orange and any development of any disease, but are you
22	going to talk about the fact that he may have been
23	exposed to Agent Orange?
24	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
25	A. No, I'm not.
0060
1	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) You have in your notes on the
2	second page where you list his residences that he was
3	in Detroit from 1970 to '71. Do you know where you
4	got that information?
5	A. Yes. I believe that was information that
6	was -- this page comes from the interrogatory, and I
7	believe that -- all I can tell you at this point, it
8	must have come from the interrogatory, but that was
9	the only time I saw that reference to him being in the
10	Detroit area.
11	Q. On the next page -- and I think this is where
12	you've got some questions about his education
13	background; is that correct?
14	A. Well, I was taking notes based on the
15	education records that were made available to me, so
16	that's what I was trying to do here was to try to get
17	specific dates. I was trying to really just figure
18	out the pattern, because it varied from what --
19	somewhat from what was presented in the
20	interrogatories, that is to where he was living at
21	particular points in time.
22	Q. When did you receive the education records,
23	if you know?
24	A. I'm not sure I can give you a date, but I
25	would say I'm -- I'm not supposed to guess, but I'm
0061
1	guessing three months ago approximately.
2	Q. Could you please -- I'm having a difficulty
3	reading at the bottom of this third page. It
4	says, "Records, attended high school." Could you just
5	read to me what that section says?
6	A. If I can read my own handwriting, I'll be
7	glad to, which is sometimes --
8	Q. I appreciate the problem.
9	A. It's a challenge. I'll go as best I can.
10	"Attended high school 9/62 to '65." And that --
11	by "high school," that would also include the junior
12	high dates. "Attended, intermittently attended five
13	months of a repeat of ninth grade. Record says
14	highest grade completed eighth grade." That's from
15	his military record, his induction papers.
16	Q. Okay.
17	A. "Navy record dated 3 Jan. '69 says that he
18	has high school equivalency or an 04 GED." Now, that
19	is a substitute for a high school diploma, the GED.
20	Q. Is that something he could have completed
21	during his military service?
22	A. Yes. But there's no record that he did,
23	except for that statement.
24	Q. Okay.
25	A. On that particular document.
0062
1	Q. Now, your Page 4 has notes about Mr. Sikes's
2	military service. Tell me how your notes on his
3	military service fit with the opinions you intend to
4	offer in this case.
5	A. Just a second. I've got to make sure I get
6	the right page here.
7	Q. It's Page 4 of what I have.
8	A. Okay. Is this the one where it
9	says, "Vietnam service medal"? Is that the one you're
10	referring to?
11	Q. No. It says, "J. W. Sikes military," at the
12	top.
13	A. Oh.
14	Q. "Pay entry date U.S. Navy 6 May '65"?
15	A. Okay. Well, those are the key dates, the
16	first two there. He was authorized to wear a Vietnam
17	service medal in November, '66. I'm aware that, that
18	is anyone who was in that combat zone who received
19	combat pay would also receive that award. He was
20	authorized to wear two bronze stars, which meant he
21	had two additional years when he was in that zone, in
22	that combat zone, and that would cover the period,
23	according to the citations in the record, 25 December,
24	'65 to August 24, '67, which would encompass a
25	three-tour period. The record says that he was not
0063
1	entitled to wear any of the bronze stars. That's what
2	the record says. July 4, '67, he did re-qualify as an
3	assault boat coxswain. He received --
4	Q. Let me just in -- let me interrupt you for a
5	minute. The July -- excuse me, December 7, '67,
6	entry, not entitled to wear any bronze stars, do you
7	know why?
8	A. I have no idea. None whatsoever.
9	Q. Okay.
10	A. It's -- it's very unusual, and I just don't
11	know why.
12	Q. You say it's very unusual. Based on what is
13	it very -- what do you know that makes you say it's
14	very unusual?
15	A. Because usually if you are awarded a service
16	medal, and that's what these are, and the service --
17	this is not what we think of as a bronze star for
18	valor. This is something entirely different. I
19	didn't understand why he would not be authorized
20	because this would be -- you would wear these when you
21	had your dress uniform on. You wouldn't when you had
22	your scrubs on, be wearing them, because you're only
23	going to ruin them. So I have no idea why the record
24	said that.
25	Q. Okay.
0064
1	A. I cannot answer that question for you.
2	Q. Thank you. I interrupted you so go ahead.
3	A. Well, he did receive nonjudicial punishments
4	on two different occasions. I presume these were for
5	AWOLs. I noted the penalties, and then the last line,
6	the USS Pickaway -- oh, I'm sorry. That's just -- oh,
7	those are his dates of service on the USS Pickaway
8	from November, '65, to the 3rd of January, which was
9	his muster out date. He did go into the reserves for
10	two years to fulfill his six-year commitment. And
11	then the other things -- I'm sorry?
12	Q. No, go ahead.
13	A. Okay. The other things I noted on here were
14	points that individuals brought up in their
15	depositions, and once -- one person he told he was a
16	Navy seal. There was absolutely no record that he was
17	a Navy seal. He wouldn't have qualified as a Navy
18	seal. There's no evidence that he was a prisoner of
19	war. You would get citations that'll be part of your
20	military record in both cases, seal and the POW.
21	There's no evidence he ever received a silver star
22	except one document, which is questionable. The
23	bronze star, I put there because it has different
24	meanings in different circumstances, but he was not
25	a -- he did not receive a bronze star for valor in
0065
1	combat. There's no record of that. According to one
2	record, he had a purple heart and an additional stripe
3	on the purple heart, which meant that he was wounded
4	twice. There's no evidence he was wounded. And then
5	there's questions about his service in the special
6	forces and whether he was ever in the special forces
7	as part of the Alabama National Guard. Those were all
8	points that came up in the depositions in regard to
9	what he had said about his military career that could
10	not be verified from the military records.
11	Q. Dr. Martin, you're expected to testify about
12	historical research methodology and the history of
13	tobacco and cigarettes in this case; is that correct?
14	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
15	A. That is correct, yes.
16	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) What does James Sikes's
17	military record have to do with the history of tobacco
18	and cigarettes?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. Well, there are -- what I'm interested in, in
21	this particular instance is not something I am going
22	to testify about in court. I wasn't expecting to. I
23	was taking these notes out of those depositions
24	because I was interested in why there was such a
25	variation between what Mr. Sikes was telling people
0066
1	according to the depositions and what was actually in
2	and provable from his military record.
3	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) So it's something that was of
4	interest to you, but you will not discuss that at
5	trial?
6	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
7	A. I am not expecting to discuss that at trial.
8	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Will you discuss Mr. Sikes's
9	military experience at all beyond saying he's in the
10	military and had access to Pacific Stars and Stripes?
11	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
12	A. Well, I would say that would depend on
13	questions I would be asked during cross examination,
14	and I don't know what kinds of questions I'll be asked
15	during cross examination, so I can't answer that
16	question.
17	MS. BRYAN: Is Mr. Murphy still on the
18	phone?
19	MR. MURPHY: Hi, Leslie. I'm here.
20	MS. BRYAN: Why?
21	MR. MURPHY: Well, waiting to get some
22	documents. After the deposition started, I received,
23	which you probably got a copy of, an e-mail from John
24	Kalil. As soon as I get the document --
25	MS. BRYAN: Yes.
0067
1	MR. MURPHY: --the dismissal form, I'll
2	drop off.
3	MS. BRYAN: Okay.
4	MR. MURPHY: Tell John to send it to me
5	because I'm ready to go.
6	MS. BRYAN: Not in my jurisdiction.
7	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Dr. Martin, on the next page
8	that I have of the document is the one that says,
9	"Military J. W. Sikes Vietnam service medal"?
10	A. That's correct. I've got that.
11	Q. Okay. Do you intend to offer any opinions at
12	the trial of this case about his Vietnam service
13	medal?
14	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
15	A. Well, I --1 would answer that the same way
16	unless somebody asked me a question about it on cross
17	examination, but I -- I'm not going to in any way
18	assume or presume or even say that it would be part of
19	my direct testimony.
20	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) All right. So is it correct
21	to say that the focus of your direct testimony will
22	relate to locations where Mr. Sikes lived?
23	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
24	A. Well, certainly that would be one issue, yes.
25	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And what other issues would
0068
1	there be?
2	A. Well, information about the health risks of
3	smoking are literally all over the place, all over the
4	United States, in all of the areas where Mr. Sikes was
5	located, and that's an important part of the equation
6	that I think is what I'm supposed to be testifying
7	about and so that's really the best answer I can give
8	you about that.
9	Q. Doctor, do you know when R. J. Reynolds
10	acknowledged that cigarettes cause disease?
11	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
12	A. Well, I believe if you want a specific date,
13	it would probably be some time and in terms of an
14	acknowledgment, if we're not talking about warning
15	labels beginning in 1966, then I would say some time
16	around the year 2000 or so, something like that.
17	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) If information about the
18	health risks of cigarettes was so widespread, why did
19	it take R. J. Reynolds so long to reach the conclusion
20	that you said James Sikes should have reached?
21	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
22	A. Well, I can tell you the information was out
23	there and publicly available, and whether R. J.
24	Reynolds said anything or not, that wouldn't have
25	substantially changed the record because it is
0069
1	absolutely abundant in terms of information available
2	about the health risks of smoking.
3	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Generally, don't manufacturers
4	have better knowledge of their product than an
5	ordinary consumer?
6	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
7	A. I -- you're getting into a technical issue
8	that I am not prepared to answer. That isn't
9	something that I've looked into.
10	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Well, don't you think that the
11	Ford Motor Company knows more about its cars than you
12	do?
13	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
14	A. You know, you shouldn't have asked me that
15	question because I grew up in an automobile family,
16	but I'll concede that Ford probably does know a little
17	bit more at least these days than I do.
18	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Okay. I read your deposition
19	in the Reese case, and there you testified that you
20	had not read any internal tobacco company documents.
21	Do you recall that testimony?
22	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
23	A. Well, if I said any, I don't think that's
24	quite correct because I've been shown internal company
25	documents in various situations, and that would be the
0070
1	only qualifier I would put on that. I have not
2	engaged in trying to do a history of companies. Those
3	are not the questions that I was asked to investigate.
4	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Earlier this morning you said
5	that in connection with your Smoking In America work,
6	you had reviewed internal company documents?
7	MS. LAWSON: Object -
8	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Do you recall that?
9	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
10	A. Well, only in so much those internal
11	documents have been drawn to my attention and I have
12	reviewed them and, yes, there are certain kinds of --
13	see, we can get into what is an internal company
14	document. Well, if there's a record that -- of
15	public -- or, I mean, of polling that's an internal
16	company document, that would be of interest to me so
17	much as it relates to the public record, so that would
18	be the kind of document that I have looked at, yes.
19	But I'm not -- I'm not out in a search for company
20	documents, per se.
21	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) When you say "polling
22	documents," are you referring to RJR might have
23	conducted a poll to find out attitudes about smoking
24	so you've reviewed that kind of internal document?
25	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
0071
1	A. Yes. Specifically the Roper Organization
2	polls that were done in, actually, the '50s and the
3	'70s are the ones that I'm referring to.
4	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) We'll talk about polls in a
5	bit.
6	A. Sure.
7	Q. Other than reviewing internal company
8	documents that relate to polls that they may have
9	conducted, have you reviewed any other internal
10	company documents?
11	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
12	A. Yes. In -- in -- again, I have been shown
13	internal company documents, but I have also looked for
14	documents that would have been collected about the
15	kinds of information that was being made available to
16	people. To give you an example, there's a famous
17	radio personality by the name of Paul Harvey, and
18	there are a number of Paul Harvey documents, radio
19	transcripts in those internal documents, and that is
20	of interest to me because those are transcripts of
21	publicly-presented information to give you that kind
22	of an example.
23	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Now, you said that you were
24	shown company documents. Who showed you company
25	documents?
0072
1	A. Well, I -
2	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
3	A. I have been shown company documents in the
4	sense they have come up in depositions, and they have
5	also come up in trial.
6	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Has any - go ahead.
7	A. That's all I was going to say. During cross
8	examination.
9	Q. Has any lawyer or anyone affiliated with a
10	law firm that represents Reynolds ever shown you any
11	company documents?
12	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
13	A. No. I can't think of any -- any situations
14	like that.
15	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Then you also said that you
16	had looked for documents yourself. Tell me about
17	that.
18	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
19	A. Well, I gave you two examples, the Roper
20	polls, and the Paul Harvey material because I found
21	out that those documents were there and potentially
22	available.
23	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) How did you go about looking
24	for them?
25	A. Well, the starting point is a -- a book that
0073
1	was edited. I can't remember the name of the title of
2	the book, but it came out in the 1990s approximately
3	by a gentleman by the name of Stanton Glantz about
4	company documents located at the University of
5	California at San Francisco, and I looked at that book
6	in reference to materials that had to do with
7	materials I had been shown about movies and product
8	placement, and that's what started the process of my
9	looking for certain kinds of documents that might
10	relate to the information that was available to the
11	public.
12	Q. Okay. So to break that down, you looked at
13	Stanton Glantz's book, and were you specifically
14	looking for references to movie placement or tell me
15	what you're looking for?
16	A. Yes.
17	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
18	A. Because that issue came up in a deposition or
19	cross examination, one or the other. I don't remember
20	at this point in time.
21	Q. Did Mr. Glantz's book cover areas other than
22	product placement in movies?
23	A. It is -- it is a summary of the material that
24	made its way from Brown & Williamson to the archives
25	at the University of California at San Francisco so
0074
1	there are a number of subjects that are covered in the
2	book, according to what he and others divided them
3	into.
4	Q. What else did you learn from reading the
5	book?
6	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
7	A. Well, I --1 learned that this notion that
8	there was some deal made with actor Sylvester
9	Stallone, which was given prominent information to the
10	press, was actually highly inaccurate and that the
11	deal was never consummated or took place. So what I
12	did, I studied ten Sylvester Stallone films and found
13	out he had nothing good to say about tobacco products,
14	and they all emphasized that cigarettes were bad for
15	one's health, bad for their appearance, bad for their
16	breath and everything else you can come up with and
17	that these were the kind -- part of the popular
18	culture information that's being made available to the
19	public. So it was misrepresented. That's what I
20	learned.
21	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Did the book cover anything
22	other than product placement in cigarettes in movies?
23	A. I think it probably did. I haven't looked at
24	the book for years. I honestly couldn't give you
25	anymore details.
0075
1	Q. Have you followed any of the news stories
2	about what was found in tobacco documents once they
3	were ordered to be released in litigation?
4	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
5	A. I -- yes. I've seen news stories about that,
6	yes.
7	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) You don't shy away from
8	reading those?
9	A. If they're part of the public information
10	that's being made available to the public, they're
11	being made available to the public, that's correct,
12	yes. I don't shy away from that. If it's part of
13	public record, that's my point. There's a difference
14	between private documents and public record documents.
15	Q. Have you ever gone -- well, are you aware
16	that there are millions of pages of documents
17	available online to anybody who wants to access them?
18	A. Yes.
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. That has been true for the last, what, eight
21	or ten years. That's not what I'm referring to. I'm
22	referring to documents that were, as I understood your
23	question, documents that were available and being
24	covered in newspaper reports. That's what I thought
25	you were asking me about. That makes it a public
0076
1	document. Going and doing research on the internet is
2	somewhat different than referring to a document that
3	is widely available to the public in the sense that
4	it's printed and put --
5	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Well, have you ever -- go
6	ahead.
7	A. I'm done.
8	Q. Have you ever attempted to conduct a search
9	of the legacy database or any other database that has
10	the internal tobacco company documents in it?
11	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
12	A. Well, I --1 believe I already answered the
13	question.
14	MS. BRYAN: I think they want to reboot.
15	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Pardon me?
16	A. I'm sorry? I heard something about
17	rebooting.
18	Q. Go ahead.
19	A. Would you --
20	Q. The technician is here.
21	A. Would you just re --
22	Q. The technician is here.
23	MS. BRYAN: Christine, if you want to
24	reboot, the technician is here. We can do it.
25	MS. LAWSON: Okay. Yeah. I'd like to
0077
1	do that. Do you want him to finish whatever he was
2	saying or do you want to just -- what do you want to
3	do?
4	MS. BRYAN: Let's just start with that
5	question, and we'll ask the reporter to read it back
6	when we get back on the record.
7	MS. LAWSON: Sounds good.
8	(Break.)
9	MS. BRYAN: If we could have the court
10	reporter read back the last question.
11	(The requested portion was read.)
12	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
13	A. Not in any systematic way.
14	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Have you done so in an
15	unsystematic way?
16	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
17	A. Well, I just gave you that example from the
18	Glantz materials, which go back to the legacy
19	documents that you're referring to. Actually, there
20	are two different sets out there. One is the
21	California, and one is the larger group of documents.
22	So in an unsystematic way, if I think there is
23	something there that relates to what is part of the
24	public record, not record in this case that was put on
25	the internet, that would be a potential interest to me
0078
1	depending on the nature of the subject.
2	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) So when you wanted to find the
3	Paul Harvey transcripts, you went to one of these
4	online databases and searched for them; is that
5	correct?
6	A. That is the only place I could find them.
7	Q. And the same would be true when you were
8	looking for documents pertaining to product placement
9	and movies, you did that search yourself?
10	A. Yes, I did.
11	Q. In performing those searches, did you find
12	any documents that you did not think were relevant to
13	your inquiry?
14	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
15	A. Well, let's take the example of the product
16	placement issue. I became aware of that because of
17	articles that appeared in newspapers such as the Los
18	Angeles Times, which mischaracterized that
19	relationship. I didn't know whether it
20	mischaracterized it at the time so I did the research
21	to see what did these movies actually say about
22	smoking rather than assuming that the movies said
23	something favorable toward the habit of smoking. So
24	that's why I did the research because I wanted to find
25	out what the actual historical record was as opposed
0079
1	to what was printed in some newspaper.
2	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Now, you have testified before
3	that your reason for not examining in-depth company
4	documents was that what the company people were saying
5	among themselves had no impact on public awareness; is
6	that correct?
7	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
8	A. Well, I can't accept the word impact. What I
9	can say is it had no relationship because a private
10	conversation between two people or private documents
11	internal to a company or university or whatever
12	doesn't -- it doesn't bear upon the public information
13	that is out there and available. But if that
14	information at some points becomes available then at
15	that point in time, it might have some impact.
16	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) I'm not sure I understand
17	what you're telling me. If it -- if there are a chain
18	of internal memoranda that are being exchanged between
19	employees of R. J. Reynolds, those have no impact
20	because they're not known to the public; is that
21	correct?
22	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
23	A. I believe that, that's what I'm trying to
24	say, yes.
25	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) But then they could become
0080
1	relevant, and that's where I didn't understand your
2	response?
3	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
4	A. Well, if the -- whatever information was
5	internal at some point becomes part of the public,
6	that is it becomes publicly available, it might have
7	some impact to some type or kind. This is so vague
8	and theoretical I don't even know how to answer it,
9	but it might or it might not. After all, there's lots
10	and lots of information out there that smoking is bad
11	for one's health.
12	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) But none of it was coming from
13	the tobacco companies, correct?
14	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
15	A. Well, every cigarette pack I've seen by
16	federal law in 1966 contained a warning label that
17	cigarettes were not good for health, and those were
18	printed by the tobacco companies.
19	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Okay. And did the tobacco
20	companies embrace the idea of putting warning labels
21	on their cigarettes?
22	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
23	A. Well, that's a judgment call. They followed
24	the law. Whether they embraced it is beside the
25	point.
1	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Isn't it a fact that they
2	litigated with the federal trade commission in an
3	effort to avoid having to put warning labels on their
4	cigarettes?
5	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
6	A. Well, you're getting into areas of
7	Congressional disagreement and whether there was
8	litigation or not, I can't answer that question. I
9	don't know.
10	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Did you run across anything
11	about litigation in your work in this case?
12	A. Well, that's a fairly broad question. I
13	don't know how to answer that question.
14	Q. It's a bad question. Did you run across
15	anything about threats of litigation concerning the
16	FTC requirement that they put warning labels on
17	cigarettes?
18	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
19	A. Well, the FTC did not have the authority
20	according to Congress to put warning labels on
21	cigarettes. That was certainly debated in '64 and
22	into '65, but Congress did with the signature of the
23	president, so I don't know about litigation between
24	the FTC and the tobacco companies.
25	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) You do have -- well, never 0082
1	mind. We'll come back to that. Is it important to
2	put historical facts in context?
3	A. Yes. It's essential to the historical
4	process. Absolutely essential.
5	Q. So, for example, isn't it a historical fact
6	that in the fall of 2001, people all over the United
7	States were wearing T-shirts and baseball caps that
8	said FDNY or PDNY?
9	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
10	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Do you remember that?
11	A. You're talking about --
12	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
13	A. -911?
14	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) I'm talking about in the fall
15	of 2001 you started seeing people all over the United
16	States wearing T-shirts and caps that referred to the
17	fire department of New York and the police department
18	in New York?
19	A. Right.
20	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
21	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And in order to understand
22	why, if you sort of observed this around the United
23	States and said why are all these people wearing these
24	T-shirts and baseball caps, to understand that, you've
25	have to understand something about the context,
0083
1	wouldn't you?
2	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
3	A. I would suppose so.
4	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Well, there was a reason that
5	people in the United States were wearing T-shirts and
6	baseball caps bearing the insignia of the New York
7	fire department and the New York police department,
8	correct?
9	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
10	A. I already gave you the reason. It's called
11	911.
12	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) So that's the context. In the
13	context of 9/11, people all over the United States
14	started showing support for the fire department and
15	police department by wearing their T-shirts and
16	baseball caps, correct?
17	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
18	A. I don't know what you want me to say. This
19	seems to be a little bit far afield and analogizing,
20	but if you want me to say yes, the context I've said
21	now for the third time is 911.
22	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And the context is important
23	to understand why something --
24	A. I teach that every semester --
25	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
0084
1	A. -- in every class that I teach at the
2	University of Houston.
3	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) You teach what, the context is
4	important?
5	A. Do you want me to go through the courses?
6	I'd be happy to do that for you.
7	Q. Well, okay. Go ahead.
8	A. Okay. Introduction to Graduate Research and
9	Writing in the United States History, Advanced
10	Research and Writing in the United States History, the
11	History of Ordinary Persons in America, the American
12	Revolution, Addiction and Disease in the American
13	Experience, The Revolutionary War. I'm getting ready
14	to teach one on allied -- let me say -- let me
15	rephrase, World War II, The Air War in Europe. I
16	teach about context all the time. Keeping information
17	to context is absolutely essential to what historians
18	do, so we have no disagreement.
19	Q. Tell me about your course in addiction and
20	disease.
21	A. That is an upper-division course on the
22	undergraduate level, and it is a seminar-style course
23	in which I have the students get engaged in
24	researching about the history of addiction and disease
25	with respect to three subjects area -- I'm sorry,
0085
1	three subject areas. One of those areas about the
2	third of the course is about alcohol. About a third
3	of the course is about tobacco and cigarettes, and
4	about a third of the course is about hard drugs, that
5	is illegal drugs like cocaine and heroin.
6	Q. How long have you been teaching that course?
7	A. I think the first time I offered that
8	course -- well, I'd have to say close to ten years
9	now. About every --
10	Q. Pardon me?
11	A. Close to ten years. I teach it about every
12	third semester as part of my teaching rotation.
13	Q. Do you have a syllabus for that course?
14	A. Yes, I do. I don't have one with me, but,
15	yes, I do.
16	Q. Does it have assigned readings in connection
17	with tobacco?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. What are the assigned readings?
20	A. Well, there are two types of assigned
21	readings. One would be documents having to do with
22	how the basic concept of addiction, that is it's going
23	to be difficult to quit if you use tobacco products.
24	I have primary source materials that I use, such as
25	King James counter blast against tobacco and various
0086
1	documents like that going over a period of time, and
2	then on the other hand there is the -- the basic book
3	that I use is by a gentleman by the name of Erik Bums
4	and --
5	Q. And what's --
6	A. The title? If you -- you --
7	Q. Yes.
8	A. You can just look it up. I get book titles
9	mixed up all the time but it's a history of tobacco
10	use and problems associated with tobacco use in the
11	American experience.
12	MS. BRYAN: Christine, I'd like to
13	request a copy of the syllabus, please.
14	MS. LAWSON: Okay. I'll ask him to
15	provide that to us, and we'll e-mail it to you as soon
16	as I have it.
17	A. I've got it on a computer so I ought to be
18	able to get -- now, the last time I taught the
19	course -- I'm going to teach it this fall, let me
20	explain, and I haven't put together my syllabus for
21	the fall, but it'll be basically the same. Sol'll
22	send you or I'll send Christine a file with the most
23	recent version if that's okay.
24	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) That's fine.
25	A. I think that was --1 --1 think I did it a
0087
1	year ago, so it's fairly fresh.
2	Q. Now, Dr. Martin, I know that you haven't
3	reviewed the internal documents or Reynolds or any of
4	the other companies in terms of their public relations
5	campaigns, but I'd like to ask you to assume that the
6	documents show that the companies hired a public
7	relations firm for the purpose of countering the
8	message that cigarettes caused cancer or cigarettes
9	caused disease. Can you assume that for me?
10	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
11	A. I really don't want to get in a series of
12	assumptions like that because we're getting into a
13	hypothetical, and I warn my students all the time not
14	to get involved in hypotheticals.
15	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) I know. But you're an expert
16	witness and I'm entitled to ask you hypotheticals, so
17	I'm asking you to assume that for me.
18	A. Well, I'll assume, and I'll disagree with
19	your assumptions when I assume. Okay. So long as
20	it's part of the record that I disagree, I'll be glad
21	to assume.
22	Q. If one assumes that there is -- that the
23	tobacco companies hire a PR firm and that the PR
24	firm's job is to dispel concerns about smoking and
25	health, doesn't that play a role in your opinion about
0088
1	what's generally available in the public knowledge?
2	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
3	A. Well, certainly I am aware of what you're
4	talking about specifically, and I have looked into
5	that issue, and I have concluded that it is generally
6	speaking a non-impact issue in terms of public
7	awareness with respect to the health consequences,
8	public awareness about the health consequences of
9	smoking.
10	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) How did you look into the
11	issue?
12	A. Well, I looked into the issue because there
13	are newspaper stories that appear in 19 -- at the end
14	of 1953 and the beginning and middle of 1954 that
15	revolve around this document called the Frank
16	Statement which appeared in newspapers across the
17	country in early 1954 and so the question is: Is that
18	an impact document? Is that a reliable document?
19	That sort of thing, that's what I looked at. And both
20	before and after that document, there are stories and
21	newspapers across the country that smoking is
22	deleterious to one's health, and the public is
23	following that story, not the Frank Statement story,
24	and that is reflected in public opinion polls such as
25	those provided by the Gallop organization during the
0089
1	spring and summer of 1954. So the public was
2	following the information that was being presented in
3	those epidemiological studies. It was not following
4	the other information.
5	Q. I'm sorry. Doctor, I was looking for
6	something in my outline that I'm not seeing so we'll
7	move on to another area.
8	A. No problem.
9	Q. Without looking at the internal documents of
10	Reynolds or any other tobacco company, did you become
11	aware of instances in which the industry paid for
12	articles to appear in -- articles supportive of the
13	industry position to appear in magazines?
14	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
15	A. I'm aware of one article that has been a
16	focal point of some analysis that appeared in a
17	magazine. I'm forgetting the name of the magazine.
18	I'm aware of that one article, yes. I'm trying to
19	think of the name of the magazine, but I can't. I'm
20	not coming up with it right now.
21	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Is that the True magazine
22	article?
23	A. Yes, ma'am. That's correct. The True
24	magazine article.
25	Q. Are you aware of any other instances in which
0090
1	tobacco paid for an article to be placed in a
2	magazine?
3	A. In terms of —
4	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
5	A. -- that kind of -- there may well be other
6	instances, but, again, in terms of impact, they are
7	non-impact matters.
8	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) I think some place in your
9	disclosure, you say that one of the things that
10	informs the public knowledge are pamphlets that are
11	available from anti-smoking organizations and the
12	like; is that correct?
13	A. Yes. Pamphlets and also certainly public
14	service announcements, too.
15	Q. Did you ever become aware that the industry
16	prepared so-called white papers that were circulated
17	to the medical community in an effort to rebut claims
18	about cigarettes and disease?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. Yes. I've seen some of those. I haven't seen
21	probably all of them, but I've seen some of them
22	primarily in the 1970s.
23	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And how did you come to see
24	those?
25	A. Well, I simply ran across them in the process
0091
1	of my research.
2	Q. What were you researching that led you to run
3	across them if you recall?
4	A. I don't really recall specifically what I
5	might have been researching. There may have been a
6	reference to some type or kind or something that made
7	me want to look at these. Again, they didn't receive
8	wide circulation, but that's all I can tell you about
9	it.
10	Q. Do those have any relevance to the opinions
11	that you intend to offer in this case?
12	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
13	A. Well, in the sense that I am aware of them
14	and that I am aware that some of these kinds of
15	materials exist, I've had to take them into
16	consideration in forming my overall opinion as to
17	whether the public was indeed aware of the health risk
18	of smoking and all the evidence by all the measures is
19	the public was not only aware but that kept increasing
20	overtime despite these kinds of documents that you're
21	referencing.
22	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) You've testified in the past
23	that there are three parts to your historical
24	methodology and as I understand it, you are to define
25	the topic of historical nature, you're going to
0092
1	identify the possible sources that will inform you,
2	and then you're going to look at and evaluate the
3	credibility and reliability of what you find; is that
4	correct?
5	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
6	A. Right.
7	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Is that how you approach
8	things?
9	MS. LAWSON: Same objection.
10	A. Yes. Except there is a fourth, and that is
11	the presentation of that information, whether that be
12	in public written form or present a paper or give a
13	speech or talk in a deposition or testify at trial as
14	various ways of presenting that information. That's a
15	fourth part of the phase.
16	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Let's talk about the
17	presentation phase.
18	A. Okay.
19	Q. You have done a number of professional
20	presentations about your research into the
21	revolutionary war, correct?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. Stand up at meetings of your colleagues and
24	say, This is my opinion of how the war was conducted
25	or why it ended early or the role that the -- this
0093
1	particular battle played; you've done that extensively
2	throughout your career, correct?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. Have you made any of those kinds of
5	presentations to your professional colleagues about
6	the opinions that you're expressing in tobacco
7	litigation?
8	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
9	A. I don't think that is an appropriate form for
10	these -- I've been invited, and I've turned those
11	opportunities down because I don't think that's an
12	appropriate form for that kind of discussion.
13	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Who has invited you to make
14	presentations?
15	A. Well, actually, I received two in the last
16	year, one for a regional conference that was to be
17	held in the south somewhere to talk about these
18	issues, and the other one was with respect to a
19	upcoming conference at the American Historical
20	Association. I believe that was to be scheduled in
21	January of 2013.
22	Q. And when you say you were invited to a
23	regional conference to talk about these issues, tell
24	me what issues you were invited to talk about.
25	A. Well, actually, I was invited in one instance
0094
1	to talk --1 believe they wanted me to talk about
2	company-related issues, and I said that's not
3	something that I'm doing. That's not part of my
4	subject area. And then the other one was to comment
5	on a book that has come out recently by a fellow by
6	the name of Robert Proctor, and I thought that was
7	inappropriate.
8	Q. Was that the golden holocaust book?
9	A. Yes, it was.
10	Q. So if I understand correctly, you've been
11	invited to speak on two occasions about your tobacco
12	work. You turned down the first one because they
13	wanted you to talk about the companies, and that's
14	outside your area of expertise, correct?
15	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
16	A. Something along that line.
17	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And-
18	A. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to talk over you.
19	Q. Was there anything else?
20	A. I did not pursue it because it just seemed to
21	be something that I felt I wasn't qualified to
22	participate in.
23	Q. And the second time that you have been asked
24	to speak is at an upcoming conference, and you were
25	asked to talk about Dr. Proctor's new book; is that
0095
1	right?
2	A. Yes. And since I don't consider it a
3	historical work, I decided that I shouldn't
4	participate.
5	Q. Why don't you consider it a historical work?
6	A. Well, first of all, I've only looked at
7	portions of it, but it really is a compilation of
8	material that he has presented on and off over the
9	years, which is, I would say --1 would define it this
10	way, is it's much more social commentary than it is
11	based on what he presents is based on his opinions and
12	social commentary rather than what the historical
13	record actually says about the subjects that I've been
14	asked to look into, those being the health risks of
15	smoking and what people have been aware of in terms of
16	difficulties in quitting smoking.
17	Q. But to finish this up, the bottom line is you
18	have never made any presentation in a professional
19	context about your work in tobacco, correct?
20	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
21	A. That -- yes, that's correct. I have not
22	tried to. There may have been other invitations in
23	years past, but I --1 don't recall them now.
24	Q. Have you published anything about your work
25	in -- on tobacco issues?
0096
1	A. Not to this date.
2	Q. And I understand that you are working on your
3	Smoking In America, but to date you've published
4	nothing?
5	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
6	A. Well, I've been asked to do book reviews
7	because people are aware of the work that I'm doing in
8	academic journals, but that -- that would be the
9	extent of it at this particular point in time.
10	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And have you done such book
11	reviews?
12	A. Yes, I have.
13	Q. What have you reviewed?
14	A. Well, it's over a ten-year period. Let's
15	see. A book by Cassandra Tate. The title is
16	something like, The Little White Slaver. It's a study
17	of what people are aware of in tobacco use and why
18	from the 1890s to the 1920s. That was for the Journal
19	of Social History. I reviewed a book that an
20	Australian historian wrote about the history of
21	tobacco awareness and health risks for the Journal of
22	American History. I do a lot of book reviews so this
23	is -- it's not something that's on the tip of my
24	tongue. I guess we do have my vitae. If you really
25	want to go through it, it's there.
0097
1	Q. No, that's okay. We don't really need to
2	take the time to do that.
3	A. Okay.
4	MS. BRYAN: Christine, do you have his
5	list of materials handy that we can mark as Exhibit 5?
6	MS. LAWSON: I do. Just a moment.
7	(Exhibit No. 5 was marked.)
8	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Dr. Martin, do you have in
9	front of you Exhibit 5?
10	A. Yes, I do.
11	Q. Would you tell me what that is, please?
12	A. Yes. This is a reliance material list dated
13	July 27th, 2012.
14	Q. I recognize that it's got the date of July
15	27th on it, but when was it most recently updated?
16	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
17	A. Most recently updated, it was prepared for
18	this based on conversations that I had with
19	individuals at Jones Day earlier in the month. I'm
20	not aware of an earlier version, but there may have
21	been one. I --1 can't answer that question.
22	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Who prepared this list?
23	A. I prepared it with the staff attorney at the
24	Jones Day law firm.
25	Q. And who was that lawyer?
0098
1	A. That person's name is Noreen Denuzzo.
2	Q. Tell me the mechanics of how this list came
3	to be. Do you send her articles? Does--and she
4	gets them put on a list or tell me how it comes about?
5	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
6	A. Well, we have conversations on the phone
7	about what we want to cover, and I --1 always make
8	the point that I want the list to be comprehensive to
9	make sure that we're covering and establishing a very
10	important point that this information is basically
11	available on a national and a regional and a local
12	level, Point A, and Point B, that it has been widely
13	available over a long period of time, which is part of
14	the importance of this particular story. It's one
15	that doesn't go away, but it's one that is repeated
16	over and over again, which is very important in terms
17	of the issue of public awareness. So it's within that
18	framework that we will select documents for this
19	particular document based on materials that were
20	nationally available, regionally available, locally
21	available. Well, for instance, there are Stars and
22	Stripes articles here on this. There's also the New
23	York Times. I doubt whether Mr. Sikes read the New
24	York Times, but that's part of the national message
25	that is out there and available that would have made
0099
1	people aware that smoking wasn't good for them. So
2	that's the general procedure.
3	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Now, am I correct that the
4	first lawyer you met with who represented tobacco was
5	Steve Kaczynski from Jones Day?
6	A. And Paul Koethe, those two.
7	Q. And we've already talked about that was in
8	1994 you believe during the summer, correct?
9	A. I believe May or June of 1994. I'm giving
10	you an approximate on that.
11	Q. When did you first begin researching the
12	history of tobacco in the United States?
13	A. Well, I began running across the story in the
14	1970s when I was involved and very active in
15	researching the Drinking In America book, because the
16	two subjects are tied together as I learned over and
17	over again, especially in working with 19th century
18	and early 20th century documents. So that's when the
19	research really began. But in terms of actually
20	activating and pursuing it as a topic in and of
21	itself, I was asked whether I'd like to pursue these
22	questions, and because I had that background and
23	experience and was suspicious, there was a lot of
24	information there, if I can put it that way. I said
25	I'd be happy to look into the issue or the questions
0100
1	that I was asked to review.
2	Q. So beginning some time after May or June of
3	1994 and your meeting with Mr. Kaczynski and
4	Mr. Koethe, you began to conduct the research; is that
5	correct?
6	A. Well, in a more systematic --
7	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
8	A. -- fashion, yes.
9	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) I understand. You'd run
10	across articles before --
11	A. Right.
12	Q. -- but now you were going to approach this
13	very systematically. Tell me how you went about going
14	and doing your research.
15	A. It's hard for me to summarize in a few words
16	but I started to visit archives in various parts of
17	the country, whether it be the New York Public
18	Library, which has the massive Arents collection of
19	documents. I visited there. I visited many, many
20	different archives all other the place. For instance,
21	the Cleveland Public Library of all places has a
22	massive collection of 19th and 20th century pamphlets,
23	which focus on the health risks of smoking. This
24	literature is being made available in those -- in
25	earlier times. I've been all over. I've been
0101
1	everywhere where there's something that I think I can
2	follow up on that may relate to the story about public
3	awareness with respect to the health risks of smoking
4	and issues of quitting. If I gave you an estimate,
5	I've probably been over the years on some 60 research
6	trips everywhere from the Library of Congress to the
7	New York Public Library to the Cleveland Public
8	Library to the Ohio State Library to the Rutgers
9	University Library to libraries in California at
10	Berkley in San Francisco and on and on and on. So
11	that's how I did it.
12	Q. And how many hours did you spend on this
13	project?
14	A. I have no idea at this point. None
15	whatsoever. A lot.
16	Q. Were you working with a research assistant?
17	A. Quite often, yes. Sometimes I made trips by
18	myself. Sometimes I had a research assistant.
19	Q. Were you ever accompanied by any of the
20	lawyers on those trips?
21	A. Never.
22	Q. When did you first learn that Christopher
23	Columbus had written about tobacco?
24	A. That's a good question because that may have
25	been even earlier than we've talked about because that
0102
1	does appear in some textbooks, but I would say
2	probably I was picking those stories up during the --
3	the phase when I was working on the Drinking In
4	America.
5	Q. Tell me a textbook that references
6	Christopher Columbus and tobacco?
7	A. Well, I can't give one off -- give you one
8	off the top of my head, but there are many text books
9	that I read that deal with colonial America, the
10	founding of the colonies, that sort of thing where
11	these issues would be referenced because there is the
12	whole issue about the importance of tobacco in terms
13	of colonial economies and text books deal with that.
14	Sometimes the general books do, but more often the
15	more specialized kinds of books that are designed for
16	specific course areas, more upper-division courses.
17	Q. Well -
18	A. I don't read textbooks anymore.
19	Q. — Dr. Martin, you're the historian --
20	A. I don't read textbooks anymore. I don't read
21	them anymore. Why would I? I don't have any reason
22	to read them.
23	Q. I'm sorry. What?
24	A. I said it's been a long time since I read a
25	textbook about colonial American history, so I can't
0103
1	name a specific --
2	Q. I appreciate that, but --1 appreciate that.
3	You said that textbooks referenced Christopher
4	Columbus and tobacco, and I'm just trying to find out
5	what textbooks.
6	A. Well, if you want me to research the issue,
7	I'll be glad to do it, but I can tell you I can't
8	remember. I simply don't remember.
9	Q. You then started talking about colonial
10	America, and you're the historian but doesn't
11	Christopher Columbus predate colonial America?
12	A. Well -
13	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
14	A. --1 took courses at graduate school dealing
15	with colonial America. I took undergraduate courses
16	dealing with colonial America, and that was actually,
17	if you'd like to know, well over 40 years ago so it's
18	a little bit tough for me to remember the books that
19	we were assigned in those courses. But I certainly
20	became aware that one of the things that interested
21	Columbus about America was this crop called tobacco.
22	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) But when you referred to the
23	economic impact of tobacco in colonial America, you
24	weren't referring to Christopher Columbus, were you?
25	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
0104
I	A. I was refer --
2	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) You were referring to the
3	English settlers?
4	A. Yeah.
5	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
6	A. We're getting more into the English form of
7	colonization, but certainly there was Spanish
8	colonization and there was French colonization and
9	tobacco was being grown in various locations.
10	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Now, the document that you
II	provided -- and Christine, I think, has the DVDs in
12	front of her. Do those DVDs contain all of the
13	materials -- they're the images of the materials that
14	are listed on Exhibit 5; is that correct?
15	A. Yes. Except it may actually -- some images
16	may have more than just that specific page because of
17	the process of cutting and pasting and posting and all
18	that sort of thing. That's a technical issue that I'm
19	not very conversant with. I'm not good at doing that
20	sort of thing. I hope you understand what I mean.
21	I'm just saying -- what I'm saying is there may be two
22	or three pages, but there's only one page that is
23	actually referenced in this particular. That's all.
24	Q. Well, if I were looking for Item No. 564 at
25	the bottom of Page 20 of Exhibit 5, and I went to one
0105
I	of those --
2	A. Wait just a minute. I've got to find it.
3	You mean temperance education No. 316 in 1942?
4	Q. Yes. If I went -- if I got the DVD that had
5	ANS 001733, I'd find that document, right?
6	A. I would hope so.
7	Q. Me, too.
8	A. Be my guest.
9	Q. Well, I have not had the opportunity to look
10	at each and every one of them, but that's what it
II	looks to be to me. Now, you have provided us your
12	number one this Christopher Columbus --
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. — paper on tobacco. That's in Spanish,
15	isn't it, on the DVD?
16	A. I hope not because the version I have is in
17	English.
18	Q. The version I -- well, I think the version I
19	have on the DVD is in Spanish?
20	A. Is it? Well, the version I have actually
21	have available to me and have used and have copies of
22	and have gotten out of the University of Houston
23	Library is actually in English, so I don't understand.
24	It comes from the original --it was originally in
25	Spanish, but it was translated into English so I don't
0106
1	know why this one appeared there that way.
2	Q. Okay. Are you suggesting that James Sikes
3	read this document that Christopher Columbus wrote?
4	A. No. I'm not suggesting that.
5	Q. All right.
6	MS. BRYAN: Christine, could you put
7	that --1 think it's -- at least on mine, it's DVD 1
8	of 5. Could you put that in your computer?
9	MS. LAWSON: I am doing that now.
10	MS. BRYAN: And if you would, see if you
11	locate the Christopher Columbus letter, which is AIW
12	3523.
13	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. I thought you
14	meant 105, which was the course of study in Illinois.
15	MS. LAWSON: What was the number again,
16	Leslie? I apologize.
17	MS. BRYAN: The document that I'm
18	looking for is the Christopher Columbus document,
19	which on mine is AIW 3523.
20	MS. LAWSON: Okay.
21	MS. BRYAN: I don't care about the
22	document as much as I care about the index to the
23	disk, so if you can't get the document open I just
24	want him to be able to look at the index to the disk,
25	what's on it.
0107
1	MS. LAWSON: No. That's not the issue.
2	It's just the images on the disk are not necessarily
3	in the same order as the images on the reliance list
4	so I was looking for the particular image number, and
5	it was not on the first disk.
6	MS. BRYAN: It is -- well, it's on my
7	first disk.
8	MS. LAWSON: What I'm looking at is an
9	AIW number. These are all ATVs. I'll put Disk No. 1
10	in. Maybe I missed it.
11	MS. BRYAN: Are you at the AIW?
12	MS. LAWSON: Yeah, I am. I was just
13	looking at the wrong spot on the disk. I apologize.
14	MS. BRYAN: That's okay.
15	MS. LAWSON: There are just a lot of
16	documents on there.
17	MS. BRYAN: Don't bother to open the
18	document because I want him to look at the front of
19	it.
20	MS. LAWSON: Certainly.
21	THE WITNESS: What do you want me to
22	see?
23	MS. LAWSON: What do you want him to
24	see, Leslie?
25	MS. BRYAN: What I'm looking at is just
1	the thumbnails of the various documents and if you
2	clicked on any one of those thumbnails you'd actually
3	get the document to open. Is that what you're looking
4	at?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) So my question is actually
7	sort of simple and you see this throughout them. If
8	you look at the thumbnail that's AIW 3523, if we click
9	that open, that would be the Christopher Columbus
10	document. But if you go up a couple of spaces you see
11	AIW 00536. Do you see that?
12	A. Yeah. I think I -- wait a minute.
13	MS. LAWSON: That's 520. Well, the one
14	right above it is -- well, the one right above it is
15	3461, then 533, then 525, 520 going straight up that
16	row or that column.
17	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) So my -- my question is: What
18	are the gaps? What's in those gap of numbers?
19	A. Are you asking me?
20	Q. Yes.
21	A. You're asking me a technical question. I
22	don't know what you mean about gaps in numbers. I
23	have no idea.
24	Q. Well, I have a document that's numbered AIW
25	534 then 536 then 2928 then 3461, and I'm just
0109
1	wondering what's in between those gaps in the numbers?
2	A. I --1 can only say that this must be some
3	sort of a system that some -- that -- that is used to
4	pull up these documents. That's all I can give you
5	that information. I haven't sat down with technical
6	people to go through this.
7	Q. Do you have a list of reliance materials that
8	is more inclusive than the list you have given us in
9	this case?
10	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
11	A. Do I have a list? There are --1 have
12	available to me approximately a hundred yards in my
13	office of information, and that is certainly not
14	inclusive here. So that would be one list, but that
15	has not been necessarily entered completely into this
16	system. This must be a system that the Jones Day
17	uses, and so I can't answer that question when you get
18	into that because I've had no access to their
19	documents.
20	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Have you -- well, this Exhibit
21	5 lists 6,628 items; is that correct?
22	A. Yes. I believe so. I think that's the right
23	number. I can look.
24	Q. Do you have a broader list that you called to
25	produce this list?
0110
1	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
2	A. Do I have a broader list? I am not that
3	well --
4	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Yes.
5	A. I'm not that well organized. I have
6	documents all over the place, but I do not have a --
7	well, yes. I mean, I've done work in over a hundred
8	newspapers, but there aren't over a hundred newspapers
9	on this list. Is that -- am I answering your
10	question? I hope I am.
11	Q. Well, my question is: Who prepared this
12	list?
13	A. The list came out of Jones Day based on the
14	discussions that I just explained to you that I had
15	with Noreen Denuzzo about what to include on the list
16	that would be relevant nationally, regionally, and
17	locally that would -- would bear on this case. That's
18	where this list came from based on our discussions.
19	Q. All right. Okay. So then let's look at --
20	let's look at Page 72 of Exhibit 5, entry number 2152.
21	A. Okay. Could you give me the number again,
22	please?
23	Q. 2152.
24	A. "Smoking linked to cancer called only an
25	inference, New York Times, 1963." Okay.
0111
1	Q. Who decided to include Item 2152 on this
2	list?
3	A. I asked that documents reflective of what is
4	being presented in the New York Times be reflected on
5	this list because it is a national -- at least at this
6	time the national newspaper of record. We did not
7	discuss all 6,000 documents in literal detail. We
8	would have been on the phone for years to do that
9	basically or actually days.
10	Q. So this lawyer at Jones Day decided what to
11	put on your list based on your instructions?
12	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
13	A. Well, let me go back and explain again the
14	process because we talked about particular newspapers.
15	I wanted national. I wanted regional, and I wanted
16	local papers. The idea is to establish and to point
17	out that this information is available all over the
18	place. So then I said please include relevant New
19	York Times articles. Now, they're not all going to be
20	on here or we would have a list, maybe, three times
21	that size. Please include papers from Florida to
22	demonstrate that this information was widely available
23	in Florida. Please include information from let's say
24	Illinois, because that information would be widely
25	available in Illinois. Please include articles from
0112
1	Michigan like the Detroit Free Press because, again,
2	that information would be widely available there, but
3	I did not go literally over every single article. Let
4	me give you -- that -- that is the best example I can
5	give you. It's the same with educational materials.
6	There's a lot of Illinois and Michigan education
7	materials here, so -- that I said let's include those
8	materials, and we talk about them generally, and they
9	get included on this list.
10	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Who gathered these materials
11	in the first place?
12	A. Well, probably I gathered a great many of
13	them, if not --1 don't want to say all of them. I
14	can't say that because I've worked with other
15	historians at times, but certainly I go back to my 100
16	yards of documents in my --in my office.
17	Q. Is this in your campus office or in your
18	off-campus office?
19	A. My off-campus office where I try to get work
20	done.
21	Q. Did you see this list of 6,628 items before
22	it was sent to us?
23	A. Yes. I reviewed it with Noreen Denuzzo. We
24	talked about it.
25	Q. When?
0113
1	A. When? Well, probably a week or two before it
2	was generated because we talked about it earlier in
3	the month about what should be included, so I would
4	say something along that particular line. We talked
5	about it, again, generally, specifically what to
6	include. She then generates the list and then I
7	reviewed it and said, well, what about this and this
8	and this, and we finalized the list and that then was
9	produced to you.
10	Q. And when did she send it to you for your
11	review?
12	A. Well, I thought I answered that question. I
13	said two or three weeks ago.
14	Q. I think that's when you talked about having
15	it generated, but -- so she sent you the list two or
16	three weeks ago, and you reviewed it?
17	A. Right.
18	Q. How long did you spend reviewing it?
19	A. Well, we could look at my billable hours but
20	probably a couple, three hours, something like that.
21	Q. So in two to three hours, you were able to
22	review this list of 6,628 --
23	A. I could --
24	Q -- items?
25	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
0114
1	A. -- get through that list pretty quickly
2	because, again, I'm checking to make sure that
3	material which is relevant to the questions that I'd
4	been asked to investigate and review are reflected on
5	this list from a national, a regional, and a local
6	perspective.
7	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Do you know how many items
8	were contained on the --1 assume you generated a
9	similar list for the Reese case, for example; is that
10	correct?
11	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
12	A. I think there's a similar list for every case
13	that I've been involved in, yes. Yes, there was a
14	list for the -- list for the Reese case. That was,
15	what, a year and a half ago, something like that.
16	Yes, there was a list.
17	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) I believe so.
18	A. Yes, there was a list. A reliance list is
19	standard so far as I know in every case that I've been
20	involved in.
21	Q. Do you know how many items were on the list
22	in the Reese case?
23	A. I don't recall from the top of my head, but
24	I'd say probably in the area of 5,000 plus. That
25	would be my guess.
0115
1	Q. Going back to how you as a historian do your
2	work, how do you go about defining the topic that
3	you're going to be researching, whether it's through
4	litigation purposes or more generally just in your
5	other professional work?
6	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
7	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) How do you decide what you're
8	going to look at?
9	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
10	A. In this case, in terms of the litigation, I
11	was asked to investigate two questions. That's what
12	appears in my statement. Those questions being, first
13	of all, what has been known over time about the health
14	risks of smoking, A; and, B, what has been known
15	generally speaking about the matter of is it difficult
16	to quit smoking or that has to do with habit-forming
17	addiction, those kinds of questions. Those are the
18	questions I was asked to investigate in this
19	particular case. I gave you the example of the World
20	War II project I'm involved in. That generated from
21	entirely different circumstances so it really depends,
22	but in this case, I was asked questions to -- to
23	repeat to specifically investigate in those two areas.
24	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Did you start out with a
25	hypothesis that the risks of smoking were widely
0116
1	known?
2	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
3	A. I didn't start with a working hypothesis like
4	that, no, I did not.
5	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) You just started to find out
6	what was out there,?
7	A. What I can tell --
8	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
9	A. What I can tell you is in working in the
10	drinking area, I saw this spill over into the tobacco
11	area, and people were discussing the health risks of
12	smoking, so that was an indication to me that
13	something was going on, but whether that meant there
14	was widespread public awareness or not, I couldn't
15	answer that question at the outset. I was asked to
16	investigate that question.
17	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And was it your work on
18	Drinking In America that informed the sources of
19	information that you would look at for this project?
20	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
21	A. It certainly was one area, yes, but it wasn't
22	necessarily the only area because, I mean, there were
23	other areas that I started to go into that, like, I
24	didn't -- just to give you an example, I suppose, I
25	don't --1 recall doing a lot of work in textbooks
0117
1	that we really decided not to use in Drinking In
2	America, but that's where I got into the notion that
3	there were similar stories with -- related to drinking
4	and smoking in textbooks. If that -- if that helps
5	you understand that process. But then I continued
6	that --1 continued that research.
7	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) So how did you go about -- one
8	of your sources of information was mandatory school
9	health classes, correct?
10	A. Yes. That goes to the legal structure.
11	Q. How did you go about researching that?
12	A. Well, two different ways. I got to know a
13	gentleman by the name of Richard Means. He may be
14	familiar to you. He's now deceased. He was a
15	long-time professor at Auburn University. Richard,
16	during his academic career, was probably the most
17	outstanding historian of education with respect to
18	health issues, whether it be smoking, drinking,
19	whatever. I got to know Richard. Richard has
20	prepared any number of reports, and he shared those
21	reports with me, in terms of what was going on with
22	respect to health education in various states, and
23	then I simply build out from that material.
24	Q. Did you talk to anybody other than him about
25	your research in that area, how to conduct the
0118
1	research?
2	A. Richard and I had a number of conversations,
3	but then I would go -- let's say -- let me give you an
4	example. In Florida, I looked at the legislative
5	records that were available in Tallahassee at the
6	state archives in the state library. In Ohio, I did
7	the same thing with respect to Ohio laws. In
8	Illinois, I did the same thing working in Springfield
9	at various locations, the state archives and state
10	library, so I would build out from the base that
11	Richard provided me with.
12	Q. And I think we've talked about some of your
13	other sources of information. How did you go about
14	researching anti-smoking publications and
15	organizations?
16	A. Well, actually, one of the ways I did it was
17	by contacting the organizations and saying what kind
18	of information were you making available, and through
19	that process, I was able to get some annual reports as
20	an example. Through that same process, I was able to
21	get various kinds of public service announcements that
22	were out there and available. So that was one way
23	that I did that, especially with the American Cancer
24	Society, with the lung association and the heart
25	association. So they did supply various kinds of
0119
1	materials, and then in addition, I was able to go
2	through state records of various kinds. For instance,
3	in Florida, they set up a committee in the early 1960s
4	to deal with tobacco-related issues and providing more
5	information publicly, and so I was able to follow up
6	on that in the state records and find additional
7	information about the kinds of information they were
8	being made available to the schools. For instance,
9	the American Cancer Society put out educational films
10	they distributed all over the country to high schools,
11	and I was able to obtain copies of those educational
12	films, and that would be another kind of source of
13	information I was able to obtain about the -- these
14	kinds of privately-funded health organizations.
15	Q. Okay. I know in some of your prior
16	testimony, you've referred to specific movies as
17	evidence that people knew about the hazards of
18	smoking; is that correct?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. Yes. Insofar as those have to do with
21	popular culture and slang expressions, that sort of
22	thing. That's been --1 have investigated that
23	material, yes.
24	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Do you intend to do that in
25	this case?
0120
1	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
2	A. I would say yes.
3	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) What movies do you intend to
4	refer to?
5	A. Well, there are any number. I have reviewed,
6	I would say 60 to 70, perhaps 80 movies. I'd have to
7	go back again and go through my collection, but I
8	would say probably, would sample probably ten or so
9	would be in that area. You want specific titles,
10	Superman 1. I --1 probably used -- there's a Three
11	Stooges movie from the late '30s, which I think is
12	important to show. The 30 Seconds Over Tokyo would be
13	one that I would think would be important to show
14	about public awareness. There are -- I'm trying to
15	think of the titles. Heaven Knows Mr. Allison would
16	be one. There's one about Damn Yankees that makes
17	references about the slang that is used and then
18	also -- well, it won the academy award in 1953, and it
19	had Frank Sinatra. I'm blanking on the title. He won
20	best supporting actor, so --1 -- it's on the tip of
21	my tongue, but that one, also.
22	Q. Okay.
23	A. And those would be -- not all, but that --
24	that's to give you a general idea. I'll think of the
25	title, and I'll pop into my brain, I'll let you know.
0121
1	Q. Okay. Are you familiar with statistics about
2	the number of smoking incidents per hours in movies
3	over the years?
4	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
5	A. Yes. I've seen some of that material.
6	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Does that influence your --
7	smoking was fairly common in movies, wasn't it?
8	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
9	A. In some movies, yes. I think that's a fair
10	characterization.
11	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Does the fact that smoking was
12	a very common thing to see in movies influence your
13	opinions at all?
14	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
15	A. That it was out there and that people were
16	smoking, I certainly have considered that, but I don't
17	know whether influence is the right word. What I'm
18	particularly interested in is the way smoking is -- is
19	described, and how it is characterized in movies.
20	That has been the focal point, what has been the focal
21	point of my research.
22	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) In many movies, it's shown as
23	a perfectly-acceptable activity?
24	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
25	A. Well, in many movies, people smoke.
0122
1	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And they smoke as part of
2	their daily lives?
3	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
4	A. Well, I suppose that might be the case in
5	many movies.
6	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Doctor, looking at Exhibit 5,
7	would you look at Page 216, next to the last page?
8	A. Oh, that's easy enough to do. Got it.
9	Q. You list on here starting at Item No. 6584
10	and continuing on down, various Fort Lauderdale
11	newspaper articles, various Jacksonville articles,
12	various Miami articles, various Orlando articles. Do
13	you see those references?
14	A. Yes, I do.
15	Q. There's one even further down the page at
16	6603, various television programs?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. When I go to those files on the disks, all it
19	says is various Fort Lauderdale newspapers or various
20	Jacksonville newspapers. What -- what are those --
21	what are they?
22	A. Well, I think these are -- it's an indication
23	there are additional articles beyond those that are
24	specifically identified in this list, and I prefer
25	catch all in case we miss something in the process
0123
1	that might be worth becoming a part of my testimony.
2	Q. Well, Doctor, once again, this is my chance
3	to ask you about your testimony. What's contained in
4	those exhibits?
5	A. Well, I can't --1 can't answer that question
6	for you because I would say that these are simply
7	catch-all categories in case I miss something that I
8	thought might be relevant, but I don't need to because
9	this is an indication, also, where I've been doing
10	research. I guess that's another way for me to put it
11	in various Florida-related newspapers.
12	Q. So you don't intend to refer to anything in
13	those exhibits but just say, various newspapers that
14	don't list anything?
15	A. I would say at this point it would be highly
16	unlikely as we move forward.
17	Q. Does this list include articles in which
18	there are spokes people for the industry saying that
19	the connection between smoking and disease has not
20	been established?
21	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
22	A. There may be some of those included. I
23	certainly have taken them into consideration, and they
24	basically don't change my opinions because there
25	really aren't very many of them if you want me to
0124
1	state that. If you don't want me to state that, but I
2	just did.
3	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Well, did you ask that
4	articles be included in which the industry was
5	contesting a link between cigarettes and disease?
6	A. I've seen some articles along that particular
7	line, and generally speaking, they are few and far
8	between, and they decrease in number over time, but
9	they basically had no impact on public awareness
10	because public awareness just kept going up and up and
11	up and up throughout this particular period so, no, I
12	didn't see any reason to include them.
13	Q. So the fact that the industry may have been
14	getting a contrary message is not relevant to your
15	opinions?
16	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
17	A. I don't --1 don't in any way want to
18	conclude that, that message was not being presented.
19	What my conclusion is that message was absolutely
20	overwhelmed by all the other information that was out
21	there and being made available, and if I can put it
22	this way, that -- and there are polls that demonstrate
23	this, people don't go to the industry for
24	health-related information.
25	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) I'm sorry. They don't do
0125
1	what?
2	A. They don't go to the industry for
3	health-related information.
4	Q. To any industry or the tobacco industry?
5	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
6	A. I said there are polls out there that
7	indicate that people do not go to the industry for
8	health-related information.
9	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And my -
10	A. They go elsewhere.
11	Q. My question to you was: They don't go to the
12	tobacco industry or they don't go to any industry?
13	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
14	A. To the tobacco industry. I thought I said
15	that. I'm sorry if I didn't include the tobacco
16	industry.
17	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) We talked a little bit ago
18	about the federal trade commission efforts to adopt a
19	rule requiring labeling on cigarettes. What was the
20	industry reaction to that proposed rule, if you know?
21	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
22	A. The industry action was that the public --
23	I'm sorry. The Federal Trade Commission had no
24	authority to do so, and apparently that was also the
25	reaction of Congress.
0126
1	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) If in response to the
2	proposed FTC's proposed labeling, the chairman of the
3	board of R. J. Reynolds had said he opposed such a
4	rule, would you have picked that article up in your
5	research?
6	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
7	A. I'm sure I have, yes, but I can't say
8	positively that I've read that particular statement or
9	whether it was in a particular newspaper article. I
10	can't say that because I'd have to really check on
11	that.
12	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Well, if it was, is that
13	something you would have included in your list of
14	reliance materials?
15	A. Well, the key phrase there is if it was. I
16	don't know if it was. If you've got a document you'd
17	like to show me, I'd be glad to look at it.
18	Q. Well, if I could figure out how to show it to
19	you, I would.
20	A. Okay.
21	Q. But I'd ask that you look at a March 25th,
22	1965, article in the Florida Times Union?
23	A. Is that on here? Give me a number. I'll
24	look for it.
25	Q. No. It's not on your list. It's not on your
0127
1	list. That's why I was asking you if you would
2	include such items.
3	A. Well, if I thought that was an impact
4	statement, I would have included the item, but
5	apparently it was ignored because Congress
6	proceeded --
7	Q. How do you get --
8	A. Congress proceeded --
9	Q. How do you get --
10	MS. LAWSON: Let him finish.
11	A. Congress proceeded to mandate warning labels
12	on cigarettes in the beginning of 1966 so apparently
13	that was a no-impact statement.
14	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) How do you decide what's an
15	impact statement and what's not an impact statement?
16	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
17	A. Well, because of what happened. If that had
18	been an -- if Congress had said, oh, no, we don't want
19	warning labels and that's not what Congress did or
20	said then that perhaps would have been an important
21	statement, but as a non-impact statement, it had no
22	affect in terms of the decision to put warning labels
23	on cigarettes which would be warning people about the
24	health risk of smoking since January of 1966.
25	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) So whether something is an
0128
1	impact statement or not is a judgment call in your
2	view?
3	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
4	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) You make that call?
5	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
6	A. It's in the context of everything else that I
7	have been reviewing, including all of these documents,
8	hundreds of documents which make it perfectly clear
9	that the health risks of smoking were generally
10	speaking very well known even before that warning
11	label went on cigarettes.
12	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) All right. Well, let's talk
13	for just a minute about a specific time in 1965. Do
14	you recall that a survey was conducted of Florida
15	doctors to determine their attitudes on smoking?
16	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
17	A. Yes. I believe I've seen that article, as
18	matter of fact. It was published in a Florida journal
19	of some type or kind.
20	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Why don't you look at Page 104
21	of Exhibit 5?
22	A. I'm with you.
23	Q. You see you have four articles listed that
24	appeared in Florida papers on January 5th, 6th, and
25	7th of 1965.
0129
1	A. Got it.
2	Q. And they all appear to be reporting on the
3	results of this survey, correct?
4	A. That's what they appear to be doing.
5	Q. What are the headlines of those four
6	articles?
7	A. "Doctors quit smoking, polls show more
8	doctors quit smoking. Physicians say stay off
9	cigarettes." Is that what you are asking me?
10	Q. Yes.
11	A. "Almost half of Florida's doctors no longer
12	smoke." That's based on that survey that you
13	referenced in the article that appeared in local
14	journal in Florida.
15	Q. Right. So these four papers have reported on
16	that survey, correct?
17	A. Yes. That's correct. That's the four that
18	are listed here.
19	Q. And you read the four headlines, correct?
20	A. Yes. I just read them, I thought.
21	Q. And did any of those articles appear in the
22	Florida Times Union?
23	A. I can't answer that question, whether that
24	was in the Florida Times Union or not.
25	Q. No, no, no. That's not my question.
0130
1	A. Oh.
2	Q. My question is: Did any of the four
3	articles, the headlines in which you just read appear
4	in the Florida Times Union?
5	A. No. These are different newspapers in
6	Florida.
7	Q. Do you know whether an article appeared in
8	the Florida Times Union about this survey?
9	A. I'd have to go back and check my list of
10	Florida Times Union articles, so I can't answer that
11	question.
12	Q. Well, if an article did appear in the Florida
13	Times Union with the headline, "Don't smoke say
14	doctors lighting up," is that a different message than
15	the headlines in the articles of the Palm Beach Post
16	or the Tallahassee Democrat or the Miami Herald or the
17	Tampa Tribute?
18	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
19	A. Could you read that headline again? I didn't
20	quite get it.
21	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) "Don't smoke say doctors
22	lighting up"?
23	MS. LAWSON: Same objection.
24	A. You want me to react to that headline?
25	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) It's different, isn't it, than
0131
1	the headlines in the other four papers? It has a
2	different tone?
3	MS. LAWSON: Same objection.
4	A. That's a judgment call. I would say when
5	doctors say don't smoke in that headline, that is the
6	same thing as saying physicians stay off of cigarettes
7	that it's not a good idea to smoke. That would be
8	what I conclude.
9	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) But it's also an
10	acknowledgment, is it not, that doctors are continuing
11	to smoke?
12	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
13	A. Some doctors did continue to smoke. Yes,
14	they did. That's what the survey showed.
15	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Okay. We've already
16	established that James Sikes was bom in 1948,
17	correct?
18	A. That's correct, yes.
19	Q. And I think we said that he generally
20	probably learned to read around first, second, third
21	grade, correct?
22	A. I can't say for sure, but certainly that's
23	the time period in which people are being taught to
24	read in schools, time frame.
25	Q. So he would have been learning to read, say,
0132
1	in the mid '50s. Can we agree to that?
2	A. Approximately, yes. Uh-huh.
3	Q. If Mr. Sikes could not read until 1955 or so,
4	what's the relevance of the first 40-plus pages of
5	your reliance list?
6	MS. LAWSON: Object to fomi.
7	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) 39 pages of your reliance
8	list. There were more articles that appeared before
9	he could read?
10	MS. LAWSON: Object to fomi.
11	A. The best way for me to answer that is the
12	story didn't begin with Mr. Sikes's birth in 1948.
13	The story is ongoing, moving forward, and there was
14	lots and lots of infomiation out there and available
15	even before he was bom, which is part of the context
16	of understanding how comprehensive this story is in
17	temis of his coverage over time up to the time of
18	Mr. Sikes's birth and then into his life. So it's a
19	contextual matter.
20	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Are you suggesting that at the
21	time that James Sikes was a teenager and when he was
22	starting to smoke, that people were discussing the
23	fact that Christopher Columbus had concerns about
24	tobacco?
25	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
0133
1	A. I'm suggesting that in a general way, when he
2	started to smoke, people were talking about the health
3	risks of smoking. Whether they referred to
4	Christopher Columbus or not, it's probably highly
5	unlikely, but it's part of the overall historical
6	context of understanding this information.
7	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Look for me, please, at Page
8	43 of your reliance list starting at entry No. 1244,
9	which is the beginning of 1956. Do you see that?
10	A. Right here. I got it.
11	Q. Are you suggesting that James Sikes saw the
12	impact of health news on attitudes and behavior in the
13	journalism quarterly?
14	A. Well, let me answer this generally. I think
15	I've indicated previously that I'm not suggesting that
16	any particular document was in James Sikes's hands at
17	any particular point in time, but that this
18	information was out there and generally available and
19	would have been the kind of information that would
20	have been available in the communities in which he
21	lived and to him directly. But whether he read that
22	particular article is highly unlikely.
23	Q. Similarly, is it highly unlikely that he
24	read, "Brand Wine You And Your World 1956"?
25	A. I could say that about most of these
0134
1	documents, yes.
2	Q. The American Cancer Society Annual Report
3	1956, that's listed as no. 1247?
4	A. Well, I doubt if he read that report; he may
5	have seen the ACS films in school.
6	Q. Well, that wasn't my question. My question
7	was whether he read the report?
8	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
9	A. No. But I think I've already answered that
10	for you, that I didn't want -- I'm not arguing. I've
11	never said that he read any of this material. It's
12	part of the overall background of information that is
13	out there and available that smoking is bad for one's
14	health, and it's going to be difficult to quit once
15	you get started. That's the point of this
16	information.
17	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Now, on Page 43 -
18	A. I'm sorry, ma'am? I didn't hear.
19	Q. On Page 43, you list a number of articles
20	that appear in, for example, the Tallahassee Democrat,
21	the Florida Times Union, the Palm Beach Post, the
22	Miami Herald, the Fort Lauderdale News, the
23	Gainesville Daily Sun. Again, you're not suggesting
24	that he read those, are you?
25	A. No. I'm suggesting that information was out
0135
1	there and all over the place including the State of
2	Florida.
3	Q. And he didn't even live in the State of
4	Florida, did he, at that time?
5	A. He lived in Illinois at that point in time.
6	Q. Now, we know that in 1964, he was living in
7	the Canal Zone; is that right?
8	A. Not according to the records that I have. He
9	wasn't -- did not move to the Canal Zone with his
10	family until early 1965.
11	Q. Okay. Then look with me at Page 104 of your
12	reliance materials.
13	A. I'm with you.
14	Q. Certainly you're not suggesting that he saw
15	the Palm Beach Post or the Gainesville Sun or the
16	Lakeland Ledger or the Tampa Tribune or the Washington
17	Post or the St. Petersburg Times while he was living
18	in the Canal Zone, are you?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. Well, to repeat what I just said maybe now
21	many times, this is a demonstration. The information
22	is out there and available in areas like Florida and
23	other parts of the country. That's all I was trying
24	to establish, which goes back to what I originally
25	told you about the compilation of this list.
0136
1	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) What newspapers did James
2	Sikes read in his life?
3	A. I can't say for sure what papers Mr. Sikes
4	read. I can say those papers were available in areas
5	where he lived as part of the general information that
6	was available to him and to others living in areas,
7	whether it be Illinois, Michigan, Florida, which are
8	the three primary residences not counting his military
9	time.
10	Q. Do you know whether he read any newspaper?
11	A. That kind of information is not clear from
12	the record that I've seen.
13	Q. So you don't know if he did read a newspaper,
14	whether he read the whole paper or whether he just
15	read the sports section, do you?
16	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
17	A. I don't -- obviously, I can't say what
18	section of the paper he did read, but certainly I
19	can't go beyond that. I don't --1 don't know.
20	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) What magazines did he read?
21	A. That is, again, perfectly unclear from the
22	record.
23	Q. And you don't know if he did read magazines,
24	what sections of the magazines he read, do you?
25	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
0137
1	A. I can't answer that question, no. I don't
2	know.
3	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Looking at the newspaper and
4	magazine articles that are among the 6,628 entries on
5	Exhibit 5, can you say which of those James Sikes saw?
6	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
7	A. I can't say which he saw, but I can say that
8	information was out there and available everywhere he
9	lived.
10	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And you can't say which ones
11	he read, can you?
12	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
13	A. No. I can't say that because that
14	information is not there in the record. That doesn't
15	mean the information was not out there and available.
16	It was everywhere.
17	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Nor can you say which articles
18	he appreciated or understood?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. I can't say that, but I can say he knew that
21	smoking was a risky behavior, because that does stand
22	out in the records so he had to get that information
23	somewhere.
24	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And you -- well, where did he
25	get that in the record?
0138
1	A. Well, his father warned him very early on
2	about the health risks of smoking and not to believe
3	cigarette advertisements. That's very clear in the
4	record.
5	Q. How old was he when that happened?
6	A. Well, I believe that it happened when he was
7	in Illinois and when he was in the Detroit area so he
8	would have been a teenager primarily.
9	Q. Have you studied smoking initiation practices
10	in the United States?
11	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
12	A. Smoking initiation practices or why people
13	start?
14	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) When people start to smoke.
15	A. I've seen lots of stuff about that.
16	Q. And when do people start to smoke?
17	A. When they start to smoke?
18	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
19	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) What age?
20	A. I suppose I've seen some things would
21	indicate they start when peer pressure takes over
22	sometimes in the teenage years. That's the kind of
23	things I've seen.
24	Q. And do you have children?
25	A. I sure do.
0139
1	Q. Are your children older than teenagers now?
2	A. They sure are.
3	Q. When your children were teenagers, did they
4	always follow what you told them to do?
5	A. I can tell you I have three of the finest
6	daughters who were ever bom into this country in the
7	United States, and generally speaking, they did.
8	Q. Well, then you are very fortunate?
9	A. I agree with you completely.
10	Q. Did you ever have instances in which they did
11	not?
12	A. Oh, I'm sure.
13	MS. LAWSON: Object to fomi.
14	A. I'm sure there were instances when they did
15	not.
16	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Would you agree with me that
17	teenagers often do not do what their parents tell them
18	to do?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to fomi.
20	A. Well, I mean, we're getting in --1 can tell
21	you we're getting into behavioral issues, and I'm not
22	a behavioral expert. I can talk about my daughters,
23	but when you go more generally, it's a little bit
24	beyond my field.
25	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) All right. Again, looking at
0140
1	the newspaper and magazine articles that are among the
2	entries on Exhibit 5, which of those do you believe
3	James Sikes should have seen?
4	MS. LAWSON: Object to fomi.
5	A. Should have seen?
6	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Yes.
7	A. I can't answer that question. I can tell you
8	they were out there and available. That's actually a
9	behavioral question about him. Should have seen or
10	could have seen are two different things.
11	Q. Why are they two different things?
12	MS. LAWSON: Object to fomi.
13	A. Well, could have means that they're out there
14	and available. Should have means that he decided to
15	go look at them, and that --1 can't --1 can't answer
16	the should have part of that question.
17	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Okay. Well, then looking at
18	the magazine and newspaper articles that are among the
19	entries on Exhibit 5, which of those do you believe
20	that Janies Sikes could have seen?
21	MS. LAWSON: Object to fomi.
22	A. Well, there are newspapers in Pensacola.
23	There are newspapers in New Orleans. There are
24	newspapers in Jacksonville. There are newspapers in
25	California. There are newspapers available to him
0141
1	through the Navy. We've talked about the Pacific
2	Stars and Stripes. He could have seen those because
3	they were out there and available, to give you some
4	examples.
5	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Do you think it's likely that
6	he could have seen the Washington Post?
7	A. I would probably say that's highly unlikely,
8	but that's part of the national context.
9	Q. What about the Federal Times Supplement?
10	A. Again that's probably highly unlikely but
11	it's part of the general information that's out there
12	and available?
13	Q. What about the Hollywood Sun Tattler?
14	A. That's actually a Florida newspaper, and --
15	Q. Yep.
16	A. --1 can't say whether he saw that or not.
17	Q. Well, is that something that was probably
18	available to him?
19	A. Well, it was out there and available, and I
20	don't know whether he was ever in that part of -- of
21	Florida. I can't answer that question for you, but I
22	can tell you as part of the general information going
23	back to what I've said repeatedly that I'm trying to
24	get a sense of the national, regional, and local
25	stories that were out there and available.
0142
1	Q. Now, you have included on Exhibit 5 a number
2	of news clips; is that correct?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. Of those news clips that you have listed,
5	which of those do you believe that James Sikes
6	actually saw?
7	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
8	A. Well, I can't tell you which ones he actually
9	saw, but I can say that information -- it's an example
10	of the information being out there and available in a
11	whole variety of different forms, whether it was in
12	written form or whether it was in visual form or
13	various other kinds of forms.
14	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Which of the news clips do you
15	think he could have seen?
16	A. Well, it depends on -- it depends on the
17	location, where he was at a particular point in time.
18	He did come--I'm sorry. Let me rephrase that. He
19	did live in areas that had major television network
20	stations, whether that be the area of St. Louis or the
21	area of Detroit or area of Pensacola, the area of
22	Jacksonville, and other areas where he may have been
23	living, so that these -- these clips appeared on
24	national news programs that would have been viewed in
25	these various areas.
0143
1	Q. And what about public service announcements,
2	which of those that are listed on Exhibit 5 do you
3	think that he actually saw?
4	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
5	A. I can't say that he saw any of them. There
6	is something in the record that he watched television
7	and these public service announcements appeared on
8	television over a period of years.
9	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Now, Mr. Sikes was in the
10	service in 1969; is that correct?
11	A. Well, actually, he was mustered out in
12	January -- early January, '69, and then he went into a
13	reserve program, so he was not -- he was not directly
14	in the service. He was in, I believe, what we would
15	call the retired reserves.
16	Q. Okay. So look at Page 128 of your reliance
17	materials.
18	A. Okay. 128. Okay.
19	Q. This is a date range from September 14th,
20	1968, to October 21st, 1968, correct?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And Mr. Sikes is in the service stationed
23	some place in the Pacific, correct?
24	A. Actually, in '68, his vessel was in San
25	Diego, according to what is available about that --
0144
1	the history of that particular vessel. So he would
2	have been in the San Diego area in 1968.
3	Q. All right. I'll give you that.
4	A. Okay.
5	Q. I'll give you that.
6	A. All right.
7	Q. So he could have seen then, I would think,
8	the Pacific Stars and Stripes, you've got two of those
9	listed at 3874 and 75, correct?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. He might have seen the LA Times, and you've
12	got three of those listed on this page, correct?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. Could he have seen anything else listed on
15	Page 128?
16	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
17	A. Well, I don't know why it's -- wait a minute.
18	The anti-smoking message left by actor Talman, I
19	believe that's a public service announcement. I don't
20	know whether that's in a previous page or not, but he
21	may well have seen that. Whether he read the article
22	or not, he certainly didn't read that article because
23	he wasn't in St. Petersburg, but he may well have seen
24	the Talman public service announcement because that
25	was viewed all over the country.
0145
1	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Okay. In -but just to
2	summarize this, you cannot say that he read or saw or
3	encountered any of the 6628 entries; is that correct?
4	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
5	A. I can't say whether he saw or read, but I can
6	say he encountered this information everywhere he went
7	because it was all over the place.
8	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) I appreciate that, but that's
9	not my question.
10	A. I thought --
11	Q. My question is: Can you say that he saw any
12	one of the 6628 entries on here?
13	MS. LAWSON: Object to fomi.
14	A. I thought you said saw, read, and encountered
15	so if I misunderstood the question I'm sorry about
16	that.
17	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) You're exactly right. I said
18	saw, read, or encountered any one of the 6,628 entries
19	on this exhibit?
20	MS. LAWSON: Object to fomi.
21	A. My response was he encountered that kind of
22	infomiation everywhere he went, but whether he saw or
23	read a particular item on here, I can't say that, and
24	I've said that repeatedly. What I'm saying is the
25	infomiation is out there and widely available to the
0146
1	point of widespread knowledge.
2	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) In RJR's disclosure of your
3	opinions in this case, it says that you're going to
4	testify that the public had a common understanding of
5	the habit-fomiing qualities of smoking; is that
6	correct?
7	A. Yes. That is correct. I've got to find that
8	document, but that's correct.
9	Q. All right.
10	A. I'm sorry. Just a second. Okay. I've got
11	it.
12	Q. Can you put a date on when the public had
13	that common understanding?
14	A. I think putting a --
15	Q. A date range, a year, can you pinpoint when
16	the public had that common understanding?
17	MS. LAWSON: Object to fomi.
18	A. Well, I don't think that's probably a good
19	exercise, because that infomiation is out there and
20	widely available and has been widely available going
21	back four hundred years, so for me to pick out 1962 or
22	something like that is -- there's --1 don't see any
23	purpose in doing that so I'm not going to try to pick
24	a date for you.
25	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Well, is there a time when the
0147
1	public did not have common understanding in your view?
2	MS. LAWSON: Object to fomi.
3	A. Let me repeat. The information was out there
4	and widely available and going back to earliest times
5	in U.S. history, not counting native American history,
6	that infomiation that it was difficult to quit smoking
7	once you started, whether you smoke cigarettes or
8	whether you smoked a pipe or whether you chewed
9	tobacco, whatever it was, that, that was widely known
10	down to our own time.
11	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Just because something is
12	widely publicized, though, does not mean that people
13	believe it and act upon it, does it?
14	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
15	A. Well, I understand there's an awareness
16	factor. There's a belief factor, and there's an
17	understanding factor, and I realize there have been
18	studies of that, but awareness and belief only are
19	going in one direction, and I suppose we can include
20	understanding in the 20th century, and that is up and
21	up and up and up and up.
22	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Are you aware that there have
23	been some studies linking cellphone use to brain
24	cancers?
25	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
0148
1	A. Actually, I've heard about those in
2	depositions so -- but, no, I --1 have not read up on
3	that particular issue.
4	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Have you seen articles in the
5	newspaper about it?
6	A. Oh, I -- I'm not sure I have, but I've --
7	actually, I probably have heard more about it on the
8	24-hour news stations where they don't have anything
9	else to talk about and I might be watching at some odd
10	hour.
11	Q. Well, do -- do you think that the public has
12	come to believe that cellphones cause brain cancer?
13	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
14	A. I don't think the two issues are comparable
15	in any way, shape, or form because there's been a
16	little bit of information about one and there's been
17	an unending, increasingly large body of information
18	about the other, so the two are totally unrelated from
19	my point of view.
20	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Well, that's fine, but that
21	wasn't my question.
22	A. I know, but that was my answer.
23	Q. Well, my question was: Do you believe that
24	people -- in your opinion, have people come to believe
25	that cellphone usage causes brain cancer?
0149
1	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
2	A. I have not formed an opinion on that one way
3	or the other, and it is irrelevant to the information
4	that I have been investigating.
5	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) With due respect, I'm not sure
6	that you're the proper judge of relevance in this
7	case. Now, you will not give me a date, I gather,
8	when you think that the public had a common
9	understanding of the, what you call habit-forming
10	qualities of smoking, correct?
11	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
12	A. I think I said that I didn't think it was a
13	good idea to give a date because that knowledge is
14	increasing and building over time.
15	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Well, and we've already
16	discussed it, but in 19 -- by at least 1994, R. J.
17	Reynolds didn't acknowledge that cigarettes were
18	addictive, did they?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. I think we've been through that. That was
21	what we talked about in terms of what happened in the
22	Waxman hearings in 1994, but in 1845, John Quincy
23	Adams did say that smoking was addicting and it was
24	hard to quit and that information was out there and
25	generally available in the 19th century. It was being
0150
1	taught in school textbooks as early as 1880s and the
2	1890s and the story gets extremely wide coverage
3	throughout the 20th century. That's one reason it's
4	very difficult for me to give you a specific date.
5	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Was it taught in the school
6	textbooks that James Sikes had?
7	A. It was taught in every basic textbook,
8	health-related textbook that was available in the
9	1950s and the 1960s.
10	Q. Was it taught in the textbooks that James
11	Sikes had while he was in school?
12	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
13	A. Well, I think what I -- the best way for me
14	to answer this is I have not yet read a textbook from
15	the 1950s and 1960s that said that smoking was good
16	for your health or that smoking was not habit forming,
17	so every textbook pretty much on that subject says the
18	same thing. So in the textbooks that he would have
19	been reading, they would have said that.
20	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Do you know if James Sikes had
21	health classes in school?
22	A. I know the law required in both Illinois and
23	in Michigan to teach these issues going back to the
24	1880s, as a matter of fact, so I would assume they
25	were doing that in the 1950s and the 1960s.
0151
1	Q. Do you know that James Sikes took a health
2	class in school?
3	A. I know the state required that these subjects
4	be taught. That's what I do know.
5	Q. How much time a week did -- was spent on
6	health class in the schools that James Sikes attended
7	in Michigan?
8	A. How much time? Well, I'd have to go back and
9	check the specific record and what was required at
10	that time, but Michigan was making quite a point in
11	the 1960s about the very effective job they had been
12	doing, were continuing to do to teach students about
13	the health risk of smoking and about the habit-forming
14	qualities of smoking. That, I do know.
15	MS. BRYAN: I have one more relatively
16	discreet area. Let's take a quick break, and go back
17	and get finished.
18	MS. LAWSON: Okay.
19	MS. BRYAN: I think we'll be finished in
20	the next 15, 20 minutes.
21	THE WITNESS: Fine.
22	MS. LAWSON: Sounds all right.
23	(Break.)
24	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) I believe you have open in
25	front of you a document that is numbered AN490?
0152
1	A. Yes. I believe so.
2	Q. Would you tell me what this is, please?
3	A. Well, this is a page from the gallop -- the
4	published gallop polls that these are books that
5	appear in various libraries across the United States.
6	This is likely taken from our collection at the
7	University of Houston.
8	Q. Okay. And what's relevant about AN490 to the
9	opinions that you're going to offer in this case?
10	A. I believe that this is the question about
11	cancer, the government getting involved heavily in
12	cancer research. Well, I think that's very, very
13	relevant because the government was not heavily
14	involved in really much of any medical scientific
15	research in going through the 1940s, so one of the
16	questions is should the government become more heavily
17	involved in solving and trying to find solutions to or
18	cures to diseases such as cancer. That's one element
19	that I think is important. The second element it's
20	because cancer awareness or concern about cancer
21	awareness is an increasing health concern in the
22	middle 20th century. It was growing during the early
23	20th century, but it really becomes very, very
24	important as people start to live longer in this
25	context because contagious diseases, so many of them
0153
1	are now being conquered so people are generally living
2	longer which leads to heart disease and cancer and
3	these kinds of more chronic diseases as opposed to
4	contagious diseases.
5	Q. So how does this document fit with your
6	opinion about smoking and health?
7	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
8	A. Well, if it's because people are concerned
9	about cancer and where cancer is coming from, and that
10	will be a spur, post World War II to much more
11	extensive investigations into the sources of cancer,
12	the causes of cancer.
13	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Okay. Could you look then at
14	AIW214?
15	A. We'll try.
16	MS. LAWSON: I'm sorry. It was AIW
17	what, Leslie?
18	MS. BRYAN: 214.
19	THE WITNESS: Did you find it?
20	MS. LAWSON: I've just got to go up
21	some.
22	A. Okay. We've got her.
23	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Okay. And can you tell me
24	what this is?
25	A. Well, on this page skipping the hearings into
0154
1	cigarette smoking June 30th, did you happen to -- I'm
2	sorry. I'm having a hard time reading it. "Do you
3	happen to smoke cigarettes," and I believe 45 percent
4	says yes. It breaks that down. It breaks it by year.
5	"What in your opinion," -- at the bottom page -- "Do
6	you think cigarette smoking is one of the causes of
7	lung cancer," and 41 percent of the people said yes
8	they think it is. 29 percent said no and 30 percent
9	had not yet made up their mind about that issue.
10	That's the very bottom of that page.
11	Q. Right. When was this done?
12	A. This one was done, if I understand what it's
13	saying here, but I -- by my memory, too, this one was
14	done in late June and early -- no, wait a minute.
15	Wait a minute. Late June and then we went to early
16	July of 19 -- this is the year 1954.
17	Q. When were the interviews conducted?
18	A. They were conducted, I presume, in that
19	month.
20	Q. Well, doesn't it tell you?
21	A. Well, it says interviewing date 6/12 to
22	something here. I can't read. It's pretty small.
23	Survey X whatever it is in Question 412B. That's at
24	the bottom of the page. Interviewing was also done in
25	6/12, the previous one, the June 30th, 6/12 to 17 of
0155
1	'54. And I guess both -- the second one is done at
2	the same time.
3	Q. Part of the same poll, probably, weren't
4	they?
5	A. Yes. Well, for some reason it listed here
6	June 30th and July 2nd, but it's really part of the
7	same poll. That's correct. Yes.
8	Q. Okay. Hold on one second. I'm looking for
9	something, and I knew I should have labeled it better
10	to make it easier to find.
11	A. Okay.
12	Q. Okay. Sorry.
13	A. No problem.
14	Q. Dr. Martin, are you an expert in the conduct
15	of public opinion polls?
16	A. Well, I took a course in graduate school, and
17	that would be one thing about public opinion polling,
18	what it's all about, the way it's done. The polls are
19	open ended, closed ended, all those sorts of things,
20	and I've worked with a number of students doing 20th
21	century work in their graduate program, and I
22	invariably recommend with whatever topic they go to
23	that when public polling started to become available
24	in the 1940s, that is systematic public polling in the
25	1940s and '50s, that they should see whether there are
0156
1	polls that would help them understand their research
2	and their -- would help them formulate their
3	conclusions?
4	Q. Have you ever designed a public opinion poll?
5	A. No. I've never designed one.
6	Q. Have you ever conducted one?
7	A. No.
8	Q. Have you ever supervised one?
9	A. No.
10	Q. For this poll that we're talking about that's
11	reflected in the AIW214, do you know what the sample
12	size was?
13	A. Is it there? I don't see it, so I can't tell
14	you, but I would guess and I'm not going to so I just
15	won't guess. I don't know.
16	Q. Do you know how the survey was conducted,
17	that is, was it telephone interviews, face-to-face
18	interviews? Do you know how it was done?
19	A. I can't say, but I would suspect that it was
20	a telephone-type interview, but I can't say that for
21	sure. I don't know.
22	Q. Do you know what was done to control -- do
23	you recognize that interviewer bias can be a problem
24	in conducting public opinion polls?
25	A. Yes.
0157
1	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
2	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Do you know what was done in
3	connection with this poll to control interview bias?
4	A. No. I don't have that information.
5	Q. What was the response rate on this poll?
6	A. I can't answer that question based on what's
7	here.
8	Q. Isn't response rate important in
9	understanding the validity of a poll?
10	A. Yes, it is.
11	Q. What's the racial breakdown of the
12	respondents to this poll?
13	A. That information is not available on this
14	sheet.
15	Q. What's the economic breakdown of the
16	respondents to this poll?
17	A. Again, that information is not available on
18	this sheet.
19	Q. Isn't that information important in
20	understanding the reliability of the poll that you're
21	saying informs your opinion?
22	MS. LAWSON: Object to fomi.
23	A. What I can tell you about that is the gallop
24	organization has a very good reputation. Certainly
25	Mr. Gallop was considered a pioneer in public opinion
0158
1	polling, and when he was heavily involved, I think
2	there's every reason this polling would be
3	trustworthy. I think that's a very safe conclusion
4	that virtually every historian would agree with.
5	Q. But wouldn't you want to know the details of
6	the poll to look behind and say, yes, that makes
7	sense?
8	MS. LAWSON: Object to fomi.
9	A. Well, I --1 can't answer that question
10	because that infomiation is not available, but I can
11	tell you this kind of infomiation was printed in
12	newspapers across the United States, so it was out
13	there, and it was publicly available.
14	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Well -- but I understand your
15	position on that. I'm just asking you about this
16	poll.
17	A. Right.
18	Q. If this particular poll that's reflected in
19	AIW214 was conducted only in the City of New York and
20	only among affluent people, would that poll be a
21	reliable means of telling what the rest of the country
22	thought?
23	MS. LAWSON: Object to fomi.
24	A. Well, what this poll does is it reflects
25	widespread public awareness about the health risk of
0159
1	smoking so it helps to confimi all the other documents
2	that are out there and publicly available. That's the
3	best answer I can give you.
4	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) I appreciate that, but that's
5	not my question.
6	A. I cannot go into detail because that is not
7	available to me.
8	Q. Have you looked for it?
9	A. I have no reason to distmst the gallop
10	organization in 1954 when it conies to this
11	infomiation.
12	Q. That wasn't my question. Have you looked for
13	it?
14	A. No, I haven't looked for it —
15	MS. LAWSON: Object to fomi.
16	A. -- because I have every reason to tmst the
17	gallop organization as -- accept this as reliable
18	source.
19	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) In addition -- well, do you
20	know how the respondents to this poll were arrayed
21	between urban residents and mral residents?
22	A. I think we've already agreed that infomiation
23	is not here and available.
24	Q. Okay. In addition to the questions about
25	smoking, what other questions were asked as part of
0160
1	this poll, if you know?
2	A. Well, I don't recall specifically. We can
3	turn the page. This is -- if I am not mistaken, this
4	poll also asks whether individuals were following --
5	that may have been a little bit before, a little bit
6	later than this, were actually following the
7	developing story about the Hammond & Horn
8	epidemiological research at the cancer society in
9	which 90 percent said they were following that.
10	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Well, leave aside questions
11	about smoking. Do you know if there were other topics
12	included in this poll?
13	A. I just gave you an example of a topic that I
14	thought was included in this poll or one that was
15	taken right around this time, but what other topics I
16	can't tell you based on this page, no, I can't tell
17	you.
18	Q. Okay. So you don't know whether this poll
19	included four questions about smoking or 25 questions
20	about a variety of subjects, do you?
21	A. Based on what I'm seeing here on this page,
22	there would have been a variety of subjects because
23	the same dates that were given include heart research,
24	party strength it looks like and Congressional
25	investigation. Now whether they were asked of the
0161
1	same group, I can't answer that question, but the
2	polling was taking place at the same time.
3	Q. Well, let's assume that they were asking
4	about heart research and Congressional investigations
5	and party strength. Do you know whether there were
6	any other questions that they asked about in this
7	poll?
8	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
9	A. We can keep turning the page.
10	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) The only thing you've given me
11	as your reliance materials are these two pages, so
12	that's what I'm asking you about. Is there anything
13	else out there that was in this poll?
14	A. I can't answer that question.
15	Q. Dr. Martin, in --1 know that you've never
16	designed a public opinion poll, but is it your
17	understanding that the placement of questions in a
18	public opinion poll matters?
19	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
20	A. Well, there's several things that matter, one
21	of which would be perhaps placement, but there are lot
22	of other things that matter which we've already
23	reviewed actually, such as socioeconomic status and
24	ethnic status and all that sort of thing.
25	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Do you know what the placement
0162
1	was of the cigarette questions in this poll?
2	A. Well, based on the book they must have been
3	up front, but I don't even know whether they were
4	talking to the same groups or not. What I know was a
5	group was asked these questions, and these were the
6	answers that, that group answered.
7	Q. When you say "up front," what do you mean by
8	up front?
9	A. That here this information is there, and the
10	way it's presented in the book is that this is the
11	first -- these are the first questions that were
12	asked, not the last questions that were asked. In
13	addition, with these books, they --
14	Q. Well, doesn't it show that -- go ahead.
15	A. I was just going to say they don't reprint
16	all the questions on even a specific topic so there
17	may have been --
18	Q. Well, doesn't it show that the -- doesn't it
19	show that the question, "Do you happen to smoke
20	cigarettes now," was Question 10B?
21	A. Okay. Fine. So what?
22	Q. I'm sorry. What?
23	A. I said so what, in terms of the questions.
24	Here are the questions that were available. These are
25	the answers that were given.
0163
1	Q. But you also just told me that the placement
2	of the question is important so you don't know what
3	came before this, do you?
4	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
5	A. I --1 think this is a very good poll.
6	Beyond that, there's no reason to continue to discuss
7	it, because it doesn't really have anything to do with
8	the overall subject that I've been asked to evaluate.
9	This is one particular poll, at one particular point
10	in time.
11	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) As an example of other polls,
12	throughout your materials, you've given us just the
13	pages of a poll or results of a poll that pertain to
14	cigarette smoking, correct?
15	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
16	A. Well, I think that would go back to the basis
17	that we started this with that I was asked to consider
18	particular questions with respect to the health risks
19	of smoking and with respect to the addictive qualities
20	of smoking. So for me to present a bunch of other
21	information would seem to be rather beside the point,
22	since I'm trying to focus on certain issues as part of
23	my research and testimony.
24	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) You pointed to the question
25	that says what is your own opinion, do you think
0164
1	cigarette smoking is one of the causes of lung cancer
2	or not, and it gives us the yes, no, undecided that
3	you referenced a few minutes ago.
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. It says 41 percent say yes, 29 percent say
6	no, and 30 percent are undecided, correct?
7	A. That's what it says.
8	Q. Do you know whether there were other options
9	to answer, other than yes, no, and I don't know?
10	A. Well, since those numbers, if I have to do a
11	quick calculation here add up to 100 percent, that
12	would suggest that this is a close-ended question
13	where you have three options, yes, no, or undecided.
14	Q. Well, do you know if -- sometimes public
15	opinion polls will ask you rate from one to five a
16	certain -- your views on a certain issue. Have you
17	experienced that?
18	A. Absolutely, yes.
19	Q. Do you know whether that's how this poll was
20	done or whether it just asked yes, no, or undecided?
21	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
22	A. Well, based on the fact that adds up to a
23	hundred percent it strongly suggests that it's a yes,
24	no, or undecided. It isn't a vote one to five-type
25	question.
0165
1	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Doctor, I want to turn to what
2	I anticipate will be my last area of questions, and
3	that is your billing in this case. Do you know how
4	much you have billed R. J. Reynolds for your time
5	since 1994 for all of your tobacco work?
6	A. No. I don't have a specific number.
7	Q. Would it be possible for you to get that
8	number?
9	A. No. Because I haven't saved all the records.
10	Q. Were you instructed not to save the records?
11	A. I try to follow federal law, and I believe
12	we're required to keep income tax information for, I
13	believe it's seven years.
14	Q. So you could go back seven years and trace
15	the amount of money that you've been paid by R. J.
16	Reynolds or its lawyers?
17	A. If you want I can give you an estimate.
18	MS. LAWSON: Object to form.
19	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Okay. What's your estimate?
20	A. Well, let's see, seven years, probably 80 to
21	a hundred--I'm just calculating. Oh, I'd say
22	800,000. That's a guesstimate.
23	Q. Now, in this case, I received yesterday your
24	invoices?
25	MS. BRYAN: Christine, do you have those
0166
1	available?
2	MS. LAWSON: I do.
3	MS. BRYAN: Could we mark those as
4	Exhibit 6, please.
5	MS. LAWSON: Yep.
6	(Exhibit No. 6 was marked.)
7	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) I totaled these up in my
8	head, which is totally inaccurate, but I got a total
9	billing of about $30,000, $31,000; is that about
10	right?
11	A. I haven't totaled it up, so I don't know.
12	That may be right. I'll accept it as a ballpark
13	figure. Fine.
14	Q. Okay. And that's how much you have charged
15	Reynolds in this case, correct?
16	A. If we accept it as a ballpark figure, it
17	would be something like that.
18	Q. All right. And the most recent time entry I
19	have for you was on the 28th of July, I believe.
20	Wait. Let me see.
21	A. That —that is —
22	Q. The 30th of July.
23	A. No, no. It's the 30th.
24	Q. These bills are very current except -- was
25	that right?
0167
1	A. Except for yesterday and today, yes, because
2	what is today, August 2nd.
3	Q. Right. And yesterday -- who did you meet
4	with yesterday before your deposition?
5	A. I met with Christine Lawson, with Jennifer
6	and also with attorney by the name of Don McFadden.
7	Don McFadden out of the Jones Day office.
8	Q. Okay. How much time did you-all spend
9	together yesterday?
10	A. Probably counting lunch, five hours estimate.
11	Q. Well, see, we'll be shorter today. What work
12	do you anticipate doing between now and trial?
13	A. Actually, in terms of preparation would be to
14	look into actually coming up with demonstratives. I
15	think that would be necessary to do. I don't think
16	there's any additional research that would be
17	necessary at this point in time if that answers your
18	question.
19	Q. That -- that does answer my question. Let me
20	just look over my notes. I think we may be done.
21	A. Sure.
22	THE REPORTER: Did you want to go off
23	the record?
24	MS. BRYAN: Yeah. We can go off the
25	record.
0168
1	(Break.)
2	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Dr. Martin, I have one very
3	brief area to cover with you. In conducting your
4	historical research, have you come to understand the
5	reading level at which newspapers are aimed?
6	MS. LAWSON: Object to fomi.
7	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) Education level at which
8	they're aimed?
9	MS. LAWSON: Object to fomi.
10	A. Well, yes, I have because that's an issue
11	actually even in academic writing, what is the level
12	of the audience, so I have some --1 have some
13	experience in that area writing at different levels.
14	Q. (BY MS. BRYAN) And what's your understanding,
15	for example, of the level to which a paper like the
16	New York Times or the Washington Post might be geared?
17	A. Pretty much high school.
18	Q. And what about the Miami Herald?
19	A. Pretty much at that level, as I've read it.
20	Q. What about the Florida Times Union?
21	A. Perhaps not quite as high. That might be
22	more of the -- kind of the eighth grade, freshman
23	level. I'm giving you my personal evaluation because
24	based -- based on my reading of those papers and how
25	the stories flow and the length of paragraphs and the
0169
1	level of vocabulary, that sort of thing.
2	Q. What about magazines like Time or Newsweek?
3	A. They're probably, I'd say, low high school
4	would be my guess with Time and Newsweek at that -- at
5	that level in that -- in that zone.
6	MS. BRYAN: Okay. Thank you very much,
7	Dr. Martin. I do not have any other questions.
8	THE WITNESS: Okay. Good speaking with
9	you.
10	MS. BRYAN: Thank you.
11	MS. LAWSON: I think we're done.
12	(The deposition concluded at 1:53 p.m.)
13	(According to Federal Rule 30(e)(1)
14	Deponent or party must request read and
15	sign before the deposition is completed.
