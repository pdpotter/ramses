1BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
Q. Good morning.
A. Good morning.
Q. I apologize for the confusion. We are still looking for the culprit, but I'll get back to you on the official file.
A. I'm sure you will.
MR. PIUZE: Ms. Reporter, thank you for coming out of your way to come here and bail us out.
Q. Tell me your name, please.
A. My name is Peter Calvin English.
Q. Your occupation?
A. I have two occupations. I'm a medical historian, and I'm a primary care pediatrician.
Q. What's a medical historian?
A. A medical historian is a group of people who are a subset of the history profession and the medical profession both. We
study the history of ideas, the history of public health, history of medical technologies institutions. A whole host of things that
come together to describe medicine in the modern world.
Q. Are all medical historians doctors?
A. No. Actually, only a small proportion of medical historians are physicians, and smaller still are practicing physicians.
Q. In round numbers, what percentage of medical historians are doctors?
A. Oh, I would say 5 percent maybe.
Q. How many medical historians are there in this country?
A. It's -- I would say probably there are a hundred, 150 people with jobs in medical history and universities in this country,
but I -- that's a number I'm not quite very precise on.
Q. Are there any jobs in medical history outside of universities in this country?
A. Well, if -- what we do is research and teach in medical history. So almost all of those would be in universities. There are
people who from time to time move in and out of practice and other places. But to be a medical historian is largely a university-
based operation.
Q. Appreciating the import of your answer, when people who are typically in a university for one reason or another aren't, what
are those medical historians doing at that time?
A. They could be independent scholars working on -- working on research projects that they just currently, you know, are not
teaching. Or if they aer physicians, they could be practicing medicine.

2BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
Q. Have you ever been on an independent research project where you weren't teaching --
A. No.
Q. -- and you weren't at a university?
A. No.
Q. To the best of your knowledge, have any medical historians been on independent projects outside of the university where
they are hired by the tobacco industry or one of its subsets in order to do medical history?
A. I can't answer that. I don't know.
Q. You don't know of any?
A. I don't know of any.
Q. Do medical historians have some sort of umbrella group?
A. Yes. Well, in this country the American Association for the History of Medicine is an organization that most of us belong to.
Q. Okay. What's the name of the person at Washington University in St. Louis who is a well-known medical historian?
A. Ken Ludmerer.
Q. Okay. Do you know him?
A. Uh-huh. Yes, I do.
Q. How do you know him?
A. I've known Dr. Ludmerer for probably 20, 25 years as a medical history -- we are roughly the same age. He trained -- did
his history training at Johns Hopkins, and I did mine at Duke. I think he may be a year or two older than I am.
Q. How did you run into each other initially?
A. At meetings of the American Association for the History of Medicine.
Q. Where is that organization headquartered nowadays?
A. It isn't. It doesn't have a specific site. We just had an annual meeting which is -- which was in Kansas City last weekend.
Q. How come Kansas City?
A. It's rotated. It's been in Durham two times in the last 75 years. I think it's been in Kansas City once before. It moves around.
It's been in Los Angeles.
Q. Does it follow board members or officers of the organization?

3BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. No. It follows invitations from local universities and groups.
Q. What group was it in Kansas City that put it together this time?
A. It was -- they have a department of the history and philosophy in medicine in the medical school there, and I believe a local
medical group did -- also joined in the sponsorship.
Q. Is the local medical school in Kansas City?
A. Yes.
Q. What school is that?
A. It's the University of Kansas Medical School.
Q. Okay. There's a river, I'm told, called the Kaw that runs through that city. On one side is Kansas; on one side is Missouri.
So you are talking about the University of Kansas; right?
A. Kansas.
Q. Have you ever been hired by Shook, Hardy & Bacon?
A. I -- I gave testimony in a Blue Cross case in the past year in Brooklyn. And Shook, Hardy represented one of the tobacco
companies that was -- that hired me.
Q. Who hired you for that case?
A. Arnold & Porter in Washington.
Q. Directly?
A. Directly.
Q. On whose behalf?
A. On which attorney?
Q. No. Arnold & Porter as the attorneys.
A. Which client.
Q. The attorneys for whom?
A. Oh, Philip Morris.
Q. Have you ever looked at the testimony you gave in Brooklyn in written form?
A. No, I have not.

4BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
Q. Did you get to say what you wanted?
A. I did.
Q. I'll tell you what I mean by that. Sometimes lawyers have this great stuff they want to tell the jury, but the judge is there
and doesn't let him do it. The jury doesn't hear some of the great stuff that lawyers want to tell the jury. Did you say everything
you wanted to say?
A. There was a time or two that Judge Weinstein wouldn't permit me to say a few things, but usually that had to do with a
document that I knew there was a -- something else in another paragraph than the one I was being shown. I can't remember the
details, but it was usually in that nature. And Judge Weinstein reminded me that I might have another opportunity at a different
point in the trial to get my point across.
Q. Okay. I don't mean to dissect your testimony under a microscope. So let's just say did you feel you were able to communicate
95 percent of your ideas that you wanted to communicate to the jury?
A. I think so.
Q. Who was the first person in the history of the world who ever approached you on behalf of the tobacco industry?
A. Murray Garnick.
Q. And that person works for Arnold & Porter?
A. Arnold & Porter, yes.
Q. In D.C.?
A. In D.C., yes.
Q. When was that?
A. 1988.
Q. How did that happen? He called you?
A. He called me and asked for a meeting, and he came to my office at Duke and explained what he was interested in.
Q. What was he interested in?
A. He was interested in a medical historian looking at the --
Q. See, if you follow this trail over here, I'm going to get you over in my camp.
A. He was interested in a medical historian doing the history of smoking and health up until and including the first Surgeon
General's report in 1964.
Q. Okay. Did he tell why you?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
5BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. He was involved in defending Philip Morris. Then he was interested in -- you know, at some point whether I would -- you
know, after I've done my research, whether I would be willing to testify in that -- in those cases.
Q. Was there any discussion about why you are going to cut off in 1964?
A. It was -- it was just that -- I mean, from my point of view, that was a logical place to stop in that this was all prior to 1964
because of the Surgeon General's report.
Q. Was it your idea to stop in '64 or his?
A. Initially it was his. It was -- that's what he asked me to do.
Q. Okay. So let me just do this and run through it again. Was there any discussion about why '64?
A. Just that that was the time when, you know, the public health community came together and issued the first report.
Q. Where were you in '64?
A. I was a junior in high school.
Q. Where?
A. In Mountain Lakes, New Jersey.
Q. Is that in Northern Jersey?
A. Northern Jersey. It's in Morristown.
Q. Right. I mean, not I agree with your geography, but I recognize Morristown. That's a very upscale town, isn't it?
A. Morristown is. I believe was then.
Q. Were you smoking then?
A. I was not.
Q. Have you ever smoked?
A. I've never smoked a cigarette.
Q. Do you have brothers and sisters?
A. I do. I have three sisters, one older and two younger.
Q. Did they smoke?
A. They all have smoked at one point or another. None is smoking now.

6BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
Q. When is the last time any one of them smoked?
A. My youngest sister stopped about a year ago.
Q. How old is she?
A. She would be 46 or -7.
Q. When did she start?
A. When did she start?
Q. Yeah.
A. She's seven years younger. And so I'm trying to think. She wasn't -- when I left college, she wasn't smoking, but I would
say sometime in high school.
Q. And to your knowledge, how much did she smoke?
A. Probably about, you know -- I'm not 100 percent sure. When I would ask her, she would say, you know, less than half a pack
a day. But, you know, people tell physicians often what they want to hear. So I'm not sure how much she actually smoked.
Q. You took that with a grain of salt?
A. I knew it couldn't be more than probably twice that because I would -- I would probably observe that at family gatherings,
but I -- I thought she might have underestimated it.
Q. You gave it a margin?
A. I did.
Q. Okay. Did you counsel her over the years about the fact that smoking cigarettes is not good for a person?
A. Of course.
Q. What did she say?
A. She agreed.
Q. What else did she say?
A. That -- it was usually a fairly short conversation.
Q. Did she seem to be a reluctant participant in the conversation?
A. She knew it was going to be part of every time we met.
MR. ROSENTHAL: That's what you get for having a doctor in the family.

7BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: Is that yes, she seemed to be reluctant?
A. I think that's probably fair.
Q. Did you ever discuss with her whether or not she was addicted?
A. She would often -- she would say that.
Q. Did you believe her?
A. I suspect she was.
Q. Why did she stop, according to what she told you?
A. I think she just decided to stop. You know, she never gave a special reason. I mean, there may have been an event. I don't
know. I mean, I think sometimes -- you know, I've watched this over the years, and it's -- there's often a -- there's often a spark,
you know, why people who can go and then all of a sudden stop on a dime. And I'm not always sure I understand exactly
that. And there may have been something like that in her that I don't know about. But all I know is that she stopped, and she's
quite proud of it.
Q. Well, next time you see her, tell her that this strange guy in Los Angeles salutes her for it.
A. I salute her, too.
Q. Been there. Done it.
A. How long did you smoke?
Q. Oh, about 55 pack years.
A. Uh-huh.
Q. But the good news is that that ended 21 years ago.
A. Good.
Q. So I might be standing here for another year or two, you know.
A. There's a good chance.
Q. What brand did she smoke?
A. My sister? I don't know.
Q. Okay. Is she the only one of the sisters who smoked?
A. No. I said they all smoked.
Q. Oh, they all did.

8BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. They all did. You asked the one -- I thought you asked the one who was most recently stopped or something.
Q. You are right. I did. How recently did the next most recent stop?
A. I'm going to -- I'm going to say probably 15 years ago.
Q. Okay. How about your parents? Do they smoke?
A. My parents tell the story that neither one of them smoked. But when they started dating, they thought each one expected the
other to smoke. And so they smoked on their initial two or three dates and then confessed to each other that they didn't and then
stopped. And that would be in -- I believe my parents met in 1937, '38.
Q. Where did you go to school, to college and med school?
A. Duke. I have three degrees from Duke.
Q. What year did you go to Duke?
A. 1965.
Q. Have you been there ever since?
A. I -- after finishing my -- my formal education in three degrees, I went to Cornell New York Hospital in New York City for
the first part of my pediatric training and then came back for the third year of my pediatric residency at Duke and stayed on the
faculty. And I've been there since with the exception of a sabbatical year that I spent in London.
Q. Doing what, please, in London?
A. In London I researched a book on the history of rheumatic fever and finished writing it.
Q. Do pediatricians take care of people up to the age of 18?
A. 22.
Q. 22? How often do you find yourself taking care of patients who are over 15? What percentage of your time would you
say as a doctor?
A. Over 5-0?
Q. No. Over 1-5.
MR. ROSENTHAL: 15.
THE DEPONENT: Oh, over 15. Spherion Deposition Services (800) 722-1235
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: Yes.
A. I would say probably 20 percent of my patients would be over 15.

9BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
Q. Do any of them smoke?
A. Yes, they do.
Q. Is that something you are sure to ask them?
A. I start talking to patients about smoking -- I mean, patients themselves when they are four and five. And I talk to their parents
as early as prenatal visits, and especially -- and if I find out that they are smokers, I talk to them about smoking obviously in
the presence of the baby and in the toddler all the way through -- I make it a point of mentioning it to kids on their kindergarten
visits and then every year thereafter.
Q. And you tell the expectant mother not to allow the child to smoke in the womb; right?
A. I tell them not to smoke.
Q. Does the smoke get through the permeable membranes to the fetus?
A. I don't know if the smoke does, but some of the constituents of the smoke do.
Q. Okay. What do you tell kids when you start talking to them and they are four or five years old, however old they are? What
do you tell them about smoking?
A. I think I have a slightly different approach. I ask them to tell me.
Q. Right.
A. And it's interesting that all of -- I have yet to come up to the kindergarten children -- I usually ask them the question,
something like, “What can you tell me about cigarettes?” And the universal response is bad. It's sort of an -- it's -- which I find
extraordinary that they've heard already even in a part of the country where smoking is more prevalent than it is in California.
But I -- I tell them all the way through that -- I'm very clear in my view that smoking is a very harmful behavior to take up.
Q. When you say it's a part of the country where smoking is even more prevalent in California, I'm not quite sure what you
mean by the “even.”
A. Well, what I'm saying is that we are in a part of the country where a lot -- where more people smoke than in California. And
so there might be more approval of smoking in North Carolina than there is in California. But even -- even with that background,
kids know that it's not a good idea to smoke even at four and five years of age.
Q. Because of the fact that tobacco is -- tobacco is grown in North Carolina?
A. Yes, it is.
Q. And there are manufacturing plants in North Carolina for tobacco products, aren't they?
A. Increasingly fewer, but there are some, I believe.
Q. Still plants in Durham, for instance?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
10BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. I don't believe there are any cigarettes made in Durham. I think most of the tobacco plants have been turned over into stores
and shops and condos, but Durham used to be a leading manufacturer of cigarettes in the world.
Q. Because North Carolina's economy is somewhat dependent on tobacco products; is that a fair statement?
A. I think that's a fair statement.
Q. You know just from being a citizen there and being a smart guy that tobacco is more tolerated in North Carolina than you
would imagine it is in California?
A. I can't give you numbers on -- on, you know, whether it's tolerated. What I tried to mention was that there are more smokers
in North Carolina --
MR. ROSENTHAL: I'm also going to object to the form of the question.
THE DEPONENT: -- than there is in California. Most restaurants we can't -- people can't smoke at. Most workplaces people
can't smoke at, you know, I mean, as far as, you know, public controls over tobacco. But what I meant was that I don't know
whether it's more tolerated, but there's certainly more smokers.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: Okay. Do you know how many smokers there are statistically or otherwise in North Carolina?
A. I think it's about 27 percent. So the national average, I believe, is somewhere now around So, you know, it's a few more.
It's not -- it's not the state that has the most smokers by any means.
Q. What is?
A. You know, I suspect it's Alaska or West Virginia, but I'm not 100 percent sure. But that would be my -- if I had to guess,
for me to guess, those would be my guess.
Q. Okay.
A. And that's about 31, I think.
Q. Thank you. I'm not exactly sure I understood an answer you gave, and the answer is in jeopardy for the real world anyway
because there was an objection which may or may not have been any good. Are you saying that nowadays in North Carolina
you cannot smoke in restaurants?
A. I think it's local option, and I know it can't be done in the parts of North Carolina where I live. I'm not sure if it's a state
provision.
Q. Okay. Where you live, is that sometimes called a triangle?
A. Yes.
Q. Golden triangle?
A. Not golden. Research triangle.
Q. Research triangle. And what counties are included in there?

11BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. Durham is where Duke is. Wake County is where Raleigh is, and that's the State capital. And Orange County is where the
university of North Carolina Chapel Hill is.
Q. Okay. And to the best of your knowledge, spending time in those areas, all three of those counties, do not permit smoking
in restaurants?
A. Yes. As far as I know, yeah.
Q. Okay. And is the same true of public buildings? No smoking in public buildings?
A. As far as I know.
Q. What about private office -- would this be considered a public building, my office building here?
MR. ROSENTHAL: To the extent you know.
THE DEPONENT: I don't -- I don't know.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: Okay. The way you were using it -- and let's just bust it up in two. In governmental buildings, you think
there's no smoking in those three counties?
A. Yes. I think that's --
Q. What about in private office buildings such as this?
A. I don't know.
Q. Okay. What about at Duke University? Where does smoking lie there?
A. I believe students can smoke in their dorm rooms in some dorms.
Q. Classrooms?
A. No. Not for about 15 years.
Q. Eating halls?
A. No.
Q. Cafeterias?
A. No.
Q. Public commons?
A. No.
Q. No? And not at the sports complexes either?

12BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. No.
Q. Okay. Now, because of the way you defined kids -- a pediatrician treats patients up to the age of such and such -- and because
of how old people are when they start college, do you treat college students there on campus?
MR. ROSENTHAL: First of all, I'm not sure he defined kids as people up to the age of 22. I think he said he treated people up
to the age of 22. There's a difference between what's a child and what a pediatrician covers. So I'd object to that characterization
of his testimony.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: Do you treat the students at Duke?
A. Only if they are my preexisting patients. In other words, I do not see patients as part of student health or the student infirmary.
Q. That's what I meant.
A. Yeah.
Q. So if someone had been your patient before they got accepted there, you might treat them in that regard?
A. Right.
Q. Are you involved in any way, shape, or form with public information campaigns at Duke aimed at the students of Duke
to tell them about tobacco?
A. No.
Q. Is there such a program?
A. There is -- it's part of student health. There's something called “the healthy devil,” and smoking is part of that educational
program.
Q. Is the healthy devil a creation of Ellen Merlo? I just wanted to see how closely counsel read the transcript of the last trial.
That's all. Do you know who Ellen Merlo is?
A. No. I sure don't.
Q. The devil is what? Is that the mascot at Duke?
A. Yes. The blue devil is the Duke's mascot. So that's what the term is from, I believe.
Q. And --
MR. ROSENTHAL: He's making a joke.
THE DEPONENT: Oh, okay.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: Healthy devil, meaning don't smoke. Don't drink. Don't do bad things to your body?

13BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. Yeah. It's probably that, or at least be informed before making your decisions is probably a way that they approached college
kids.
Q. Okay. That would include be careful of drugs, be careful of unprotected sex?
A. Yes.
Q. Things of those natures?
A. Yes.
Q. So back to Mr. Garnick. Did he give you any parameters of any kind for your research?
A. He gave me free rein to use my usual historical tools to look at the period of smoking and health, lung cancer before 1964.
Q. Before he engaged you, what other studies had you done having to do with public health?
A. Well, I teach the history of public health.
Q. Yes.
A. And of course, you know, I had taught on smoking and health in every course that I had -- I had taught at Duke -- at least
every course that I've taught that dealt with 20th century health issues I had done. I have written -- are you asking about fields
outside of this whole area?
Q. I was, but let's stay there for a second.
A. Okay.
Q. I'll just interrupt where I was going. When you have taught the history of smoking and health, is that the kind of thing you've
been teaching to doctors or premed students or just the general student population?
A. I teach it to undergraduate students, many of who are premed graduate students in the history department and also to med
students.
Q. Have you ever authored anything having to do with the history of smoking --
A. No.
Q. -- and health? When you've taught the history of smoking and health, what books are papers or written materials have you
told the students to read?
A. It's usually I lecture, and I also have them from time to time use the various Surgeon General's reports as primary source
materials.
Q. Has anyone written about the history of smoking and health?
A. There have been a few people who have written on that.

14BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
Q. Could you inform me of who and what?
MR. ROSENTHAL: To the best of your recollection.
THE DEPONENT: Well, Alan Brandt has written on some of that. David Kessler, the former Food and Drug Administration
commissioner, has written some on that.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: Who is Brandt?
A. Alan Brandt, he's a historian of medicine at Harvard.
Q. How does he spell his last name?
A. B-r-a-n-d-t.
Q. Can you think of anything else he's written?
A. There are others. I can't, as I sit here this morning, think of any.
Q. Recently there was a guy sitting in your seat who was a historian. Not a medical historian but a historian. And he told me
that as part of what he was doing, he read what he called some secondary sources.
A. Uh-huh.
Q. And one of them included “Ashes to Ashes.” Have you ever read that by chance?
A. There are actually two “Ashes to Ashes.” One was put together as part of the 20th century health program at the University
College of London. And I have read that one, and I have looked at the one that was put together in this country, but it's been
a while since I've seen it.
Q. Do you know who wrote the one in this country?
A. I can't recall.
Q. Okay. What about “Civil Warriors”? Have you ever read that?
A. I haven't read that.
Q. Are there any other books that you consider to be secondary sources that you've read having to do with smoking and health?
MR. ROSENTHAL: To the best of your recollection.
THE DEPONENT: I mean, there are some. I can't recall any at the moment.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: Okay. Do you have a CV?
A. I do.
Q. Do you have one with you?

15BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. No, I don't.
Q. Okay. I assume you've published stuff?
A. I have.
Q. On what topics, please?
A. I have three books. One is on the history of surgery. One is on the history of rheumatic fever. One is on the history of childhood
lead poisoning. I've written also on a number of articles on the history of child abuse. I've written on pneumonia, diphtheria.
Q. Are you involved in any kind of litigation that in any way deals with lead poisoning?
A. I am.
Q. In what way?
A. I've been retained by lawyers defending lead pigment makers.
Q. What's the issue?
A. The legal issue?
Q. Well, what's the issue that they want you to address?
A. Oh, the history of childhood lead poisoning and the public health community's response.
Q. When were you engaged to do that?
A. 1996.
Q. Have you testified yet in any of those cases?
A. I've given a deposition once, and I have not testified in any cases.
Q. Can you tell me about that deposition, where, when, the name of the case, that kind of stuff?
A. It was -- the name of the case was the Alvin Wright case. The deposition took place in New York City.
Q. And that would be Wright with a “W”?
A. W-r-i-g-h-t.
Q. Who are the attorneys who sponsored you there at the deposition? Do you know?
A. There were a number of -- of attorneys who sponsored me. Do you want the names of the attorneys?
Q. Firms would be better, or the firm would be better.

16BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. Arnold & Porter.
Q. I've heard of them. What about the person taking your deposition? What was that person's name? Do you remember?
A. I don't remember.
Q. Name of the firm?
A. I don't remember.
Q. Okay. How long ago was that again?
A. I'm going to say that was also in '96.
Q. Mr. Garnick has nothing to do with that?
A. No. He wasn't present there, no.
Q. How many times have you given testimony in tobacco cases?
A. Once.
Q. Were you deposed in that Blue Cross case before you testified in court?
A. Yes, I was.
Q. Who took your deposition?
A. Vince -- what's his last name?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Fitzpatrick.
THE DEPONENT: Fitzpatrick. Sorry.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: Do you know the name of that law firm?
A. Dewey Ballentyne.
Q. That's the anomalous situation of these two mastodon law firms going at each other; right?
Do you know the result of that case?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. Wasn't the result that the legal fees awarded by the judge were twice as much as the verdict?
A. That could be. That could be.

17BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
MR. ROSENTHAL: More than twice, actually.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: Funny. Isn't that interesting.
Okay. I bet they had a bigger conference room to take your deposition, didn't they, Dewey Ballentyne?
A. You know what? It might have been. The chairs weren't as comfortable.
Q. That means they are smarter than me.
A. There were certainly more people present.
Q. Yeah.
How long did it take you to complete your assignment for Mr. Garnick, the original --
A. The original assignment?
Q. Yes.
A. I worked with Mr. Garnick for about two years, and at that point I completed the work on pre 1964.
Q. Did you write a report for them?
A. No.
Q. Did you write a report for yourself?
A. No.
Q. Did you keep notes for yourself?
A. No. My -- my way of keeping notes is I write and underline on articles, and that's how I take care of -- that's how I handle
my notes.
Q. So where are the articles?
A. In my office.
Q. How many?
A. How many offices?
Q. Articles.
A. Articles. I have no idea. Two file cabinets, two and a half file cabinets.
Q. How much time did you spend on that first research project?

18BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. You know, I -- I don't remember. Several hundreds of hours.
Q. What did you bill for the first research project?
A. I -- I don't -- I don't remember. I remember my hourly rate was $250 an hour in 1988, and I probably billed in excess of
$100,000.
Q. So what's that? 400 hours?
A. That would probably be right.
Q. How many times did you meet with Mr. Garnick during that time, approximately?
A. Boy, I don't know. 15.
Q. Where?
A. It varied. He would sometimes come to Duke, and we would meet in my office. And sometimes I would go to Washington,
D.C. and give a presentation.
Q. To?
A. To a group of attorneys.
Q. When he came to Duke, did he come alone?
A. As far as I remember, he always came alone.
Q. Okay. And how many times do you think that was that he came down to see you at Duke?
A. I would say probably half the meetings we had together were in Durham, and the other half were in D.C.
Q. What was his role?
MR. ROSENTHAL: To the extent you know.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: Yeah.
A. His role with me or his role --
Q. Yeah, with you.
A. We discussed what I was finding in my research.
Q. Did he ever tell you that he was having similar discussions with other persons?
A. Yeah. I don't recall whether he did or not. It wouldn't surprise me if he did.
Q. Okay. Did he ever give you hints like, “Why don't you look here,” or, “Have you read such and such”?

19BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. My normal practice was that I read materials that I had located. But along the way, sure, he would say, you know, “Have
you looked at this or that?” and, you know, in the normal course of our interaction.
Q. Although he didn't probably know as much about you as the history of medicine, you came to the conclusion he knew quite
a bit about the history of medicine as it applied to smoking and health issues; right?
A. It was pretty -- as I recall, at that point he was very knowledgeable.
Q. Now, Dr. Ludmerer -- do you know if he has been involved in litigation cases for Philip Morris?
A. I believe he has, yes.
Q. What's the source of that information?
A. I think just discussing with Arnold & Porter lawyers, and I had an -- an occasional just acknowledgment of -- with Dr.
Ludmerer himself.
Q. And what form or shape or words would that acknowledgment take?
A. Just like that, you know. “I hear you've testified for them. We've never really discussed the substance of what your testimony
is.”
Q. Okay. Are there any other medical historians with whom you have spoken, however briefly, who you believe are involved
in the history of medicine, subcategory smoking for the tobacco industry?
A. I don't know. I personally do not know of any others.
Q. Okay. When you completed your first project for Mr. Garnick, were you at that time without tobacco industry projects, or
had another one commenced before the initial one finished?
A. No. That was it.
Q. Then what was your next contact with the tobacco industry, please?
A. That would have been a little over -- about two years ago. Maybe a little bit more than two years ago. And Mr. Garnick
contacted me again.
Q. So there was roughly a ten-year break?
A. Yes.
Q. And what did Mr. Garnick have to say for himself this time?
A. He was interested in me, one, dusting off the pre-1964, and then to do new work which was to look ahead and to do historical
analysis of what the public health community's response to knowledge about smoking and health after the Surgeon General's
report in 1964.
Q. Is that the only tobacco industry project you've worked on in the last three years?

20BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. Well, it's a big project because the public health community is so large and so inclusive, but that's the -- that's the main
work I've been doing with them.
Q. Okay. Well, because of the way you answered it, including the word “main,” I've got to ask what other work are you doing
with them?
A. That is the work. I didn't mean to put ambiguity there.
Q. What's the public health community?
A. The public health community are those groups that form -- come together to make pronouncements, to make
recommendations about the public's health. And the public health being, you know, groups of citizens as opposed to, let's say,
personal health and as opposed to species health which might be dealing with environmental issues.
But it makes -- generally makes recommendations for large groups of populations.
Q. Your next or second-from-last answer alluded to the fact that the public health community is multifaceted, I think would
be a good term.
A. Yes.
Q. Tell me about that.
A. Well, it includes -- let's take specifically the issue of smoking and health. It includes governments at the federal, state and
local levels. It includes organizations such as the American Cancer Society, the Heart Association, the Lung Association, the
Public Health Association which of course all have federal -- national, state and local parts.
I include the media as part of that because the media has been one of the major instruments where public information has gone
forth. If we look -- I also think insurance companies are part of that also. Employers can be part of -- there's been cases -- in
smoking and health, many, many groups that have taken part in the public health response to the dangers of smoking.
Q. What about medical school professors? Are they part of the public health community?
A. Yes.
Q. A lot of the constituent groups within the public health community then have their own individual ways of approaching the
issue of smoking and health; wouldn't that be fair to say?
A. I think that's fair.
Q. Is that one of the reasons it's such a huge job, what you are undertaking about the public health --
A. Well --
Q. -- community's response?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
21BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. -- that and because there's so many organizations. And the response of the public health community to this story, which I
think is the most important public health story in the 20th century, has been absolutely overwhelming. And so to get a sense of
how the public health community grappled with this issue, you know, has been an immense undertaking.
Q. Why do you think this is the most important public health issue of the 20th century?
A. Because smoking was a behavior that half of -- perhaps even more than half of the population engaged in. It was important
because it was a leading cause of illness and disability and death in this country.
Q. When you are talking about more than half the population, you are talking about the United States of America?
A. Yes.
Q. Are your --
A. And adults in that, too.
Q. Are your studies limited to the United States of America?
A. Primarily the United States of America, but certainly the public health community in the last decade or so has also been
looking beyond the shores and looking at other -- Surgeon General, for example, has had reports on smoking in other countries.
And in addition to that, the American public health community from time to time has looked especially to Britain and some
of their special reports coming out of the Royal College of Physicians. So in that sense it's been international, but primarily I
have been looking at the United States.
Q. Why in the last decade has some of the constituency of the public health community been looking abroad?
A. Because they see that as an additional problem of smoking, as that has a worldwide dimension.
Q. If I suggested to you that as smoking declined in the United States it's increasing in other parts of the world, would you be
in a position to agree or disagree with that?
A. You know, I don't know the -- the numbers around the world to know that.
Q. The Royal College of Physicians is what, please?
A. It's a -- it's a professional body of physicians in Great Britain.
Q. Why would parts of the public health community here look to the Royal College of Physicians as opposed to its counterparts
in France or Italy or Germany?
A. I think part of that is just the affinity of this country for Great Britain. I think physicians, public health people are more
familiar with the Royal College of Physicians than perhaps public health organizations in other countries.
Q. Plus you know how to read the Lancet, and you might not be able to read its corresponding publication in Paris?
A. Are you talking about me personally?
Q. Yes.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
22BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. I can read French.
Q. Or in Rome?
A. I cannot read it in Italian.
Q. Okay. I guess we spent a little bit of time -- “we” meaning me and other people -- in tobacco on this issue. But would you
agree that during the last 50 years or so the Lancet is certainly, let's say, one of the top five medical journals in the world?
A. It's certainly a prominent one. I wouldn't want to give it a ranking. But the Lancet is a -- is one of the premiere medical
journals, yes.
Q. That's fine. I don't need numbers.
A. Yeah.
Q. That's probably a male thing to do that. It's one of the leading ones; right?
A. Yes.
Q. And isn't there another British medical journal that's also one of the world's leading ones?
A. That has that very name, “The British Medical Journal.”
Q. And in the United States, what would you say would be the top couple or few medical journals?
A. Well, of course, of a general nature, it would be the “New England Journal of Medicine” and “The Journal of the American
Medical Association.”
Q. If we weren't talking general and we are in this case talking smoking, can you tell me in your view as a medical historian
what some of the leading peer review journals are in this country?
A. Well, it gets -- it gets -- the journals get spread out because of specialties. I mean, “The Journal of the National Cancer
Institute” has published many of the prominent articles on smoking and health. And “The American Journal of Public Health”
has produced many.
If you get into areas of the lung, many of the respiratory and pulmonary journals have done that. If you get into issues of heart
disease, circulation and other journals in there. So I think it begins to diffuse out into other journals.
Q. Okay. So the constituent products from tobacco smoke affect different parts of the body, and these journals track different
parts of the body. And therefore different journals are interesting on this issue? Sound good?
A. And it's -- yes. I think that's one way to look at it.
Q. And so would we be talking primarily about pulmonary, cardiac, circulatory systems?
A. Primarily.

23BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
Q. From a historian's point of view, nowadays are there any other sources other than the constituent parts of tobacco smoke
that are believed to be responsible for bladder cancer?
A. I'm not aware of them. I can't answer that.
Q. You don't know?
A. I don't know.
Q. Okay. Let me prod just a little more. You don't know, or you don't know of any other causes?
A. I don't -- I don't know of other causes.
Q. Okay. So that means there would be probably some fairly significant space in journals dealing with urology having to do
with smoking tobacco?
A. Could well be, yeah.
Q. How many hours have you given since you were recontacted by Mr. Garnick to this current project?
A. Are you talking about which -- which part? The public health project or this case?
Q. Good point. Let's take the whole ball of wax.
Since Mr. Garnick got back to you in the vicinity of '98, '99 is the closest I can come from the testimony so far, how many
hours have you spent with this Philip Morris sponsored research?
A. You know, I've never added them up, but it would come to several hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Q. And “several” is what? More than a couple?
A. More than a couple.
Q. Three? Four? Five? What?
A. There are probably more than five.
Q. What has been your billing rate since Mr. Garnick recontacted you?
A. $350 an hour.
Q. Okay. When you do your billing, do you break it down into different subcategories like public health versus revisit pre-1964
versus --
A. No.
Q. No? Just general research?
A. That's correct.

Q. Have you gotten research grants from any organizations in the past?
A. For?
Q. Anything.
A. Anything, yes.
Q. Tell me, please.
A. I've gotten them from the federal government, the National Institute of Health, the National Library of Medicine for my
rheumatic fever project. I've gotten them from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund. Also for the rheumatic fever project.
Q. Burroughs Wellcome Fund.
A. Burroughs Wellcome Fund.
Q. What's the largest grant you've gotten that doesn't have to do with tobacco research?
A. About $60,000.
Q. What's the total of your research grants that you've ever gotten?
A. I've never added it up.
Q. Are they part of your CV?
A. No, they are not. I do not have the -- my grants are on there, but I don't have the dollar amounts.
Q. Can you safely say that you've gotten more from the current tobacco research in which you are involved than from all of
the other grants you've ever had come up?
A. Yes.
Q. How far along are you in your current research?
A. With?
Q. It's a crummy question. It's okay. I'm guilty. Is the research that Mr. Garnick sponsored around '98, '99 ongoing?
A. The -- I believe the bulk of it is done. As individual cases emerge, there is sometimes additional work that has to be done
in preparation for those particular cases.
Q. Putting aside the individual cases, when do you believe the bulk of your research was completed?
A. Oh, probably about a year ago.
Q. Prior to a year ago, had you started working on side research for individual cases for Mr. Garnick?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
25BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. I'm trying to think. Specifically prior to a year ago, that would -- that would put it in -- in May. I mean, I may have started
in April looking. But basically it was about a year ago.
Q. Yeah. Well, I don't care what month it is. The only reason I'm mentioning the year is you did. You said roughly a year ago --
A. Yeah, right.
Q. -- the bulk of your research was done. So whenever that was, whenever the bulk of your research was done, prior to that
time were you working on any individual cases?
A. No.
Q. And since then how many individual cases have you worked on?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Do you mean retained to testify in the individual case?
MR. PIUZE: I've got no clue. I'm just following what he's saying. I don't know.
Q. What do you mean by -- like this lawyer said, what do you mean by individual cases?
MR. ROSENTHAL: Because I'm not entirely sure myself.
THE DEPONENT: Well, I mean, there was the Blue Cross case.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: Right.
A. There was the case in Portland, Oregon.
Q. The Schwary --
A. The Schwary case. And then there's this case, Bullock.
Q. Did you testify in Schwary?
A. No.
Q. Did you give a depo? I know you didn't give a deposition on Schwary because I just heard the lawyer on that case bragged
that he didn't take one single deposition so -- partially because the state of Oregon doesn't allow it.
A. Oh.
Q. Okay. So the individual billing for Blue Cross -- was there individual billing for Blue Cross?
A. I -- you know, I don't remember a specific amount with Blue Cross.
Q. So that's a yes, there was, but you don't remember what it is?
A. I don't remember what it was, yes.

26BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
Q. Okay. But you did send them a bill, let's say, Blue Cross litigation?
A. Well, my recollection is that because that was the case that I was -- you know, one of the cases for which Mr. Garnick came
back to ask my research help, that I started on that, and then at some point it became more specific to that. But the entire sort
of groundwork of preparation for the public health community's response and Blue Cross overlap a lot in time.
Q. What about Schwary? Did you turn in an individual bill for that?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. How much?
A. About $40,000.
Q. So it sounds like about a hundred hours.
A. Yeah.
Q. And what about Bullock so far?
A. It's right at $100,000.
Q. So that would be 250, 300 hours?
A. Yes.
Q. Where did the extra couple hundred hours come from in Bullock that didn't exist in Schwary? What additional stuff were
you looking at?
A. California specific -- I have a good base of the national public health story, and this has to do with more of the California
specific, the Master Settlement Agreement and also, you know, reviewing my prior research to keep me current for this case.
Q. Okay. So what is it that you looked at having to be California specific?
A. I ran computer searches for California and smoking and health running from 1960s through 2002. When I discovered the
importance of Proposition 99 in 1998, I focused heavily on that, and I read fairly thoroughly in the various reports of agencies
in the California government about Proposition 99 and its success. I've also looked at independent evaluations of that. So I've
read a fair amount on California specific issues.
Q. What was Proposition 99, please?
A. It was a voter initiative in 1988 that raised the tax, excise tax, on cigarettes by 25 percent that led to a comprehensive program
of -- to cut down smoking in the State of California.
Q. What had the excise tax been?
A. 10 cents, I believe.

27BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
Q. And what did it go to?
A. 35.
Q. How much of that money was used to fund public service-type announcements?
A. I think the original proposition hoped it would be as high as 20 percent, and I think that there's been controversy in the State
of California that has been somewhat less than that. Somewhere around 15 percent.
Q. Do you know what the total amount taken in from Proposition 99 has been?
A. I'm sure I've come across it. But as I sit here this morning, I can't give you a number.
Q. Do you know what the total amount has been, on public service announcements has been?
A. Again, I have read that, but I don't have a specific recollection this morning.
Q. Both of those questions were couched in present tense if I were to ask the question for any given year. So, for instance, up
until 1999, would you know how much was spent?
A. Huh-uh. I mean, I have read that, but I don't recall it.
Q. Okay. And are you familiar with the actual public service announcements themselves?
A. Some of the articles that I have read and some of the reports have had some summaries on those, but I have not actually
seen them.
Q. Okay. Some played on television. You obviously know that.
A. Yes.
Q. Have you ever seen videos of those?
A. No.
Q. Have you ever seen transcripts of them?
A. I don't believe I've seen a complete transcript.
Q. Okay. Some played on radio, obviously; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Same questions. Have you ever --
A. No, I not.
Q. Have you ever seen the print public service announcements?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
28BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. There have been some that have been published as part of the California reports, and I've seen some of the posters. But I
have not made a systematic review of those.
Q. Do you have any kind of an opinion as to whether or not the people in charge of these public service reports are actually
tracking litigation so that they can air their commercials to keep tune with ongoing litigation?
A. I don't know that.
Q. Have you ever seen that discussed?
A. No. I haven't seen it discussed.
Q. Okay. The purpose of the public service announcements is what?
A. To educate people about the dangers of smoking.
Q. To try to get everyone to stop?
A. That would be a goal.
Q. Is that a stated goal someplace?
A. I think the stated goal was actually to reduce smoking down to -- I think the initial goal was something like 6.5 percent
was the goal.
Q. How have they done thus far?
A. They've done well in that California has less -- fewer smokers than the rest of the nation. Somewhere around 18, 18-1/2
percent.
Q. Is California the lowest per capita smoking state in the country?
A. You know, it's one of the lowest, but it's not the lowest, no.
Q. Do you know what the lowest is?
A. No. As I sit here, I can't -- don't know.
Q. Utah, I believe.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I believe, too.
THE DEPONENT: Okay.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: So the percent you just gave me, is that the current percentage of smokers in California?
A. On the last report, I think the last report I read was 2001. And so it was somewhere in the 18 percents.
Q. Where was it when Prop 99 passed?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
29BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. I believe it was up around 25.
Q. And do you know where the national average was that year?
A. In '88, it would be somewhere around probably 28, 29.
Q. And where --
A. So California was always lower but --
Q. What are the national averages now?
A. National average now is about 25-1/2, 26. Somewhere around there.
Q. So therefore California's proportionate drop has been significantly greater in that --
A. Yes.
Q. -- 12- or 13-year interval?
A. Yes. And that's what the public health community has reported.
Q. And has the public health community chalked up most of that proportionately greater drop as being caused by Prop 99?
A. Certainly that's given -- given a lot of credit, whether it's -- often the reports try to figure out what aspects of Prop 99 has it
been. Has it been the public service announcement. Has it been the school education component. Has it been the -- just the rise
in the excise tax itself as being a component of it. But it's probably a mix of those.
Q. Tell me about the public school or public educational component. What do you mean by that?
A. An attempt to get these educational materials in front of California children.
Q. Didn't that exist prior to Prop 99?
A. It did. But at least in my reading of the materials, this was a much more detailed and concerted effort to try to get these
materials in front of children. The other component -- another component of it is recognizing California as a multi-ethnic
background, to design materials that would be in different languages and aimed at different -- different groups.
Q. Were these materials aimed at the kids to keep the kids from smoking, or were they also aimed at the kids to take the message
home to their parents to tell them to stop smoking?
A. It's probably both.
Q. And that “probably” means that you don't know?
A. Well, I think one of the public health messages has always been and the hope is that if you aim something at a child, that the
child will also take that home. In fact, if you look at some of the Heart Association, the American Heart Association materials,
they have even designed it going both ways, you know. What do you tell your parents about smoking, and what do you -- and

30BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
then there's -- a parallel campaign is what do you tell your children about it. I mean, I think the hope is that the information
will be exchanged.
Q. Is there any kind of an analysis, quantitative measurement of some sort, that has to do with the public education system's
anti-smoking campaign after Prop 99 versus before 99?
A. I'm not sure I follow your question. What was that again?
Q. Another bad question. I'm trying to figure out, are there any reports that quantify either amounts spent on this public education
project before and after Prop 99 or effectiveness before and after Prop 99?
A. Well, certainly the people who are writing these reports are very proud of Prop 99. And in my reading of them, the implication
that I'm left with is that everything is -- there is much more now.
But as I sit here today, I cannot recall whether there -- whether I've seen a comparative figure of we are now doing ten times
as much or that. I just don't recall that.
Q. Who was in charge of making the television commercials that were paid for by Prop 99 money? Do you know?
A. I don't know.
Q. Well, when you were in New York, you've already told me you got to say most of what you wanted to say at the Blue Cross
trial. True statement; right?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. Yes?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Here we are in California, and I guess there would be some issues -- let me stop myself. Do you want to go back
home today?
A. I hope to.
Q. I'm trying to shortcut the process to a great extent because I'm capable of reading the transcript from New York. And so
I'll rely on, you know, what you said there. If I read the transcript from New York, I'm going to know most of what you want
to say generally nonCalifornia; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Then why don't you tell me about whatever opinions you have in this case, Bullock versus Philip Morris, that have to
do with the fact that Betty Bullock lived in California and was exposed to California sources, please.
A. Well, I think the public health story in California is largely paralleled with the public health story in the rest of the nation in
that the public health community launched an overwhelming campaign and -- but having said that, I think California has been
a leader and a recognized leader in the anti-smoking campaign as far as smoking in public buildings, as far as rates of smokers.
And so it's the same story, but it seems to have been more emphatic here in California.

31BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
Q. At all times that you have measured?
A. Certainly in latter years, yes. I can't say that it is more -- was more so, but certainly I would think it would be equivalent
to the rest of the nation.
Q. Is that your full answer, your whole California answer, as far as Bullock versus Philip Morris?
A. Can you give me some -- some more specific --
Q. Well, I'm trying to figure out what you are going to say at trial. That's why we take the depositions.
A. Uh-huh.
Q. And even though the State of Oregon doesn't allow it, the State of California does.
A. Uh-huh.
Q. So you are here so I can find out what you are going to say at trial, and I just don't know that I can be a whole lot more
specific. You've told me that you've spent a significant amount of time studying the effects of Prop 99 on smoking and health
in California, and I just want to know what you are prepared to say at trial in Betty Bullock's case as far as how all of your
studies relate to her case.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I can also help you out a little bit to the extent you want. Is that all right, you'd like me to help you out?
MR. PIUZE: Sure.
MR. ROSENTHAL: My understanding is that when we approached Dr. English about the Bullock case, he was already felt to
be an expert on the national public health story. And what he wanted to do was confirm that the national public health story
was consistent with what happened in California in the early 1950's, 1960's to the present. And certainly California has some
unique portions to that story, such as Prop 99. And he also is comfortable with that.
And please correct me if anything I'm saying is wrong.
And may be expected to testify about that. But my understanding of what the general scope of his testimony with respect to
California will be is that California's public health story is consistent generally with what went on in the nation. And in a couple
of areas California has gone a little further, such as things like Prop 99.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: What other areas has California gone further?
A. I think that's the main one.
Q. Okay. You heard that recitation?
A. I did.
Q. Is that accurate?
A. Yes.

32BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
MR. ROSENTHAL: Just to -- I mean, you also -- and I think you said this earlier today -- they went further in workplace
smoking restrictions.
THE DEPONENT: Yeah. Well, I just said that.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Okay. I wanted to make sure that was covered.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: The first time I went to a deposition in California where a lawyer objected to smoking, I figured he was
some kind of a pinko or something. I couldn't believe it.
A. What year was that?
Q. Probably around '74.
A. That's interesting because, you know, well --
(Discussion off the record.)
MR. PIUZE: Okay. Ms. Reporter, are you ready to roll here?
Q. Do you have any opinions about when the public health community came to a decision that cigarette smoke caused lung
cancer?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. When?
A. I think they reached a consensus with the 1964 Surgeon General's report.
Q. And not before?
A. Not before.
Q. Why not before?
A. I mean, of course -- I mean, I think there are a number of reasons why. If we look at how evidence, scientific evidence,
builds up to reach this decision, it came from three different sciences. It came from epidemiology, experimental biology, and
toxicology. And in a cumulative process before the Surgeon General's report, it took those 12 to 14 years for that to occur. I'll
be happy to go into any detail on any of that. But my general view is that each of these sciences has had specific contributions.
They also had specific problems of impeding the scientific discovery in that it took about 15 years from roughly 1950 to 1964
before a consensus could emerge.
Q. Why do you start at '50?
A. Because that's the year where I think the first hard evidence emerged that smoking was linked Spherion Deposition Services
(800) 722-1235 to lung cancer.
Q. And prior to that, there had been evidence from New Orleans, had there not?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
33BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. There had been a number of reports, sometimes what is known as anecdotal reports. In other words, reports that came from
out of the experience of various physicians that there was a link -- that there was a connection between lung cancer and smoking.
But there had been other reports with lung cancer and other possible carcinogens.
Q. What year did the Titanic sink?
A. 1912.
Q. Do you know approximately how many cases of lung cancer were reported in the world that year?
A. 1912?
Q. Yeah.
A. It wouldn't be very many. I'm not sure precisely the number.
Q. This question isn't designed to get precisely. Just sort of a quantum or a general magnitude, if I suggested it would be
measured in the thousands, would that sound right to you? Too low? Too high?
A. Thousands may be too high.
Q. Too high. A thousand might be too high?
A. I can't tell you.
Q. If I suggested to you -- I guess this isn't medical history. This is either history or movie-going. How many people perished
in the Titanic sinking?
A. You know, I'm not 100 percent sure. I think it's somewhere around 2,000. But you sound like you have the answer to that
question.
Q. I don't. But my guess is two to four. Something like that. Two, three. Something like that. I don't know. It doesn't matter. If
I suggested to you that perhaps the number of reported lung cancer cases in the entire world in 1912 was roughly equivalent to
the number of people that died in the Titanic, would that sound about right to you?
A. I really can't say.
Q. How many people died of lung cancer in the world last year?
A. You know, I don't know if I have a number, a world number, on that.
Q. U.S.?
A. I think in the U.S. the Centers for Disease Control attributes somewhere over a hundred thousand lung cancer deaths.
Q. Per year?
A. Per year.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
34BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
Q. And over 400,000 deaths generally per year to tobacco?
A. Yes, that's correct.
Q. What are the other causes of death that start with tobacco that the Centers for Disease Control list?
A. I'm not so sure I understand your question.
Q. If the Centers for Disease Control breaks deaths down into the mechanism of disease --
A. Oh, I see. Okay.
Q. -- what else is there besides lung cancer?
A. Well, there's also -- there's heart disease. There would be other forms of cancer. There are accidents, work-related issues,
infectious diseases. I mean, there's a whole host of possible categories.
Q. Well, I'm talking about causes of death that start with tobacco.
MR. ROSENTHAL: He's talking about -- he wants to break down the 400,000 number.
THE DEPONENT: I see.
So it would be lung cancer, heart disease, other forms of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: And do you have any kind of numbers for any of those?
A. You know, I can't break it down further than that.
Q. How many people have died in the United States from smoking-related diseases in the last decade?
MR. ROSENTHAL: To the extent you know.
THE DEPONENT: Well, I mean, if you were to multiply roughly 400,000 a year by ten, that would be four million deaths
attributed to smoking.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: In the last 50 years since your study started?
A. I don't have a number for that.
Q. Although you don't have an exact number, do you have sort of a quantum, an area?
A. I don't have that.
Q. Would it be less than multiplying 400,000 times 50?
A. It would be. I mean, the whole use of attributed numbers started about 15 or 16 years ago.
And before then, those numbers, you know, weren't in that ballpark. So I can't -- I can't give you a number.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
35BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
Q. Why were they not in that ballpark?
A. Because there were fewer lung-cancer deaths. Probably fewer heart diseases -- heart-disease deaths also.
Q. Well, from your vantage point, why in the last 15 or 20 years -- is that what you said, 15 or 20? I don't want to be misquoting
you.
A. 15. That they've used the attributable-risk formula to come up with the number 400,000, that's a relatively recent way of
arriving at these numbers.
Q. What's an attributable-risk formula, please?
A. I can't give you the formula. It's a statistician's tool to distribute deaths that -- to -- a cancer can come from a variety of
different sources. And they try to -- we are using statistical means to distribute how many come from lung cancer. How many
come from smoking. How many come from others. But it's a complicated formula.
Q. Putting the statistical basis for the number keeping aside, do you believe that 20 or 21 years ago as opposed to 15 or 16 there
were still about 400,000 Americans a year dying secondary to tobacco?
A. I think it would be lower than that.
Q. Why?
A. Just because the numbers appear to be getting larger as time goes on, and that was, you know, 20 years ago.
Q. Do you find it anomalous that as the percentage of the population that smokes goes down, down, down, the number of deaths
from tobacco goes up, up, up?
MR. ROSENTHAL: I'm going to object to the form.
THE DEPONENT: Yeah. Well, again, of course the population is also increasing. And so the percentages sometimes makes it
hard to -- but yeah. You know, I don't really have a comment on that.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: Okay. Well, what if I cued you as follows: That there's a latency period for death secondary to smoking-
related disease, would that be a reason?
A. It could be a reason.
Q. Let's go to the other comment you just made. The population in the United States has grown over the course of the last 50
years, obviously, hasn't it?
A. It has.
Q. From what to what?
A. You know, I think it's probably grown from about 175 million to 250 or 60 million.
Q. Okay. And the population of California has grown over that time?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
36BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. It has, but I can't give you specific numbers from those dates.
Q. More dramatically?
A. At times the population in California has grown quite dramatically.
Q. Don't forget way back in the '50s everyone used to live in New Jersey; right?
A. I moved from New Jersey to California in 1957. So I was part of one of those immigrations.
Q. Where did you move to?
A. It was an apricot orchard south of Oakland, California which now has the term “Fremont.” And then it had about 20,000
people and several million apricot trees.
Q. What were you doing? Picking?
A. I did a lot of picking but not legally.
Q. Your family moved out here?
A. Yeah.
Q. Did you grow up out here?
A. I grew -- I spent two years, and then my family moved back to New Jersey.
Q. Although the percentage of smokers has gone down in California as you've told us, because the population has increased,
do you have any opinion about whether or not the number of smokers is actually greater now than before the Prop 99 event?
A. I don't have the number specifically on me. I mean, I can see where that could be a possibility where the percentage would
go down and the population would go up and there might actually be more smokers.
Q. But you don't know that to be the case?
A. I don't know that, no.
Q. I heard someone say that -- that's a bad way to start a question. I'll withdraw that.
If I were to suggest to you that the birth of epidemiology was a bigger 20th century medical history event than the smoking
and health issues, would you agree or disagree with that?
A. Well, of course epidemiology occurred, you know, back in the ancient world. And so it wasn't -- didn't get birthed in the
20th century in any particular way. Chronic disease epidemiology was birthed -- in fact, it was intimately connected with the
smoking and health question.

37BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
You are looking at -- you know, it depends how you want to define things. You are looking at particular signs as being important.
I'm looking at public health issues like disease as being more important. But I think that the smoking and health issue which,
of course, includes a little bit of chronic disease epidemiology, is the most important public health story of the 20th century.
Q. You weren't limiting that to the United States. You meant globally; correct?
A. Well, I'm talking primarily in the United States. I think if looking at other parts of the world that are dealing with issues of
hunger and diarrhea and respiratory illnesses, I think the public health story in those parts of the world might well be sanitation.
So, you know -- so I was thinking of this in terms of the U.S.
Q. Okay. Well, so let me take another shot at something I was asking earlier. Do you have any kind of an opinion as to the raw
numbers of casualties from smoking in the United States over the 50-year period that you've studied?
A. I've never made that calculation, no. I don't have it.
Q. And do you have any opinions as to the raw numbers of deaths broken down into subcategories of cause -- cancer, circulation,
cardiac -- that were started off with tobacco?
A. Over a 50-year period?
Q. Yes.
A. No, I don't.
Q. Okay. Over what period, if any, do you have those opinions?
A. I've never made a cumulative graph or chart to that effect, no.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Can I clarify? Are you asking whether he has a specific opinion or whether he's aware of what the public
health community thinks to be the case?
MR. PIUZE: Let's take the second part.
That's fair.
Q. What the numbers are that the public health community generally attributes to smoking.
A. I don't have them, you know, memorized here. I mean, I know how to get those numbers.
Q. How?
A. I mean, I would go to the Surgeon General's reports, the Centers for Disease Control, and I would go to the sections on
tobacco-attributable deaths and add them up. But I've just -- I have just never done that.
Q. Aside from, “Don't smoke,” what do you tell five- and six- and seven-year-olds about smoking?
A. As I mentioned earlier, I turn it around a little bit, and I let them tell me. And then I amplify on it. And what they tell me,
it sort of reflects what they are learning in the graded curriculum that they are receiving.

38BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
And so when they say “bad,” then I say something like, “Well, bad for what?”
And then if they say, “For your lungs,” then we talk about lungs. And usually they can -- a couple of them can get heart by the
time they are six or seven. We talk about bad for your heart. Most seven- and eight-year-olds will use the word “addictive.”
And we talk, and I ask them, you know, “What do you mean by ‘addictive’?”
And, you know, they say, “Hard to quit.”
And then as they get closer to teenagers, some of it gets shifted a little bit more into things like bad breath and -- in addition
to the other things that are along the way. But my style is not actually to deliver a lecture. I look at my role as bringing it up
and then reinforcing what they already know.
Q. What about when you are talking to teenagers starting like 12, 13? What do you say to them?
A. When they get to be around 11, I ask them are they smoking, and -- and then it goes from there.
Q. Okay. Well, why don't you tell me where it goes.
A. Well, if -- if they aren't smoking, I review all the reasons with them that we've been talking about over the years why they
shouldn't start.
Q. Right.
A. And I also if they aren't smoking tell them that, you know, they are going to be exposed, their friends, or some -- someone
is likely to offer them a cigarette and reinforce ways that they can just say -- say they are not interested if that's what they
want to do. There are some, unfortunately, of my patients -- even though I've been doing this since, you know, for 10 years
-- at 15, 16 or 17 are smoking.
Q. Do you ask them why?
A. Yes. I always ask them why. And it's usually something like, you know, “What gives? You know, we've been talking about
this for ten years, and you've been telling me all this.” And I say, “Can you tell me how it happened?”
And what they tell me is “Doc, you know, I'm dating this girl, and she smokes” or “everyone in my family smokes” or “I'm
hanging with a group that smokes,” which -- so I guess in some ways my practice squares with most studies that indicate, you
know, when kids are asked the question, you know, “Why do you start smoking?” they usually use terms like, you know, that
their friends or their family or whatever.
Q. And if I keep going up the ladder to 16 and 17 and 19 and 20, are your answers going to be any different --
A. Huh-uh --
Q. -- as to what you say --
A. -- no.
Q. -- to these people? Are you successful in --
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
39BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
A. Well, there's one other element. There is that they are smoking. Then I start talking to them Spherion Deposition Services
(800) 722-1235 about, you know, stopping. So in that sense, the -- my volume gets louder as they get older.
Q. What do you tell them?
A. That they need to do it. I tell them, you know, one -- you know, it's one of those health decisions that they really need to
make. I mean, protected sex is another, other kinds of drugs, you know -- you know, driving, you know, after drinking. I mean,
there are -- unfortunately the message has to be -- from my point of view has many prongs to it. But the smoking component
to it is that they simply have to find a way to stop.
Q. Are those the big four things you tell young people -- no smoking, no drugs, no unprotected sex, and no drinking and driving?
A. Yes. But -- but again, the message can't be delivered that way.
Q. Of course.
A. It has to be tailored. And there are other things, too. I mean, there's all sorts of violence issues.
Q. No automatic weapons in the classroom?
A. Or a younger age is, “What would you do if someone came to school with a gun?” is the way I phrase the question. Because,
you know, the unfortunate thing is at least a number of these tragedies is that a lot of people knew that there were guns present
before, you know, the tragedy occurs. And so I want to make sure the kids know how to do that.
Also, when the kids go off to college, the issues of depression and suicide. I mean, I bring up -- it's sort of a depressing list
of things I bring up. But I don't do it every meeting, but I do make sure that I have a sense that they are presented with the
information.
Q. A couple of questions back when I gave you four “don'ts,” a part of your response was that you don't give the message that
way. Do you remember that? Do you remember saying that?
A. Uh-huh. I mean, I don't say don't, don't, don't, don't. But that's -- that is what the message is.
Q. Correct. Why is it that you do not deliver the message don't, don't, don't, don't, don't?
A. I'd rather have them -- I'd rather have the conclusion emerge from them.
Q. Now, have you ever seen a deposition notice for your deposition here?
A. I'm not sure exactly. What is a deposition notice?
Q. It's a written piece of paper in which we said we want you at a certain time, or we want you to bring a whole bunch of
stuff. Have you ever seen that?
A. I've had it read to me, but I haven't actually seen it.
Q. Is there any reason you haven't brought any stuff?
MR. ROSENTHAL: That presupposes that he has not brought stuff.

40BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: Have you brought stuff?
A. I have a list of the materials that I have read.
Q. What else have you read in response? What else have you brought?
A. I have brought the bills I've submitted in this case.
Q. What else?
A. What?
Q. What else?
A. That's it.
Q. Okay. May I see the stuff you brought?
A. Uh-huh, of course.
Q. That's the stack of bills? That's the materials you've read?
A. Yes, they are.
Q. Okay. So here's two inches of paper. What is that about?
A. Those are the list of articles and materials that I have -- I have relied upon.
Q. And that's Exhibit 1.
(Deposition Exhibit No. 1 was marked for identification and is annexed hereto.)
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: And here is about four or five --
A. Four.
Q. -- pieces of paper. What's that?
A. Those are my bills in this case.
MR. PIUZE: That's Exhibit 2.
(Deposition Exhibit No. 2 was marked for identification and is attached hereto.)
MR. PIUZE: Have we been provided with a copy of his CV?
MR. ROSENTHAL: No, and I can't remember if it was part of the deposition notice. If we didn't bring it, it was an oversight,
and I can supply you with one afterwards.

41BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
MR. PIUZE: Please.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Sure.
MR. PIUZE: That will be Exhibit 3. Will you just send it right to this court reporter --
MR. ROSENTHAL: Sure. That's fine.
MR. PIUZE: -- please.
(Deposition Exhibit No. 3 was subsequently marked and is attached hereto.)
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: Okay. Now, are there any areas that you presently intend to give testimony on in Bullock versus Philip
Morris that we have not yet discussed at least generally?
A. My understanding is that I will be seeing some of Mrs. Bullock's medical records.
Q. Her medical records?
A. Yes, and specifically I asked whether there was indication that her physicians had ever spoken with her about the issues
of her smoking.
Q. Okay. And let's assume they did. So given your identity as a medical historian, how is that going to affect your testimony
about medical history?
A. Well, my view is that, you know, where do people go to get their public health information. And I think one of the prime
areas, prime sources, for that are individual physicians. So in that sense, that would confirm that Mrs. Bullock had that as a
source of the dangers of smoking and health.
Q. Let's assume she did have that as a source.
A. Uh-huh.
Q. What does that do for your opinions as a medical historian?
A. It means that she -- exactly that, that she had that source of information.
Q. All right. Are there any other areas generally? Now, I'm not getting down to micromanaging exactly what question someone
is going to ask you. Are there any other areas generally that you intend to give testimony on in Bullock versus Philip Morris
that we have not discussed yet?
A. The Master Settlement Agreement I mentioned earlier. I don't know whether -- we haven't discussed it. That's it.
Q. Okay. Let's hear what you have to say about the Master Settlement Agreement, please.
A. Well, the Master Settlement Agreement I think is the most recent of a number of attempts to address issues of marketing
and distribution of tobacco products. It emerged in 1998 after negotiations with Attorneys General of the various states and
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
42BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
tobacco companies, and it resulted in an agreement that had a number of advertising restrictions especially aimed at -- of cutting
down exposure to youth.
It also had dealings with sponsorships to things such as basketball and football and baseball games and concerts and that --
it also had to do away with the Tobacco Institute and counseling Tobacco and Research. It had the creation of the American
Legacy Foundation which has been responsible for a lot of public service information.
And it had -- it provided over $200 billion dollars to the states to spend as they saw fit --
Q. Okay.
A. -- in turn for dropping some of the Attorney General's cases against the tobacco companies.
Q. How many states took part in the settlement?
A. Well, it negotiated in -- I think 40 states negotiated, and I believe every state signed on to it eventually.
Q. How about places like Virginia and North Carolina? Are they part of it?
A. Absolutely. Yesterday when I left, they were -- North Carolina was arguing how they were going to diwy up this year's
amount. And they were particularly pleased over the public health that a greater share was going to go for child smoking
prevention.
Q. How much money was paid in the Master Settlement Agreement? Do you know?
MR. ROSENTHAL: To date or --
THE DEPONENT: I mean, the total was 206 billion over 25 years.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: That did not include the states that had previously walked up to the courthouse steps with the tobacco
industry and settled on their own, did it?
A. I thought they were folded in, but I could be wrong about that.
Q. Prior to the Master Settlement Agreement, do you know if there was another proposed agreement for more money?
A. Yes. There was one that -- that was proposed in 1997 which had, as its component, quite a bit more money, 350 or -60 billion
dollars but also had in it protection from future liability lawsuits and also had Food and Drug Administration oversight. And
that was proposed because of the legal ramifications that required congressional -- congressional approval, and it was defeated.
Q. So if that was passed, you and I wouldn't be here, huh?
A. Anyone's guess.
Q. It's a no-brainer.
Okay. Other areas. Any other areas that you haven't told me about that you anticipate you are going to be giving testimony
in Bullock versus Morris?

43BETTY BULLOCK, Plaintiff, v. PHILIP MORRIS,..., 2002 WL 34425546...
MR. ROSENTHAL: I can obviously help you out on this, too, if you want.
MR. PIUZE: Please. Always ready to accept help.
MR. ROSENTHAL: And please correct me if anything I say is incorrect.
My understanding of the things that he could conceivably testify about have not been discussed. I mean, obviously there's an
issue about whether low-tar cigarettes and safer cigarettes are going to be an issue in this case, and that's something I don't
pretend to know what the ultimate answer to that is. I think a motion in limine has been filed in that. If for some reason low-
tar cigarettes are an issue in this case, he is perfectly qualified to testify about it.
He testified about it in the Blue Cross case in Brooklyn. I mean, there's pages of testimony on low-tar cigarettes from him. And
certainly if it's an issue in this case, it's something that we might ask him to testify about. That's one.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: That's one, Doctor, where if I had read your Blue Cross/Blue Shield testimony, I'd have your current
thinking; correct?
A. As I recall, yes. Yeah.
Q. Okay. Thank you, both.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Okay. A second is -- and this one is a little harder for me to frame because it depends more on you. To
the extent that any of your experts talk about something that falls within his area of expertise, he may be asked to respond. I
can give you a couple of examples to sort of show what we are talking about.
One obviously is I know one of your experts, Burns. Burns talks about whether a consensus was reached, and I think he says the
mid to late 1950's. Burns occasionally will use an internal company document and suggest that that internal company document
reflected knowledge that was not in the scientific community. To the extent that that's something that Dr. English knows about
based on his research, we might ask him to respond to that.
To give you another example -- I mean, I believe one of your experts is Dr. Farone. Dr. Farone has a series -- this is my
understanding of his testimony -- of proposed safer alternative designs that Philip Morris should have incorporated at an earlier
point. That we don't intend to have Dr. English in any way testify about the feasibility of any of those designs. He's not an
expert in that. To the extent that his research of what the public health community was thinking touches upon some of Dr.
Farone's proposed safer alternative designs, there's a possibility that he might be called. And I can give you an example to show
you what I'm thinking of.
One of the things I believe Dr. Farone talks about is the Cambridge plus, what we call, cigarette which is essentially drop all
the tar out of a cigarette and adds some nicotine back in. In the course of his research as to what --
And please correct me if I am wrong.
In the course of his research about what the public health community was doing at various points in time, Dr. English can
comment on the extent of what the public health thought of the idea of adding nicotine back into a cigarette. This all -- I mean, we
would only put this on to the extent Dr. Farone talked about it in the course of your examination. I mean, I don't know what your
case-in-chief is going to look like. Off the top of my head, those are the examples I can think of. It's not meant to be exclusive.
Do you want me to go on or --

MR. PIUZE: Sure.
MR. ROSENTHAL: I'm trying to think if there's anything else. The only -- and I think I just want to -- I mean, part of the
-- my understanding of Dr. English's public health story is it includes the regulatory efforts that the public health community
undertook with respect to cigarette smoking, and I'm not sure you've specifically talked about that.
MR. PIUZE: Well, we haven't. But if you tell me that that was discussed in Blue Cross/Blue Shield, then we'll have to.
Q. Doctor?
THE DEPONENT: The FTC story?
MR. ROSENTHAL: You probably --
THE DEPONENT: We talked about it.
MR. ROSENTHAL: There was some reference in Blue Cross. I'm not sure if the reference in Blue Cross fully explores his
views on the history of regulation with respect to smoking and health.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: Okay. Go ahead. Express your views, please.
A. Well, the FTC has been involved with issues of advertising and smoking and health for a long time but in 1955 issued a
series of guidelines dealing with regulating of health claims in cigarettes. And so I talk some about that. They specifically made
restrictions on the use of tar and nicotine as part of those health claims.
In 1966 after the first Surgeon General's report in response to the public health community, who was very interested in promoting
low-tar or low cigarettes -- low-tar and low-nicotine cigarettes for smokers who chose to continue smoking, the public health
community asked the FTC to change its ruling and actually permit disclosure of tar and nicotine yields, which it relinquished
and did indeed permit that.
The following year in 1967, the Federal Trade Commission actually decided to measure its own -- make its own measurements
in tar and nicotine. Before they had been done by consumer groups such as consumer union groups authored by Reader's Digest.
This was the Cambridge method that was controversial at the time primarily. Around the issue was that whether tar and nicotine
yields by this method reflected in any way how an individual smoker actually smoked or even of an average smoker. And there
was a recognition both on behalf of the tobacco industry and the FTC that the method did not really measure what individual
smokers did, but it could be used in some comparative fashion.
Since 1968 when these were put in, the Federal Trade Commission has -- has reviewed the issue of its ratings on a number of
occasions, and every time people have brought up shortcomings and the tobacco industry has brought up shortcomings, they've
recognized them but nevertheless decided to persist in using the method.
Q. Is that the extent of your answer?
A. Well, each point has -- could have details, but that's the outline of my answer.
MR. PIUZE: Okay. More? Anybody?
MR. ROSENTHAL: I mean, doing this off the top of my head --

MR. PIUZE: Okay.
MR. ROSENTHAL: His testimony is not going to vary dramatically with respect to Blue Cross --
MR. PIUZE: Okay.
MR. ROSENTHAL: -- except for as discussed here.
Q. BY MR. PIUZE: You are not going to advocate smoking, are you?
A. No, I'm not.
MR. PIUZE: I've got no more questions. Thank you.
THE DEPONENT: Thank you.
MR. PIUZE: I will agree that the court reporter can be relieved of whatever residual obligations she has under the California
Code of Civil Procedure if she will send the original of this deposition to whom?
MR. ROSENTHAL: If you can send it to me, I can send it on to him.
MR. PIUZE: That's fine.
And I'd agree that this witness can sign it at the time and place of his choosing under penalty of perjury as long as I'm informed
of any changes, additions or corrections to the testimony either within 30 days of counsel's receipt of the deposition or the day
before this witness testifies. Whichever one of those two events happens first.
MR. ROSENTHAL: That's fine. And I'd just like to apologize for failing to produce the CV, and I will supply it to the court
reporter as Exhibit 3.
MR. PIUZE: Yeah. We are going to report you to the executive committee and file a report. The merits are in order.
MR. ROSENTHAL: Please do so.
MR. PIUZE: Done.
