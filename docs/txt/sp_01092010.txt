2 Q.
3 moment.
4
5
All right.
We'll talk about that in a
My question was a little bit
different.
6
Without mentioning whether, if you can,
7 you have been listed as a witness, do you have
8 presently under review at the request of the
9 Shook Hardy firm any other smoking and health
10
cases?
11
That was my question.
12 A. No.
13 Q. What is "this"?

BY MR. SALES:
Q.
Have you been requested by Shook, Hardy
22 & Bacon to review any other cases -- don't tell
23 the names for the moment -- other than the
24 Gafney case?
25 A.
Yes, I have.
6
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Q. How many?
2 A. I don't quite know what you mean by
3
"review".
4
5
6
I've been listed in several, and I have
begun some research on maybe two or three.
Q.
Well, I'd like to break it down.
Let's
7 do it the way that you're doing it, and maybe
8 that will make it easier.
9
10
How many other cases have you been
listed as an expert in, if you know?
11 A. I think it could be six or eight.
12 Q. Are those all Florida cases?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Have you given trial testimony in any
15
16
case, so far?
A.
17
I have given trial testimony in two.
MR. CONGROVE:
And David, do you mean
18 -- when you ask that question, you mean Florida
19 cases.
20
MR. SALES:
Well, why don't you let me
21 ask it, and I'm sure it will be clear in a few
22 moments.
23 BY MR. SALES:
24
25
Q.
Have you testified in any trials at the
request of Shook Hardy relating to issues of
7
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 smoking and health ever since the history of man
2 and woman began?
3 MR. CONGROVE:
4 THE WITNESS:
5
Object to form.
Yes, I have.
BY MR. SALES:
6 Q. How many?
7 A. I have testified in five cases up to
8
9
10
2001, and two cases as of 2009.
Q.
I heard you say, correct me if I'm
wrong, five cases prior to 2001?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. And since 2001, how many?
13 A. None except for the two in 2009.
14 Q. And those were both in Florida?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Do you have a testimony list?
17 A. Of the --
18 Q. A list that would identify prior
19
depositions, prior trials and things like that.
20 A. No, I don't.
21 Q. Now, if you can set aside in your mind
22 for a moment the five cases that you just
23 mentioned in which you just testified prior to
24 2001, the two cases in which you testified in
25 2009, and the Gafney case -- that's where I was
8
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 starting -- other than those five, seven, eight
2 cases, do you have any other matters that are
3 under review where you may be one day called to
4 testify either by deposition or at trial?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. And is that the number that is the six
7 to eight additional cases that we spoke of a few
8 moments ago?
9 A.
10
13
Whether they require a deposition or go
to trial, I have no way of knowing.
Q.
14
15
It would be the ones I was listed
in.
11
12
Yes.
All right.
And that brings us full circle to where
I started.
16
Are there any others in which you have
17 not been listed, if you know, where you have
18 been asked to review materials, but for whatever
19 reason, have not yet been listed?
20
21
And please don't name the names of
those names of those parties.
22 A. Not that I know of, no.
23 Q. So just doing the math -- and these are
24
25
all at the request of Shook, Hardy & Bacon?
A.
Yes.
9
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
In the cases in which you were
2 referring, has Shook, Hardy & Bacon been the
3 lawyer for any particular cigarette manufacturer
4 or any particular cigarette manufacturers, if
5 you know?
6 MR. CONGROVE:
7 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Well, Shook, Hardy &
8 Bacon often relates to Philip Morris.
9 BY MR. SALES:
10
Q.
11
12
13
14
All right.
Do you know who Shook, Hardy & Bacon
represents in the Gafney case?
A.
As far as I know, it's Philip Morris,
but primarily it's Lorillard.
15 Q. Why do you say "primarily"?
16 A. Because the cigarette that the deceased
17
18
19
plaintiff smoked primarily was Kents.
Q.
All right.
Just to do the math, then, the total
20 number of matters, if I can call them that, in
21 which you have been involved, would be five
22 prior trials prior to 2001, two trials in 2009,
23 an additional case, which is this case, Gafney,
24 which brings to us eight.
25
And if we were to add an additional six
10
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 to eight to those matters, that would take to us
2 a total of approximately 14 to 16 total matters
3 where you've given history testimony as it
4 relates to smoking and health.
5 Is that fair?
6 MR. CONGROVE:
7 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Well, I wouldn't have
8 given history or testimony in the cases that go
9 beyond the Gafney case.
10
11
12
BY MR. SALES:
Q.
All right.
You're right.
I misspoke.
Let me rephrase the question.
13
The total number of retentions, whether
14 you have yet testified by deposition or trial,
15 is approximately 14 to 16, six to eight of which
16 you have not given any testimony in, correct?
17 A. Correct.
18 Q. Does that exhaust the list of the
19 number of times you have been retained at the
20 request of Shook, Hardy & Bacon to review
21 matters of smoking and health as it may relate
22 to the customer or consumer of one of Shook
23 Hardy's clients?
24
25
A.
Yes.
MR. CONGROVE:
Object to form.
11
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
BY MR. SALES:
2 Q. Is the answer yes?
3 A. The answer is yes.
4 Q. Do you provide forensic or historical
5
testimony in other types of lawsuits?
6 A. I only have in one other case.
7 Q. What was that in?
8 A. It was a case involving the Nixon
9
estate back in 1999.
10 Q. That's the estate of Richard Nixon?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. What was the purpose of your
13
14
involvement, if you recall?
A.
The estate and library was suing the
15 National Archives to obtain a monetary value --
16 or to place a monetary value on the Nixon
17 papers.
18
And there were historians who were
19 called in to give testimony about the value of
20 these papers, both monetarily and from a
21 historical point of view.
22
Q.
And for you, talking about the
23 significance from a historical point of view of
24 these papers?
25
A.
Yes.
12
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
Q.
Not actually ascribing a dollar value
to them, I take it?
3
A.
4
No.
That would have been in hands of the
5 National Archives, or really in the hands of the
6 judge who was hearing the case.
7
Q.
I don't mean to limit you, and it's an
8 area we could speak about, I'm sure, with great
9 interest for a long time, so please don't take
10 offense, but could you briefly tell me what,
11 over the course of your academic career, your
12 areas of academic interests have been,
13 primarily?
14
A.
Yeah, they have been varied.
I haven't
15 been as specialized as some historians tend to
16 be.
17
So I have worked in American politics,
18 in U.S. foreign policy and international
19 relations.
20
21
I have worked on women's history and
women's legal status.
22
23
24
25
And I've done selective work on
American presidents.
Q.
It's stated in the disclosure that I
received that you received a Pulitzer Prize
13
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
3
nomination for a book that you wrote?
A.
Yes.
This is a book that came out last
year, which was nominated for that prize.
4 Q. What was that about?
5 A. It was on U.S. foreign policy from
6
7
Woodrow Wilson through George W. Bush.
Q.
I don't know if this is precise or not,
8 but according to the disclosure prepared by the
9 lawyers that I have received -- the lawyers for
10 Lorillard -- it states that you have received
11 several Fulbright Awards.
12 Is that correct?
13 A. Yes, it is.
14 Q. Have they been for scholarship or
15 academic work in particular, or are they
16 generalized recognition for something else?
17 A. No, they have all been for research.
18 Q. What were the -- not to embarrass you,
19 but what were the areas of academic interests or
20 the subject matters of the work that you have
21 done that have received Fulbright Awards?
22
A.
Just for the Fulbright Awards, it's
23 been in the area of women's legal history and on
24 the presidency of Richard Nixon.
25
Q.
Do you have any legal training over and
14

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 above that which someone who is interested in
2 issues of American politics and has a Ph.D. in
3 history might become acquainted with through
4 academic work?
5
A.
6
7
No.
MR. CONGROVE:
Object to form.
BY MR. SALES:
8 Q. 9 degree? 10 A. No, I don't.
11 Q. Have you ever practiced as a lawyer or
12
In other words, do you have a law
a judge?
13 A. No.
14 Q. Have you ever focused for any period of
15 time, great or small, during your academic
16 career from the perspective of a historian on
17 issues of smoking and health as they may have
18 arisen in the course of our history, that is to
19 say, American history?
20 MR. CONGROVE:
21 THE WITNESS:
22 question?
23 first part of it.
24 BY MR. SALES:
25
Q.
Object to form.
Could you just repeat the
I didn't quite understand the very
Have you ever, as a historian, focused
15
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 upon issues of smoking and health from the
2 academic point of view --
3 A. No.
4 Q. -- separate and apart from being
5
involved in lawsuits?
6 A. No.
7 Q. Have you ever taught a course which
8 concerned itself with issues of smoking and
9 health in our history, that is to say, American
10
11
history?
A.
No, only as perhaps it would be
12 generally related to the production of tobacco,
13 but not specifically on health issues.
14
Q.
It might come up in a survey course,
15 for example, to talk about the significance of
16 tobacco as a commodity in various points in time
17 in our history --
18 A. That's true.
19 Q. Is that it?
20 A. That's quite true.
21 Q. Is that an example of the kinds of
22 issues that you might have dealt with in the
23 past?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. All right.
16
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
And not to limit your answer in any
2 way, but over and above that, as a generalized
3 interest perhaps from the perspective of the
4 long view, if you will, of American history and
5 the significance of tobacco as a commodity in
6 America, have you ever taught, researched, or
7 spent any considerable amount of academic time
8 with interest on issues of smoking and health.

12 in survey classes before the Civil War on the
13 economics of the production of tobacco in the
14 United States.
15 BY MR. SALES:
16
Q.
17
18
All right.
Let's talk about the Twentieth Century
or the Twenty-First Century --
19 A. Mm-hmm.
20 Q. -- have you ever spent any time during
21 your academic career teaching about or
22 researching about issues of smoking and health?
23
A.
Well, very definitely I've spent time
24 researching smoking and health issues with
25 respect to the Twentieth Century because of the
17
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
involvement in a case like this.
Q.
All right.
I was trying to keep, for
3 purposes of this discussion, those matters
4 aside.
5
If you leave litigation and expert work
6 aside, have you ever spent any substantial time
7 during your academic career, that would be the
8 nonexpert portion of it, studying, thinking or
9 teaching about issues of smoking and health as
10 they may have appeared or occurred in the
11 Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries?
12 MR. CONGROVE:
13 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Only to the degree that
14 in teaching women's history, in covering the
15 Twentieth Century, one has to get into the fact
16 that women began to smoke more in the course of
17 the Twentieth Century, and in teaching such
18 classes, I would have to have considered the
19 cultural implications of that type of activity.
20 BY MR. SALES:
21
Q.
22
I see.
Does that area of interest include the
23 reasons for the increase in women smoking during
24 the Twentieth Century?
25
A.
Not the reasons.
It was a cultural
18
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 phenomenon mainly, and so I don't know whether
2 that would be considered a reason.
3
It's hard to indicate or to know
4 exactly why any individual smoked, but one could
5 see a cultural phenomenon taking place with
6 respect to women's smoking habits.
7
Q.
Well, what trend, or trends, did you
8 observe, let us say, with respect to the first
9 half of the Twentieth Century as it may have
10
11
related to the rate of women smoking?
A.
You can see an increase in women
12 smoking in the 1920s for cultural reasons, given
13 the innovations for women's activities which
14 were fostered and brought into vogue by the
15 so-called Flapper Age.
16
Q.
17
All right.
Are there any other reasons from the
18 perspective of history that you associate with
19 the rise of smoking among women in the early
20 part of the Twentieth Century?
21 A. I don't think so.
22 Q. Beyond the Flapper Age, has your
23 interest in that particular, discrete issue,
24 smoking and women, if I can call it that, has it
25 extended beyond, from a chronological point of
19

you, the flapper period?
A.
Not in any kind of specialized research
that I might have done.
Q.
How was it, if you can recall, that you
5 first became involved in reviewing for
6 litigation purposes issues of smoking and health
7 in America apparently sometime prior to 2001?
8 A. How did I become involved in it?
9 Q. Yes, ma'am.
10 A. I was contacted and asked in 1994
11 whether I would be interested in doing research
12 about the health hazards of smoking in the
13 United States from a historical perspective.
14 Q. 15 recall? 16 A. In this instance, it was Allen Purvis.
17 Q. Who is Allen Purvis?
18 A. He's a -- was -- I'm not sure he still
19
20
Who was it that contacted you, if you
is -- was a lawyer for Shook, Hardy & Bacon.
Q.
Do you know as among all of your
21 colleagues in the United States who are Ph.D.
22 level professors of history, American history,
23 how your name was provided or selected?
24 MR. CONGROVE:
25 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
No, I'm not sure about
20
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
that.
2
I have a vague memory that he might
3 have mentioned one of my colleagues had given
4 him my name or told him to contact me.
5 BY MR. SALES:
6
7
8
9
10
Q.
And do you recall the name of that
colleague?
A.
I was at Indiana University at the
time, and I may be mistaken, but I think it
might have been a man named Cullom Davis.
11 Q. Is that C-U-L-L-E-N?
12 A. O-M.
13 Q. O-M, like Mary?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Thank you.
16
Cullom Davis.
Have you collaborated in any way with
17 any of your colleagues at other institutions, or
18 your institution, with respect to the type of
19 activities that you have been involved in this
20 case, either by way of comparing notes,
21 exchanging information, exchanging data sources?
22 Have you done that?
23 MR. CONGROVE:
24 THE WITNESS:
25
Object to form.
Since you started out by
saying "collaborate", I'd have to say no.

6 A. No.
7 Q. Have you done any work with anyone at
8 any other institution that is related to issues
9 of smoking and health?
10 MR. CONGROVE:
11 THE WITNESS:
12 institution?
13 BY MR. SALES:
Object to form.
Anyone in any
14 Q. Yes.
15 A. The answer would be no.
16 Q. When you commented on the use of my
17 word "collaboration", was that causing you to be
18 very specific in your answer?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Well, have you -- let's just do it this
21
way:
22
23
Have you been provided with information
by any other professor of history?
24 A. Absolutely not.
25 Q. Have you exchanged information coming
22
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
from you with any other professor of history?
2 A. On?
3 Q. As it relates to issues of smoking and
4 health with an eye toward doing work for Shook,
5 Hardy & Bacon on behalf of either Philip Morris
6 or Lorillard Tobacco Company?
7 A. No.
8 Q. I have been provided with a -- well,
9
let me ask you this:
10
11
How much time have you spent in this
case?
12 A. In this case in terms of hours?
13 Q. Isn't that the way you're billing?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Well, how much do you charge?
16 A. 250 an hour.
17 Q. Is the rate the same regardless of
18 whether you are looking at documents or
19 testifying?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. How many hours would you say that you
22
23
have spent on this case?
A.
I've submitted invoices for 16 hours,
24 and have another invoice pending for
25 approximately the same number of hours.
So, it
23
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
3
would be around 32.
Q.
And what is the end date of the second
of those two invoices?
4 A. I haven't --
5 Q. I shouldn't have said the second one.
6
When did the 16 hours that would be
7 referenced in this as-yet-not-provided invoice
8 conclude?
9 July 31st?
In other words, yesterday?
June 30th??
10 MR. CONGROVE:
11 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
You're asking the date of
12 the invoice I submitted?
13 BY MR. SALES:
14 Q. No.
15 A. Oh.
16 Q. You told me you billed for 16 hours,
17
right?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. You have been paid, I take it?
20 A. Actually I was, as of yesterday.
21 Q. All right.
22
23
You have another 16 hours you told me
pending --
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. -- that you have not invoiced for?
24
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. That's true.
2 Q. What is the last time that is being --
3 the last date upon which time is being included
4 for the second set of 16 hours?
5 A. It would be as of the end of today.
6 Q. I take it that the 16 hours included
7 all of the time up to the beginning of the
8 deposition this afternoon --
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. -- or this morning for you.
11
This
afternoon for me.
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Are you able to -- you have what's been
14
called that I received, a Resource List?
15 A. Yes, I do.
16 Q. Have you had any assistance in
17 gathering the materials that are indicated or
18 described on the Resource List?
19 MR. CONGROVE:
20 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
It's a list, as you can
21 see from the disk, that's organized topically,
22 and I've indicated to the defense attorneys what
23 material I want put under each of those topics.
24 BY MR. SALES:
25
Q.
Well, my question was a little bit
25
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
different.
2
My question was kind of more a "how did
3 you get it" question as opposed to "how did you
4 organize it".
5
So, let me ask it again.
Have you been provided with any
6 assistance in the gathering of the original
7 source materials that are described on the
8 Resource List, consisting of six pages that I
9 have been provided?
10 MR. CONGROVE:
11 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
The bulk of the material
12 I have provided to the defense attorneys, there
13 might be a couple of instances where I requested
14 specific information that I couldn't obtain on
15 my own.
16
But the bulk of the material, I looked
17 at and provided to them on this subject.
18 BY MR. SALES:
19
20
21
22
Q.
Let's just -- do you have the Resource
List in front of you?
A.
I will have it in a minute.
I'm moving
to the computer.
23 Q. You don't have a hard copy of that?
24 A. We're getting one.
25
MR. CONGROVE:
Just a moment, Dave.
We
26
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 will have it.
2 got it in front of her.
I'll let you know when she has
3 (Pause.)
4 MR. CONGROVE:
All right, David, she
5 has the list in front of her.
6 BY MR. SALES:
7
Q.
8
9
10
Do you have a hard copy?
It might be just quicker to manipulate
until we have to go to the materials
themselves.
11
Do you have a hard copy, ma'am?
12 A. Yes, I do.
13 Q. Let me ask you a question.
14
In terms of the volume of the material
15 that you have reviewed in this case, how does it
16 compare, if you can remember, with the volume of
17 material that you reviewed, let us say, with
18 respect to the two Florida cases that you worked
19 on last year, or the prior cases that you worked
20 on prior to 2001?
21 In other words, did you have more to
22 look at, less to look at, or was it about the
23 same?
24
25
A.
I think I had about the same to look
at.
27
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
But in each individual case, I try to
2 make sure that the Resource List reflects the
3 either geographical area that the plaintiff may
4 have been educated in, or the geographic area in
5 which the plaintiff may have lived.
6
7
8
So I tailor each Resource List to the
individuals involved in the case.
Q.
9
All right.
If we were to focus, however -- on
10 Page 1, for example, would it be correct to say
11 that a lot of the material -- we can go through
12 them one by one perhaps -- but a lot of the
13 materials would have been included as part of
14 what you considered in prior similar cases?
15
16
17
A.
Yes, that's correct, and especially for
some of the early historical material.
Q.
All right.
18 So if we were to go to one, two, three,
19 four, five, six, seven -- the seventh item, if I
20 counted it, it's "Wright [sic], J. B.
21 'Tobacco:
Its Use and Abuse'"?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Do you remember when that was
24
25
published?
A.
It was published in the late 1880s,
28
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
3
4
1889.
Q.
And do you remember -- do you recall
why it's being included in this Resource List?
A.
It was considered -- it was a
5 relatively short pamphlet that was widely
6 distributed in the 1890s, and consequently was
7 picked up by reform groups who were agitating
8 against cigarette smoking, especially for young
9 boys.
10
So it's considered -- it's not the
11 only, but one of the more significant
12 publications about the health hazards of smoking
13 coming out in the 1880s.
14
Q.
15
All right.
And as an example to see, maybe,
16 through a window, then it will give us a preview
17 of where we're going perhaps.
18 Let me rephrase the question.
19 Can we agree that it's very unlikely
20 that Mr. Gafney ever saw the "Tobacco: Its Use
21 and Abuse" pamphlet from the 1880s?
22 A. Absolutely not.
23 Q. We cannot agree that --
24 A. No, we can agree that he couldn't have
25
seen it.
29
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
2
3
And can we agree that it is -- well,
okay.
4
5
All right.
The "absolutely not" is, we agree
absolutely that he did not see this pamphlet?
6 A. Correct.
7 Q. All right.
8
9
And so to orient us a little bit to
where we're going perhaps, the purpose for its
10 inclusion in the context of a case like this is
11 what?
12 MR. CONGROVE:
13 THE WITNESS:
14
Object to form.
I think I've answered
that.
15
It was a pamphlet that was picked up by
16 reform groups and quoted from and commented on
17 by these groups as they publicized their
18 material against smoking.
19 BY MR. SALES:
20
21
22
Q.
Well, which reform groups are you
referring to?
A.
Well, coming after the Civil War, you
23 would have had mainly reform groups that had
24 been agitating against slavery before the Civil
25 War, and then took up the cause of alcohol and
30
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 tobacco after the Civil War.
2 Christian Temperance Union being the prime
3 example.
4
The Women's
But there were other smaller groups
5 also doing this at the end of Nineteenth
6 Century, and then a few new groups came into
7 existence at the beginning the Twentieth
8 Century.
9
Q.
10
All right.
When did the temperance movement, even
11 with all of those iterations that you've
12 referred to, no longer become a factor in
13 American life, if you can recall?
14 MR. CONGROVE:
15 THE WITNESS:
16 movement?
17 BY MR. SALES:
18
19
Q.
Object to form.
When the temperance
You identified specific temperance
groups --
20 A. Groups, yeah.
21 Q. -- I'll call them, if I can, and please
22
correct me if that name doesn't seem to fit.
23 When did these temperance groups that
24 you have identified cease to act in the United
25 States?
31
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
A.
Some of them still continue to act in
the United States.
3 The temperance groups going into the
4 early part of the Twentieth Century were very
5 influential in obtaining legislation with
6 respect to sale of cigarettes, or restrictions
7 on age limits for smoking.
8
And in terms of a state like Ohio,
9 where Frank Gafney lived, it was considered a
10 hotbed of temperance reform, both in the late
11 Nineteenth Century and early Twentieth Century,
12 and the impact that that temperance attitude, or
13 reform ideas had continued down to the present
14 day in terms of the way health classes are
15 taught in Ohio, where Frank Gafney went to
16 school.
17 Q.
All right.
Well, let's break that
18 down, because that was just a little bit more
19 than I was looking for just yet, but I'm sure we
20 will have an opportunity to discuss all of
21 that.
22
What was the temperance group -- the
23 first temperance group that you identified that
24 took up as part of its calling the Wright [sic]
25 pamphlet?
32
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
You mentioned it by name.
2
A.
What was it?
It would have been quoted in some of
3 the material of the Women's Union Temperance --
4 the Women's Christian Temperance League.
5 Q. Women's Christian --
6 A. Temperance Union.
7 Q. -- Temperance --
8 A. Union.
9 Q. -- Union.
10 Okay.
11 And you named some others by name.
12
What were the other ones?
13
A.
The other one would have been the
14 Anti-Tobacco League of Lucy Gaston in the early
15 part of the Twentieth Century.
16
Q.
17
Any others?
18
19
A.
Oh, there are ones that are less
well-known.
20
21
All right.
The Anti-Tobacco Army took up this
pamphlet.
22
The individual states sometimes had
23 anti-smoking leagues that they formed on their
24 own.
25
So that you've got assorted groups who
33
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 would have been using this pamphlet at the end
2 of the Nineteenth Century and early Twentieth
3 Century.
4
Q.
When's the last time, chronologically
5 speaking, you can recall the pamphlet having
6 been cited by any temperance league, any
7 legislature, anybody, for that matter?
8
You told me a little bit before about
9 its lasting influence. I heard that; I
10 understood stood that. Thank you.
11
When is the last time you can recall
12 anyone, chronologically in time, having cited to
13 Wright's [sic] pamphlet?
14
15
A.
I can't really probably put a specific
year date on that.
16
I would say probably not after, say,
17 the mid-1920s, but I'm not absolutely sure about
18 that.
19
Q.
20
21
All right.
And the year of Mr. Gafney's birth was
what?
22 A. 1937.
23 Q. Turn, if you would, to the second
24
25
page.
A.
Okay.
34
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
Q.
There is "The Evening Capital", "The
Coffin Nails of Our Youth".
3
Do you see that?
4 A. Yes, I do.
5 Q. Now, where was "The Evening Capital"
6
from?
7 A. It was in Maryland, in Annapolis.
8 Q. What type of publication was it?
9 A. It was an evening newspaper.
10 Q. What was the date of this publication,
11
if you recall?
12 A. It's 1886.
13 Q. For purposes of orienting us in the
14 Resource List, would it be correct that the
15 numeric codes that appear in the right-hand
16 column, the first four digits of those, when
17 they are indicated, would be reflective of the
18 date of the associated item?
19 A. The year, yes.
20 Q. The year.
21
22
23
24
25
And what does the rest of the
information refer to, the 0206?
A.
It very often refers to -- well, let's
see in this case.
Sometimes they refer to the specific
35
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 date of the publication.
2 case here.
3
Q.
4
And I think that's the
Oh.
What else would it refer to?
5 A. That's about it.
6 Q. Well, obviously lower down on the page
7 with all the zeros that's covering a broad
8 period of time in many instances, no specific
9 date are given?
10
11
12
A.
Those are runs of either
newspapers or magazines, yes.
Q.
13
14
Yes.
All right.
So, is this numeric system your numeric
system, or is it someone else's?
15 A. It's simply a generic numeric system.
16 Q. All right.
17
So in every instance where there's
18 something other than zeros, to orient me, the
19 dates should refer to -- the second series of
20 four -- second four digits, digits five through
21 eight, should be the month -- should reflect the
22 month and the day --
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. -- of the particular document or
25 publication?
36
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
A.
2
3
Yes, exactly.
I'm sorry I didn't make that clear.
Q.
4
No, that's all right.
MR. CONGROVE:
I'm with you.
And Joan, you might want
5 to make sure you wait for him to finish his
6 question --
7 THE WITNESS:
8 MR. CONGROVE:
9
12
13
-- for our court
reporter's sake.
10
11
Right.
Thank you.
BY MR. SALES:
Q.
Going back to -- well, let's talk about
"The Coffin Nails of Our Youth".
14 Is that something that you found on
15 your own, or has someone provided it to you?
16
A.
17
No, I found this on my own.
Because what I do in my research is
18 try to determine popular culture of attitudes
19 or reflections on the health hazards of smoking
20 and the difficulty many people hav quitting
21 smoking.
22
And so what came up in my early
23 research was the use of slang terms, like
24 "coffin nails" or "cancer sticks", or all of
25 the ones that we're more or less familiar with.
37
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
And consequently, what I was trying to
2 determine in terms of my cultural research was
3 how far back in terms of publications,
4 especially newspaper publications, this term
5 went.
6 found.
And this was one of the earliest I
7
If you look up "coffin nails" in a
8 slang dictionary, you can find them going back
9 much earlier to more esoteric references.
10
11
But
this one was in a major city evening newspaper.
Q.
Have you, as part of your review -- I
12 mean, we're going to go through the Reliance
13 List -- Resource List in some detail.
14
Have you, as part of your review, I
15 have noticed reviewed such things as the
16 "Florida Health Notes"?
17 A. Yes, I did.
18 Q. And have you reviewed the publications
19
-- well, let me ask you this:
20
21
What is your understanding of what the
"Florida Health Notes" is or are?
22 A. The "Florida Health" publication --
23 Q. "Florida Health Notes", is what I'm
24
25
referring to.
A.
Yeah, the "Florida Health Notes", and
38
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 the notes are considered a publication, began,
2 as you can see there, as early as 1906, and
3 continue to operate on the issues of health from
4 that time forward.
5 And so when I began this case, I wasn't
6 absolutely sure -- I knew where Frank Gafney had
7 been educated, but I wasn't absolutely sure
8 whether or not his children had been educated in
9 Florida, and so I had this put in here on the
10 outside chance that it might apply to the
11 education of his children.
12
13
MR. SALES:
question, please?
14
(Whereupon, the record was read by the
15 reporter.)
16 BY MR. SALES:
17
Could you read back my last
Q.
Okay, you gave me an answer that said
18 why it might be in there, which is different.
19 So I'm just alerting you to that to let you know
20 that some of these questions have a very
21 specific purposes.
22
I am interested in everything you say,
23 of course, but I do have kind of a plan of the
24 things that I want to do.
25 can stay, just for a moment, if you would,
So let's see if we
39
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
please, respectfully, on this question.
2
3
4
What is your understanding of what the
"Florida Health Notes" is as a publication?
A.
It's a health publication devoted to
5 mainly educating children in the state of
6 Florida and the general public about health
7 hazards connected with smoking.
8 Q.
9 if you know?
10
A.
11
Who is the author or publisher of it,
I don't know.
It still continues to publish these
12 every year, and they are commented on in local
13 Florida newspapers from time to time.
14
15
16
Q.
Who is the intended audience of these
"Florida Health Notes", to your understanding?
A.
Well, as of 1964, they formed a
17 committee on smoking and health, which was
18 largely devoted to educating children, along
19 with the general public, about the health
20 hazards of smoking.
21
22
23
24
25
But the major emphasis after '64, has
been the educational system in Florida.
Q.
Okay.
Well, my question was a little bit
different.
Let me see if I can do it this way:
40
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
If I were to ask you to describe what
2 you would expect the audience, the demographics
3 of the audience of the "Florida Health Notes",
4 meaning the people who receive the document, the
5 publication, what would your best understanding
6 of that audience, from a demographic point of
7 view, be?
8 social workers, doctors, professors?
9
Children, teachers, health workers,
Who's this written for, if you know?
10 MR. CONGROVE:
11 MR. SALES:
12 question.
13 BY MR. SALES:
14
15
16
17
Q.
Object to form.
I'll rephrase the
Who, if you know, was the intended
audience for the "Florida Health Notes"?
A.
The primary audience after '64, as I
said, was the educational system in Florida.
18
But, the group also was generally
19 interested in informing the public about health
20 hazards of smoking, so they did send out their
21 publications to state legislatures -- to the
22 state legislature, to individual legislators,
23 and they were in contact with doctors in the
24 area.
25
So very generally speaking, they were
41
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 trying to get the information out.
2 said, after '64, they were concerned with
3 getting the information into the public school
4 system.
5 Q.
6
But as I've
All right.
And you have referred to the school
7 system, as the first half of your answer, as the
8 intended audience.
9
So what is your understanding, again,
10 if you could identify types of people, what
11 types of people by profession, by occupational
12 class, what is your understanding of who was
13 receiving this publication?
14
15
A.
Well, the Department of Education would
have.
16
And within the Department of Education,
17 they are becoming increasingly specialized so
18 that you have textbook division, syllabi
19 information concentrated in certain parts of the
20 Department of Education.
21 Q.
22 things.
23
I'm looking for people rather than
Who, what classes of persons, if you
24 know, would you expect to be -- either in their
25 home or their office at work -- be getting in

7 heads of it, the public officials, School Board
8 members?
9
I'm a product of the public school
10 education in Florida, and I can tell you that I
11 saw a lot of people every day I went to school.
12
So what I'm trying to find out is whom,
13 what type of persons, if you know, would you be
14 expecting to receive copies of this
15 publication?
16 MR. CONGROVE: Object to form.
17 THE WITNESS: Well, I think I've
18 answered the question.
19 BY MR. SALES:
20 Q. Was it teachers?
21 A. I don't --
22 Q. Was it teachers?
23 A. I don't think individual teachers would
24 have received the health notes themselves, but
25 they would have received syllabi from the
43
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Department of Education, and they would have
2 been given selected textbook lists based on the
3 Department of Education's reliance on some of
4 the "Florida Health Notes".
5
6
Q.
All right.
I think we're getting
somewhere.
7
So you would not have expected any
8 individual teachers, and I take it by your
9 answer, other school employees at the school
10 level to be recipients of the "Florida Health
11 Notes".
Is that correct?
12 MR. CONGROVE:
13 THE WITNESS:
14 Indirectly, yes.
15 BY MR. SALES:
16
Q.
17
Object to form.
Not directly.
All right.
In Florida, you may know this, but we
18 have county-based school systems for the most
19 part, public schools.
20 notch.
21
22
23
So, let's move this up a
In an individual county, would there be
anyone in charge of -- excuse me.
In an individual county basis, would
24 you expect any individuals within a county
25 school system to be recipients of the "Florida
44
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Health Notes"?
2 A. I don't know.
3 Q. All right.
4
5
Let's take it up a notch.
To the state.
You referred to the
Department of Education.
6
Would you be expecting individuals in
7 the Department of Education to be recipients of
8 the "Florida Health Notes" as it was published
9 from time to time?
10
A.
To the degree that they were in charge
11 of either the syllabi recommendations or the
12 textbook recommendations.
13
Q.
14
All right.
And is your information or knowledge
15 about the system such that you would be able to
16 identify, for example, by type of job, position,
17 professional qualification, the persons about
18 whom are you speaking?
19 A. I didn't do any research like that.
20 Q. All right.
21
22
The "Boca Raton News" that this gathers
is limited from 1985 to 1988?
23 A. Yes, it is.
24 Q. What was the reason that you gathered
25
the "Boca Raton News"?
45
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
A.
Well, after reading the depositions in
2 the case, it became clear that Frank Gafney and
3 his wife lived in the Boca Raton area for that
4 three-year period.
5
And even though the "Boca Raton News"
6 is not a major newspaper, I thought that in the
7 interest of comprehensive research, I should
8 take a look at it for those particular years.
9
10
11
12
13
14
Q.
Where did you get it from, that is to
say, the "Boca Raton News" that you looked at?
A.
The "Boca Raton News" is available
online through Google news.
Q.
Inconclusive, meaning all editions from
'85 to '88?
15 A. For those years, yes.
16 Q. All right.
17
18
And what were the search criteria --
did you do that yourself?
19 A. A research assistant did this for me.
20 Q. Is that somebody that was working for
21
you at Montana State?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. All right.
24
25
And what were the criteria that you
provided to the research assistant to assist you
46
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 in finding the appropriate "Boca Raton News"
2 items?
3
4
A.
Well, the criteria are somewhat
standard.
5
But in the case of the "Boca Raton
6 News", I had read in a history of Florida that
7 it was considered a kind of social newspaper,
8 and so I indicated to the researcher that I
9 wasn't sure how much substantive material would
10 be in it, and so I told her to look at those
11 three years very carefully to see if tobacco or
12 cigarette or smoking was referenced.
13
14
And that's what she looked for.
Q.
15
16
19
A.
Yes.
And including the smoke-outs, which
were fairly big events in the state of Florida.
Q.
20
21
I'm writing it down.
Tobacco, cigarette or smoking?
17
18
So, wait.
All right.
So tobacco, cigarettes, smoking or
smoke-outs.
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. All right.
24 A. And related health matters, obviously.
25 Q. Health matters that related to any one
47
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
of those four items?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. She wasn't looking up inflammatory
4 bowel disease unconnected with cigarettes, or
5 liver disease unconnected with cigarette, right?
6
A.
Unless those specific diseases would
7 have been mentioned in the articles that came up
8 under smoking or tobacco.
9
Q.
All right.
10 You said these were standard criteria.
11 Who or what standard are you referring
12
13
to?
A.
The standard that I've set for myself
14 and for this research assistant in doing this
15 kind of work.
16
Q.
17
I see.
So as we go down the list of the
18 remaining publications on Page 2, and extending
19 to Page 3, perhaps, I don't have to ask you what
20 the research criteria were for each item,
21 because the criteria would have been the same
22 that you have just described for me?
23 A. Essentially, yes.
24 Q. All right.
25
And did you perform any editorial
48
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 function over the work product of the research
2 assistant?
3
4
5
And by that, I mean, did you remove
from the articles collected articles that were
-- I'm not talking about in the instance of the
6 "Boca Raton News", but generally speaking, did
7 you perform any kind of audit function, or are
8 all of the materials that were identified by the
9 research assistants included in these resource
10
materials?
11 MR. CONGROVE:
12 MR. SALES:
13 question.
14 BY MR. SALES:
15
Q.
Object to form.
I'll rephrase the
What did you do once you received, as a
16 result of research assistant's work, the work
17 product?
18
A.
What did you do next?
I looked at it and checked it for
19 verification since I would have access to me the
20 online edition as well, to make sure that, as
21 usual, her work was quite complete.
22
Q.
Well, that's a little bit different,
23 and I guess -- so, you performed sort of an
24 audit, if you will, to make sure she was getting
25 the things that she needed to get?
49
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
A.
Well, when I don't do my own research,
2 it's incumbent that I attempt to verify the
3 research assistant's work.
4
5
6
7
And in this case, I did some spot
checking of it, yes.
Q.
What were the criteria that you applied
for yourself in doing spot checking?
10
11
All right, I think we are
getting down to it.
8
9
All right.
And if it varied from publication to
publication, please let me know.
12 MR. CONGROVE:
13 THE WITNESS:
14
Object to form.
No, it's essentially the
same for the newspapers that are listed there.
15
I obviously am aware of major
16 scientific studies which occurred beginning in
17 the 1950s, and which were publicized in
18 newspapers across the country, including
19 Florida, and so I was making double sure whether
20 the "Boca Raton News" reported on these studies
21 or not.
22 BY MR. SALES:
23
24
25
Q.
All right.
And once this spot checking, as you
referred to it, was done, how -- let me ask you
50
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
this:
2 Did you include -- I know people worry
3 about this, but can we give this person a first
4 name?
We'll just use her first name.
5
6
What is her first name, the research
assistant?
7 A. Her name is Hali.
8 Q. Did you take what Hali produced, let us
9
say, for example, from the "Boca Raton News",
10 and include all of it in these resource
11 materials, or did you reduce the total amount
12 that was provided for any reason?
13 A. No, it would have all been included --
14 Q. Okay.
15 A. -- in what she gave me.
16
17
There would be no reason for me to edit
it.
18
Q.
19
All right.
Did you ever find that there were any
20 errors, errors of omission as a result of the
21 spot checking that you performed?
22
23
24
25
A. With respect to the "Boca Raton News",
Q. With respect to any of the publications
no.
that are on this list?
51
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
A.
2
No.
I found perhaps a -- occasionally I
3 might find something that was omitted or
4 something that I hadn't known about in looking
5
-- spot checking some of the work that's done.
6
But basically the research assistant
7 performs a very competent job, and the minor
8 discrepancies that I might come up with weren't
9 that important.
10
Q.
11
12
All right.
We know that Mr. Gafney came from
Cleveland, right?
13 A. Mm-hmm.
14 Q. Yes?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. That's all right.
17
Sorry.
Everybody does it.
What Cleveland-based publications,
18 based on the information that you had been
19 provided, do you believe that Mr. Gafney would
20 have been exposed to from time to time during
21 his time in Cleveland?
22
23
24
25
A.
I know from the family depositions that
he subscribed to the "Cleveland Plain Dealer".
Q.
And are you familiar with any of the
other newspapers in the Cleveland area?
52
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
3
A.
I previous -- not in the Cleveland
area, no.
Q.
Did you see any testimony or
4 indication, for example, as to whether or not
5 Mr. Gafney was ever a reader of the "Cleveland
6 Press"?
7 A.
Not in the depositions, no.
8 Q.
Are you familiar with the "Cleveland
9 Press"?
10 A.
11 Press".
12 Q.
13
14
I haven't researched the "Cleveland
What is your understanding of the date
that Mr. Gafney moved to Florida?
A.
He began to move in 1980, and went back
15 and forth between Cleveland and Florida until
16 1986, when he and his wife became permanent
17 residents of Florida.
18
Q.
19
20
All right.
Now, the coverage begins in the
"Cleveland Plain Dealer" from 19 -- in 1944?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. And concludes through 1990, I guess to
23 sort of cover yourself because of the back and
24 forth that you just described?
25
A.
Exactly.
53
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Q. All right.
2 A. Yes, that's true.
3 Q. Who, meaning what person, obtained the
4
5
6
"Cleveland Plain Dealer" newspaper articles
that are included in your Resource List?
A.
A researcher in -- well, she lives in
7 McLean, Virginia, and she obtained the
8 information from microfilm from the Library of
9 Congress.
10
Q.
And did she, in fact, cover the
11 entirety of that period, those 46 years, from
12 1944 to 1990?
13 MR. CONGROVE:
14 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
That was the time span
15 she was given, so that the answer is yes.
16 BY MR. SALES:
17
18
Q.
Was her -- let's just give her a first
name, if we can, the McLean, Virginia lady?
19 A. Her name is Inga.
20 Q. Inga?
21 A. Yeah.
22 Q. I-N-G-A, or I-N-G-E?
23 A. A.
24 Q. I-N-G-A, all right.
25
And were Inga's directions similar to,
54
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 if you will, review all of the "Cleveland Plain
2 Dealer" every day, every edition from 1944 to
3 1990, and search for items contained in the list
4 that you previously gave me?
5
A.
Not in this case, not a day-to-day
6 search given the time span involved, and unlike
7 the "Boca Raton News", which was just a
8 three-year period.
9
Q.
10
All right.
Do you have information at your
11 disposal, or do you know what the time period
12 actually was that -- or time periods actually
13 were that she was asked to look at?
14
15
16
A.
The time periods that are given there
is the time period she looked at.
Q.
But you just told me that she was not
17 looking at every day's paper for the 46-year
18 period. 19 A. That's true.
20 Q. What days was she supposed to look for
21
22
during those 46 years?
A.
In the course of my research, in my own
23 research in other newspapers, I've come up with
24 a list of topics which have appeared in major
25 national newspapers on the subject of smoking,
55
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 and specifically in the 1950s, when the
2 scientific studies began to be publicized.
3
And so I gave her a list of these key
4 dates that were associated with major scientific
5 breakthroughs in the study on the hazards of
6 smoking, or Surgeon General's reports, or
7 anything that came up in terms of the American
8 Cancer Society that was publicized with respect
9 to the health hazards of smoking.
10
Q.
11
All right.
Well, obviously those dates are
12 important in the opinions that you have with
13 respect to this particular case, I take it?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. All right.
16
17
18
19
Tell me what they were, please.
What
were the dates that you told her to look at?
A.
I would have to have the list in front
of me.
20
But I had her start in the Forties, you
21 can see there, because I was already aware that
22 the "New York Times" and other newspapers began
23 to report on cigarette smoking in the Forties.
24
25
Q.
Well, you've told me that the dates
that you've provided were important, and they
56
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 are important to your testimony, and so in order
2 to ask you some questions about those dates that
3 you selected, I would like to know what they
4 are.
5
6
7
A.
I don't have the list here with me, but
it is, I think, approximately a 10-page list.
Q.
Well, do the best you can in helping us
8 re-create -- where is the list?
9 Let's start with that.
10
11
12
13
A.
The list is at my home in Big Sky,
Montana.
Q.
And would that be the actual list that
was given to Inga?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. All right.
16
Well, I don't know if I'm going to get
17 another chance to take your dep -- I take it
18 your home is not close to where you are now?
19 A. It's 40 miles away.
20 Q. That sounds like Montana to me.
21 So, let's just do the best we can.
22 What are the dates that you can recall
23
24
25
that you told Inga to look at?
A.
Well, I guess to start with, with the
Oschner and Debakey reports on the latency
57
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 factor between when tobacco, when a smoker
2 smoked, and when he or she may contract lung
3 cancer.
4 Oschner studies.
5
6
It would go to the Wynder and Graham
studies, the Doll and Hill studies.
7
8
9
Going into the Fifties, the Hill and
Hammond studies going into the Fifties.
Q.
10
11
12
13
14
Going on, Doll and Hill.
What's next?
A.
Well, you have a whole series of
reports coming out in the Fifties from --
Q.
notes.
15
16
So, it would start with Debakey and
I know.
I couldn't keep up with my
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
Doll.
I got Oschner/Debakey.
got Wynder and Graham?
17 A. Graham.
18 Q. I got Doll and Hill.
19
20
21
I have
What was next?
A.
Horn and Hammond.
Doll and Hill were English scientists,
22 and then Horn and Hammond were doing their
23 statistical research.
24
25
There's the government's report, the
seven experts' report in 1957.
58
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
And then you go on to congressional
hearings in the Fifties, which are also --
3 Q. Congressional hearings about what?
4 A. Well, after 1957, they were hearings
5 about how to address the topic; whether the
6 public should be better informed.
7
And in the '57 hearings, they were
8 particularly concerned with development of
9 filters for cigarette.
10
11
And in -- so that that would have been
the '57 report.
12
But Hammond and Horn came out with
13 individual studies periodically, from the
14 Fifties into the Sixties, and all of those dates
15 would have been on this list.
16
Q.
Well, I know it, and unfortunately
17 we're going to have a little bit of a difficult
18 record.
19
20
21
I had asked you for dates, and you told
me subject matters.
And I understand that that's probably a
22 mentally convenient way to try and recall what
23 it is that was of interest you, but it's not
24 going to do me very much good for my purpose.
25
So, let's back up a little bit and try
59
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
and do it again this way.
2
3
If you can, starting with the first
date beginning in -- let's do this:
4
5
6
Why was 1944 selected as the beginning
date?
A.
Because there was in the "New York
7 Times" an article referring to the Oschner and
8 the Debakey study.
9
Q.
10
All right.
Now, when you told Inga to look for
11 things on or about that date -- and I'm making
12 it up, because I don't have the list -- would
13 you say, "Start with three days before and work
14 your way to three days after"?
15 Would you say, "That date only"?
16 How can Inga know what to do when she
17 knew that there was something on an unspecified
18 date in 1944?
19
A.
What was she supposed to do?
The standard procedure was to look --
20 if I had a specific date, to look three days
21 before and three days after, because not all
22 newspapers published on the same day.
23
24
25
Q.
I just guessed on the three days before
and three days after.
Was that, in fact, what she was told to
60
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
do?
A.
Yes.
3 MR. CONGROVE:
4 MR. SALES:
5
6
9
Well, what can I tell you.
BY MR. SALES:
Q.
7
8
Good guess.
All right.
So, Oschner/Debakey, what year do you
think that was?
A.
They had a study that came out in 1939,
10 but the major one was in, I think, the year
11 1944.
12 Q. Wynder and Graham?
13 A. Again, that starts in 1950, 1952.
14 Q. All right, 1950, 1952.
15
And if I were to ask you with any more
16 precision what the dates were that you gave to
17 Inga, do you know --
18 A. No.
19 Q. -- on any of these?
20 A. No, I don't have that.
21 Q. Doll and Hill?
22 A. That would have come out in -- they had
23 one in 1950, and again in 1951 or '52,
24 corroborating what the Wynder and Graham studies
25 had said.
61

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

(212) 490-34301
Q.
2
3
4
5
6
All right.
Horn and Hammond?
A.
That study is going to come out in the
summer of 1954.
Q.
Then you went to congressional tem -- I
don't know if you said testimony -- in 1957?
7 A. Well, with the --
8 Q. I'm sorry?
9 A. With the seven experts' report that
10 came out in '57, there were the congressional
11 hearings.
12 Q. All right.
13 A. And then Hammond and Horn came out with
14
15
another study in '57 themselves.
Q.
So, with respect to like something that
16 might have been -- and I'm not saying this was
17 more major, would the three-day before or after
18 date restriction have been expanded ever?
19
A.
Not -- because I have the specific
20 dates from other newspapers when the studies
21 were reported on, there would have been no need
22 to expand it.
23
Q.
So you're telling me that there are 10
24 pages of date-restricted areas that Inga was
25 directed to look at?
62
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Yes.
2 Q. All right.
3
4
From memory, what else can you recall
after 1957?
5
6
Let's try and put a date on it, if we
can.
7
8
What would have been next?
A.
Well, in terms of the hearings took
place, and this was reported on.
9
And you have, then, the -- in that same
10 decade the American Cancer Society gets
11 involved, more actively involved, in the whole
12 question of smoking and health hazards, and
13 their activities begin to be reported on.
14
15
So, there may be some reference between
'57, let's say, and '64, to their activities.
16
But what you're building up to here is
17 the major Surgeon General's report of January,
18 '64.
19
Q.
Do you remember with any greater
20 specificity the years or dates of the American
21 Cancer Society activities that were in that
22 seven-year window from '57 to '64?
23
A.
24
25
Not specifically, no.

Q.

All right.
Surgeon General's report.
that.
I know about
That's 1964, right?
5 A. Right.
6 Q. That was a story that lasted longer
7
than three days, right?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. So was the date window that Inga was
10 instructed to use with respect to the Surgeon
11 General's report expanded for those matters?
12
A.
In the instructions that I give for
13 that '64 report, I make it clear that I want to
14 see any pre-report newspaper articles, and then
15 I always ask to see how extensively, then, the
16 report was covered itself on January 12th, and
17 then I have them look at the rest of the month
18 of January to see how many follow-up stories
19 there were.
20
21
Q.
All right.
So, if Inga was doing her job with
22 respect to the "Cleveland Plain Dealer", she
23 would have included everything through
24 January 31st of 1964, related to issues of
25 smoking and health following the publication or
64
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
release of the Surgeon General's report?
2 A. And the week before the report, yes.
3 Q. All right.
Hold on one second.
4 (Pause.)
5 I take it that if there was a story
6 that appeared in the press that described
7 comments by the Tobacco Institute or officials
8 of any tobacco company as may bear directly on
9 issues of smoking and health, those should have
10
been included, right?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. All right.
13
What comes after '64, that you recall?
14
A.
Well, again, the '64 hearings opposes
15 -- or the report posed the question about what
16 the government itself should do.
17
The '75 report didn't prompt as much
18 agitation for government action as did the '64
19 one.
20
And so what you have, then, for the
21 rest of that decade is again hearings in
22 Congress, especially with respect to putting
23 warning labels on cigarette packages.
24
25
And so the list contained references,
then, to some of these hearings and to any news
65
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 stories that might have reported on those
2 hearings and the FTC's position on warnings that
3 were being discussed.
4
Q.
Do you recall the "Cleveland Plain
5 Dealer" at any time in 1964, after the release
6 of the Surgeon General's report, publishing
7 articles suggesting that filtered cigarette were
8 less hazardous than nonfiltered cigarette?
9
10
11
12
13
Are those included anywhere in 1994 in
your materials?
A.
For that year, I'm not absolutely
sure.
But the question of filters did come
14 up, because people -- scientists simply weren't
15 sure whether a so-called "safe" cigarette could
16 be developed, and so there would be some
17 reference to filters in that regard.
18
If you think about the "Cleveland Plain
19 Dealer", they carried 14 different stories on
20 the day the report came out, and 23 other
21 stories for the rest of that month.
22
I'd be awfully surprised if the issue
23 of filter didn't come out in one of them, but
24 none of the headlines for that month
25 specifically referenced filters, I don't think.
66
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
Would you agree with me that if
2 Mr. Gafney was reading the "Cleveland Plain
3 Dealer", as the record suggests he might have
4 been in January of 1964, there's no reason to
5 think that he stopped reading it in February or
6 March, or April or June -- May, June, is there?
7 A. No, there's no reason to believe that.
8 Q. Okay.
9 A. And he couldn't have missed the stories
10
11
in January.
Q.
12
13
All right.
What else do you have for me in terms
of dates that you told Inga to focus on?
14 A. Well, as I say, the hearings --
15 Q. We were talking about 1964.
16
next?
17
18
What's
MR. CONGROVE:
You just interrupted
her, David, so...
19
THE WITNESS:
As I said, there were the
20 hearings on whether or not to have the
21 warnings.
22
There's a specific story when Johnson
23 finally signs the warning bill in '65.
24 BY MR. SALES:
25
Q.
Yes.
67
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. And then --
2 Q. What was the date that you told Inga to
3
4
look at for that?
A.
I don't know.
I think it might have
5 been in January of '65, I'm not sure.
6 was '65 that he signed the bill.
7
Q.
But it
But again, that was a six-day date
8 restriction, or a seven-day, I guess, date
9 restriction?
10
11
12
A.
Well, we know exactly when he signed
the bill and when it was reported on.
Q.
No, but I'm saying that the press that
13 Inga was told to look at that might have focused
14 on that issue was three days before and three
15 days after, right?
16
17
A.
Not for that -- for the Johnson
signing.
18 She would have looked at stories after
19 his signing that might have referenced reaction
20 to the warnings.
21 reason to look three days before, only
22 afterward.
23
24
25
Q.
But there would have been
Correct.
But the date restriction would have
been three days after, right?
68
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 MR. CONGROVE:
2 THE WITNESS:
3 Except that the editorial policy of the
Object to form.
Yes.
4 "Cleveland Plain Dealer" supported this issue,
5 and so she did pick up those editorial comments
6 from time to time.
7
Q.
Do you agree that the -- that articles
8 that appear in the editorial, the Op-Ed section
9 of a newspaper like the"Cleveland Plain Dealer"
10 carry more weight than articles, let's say, that
11 are appearing in the middle of the paper?
12 MR. CONGROVE:
13 THE WITNESS:
14
15
Object to form.
I don't think I can say
that it carries more weight.
What's significant about editorial
16 policies or statements is that it usually does
17 reflect the position of the newspaper, which
18 then has an impact on the coverage of the
19 smoking stories.
20
And in the case of the "Plain Dealer",
21 this was very clear.
22 editorial policy supported all the scientific
23 studies, and consequently, you find an abundance
24 of actual stories in the middle of the
25 newspaper, and often on the front page of the
They supported -- the
69
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
newspaper, covering these scientific studies.
2
So, editorial policy is important
3 because it reflects what is going to appear in a
4 newspaper, depending on the position of the
5 editorial.
6 Q. How old was Frank Gafney in 1959?
7 A. He was 22 years old.
8 Q. And what was the editorial policy of
9
the "Cleveland Plain Dealer" in 1959, if you
10 know, with respect to the cigarette and health,
11 cigarette smoking controversy?
12
13
A.
I don't know specifically for the year
1959.
14
I only know in reading it for the
15 period between '44 and 1990, that the editorials
16 consistently supported the scientific studies.
17 Q. What were the dates that you're giving?
18 A. Well, the dates that are there.
19 Q. No, the -- I'm not sure I understand
20
21
your testimony.
I asked you if you knew what the
22 editorial policy of the paper was with respect
23 to the smoking and health controversy in 1959,
24 and you told me, if I understand your testimony,
25 that you did not.
70
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
But then you told me then that from
2 1944 through 1990, excuse me, that the editorial
3 policy of the paper was to support all of the
4 studies that were coming out that you've already
5 described for me so far up through the 1960s.
6
7
8
9
10
Is that right?
A.
Yes.
I don't know if there was a specific
editorial from 1959.
I do know that the editorials which did
11 appear in the "Cleveland Plain Dealer" all
12 supported the scientific studies up, you know,
13 through 1990.
14 (Whereupon, a short recess was taken.)
15 MR. SALES:
I've asked counsel for
16 Lorillard to provide me with the list provided
17 to Inga in the form of date restrictions, which
18 was described as approximately a 10-page list.
19 For purposes of efficiency and economy,
20 Counsel has indicated that he will take it under
21 advisement and consider it and let me know.
22
23
24
25
How much time do you think, by the way,
that you'll need in order to do that?
We're one month away from the trial in
this case.

MR. CONGROVE:
to you by the first of next week.
3
4
5
I should have an answer
MR. SALES:
All right.
Thank you.
BY MR. SALES:
Q.
Counsel also indicated, Dr. Hoff, that
6 you wanted to -- maybe I shouldn't say correct
7 something that you said about the "Boca Raton
8 News", but you have something to add about that?
9
10
A.
Yes.
Just to clarify in terms of the
11 Resource List, once I receive the information
12 from research assistants, I look at the
13 information, the articles there, and what I do
14 is select what I think are the most
15 representative ones then to be placed on the
16 Resource List.
17
If, for example, in terms of the
18 "Cleveland Plain Dealer", there were so many
19 articles, they tend to be somewhat repetitious,
20 and so I do select, in that sense, those that I
21 think are representative of the position of the
22 paper, both for the "Boca Raton News" and for
23 the other newspapers.
24 there weren't other stories.
25
But it doesn't mean that
And I think perhaps I reacted to your
72
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
word "edit".
2
I didn't edit, but I do
3 representatively select certain stories that I
4 think reflect the position of the paper.
5
Q.
Well, you wouldn't remove in this
6 process that you have just described an article
7 just because it was bad for the position taken
8 by the lawyers that hired you, right?
9
A.
10
No, very definitely not.
And especially, I never remove
11 headlines which refer to these tobacco
12 industries commenting on the scientific
13 reports.
14
15
Q.
All right.
Now, we were -- I don't know how else
16 to do -- I really think, and I don't mean to be
17 disrespectful, but I really think that we could
18 shorten this portion of the examination,
19 particularly with an eye toward hopefully
20 getting the "Inga list", I'll call it, if you
21 would try and concentrate -- and I understand
22 and appreciate your comments, but if you would
23 try and focus on the dates themselves, and as
24 briefly as possible, identify them with an event
25 in going forward beyond the time that the
73
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Labeling Act was under consideration, all right?
2 Can you try and do that for me?
3 I'm not being critical, but I'm very
4 concerned, since I only have the afternoon here,
5 to get done in a prompt fashion.
6
So, will you work with me while we're
7 focusing on the "Cleveland Plain Dealer" to try
8 and focus first on the date.
9 information, I'll ask it, okay?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. Is that okay?
12
If I need more
All right.
So what date, approximately, are you
13 associating with the activities that you're
14 referring to the Labeling Act?
15
16
17
A.
1960 something?
Well, Johnson would have signed it in
'65, and that was reported on.
And then, of course, the Cleveland
18 paper did indicate in some of its stories what
19 the reaction to the ruling was, or to the
20 legislation.
21 And then, of course, almost immediately
22 in the late Sixties, you have criticism that the
23 warnings weren't strong enough, and you end up,
24 then, with another piece of legislation that's
25 going to change the warning as of what?
1969.
74
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
Q.
I got another idea, because that
doesn't seem to work, what I just suggested.
3 I got '65.
4 Did anything happen in 1966 that you
5
asked Inga to look at, that you can recall?
6 A. Not that I can recall.
7 Q. Did anything happen in 1967 that you
8
9
asked Inga to look at, that you can recall?
A.
Not that I can recall, except for the,
10 again, ongoing hearings and questions about
11 whether the labels were strong enough.
12 Q. 1968?
13 A. No.
14 Q. 1969, you've already mentioned to me
15
one thing.
16
Anything else that you can recall that
17 you asked Inga to look at in 1969, other than
18 what you've told me?
19
A.
There may have been one or two other
20 scientific reports, but I can't recall anything
21 specific.
22 Q. 1970?
23 A. There, you're getting into the animal
24 studies with beagles who were subjected to
25 cigarette smoke in '70 and '71.
75
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
Q.
Do you think that was reported in the
"Cleveland Plain Dealer"?
3 A. I know it was.
4 Q. Okay.
5 All right.
6 '72?
7
A.
I'm just not thinking specifically what
8 might have occurred in '72, but I know that
9 there were articles for that year.
10
Q.
11
12
I'm going to take bigger chunks of time
now.
13
14
15
All right.
Let's say '73 to '75, does anything
stand out that is likely on the Inga list?
A.
What you have by that time is, again,
16 the statistical studies become increasingly
17 large for this time period, and you have PSAs
18 which are being broadcast on television, and on
19 some occasions, the stories will reflect the
20 PSAs.
21 And beginning in '76, they begin to
22 reflect the smoke-outs which were being held
23 across the country.
24
25
Q.
All right.
So from '76 to '80, then, we have
76
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 smoke-outs.
2 would have been on the Inga list?
3
A.
What else that comes to mind that
Mm, you're getting into some of the,
4 oh, question about whether there should be
5 restrictions, especially at the city and state
6 level.
7 and ultimately in restaurants.
8
Of free smoke areas in public buildings,
Q.
9
All right.
In 81 to '85, anything that stands out?
10 A. There, you're getting into a lot of --
11 Q. We're focusing on the "Cleveland Plain
12
13
Dealer".
A.
14
Yeah.
-- a lot of stories with respect to
15 whether the airlines should start to restrict
16 smoking, and that receives quite a bit of
17 attention.
18
And so does, in the last half of the
19 Eighties, the whole question of whether or not
20 to ban all smoking ads.
21 were, of course, still appearing in the
22 Eighties, and that becomes a topic that's
23 covered extensively.
24
25
Q.
Because the print ads
'86 to '90, anything that stands out as
part of the Inga list relating to the "Cleveland
77
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
3
Plain Dealer"?
A.
Well, '86 to '90 is this whole issue of
whether they should be banned.
4
And, of course, you have periodic
5 Surgeon General's reports, '69.
6 every other year, you have a Surgeon General's
7 report.
8
9
10
11
And almost
So you have a major one in '86, a major
one in '88, but you have previous ones that are
commented on and reported on.
Q.
12
All right.
So part of your date restrictions for
13 Inga would have included brackets around the
14 time of the Surgeon General's reports?
15 MR. CONGROVE:
16 THE WITNESS:
17
18
Object to form.
Yes.
BY MR. SALES:
Q.
The date restrictions provided to Inga
19 on the list previously referred to include
20 bracketed time periods for the publication of
21 the Surgeon General's reports?
22 A. I don't quite -- bracketed --
23 Q. I asked the same question by curing the
24
25
objection, I think, if there was one?
A.
Yes.

the Ohio Department of Health in the 1950s?

I would have known by 1950 what the
18 textbooks that were in use and what the syllabi

the Ohio Department of Health?
6 A. No.
7 Q. Do you know what the responsibility --
8 I'll represent to you that there's something
9 called an Ohio Director of Health.
10
Were you aware of that?
11 A. Not -- no, I wasn't.
12 Q. Do you know what the position of the
13 Ohio Director of Health was with respect to the
14 smoking and health controversy at any point in
15 time, let us say in the 1950s?
16 A. No.
17 Q. All right.
18
Let's go, if we could, please, to the
19 Florida newspapers that are included.
20 like to take them in groups for the moment, if I
21 can, the "Fort Lauderdale News", the "Sun
22 Sentinel" and "Palm Beach Post".

From the information that you were

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
particular newspapers?
A.
There's no indication that he read the
3 "Fort Lauderdale News" or "Sun Sentinel" from
4 the depositions.
5
Q.
6
7
8
All right.
What about the "Palm Beach Post"?
A.
There's no clear reference in the
depositions about the "Palm Beach Post".
9
I included it simply because they lived
10 in the area, and I wanted to make sure that I
11 simply wasn't relying on the "Sun Sentinel",
12 which was the major newspaper for where they
13 lived.
14 Q. Where did they live?
15 A. Well, they lived in a variety of
16 places. 17 Q.
In Boca Raton --
Well, you have got from '80 to '90,
18 "Sun Sentinel".
19 to '90?
20 A.
Where did they live from '80
I don't know specifically where they
21 lived, but I know they were living in that part
22 of Florida.
23
24
25
Q.
Well, what part of Florida are you
talking about?
A.
The Palm Beach area and the Boca Raton

area.
Q.
Well, I'm not quarreling with you, but
3 how did you determine that the "Sun Sentinel"
4 was the major newspaper for whatever area it was
5 that they were living at any point in time?
6
7
A.
Because it was the largest newspaper
for that part of Florida.
8 Q. Says who?
9 A. You have the "Miami Herald" being the
10 kind of dominant paper for Florida, but within
11 the region where they lived, the "Sun Sentinel"
12 was the most commonly read or subscribed to.
13 Q. And that's Palm Beach and Boca Raton?
14 A. Mm-hmm.
15 Q. Yes?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. Well, what is the source of that
18 information?
19
Why do you say that?
I've lived here my whole life, so I may
20 have a different idea.
21 again, what is the source of your information
22 that suggests that wherever it was that they
23 lived that the "Sun Sentinel" was the dominant
24 paper?

21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Some people might read all three
23
papers, right?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. Some people might just read one of
83
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 them, right?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. And some people, you know from the time
4 you spent in New York City, are committed
5 "New York Post" readers and don't read the "New
6 York Times", right?
7 MR. CONGROVE: Object to form.
8 THE WITNESS: No, I don't know
9
10
personally, no.
BY MR. SALES:
11
12
13
14
It's --
Q. Well, you would expect that, wouldn't
A. Well, I read the ""Post"" and the
you?
"New York Times".
15 Q. You must be a sports fan.
16 A. No, I'm -- I like the gossip.
17 Q. Very well put.
18
What I'm getting at is, you don't know,
19 sitting here today in the context of this
20 deposition, which of the newspapers that are
21 included for these Florida newspapers,
22 "Fort Lauderdale News", "Sun Sentinel" and
23 "Palm Beach Post" were most read by persons
24 inhabiting the geographic area that
25 Mr. and Mrs. Gafney lived at any particular
84
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
time, true?
2 A. I think that's true, yes.
3 Q. All right.
4
Because if I were to represent to you
5 that people in Palm Beach, for example, read the
6 "Palm Beach "Post"" more than they read the
7 "Sun Sentinel", since you mentioned Palm Beach,
8 you won't have any way of knowing one way or the
9 other, would you?
10 MR. CONGROVE:
11 THE WITNESS:
12 And I wouldn't know if what you just
13 said is true.
14 BY MR. SALES:
15
Q.
16
17
That's the "one way or another" part,
right?
A. Yes.
19 Q. All right.
20
22
No.
Right.
18
21
Object to form.
What were the -- why is the "Palm Beach
Post" limited from 1980, from 1980 to 1984?
A.
Again, because of the indication in the
23 depositions that they were moving around from
24 different houses or different apartments in that
25 time period, and all I wanted to do was see what
85
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 a local newspaper like that would have to say on
2 the topic.
3
I was just including it to be as
4 comprehensive about information out there in the
5 public domain on the hazards of smoking.
6
Q.
Were the search criteria used for the
7 ""Post"", the "Fort Lauderdale News" and the
8 "Sun Sentinel" similar to what you have
9 described to me earlier in terms of providing
10
11
the research assistant with key dates?
A.
Yes, except for the "Sun Sentinel" --
12 well, yes, true for the "Sun Sentinel" for the
13 1980s and 1990 period, yes.
14
15
16
Q.
What about "USA Today", why is that
included from 1987 to 1990?
A.
There was a reference, though it was a
17 vague one, I think it might have been in the
18 interrogatory, that "USA Today" may have been
19 read by the family.
20
Q.
21
22
23
All right.
Who gathered the "Wall Street Journal"
selections?
A.
The "Wall Street Journal" selections
24 were gathered by two researchers.
25 who did an online search through ProQuest to see
One was Hali,
86
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 what was available for the "Wall Street
2 Journal".
3
And the other was by Inga, who actually
4 looked up the "Wall Street Journal" in the
5 Library of Congress.
6
Q.
Is there a difference to those that are
7 not available online versus those that are
8 available?
9
A.
Well, I wanted to make sure about that,
10 because there were time restrictions on what was
11 available online for the "Wall Street Journal".
12
And so I -- since it was specifically
13 mentioned in the deposition that he read the
14 "Wall Street Journal" off and on, I wanted to
15 kind of cover my bases on it to see what was
16 available for a larger time period than Hali
17 could find online.
18
Q.
Was the method used for gathering the
19 "Wall Street Journal" otherwise the same as
20 that used for gathering the "Cleveland Plain
21 Dealer"?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Was it, again, a key date function?
24 A. Yes, it was.
25 Q. And is the list of key dates the same
87
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 list that is in the list that you have at home
2 40 miles away?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. Except, obviously, that the geographic
5
scope is 10 years shorter?
6 MR. CONGROVE:
7 THE WITNESS:
8 The list may remain the same, but the
9
Object to form.
Yes, it is in this case.
"Wall Street Journal", as a business
10 publication, did not pick up on the scientific
11 studies until 1954.
12 BY MR. SALES:
13
Q.
14
15
All right.
And was the "Wall Street Journal" work
done for this case?
16
That's obviously a paper that could
17 apply to more than one smoking and health case
18 if the smoker were a "Journal" reader.
19
20
21
A.
No, it was -- I had previously looked
at the "Wall Street Journal" for other cases.
Q.
All right.
22 And again to leave the "Wall Street
23 Journal", that's a key date approach, again,
24 or -- correct?
25
A.
Yes.
88
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
Q.
"New York Times", that work had been
done previously, I take it?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. And was that also a key date approach?
5 A. No, it was -- I originally did the
6 research in the "Times" from the late Nineteenth
7 Century through the 1940s myself.
8 had a researcher do the Forties through 1990.
9
And then I've
And the "Times", being the newspaper on
10 record over the years, the research that was
11 done was done yearly, year by year by year every
12 day.
13
Q.
So, the "New York Times" articles that
14 you have should reflect all, then, stories that
15 fit one of the four categories that you
16 previously described for me that relate to
17 issues of smoking and health?
18
19
A.
They will be representative of those
stories, yes.
20
Obviously they're a segment, because it
21 would take up hundreds of pages just to do all
22 the stories in the "New York Times".
23 Q.

Q.
Have you read the depositions of the
wife in this case?
3 A. Yes, I have.
4 Q. All right.
5
And I just want to make sure I
6 understand.
7 it sounds like, has read, or looked for articles
8 on smoking and health from the "New York Times"
9 for every daily edition continuously for
10
110-year period.

For the "New York Times", somebody,
Am I --
MR. CONGROVE:
Object to form.
BY MR. SALES:
13 Q. Am I right on that?
14 A. You're basically correct.
15
16
17
I did it myself personally, and had a
researcher do it, as I said, after the 1940s.
Q.
And you would not have excluded,
18 through what has sort of previously been
19 referred to as sort of an editing function, any
20 stories that were adverse to the position taken
21 by the lawyers who hired you in this case, I
22 take it?
23 MR. CONGROVE:
24 THE WITNESS:
25
Object to form.
No, I'd never exclude
them.
90
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
But keep in mind, I am selecting
2 representative samples which would reflect the
3 position of the tobacco companies.
4
Q.
So there might be "New York Times"
5 stories that reflect the position of the tobacco
6 companies that are not included in the actual
7 materials on the disks that I received?
8
9
10
11
A.
Yes.
It's a representative sampling.
There would have been thousands of these stories
over that time period.
Q.
12
All right.
"Better Homes & Gardens", does the
13 record in this case reflect whether Mr. Gafney
14 was ever a reader of "Better Homes & Gardens"?
15
A.
16
He certainly wasn't.
But his wife did indicate that she may
17 have subscribed to "Ladies Home Journal", and
18 consequently, since I try, as I said, to
19 personalize these cases as much as I can, I
20 included other women's publications on this
21 list, since if she read "Ladies Home Journal",
22 she might have also seen or looked at copies of
23 "Better Homes & Gardens", and "Good
24 Housekeeping".
25
Q.
I'm a little confused.
91
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
There's no record in this case that
2 Mr. Gafney ever read "Better Homes & Gardens",
3 right?
4 A. No, there isn't.
5 Q. There's no record in this case that
6 Mrs. Gafney, his wife, ever read "Better Homes &
7 Gardens"?
8 A. That's true.
9 Q. All right.
10 And we can leave that one.
11 "Consumer Reports" -- well, let me ask
12
you this:
13
Was "Better Homes & Gardens" gathered
14 for a prior case, or was that done specifically
15 for this case?
16 A. It was done for a prior case.
17 Q. All right.
18
"Consumer Reports", is there record
19 evidence in this case that either of the Gafneys
20 was a "Consumer Reports" reader?
21 A. No, there is not.
22 Q. Was that material that was gathered for
23
24
25
a prior case?
A.
Yes, because they periodically came out
with their own independent studies of
92
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
cigarettes.
Q.
3
4
5
6
All right.
With respect to their relative safety,
one versus the other?
A.
filters.
7
It concerned safety.
It concerned
It concerned tar and nicotine levels.
They did -- which surprised me when I
8 first did the research, they conducted their own
9 tests on cigarettes from very early on through
10
11
the Eighties.
Q.
12
All right.
"Good Housekeeping".
I take it from
13 your earlier answers that there's no evidence in
14 this case that either Mr. or Mrs. Gafney were
15 readers of "Good Housekeeping"?
16 A. That's true.
17 Q. And I take it, then, if I understand
18 your prior answers, that work was probably done
19 for another case earlier on?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. And "Ladies Home Journal", if I
22 understand your testimony, there's no
23 information that Mr. Gafney was a reader of
24 "Ladies Home Journal", but there is an
25 indication that Mrs. Gafney might have had
93
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 readers -- excuse me, "Ladies Home Journal" from
2 time to time?
3
A.
Yes, by her own testimony.
4 And because she was so interested in
5 the topic of health and cigarettes, she might
6 have read the specific "Ladies Home Journal"
7 articles.
8 to read those because of her own concern.
She might have sought them out, even,
9 Q. She might have what them?
10 A. Sought them out.
11 Q. I don't remember that, but maybe you
12
remember something about that.
13 Is there evidence in this case that
14 Mrs. Gafney ever did research over and above
15 what she had available to her in order to
16 convince her husband that he should not smoke
17 cigarettes?
18 MR. CONGROVE:
19 THE WITNESS:
20
21
Object to form.
I don't quite know what
you mean by "research".
She presented to her husband articles
22 about -- on health, and she presented to him
23 information she had received both during her
24 nursing training and as a surgical nurse from
25 the time of their marriage forward.
94
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
That indicates to me she had a strong
2 interest in the topic, had a very strong
3 interest in getting him to stop smoking, and if
4 she subscribed to the "Ladies Home Journal", it
5 seems logical to me, she might have paid
6 considerable attention to the articles there
7 about the health hazards of smoking.
8
9
Q.
Well, there were a lot of "might
haves", and that's what I'm trying to pin down.
10
I think you and I are saying the same
11 thing actually.
12 to me previously, like Mrs. Gafney, by virtue of
13 her work experience and her own interests, had
14 plenty of information that she used, to the
15 extent that she could, to try and persuade her
16 husband not to smoke.
17
It sounds to me, and it sounded
Do you agree?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. And there's no indication, therefor,
20 that she went out and sought out additional
21 information over and above what she had as a
22 result of her own interests and her work, right?
23 MR. CONGROVE:
24 THE WITNESS:
25
Object to form.
Well, we started out by
using the term "research".
95
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
I'm not sure that she necessarily went
out and did any kind of formal research.
3
But to get back to the "Ladies Home
4 Journal", it would seem logical to me, given her
5 interest in the topic, and the fact that she
6 wanted her husband to stop smoke being, that she
7 would have looked at those articles in "Ladies
8 Home Journal" that referenced the subject.
9 BY MR. SALES:
10
Q.
Have you accepted as accurate
11 Mrs. Gafney's representations with respect to
12 her communications with her husband about the
13 matters that I have just spoken about?
14 MR. CONGROVE:
15 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Well, it comes from a
16 formal deposition.
17 choice to assume that the answers were not
18 honest.
19 BY MR. SALES:
20
Q.
21
I don't have much of a
All right.
And what did you learn from
22 Mrs. Gafney's deposition about Mr. Gafney's
23 responses to the statements about smoking and
24 health that were brought to his attention by his
25 wife?
96
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

(212) 490-34301 A.
2 things.
Well, I learned a number of different
3 The starting point seems to be when
4 they were married when she specifically says
5 that she pleaded with him to stop, and she
6 continued to do that throughout the marriage.
7
She does indicate that at times, when
8 she would present this material to him,
9 especially perhaps with reference to the 1964
10 Surgeon General's report, he would counter that
11 he had read articles that disputed the Surgeon
12 General's report, or that disputed these other
13 scientific reports.
14
Q.
Have you similarly accepted those
15 statements as to the communications between her
16 and her husband as accurate?
17 MR. CONGROVE:
18 THE WITNESS:
19 under oath can be.
20 BY MR. SALES:
21
Q.
Object to form.
As accurate as memory
Well, I mean, you're not throwing out,
22 for example, what Mrs. Gafney says her husband
23 said, but accepting what she says that she said,
24 right?
25
A.
No, I'm not throwing out what she says

he said, or what she says herself.
Q.
3
All right.
"Life Magazine".
I take it that the
4 "Life Magazine" work had been done for prior
5 cases?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. Is there anything -- go ahead.
8 A. There is some, I think a reference in
9
10
11
12
the interrogatory that they may have looked at
"Life Magazine".
Q.
well, skip that.
13
14
"Newsweek" -- and did "Life" focus --
"Newsweek", I take it that that work
was done for prior cases as well?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. And was there any indication in this
17 case that either Mr. or Mrs. Gafney were
18 "Newsweek" readers?
19 A. No, there is not.
20 Q. "Reader's Digest".
We have all seen
21 these before.
22 cases, true?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. And was there any indication that the
25
This work has been done for prior
Gafneys were readers of "Reader's Digest"?
98
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. No.
2 Q. "Senior Scholastic", there is -- that
3
takes us all the way to 1983, right?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. When is your best estimate of when
6 Mr. Gafney would have no longer been in high
7 school?
8 A.
9
10
He would have graduated, I think, in
1954.
Q.
Can we agree that the readership of
11 "Senior Scholastic", generally speaking, is
12 school-aged children readership?
13
14
15
16
A.
Yes, it is.
It's largely limited to
seniors.
Q.
And this work has been done for prior
cases as well?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. Same, "Time Magazine", the work has
19
been done for prior cases as well?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. Was there any date restriction as to
22 the articles that were obtained from "Time
23 Magazine"?
24 MR. CONGROVE:
25 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
No.
Those were collected
99
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 over the years and were fairly easy to track
2 with respect to subject of smoking.
3 BY MR. SALES:
4
Q.
5
All right.
So those should include all "Time
6 Magazine" articles that fit within the
7 generalized categories that you have provided?
8
A.
9
Yes.
There would have been representative
10 samples of those articles on the Resource List,
11 yes.
12
13
Q.
Were these folks readers of "Time
Magazine"?
14 A. Not that I know of.
15 Q. "US News & World Report", again, this
16
17
has been done for other cases?
A.
Yes.
But there is some indication, I
18 thought in the interrogatory, that they may have
19 read "US News & World Report", but it wasn't
20 clear to me.
21 Q.
22
23
24
25
All right.
And do you remember if that was
Mr. or Mrs?
A.
That would have been -- I think it came
from his wife, but it would have been indicated
100
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
3
that he read it.
Q.
Had you been provided with the record,
the school records of Mr. Gafney?
4 A. The "school record" meaning?
5 Q. Well, like his grade school transcript,
6 assuming it has been obtained by one or more of
7 the party.
8
9
His high school transcript, middle
school, whatever has been obtained, if anything?
10 A. No, I have not.
11 Q. Do you know what kind of high school
12
Mr. Gafney attended?
13 A.
14 school.
15 Q.
16
He went to a segregated Catholic high
When you say "segregated", what do you
mean?
17 A. By sex.
18 Q. Do you know if the high school that he
19 attended was a user of -- or distributor of the
20 "Senior Scholastic" magazine?
21 A. No, I don't know that.
22 Q. Now, in this case, do you intend to
23 express opinions with respect to the curriculum
24 content for the high school that Mr. Gafney
25 attended?
101
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
A.
I have looked at syllabi and guidelines
2 for the state of Ohio, actually for a previous
3 case, but also specifically for this case.
4
5
Q.
All right.
My question was a little
bit different.
6
I asked whether with respect to
7 Mr. Gafney's parochial high school, you intend
8 to express opinions as to the contents of the
9 curriculum, any part of it, that he followed in
10 high school?
11 A.
Yes, I think I could say that the
12 syllabi for the health classes when he attended
13 school were fairly uniform, both for parochial
14 and secular schools.
15
Q.
16
All right.
Starting at the state level first, what
17 is the source material upon which you rely for
18 figuring out what the syllabi or other
19 curriculum requirements were?
20
A.
Well, I rely on periodic state
21 legislation referring to specific topics that
22 are taught, and these go back all the way to
23 1913, and they are upgraded or revised
24 periodically.
25
The syllabi lists are similarly
102
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 upgraded and revised, and so are the textbook
2 lists.
3
Q.
4
All right.
But we're only talking about one man
5 today, okay?
6 A. Right.
7 Q. All right.
8
9
10
I want to talk about Frank Gafney.
And
he only went to school, high school -- we will
start with high school.
11
For the years that he went to high
12 school, he didn't go to high school in 1980, so
13 I don't want to talk about anything that the
14 state of Ohio or its parochial schools is doing
15 in 1980.
16
Are you with me?
17 A. I'm with you.
18 Q. Just to save time.
19
So what I would like to do first is,
20 using the reliance materials or resource
21 materials that you have, is I would first like
22 to -- we're going to go from top to bottom, if
23 we could.
24
25
I would like you to identify for the
relevant time period that Mr. Gafney was in high
103
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 school the source materials upon which you rely
2 first that came from the state level?
3
A.
Well, as you'll see on the Resource
4 List, the information -- let me -- I'm taking a
5 look at this.
6
Q. "Legislation" starts on Page 3, but the
7 content doesn't actually appear until Page 4.
8 It is just the heading.
9 the way through Page 5 -- through the middle of
10
Page 5.
11
12
13
14
And it continues all
That's the part that says
"Legislative".
A.
Well, yeah.
That's a different
heading.
15
The educational material is under
16 "Educational Material", and includes, then, the
17 textbooks and the syllabi for the Forties and
18 Fifties that would have been relevant for when
19 he was in school.
20
Q.
21
All right.
Those aren't -- that's III on Page 3?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. All right.
24
25
That's got two headings that include
apparently more than one item apiece.
One for
104
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Ohio, and one for Florida, right?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. All right.
4
Where in the disks will I find the
5 material, the actual materials themselves, the
6 Ohio materials?
7
8
9
A.
Under "Educational Material".
that heading.
Q.
Well, I have four disks -- or I have
10 four folders that I received.
11 one "Deposition", one "Reliance".
12
13
One "Background",
If I open that up, I have "Audio",
"Books", "Pamphlets", "Educational Materials".
14
15
Under
Is that where I should go?
A.
Yes, go to "Education". Go to that
16 folder, and then you will see the Florida
17 materials, which aren't so relevant here.
18 Q. I'm in the Ohio materials.
19 A. Yeah.
20 Q. It looks like there's a section --
21 there are laws that date from as early as 1803
22 and go all the way through it looks like 1991.
23
24
25
A.
Yes.
But the relevant ones begin in 1913,
when they take on this question.
105
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
The legislation was passed in 1988, but
2 they begin, then, to enforce it in the school
3 system beginning in 1913, I think.
4
Q.
5
Slow down a little bit.
What is the first statute upon which
6 you rely for whatever opinions you're going to
7 express?
8
9
Let's identify it.
MR. CONGROVE:
Object to form.
BY MR. SALES:
10 Q. 1913?
11 A. I would say that that's -- given my
12 reading about the state system, that set in
13 motion the strict requirements with respect to
14 syllabi and textbooks for the state, continuing
15 down to the present.
16
Q.
17
All right.
I'm looking at the disk materials that
18 I have been provided, and they're
19 chronologically -- they appear to be
20 chronologic?
21 A.
Yeah -- go ahead.
22 Q.
They are in two parts.
23
I'm sorry.
The first part, their date, one starts,
24 it looks like 1903 and ends in 1997.

That's one
106
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com

2
The next one starts in 1853 and
concludes in 1991.
3
4
5
6
7
8
Which one should I be looking at to
find the 1913 law that you referred to?
A.
that up.
Q.
It might be the 1912, if we could bring
Let's see what it is.
"Manual: Uniform Course of Study for
the Elementary Schools of Ohio".
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. Are you able to read yours?
11 A. I can, with some difficulty.
12 Q. All right.
13
14
Is there a particular page that I
should be looking at?
15
16
Hold on one second.
I know this is not high school, but I'm
sure we're going to get to that.
17 A. Yeah, you're looking --
18 Q. So just so that you're with me, this is
19
20
21
22
not a statute, would you agree?
A.
25
This is a
syllabi.
Q.
23
24
Yeah, this is not a statute.
All right.
What is it that you want me to look at?
A.
Well, the early health classes came
under the heading of "Physiology and Hygiene".
107
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 And so what you see here for 1912 is
2 the beginning, then, of this approach to -- a
3 more systematic approach to the teaching of this
4 subject matter.
5
Q.
Well, the only -- I haven't had a
6 chance to read every page of every one of these,
7 but I did read this one, and the one that I saw,
8 the reference to cigarettes that I saw is, in
9 fact, at the end of the very first page, Page
10
147.
11
12
I cannot read the section number, but
it says,
13
"Class section" -- can't
14 read it -- classifies a
15 child under 17 who uses
16 cigarettes to be a
17 'delinquent child' and
18 amenable to the law.
19 Whatever that means.
20 Prohibits the selling,
21 giving or furnishing to any
22 child under 18 years of age
23 cigarettes, cigarette
24 wrappers, cigars or leaf
25 tobacco -- I can't read it
108
(212) 279-9424

www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 exactly -- under penalty of
2 law."
3
With the exception of the parts that
4 are illegible, at least on my copy, did I read
5 that correctly?
6 A. I think you did.
7 Q. Is that what you were referring to?
8 A. Yes.
9
Again, what this elementary school
10 document has picked up on is the position taken
11 back in 1888 of the idea that teachers had to be
12 concerned and were to look for students in the
13 classes who may smoke, as is referenced here,
14 and then specifically how to teach them about
15 the health hazards.
16
Q.
17
All right.
Well that sound like more than I read.
18 Where is the part that you're reading from? I
19 haven't seen that yet.
20
A.
Well, if you look at Page 153, where
21 they refer to the "effects of alcohol and
22 narcotics".
23
24
25
Q.
Upon --
I found Page 153.
Above where it says
"Music"?
A.
Just above where it says "music".

Well, who considered cigarettes to be
narcotics in 1913?
10 A. The state of Ohio, and the --
11 Q. Where is that?
12 A. Well, as I said, this came out of the
13 fact that by 1913, the state of Ohio had been
14 trying to ban the sale of cigarettes to
15 children.
16
So there was a general atmosphere of
17 reform in the state, and it had an impact on
18 what was being taught about alcohol and
19 narcotics.
20 period to include cigarettes under the heading
21 of a narcotic.
22
23
Q.
It was commonplace in this time
Well, I'm a little confused.
You told me, when we read this together
24 just a moment ago, that narcotics, included
25 among the class of narcotics referred to by this
111
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 section E on Page 153, that cigarettes at the
2 time were considered narcotics.
3
And I asked you according to whom?
4 That's what I would like to know.
5 considered cigarettes to be narcotics?
6
Who
And if your answer is, the state of
7 Ohio did, I would like you to direct me to
8 something prior to the publication of this item,
9 which is the 1913 -- excuse me, 1912 syllabi, as
10

Let's start over.
What document that is published by any
20 governmental body prior to the publication of
21 this 1912 document refers to cigarettes or
22 contents of cigarettes as narcotics?
23 A. Some of the textbooks would have.
24 Q. Well, now I'm even more confused.
25
You told me that the state of Ohio
112
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 considered cigarettes to be narcotics, and I'm
2 trying to find out, not from the publication of
3 a textbook, but where the state of Ohio, prior
4 to the publication of this document in 1912,
5 excuse me, referred to the cigarettes, or the
6 contents thereof, as narcotics.

12
A.
Is there a regulation?
Is
As I recall, prior to 1913 the state of
13 Ohio, as I said, considered banning the sale of
14 cigarettes, but did have -- did place
15 restrictions on -- age restrictions on the sale
16 of cigarettes to young people.
17
And I can't specifically recall now,
18 but I know of other states doing this, and did
19 in their discussions of legislation, refer to
20 cigarettes as a narcotic.
21
Q.
Can we agree that there are many
22 activities which are forbidden to children by
23 law that do not involve the use of narcotics?
24 A. Yes.

113
(212) 279-9424

My question remains, can you point me

4 reflects that from the perspective of the state
5 of Ohio, any governmental body that you choose
6 to describe, that the state of Ohio considered

The answer could be, I can't think of

If you know?
Well, I thought that -- I indicated
14 that there would have been legislation coming
15 out of the late Nineteenth Century where the use
16 of the term "narcotics" would have been there.

9
I want to see something, if you can
10 show it to me, that supports your opinion that
11 when we read "narcotic", we should include that
12 in that mindset, even though just pages above
13 when they mean cigarettes, they say
14 "cigarettes", that below where they refer to
15 cigarettes, when they say "narcotics", we should
16 think cigarettes, too.

I would like you to show me -- to start

I would like you to show me something

If it
I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but
23 the list on this page alone in this window, has
24 60, 70 items.
25
A.
Maybe more.
Well, I'm looking now at the Ohio state
115
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 laws, and I'm trying to find the right page for
2 us here.
3 Q. What year are you looking at?
4 A. I'm looking at 1879, but --
5 Q. The school law?
6 A. Revised Statutes of the General
7
8
9
Assembly.
Q.
I have Ohio school laws from revised
statutes, Part 2nd, Title III, 1879.
12
13
14
Is that different from what you're
looking at?
A.
No, I think that's the same thing.
15 (Pause.)
16 Well, I don't -- I'm not seeing it
17
18
19
20
there.
Q.
I see the section "when German language
to be taught".
A.
21
Yeah.
Well, I don't think I know right now
22 where it is, so I can't really answer your
23 question.
24
25
I
think I'm looking at the wrong thing.
10
11
Okay, if you find it, let me know.
Q.
All right.
We started this when we were trying to
116
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 find the sources for -- from the top to the
2 bottom, we're starting at the highest level
3 first, the legislature, I guess, the sources
4 upon which you are going to rely to express an
5 opinion ultimately about the materials that
6 would have been used in parochial school in
7 Cleveland.
8 So, let's back up.
9 I've seen the 1913 -- 1912, rather,
10
document you asked me to look at.
11
12
13
What would be the next thing that I
should look at?
A.
I think what's relevant for this case
14 are the textbooks that were used in the state
15 when Frank Gafney was in school.
16
17
Q.
Right.
And I most respectfully to let you see
18 where I'm going, I've done this before, and I
19 had a parochial school case before, and
20 sometimes we get into quarrels -- this is for
21 information, not for the jury -- quarrels about,
22 How do you know?
23 were being used?
24
25
How do you know which books
And so what I'm trying to find, going
from the top to the bottom, is the sources that
117
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 you are going to rely to tell me, "I can tell
2 these are likely the books that Mr. Gafney,
3 among the classes of books -- because I've done
4 this before -- that Mr. Gafney might have been
5 exposed to."
6 So let me start over.
7 So are you going to, at the time of the
8 trial in this case, identify certain school
9 textbooks at various grade levels about which
10 you may give an opinion that Mr. Gafney saw
11 them, or may have seen them?
12 MR. CONGROVE:
13 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Yes, specifically with
14 respect to high school textbooks, there were a
15 half of dozen or so that were used in the state
16 of Ohio.
17 BY MR. SALES:
18
Q.
19
All right.
And what I'm trying to find out is,
20 where it is that you get that information from,
21 and you've directed me to a 1912 document so
22 far, and we've already had a discussion about
23 that.
24
25
What beyond that do you have that will
allow us to identify how we get -- how we can
118
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 draw a line from the state to Mr. Gafney, if you
2 will?
What have you got?
3 MR. CONGROVE:
4 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Well, we have a list of
5 the textbooks that were used in the state.
6 BY MR. SALES:
7
Q.
8
All right.
And who specified that list?
9 A. What do you mean, "who specified it"?
10 Q. Who is the author of the list of the
11
books?
12 A. The authors of the textbooks?
13 Q. No.
14
15
Who created the list?
A.
16
For Ohio.
This list I researched back in the late
17 1990s, and then updated it for this particular
18 case.
19
But I received the information on this
20 case, for this particular case, from the
21 defendants' lawyers.
22 Q. Do you mean the facts about the case?
23 A. No, the actual legislation, for
24 example, from the Superintendent of Cincinnati
25 Public Schools, and information on the
119
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com

textbooks.
Q.
Cincinnati?
I'm totally confused now.
3 Let's back up a little bit.
4 Is there a list of books that you're
5
using to identify the textbooks?
6 A. Yes, I have a list of authors.
7 Q. All right.
8
Where is it?
Are they in materials?
9 A. Yeah, I'm just --
10 Q. Let's go back to the main menu.
11 "Audiovisual", "Books", "Pamphlets", "Posters",
12 "Educational Materials", "Legislative",
13 "Litigation", "Newspapers", "Magazines", "Other
14 Materials".
15

I have -- I had, on the disk I was
16 using, a list of textbooks for the state, and
17 I'm not being able to locate it right now on
18 this particular computer.
19 Q. Well, how can I look at it?
20 A. (No response.)
21 Q. Who created the list that you're
22
23
24
25
looking at?
A.
This particular list was created, as
you see it here, by the defense attorneys.
Q.
All right.

5 court reporter has the list of resource
6 materials.
7
And David, I'm confused now, too, as to
8 what list Dr. Hoff is talking about, so I think
9 we do need to --

material is presented on the disk.
19

20 the late 1990s, and I have looked at textbooks
21 which were recommended for the 1940s and
22 Fifties --

9 referenced the textbooks particularly.
10

would, please?

So what I would like you to do, and
8 stay if you could, please, focused on this
9 question.
10
Do you have a list that is generated by
11 someone other than a lawyer of what you think
12 the state of Ohio required or suggested,
13 whatever term you would feel comfortable with,
14 in terms of textbooks that might have been used
15 by Mr. Gafney?

the books just yet.
20
21
Yes, I have hard copies of these
How did you figure out what books were
to be looked at?
22 A. I --
23 Q. Somebody said something on a piece of
24 paper somewhere, "We're going to use this book."
25 We recommend this book."
"We use one of these

"This book's required."
Is there something like that?
A.
To the best of my knowledge, I think
4 there is.

It's just that I'm having trouble
6 Q. Is it a statute? Is it a regulation?
7 A. It would --
8 Q. Is it what you referred to previously
9
10
11
12
as a "syllabi"?
A.
It would have been in some of these
syllabi and guideline reports.
Q.
13
All right.
Well, I would like to spend the time,
14 whatever time is necessary -- it's now 3:00, my
15 time -- to find the source material upon which
16 you relied for identification of the textbooks.
17
18
19
Where should we look?
A.
Well, I'm not sure that I can answer
that right now.
20 Q. Do you believe it's a statute?
21 A. I believe it comes -- the specific
22 reference to textbooks I'm quite sure comes from
23 the syllabi or the guidelines for the classes.
24
25
Q.
Who is the author, meaning what
educational office, what governmental entity,

(212) 490-34301 what bureaucrat, if you know, is the producer or
2 publisher of this list?
3 MR. CONGROVE:
4 THE WITNESS:
5 It would have been coming out of the
Object to form.
I can't say right now.
6 Department of Education after 1913 -- or 1912.
7 BY MR. SALES:
8
Q.
9
10
All right.
Well, let's try and see if we can find
it.
11
Would it most likely be in the folder
12 that's been provided to me that's identified as
13 "Educational Materials"?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. All right.
16
Can we agree that it's unlikely that it
17 would be inside the folder, given our
18 discussion, that's marked "Florida Materials"?
19 A. That's true.
20 Q. Can we agree that if we opened the
21 "textbook" folder, the "textbook" folder, in
22 fact, contains, at least on appearances of the
23 names of the documents included, the actual
24 books themselves, or portions thereof?
25
A.
Yes.
125
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
That leaves us, if you have what I
2 have, one folder that's called "Materials",
3 right?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. All right.
6
That's the folder that we were looking
7 at before when we found our way to the 1913
8 document -- excuse me, 1912 document that
9 contains a reference to "delinquent children who
10
use tobacco", right?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. All right.
13
Now, if you look at some of the
14 shorthand that appears on these, there is
15 something called -- there are things called
16 "Bibliographies".
17 called "Acts". There are things that are called
18 "School Laws". There are things that are
19 called "Statutes".
20
There are things that are
And I don't know if I've exhausted all
21 of the types of heading, but those are the types
22 of things that are included in this folder,
23 right?
24
25
A.
Yes, they are.
And your -- I'm looking at pdf files,
126
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 which don't have, at the moment, all of that
2 detail.
3
But, for example, you could look up the
4 "1937 high school standards.pdf", which comes
5 after the "Ohio 1936".
6
Q.
7
8
9
All right.
I have that.
Is there something in this document you
want to direct me to?
A.
Well, we'll see.
10 (Reviewing document.)
11 THE WITNESS:
12
Can you make it a bit
larger?
13 (Reviewing document.)
14 There is a reference to teachers at the
15
end of the "Health" section on page 173.
16 Q. Yes, ma'am.
17 A. Yeah, and I'm having trouble reading
18
the print myself.
19
20
21
MR. CONGROVE:
Can you enlarge that?
BY MR. SALES:
Q.
I don't know how big your screen is,
22 but the magnification of 300% seems to work
23 pretty well.
24 A.
25
Okay.
Yeah, I think -- let me see.
127
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

(212) 490-34301
Q.
I don't think this is, respectfully, a
2 list of textbooks.
3 look at it, you may disagree.
4
When you have a chance to
But it looks -- to me, this is a series
5 of references for teachers, just like it says,
6 of things that might be consulted for further
7 information --
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. -- about the matters referred to.
10
Do you agree?
11 A. That's what it appears to be.
12 Q. All right.
13
So, so far, does this look like it has
14 anything to do with smoking and health or
15 cigarettes?
16 MR. CONGROVE:
17 THE WITNESS:
18 section, no.

Not this particular
All right.
Well, if you see something else
somewhere in the document, let me know.
A.
There is later on in the document --
24 let's see if I can get a page.
25 -- that starts to talk about the smoking.
It is Page 250
128
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
And then it begins, and it suggested at
2 the end issues of information and references.
3 There, you will find some of the textbooks
4 listed.
5 Sorry it took me so long to find that
6 reference, but these state reports aren't that
7 easy to read initially.

13
Well, it looks like -- on mine, what I
Does yours?
A.
I think it does.
When we get to the
seventh grade texts on 251, yes.
Q.
So, do we even know by the time we get
14 to Page 250, if we're still talking -- do we
15 know if we were talking about -- if we were
16 talking about -- what grade were we talking
17 about on page 235?
It says 12 to 14.
18 A. Yeah.
19 Q. Anyway, what happens between pages 235
20
21
and 250, do we know?
A.
You get health instruction later on in
22 the reference to the 7th grade, and that's what
23 we're looking at now, on 250, 251.
24
25
Q.
All right.
So it looks like, putting everything
129
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 together the best that we can under these,
2 respectfully, difficult circumstances, it looks
3 as those in 1935 -- 1937, there were a set of
4 Ohio High School Standards, right?
5 A.
6 school.
7 Q.
Well, the high school and grade
Well, I'm just referring to the name of
8 book and name of volume, and assuming that it's
9 put together correctly, right?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. That appeared to include some
12 discussion of 7th grade and issues relating to
13 children 12 to 14 years of age, to make it
14 simple, right?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. And is it your suggestion -- and I'm
17 not quarreling with you -- that there is a
18 suggestion of topics of discussion that are
19 selected at the beginning, at the end of Page
20 250 and continuing on Page 251 for some grade
21 level, putting it all together, perhaps persons
22 in approximately what we would now call junior
23 high or middle school?
24 MR. CONGROVE:
25 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Yes.
It looks to be the
130
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 case once you get to Page 250.
2 BY MR. SALES:
3
Q.
4
All right.
And if I understand your prior
5 testimony, you believe that sources of
6 information in references include some of the
7 textbooks which I assume are included in the
8 other window?
9 A. In the -- On Page 251?
10 Q. Yes?
11 A. Yeah.
12 Q. All right.
13
Those are textbooks, yes.
So from that, can we conclude that it
14 looks like, to bring us full circle, that the
15 state's Department of Education is recommending
16 included in what you referred to as the
17 "syllabi" -- I call it "syllabus" for one -- a
18 syllabus for instruction for someone
19 approximately in the 7th grade, the matters that
20 are contained at the end of Page 250 and the
21 beginning of Page 251?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. All right.
24
25
Have you examined the actual textbooks
that are referenced here?
131
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Yes, I have.
2 Q. Do you believe --
3 A. Not all of them, but I've looked at the
4 Andrus, the Burkhardt.
5 the list.
6
Q.
7
8
11
All right.
Is there any reason why you looked at
some but not others?
9
10
I think Wilson was on
"Helpful Living" comes up, and so does
Burkhardt.
A.
12
I've seen those.
Yeah.
Andrus and Burkhardt and Wilson -- I'm
13 trying to think -- Williams, are standard
14 textbooks that I've seen in other states that
15 were -- seemingly to me as I've looked at these
16 textbooks, particularly effective ones in
17 presenting the material.
18
Q.
19
Okay.
I have a few more questions about
20 this.
21 was useful to do what we just did, thank you,
22 but I don't need you to walk me through the
23 textbooks.
And I can do that.
I don't need -- it
24 But so the jury, if we need to do this
25 later, understands, what you are telling us is,
132
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 that if we were to take Burkhardt, for example,
2 and go to the referenced chapter, that would be
3 an illustration of the types of messages that
4 might have been delivered through that textbook
5 as part of this instruction on tobacco to
6 someone in approximately the 7th grade, to make
7 it simple?
8 MR. CONGROVE:
9 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I can't say specifically
10 that in this case, that that textbook would have
11 been seen by Gafney, but it was one of the
12 recommended textbooks.
13 says about tobacco products.
14
Q.
15
And I do know what it
All right.
Now, do you -- as you pointed out
16 earlier in your deposition, these textbooks are
17 amended from time to time, right?
18
19
20
A.
Yes, they're -- people who write
textbooks update them periodically.
Q.
And school districts -- before we do
21 that, you said something before about
22 Cincinnati.
23
24
25
What were you referring to, the school
district of Cincinnati --
A.
It happened to be a Cincinnati document
133
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 about what was being referenced there for
2 information on health and hygiene.
3
Q.
Do you happen to know how the Ohio
4 school system was broken up -- leaving parochial
5 schools aside for the moment -- in terms of its
6 governance, whether it was town schools, county
7 schools, and so forth?
Do you know?
8 A. No, I don't specifically know that.
9 Q. All right.
10
Do you have -- is there -- in addition
11 to textbooks being updated periodically, the
12 state periodically updates its suggested or
13 approved texts, right?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. All right.
16
What we were looking for before -- and
17 I understand what you have done with this
18 document, thank you.
19
What I was asking you to look for
20 before, was that I've seen them in other states,
21 something from the Department of Education or a
22 local school board that says, "Thou shalt use
23 textbook A, B, C or D for the following subject
24 matters."
25
Have you come across anything like that
134
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
in connection with your research for this case?
A.
No, I haven't.
I've just come across
3 what you have seen here, references to standard
4 textbooks.
5
Q.
I am going to ask you about the
6 applicability of these documents to the
7 parochial school system in Ohio.
8
9
Is your knowledge about the
relationship between the state and the
10 governance of parochial schools such that you
11 can tell me whether or not the document that
12 we're looking at, which is this 1937 document,
13 would be effective for or incumbent upon for use
14 of parochial schools of the state of Ohio?
15
A.
16
I can't tell you specifically that.
But I know, for example, that in the
17 state of New York and in the state of
18 California, and here in the state of Montana,
19 the parochial schools have for some time, and
20 going back to the Thirties, at least, used those
21 textbooks that were recommended for public
22 schools.
23
Q.
Do you know -- and this may be a legal
24 question, and I apologize.
25 it's objected to.
If it's objected to,
135
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
But do you know from a legal point of
2 view if the state can require a parochial school
3 to teach particular subject matters or discrete
4 subjects to parochial school students?
5
6
Do you know if our Constitution and our
system of governance permits that?
7 MR. CONGROVE:
8 THE WITNESS:
9
10
Object to form.
No, I don't.
BY MR. SALES:
Q.
I have seen in other cases documents
11 that purported to be documents produced by
12 Catholic school organizations, or Catholic
13 school publications that included themselves
14 lists of approved or suggested publications for
15 certain subject matters.
16
17
18
Have you ever seen such documents in
the context of this kind of research?
A.
No.
19 MR. CONGROVE:
20 THE WITNESS:
21
22
Object to form.
No.
BY MR. SALES:
Q.
Have you researched whether in this
23 case the Catholic schools in Ohio, for example,
24 had their own sets of approved lists for
25 instruction on matters of smoking and health?
136
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. No, I have not.
2 Q. Can you conceive of circumstances where
3 parochial schools may want to provide different
4 instruction as to matters of health that may be
5 communicated differently in the public school
6 system?
7 MR. CONGROVE: Object to form.
8 THE WITNESS: That's a difficult
9
question to answer.
10
For the state of Ohio, which, as I have
11 already indicated, had such a strong history of
12 reform and reform groups, most of whom were
13 Protestant groups, a Congregationalist and the
14 Methodists and the German Lutherans.
15
I would think that that kind of
16 pressure coming from those groups on the subject
17 of health and the hazards of smoking might have
18 of been brought to bear on the Catholics in the
19 state in terms of what was being taught in those
20 schools.
21
I can't cite a document showing that,
22 but I can put into context the question you
23 asked about the position of Catholic schools
24 with reference to these other very strong
25 Protestant reform groups.
137
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
Well, I asked you a little bit of a
2 different question, because we're talking about
3 textbooks, and I asked you if you could conceive
4 of circumstances, perhaps unrelated to smoking
5 and health, where a Catholic school
6 organization, a particular diocese, or the
7 church itself, might say, "We don't want to use
8 a health book that's used in the public school
9 system, and we have our very good reasons for
10
saying so."
11
Can you conceive of circumstances in
12 this day and age where the Catholic school, the
13 Catholic church might do that or say that?
14 MR. CONGROVE:
15 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I can conceive of it as a
16 hypothetical.
17 possibility for the 1930s, '40s and '50s in
18 Ohio.
19 more correct for today.
20 BY MR. SALES:
21
I think it's less likely to be a
Perhaps it would be more of an issue or
Q.
22
All right.
I am not Catholic, and my knowledge of
23 the way the Catholic schools run is more to do
24 with working on these cases than anything else,
25 I think.
But let me ask you a few questions.
138
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Do you have a generalized understanding
2 of how the Catholic school system, such as it
3 existed in Ohio, was running in the Forties and
4 Fifties?
5 MR. CONGROVE:
6 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Do I have a general
7 understanding, did you say?
8 BY MR. SALES:
9 Q. Yes.
10 A. No, I don't.
11 Q. Do you know if, in fact, there was a
12 body or an organization which was called upon to
13 make selections about which school books to buy
14 for parochial school students in the Catholic
15 schools in Ohio?
16 A. No, I don't.
17 Q. All right.
18
For middle school, or before we get to
19 high school, do you have anything later that's a
20 document similar to this, the 1937 document?
21 A. There --
22 Q. Because we are right, we are bumping up
23 on, you know, Mr. Gafney didn't go to junior
24 high for a little bit after this, right?
25
A.
That's true.
139
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

(212) 490-34301
2
Q.
that.
3
So some of the books changed; we know
So, what else have we got?
A.
You have got a later list of textbooks
4 that would go through the Forties and Fifties,
5 or when he was in school.
6
Q.
7
Where is that?
8
9
All right.
A.
Let's see.
That's the state laws.
I'm
trying -- let me try maybe 1944.
10
This is again a Department of Education
11 document on progress of -- progress report, and
12 it has a segment on "Health and Narcotics".
13
And this gets us back to the idea of
14 whether tobacco was considered a narcotic, and
15 it is in this particular report.
16
Q.
17
18
All right.
Well, I'm trying to stay focused, if I
can.
19
Well, what I'm looking for is something
20 that would include references to or lists of
21 school books.
22 A. Okay.
23 Q. So that's what I'm trying to find.
24 A. Again, I think it would be -- again be
25
under some kind of suggestions for references or
140

All right, David, we are
MR. SALES:
All right.
Glad to hear.
BY MR. SALES:
Q.
Dr. Hoff, before I get back to that,
6 one of the terms that I've seen referred to in
7 some of these documents from the state of Ohio
8 while we were on the break is a term called
9 "stimulant", and the recommendation that
10
students be taught about "stimulants".
11
12
13
Is that a term that has meaning to you?
A.
movement, "stimulus" does have meaning to me.
14
15
16
Mm, in terms of the temperance
I don't know if it has specific
reference to this case or not.
Q.
Do you know if cigarettes, or nicotine,
17 I would say more specifically, should be
18 considered as a stimulant in the context of
19 looking at documents like this from the state of
20 Ohio?
21
22
A.
I think it could be.
And if the word were used, it would
23 probably be in connection with these health
24 classes and teaching about narcotics and
25 cigarettes.
142

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
Right.
2 The school textbooks that are included
3 on the disks that I was provided here, let's go
4 to that for a moment, if we can.
5 make you switch.
6
7
Let's see if we can do this in an
effective way.
8
9
You have got a file called "Textbooks",
right?
10 A. Yes, I do.
11 Q. I count 27 in total.
12
13
I'm sorry to
Are all of those potentially in play,
so that we can save time?
14
And by that, I mean are all of those
15 books that are potentially books, based on your
16 knowledge, training and experience and review of
17 the materials that you have been provided in
18 this case, books that might have been used in
19 grade-appropriate classes for Mr. Gafney?
20
A.
21
Not all of them.
I singled out a few from the suggested
22 reading list from this general national textbook
23 list.
24
25
Q.
And the reason I ask that, is that this
happened before in these cases where the
143
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 reliance list that the particular researcher
2 listed as a historian might have literally a few
3 hundred textbooks, and then when you drill down
4 and try and find the source material, as I have
5 been asking you to do, it turns out that the
6 ones that are considered to be what I call "in
7 play", are substantially smaller in subset than
8 all of those that are listed.
9
10
And it sounds like the same is true
here.
11
12
MR. CONGROVE:
Object to form.
BY MR. SALES:
13 Q. Is that correct?
14 A. I think that's generally true for this
15
16
case, yes.
Q.
Let's jump ahead, because we're going
17 to go back to try and find lists of books in a
18 moment, but looking at the "Textbook" folder, do

Is the same true for you?
5
A. It's at the bottom of the third column,
7 Q. The bottom of the third column.
8 A. Yeah.
6
9
yes.
As you would see if you had
these listed as pdfs, which we do here, that at
10 the bottom -- if you go across, it's at the
11 bottom of the third column.

13
Q.
Well, my columns might not be the same
as yours.
14 A. Yeah, I know.

Now, that's pretty specific.
17
18
A.
No.
See, we're not getting this on
this computer.
19 Q. All right.
20 A. But if you look across the bottom, I
21 have a Wilson textbook listed for '48 and
22 for '45 and for '43.
Is that --
23 Q. I've got four Wilsons on mine.

5 and have to deal with it, I'll figure out a way
6 to deal with it.

Okay.
The ones that I --
Q.
Can we start with Andrus at the top and
go down through them?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Would that work for you?
13 A. Andrus is definitely one that was
14 listed in these documents as suggested
15 textbooks.
16
And Burkhardt was --
17 Q. All right, let's stop there.
18 A. Yes.

20 A. Yeah.

We're just bringing it up.
A.
You're talking about the top, the
1941?
7 Q. Yeah.
8 A. Okay.
9
Okay, I'm looking at Safety Every Day,
10 Andrus.
11 Q.
I suppose it could be middle school,
12 but the kid's got a safety patrol on the cover,
13 so I'm thinking like 6th, 7th grade, do you
14 agree, probably?
15
16
A.
No, I can't -- I can't really say just
because of the cover --
17 Q. All right.
18 A. -- but I'm going -- for '41 -- let's

He couldn't possibly
There is later pictures of people
playing football.
7
And I'm also -- having looked at these
8 before, I'm also judging by the size of the
9 print, which looks to be bigger, and the
10
content.
11 A. Well, I can't speculate about that.
12 Q. All right.
13 A. It is --
14 Q. So this could be a high school book, as
15
far as you're concerned?
16 A. I don't know.
17 Q. All right.
18
The second Andrus book I have is called
19 Helping the Body in its Work, and it has a
20 copyright date of 1949.
21
Do you also have that?
22 A. Yeah, we do.
23 Q. And is that one of -- so, are both of
24 those Andrus books referenced in the Ohio
25 materials, or just one of them?

You have three Burkhardt books, right?
12 A. Yes.

Are all of them in play?
15 A. They could be, yes.

Going down alphabetically, before you
get to Wilson, we have quite a few others.
19
20
21
Any others?
A.
24
25
The ones -- I jumped to Wilson because
it was in one of these suggested lists.
22
23
I'm sorry.
And then another one in the suggested
list was Neumaier.
Q.
And --
I'd like to point out also something to
you on your resource, in your resource
149

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 materials, that these four -- if you go to the
2 middle, there's some that say "OH", and then
3 Andrus, Safe Day, 1941.
4 "OH", which I assume refers to Ohio.
5 Does that help refresh your
6 recollection at all as to how these might have
7 been assembled?
8 there.
9
A.
10
11
12
Because Neumaier is also
And Neumaier has the symbol.
And for the most part, I believe they
are referring to the suggested textbooks.
Q.
13
Okay.
So all of the ones -- in addition to
14 the ones we reviewed, all of the ones that are
15 listed that have the "OH" in front of them are
16 probably in play.
Do you agree?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. All right.
19
20
That takes us to Turner and Williams.
How about those?
21 A. No, for this case.
22 Q. And the Wilson books, you've already
23 told me, it's possible that all four of those
24 are in play?
25 A.
Yes.
150
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Q. All right.
2 A. It's possible, yeah.
3 Q. All right.
4
Are you with me?
Now let's go back, if we could.
Let's
5 go back to the materials which include the
6 statutory content, all right?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. I have found another place where
9
there's a discussion -- well, let's ask you.
10
Where else can we look to try and find
11 the places that would support the choices that
12 we Have just went through?
13 way.
14
Let's do it that
Sitting here, are you able to find any
15 of those other places that would support those
16 choices?
17
I'm not quarreling with you as to the
18 choice.
19 corroborate it.
I would just like to be able to
20 And to save time, if the answer is, no,
21 not without going through and then finding them,
22 that would be fine, too.
23 A. Then the answer is no.
24 Q. All right.
25
Is there any back-up documentation or
151
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 other information that you have that supports
2 the way in which this data was gathered?
3
And by "data", I mean the calling balls
4 and strikes, if you will, as to which textbooks
5 make it on the "in play" list that you and I
6 have just assembled for each other.
7
8
In other words, do you have any back-up
notes or other information on that?

MR. CONGROVE:

THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Do I have personal notes?
BY MR. SALES:
12 Q. Yes.
13 A. No.
14 Q. How was it -- was it exclusively by
15 looking at the materials contained in the
16 "Materials" folder that allowed you to assemble
17 the textbooks that are included in the
18 "Textbook" section of these materials?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Or did you have any other resources?
21 A. No, at the time that I went through
22 these, a list, which is proving problematic
23 right now, I did find the suggested textbooks'
24 titles and authors.
25
Q.
All right.
152
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 What was the reason -- and if you could
2 state it briefly, that would be great -- what is

5 will say, for Florida?

I thought that had been excised from
All right.
And did you later conclude that they
did not?
14 A. Yes, I did.
15 Q. All right.
16
So in order -- at least now, and things
17 could change, but you don't anticipate talking
18 about any Florida laws or syllabi, as you refer
19 to them, or other educational materials at the
20 time of trial?

(212) 490-34301 A. No, I have no plans, no.
2 Q. Without going through them -- if we go
3 to "Audiovisual Materials", without going
4 through them individually, are you able to
5 provide me with information about the specific
6 audiovisual materials that you may be commenting
7 on at the time of trial?
8 A. Not right now.
9 Q. In other words, if I were to ask you
10 which movie clip, which PSA, which cartoon, do
11 you know?
12 A. No, I don't.

MR. SALES:
All right.
BY MR. SALES:
Q.
There's a Section V, "Legislation",
19 which includes legislative enactments from a
20 variety of states.
21
I take it that those relate -- the
22 subheading indicates, at least as to Subsection
23 A, to the various states and the history of
24 those states insofar as they may have enacted
25 laws to prohibit cigarette sales all together,

2 like --
3 A.
Yes.
4 Q.
-- generally?
5 A.
That's correct.
6 Q.
What is the general opinion that you
7 have about -- well, let me ask you this:
8 What is the significance of the
9
prohibition, or partial prohibition of tobacco
10 sales from time to time in the various states in
11 this country as it relates to the Gafney case?
12
A.
It shows the influence of these reform
13 groups in the early part of the Twentieth
14 Century, which were so active in the state of
15 Ohio, which, in turn, then, influenced the
16 teaching of health and hygiene in Ohio.

Q.

BY MR. SALES:
Q.
So you were explaining to me, Dr. Hoff,
22 the significance of the prohibition and
23 temperance laws in other states.
24
25
Have you explained to me what relation
they bear to Mr. Gafney in his wife's case here?

A.

3
Well, as I --
MR. CONGROVE:
Objection, form.
Asked
and answered.
4
THE WITNESS:
As I said at the very end
5 of my last answer, the state of Ohio was a
6 particularly active reform state going into the
7 Twentieth Century.
8 And consequently, the list that you see
9 under "Legislation" shows the success of that --
10 those reform groups in temporarily, at least,
11 prohibiting the sale of cigarettes.
12 Ohio considered it six different times,
13 from about 1899, I think, until 1912, and failed
14 to pass it.
15 that was concerned enough to go to the state
16 legislature for such legislation.
17 BY MR. SALES:
18
Q.
But it also was one of the states
What was the motivation, if you
19 understand it -- if you know, I should say --
20 what was the motivation behind those particular
21 legislative enactments?
22 to accomplish?
23 MR. CONGROVE:
24 THE WITNESS:
25
What were they trying
Object to form.
The laws that prohibited
the sale reflect the fact that the particular
156
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 state had received information from these reform
2 groups about especially the impact of smoking on
3 young children, especially boys, and that it
4 wanted to enact legislation to protect their
5 health.

growth?
11
I mean,
Stunt their
They couldn't be a hockey star?
I mean, what?
What was the concern of
12 the temperance groups as it related to young
13 boys in particular, if you know?
14 MR. CONGROVE:
15 THE WITNESS:
16
17
Object to form.
Well, much of what you
said.
The legislation, in some instances, was
18 specifically referencing the impact on specific
19 organs of the body.
20 stunting growth, but that was not one of the
21 major reasons.
22
Sometimes it referred to
It generally was that cigarette smoking
23 was simply bad for young children, and the best
24 way to protect them would be to ban the sale of
25 cigarettes to them.
157
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
2
All right.
But bad in what way, I guess?
Do you
3 have any greater recall than what you've already
4 told me?
5
How was it bad for them?
6 A. In terms --
7 Q. What I'm trying to find out, what could
8 stimulate people to be so concerned about
9 cigarette use in children, what about it that
10 would stimulate them to consider, even in those
11 early days, passing laws to prohibit its sale to
12 children?
13
14
15
A.
I think I have answered that.
They had
concerns about the health of children.
In some cases, they were specifically
16 concerned about immigrant children who may have
17 come from families that smoked.
18
19
20
And so there were a variety of reasons
that went into this legislation.
But all of the legislation, as does a
21 good deal of legislation today at the state
22 level, reflects the lobbying activities of
23 various interest groups.
24
25
And in this time period, these
anti-smoking groups were quite active.
158
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
Can you be any more specific as to the
2 specific health concerns that were being raised
3 at the relevant time that you're talking about?
4
You mentioned organs, but didn't name
5 an organ.
6 the like.
You haven't mentioned a disease, and
7 What I'm trying to find out is, what
8 were people saying could go wrong if children
9 smoked? 10 MR. CONGROVE: Object to form.
11 THE WITNESS: I -- I think I've
12
answered the question.
13
In terms of their general health as
14 members of a society, it was thought that
15 cigarettes were particularly harmful to
16 children, and that's what this legislation was
17 directed at.
18 BY MR. SALES:
19
20
21
Q.
I've heard everything you've said, and
I'm paying very careful attention.
I really am.
But when somebody says something is
22 harmful to children, my first thought is, "Okay,
23 I accept your concern.
24 harmful."
25
Tell me how it's
If you told me salt is bad for me, and
159
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 I had never heard that before, I might want to
2 know how.
3
So what I'm asking you is, with respect
4 to the persons engaged in lobbying the state of
5 Ohio at the time period about which you have
6 been speaking, to curtail or eliminate tobacco
7 use by children, what specific health risks were
8 they worried about, if you know?
9
MR. CONGROVE:
10
THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Generally, they were
11 concerned about all kinds of health risks, but
12 none -- no specific disease, let's say, as
13 specific as lung cancer or bronchitis.
14
They were simply referring very often
15 to lack of breath, lack of stamina, effect of
16 the respiratory system.
17 that's how they were presenting this information
18 to the state legislatures.
19 BY MR. SALES:
20
21
22
23
24
25
Q.
In very general terms,
All right.
And if I understand your testimony,
please correct me if I'm wrong, those laws were
-- well, let me rephrase the question.
Were those laws, or laws of that type,
ever, in fact, passed in Ohio?

(212) 490-34301
2
3

6
7
A.
No.
I said before they attempted about
six times and were unable to pass the law.
Q.
What was the reason that they were
unable to gain passage, if you know?
A.
They simply didn't get enough of the
legislators to go along with this idea.
Q.
And what is the last date upon which,
8 as you recall, those type of legislative
9 activities, lobbying activities, were taking
10
place in Ohio?
11 A.
12 was in 1922.
13 after the first world war.
14
15
I think, if I'm correct, the last one
I think it was sometime right
And they started in 1906.
Q.
16
All right.
Is it your opinion that there was a
17 long-lasting effect on the public mindset in the
18 state of Ohio that carried through after
19 prohibition ended in the United States,
20 prohibition of alcohol, that is, let us say into
21 the 1940s and '50s.
22 MR. CONGROVE:
23 MR. SALES:
24
25
Object to form.
Let me reask the question.
BY MR. SALES:
Q.
You told me before that the temperance
161
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 movement associated with efforts to ban tobacco
2 was, at least in part, associated with
3 temperance movements associated with the
4 elimination of the sale of alcohol in this
5 country.
6
Is that true?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. And in fact, were the proponents of
9
temperance, vis-a-vis alcohol, successful in
10 encouraging officials of the government of this
11 country into various federal and state levels to
12 amend our Constitution so as to prohibit sale of
13 alcohol in this country?
14
A. Yes.
16 Q. In what year?
17 A. It occurred in 1918.
18 Q. And when did it end?
15
That occurred with prohibition,
yes.
19
And when was the Constitution further
20 amended so as to repeal the amendment barring
21 the sale of alcohol?
22 A. In 1933.
23 Q. All right.
24
25
Is it your testimony that even
following the repeal of prohibition in this
162
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 country, that the temperance movement,
2 so-called, continues to have an impact on the
3 way in which people thought and acted in the
4 state of Ohio?
5
A.
Again, with reference to specific
6 reform groups, I think it is reflected in the
7 educational materials that were used in the
8 state.
9
Q.
Let's go to "National Legislation".
10 You've included reference to the congressional
11 hearings on filter-tip claims, false and
12 misleading advertising.
13 there.
That's the first entry
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Is this the only document that you have
16 reviewed from that time period related to the
17 issue of the -- let me rephrase the question.
18
19
Have you reviewed any other information
regarding the same subject matter?
20 MR. CONGROVE:
21 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Well, I have reviewed --
22 I reviewed newspaper stories on this hearing and
23 other hearings, but this hearing was a
24 particularly well-publicized one.

Have you reviewed the report that
2 emerged from the Congress as a result of the
3 hearings that included testimony by Dr. Burney?
4 A. 1957?
5 Q. Yes.
6 A. Yes, I have.
7
8
9
And let's see, they may be -- yes.
The
answer is yes, I have.
Q.
Including booklets from the
10 congressional -- from the offices of the
11 publishing offices of Congress, whatever they're
12 called, I've forgotten, that look like very much
13 the exhibit that is referenced here?
14
In other words, a little booklet that
15 comes from the Congressional Printing Office, I
16 think it's called?
17 documents?
18
A.
Have you seen other such
I primarily have concentrated on this
19 one just because it was reported in the press
20 more than some of the other hearings.
21
Q.
22
All right.
Do you agree with me that Dr. Burney's
23 testimony was not the only thing reported at
24 that time, correct?
25
A.
Oh, very definitely.

particular subcommittee?
3 A. Yes.

5
Did you continue to follow the
6 statements of the Surgeon General and the other
7 various officials of the Public Health Service
8 in the United States from 1957 forward about
9 smoking and health?
10 A. Yes, I did.
11 Q. Have you seen any public statements by
12 the government through the Public Health
13 Service, which is what it was called, I believe,
14 at that time, in the late Fifties, with respect
15 to the awareness of the scientific community of
16 the issue relating to smoking as a potential
17 cause of lung cancer?
18 MR. CONGROVE:
19 MR. SALES:
20 question.
21 BY MR. SALES:
22
23
Q.
Object to form.
Let me rephrase the
Let me put it to you this way:
Do you know what percentage of the
24 scientific community in, let us say, 1958
25 believed that smoking caused cancer?
165
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. No, I don't know the exact percentage.
2 Q. And sometimes in these cases, the
3 experts occupying your position have studied
4 polling and other similar information.
5
6
7
8
9
Are you going to be testifying about
opinion polls?
A.
Only to the degree that they represent
public awareness on the topic.
Q.
Do you know if the United States Public
10 Health Service, through the Office of the
11 Surgeon General, has ever commented, and let us
12 say in the 1950s, late 1950s, about the portion
13 or percentage of scientists who actually
14 believed that smoking caused lung cancer at that
15 time?
16 A. No, I don't.
17 Q. What is the significance in particular
18
of Dr. Burney's testimony?
19 A. In '57?
20 Q. Well, I think you told me that item
21 No. 1 under "National Legislation, V-B, you were
22 focusing in this particular booklet from the
23 hearings on Dr. Burney's testimony.
24
25
A.
Well, Dr. Burney's, and the head of the
National Cancer Institute, John Heller.
They
166
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
were the first two to testify.
Q.
3
All right.
What is the significance -- what is the
4 particular significance in this case of what
5 they had to say, without going through it all?
6 MR. CONGROVE:
7 THE WITNESS:
Objection.
They were simply there to
8 represent what the government's position at the
9 time was on filter-tips and to respond to
10 questions from the Congressmen about the
11 effectiveness, or lack thereof, of these
12 filter-tip cigarettes.
13 BY MR. SALES:
14
Q.
Did the government, if you recall, at
15 least as stated by Dr. Burney, support the idea
16 that harmful constituents of tobacco smoke could
17 be removed by the addition or use of filters on
18 cigarettes?
19 A. They didn't know at this time.
20 Q. All right.
21
Anything else that struck you as
22 important for purposes of your opinions in this
23 case about the 1957 subcommittee hearing?
24 A. Well, as I --
25 Q. And let me say congressional hearings,
167
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 plural.
2 A.
Yeah.
3 They were, I thought, for the most part
4 fairly evenhanded, because while you might get a
5 couple of the Congressmen riding his own hobby
6 horse, they did hear testimony from really all
7 sides of the question.
8
Q.
9
10
11
Anything else on that that comes to
mind?
A.
12
13
All right.
Mm, not in particular.
Burney and Heller were acting
alternately to answer some of the questions.
14
They did get some very specific
15 questions about the position that Clarence Cook
16 Little had taken.
17 were there to present the government's side at
18 this point in time.
19
20
21
22
23
Q.
But as I say, they simply
Did Dr. Little's comments receive
public attention also?
A.
Yes, they would have in some of the
newspaper accounts of these hearings, yeah.
Q.
One of the things that always amazes me
24 about these documents, is the number of
25 exclamation points.
168
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. I know.
2 Q. Because I know that some of these
3 things are preprinted and not actual transcribed
4 testimony, which I'm not quarreling with that,
5 but I really wonder if people exclaimed all of
6 the things that they apparently exclaimed?
7
8
9
A.
screenplay.
Q.
10
11
Yes, it's almost written like a
Agreed on that, at least.
Okay, you've got three other statutes
in "National Legislation".
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Let's take the second one.
14 A. Okay.
15 Q. That's the '89 Labeling Act.
16 A. Yeah.
17 Q. What is that included for?
18 A. Let's see.
19
I'm trying to look it up
here.
20
21
Let me just --
'69?
Q.
22
Yes.
MR. CONGROVE:
David, you said '89.
23 That's why we were puzzling over that question
24 BY MR. SALES:
25
Q.
I'm sorry.
It's the Eighty-Ninth
169
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Congress.
2
3
THE WITNESS:
I'm bringing it up
Well, this one, of course, is going to
precede the second stage in the warnings.
6 (Pause.)
7 MR. SALES:
8
Okay.
now.
4
5
That would be 1969.
I can hear you whispering,
so just be aware of that.
9
MR. CONGROVE:
10
MR. SALES:
I don't know that --
But it's in my ear.
It
11 didn't sound important, but still, just to let
12 you know.
13
MR. CONGROVE:
No, I'm just saying, I
14 don't know that Dr. Hoff needs to bring up every
15 one of these documents unless you are asking her
16 to do so.
17
18
MR. SALES:
No, I'm not asking her to
do so.
19 MR. CONGROVE:
20 MR. SALES:
21
22
23
24
25
Yeah.
That's okay.
BY MR. SALES:
Q.
What is the significance of the second
national piece of legislation?
Is that the document pertaining to the
law that ultimately required labeling to be
170
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
placed on cigarettes?
2
3
A.
This
was consideration of another more rigid law.
4
5
Well, it was after the first law.
Q.
Well, I'm not sure you're right about
that, but I'm not sure you're wrong either.
6
Let me just tell you what I'm looking
7 at.
8 bring it up.
And I have it up, so you don't have to
9
This is from December of '69, okay?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. It's the Ninety-First Congress, so I
12
misspoke previously.
13 A.
14 Q.
And it's the -- go ahead.
"The purpose of this bill
15 is to provide adequate
16 warning to the public of
17 the hazards of cigarette
18 smoking through
19 strengthened cautionary
20 labeling of all cigarette
21 packages, and to prohibit,
22 after January 1, 1971, all
23 television and radio
24 broadcasting of cigarette
25 advertisements."
171
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
2
Does that orient you as to which one
this is?
3 A. Yes, it does.
4 Q. All right.
5
6
And what is the significance of it for
purposes of the Gafney case?
7 MR. CONGROVE:
8 THE WITNESS:
9
Object to form.
Well, it would have
pertinence simply because these warnings would
10 have been being strengthened, that, indeed,
11 there would be no more radio and television ads
12 after 1971.
13 BY MR. SALES:
14
15
Q.
The next one is the Public Health
Cigarette Smoking Act --
16 A. Of.
17 Q. -- which is 98-174.
18 I think they are out of order.
19 list is not in the same order as the ones on the
20 disk.
The
That's what threw me before.
21
All right, well, the next listed item
22 is the Public Health Smoking -- Cigarette
23 Smoking Act of 1969.
24 A. I think that's what we just had opened.
25 Q. I think that's what I was just reading
172
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
from, also.
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. The last one, which is the one I have
4 up now, going out of order, is the Smoking
5 Education Act of 1964.
6 requires labeling that took place obviously at a
7 later date.
8
That's the one that
Do you recall?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. All right.
11
So, generally speaking, you will
12 explain how the labels appeared, when they
13 appeared, and point out, for example, that they
14 would have been on the packs of cigarettes,
15 which is not going to be argued probably, that
16 Mr. Gafney was smoking with the specified
17 warnings appearing on date X, and continuing
18 until such specified warnings were changed by
19 law.
20
21
MR. CONGROVE:
Object to form.
BY MR. SALES:
22 Q. Right?
23 A. Generally correct, yes.
24 Q. Let's go to "Litigation".
25
What are the significance of these
173
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 cases, Austin versus State, and Austin versus
2 State of Tennessee?
3
A.
They're interesting for the kind of
4 comprehensive research I do on general awareness
5 and attitudes towards smoking.
6 Because as you can see there, these are
7 two very early cases, and in both decisions, but
8 particularly in the 1900 one, I found it not
9 only interesting, but very valuable to see that
10 the court in Tennessee, in essence, was
11 referring to general awareness or common
12 knowledge about the -- about smoking.
13 This was a case of whether or not to
14 ban, or whether selling cigarettes came under
15 the commerce clause in the police state -- or
16 the police powers of the state.
17
And they indicated in about half a
18 dozen different places that it was generally
19 known -- "the pernicious effects of cigarette
20 smoking was generally known", was the phrase
21 that was used in the decision.
22
And that it's an early indication of
23 general awareness in the public domain that was
24 recognized, in this case, by the court of
25 Tennessee.
174
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 It's kind of an archaic historical fact
2 that I found interesting to see how far back the
3 idea of "generally known", "general awareness"
4 went with respect to what they were calling the
5 "pernicious effect of cigarettes".
6
7
Q.
All right.
those are.
I'm trying to find where
That's under "Litigation"?
8 A. Oh, I -- let me --
9 Q. I found it.
10 A. Yeah.
11
It's under "Litigation".
And I have it marked on a hard copy.
12 I'm not sure I'm going to find it quickly here,
13 but --
14
15
MR. CONGROVE:
David, do you want the
page where those statements appear?
16
MR. SALES:
Because --
My memory of the case is
17 that it involves the conviction of someone
18 selling cigarettes contrary to the law in place
19 at that time.
20 BY MR. SALES:
21 Q. Is that your memory as well, Dr. Hoff?
22 A. My memory of it is that generally
23 speaking, it was a case that -- as a nonlawyer,
24 that involved whether or not, for example, the
25 sale of cigarettes came under the commerce
175
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 clause for selling cigarettes that came in out
2 of state, and that they decided obviously they
3 had that authority.
4
And then the question was, why would
5 they want to either stop the sale of cigarettes
6 or regulate it, and that is when this "generally
7 known" phrase was used.
8 And I have it specifically marked on a
9 hard copy, and I don't know if I can pull it up
10
here quickly or not.
11
MR. CONGROVE:
Dr. Hoff, I don't know
12 that he wants you to pull up the exact page.
13 let's see what his question is.
14
15
16
17
18
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
BY MR. SALES:
Q.
Hold on, because I think I have the
section.
Well, some of it is quite archaic, as
19 you say, because one of the holdings of the
20 Tennessee Supreme Court is that,
21
"Cigarettes are not
22 legitimate articles of
23 commerce --"
24
25
So
But probably counsel for the defendants
would have something to say about that.
176
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
"-- and consequently,
2 their importation and sale
3 are not within the scope of
4 the commerce clause."
5
But what I was trying to point out is
6 that this arose in the context of a criminal
7 conviction for the sale of cigarettes or
8 importation of cigarettes, one or the other,
9 which at that time, as you've previously
10 indicated, was banned in certain states.
Right?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. And Tennessee apparently was one of
13
them?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. All right.
16 A. However -- yes, it's right.
17 Q. And I'm looking for the section that
18 you refer to, which I think I had heard of
19 before, about cigarettes being bad, and seeing
20 -- trying to see if it's any more specific than
21 that.
22
23
And maybe we should open it up so you
can tell me what it is that you are relying on.
24 A. Well, I --
25 Q. And unfortunately, the head notes,
177
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 maybe it's because it's an older opinion, are
2 not numbered.
3 can help you, since this will have meaning to
4 him certainly.
5
But the lawyer looking with you
It's the last -- it is one of the last
6 head notes that is being referred to, I
7 believe.
8
"Cigarettes being
9
harmful and deleterious to
10 health are not legitimate
11 articles of commerce."
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Oh, okay.
14
15
16
That's not what I'm referring to.
What are you referring to, commerce?
A.
I'm referring to the statement.
says,
17
"It's generally known
18 that they are pernicious
19 and harmful."
20 Q. All right.
21 A. I'm trying to find it here.
22
It
Where is that?
Because that's -- well -- and the
23 reason I was using that phrase was because it
24 showed that at least for this particular Supreme
25 Court, that they -- it represented a kind of
178
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 general awareness of common knowledge about
2 cigarettes at the time.

There is a reference --
Q.
Page 4, question No. 1.
It's in
No. 1.
6
"Are cigarettes
7 legitimate articles of
8 commerce?

"We think they are not,
10 because wholly noxious and
11 deleterious to health,

13 harmful, never beneficial.
14 They present no virtue, but
15 are inherently bad, and bad
16 only.

17
No particular
Have become
Is that the part you're referring to?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. All right.
20 A. And it's important for the kind of
21 research I did for them to have used that term
22 "generally known".
23 Q. Yes.
24 A. Because it does show public awareness,
25
or a public out there that had influence, or had
180
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 brought this case to the courts, and the court
2 itself then responding.
3 Q. All right.
4 A. And if you look further down on the
5 page, it's a part of history, "large numbers of
6 men otherwise capable have rendered themselves
7 unfit for service by the use of cigarettes", and
8 "Applicants who were addicted to use of
9 cigarettes were rejected".
10
It is a very important decision in
11 terms of the language for the kind of research I
12 do.
13
Q.
What was the date in which the state of
14 Tennessee passed the temperance-driven
15 prohibition laws that you referred to
16 previously?
17
18
A.
I think -- looking at the list here, I
think it was in 1919 -- no, I'm sorry.
19
They passed it in 1897.
A lot of these
20 states passed it in the Nineties, and then it
21 passed it in 1897.
22
Q.
Do you remember what the Supreme Court
23 did with respect to the Tennessee -- the Supreme
24 Court of the United States did with respect to
25 the various statements that you and I read
181
(212) 279-9424

(212) 490-34301
2
together just moments ago?
A.
3
4
No, I don't.
(Pause.)
Q.
Turn, if you would, please, to page,
5 it's a United States Supreme Court decision.
6 It's Page 346.
7 again -- 345, rather -- because this is a West
8 report and not the official U.S. report.
9
10
The page numbers are in the margins,
the relevant page numbers.
11
12
And the lawyers can help you
MR. CONGROVE:
What page number, did
you say, David?
13
MR. SALES:
It is page 345, which is
14 identified in the margin.
15 to do it, you will see in the upper right-hand
16 corner it says Page 344 to Page 347.
17 MR. CONGROVE:
18 THE WITNESS:
19
20
And the way they used
We're getting closer.
Yeah, there we go.
BY MR. SALES:
Q.
21
Well, let me ask you this:
Do you know if the United States
22 Supreme Court agreed with the Tennessee Supreme
23 Court with respect to the matters that we just
24 discussed?
25
A.
No, I don't.
182
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
Q.
2
3
Well, it says what it says.
I don't think I'll be hearing that at
trial, but if I do, I know what to do now.
6
7
Okay, so we don't need go through that
any more.
8
9
10
We don't
need to go through it.
4
5
All right.
And then you have selected pleadings
and deposition transcripts from this case
included on your source materials.
11 A. Yes, I do.
12 Q. Have those been reduplicated and
13
14
15
provided electronically back to me, do you know?
A.
You mean the actual depositions
themselves?
16 Q. Well, are those with you?
17 A. I brought them today because of the
18
19
notice for the deposition.
Q.
20
21
22
Okay.
What is the -- what are the Ayers list,
if you can just orient me on those, 1952?
A.
That's just a reference source that
23 gives you circulation figures for the various
24 newspapers and magazines.
25
Q.
That's all it does.
What are you going to say about that?
183
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
A.
2
Nothing specifically.
But it allows me to know, for example,
3 what the circulation was of "Life Magazine" or
4 "Reader's Digest".
5
Q.
6
Okay.
Newspapers also, or just magazines?
7 A. Newspapers as well.
8 Q. I'm just pulling one up from random,
9
10
1969.
I just see the states starting with
Indiana listed here.
11
Anyway, whatever is on there, those are
12 the circulation figures for whatever regular
13 circulation cycle the various publication has;
14 is that right?
15 A. Exactly.
16 Q. So it says the "New Yorker Magazine",
17 one I know, a commentary of humor -- I can't
18 tell if it's 4 million or 470,000.
19 But whatever the figure is, that's the
20 expected circulation in 1969 for that magazine,
21 right? 22 A. Yes.
23 Q. All right.
24
25
Do you have any list of materials that
you have been provided, or do we have to go
184
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 through them and identify them?
2 MR. CONGROVE: Object to form.
3 THE WITNESS: List of materials
4 pertaining to what?
5 BY MR. SALES:
6 Q.
7 Gafney.
Pertaining to Kathleen Gafney and Frank
8 In other words, do you have a list that
9 says I have these 17 depositions, or do you just
10
have them sitting there with you?
11 A. I just have the depositions.
12 Q. Why don't you, if you don't mind -- I
13
have an idea how to do this.
14
15
16
17
Do you have any notes from them?
A.
Yes.
It's the way I read depositions.
I take notes.
Q.
Are the depositions noted themselves,
18 or do you have the notes separate from the
19 deposition?
20 A. The notes are separate.
21 Q. All right.
22 Hold on just one second.
23 Do you have the depositions, the two
24 volumes of the deposition of Mrs. Gafney,
25 Kathleen Gafney, I and II?
185
(212) 279-9424

I don't need the originals

MR. SALES:
All right.
BY MR. SALES:
Q.
12
Are the pages numbered?
I know you said there were 18 pages.

19
20
That will be fine.
And I forgot what you said in response
to my prior question.
I apologize.
Do the notes contain information other
than your thoughts about the depositions?
21 MR. CONGROVE:
22 THE WITNESS:

24 They're double-sided, so you end up

5 sheets? 6 A. Yes.
7 Q. Okay.

10
Nine sheets --
Do you have anything else with you
today?
A.
I brought the depositions.
I brought
11 the -- as requested I think in the notice, the
12 correspondence I would have had in this specific
13 case with Shook, Hardy & Bacon.
14
Q.
15
16
All right.
How many pieces of correspondence or
communications do you have?
17 A. I only have three.
18 Q. Do they relate to anything other than
19
the mechanics of the deposition - time, place?
20 A. Two of them do, yes.
21 Q. All right.
22
Why don't you tell me what they are,
23 the dates, who they are from, to whom they are,
24 and the general subject matter.
25
A.
Yeah.
These are from me to Vicky

2 the heading is "Palm Beach Paper".
3
And what is referencing, there was an
4 attachment sent to me by my research assistant,
5 Hali, and I was then forwarding to Thompson the
6 information that Hali had researched and found
7 for the ""Palm Beach Post"" paper from '80 -- I
8 think 1980 to '84.
9
Q.
Are those parts of what Hali found, did
10 they make it into the materials included on the
11 Resource List and disks?
12
A.
Some of them did.
Because as I said,
13 it's
14 of those for the disk for the research.
15
'80 to actually '87, and I selected some
Q.
But what I'm saying is, did you send
16 anything to the Shook Hardy parallel that did
17 not make it on to the disks?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. What would have been part of what was
20 not included on the list that came from Hali
21 vis-a-vis the "Palm Beach Post"?
22
A.
Well, I'd have to go back and see which
23 of the articles I've highlighted that I thought
24 were representative the material in the
25 ""Post"", so that what you have on the disk
192
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 would be representative of the positions taken
2 by the "Post" -- or not positions, but what they
3 published with respect to cigarettes smoking and
4 the scientific studies.

MR. SALES:
All right, let's mark the
6 correspond email, whatever it is, all three
7 pieces together, as Exhibit C to the

Q.
The Gallup Poll retrieval have
19 Internet, if you go -- well, I'll just tell you
20 first.
21 If I look at what you have for the 1957
22 Gallup Poll, the first page is cut off as to the
23 retrieval date.
24 intentional.
25
I'm not saying that was
The second page reflects a retrieval
193
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
date by Internet of 2002.
2
3
And the third page for '57 reflects a
retrieval date of 2004.
4
Does that sound about right to you?
In
5 other words, those had been retrieved prior to
6 your involvement in this case?
7
A.
8
Yes.
But I also have hard copies.
9 Q. Oh, you have those with you?
10 A. No, I don't.
11 Q. Were those retrieved by you, or by
12 someone else at your request, or by the lawyers,
13 or someone else at their request?
14 Any of those, I guess could apply.
15 MR. CONGROVE:
16 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
The electronic retrieval
17 would have been done by the law firm.
18 with the hard copy.
19 BY MR. SALES:
I worked
20 Q. From the book or from the Internet?
21 A. From the -- the hard copy from the time
22
23
period when the reports were made.
Q.
In other words, you have a hard copy
24 somewhere of the way it appeared as published by
25 Gallup back when, not as it is currently
194
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
available or the Internet through iPoll?
2 A. That's correct.
3 Q. All right.
4
Do you recall that with respect to the
5 1957 Gallup Poll, whether or not there were
6 questions asked not only of the prior population
7 polled by Gallup, but also by -- that it was
8 broken out by smoker versus nonsmoker?
9
Do you recall that?
10 A. I do recall that.
11 Q. Do you recall how the data for 1957 --
12
let me ask you this:
13
Are you familiar with these types of
14 polls sufficient that you understand the
15 difference between a so-called "awareness poll"
16 and a so-called "belief poll"?
17 MR. CONGROVE:
18 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I'm not an addict, but
19 because I looked for awareness, I'm more
20 concerned about the questions that would deal
21 with awareness in these three particular polls.
22 BY MR. SALES:
23 Q. Why is that?
24 A. Because my research from other sources
25
had indicated to me that general awareness on
195
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 some of these early scientific reports, my own
2 research from other sources, indicated that
3 there was quite a bit of general awareness.
4
And I turned to these polls -- I don't
5 use them in my basic research -- just to see
6 whether or not my idea about general awareness
7 was confirmed or denied in these polls.
8
9
Q.
Do you recall if there was difference
when it was measured between either the
10 awareness or beliefs of smokers versus non--
11 excuse me -- smokers versus all persons polled
12 as to whether, A, they had heard that cigarettes
13 may be a cause of lung cancer or, B, whether
14 they believed that was so?
15 MR. CONGROVE:
16 THE WITNESS:
17
Object to form.
I don't think I can
answer that specifically.
18
I was looking at that particular poll
19 for the answer to the question about had people
20 heard about the American Cancer Society's
21 report, and that's the figure that I thought was
22 significant for my own research.
23 BY MR. SALES:
24
25
Q.
My question was a little bit
different.
My question was, do you recall
196
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 whether in any of the polling that you have ever
2 reviewed with respect to smoking and health,
3 whether the data appeared to differ between, on
4 the one hand, A, smokers and, B, all person
5 polled, including smokers?
6
7
8
9
Have you ever observed a difference?
A.
Well, I think I have, but you'd have to
be more specific.
Q.
Well, what, if any, differences can you
10 recall from any poll at any time as to whether
11 or not smokers versus all persons polled believe
12 at the same rate or a different rate as to
13 whether or not cigarette is a cause, as they
14 used to call it, of cancer of the lung?
15 MR. CONGROVE:
16 THE WITNESS:
Be object to form.
I wasn't looking at the
17 polls for that kind of belief statement.
18 BY MR. SALES:
19
Q.
I wasn't asking you, respectfully,
20 whether you looked for it or not.
21 you whether you ever observed whether there was
22 a difference?
23
I was asking
The answer may be, "You know, no, I've
24 never noticed that. I may have seen it, but I
25 didn't think about it.
Sorry."
197
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
The answer may be, "Yes, I thought
2 about it, and it wasn't important to me, so I
3 just disregarded it."
4 The answer may be, "I can't remember."
5 Or any other multitude of answers.
6 So what I'm trying to find out is, as
7 my question reflected, whether you ever observed
8 a difference?
9
MR. CONGROVE:
Object to form.
10 You can answer.
11 THE WITNESS:
I have observed a
12 difference, but it goes back to I think your
13 third or fourth suggested answer, that it wasn't
14 important for the type of research I do.
15 BY MR. SALES:
16
17
Q.
All right.
So, it was not important for you to
18 know whether or not, for example, smokers
19 believed at a lower rate -- excuse me, at a
20 lower percentage that cigarettes cause lung
21 cancer, let us say in the 1950s, than whether
22 all of the population does, right?
23 MR. CONGROVE:
24 THE WITNESS:
25
Object to form.
No, because I'm not
looking for belief in my own research.
I'm
198
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 looking for awareness.
2 awareness questions, not the belief questions.
3 BY MR. SALES:
4
Q.
So I'm looking at the
What does your research in this case
5 with respect to Frank Gafney show that he
6 actually believed, let us say, in the late
7 1950s?
8
9
MR. CONGROVE:
Object to form.
Lack of
predicate.
10
THE WITNESS:
In terms of the social
11 and cultural research I do, there's no way I can
12 know whether any individual believes anything.
13
I can only show that he either had
14 access to or was surrounded by people who knew
15 about the health hazards of smoking, and relayed
16 this information to him.
17
So, there's no way that I can, from
18 general awareness, jump to the fact that he
19 believed anything on any topic.

Q.
I think you misheard my question.
apologize.
I
Let me ask it again.
Have you been provided with any
24 information in this case that suggested to you
25 that Frank Gafney believed anything in
199
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 particular with respect to whether or not
2 cigarettes were a health hazard to him in the
3 1950s?
4 MR. CONGROVE:
5 THE WITNESS:
6
Object to form.
I guess the answer to
that is no.
7
The depositions -- the deposition of
8 his wife clearly indicate that she thought that
9 he was -- had come to the realization of the
10 health hazards at least by 1966 or '67, and that
11 they had discussed the health hazards of smoking
12 with respect to the death of his father, which
13 occurred in 1954.
14
15
Q.
Would you agree with me that the 1950s
took place before the 1960s?
16 A. Obviously.
17 Q. I asked you a question about the 1950s,
18 5-0, like with Hawaii 5-0, so record is clear.
19 I asked you whether or not you had been provided
20 any information in this case that provided to
21 you a reflection of Frank Gafney's actual belief
22 of the risks of smoking to him personally in the
23 1950s, 5-0?
24 MR. CONGROVE:
25 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
And my answer would be
200
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
the same.
2
3
His wife indicated in 1966 or '67, that
had he known about this for at least 10 years.
4 Q. 5-6 or 6-6?
5 A. If you listen my answer, she said.
6 Q. Well, I didn't hear whether you were
7
8
9
saying '56 or '66, because it sounded like '66.
A.
When she was talking about his reaction
to the diagnosis of his stepfather with
10 emphysema, she indicated that she thought at
11 that point in time, he recognized that she had
12 been right all along about the health hazards of
13 smoking.
14
And then she adds in this deposition
15 that she thought he had known this for at least
16 10 years before, which would place it in the
17 1950s.
18
Q.
19
All right.
Do you recall the discussion we had
20 earlier today about your recollection of
21 Mrs. Gafney's testimony when -- about Mr. Gafney
22 attempting to show her things, or tell her
23 things that he had read about whether or not
24 cigarettes were responsible for disease?
25
A.
Yes.

earlier?
3

5
Do you remember that discussion
When is it that you understood that
those conversations took place?
A.
They took place, and I think hers --
6 her testimony indicates they took place probably
7 in a sharp or detailed form with the first
8 Surgeon General's report in '64.
9

11
Q.
Do you have a copy of the disclosure
handy?
A.
12
Mm --
MR. CONGROVE:

13 have a copy of the disclosure.

All right, there's a short biographical
6 paragraph which is much briefer than what is
7 contained in your resume, not to limit you, but
8 not to suggest that your substantial experience
9 is not important, but I'm not going to ask you
10
about that any more than I have already.
11
Okay, Doc?
12 A. Yes.

Paragraph two,

"Dr. Hoff is expected to
16 testify that the public has
17 long been aware of the
18 health risks of smoking

20 whole sentence -- including
21 the risk of contracting --
22 I should put [sic] there,
23 but I won't, COPD and other
24 and other lung diseases
25 from smoking cigarettes."
203
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

(212) 490-34301 Is it, in fact, your opinion that the
2 public has long been aware of the health risks
3 of smoking cigarettes?
4
Let's stop there.
5 A. The general --
6 Q. Is that your opinion?
7 A. The general health risks of smoking
8
cigarettes?
9 Q. Yes.
10 A. Yes, is the answer.
11 Q. How long, next phrase, has the public
12 been generally aware of the risks of contracting
13 COPD from smoking cigarettes?
14
A.
That would come much later in the
15 Twentieth Century than the general awareness of
16 health hazards.
17
Q.
All right.
18 Well, let's -- later than what?
19 General awareness as to the potential
20
cause of lung cancer --
21 A. Mm-hmm.
22 Q. -- for example?
23 A. It would come after the scientific
24 studies had begin to focus on lung cancer, and
25 then the studies later on in the Sixties,
204
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 Seventies and Eighties, which specifically
2 referenced then, COPD or bronchitis and heart
3 problems and a wonder of other issues.
4 Q.
5 second.
6
All right.
Lets's stop there for a
Because when I read that someone is
7 going to say that the public has "long been
8 aware", that presumably has a beginning point.
9
And let's break it down, if we can,
10 please, with respect to COPD, when is the meter
11 pushed to the category, if you will, of "long
12 been aware"?
13 start?
14
15
When does that period in time
Sorry for the poor question.
I'll
rephrase it.
16 When does the period of time in which
17 the public has long been aware about the risks
18 of COPD begin?
19 MR. CONGROVE:
20 THE WITNESS:
21
Object to form.
Well, I can't answer that
scientifically.

"Other lung diseases" presumably
includes lung cancer?
3
A.
Well, that was the one that started
4 this whole discussion coming out of the 1950s
5 reports, yes.
6 Q. Well, I'm reading from the document --
7 A. Okay.
8 Q. -- that describes what you're going to
9
say.
10
And it may be that this was just used
11 in a different case and copied over, because it
12 doesn't mention "lung cancer".
13
14
But I know this is a lung cancer case.
You know that, right?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. All right.
17
18
So would you agree that lung cancer is
a lung disease?
19 A. Yes.

Q.
7
All right.
And that, if we go back to the
8 beginning of the deposition, that would have
9 been around the time of -- are we looking at
10 Wynder and Graham '50, '52, or Doll and
11 Hill, '50, '52, or something thereafter.
12
13
Horn and Hammond, I think you told me,
and I agree, was a little bit later.
14 MR. CONGROVE:
15 THE WITNESS:
16
Object to form.
Well, yes, in terms of
widespread publicity given to them.
17
But keep in mind, you would have had an
18 earlier study back in the Thirties that
19 indicated that there was a connection between
20 smoking and longevity that had to do with the
21 lungs.
22
But generally speaking, it begins in
23 the Fifties with those statistical reports.

What is the year in which Mr. Gafney
started smoking cigarettes, if you recall?
A.
I think his sister said she thought he
4 started in as a junior in high school, which
5 would have been 1953.
6
Q.
Have you seen any evidence in this case
7 to suggest that he might have started smoking
8 earlier than that?
9 A. No, I haven't.
10 Q. All right.
11
So, next sentence.
12
"Dr. Hoff is also
13 expected to testify that
14 the public has long been
15 aware of the habit-forming
16 or addictive properties of
17 cigarettes."
18
Is that your opinion?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. All right.
21
When is it that we should -- what
22 period of time should we identify as beginning
23 the period in which the public has been aware of

4 you can find it in newspaper articles going back
5 to the 1880s and 1890s.
6 BY MR. SALES:
7
Q.
Would you agree with me as a matter of
8 first history, that it is likely that the
9 defendant manufacturers of cigarettes in this
10 case knew at least as much about the health
11 effects of smoking cigarettes as a teenage boy
12 in Cleveland, Ohio in the 1950s?
13 MR. CONGROVE:
14 THE WITNESS:
15 that.
16 BY MR. SALES:
17
Q.
Object to form.
I have no way to answer
As a matter of common sense, would you
18 agree that the defendants, with all of their
19 researchers, scientists, executives, business
20 folk, more likely than not knew more about the
21 health effects of cigarettes in the early 1950s
22 than a teenage boy would have in Cleveland,

And what is the year, the calendar
15 year, in which you believe that Mr. Gafney
16 started smoking?
17
18
Add his birthday plus junior.
Shall we
say 17 -- 16, 17 years of age?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. So what year does that put us in?
21 A. As I said, I think it was, according to
22
23
the one of the depositions, 1953.
Q.

4 statements that would have appeared in the
5 newspapers, or the interviews done of

Q.
9

Well, those were external statements

Yeah.
Because I'm interested in what's
out there in the public domain.

15
Right.
And why is it that you are
16 uncomfortable agreeing with me, if you can tell
17 me, that it is likely that the defendant
18 cigarette manufacturers knew more about their
19 products as it related to health in the early
20 1950s than a teenage boy in Cleveland, Ohio?

It's just that by agreeing with you
All right.
Let's go back to the issue of the
properties of nicotine.

It's the same question.
Would you

5 nicotine that you have not yet shared with me?
6 MR. CONGROVE:
7 THE WITNESS:
8
Object to form.
You'd have to be more
specific.
9
I can, as I said, go back to the late
10 Nineteenth Century, when this was becoming part
11 and parcel of both popular culture and
12 conventional wisdom on the subject, so that that
13 kind of awareness just becomes greater and
14 greater in the course of the Twentieth Century.
15 BY MR. SALES:
16
Q.
There is reason to believe that the
17 awareness, public awareness of matters about

19 of the defendants in these cases, right?

Yes.

23 Q. Do you agree?

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

(212) 490-34301 Q. Correct.
2 A. No, it didn't stop at the doors.
3 Q. There's no -- there's absolutely no
4 reason that you can think of that would allow
5 you to express an opinion that whereas people in
6 Ohio were generally aware of X, that people in
7 Winston-Salem, North Carolina, for example, were

21 MR. CONGROVE:
22 THE WITNESS:
23
Object to form.
You mean as individuals?
BY MR. SALES:

216
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 awareness would, unless a person was raised
2 under a rock in the United States, there would
3 be general awareness coming to most individuals
4 in the United States through their educational
5 system, through the reading that they have done,
6 through a variety of other sources of
7 information, the idea that there was something
8 wrong with cigarette smoking.
9
And all individuals, as I said, unless
10 they were living in a totally isolated
11 situation, would, I think, have encountered this
12 type of information.
13
Q.
14
All right.
And simply put, and the point of what
15 I'm asking you is, all of those individuals
16 would necessarily include, unless they lived
17 under a rock, the executives of cigarette
18 manufacturers in the 1950s, right?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. And all of their employees, unless they
21 were deficient in mental capacity or could read,
22 didn't have a television, something like that, a
23 truly under-the-rock type situation, right?
24 MR. CONGROVE:

13
Well, again I'm not an advertising
And when I first encountered the term
14 "Frank statement", I was a little confused
15 about whether Frank was making a statement, or
16 whether it was supposed to be an honest
17 statement.
18
And so what I did was to look up the
19 way in which Frank statements were used in
20 advertising over time.

22 statements.
23
We can go back to the

24 put it in context the Frank statement issued by
25 the tobacco industry in 1954.

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
I had never read a deposition where
2 anyone has said they've ever seen the Frank
3 statement.
4 simply because there were so many Frank
5 statements out there that this one was not
6 unique in any particular way or attracting much
7 attention, other than the way in which people
8 would view this Frank statement along with
9 others.
10 Q.
And partially that might occur
Are you going to express an opinion in
11 this case that because the cigarette
12 manufacturers decided to communicate with the
13 public by saying, "Here is the Frank statement",
14 meaning, "Here's an honest statement", that it
15 was ignored because there were so many such
16 statements?
17
18
A.
I think it probably drifted into the
general gray motif of Frank statements, yes.

MR. CONGROVE:
20 the way.

5 "Reader's Digest".

6 United States in the 1950s, and had been for
7 some time.
8 BY MR. SALES:
9 Q. All right.
10 A. I'm not trying to equate the issues.
11 I'm just indicating that people were bombarded
12 with these Frank statements from time to time.
13
Q.
Going back to the disclosure,
14 "Dr. Hoff's testimony
15 will address historical
16 methodology, general
17 awareness of the health
18 risks and habit-forming or
19 addictive nature of
20 smoking, and both national
21 and local sources on this
22 awareness."
23
24
25
Now, we have touched on some of those
matter.
Generally speaking, have we talked
224
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 about the kinds of things that you expect to
2 talk about at the trial on the matter that I
3 just read?
4 A. I think so.
5 Q. Is there anything that's particular
6 about the historical methodology that was used
7 in this case that distinguishes it from other
8 work that you have done in the past?
9
10
11
A.
In other cases or just general, my
general historical research?
Q.
Well, I assume that the methodology in
12 this case is the same as the methodology
13 generally used in other smoking and health cases
14 that you have done in the litigation context?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. So, is there something that is
17 particular about that methodology that
18 distinguishes it and the work that you have done
19 in these cases, the lawsuit cases, from the type
20 of work that you've done in an academic setting
21 about issues related, for example, to foreign
22 policy, women in history and the like?
23
24
25
A.
The answer to that has to be somewhat
divided.
To do research in foreign policy and
225
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 politics, you can really relegate yourself to
2 official documents of governments or exchanges
3 between governments.
4
But to get to topics of general
5 awareness, one has to then employ similar
6 methodology, but you expand your resource base
7 so that you can include the information about
8 average people in the society, what they might
9 have been generally aware of at any given time.
10 So the methodology remains the same.
11 But to go to into awareness on any topic, you
12 have to use what we call social and cultural
13 history methods, which are similar to standard
14 ones for studying politics, foreign policy.
15 usually the research base is broadened because
16 you are trying to find out artifacts about
17 everyday life in a country or in a region.
18
Q.
But
All right.
19
"She is also expected to
20 testify -- referring to you
21 -- that both types of
22 awareness -- both types of
23 awareness have long been
24 reflected and reinforced in
25 virtually every aspect of
226
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
American society."
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. I think that both types of awareness
4 that we are referring to are the health risks of
5 cigarettes and the addictive properties of
6 nicotine.
7 that that refers to?
Are those the two types of awareness
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. All right.
10 And is that true, in fact, that that is
11 your opinion that those have been reinforced and
12 reflected in virtually every aspect of American
13 Society?
14
A.
Yes.
Because research includes popular
15 culture as well as formal educational
16 institutions and a variety of other sources.
17
Q.
"Dr. Hoff may also opine,
18 O-P-I-N-E, about the
19 nature, sources and extent
20 of awareness of the risks
21 of smoking, including the

2 Florida."
3
4
Have we generally talked about that
today, your opinions in that regard?
5 A. I think so.
6 Q. To summarize, without reading it word
7 for word, the next paragraph says that you may
8 talk about issue raised by plaintiff -- now I'm
9 reading from it --

11 expert witnesses, and asked
12 to comment upon the
13 testimony and opinions of
14 other witnesses and expert
15 reports to the extent that
16 they relate to her areas of
17 expertise."
18
You've read no other expert testimony
19 in this case, if I understood your earlier
20 comments, right?
21 A. That's correct.
22 Q. So far at least, do you anticipate
23 commenting on what any expert has said or will
24 say, at least so far?
25
A.
No, I don't.

"Dr. Hoff also expects to
2 review interrogatory
3 responses, deposition
4 testimony and other
5 materials identified
6 through ongoing discovery
7 on which she may rely for
8 her opinions in this case."
9
MR. SALES:
I take it if additional
10 facts or materials are provided, and they change
11 Dr. Hoff's opinions, I will be alert, right?
12 THE WITNESS:
13 MR. SALES:
14 MR. CONGROVE:
15 MR. SALES:
16 might.

Q.
Correct.
No, Counsel I'm asking.
David, yes, absolutely.
It seems unlikely, but it
And then the last one says the kind of
19 stuff that you're going to look at, which you
20 have already spent most of the day doing today.
21 I don't have any other questions,
22 unless you can think of some other area of
23 testimony about which you know that you're going
24 to be testifying that we have not covered?
25
A.
I only would, I think, indicate that
229
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 there's much more that I could draw from on the
2 depositions to indicate that a man as
3 intelligent and as well-educated as Frank
4 Gafney, received information about the health
5 hazards of smoking and it addictive nature that
6 I haven't been able to comment on today.
7
Q.
8
9
All right.
Well, I understand the issues of his
education and so forth.
But are there any other
10 particular sources or any other particular
11 items, any other particular types of materials
12 that you are going to talk about him being
13 exposed to that we have not already talked
14 about?
15 A. Well, we haven't --
16 Q. Let me rephrase the question.
17 Someone who has an advanced degree is
18 more likely to have an understanding of issues
19 about which the community are generally aware
20 than someone who does not have an advanced
21 degree, generally speaking, right?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. I get that part of it.
24
25
And I'm not
trying to limit you in that regard.
We all know he had a law degree, right?
230
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 A. Yes.
2 Q. Practiced as a lawyer, right?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. Showed an interest in newspapers,
5
probably travel, right?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. He didn't live under a rock --
8 A. Exactly.
9 Q. -- right?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. Okay, I get that part.
12
Over and above that, is there anything
13 particular about Mr. Gafney's life experiences
14 that you believe deserve particular comment in
15 the context of the deposition, given what you
16 have just told me?
17
A.
Well, I think, again, coming from the
18 depositions, I thought it was important and
19 significant that he had, on two occasions at
20 least, stopped smoking.
21
Q.
22
23
24
25
All right.
What significance did you attribute to
that?
A.
That he was capable of stopping
smoking, at least twice, and even for shorter
231
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 periods of time at the advent of Lent, and so
2 given what he knew about the health hazards or
3 the information he was getting from his wife, it
4 seems a little curious to me that he didn't stop
5 before he was finally diagnosed with lung
6 cancer.
7 Q.
Well, based on your knowledge, training
8 and experience and your review of the materials
9 in this case and others, can you think of any
10 reasons why it is that people may not stop
11 smoking other than willful obstinance?
12
A.
I guess --
13 MR. CONGROVE:
14 THE WITNESS:
15 Yes, I could think of other reasons.
16 He apparently enjoyed smoking.
Object to form.
Right.
He
17 thought it calmed him down.
18 someone who would say, "Yes, I know this is a
19 problem, but I'm going to continue to do it
20 because I like to do it."

Q.
And he seemed to be
So, are you going to express an opinion
23 in this case as to Mr. Gafney's motivations for
24 smoking, in other words, why he smoked and why
25 he failed to quit smoking?

Are you qualified to give an opinion,
6 for example, as to whether or not Mr. Gafney was
7 dependent on nicotine based on any accepted
8 criteria?
9 A. No.
10 Q. All right.
11 Anything else that you want to tell me
12 about his life experience that is of particular
13 significance to you in this case?
14
A.
I don't think so at this time.
15 MR. SALES:
16 I have no more questions.
All right.
I'm asking
17 you to honor your commitment to get back to me
18 early next week about the date of, I'll call it
19 the Inga memo.
20 it is, but the document about which we spoke
21 earlier.

EXAMINATION
BY MR. CONGROVE:
Q.
Dr. Hoff, Tim Congrove for Philip
5 Morris USA and Lorillard Tobacco Company.
6 a few questions for you.
7
Just
You were asked about the Ohio textbooks
8 earlier in the deposition.
9 for the record how it is that you went about
And can you explain
10 identifying the textbooks that were approved for
11 use in Ohio, and how you selected those
12 textbooks?
13
A.
Yes.
14 I read the info -- the documents that
15 are on the reliance list, some of them in hard
16 copy before they were put on the list; others as
17 electronic transmissions, and by carefully
18 looking at the resources which were listed for
19 the students, I came up with these textbooks.
20
Now, I am familiar with national
21 textbooks that were used across the country, in
22 the Forties, at least, and the list seemed
23 fairly standard and fairly common.
24
25
Q.
Okay.
You also were asked about publications
234
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 such as "Consumer Reports, and a couple of other
2 magazines that we don't know whether the Gafneys
3 actually ever saw them or not.
4 What's the purpose for your inclusion
5 of those materials in your resource materials,
6 and how do they relate to your opinions in this
7 case?
8
A.
Well, what they show is how widespread
9 and how different publications, like "Consumer
10 Reports", was beginning to do its own research
11 on the subject of smoking, and filters in
12 particular, and what the other magazines, which
13 were not necessarily read by the Gafneys,
14 indicated, again, how far-reaching the
15 information was becoming about the hazards of
16 smoking and the addictive nature of cigarettes.
17 And so you can't just use one source,
18 one ladies' magazine, let's say, or just "Time
19 Magazine" to show a comprehensive picture across
20 the country in the United States about growing
21 awareness on the subject of smoking.
22
Q.
So, those opinions go to your -- or
23 that information goes to your opinions about
24 general awareness of the American public.
25
Is that a fair way of summarizing it at
235
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301
that point?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. And, of course, the Gafneys were a part
4
of the American public, correct?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. Maybe just a couple more questions.
7
You mentioned the 1957 congressional
8 hearings in which Drs. Heller and Burney
9 testified --
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. -- is that correct?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Do you recall whether there were any
14 statements during the course of those hearings
15 by Drs. Heller or Burney about whether the
16 public was informed about the dangers of
17 smoking?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. And what was the gist of those
20
21
statements, if you recall?
A.
Well, it was the opinion of the Public
22 Health Service at the time that its function was
23 to inform the American public, that it had been
24 doing this fairly effectively since the early
25 1950s.
236
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 And it's one of the reasons that they
2 -- it was one of the points they wanted to get
3 across to the Congressmen, some of whom were
4 pushing for greater action than simply
5 information.
6 Q.
Dr. Hoff, have you researched the
7 existence of slang terms for cigarettes in the
8 United States?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. And what are some of the slang terms
11 that have been associated with cigarette
12 smoking?
13
A.
Well, probably the best known one is
14 "coffin nails", "cancer stick", all kind of
15 references to "nicotine fiend", "slavery",
16 "little white slaver".
17
Just an abundance of these kinds of
18 terms, and they go back much further than simply
19 the Twentieth Century.
20
21
Q.
Do they go back to the Nineteenth
Century?
22 A. Oh, yes.
23 Q. Okay.
24
25
And so when you're talking about the
temperance movement and some of the health
237
(212) 279-9424
VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY
www.veritext.com
(212) 490-34301 problems that they associated with cigarette
2 smoking, that begs a backdrop of public
3 awareness reflected in those slang terms?
4 A. Yes, exactly.
5 Q. Okay.
6 A. Slang terms are just shorthand ways
7 that we have for referring to a variety of
8 thoughts in society, especially if those
9 thoughts are somewhat controversial.
