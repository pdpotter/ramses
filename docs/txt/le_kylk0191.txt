1	THEREUPON,
2	LUIS MARTINEZ-FERNANDEZ, Ph.D.,
3	having been first duly sworn, was examined and
4	testified upon his oath as follows:
5	THE WITNESS: I do.
6	DIRECT EXAMINATION
7	BY MR. SALES:
8	Q Are you Luis Martinez-Fernandez?
9	A Yes, that's me.
10	Q How old are you?
11	A I'm 50 years old.
12	Q What's your date of birth?
13	A January 14, 1960.
14	Q Are you still teaching at the U.C.F.?
15	A That's correct.
16	Q And are you still the director of the Latin
17	American, Caribbean and Latino studies?
18	A No, I'm not.
19	Q What do you do there now?
20	A I am a professor of history.
21	Q Is there still a department or division of
22	Latin American, Caribbean and Latino studies?
23	A Yes, there is.
24	Q Who's in charge of that now?
25	A His name is -- the last name's Maunez,
0005
1	M-a-u-n-e-z, Cuadra, C-u-a-d-r-a.
2	Q Do you have your current resume with you?
3	A I do have one, yes.
4	Q The last title that I have under the heading
5	Scholarly Publications is The Cuban Revolution, an entry
6	in the Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modem World. Do you
7	have that?
8	A Yes, I do have that. Let me -- let me check
9	the specific page. I'm sorry. Scholarly publication.
10	Q It's page one.
11	A Concise History of the Cuban Revolution. Yes,
12	that's the first item.
13	Q I don't have that. I think that was in
14	progress when the resume that I have was submitted. So
15	the one you have appears to be newer than the one I
16	have, so let's mark that as Exhibit 1 to your
17	deposition.
18	(Exhibit 1 was marked for identification.)
19	MR. LUNDT: It's been marked.
20	BY MR. SALES:
21	Q Has the book Cuba: An Essay History from the
22	Pre-Colombian Era to 1800, is that in print yet?
23	A No, that's not. That's in a very premature
24	state.
25	Q Do you know who's going to be publishing that?
0006
1	A I'm sorry, I missed the question.
2	Q Do you know who or what is going to be
3	publishing that?
4	A No, I haven't --it's not ready for -- for
5	that yet, so I don't know.
6	Q The prior resume that I have says something -7	says received contract. What does that mean?
8	A Which item are you referring to?
9	Q The same one, Cuba: An Essay History from the
10	Pre-Columbian Era to 1800. It's under works accepted
11	for publication, or in progress.
12	A Okay. I'm looking. Cuba, Essay. Yes, a
13	contract has been offered, actually, yes, so it is --
14	it's not finished, but I do have a contract for that
15	one.
16	Q That's -- is it a contract from a publisher or
17	a publishing agent?
18	A From a university press.
19	Q Which one?
20	A University of Florida.
21	Q That's the University of Florida press?
22	A Yes.
23	Q And then the version of the resume that I
24	have, there's something called, The American
25	Mediterranean during the First Half of the American
0007
1	Century, Political Culture and U.S. Hegemony in the
2	Hispanic Caribbean, 1898 through 1945. Is that still a
3	project in progress?
4	A That's correct.
5	Q Are there any other book-length projects that
6	you're working on presently, other than those?
7	A Let me take a look at my listing. There is --
8	there's a book which is a collection of essays, and the
9	title is Frontiers, Plantations and Walled Cities.
10	Q Is that included on Exhibit 1?
11	A Current Exhibit 1, yes.
12	Q Has that been submitted for publication?
13	A Yes, it's actually in production.
14	Q Who's going to be printing that?
15	A Markus Wiener.
16	Q Is that an academic publisher?
17	A It is an academic publisher, yes.
18	Q I'm not familiar with them. Where are they
19	located?
20	A Princeton, New Jersey.
21	Q What is the subject of that book, other than
22	the title?
23	A The subject is a series of essays that I've
24	written over the past few years that deal with common
25	subjects of economy and culture in the Hispanic
0008
1	Caribbean.
2	Q Is it a compilation of essays that have
3	previously been published in journals, in something less
4	than book form?
5	A I believe that all of them have been
6	published.
7	Q So the discrete chapters that are included in
8	that are likely listed elsewhere on Exhibit 1. Would
9	that be correct?
10	A That is correct.
11	Q When was the last tobacco and health or
12	smoking and health deposition or trial testimony that
13	you gave?
14	A This was last week, and the case was Buonomo
15	in Fort Lauderdale.
16	Q What's it called?
17	A Buonomo.
18	Q Oh, Buonomo. That's -- you testified at the
19	trial in that case?
20	A That's correct.
21	Q Before we talk about testifying history, I've
22	read some prior depositions that you've given. Just to
23	update this issue, have you ever, as an area of academic
24	interest outside the context of smoking and health
25	litigation, ever conducted any scholarly research?
0009
1	A Scholarly research?
2	Q Outside the context of being an expert witness
3	for tobacco companies.
4	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
5	THE WITNESS: I have an extensive record of
6	research. It's not linked to tobacco and smoking.
7	BY MR. SALES:
8	Q I don't understand your answer. I'm asking
9	the questions right now about your professional
10	background as it relates to your academic pursuits as
11	a -- as an historian and as a professor of history,
12	unconnected with retentions by tobacco firms to be an
13	expert. Okay?
14	A I understand that.
15	Q Outside the context of conducting research,
16	such as it is, for tobacco firms, in the context of
17	litigation have you ever made it a subject or a focus of
18	any of your academic pursuits? That is to say, smoking
19	and health.
20	MR. LUNDT: Form.
21	THE WITNESS: I have not.
22	BY MR. SALES:
23	Q Outside the context of being an expert witness
24	for a tobacco company, have you ever published any
25	smoking and health-related papers, books or anything in
0010
1	the academic world?
2	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
3	THE WITNESS: Not on smoking. However, the
4	subject of tobacco as a crop has been part of my
5	research over the years because of my areas of
6	expertise. So my works have touched upon tobacco,
7	cigars, but not related to health.
8	BY MR. SALES:
9	Q As an example, one of the things that you'll
10	be talking about in this case is the level of public
11	awareness of issues of smoking and health, correct?
12	A That is correct.
13	Q Has that ever been, outside the context of
14	being an expert for a tobacco company, a subject of
15	academic interest for you?
16	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
17	THE WITNESS: No, that has not been.
18	BY MR. SALES:
19	Q Since 2002, how many smoking and health cases
20	have you been involved in where you have either --
21	without identifying any names of any smokers or cases
22	for the moment, how many cases have you been asked to
23	review? First of all, we'll start with review.
24	A I can go back to, I believe, 2001. There was
25	several cases in Puerto Rico. Then in terms of cases in
0011
1	the United States proper, I have been involved in
2	roughly eight different cases.
3	Q Are -- Those eight cases, have you already
4	given a deposition or testified at trial?
5	A I have given depositions, before today, three
6	depositions, and I have testified in court twice.
7	Q All right. Let's go back to the Puerto Rico
8	cases. What was the total number of cases in which you
9	were involved? And if you could count them by smoker,
10	if you would, please, in Puerto Rico.
11	A My estimate is around -- between 25 and 30.
12	Q Did you give depositions in those cases?
13	A I did not.
14	Q Did you testify at a trial relating to any of
15	those cases?
16	A Yes, on one occasion.
17	Q Of the -- of the eight cases that you have
18	referred to, are those all Florida cases that postdate
19	the Puerto Rico cases?
20	A Yes, they're in Florida courts, yes.
21	Q Are they all Engle cases?
22	A If I recall correctly, all of them, there may
23	be one that was not.
24	Q Do you know what the name of that case is?
25	A Again, I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I
0012
1	think it would be the Levine case.
2	Q Do you know where that case is pending?
3	A As far as I know, that case has ended.
4	Q Do you know where it was pending?
5	A I'm sorry?
6	Q Do you know where it was pending?
7	A This was -- I'm not sure. I think this was in
8	Miami court, but I'm not a hundred percent sure.
9	Q Did you give a deposition or testify at trial
10	in that case?
11	A No, I did not.
12	Q What is the total number of cases that you
13	presently have under consideration where you have not
14	yet given a deposition? Any smoking and health matter.
15	A Let's see. Active cases, I believe that there
16	are, well, four -- actually, there are three, I'm sorry.
17	Q Do you have a list with you?
18	A I do have a list with me.
19	Q Does the list include cases in which you may
20	not yet have testified?
21	A That's correct.
22	MR. SALES: All right. Let's give that to be
23	marked as Exhibit 2, please.
24	MR. LUNDT: David, we're going to redact out
25	the names of any cases in which the doctor has not
0013
1	been formally disclosed as of this time.
2	MR. SALES: Okay. Well, is it redacted today?
3	I mean, because if I were there, I'd be looking at
4	it. Has it been redacted already?
5	MR. LUNDT: Actually, the list that I'm going
6	to mark has the three cases that he has been
7	disclosed, so I will allow this to be marked. But
8	I will not allow the doctor to answer questions
9	about the other cases where he has not been
10	disclosed. But this exhibit can be marked.
11	MR. SALES: Well, now the record's unclear to
12	me. I'll ask some questions.
13	MR. LUNDT: Sure.
14	MR. SALES: Let's go ahead and mark that as
15	Exhibit 2.
16	(Exhibit 2 was marked for identification)
17	MR. LUNDT: Okay. It's marked.
18	BY MR. SALES:
19	Q What is Exhibit 2?
20	A Is that question for me?
21	Q Yes. I don't get to question anybody else but
22	you. What is Exhibit 2?
23	A Exhibit 2 are some scribblings that I produced
24	last night with some basic information, such as the
25	cases and things of that sort.
0014
1	Q We were talking other cases you're working on.
2	Does it include a list of the other cases that you're
3	working on?
4	A These are three cases that I've been disclosed
5	as an expert.
6	Q Well, did the -- did your scribblings include
7	anything over and above that, before we just started
8	having this conversation?
9	A Yes. I wrote information on the estimate
10	number of hours that I've spent on the Talenfeld case.
11	Q I think you misunderstood my question. Did
12	the scribblings have more scribblings than are with you
13	today in the courtroom (sic), before the deposition
14	started?
15	A No. Since it started --
16	Q So all -- Exhibit 2 contains all of the
17	scribblings that you produced last night.
18	A Between last night and today, before this
19	deposition.
20	Q I think we're saying the same thing, but let
21	me check to make sure. Are there any other scribblings
22	in the last 24 hours that you had and no longer have
23	with you here in the deposition room today?
24	A Everything I had, I have with me and it's
25	here.
0015
1	Q That isn't what I asked you. Were there
2	extra, in the universe, additional scribblings that you
3	have produced in the last 24 hours that are not with you
4	in the deposition today?
5	A I thought I responded to that but, again, my
6	answer is no.
7	Q Well, for example, some scribblings could have
8	been produced and then shredded or discarded or thrown
9	in the ocean. Is there any such scribbling in the
10	world?
11	A There's not.
12	MS. LUTHER: You do realize they're in
13	Orlando, David.
14	MR. SALES: I didn't hear -- whoever broke in,
15	I didn't hear what you said.
16	MS. LUTHER: This is Kelly. They're in
17	Orlando, so he couldn't have thrown it in the
18	ocean.
19	MR. SALES: It's a short drive.
20	BY MR. SALES:
21	Q What I'm trying to do, sir, is see if we can
22	reconstruct the universe of scribblings. Have we done
23	that? Has everything that you've produced, whether --
24	in the room with you today?
25	A That is correct.
0016
1	Q All right. What else -- you identified a
2	total of eight cases, and I'm not asking for the names
3	of any litigants at the moment, so the record's clear on
4	that. You've told me about the ones in which you've
5	given depositions, and you've told me that there are
6	three additional cases identified on the scribblings,
7	Exhibit 2. Is that correct?
8	A That is correct but, again, when I said eight,
9	I believe I used the word estimate, so it's -- may not
10	be specifically eight.
11	Q Well, are there other cases, without
12	mentioning names for the moment, in which you have been
13	asked to review materials but may not yet have been
14	disclosed?
15	A I've seen some materials, yes, from other
16	cases.
17	Q Without naming the names of the smokers or the
18	cases, how many other such cases are there?
19	A My estimate would be that between five and
20	six. I'm not entirely certain about the exact number.
21	Q What I'm trying to do is get my arms on the
22	total number of cases. So there are five to six
23	additional cases, over and above the three on Exhibit 2,
24	correct?
25	A That's my estimate, correct.
0017
1	Q And do the five to six plus three include or
2	not include the three in which you've previously given
3	deposition or trial testimony that you mentioned a few
4	moments ago?
5	A The last five or six that I mentioned?
6	Q No, sir. There are five or six that you have
7	just told me about that are under consideration that are
8	not included on Exhibit 2. Right?
9	A Correct.
10	Q All right. Then there are three on Exhibit 2,
11	right?
12	A That's correct.
13	Q That pushes us to eight to nine, right?
14	A Approximately, yes.
15	Q Yes. What I'm asking you is, the other cases
16	which you identified previously where you have given
17	testimony, either by trial or by deposition, are they
18	included within the eight to nine, approximately, or are
19	they in addition to the eight to nine, approximately?
20	A It would be in addition.
21	Q Can we agree, then, that the total number of
22	cases would be in the neighborhood of ten to 12?
23	A That would be an approximation. There may be
24	a few more or a few less. That's my best estimate.
25	Q All right. What other information -- Before I
0018
1	do that, actually, tell me what the work was that you
2	did on the 25 to 30 cases in Puerto Rico.
3	A The work was, first of all, conducting
4	research on the subjects of awareness about possible
5	diseases linked to smoking, and I did that for -- for a
6	while. I also prepared --1 forget what the legal term
7	is, but reports on those findings for several of those
8	cases. And I testified in court on one occasion.
9	Q Did you conduct research with respect to all
10	25 to 30 of those cases, or was it something fewer than
11	that?
12	A The research was mostly general, since it was
13	basically the same population in the same area, but
14	also, for each case, I read the depositions, which had
15	the particulars about the individuals involved.
16	Q In this case, has any research that has been
17	conducted that was unique and specific for the purposes
18	of this particular smoker's either demographics or
19	life -- life story?
20	A Are we still talking about Puerto Rico?
21	Q No, this case now, Talenfeld Marraffino.
22	I'll ask the question again, for what I'm
23	going to refer to as the Talenfeld case, since that's
24	name of our smoker. Are you comfortable with that?
25	A Yes, I am.
0019
1	Q Have you conducted any case-specific research
2	or have you directed the conduct of any case-specific
3	research that relates directly to the life story,
4	geography or demographics of this particular smoker?
5	A Yes, I have.
6	Q What is the case-specific research that's been
7	performed?
8	A For one, the numerous depositions and
9	interrogatories pertaining to this case. I have also
10	looked at Pittsburgh's specific publications;
11	newspapers, for example. I have also looked at
12	Pennsylvania educational materials. And also, Miami
13	information, as well.
14	Q Miami information, I take it, has been
15	generated for purposes of other cases.
16	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
17	THE WITNESS: That is correct.
18	BY MR. SALES:
19	Q In other words, you didn't have to reinvent
20	the Miami wheel for this case?
21	MR. LUNDT: Form.
22	THE WITNESS: I didn't have to reinvent it,
23	but it's material that I continuously revisit if it
24	pertains to a particular case, as in this Talenfeld
25	case.
0020
1	BY MR. SALES:
2	Q One of the reasons for that might be, for
3	example, that in one case, a smoker lived during a
4	certain time span, and then in another case, a smoker
5	might have stopped smoking at a particular point in
6	time, as examples, right?
7	MR. LUNDT: Form.
8	THE WITNESS: I would answer yes to the first
9	part and no to the second one.
10	BY MR. SALES:
11	Q Do you know if, in fact, the smoker in this
12	case quit smoking before she became ill?
13	A Before she became ill. When --You mean her
14	diagnosis?
15	Q Yes.
16	A If she quit smoking before that?
17	Q Yes.
18	A Yes, the answer is yes.
19	Q What year did she quit smoking?
20	A I have, on the basis of the depositions, I've
21	read about earlier attempts, but there was a major
22	attempt in 1975, if I recall correctly. And then on the
23	basis of the testimonies, I found out that 1979 was the
24	final and definitive quitting moment.
25	Q Do you intend to testify in this case about
0021
1	the status of common knowledge as it relates to any time
2	period after 1979?
3	MR. LUNDT: Form.
4	THE WITNESS: There may be some information on
5	that. That is possible, yes.
6	BY MR. SALES:
7	Q What is the information there may be on that?
8	A Well, similar kinds of publications,
9	newspapers, for example, so I don't necessarily stop the
10	research because somebody quit smoking on that year.
11	Again, because there are many cases, so I try to look at
12	the broad collection.
13	Q I'm asking about what you might say when we
14	try this lawsuit. Are you going to be talking in the
15	trial of this lawsuit about anything that happened after
16	1979?
17	MR. LUNDT: Form.
18	THE WITNESS: That's very probable.
19	BY MR. SALES:
20	Q Probable?
21	A That is correct.
22	Q Tell me what you're going to be talking about
23	that happened after 1979.
24	A Well, based on the same kinds of sources that
25	I use for pre-1979, newspapers, magazines, media
0022
1	coverage, ongoing information to the public about the
2	health risks associated with smoking and the fact that
3	those who smoke may find it very difficult to quit.
4	Q Do you know why you appear as an expert
5	witness in these cases?
6	MR. LUNDT: Form.
7	THE WITNESS: I appear in these cases as a
8	expert historian.
9	BY MR. SALES:
10	Q Do you know what the purpose of your testimony
11	is?
12	MR. LUNDT: Form.
13	THE WITNESS: Purpose of my testimony in
14	court?
15	BY MR. SALES:
16	Q Yes.
17	A Well, my research has produced a narrative
18	about public awareness about smoking and the risks, so
19	that is part of it, based on the thousands of documents
20	that I've examined over the last ten years. And I
21	guess, during cross-examination, I may be asked to
22	answer questions relating to that.
23	Q If Mrs. Talenfeld quit smoking in 1979, what
24	difference does it make what the state of smoking
25	awareness was and smoking and health awareness was after
0023
1	she quit?
2	MR. LUNDT: Form.
3	THE WITNESS: Well, that's the way I do the
4	research. I look at the entire run.
5	BY MR. SALES:
6	Q Well, I understand that. I'm not asking what
7	you did. I'm trying to find out what you're going to
8	say at trial, and I'm trying to find out why you
9	perceive, if you do, and maybe you don't, that anything
10	that happened after 1979 has anything to do with this
11	case, from the perspective of history.
12	A I would --1 want to be ready to answer as
13	many questions as I can, and that's a possible question
14	that I may get.
15	Q All right. Well, one of the purposes, as you
16	know, of taking a deposition of an expert is to find out
17	what they're going to say at the trial. Do you agree?
18	A I agree with that.
19	Q I want you to tell me, whether or not you will
20	agree with me, for purposes of today's deposition, that
21	Mrs. Talenfeld appears to have quit smoking for good in
22	1979.
23	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
24	THE WITNESS: That is the information that I
25	have gathered from the depositions.
0024
1	BY MR. SALES:
2	Q So I want to see if you will agree with me
3	that for purposes of trying to decide whether or not she
4	should have responded to what was publicly available and
5	things about which the public was aware, things that
6	happened after she quit smoking, things that were known
7	after she quit smoking don't have anything to do with
8	this case. Will you agree?
9	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: I don't agree with that.
11	BY MR. SALES:
12	Q Why not?
13	A I don't agree because I can't anticipate the
14	kinds of questions that I'll be asked in court, and I
15	want to be ready to give as -- as full an answer as I
16	can. Therefore, these materials are relevant to my
17	preparation for court, although they may not be within
18	the scope of the time during which Mrs. Talenfeld was a
19	smoker.
20	Q You've met with the lawyers for the tobacco
21	companies in this case, haven't you?
22	MR. LUNDT: Form.
23	THE WITNESS: That is correct.
24	BY MR. SALES:
25	Q Have they discussed with you what you'll be
0025
1	talking about in this case?
2	A Well, it's basically a similar story, based
3	on -- and this is my -- my decision, of course -- based
4	on the almost decade-long research that I've conducted.
5	That's -- that's what I can tell you.
6	Q Tell me what your opinions are that you will
7	be expressing at trial, when asked questions by the
8	lawyers who hired you. I'm not interested in what you
9	might say in response to what I or my partners ask you.
10	Tell me what you will be testifying about in the
11	Defendants' case, when they put on you as an expert,
12	about things that happened after Mrs. Talenfeld quit
13	smoking. What are your opinions?
14	MR. LUNDT: Form.
15	THE WITNESS: Of whether they're going to be
16	asking me questions post-1979?
17	BY MR. SALES:
18	Q What are your opinions?
19	A My opinions are that beginning in the early
20	years of the 20th century, and even before that, there
21	was --
22	Q Excuse me. Sir, I don't mean to interrupt
23	you, but I want to know what your opinions are about
24	what happened after 1979. Please don't tell me anything
25	for this question about what happened before 1979.
0026
1	Okay?
2	MR. LUNDT: Form.
3	BY MR. SALES:
4	Q What are your opinions in this case, the
5	Talenfeld case, that relate to the period starting with
6	1979 and thereafter?
7	MR. LUNDT: Form.
8	THE WITNESS: Well, you interrupted me. I was
9	telling the story about the -- the narrative, which
10	is essentially the same, although as time
11	progressed, more information, more specific and
12	more scientifically-sustained information, became
13	available to the public after 1979.
14	BY MR. SALES:
15	Q What opinions will you express in this case
16	that relates to the period beginning in 1979?
17	MR. LUNDT: Form.
18	THE WITNESS: Basically, the same; that during
19	the period after 1979, there was widespread
20	information and knowledge among -- among the
21	population as to the health consequences of
22	smoking, including a variety of diseases, such as
23	lung cancer, premature death and the like, and also
24	that during that period, there was a massive flow
25	of information reaching the public as to the fact
0027
1	that smoking could be difficult to quit.
2	BY MR. SALES:
3	Q All right. For the period that begins in
4	1979,1 would like you to identify all of the examples
5	of that type of information that you will talk about at
6	trial. I want a list of all of the examples that you
7	will use --
8	MR. LUNDT: Form.
9	MR. SALES: -- for that time period.
10	THE WITNESS: Well, are you asking all of the
11	examples? That would -- that would take me a long
12	time, going back through my notes. I can give you
13	a sampling of the kinds of materials.
14	BY MR. SALES:
15	Q No, sir. This is a discovery deposition, and
16	I'm trying to find out what you're going to say in
17	court, and I want to know what examples, when you come
18	to court and testify before His Honor, Judge Streitfeld,
19	you will be relying on to express your opinions. What
20	are the examples you will talk about at trial? Let's
21	start with 1979.
22	A Well, I have the --
23	MR. LUNDT: Form.
24	THE WITNESS: --1 have my reliance list, and
25	those are -- most of them will be included there.
0028
1	If you want specifics, I can tell you that there
2	are editions of the Miami Herald, for example,
3	post-19 —
4	BY MR. SALES:
5	Q No, I want to know which ones so I can prepare
6	for trial. I want you to go down, starting in 1979, and
7	tick off in the reliance list, which ends with something
8	approaching 6,000. I want you to tell me the examples
9	that you're going to use at trial from your reliance
10	list, starting in 1979.
11	A Okay. Well, I'll go down that list.
12	It begins with J.A. Wood, and the title is,
13	"Smoke Gets In Your Eyes." Then there's something about
14	Pennsylvania Law, Volume One.
15	Q All right. Let me switch pages of your
16	reliance list that you're on.
17	A What page?
18	Q Yes.
19	A Yes. The page is --
20	Q Doesn't it have a page number?
21	A Yes, I'm trying to answer your question. The
22	page is 136.
23	Q All right. Just a minute. Let me get there.
24	This is the reliance list of the Talenfeld case, right?
25	A That is correct.
0029
1	Q All right. I'm on page 136. The one that
2	I've been provided is the 1976. Are you looking at
3	something else?
4	A I'm looking at what -- When 1979 begins, I'm
5	looking at page 136.
6	Q All right. Well, on the reliance list that I
7	was provided in advance of your deposition, 1979 begins
8	on page 144. So we'll just do the best we can. Is the
9	first entry for that year 4562?
10	MR. LUNDT: David, I believe you were provided
11	a more recent reliance list. What date is the one
12	that you have? David?
13	MR. SALES: I didn't create it, so I can't
14	tell you. It looks like September 4th of 2009.
15	MR. LUNDT: Yeah. There was one that we
16	provided to you ten days ago that was dated
17	May 14th of 2010.
18	MR. SALES: Are the numbers different?
19	MR. LUNDT: It's a longer reliance list, yes.
20	MR. SALES: Are the numbers different?
21	MR. LUNDT: I believe the package --
22	MR. SALES: So, for example, for the first
23	entry in September of -- the first entry in 1979
24	that I have that the witness referred to, since
25	it's higher up in the list, it doesn't seem like it
0030
1	would have gotten longer. But, anyway, the "Smoke
2	Gets In Your Eyes," is that 4562?
3	MR. LUNDT: It is not. It is number 4181 on
4	the updated list.
5	MR. SALES: Sounds shorter, not longer.
6	All right. Well, we'll just bump along this
7	way and when we take a break, I'll get the new one.
8	MR. LUNDT: Okay.
9	BY MR. SALES:
10	Q And so that the record is clear, what I want
11	the witness to do is identify the specific examples from
12	the witness's -- the reliance list, not to go through
13	every item on the reliance list. I want to know, in
14	this jurisdiction, where, first of all, the court
15	requires that these lists be shorter than 6,000. I want
16	to know, so that I can examine him effectively, the
17	documents that he is going to be talking about when he
18	testifies at trial. That's what I'm looking for.
19	And I've started, what I thought, was with the
20	easiest place from the post-'79 period, or '79 forward,
21	after the lady had quit smoking. So —
22	MR. LUNDT: And I'll object-
23	MR. SALES: -- just bump along and see how it
24	goes.
25	MR. LUNDT: Okay. I'm just renewing my
0031
1	objection to the line of questioning as to
2	postl979.
3	MR. SALES: I didn't hear your objection.
4	MR. LUNDT: I said I'm objecting to the line
5	of questioning as to post-1979.
6	MR. SALES: Why?
7	MR. LUNDT: Relevancy.
8	MR. SALES: Well, I agree. Why don't you
9	state on the record that you're not going to ask
10	him what happened after 1979. Then we can save,
11	apparently, hours. He doesn't apparently know.
12	I can't imagine that we're going to be talking
13	about what happened in the newspaper. And just as
14	an example, he says he's going to be talking
15	about --
16	BY MR. SALES:
17	Q Well, let me ask you this: When did this lady
18	move to Florida; do you know?
19	A Yes. My recollection is 1971. Before that,
20	she spent a year in Florida, 1958-1959.
21	Q You were about to tell me something about
22	Pennsylvania. Why would you be talking about something
23	that happened in Pennsylvania in the Talenfeld case in
24	1979, when she had already been in Florida for many
25	years --
0032
1	A Well -
2	Q — and if she had already quit smoking?
3	A -- this is a broad list.
4	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
5	THE WITNESS: This is a broad list of
6	materials, so I -- This was not prepared
7	specifically on the basis of pre- or post-1979.
8	Now, I may rely on these materials. I may use
9	them in testimony, but I may not. So they're here
10	because my sense is that they may be used.
11	MR. SALES: I offer to stipulate on the record
12	with counsel that the witness will not be asked
13	about issues of common knowledge and awareness of
14	the health risks of smoking cigarettes after this
15	lady quit smoking cigarettes for good, which is
16	apparently in 1979.
17	Will anyone accept that stipulation?
18	MR. LUNDT: We cannot-
19	MS. LUTHER: David, this is Kelly. I think
20	it's possible -- And I'm not there, so I didn't
21	prepare the witness -- so I think it's possible
22	that post-'79 information that this witness has
23	could be relevant to punitive damages.
24	MR. SALES: All right. True, if that's what
25	he's going to be used for. Counsel present said
0033
1	it's not relevant. So if you all want to take a
2	break and get it together, you can do that. I
3	don't know how to do it without --1 can --1 can
4	hang up and call back, or whatever you want me to
5	do. But I'm going to ask him to identify that in
6	post-1979 records that he's going to talk about,
7	this is a jurisdiction where, in my -- to my
8	understanding, there's a requirement imposed that
9	the exhibit list be reduced from their multiple
10	thousands to a few hundreds. This witness alone
11	has a reliance list numbering in the thousands.
12	I think it's fair, I think it's reasonable,
13	especially with all of the very talented people who
14	are on this phone call, to find out now, in the one
15	discovery deposition that I get, which documents
16	that we need to be ready for to cross-examine him
17	on at trial, and I don't hear that likely to occur
18	so far.
19	So you all tell me what you want me to do.
20	Because what I'm going to do is ask him to
21	identify, not things that he may talk about, but
22	things that he knows he's going to talk about. So
23	if the answer is, it all depends on what the
24	cross-examination is, I suppose I can respect that.
25	But I'm interested in what he's going to be doing
0034
1	on direct examination. That's what the discovery
2	deposition's for. So what would you -- how do you
3	want to proceed, whoever's in charge?
4	MR. LUNDT: I think you should ask him what
5	his opinions are and what he's going to be relying
6	on.
7	MR. SALES: All right. I'll do it.
8	BY MR. SALES:
9	Q Starting with the period January of 1979, tell
10	me which documents you are going to be talking about in
11	the courtroom in the trial of this case, if you can,
12	please.
13	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
14	THE WITNESS: I cannot anticipate which ones I
15	am going to be actually doing. This is a work in
16	process. I can tell you, which you already know,
17	what appears on the list. Now, some of them may be
18	more relevant than others, of course. But I can't
19	really anticipate which ones I'm going to use
20	because they're all here as part of my reliance
21	list.
22	BY MR. SALES:
23	Q Will you agree with me that if there's a
24	Pennsylvania-specific news item or textbook that appears
25	after this lady moved out of Pittsburgh, that it has
0035
1	nothing to do with this case?
2	MR. LUNDT: Form.
3	THE WITNESS: I wouldn't say nothing. I would
4	say that it may not be useful for that period.
5	BY MR. SALES:
6	Q Well, are you able, as we go through the
7	reliance list, to tell me those things that are useful
8	and those things which are not useful in this case?
9	MR. LUNDT: Form.
10	BY MR. SALES:
11	Q Because that's what I want to do. I want to
12	know what's useful and what's not useful.
13	A Okay. Well, I can tell you that I'm not ready
14	to discard any of these items at this point. What I can
15	do, if this is what you want, is to give a quick read to
16	this list and tell you which ones are the most likely to
17	be used, but that would not mean that the others will
18	not be used by me.
19	Q If that's the best I can get, I'll, you know,
20	see what happens when we get to trial, if the judge will
21	accept that.
22	My goal and my purpose is to find out which
23	documents you're going to be testifying about so I can
24	effectively take a deposition of you. It is not
25	possible -- and this comes up in every one of these --
0036
1	to take a discovery deposition of a witness who says, I
2	rely on 7,000 things, 6,000 things.
3	So what I would like you to do is tell me, in
4	this case, which are the ones that you're going to be
5	relying on in the trial. And if the answer is, I rely
6	on all of them, then I don't agree that that's
7	acceptable. I think that the lawyers and the witness
8	have a duty to at least try and narrow the scope of
9	information that allows for an effective deposition.
10	We're starting with the period that's 1979, after the
11	lady quit smoking. It should be easy.
12	So I'm asking you again, please show me, tell
13	me, on the reliance list, those items that you will be
14	talking about, post-'79, at the time of trial.
15	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
16	THE WITNESS: Well, let me clarify first one
17	thing you said, that I don't think I used that
18	wording, and that is that I was going to be using
19	all of these materials. I don't believe I ever
20	used that -- that type of language.
21	What I can do, again, if -- if that's fine
22	with you, is go through this list and, without
23	definitely discarding any one, tell you offhand
24	which are the ones that look more -- more aptly to
25	be used. That, I can do.
0037
1	BY MR. SALES:
2	Q I want to know which documents on your
3	reliance list you will be speaking about at the time of
4	trial.
5	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
6	BY MR. SALES:
7	Q Do you know?
8	A I don't know when the trial will be. I know
9	that this is ongoing research. I will revisit the
10	materials on this list and I will make a determination
11	on whether I will be using these or not later. So
12	you're asking me to do something that I'm not ready to
13	do. I'm not ready to discard any of these documents at
14	this point.
15	Q When will you be ready to give a deposition in
16	which you identify the things that you will be talking
17	about at trial?
18	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
19	THE WITNESS: I'm not sure-
20	BY MR. SALES:
21	Q When will you be ready?
22	A I'm not sure when I would be ready for that.
23	Q How much more time will be necessary for you
24	to complete the ongoing research that you're conducting?
25	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
0038
1	THE WITNESS: Again, I can't tell you that. I
2	don't know when the -- when the proceedings will --
3	will be happening, so I really can't tell you when
4	I'm going to finish my research.
5	BY MR. SALES:
6	Q Well, can we agree that the history of this
7	lady is not going to change in the time between now and
8	the trial, let us say in the calendar year 2010?
9	A I can't say that for sure. I don't know if
10	there's another deposition that will crop up and bring
11	different information. That's why I don't want to
12	remove anything from this list.
13	Q Well, how much more -- assuming no other
14	depositions are taken, no other fact depositions are
15	taken, how much more time will you need to complete your
16	research?
17	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
18	THE WITNESS: I can give you an estimate,
19	maybe four weeks, but that's -- that's something
20	that can change.
21	MR. SALES: Well, I want to take the
22	deposition when the witness is ready to give one.
23	So I'm -- We can do what we can do today, and we
24	can get another opportunity to finish it up. It
25	seems to me we should do it when he's ready. I
0039
1	have no idea what he's talking about.
2	BY MR. SALES:
3	Q What additional ongoing research are you
4	planning on that will take four weeks of your time?
5	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
6	THE WITNESS: Well, let me explain to you.
7	This is what I do with all of my historical
8	scholarship. I look at materials, I make
9	determinations as to whether they will be used or
10	not, but I go back to those materials one more time
11	and make the determination again. And the research
12	does not end, really, until I turn in the final
13	proofs for a book or an article.
14	BY MR. SALES:
15	Q We're not in -- we're not, you know, at the
16	North Carolina publishing house, we're not at the
17	University of North Carolina press, most respectfully.
18	We're in a deposition where it's an adversarial process,
19	where the adverse party gets to know what you're going
20	to say when you take the witness stand. Do you
21	understand that?
22	MR. LUNDT: Object to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: I do understand that, yes.
24	BY MR. SALES:
25	Q Well, I want to know what you're going to say
0040
1	when you take the witness stand. And part of what
2	you're going to do is talk about things that you've
3	looked at, right?
4	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
5	THE WITNESS: That is correct.
6	BY MR. SALES:
7	Q I want to know what you're going to say and I
8	want to know what things you're going to talk about that
9	you've looked at when you testify at trial. Are you
10	willing to tell me that today, or not?
11	MR. LUNDT: Form.
12	THE WITNESS: I can give you a general idea.
13	Again, it depends. I don't know if a court case
14	will happen in two weeks and I have to prepare in
15	two weeks. I don't know.
16	BY MR. SALES:
17	Q What additional work will you need to
18	undertake to decide which of the items you're going to
19	be using among the 6,000 or so?
20	MR. LUNDT: Form.
21	THE WITNESS: There are some
22	Pennsylvania-specific materials that I still need
23	to look at, some of them for the first time. And
24	there are many others that I need to revisit, and
25	that is the way in which I prepare for court
0041
1	testimony.
2	BY MR. SALES:
3	Q Well, have the Pennsylvania-specific materials
4	that you need to look at still, been gathered yet?
5	A I believe I have all of the materials. At
6	this point, I don't discard the possibility of finding
7	new materials.
8	Q Well, an important part of the deposition for
9	me today, not just limited to prior -- to matters that
10	took place after 1979, will be to ask you specifically
11	about Pennsylvania-specific materials. Are you telling
12	me that you have not yet had an opportunity to review
13	the Pennsylvania-specific materials that are available
14	for your review?
15	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
16	THE WITNESS: I did not say that. There are
17	some. I have looked at most of them. There are a
18	few that I have not yet looked at in terms of an
19	in-depth reading, although I am familiar with
20	everything I have pertaining to Pennsylvania during
21	the years when Mrs. Talenfeld lived there. I --1
22	know what I have, and I can speak to that.
23	BY MR. SALES:
24	Q Let's do this, from the period of time of 1979
25	and thereafter, without waiving any rights that I might
0042
1	have, what I perceive to be the impropitious timing of
2	this deposition, I'll just put that it way. I would
3	like to use words that you use.
4	Start in January of 1979 on your reliance list
5	and identify those materials which you perceive to be
6	useful.
7	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
8	THE WITNESS: Okay. Again, let me clarify one
9	more time. I will make an effort, the best and
10	most honest effort, to tell you which ones at this
11	point seem the most promising. And --
12	BY MR. SALES:
13	Q Well -
14	A Let me also clarify something else, and this
15	is what historians do. Let's say that there's a book
16	published in 1979 or an article published in 1980 which
17	has relevant information about pre-1979. I can't
18	discard that. That is relevant to pre-1979, and there
19	are many examples of that.
20	Q All right. Well, as you go through, identify
21	the things that you believe are -- you've used the word
22	useful, you've use the word potentially promising,
23	you've used the word promising. I think those are
24	things you said. As you go through those, if you see
25	anything that fits any kind of categorization, you can
0043
1	put any kind of caveat on it you want, but I would like
2	you now to create a list from the reliance list of the
3	post-79 -- '79 and post materials that you perceive to
4	be useful or promising.
5	A Okay. I'll do that.
6	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
7	BY MR. SALES:
8	Q Whenever you're ready.
9	A I'll do that.
10	Q All right, sir.
11	A Wood, "Smoke Gets In Your Eyes."
12	Q And if you would give the number. And when
13	you switch pages to your new list, just say, "I'm now on
14	page 138, number six, number 12, number 14," and read
15	the names of the documents, that would be adequate.
16	A Okay.
17	Q Thank you.
18	A So the first one is 4181, Wood, "Smoke Gets In
19	Your Eyes." The next one, I would not include in the
20	list of the promising at this point. 4183,1 would not
21	include that one, but, again, there's a possibility that
22	I may.
23	Q What I would like you to do -- not to
24	interrupt, I'm sorry -- is just identify the ones that
25	may be useful or promising. You don't have to mention
0044
1	all the ones that are not.
2	A Okay.
3	Q I think that would save a lot of time.
4	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
5	THE WITNESS: Okay. With the understanding
6	that the ones that I don't mention may be relevant.

17	Now I am moving to page 138. Forty-two --
18	BY MR. SALES:
19	Q Before you do that, can I ask you a question
20	about the last one?
21	A Sure.
22	Q It says, "Maine Governor Vetoes"?
23	A That's correct.
24	Q What's that about?
25	A I can only tell by the title. The full title
0046
1	is "Maine Governor Vetoes Antismoking Legislation," and
2	this is an article in the New York Times.
3	Q Okay. So what does that have to do with this
4	case?
5	MR. LUNDT: Form.
6	THE WITNESS: It is part of the information
7	that appears in the national newspaper about
8	ongoing legislation pertaining to smoking.
9	BY MR. SALES:
10	Q And this is -- might be relevant or promising
11	or useful -- those are the three terms you've used
12	now -- in this case how?
13	MR. LUNDT: Form.
14	THE WITNESS: It may be relevant.
15	BY MR. SALES:
16	Q How?
17	MR. LUNDT: Form.
18	THE WITNESS: Well, let me tell you. For one
19	thing, I have information that Mrs. Talenfeld quit
20	smoking in 1979. I don't know whether it was in
21	January or March or February, and this is a March
22	story. But also, because it is part of the broader
23	story that I put together, and that is that the
24	information was available at a national level and
25	that the information was also available at the
0047
1	local level, so that is why I use other newspapers,
2	not as --
3	BY MR. SALES:
4	Q Why did the governor -- Sorry. Go ahead.
5	A Not as the main source of information for
6	Florida, but it gives me a sense of the ongoing struggle
7	in legislatures throughout the country.
8	Q Are you representing on the record and in good
9	faith that in the trial of the Talenfeld case, you may
10	be talking about antismoking legislation in Maine in
11	1979? Is that a good faith representation to the Court?
12	MR. LUNDT: Form.
13	THE WITNESS: I would say that--that given
14	the large number of materials, that it would be
15	unlikely that I would use that in particular, but I
16	don't want to rule out the possibility. I think it
17	would be unlikely.
18	BY MR. SALES:
19	Q Okay. Well, if something's unlikely, why are
20	you telling me about it now?
21	MR. LUNDT: Form.
22	THE WITNESS: Because, you know, I don't
23	know --
24	BY MR. SALES:
25	Q I thought we were trying to isolate the things
0048
I	that you thought might be useful --
2	A Yes, yes.
3	Q --or relevant in this case.
4	A Well, let me explain to you.
5	Q And I'm asking you to do that in good faith,
6	so that we can try and conduct a meaningful examination.
7	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
8	BY MR. SALES:
9	Q And you're listing, respectfully, virtually
10	everything on the list.
II	MR. LUNDT: Form.
12	THE WITNESS: Well, let me tell you why I'm
13	doing this, and this is in full faith. I don't
14	know, not having gone back to that story, if that
15	story includes information about other states that
16	are doing the same thing, and that may make it
17	relevant. So you're asking me to make judgments on
18	materials that I may have looked at a long time
19	ago. And I can't recall, of course, whether
20	Florida's mentioned or whether there might be
21	something relevant there.
22	BY MR. SALES:
23	Q Well -
24	A Do you understand that -- the point I'm
25	making?
0049
1	Q I understand what you're saying. I don't
2	necessarily agree with it. I understand what you're
3	saying.
4	Let me ask you this: As a historian, working
5	in Florida, and who has a specific interest in Florida,
6	do you know, in 1979, whether Florida, which is where
7	Mrs. Talenfeld lived at that time, was considering
8	antismoking legislation?
9	MR. LUNDT: Form.
10	THE WITNESS: I don't remember specifically
11	for that year. I know that for a long period of
12	time, I guess going back to the '50s, if I recall
13	correctly, and actually even before that, in the
14	early 20th Century, there was legislation and local
15	ordinances having to do with reducing smoking and
16	reducing the numbers of places where you could
17	smoke. I've seen this information for the '50s,
18	'60s, '70s. As to whether that was the case in
19	1979,1 cannot say that without going back to the
20	documents themselves.
21	BY MR. SALES:
22	Q Were you talking about Florida or the entire
23	nation?
24	A I think your question was on Florida, right?
25	Q Yes.
0050
1	A Well, that's -- that was my response.
2	Q Was Florida considering antismoking
3	legislation in 1979, if you know?
4	A I don't know that for a fact for that specific
5	year, no.
6	Q All right. I would like you to identify in
7	good faith those items which you deem to be, in the
8	Talenfeld case, post-'79, after she quit smoking,
9	relevant, useful or promising, terms you've used today.
10	Go ahead.
11	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
12	THE WITNESS: Okay. I'm continuing with page
13	138. 4233, "Cigarette Myths Go Up." 4234, "No
14	Foolproof Way To Quit Smoking." 4235, "Can I Quit
15	Smoking Without Getting Fat?" 4236, "Fewer
16	Harbingers of Cancer Noted." 4237, "Want to Stop
17	Smoking?" 42-
18	BY MR. SALES:
19	Q Where did that appear?
20	A Jacksonville Journal.
21	Q How many miles are there from Jacksonville to
22	Miami; do you know?
23	MR. LUNDT: Form.
24	THE WITNESS: I don't know exactly. I could
25	look it up in Mapquest.
0051
1	BY MR. SALES:
2	Q Would you agree it's more than 250 miles?
3	A Yes.
4	Q Would you agree with me, there's no
5	information in this case that suggests that
6	Mrs. Talenfeld ever read the Jacksonville Journal?
7	MR. LUNDT: Form.
8	THE WITNESS: I have not come across any
9	information that would lead me to believe that she
10	read that newspaper.
11	BY MR. SALES:
12	Q All right. What was the article, "Want to
13	Stop Smoking" about, other than what you can draw from
14	the title?
15	A At this point, given the thousands of articles
16	that I've read and made notes from, I cannot tell you
17	what this article dealt with, other than what I can
18	gather from the title.
19	Q All right. Go ahead.
20	A 4238, this is an article. The last name of
21	the author is Burr, B-u-r-r. The title --
22	Q Can you read -- Yeah. Go ahead, I'm sorry.
23	A -- "Miami Multiple Risk Factor Intervention."
24	4239, "Does a No Smoking Sign Really Mean What
25	It Says?" That's from Good Housekeeping.
0052
1	4240, "Nonsmokers'Rights: What Are They?"
2	Good Housekeeping.
3	4241, it's a Roper poll on health. 4242,
4	"Cancer Report: Progress is Being Made." 4243, Ann
5	Landers. 4244, "Stop Smoking."
6	Q Is that, "Stop Smoking - Control Weight"?
7	A That's correct.
8	Q All right. Go ahead.
9	A 4245, "Survey: Teen-Age Smoking Declines."
10	This is another example of why newspapers from
11	outside of South Florida are relevant, and it is 4246.
12	Q That's "Teen-Age Smoking Declines"?
13	A No. The one I'm about to read.
14	Q Well, let's go back to "Teen-Age Smoking
15	Declines." Where was that from?
16	A Fort Lauderdale news.
17	Q All right. Can we agree that Mrs. Talenfeld
18	was not a teenager in 1979?
19	A Yes, we can agree on that.
20	Q Okay. Go ahead. What's the one that you say
21	is relevant outside the geographic area?
22	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
23	THE WITNESS: 4246, "Miami Area Votes Today On
24	Limits On Smoking." So actually, to your earlier
25	question about whether there was any legislation
0053
1	being considered in 1979, this suggests that.
2	BY MR. SALES:
3	Q All right.
4	A 4247, "Foes of Smoking Limits Appear to Win
5	Miami Vote," and, again, this is the New York Times.
6	4248, "Antismoking Law Defeated by" 200 -- I'm
7	sorry, "by 820 Votes in Miami." That's the New York
8	Times. 4249, "Springtime and Smoke." 4250, "Students
9	Smoking Out Next Year in Hillsborough." 4251, "Cold
10	Turkey Plan Called Easy Way." 4252, "Hypertension,
11	Smoking, Diet." 4253, "Yes, You Can Stop Smoking and
12	Not Gain Weight."
13	Q Can I stop you for a moment there?
14	A Sure.
15	Q Have you seen in anything that you reviewed
16	that there were issues related to Mrs. Talenfeld's
17	decision to smoke or not to smoke that may have had some
18	bearing on potential weight gain or lack of weight gain?
19	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
20	THE WITNESS: I remember reading in one of the
21	depositions that that was a matter of discussion.
22	Not having that in front of me, I couldn't tell you
23	the exact words, but I do get a sense that --
24	again, from reading the deposition -- that they
25	may -- there may have been some --
0054
1	BY MR. SALES:
2	Q All right. Go ahead.
3	A -- weight gain, but that it was not something
4	extreme.
5	Okay. 4253. Well -
6	Q I'm going to have to ask you -- Because we're
7	trying to locate the list, I'm going to have to ask you
8	to give the dates so that I can follow along.
9	A Okay.
10	Q Sorry about that. Go ahead.
11	I was doing pretty well until recently. Go
12	ahead.
13	A 4254, 6/12/1979, "John Wayne Dies." 4255,
14	6/22/1979, "Connecticut Law Restricts Public Smoking,"
15	and that's the New York Times. 4256, 7/15/1979, "A Word
16	to Smokers," and this is the New York Times. 4257,
17	7/23/1979, "Kicking It," Jacksonville Journal. 4258,
18	Book Comer. 4259, 7/24/1979, "Avoid Major Pitfall."
19	4260, 7/28/1979, N.B.C. news clip. 4261,7/28/1979,
20	C.B.S. Evening News. 4262, 7/29/1979, "Here are Key
21	Points of Health."
22	Now I am moving on to page 139.
23	4263, 7/30/1979, Book Comer. 4264,
24	7/30/1979, "Ways to Ease Out of Smoking." 4265,
25	7/31/1979, "Kicking It." 4266, 8 -- something missing
0055
1	in the date. As it reads is 8/00/1979, "Staff Report on
2	Consumer Responses to Cigarette Health," and this is by
3	the F.T.C. 4267, 8/01/1971, "Award Winning Florida
4	Students Write on Smoking Evils."
5	Q May I ask you a question?
6	A Sure.
7	Q What, if anything, are you doing as we go
8	through this to distinguish in good faith between those
9	things which you believe may be relevant, promising or
10	useful, temis you have used, and those which may not be?
11	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
12	BY MR. SALES:
13	Q How are you distinguishing among those items?
14	MR. LUNDT: Fomi.
15	THE WITNESS: Well, so far, the few ones that
16	I've discarded come from local -- very local
17	small-town newspapers in Florida. That is one
18	thing that I used as a distinction.
19	BY MR. SALES:
20	Q So far, are your efforts to draw distinctions
21	limited because, as you explained to me previously, we
22	don't know when or you cannot recall when, perhaps, in
23	1979 Mrs. Talenfeld quit smoking?
24	MR. LUNDT: Form.
25	THE WITNESS: No, I didn't take that into
0056
1	consideration. I started from January 1st, 1979.
2	But the other thing that I wanted to add, in
3	response to your question, is that early on, there
4	were some materials from Pennsylvania schools and
5	North Carolina schools that I --1 don't want to
6	fully discard, but those would be very unlikely for
7	me to use in this case.
8	BY MR. SALES:
9	Q All right. So if we were to turn the clock
10	forward to, let us say, 1980, a date after which we
11	would all apparently agree that Mrs. Talenfeld had quit
12	smoking, would the criteria that you are using to
13	distinguish between those things which are relevant,
14	promising or useful going to remain the same?
15	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
16	THE WITNESS: I don't know because I'm --
17	I'm --1 don't know what kinds of materials
18	specifically will come up in this list. I can tell
19	you --
20	BY MR. SALES:
21	Q Well, who prepared the list?
22	A I'm reading from the reliance list, and this
23	list was prepared by attorneys at Jones Day.
24	Q But everything that's on the list, you gave
25	them to put on it, right?
0057
1	A Everything on the list? I gave them the list
2	of materials that I've been working on, and those would
3	be included here. There are some materials here that I
4	did not --1 did not give to them, necessarily.
5	Q Have you reviewed the reliance list, prior to
6	its submission to me, for preparation for your
7	deposition?
8	A I received it and I looked at it. I gave it a
9	look, not a systematic analysis.
10	Q Will you endorse and adopt this reliance list
11	as your own for purposes of this lawsuit, sir?
12	A My own? Well, it is, as the document states,
13	is -- it is my reliance list.
14	Q Well, I'm asking you a different question.
15	Will you agree that, in fact, that you accept the
16	contents of it as being a listing of the materials upon
17	which you have relied in forming the opinions that you
18	have in this case?
19	MR. LUNDT: Form.
20	THE WITNESS: With the caveat that there may
21	be other materials.
22	BY MR. SALES:
23	Q Let's see how we do if we turn forward to
24	1980. Will you do that for me?
25	A Sure.
0058
1	Q All right. Let's start with 3/21/1980. Do
2	you see that?
3	A 3/21/1980. Dr. Solomon?
4	Q Yes, sir. An article from the Miami Herald,
5	right?
6	A That's correct.
7	Q All right. Let's start doing what you were
8	doing previously. Let's see if it makes a difference,
9	since you weren't able to tell me whether it would make
10	a difference. Let's see if it makes a difference after
11	1980.
12	MR. LUNDT: Objection.
13	BY MR. SALES:
14	Q Before we do that, will you agree with me, for
15	purposes of the next series of questions, that all
16	indications are that by March of 1980, certainly,
17	Mrs. Talenfeld had quit smoking for good?
18	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
19	THE WITNESS: Based on the depositions, that
20	is the information that I --1 gather and I accept
21	to be true.
22	BY MR. SALES:
23	Q All right. Go ahead, then. 3/21/1980, tell
24	me if that is something that in good faith you will
25	represent to me and to the court is promising, useful,
0059
1	or relevant to the Talenfeld case.
2	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
3	THE WITNESS: I would include it as
4	potentially useful. And, again, I'm trying my
5	best, if you can understand what I'm trying to do.
6	I don't have the articles with me, so I am doing an
7	effort to be as honest as I can, but also being
8	very, very careful not to discard any of these
9	until I've had a chance to review them one more
10	time.
11	BY MR. SALES:
12	Q And I'm just trying to do my job, sir, and
13	find out the things that you're going to talk about at
14	the trial. We're not able to do that very well so far
15	because you don't want, to use your terms, discard
16	anything. I'm not asking you to discard anything. And
17	I understand, generally, that when an expert reviews
18	something, that is part of an expert's mental processes,
19	it's part of what the expert knows, it's part of the
20	expert's armamentarium, if you will, of information. I
21	understand that.
22	But we're going to try a lawsuit in Fort
23	Lauderdale, and my goal is to try and find out the
24	things that you will be -- through lawyers, with
25	lawyers' assistance -- showing the jury and talking
1	about. I understand all of these things go into the
2	formulation of the opinions that you have, and you're
3	not the first historian whom I've deposed in these
4	cases, so I get it.
5	But what I'm trying to do to protect my
6	client's interest is to find out what you're going to
7	talk about at the trial. And part of what you're going
8	to talk about -- New question: Do you agree that part
9	of what you're going to talk about at the trial in this
10	case is some of the historic record and give actual
11	examples of such things as newspaper articles, right?
12	A That is correct.
13	Q You just did that down with the same judge,
14	Judge Streitfeld. You gave examples of newspaper
15	articles that you thought were, for whatever reason,
16	important to the opinions that you have in that case,
17	right?
18	MR. LUNDT: Form.
19	THE WITNESS: I gave a sampling of the ones
20	that I thought were important, yes.
21	BY MR. SALES:
22	Q All right. What criteria did you use in
23	evaluating the vast resource of materials available to
24	you to make decisions about what examples you would
25	present at trial in front of Judge Streitfeld and the 0061
1	jury in that case? How did you decide?
2	MR. LUNDT: Form.
3	THE WITNESS: I do that the same way I carry
4	out my -- my own scholarship, and that is, I read
5	the vast amount of information, I take notes. Out
6	of that analysis, a narrative comes out. And then,
7	as I am preparing that -- that information to be
8	disseminated, whether as an article or a book, at
9	that point, I'd make the decisions, this is the
10	best example because it is the most reflective,
11	so --
12	BY MR. SALES:
13	Q Right.
14	A -- that's the same methodology that I use, if
15	that makes sense.
16	Q And the reliance list that you're working off
17	of today, how many total numbers of items are there?
18	A The one I have in front of me, 5,359.
19	Q 5359?
20	A 5359.
21	Q All right. Are you prepared today, from those
22	5,359 items, to identify even one which you will show to
23	the jury as an example of the basis for the opinions
24	that you hold in the Talenfeld case?
25	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
0062
1	THE WITNESS: I have not made those decisions.
2	BY MR. SALES:
3	Q When will they be made?
4	MR. LUNDT: Form.
5	THE WITNESS: They will be made, I suppose,
6	the closer we get to trial, when I put together
7	my -- my story in the form of a -- of a PowerPoint
8	presentation.
9	BY MR. SALES:
10	Q Are you prepared today to even try to identify
11	even one item on the list of 5,359 that you will show
12	the jury so that I can ask you questions about it?
13	MR. LUNDT: Form.
14	THE WITNESS: Well, let me take a look at the
15	list, and I'll try to do my best.
16	BY MR. SALES:
17	Q And I'm not limiting my questions right now to
18	1979 and thereafter.
19	A Yes.
20	Q Might as well cover the waterfront.
21	MR. LUNDT: I'm going to object to the form of
22	that question.
23	MR. SALES: What is the form objection?
24	MR. LUNDT: The form objection is, it's
25	compound and it's confusing. You've been asking
0063
I	about 1979 and post, so --
2	MR. SALES: Well, every - All right. I'll
3	rephrase the question.
4	BY MR. SALES:
5	Q I want to focus on -- since we just said it's
6	5,000 plus -- all 5,000 plus. All right, Doc?
7	A I understand that.
8	Q Can you make that switch?
9	A Yes, I can.
10	Q All right. Are you prepared today, of the
II	whole list, pre- and post-1979, to identify any single,
12	discrete item which you will be talking about with the
13	jury so that I can examine you on it?
14	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
15	THE WITNESS: Yes, I am.
16	MR. SALES: What is the form objection now?
17	MR. LUNDT: The form objection, David, is,
18	you're asking about work product, which documents
19	will be used at trial. Those decisions haven't
20	been made. If you want to talk about which
21	documents the doctor has reviewed and relied on to
22	support his opinions, then ask away.
23	MR. SALES: I'm just trying to find out what
24	he's going to do when he gets to trial. That's
25	what I want to know. The answer to the question,
0064
1	"Which documents have you relied on," are "I relied
2	on everything in the reliance list," so he's done
3	that already. All right.
4	So I haven't heard you instruct him not to
5	answer any question. So the nature of this being a
6	work product problem, which you raise now for the
7	first time, seems not in good faith, most
8	respectfully. So I'm going to ask the question
9	again, and if you tell him not to answer the
10	question, then we know what we all need to do. So
11	I think it's clear, but I'll ask him again.
12	BY MR. SALES:
13	Q Are you prepared today to identify even one
14	item on the list of 5,000 plus, pre- and post-1979, that
15	you will be expressing opinions about at the trial in
16	this case?
17	MR. LUNDT: I'm going to object to the form of
18	the question.
19	Doctor, you can answer if you know.
20	THE WITNESS: I am pretty sure that one of the
21	ones that I will be using appears -- let's see, is
22	number 33 on page two.
23	BY MR. SALES:
24	Q Title, please.
25	A "School Law" -- no, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
0065
1	that one.
2	Q You mean the 1885, "Laws of the State of
3	Florida Schools"?
4	A No, I'm wrong about that. There's an -- that
5	wouldn't be one.
6	But -- I'm sorry, this is a mistake I made. I
7	meant number 31, "Laws of the General Assembly of the
8	Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
9	Q All right. Number 31. What else?
10	A You asked me about one, and I gave you one.
11	Q All right. I want more, whatever else you're
12	aware of at this time.
13	MR. LUNDT: Form.
14	THE WITNESS: I'm trying to do my best, but
15	you're asking me to tell you which ones for sure.
16	BY MR. SALES:
17	Q The words "for sure" have never came across my
18	mouth today. I don't mean to be disrespectful, but all
19	I'm trying to do is to find out if you know. And if the
20	answer is, "I don't know," that's fine, I'll accept that
21	and deal with it as I need to. I'm just trying to find
22	out what you do know, what your level of preparation is.
23	So I'll ask the question again. Other than
24	number 31, are you prepared today to identify any other
25	items which you believe you will be expressing opinions
0066
1	about at the trial in this case?
2	MR. LUNDT: Form.
3	THE WITNESS: I'm not prepared to do that,
4	unless I had a chance to review them one more time.
5	I can tell you this. I have a book -- a
6	couple of books in -- in process. I have what
7	appears to be very polished drafts of those. But
8	at this point, I cannot tell you whether that
9	particular piece of information or source will
10	appear in the final. So that's the best analogy
11	that I can give you. These are final decisions
12	that are made at -- at -- at the end of the
13	process.
14	BY MR. SALES:
15	Q So that we can try and accomplish something
16	today, is the answer to my question, most respectfully,
17	"Today, Mr. Sales, I'm not prepared to identify any
18	other items about which I may express an opinion at the
19	time of trial" ?
20	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
21	BY MR. SALES:
22	Q That's okay. We'll just do something else.
23	Is that where we are?
24	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
25	THE WITNESS: That's where we are, sir.
0067
1	BY MR. SALES:
2	Q All right. Let's go--it just so happens to
3	be the next thing on my list, and it's educational
4	materials. I want to ask you about that as it relates
5	to Mrs. Talenfeld. Okay?
6	A Okay.
7	Q Are you going, in this case, to be identifying
8	any specific textbooks which you will express an opinion
9	to the effect that Mrs. Talenfeld either did or may
10	have -- either was or may have been exposed to such
11	textbooks while a student in any school?
12	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
13	THE WITNESS: Yes, I am ready.
14	BY MR. SALES:
15	Q All right. Are you prepared today in the
16	deposition to identify those textbooks which you may
17	express an opinion about that Mrs. Talenfeld either was
18	exposed to them or was exposed to them? Let me rephrase
19	the question.
20	Are you going to -- Are you able to identify
21	those textbooks which you believe Mrs. Talenfeld either
22	saw or was exposed to?
23	MR. LUNDT: Form.
24	THE WITNESS: I can give you a couple of
25	examples, if that's -- if that's enough.
0068
1	BY MR. SALES:
2	Q No. I want you to identify on your reliance
3	list all of the textbooks which you may come into court
4	and say, "I believe that this lady either saw or may
5	have seen this textbook." I need to know the list of
6	them so that I can prepare to cross-examine you at
7	trial.
8	A Yes.
9	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: Let me tell you what I have. I
11	have a tentative list of textbooks that she may
12	have been in contact with as a student in
13	Pennsylvania, during the years that she was at the
14	different course levels. I do have a list of that.
15	I can read it, if that's what you want.
16	BY MR. SALES:
17	Q I want to know --1 want to know every
18	possible textbook that you may say that she saw when she
19	came -- when you come to trial. Are you ready to do
20	that today?
21	A Not every possible textbook. I have a
22	tentative list, which I --1 --1 will continue to work
23	on, but I have a few of those.
24	Q We may just be miscommunicating. And I
25	understand you're being very cautious, and I respect
0069
1	that.
2	I'm trying to create a universe of potentials
3	now. Okay? So on the textbooks, I want the universe of
4	potentials, the things that you may come into court and
5	say, "This is one of textbooks in play." Are you
6	prepared to do that today?
7	A Not the universe.
8	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
9	BY MR. SALES:
10	Q What more work needs to be done for you to be
11	able to provide me or anyone with a list of the
12	potential universe of textbooks that you're going to
13	talk about at the trial? Those are the ones that I'm
14	focusing on.
15	A I would need to revisit the materials that
16	speak to the subject of adopted textbooks in
17	Pennsylvania schools.
18	Q Well, how did you compile the tentative list
19	that you have now?
20	A By looking at some of those materials.
21	Q How much more time is necessary for you to
22	compile what would be a potentially exhaustive list on
23	the reliance list of those textbooks to which a smoker
24	might have been exposed?
25	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
0070
1	THE WITNESS: It depends. The short answer
2	would be, I could give you a better list. I could
3	put that together, say, in a day, but I may want to
4	do some further research to try to pinpoint more
5	specifically that list.
6	BY MR. SALES:
7	Q All right. When did -- is the list of
8	potential textbooks that you have -- excuse me, the
9	tentative list of textbooks with you today?
10	A Yes, it is.
11	Q Is it on a piece of paper?
12	A It is.
13	MR. SALES: Let's call that Exhibit 3.
14	(Exhibit 3 was marked for identification.)
15	MR. LUNDT: Exhibit 3 has been marked.
16	BY MR. SALES:
17	Q Are the books on Exhibit 3, do they correlate
18	to the exhibit -- do they correlate to the item numbers
19	on the reliance list?
20	A I would have to search by title.
21	Q Does it have the alpha code used by the
22	lawyers for Reynolds?
23	A I'm not sure that they're all there.
24	Q Okay. Well, we're going to have to find them
25	on the reliance list, so I'm apparently not looking at
0071
1	the right one. I've been trying to get somebody to
2	locate it here. I'm not sure it was served on us. So
3	far, nobody has it. So when we take a break, if
4	somebody could cause that to be e-mailed, that would be
5	helpful, but I don't think that's an impediment for
6	purposes of these questions right now.
7	Read the list to me, if you would, please, and
8	let's take whatever identifying information that we
9	have.
10	A Again, this is the list of textbooks that she
11	may or may not have. To the best of my knowledge, at
12	this point, I would say that this is the list. But, as
13	I said earlier, it would require further refining, but
14	I'll go ahead and give you the authors.
15	Q Does that mean there may be more or less or
16	possibly either/or?
17	MR. LUNDT: Form.
18	THE WITNESS: There could be more, there could
19	be less.
20	BY MR. SALES:
21	Q I should say fewer. Excuse me. Go ahead.
22	A Okay. Newmayer, N-e-w-m-a-y-e-r. The title
23	of that book is Pathways in Healthland. The same --
24	Q Do you have the publication date?
25	A Not -- not on the list I have in front of me.
0072
1	Q All right. Go ahead. Do you have any other
2	identifying information?
3	A I have other identifying information that
4	these are books that were used in primary school.
5	Q Do you have any additional identifying
6	information for where this particular item appears on
7	the reliance list?
8	A Not on the reliance list, no. I haven't
9	crosschecked.
10	Q Is it -- is it on the reliance list?
11	A I am not a hundred percent sure about that.
12	What I can tell you is that I put this list together
13	late last night.
14	Q What were you looking at when you decided to
15	include this volume on the Exhibit 3?
16	A Volume -- Pathways in Healthland?
17	Q Yes. How did you know to include that?
18	A Because I looked at reports on health
19	education in the State of Pennsylvania that included
20	information about adoptions of textbooks.
21	Q All right. Which item on your reliance list,
22	if it is on your reliance list, did you look at for that
23	purpose?
24	A I looked specifically at the Means report --
25	and there may have been more than one -- for the State
0073
1	of Pennsylvania.
2	Q Can you identify them, please.
3	A It may take a while, because I don't have a
4	date for that with me.
5	Q Well, when you were looking at it last night,
6	where were you looking at it?
7	A I was looking at the original -- or I should
8	say a photocopy of the original.
9	Q Were you in your office?
10	A I was at home.
11	Q How did you retrieve it last night?
12	A How did I retrieve the Means report?
13	Q Right.
14	A I have that copy at home, and I also have
15	notes on that report.
16	Q All right. Well, I'd like to know what the
17	source material was that you relied on by item number on
18	your reliance list, alpha code, whatever, name,
19	something, so that I can check what it is that you've
20	done. I may not do it while we're on the phone today,
21	but that's what my goal is. So if you don't know where
22	the book is on the reliance list and you don't know
23	where on the reliance list the item is, how do you
24	recommend that we do that?
25	A Well, I think that it was a publication, I
0074
1	want to say, from the 1990s. So one way of doing this
2	is to start at the back of the report and see if it's
3	there.
4	Q All right.
5	A You want me to do that?
6	Q I want you to find out where, on the materials
7	that you're relying on in this case, which resulted, at
8	least for purposes of these questions, in the production
9	of Exhibit 3. I want to see where you got that from.
10	So whatever is the most convenient way for you, as the
11	expert historian, to retrace your historical research
12	steps with the methods and means you have at your
13	disposal, that's what I would like you to do. I'm not
14	trying to get you to do it any way.
15	A Okay.
16	Q I don't know if somebody can put it -- throw
17	it up on a computer screen and have you search it, if
18	that's possible. The document that I just received --
19	and I did receive it, thank you -- is -- so far, maybe
20	it could be converted, but it's not searchable. And so
21	I'm--I'm, you know, at your mercy. I would like you
22	to tell me what you looked at or where you got it
23	from --
24	A Okay.
25	Q --to make Exhibit 3.
0075
1	A Well, the way I'll proceed is, starting from
2	the back, moving forward, until I --
3	Q Sure.
4	A -- see it. If...
5	Okay.
6	MR. SALES: And I don't mind, if Ms. Lawson's
7	version that she's e-mailed to me -- thank you --
8	is searchable, for you to help the witness, because
9	it really is a discovery issue. It's not a memory
10	test issue. The one that I have is not searchable,
11	at least at the moment. So feel free to help out
12	for the moment.
13	MS. LAWSON: Do you want to take a break and
14	let us look, David?
15	MR. SALES: Yeah. I mean, and truly, so that
16	you all understand, I mean, I -- this is --1 think
17	these questions are very straight up. I want to
18	know what he's going to talk about, which books,
19	just to draw a circle around it.
20	The witness is extremely cautious, I
21	understand and appreciate that. But I just want to
22	know the books that we may have to look at that I
23	may see thrown up on the screen, and I should have
24	the opportunity to look at the ones that he didn't
25	put on there, and the only way to find that out is
0076
1	to see where he drew his list from. That's totally
2	fair, regardless of what's happened today.
3	So I can't do that because I didn't do the
4	research. And I'm going to do the same thing, sort
5	of, with the newspapers. You've heard me do this
6	at least two or three times, so there's no mystery.
7	So, yeah, whatever you want to do.
8	MS. LAWSON: Why don't we take short break.
9	MR. SALES: And I don't care if the lawyers
10	tell me which books it's going to be, to be honest
11	with you.
12	MS. LAWSON: Well, I think the witness told
13	you the name of at least one of the books before
14	you asked him to locate them there.
15	MR. SALES: Yeah, we've only --1 mean the
16	books that he got the books from.
17	MS. LAWSON: Okay.
18	MR. SALES: However you all want to proceed.
19	He's -- You're his helper, if you want to be. He's
20	the witness, and I'm just trying to find out what
21	the list is and where they came from.
22	MS. LAWSON: All right.
23	MR. SALES: So how do you want to do it?
24	MS. LAWSON: Why don't we take --
25	MR. SALES: You want to take a break? It's
0077
1	almost two hours of this, anyway.
2	MS. LAWSON: Yes, I think we could all use a
3	restroom break, at the very least.
4	MR. SALES: All right. How about --1 have
5	11:22. How about 11:30? Is that good?
6	MS. LAWSON: I think that's fine.
7	MR. SALES: I'm just going to put you on
8	speaker, and when you -- you can mute me, if you
9	want. And when you're ready, just start talking.
10	Okay? All right. Bye.
11	(A recess was taken.)
12	MR. LUNDT: Okay.
13	BY MR. SALES:
14	Q Doctor, are you ready?
15	A Yes, I am.
16	Q All right. It's now 11:50. We broke at
17	11:22. During the 28 intervening minutes, have you all
18	been able to figure out what the source materials are
19	for the identification of the potential texts which you
20	may be talking about at trial?
21	A The question is for me?
22	Q Yes.
23	A Well, you say you all --
24	Q Or whoever is going to respond. I did say I
25	would let the lawyers do it, I guess. Are you -- can
0078
1	you answer the question?
2	A Yes.
3	Q All right. I have a hard copy now of the
4	reliance list. Does the information come from the
5	reliance list?
6	A Yes, it does.
7	Q Which page number?
8	A Page 18. First item is 516, "Journal of the
9	Board of Public Education," for the year 1941.
10	Q All right. And what is that?
11	A That is one of the reports used for the
12	preparation of the list.
13	Q During our break, did you consult the hard
14	copy, or are you just -- have you had -- well, let me
15	back up.
16	During our break, have you consulted the hard
17	copy or electronic copy of number 516?
18	A Of the item itself?
19	Q Yes.
20	A No.
21	Q Do you believe that number 516 includes a list
22	of textbooks that may have been in use at any school
23	attended by the smoker in this case?
24	A There are some of those textbooks here, yes,
25	on the list.
0079
1	Q Sir, would you focus your attention on number
2	516, please.
3	A 516?
4	Q Yes, the one you just identified for me.
5	A Yeah, I'm looking at it.
6	Q All right. Do you believe that number 516
7	will include a list of approved textbooks which may have
8	been in use in Mrs. Talenfeld's school or schools, any
9	of them?
10	A It is possible. On second reading, the title
11	has to do with a Philadelphia district.
12	Q All right.
13	A Which doesn't speak to the state as a whole,
14	but this would be one of the sources that lists
15	textbooks.
16	Q Okay. Well, I'm only interested in -- so we
17	can draw a circle around this as we go along, I'm only
18	interested in identification of textbooks which you,
19	within a reasonable degree of historic probability, if
20	that's the appropriate expression, may say, at trial,
21	"Mrs. Talenfeld may have been exposed to such a
22	textbook."
23	A Yes.
24	Q So can we agree, for purposes of this
25	question, that it does not appear that she went to
0080
1	school in Philadelphia?
2	A That is correct.
3	Q All right. Is it your testimony in this case
4	that Pennsylvania had statewide approval standards for
5	textbooks, or was it on a local school district basis,
6	if you know?
7	A My understanding is that it was on a local
8	district level.
9	Q All right. What is the next document that you
10	all have identified in our break?
11	A Well, I have a document in front of me. The
12	title is, "Pennsylvania School Districts Textbook
13	Report." This has been authored by Richard K. Means,
14	M-e-a-n-s. The date is July 1997.
15	Q Is that on your reliance list?
16	A As such, the title, I don't believe it is.
17	The materials in -- inside the report that are alluded,
18	I believe most of them are.
19	Q Do you have the whole book with you?
20	A The Pennsylvania School Districts Textbook
21	Report?
22	Q Yes.
23	A Yes, I do have that in front of me, the whole
24	thing.
25	Q All right. Did you bring it with you today?
0081
1	A I did. I have it in front of me.
2	Q Did you bring it with you today, or was it
3	provided to you while the deposition has been going on?
4	A I brought it with me today.
5	Q How many pages is it?
6	A It's hard to tell, because the report includes
7	photocopies of a variety of publications as sort of
8	appendices.
9	Q Where did you get it?
10	A This is a report that I believe I asked a
11	fellow historian to provide me with.
12	Q Who was that?
13	A Bill Stueck.
14	MR. SALES: All right. We'll attach that as
15	Exhibit 4 to the deposition.
16	THE WITNESS: Let me add something. That is
17	one of the possible sources of the report. The
18	other possible source is History Works, the company
19	in Chicago.
20	MR. SALES: Let's focus on what is going to be
21	Exhibit 4. Will you give it to the court reporter
22	to be marked, please.
23	(Exhibit 4 was marked for identification.)
24	MR. LUNDT: It's been marked.
25	BY MR. SALES:
0082
1	Q Does Exhibit 4 include a list of school
2	textbooks that may have been in use at any school
3	attended by Mrs. Talenfeld during her youth?
4	A Yes, it does.
5	Q What are the page or pages or whatever other
6	information you can provide me with in Exhibit 4 which
7	includes such a list or lists?
8	A Okay. Let me look at the pages. Inside of
9	this publication, there's a subsection entitled,
10	"Pennsylvania District Adopted Textbook Report," and
11	that -- that begins on page one. And it goes through --
12	bear with me just a second. And then there's another --
13	that goes through page two, the introduction.
14	And then there's another section, "Special
15	Textbook Analysis." That's one page. There's another
16	segment entitled, "State Textbook Listings, Initial
17	Draft," and that includes -- that includes 12 pages.
18	And then there's another section, which is
19	entitled, "Pennsylvania District Adopted Textbooks,
20	Final Draft," and that is seven pages.
21	Q Do you believe any of those sections or
22	materials are included as discrete items on your
23	reliance list?
24	A The -- the titles that I just mentioned, no,
25	but the textbooks themselves, many --
0083
1	Q Why -- Sorry.
2	A The textbooks themselves, as they appear in
3	this report, those are part of my reliance list. Most
4	of them, if not all.
5	Q You have relied on this volume that includes
6	the sections that you've just provided to me for
7	determination of potential textbooks that would be in
8	play, as I understand it, right?
9	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: Yes, that is correct.
11	BY MR. SALES:
12	Q Sir?
13	A That is correct.
14	Q Why isn't this document, the Pennsylvania
15	School Districts report from 1997, also on your reliance
16	list?
17	A It's not, with the title Pennsylvania School
18	District Textbook Report. The materials that are inside
19	of this report are.
20	Q All right.
21	A But, you're right, the actual title as I read
22	it to you, does not appear in such fashion in the
23	reliance list.
24	Q When you say, the materials inside are on the
25	reliance list, are you referring to the discrete books
0084
1	described, or the compilation of the various lists that
2	make up the sections that you've referred me to?
3	A Well, they would be documents, such as general
4	curriculum requirements, regulations of the State Board
5	of Education of Pennsylvania, the elementary course of
6	study. Those are the kinds of materials that appear in
7	this report. They're actually the bulk of the report.
8	Q I'm trying to find out if the content of the
9	report, the various discrete items that you referred me
10	to moments ago, are themselves identified as discrete
11	item on the reliance list.
12	MR. LUNDT: Form.
13	THE WITNESS: Discrete items. I'm not
14	familiar with that language. Could you be more
15	specific?
16	BY MR. SALES:
17	Q You just went through the Pennsylvania School
18	Districts report, telling me which pages were of
19	significance to you, right?
20	A That is correct.
21	Q You mentioned various sections of that report
22	by name and referenced the pages. Do you recall that?
23	A Yes, I recall that.
24	Q Are the things that are included in those
25	various separate sections, not the book names
0085
1	themselves, but the items contained in this Pennsylvania
2	School District report, on your reliance list?
3	A As such, I don't believe they are, no.
4	Q Why not?
5	A This was a list that I did not put together as
6	a reliance list, so I really don't have an answer for
7	that.
8	Q You said that you got it from either -- it's
9	Dr. Stueck, right?
10	A Either from him --
11	Q Or History Works?
12	A --or History Works.
13	Q Well, who is Dr. Stueck?
14	A He is a professor, I believe, at the
15	University of Georgia.
16	Q And what is History Works?
17	A History Works is a professional organization
18	that support research. The only thing I know for sure
19	is that they do have an extensive collection of
20	materials, and that they would also be willing to find
21	materials that I may have identified but have no access
22	to.
23	Q Has your consulting of Exhibit 4 today, during
24	our break or thereafter, caused you to refine or change
25	in any way the tentative list that is included in
0086
1	Exhibit 3?
2	A It's still tentative. I --1 would alter
3	this, because there is a final draft with information
4	that may be similar but may be different from the
5	information on the preliminary draft.
6	Q Whose drafts are you referring to?
7	A In the -- inside the Pennsylvania School
8	District Textbook Report, there's sections that are
9	called either preliminary draft or final draft.
10	Q Have you altered your tentative draft --
11	excuse me. Have you altered your tentative list of
12	Exhibit 3 since we took our break at 11:22 --
13	A No.
14	Q -- or is it the same?
15	A I have not altered it. I've become aware that
16	there is another final draft, so my intention would be
17	to use the final draft, rather than the preliminary
18	draft, for the final listing.
19	Q How did you become aware that there was
20	another draft of whatever it is you're looking at?
21	A Well, during the break, I was examining the
22	Pennsylvania School District Textbook Report, and I saw
23	that --1 realized that there were two lists, one
24	preliminary, one final.
25	Q Are they different?
0087
1	A I suppose they are.
2	Q Are they different in any way that may
3	materially relate to the life of Mrs. Talenfeld?
4	A In terms of the books that they may include?
5	Q Yes.
6	A Probably.
7	Q Are you prepared today to tell me how your
8	tentative list of textbooks, Exhibit Number 3, might
9	change if you conduct additional research by looking at
10	what you've discovered during the break?
11	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
12	THE WITNESS: Well, it would certainly change,
13	yes. For one thing, if you look at a document that
14	says draft and then you look at another one that
15	says final, I would lend the most credibility, of
16	course, to the one that says final, which I haven't
17	had a chance to analyze yet. As I --1 think I
18	said earlier, that this is a list that I put
19	together last night.
20	BY MR. SALES:
21	Q Are you able, sitting in the deposition today,
22	to tell me what additional modifications may result from
23	discovering what you discovered during the break today?
24	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
25	THE WITNESS: Possibility is that the list of
0088
1	textbooks will change.
2	BY MR. SALES:
3	Q You told me that. I want to know what the
4	changes will be. Are you prepared to tell me today what
5	the changes will be so I can move on to something else?
6	A I understand, but you're asking me to compare
7	two documents. It will take some time for me to be able
8	to do that methodically. So if you have the time --
9	Q So the answer is, to make it simple, so that
10	we don't burden the record with all of this precision,
11	is, "No, today, Mr. Sales, I'm not prepared to tell you
12	how my tentative list might change." That seems simple
13	enough, right?
14	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
15	THE WITNESS: You know, the question was if I
16	could do it today. My answer is, I could do it
17	today if I had the time to do it. I think I
18	responded.
19	BY MR. SALES:
20	Q How many hours do you need, or minutes?
21	Because you had 28. How many do you need?
22	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
23	THE WITNESS: Probably an hour.
24	BY MR. SALES:
25	Q All right. Well, we'll see how everybody
0089
1	feels at the end of the deposition. And if the lawyers
2	who have retained you think that that's a productive way
3	to handle this, I want those questions to be answered.
4	I don't agree to taking what would then be a total of an
5	hour and a half break for the witness to answer a
6	question, to wit: Which textbooks are you going to talk
7	about?
8	So let's go down the reliance list now,
9	starting with number 516, that's where you left off, and
10	then we crossed that one out. What else have you
11	identified on the reliance list during our 28-minute
12	break that you want to tell me about?
13	A Well, the first thing that I would like to say
14	is that this is something that one of the lawyers was
15	looking at in reference to the textbooks that I have in
16	my tentative report. So I, myself, did not do this.
17	Q And I said, to make it simple and faster, that
18	I would accept the lawyers'representations. Have they
19	shared with your their efforts to try and figure out
20	which textbooks you're going to talk about?
21	A No, that's not --
22	Q It's fine. I just want to know what they are
23	now. Can we go through the list?
24	A Sure, we can go through the list.
25	Q All right. Have you also attempted to isolate
0090
1	on your list any other source materials for lists of
2	textbooks which you may express an opinion about during
3	the trial of this case?
4	MR. LUNDT: Form.
5	THE WITNESS: When you say "list," what are
6	you referring to? Because there's a reliance list,
7	there's my list of textbooks, tentative.
8	BY MR. SALES:
9	Q I think my question was clear, but I'll make
10	it clearer for you.
11	I want you to tell me if, on your reliance
12	list, there are any other source documents which
13	identify lists of textbooks which you may express an
14	opinion about in this case.
15	A There may be.
16	Q What are they?
17	A I can tell you the ones that I looked at and
18	marked. Actually, I take that back. This was one of
19	the lawyers looking at the list.
20	Q Which of the lawyers did it? Maybe we should
21	ask them.
22	A Christine Lawson.
23	Q All right. Are you sufficiently capable of
24	understanding whatever Ms. Lawson has provided to you,
25	to go down the list with me so I can ask you questions
0091
1	about the reliance list and whether or not the reliance
2	list includes any list of textbooks which you may talk
3	about?
4	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
5	BY MR. SALES:
6	Q Are you prepared to do that?
7	A Yes, I am.
8	Q All right. What -- is there anything before
9	number 516?
10	A 463.
11	Q Yes, sir.
12	A 467.
13	Q Now, I'm going to ask you about it. That's
14	Personal Hygiene Applied, Williams?
15	A Personal --
16	Q Is that 463?
17	A Yes, that is correct.
18	Q That sounds like it's a book, a school book,
19	right?
20	A That sounds -- that is what it is, actually.
21	Q Before we talk about the school books, which
22	I'd like to do, I have asked you if you can identify on
23	the reliance list any of the other source materials used
24	for identification of which textbooks might have been in
25	play. I would like to do that first, before I go to the
0092
1	actual books. Are there any such documents on your
2	reliance list?
3	A I don't think there are.
4	Q Is it correct, then, that all of the
5	information upon which you have relied in terms of
6	finding or identifying textbooks that Mrs. Talenfeld
7	might have been exposed to have come from Exhibit 4 to
8	the deposition?
9	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: Exhibit 4 being the Means
11	report?
12	BY MR. SALES:
13	Q Yes.
14	A Yes. At this point, that would be the answer,
15	yes.
16	Q Well, at what point might it change?
17	A I don't know. I may come across another
18	document that has another list. That's how historians
19	operate. We come across documents that may or may not
20	alter our conclusions.
21	Q Well, just so we're clear, you're not telling
22	me that in the universe of things you might come across,
23	are things on your reliance list, because you've already
24	come across everything on the reliance list, right?
25	MR. LUNDT: Form.
0093
1	THE WITNESS: That is correct.
2	BY MR. SALES:
3	Q So just to leave this area, so that we have
4	total clarity, on the reliance list that we have today,
5	which we'll mark at the end of the deposition, are there
6	any other source materials from which you have drawn a
7	list of textbooks that you say or may say Mrs. Talenfeld
8	might have been exposed to?
9	A To this point, no.
10	Q Well, my question --1 still feel like I don't
11	know if I'm communicating with you well. Is it possible
12	there's something else on the reliance list that would
13	fit the description of a document I've just rendered
14	that we cannot yet identify?
15	A I don't exclude that possibility. I don't
16	think that's the case.
17	Q Well, if you don't know, who does know what's
18	on your reliance list?
19	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
20	THE WITNESS: I know what's on the reliance
21	list.
22	BY MR. SALES:
23	Q All right. If you know what's on the reliance
24	list, you're talking about things on the list as
25	possibilities. I would like to eliminate it from the
0094
1	realm of the possible and ask you: On your list, are
2	there any other source materials that you used for
3	identification of school books in this case? That's all
4	I'm trying to find out.
5	A I don't think there are.
6	Q All right. Is what remains that we have done
7	during the break in effort to identify the relevant
8	school books, are you ready to do that now?
9	A Yes.
10	Q All right. 463 was the one you mentioned,
11	"Personal Hygiene Applied," Williams, right?
12	A Correct.
13	Q Do you know what level of textbook that was?
14	A Let me double --
15	Q Meaning elementary or other secondary, high
16	school.
17	A That would be high school.
18	Q Next?
19	A 467, "Be Healthy." That -
20	Q And as we go down these, let me ask you this:
21	I would like you to tell me whether or not the ones that
22	we're going through are included on the tentative list
23	of Exhibit 3 or not, so let's go back.
24	Is number 463 on the tentative list?
25	A I'm looking. Yes.
0095
1	Q All right. Is number 467, Be Healthy, on the
2	tentative list?
3	A Yes, it is.
4	Q What are the dates that number 463 was in use
5	in the Pittsburgh school system?
6	A 463? I don't have the full documentation
7	as -- but I do have the information that they were used
8	as high school textbooks during the time that
9	Mrs. Talenfeld was in high school.
10	Q Where did you get that information from?
11	A From the report that we've been talking about,
12	Pennsylvania School District Textbook Report, and --
13	Q All right.
14	A -- since -- Okay.
15	Q Be Healthy, Crisp K, number 467. What level?
16	A High school.
17	Q When was it in use in Pittsburgh?
18	A It was used during the period between -- it
19	was at least used during the period between 1944 and
20	'48.
21	Q What is the source of that information?
22	A The source of that information is the
23	Pennsylvania School District Textbook Report.
24	Q On Exhibit 3 or not on Exhibit 3?
25	A Exhibit 3, yes. Yes.
0096
1	Q It's on there?
2	A Yes, it is.
3	Q Next?
4	A Okay. Number 507, "Making Life Healthful."
5	The author is Fowlkes, F-o-w-l-k-e-s.
6	Q Level?
7	A Level, that would be junior high.
8	Q Dates of use in the Pittsburgh school system?
9	A At the very least, between 1942 and 1944.
10	Q Source of that information?
11	A The same source.
12	Q Have you been provided with any educational
13	records for Mrs. Talenfeld?
14	A I do have one particular record, I do.
15	Q What is it?
16	A It is a transcript from the University of
17	Pittsburgh.
18	Q Have you endeavored to find whether or not you
19	can determine any of the textbooks used for any of her
20	college classes?
21	A No, I haven't been able to determine that.
22	Q Haven't been able to. Did you endeavor to do
23	so?
24	A Not yet, and I don't think that would be easy
25	to find, so I may not want to pursue that avenue.
0097
1	Q Why would that be hard to find?
2	A Well, because unlike school textbooks, which
3	are determined and adopted, in universities, professors
4	use whatever books they choose to use, for the most
5	part, so it would be very hard to pin that textbook
6	down.
7	Q Well, you could look at the transcript -- is
8	it a single page transcript, by the way?
9	A Single page?
10	Q Yes.
11	A I think it's -- it's -- it's one page.
12	Q You could look at the courses by their title
13	and make a reasoned judgment, as a historian, as to
14	whether or not you would be wasting your time to
15	determine whether or not she received, as a college
16	student, information about smoking and health, couldn't
17	you?
18	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
19	THE WITNESS: I've looked at the courses.
20	There's one that may apply. In terms of wasting
21	time, I think my time could be used better in other
22	ways, rather than try to find the syllabus for that
23	course, which may not exist.
24	BY MR. SALES:
25	Q Well, for example, there's a course titled,
0098
1	Classics, Mythology, in which she got a D, as in dog, by
2	the way. We could be fairly confident in saying that
3	the textbooks likely used in her Greek or Roman
4	mythology class probably didn't have to do much with
5	smoking and health, right?
6	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
7	THE WITNESS: I would agree with that, yes.
8	BY MR. SALES:
9	Q All right. So what is the -- and similar
10	statements could be made about classes such as modern
11	dance, right?
12	A Correct.
13	Q In which she got an A, by the way.
14	What is the one course on this transcript
15	which you think, assuming the source material could be
16	identified and located, that would have relevance to the
17	issues for which you are appearing in this case?
18	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
19	THE WITNESS: Well, there may be - and this
20	is just trying my best. There are two psychology
21	courses, one of which is Applied Psychology. The
22	other one is General Psychology. So it is a
23	possibility that -- that whatever materials were
24	used in that course would have included topics on
25	addiction, narcotics, things of that sort.
0099
1	BY MR. SALES:
2	Q All right. In any event, you don't plan on
3	going back and looking for college textbooks, I guess,
4	right?
5	A Not at this point, no.
6	Q Okay. 507. What is the next one? I think we
7	went through that one. What's next?
8	A 508.
9	Q Yes.
10	A Success.
11	Q And I'm going to ask you, if you want to speed
12	things up, the level, the dates in use and the source
13	for the latter information. So if you want to, and
14	counsel permits, which I concede would be a compound
15	question, if you want to, when we go through these, that
16	would be helpful, but it's up to you.
17	MR. LUNDT: That's fine.
18	THE WITNESS: I'll be glad to do that.
19	BY MR. SALES:
20	Q Yes, sir.
21	A 508, "Success through Health." This is a
22	junior high level book, and at least it was in use
23	between 1942 and 1944.
24	Q And the source for all of these books is going
25	to be the one document, Exhibit 4, correct?
0100
1	A Exhibit 4, yes.
2	Q Because you told me that's the only place that
3	you've drawn this information from.
4	A That is correct.
5	Q Right?
6	A That is correct.
7	Q All right. Go ahead. Go ahead, sir.
8	A Number 545, "Health Problems." This would be
9	a high school book used during the period 1944 through
10	1948.
11	(Pause in the proceedings.)
12	Q You're not waiting for me, are you?
13	A I am waiting, yes.
14	Q If you can just continue. If I have a
15	question about any of those, I'll stop you.
16	A Thank you.
17	550, "Your Health and Safety." The author is
18	Clemensen, and that was a high school book used during
19	the period '44 through '48.
20	The next item, number 564, "Health and
21	Physical Fitness." And that is a high school book used
22	during the same period, 1944 through 1948.
23	Q Before you do the next one, have you attempted
24	to research the issue of the academic requirements for
25	either elementary, junior high or high school students
0101
1	in the Pittsburgh school system during the relevant
2	period of time?
3	A Yes, I have.
4	Q All right. We'll get to that in a moment. Go
5	ahead.
6	A 599, "Health and Physical Fitness." And this
7	is a high school book, period 1944 through 1948.
8	602, "Your Health And Safety." That is a high
9	school book, also '44 through '48.
10	Number 671, "Personal Hygiene Applied."
11	Q Can I stop you there for a moment?
12	A Sure.
13	Q I noticed that on page 22 of the list, for
14	example, there are -- by the way, before we do that,
15	have we -- as we're going through these, I mean, I can
16	compare it when I get the Exhibit Number 3. Do these
17	generally correspond to what's on your tentative list?
18	A So far, yes.
19	Q All right. Go ahead, sorry. If you look at
20	page 22, for example, there are several textbooks that
21	we've passed over. What is the reason for that, if
22	there is a reason?
23	MR. LUNDT: Form.
24	BY MR. SALES:
25	Q 630 -- 628 through 633, for example.
0102
1	A Yes, there's a reason for that. And that is
2	that on the basis of the preliminary list that I
3	studied, these books were not in use at the level at
4	which Mrs. Talenfeld was in school at the time.
5	Q Why are they included on your reliance list?
6	A Because the reliance list includes textbooks
7	other than those used at the time when Mrs. Talenfeld
8	was a student.
9	Q For what purpose?
10	A Well, this is my -- my response would be, I
11	just looked at this list last night and I put it
12	together last night, so I was not sure which ones were
13	actually being used by her. But in any event, it's also
14	important for me to know that other books used in
15	Pennsylvania at the time carried the same type of
16	information.
17	Q All right. What's next?
18	A 671.
19	Q Go ahead.
20	A Personal Hygiene Applied, by Williams, high
21	school, 1944 through 1948. And if I may --
22	Q 671?
23	A 671. If I may make a comment, why some of
24	these appear more than once, it's because of different
25	editions. So in this case, 671 would not be the
0103
1	adequate one, because by 1950, she had already left high
2	school.
3	Q Well, that -- you anticipated by next
4	question. Can we agree that it was not likely that
5	Mrs. Talenfeld was exposed to a textbook, whether it's
6	an edition of an earlier textbook or not, that was not
7	published or released for publication until after she
8	graduated from high school?
9	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: If it was published after she
11	was in high school, not directly.
12	BY MR. SALES:
13	Q Do you intend to express any opinion in this
14	case that she might have been looking at high school
15	textbooks after she left high school?
16	A I don't anticipate doing that.
17	Q Seems unlikely, right?
18	A Correct.
19	Q All right. Are there any others after number
20	671?
21	A That's it.
22	Q Have we drawn a circle, to the best of your
23	ability today, around all of the textbooks about which
24	you may testify in this case that you know of today,
25	with all of the caveats and representations that you've
0104
1	made? I've heard them all.
2	A Yes. And as I said, and I'll just repeat it
3	for the record one more time, I need to look at the
4	final list.
5	MR. SALES: All right. I'll rely on counsel
6	to tell me that if any of the additional four weeks
7	of labor that you told me are necessary to get
8	ready to testify at trial changes any of your
9	opinions for which you've testified about, if you'd
10	let me know before, to see if the judge will allow
11	that.
12	BY MR. SALES:
13	Q What we're going to do next is talk about
14	publications and other media. Are you prepared to do
15	that now?
16	A Yes, I am.
17	Q All right. What is your understanding of the
18	publications, I'd like you to make a list -- if you want
19	to refer to anything, you're welcome to -- that
20	Mrs. Talenfeld was a reader of? With whatever frequency
21	you choose to consider.
22	A Okay. This comes out of the depositions. And
23	beginning with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the
24	Pittsburgh Press, Time Magazine, Life Magazine, the
25	Miami Herald, and there may be another one. But those
0105
1	are the ones that I'm, at this point, familiar with.
2	Q I take it that no additional research was
3	necessary, for purposes of this case, to gather articles
4	from Time Magazine. Is that correct?
5	A Additional research? No.
6	Q Because that work's been done before, right?
7	A That's correct.
8	Q The same would be true of Life, right?
9	A That's correct.
10	Q And as you explained to me earlier in the
11	deposition, the same would be true with respect to the
12	Miami Herald. Is that true?
13	A Not necessarily. I still have some Miami
14	Herald articles that I need to go back to.
15	Q Well, in terms of gathering them and placing
16	them on the reliance list, that work's already done been
17	done, right?
18	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
19	THE WITNESS: Yes, but let me clarify this.
20	Some of the ones that I'm --1 still need to go
21	back to, I may have informed Jones Day that I have
22	those, and they may have included those on the
23	list.
24	BY MR. SALES:
25	Q All right. What articles have -- may you have
0106
1	told Jones Day that you may have to go look back at and
2	that may affect your opinions in this case?
3	A I can't tell you of a particular date or
4	article.
5	Q Well, how did you communicate what you just
6	told me you communicated to Jones Day?
7	A Because gradually, as I engage in my research,
8	I provide them with --
9	Q Doctor, I'm going to stop you. The question
10	was, how did you communicate what just you told me you
11	told Jones Day?
12	A I'm trying to explain.
13	Q Well, you can explain, if you want, but I'm
14	looking for telephone, letter, e-mail, smoke signal; a
15	method of communication.
16	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
17	MR. SALES: So you can explain it all to me,
18	but go ahead.
19	THE WITNESS: Method of communication, usually
20	I provide them with my new notes on various
21	materials. So I've been looking at, say, the Miami
22	Herald for several years. I may have some new
23	dates that I'm reading, and I'm providing them with
24	those new dates. Usually, I do that two ways. I
25	provide them with the photocopies of the articles
0107
1	themselves, and I also include that information in
2	my updates as to what materials I have already
3	worked on.
4	BY MR. SALES:
5	Q Have you kept a copy of the things that you
6	have sent to Jones Day as your research has continued to
7	unfold?
8	A My practice is to do that with every document.
9	Q Have you brought those things with you today?
10	A I've --1 have brought the ones that I've been
11	advised by the lawyers that are relevant to this
12	deposition.
13	Q Well, are there communications that you've had
14	with Jones Day or any other lawyer, about this lawsuit
15	which you have not brought with you today?
16	A No, I have brought the ones that -- that have
17	happened.
18	Q Have happened?
19	A Have occurred.
20	Q Is there, outside the deposition room today,
21	any written, electronic or other form of communication
22	for which there is a record which you have not brought
23	with you today?
24	A No. And your question is about Talenfeld,
25	right?
0108
1	Q Yes.
2	A Well, the answer is the same: No.
3	Q What's the name of the search firm that you
4	used in Chicago?
5	A History Works.
6	Q Do you use History Works for any of your
7	nonexpert witness related research projects, academic
8	pursuits, books, articles?
9	A I have not done that to this point.
10	Q Why do you use them in these cases?
11	A Well, I can tell you that some of the
12	materials are not readily available, and they have
13	helped me identify where they can be found. They have
14	some of these collections, such as the Means report,
15	which I don't think is something that would be easy to
16	find in a -- in a library of any sort. That's the
17	reason.
18	Q Well, when you conduct historical research
19	about things that happened in the 1800s, isn't it
20	sometimes hard to find those things?
21	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
22	THE WITNESS: Yes, sometimes it's hard to find
23	them.
24	BY MR. SALES:
25	Q I'm talking now about the method used in this
0109
1	type of work, versus the method used in your academic
2	pursuits, and my question to you remains is: Why, in
3	expert witness work, do you use outside search firms,
4	and not use them in your academic work?
5	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
6	THE WITNESS: For one thing, it saves time.
7	For another --
8	BY MR. SALES:
9	Q Well, what --
10	A -- as I said previously, they have materials
11	that I don't --1 don't think it would be easy to find a
12	Means report in a -- even in a major library.
13	Q Well, haven't you used History Works for other
14	things in this case, other than the Means report?
15	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
16	THE WITNESS: Yes, I have.
17	BY MR. SALES:
18	Q Haven't you used History Works to gather
19	newspaper articles?
20	MR. LUNDT: Form.
21	THE WITNESS: I don't recall specifically.
22	There may have been an instance or two, yes.
23	BY MR. SALES:
24	Q Don't many of your academic works and papers
25	include reference to things such as newspaper articles?
0110
1	A Yes, that's correct.
2	Q Isn't your time valuable to you when you act
3	as an academic researcher?
4	A Yes, it's very valuable.
5	Q So my question to you is, I still don't
6	understand why the research methods involved in expert
7	witness testifying work differ from those that you
8	engage when you are engaged in your academic, nontobacco
9	related work.
10	MR. LUNDT: Form.
11	MR. SALES: What is the reason?
12	MR. LUNDT: Form.
13	THE WITNESS: Well, one reason that I can
14	explain is that I just recently found out about
15	History Works and the kinds of services that they
16	provide. The work that I'm currently involved in
17	is a work that I have full access and familiarity
18	because I've handled these documents in the past,
19	so it's something that I don't think History Works
20	would have been able to help me. That is my
21	answer.
22	Now, in the future, knowing what they can do,
23	I don't discard the possibility of recurring (sic)
24	to them if the research warrants that.
25	BY MR. SALES:
0111
1	Q What is your understanding of the services
2	that are available at History Works?
3	A The ones that I'm familiar with are --
4	Q Yes, sir.
5	A -- providing copies of documents and that --
6	that includes newspapers and the whole range of
7	documents that they have in their collection. And the
8	other thing that I'm aware of is that they can carry out
9	research, in search of materials.
10	Q So if I understand your testimony, now that
11	you see what History Works can do, you may be using them
12	to help you with your academic pursuits.
13	A I don't discard that. It is a possibility.
14	Q How were you introduced to History Works?
15	A I learned about that company through Jones Day
16	lawyers.
17	Q Who are the lawyers with whom you've had
18	communications at the Jones Day offices?
19	A Over the years, there's several. I can name a
20	few. Christine Lawson.
21	Q Let's start backwards and -- forward and move
22	backwards. That might be easiest.
23	A Start from the present. Okay.
24	Q Right.
25	A Christine Lawson, Paul Koethe, Ashlie Case,
0112
1	Jason Keehfus, and a lawyer by the name Roosevelt. That
2	was very early on. And there are others. These are the
3	names that come up to my mind right now.
4	Q Who gathered the Miami Herald materials that
5	are contained in your reliance list?
6	A Miami Herald.
7	MR. LUNDT: Form.
8	THE WITNESS: That was a process that included
9	various efforts. At one point, I asked a fellow
10	historian to provide me with the Miami Herald
11	collection that he had. I have also had a research
12	assistant look at the Miami Herald. And I have
13	actually had perhaps two more research assistants
14	that have looked at the Miami Herald, and that is
15	beyond what I received from the fellow historian.
16	BY MR. SALES:
17	Q Who is the historian who provided you with his
18	collection of Herald articles?
19	A I'm pretty sure, not a hundred percent, that
20	it was Dr. Lacy Ford.
21	Q What was the collection criteria or method
22	used by Dr. Lacy (sic) or persons at his direction, if
23	you know?
24	A Yes. My practice is that whenever I receive a
25	collection of documents, I make sure that I understand
0113
1	how it was put together. So I had a conversation with
2	Dr. Ford pertaining to that, and he explained to me
3	what -- what the methodology was. He --
4	MR. SALES: Would you read back my last
5	question, please.
6	(The question was read back.)
7	BY MR. SALES:
8	Q Just so you can see how we're doing, and not
9	to be critical, but I asked you what, if you knew, did
10	Dr. Ford do, and you told me you talked to him about it.
11	A That's correct.
12	Q Right?
13	So I want to know what he told you or what he
14	reported to you.
15	A That's precisely --
16	Q All that additional information is maybe of
17	significance to the lawyers for Jones Day, when they
18	examine you. Doubtful. May. But it's just burdening
19	the record with time that we need -- in which we need to
20	complete the deposition.
21	So if you would just tell me what your
22	understanding is of what it was that Dr. Ford did,
23	that's what I would like to know.
24	MR. LUNDT: Form.
25	THE WITNESS: Yes, he informed me that he
0114
1	developed a method which, in part, used key dates
2	for research.
3	BY MR. SALES:
4	Q Anything else?
5	A That's my recollection.
6	Q What were the key dates used by Dr. Ford, if
7	you know?
8	A I don't remember specifically, but he had --
9	he did searches and identified key dates. I'm not a
10	hundred percent sure, but he may have used some of the
11	national newspapers for that.
12	Q My question is, what are the key dates? 1906,
13	1912, June 1st, 1932, whatever.
14	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
15	MR. SALES: Do you know?
16	MR. LUNDT: Form.
17	THE WITNESS: Well, as I said, I don't
18	remember the specific dates. I can only assume
19	that these are dates when issues relating to
20	smoking and diseases were widely covered in the
21	media. So that would be, for example, the
22	unveiling of the report by the surgeon general in
23	1964. The same thing with studies about news items
24	about other studies, such as the one carried out in
25	1957 by the American Cancer Society. So that is my
0115
1	assumption, that those were dates that -- that were
2	key dates.
3	BY MR. SALES:
4	Q Other than '64 and '67, do you know what other
5	search criteria were used by Dr. Lacy?
6	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form. I believe he
7	said '57.
8	MR. SALES: Well, I misheard him.
9	BY MR. SALES:
10	Q With that modification, what are the other
11	dates, if you know?
12	A I can only assume that it was a very broad
13	range of dates, because the newspapers come from, you
14	know, every month, every year.
15	And, actually, I also have copies of indices.
16	And the impression that I get from these indices is that
17	it was not -- that it was very systematic, and I would
18	say that it means that key dates were just one
19	criteria -- one criterion used by him, because the
20	indices and the collections themselves were quite
21	extensive.
22	Q Have you brought with you Dr. Ford's indices
23	today?
24	A I don't have that with me.
25	Q Have you relied on Dr. Ford's indices in
0116
1	making assumptions, as you've told me, about the scope
2	of chronologic coverage of the Herald about to be
3	considered?
4	A Could you repeat the question, please.
5	Q Have you relied in any way, as you've
6	explained to me today, on Dr. Ford's indices in making
7	judgments about which Miami Herald articles should be
8	considered?
9	A Just partially, because I apply my own
10	methods.
11	MR. SALES: I would like copies of Dr. Ford's
12	indices. Is there any objection to that?
13	MS. LAWSON: David, I don't know if he has
14	them.
15	Do you think that you have those, still?
16	THE WITNESS: Yes.
17	MS. LAWSON: Okay. I think we can provide
18	those, then.
19	MR. SALES: All right. That will be Exhibit 5
20	to the deposition when they're provided.
21	(Exhibit 5 was marked for identification)
22	MR. SALES: Okay. So, Madam Court Reporter,
23	would you please get with Ms. Lawson and figure out
24	a way that that can be received and marked timely
25	so that it can be included as a deposition exhibit.
0117
1	THE COURT REPORTER: Yes.
2	MR. SALES: All set? Thank you.
3	BY MR. SALES:
4	Q With respect to the additional Miami Herald
5	work that you undertook through research assistants,
6	what were the criteria that you used, what was the
7	method that you used in further Miami Herald research?
8	A Yes. I instructed research assistants to look
9	through the entire run of -- well, perhaps not the
10	entire run, but extent -- extended periods of time, and
11	to look at the entire run and to make photocopies of any
12	article that touched upon a variety of subjects related
13	to smoking, to tobacco, having to do with illnesses,
14	having to do with the fact that it could be hard to
15	quit, having to do with doctors' advice. In other
16	words, I did not give them leeway to make their own
17	judgments. I instructed them to look at every page and
18	to pick every article that met the criteria of my
19	instructions.
20	Q Well, let's break that down, if we could.
21	What was the chronologic scope of that direction?
22	A It varied.
23	Q I'm talking about the Miami Herald.
24	A Miami Herald. I don't have that -- those
25	details with me. I know that I asked them to -- to look
0118
1	at, you know, over a decade, and maybe even more, just
2	to make sure that my list, my final list, would be
3	complete.
4	Q What was the date that the decade began and
5	when did the decade end?
6	A I don't have those details with me.
7	Q Was it in the 20th Century, obviously?
8	A That is correct.
9	Q Was it after the Second World War?
10	A That -- that seems to be right.
11	Q Was it before or after Ms. Talenfeld quit
12	smoking in 1979?
13	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
14	THE WITNESS: Before.
15	BY MR. SALES:
16	Q Does it extend beyond the date when
17	Mrs. Talenfeld quit smoking in 1979?
18	A Probably.
19	Q All right. Does that help refresh your
20	recollection in any way as to the geographic scope of
21	the independent research that you directed with respect
22	to Miami Herald materials?
23	A Independent research? Well, as I described,
24	the students were looking at various years and months.
25	Again, as to the specifics, I couldn't tell you what
0119
1	those could be.
2	Q What could we do to refresh your recollection,
3	to draw a circle around the geographic scope of the
4	independent work that you directed, with respect to the
5	Miami Herald?
6	MR. LUNDT: Form.
7	THE WITNESS: I don't know. I do have some --
8	I could dig up, perhaps, some information on that,
9	but I'm not sure I would be able to find it.
10	BY MR. SALES:
11	Q When was the work that you directed performed?
12	A For -- Are you referring to what,
13	specifically?
14	Q When did the research assistants, at your
15	direction, perform the work that you just described to
16	me? That's what I meant by when. When was it done?
17	A I've had -- I've had research assistants as
18	far back as the early part of the century working on
19	Puerto Rico cases.
20	Q Well, did -- did it include the Miami Herald?
21	Because that's what we're talking about. That's what's
22	on the table right now, is the Miami Herald. Okay?
23	A Miami Herald, not for the Puerto Rico cases.
24	Q All right. Well, let's stay focused, if we
25	could, please, on the Miami Herald. All right?
0120
1	A Sure.
2	Q And I'm following everything you say very
3	closely. You told me you were helped by Dr. Ford's
4	prior work. Now you've told me that you directed some
5	independent work, and you've told me that you did it
6	through research assistants. I'm trying to find out
7	more about that work. Okay?
8	A Okay.
9	Q All right. So I've asked you, for example,
10	what was the geographic scope of the independent, that
11	means not Dr. Ford, work that you directed through
12	research assistants. Okay?
13	A I understand.
14	Q And I asked you some questions to help try and
15	pin down the decade, which you thought you said -- you
16	thought you said it was, that might be in play. Has
17	anything that's happened so far that helped you refresh
18	your recollection as to what that decade is, more or
19	less?
20	A It's not just a decade. I recall research
21	done on Miami Herald during the '50s, for example, '60s,
22	'70s, at the very least. That's my recollection.
23	Q Is that distinguished from the work that
24	Dr. Ford had done, or is it part of what Dr. Ford had
25	done? Because I'm trying to find out what the
0121
1	difference between the two is. So let me ask you a
2	question again.
3	Have you directed research assistants to look
4	at the Miami Herald from the '50s and '60s, for example?
5	A That's my recollection, yes.
6	Q And the'70s?
7	A That's very likely, as well.
8	Q And the'80s?
9	A I'm not sure of that.
10	Q All right. Is the work that the research
11	assistants did at your direction collected somewhere, as
12	distinct from the records obtained which could be shown,
13	for example, in Dr. Ford's indices?
14	A Yes.
15	Q Where is that collected and kept?
16	A Well, one way that I could try to get at that
17	is by looking at the -- at the -- at --1 think I could
18	be able to decipher which photocopies were made by the
19	research students to some extent and, also, perhaps
20	note-taking by the students.
21	Now, I will --1 need to clarify this, and
22	that is that the information -- the note-taking
23	sometimes happens after the students have given me the
24	actual photocopies, and then to save time, I've had
25	research assistants, if we can call them that,
0122
1	transcribe particular segments of those articles that
2	I -- that I've chosen.
3	Q I think we're maybe at cross purposes again.
4	What I'm asking you is, do you maintain a set of the
5	Miami Herald materials that were gathered at your
6	direction as distinct from the materials which you
7	received from Dr. Ford?
8	A I'm not a hundred percent sure that -- that as
9	they've come together, I have collected them in
10	different piles, so to speak. I may have unified them.
11	Q One thing we could do, perhaps, is to see if
12	something on your reliance list is on Dr. Ford's index
13	or indices, right?
14	MR. LUNDT: Form.
15	THE WITNESS: Well, the fact that they are on
16	the index does not mean that I used it. So --
17	BY MR. SALES:
18	Q I think you misunderstood me. If I see
19	something on your reliance list from the '70s, say, that
20	appear in the Miami Herald that is not something that is
21	on one of Dr. Ford's indices, then a reasonable
22	conclusion could be drawn that that was something that
23	was independently generated at your direction, by your
24	research assistants. Is that -- would that be fair?
25	MR. LUNDT: Form.
0123
1	THE WITNESS: Not necessarily, because I
2	have --1 don't have -- I'm not sure that the
3	indices and the actual runs of the Miami Herald
4	that I received relate to each other a hundred
5	percent. So there may be cases in which something
6	that is not on the index was included in the
7	collection.
8	BY MR. SALES:
9	Q I see.
10	A And, actually, I know for a fact that there's
11	some items in the indices that may or may not be on the
12	collection.
13	Q Has your recollection been refreshed in any
14	way as to when it was that the research students,
15	research assistants, whatever we're going to call them,
16	did the work that you asked them to do?
17	A In terms of timeframe of their work? I didn't
18	understand the question.
19	Q Yes, that's exactly what I'm asking. You
20	asked whether I asked you what I just asked you. Yes,
21	that's what I asked you.
22	A Okay. I was waiting for a response.
23	And my answer to that would be that I do have
24	records of when the students did the work, or the
25	research assistants did the work.
0124
1	Q I asked you, not whether you had records, and
2	we'll get them if we need them, but whether your
3	recollection had been refreshed as to when that had been
4	done.
5	A Not without looking at the records, no.
6	Q Where are they maintained?
7	A I keep records of the invoices that the
8	research assistants produce.
9	MR. SALES: I'd like a copy of those as
10	Exhibit 6, unless there's some objection.
11	MR. LUNDT: Subject to our review of them,
12	we'll produce them.
13	MS. LAWSON: Yeah, that's fine.
14	MR. SALES: I'm not interested in their
15	identities at all. So if you want to redact that,
16	that would be fine.
17	MS. LAWSON: We'll redact their identities,
18	then.
19	(Exhibit 6 was marked for identification)
20	BY MR. SALES:
21	Q Who pays them?
22	A Jones Day.
23	Q Who picked them?
24	A I did.
25	Q What are their qualifications?
0125
1	A It varies. It has been students who are
2	individuals who -- and I think this is a case where a
3	hundred percent of them have finished at least a
4	four-year college. And people that I can trust, people
5	that can follow instructions, and people that do their
6	work in a rigorous fashion.
7	Q Without identifying any of them, have they
8	been students of yours or students of someone else?
9	A They have been -- not all of them have been
10	students of mine. Some of them -- well, the practice is
11	that they will be former students, not current students.
12	Q Let's talk about the Pittsburgh papers. There
13	are two that you mentioned, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
14	and the Pittsburgh Press. Is that correct?
15	A That's correct.
16	Q I'm going to ask you the same questions about
17	those, so just to orient you.
18	Let me back up. On the Miami Herald, would
19	you agree with me that it would have been your direction
20	for the period covered, which appears to have been the
21	'50s, '60s and '70s, to tell the students to basically
22	pull, including, among the list that you've provided,
23	any newspaper articles in the Miami Herald that have to
24	deal at all with the subject of smoking and health? At
25	least those would have been included, right?
0126
1	MR. LUNDT: Form. Form.
2	THE WITNESS: At least those. My prescription
3	was broader than that, however.
4	BY MR. SALES:
5	Q Right. But the universe of your broad
6	prescription, description, direction, should have
7	included at least all smoking and health related
8	articles. Do you agree?
9	A That's correct.

1	PROCEEDINGS
2	DIRECT EXAMINATION CONTINUED
3	BY MR. SALES:
4	Q All right. Let's talk about the Pittsburgh
5	Post-Gazette and the Pittsburgh Press. If they're
6	different for each article, you can tell me.
7	With respect to those, were you provided with
8	any extant, existing collection of those newspaper
9	articles, or have those been generated with an eye
10	toward testifying in this case?
11	A Those, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, I received
12	a collection of that.
13	Q From whom did you receive the collection?
14	A I am not a hundred percent sure, but it would
15	be the same answer I gave you before, that it would be
16	either Professor Stueck or, less likely but also
17	possible, the History Works.
18	Q Is the same true with respect to the
19	Pittsburgh Press, or is it different?
20	A Regarding the Pittsburgh Press, I have to look
21	again. I don't think I have looked at that paper yet.
22	Q Are there any Pittsburgh Press articles on
23	your last reliance list, the one I got? I haven't had a
24	chance to look through it. The one I got by e-mail
25	today.
0131
1	A Yes, there are.
2	Q Have you not read those articles?
3	A For the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette?
4	Q The Press.
5	A Oh. I have not read articles for the Press.
6	Q At whose direction were they placed on the
7	reliance list?
8	A It was a decision made by the lawyers at Jones
9	Day.
10	Q Is that one of the things that you were
11	telling me about earlier in the deposition, that are
12	included in the list of additional work that you would
13	like to do before the trial?
14	A Yes.
15	Q Who decided which Pittsburgh Press articles
16	were going to go on the list and which ones were not?
17	MR. LUNDT: Form.
18	THE WITNESS: On the reliance list, I had
19	nothing to do with that. I have my own list of
20	notes and what I find to be the most relevant
21	articles from -- from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
22	BY MR. SALES:
23	Q All right. Well, we're going to talk about
24	that. I'm focusing now on the Press, okay?
25	A Okay.
0132
1	Q So until you're released from the Press,
2	you've got to talk about the Press. Is that okay?
3	A Yes.
4	Q All right. Have you reviewed any articles
5	from the Pittsburgh Press?
6	A I don't believe I have, no.
7	Q Do you know what methods were used by whoever
8	gathered the collection included in your reliance list
9	from the Pittsburgh Press?
10	A I don't know.
11	Q Do you know what the source of the collection
12	included from the Pittsburgh Press is on your reliance
13	list?
14	A I don't know what the source is.
15	Q Do you know what the geographic scope of the
16	Pittsburgh Press articles -- excuse me, chronologic
17	scope of the Pittsburgh Press articles is that's on your
18	reliance list?
19	A I couldn't tell, off the top of my head, what
20	dates are included from the Pittsburgh Press on this
21	list.
22	Q Before we leave this general subject, are
23	there any other types or categories of information
24	included on your reliance list that I've been provided
25	which have been included by the lawyers that you have
0133
1	not yet reviewed for any reason?
2	A It's possible. I can see some examples just
3	by looking at page one. There's item 16, which is an
4	1875 Harper's Weekly article. Now, this may mean that I
5	have that on my list of Harper's Weekly articles to look
6	at, but I haven't yet looked at. And in any event, this
7	is not something that I plan to look at for the
8	Talenfeld case. So that's one example.
9	Q Without having to go through the list -- As a
10	reminder, it's over 5,000 in number of items and numbers
11	173 pages. Without going through them item by item, is
12	there any disciplined way that you can think of to
13	describe, by categories of the documents, the things
14	which have been placed there by the lawyers which you
15	have not yet reviewed?
16	A I've looked at it swiftly, and I don't see --
17	and, again, this is without having done this
18	methodically --1 don't see a category, as such, that I
19	haven't been working on which is included here.
20	Q Well, if we were to define the category, for
21	example, to include the Pittsburgh Press, we know, based
22	on the discussion we've been having, that you have not
23	looked at any of the any of the Pittsburgh Press
24	articles, right?
25	A I wasn't using the word category in that term.
0134
1	I was using, for example, category as newspapers.
2	Q Well, we're just having a -- you know, a
3	quarrel about words. It's not really a quarrel.
4	What I'm trying to find out is if there's a
5	disciplined way, among educated people on this call and
6	in that room, for you to tell me types of documents,
7	specific documents, specific publishers, specific
8	places, specific newspapers, specific -- anything that
9	you can think of, as an educated man?
10	Is there any disciplined way -- New question:
11	Is there any disciplined way, without going through all
12	173 pages, for you to tell me, generally, the types of
13	information, the categories of information, examples of
14	information, that are included on the reliance list by
15	the lawyers which you have not yet reviewed?
16	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
17	THE WITNESS: The thing that comes --
18	MR. SALES: What is the form objection?
19	MR. LUNDT: It was compound and it was
20	confusing.
21	MR. SALES: All right. Are you confused by my
22	question, Doctor?
23	THE WITNESS: I think I followed this one.
24	BY MR. SALES:
25	Q All right. Well, if there are any -- and I
0135
1	don't usually do this with Ph.D. witnesses, but maybe I
2	should have at the beginning of the deposition.
3	At any time during the deposition, if you
4	don't understand my question -- you've once or twice
5	told me you haven't -- I'm happy to try and help you.
6	Okay? But this one, you apparently understand, right?
7	A Yes.
8	Q All right. How would you answer that?
9	A If there's a way of doing it without looking
10	at the entire document, the only thing that comes to
11	mind is to do a sampling, say ten pages, from -- from
12	the entire document, and that may give you a sense. The
13	other way, which would be the fail-proof way, would be
14	to look at everything.
15	Q All right. Well, when we take our next break,
16	if the lawyers are inclined to permit you to do that, I
17	would like you to do that. And you pick as big a sample
18	as you have time for during our next break. Okay?
19	A Sounds good.
20	Q All right. Let's go back, then, to the other
21	Pittsburgh newspaper, which is the Post-Gazette. You
22	told me that some of it, you got from either Stuecks
23	(sic) or History Works, right?
24	A All of it, I got from either Stuecks or
25	History Works, yes.
0136
1	Q Do you know which of the two it was?
2	A Off the top of my head, I don't. I'm inclined
3	to say that it was Professor Stueck, but I -- it may
4	have been History Works. So I would have to inquire on
5	that.
6	Q Well, if History Works were hired to research
7	the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, would it have been you who
8	provided the direction to History Works as to what to
9	look for?
10	A No, I didn't. The only thing I may have said
11	is the dates that I needed. Their collections are
12	comprehensive, as far as I can tell.
13	Q Well, can you recall having directed anyone at
14	History Works to prepare a collection for you of
15	Pittsburgh Post-Gazette articles, using any criteria?
16	A I don't recall that, no.
17	Q When the information, the Pittsburgh
18	Post-Gazette collection came to you, did it come from
19	the lawyers, or did it come directly from Dr. Stuecks or
20	Dr. --or History Works?
21	A Either Dr. Stuecks, most likely, or History
22	Works.
23	Q When did you receive the Pittsburgh
24	Post-Gazette collection?
25	A I would say that it was definitely within the
0137
1	last year. That's as far as I can pin it down.
2	Q Do you have any other cases under review,
3	without identifying any names for the moment, that are
4	Pittsburgh specific in any way?
5	A I don't think so, no.
6	Q What were the criteria that were used by
7	either History Works or Dr. Stueck in gathering
8	Pittsburgh Post-Gazette articles?
9	A I'm not -- I'm not fully aware with that.
10	What I can tell you is that usually, when I get
11	collections like this, I have a conversation with the
12	person that provides them to me, to find out about the
13	selection process. I don't recall specifically having
14	had that conversation on this particular newspaper, the
15	Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
16	Q Do you know what the collection criteria were
17	that were used for this particular paper?
18	A I don't know that for a fact.
19	Q Do you know if it was generated as a result of
20	consideration of key dates, or if it was done, as you've
21	explained to me that you did with respect to the Miami
22	Herald, by reading every relevant publication -- excuse
23	me, every relevant article over a particular chronologic
24	time?
25	A I could only infer. I don't know that
0138
1	information.
2	Q What is the inference that you would draw in
3	that regard?
4	A Judging from the -- the quality of the
5	collection, the -- the extent of the collection, the
6	fact that so many topics even remotely related to -- to
7	smoking and health were included, I would say that there
8	may have been some more comprehensive form of putting
9	this together. But, again, it's only an inference.
10	MR. SALES: I'd like to take a restroom break.
11	And I don't know if you want to handle what we
12	talked about over the break or not. If not, we can
13	do it at a later break.
14	It's 1:14. What time would you guys like to
15	come back?
16	MR. LUNDT: We should probably grab a bite to
17	eat, I think. Want 2:00 o'clock, give everyone
18	enough time?
19	MR. SALES: Will that give you time to have
20	lunch?
21	MS. LAWSON: There's a sandwich place. I
22	don't know if we know there's a sandwich place
23	downstairs.
24	MR. LAPOINTE: Yeah, let's go ahead and do it
25	until two o'clock. We'll just have to do something
0139
1	quick.
2	MR. SALES: Well, I want the witness to be
3	fully prepared, so whatever you all think is
4	necessary. Two o'clock. And I think that we
5	better just -- I'm just going to maintain my
6	connection, and when you all are ready, start
7	talking. Okay?
8	MR. LUNDT: Okay. Thanks.
9	MR. SALES: I'm going to be here, ready to go
10	at 2:00. All right? Thank you.
11	MR. LUNDT: Thank you.
12	(The lunch recess was taken from 1:15 p.m.
13	through 2:06 p.m.)
14	BY MR. SALES:
15	Q Did you have an opportunity during the lunch
16	break to try and think of a way that we could
17	distinguish on the reliance list between those things
18	that you have not reviewed but that the lawyers put
19	there?
20	A I looked at 20 pages as a sample for that.
21	Q Where is your sample?
22	A Beginning with page 63, all the way up to page
23	83.
24	Q All right. Did you start with that date
25	because the mirrors the time at which the surgeon
0140
1	general's report was released?
2	A That's correct.
3	Q All right. What have you learned as a result
4	of your audit of those 20 pages?
5	A I've seen that --1 have looked at all of the
6	categories of materials, with the possible exception
7	of -- there's a mention of a Spanish language newspaper
8	from Miami, Voces de Las Americas, I believe, is the
9	title. Now, I do have those, but I haven't examined
10	them yet.
11	The same thing would hold true for any article
12	from the Pittsburgh Press, such as item 1878 of page 63.
13	And everything else looks to me as things that
14	I have already looked at.
15	Q Voces de Las Americas is a Spanish language
16	newspaper?
17	A Yeah. Actually, title is Diario De Las
18	Americas.
19	Q Yeah, I was more familiar with that.
20	D-i-a-r-o, D-e, L-o -- L-a-s, I guess, A-m-e-r-i-c-a-s,
21	right?
22	A Yes.
23	Q Is that an American distribution paper or a
24	Latin American distribution paper, if you know?
25	A It's a Miami based newspaper that -- that
0141
1	is --1 don't know what the extent of the circulation
2	is, but I understand that Florida readership is their
3	primary target.
4	Q Is there any indication in this case that
5	Mrs. Talenfeld was a speaker or reader of Spanish?
6	A I have no indication to that effect.
7	Q Why are Spanish language newspapers, for
8	distribution to Spanish speaking persons, on your
9	reliance list in this case, if you know?
10	A I don't know specifically why they are for
11	this case. I know that in other cases, there's
12	indication that that newspaper was available.
13	Q Is it a mistake, do you think, with respect to
14	the recently-provided list?
15	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
16	THE WITNESS: I wouldn't be able to
17	characterize it as a mistake. I did not put this
18	list -- the reliance list together.
19	BY MR. SALES:
20	Q Other than the Diario entries and the
21	Pittsburgh Press entries, were there any other items in
22	the audit that you performed that you believe that the
23	lawyers placed there that you have not read, prior to
24	today?
25	A It's possible that some of the Tampa Tribune
0142
1	articles.
2	Q Which ones?
3	A Tampa Tribune.
4	Q Do you know why those are included?
5	A Again, I could only give you my response, but
6	in terms of knowing why they were selected to be on this
7	list, I can't speak to that.
8	Q Do you anticipate reading the Diario De Las
9	Americas articles in advance of the trial in this case?
10	A Not for this case, no.
11	Q Do you anticipate reading the Tampa Tribune
12	articles in advance of the trial in this case?
13	A I don't, but I do not discard the possibility
14	of doing that.
15	Q Do you intend to, prior to testifying in this
16	case, read the Pittsburgh Press articles that were
17	included but not yet reviewed?
18	A I will do my best to get ahold of them and,
19	when I do, I will read them, yes.
20	Q Do you anticipate some difficulty in getting
21	ahold of them?
22	A Not particularly.
23	Q All right. You made it sound like there was
24	additional labor involved. Are you aware that they've
25	actually been provided by the lawyers in this case, or
0143
1	do you know?
2	MR. LUNDT: Form.
3	THE WITNESS: I don't have them.
4	BY MR. SALES:
5	Q Let me reask the question.
6	Do you know whether, as of today, the lawyers
7	who compiled the list and included them as entries have
8	actually provided them to me?
9	A I'm not aware of that.
10	Q I thought you told me that you had already
11	gotten them from either History Works or Dr. Stueck.
12	A Well -
13	Q Didn't you?
14	A I said that in answer to your question
15	pertaining to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. I understand
16	we're talking about the Pittsburgh Press now, right?
17	Q Right. So you don't know where those came
18	from at all. I think we went over that.
19	A The Pittsburgh Press?
20	Q Right.
21	A I don't know where they are, so the answer is,
22	no, I don't know where they came from. I know I don't
23	have them yet.
24	Q Let's see if we can do it this way. I think,
25	before the break, I may just have made notes to ask you,
0144
1	and I don't know if I asked you or if I need to ask you.
2	Do you know what search criteria were used in gathering
3	the Pittsburgh Press materials?
4	A I don't, because I haven't looked at them. I
5	don't have them, so I haven't --
6	Q Do you know --
7	A -- discussed that with anybody, nor am I able
8	to sort of infer how the process took place. I don't
9	have those papers.
10	Q All right. Do you know who gathered them, yes
11	or no?
12	A I don't know if they have been gathered, to be
13	honest with you.
14	Q How could it be, if they haven't been
15	gathered, that the people would know which articles to
16	include in the list?
17	A I don't know that.
18	Q So the answer to my prior question is, you
19	don't know, assuming they have been gathered, who did
20	it, right?
21	A That's correct.
22	Q Is it your understanding that Mrs. Talenfeld
23	was, in fact, a reader of the Pittsburgh Press?
24	A Based on what I read in the depositions, the
25	Pittsburgh Press is mentioned among them.
0145
1	Q What is your understanding, as a historian who
2	has reviewed the materials that have been provided to
3	you, is the date range during which Mrs. Talenfeld read
4	the Pittsburgh Press?
5	A My assumption is that she read it while she
6	was a resident in the Pittsburgh area.
7	Q Starting at what age and concluding at what
8	age or year?
9	A Well, she was bom in 1931. Of course, she
10	was not a paper reader then, but she lived in the
11	Pittsburgh area until 1958, when she moved for a year to
12	South Florida, went back to Pittsburgh, and then, to
13	my -- to South Florida in 1971.
14	Q Do you know if the Pittsburgh Press still
15	exists?
16	A I'm not aware of that.
17	Q Do you know who the owner or publisher of the
18	Pittsburgh Press was?
19	A No, I haven't --1 haven't found that out, no.
20	Q So if I asked you to assume that it's defunct,
21	would you know when it became defunct?
22	A If it's defunct, I don't know when it become
23	defunct.
24	Q Who are the witnesses or what are the other
25	sources of information, if any, that attempts to or —
0146
1	let me rephrase the question.
2	What sources of information that you have been
3	provided, whether it's deposition testimony or
4	documents, describe for you a picture which would allow
5	you to place the Pittsburgh Press in Mrs. Talenfeld's
6	hand at any point in time?
7	A I recall having read that, either in a
8	deposition or in the responses to the interrogatories.
9	Q Do you remember, with any greater precision
10	than what you've already told me today, what the
11	indicated date range for readership of the Pittsburgh
12	Press was?
13	A By Mrs. Talenfeld, I --1 don't have the
14	specific dates for that, as far as I can tell.
15	Q Who were the witnesses that talked about it?
16	A I would have to go back to the depositions
17	to -- to pinpoint who -- who said that or --
18	Q Do you have any notes -- Sorry. Go ahead.
19	A Or it may come from an interrogatory. I do
20	have notes here.
21	Q Are you looking at your notes now?
22	A Yes, I am.
23	Q If you have a note or notes that refers to the
24	date of readership of the Pittsburgh Press, I'd like to
25	know what that is, please.
0147
1	A I'm still looking.
2	I've come across mention of those Pittsburgh
3	newspapers in a deposition by Ellen Marraffino.
4	March 12, 2009, volume two.
5	Q That's a deposition in which the -- one or
6	more of the lawyers for the Defendants got to ask her
7	questions?
8	A I think that's the case for all the
9	depositions I have, yes.
10	Q And what questions, if any, can you recall
11	having been asked to attempt to ascribe a date range to
12	the readership of this particular publication?
13	A I don't recall any particular question to the
14	effect of timing of the readership.
15	Q Do you agree that from the point of view of --
16	Well, never mind.
17	Do you have any other sources of information
18	that relate to the Pittsburgh Press?
19	A Pittsburgh Press? There may be some mention
20	of that in the responses to the interrogatory.
21	Q I'll direct you, if you have them present
22	handy, it's number nine.
23	A Number nine. I have a stack here. Are you
24	referring to one deposition in particular?
25	Q Interrogatory answers.
0148
1	A Interrogatory. I'm still looking for that.
2	MR. LUNDT: David, do you have a particular
3	set? Because there were Ellen's, there was
4	Mitchell's, and then there was supplemental.
5	MR. SALES: I'll tell you in a second. It's
6	the Plaintiffs responses.
7	MR. LUNDT: Which plaintiff? Because it was
8	Mitchell at one point.
9	MR. SALES: All right. Ellen Marraffino.
10	Date of it, I'm looking at an undated copy, but
11	it's number nine. I think the answers are the same
12	on both, but I might be wrong.
13	MR. LUNDT: Okay.
14	THE WITNESS: Yes, I have that information in
15	front of me. It's on page 12.
16	BY MR. SALES:
17	Q Does that refresh your recollection as to a
18	source of information reflecting the dates and
19	readership for the Pittsburgh Press?
20	A Pittsburgh Press? It talks about subscription
21	to the Pittsburgh Press between 1960 and 1971.
22	Q Well, let's read it for the record. Are you
23	looking at interrogatory number nine, state the name and
24	dates the decedent subscribed to, purchased, received or
25	read any publication, including but not limited to
0149
1	newspapers, and so forth, right?
2	A That's correct.
3	Q All right. So if the person was answering
4	this question honestly and truthfully, it could have
5	been dates that included either subscriptions,
6	purchases, receipts or reading, right?
7	A Let me read the answer, please. One second,
8	please.
9	Q I'm asking you to focus on the question first.
10	The answer that's called for is an answer that would
11	include subscription, purchase, received or read, right?
12	A That was the question, and the answer
13	mentioned some of that, as well, yes.
14	Q All right. So the answer, as you're pointing
15	out, says that -- refers to both subscription to and may
16	have read, at various times, the following publications,
17	right?
18	A That is correct.
19	Q All right. Have you attempted, through your
20	review of the other information provided to you by
21	counsel for any of the defendants in this case, been
22	able to narrow down with any greater particularity any
23	reading range, any exposure range for any of the listed
24	publications?
25	A That may be the case. I don't recall
0150
1	specifically whether there was any greater degree of
2	specificity.
3	Q Are you going to comment upon the content of
4	any newspaper or magazine article or other content
5	included in this list of publications that is outside
6	the date range that is indicated?
7	A Okay. I'm going to go over it.
8	Yes.
9	Q All right. What are you going to do that's
10	outside the date range indicated?
11	A For example, beginning with the Pittsburgh
12	Post-Gazette and the Pittsburgh Press, I would look at
13	dates before 1960.
14	Q Are you going to express an opinion in this
15	case that from a point of view of history, that it is
16	your opinion that Mrs. Talenfeld read the newspapers or
17	articles, excuse me, newspapers or magazines identified
18	here on dates other than those indicated?
19	A That she particularly read them, no.
20	Q Do you have any --
21	MR. LUNDT: Excuse me, David.
22	MR. SALES: -- information -- Sorry, go ahead.
23	MR. LUNDT: Sorry. He wasn't finished.
24	MR. SALES: Sorry. Go ahead.
25	THE WITNESS: Specifically that she read them,
0151
1	no. But that these were materials that widely
2	circulated in the Pittsburgh area and were
3	available to the community of which Mrs. Talenfeld
4	was part.
5	BY MR. SALES:
6	Q Let's go down them one by one. Okay?
7	A Okay.
8	Q Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. We talked about that
9	some before the break, all right?
10	A Yes.
11	Q Has your recollection been refreshed, or has
12	any other information come to your attention since the
13	break which would allow you to tell me what the search
14	criteria was that was used for the collection of the
15	Pittsburgh Post-Gazette?
16	A I don't have a specific recollection of that,
17	no.
18	Q Given your role in this case and the way the
19	historians are incorporated as part of the presentation
20	of the evidence in this case, would you agree with me
21	that every article during the date range that is
22	relevant to you, which concerns itself with smoking and
23	health, should be included in your reliance list?
24	A Ideally, yes, but it's not necessary to have
25	all of them here.
0152
1	Q I want you to tell me what you think, for the
2	Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the relevant date range is in
3	this case.
4	A Well, I would look back at least the 1950s,
5	when Mrs. Talenfeld was already -- had already graduated
6	from -- from high -- from high school. That would be —
7	Q Can you be more specific? '50, '51, '52?
8	What is the year that you think is fair game in this
9	case to talk about the content of the Pittsburgh
10	Post-Gazette?
11	A Fair game, it could be earlier than that. But
12	I would plan to start, say, with 1950.
13	Q And end at what date, sir?
14	A I would end, 1971.
15	Q All right. Next, the Pittsburgh Press. Just
16	before we leave the Post-Gazette, going back to where we
17	started with this inquiry, do you have any information
18	at your disposal, other than this interrogatory answer,
19	which attempts to put a date range on the actual
20	readership of any kind, to whatever extent, by this
21	smoker of this publication?
22	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
23	THE WITNESS: I believe this is the only
24	source with dates in it.
25	BY MR. SALES:
0153
1	Q Do you recall if the lawyers hired by the
2	tobacco defendants in this case asked any questions of
3	the person who provided this information as to how they
4	came up with the 1960 date?
5	A I don't see that as a follow-up question.
6	Q All right. Based on your review of the
7	Pittsburgh Press information included in your reliance
8	list by the lawyers but not yet read by you, what is the
9	date of included articles in your reliance list?
10	Roughly.
11	A I was not paying attention to specific dates
12	as I was going through the review. Let me see if I can
13	find -- well, there's one from -- there's one from 1963.
14	There's one -- another one from 1963, another one from
15	'63. Yet another one. There's one, '63.
16	Q I haven't really asked you. You can, if you
17	want to, to go through and tell me all the ones that
18	appear on there. I asked you if you have some
19	impression, sitting today, as to the geographic, excuse
20	me, chronological scope of the Pittsburgh Press articles
21	included by the lawyers but not yet reviewed by you.
22	A I don't have --
23	Q You can look through it if you want to, but
24	really, it's a knowledge question at the moment.
25	A Yeah. Based on -- on the sample of about 20
0154
1	pages, it's '63 and '64. I assume that other dates are
2	there, but I don't know that for a fact.
3	Q You've told me already that you're going to
4	review those articles, and they may influence the
5	opinions that you have in this case. True?
6	A I do plan to review them, and as with
7	everything else, I take it into account to come to my
8	final conclusions, yes.
9	Q All right. What is the -- other than this
10	interrogatory answer that we're all looking at, what
11	other sources of information do you have that would
12	allow you to ascribe a date range for Mrs. Talenfeld's
13	potential readership of the Pittsburgh Press?
14	A Pittsburgh Press? As far as I can tell, this
15	is the only occasion where this information appears.
16	Q Can you recall the lawyers hired by any of the
17	tobacco firms in this case having asked any follow-up
18	questions about that issue?
19	A Not to my knowledge.
20	Q Is it possible in this case that you will
21	comment upon Pittsburgh Press articles that exceed the
22	date range included in this interrogatory answer?
23	A Yes, that is possible.
24	Q What is the maximum fair date range that you
25	think would be appropriate for you to comment upon,
0155
1	vis-a-vis the Pittsburgh Press, in this case?
2	A At the very least, 1950, but my intention
3	would be to look at previous articles, prel950. And, if
4	I determine that they're important, I would use them.
5	Q What would be the criteria that you would use
6	to include articles prior to 1950, now?
7	A The criteria that I would use is that at that
8	time, Mrs. Talenfeld was already around 19 years of age.
9	And, also, because, as one of the primary newspapers in
10	the region, this is the kind of information that would
11	have been available to the public in Pittsburgh. So
12	that is the -- the criterion that I use.
13	Q Do you have a feel for the circulation or
14	readership of the Pittsburgh Press at any given point in
15	time in the 20th Century?
16	A That is the kind of information that I will
17	look into, but I haven't done that yet.
18	Q Are you prepared today, focusing on the
19	Pittsburgh Press, to identify any Pittsburgh Press
20	article about which you may offer an opinion at the time
21	of the trial in this case?
22	A Yes.
23	Q All right. How many?
24	A I cannot tell you how many. A few minutes
25	ago, I was mentioning some from 1963, so those are
0156
1	examples of the ones that I would pay close attention to
2	and very likely use.
3	Q All right. What I would like to do right now
4	is, without burdening all of us by having to go through
5	the entire reliance list yet again, is for you to
6	identify, if you can at this time, those Pittsburgh
7	Press articles about which you will offer an opinion at
8	the time of trial.
9	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: Okay. I can proceed in give
11	ways. I can start from the very beginning of the
12	document, or I can go over, say, 1963, onward.
13	BY MR. SALES:
14	Q So these are all articles that you haven't
15	read yet, right?
16	A I have not read Pittsburgh Press articles, no,
17	I haven't.
18	Q And you're prepared, in good faith, to
19	identify nonetheless, for me now, those articles about
20	which you will be offering an opinion at the trial of
21	this case, right?
22	A I may offer an opinion, based on the title of
23	the article, yes.
24	Q And are you able, without actually going
25	through and picking out every one of those, through the
0157
1	reliance list, able to identify them in advance of that
2	exercise?
3	A I'm sorry, I have not read them yet. The only
4	thing I can do --
5	Q All right. Let's talk about the Pittsburgh
6	Post-Gazette. Are you able, sitting here today, to
7	identify those articles about which you will offer an
8	opinion at the time of trial? Not may, but will.
9	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: I'm not ready to do that now
11	because I -- the final --
12	MR. SALES: Sorry. Go ahead.
13	THE WITNESS: I haven't made a final
14	determination as to which ones are the most
15	reflective of the kind of information. That's
16	something that will come later in the process.
17	BY MR. SALES:
18	Q How much later?
19	A I would say, as we get closer to the trial.
20	Q Are you able, today, sitting in the deposition
21	for the trial in this case -- excuse me. Are you able
22	today to identify any Pittsburgh Post-Gazette which you
23	will offer an opinion -- article which you will offer an
24	opinion to the effect that it is likely that
25	Mrs. Talenfeld read or saw such article?
0158
1	A Particular article?
2	Q Yes.
3	A Not a particular article.
4	Q Same question, Pittsburgh Press. Are you
5	prepared today to identify any particular article about
6	which you will offer an opinion that Mrs. Talenfeld
7	likely saw or read such article?
8	A Likely saw, yes.
9	Q All right. Which ones?
10	A The ones that are -- that fall within this
11	range that appears in the response to the interrogatory
12	number nine.
13	Q All right.
14	A And others, possibly.
15	Q Well, let's go with the "what others possibly"
16	first, because my question asked the question in terms
17	of probability, which is the standard which we all have
18	to live by. So let me ask the question again.
19	At the trial of this case, do you intend to
20	offer an opinion as to any potential Pittsburgh
21	Post-Gazette article that, from the point of view of
22	history, it is more likely than not that Mrs. Talenfeld
23	likely saw a particular article?
24	A Yes, I would be willing to do that.
25	Q All right. Are you prepared today to identify
0159
1	the particular articles that you believe it is more
2	likely than not, from the point of view of history, that
3	Mrs. Talenfeld saw such articles?
4	A Yes.
5	Q All right. How many of them are there?
6	A I can't speak to a number. I can give you an
7	example, though.
8	Q Well, what I want to do is draw a circle
9	around the ones that you might talk about at the trial.
10	That's my goal. Can you do that?
11	MR. LUNDT: Form.
12	THE WITNESS: I cannot do that at this point,
13	because you are asking --1 sense your question is
14	about all the ones. I cannot answer that.
15	BY MR. SALES:
16	Q How can you tell which articles, in the
17	11-year timeframe, she did or did not, with probability,
18	read?
19	A With a very high degree of probability, some
20	of the front page coverage of major news, such as the
21	unveiling of the surgeon general's report in 1964. That
22	was a front page article, news item, I should say,
23	throughout the nation.
24	Q All right. In addition to the criterion of
25	front page coverage, what additional criteria do you
0160
1	rely on to give an opinion, from the point of view of
2	history, as to whether or not this lady read or saw a
3	particular article, within probability?
4	MR. LUNDT: Form.
5	THE WITNESS: I cannot speak to a particular
6	article.
7	BY MR. SALES:
8	Q All right. To conclude and leave this area,
9	are you prepared today to identify any particular
10	article about which you will be speaking at the trial in
11	this case?
12	A At this point, I'm not.
13	Q All right. The other one you mentioned to me
14	is Time Magazine. Same question: Other than the source
15	indicated here, the interrogatory, do you recall any
16	information from the depositions about the chronologic
17	scope of Mrs. Talenfeld's potential readership of Time?
18	A I don't recall that from the depositions.
19	It's -- the closest I can come to is on the basis of the
20	answer to the interrogatory number nine.
21	Q Are there Time articles that exceed the geo --
22	excuse me, the chronologic scope of this interrogatory
23	answer on your reliance list?
24	A I'm pretty sure there are.
25	Q Do you intend to offer an opinion in this case
0161
1	as to any particular article that Mrs. Talenfeld may or
2	may not have seen from Time Magazine?
3	A That may or --
4	Q Let me rephrase the question.
5	Do you intend to offer an opinion in this case
6	that Mrs. Talenfeld did, within probability, read or see
7	any particular Time Magazine article?
8	A Not about a particular article, but given that
9	this was a magazine that was available in the household,
10	I think it's reasonable to infer, given that she was a
11	reader, that she would have come across several of these
12	articles. But I can't speak to a specific one.
13	Q All right. What do you think is fair, in
14	terms of this case, as to the chronologic scope of the
15	Time Magazine articles about which you may offer
16	opinions, similar to what we talked about previously?
17	A I would include a broader scope than just
18	1960-'71.
19	Q How early would you go and how late would you
20	go?
21	A I would go as far as back as the '40s, and I
22	would go on until the latest ones that I have, which are
23	probably from the 19 -- 1980s.
24	Q Are you prepared today to identify any
25	particular Time Magazine article about which you may
0162
1	offer an opinion at trial?
2	A Specific article, no. But I do intend --1 do
3	intend to use Time Magazine articles.
4	Q Life Magazine, do you know which ones you're
5	going to be talking about?
6	A Specifically, no.
7	Q Life Magazine, that's another one that you
8	mentioned. In the interrogatory answer, there's a
9	reference to Inverness Avenue. Do you know why that's
10	there?
11	A Well, I can only infer what that information
12	means. That, I believe, is one of the addresses that
13	was listed for Mrs. Talenfeld. That's my recollection.
14	So I can only infer that that extra information is
15	included there for -- for placing Life Magazine in a
16	chronological context. I'm iust inferring.
17	Q Sorry.
18	Has your recollection been refreshed at all in
19	thinking about these questions as to why it is that the
20	1960 date frame may be included in many of these
21	particular answers?
22	A 1960?
23	Q Yes.
24	A I can't -- well, let's see. I can't pin that
25	down. One possibility is that -- and I don't recall the
0163
1	dates of birth, but the person providing these
2	answers -- and this is just an inference, would not
3	perhaps be able to provide testimony out of their own
4	knowledge, prior to 1960.
5	Q From your review of the testimony in this
6	case, do you recall, from the deposition earlier today,
7	your deposition, that there are living witnesses who
8	knew Mrs. Talenfeld before her children were bom. Is
9	that tme?
10	A I recall --1 recall at least one.
11	Q And who was that?
12	A Soralee Levin, Levine.
13	Q And do you recall there being any discussion
14	with Soralee about readership of periodicals?
15	A Off the top of my head, I don't. I could look
16	at my notes and see if that's there.
17	Q Can you identify, today in the deposition, any
18	Life Magazine article about which you will be offering
19	an opinion at the time of trial?
20	A I think --1 can think of at least one that I
21	intend, and that was, I believe, from 1953, pretty big
22	coverage of scientific findings linking smoking to
23	disease.
24	Q Can you find it on your reliance list without
25	too much trouble?
0164
1	A I can make an effort, looking under '53. So
2	I'm going that right now.
3	Q Sorry?
4	A I'm trying to find that right now.
5	I have found one article from Life Magazine,
6	which is number 863 from '53. And then there's another
7	one, also from 1953, actually the same issue, which is
8	the one that I was referring to particularly, "Smoke
9	Gets in the News."
10	Q Are there any others from Life about which you
11	will offer an opinion at trial that you're prepared to
12	identify today?
13	A I cannot say that with certainty, because I
14	haven't made a determination as to whether I'll be using
15	other Life Magazine articles. But this one, I'm pretty
16	sure --
17	Q Sorry. Go ahead.
18	A This one, I'm pretty sure that I will use.
19	Q Are there any Miami Herald articles about
20	which you'll be offering an opinion at trial that you're
21	prepared to identify today?
22	A There are many articles. I have not made a
23	final decision as to which specific articles I will use,
24	however. I can tell you that, for example, I would be
25	very interested in using Miami Herald articles that
0165
1	carry the news about the surgeon general's report.
2	That's -- that's almost a certainty. But other than
3	that, there's so many of them, that I have not made the
4	determination yet.
5	Q When do you plan on doing that?
6	A Again, as we get closer to the trial date.
7	Q Other than the Miami Herald newspaper reports
8	that accompanied the release of the --1 assume, the
9	1964 surgeon general's report?
10	A That is correct.
11	Q Other than the newspaper articles that
12	accompanied that, are you prepared today to offer,
13	excuse me, to identify any Miami Herald articles about
14	which you may offer an opinion in this case?
15	A I can't pin them down. And I just realized
16	that --1 just realized one thing, and I want to be
17	perfectly clear and honest, as I've been throughout.
18	The '64 report is, of course, prior to 1971.
19	I may still use it, but I would rather, and most likely
20	use a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article on that subject.
21	So I wanted to clarify that.
22	Q All right. So I will delete from the Miami
23	Herald list what you mentioned, with all of those
24	caveats.
25	Over and above that, over and above that
0166
1	comment, there any Miami Herald articles that you can
2	identify today about which you'll be offering an opinion
3	at trial?
4	A I can't give you specific. The best I can do
5	is some themes, for example, having to do with local
6	ordinances that are passed. It's very likely that I
7	will use some of that. But in terms of your question on
8	specific articles, I can't do that now.
9	Q Are there any other publications, magazines,
10	newspapers, other than those included in the discovery
11	that you've reviewed in this case, about which you will
12	be commenting?
13	A Other than the ones that I have already
14	reviewed? Is that your question?
15	Q No. Let's take the trial that you just were
16	involved in. What's the name of the smoker again?
17	A Ms. Talenfeld.
18	Q No, the one you testified in in Fort
19	Lauderdale just a few weeks ago, or last week, I think
20	you said.
21	A Matthew Buonomo.
22	Q Right. Where did Mr. -- was it a Mr. or
23	Mrs. who was the smoker?
24	A Mr.
25	Q Where did Mr. Buonomo live?
0167
1	A He was bom and lived in -- lived in New
2	Jersey, till, if I recall correctly, around 1959, and at
3	that point, he moved to South Florida.
4	Q Now, when you testified in Fort Lauderdale
5	just recently, did your testimony have with it a
6	PowerPoint presentation that was shown to the jury?
7	A That's correct.
8	Q During the PowerPoint presentation, did you,
9	through examination of counsel for one of the tobacco
10	defendants, show pictures of news articles?
11	A Yes.
12	Q Did you show pictures of magazines, perhaps
13	national magazines?
14	A Yes.
15	Q Do you recall the magazines or the newspapers
16	that were used in conjunction with your testimony in
17	that case?
18	A I do recall --
19	Q The names of them, like Reader's Digest?
20	A Yes.
21	Q All right.
22	A There was Time, Life, Newsweek, several
23	newspapers, including the New York Times, the Bergen
24	Evening Record from New Jersey, the Star Ledger, and
25	also, several Florida newspapers, among them, the Miami
0168
1	Herald, the Fort Lauderdale Sun, and, if I recall
2	correctly, I'm pretty sure, the Hollywood Tattler.
3	There may be others.
4	Q I mentioned Reader's Digest. Did you use
5	that, as well?
6	A Yes, I did.
7	Q Are you able to remember any of the specific
8	publications or articles that were used in conjunction
9	with your testimony in that case?
10	A Yes, some.
11	Q All right. Would you list them, please.
12	A I remember an article in Reader's Digest,
13	"Cancer by the Carton"; I remember the Life Magazine
14	story that we just talked about a few minutes ago from
15	1953. I remember front page coverage of the surgeon
16	general's report from several newspapers, including the
17	Fort Lauderdale Sun. I recall a couple of New York
18	Times articles from, I believe, 1946. I recall, let's
19	see -- off the top of my head, those are the ones that I
20	can say that, with certainty, that I used.
21	Q Do you know, in the deposition today in the
22	Talenfeld case, whether you'll be offering opinions on
23	any of those same materials that you've just identified?
24	A It is possible.
25	Q Which ones?
0169
1	A Well, I think it's possible for all of them,
2	most likely, of course, the Miami Herald, Life, Time.
3	Those, very specifically. But other ones from the South
4	Florida region, those may very well be included.
5	Q To leave this area, are you able to identify,
6	in any greater detail, the specific items that you'll be
7	offering opinions about in the trial of the Talenfeld
8	case, other than what you've shared with me today?
9	A Other items that I will be using? I suppose,
10	if we could call them items along the same lines, the
11	information from the depositions, the surgeon general's
12	report itself. Those are two that come to mind.
13	Q Anything else in the nature of publications,
14	articles, newspapers that you can think of that you will
15	be offering opinions about in the trial of this case,
16	the Talenfeld case, that you have not already
17	identified?
18	A Yes. Clips from news programs. I also intend
19	to use some government pamphlets. And, again, all of
20	this is an intention that may change within the next
21	weeks or months. But based on the kinds of
22	presentations that I've made, I'm very likely to use
23	these general categories of items.
24	Q Which clips are you talking about?
25	A Well, some clips from the evening news, such
0170
1	as Walter Cronkite, news programs.
2	Q I don't want to interrupt you, but I
3	understood that's what you meant in terms of category of
4	information. I'm asking you to identify, if you're able
5	and willing at this time, any specific clips, news clips
6	about which you'll offer an opinion in the Talenfeld
7	case.
8	A Specific, other than the fact that I may very
9	likely use clips from the day and the following days
10	after the surgeon general's report was released, as well
11	as coverage in these clips of issues, such as warning
12	labels. Now, as to a particular date and station, I
13	haven't made that determination yet.
14	Q Which pamphlets are you talking about? Can
15	you identify the pamphlets about which you'll be
16	offering an opinion in the trial in this case?
17	A I have not made a determination. I recognize
18	them as important sources, and I anticipate using one or
19	two examples of that.
20	Q Do you remember the author or the agencies of
21	any of the clips that you'll be using? Which government
22	agency?
23	A You asked for clips or pamphlets?
24	Q No, pamphlets. Excuse me. Can you tell me
25	the name of the government agency who is responsible for
0171
1	the authorship or distribution of any of the pamphlets
2	that you're talking about so I can try, to the best of
3	my ability, to figure it out from your reliance list?
4	A Okay. I haven't made the final decision, but
5	I can give you an example of something that I'm likely
6	to use. Say a pamphlet from the Department of Health,
7	Education and Welfare.
8	Q Can you limit it any further by year or decade
9	or century?
10	A They would be 20th Century. Most likely,
11	second half of the 20th Century.
12	Q Can you limit it any further, so when I look
13	through the reliance list, I can try and find it easily?
14	A I don't want to limit it, but my sense is that
15	there were publications by the government, such as
16	pamphlets, that preceded the surgeon general's report in
17	1964, so I would not want to limit post-'64. Other than
18	that, I can't give you a more specific window; other
19	than saying that I would be particularly interested in
20	the kinds of pamphlets that were available during the
21	1950s.
22	Q Well, in order to conduct a thorough
23	examination, so you understand what I'm doing, one of
24	the things I would like to know is, who the agency is,
25	what the intended distribution of it was, where the
0172
1	thing went, and at least be in a position to make
2	inquiry of that, if you don't know the answers to that.
3	So it's very difficult, most respectfully, in a vacuum,
4	to talk about the things the way that we're talking
5	about them.
6	So if you're going to talk about a document at
7	trial, I would like to know what the document's going to
8	be so that I can conduct an inquiry, if you don't know
9	the answers, about its provenance. And I know those are
10	all terms that have meaning to you.
11	So I'm going to ask you again, can you
12	identify any government pamphlet in this case about
13	which you will offer an opinion at trial?
14	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
15	THE WITNESS: I'm trying to give you as much
16	information as I -- as I have. And at this point,
17	as I said before, I haven't made any final
18	decision. What I'm trying to do is give you a
19	sense of the types of materials and, in a way, also
20	give you a flexible timeframe. I cannot do the
21	other -- what else you're requiring, specifics. I
22	can't do that.
23	BY MR. SALES:
24	Q Well, I think you do understand, most
25	respectfully, that this is an examination that's for
0173
1	purposes of discovery in a trial. No one can reasonably
2	be expected to have an opportunity to conduct an
3	examination of someone in a day, which is all we're
4	usually allowed, about 6,000 items. I think that was
5	proven amply today. And the only way I know how to do
6	this, after having done it for over 20 years, is to try
7	and find out what the person's going to say, try and
8	find out what they're actually going to rely on or use
9	at trial, so that I can conduct reasonable inquiry to
10	test the accuracy of what they say and what they do.
11	And experience in this case teaches, and in others, that
12	sometimes things don't turn out the way that they're
13	supposed to.
14	So what I want to know from you, before you
15	take the witness stand, when I won't have an opportunity
16	then to conduct a good faith inquiry into the accuracy
17	of your representations and testimony, is to know what
18	it is you're going to be talking about. I don't know
19	how else to do it, except to ask you what you're going
20	to be talking about.
21	So to leave this area, I'll ask you one more
22	time. New question: Are you prepared to identify today
23	any government pamphlet about which you'll offer an
24	opinion in this case?
25	MR. LUNDT: Form.
0174
1	THE WITNESS: Not a specific one.
2	MR. SALES: All right.
3	THE WITNESS: What I can tell you is that I
4	have a collection of them, I'm familiar with them,
5	and at the proper time, I'll make a decision as to
6	which ones I will select for the courtroom
7	presentation.
8	BY MR. SALES:
9	Q All right. In addition to clips and
10	pamphlets, is there any other source material about
11	which you may offer an opinion at the trial of this case
12	that you can think of today?
13	A Yes.
14	Q All right. What else?
15	A Items such as posters created by organizations
16	such as the American Cancer Society, numerous pamphlets
17	by those organizations. I also plan -- well, actually,
18	I've looked at some secondary literature, such as
19	articles that speak to the topic of health and smoking.
20	I have --1 also intend to look at clips from movies,
21	the same thing with popular culture. Things such as
22	slang pertaining to cigarettes and smoking, music. I
23	also plan to look at school materials.
24	I may be leaving out some of the categories,
25	but in general, those are the kinds of materials that
0175
1	I've used in the past.
2	Q All right. Well, then, you've -- you can
3	understand my objective. Although it was difficult, I
4	think we have done the best we can today in trying to
5	identify all of the school materials about which you may
6	offer an opinion, correct?
7	A No, that's not correct.
8	Q All right. I believe we've done a good job
9	today identifying all of the textbooks about which you
10	may testify, subject to your comparing an old list
11	versus a new list. Right?
12	A That's not correct.
13	Q All right. We haven't exhausted the list of
14	textbooks about which you may testify?
15	A That is correct.
16	Q All right. What are the other ones you
17	haven't told me about yet?
18	A Well, I will look at other textbooks, and I
19	would also be interested in textbooks being used at the
20	time when the children of Mrs. Talenfeld were in school.
21	Q What other textbooks are you going to look at
22	that you have not yet looked at?
23	MR. LUNDT: Form.
24	THE WITNESS: I do have a long list of
25	textbooks. I have looked at most of them already.
0176
1	Some of them, I have to revisit, and some of them,
2	I will have to actually try to get ahold of some of
3	them, which I, to this point, don't have in my
4	possession.
5	BY MR. SALES:
6	Q Are they on your reliance list?
7	A On the reliance list? I don't --1 haven't
8	checked both lists against each other. There are
9	several that are included here in the reliance list. I
10	suspect that there are others that I have looked at that
11	may not be here, and some which I have not looked at
12	yet, but I intend to look at, may be missing --
13	Q I'm only interested in the Talenfeld case for
14	today, most respectfully. So what I would like you to
15	do is to identify any other textbook about which you may
16	offer an opinion at the trial of this case that you have
17	not yet mentioned.
18	A Well, my answer --
19	Q I thought we had accomplished that, to the
20	best of our ability. But go ahead.
21	A I understand that we're talking about the
22	Talenfeld case, and my response was pertaining to that
23	particular case, yes.
24	Q Okay. So give me the names of the other books
25	you're going to use.
0177
1	A At this point, I don't --1 cannot give you a
2	comprehensive list of the books that I intend to use or
3	find or identify.
4	Q Give me -- give me an incompetent list, then.
5	MR. LUNDT: Form.
6	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. What was the word
7	you used?
8	BY MR. SALES:
9	Q Give me an incompetent, meaning incomplete,
10	list, then.
11	MR. LUNDT: Form.
12	MR. SALES: I'll take whatever I can get.
13	THE WITNESS: With all due respect, I don't
14	think incompetent and incomprehensive are the same
15	thing, so I would like to -- you to clarify your
16	question.
17	BY MR. SALES:
18	Q I was using the term technically, meaning not
19	capable of succeeding, but I'm trying to do the best
20	that I can.
21	Give me as incomplete a list or as complete a
22	list, whatever you will give me in this deposition,
23	about textbooks, I will take. So please continue to add
24	to the list of textbooks that you've already identified,
25	in any way that is convenient for you, under the
0178
1	circumstances.
2	MR. LUNDT: Objection, objection to form.
3	THE WITNESS: Thank you for clarifying the
4	wording.
5	I have a few in front of me. I can go down
6	that list.
7	BY MR. SALES:
8	Q All right. Where is that -- where are they
9	contained?
10	A They are part of the exhibit that contains my
11	notes.
12	MR. LUNDT: Are we talking about this
13	document? We've already marked that.
14	THE WITNESS: Yeah, it's Exhibit 3.
15	MR. LUNDT: The court reporter would like a
16	five-minute break.
17	(A recess was taken.)
18	BY MR. SALES:
19	Q Are you prepared to identify, today, any
20	additional textbooks about which you may express an
21	opinion that you have not yet identified today?
22	A Not -- I'm not ready to do that in specific
23	terms of titles. I'm not.
24	Q Are you prepared to identify any posters about
25	which you may express an opinion?
0179
1	A Well, I'm sorry. I want to take back what I
2	just said. I do have in front of me a list of a few of
3	them.
4	Q Where did you get that list?
5	A This was a list that I created, and we went
6	over that list earlier today.
7	Q I thought we had covered that. That's
8	number -- Exhibit 3?
9	MR. LUNDT: Right. Yes.
10	THE WITNESS: Yes.
11	BY MR. SALES:
12	Q All right. And I thought you told me that
13	after we had gone through the reliance list, it appeared
14	that there was concordance between the reliance list
15	items that were discretely identified and those that are
16	contained in Exhibit 3. Is that wrong?
17	A I can't recall whether all of them were there,
18	no.
19	Q All right. Well, let's do it this way.
20	Leaving aside Exhibit 3, leaving aside the discrete
21	items that Ms. Lawson pointed out to you during the
22	break and which you read into the record, are there any
23	other textbooks about which you may express an opinion
24	that you have -- that you can tell me about today?
25	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
0180
1	THE WITNESS: There are others. I cannot give
2	you the specific titles, authors or dates.
3	BY MR. SALES:
4	Q Are there any posters about which you're going
5	to express an opinion that you're prepared to identify
6	today?
7	A I can speak broadly to the category of
8	posters. I have a collection of those, but specifically
9	which one I will be using in court, no. I can tell you
10	that when I -- when I'll give my testimony, it will be
11	based on my knowledge of this body of posters, but not a
12	specific one, I can't tell you that now.
13	Q Who is the producer or creator of the posters
14	about which you have opinions?
15	A There's a range of organizations, such as the
16	American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association,
17	the heart, American Heart Association. Those are three
18	examples that come to mind. I believe the Centers for
19	Disease Control has also produced posters, and there are
20	other sources of those posters, as well.
21	Q What is the date range for the posters about
22	which you may have an opinion in this case?
23	A Generally speaking, I have looked at posters
24	dating back to the 1800s, which I do not discard using
25	as an example. But I would say that it would be posters
0181
1	from '50s and '60s, '70s, perhaps '80s.
2	Q Given what you know about the facts of the
3	Talenfeld case, does that focus you at all and help you
4	identify any particular poster about which you have an
5	opinion that you'll be expressing in this case?
6	A Particular poster? Well, I'll be expressing
7	opinions based on the range of posters, but if you're
8	referring to testimony on one poster in particular, I
9	have not made that decision yet.
10	Q Well, what I'm trying to do, so that you
11	understand, again, is counsel's provided me with copies
12	of the actual materials, and I assume that they're in
13	your reliance list, right?
14	A I don't know whether all of them are there.
15	If I recall correctly, I came across some of them. But
16	I don't know whether all of them are here on this
17	reliance list.
18	Q Well, who would know that?
19	MR. LUNDT: Form.
20	THE WITNESS: Who would know that?
21	BY MR. SALES:
22	Q You keep asking questions when I ask
23	questions. Yes, who would know if the posters that you
24	may or may not use are on your reliance list? Who would
25	know?
0182
1	A I would be able to do that, if I had the time
2	to cross check the posters that I have against the
3	reliance list. So the answer is, I could do that.
4	Q All right. Well, without -- you told me they
5	go back to the 19th Century. The reliance list goes
6	back, as I recall, to the time of Columbus. I'm not
7	going to take the time to do that today. To focus you
8	again and explain to you, if there was a particular
9	poster that you may be using, it may be on your reliance
10	list, and it may be something that I've been given by
11	the lawyers that hired you, and I may be able to look at
12	it ask you questions.
13	So I will ask you again: Are you prepared
14	today to identify any posters about which you will be
15	testifying at trial?
16	A I anticipate using posters, most likely from
17	health organizations. Today, I cannot tell you which
18	particular posters I intend to use.
19	Q All right. You also mentioned a different
20	kind of pamphlet. Is there some other pamphlet, other
21	than pamphlets produced by government agencies, that
22	you've been using?
23	A That is correct.
24	Q Who are the authors of these pamphlets?
25	A Some of them are from the American Cancer
0183
1	Society. Others are from other antismoking
2	organizations. Some of them, if I recall correctly, are
3	produced by churches. So there's a range of sources for
4	these types of pamphlet publications.
5	Q Are you prepared to identify any of them today
6	about which you may be expressing an opinion at trial?
7	A Other than, they would fall into the
8	categories that I just described, again, my answer is,
9	at this point, I have not made a final decision as to
10	which particular items, posters or otherwise, I will be
11	using in court.
12	Q Well, we're on pamphlets now. We did posters.
13	And I'm going to ask you the same questions about each
14	of the categories so I make my record.
15	Are you prepared today to identify any
16	pamphlet about which you may be testifying so that I can
17	examine you on it?
18	A Particular pamphlet, I'm not ready.
19	Q Yes.
20	A No.
21	Q Are you prepared to identify today any movie
22	clip about which you may be testifying?
23	A I --1 know I have a set of those from various
24	films. Which ones I'll be using, I don't know. I know
25	that there's some with Mickey Rooney, there's some with
0184
1	the Three Stooges. There's a set of them, but I have
2	not made that determination yet.
3	Q You mean like a montage of various different
4	clips, all in one place?
5	MR. LUNDT: Form.
6	THE WITNESS: I'm not sure whether the right
7	term is a montage, but there's a succession of
8	short clips that I've used, and most likely --
9	BY MR. SALES:
10	Q Did you use -- did you use that in the last
11	Fort Lauderdale trial?
12	A Yes, I did.
13	Q Do you anticipate doing any other editing of
14	that or reworking of that for purposes of the trial in
15	the Talenfeld case?
16	A I don't discard that.
17	Q You mentioned other items of popular culture.
18	What were you referring to?
19	A Referring to songs, for example, T.V.
20	programs, slang, that type of material.
21	Q Are you prepared to identify select items that
22	would fit that -- those categories on your reliance list
23	about which you'll be expressing an opinion at the time
24	of trial?
25	A I anticipate, with a hundred percent
0185
1	certainty, to use at least one song entitled, "Smoke!
2	Smoke! Smoke!"
3	Q All right. I'm familiar with that one, so I
4	don't have to ask you any questions about that.
5	Any other songs?
6	A I may be using other songs. Again, it's a
7	possibility. There's a song by the rock and roll group
8	The Who, which speaks of the subject. I may or may not
9	use that.
10	Q What is The Who song?
11	A "Little Billy."
12	Q What is the lyric, or what are the lyrics of
13	significance to you?
14	A Well, the lyrics are significant because it
15	is, in essence, an anti --
16	Q I don't want to interrupt you, but I asked
17	you, what is the lyric or what are the lyrics that are
18	significant to you, not why are they significant. Can
19	you tell me?
20	A I don't know --1 don't remember the lyrics by
21	heart. I was trying to explain what essence of the song
22	was.
23	Q All right. What is the essence of the song
24	that was of significance to you?
25	A It's an antismoking message. It has to do
0186
1	with smokers dying, for example. That is the message of
2	the song.
3	Q Are you a Who fan?
4	A I like that band, yes.
5	Q Can you remember, with any greater
6	particularity, the lyrics or the lyric that was of
7	significance that connotes the message that you've
8	described?
9	MR. LUNDT: Form.
10	THE WITNESS: Not the specific lyrics, no.
11	BY MR. SALES:
12	Q Any other songs that you may be using that
13	you're prepared to identify today?
14	A Not that I'm prepared to identify today, no.
15	Q Can you think of other categories of
16	information that may be audio or visually -- audioly
17	(sic) or visually presented to the jury that you'll be
18	relying on, other than what we've talked about?
19	A Yes. Cartoons, for example, and -- basically,
20	cartoons. I mentioned, earlier, something along the
21	lines of slang.
22	Q Yes, sir.
23	A Yes. I --1 try to give you an example of the
24	categories.
25	Q Well, I'm trying to create a list and exhaust
0187
1	the list. Let me know when you're done. You don't have
2	to repeat anything that you've told me already.
3	A I can't tell you for sure all the categories
4	that I'm going to use. I'm trying my best to give you a
5	sense of the kinds of materials that I have used in
6	other cases. I have used comic books, for example. I
7	have used public service announcements. I wouldn't want
8	to close the list there, but that's what comes to mind
9	at this point.
10	Q I'm familiar with the Goofy cartoon. Is that
11	one of the ones you're referring to?
12	A Goofy cartoon? I'm familiar with that one. I
13	don't recall having used that one in the past, but it is
14	a possibility that I will use it.
15	Q All right. Are you prepared to identify any
16	cartoons about which you may express an opinion, other
17	than the Goofy cartoon? Because that's the one I can
18	think of.
19	A Not specifically. I mean, but there's --
20	there's a possibility that I may want to use one that
21	was published in 1964.
22	Q What is it?
23	A The title escapes me. It's an entire comic
24	book.
25	Q All right. Before we leave cartoons, are you
0188
1	prepared to identify -- and I understand that there's a
2	historic relationship between a moving picture cartoon
3	and a comic book, but I think we know the difference,
4	right?
5	A That's correct.
6	Q All right. So before we go to comic books
7	that are published, let's talk about cartoons that are
8	shown on T.V. or movie theaters, okay?
9	A Cartoons on movie theaters.
10	Q Are there any other cartoons, regardless of
11	the venue where it may have played, about which you're
12	going to express an opinion that you can identify now?
13	A I can only think of that --1 think it was
14	Donald Duck, actually. I'm familiar with that one. I
15	don't know whether I'm going to use it or not.
16	Q Is the Donald Duck cartoon on your reliance
17	list?
18	A I don't know that for a fact. And I'm not a
19	hundred percent sure that it was Donald Duck. That's my
20	recollection.
21	Q All right. Well, it's difficult to identify
22	it and try and look at it without knowing whether it's
23	on the reliance list. I don't mean to be funny, but do
24	you know who Goofy is?
25	A Yes. Actually, we're neighbors.
0189
1	Q The actual Goofy?
2	A I live close to Disney World. Disneyland,
3	whatever it is.
4	Q Oh, I'm sorry.
5	I was going to say, if you live in the Orlando
6	area, we should be able to distinguish among our Disney
7	characters, right?
8	A That's correct.
9	Q All right. So the character that you can
10	recall in the cartoon is Donald Duck, right?
11	A That's what comes to mind.
12	Q Are there any other cartoons that you can
13	identify that you may offer an opinion on that you have
14	not yet mentioned?
15	A No, no other one comes to mind.
16	Q What is the comic book that you were referring
17	to?
18	A There are several comic books. There's one in
19	particular from 1964, that was put together by the
20	American Cancer Society. Smoking is for Squares, I want
21	to think that that's the title. Or maybe not, but it
22	was fully devoted to an antismoking message, and I know
23	for a fact that it was very widely distributed, into the
24	millions.
25	Besides that one, there are regular -- I'm
0190
1	sorry, we're talking about comic books now, right?
2	Q Right.
3	A There were several of the regular comic books
4	that included a whole page, which was actually the back
5	part of the front cover, with a full page antismoking
6	message in cartoon form, in comic book form.
7	Q Are those on your reliance list?
8	A I would have to check.
9	Q Do you know the approximate date range that we
10	would look for those so I can try and find them?
11	A Yes, 1964, 1965.
12	Q Were they in conjunction with this other comic
13	book that was something you just mentioned? Or is it
14	separate from that?
15	A I --1 tend to relate them. If I recall
16	correctly, it was also part of the American Cancer
17	Society campaign. So in that sense, I do make that
18	connection, but in -- in one case, it's a full comic
19	book. In the other case, or in the other cases, I
20	should say, it's just the back part -- page of the front
21	cover.
22	Q Do you know, from the point of view of
23	history, what the circumstances were which led to the
24	inclusion of antismoking messages on comic books?
25	A I have a pretty good sense of why that was,
0191
1	yes.
2	Q Is it something that you've inferred or
3	something that you know as a result of study?
4	A I know that as a result of study.
5	Q All right. What have you learned about that?
6	A I learned that as a result of the surgeon
7	general's report of 1964, many, many public, private,
8	volunteer organizations were mobilized in the effort to
9	educate the public about the health circumstance -- the
10	health issues related to smoking, and the American
11	Cancer Society would have been in the forefront of that.
12	So it is based on my knowledge of the whole range of new
13	programs and projects that they embarked on,
14	specifically in 1964, that this was part of that
15	offensive, if you will.
16	Q Are you prepared to identify any of the
17	specific inset inside covers, back page covers of comic
18	books that are included in the category of documents
19	about which we are speaking and about which you may
20	offer an opinion at the trial in this case?
21	MR. LUNDT: Form.
22	THE WITNESS: I would have to look for it, if
23	you allow me that.
24	BY MR. SALES:
25	Q Well, let's go ahead and take a -- see if you
0192
1	can find one.
2	A Okay.
3	Q '64 to '65?
4	A Oh, you're asking me to look specifically in
5	the reliance list?
6	Q Yes. I'm not familiar with those, so I'd like
7	to look and see if I can see one so I may ask you
8	questions about it, if you can find one for me. I'm not
9	familiar with those.
10	A Okay. As you know, '64 is a -- is a peak
11	year, so it may take me a while to look through this.
12	(Referring to documents.)
13	I found the first one, and it is number 1994.
14	This is from October 1964, and it's a Superman comic
15	book.
16	Q All right. Is that an example of the kind of
17	thing that you may be showing to the iury?
18	A Possibly.
19	Q I'm not able to pull that up for some reason,
20	but let me try again. Hold on.
21	To save time, do you have in mind the contents
22	of the document and why it is significant to you?
23	A The content of the document, the one that I
24	just found on the list, it is a one-page cartoon,
25	produced, if not fully, at least in association with the
0193
1	American Cancer Society, with a message that smokers are
2	losers.
3	Q Do you know if -- do you know why this
4	campaign apparently only lasted until 1965?
5	MR. LUNDT: Form.
6	THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of the fact that
7	it lasted only until 1965, and I wouldn't be able
8	to say why it lasted, if that's the case, until
9	1965. I know that other efforts by the American
10	Cancer Society to reach younger audiences, as well
11	as the public in general, continued.
12	BY MR. SALES:
13	Q In comic books?
14	A I --1 can't speak to comic books. My -- my
15	knowledge is that antismoking messages appeared in comic
16	books before that, and these were just part of the --
17	what the writers of the comic books decided to include.
18
19	Q I see. You mentioned, again, pamphlets. Are
20	the pamphlets that you mentioned most recently different
21	or the same as the pamphlets which we have spoken about
22	previously today?
23	A Pamphlets, I may have mentioned the fact that
24	some of them were produced by organizations such as the
25	American Cancer Society. Of course, they're different.
0194
1	As time goes on, they tackle different topics. One
2	example of this would be pamphlets specifically speaking
3	to the potential problems associated with a pregnant
4	woman smoking. So they -- they -- they do change over
5	time.
6	Q I'm still on the identification mode. Let's
7	just talk about pamphlets. You talked about pamphlets
8	from government agencies, you've talked about pamphlets
9	from public health agencies, such as -- excuse me. We
10	talked about pamphlets from government agencies, and
11	you've talked about pamphlets produced by such agencies
12	as American Health, American Lung center, and so forth.
13	What I'm trying to find out is, since you
14	mentioned pamphlets again, is if there's some other
15	source of pamphlets about which I need to be aware,
16	other than those two types so far, government and
17	agencies like American Health and American Lung.
18	A I believe I mentioned earlier, churches.
19	Q Yes, sir.
20	A And there may be pamphlets by -- and this, I
21	don't know with a hundred percent of certainty, but some
22	of the organizations that were in -- were antismoking
23	organizations that were not the three that I mentioned
24	before, which are not, in essence, antismoking. They
25	deal with the heart, the lungs.
0195
1	Q Do you remember which church groups are
2	authors or distributors of pamphlets about which you may
3	offer an opinion at trial?
4	A I've seen pamphlets from the Methodist church,
5	various booklets, perhaps from the Baptist church. I --
6	I'm just trying to give you an answer, but I'm not
7	really a hundred percent sure about the Baptists. So I
8	would say there were several denominations that produced
9	and distributed these kinds of pamphlets.
10	Q Are you going to be offering any opinions
11	about any particular Baptist pamphlet or Methodist
12	pamphlet at the trial of this case?
13	A I don't intend to do that.
14	Q You said there were other antismoking groups
15	or agencies. Please don't repeat any of the ones you
16	may have mentioned. Are there any others that you can
17	think of?
18	A The one that comes to mind is ASH. Again, I'm
19	not sure I have a pamphlet from ASH. But the best of my
20	recollection is that I have seen pamphlets put out by
21	antismoking organizations.
22	Q What does ASH stand for?
23	A American --1 don't recall what it stands for.
24	Q There are any ASH pamphlets on your reliance
25	list?
0196
1	A I don't recall that.
2	Q Are there any Baptist pamphlets on your
3	reliance list?
4	A Pamphlets, as such, I don't remember seeing,
5	no.
6	Q Are there any Methodist pamphlets on your
7	reliance list?
8	A There may be. I don't recall having seen
9	them.
10	Q Do you know from which decades any of those
11	pamphlets would have appeared, Methodist, Baptist or
12	ASH?
13	A The dates that I'm most familiar with those
14	kinds of publications, actually, there's some that are
15	very early in the -- produced very early in the
16	20th Century. But for the most part, these kinds of
17	materials date from the '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s.
18	Q For the record, 1950 begins on page 23 of the
19	reliance list, and 1980s ends on page 163 of the
20	reliance list.
21	All right. Have you thought of any other
22	categories of documents which you may show to the jury
23	and express an opinion about at the time of trial that
24	we have not yet touched on?
25	A I'm trying to think. Well, there may very
0197
1	well be -- well, I mentioned some before. There may be
2	book-length publications that I haven't mentioned
3	before. I don't want --
4	Q Who are the authors of the book-length
5	publications?
6	A I'm sorry?
7	Q Who are the authors, or who is the author, of
8	the book-length publication?
9	A There's a range of authors. I don't recall
10	specifically the names now. I --1 haven't used that in
11	terms of testimony, but I am familiar with many of those
12	books and articles.
13	Q Are you prepared to -- are you prepared to
14	offer -- to identify, excuse me, any book-length work
15	about which you may express an opinion at the time of
16	trial?
17	A I have not made that determination, so I'm not
18	ready.
19	Q How many hours have you spent working on this
20	case, the Talenfeld case?
21	A On this case, not counting today, I looked at
22	the numbers yesterday, and it was around seven -- around
23	62, 65. But I must make a clarification. Those are
24	hours specifically to the Talenfeld case. There are
25	many other hours that I've spent on materials, such as
0198
1	the Miami Herald, that are pertinent to this case. So
2	what I can give you is the particular hours for this
3	case specifically, which is roughly around 62 hours.
4	Q Have you submitted any invoices for the time
5	you've spent so far?
6	A Yes, I have.
7	Q Who is the party, or what is the party to whom
8	you submit your invoices?
9	A Jones Day.
10	Q Have you brought the hours -- excuse me, the
11	invoices with you?
12	A Yes.
13	Q Okay. Are all of the 62 to 65 hours included
14	in the invoices, or is there additional time for which
15	you have not yet billed?
16	A There are recent hours that are not included
17	here.
18	MR. SALES: I think we're up to Exhibit Number
19	6. Is that right?
20	THE COURT REPORTER: No, seven.
21	MR. LUNDT: Seven.
22	MR. SALES: Seven, I'm sorry. Seven, yeah.
23	Can we mark as Exhibit 7 the invoices?
24	(Exhibit 7 was marked for identification)
25	MR. LUNDT: Marked.
0199
1	BY MR. SALES:
2	Q What is the rate at which you are billing for
3	the services you provided so far?
4	A Currently, $225.
5	Q Do you know what the total amount of time that
6	you've billed specific to the recent trial in Fort
7	Lauderdale was?
8	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
9	THE WITNESS: If you could clarify. Do you
10	mean hours spent on research for that case plus
11	court, or court?
12	BY MR. SALES:
13	Q The whole ball of wax.
14	MR. LUNDT: Form.
15	THE WITNESS: I don't have that information
16	with me right now.
17	BY MR. SALES:
18	Q Was the burden associated with your
19	preparation for the other case similar to, less
20	extensive or more extensive than what you have seen so
21	far in this case?
22	MR. LUNDT: Form.
23	THE WITNESS: My answer to that would be that
24	it really depends on the case. Some cases take --
25	BY MR. SALES:
0200
1	Q I'm only talking, excuse me, about this case
2	and the case you just testified in. I would like you to
3	compare, as of the time of deposition, the relative
4	labor, if you can do that for me.
5	MR. LUNDT: Form.
6	THE WITNESS: I could not do that, because I
7	would have to go back to the records to --
8	BY MR. SALES:
9	Q You just testified last week in the case, and
10	you've told me that before you testify at trial, you
11	have a good familiarity with everything that's involved
12	in the case, right?
13	MR. LUNDT: Form.
14	THE WITNESS: You mean the Buonomo case?
15	BY MR. SALES:
16	Q Yes. Any case. You prepare to testify when
17	you go to trial, don't you?
18	A Of course I do.
19	Q Well, don't you then have a good feel, having
20	testified in the Buonomo case just one week ago, for the
21	volume of material that you were required to review?
22	MR. LUNDT: Form.
23	THE WITNESS: I don't think one thing has to
24	do with the other, because the fact that I'm
25	prepared doesn't mean that I have a -- a count of
0201
1	the materials that I've seen, so I really don't
2	understand your question.
3	BY MR. SALES:
4	Q Well, I know, for example, that it takes
5	longer to take your deposition than it does other
6	historians. I haven't thought about why that may be.
7	And some of them were months ago. Okay?
8	So I'm asking you, again, can you rate, in
9	terms of the total overall effort that was necessary for
10	the preparation for your deposition, let's say, today,
11	and the preparation for your deposition in Buonomo,
12	which was more extensive, that one or this one?
13	MR. LUNDT: Form.
14	THE WITNESS: I -- I'm not ready to give you
15	an answer for that, because I don't have those --
16	those numbers with me.
17	BY MR. SALES:
18	Q How many depositions were you asked to review
19	in the Buonomo case?
20	A Buonomo case? I forget the exact number. I'm
21	trying to -- and this is ballpark figure.
22	Q Yes, sir.
23	A I think that in terms of number, there may not
24	be that much of a difference between the two cases. I
25	mean, this is to the best of my recollection. I'm
0202
1	trying to give you an answer.
2	Q You told me Mr. Buonomo already lived
3	principally, for purposes of your effort, in two places,
4	New Jersey and South Florida. Right?
5	A That's correct.
6	Q And in this case, the smoker lives, for
7	purposes of this question, in two places, essentially
8	Pittsburgh and South Florida, right?
9	MR. LUNDT: Form.
10	THE WITNESS: That is correct.
11	BY MR. SALES:
12	Q Does that help assist you at all in telling me
13	whether or not you are able to indicate, to any degree,
14	whether or not the total amount of materials needed to
15	be reviewed in the two cases was greater or less or
16	about the same?
17	MR. LUNDT: Form.
18	THE WITNESS: Well, I -- well, my answer would
19	be, generally speaking, roughly about the same, but
20	the fact that I had looked at some of the Buonomo
21	materials before means that I don't have to look at
22	them with the same extent of care, if you will,
23	or -- or attention, since I'm already familiar with
24	them. So that -- that's something that I keep in
25	mind as I'm trying to answer your question.
0203
1	BY MR. SALES:
2	Q Have you rendered a final bill in Buonomo?
3	A Final bill, no.
4	Q Are you able to tell me approximately how many
5	total hours you've spent through the time of trial on
6	the Buonomo case?
7	MR. LUNDT: Form.
8	THE WITNESS: When you mean trial, do you mean
9	as the trial was proceeding in court?
10	BY MR. SALES:
11	Q I don't know why it's a difficult question.
12	I'll repeat the question, if it helps you.
13	Starting with the beginning of time, until the
14	time the trial was concluded, if I were to ask you to
15	estimate the total number of hours expended by you as an
16	expert for the defense in Buonomo, what would that
17	number be?
18	MR. LUNDT: Form.
19	THE WITNESS: I can't answer that question,
20	for the same reason that I was trying to explain
21	before. If Buonomo, as was the case, lived in
22	South Florida, and I had already looked at
23	materials for South Florida before, that means that
24	it's less materials specifically that I'd look for.
25	Now, having just looked at and revisited South
0204
1	Florida materials, my answer is that, as it
2	pertains to South Florida materials, since I'm
3	already familiar with them, I do not revisit them
4	with the same intensity as I would -- as I have
5	when I first looked at them. I hope that helps.
6	BY MR. SALES:
7	Q Did you spend more or less than 1,000 hours in
8	working on the Buonomo case?
9	A Less.
10	Q Did you spend more or less than 500 hours
11	working on the Buonomo case?
12	A The answer would be yes, again.
13	Q Yes, what?
14	A Less than 500.
15	Q I'm sorry, I said thought you said yes.
16	Did you spend more or less, if you can tell
17	me, than 250 hours working on the Buonomo case?
18	A I can tell you, not now, but I could find how
19	many hours I've devoted specifically to the case.
20	Now, the other part of the picture is
21	materials that are relevant to the Buonomo case that I
22	have looked at in years past, so it's -- you're asking
23	me to sort of dissect --
24	Q Yes, just as you've done today, in talking
25	about the Talenfeld case, that's true. Are you able to
0205
1	tell me whether or not you've spent more or less than a
2	total of 250 hours specifically on the Buonomo case?
3	MR. LUNDT: Form.
4	THE WITNESS: I can't give you an answer to
5	that.
6	BY MR. SALES:
7	Q You do not know?
8	A I don't know.
9	Q Is it possible that you spent more than 250
10	total hours on the Buonomo case?
11	MR. LUNDT: Form.
12	THE WITNESS: I can't say with certainty.
13	I --1 don't think that --
14	BY MR. SALES:
15	Q I asked the question, possible.
16	A Okay. Well, I think I need to clarify this,
17	because I've been trying to do this. There are two ways
18	to answer your question. One is hours specifically on
19	the Buonomo case. I can give you that, not now, but I
20	can find that with a great degree of accuracy.
21	Now, I cannot tell you all of the hours that
22	I've spent researching where I have found information
23	and materials that are relevant to the Buonomo case. I
24	cannot do that.
25	Q I'm listening very carefully to everything
0206
1	you're saying. I asked you whether you could tell me if
2	it's possible. I asked you if it was possible that you
3	spent more than 1,000 hours on the case, and you told me
4	that you could tell me that it was not possible, as I
5	understand your answers. And I'm assuming we'll get to
6	a point, moving backwards, that you will not be able to
7	answer me. I understand that and appreciate that. I
8	haven't changed the questions. You answered the
9	question about a thousand hours without difficulty. You
10	answered the question about 500 hours without
11	difficulty. So I'll ask the question again.
12	Do you know, first of all, whether or not
13	you've spent more than 250 hours working specifically
14	and expressly on the Buonomo case?
15	MR. LUNDT: Form.
16	THE WITNESS: Now, here's where we're not
17	understanding one another. You just asked me
18	specifically on the Buonomo case.
19	BY MR. SALES:
20	Q Yes.
21	A And I want --
22	Q Do you know?
23	A I want to know, what do you mean by that?
24	Q The work that was not generic to cases that
25	extended beyond Buonomo, just as you told me today,
0207
1	you're able to differentiate in this case, just as you
2	understood, obviously, when you answered my question
3	about 1,000 hours. You had no difficulty answering
4	that. And I expect and appreciate that at some point,
5	there may be difficulty in answering these questions
6	because you just don't know. That's fine. I would like
7	to know what the break point is at which you don't know.
8	That's seems reasonable.
9	A I cannot give --
10	Q So I'll ask you the question again. Are you
11	able to tell me whether or not, as you've explained it
12	already to me today with respect to Talenfeld, that
13	you've spent more or less than 250 total hours working
14	on the Buonomo case?
15	MR. LUNDT: Form.
16	THE WITNESS: I can't come to that
17	calculation.
18	BY MR. SALES:
19	Q All right. Then the question that I asked you
20	which got us into this difficulty is the following
21	question. New question: Is it possible that you spent
22	more than 250 hours working exclusively on the Buonomo
23	case, without regard to general application of your work
24	to other cases?
25	MR. LUNDT: Form.
0208
1	THE WITNESS: Without -- in other words, now
2	the question is about specifically for the Buonomo,
3	not materials that may have led to the --
4	BY MR. SALES:
5	Q Right. Every one of these questions has been
6	just like that, including the ones you had no difficulty
7	answering, yes, sir.
8	MR. LUNDT: Form.
9	THE WITNESS: I have not worked -- the
10	question was 250 hours. Specifically for the
11	Buonomo case, I have not.
12	BY MR. SALES:
13	Q More than 150, if you know.
14	MR. LUNDT: Form.
15	THE WITNESS: I don't think so.
16	BY MR. SALES:
17	Q More than 100, if you know?
18	MR. LUNDT: Form.
19	THE WITNESS: I don't think so.
20	BY MR. SALES:
21	Q Do you believe it is something less, or fewer,
22	I should say, than 100 hours expressly for the Buonomo
23	case?
24	MR. LUNDT: Form.
25	THE WITNESS: Expressly, yes.
0209
1	BY MR. SALES:
2	Q How much additional labor do you expect will
3	be necessary in the four additional weeks that you will
4	need to conclude your work in this case, in terms of
5	hours?
6	A I'm not a hundred percent sure. I know that I
7	plan to read the Pittsburgh Press. That may take a
8	while. There may be other materials that I want to look
9	at. And something that I also do is, in preparation for
10	court testimony, I go over the materials carefully one
11	last time. So I don't know how many hours. When I used
12	the term, approximately four weeks, it's -- it's an
13	approximation. So I really can't give you anything more
14	specific at this point.
15	Q I take it that there are very few four
16	consecutive weeks when you're able to devote 100 percent
17	of your time to tobacco litigation.
18	A That is correct.
19	Q All right. So I assume that the four total
20	weeks of labor -- well, you tell me. Are the four total
21	weeks of labor, four total weeks of labor that will be
22	Engle -- intermingled with other responsibilities, or is
23	it a cumulative total of approximately four weeks that
24	you will have to spread out over time?
25	MR. LUNDT: Form.
0210
1	THE WITNESS: It would be hours, roughly, that
2	number of days, but not within that period. It
3	would be spread out over a couple months, perhaps
4	more.
5	BY MR. SALES:
6	Q All right. So when you said four weeks more
7	of work, you meant literally four additional total weeks
8	of labor, right?
9	A That is an estimate that I provided, yes. And
10	that's the best I can give you.
11	Q All right. Do you typically work a 40-hour
12	week, or more?
13	A In all my work?
14	Q Yes, sir.
15	A Yes, I work more than 40 hours.
16	Q All right.
17	MR. LUNDT: And, David, before we move off
18	Exhibit Number 7, just so that you know, some of
19	the invoices contained are intermingled cases
20	that -- in which the doctor had not been officially
21	disclosed, so those names had been redacted from
22	Exhibit Number 7.
23	BY MR. SALES:
24	Q Were you doing tobacco litigation-related work
25	last year?
0211
1	A Yes.
2	Q Did you receive 1099s from those who had
3	retained your services, whether it was a tobacco firm or
4	a law firm or any other firm?
5	A I received them from the law firm.
6	Q All right. Have you ever received
7	compensation directly from R.J. Reynolds?
8	A Never.
9	Q Or any other tobacco company.
10	A Never.
11	Q Has the law firm -- is that Jones Day again?
12	A Yes, that's correct.
13	Q Is Jones Day the only law firm that has
14	provided you directly with income for forensic work
15	associated with expert witness activities?
16	A That's correct.
17	Q What is the amount of the 1099 that you
18	received last year, if you know?
19	A I don't have that document with me.
20	Q Is it more than $500,000?
21	A For last year?
22	Q Yes, sir.
23	A No.
24	Q Is it more than $250,000?
25	A No.
0212
1	Q Is it more than $100,000?
2	A I'm not a hundred percent sure whether it's
3	under or over a hundred thousand dollars.
4	Q Is $100,000 in the range of what it is that
5	you would have received last year?
6	MR. LUNDT: Form.
7	THE WITNESS: Range, broadly speaking,
8	perhaps. I would like to be able to look at that
9	document before I provided you an answer.
10	BY MR. SALES:
11	Q Well, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but
12	most people know how much money they make. Do you know
13	how much your total income was last year?
14	MR. LUNDT: Form.
15	BY MR. SALES:
16	Q You don't have to tell me, but do you know how
17	much your total income was last year?
18	A I have a -- a rough idea.
19	Q Do you know what you get paid -- you don't
20	have to tell me -- from your activities as a professor
21	at the University of Central Florida?
22	MR. LUNDT: Form.
23	THE WITNESS: Yes, I do.
24	BY MR. SALES:
25	Q All right. I take it you are not
0213
1	independently wealthy.
2	MR. LUNDT: Form.
3	THE WITNESS: No, I'm not.
4	BY MR. SALES:
5	Q All right. So if you were to back out,
6	generally speaking, from what you made last year what
7	you get paid as a professor, would that give us sort of
8	a good idea of what you made doing expert witness work
9	for the tobacco firms?
10	MR. LUNDT: Form.
11	THE WITNESS: It would, but I don't have
12	that -- that information with me.
13	BY MR. SALES:
14	Q Well, what information are you lacking, if you
15	know generally how much you made last year and how much
16	you make as a professor? What information are you
17	lacking?
18	A I know how much I made as a professor. I
19	don't recall specifically, or even a ballpark figure,
20	how much I made for the consulting work. Certainly, I'm
21	not trying to hide this information. I'm being honest.
22	I don't have that information with me.
23	Q Right. And I'm just, having done this for a
24	while, trying to think of maybe some different ways of
25	trying to arrive at a figure. So can you mentally
0214
1	deduct from your total income last year what you get
2	paid as a professor of history at the University of
3	Central Florida?
4	MR. LUNDT: Form.
5	THE WITNESS: I could-
6	BY MR. SALES:
7	Q Without telling me what those numbers are?
8	A I could deduct it if I knew how much I made in
9	total. And I don't have --
10	Q You don't know how much you made last year.
11	A I would hate to give you a figure that would
12	be off.
13	Q Do you have possession of the 1099 that you
14	received from Jones Day last year?
15	A I do have possession of that.
16	MR. SALES: All right. I'll just ask
17	Christine, or whoever wants to respond, would you
18	be willing to provide that as an exhibit and submit
19	it to the court reporter as Exhibit 8 to his
20	deposition?
21	MS. LAWSON: Okay. And that's the 1099?
22	MR. SALES: Yep.
23	MS. LAWSON: Okay. We can do that.
24	(Exhibit 8 was marked for identification)
25	BY MR. SALES:
0215
1	Q All right. Do you know what percentage of
2	your total income was generated last year as a result of
3	working for -- at the request, I should say, of Jones
4	Day?
5	A I don't have that information.
6	Q Is it more than 75 percent?
7	A More than 75 percent?
8	Q Right. Did you make more than 75 percent of
9	your total income last year as a witness for -- in
10	tobacco litigation?
11	MR. LUNDT: Form.
12	THE WITNESS: I'd rather have the numbers in
13	front of me, but the best answer is that I --1
14	don't think that was the case. But, again, I'd
15	rather not give you a specific answer because I
16	can't at this point.
17	BY MR. SALES:
18	Q All right, sir. Do you expect, based on the
19	amount of work that you've been doing so for, now we're
20	in late May, for the -- relatively speaking, for the
21	percentage of your total income that is associated with
22	being an expert in tobacco litigation, to go up this
23	year, to go down, or to remain about the same?
24	MR. LUNDT: Form.
25	THE WITNESS: Based on the first months of
0216
1	this year, it is less.
2	BY MR. SALES:
3	Q All right. And based on what you know is
4	coming down the pike in terms of other assignments that
5	you have, what do you think about that?
6	MR. LUNDT: Form.
7	THE WITNESS: It's hard to tell, because it's
8	usually during the time of the court case that I
9	spend more hours. I don't know how many cases I
10	will be involved in that go to court, so I -- the
11	only thing I can do is tell you that I have a
12	general sense that this year, so far, the hours are
13	much less, fewer than --
14	BY MR. SALES:
15	Q Did you testify in any trials last year?
16	A Yes, I did.
17	Q How many?
18	A Testified in court, one.
19	Q Do you agree with me, generally speaking, that
20	the total volume of labor associated with these
21	activities is greater if one has to testify at trial?
22	A I would say that if there's testimony at
23	trial, that usually requires me to devote some more time
24	than if -- than if not.
25	Q All right. And you've already testified in
0217
1	one trial this year, right?
2	A One trial, yes.
3	Q And I may be misspeaking, but did you also not
4	tell me that you're going to be testifying in a trial in
5	Tampa?
6	MR. LUNDT: Form.
7	THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of that.
8	BY MR. SALES:
9	Q I may have misspoken.
10	All right. If you have to testify in the
11	trial in this case in the calendar year 2010, that would
12	be a total of two trials, right?
13	A That's correct.
14	MR. SALES: So for the record, and you can --
15	you don't have to respond at all, but I think,
16	under the cases which interpret and construe Rule
17	1.280, I'm entitled to know some of the answers to
18	the questions that I ask, including specifically
19	percentages. I'm perfectly comfortable with a
20	sworn statement from the witness after the
21	deposition, after he has time to review the
22	records. And I'm going to ask that that be done
23	within ten days of the conclusion of the
24	deposition. You don't have to respond, you don't
25	have to agree. You can, if you want to. But
0218
1	that's something that we can avoid taking up with
2	the Court, possibly.
3	BY MR. SALES:
4	Q All right. All right. Do you have --in
5	addition to the things that you've mentioned, you said
6	you had some other textbooks with you today, or copies
7	of textbooks, I guess?
8	A I have copies of portions of textbooks.
9	Q All right. How many?
10	A Let's see. Those would be part of the Means
11	report that we talked about.
12	Q The what report?
13	A Means report.
14	MR. LUNDT: Exhibit 4.
15	BY MR. SALES:
16	Q We've already marked that. Are the textbooks
17	that you have copied actually attached to the Means
18	report?
19	A There are copies of parts of textbooks, yes.
20	Q So is that an exhibit that you prepared, or
21	are the portions of the textbooks actually included in
22	the report itself?
23	A They're part of the report.
24	Q All right. Are there any other textbooks that
25	you have with you today?
0219
1	MR. SALES: That's been marked, has it not?
2	MR. LUNDT: Exhibit 4.
3	MR. SALES: Yeah. That's what I have, also.
4	BY MR. SALES:
5	Q Are there any other textbooks that you have
6	with you today?
7	A Well, there's another report, or maybe another
8	part of the report. Yeah. Well, no, that's it. I'm
9	sorry.
10	Q I'm not sure where we are. Are there any
11	other reports, I guess, now or textbooks in the room
12	with you today?
13	A There is one report, divided into two parts
14	because of the -- they're big, and for the sake of the
15	clips. Looking at this, they seem to be all part of the
16	same report. And in both portions, there are copies of
17	textbooks.
18	Q Who prepared that report?
19	A It's the same author, Richard K. Means.
20	MR. SALES: All right. Can we make that
21	Exhibit 8, please.
22	MS. LAWSON: Are we up to 10?
23	MR. SALES: If one of the lawyers does it as
24	we go along, we can save time.
25	(Discussion off the record.)
0220
1	MR. SALES: I'm sorry. That will be Number 9,
2	is this report.
3	I left that blank.
4	(Exhibit 9 was marked for identification)
5	BY MR. SALES:
6	Q All set?
7	A Yes.
8	Q What else have you brought with you today?
9	A Okay. Let me take a look. Other than what we
10	have gone over, right?
11	Q Right.
12	A There is a -- the transcripts from the
13	University of Pittsburgh.
14	Q All right. You can omit that. It's a single
15	page, right?
16	A It's a single page, with a certificate of
17	authenticity attached to it.
18	Q All right. You can omit that.
19	What else do you have?
20	A I have copies of the invoices that I've
21	submitted.
22	Q I think those have been marked?
23	THE WITNESS: They have?
24	MR. LUNDT: Yes, they've been marked.
25	THE WITNESS: Yes, they have been marked.
0221
1	I have a document in front of me --
2	MR. LUNDT: That's part of what's been marked.
3	THE WITNESS: Yes. Okay.
4	MR. LUNDT: All of those are part of the
5	exhibit. That, too. All marked.
6	THE WITNESS: I have copies of my previous
7	depositions in court and dep -- testimony in court
8	and depositions. I have copies of all of them.
9	BY MR. SALES:
10	Q Why don't you -- do you mind identifying
11	the -- are they annotated in any way, or are they just
12	plain copies?
13	A They're plain --
14	Q Tell you what let's do. Never mind.
15	Do you have those in one stack, your prior
16	trial testimony and prior deposition testimony?
17	A Is one stack, and there are --
18	MR. SALES: All right. We'll mark that as
19	Exhibit 10.
20	Is someone else doing the marking, so I can
21	keep going?
22	MR. LUNDT: Yeah. Go ahead.
23	(Exhibit 10 was marked for identification)
24	BY MR. SALES:
25	Q What else do you have?
0222
1	A I have the depositions for the Talenfeld case,
2	and the interrogatories and complaints.
3	Q Are they annotated in any way, or is it just
4	plain copies?
5	A Let me tell you what -- what they have. I
6	tend not to write on them. When I'm done with them, I
7	write "okay" on the front page. There may be a few
8	instances where I make a mark, a checkmark, so that I --
9	when I take a break, I know where to come back.
10	Q All right.
11	A In essence, that's -- that's what -- what they
12	have.
13	Q You can push those aside.
14	A I'm sorry?
15	Q You can push those aside.
16	A Okay.
17	Q Do you have anything else with you today?
18	A Yes. I have copies of the reliance lists. I
19	have two versions of that.
20	Q The one we've been work being off of today, as
21	counsel explained, is dated May 14 -- 2010, correct?
22	A Yes, I have that one.
23	Q So the numbers that you've reported to me as
24	we've gone through today are off of that list, right?
25	A That is correct.
0223
1	MR. SALES: Why don't we mark that as
2	Exhibit 11.
3	(Exhibit 11 was marked for identification)
4	BY MR. SALES:
5	Q And you brought the earlier version of the
6	reliance list?
7	A The other version I have is from 9/4/2009.
8	Q And I think we touched on this earlier in the
9	deposition. Are you, without comparing them side by
10	side, aware of any principle which would allow you to
11	tell me what the difference between the two is, what's
12	been deleted, what's been added, generally speaking?
13	A I can't speak to that, other than the fact
14	that the size is different and the number of materials
15	included is different.
16	Q Did you have any input in the process by which
17	the reliance list was reduced in size? And I do believe
18	it's a reduction.
19	A I don't recall specifically.
20	MR. SALES: Okay. Let's attach the earlier
21	version of the reliance list as Exhibit 12.
22	(Exhibit 12 was marked for identification)
23	BY MR. SALES:
24	Q What else have you brought?
25	A I have disks with the title, Marraffino versus
0224
1	R.J.R., Martinez-Femandez materials. These are --1
2	believe these are the digital copies of -- or the
3	computer copies of the actual list.
4	Q The actual lists or the actual contents of the
5	lists?
6	A You know, I'm not -- I'm not a hundred percent
7	sure whether they're also --
8	MR. SALES: Maybe counsel can help us out.
9	MS. LAWSON: These are the actual hard copies
10	or videos of the materials on the reliance list,
11	David. And they're--
12	MR. SALES: How many disks do you have?
13	MR. LUNDT: We have three.
14	MR. SALES: All right. It's probable --
15	BY MR. SALES:
16	Q Well, let me ask you this: Doctor, have you
17	ever looked at those disks?
18	A No, I have not.
19	Q Other than the review of the educational
20	source materials that you mentioned last night, leaving
21	that aside for the moment, when is the last time that
22	you looked at anything on the reliance list in the
23	Talenfeld case with an eye toward preparing for your
24	deposition today?
25	A I was doing that until very recently. When --
0225
1	when the Buonomo case dates became evident, then I set
2	that aside. But over the last three, four days, I have
3	been looking at Talenfeld materials.
4	MR. SALES: That would be Number 13, correct?
5	The disks.
6	MR. LUNDT: The disks, yes.
7	MR. SALES: All right. Let's attach those.
8	(Exhibit 13 was marked for identification)
9	BY MR. SALES:
10	Q What else do you have with you today?
11	A I am looking through, and I believe everything
12	else has been --
13	MR. LUNDT: David, we've got a set of
14	handwritten notes.
15	MR. SALES: All right. Let's leave those
16	until last. I heard those mentioned earlier. I'm
17	aware of that.
18	MR. LUNDT: And we also have --
19	BY MR. SALES:
20	Q Other than the notes, is there anything else?
21	MR. LUNDT: We have some e-mail correspondence
22	that involved Dr. Martinez.
23	BY MR. SALES:
24	Q All right. Have you communicated by e-mail
25	with the lawyers in the case, sir?
0226
1	A I have.
2	Q Do you have all of the e-mails that have gone
3	between you and the lawyers in this case, if you know?
4	A In this case? I don't think we have
5	communicated over e-mail for this case. That -- that is
6	my recollection.
7	Q What are the e-mails that are in the
8	deposition room today?
9	A Okay. There are 20 of them. One of them is a
10	communication from Dr. William Stueck.
11	Q Oh, I see. Okay.
12	A Should I go over the list?
13	Q Yeah. How many e-mails are there?
14	A Twenty.
15	Q Twenty, or plenty?
16	A Twenty.
17	Q Can you be any more specific? Because I can't
18	see you.
19	A Twenty, as in the number, two-zero.
20	Q Oh, I see. I thought you said plenty.
21	Generally speaking, what's contained in the
22	e-mails that you have? Are they all with Stuecks, or
23	there are other parties?
24	A Other parties.
25	Q Who are the other parties?
0227
1	A There is communication between myself and a
2	transcriber.
3	Q Are you still looking?
4	A Yes, I am.
5	There's two with Terry Fife from History
6	Works.
7	I'm still looking. And that's it.
8	MR. SALES: Let's mark those as a Composite
9	Exhibit Number 14.
10	(Exhibit 14 was marked for identification)
11	MR. SALES: And we'll make the notes
12	Exhibit 15.
13	(Exhibit 15 was marked for identification)
14	MR. SALES: All set?
15	MR. LUNDT: Yep.
16	BY MR. SALES:
17	Q Can you tell me, generally, sir, what your
18	note-taking practices are in a case such as this?
19	A I take notes from the materials and documents
20	as I read them, as I read them. Sometimes, rather than
21	take the notes myself, what I do is that I mark segments
22	within, say, a photocopy of a newspaper article, and I
23	mark that to be transcribed. So I don't take the notes,
24	actually, but I do select the portions to be
25	transcribed. And I keep notes -- sometimes my notes are
0228
1	by hand. Oftentimes, the notes are in electronic files.
2	Q Have you ever heard the expression, cigarette
3	controversy?
4	A Cigarette controversy? It's very likely that
5	I have.
6	Q What, if any, meaning does that expression
7	have to you, as a historian?
8	A Well, it would depend on the context in which
9	I read that. Generally speaking, it has to do with
10	discussions about cigarettes and their effects on
11	health.
12	Q Have you read any books which attempt to
13	chronicle the 20th Century history in America of smoking
14	and health-related issues?
15	A I've come across chronologies to that effect.
16	Actually, a couple of good chronologies.
17	Q Have you read any of the historical works that
18	have been published in the last, let us say, 15 years or
19	so, that attempts to describe the issues of smoking and
20	health in the United States in the 20th Century?
21	A I have gained familiarity with the titles and
22	the authors, and I have read through some of them,
23	portions, but not extensively.
24	Q What are some of the titles or authors with
25	whom or with which you are familiar?
0229
1	A I would have to consult my list to be able to
2	tell you which ones I've looked at.
3	Q Which list would you be looking at?
4	A I have a list of the materials that I've read
5	already. And that has been referred to before as the
6	master list of documents, and I believe that that is
7	included in the disks that we were talking about
8	previously.
9	Q Can you recall any of the authors or book
10	titles?
11	A Not really, at this point. They haven't been
12	the focus of my research.
13	Q What is your understanding of when it was that
14	Mrs. Talenfeld started smoking cigarettes?
15	A Based on the depositions, I roughly recall --
16	and I may be wrong, give or take a few years, that it
17	may have been 14 or 15 years of age.
18	Q That would put us in what year or what years,
19	approximately?
20	A Okay. I'm doing the math on a piece of paper.
21	So she was bom in '31, and if we add 15, that would be
22	about 1946.
23	Q '46?
24	A Yes, '46.
25	Q What is your understanding of the brands of
0230
1	cigarettes that Mrs. Talenfeld smoked, those that you
2	can recall during her lifetime?
3	A I can't recall right now, other than there may
4	have been mention of Benson & Hedges. This is just the
5	best that I can do, but I can't respond with any
6	certainty.
7	Q Do you know who makes Benson & Hedges
8	cigarettes?
9	A No, I'm not aware of the maker.
10	Q Do you know who the remaining Defendants are
11	in this case?
12	A Defendants?
13	Q Yes. Do you know who the Defendants are in
14	this case?
15	A I know that there are other tobacco companies.
16	I couldn't tell you whether -- which ones there are,
17	unless I looked at some of the case materials, which are
18	on this table.
19	Q Do you recall what types of cigarettes
20	Mrs. Talenfeld was smoking in the '40s or '50s?
21	A Not specifically, no.
22	Q Do you have any recollection of that
23	whatsoever?
24	A No, I don't.
25	Q Do you recall seeing that information
0231
1	described or discussed in the discovery materials that
2	you received?
3	A I do recall reading names of particular
4	brands. I do recall that.
5	Q Do you know who the manufacturer of the
6	Chesterfield cigarette was in the 1940s and '50s?
7	A I don't have that information.
8	Q Do you know who the manufacturer was of the
9	Salem brand of cigarettes in the 1940s and '50s?
10	A Salem? I believe that's Reynolds. I may be
11	wrong.
12	Q Have you ever heard of the cigarette firm now
13	known as Liggett Group, L.L.C., previously known as
14	Liggett & Myers and some other names? Have you ever
15	heard of Liggett?
16	A I have heard of that company, yes.
17	Q Do you know anything about Liggett's stature
18	or standing as an American historian? Do you know
19	anything about that? And let us say in the 1940s or
20	'50s.
21	A Well, roughly, this is what I know. If I
22	recall correctly, they're based in Durham, at least some
23	of their plants. That is something that I --1 think is
24	accurate. I lived in Durham, and I think I recall
25	seeing that. I'm not a hundred percent sure, but they
0232
1	may have been part of the American Tobacco Company.
2	That's the extent of my knowledge.
3	Q Where would you have gotten that idea from?
4	A Well, reading about the topic over the years,
5	the American Tobacco Company had many dealings with the
6	Caribbean, and I know a little bit about the story of
7	that company and what happened to it early in the
8	20th Century as far as being split into smaller
9	companies. That much, I know.
10	Q Well, I'd like you to focus on Liggett. That
11	is a name that's familiar to you?
12	A It is, yes.
13	Q All right. And do you have a feel for,
14	focusing now just on Liggett and its predecessor firms
15	in the 1940s and '50s, do you have a feel for the size
16	of Liggett, vis-a-vis the other manufacturers?
17	A I don't --1 don't know about the size and how
18	it compares to others over the years, no, I don't know.
19	Q Do you have a feel for the popularity of any
20	of Liggett's cigarette brands, including the
21	Chesterfield brand, during the 1940s or '50s?
22	MR. LUNDT: Form.
23	THE WITNESS: I really don't have any basis to
24	answer that question.
25	BY MR. SALES:
0233
1	Q Do you recognize the name of Liggett as a
2	major manufacturer in the 1940s and '50s of American
3	cigarettes?
4	MR. LUNDT: Form.
5	MS. LUTHER: Object to the form.
6	THE WITNESS: I couldn't tell you major. I'm
7	pretty sure it was one of the big companies. But
8	in comparison to others, I --1 wouldn't be able to
9	answer that.
10	BY MR. SALES:
11	Q Would you agree with me that in the 1940s and
12	'50s, it is likely that Liggett, as a major manufacturer
13	of American cigarettes, knew more about the health risks
14	of cigarettes than Mrs. Talenfeld did?
15	MS. LUTHER: Object to the form.
16	MR. LUNDT: Join.
17	THE WITNESS: Let me answer it as clearly as I
18	can, by saying that I'm not aware of how much and
19	what the companies knew, but it is very reasonable
20	to infer, with a great degree of -- of accuracy,
21	and knowing what I know about Mrs. Talenfeld based
22	on the depositions, that the companies were in a
23	position to have a much broader knowledge about the
24	product that they were manufacturing.
25	BY MR. SALES:
0234
1	Q Would you agree, in light of that testimony,
2	that in the 1940s and '50s, it is likely that Liggett
3	knew more about the properties of nicotine than
4	Mrs. Talenfeld did?
5	MS. LAWSON: Form.
6	MS. LUTHER: Object to the form. Kelly
7	Luther.
8	THE WITNESS: My answer would be along the
9	same lines. Not knowing what the companies knew,
10	the fact that they were the producers leads me to
11	believe that they were more informed about tobacco
12	than the average person.
13	BY MR. SALES:
14	Q Same questions about R.J. Reynolds. Would you
15	agree with me that in the 1940s and '50s, it is likely
16	that R.J. Reynolds knew more about the health effects of
17	cigarette smoking than Mrs. Talenfeld did?
18	MR. LUNDT: Object to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: The answer would be same. Not
20	knowing what the company actually knew, it is
21	reasonable to infer that they were more familiar
22	with their products than a regular consumer, such
23	as Mrs. Talenfeld.
24	BY MR. SALES:
25	Q Would you agree that in the 1940s and '50s, it
0235
1	is likely that R.J. Reynolds knew more about the
2	properties of nicotine than Mrs. Talenfeld did?
3	MR. LUNDT: Form.
4	THE WITNESS: The answer would be the same,
5	not knowing what the company knew.
6	BY MR. SALES:
7	Q Not knowing what the company knew, what?
8	A About nicotine. That was your question,
9	right?
10	Q Yes. Your answer would be the same?
11	A That's correct.
12	MR. LUNDT: Form.
13	BY MR. SALES:
14	Q Have you ever made it a study of any kind to
15	investigate what the American cigarette firms did know
16	about the health effects of cigarette smoking at any
17	historic time prior to, let us say, 2000?
18	A The--the only thing I can tell you about
19	that is that I read, and have been reading for many
20	years, what appears in newspapers, in the media. And I
21	can only tell you the type of information that they
22	provided, for example, when they were being interviewed.
23	And I'm referring to tobacco executives.
24	Q Leaving that aside for the moment, what you've
25	read casually, as a nonexpert witness, leaving that
0236
1	aside for the moment, have you, in this case, ever made
2	any study of the knowledge base of the American
3	cigarette firms, at any time prior to the year 2000,
4	with respect to the health effects of cigarettes?
5	A I have not.
6	Q Same question with respect to the properties
7	of nicotine. Prior to, let us say the year 2000,
8	meaning a chronologic point in time, have you ever made
9	study of the knowledge base of the American cigarette
10	firms as to the properties of nicotine?
11	A I have not.
12	Q Is that something that could historically be
13	examined by someone familiar with the methods of an
14	American historian?
15	MR. LUNDT: Form.
16	THE WITNESS: It's possible that that could be
17	studied, yes.
18	BY MR. SALES:
19	Q What is your understanding of the issues in
20	this case, the Talenfeld case?
21	MR. LUNDT: Objection to form.
22	THE WITNESS: Could you be more specific than
23	just --
24	BY MR. SALES:
25	Q What are we in court about? What is the case
0237
1	about?
2	MR. LUNDT: Form.
3	THE WITNESS: The case is about a woman who
4	was a smoker for a portion of her lifetime. She
5	became ill with cancer. Judging from the materials
6	that I looked at, that cancer went into remission.
7	She had a variety of other health issues. She died
8	in the year 2001.
9	I don't know how much more I should expand
10	(sic).
11	BY MR. SALES:
12	Q I was looking for more of a perspective as a
13	forensic testifying expert witness in a lawsuit, if you
14	understood what the issues, the legal issues, for
15	example, in the case are, if you know.
16	MR. LUNDT: Form.
17	THE WITNESS: The legal issues are really
18	beyond my scope. I do have an understanding that
19	this is part of the Engle cases. I understand that
20	there is a complaint against the tobacco companies.
21	And if I recall correctly, the plaintiffs argue
22	that her death was caused by smoking cigarettes.
23	BY MR. SALES:
24	Q Do you understand that the Defendants in this
25	case take the position that Mrs. Talenfeld's medical
0238
1	problems, I'll say, generically, that may have been
2	associated with cigarette smoking are her own
3	responsibility and not theirs?
4	MR. LUNDT: Form.
5	THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of that.
6	BY MR. SALES:
7	Q Do you understand that one of the things that
8	the defendants have raised in this case is something
9	called comparative negligence or comparative fault?
10	MR. LUNDT: Form.
11	THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of that, either.
12	BY MR. SALES:
13	Q Do you understand that in this case, that one
14	of the things that the jury might be asked to do will be
15	to analyze the extent of Mrs. Talenfeld's responsibility
16	for her own illness, versus those, the responsibility of
17	the defendants?
18	MR. LUNDT: Form.
19	THE WITNESS: Based on what I know of the
20	previous cases, that may be the case.
21	BY MR. SALES:
22	Q If that were the case, would you agree with
23	me, generally speaking, that it would be useful for the
24	jury to know not only what Mrs. Talenfeld was exposed
25	to, but to also know what it was that the Defendants
0239
1	knew and did?
2	MR. LUNDT: Form.
3	THE WITNESS: I can't comment on that. I know
4	the type of research that I'm doing, which has to
5	do with public awareness, not the tobacco
6	companies.
7	BY MR. SALES:
8	Q Have you, in your research in this case,
9	found -- or any of these cases -- found anything that
10	the tobacco firms could have done, at any point in time,
11	that might have enhanced public understanding of the
12	risks of cigarette consumption?
13	MR. LUNDT: Form.
14	THE WITNESS: If I may have -- If I have found
15	something that they may have done or said? Could
16	you clarify -- could you clarify the question?
17	BY MR. SALES:
18	Q Yes. Let's take 1964. That's a bellwether
19	year in this area, right?
20	A Correct.
21	Q All right. And I'm not trying to limit you in
22	your testimony, of course, but one of the reasons it was
23	a bellwether year was because of the release of the
24	surgeon general's report, which you've touched on a few
25	times today, correct?
0240
1	A That's correct.
2	Q It received widespread attention; did it not?
3	A It did.
4	Q And one of the opinions that you hold in this
5	case is that it would be very difficult for any
6	American, an educated person in particular, to avoid
7	being exposed to the content, generally speaking, of
8	what was being talked about in the public, vis-a-vis
9	that report.
10	A Yeah, I would put --
11	Q Right?
12	A I would put it in the positive terms, that the
13	information reached the people -- the population --
14	Q Right.
15	A -- such as Mrs. Talenfeld, yes.
16	Q Right. Have you made any study of anything
17	that the Defendant cigarette firms might have done or
18	said, at that point in time, to further ratify or
19	enhance that very public understanding?
20	MR. LUNDT: Form.
21	THE WITNESS: I have not done research on that
22	subject.
23	BY MR. SALES:
24	Q Have you seen, in the research you have
25	conducted, what it was that the tobacco firms did in
0241
1	response to the publication of the surgeon general's
2	report?
3	MR. LUNDT: Object to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: I have looked at the -- what
5	appeared in the media, newspapers, for example, and
6	in some of those articles there is a -- a voice
7	from the industry. So I have --
8	BY MR. SALES:
9	Q Are you one -- I'm sorry. Are you finished?
10	A So I have a clear understanding of at least
11	responses that have appeared in the media.
12	Q Are you one of the folks who say that, for
13	whatever reason, whatever the industry itself had to say
14	about issues of smoking and health in the 1950s or '60s,
15	that that information, to use a phrase you used, did not
16	reach the public?
17	MR. LUNDT: Form.
18	THE WITNESS: There were -- there was some
19	information that reached the public through the
20	media, and -- and it was widely distributed.
21	BY MR. SALES:
22	Q Do you agree with me that to the extent that
23	the industry was itself quoted in newspapers and on
24	television, for example, that the information contained
25	in the messages that they communicated also reached the
0242
1	public?
2	MS. LUTHER: Object to the form. Kelly.
3	THE WITNESS: I agree with the fact that it
4	reached the public, yes.
5	BY MR. SALES:
6	Q Do you -- have you seen a copy of the
7	disclosure in this case?
8	A Yes, I have one here.
9	Q Why don't you take a minute to review it, and
10	then I'm going to ask you some questions about your
11	opinions. Okay?
12	A Okay.
13	MR. LUNDT: Excuse me. David, while he's
14	doing that, can we just take a two-minute restroom
15	break, please?
16	MR. SALES: Yeah. Sure. I'll do the same.
17	(A recess was taken.)
18	THE WITNESS: I'm done reading.
19	BY MR. SALES:
20	Q Are you prepared to express the final opinions
21	which you have in the Talenfeld case?
22	A Final opinions? I have pretty set opinions,
23	based on what I've done so far. They may be expanded
24	upon -- based on new materials that I may look at
25	between now and then. But, in essence, this document is
0243
1	an accurate reflection of what I plan to be testifying
2	on.
3	Q All right. Tell me what your opinions are.
4	I'm not asking you to read from the document. You're
5	free to consult it. That's why we looked at it. But
6	what are your opinions, sir?
7	A Well, my opinions have to do with the fact
8	that beginning as far back as the late 1800s, and even
9	before that, there was information available to the
10	public, reaching the public in a variety of ways, about
11	the health consequences of smoking; that that
12	information became increasingly sophisticated and
13	science-based as time went on, that it included links
14	between smoking and a variety of illnesses, among them
15	lung cancer, heart disease, also, premature death; as
16	well as the fact that cigarettes could be habit-forming
17	or addictive, depending on the language used at a
18	particular time.
19	I'm also ready to testify -- I'm sorry. I'm
20	also ready to testify that this was true during the
21	lifetime of Mrs. Phyllis Talenfeld, and that this kind
22	of information was available to her through a variety of
23	media, including T.V., newspapers, magazines, government
24	publications, things of that sort.
25	I'm also ready to say that the information was
0244
1	increasing over time, and particularly during the early
2	'50s, a number of scientific studies received quite
3	widespread coverage in the media, which linked tobacco
4	with premature death, illnesses, and the fact that it
5	was hard to quit. That I also include in this document
6	the types of materials that I'm basing my opinion on,
7	and the listing includes several newspapers, magazines.
8	It includes polling and survey data. It includes the
9	pamphlets that we have talked about before.
10	And, in essence, that is my intended
11	testimony.
12	Q We haven't talked about polling at any point
13	in time prior to today. Are you able to identify today
14	the specific polls about which you will express an
15	opinion at the time of trial?
16	A Yes. I have looked at many different polls.
17	They are from different sources. Most of them are
18	Gallup polls. Some of them are Roper polls. There may
19	be another agency conducting polls that I may have
20	missed to mention at this point. And I do recall some
21	specific dates, for example, and I recall 1957 polls,
22	1964 polls. That is as specific as I can get in terms
23	of dates for the polls.
24	Q Is the 1957 poll a Roper poll or a Gallup
25	poll, or some other agency?
0245
1	A I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I --1
2	would not feel uncomfortable saying that it -- it's
3	likely that it was Gallup. Most of them were, the ones
4	that I looked at.
5	Q So that would be true of the 1964 poll, you
6	think that's a Gallup poll, also?
7	A I believe so.
8	Q Other than what appears to be a '57 Gallup
9	poll and a '64 Gallup poll, are you prepared to identify
10	today any other polls about which you will express an
11	opinion specifically?
12	A Let's see. There were polls about some more
13	recent events, such -- well, not more recent,
14	necessarily. But there was one, I think, 1962, that
15	asked people to recognize Fidel Castro, to see how many
16	people knew who he was, and -- and like that one,
17	there's several. But I don't have a list in front of
18	me.
19	Q Well, I'm doing the same thing I was doing
20	before. I'm trying to draw a circle. I'm familiar with
21	the polls that you've mentioned, if they're, in fact,
22	the ones I think they are. So I'm not too concerned
23	about that. I'm trying to draw a circle around the
24	polls or polling data that you may show the jury and
25	comment on at the trial. Are you prepared to do that
0246
1	today?
2	A I'm not prepared to do that now, in terms of
3	giving you specific dates of the polls and who conducted
4	them. I do plan to use a sampling of these that is
5	quite wide, and I intend to use polls that are -- that
6	are -- that have a constant, if you will, message. In
7	other words, that these are polls that are not off the
8	wall in one direction or another, but they are --
9	they -- they create a consensus as far as information.
10	Q Are you prepared to identify the actual polls
11	that form the sampling that you will use to express an
12	opinion today?
13	A Beyond the few examples that I've given you,
14	I'm not ready to do that. I don't have that information
15	fresh in my mind. I'm sorry.
16	Q Some of the few prior cases I have worked on,
17	some of the experts have talked about, and these are my
18	words, not theirs, a changing concept of the word
19	"addiction," or words that may, for some, be synonymous
20	with addiction.
21	Do you intend, from a historical point of
22	view, to offer opinion testimony about the changing
23	nature of the word "addiction" in American -- in the
24	American consciousness?
25	MR. LUNDT: Form.
0247
1	THE WITNESS: I'm not prepared to do that,
2	because some of these definitions would -- are
3	technical definitions that physicians and
4	scientists are -- and psychologists are familiar
5	with, so I would not venture into that realm. I
6	can say that the word "addiction" or "addicted,"
7	these are words that are used by people in
8	different ways. A scientist in a scholarly
9	publication would use it in a particular term --
10	sense, I should say, but maybe a 1940 school
11	textbook may be using that particular word, but I
12	don't think they're talking about the same thing.
13	BY MR. SALES:
14	Q Let me see if I can focus you further. And
15	maybe this is not something that you've done in the
16	past.
17	I have seen experts in these cases talk about
18	how, for example, 1988 might have been the defining
19	moment in the concept of addiction in America. Does
20	that have any meaning to you?
21	MR. LUNDT: Form.
22	THE WITNESS: I have not come across
23	information to that effect.
24	BY MR. SALES:
25	Q Can you think of anything that happened in the
0248
1	history of public health in this country, or issues of
2	smoking and health, that might have changed the way that
3	Americans look at the word "addiction," in or about
4	1988?
5	MR. LUNDT: Form.
6	THE WITNESS: 1988. This is -
7	BY MR. SALES:
8	Q And this may not be something that you do, so
9	I just want to get rid of it. If it's not, that's fine.
10	A I'm trying to think. I --1 do recall, and
11	this was not part of my research. I vaguely recall
12	coverage in the news in which tobacco farmers were
13	complaining about that -- that use of the word in
14	reference to tobacco. That is my recollection, and it
15	would have been around that year. There may be other
16	reasons. I'm trying to give you as much as I can,
17	within reason.
18	Q Well, I think you already answered the
19	question, but let me ask it this way: Do you -- are you
20	aware, presently, that you may be offering historical
21	testimony about the changing nature of the term
22	"addiction" in the United States in the 20th Century?
23	MR. LUNDT: Form.
24	THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of that, no. And
25	if I were asked in court, I would respond the same
0249
1	way, that there are these technical definitions of
2	the word "addiction," that I'm not an expert in --
3	remotely an expert.
4	BY MR. SALES:
5	Q Fine. I think I'm through with that. Don't
6	worry about that anymore.
7	Have we generally discussed, by way of subject
8	matter, and I understand it's in a summary fashion so
9	far, what your opinions are in this case, subject to all
10	the caveats and warnings you've given me about things
11	you haven't done yet?
12	A Correct.
13	MR. SALES: I don't have any further
14	questions.
15	MR. LUNDT: No questions here, and we will
16	read.
17	MR. SALES: Kelly, do you have anything?
18	MS. LUTHER: I have nothing.
19	MR. SALES: I'd like a copy of the deposition
20	and all the exhibits. And, Christine, if you have
21	any trouble supplementing the ones that you agreed
22	to include, just let me know, and we'll see what we
23	can do about it. All right?
24	MS. LAWSON: Yes. We'll -
25	MR. SALES: And I would like an answer to the
0250
1	percentage of income question. I think it's
2	reasonable, I think it's fair, I think it's
3	allowed. Doesn't seem like we should have motion
4	practice on that, but I'll leave that up to y'all.
5	Is this Veritext?
6	THE COURT REPORTER: Yes.
7	MR. SALES: Whatever my firm's standing order
8	is, I'm committed to paying that with general
9	delivery.
10	MS. LUTHER: Do not want a copy of the
11	deposition.
12	MR. LUNDT: Read, please.
