DIRECT EXAMINATION
8 BY MR. GARCIA:
9 Q. Good morning, Doctor.
10 A. Good morning.
11 Q. Nice to see you again.
12 A. Same here.
13 Q. Since we last met on Wednesday, August 15,
14 2012, have you done any more work on the case of the
15 Estate of Juanita Thurston?
16 A. Yes, I have.
17 Q. Briefly tell me what you have done.
18 A. I looked at some of the newspapers that I had
19 identified. I read them, I took notes. I also looked
20 at the depositions that I had not read yet for this
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]21 case. I read them and I took notes. I also looked at
22 some of the materials that I had gathered at various
23 depositories previous to that first deposition. I
24 looked at that those as well. I also went back to the
25 materials that were pertinent to the textbooks for
187
1 Florida and I looked at that again.
2
3
Basically that's what I recall.
Q. Well, when we were last together, we were
4 discussing textbooks, so I wonder if, since then,
5 you've had an opportunity to determine which textbooks
6 would have reached Juanita Thurston at the school she
7 attended in Pompano Beach, Florida.
8 A. Yes, I have reached that conclusion.
9 Q. Are the textbooks that you're going to tell
10 me about contained in the infamous reliance list that
11 we were discussing last time?
12 A. I believe they're on the list, yes.
13 Q. Are you prepared to give me the names of
14 those textbooks?
15 A. Yes, I'm ready to do that.
16 Q. Are you prepared to give me the reference
17 numbers for those textbooks so that we can easily
18 locate them on the reliance list?
19
A. I don't have the record numbers with me.
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]20
Q. Okay. Did you bring any documents with you
21 today that you're prepared to share with us for
22 purposes of today's continuation deposition?
23 A. Yes, I did.
24 Q. Are those the documents that I see in front
25 of you?
188
1 A. That's correct.
2 Q. Would you tell me what it is that you brought
3 with you, please?
4
A. Yes. I have a one-page document entitled
5 "Odom case health textbooks."
6
Q. May I see it? Is this a copy for us to use
7 and attach to the deposition?
8
9
10
11
12
A. Yes.
MR. GARCIA: So we will mark this as
Plaintiff's Exhibit 23 for identification.
(Plaintiff's Exhibit 23 was marked for
identification.)
13 BY MR. GARCIA:
14
Q. As I'm looking at this document, there's a
15 column with years, there's a column with grades and
16 then there's books or titles of books as well. Is
17 that right?
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]18 A. Yes.
19 Q. So taking the first title on this list,
20 "Health Stories in Practice" by Burkhard, Chambers and
21 Maroney, is it your opinion within a reasonable degree
22 of historical probability that this is a textbook
23 Juanita Thurston was exposed to when she was in the
24 3rd grade?
25
A. Yes.
189
1
Q. Would the same be true for the rest of the
2 books on this list for each of the grades referenced?
3
A. Yes. There's some years that there's
4 possibly two options.
5
Q. Well, what year would that be? Would that be
6 the 5th grade and 7th grade?
7 A. That's correct.
8 Q. What you're telling me, in the 5th grade, she
9 would have gotten either "Building for Health" or
10 "health at Work and Play"?
11 A. That's correct.
12 Q. So what did you do in order to determine that
13 these are books that were used at the school that
14 Juanita Thursday attended in Pompano?
15
A. Yes. I have some materials that I've looked
16 at over the years that are Florida educational
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]17 materials and those materials state very clearly which
18 books were adopted for all of the state during
19 particular years.
20
Q. So help me understand what you did then to
21 determine whether, for example, the first book on your
22 list, "Health Stories and Practice," was actually used
23 at the Pompano Beach High School.
24
A. What I did was I went back to materials --
25 and let me clarify a little bit more what I meant by
190
1 that. There are publications from the Florida State
2 Department of Education that inform about which
3 textbooks are adopted per year. So I went back to
4 those and made these determinations.
5 Q. What are those documents?
6 A. Some of them are actually publications that
7 are precisely that -- a list of adopted textbooks for
8 the State of Florida. Others, if I recall correctly,
9 are general guides for the teaching of particular
10 courses that do provide that information.
11
Q. Are the source materials that you're
12 referring to located on the reliance list?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Do you have a reference number for those
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]15 sources listed?
16 A. I don't have reference numbers.
17 Q. Well, what is the name of that source list if
18 I have to try and find it on this reliance list?
19
A. I believe that they are individually
20 presented there by author and title and date. Are you
21 referring to the title of the book or the list that
22 tells you which books were in use in Pompano at the
23 relevant times.
24
The list would be something that appeared in
25 a publication.
191
1
Q. Right. I'm trying to find out -- what
2 publication did that list appear?
3
A. I can't give you an exact title at this
4 point. What I can tell you, in essence, is what these
5 publications were. These publications were -- I think
6 they were called bulletins produced by the State of
7 Florida Education Department and that prescribed which
8 texts were to be adopted.
9
Q. Are the bulletins that you mentioned included
10 in the reliance list?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Do you have the reference number for the
13 bulletins?
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]14 A. No, I don't have reference numbers.
15 Q. Do you have a copy of the bulletin here in
16 the materials that you brought with you?
17 A. No.
18 Q. So how will I find -- what do I need to do to
19 find where those bulletins are located in the reliance
20 list?
21
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
22 BY MR. GARCIA:
23 Q. How will I find them?
24 A. I don't know a short way of finding them, but
25 they're there. I don't know if your computer will
192
1 allow you to do a search by title. That may be a way
2 of finding them.
3 Q. What is the title of the bulletin?
4 A. I guess, if you search for the board
5 bulletin, that may help. I don't remember the exact
6 title.
7 Q. How many bulletins are there?
8 A. I can't put a number on that.
9 Q. All right. Insofar as trying to understand
10 how you arrived at the titles of the books that are
11 contained in Exhibit 23, what you're telling me is
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]12 that there is a document called a bulletin that would
13 tell me what books the State of Florida Education
14 Department would have sanctioned for use at the school
15 in Pompano where Juanita Thurston went to school?
16
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
17 BY MR. GARCIA:
18 Q. Is that right?
19 A. Those materials exist. I believe the word
20 "bulletin" is in them.
21
Q. But you're not in a position to give me the
22 reference number for the bulletin on the reliance
23 list, right?
24 A. I don't have reference numbers.
25 Q. Is it one bulletin or is it more than one
193
1 bulletin that you looked at in order to generate the
2 list on Exhibit 23?
3 A. It would be more than one.
4 Q. Did you do anything else besides look at
5 these bulletin documents, which are in the reliance
6 list somewhere, in order to confirm that the books on
7 Exhibit 23 are the ones that Juanita Thurston would've
8 been exposed to while she went to school in Pompano?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. What else did you look at?
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]11
A. There's a report entitled, "The Means Report"
12 focusing on Florida.
13 Q. What is The Means Report?
14 A. It's a report put together by a historian
15 whose last name is Means -- M-E-A-N-S.
16 Q. What does it tell you?
17 A. That's a report that looks at the history of
18 education in the State of Florida and includes
19 information on the kinds of curricula that were in
20 place, information about laws pertaining to education
21 in Florida, and also information on textbook
22 adoptions.
23
Q. What did The Means Report tell you that you
24 relied upon as a foundation for the list of books on
25 Exhibit 23?
194
1
A. It included a listing of textbooks and it
2 also included copies of these bulletins.
3
Q. Okay. Do you have a copy of The Means Report
4 with you?
5 A. Not with me.
6 Q. Do you know what the reference number for The
7 Means Report is on the reliance list?
8
A. I don't.
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]9
Q. What else did you look at, if anything,
10 relative to the textbooks?
11 A. That was it.
12 Q. All right. So you looked at the bulletins
13 and you looked at The Means Report, correct?
14
A. Well, I looked at the bulletins, The Means
15 Report and there were other materials such as
16 curricular guides.
17 Q. What curricular guides did you look at?
18 A. I don't have the titles.
19 Q. Are the curricular guides contained in the
20 reliance list?
21 A. I believe so.
22 Q. Do you have a reference number for the
23 curricular guides?
24 A. I don't.
25 Q. If I was to search for them, what would I
195
1 need to search for on the list in order to put my
2 hands on it?
3
A. One idea that comes to mind is the word
4 "curriculum," but I'm not sure that that would even
5 yield results because I don't know the exact title.
6
Q. How many curricular guides did you look at in
7 order to generate Exhibit 23?
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]8 A. Certainly more than two.
9 Q. Would those be separate documents on the
10 reliance list?
11 A. I believe so.
12 Q. So you looked at bulletins, The Means Report
13 and curricular guides. Anything else?
14 A. In essence, that's what I looked at.
15 Q. The reliance list is 180 pages long and it
16 contains literally thousands of documents. Would you
17 be able to identify the reference numbers for the
18 textbooks on Exhibit 23 in less than five minutes?
19
A. I believe, if we do a search by date, that's
20 possible, but I believe it would take more than five
21 minutes.
22
Q. How about the bulletins, could you find those
23 in less than five minutes?
24 A. No.
25 Q. How about The Means Report, could you find
196
1 that in less than five minutes?
2
A. I don't know the date, so I wouldn't be able
3 to find it in less than five minutes.
4
Q. How about the curricular guides, could you
5 find those in less than five minutes?
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]6 A. I don't think so.
7 Q. All right. Well, then help me understand
8 what information was contained in the bulletins, Means
9 Report or curricular guides that helped you establish
10 that the books you have listed in Exhibit 23 are in
11 fact the books that Juanita Thurston used when she was
12 in school in Pompano.
13
A. They contain information such as a list of
14 textbooks that are approved -- actually selected for
15 use in Florida schools. So I found that information
16 both in The Means Report and the other two types of
17 documents -- or publications, I should say.
18
Q. Okay. I believe we touched upon that at your
19 last deposition insofar as schools -- I'm sorry --
20 books approved for use in schools in Florida.
21
But what I'm interested in knowing is what,
22 if anything, was contained in the bulletins, Means
23 Report or curricular guides that help you establish
24 that the books you have listed in Exhibit 23 were in
25 fact the books that were used at Juanita Thurston's
197
1 school in Pompano Beach?
2 MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
3 A. In those three sets of materials, I found
4 specific information stating that a particular book
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]5 was being used in Florida at a particular time.
6 BY MR. GARCIA:
7
Q. And I understand that answer, but was there
8 anything else beyond that that helped you confirm that
9 these were in fact the books that were being used at
10 Juanita Thurston's school in Pompano Beach?
11
A. In essence, those were the documents that I
12 used, which are official publications.
13
Q. Sure. I understand what you're saying, but I
14 want you to listen to my question and answer my
15 question.
16
Were you able to confirm by looking at either
17 the bulletins, Means Report and/or curricular guides
18 that these books were in fact used at Juanita
19 Thurston's school in Pompano Beach?
20 MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
21 A. They were used in all Florida schools.
22 BY MR. GARCIA:
23
Q. Did you find anything to confirm that they
24 were used at Juanita Thurston's school in Pompano
25 Beach?
198
1
2
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. I found that they were selected for use in
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]3 all Florida schools. Since that school is in the
4 Florida system, that's the connection that I
5 established.
6 BY MR. GARCIA:
7
Q. Right. Well, did you find any invoices that
8 they were actually purchased by the Broward County
9 School Board for use at the school in Pompano that
10 Juanita Thurston attended?
11 A. I did not find a document of that sort.
12 Q. Did you speak to anybody at the various South
13 Florida museums that you visited who confirmed that
14 these books on Exhibit 23 were actually used at the
15 school Juanita Thurston attended in Pompano?
16 A. No.
17 Q. So the list that you looked at or the lists
18 that you looked at basically told you that the books
19 on Exhibit 23 were approved for use in the public
20 school system in Florida at the relevant times?
21 A. Correct.
22 Q. But do you know if they were in fact used by
23 the school Juanita attended in Pompano at the relevant
24 times?
25
A. These were the books that had to be used
199
1 according to law.
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]2
Q. Right. I understand that answer. But do you
3 know if they were in fact used at the school that
4 Juanita Thurston attended in Pompano at the relevant
5 times?
6
7
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. Yes.
8 BY MR. GARCIA:
9
Q. How do you know that they were in fact used
10 by the school that Juanita attended in Pompano at the
11 relevant times?
12
A. Because, according to law, they could not use
13 any other textbook other than these. These were the
14 ones that were selected by the state authorities. And
15 I have no information whatsoever that any other
16 textbooks were used.
17
Q. Have you ever spoken with anyone who attended
18 school at the time that Juanita attended school in
19 Pompano to confirm that these books were actually
20 used?
21 A. I have not.
22 Q. Have you reviewed each of the textbooks
23 listed in Exhibit 23?
24 A. Yes, I have.
25 Q. Is it your opinion that each of the books
200
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]1 listed in Exhibit 23 address the health consequences
2 of smoking cigarettes?
3
A. My answer is that they touched upon the
4 subject, and I believe it was most of them. I think
5 it was all, but I would feel safer saying that most of
6 them did -- that particular issue.
7
Q. Is it your opinion that these books also
8 discussed the fact that smoking cigarettes was a bad
9 habit?
10
A. I recall touching upon the subject that they
11 were habit-forming, yes.
12
Q. Is it your opinion that these books discussed
13 the fact that it was difficult to quit smoking?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. So these are all books that you looked at,
16 right?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. So can you tell me, starting with the first
19 book, "Health Stories and Practice," where I will find
20 information to support your opinions by page number or
21 chapter number?
22
A. I don't have that information with me. These
23 books had indices. That may be a way of getting at
24 that information quickly.
25
Q. As we sit here, you can't tell me what page
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]201
1 number you looked at in order to confirm that these
2 books addressed the topic of awareness of health
3 consequences of smoking. Is that right?
4
5
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. I can tell you that they addressed the issue.
6 I cannot pinpoint page numbers. In some cases, it was
7 entire chapters that dealt with that.
8 BY MR. GARCIA:
9
Q. All right. Well, did you review those pages
10 and chapters in order to generate this list which
11 we've marked as Exhibit 23?
12
A. The process was that I identified the books
13 and then I went to the books.
14
Q. Right. When you went to the books, did you
15 go to the specific chapters and pages to confirm that
16 these books covered the health consequences of
17 smoking?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. In doing so, did you make notes about what
20 page numbers that topic appeared in?
21
A. Notes? I may have marked the pages with a
22 checkmark.
23 Q. On the physical books themselves?
24 A. No. Copies -- photocopies.
25 Q. Where are those photocopies that you
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]202
1 checkmarked?
2 A. They're at home.
3 Q. Do you intend to rely on the books that
4 you've listed in Exhibit 23 when you testify in the
5 trial of this case?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. Do you intend to show the jury the specific
8 page numbers that you checked off to discuss the
9 subject of the health consequences of cigarette
10 smoking?
11 A. I anticipate doing that.
12 Q. But as we sit here right now, can you tell me
13 what the page numbers are?
14 MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
15 A. I don't have that information with me.
16 BY MR. GARCIA:
17
Q. Okay. Is the reason that you don't have it
18 with you because that stuff is at your house?
19 A. It's at my house, yes.
20 Q. You also mentioned, since we last met, you
21 looked at newspapers. Did I hear you correctly?
22 A. Correct.
23 Q. Did you bring with you the newspapers that
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]24 you reviewed?
25
A. I did not bring the actual newspapers. I
203
1 have notes.
2 Q. Did you bring the notes with you?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. Let's take a look at those, please. Thank
5 you. Are these notes that you prepared since we last
6 met?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. Are these notes for me to use here for this
9 deposition?
10
11
12
13
14
15
A. Yes.
MR. GARCIA: So we'll mark your notes as
Composite Exhibit 24. It's 16 pages.
(Plaintiff's Exhibit 24 was marked for
identification.)
MR. KEEHFUS: So the record is clear,
16 you've been provided with copies of the
17 actual articles on a disk you should have
18 received Monday of this week.
19 BY MR. GARCIA:
20
Q. I received a disk that has a file called
21 "newspaper articles, PDF," and it consists of 17
22 pages. Are you familiar with that file?
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]23 A. Not as a file, no. I'd have to see it.
24 Q. Okay. I'll show it to you. But getting back
25 to your notes here for a minute, Exhibit 24, are these
204
1 your notes?
2 A. Yes, they're my notes.
3 Q. You prepared them -- you typed these notes up
4 yourself?
5
A. Some of them are -- if I can explain how this
6 came together -- I had copies of the entire articles
7 in this form as Word documents. I read them and I
8 made notes, but I also used segments that were already
9 there and I put them in quotation marks.
10
Q. My original question was: Is Exhibit 24 a
11 document that you yourself created?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. You maybe cut and pasted information from the
14 articles and dropped them into this document?
15 A. That's correct.
16 Q. Okay. What did you do in order to get the
17 actual articles referenced in this Exhibit 24?
18 A. By actual articles, what do you mean, sir?
19 Q. Like, for example, on page one of Exhibit 24,
20 there's an article from the Palm Beach Post that is
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]21 referenced. So what did you do in order to find this
22 Palm Beach Post article?
23
A. The Palm Beach Post article is collected
24 online. I did a search and the ones that appeared
25 that I found most relevant are the ones that are here.
205
1 It was through an online search.
2 Q. Did you do that online search yourself?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. Did you find each and every one of the
5 articles referenced in Exhibit 24 on your own?
6 A. Meaning the ones that appear here?
7 Q. Yes, this entire Exhibit 24?
8 A. Yes, it was all my work.
9 Q. In other words, these weren't articles that
10 were spoon-fed to you by someone else, correct?
11 A. These are documents that I found myself.
12 Q. So I think what your lawyer was telling me is
13 that the actual articles referenced in this document
14 should be in this disk that I was provided on Monday?
15 A. That's my understanding.
16 Q. How many articles are here?
17 A. Around 22.
18 Q. So I should have the 22 articles on this
19 disk, right? Is that your understanding?
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]20
21
A. I'm not sure of that.
MR. KEEHFUS: Mariano, I think they're
22 either there or they're on the original set
23 of disks. We can take a look and make sure,
24 but I know they've been provided with all of
25 these articles.
206
1
MR. GARCIA: Okay.
2 BY MR. GARCIA:
3
Q. So with regard to these articles, the
4 earliest of which appears to be from the year 1982,
5 help me understand what role they played in helping
6 you formulate your opinion in this case.
7
A. These are newspapers that reached the Delray
8 community. One in particular, the Palm Beach Post,
9 there's plenty of evidence, based on the depositions,
10 that that was a newspaper that was inside of
11 Ms. Thurston's home that she read and that she
12 subscribed to.
13
There are other newspapers that would have
14 reached -- that are reaching that media market, if you
15 will, and there are other newspapers from Miami, for
16 example, that provide information relevant to
17 awareness about smoking and health and about cessation
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]18 in that part of Florida.
19
Q. Are the newspaper articles contained in
20 Exhibit 24 the only newspaper articles that you intend
21 to rely upon in the trial of this case?
22 A. No.
23 Q. I'd like to know if you have an opinion about
24 newspaper articles specific to this case for the
25 timeframe of the 1950s.
207
1 MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
2 A. I haven't made that determination yet. I
3 know I looked at papers from that time.
4 BY MR. GARCIA:
5
Q. Do you expect to provide opinions in the
6 trial of this case that are based upon newspaper
7 articles published in the 1950s?
8 A. Yes, I expect to do that.
9 Q. As you sit here, have you identified which
10 newspaper articles you intend to rely upon with regard
11 to this specific case?
12 A. Not specifically, no.
13 Q. When do you expect to do that?
14 A. I expect to do that closer to the time of
15 trial.
16
Q. Do you intend to provide opinions in the
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]17 trial of this case based upon newspaper articles that
18 were published in the 1960s?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Which articles do you intend to rely upon?
21 A. At this point, I can't give you specific
22 titles of articles.
23 Q. When will you be in a position to do that?
24 A. Again, closer to trial date.
25 Q. Do you believe that there are newspaper
208
1 articles that were published in the 1950s or 1960s
2 that would be relevant to this specific case that
3 we're here on today?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. But what you're telling me is you haven't had
6 a chance to identify them yet, correct?
7
8
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. I haven't made a determination as to which
9 ones I'll be using, but I've looked at the body of
10 articles.
11 BY MR. GARCIA:
12
Q. Would any of the articles that you intend to
13 rely upon, which were published in the 1950s or 1960s,
14 be contained in the 180-page reliance list?
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]15 A. Yes.
16 Q. As you sit here right now, can you tell me
17 what articles that were published in the 1950s or
18 1960s that you would rely upon for the opinions on
19 this specific case?
20
21
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. I rely upon having read them. In terms of
22 specifics as to which ones I will use directly, I have
23 not made that determination.
24 BY MR. GARCIA:
25
Q. How long would it take you to determine which
209
1 specific articles would, in your opinion, be relevant
2 to this specific case that we're here on?
3
MR. KEEHFUS: Are you talking about
4 articles he's relying on or articles he will
5 present at trial to the jury?
6
MR. GARCIA: Articles that he intends to
7 present at trial in this case -- in this
8 specific case.
9
THE WITNESS: That would be a matter of
10 hours, and, again, that would happen closer
11 to trial date.
12 BY MR. GARCIA:
13
Q. All right. Now, aside from newspaper
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]14 articles -- when I said articles, that's what I
15 meant -- we were discussing newspaper articles. You
16 also mentioned articles in a more general sense. Were
17 you referring to magazine articles?
18
19
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. I'd have to know what particular statement
20 you're referring to.
21 BY MR. GARCIA:
22
Q. When we got started in this deposition and I
23 asked you what you had done, you told me that you
24 looked at newspaper articles, you told me that you
25 were provided with additional depositions, you told me
210
1 that you looked at articles and you told me that you
2 looked at textbooks.
3
So far, we've covered the textbooks on
4 Exhibit 23 and now we've covered newspaper articles,
5 at least the ones listed on Exhibit 24. So I'm asking
6 you about articles in the sense that you mentioned
7 when we got started.
8
A. I believe I was referring to newspaper
9 articles in particular.
10
Q. Okay. So are there any magazine articles
11 that you relied upon for your opinions on this
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]12 specific case or what you intend to rely upon at the
13 trial of this case?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. What articles?
16 A. Those articles are included on this list, the
17 reliance list. And, again, I have not made a specific
18 determination as to which article I intend to use.
19
Q. As you sit here right now, are you able to
20 look at this reliance list that I was provided and
21 tell me which ones you would rely upon at the trial of
22 the case?
23
24
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. In terms of relying, I plan to rely on all of
25 them.
211
1 BY MR. GARCIA:
2
Q. But have you determined which ones are
3 applicable to this specific case of Juanita Thurston?
4
5
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. I believe that they're all applicable.
6 BY MR. GARCIA:
7 Q. Which ones do you intend to show to the jury?
8 A. That determination I have not made yet.
9 Q. What magazines are the articles contained in?
10 A. That includes magazines such as Newsweek,
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]11 Time, Ebony, Reader's Digest. Those are a few, but
12 there are others of course.
13
Q. Is it your opinion that Newsweek magazine was
14 a magazine that was -- that Juanita Thurston read?
15
A. According to one of the depositions -- I
16 would have to look at it carefully again -- but my
17 recollection is that one of the depositions mentioned
18 that particular news magazine by name.
19 Q. Would the same hold true for Time magazine?
20 A. I don't recall that.
21 Q. Would the same hold true for Ebony magazine?
22 A. I recall seeing testimony to the effect that
23 was one of the magazines, yes.
24 Q. Would the same hold true for Reader's Digest?
25 A. I don't remember that. I don't think so.
212
1 That's based on the depositions.
2
Q. The disk that I was provided contains a
3 number of PDF files of Ebony and Jet magazines. Are
4 you aware of that?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. Are these PDF files of magazines that you
7 obtained?
8
A. Yes.
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]9
Q. Meaning that you went somewhere and you did
10 the research yourself and found these magazines?
11 A. Which magazines are you referring to?
12 Q. Ebony and Jet.
13 A. These were materials that I received that I
14 requested and received from History Works.
15 Q. Is that the company in Chicago?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. Why did you request these Ebony and Jet
18 magazines?
19
A. I believe they would be pertinent for this
20 case.
21 Q. Why?
22 A. In part, because of the testimony that
23 mentioned Ebony magazine as one of the ones in Juanita
24 Thurston's home.
25
Q. What information is contained in these Jet
213
1 and Ebony articles that were provided to me that help
2 form a foundation for your opinions?
3
A. There are specific articles on the subject of
4 health, which provide advice as to what to do and not
5 to do to be healthy. Several mention the fact that
6 smoking is harmful.
7
There are some articles on media
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]8 personalities that died of cancer and there's a
9 relationship established. The example of Nat King
10 Cole comes to be mind -- the relationship between the
11 smoking and the death.
12
Q. The disk that I was provided only contains
13 magazines articles from Ebony and Jet. Does the
14 reliance list contain the articles from Newsweek
15 magazine or Time magazine?
16 A. It contains Newsweek and Time, yes.
17 Q. Does the reliance list contain the Newsweek
18 or Time articles that are relevant to this specific
19 case?
20 A. Yes, they're relevant.
21 Q. Are there any other articles that you
22 contemplate showing to the jury in this case that are
23 not contained in either Ebony, Jet, Newsweek, Time or
24 perhaps Reader's Digest?
25
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
214
1
A. I have not made that determination. It's
2 possible that I will use others. Life, for example.
3 BY MR. GARCIA:
4
Q. Are the Life magazine articles that you would
5 rely upon contained in the 180-page reliance list?
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]6 A. Yes.
7 Q. What additional depositions did you review
8 since we last met on August 15th of this year?
9
A. If I may look at my documents? I looked at
10 Charles Alvin Osborne, Willie Harden, Oscar Harden,
11 Angeline Marshall, Duriel Odom, Ahmad Hayes. Those
12 are the ones.
13
Q. What document were you just looking at in
14 order to refresh your recollection?
15
A. These are notes that I took from the reading
16 of those depositions.
17
Q. May I see that, please? These are notes that
18 you created?
19
20
21
22
23
A. Yes.
MR. GARCIA: We'll mark this three-page
document as Exhibit 25.
(Plaintiff's Exhibit 25 was marked for
identification.)
24 BY MR. GARCIA:
25
Q. What other documents did you bring with you
215
1 today?
2
A. Let's see. I have two or three more
3 documents. I have this one with me.
4
MR. GARCIA: We'll mark this next
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]5
document that you handed to me as Exhibit 26.
6
7
(Plaintiff's Exhibit 26 was marked for
identification.)
8 BY MR. GARCIA:
9 Q. What is it?
10 A. This is a chart that looks at newspapers --
11 Palm Beach Post and Fort Lauderdale Daily News -- for
12 specific years. This is a sampling, and the list
13 includes a variety of categories of items and services
14 that were advertised in these publications.
15 Q. Is this something that you created?
16 A. No.
17 Q. Where did you get it?
18 A. This is something that I requested a research
19 assistant to do to -- look at the papers and the dates
20 and count the number of ads in different categories.
21
Q. Why did you ask your research assistant to do
22 this?
23
A. I believe that, had I done it, it would've
24 been too time-consuming, and I trusted the judgment of
25 the research assistant to do a good job.
216
1
Q. That makes sense. But what was the purpose
2 of creating this document?
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]3
A. To have a sense about the extent of tobacco
4 advertising within a broader body of information on
5 advertising in general and to be able to compare
6 different categories as far as number of ads
7 appearing.
8
Q. What conclusion, if any, did you reach based
9 upon the review of the different ads that appeared in
10 newspapers?
11
A. The conclusion is that tobacco advertising
12 was minimal compared to so many other categories. For
13 example, if you look at the first column -- Palm Beach
14 Post 1958 -- there were 38 ads for automobiles and
15 there was one for tobacco products. That's just an
16 example.
17
Q. Do you intend to rely upon Exhibit 26 when
18 testifying in the trial of this case?
19 A. That is possible.
20 Q. How would you use this document?
21 MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
22
A. If I were to use it, I would use it perhaps
23 in my presentation and share this information in
24 court.
25 BY MR. GARCIA:
217
1
Q. For what purpose?
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]2
A. It gives a view of the prevalence of tobacco
3 advertising as compared to advertising of a universe
4 of other products and services.
5
Q. Well, how is that important for the purpose
6 of providing your opinions in this case?
7
A. In previous court cases, the issue of
8 advertising has come up, so this is information that I
9 may find relevant either in my presentation or if the
10 topic were to come up.
11
Q. How has it come up in the past that you felt
12 the need to create Exhibit 26?
13
14
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. I don't recall specifically when and where
15 and who may have said that, but I do recall the topic
16 of advertising having come up in previous cases, yes.
17 BY MR. GARCIA:
18
Q. So that I understand Exhibit 26 when I'm
19 reading it, if I look at the column 1958, what does
20 1/8-1/14 mean?
21
A. Those are the dates included that week from
22 January 8th to January 14th of 1958.
23
Q. Would that have been one newspaper that was
24 published that ran for that period of days or would it
25 have been a newspaper published on each day during
218
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]1 that time period of days?
2 A. Each day.
3 Q. So your research associate looked at each
4 newspaper that was published on each day between
5 January 8th of 1958 and January 14th of 1958 in order
6 to arrive at the number of automobile ads versus
7 tobacco ads for that time period?
8
A. That's correct. The person looked at every
9 day during that week.
10
Q. How were these specific periods arrived at,
11 for example, 1960, from February 22nd to
12 February 28th?
13 A. That one in particular?
14 Q. Yes.
15 A. What I did was, in order to have this as
16 unbiased as possible, I used a randomizer that
17 provided dates. And this is something that I use in a
18 computer program -- well, not a computer program -- a
19 web page that provides random numbers. That's how I
20 arrived at these selections.
21
Q. What website did you use to generate random
22 numbers?
23
A. I don't remember the exact name now, but I
24 looked for several of them and this is the one that
25 seemed most useful. It just generates the numbers,
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]219
1 but I don't remember the page.
2 Q. When did you create Exhibit 26?
3 A. I did not create this exhibit.
4 Q. Right, but when was it created?
5 A. This was between the previous deposition and
6 today.
7
Q. Is this the very first time that you have
8 created or that someone created such a document for
9 you?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. Do you have in your possession, either here
12 or at home, the newspapers that are the foundation for
13 the figures on this list?
14
A. Not the newspapers, no. Some of them would
15 be found in the reliance list.
16 Q. Which ones?
17 A. I can't tell you for sure without
18 cross-checking.
19 Q. What other documents did you bring with you?
20 A. This is the amended notice of the duces
21 tecum.
22 Q. Is that for today?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. What else?
25 A. And I have a copy of my deposition from the
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]220
1 Larkin case.
2 Q. Why did you bring that?
3 A. If I recall correctly, that's something that
4 you requested last time.
5
Q. Right. That was on number eight of your
6 duces tecum for the original deposition.
7
So what you're telling me is that this is the
8 only deposition in your possession, custody or control
9 regarding prior testimony. Correct?

MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. I recall that the request was for depositions
12 or court testimony within the last two years, so
13 that's the one that I have for that period.
14

18
MR. GARCIA: We'll mark it as Exhibit 27.
Let's take a short recess.
(Plaintiff's Exhibit 27 was marked for
identification.)
(Brief recess.)
19 BY MR. GARCIA:
20
Q. Going back to the textbooks for a moment, did
21 you determine whether the health consequences of
22 smoking was covered as part of the curriculum of study
23 during the time that Juanita Thurston attended school
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]24 in Pompano Beach?
25
A. Yes, I determined that.
221
1 Q. How did you determine that?
2 A. One way was by looking at the textbooks and
3 their contents on that subject. And another way was
4 by looking at the various bulletins and perhaps even
5 some legislation on that subject.
6
Q. Help me understand how you determined that
7 the health consequences of smoking is something that
8 was covered in the curriculum of the school that
9 Juanita Thurston attended during the relevant times.
10
A. There are specific publications -- and I
11 don't have the title with me -- specific publications
12 that are guidebooks or guidelines or prescriptions for
13 the teaching of health in Florida. That's one way.
14 The other way is by looking at the textbooks that
15 included that.
16
Q. Well, how do you know that Juanita Thurston
17 was actually taught about the health consequences of
18 smoking?
19
A. I know that because it was part of the
20 curriculum. It was the law in Florida. The books
21 that were selected for use included that. I know for
22 a fact that in that school that she attended, Blanche
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]23 Ely School, that there was a teacher specifically
24 teaching health courses, and there were other courses
25 where that would have come up, such as biology.
222
1
All of those factors lead me to believe that
2 she in fact was exposed in school to that kind of
3 instruction.
4
Q. Who was the teacher at Juanita Thurston's
5 school in Pompano who taught her about the health
6 consequences of smoking?
7
8
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. I don't remember the name. That's something
9 that was included in materials that I gave you in the
10 previous deposition.
11 BY MR. GARCIA:
12 Q. You mean along with her transcripts?
13 A. There were documents from the Palm Beach
14 School System that included lists of teachers and what
15 courses they taught.
16
Q. Was Juanita's school in Pompano part of the
17 Palm Beach County School System?
18 A. No. I meant Broward County.
19 Q. Well, can you say with any degree of
20 probability that Juanita would have seen the textbook
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]21 material that discussed the health consequences of
22 smoking?
23 MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
24 A. Could you repeat the question, please?
25 BY MR. GARCIA:
223
1
Q. Sure. Can you say with any degree of
2 probability that Juanita Thurston would have seen the
3 material concerning the health consequences of smoking
4 which is contained in the books you've listed in
5 Exhibit 23?
6
7
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. I can say that these were the books selected
8 by the state for use in all schools. This was a state
9 school or a school within the state. These were the
10 books that were supposed to be used and I have no
11 reason to believe that she was not exposed to them.
12
Actually, these were the books that were
13 used. Again, the courses were taught. And not only
14 that, there were other possibilities of information
15 that were not just in the textbooks having reached
16 her.
17 BY MR. GARCIA:
18
Q. Right. I'm just -- when you say that, you're
19 referring to the other materials that we've discussed,
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]20 like newspaper articles, magazine articles, et cetera,
21 right?
22
A. I'm referring to a host of other classroom
23 activities, for example, that were prescribed in the
24 curriculum.
25
Q. Like what?
224
1
A. I don't recall specifics, but these textbooks
2 had -- not the textbooks -- the guidelines had
3 examples of activities to be carried out in the
4 classroom as they pertained to health, and,
5 particularly, about the harmful effects that smoking
6 could cause.
7 Q. What activities?
8 A. I don't recall one in particular. I could
9 give you sort of a general sense of what these
10 activities were.
11 Q. Okay.
12 A. Those would've been, for example -- again,
13 I'm talking about a broad category without being able
14 to connect all of them directly -- but classroom
15 demonstrations, for example, experiments.
16 Q. What sort of experiments?
17 A. Because I'm not sure -- I would have to go
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]18 back to the guidelines and read them again and see
19 which ones they were. I just gave you a very general
20 question of the types -- I'm sorry -- general answer
21 to the types of activities that are possible. But in
22 order to give you a good answer, I would have to look
23 at the materials again.
24
Q. Fair enough. But you believe that, at the
25 relevant times, there would've been an experiment
225
1 activity performed at Juanita's school in Pompano that
2 would've illustrated the health effects of smoking?
3
A. I used the term "experiments" to give an
4 example of the general category of activities. In
5 order for me to be able to give you a more specific
6 answer, I would need to go back to some of those
7 materials.
8 Q. What did you mean when you said experiments?
9 A. I meant experiments that are done in the
10 classroom. Again, this is part of a broad category of
11 activities outside of the textbook, which I've seen in
12 this case and other cases. I can't give you a
13 specific answer unless I go back to those materials
14 and read them again.
15
Q. Do you intend to talk to the jury at the
16 trial of this case regarding these other activities,
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]17 including experiments, with specific examples?
18 A. That's a possibility.
19 Q. But as you sit here right now, you can't tell
20 me specifically what activities or experiments.
21 Correct?
22 A. Correct.
23 Q. All right. Is it your opinion that Juanita
24 Thurston knew in the 1950s that cigarette smoking
25 caused cancer?
226
1 MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
2 A. I can tell you that in the 1950s she was
3 aware of the negative health consequences of smoking
4 and the fact that it was difficult to quit.
5 BY MR. GARCIA:
6
Q. Are you prepared to say that she knew that
7 smoking cigarettes caused cancer in the 1950s?
8 A. Could you repeat the question?
9 Q. Sure. Are you prepared to say that in the
10 1950s Juanita Thurston knew that smoking cigarettes
11 caused cancer?
12
A. I'm ready to say that during the 1950s
13 information linking smoking and cancer was widely
14 available and that information of that sort reached
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]15 her community and reached her.
16
Beyond that, there's a source that I think is
17 important to keep in mind, and that is the oral
18 tradition which is very strong in the African-American
19 community, which is another way of disseminating
20 information about health and other subjects in her
21 community. There's plenty of evidence of that kind of
22 communication.
23
Q. Give me an example of the plenty of evidence
24 that you're referring to.
25
A. Well, I've looked at the literature on the
227
1 oral tradition and all authors agree that the oral
2 tradition is very important and central as a way of
3 conveying information within the African-American
4 community. This is very, very well established.
5
So it's important to keep in mind that the
6 information reached the community in the traditional
7 forms such as publications, efforts by organizations,
8 such as the American Cancer Society, to distribute
9 leaflets, newscasts.
10
But beyond that, there's the element of the
11 strong oral tradition in the African-American
12 community about which much has been written, including
13 the area of health information being communicated that
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]14 way.
15
Q. Well, what was the oral tradition of the
16 African-American community in the 1950s relative to
17 the health consequences of smoking?
18
19
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. The oral tradition was very much present. It
20 manifested itself through a variety of means, whether
21 it be sermons that were being preached, such in the
22 churches at Juanita Thurston and her family attended,
23 whether it be in individuals engaging in
24 communication. And part of that information would've
25 been health related, I believe.
228
1
Q. In the 1950s, what church sermons were given
2 at Juanita's church regarding the health consequences
3 of smoking?
4
A. I don't have specific information on sermons
5 on that subject.
6 Q. For any time period?
7 A. On the content of the sermons, no. What I
8 can tell you is that information about health and
9 information about smoking and health is something
10 that, according to the literature on the oral
11 tradition, is a kind of information that would've been
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]12 espoused in the context of the church.
13
Q. Are you aware of any such sermon regarding
14 the health consequences of smoking?
15
A. I don't have information about any sermon on
16 any topic. Of course, the sermons took place. I
17 don't know what the content was.
18
Q. You mentioned that Juanita would have
19 received information at an early age that cigarette
20 smoking was a bad habit and that it was difficult to
21 quit, so I'd like to know if the documents that you
22 have listed in Exhibit 23 specifically address that.
23 A. May I take a look?
24 Q. Yes.
25 A. The items included here, which are health
229
1 textbooks, these items cover the topic of smoking and
2 health and information in terms of the negative health
3 consequences, as well as the fact that it would've
4 been hard to quit.
5 Q. Every one of those?
6 A. I believe all of them, but I would more
7 safely say most of them. I would have to review them
8 to give you a certain answer as to whether all of them
9 cover that. My belief at this point is that they all
10 covered it. That's my belief and that's the best
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]11 answer I can give you.
12
Q. Since we last met, have you yourself
13 published any articles regarding the public awareness
14 of the health consequences of smoking?
15 A. No.
16 Q. Since we last met, how much time have you
17 devoted to the case involving Juanita Thurston?
18
A. I can't give you a specific answer in terms
19 of hours.
20
Q. Have you generated a bill and sent a bill to
21 your client for the work you've done so far, since
22 August 15th until now?
23
A. I vaguely recall that I produced a new
24 invoice, but I recall that it included hours up to the
25 date of the deposition. I don't believe I have sent
230
1 one since then. I may be wrong, but it's my
2 recollection that no such document has been prepared
3 yet.
4
Q. Do you intend to bill for your time since the
5 last time we met?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. Did you bring anything else with you that we
8 haven't identified?
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]9 A. That's all.
10 Q. So when we last met, you provided me with
11 some opinions which you characterized as preliminary
12 in nature. So I wonder if you have reached a point
13 now where you have reached final opinions in this
14 case.
15
16
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. Yes, I have.
17 BY MR. GARCIA:
18
Q. So, what are your final opinions in this
19 case?
20
A. My final opinions are that, from an early
21 age, Ms. Juanita Thurston was exposed to and received
22 information from a variety of means, including the
23 oral tradition, that smoking was a bad habit, that it
24 was harmful, that it could lead to death and also
25 information in terms of the habit-forming qualities of
231
1 nicotine and tobacco and that that made tobacco hard
2 to quit.
3 Q. Anything else?
4 A. Those are the main conclusions.
5 Q. Doctor, since you've been doing this type of
6 work for Jones Day, have your opinions in the other
7 cases that you've been retained to testify in been
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]8 essentially the same?
9
10
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. They have been essentially the same. Of
11 course, keeping in mind that it's different
12 individuals, different places and different time
13 periods. But it's the same, yes -- essentially the
14 same.
15 BY MR. GARCIA:
16
Q. All right. Those opinions are essentially
17 the same, notwithstanding the fact that you're dealing
18 with different individuals and different timeframes,
19 et cetera, correct?
20
A. If I may expand with my answer? It is very
21 clear over the years of research that I've carried out
22 that information about the health consequences of
23 smoking, as well as the addictive nature of smoking,
24 that that information reached the population of the
25 United States regardless of where they were. It's
232
1 very massive information, again, coming from a large
2 variety of sources, whether it's the church, whether
3 it's the government, whether it's the New York Times,
4 whether it's the local paper, TV, campaigns by health
5 organizations. It is very evident that that type of
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]6 information reached the public.
7
Q. You just described various sources for what
8 you characterize as massive information. So my
9 question is: Did that include information from the
10 cigarette companies themselves?
11 A. Information on what?
12 Q. The health consequences of smoking.
13 A. There was some information. It was very,
14 very, very minimal, but there was some instances of
15 that in newspapers, for example.
16
But I would like to reiterate the fact that
17 the overwhelming message was that it was harmful and
18 that there was some instances in which the media
19 included other perspectives, such as tobacco
20 companies.
21
Now I should add something, and that is -- I
22 did not consider -- when I looked at the universe of
23 materials, I kept a very clear eye on the context, the
24 amount and who was providing that information.
25
Q. We previously discussed the historical
233
1 method. So, in that context, do you agree with me
2 that the more information that you're able to gather,
3 the better the quality of your research will be?
4
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]5
A. I don't necessarily agree with that.
6 BY MR. GARCIA:
7
Q. Well, since you were tasked with analyzing
8 public awareness of the health consequences of
9 smoking, did you attempt to obtain information that
10 was disseminated to the public by the cigarette
11 companies themselves?
12
A. I was looking at the sources of information
13 and I looked at everything. If it included
14 information from the tobacco companies, such as quotes
15 by a reporter, that was part of what I looked at, yes.
16
Q. How would you characterize the information
17 that was disseminated by the cigarette companies
18 concerning the health consequences of smoking?
19
20
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. I don't agree with the characterization of it
21 as dissemination by the tobacco companies. I'm
22 referring to articles or basically articles that
23 included quotations from tobacco representatives. So
24 it's not accurate to say that the tobacco company
25 disseminated that information.
234
1 BY MR. GARCIA:
2
Q. Okay. I don't want to split hairs on the
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]3 definition of what dissemination means. I take it to
4 mean anything that is communicated from the tobacco
5 companies from whatever source, be it an interview of
6 a cigarette company representative or literature that
7 they put out regarding the health consequences of
8 smoking.
9
So with that in mind, how would you
10 characterize the information that was disseminated by
11 the cigarette companies regarding the health
12 consequences of smoking?
13
14
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. I do not agree with your premise that
15 information, say, that appears in an article in the
16 Palm Beach Post is a form of dissemination by the
17 tobacco companies. I don't agree with that.
18
Many times -- or at least sometimes --
19 reporters seek out various perspectives and may
20 interview a tobacco executive, for example. I don't
21 see that as dissemination of information by the
22 tobacco companies.
23
Q. Okay. What do you see as dissemination of
24 information by the cigarette companies?
25
A. I did not find that in the media.
235
1
Q. Did you look for it?
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]2
A. As I was looking, I was looking for every
3 piece of information. I don't recall that -- the only
4 possible exception is the Frank Statement that
5 appeared in some newspapers in the country. I would
6 characterize that example as a message from tobacco
7 companies to the public, but that's an exception.
8 Q. Why do you describe it as an exception?
9 A. Because I don't recall any other
10 communication, direct communication, from tobacco
11 companies to the public of that sort through the mass
12 media.
13 Q. Right. What is The Frank Statement?
14 A. The Frank Statement was published in 1954 and
15 it was a statement, if I recall correctly, from
16 tobacco companies in terms of -- one of the things I
17 remember, if I recall correctly, was the notion that
18 research had to be done or more research had to be
19 done. I'm not 100 percent sure.
20 Q. Where research had to be done on what?
21 A. On tobacco and health. Again, I would like
22 to read it again -- the document -- to able to give
23 you a good answer. I'm just trying to be helpful in
24 terms of sharing a recollection.
25
Q. Okay. Do you know why it was called The
236
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]1 Frank Statement?
2
3
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. I don't know specifically.
4 BY MR. GARCIA:
5
Q. Did you find The Frank Statement to be
6 consistent with the information regarding the health
7 consequences of smoking that was disseminated to the
8 public by other sources in the time period of 1954?
9
A. I would have to read the document again to be
10 able to answer that.
11
Q. All right. In 1954, did the cigarette
12 companies agree with other sources of information that
13 were -- I'm sorry -- other sources that were
14 disseminating information about the health
15 consequences of smoking?
16
17
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. I recall that there was some agreement, yes.
18 BY MR. GARCIA:
19
Q. In 1954, did cigarette companies agree that
20 nicotine was addictive?
21
22
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. I don't recall that specifically.
23 BY MR. GARCIA:
24
Q. In 1954, did cigarette companies agree that
25 cigarette smoking was a bad habit that was difficult
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]237
1 to quit?
2
3
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. I don't remember seeing that.
4 BY MR. GARCIA:
5
Q. Since the last time that we met on
6 August 15th, have you communicated with any cigarette
7 company, employees or representatives as part of your
8 work in this case?
9 A. No, I have never done that.
10 Q. And you haven't done that for any case,
11 correct?
12
13
A. That's correct.
MR. GARCIA: I believe that's all I have.
14 What I'd like to get, somehow, are the
15 reference numbers that are in the reliance
16 list for the books that you've listed in
17 Exhibit 23 -- and the bulletins and the Means
18 Reports and the curricular guides and the
19 newspaper or magazine articles that are in
20 here that you intend to -- that we have
21 reviewed and that you intend to rely upon in
22 the trial of this case.
23
MR. KEEHFUS: We'll take that under
24 advisement and deal with it at the
25 appropriate time.
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]238
1
MR. GARCIA: Well, I'm just trying to --
2 I hope you can appreciate that I don't want
3 to take up any more of your time by having
4 you go through these 180 pages to tell me
5 where I might find this textbook because I
6 want to find the correct textbook. So I was
7 hoping that perhaps you can suggest an
8 efficient way to get that information to me
9 without us having to sit here for the rest of
10 the day, trying to get you to identify the
11 reference number for these materials.
12
Can you think of a way we might be able
13 to do that and not sit here for the rest of
14 the day?
15
THE WITNESS: What comes to mind is this.
16 Since these books have dates, go back to the
17 list -- the reliance list -- under those
18 particular dates that are mentioned. That's
19 one way.
20
MR. GARCIA: Here's the problem. It's
21 not my list and I'm not very good with
22 computers.

MR. KEEHFUS: Can I interrupt? Regarding
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]24 the textbooks, I think that's a fair request
25 and we will provide you with the reference
239
1
numbers for the textbooks.
2 MR. GARCIA: What about the other
3 stuff -- these bulletins, curricular guides,
4 Means Report? I'm not trying to play games.
5 I just want to save the doctor's time here.
6
MR. KEEHFUS: We will make a good faith
7 effort to go through the list and to identify
8 the reference numbers for those and get those
9 to you.
10
MR. GARCIA: Okay. With that then, we'll
11 conclude the deposition. Do you have some
12 questions?
13 MR. KEEHFUS: Just a few.
14 MR. GARCIA: Let me finish here.
15 Otherwise, I'll forget. I'll reserve the
16 right to continue it if somehow I'm not
17 provided with the reference numbers. That's
18 just for the record.

CROSS EXAMINATION
20 BY MR. KEEHFUS:
21 Q. Good morning Dr. Martinez.
22 A. Good morning.
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]23
Q. Did you have a chance to review the
24 transcript from the first day of your deposition?
25
A. Yes, I did.
240
1
Q. Was there any testimony from that first day
2 of your deposition that you found to be inaccurate or
3 incomplete?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. Can you tell me what that was?
6 A. A couple of instances -- one had to do with
7 the percentage of my income derived from my consulting
8 work for Jones Day. That's one of them, which I
9 looked back and I thought about it and it's not the
10 most accurate answer.
11 Q. Okay. What was that?
12 A. I recall in the statement in the previous
13 deposition saying that 55 percent of my income came
14 from consulting work for Jones Day. That is not
15 accurate. It would be closer to 45.
16 Q. Closer to 45 percent?
17 A. Yes, closer to 45.
18 Q. Do you have any explanation or reason for
19 that 45 percent figure?
20
A. Yes, there is. There have been some years
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]21 when my salary at the university had changed and I
22 received less than my usual salary. That, in a way,
23 distorted the proportions for a couple of years which
24 is not reflective of the reality, which is that
25 overall, with the exception of those couple of years,
241
1 more than 50 percent of my income has come from my
2 primary job.
3 Q. As a professor of history?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. Other than that, was there anything else that
6 you found to be inaccurate or where you misspoke
7 during day one of your deposition?
8
A. Yes. I recall in the line of questioning
9 having to do with how many materials I may have
10 received from the lawyers -- at first, I was very
11 tentative to give a number, but then, towards the end,
12 I think I recall having said that it may be a
13 thousand. I don't remember the exact wording. But it
14 was not something that certainly was -- it was just an
15 estimate. I recall saying about a thousand documents
16 I received from the lawyers and that's not accurate.
17 Q. Explain why that's not accurate.
18 A. I misspoke. In giving that answer, I
19 conflated documents that I had received from History
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]20 Works or fellow historians, which is not the same as
21 having received them from the lawyers. So that was
22 the essence of how I misspoke on that day.
23 Q. Do you have a more accurate number to give?
24 A. It's an estimate, but I would put it in less
25 than 100.
242
1
Q. Okay. Anything else that you found to be
2 inaccurate from day one of your deposition or
3 instances where you believe you may have misspoke
4 after you reviewed the transcript?
5
A. That's all that I remember. There may have
6 been another instance.
7
Q. You were asked a little bit earlier about
8 newspaper articles that you took notes on and that are
9 contained in Exhibit 24. Do you remember that?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. There's articles in Exhibit 24 from the Palm
12 Beach Post and from the Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel,
13 right?
14
A. Yes, and I believe there may be at least one
15 from the Miami Herald.
16
Q. Just to be clear, those aren't the only
17 newspaper articles you have read and reviewed and that
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]18 you rely upon in this case. Is that right?
19
A. That's correct. That's a tiny group that I
20 reviewed recently.
21
Q. You were asked about newspaper articles from
22 the 1950s and '60s. I want to make sure that we're
23 clear on this. Have you looked at, in your historical
24 research in this case, newspaper articles from the
25 1950s, 1960s, all the way up through the 1990s?
243
1 A. Yes, I have done plenty of that.
2 Q. Have you looked at articles that appeared in
3 a variety of newspapers?
4 A. Yes, I have.
5 Q. Are those articles that you rely upon for
6 your opinions in this case contained in the reliance
7 list that you put together for the Odom case?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. Do you rely on all of those articles for your
10 opinions that you will give in this case?
11 A. Yes, I do.
12 Q. In your opinion, are they all applicable to
13 the opinions that you would give in this case?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Now, I think you may have talked about this,
16 but have you determined which of those you will
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]17 present to the jury at trial?
18 A. I have not made that determination.
19 Q. You may present all of them at trial?
20 A. Perhaps I will not be able to present them
21 all because of the sheer volume, but all of them are
22 susceptible to being selected for presentation.
23
Q. Are all of them relevant to your opinions in
24 this case?
25
A. All of them are relevant.
244
1 Q. Is that why they're on the reliance list?
2 A. Yes, sir.
3 Q. You will make a determination about which of
4 those you will actually use at trial closer to the
5 time of trial?
6 A. Correct.
7 Q. And does the same hold true for magazine
8 articles?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. Are there magazine articles from a variety of
11 magazines on your reliance list?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Do you rely on all those in forming your
14 opinions in this case?
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]15 A. Yes, I do.
16 Q. Have you made a determination about which of
17 those, if any, you would present to a jury at the
18 trial of this case?
19 A. Not at this point.
20 Q. When do you intend to make that
21 determination?
22 A. Closer to the date of the trial.
23 Q. Do you have opinions based on those articles?
24 A. Yes, I do.
25 Q. Have you given those opinions either in your
245
1 last deposition or in your deposition here today?
2 A. Yes, I have.
3 Q. Does the same hold true for newspapers?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. You expanded on an answer earlier and said
6 something along the lines that there was massive
7 information on the health consequences and health
8 risks of smoking that was published to the general
9 public. Do you recall that?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. Is that one of the opinions that you hold in
12 this case?
13
A. That there was massive information --
file:///C|/...Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.10.12%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20(Vol%202)%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:34]14 Q. Yes.
15 A. -- reaching the public?
16 Q. Yes.
17 A. Yes. Not only printed information, but
18 visual information as well.
