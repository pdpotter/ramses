2David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
BY MR. SEXTON:
Q. Good morning, Dr. Kyriakoudes. This is Terry Sexton on behalf of Philip Morris. How are you today?
A. I'm well. Good morning.
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you've been offered to give expert depositions in two cases today, the Tullo case and the Katz case. You're
aware of that, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. I just would like to briefly explain to you on the record how I'd like to proceed today in the hopes of avoiding any duplication
or waste of time or anything like that. All right?
A. Okay.
Q. So here's how I'd like to -- let's see if we can agree on some ground rules and procedures that might provide a shortcut for us.
Your opinions are substantially the same from case to case, correct?
A. That would be true, yes. That is true.
Q. And is it your plan to give what you have called your standard testimony in the Tullo case?
A. Yes.
Q. Is it your plan to give what you have called your standard testimony in the Katz case?
A. Yes.
Q. And just to be fair -- and I'll give you a chance to explain this, but your testimony has been very consistent across the many
times you've given it at trial, right?
A. I believe so. Yes.
Q. Okay. And your disclosure in the Tullo case is consistent with those you filed in other cases, right?
A. It should be. Yes. I don't think I've seen the actual disclosure, but I assume it's the same language, the boilerplate language
that's been used in all the other cases.
Q. And you expect the same to be true in the Katz case, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. All right. And you intend to give that same consistent testimony in Tullo and in Katz, correct?
A. Yes.

3David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
Q. All right. And a minute ago, I referred to what you have called as your standard testimony, but just for the record, let me ask
you this question: When you refer to your standard testimony, what do you mean?
A. Well, I refer to the testimony that I've given in prior cases. If you want me to summarize it, I'll happily do so.
Q. Sure. If you could just tag the key issues that for you comprise your standard testimony, that would be helpful.
A. Sure. In both of these cases, I expect to be asked, as I've been asked in the past, to explain the history of cigarette use in
the United States with a particular emphasis on the 20th Century and especially so during the lives of the -- in this case, the
two decedents.
And so I anticipate explaining the origins of the cigarette as an industrial manufactured product in the late 19th Century, the
means by which cigarettes were marketed and advertised over the course of the 20th Century. I expect perhaps to discuss the
patterns of usage, prevalence, the social patterns of usage, cigarette use, over the course of the 20th Century.
Then I expect to discuss the role of the cigarette industry in promoting cigarettes and the ways in which they did it. And then as
the health issue became a national issue in the 1950s, to discuss the history of that and the ways in which the tobacco industry
responded to the growing body of scientific evidence that cigarette caused lung cancer and other serious diseases.
Then I expect that I probably would discuss the public statements of the industry, the '50s through the '90s, you know, the
ways in which they sought to persuade the public that cigarettes were not harmful, the ways in which the product changed, for
example, the shift to filters and how that influenced the public's understanding and knowledge of the risks of smoking.
So I don't anticipate that my testimony in these two cases would differ substantially from prior cases, and I would offer as an
example, to keep things kind of neat, the Barbanell case as something that would be reflective of that.
Q. You would expect your testimony in either the Tullo case or the Katz case to be substantially the same as the testimony
that you offered in the Barbanell trial?
A. That's true. It may be the case that the examining attorneys -- and I don't know because I haven't discussed this with them.
It may be the case that the person doing the direct examination might want me to discuss more about what was going on within
the tobacco industry as it related to their efforts to shape public knowledge and public opinion.
I didn't do quite as much of that in the Barbanell case, as I sit here. You know, they may draw upon some of the questions that
were asked in my preservation deposition that I did in, I guess, very early in 2009.
Q. Sure. I understand. Let me put it this way. As we sit here today, at least, you don't intend to offer opinions in either the Tullo
case or in the Katz case, which are substantially different from the Barbanell trial, true?
A. Right. That's true. I haven't changed my opinions or changed my mind -- you know, my opinions have been -- as you said
earlier, they have been consistent.
Q. Absolutely.
And I'll represent to you -- and please correct me if I'm wrong -- I believe you were last deposed two weeks ago in a case called
Hatziyannakis, H-A-T-Z-I-Y-A-N-N-A-K-I-S; is that correct?
A. That's right.

4David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
Q. And your standard testimony has not changed in the last few weeks since you were deposed in the Hatziyannakis case,
correct?
A. No, there's been no change.
Q. Am I pronouncing that name correctly, Dr. Kyriakoudes, if you know? I know you're Greek.
A. Yeah, I know. You know, I think you're close.
Q. Okay. So you have not developed any new opinions that you intend to offer in the Tullo case?
A. No. No. I anticipate -- you know, I mean, depending upon what questions they ask me, I'm going to stick to what I know,
to which I've testified over these many years that I've been testifying.
Q. And the same is true in Katz, you don't intend to offer any new opinions in the Katz case?
A. No. Nothing that differs substantially to what I testified previously in the past.
Q. And if I understand the testimony you've given correctly, you've not done any work or formed any new opinions since your
September 10th, 2010, deposition in the Hatziyannakis case; is that right?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. So just to avoid time and repetition, here's what I propose, and let me know if you're willing to go along with this,
Dr. Kyriakoudes.
Are you willing to assume today that my questions apply to both the Tullo and Katz cases unless I specify that I'm just asking
about Tullo or just asking about Katz?
A. Yes, I am.
Q. Okay. That's great.
And can we agree for purposes of this deposition today that your answers will apply to both the Tullo case and the Katz case
unless you tell me otherwise?
A. I will. That's a good idea.
Q. Okay. When were you first contacted to work on the Tullo and Katz cases?
A. About the same time I was called about the Hatziyannakis case. I was asked to give a variety of dates for upcoming
depositions, and I'm not recalling exactly, but it was sometime over the summer, but --
Q. Your best recollection is great.
A. Yeah. Sometime either towards the end of July or -- and early August.
Q. Were you contacted about the Hatziyannakis, Tullo and Katz cases in the same phone call?

5David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. I really can't remember because at least the initial contact was between myself and a secretary in the office of the Schlesinger
law firm, basically asking for dates that they could offer up for some upcoming depositions, so I don't really recall.
Q. Sure.
The first time you were contacted by anyone about the Tullo and Katz cases was when you heard from a secretary at the
Schlesinger law firm that some deposition dates were needed; is that correct?
A. Yeah. That sounds right.
Q. And have you had subsequent telephone calls with anyone at the Schlesinger law firm about the Tullo and Katz cases?
A. I've had some calls with a paralegal by the name of Taylor McParland basically concerning scheduling and -- and those
kinds of matters.
Q. Have you had any communications with anyone at the Schlesinger law firm on substantive matters --
A. Yeah. I had one --
Q. -- in the Tullo or Katz cases?
A. Yeah. I had one call earlier this week with the attorney Steve Hamer.
Q. Okay.
A. And we talked about the case.
Q. How long did you talk with Mr. Hamer?
A. Oh. No more than 30 minutes.
Q. And during that 30-minute conversation with Mr. Hamer, what did he tell you?
A. Well, he -- he asked -- he mostly asked me questions. He wanted to know my views on each of the two decedents, the
smokers, and what I knew about the various brands that they smoked in terms of advertising, exhibits, things like that.
Q. Was that 30 minutes total on both Tullo and Katz?
A. Yeah. We talked about them together.
Q. And is Mr. Hamer the only attorney from the Schlesinger law firm that you've spoken with about the Tullo and Katz cases?
A. Yeah. When I spoke to Mr. Hamer, he was on -- excuse me, he was on speakerphone, and Mr. Patrick might have been
in the room, I can't recall, but Mr. Hamer was the only person that led the conversation and asked questions and engaged in
the discussion.
Q. All right. And you mentioned a moment ago that Mr. Hamer was asking your views about the individual smokers in the
Tullo and Katz cases. What were those views based on?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
6David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. Oh. Well, we -- we discussed, for example, the brand -- his brands and exhibits, you know. So, for example, he wanted to
know, you know, if I had any Chesterfield advertisements, for example, whether I had any Eve advertisements. Ms. Katz, you
know, smoked Eve, for example. I said that I did and, you know, explained to him what I had in my reliance documents.
Q. Prior to your 30-minute phone conversation with Mr. Hamer, had you reviewed any materials pertaining to either the Tullo
or Katz cases?
A. Yeah. I had skimmed through some -- I had received through e-mail some depositions. I also received through the post and
paper form depositions in the case. I had skimmed through them quickly in preparation for the phone call meeting.
Q. All right. Is it fair to say as you sit here today that you only skimmed through some depositions in the Tullo and Katz cases?
A. Well, right now, I've read -- I've read the husband's deposition in the Katz case, the wife's deposition in the Tullo case and
the interrogatories, the first interrogatories in both of those cases.
Q. So in the Katz case, you have read the husband's deposition, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. And you also reviewed the interrogatory responses in the Katz case?
A. That's correct.
Q. In the Tullo case, you've read Mr. Tullo's wife's deposition?
A. That's correct.
Q. Did you read all three days of her testimony?
A. I did. I did read -- it was either three or four volumes. Yeah.
Q. And also in the Tullo case, you have reviewed interrogatory responses, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Is there anything else that you've reviewed regarding the Katz case?
A. No. I was sent the other depositions, family members and the stuff, but I didn't feel the need to review those.
Q. Those aren't really relevant to your opinions in the Katz case?
A. No.
Q. And apart from the three or four volumes of the wife's deposition and the interrogatory responses in the Tullo case, have
you reviewed anything else regarding Tullo?
A. No. Not -- those documents were sufficient for my needs to prepare for the case.

7David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
MR. SEXTON:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, did you highlight the transcript that you reviewed in the Katz case?
A. No. Although I was sent the paper copies, through telephone call to Ms. McParland, I expressed my desire for electronic
copies and read the electronic copies.
Q. Okay. Did you make any notes or work-products concerning your review of the husband's deposition in the Katz case or
the interrogatory responses in that case?
A. No, I did not.
Q. All right. Same question in the Tullo case, did you highlight the transcripts or interrogatory responses?
A. No, I did not.
Q. Did you prepare any work-product or notes regarding the transcripts or the interrogatories in the Tullo case?
A. No materials, correct, for both cases.
Q. Have you done -- apart from reading the transcript and the interrogatories in Katz, have you done any other research or
investigation specifically for the Katz case?
A. Well, for the Katz case --
(Off the record.)
A. For the Katz case, after I reviewed my standard set of reliance documents, I realized I didn't actually have any materials related
to the advertising of the Eve cigarette. So I went and pulled some Eve cigarette advertisements from the industry database.
MR. SEXTON:
Q. Was that the only Katz specific research or investigation you've done?
A. Yeah. Everything else had already been prepared, so that was the only thing that I had done.
Q. In the Tullo case, have you done any case-specific research or investigation?
A. No. No. I had sufficient materials and research, and that fit in very nicely with the previous work I've done.
Q. Did you charge a retainer for either Tullo or Katz?
A. Well, I -- I asked for a retainer for all three cases of one payment of $3,500, and then they asked me to send them an invoice.
I haven't gotten around to doing that because I've been very busy, but I intend to send an invoice for $3,500 to cover all three
cases as an advance on the hours that I will bill for whichever case comes to trial first.
Q. Have you prepared any other invoices for the Katz case?

8David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. No, Katz nor Tullo.
Q. Have you kept track of the time that you've spent working on the Katz case so far?
A. Just in my head. I've worked about -- including the phone calls that I've made, you know, half-hour phone call meeting and
various shorter calls with the paralegal, it's probably been about five hours for both cases combined.
Q. You spent a total of five hours working on both the Katz case and the Tullo case?
A. Right. Just simply reviewing those deposition materials I described earlier.
Q. Would you divide that time equally between the two cases, or do you think you spent more time on either Tullo or Katz?
A. Well, the -- Mrs. Tullo's deposition was a bit longer than Mr. Katz's deposition, so I probably took more time reading that
deposition.
Q. As we sit here today, do you intend to do any additional research for the Katz case?
A. No.
Q. I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.
A. Oh. I said no. And that would apply to Tullo as well.
Q. You don't intend to do any additional research for the Tullo case?
A. That's correct.
Q. Apart from your phone conversations with Mr. Hamer and your review of the depositions and interrogatories you have
already described, have you done any additional preparation for your deposition today?
A. No. I mentioned that I went and pulled out a few Eve advertisements, and that would be it.
Q. I'm sorry. I'll ask the question again. I'll wrap that in, see if we get it.
Apart from your review of the deposition transcripts, your review of the interrogatory responses, your 30-minute phone
conversation with Mr. Hamer and your pullings on Eve advertisements, have you done any additional work for your deposition
here today?
A. No, I have not.
Q. And have you told me now about all of the communications and correspondence you've had with counsel regarding the
Katz case?
A. Yeah. And I -- you know, in response to your -- or the scheduling, I brought some of the e-mails -- I brought the e-mails that
were exchanged between me and Ms. McParland. I have no e-mails between me and the attorneys.
Q. Okay. We'll go through that in a minute. Let me just ask you, have you brought any other materials with you today besides
the e-mails you just described?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
9David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. Well, I brought my most recent CV, which I've not updated since my last deposition --
Q. Okay.
A. -- that might be a significant piece of information. And then Item 1 on the Schedule A asked for hard copies. I felt hard
copies were burdensome, but I did burn two DVD disks, data disks, for you, for your use, of my reliance documents.
I -- I created on that computer disk a folder called -- I think it's Schlesinger Tullo and Schlesinger Katz, which contains, for
example, those Eve advertisements, and actually as I sit here, I recall -- I think I added a couple of Chesterfield television
commercials and maybe some Marlboro commercials. And I segregated those into a separate folder so that you would know
which ones I had actually pulled for this case that were new compared, for example, to the set of DVDs I supplied a few weeks
ago.
Q. Okay. That's really helpful.
Let me ask you a few questions about your reliance materials for this case because I'll tell you, I got on a couple of portable
external hard drives a whole ton of documents, and I think maybe what I got is more extensive than your reliance list. So I
want to see if I can figure this out. Okay?
A. Sure.
Q. Do you intend to use in the Tullo case basically the same set of standard reliance materials that you used in your other Engle
cases such as Barbanell?
A. I do. Again, I think -- I'm not exactly sure how, you know, the attorneys are going to run the direct examination, but my
sense is that I may be asked to give more of a discussion of say, for example, the Hill & Knowlton story from the 1953, '54
and beyond period, than I may have given in the Barbanell case. So there may be more of those Hill & Knowlton exhibits that
I've used in previous cases but compared to Barbanell.
Does that make sense?
Q. Yes. Let me ask you this question: Have your reliance materials changed since you were deposed two weeks ago in the
Hatziyannakis case?
A. No, they haven't. And, again, I did segregate the few items, and we're really talking just half a dozen items, that I had pulled,
for example, some Eve advertisements, and then to amend my earlier question, I did download some Marlboro and Chesterfield
ads, and I put them in separate folders under Katz and under Tullo so that you would, you know, know what was different than
the -- what I would call the standard set of research materials that I always provide in these situations.
Q. Let me break this out by specific case. In the Tullo case, do you intend to use those advertisements you just described?
A. Sure. Mr. Tullo smoked Lucky Strike and Chesterfield and he also smoked Parliament, and so I anticipate using
advertisements related to those brands.
Q. What about the Katz case?
A. Again, she smoked Chesterfields as well, so I imagine using Chesterfield advertisements, commercials, to give a feel and
flavor of the marketing strategies. I have print ads for Eve, show some of those print ads from the early '70s.

10David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
Q. So you intend to use those Chesterfield and Eve ads in the Katz case, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Let me just represent to you that I received a couple of these external portable hard drives with documents on them. Did
you prepare these?
A. No. I've also been sent or was sent a similar hard drive. I assume it's similar. My understanding is that those are the trial
exhibits that -- I believe there's material from all different experts in there. But I have not carefully reviewed all that material.
It seems to be quite a bit.
Q. All right. But -- so I just want to make sure I understand. You are not necessarily using as your reliance materials all of the
documents which are contained on these portable external hard drives we've been sent?
A. Yes. That would be true. I mean, I think there are -- I sent a large volume of material to the attorneys back when I did the
Barbanell case, and they had kept that, and so in prior discussions for the Hatziyannakis, I think they -- my understanding is
they kind of merged all that stuff together.
Q. I'll just tell you, for example, there are on the portable external hard drive subfolders with the names of other experts, such
as Dr. Cummings.
A. Right. I saw that. Yes. So I assume that it's got the exhibits and the materials of a variety of experts.
Q. All right. And those materials would pertain to other experts and are not necessarily your reliance materials, true?
A. Right. Not necessarily. I mean, I haven't reviewed the Cummings materials. Sometimes he tells the Hill & Knowlton story,
so to speak, so he may have some of those Hill & Knowlton documents as well. In other words, you know, there may be overlap,
but I really haven't, you know, gone through that hard drive systematically. I just briefly, you know, gave it a quick look.
Q. Do you intend to use the same reliance materials in both the Tullo and the Katz cases?
A. I do. And, for example, I burned one set of -- well, I have two DVDs here, and they say Kyriakoudes, Katz/Tullo. So, yes, I --
you know, from my perspective -- and this is something I think that's familiar to you, but I'll restate it for the record. You know,
my interest is in understanding the smoker in historical time and in historical space, that is place, and both of the decedents in
this case -- well, one is a man and one is a woman -- are basically from approximately the same time. There's about a nine-
or ten-year difference in their ages, but they're both from the same city and grew up in what is essentially the same milieu. So
there are significant similarities in that regard. And so my standard set of reliance documents encompasses both.
Q. That's great.
And I promise you, I'm not trying to waste your time by asking a lot of the questions you've been asked before. I just want to
make sure the record is clear about what you're actually using?
A. Sure.
Q. And so I apologize if I sound like I'm going over old territory.

11David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
Let me ask you this: Have you in the two weeks or so since you were deposed in Hatziyannakis identified any new Philip Morris
documents that you intend to use in either the Katz case or the Tullo case?
A. Well, I did download a set of -- a stretch of -- a Marlboro advertisement, standard television advertisements from the 1950s
and early 1960s.
Q. Sure. I saw those.
Apart from the Marlboro ad, do you intend to use any new Philip Morris documents in the Katz or Tullo cases --
A. No.
Q. -- that you haven't used previously?
A. No.
Q. And there are on your reliance set no materials that are specific to Mr. Tullo or his family, correct?
A. Oh, you mean documents that pertain only to him uniquely?
Q. Yes.
A. No. Except, you know, I have the depositions, but, no, no -- no personal documents. I have no family photographs, for
example, or things that would be of a historical nature related just to those families, and that would apply to Katz as well.
Q. So the same is true for Katz, there are no Katz-specific materials on your reliance list?
A. No. No. I have no items that are -- you know, unique to these families, the Katz family either.
Q. You answered this next question about two weeks ago. I just want to make sure the answer has not changed. You don't intend
to offer any opinions about Philip Morris USA's conduct in Tullo that you've not provided in prior Engle trial testimony, correct?
A. That would be correct. Yes.
Q. Same question for Katz, you would not intend to offer any opinions about Philip Morris USA's conduct that you have not
provided in prior Engle trial testimony?
A. That's correct.
Q. Would the same be true for R.J. Reynolds?
A. Yes. The same would be true for Reynolds and the other manufacturers as well.
Q. Same would be true for Lorillard?
A. Correct.
Q. And the same would be true for Liggett?

12David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. Correct.
Q. I apologize for the tedium of going through each one of those, but it matters a lot to the other people on the phone.
A. Okay.
Q. You touched on this a moment ago, Dr. Kyriakoudes, I just want to put a finer point on it, if we can.
Do you intend to offer any opinions in the Tullo case that are specific to Mr. Dominick Tullo?
A. Well, it may be the case that I would be asked to describe to the jury, you know, the -- you know, the environment in which
Mr. Tullo grew up, which would be, you know, Red Hook, Cobble Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn in the 1920s and 1930s. And
so I may opine on that, talk about, you know, what kind of -- what immigrant working-class urban neighborhoods were like at
that time. You know, he was, for example, a shoe-shine boy for a while. I may be asked to explain that.
So general kind of historical contextual matters, you know, I would -- that may come up.
Q. Sure. That -- that's fair, and that's completely consistent with what you told me in prior cases, but let me put a finer point on it.
Apart from sort of the general contextual matters placing Mr. Tullo in time and space and in context, apart from that, do you
intend to offer any specific opinions about Mr. Dominick Tullo or his family?
A. No. I intend to be consistent in how I've treated all of these cases in that -- well, I can offer, again, as we just mentioned
this context. I'm not the biographer of the plaintiff and, you know, cannot recreate, you know, his individual thought processes
in any particular point in time.
Q. And you've been very consistent on that point, so I apologize in advance for the tedium of running through the next few
questions.
But to be clear, you're not going to testify as to what Mr. Tullo specifically read, saw or heard from anyone about cigarettes
or smoking, true?
A. That's right. I can only describe the general information that was available in his time and place.
Q. You're not going to offer any opinions about what Mr. Tullo specifically knew or believed about cigarette smoking at any
point in time?
A. No.
Q. You're not going to offer any opinions about what influenced Mr. Tullo's decision about cigarette smoking?
A. No, not his individual decision.
Q. You're not going to offer any opinions, for example, about why Mr. Tullo started smoking?
A. No.
Q. Or kept smoking?

13David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. Not him as an individual, distinct from the general population.
Q. Okay. You're not going to testify about what led Mr. Tullo to quit smoking, right?
A. Correct.
Q. You're not going to offer any opinions about whether Mr. Tullo was addicted?
A. No, I'm not going to offer an opinion on that.
Q. And consistent with your testimony in other cases, you're not going to testify about what caused Mr. Tullo's disease and death?
A. No. I'm not going to offer any medical diagnosis.
Q. Are you going to offer any opinions about the specific details of Mr. Tullo's smoking history?
A. Well, in some sense, you know -- and, again, this is how he fits into some general patterns. You know, he did favor certain
brands at certain points in time, and so I may reference that. He did switch to filters, and like, you know, most people, the
evidence suggests he switched to filters because he thought they might offer a protective benefit. So to that extent, I may talk
about that.
Q. Do you know specifically why Mr. Tullo switched to filters?
A. Well, all I know is what, you know, evidence we have in the deposition. His wife reports that he switched to filters because
she says he believed that they were safer. You know, that's -- that's all the evidence that exists. But, you know, for my purposes,
you know, generally the cigarette -- let me rephrase that. I apologize.
For my purposes, and as I've said many times, the general shift to filters were in the 1950s, and at least in my opinion, is that
people shifted to filters because they thought they were safer, and to the extent that Mr. Tullo fits in this general pattern, you
know, that makes sense.
Q. Do you know whether the historical epidemiological evidence suggests that filters are, in fact, safer than unfiltered cigarettes?
A. Well, I've never offered an opinion onto the actual safety or lack of safety, or the protective benefit or lack of protective
benefit on filters. I don't see that as my area.
Just to be precise, what I would testify to is kind of what was the belief in the majority of the public or if not the majority,
the substantial portion of the smoking public's mind in terms of the way the information was presented to the public and those
kinds of things.
As to whether it actually offers a medical benefit, that's not in my area.
Q. As a matter of history, do you know what the Surgeon General of the United States has said historically about whether filters
are safer than unfiltered cigarettes?
A. Well, that changes over time. There was a general move towards filters in the late '60s and '70s. There was the hope that
filters might some day offer a protective benefit, but then as a matter of history, the current view is that filters are not safe.

14David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
Q. Would you agree with me that as late as 1994, the Surgeon General of the United States was reporting that filters were safer
than unfiltered cigarettes?
A. I'm not sure about the statements in that year, so I could neither agree nor disagree. I just don't know.
Q. Can you identify any report of the Surgeon General of the United States that ever indicated that filters were not safer than
unfiltered cigarettes?
A. You know, I'd have to -- this is not an area I anticipated opining in. So I'd have to, you know, go back through the Surgeon
General's reports and refresh myself.
Q. Okay. And that's totally fair, but as we sit here today, you can't identify a Surgeon General's report where the Surgeon
General reports that filters are not safer than unfiltered cigarettes; is that true?
A. Not a Surgeon General's report. I mean, there are other documents, I think Monograph 13, for example, you know, discusses
that. But within a Surgeon General's report, which is a particular type of publication, I'd have to go back and review the reports.
Q. And is it your belief that Monograph 13 from the National Cancer Institute reported that filtered cigarettes were not safer
than unfiltered cigarettes?
A. Yeah. We're on the frontier of my -- of my expertise and knowledge, but that -- that's what I understand it to be. And, again,
I'd have to double-check. It's been a long time since I reviewed that document.
Q. Well, let me see if we can do it this way. Do you intend to offer the opinion at the trial of either the Tullo case or the Katz
case that filters were not, in fact, safer than unfiltered cigarettes?
A. No. I'm not going to offer any opinions as to -- no, I'm not going to offer that opinion. I'm only going to offer as I've done in
the past, an opinion about what people believed and understood and the way in which the product was represented. I mean, what
your question asks me to speak to, the actual level of harm the product can cause, and that's not something I've ever testified
about in the past and don't intend to testify in these cases.
Q. Do you intend to testify about historically what the public health authorities have said about the relative safety of filtered
and unfiltered cigarettes?
A. I hadn't anticipated discussing that topic in the two trials.
Q. You don't plan to address that?
A. No.
Q. All right. Quickly, then, let me ask you the same questions regarding the Katz case. Do you intend to offer any opinions
in the Katz case that are specific to Mrs. Janet Katz or her family, apart from placing her in the general historical context that
you've already described?
A. No.
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, are you still there?
A. I am.

15David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
Q. I'm sorry.
A. I said “no.”
Q. There was a pause, and I worried that maybe we had lost you.
A. I gave an uncharacteristically short answer.
Q. I'm sorry, I didn't hear. I apologize. I didn't hear it.
A. I said “no.”
Q. Okay. And just to close out this discussion, you're not going to offer any opinions as to what Mrs. Katz specifically read,
saw or heard from anyone about cigarettes or smoking, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Not going to offer any opinions about what Mrs. Katz knew or believed at any point in time about cigarette smoking?
A. That's correct.
Q. Not going to offer any opinions about what influenced Mrs. Katz's decisions regarding cigarette smoking?
A. Not her as an individual, just people like her in her time and place.
Q. Okay. But no opinions about what influenced Mrs. Katz individually in her decisions about cigarette smoking?
A. That's right. I'm not going to offer that.
Q. No opinions about why Mrs. Katz started smoking?
A. No.
Q. Or kept smoking?
A. No.
Q. Or why she quit?
A. Same answer. No.
Q. Or whether she was addicted?
A. I'm not going to opine on that either. No.
Q. Or what caused her disease and death?
A. Same answer. No.

16David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
Q. Do you intend to offer any opinions in the Katz case about the details of Mrs. Katz's smoking history?
A. Well, again, you know, she smoked certain brands, and I would imagine talking about, you know, the marketing of those
brands, the advertisements, like I discussed earlier. I mean, to the extent that she smoked certain -- favored certain products,
like Chesterfield and Eve, that would be, you know, an emphasis, but, of course, she was like, you know, many millions of
people that used those brands.
Q. Let's see if we can cover this quickly. Can you just summarize for me briefly your understanding of Mrs. Katz's smoking
history?
A. Well, she was born in the early 1930s. She, you know, begins smoking as a young woman in the late '40s, early '50s.
Chesterfield was described by her husband as an early brand that she smoked. Lived in the New York area, you know, first
in the city and then out on the island.
Q. By “the island,” you mean Long Island?
A. Yes, Long Island. Yeah. The laughter is just because it's -- Long Island is such a stereotypical place.
You know, she was like a lot of women, like, you know, kind of average working women. She had done bank teller work and
stuff like that. She smoked. So, you know, that's -- that's it right there.
Q. Is that about what you intend to say about Mrs. Katz's smoking history?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. You don't intend to specify specific brands that she smoked at specific periods of time?
A. Well, I mean, you know, she started off with Chesterfield, as described. She had a number of intermediate brands. By the
early '70s, she was smoking Eve, which was introduced in the early '70s or late '60s, I should say. And so to that extent, she,
you know, she did settle on the female-oriented brand.
Q. Is it your understanding that Chesterfields and Eves were Mrs. Katz's principal brands?
A. Those are the ones that come to mind right now. She may have smoked others. I'm just not recollecting.
Q. Sure. And I'm only asking for your best recollection, but do you recall from your review of her husband's testimony whether
-- or the interrogatory responses whether Mrs. Katz was a regular smoker of any brand other than Chesterfield or Eve?
A. I'm not recalling any other brands.
Q. Okay. Let's switch to Mr. Tullo now. What can you tell me about Mr. Tullo's smoking history?
A. Well, you know, he smoked the most popular brands in the day that he was smoking. His -- you know, his wife reports that
he smoked Lucky Strikes, Chesterfields, Kents, Parliaments, and she also mentions that when he'd run out of cigarettes, he'd
smoke a varsity of brands. So, you know, had a -- that kind of a smoking brand preference over time.
Q. Is it important for your opinions in the Tullo case how long he smoked any of the particular brands you just mentioned?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
17David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. No.
Marlboro is also one of the brands he smoked as well, I might add.
No. I mean, it's not important for my opinions to know how long he smoked one brand over another. I mean, just to the extent
that as a matter of history, people, you know, tended towards filters, like I described earlier, over time and later to lights, you
know, so-called, you know, light and ultralight cigarettes over time.
Q. You don't know why specifically Mr. Tullo switched from one brand to another, do you?
A. Not particularly. I mean, his wife mentions that he -- again, he went to a filtered cigarette because she reports that he thought
it was a safer cigarette, but beyond that, no.
Q. You don't know specifically why Mr. Tullo chose one filtered brand as opposed to another, true?
A. That would be true. I don't know those -- I don't have that level of detail.
Q. And you don't -- you don't need that level of detail for the opinions you plan to offer in the Tullo case?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you don't intend in the Tullo case to come in and recite that Mr. Tullo smoked particular brands for a particular period
of time in particular years; is that true?
All I'm really asking for is what level of detail or granularity you intend to provide --
A. Yeah. I don't anticipate any -- you know, I may be asked to say, for example, you know -- I may be asked to describe how
Chesterfield was marketed because he smoked Chesterfield, and I would make that description, or I might be asked to describe
in the 1950s and early '60s how Marlboro was marketed to the public. So I would, you know, describe and tell that story.
You know, I -- I -- I've never been asked the question, Dr. Kyriakoudes, please tell me what the first brand that the smoker in
this case smoked, and then recite from memory his brand history forward.
Q. That's perfect. You don't intend to give that kind of a detailed recitation of the smoker's smoking history in the Tullo case
either, correct?
A. Right. No. I mean, just to be clear, though, I -- you know, I mean, each of the decedents in these cases smoked particular
products, and, you know, I'll discuss the marketing of those particular products.
Q. Absolutely. And I understand, and we'll actually talk a little bit about what you intend to say about the marketing of those
brands. I just want you to be as clear with me as you can about the level of detail that you intend to provide regarding the
smoking history of Mr. Tullo, for example.
A. Okay.
Q. All right. So you don't intend as we sit here today to come in and recite specific years that Mr. Tullo smoked Marlboro,
for example?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
18David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. No. And, you know, based on -- I don't know how anybody could because based on the evidence presented in at least his
wife's deposition, we would presume that she would be in the best position to know, you know, that you only have approximate
times anyway.
Q. Do you recall as we sit here today the approximate years that Mr. Tullo smoked Marlboro?
A. I don't. I think it was the late '50s and '60s, but I'd have to double-check.
Q. Do you recall as we sit here today the specific years that Mr. Tullo smoked Parliament?
A. You know, I think he was also smoking Parliament in the 1950s.
Q. Do you know whether in Mrs. Tullo's different days of her testimony, whether she provided different smoking histories
for her husband?
A. You mean conflicting?
Q. Yes, sir.
A. Well, it -- you know, I -- it's a very difficult thing for somebody to remember. You know, cigarettes were such a kind of
standard part of daily life. It's often something that someone like a spouse would not remember exactly.
And often, you know, she's -- you know, the things that spark her memory where she can remember an aspect of her husband's
smoking history is related to specific events, like finding something in his dresser drawer, which she mentions in one of the
depositions. So it's not important to me and it's not important to my opinions in this case to have a fine-grained, absolutely
detailed specific history of the decedent's smoking brand preference.
Q. That's perfectly fair. And I don't intend for my question to be critical of Mrs. Tullo, nor am I asking you to be critical of
her in any way. I just would like to know if you observed any significant conflicts in the smoking history that she provided
in the different days of her deposition.
A. Well, I mean, you know, she provides a broad picture of something that's very difficult to remember. I wouldn't use the term
“conflict.” You know, she -- over the course of the deposition, she's recollecting and being kind of brought back into a much
earlier time in her life, and so she says a lot of things about her husband's smoking history.
Q. Did you attempt to undertake any analysis to try and reconcile in any way the different smoking histories that were provided
across the various days of Mrs. Tullo's testimony?
A. No. I mean, again, that's not something that is important for my opinions in the case.
Q. Okay. Fair enough. Let me take a slight detour now and ask you about materials that you've brought with you today. One
of the items you mentioned I think was a CD or a DVD?
A. Two DVD disks, data disks.
Q. Could you hand those to the court reporter for marking, please?
A. I can and I am.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
19David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
Q. Thank you.
A. They are in her possession.
(Exhibit Numbers 1 and 2 were marked.)
(Off the record.)
MR. SEXTON:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, can you tell me what is on the DVD or the CD that we've marked as Exhibit 1?
A. I can. It is the -- you know, my standard set of reliance documents, which I provided a similar set to Ms. Christine Lawson
-- or no. Whomever did my last deposition. Maybe it was Ms. Jenny Brown.
Q. Who did your Hatziyannakis?
A. Yeah, Hatziyannakis deposition. So it's those documents, the same, with, as I described earlier, two folders, which are clearly
marked Katz and Tullo, which have the depositions that were sent to me in electronic form, and then a few Eve advertisements
and a few Marlboro television commercials and a few Chesterfield commercials.
Q. Could you please tell us what is on the disk that is marked Exhibit 2?
A. Okay. My answer -- previous answer applies to both exhibits. And what I did when I was burning these DVDs is I just kind
of moved things over into the window where you store things, and when it reached the point where it filled up the disk, I hit
burn and then moved the rest of the folders from my computer for the second disk and then hit burn.
So as I sit here, I'm not sure which disk those special subfolders would be on. Probably on the first disk. But I promise you, it's
easy to figure out. You pop Tullo in the computer, one will say Katz, one will say Tullo.
Q. That's perfect. Just so the record is clear, the universe of your reliance materials and the materials that you reviewed for the
Tullo and Katz cases are contained on the two disks which we have marked as Exhibits 1 and 2, correct?
A. Yeah.
Q. Okay. What else have you brought with you today?
A. I brought my Curriculum Vitae.
Q. Would you mark that or ask the court reporter to mark it for us?
A. Yes. And, again, that's not been updated since my last deposition.
(Exhibit Number 3 was marked.)
MR. SEXTON:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, for the record, would you please identify Exhibit 3?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
20David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. Exhibit 3 is my Curriculum Vitae.
Q. Have you brought anything else with you today?
A. I brought one, two -- I brought two e-mails.
Q. Are the two e-mails you brought with you on separate pages?
A. Yeah. They're -- each one is on two pages. One of them is -- actually, there are three e-mails, three e-mails over the course
of five pages of paper.
Q. Apart from the five pages of e-mails, have you brought anything else with you today?
A. I have not.
Q. All right. And would you please hand those e-mails to the court reporter?
(Exhibit Number 4 was marked.)
(Off the record.)
MR. SEXTON:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, would you please identify Exhibit 4 for us?
A. Exhibit 4 is a set of e-mails sent from the Schlesinger law firm, more specifically Ms. Taylor McParland -- I believe I
mispronounced her name earlier in the deposition. It's P-A-R-L-A-N-D. I apologize. And they are the e-mails which they used
to send me the Tullo and Katz depositions and interrogatories, and these are the e-mails I received for this case.
Q. Does Exhibit 4 represent the complete universe of e-mail or written correspondence that you have had with the Schlesinger
law firm regarding the Tullo and Katz cases?
A. It does.
Q. And that's all that you brought with you today, correct?
A. That's correct.
MR. SEXTON: We've been going about an hour and 15 minutes now. Why don't we take a quick break for about five minutes
or so, if that's okay.
THE WITNESS: Sure.
(Off the record.)
MR. SEXTON:
Q. I want to ask you just a few more questions about filters, as we were discussing them earlier, and then moved on to another
topic.

21David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
First, you would agree that you do not hold yourself out as an expert on cigarette filtration, true?
A. Right. I'm not an expert on cigarette design or the science behind that. No.
Q. Nor are you an expert on changes in cigarette filter design over time?
A. No.
Q. Nor are you an expert on the efficacy of cigarette filters?
A. I'm not an expert in that area.
Q. All right. Now, you mentioned earlier that both Mr. Tullo and Mrs. Katz were New Yorkers, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. And can you describe what New York specific opinions you intend to provide? We'll start with the Tullo case. What New
York specific opinions do you intend to provide in Tullo?
A. I may be asked to describe the kind of neighborhood Mr. Tullo grew up in. I may be asked to recreate that Brooklyn waterfront
world where he grew up. I may be asked to talk about what happened in the New York press, things like that, you know, local
New York specific advertising perhaps.
Q. All right. Now, you've already told us that you don't intend to testify that Mr. Tullo himself specifically saw particular ads
or articles, right?
A. That's correct. I can't place him in front of specific materials at specific points in time.
Q. Do you intend to testify regarding what magazines Mr. Tullo read?
A. Well, his wife reports that he didn't read any, but I don't really anticipate offering an opinion about what he did. My -- my
opinions will be as to what appeared in the press.
Q. You don't intend to offer any specific opinions regarding what Mr. Tullo did, saw, heard or read as it pertains to cigarette
smoking?
A. Not him as an individual, distinct from the general population of his time.
Q. Okay. And in forming your opinions regarding what appeared in the New York press, what sources have you reviewed?
A. Well, principally the New York Times in significant detail, which, of course, is included in the reliance documents. Other
materials and magazine articles that I've reviewed over time, some of which are in my reliance, some of which I've just
encountered.
Q. Have you done a systematic review of Newsday, for example?
A. I have not.

22David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
Q. What about the New York Daily News?
A. I've not done that paper either.
Q. I think you mentioned this earlier, but you don't currently have any photographs of Mr. Tullo or his neighborhood, do you?
A. No, not from -- no. I don't have any photographs related to his life.
Q. Do you plan to use any photographs related to Mr. Dominick Tullo and his life in your testimony?
A. I have not anticipated doing that, so, no, I don't plan to.
Q. What about photographs of the communities where Mr. Tullo lived, do you plan to use any photographs of geographic areas
or neighborhoods where Mr. Tullo lived?
A. I've not researched any, so, no, I don't anticipate using those in this trial.
Q. Would the same be true for Mrs. Katz, you don't have any or don't expect to use any photographs at the Katz trial?
A. The same would be true, right, I don't have any photographs relating to her or her neighborhood. I've been to these places
and kind of grew up in those places, but I don't have any photographs.
Q. So if you're going to provide a picture to the jury, you're going to do it with your testimony as opposed to a photo?
A. Yes.
Q. You told me earlier about the 30-minute phone conversation you had with Mr. Hamer earlier this week. Did Mr. Hamer
provide you with any facts about Mr. Tullo that you didn't find in either the deposition of Mrs. Tullo or in the interrogatory
responses?
A. No.
(Off the record.)
MR. SEXTON:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you mentioned a few moments ago that you might describe the neighborhood in which Mr. Tullo grew
up; is that right?
A. I might, if I'm asked.
Q. Would you describe that neighborhood for us now?
A. You know, he likely grew up in the Cobble Hill, Red Hook section of Brooklyn, and I base that on -- well, they don't know --
I did not see his specific address. He went to a school on Penny Street, PS29. It's a predominantly Italian immigrant, working-
class neighborhood in the 1920s and '30s with most people or many of the men working on the docks as longshoremen being
a principal occupation of people there.
So it's kind of the standard immigrant, early 20th Century New York neighborhood, a lot of working-class people.

23David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
Q. Do you know what Mr. Tullo's parents did for a living?
A. I'm not recollecting what his father did for a living.
Q. Do you know where Mr. Tullo went to school?
A. Well, he went to the public schools in New York.
Q. Do you know what specific school he intended?
A. Well, I know his elementary school was, I believe, PS29.
Q. What about high school?
A. They do mention his specific high school. I'm not recollecting the name of the high school.
Q. Do you know how far Mr. Tullo got in school?
A. I believe he went into high school but did not graduate.
Q. Apart from that neighborhood you just described, do you know whether Mr. Tullo lived in other parts of New York?
A. Yeah. He kind of tracked east. He grew up there. Then later, once they got married, they lived over on Church Avenue.
Pardon me, I mean, I kind of know these places. It's south of the park, south of Prospect Park. Then he moved out to Long
Island, lived in a couple, three places on Long Island before he moved to Florida.
Q. Do you know approximately what years he lived in Long Island?
A. I believe he moved out to Long Island in the '60s and lived there through the '70s, and then I think he moved to Florida in
the early '80s, but I'm not exactly sure on that.
Q. Apart from Brooklyn and Long Island, do you know of any other areas in the state of New York where Mr. Tullo lived?
A. Those are the ones that come to mind.
Q. Do you know what Mr. Tullo did for a living?
A. Oh, gosh.
Q. I don't mean for this to be a memory --
A. Yeah. No. No.
Q. If it's not important to your opinion, you can tell me that.
A. You know, he worked as a shoe-shine boy as a kid, and he had something with the United Nations. It was a little bit difficult
for me to ascertain what exactly he did. So I'm not completely clear on his livelihood.

24David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
Q. Do you know where Mr. Tullo lived after he left New York?
A. Well, I know he ends up in Florida. There may have been some intermediate places later in his life where he lived.
Q. Do you know where in Florida Mr. Tullo went after he left New York?
A. I'm not remembering the specific towns, but somewhere between Hollywood Beach and West Palm, in that general area.
Q. Have you done any research on the specific neighborhoods or areas of Florida in which Mr. Tullo lived?
A. No, I have not.
Q. Have you done any review of the media in the areas where Mr. Tullo lived in Florida?
A. No, not specific for this case.
Q. Okay. Have you, for example, ever reviewed the newspapers or magazines that might have been published in Palm Beach
County, Florida?
A. No. I've not gone through the -- those papers. 0065
Q. What about Lake Worth, Florida?
A. I've not reviewed those papers either.
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Tullo regularly watched television?
A. His wife reports that he would sometimes watch TV when he came home from work because he worked multiple jobs and,
you know, was a busy guy.
Q. Do you know what, if anything, Mr. Tullo liked to watch on television?
A. I didn't get a sense of any particular programs from what I read.
Q. Do you know whether he was a TV news watcher?
A. I don't know either way.
Q. From your review of the multiple volumes of Mrs. Tullo's deposition, do you know what, if anything, Mr. Tullo's family
members and friends told him about the dangers of smoking?
A. There's a discussion of that, discussion of his mother not approving of smoking. I seem to recall that.
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Tullo's wife ever discouraged him from smoking because of its health risks?
A. She does discuss that, yes.
Q. You recall that Mrs. Tullo testified under oath that she repeatedly asked her husband not to smoke because of the danger
to his health?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
25David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. Yes. She -- she describes that in the -- or states that in the -- in the deposition.
Q. Okay. Now, you've never done this in a prior case, but I just want to cross it off my list.
Do you intend to offer any counterfactual history in the Tullo case?
A. Well, only to the extent -- I mean --
Q. Let me tell you what I'm driving at --
A. Yeah.
Q. -- to help you answer the question.
Do you intend to testify in this case that certain -- that Mr. Tullo would have made decisions differently if someone had told
him something different about smoking?
A. I'm not going to give testimony -- my testimony will be consistent with the answers I gave earlier in the sense that I'm not
going to talk about him as an individual and his particular set of knowledge and his particular unique circumstances that are
different from other people.
Q. You're not going to try to predict how history might have been different if certain facts had been changed?
A. For Mr. Tullo's personal history, no. The only reason why I paused -- and this is just for -- you know, this is for clarification
purposes. I did, I believe, in the Frankson versus Brown & Williamson trial, so many years ago, gave testimony as to if -- you
know, if the tobacco industry had kind of changed its policies at an earlier period, what that effect would have been on overall
cigarette-related mortality based on trends and prevalence in quitting, but that was at a population level.
Q. You've never offered that kind of testimony in an Engle case, true?
A. I don't think so. No one's asked me that question. No.
Q. As we sit here today, you don't intend to offer that testimony in the Tullo case, do you?
A. Well, I mean, if they ask me. You know, I mean, if I'm asked the question: Well, Dr. Kyriakoudes, given what we know
about the change in prevalence, particularly in the late 1970s to early '80s, if history had been different, if the tobacco industry
had responded in December of 1953 by, you know, getting out in front and kind of admitting what they knew about the risks of
smoking and maybe engaging in public health campaigns or maybe even stop making cigarettes, you know, would the course
of population of cigarette mortality been different? Well, the answer is, of course, yes.
So something along those lines. I mean, I've never been asked that in an Engle case, and I don't think anyone is gonna ask me,
but if they do, you know, that's the kind of answer I'm going to give, but I can't give that answer for a particular individual.
Q. Do you know what year Mr. Tullo died?
A. I don't know the exact year. It's in the 1990s, I believe.

26David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
Q. Would you agree with me that anything that the cigarette companies said or did after Mr. Tullo died could not have influenced
his decisions regarding cigarette smoking?
A. They couldn't have influenced Mr. Tullo?
Q. Yeah.
A. Yeah, I'd have to agree with that.
Q. All right. And do you know what smoking-related illnesses Mr. Tullo suffered from?
A. Well, I don't know all of them. There may have been multiple. Again, I'm not his doctor, but they discuss lung cancer as
the principal one.
Q. All right. I want to ask you some similar questions regarding Mrs. Katz. Okay?
A. Sure.
Q. What do you intend to say about the neighborhoods or areas where Mrs. Katz lived?
A. She grew up in a different part of Brooklyn, East New York we call it, you know, a very middle class area, kind of upper
-- upper working class.
It was at the time that she was growing up a place that you moved to when your family got enough money, in her case it would
be a Jewish family, perhaps out of the Lower East Side, which was a less desirable place, and so you made a little money and
moved out to East New York.
A little history trivia, Lloyd Blankfein, who was the head of Goldman Sachs, grew up in the same neighborhood. His father
was a postman. How's that for upward mobility?
Q. That's good.
A. Yes. That's the great thing about America.
Q. Do you know what Mrs. Katz's parents did for a living?
A. I don't. I'm not recollecting. No.
Q. Do you know what level of education her parents reached?
A. I don't know her parents' level of education.
Q. Do you know what level of education Mrs. Katz reached?
A. Yeah. She went to high school and graduated.
Q. Do you know what she did professionally over the course of her life?

27David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. Well, I know she held various jobs, like a bank teller, you know, kind of -- you know, average clerical-type -- you know,
everyday-type jobs.
Q. In your 30-minute conversation with Mr. Hamer earlier this week, did he provide any facts for you regarding Mrs. Katz that
you didn't glean from either her husband's testimony or from the interrogatory responses you reviewed?
A. No.
Q. Do you know where Mrs. Katz lived after she left New York?
A. I believe she also moved out to the island and then retired and moved to Florida.
Q. Just to be clear, when you say “the island,” you mean Long Island?
A. Yes. I'm sorry.
Q. I know what you mean, but somebody reading this later might not.
A. No. You're perfectly -- old habits die hard.
Long Island and then to Florida.
Q. Do you know what newspapers or magazines Mrs. Katz and her family read?
A. No, not particularly. That's not important for my opinions.
Q. Do you know where in Florida Mrs. Katz moved after she left the state of New York?
A. If Mr. Tullo was up in the Lake Worth area, then I think they were closer to Hollywood and Broward County, but I don't
know the exact address or the town.
Q. You don't know specifically where Mrs. Katz lived in Florida?
A. I don't. It's not important for my analysis.
Q. That's great.
And similarly, you haven't reviewed any media specific to the locations in Florida where Mrs. Katz lived, such as newspapers,
magazines, television broadcasts, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you don't know specifically what television programs Mrs. Katz liked to watch?
A. I don't know that. And it's not important for me to know.
Q. And specifics of what Mrs. Katz saw, watched, read or heard are not important to your opinions in this case, true?
A. That's correct.

28David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
Q. And do you know if Mrs. Katz is alive or deceased?
A. I believe she's deceased.
Q. Okay. Do you know when Mrs. Katz died?
A. I'm not recollecting the date of her death.
Q. Okay. Do you know when Mrs. Katz started smoking?
A. She started smoking when she was a young woman in the early 1950s or late '40s. For some reason, the early '50s stick in.
She was born in '31, so she might have been in her late teens when she began smoking, late '40s.
Q. Do you know when she quit?
A. That, I don't know.
Q. You've already told us about your knowledge of her brands and brand history, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you don't know why Mrs. Katz chose the various brands that she did?
A. No, I don't.
Q. Okay.
MR. SEXTON: Must have put poor David to sleep.
Let's go off the record just a second.
(Off the record.)
MR. SEXTON:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, do you recall testifying in the Alexander trial earlier this year?
A. I do.
Q. And you were asked a number of questions in the Alexander trial about the history of marketing and advertising as it relates
to cigarettes.
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. I'd like to talk with you about that topic for a moment.
A. Okay.

29David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
Q. One of the advertising methods you talked about is television commercials, right?
A. Yes.
Q. When did the cigarette companies stop advertising on television?
A. Well, you know, they voluntarily offered to pull their ads off of the airwaves -- they made that offer in 1970. They began in
1971. That was later written into law. So 1971 is when the TV commercials stopped.
Q. The cigarette companies have not advertised on television for almost 40 years; is that correct?
A. Not in the commercial format. That's true.
Q. The cigarette companies have not broadcasted television commercials for their product for the last 40 years?
A. That's correct.
Q. And as you mentioned, as a matter of law, cigarette companies cannot advertise cigarettes on television anymore, right?
A. That's correct. And that also applies to the radio.
Q. You anticipated my next question. Cigarette companies stopped advertising on the radio in 1970?
A. Yes. They -- what applied to television also applied to the radio.
Q. So cigarette companies have not advertised on the radio for almost 40 years?
A. That's correct.
Q. And cigarette companies can no longer, as a matter of law, advertise on the radio, true?
A. That's correct.
Q. Another of the historical advertising methods you talked about is billboards, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. When did the cigarette companies stop advertising on billboards?
A. Well, that's one of the provisions that was worked out through the Master Settlement. I believe I've got that right. So billboard
advertising has much more recently fallen by the wayside.
Q. Would you agree that the cigarette companies stopped advertising on billboards in 1998?
A. Yeah. With the MSA. That makes sense. Yes, I agree.
Q. So it's been 12 years since the cigarette companies last advertised on billboards?
A. That's correct.

30David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
Q. And as you mentioned, the cigarette companies stopped advertising pursuant to something called the Master Settlement
Agreement, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. The Master Settlement Agreement was made between the cigarette companies and the attorney generals of various states?
A. Yes. And some territories, too.
Q. Okay. And the terms of the Master Settlement Agreement are binding on the cigarette companies in perpetuity, right?
A. I'm not exactly sure about that. I thought there was a 20-year -- like the documents are up for a certain period of time. I think
the payout for the cash settlement has a certain amount of time to it. You know, certainly for a --
Q. Do you know whether the Master Settlement Agreement specifies a time when the cigarette companies can ever advertise
on billboards again?
A. I don't think it has an expiration date. So I guess it would be in perpetuity. Yeah.
Q. Okay. You agree with me that the terms of the Master Settlement Agreement do not have an expiration date?
A. Yeah, I would agree.
Q. Another historical method for advertising cigarettes were transit ads?
A. Yes.
Q. And transit ads are ads like billboards, only they appear on the sides of buses and trains and taxicabs and so forth, right?
A. That's right. Or maybe in the bus stop kiosk or down on the subways.
Q. And the cigarette companies stopped using transit ads in 1998 as well, right?
A. Right. Same provisions as billboards.
Q. That was pursuant to the Master Settlement Agreement?
A. Yes.
Q. And the cigarette companies can no longer use transit ads, right?
A. That's right.
Q. Another historical method for advertising cigarettes were stadium ads or placards?
A. Yes.
Q. And stadium ads are like billboards, only they appear in and around stadiums for concert and sporting events, right?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
31David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. Right.
Q. I'm sorry, Dr. Kyriakoudes. I missed your answer.
A. I said that's correct. Yes.
Q. And once again, the cigarette companies stopped using stadium ads about 12 years ago in 1998, right?
A. You know, I'd have to -- I mean, I'll accept your representation. I mean, I don't have the MSA in front of me, but that sounds
reasonable, but I'm not exactly sure, but, you know --
Q. You would agree with me that pursuant to the Master Settlement Agreement, cigarette companies can no longer use stadium
ads?
A. That's my understanding, but I'd feel more comfortable if I had the document in front of me and could refresh my recollection.
Q. One of the items on your reliance list is a book by Professor Kip Viscusi called Smoke-Filled Rooms; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. And are you aware -- have you read that book?
A. Yes.
Q. The first half of that book deals with the Master Settlement Agreement, right?
A. It does, yes.
Q. Okay. And so you've familiarized yourself with what Professor Viscusi has written summarizing the Master Settlement
Agreement, true?
A. Right. It's been quite awhile since I read that book.
Q. I understand.
A. Just to --
Q. Okay. And I understand that you can only do your best. So if you want to qualify your testimony in some way based on
your memory, that's just fine.
I've got a couple more categories of advertising I want to ask you about.
Another historical method for advertising cigarettes that you discussed in your testimony is the sponsorship of concerts and
sporting events, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And the cigarette companies have stopped sponsoring concerts and sporting events, true?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
32David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. That's correct.
Q. And the cigarette companies stopped sponsoring those concerts and sporting events pursuant to the 1998 Master Settlement
Agreement, right?
A. Right. But Winston Cup lasted until '03, '04. I forget. So it didn't stop in '98.
Q. There was a phase-out provision for the sponsorship of sporting events; is that your recollection?
A. I believe so.
Q. Okay. But you would agree with me now that the cigarette companies can no longer sponsor sporting events and concerts
anymore?
A. That's my understanding.
Q. Another historical method for advertising cigarettes that you're familiar with is the use of branded merchandise like shirts,
hats or jackets that carries the logo or name of a cigarette brand?
A. Yes.
Q. The cigarette companies stopped giving away branded merchandise pursuant to the Master Settlement Agreement in 1998,
right?
A. I'd have to refresh my recollection of that by reviewing the settlement. You're getting to areas of -- you know, of policy
that I haven't looked at in quite a long time.
Q. Do you intend to testify at the trial of either Tullo or Katz regarding the companies' use of branded merchandise as a mode
of advertising?
A. Perhaps in historical time, back in the period in which the decedents, you know, were engaged in their smoking career, but
not for the more recent period.
Q. As an historical matter, do you know when, if ever, the cigarette companies stopped using branded merchandise as a means
of promotion and/or advertising?
A. As I sit here, I'd have to refresh my recollection by reviewing the provisions of the Master Settlement.
Q. Do you know as we sit here today whether the cigarette companies can still give away or distribute branded merchandise?
A. I believe they cannot. It's just the timing that I'm not exactly sure of.
Q. Sure.
Okay. Is it your brief that the companies can no longer give away or distribute branded merchandise pursuant to the terms of
the Master Settlement Agreement?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
33David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. Well, I mean, I have, for example, within my own -- I mean, I'd have to look into this because I don't know -- I'm not exactly
sure of the answer because I have within my own little personal collection of ephemera R.J. Reynolds Snus cocktail napkins,
you know, which are quite contemporary. I think I picked those up at a bar within the last year.
So, I mean, there's still -- is that merchandise? I don't know. There's still stuff, you know, with the logo on it floating around.
So for this whole line of questioning, I just -- I'm not in the position to give you the kind of authoritative answer that I would
feel comfortable with on what contemporary policy is right now.
Q. Okay. Based on your historical research regarding the Master Settlement Agreement, do you know whether that agreement
contained any provisions regarding cigarette companies' use of or distribution of branded merchandise?
A. Again, I'd just have to refresh my memory, and I haven't anticipated testifying on this aspect of tobacco policy and, therefore,
did not refresh my memory before this deposition.
Q. All right. Let me ask you about another mode of promotion and advertising. Another historical method for advertising or
promoting cigarettes that you talked about at trial is product placement in movies or television, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you know whether the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement prohibited the placement of cigarette products in movies or
television programs?
A. I believe it did. Yes.
Q. Okay. Do you agree that no cigarette company has placed its products in movies or television since the 1998 Master
Settlement Agreement?
A. Well, I'd agree that it's in the Master Settlement Agreement. The second question you ask is one about fidelity to the agreement
and the like, and I have to say I've just not done any research in that area at all, so I wouldn't be in a position to offer an
authoritative answer.
Q. That's fair enough. Let me ask you a different question.
Are you aware as you sit here today of any instance where a cigarette company has violated the terms of the 1998 Master
Settlement Agreement as it relates to the use of product placement in movies or television?
A. I'm not aware of anything because I haven't, you know, attempted to research that subject, so I wouldn't know either way.
Q. You would agree with me that at least under the terms of the 1998 settlement agreement, cigarette companies are no longer
allowed to place their products in movies or television?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you know whether the Parliament brand of cigarettes were ever placed in movies or television?
A. I've -- I've personally not come across any evidence to indicate that Parliament was a subject brand.
Q. What about Marlboro?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
34David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Tell me where Marlboro was placed in movies or television.
A. Well, the very famous example would be the Superman films, where Superman bursts through the Marlboro billboard.
Q. That would be Superman II?
A. I believe it's Superman II, yes.
Q. The worst of the Superman movies?
A. Well, I was --
Q. You don't have to agree. You can tell me if you liked it.
A. No. I'm laughing because I have to say that, you know, I only know those movies really as their role in cigarette history. I
didn't even like them when I was -- when they first came out.
Q. Okay. Apart from Superman II, can you identify another movie or television show where cigarette companies affirmatively
worked to place a Marlboro brand in a production?
A. I have -- you know, I'm trying to remember. I have so many documents in my files. I believe I have some agreements between
the actor Sylvester Stallone, and I believe that's Philip Morris that he signed with. It may be another company.
Q. You're thinking of Brown & Williamson, actually.
A. Maybe I am.
Q. I'm specifically interested in Philip Morris USA and the Marlboro brand.
A. Yeah.
Q. Apart from Superman II, as you sit here today, can you identify another instance where a cigarette company placed a Marlboro
brand in a movie or TV show or production?
A. Right. That's the only one that comes to mind.
Q. And as it pertains to Superman II, do you know what cigarette company it was that arranged to have the Marlboro brand
placed in that movie?
A. Well, I believe it was your overseas branch, Philip Morris International, technically.
Q. You believe -- based on your review of the documents, do you believe it was Philip Morris Europe that made the deal to
place Marlboro in Superman II?
A. Is that what it was called, Philip Morris Europe?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
35David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
Q. Yes.
A. I mean it states on the contract.
Q. You've seen the contract where Philip Morris Europe arranged to place the Marlboro brand in Superman II?
A. Yes. That's in my reliance material.
Q. And you're not an expert on what legal relationship Philip Morris Europe had at the time with Philip Morris USA?
A. That is correct.
Q. Okay. You don't know whether Philip Morris USA had any influence on that product placement?
A. Well, all I know is that they're both Philip Morris, and they're both engaged in selling the Marlboro cigarette.
Q. All right. But you don't know as you sit here today whether Philip Morris had any influence on that product placement,
do you?
A. Well, you know, you have very complicated relationships between, you know, subcompanies and branches and divisions
and the like. Again, I'm not an expert in that, but clearly both companies were invested in selling the same product. They're
both named Philip Morris. So for my purposes as a historian, I treat them as essentially the same entity.
Q. Tell us what influence Philip Morris USA had on the placement of Marlboro cigarettes in Superman II.
A. The data I have is the contract signed by a Philip Morris company, and that's all I know.
Q. That's all you know about what influence Philip Morris USA had, if any, on the placement of Marlboro in Superman II?
A. That's correct.
Q. And are you aware of any evidence as we sit here today that Philip Morris USA ever worked to place a product in a movie
or television show?
A. The only case that comes to mind from the research I've done, Philip Morris is the -- the only document I have is the Marlboro
document for Superman.
Q. And if Philip Morris USA doesn't appear in that document, you'd agree with me that you don't have any evidence of Philip
Morris USA ever working to place a product in a movie or a television show?
A. Well, again, I don't -- you know, this is a distinction that's perhaps important to you but not important to me as a historian.
You know, when I get to the “S” in Philip Morris, I stop.
So clearly it's a Philip Morris company. The nature of the specific relationship doesn't concern me. They're selling the same
product. You know, I guess you can say that it's just mere coincidence, but I'm not that gullable.
Q. Setting aside Superman II, you can't point me to any other documents or evidence that Philip Morris USA ever worked to
place a product in a movie or a television show?

36David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. No. That's the only one that comes to mind from the research I've done.
Q. Okay. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you're aware that President Barack Obama signed historic legislation regarding cigarettes in June
of 2009?
A. That's correct.
Q. All right. That bill was called the Family Smoking Prevention & Tobacco Control Act?
A. That's correct.
Q. Can we call that bill the FDA for short?
A. The FDA bill, sure.
Q. FDA stands for the United States Food & Drug Administration?
A. That's correct.
Q. And the FDA bill made historic changes to the way cigarettes and cigarette advertising are regulated in this country?
A. Yes. It's an important bill. I've not read every part of it.
Q. Have you read parts of it?
A. I've read the news coverage of the bill.
Q. All right. Do you know whether when President Obama signed the FDA bill in June 2009, he gave the Food & Drug
Administration power to regulate the content, marketing and sale of tobacco products?
A. That's right. And my understanding is that some of those provisions are still being worked out through the administrative
law process.
Q. Okay. Historically, you're aware that the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communication Commission had the
power to regulate cigarette marketing and advertising?
A. That's correct.
Q. Now with the passage of the FDA bill, the FDA has the power to regulate cigarette advertising too?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you know whether the FDA can now regulate how the companies describe their products to consumers?
A. My understanding is that they can. For example, the appellation of “light” or “ultralight” and those have been deemed
unacceptable.
Q. Cigarette companies can no longer use terms like “light” or “mild” or “low tar” to describe their products in advertising
or packaging?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
37David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you know whether the FDA can regulate the size, placement, content of the warnings that go on cigarette advertisements
and packages?
A. Yes. I believe so. Yeah. I mean, that's always been a function of government since the warnings were -- cautions and warnings
were mandated.
Q. But the change with the FDA bill --
(Off the record.)
MR. SEXTON: I think maybe there was a disruption in the line when I asked my last question.
MR. SEXTON:
Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, as a historian, do you know how, if at all, the FDA bill changed the remedies available to the federal
government if a cigarette company failed to comply with regulations or laws regarding advertising?
A. That's a pretty recent piece of legislation, and I'm just not that familiar with all the aspects of the bill.
Q. Okay. Do you know what remedies the FDA now has with respect to the power to -- pursuant to its power to control and
regulate cigarette advertising?
A. Well, I know that the Family Smoking Prevention Act, the FDA bill, expanded generally the federal government's authority
over the regulation of all aspects of cigarettes and their sale and marketing by putting it under the FDA umbrella, but I haven't
-- you know, aside from just kind of reading about the bill in the press, I've not made a formal study of its components.
Q. You don't consider yourself a historian of cigarette regulation?
A. I don't consider myself a historian of what happened last year and what's still happening now. You know, I've studied
intensely the regulatory history in the '60s, '70s and the '80s, but we've entered into the realm of contemporary policy that's still
unfolding, and while I follow that as somebody that's generally interested in tobacco control, I've not made a careful study on
this particular piece of legislation, aside from just reading about it in the press.
Q. Would the materials that you have reviewed in forming your opinions about the historical regulation of the tobacco industry
be contained within the universe of the reliance materials that you've previously disclosed and described?
A. Yes. Legislation hearings and the materials in my materials. Yes.
Q. And have you previously offered in the Engle cases your opinions that you've just described regarding the historical regulation
of the cigarette industry?
A. Yeah. I think I discussed the circumstances surrounding, you know, the 1965 act and discussed, you know, the '69 and '84
revisions to, for example, the warnings issued. I've discussed that previously.
Q. Do you intend to offer any opinions at the trial of either Tullo or Katz regarding Professor Kip Viscusi?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
38David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. No, I hadn't anticipated that.
Q. I notice on your reliance list a few of his articles and books. I hadn't seen them before, and I just wanted to ask whether you
had something specific that you were going to say about Dr. Viscusi or his work?
A. Oh. I see. No. No. I read his work. I agree with some of his things. I disagree with others. But, no, I had not anticipated
talking about him specifically. No.
Q. In particular, I saw a letter between Professor Viscusi and an attorney named Barbara Kacir at Jones Day, and I was wondering
if you had any specific opinions regarding that letter --
A. Oh, yeah. That letter -- well, to the extent that -- I'd be surprised if this came up in the trial, but I guess it would only be
relevant if he was testifying in it, which I don't know if he is or not.
What struck me about that letter was, you know, he's circulating his draft of the earlier book, you know, to the attorneys at
Jones Day before he circulates it through the academic audience.
Q. And do you think that impacts upon the credibility of his work and his research?
A. Yes. It was a surprising document and unfortunate. I think it -- it indicates who his primary audience is and who he's really
writing the book for in that he's offering not up as piece of impartial scholarship, but as something really that should be reviewed
by the attorneys in draft, and presumably if they had any suggestions, they would get back to him, and then -- because he's very
careful about saying don't release this to academic audiences, other than release it to the academic peer-review process.
It's a little bit backwards. Usually you send it to the peer-review process, and then you, you know, send it out.
Q. Do you know whether Dr. Viscusi ever received any suggested changes or revisions to that first smoking book of his?
A. No. I only have that one letter, and I haven't -- you know, I don't know what suggestions were made or if any. Do not know that.
Q. And where did you find that letter between Professor Viscusi and Ms. Kacir?
A. I believe I found that in the files of the R.J. Reynolds Company. I should have a Bates stamp on it of some sort.
Q. Do you know whether you found it online at the Legacy Web site?
A. If I didn't find it at the Legacy Web site -- I've had that letter for a while, I think. If I didn't find it at the Legacy Web site, I
found it either at -- at Tobaccodocuments.org. I've had that for a couple of years in my files.
Q. Apart from this 1990 letter we've been discussing, do you intend to offer any other opinions at trial about Professor Viscusi
or his work?
A. No. I mean, I -- I had not anticipated that. It's impossible for me to see how -- I mean, I don't see how it would be relevant
unless I was brought in as a rebuttal to his specific testimony, and I'm not aware that -- that --
Q. I don't believe you've been listed in either the Tullo or Katz case. I was just curious.
A. No. I have no -- it doesn't seem relevant to me.

Q. Okay. Do you know what cigarette company originally made Parliament cigarettes?
A. Gosh golly. I thought Parliament was a Philip Morris brand, but it may go back and --
Q. Do you know whether Parliament was a brand that Philip Morris at some point acquired from another company?
A. They may have, and if they did, I just don't know the details.
Q. And, again, if you don't know and it's not important to your opinions, feel free to tell me that.
A. Yeah. I don't know and it's not important.
Q. Okay. You don't know what year Parliaments were first made?
A. No, I don't know when they were first made.
Q. And you don't know when Philip Morris first acquired the brand Parliament?
A. I don't. Philip Morris has an interesting history, particularly in the '50s where you had the merger of the Benson & Hedges
and Philip Morris.
And so, you know, there's -- there's a complex history there that I have not worked out to the detail of which brands were which.
Q. And that subtle detail is not important to your opinions in either the Tullo or the Katz case, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. What do you intend to say at trial about the Parliament brand?
A. Oh. Just that Parliament was a filter brand, an early filter brand at a time when filters were taking up an increasingly larger
share of the marketplace, that is in the 1950s. You know, they had their niche. They were not ever the leading cigarette, but
they were an important brand. And, you know, I might show a commercial or two from Parliament from the time period. You
know, they had a recessed filter, which was a feature that was prominent in their advertising.
Q. Do you know whether the Parliament brand ever used celebrities in its advertising?
A. Sure. I'm trying to remember the name of the newscaster from 60 Minutes. I'm drawing a blank. Mike Wallace -- it was a
short blank. Mike Wallace pitched Parliaments in the 1950s on TV.
Q. Would the Mike Wallace Parliament advertising be in your reliance list you've already produced to us?
A. I think it's -- I think it's on that DVD. It should be in my large compendium of advertisements.
Q. Can you identify any other celebrities who have been used in Parliament advertising over the years?
A. That's the only one that comes to mind.
Q. Do you know specifically whether Philip Morris ever used movie stars or sports figures to advertise Parliament cigarettes?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
40David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. For Parliament, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if they did. I mean, that was a standard practice at least in the 1950s, but
I'm not recollecting specific celebrities.
Q. As we sit here today, you can't recall Philip Morris using movie stars or sports figures to advertise Parliament?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you intend to offer any opinions at trial about how the design of the Parliament cigarette changed over time?
A. No. It's just important for me to point out that it was a filter cigarette, and beyond that, I will offer no further detail.
Q. Okay. Do you know how the FTC machine measured tar yield of the Parliament brand changed over time?
A. I don't. I'm not familiar with those details.
Q. Same would be true for the FTC machine measured nicotine yield of Parliament?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you know how Parliament market share has changed over time since the 1950s?
A. Gosh. You know, it's -- it's never been a leading brand. It's always been kind of a second-tier brand, and I believe now is
in the category of discount brands.
Q. Do you know whether the popularity of the Parliament brand varies by region in the United States?
A. I haven't looked at any data to that level of detail for that brand.
Q. You don't know whether either New York or Florida would be areas where the Parliament brand was either especially
popular or unpopular?
A. That's correct. I just don't know those figures.
Q. Do you know whether the target audience or market of the Parliament brand changed over time?
A. I don't. I mean, I just -- I don't know that either way.
Q. Do you know whether Parliament was ever a brand that was predominantly marketed to women?
A. I'm not aware of that. I assumed -- what I've seen is that it was a general interest filter brand.
Q. Do you know whether Parliament was a premium brand?
A. Was it premium in the '50s? There was a period of time where it cost a little bit more. I believe that would have been in
the '40s, but -- and it's no longer the case. So whether it was in the '50s or '60s a premium brand, I think it was in there with
the rest of them.
Q. It's your belief or your opinion that Parliament was no longer a premium brand in the 1960s?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
41David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. Well, now it's no longer a premium brand.
Q. You don't know when Parliament shifted from a premium brand to a general brand?
A. I don't.
Q. Okay. And you don't know the specific years that Mr. Dominick Tullo might have smoked Parliament, do you?
A. No. The record's unclear. It's clear he smoked some in the '50s and beyond, but the record's not completely clear. It's just
one of his brands.
Q. And you've already told us you don't know why Mr. Tullo might have chosen the Parliament brand, right?
A. Well, no. I said earlier his wife reports -- I believe she's talking about a period in the late '60s and early '70s that when she
confronted him in one of her confrontations about smoking, he replied that smoking a filtered cigarette, that it's okay.
Q. But you don't know why Mr. Tullo chose Parliament as opposed to another filtered brand, true?
A. That's correct.
Q. Do you know what race Mr. Tullo belonged to?
A. Did you say race?
Q. Race, R-A-C-E, what race he was.
A. He was an Italian-American, and he was the son of Italian immigrants.
Q. What was Mrs. Katz's race?
A. Well, Mr. Tullo would be conventionally understood, you know, by the general cultural conventions at the time to have
been white.
Historians are uncomfortable using the term “race” because we see it as a socially-constructed concept, and that's more
information than we need.
Q. Yeah. That's fine.
A. Ms. Katz would be, you know, a Jewish-American.
Q. Maybe I can short-circuit or shortcut this whole this with this question: Do you intend to offer any opinions in either the
Tullo or Katz cases regarding ethnic marketing?
A. Not in these cases, no. That doesn't seem to be the -- no, not like I think you're probably thinking I'll do what I did in
Alexander, but that was special with the African-American Southern smoker. So those are different.
Q. Absolutely. Let me just clarify that for the record, and then we'll move on.
You don't intend to offer any opinions regarding ethnic marketing in the Tullo case, true?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
42David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
A. No, I don't anticipate -- anticipate that. I mean, these -- both Mr. Tullo and Ms. Katz were part of the general market. Ms.
Katz was a woman, and there's some female market there with Eve, but they were part of the general market to which the
tobacco industry sought to reach with its products.
Q. Okay. I just want to separate the cases for purpose of my question.
First I want to ask you about Tullo, then I'm going to ask you about Katz.
A. Sure.
Q. The first question: You do not intend to offer any opinions regarding ethnic marketing in the Tullo case, true?
A. That's correct. Mr. Tullo was part of the general population that the industry sought to reach.
Q. Okay. And you don't intend to offer any opinions regarding ethnic marketing in the Katz case?
A. My answer would be the same.
Q. Do you intend to offer any opinions in either the Tullo or the Katz cases regarding youth smoking?
A. Well, I mean, to the extent that -- we'll start with Mr. Tullo. To the extent that Mr. Tullo was a working-class youth who
at a very early age is out in the public working, you know, as a shoe-shine boy in the 1930s, and to the extent that that was a
category of person that often started smoking at a very young age, I may describe that if I'm asked.
Now, for Ms. Katz, you know, she's a young woman who picks up smoking at a time when -- in the late '40s, early '50s, when
young women were featured prominently in the marketing, and that was an important component of cigarette marketing. So
that's what -- to the extent that I'm asked questions about that, that's the area that I would cover.
Q. If Mrs. Katz started smoking when she was 17 or 18 years old, would you consider her to have been a youth?
A. Well, she would certainly be a teenager. At 17 and 18, she is at the time not of the age of majority. She could not vote. So,
yeah, she's an adolescent. That would be youth marketing, yeah. That falls within the youth category.
Q. Do you know what the legal smoking age was in New York when Mrs. Katz was 17 years old?
A. I seem to recall that the rule was you might have been able to buy cigarettes at either 16 or 18. I'd have to refresh my
memory on that.
Q. So it's possible to you that Ms. Katz was of legal smoking age when she started smoking in the state of New York?
A. It's possible. Unclear and not particularly significant for my opinions either way.
Q. Whether Mr. Katz, Mrs. Katz or Mr. Tullo started smoking at a time when they were of legal smoking age is not relevant
to your opinions in either the Tullo case or the Katz case?
A. Correct.

43David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
Q. Okay. I'd like to ask you about something that you described in the Alexander trial as a “share of voice” concept. Do you
recall that testimony?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. Okay. And tell us what “share of voice” means.
A. It's a term of art in marketing, which it simply means in any particular market segment and advertising medium, usually
measured in dollars, the amount of money one particular brand or company controls, their share.
You could think of it as market share, but instead of the share for what is sold of the market, it's the share of what they're buying
in that particular advertising market.
Q. So can you calculate the share of voice for a particular cigarette brand at a particular point in time?
A. Yes, you can. If you have the figures on the total expenditure for the brand and for the market in that particular advertising
medium.
Q. Have you calculated the share of voice for any particular cigarette brand at a particular point in American history?
A. Yeah. I mean, these -- you know, I don't have those numbers in my memory, but, yeah, I have. And, in fact, I don't even have
to do those calculations because often the industry marketing departments would do those calculations. And they're reflected
in the historical documentation.
Q. Well, have you actually calculated the share of voice for, say, Marlboro in the 1960s?
A. No. I've not gone through those calculations, but I've seen where Philip Morris goes through and makes those calculations
in their own marketing material.
Q. Do you consider yourself personally qualified to make those calculations yourself?
A. Yes. I possess the skills of addition, subtraction and division. Although, you did trip me once on supply and demand, so
you did --
Q. I wasn't trying to trip you up.
Let me ask you this: Have you specifically calculated the share of voice for a particular cigarette brand at a particular point?
A. No. I haven't actually done those simple calculations myself because they're available by the industry marketing departments
in the historical record.
Q. Are you aware of any scholar who has specifically calculated the share of voice of the cigarette industry generally at a
particular point in history?
A. I mean, it's a commonly used term, and it appears frequently in the marketing literature. I can't think of a particular author
or publication right now, but, you know, it's not a complex concept, and it's one that's employed frequently in people who
discuss marketing.

44David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
Q. Sure. I know it's a marketing concept, but are you able to point at any source that I can look at the calculation of the share
of voice of the cigarette history generally at a particular point in American history?
A. I'm not recalling a particular citation as I sit here.
Q. And you don't intend to give a precise figure for a share of voice for the cigarette industry at any point in American history,
true?
A. Okay. Now you -- we're talking brands earlier. Now you've kind of shifted your question a little bit, and so let me --
Q. Sure. Go ahead.
A. -- let me address that.
To the extent -- see, now what you're asking is something that share of voice is usually not applied to, which is, you know, the
relative level of advertising of the cigarette industry compared to other -- other industries, for example.
Share of voice, I've never seen it used in that context. Usually share of voice is something that's used within a product category.
So you want to know the share of voice of a particular brand compared to the other competing brand, and that's a significant
distinction.
Q. I'm sorry. I mean, I didn't take a single marketing class in college, and I didn't understand it. So --
A. That's okay. But what you're asking me now is do I -- I think what you're asking me now -- and I think this will clarify it
-- do I intend to give opinions as to what the tobacco industry has spent generally advertising its products over historical time
and how has that changed.
Q. Well, I mean, that's actually a different question than the one I asked. And I'm familiar with your testimony regarding how
the industry has spent money over time.
What I was asking -- and I think I understand your answer -- is whether that share of voice calculation can be spread out across
history as a whole. And if I understand your testimony correctly, share of voice actually applies within the industry itself in
particular players or market participants as opposed to the industry as a whole, right?
A. Right. That's generally how the term is employed. And I wouldn't use that language to describe the industry's efforts to
generally market their product compared to, say, for example, other industries.
MR. SEXTON: Okay. Okay. That's very helpful. Let me take a quick look at my notes, and I may be done.
THE WITNESS: Okay. I'll just be waiting.
MR. SEXTON: Dr. Kyriakoudes, I think I'm done for right now. Thank you very much.
THE WITNESS: Okay.
MR. SEXTON: Somebody else may have some questions.

EXAMINATION
BY MR. KEHFUS:
Q. Doctor, this is Jason Kehfus. How are you doing?
A. I'm doing well. Good to hear your voice.
Q. I have a couple questions for you.
A. Okay.
Q. You testified earlier that Mr. Tullo smoked Lucky Strike cigarettes at one point; is that correct?
A. Yeah. That's a name that comes up in the deposition.
Q. Okay. Tell me what you intend to testify about regarding Lucky Strike cigarettes in the Tullo case.
A. Well, I suspect -- I mean, I anticipate discussing the way in which Lucky Strikes were marketed in the late '20s and into the
1930s, perhaps showing some Lucky Strike advertisements. I think also I would anticipate describing the role of Lucky Strike
on television and radio, for example, your Lucky Strike Hit Parade, which begins in the late 1920s and goes onward or your
Lucky Strike Hit Parade on -- I'm sorry, radio in the late '20s and then its move to television perhaps.
We would show a clip, which I've used many times in my testimony, of Frank Sinatra on the Lucky Stripe Hit Parade, things
like that.
Q. You mention how -- testified regarding how Lucky Strike cigarettes were marketed in the '20s and '30s. Can you explain
that to me?
A. Yeah. I would, you know, show the print advertisements and show -- well, for the '20s and '30s, I would show the print
advertisements for major magazines and the like, and then for the later period perhaps show some of the video.
Q. But you agree, you will not be giving the opinion that any Lucky Strike advertisement had any impact on Mr. Tullo's
smoking, do you?
A. Well, again, you know, the answer is the same that I always give to this question, which is I can't identify a particular
advertisement that affected in this case a particular person, Mr. Tullo, at a particular point in time.
The way this works is it's part of a broader effort to persuade Americans to smoke first and then to smoke Lucky Strikes secondly
and that this helps kind of transform, shape and direct the emergence of the cigarette culture in the United States.
Q. My question is a little bit different. Will you be giving the opinion at trial that Mr. Tullo and his smoking behavior was
influenced or impacted by any cigarette advertising?
A. Well, you know, I can't testify as to what transpired within his thought processes, but I can testify as to what was happening in
the broader culture and the broader general population and to the extent that Mr. Tullo was part of that community of the general
market for which the tobacco industry was marketing towards. It did impact him as it impacted, you know, many millions of
people in persuading people that smoking was fun, delightful, you know, etcetera, etcetera.

46David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
So it's a -- it's a fine distinction, but it's an important one because I can't say exactly what affected him as an individual separate
from these broader groups. I'm not his biographer, but I can talk about what was happening in the United States as cigarettes
were marketed.
Q. So just to wrap this up, any opinion you give on cigarette advertising and its impact would be the opinion relevant to the
general population but would not be relevant to Mr. Tullo and his specific smoking behavior; is that correct?
A. It would be relevant at a population level, but, you know, it's up to the jury to decide as to whether he fits within that category.
Again, I can't -- I can't disaggregate Mr. Tullo or any other decedent from these general patterns.
Q. In any of the evidence that you looked at, specifically for the Tullo case, did you see any evidence that Mr. Tullo's smoking
behavior was impacted or affected by cigarette advertising?
A. Well, again, my answer would be the same. I mean, he as, you know, a member of the general public to which people were
being -- to which cigarettes were being marketed to -- I mean, you know, his wife -- for example, the reported -- the stated
opinion that, you know, the filters were somehow safer, that certainly would be part of -- that would be evidence of an impact.
So that would be an example.
Q. The statement that filters are safer is evidence of the impact of cigarette advertising; is that your testimony?
A. Yeah. In the sense that, you know, filters were marketed as essentially a fresher, cleaner alternative to an unfiltered cigarette,
that industry marketing played on the belief that filters would remove what was harmful, industry statements indicated that if
something was harmful a filter would take it out, and so then, you know, if a person comes up and says, well, I think a filter
is safer, you know, I can connect those two.
But, again, you know, I don't have the data to have insight into the specific statements that are leading to specific changes in
belief in Mr. Tullo's mind separate and apart from what is happening in the broad currents of history.
Q. We don't know where Mr. Tullo heard this statement that made him believe filters were safer, do we?
A. I can't put him listening to any particular statements at particular points of time. All I can do is show the statements that
were made.
Q. And to be fair, there were several sources in the 1950s saying that cigarette filters were safer; isn't that true?
A. That is true.
Q. It wasn't just -- in other words, the public health community in the 1950s were issuing statements saying filters with cigarettes
were an alternative to those who did not choose to quit smoking?
A. Some people were saying that. Yes.
Q. Okay. In the public health community?
A. Yes.
MR. KEHFUS: Okay. Okay. Those are all the questions I have, Doctor. Thank you very much. Have a good weekend.
THE WITNESS: You, too. Thank you.

MS. FISCHER: I have no questions.
EXAMINATION
BY MR. PATRICK:
Q. This is Mr. Patrick. I just have a few.
You were asked a question about the smoking age, and I think it was specifically related to New York. Do you remember that?
A. Yes.
Q. Are you aware that historically the age of smoking throughout the United States has been 16 years of age?
A. Yes. 16 is the median age. And it's important to point out that means that half of people who become regular smokers were
under 16.
MR. KEHFUS: I want to object to the form of that last question.
THE COURT REPORTER: Who objected, please?
MR. PATRICK:
Q. So the legal age for drinking back in the '50s was -- prior to the Vietnam War was 21 in most states, correct?
A. That correct.
MR. KEHFUS: This is Jason Kehfus. Object to the form.
MR. PATRICK:
Q. Isn't that true?
A. That's correct. 21.
Q. And as a result of the Vietnam War that the drinking age in some states was lowered to 18?
MR. KEHFUS: Object to the form.
MR. PATRICK:
Q. Is that your understanding?
A. Yeah. Well, yeah. Drinking ages were lowered in the 1970s to 18 and then raised back up again in the 1980s.
Q. All right. So they learned from their experience and raised the drinking age back to 21, correct?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
48David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
MR. KEHFUS: Object to the form, leading.
A. That's right. In the late 1980s -- actually mid '80s, in most states, drinking ages went back up to 21.
MR. PATRICK:
Q. So do you have any knowledge or have you gotten any literature that talks about the tobacco industry's influence on the
legislature to get the smoking age at the age of 16 rather than 21?
MR. KEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. Well, I don't know of specific studies related to that particular issue.
I do know that the age for smoking cigarettes has always been lower than the age -- almost always been lower than the age for
alcohol consumption, at least under the historical period that's relevant for these two cases.
And the other issue, too, is that there's an issue of enforcement. Historically, underage smoking or smoking age enforcement
has been weak or nonexistent. So to a degree, the age of smoking -- I'm sorry, to a degree, the formal legislative age of when
someone could buy cigarettes is essentially irrelevant for understanding smoking prevalence because cigarettes were widely
available. They were distributed and given away for free in four packs and the like. So it's -- it's just not that important.
MR. KEHFUS: I'm going to move to strike everything after “I don't know” as nonresponsive.
MR. PATRICK:
Q. And in terms of the smoking age of 16, assuming that that was the prevalent age during the '50 and '60s for cigarette smoking
in the United States, were the tobacco companies marketing to kids who were 16 years of age based on what you've seen?
MR. KEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. Well, during that time period, I think, you know, the use of sports and entertainment stars and prominent celebrities in
advertisements marketed to the full range of the population.
Also, if you look at a lot of visual ads, you know, rarely -- let me rephrase that. Often it's young people, very young people,
you know, late teenage years. So, you know, as part of the general marketing effort, particularly in the '50s and -- '40s, '50s and
'60s, there is a heavy youth element to the marketing emphasis. Yes.
MR. PATRICK:
Q. Is Joe Camel an example of that?
MR. KEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. From a later time period, yes. From the 1980s, yeah.
MR. PATRICK:
Q. He was a cartoon character, correct?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
49David KATZ, as personal representative of the Estate of..., 2010 WL 6537151...
MR. KEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. Yeah. But cartoon characters were frequently used in the earlier period that we're talking about here. You know, Little
Lucky, for example, was a cartoon character. R.J. Reynolds used cartoons for magic tricks to sell cigarettes, you get a little
free comic book.
There was the -- so cartoon characters are -- Joe Camel is not the first cartoon character to sell cigarettes. Cartoons have a long
history in the marketing of cigarettes, and this is reflected in my reliance documents.
MR. PATRICK:
Q. All right. So you reserve the right to respond to questions relating to the marketing of tobacco products to young people and
children as part of your testimony in these cases?
MR. KEHFUS: Object to the form.
A. Sure. Yeah. I mean, in the ways that I just described. I mean, if that was not clear from my earlier testimony when they were
asking me on the deposition questions -- I mean, I've testified about this frequently, been a common part of my testimony, for
example, in the Martin trial about a year and a half ago.
MR. PATRICK:
Q. All right. So that will be a subject that you may be asked about?
A. Yes.
MR. PATRICK: I have no further questions.
