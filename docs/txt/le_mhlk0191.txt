ELIZABETH COBBS HOFFMAN, PH.D.,
Called as a witness by and on behalf of the Plaintiff, and having been first duly sworn by the Deposition Officer, was examined and testified as follows:
EXAMINATION
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Would you please state your name for the
record?
A	Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman.
Q	Dr. Hoffman, good morning.
A	Good morning.
Q	We're here today for your deposition in
the Cindy Evers matter. The full style of the case is Cindy Evers as Personal Representative of the Estate of Jacqueline Loyd.
Are you aware of that?
A	Yes, I am.
Q	Okay.
And for the purposes of today I'll have to refer to it as the Evers case. I may occasionally call it the Loyd case or refer to Ms. Loyd. It
happens.
If I use it interchangeably, will you know that I'm referring to this case?
A Yes. I might make the same mistake my self.
Q	Fair enough. If I'm specifically talking
about Ms. Loyd, the decedent, for some reason, I'll try and make every effort to make that very clear.
A	Thank you.
Q	You have been deposed previously in an
Engle Progeny case in Hillsborough County; an Engle Progeny case that was pending in Hillsborough County, the Florence Patterson case. Is that correct ?
A	That's correct.
Q	For purposes of this deposition and based
on the restrictions and requirements outlined under the case management order that exists in Hillsborough County, I'm going to do my best to avoid asking you any duplicative questions or requiring you to give duplicative testimony today; okay ?
A	Thank you.
Q	That said, there will probably be times
where I'll have to either refer back to previous
testimony you've given and ask if there have been any differences since that time, or I may have to simply use it as a frame of reference and we'll start from there.
So, again, I will try my best to avoid duplicative testimony, but it may happen a little bit.
A	Okay.
Q	In your previous deposition you and I, in
fact, we went through your qualifications that were based on your CV.
Do you remember that?
A	Yes, I do.
Q	And has anything changed since that time?
A	In my CV you mean?
Q	Yes.
A	No. It hasn't.
Q	Okay.
So your testimony regarding your CV that you gave in the Florence Patterson deposition, nothing has changed since the time you gave that depo s i t i on ?
A	That's true.
MR. BIGGER: Off the record for a second.
(Off the record.)
MR. BIGGER: Back on the record.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	We also talked about how you first were
retained to serve as an expert witness for a tobacco c ompany.
Since the time you gave your deposition testimony regarding your — the first contact and your initial retention as an expert witness, has anything else happened or has anything changed that would affect in any way your testimony that you gave regarding how you were first retained as an expert witnes s ?
A	That testimony would still apply.
Q	It would be the same if I asked you those
same questions?
A Yes, I believe so.
Q	And, likewise, for income that you have
earned serving as an expert witness, if I asked you those same questions about monies that you've earned from service as an expert witness, your answers would be the same today?
A	They would be approximately the same.
Q	Okay.
The same for the other questions I asked you that were related to that about income you
earned from other sources? If I asked you those same questions, your answers would be approximately the same today?
A	I would think so, yes.
Q	Okay.
MR. BIGGER: Let's have this marked as Exhibit 1. What I'm having marked as Exhibit 1 is the Amended Notice of Taking Deposition Duces Tecum in the Evers case.
(Whereupon Exhibit 1 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Let me hand you this.
A	Thank you.
MR. BIGGER: One for Counsel.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	I know you've seen a document that looks
very similar to this because this is almost identical to the Notice of Deposition Duces Tecum that you discussed in the Patterson case.
The only major substantive difference is the case style, that this refers to the Evers case, and there's differences in date and time.
But if you'll turn to the third page, the
final page of the document, there's Exhibit A, and this is the same as what you have discussed previously in the — in your prior case, the Patterson case.
But talking about this case, have you seen this document before?
A	I may have seen it a couple of days ago.
Q	Okay.
A	I be1i eve so.
Q	Previously you discussed a meeting that
you had with attorneys before your prior deposition in the Patterson case.
At that meeting did you also discuss the Evers case?
A	Yes.
Q	Okay.
And is that the first time at that meeting when you saw this document?
A	I be1i eve so.
Q	The questions that I asked you previously
regarding what was communicated at that meeting, if I asked you those same questions today, your answers would be the same?
A	They would be.
Q	Okay.
Going through this Exhibit A, let's just briefly go through here and see what you brought with you here today.
The first item asks for a copy of your most recent CV. You have produced a copy of that previously to us, and you produced another copy at your prior deposition.
Is the copy received at your prior deposition the same?
A	It is the same.
Q	Okay. Did you bring another copy with you
today?
A	Not for you. I have another copy probably
in my own papers.
MS. LINDSAY: I have one.
THE WITNESS: Yes, I have another one.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Okay.
A	Would that be helpful?
Q	Yes. We'll just have that marked —
A	Okay.
Q	— as Exhibit 2.
(Whereupon Exhibit 2 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Again, as we said earlier, I asked you a
number of questions regarding items contained on your CV.
If I asked you those same questions today, would your answers be substantially the same?
A	Yes. They would be substantially the
s ame .
Q	The second item is all facts and data upon
which you base any opinion, and I think Counsel has an objection that they filed to this.
MS. LINDSAY: Right. I'd just like to note for the record that we filed objections to certain requests on this duces tecum, and I will incorporate those by reference.
MR. BIGGER: Duly noted. Can we go off for a second?
(Off the record.)
(Whereupon Exhibit 3 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
MR. BIGGER: We can go back on.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	We have a reliance list that was produced
by counsel for R.J. Reynolds on May 22nd, 2009, in
the Evers case.
Does this reliance list and the documents and film clips, television clips, that it references, does this encompass what — substantially all of your facts and data upon which you base any opinion?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: This is a representative sample of the information that I've collected that leads to my findings.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Okay.
Is there anything else which you would consider facts and data upon which you base your opinions?
A	As I tried to indicate in my last answer,
this is — definitely represents the kinds of evidence I've used to arrive at my opinions.
I think it will represent my findings very well. It doesn't include every last thing I've ever read on the subject, however, because that would be too voluminous, I thought, and, frankly, completely unnecessary because this is adequate, more than adequate, to the case.
Q	Do you know how many documents are
contained —
A No, not offhand.
Q	I'm sorry.
How many documents are contained in your reliance list for the Evers case?
A Not offhand. I'd have to look at the document myself to see what the last number is.
Q	Okay.
But this comprises a representative sample of the facts and data which you believe are relevant and important to your opinions that you're intending to offer in the Evers case?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Is this the same question, essentially? I'm sorry. I don't understand if there's a difference.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Well, you said that this is merely a
What I'm asking you is: When you chose that representative — when you chose these documents, film clips, videos for the representative sample, did you feel that these were the most important, or was there some sort of a — let me ask it this way.
Was there some quantitative decision that was made by you — excuse me. Was there some qualitative decision that was made by you that these documents were better or more important, however you want to think about it, than the other documents which you have seen and read and on which you may base your opinion but you didn't include on this list?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think you're asking if I thought these were the most important of all the documents ?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	That's essentially what I'm asking you.
A	Thank you.
I don't think that these are necessarily the most important. They are representative, and they're good representations of the evidence that I found overall.
So there would be some others I could substitute if we wanted to look at, say, the Tampa Tribune for a particular series of dates or something. I would have more articles from, say, that newspaper and pretty much any newspaper on the list.
Or the same with textbooks. I might have other textbooks from other parts of the country that could be included, but I chose these ones because they seem very typical.
So there wasn't a qualitative difference in the validity of the evidence.
Q	In creating this representative sample,
did you take steps to ensure that the same balance of information that was available in the public domain is contained in this representative sample?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Are you saying — sorry.
Are you asking do I think that this is a balanced s amp1e ?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Well, typically, when you take a sample,
you want to ensure that it adequately represents the population from which you drew the sample.
If you're sampling everyone in this room and you only ask the men instead of the women, you're going to get a skewed sample from the population that you're drawing from.
A	I have to agree with you there.
Q	Right.
So I'm asking you when you did this or
when you prepared this representative sample, did you take any steps to ensure that you were including, in fact, a representative sample, an accurate sample of all the information that was available in the public domain?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I did take great pains to look at individuals in a variety of circumstances from a variety of backgrounds in producing the s amp1e.
That said, again, I want to make clear I'm not a pollster, so I wouldn't have a methodology which has a mathematical certainty that you've asked an adequate number of people something.
Of course, I have conducted no polls myself. But I did very carefully select these to make sure that they were representative of the communities in which Cindy Evers grew up and then lived out her life. Not Cindy Evers. I just did it myself. I'm sorry. In which Jacqueline Loyd grew up .
MR. McCLURE: Brent, excuse me one second. Can to just have — to cut down on the
interruptions, can we just have an agreement that an objection by one is an objection by all?
MR. BIGGER: I was just going to say that. I saw Annie looking at me. So I was just going to say that. An objection for one defendant is good for all defendants, unless there's some reason you feel it's otherwise necessary to object on your own .
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Did you specifically exclude any sources
of information that were available in the public doma in?
A	No .
Q	So it's your testimony today that this
representative sample includes sources of information — strike that.
It's your testimony today that this representative sample includes information from all sources that contain publicly available information?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No. To say that something is representative or a good sampling is not to claim that it's entirely comprehensive. It's as comprehensive as I could make it, as comprehensive as it seemed necessary to me in my professional j udgment.
So I did not specifically try to exclude
something that I thought would be widely available to the publi c.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Well, did you include any advertisements
from the tobacco companies in this reliance list?
A No. There are no advertisements from the companies on the list.
Q	Those advertisements were widely
disseminated and publicly available?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Those tobacco advertisements were widely
disseminated, were they not?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No, not always they weren't.
For example, after 1971, there were no advertisements on radio and TV, which is one of the best medium — media in the United States for distributing information. So they weren't in there, for example.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Okay.
Before 1971 they were available on television, weren't they?
A	That's correct.
Q	And after 1971 tobacco advertisements
still appeared in print media, didn't they?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, they did but -BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	And they appeared — sorry. And they
appeared on billboards?
A Yes. There were some on billboards up until a certain moment.
But one thing to remember is that the volume was still nonetheless very small.
For example, in newspapers they were approximately one percent or less of all advertising in newspapers through much of the period that I've looked at.
So — in other words, 99 percent of all the other ads that a person would have seen would have been about other things.
If I wanted to try to show you what readers saw, then I might include ads for cars or refrigerators and things so that you could get a sense of the context of the advertising. But in that sense I wouldn't agree with you that they were prevalent, widely disseminated in such a way that people would be — see them in almost any media that
they were looking at.
Q	Did you include articles on subjects other
than smoking and health in your reliance list?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, I did.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	What subjects?
A	I'm sorry. This is coming to mind because
of my prior deposition. There was a question about toilet paper in that deposition. So I couldn't remember yesterday why there was something on toilet paper because, if you have 5,000 exhibits, you just don't remember the titles of every one.
So I went back and looked at that, and it wasn't about toilet paper. Pardon me. It was about toilet paper and it wasn't about smoking and health. So that would be an example.
Q	I think that article you were referring to
is titled "A Frank Discussion on Toilet Tissue" from the Seattle Times.
A	I think that's the approximate title, yes.
Q	I confess I have not gone through here to
determine if that same document is in the 4,300 something documents that are in your current reliance list for the Evers case. So I'm not going
to ask you any questions about that, obviously.
What I was asking you is that you said if you were going to include advertisements, you would feel it necessary to include advertisements for other products or for other — from other subjects in order to show that there was — that was the appropriate representative balance of information out there in the advertising world.
I'm asking you did you include any articles on subjects other than smoking and health in here in order to show that these smoking and health articles that appeared, while they seem voluminous and extensive in the reliance list where they're listed in numerical order, 4300 of them, they may not seem quite as voluminous and extensive if you consider them in the context of all the other articles that appeared in all of these publications for the last 40 or 50 years.
Did you include any other articles on subjects other than smoking and health in your reliance list?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: So in that statement all I'm answers is did I include anything which is —
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	That was the question I asked you.
A	That was the last question too, wasn't
it?
Q	That was the question I asked you. I just
needed you to understand where I was coming from in order to avoid confusion. That's all.
A	Okay.
MS. LINDSAY: Do you understand the
que s t i on ?
Or do you mind asking the question?
Because I'm going to have to object because we lost the que s t i on.
MR. BIGGER: Sorry. Okay. Objections to f orm is fine.
MS. LINDSAY: Okay.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Do you understand the question?
A	I would appreciate it if you would mind —
wouldn't mind repeating just the last phrase, the actual question.
Q	Did you include, purposefully include,
materials on subjects other than smoking and health in your reliance list?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Let me clarify that because I think you asked that question.
And let me say, for example, the only example that's coming to mind was "The Frank Discussion of Toilet Paper," which I do believe is on the Evers list as well.
And that was actually an ad and I — it was not per se about toilet paper. I mean, pardon me. It was not per se about smoking.
But the use of the term Frank Statement is what had originally drawn my attention to that. So I felt there was a parallel and a connection to the topic of smoking and the hazards of smoking.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Was that "A Frank Discussion on Toilet
Tissue," was it a full page advertisement?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I can't remember, again, if it was a half page or full page. It was a significant size advertisement because it had a lot of type in it like the one that the tobacco companies had paid for. So it had to be large enough for the reader to read a fair amount of type .
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	And you included the reference to the
Seattle Times. Do you know if it appeared in over 400 newspapers?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Do you know if the article "A Frank
Discussion on Toilet Tissue" appeared in over 400 newspaper s ?
A	I didn't try to ascertain that so I don't
know the answer.
As you know there were other frank statements on the list also about other subjects, like going bald.
Q	Do you know if the article frank
discussion or the advertisement "A Frank Discussion on Toilet Tissue" contained a statement that the toilet tissue manufacturers do not believe their product to be injurious to human health?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't recall that being in the advertisement, except it did warn that it's rough.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Just trying to gauge where the parallel
was.
No. 3 asks for — on this Exhibit 1 asks for all documents and other material of any sort you refer to or relied on to arrive at opinions or conclusions concerning the issues involved in the Evers case.
A	Is this No. 4?
Q	No. 3.
A	I'm sorry.
Q	No. 3 is essentially a more limited same
about No. 2. We're looking specifically for the materials you referred to or relied upon.
I presume, again, your reliance list, which we've marked as Exhibit 3, is a document or some documents that are responsive to that request?
A	Right. Some. Again, a broad, very
comprehensive representative sample.
Q	Subject to your previous qualification
that this is a representative sample and not the universe of documents which you ever read or which you may rely on and so on.
A	That's correct.
Q	Is there anything else that you brought
with you today that is responsive to request No. 3?
A	No .
Q	Okay.
No. 4 asks —
A	Wait. I'm so sorry. I'm incorrect there,
because I did bring additional research that I had done the last week or a couple weeks on 4-H.
So this would be the time I should give that to you?
Q	Yes. This is the mysterious various 4-H
materials that are referenced in your reliance list?
A	I don't think —
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't think 4-H is very mysterious, but these are the documents.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Let me qualify. I say it's mysterious
because when I received the DVD containing the documents and I clicked on the item entitled "Various 4-H materials," there was nothing there except for a page that said "various 4-H materials." So that was the basis for my offhand comment that they're mysterious. We've received them for the first time today.
These documents, however, you feel that you rely upon in rendering your opinions in this
case?
A	These are documents that I will rely upon.
Q	Do you know how many pages of documents
are here ?
A	No, I'm sorry, I do not.
Q	When did you compile these materials?
A	Over the last two to three weeks.
Q	I said this yesterday as well. But if
you need to take a break at any time, just let me know .
A	Thank you.
Q	How did you compile these materials?
A	Well, for example, I went to Washington,
DC. I initially looked up the location of the national 4-H, and I determined that they are located in Washington.
But then I also found out through phone calls and, you know, calling people that they did not have archives of their own documents. And so I would have to go to the National Archives and Records Administration, but that's in College Park, which was nearby. So that's one of the places I went to get them.
Q	College Park, Maryland?
A	Correct.
Q	Okay. Just making sure I'm thinking of
the correct College Park.
So you went to College Park, Maryland, and went through the archives of the 4-H organization?
Do I understand that correctly?
A	That's approximately correct. They're
actually the Department of Agriculture's records which — under which 4-H is organized.
Q	How are those records maintained?
A Very carefully in temperature-controlled vaults.
Q	I was going to ask. Like newspapers, are
they on microfilm or are they maintained just as paper copies?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Do you understand my question?
A	I do. These records are maintained as
paper copies at this point. I can imagine that they are perhaps elsewhere available on microfilm. A few of them might be. But the ones I looked at were all on paper.
Q	So how did you — is there an index?
A	An index to these papers?
Q	Yes.
A	A partial index. Again, they're grouped
under the record group 33 of the National Archives, which is the Department of Agriculture, and under the Department of Agriculture there's a section called the extension, Farm Extension, and under Farm Extension is 4-H.
So you have to go through a series of winnowing processes, and then you eventually come to the correct set of records, which I found with the aid of a researcher there.
Q	What I'm trying to find out is: Is there
a card catalog or did you simply have to start opening boxes and try and go through the paper documents ?
A No. There is not a card catalog but what they call — I'm not sure if it's a reference guide. Actually, there's a phrase I'm just not remembering at the moment that you use at the National Archives.
But, yes, I could find that out ahead of time so that — for example, a call slip was waiting for me when I arrived so as to make best use of my time, and then I merely had to call up the correct boxes.
But, even then, you are presented in the end with about 30 boxes. So it takes time. You do
have to go through each box.
Q	So you went through 30 boxes?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Not entirely. The last couple of boxes the archive closed and I had to leave.
But one reason why they were the lowest on my list is I thought they were the least likely to have information or that the information they contained would be duplicative.
And, in fact, by the end of the day I was finding that they were duplicates in the last few boxes. So the fact that I didn't get to the last two I didn't think was a problem.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Were you looking for national publications
from the 4-H organization?
A	Yes .
Q	Did you look for any local or regional
publications?
A	Yes .
Q	Which regions or locations?
A Any regions or locations.
Q	So you didn't look specifically at regions
or locations where Ms. Loyd lived?
A	The documents were not grouped by region
because 4-H is a national organization. So documents that are generated locally go up to the national branch is how I understand it.
Q	Okay. I think I understand what you're
saying.
They're not maintained in such a way that you could look, for example, at Michigan documents?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Or are they ?
A	Well, I could find Michigan documents, and
I believe I did. I can't remember if it was Michigan or Minnesota. But I think — actually, now that I think about it, it was Michigan, because both Michigan and Florida had very strong 4-H health programs, and that's there in some of the documents you have, which was interesting, of course, particularly because Mrs. Loyd lived in both states.
Q	One of the H's is health.
A	That's correct.
Q	Right ?
A	(Witness nodded head.)
Q	What I was asking is: The documents, are
they stored in the boxes in such a way that all Michigan materials would be in one or two — however many boxes it may be — but they're stored together?
A No, they're not stored in that way.
Q	Okay.
Was anything that you read in these 4-H materials in any way different from the other materials that are contained on your reliance list as far as the messages regarding smoking and health?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: They were not substantially
di f f erent.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Okay. Anything else under No. 3?
A No. I believe that's all.
Q	No. 4 asks for reports, summaries,
impressions and evaluations related to these cases, generally, in the specific case, the Evers case, which is identified in the style of this notice.
Did you bring any documents with you which you feel are responsive to request No. 4?
A	Yes, I did.
Q	What did you bring with you?
A	I brought two sets of documents. The
first are my handwritten notes on the depositions and the plaintiff's verified worksheet or fact sheet.
MR. BIGGER: We'll have this marked as
Exhibit 4.
(Whereupon Exhibit 4 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	What was the other item you brought with
y ou ?
A	I also brought some typewritten notes that
I made for myself. So this wasn't a formal report nor is it meant to be fully comprehensive. It's just the things I thought of as I was reading.
Q	Would you view this as essentially a
summary of your opinions in this case?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	I'm just trying to determine why you think
it's responsive to request 4. Which of those four categories would you place this typewritten document in?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I would place this document
in the category of impressions under No. 4 on your list.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Okay.
MR. BIGGER: And we'll mark this
Exhibit 5 .
(Whereupon Exhibit 5 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	During your prior deposition there was
some questioning about your methods and your note taking process.
If I asked you those same questions about this case, would your answers be substantially the s ame ?
A	I'm afraid I don't remember those
questions well enough to answer.
Q	Well, your handwritten notes appear to be
notes that you kept after reviewing some depositions in thi s case.
Is that correct?
A	That's correct.
Q	And these deposition notes reflect all the
depositions that you've read that relate to this
case?
A Yes. They reflect all the depositions that I've read.
Q	That relate to this case; right?
A	That relate to this case.
Q	There aren't any depositions you've read
that you didn't take notes on?
A	I don't believe so.
Q	Are there any depositions you requested
that you haven't yet received?
A	No. Not — no.
Q	And you've read all the depositions you
did receive?
A	Yes, I have.
Q	Did you specifically request each of these
depositions from counsel for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company or did they simply send these to you for you to read?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: There are two questions in that. Could you break them up for me?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Sure .
Did you request these depositions from counsel for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?
A No. I didn't request these specific depositions because I didn't know the names of some of the individuals.
Q	So you requested, similar to your prior
deposition, family, friends, coworkers, anybody who the decedent may have encountered over the course of her lifetime who has had their deposition taken?
A	Yes. That's what I asked for.
Q	Is that a broad enough way to describe it?
A Yes. I appreciate that.
Q	Okay.
Anything else you feel is responsive to
No . 4 ?
A	No .
Q	Okay.
MR. BIGGER: Let's mark these as well, the documents that you brought in. I'll have these marked as Exhibit 6, the various 4-H materials.
(Whereupon Exhibit 6 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	I'm going to skip over request 5, 6 and 7
that talk about communications or documents that have been transmitted between yourself and counsel
for the tobacco companies.
Are there communications, such as e-mails or faxes, that have transmitted — been transmitted between you and counsel for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?
A	Yes .
Q	Okay.
And are there documents that you have provided to counsel for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company related to this case?
A	Yes. For example, the 4-H documents that
we just talked about.
Q	Okay.
Did you give them copies of your typewritten report? I'm sorry. Your typewritten impr es s i on s ?
A	Yes, I did.
Q	Did you give them copies of your
handwritten notes?
A	Yes, I did.
Q	Looking at No. 8 which requests documents
that reflect the scope of your employment in these cases generally, in the Evers case specifically, your general litigation experience as — references work performed for plaintiffs and defendants and an
approximation of a portion of your involvement as an expert witness based on percentage of hours or number of hours or income derived from serving as an expert witness.
We have the disclosure that you — excuse me — that counsel for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company provided in this case.
MR. BIGGER: I'm going to have this marked as Exhibit 7.
(Whereupon Exhibit 7 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	I'll hand it to you. It has some — the
yellow highlighting apparently came through somewhat from the document we had. I had copies. So I apologize if there's some highlighting on there.
MR. BIGGER: We can certainly substitute in a clean copy after the deposition is over with if that's fine with counsel.
MS. LINDSAY: That's fine.
MR. BIGGER: Okay.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	I asked you some questions about this in
your prior deposition. If I ask you those same
questions today, would your answers be substantially the same?
A	I'm sorry. I don't remember the specific
questions.
Q	Okay. I'll try and go through it again
without too much difficulty.
If you look at the last page of this document, page 3 under the section entitled "Fees and Sworn Testimony in Other Legal Matters" —
A Yes, I see that.
Q	— we've already talked about your income
in questions that you were asked previously about income you've earned so I'm not going to ask you about those.
Your past litigation experience has been for defendants. You've never served as an expert witness for plaintiffs.
Is that correct?
A	Not in this — no, not in this matter or
any other.
Q	Have you ever served as an expert witness
in anything other than tobacco litigation?
A	No. Not in a courtroom.
Q	Have you served as an expert witness in
something — in cases that were not involved with
tobacco litigation in a consulting capacity?
A	I'm —
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: It seems very broad. I'm trying to be very correct.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Why don't you explain your answer a little
further.
A	A11 right.
If you mean serving as an expert, for example, I served on the Historical Advisory Committee to the U.S. State Department, and I was in the capacity of an expert when I was there, but it wasn't a legal matter. Well, it could be a legal matter, because they're appointed by Congress. But it wasn't about a lawsuit of any type mostly.
I only say that because sometimes historians will sue the state department to have records released. I was an expert there but not in the same way that I am in this case.
Q	You understand — and if you don't, please
understand when I'm referring to an expert witness, I'm talking about your service as an expert witness in litigation.
Have you served as an expert witness in
litigation in any cases other than tobacco 1 itigation?
A No, I have not.
Q	And all of your service as an expert
witness in tobacco litigation has been for def endant s.
Is that correct?
A Yes, it has.
Q	And I think in your prior deposition you
indicated that you have not served as an expert witness in litigation during the past five years.
Is that correct?
A	I have not been deposed or been in court
in the past five years.
Q	Okay.
You haven't been disclosed, to your knowledge, as an expert witness? And by "disclosed" I'm referring to a circumstance under which you would be deposed or testify at trial.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't feel fully qualified to answer that because I do believe that, as I gave you a long list yesterday of cases that I've been asked about, it may be the case that I've been disclosed in one or more others of those that I'm
just not recalling.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	That's correct. And you remind me that
you did yesterday or you did in your prior deposition indicate that you have served as an expert witness in two cases in New York in the last few years.
Is that correct?
A	For example, yes, that's correct.
Q	Okay.
Other than those cases, have you served as an expert witness in any other cases in the last five years? And, obviously, other than the Patterson case in which you are serving as an expert witnes s .
A	The same answer would hold. I am working
on several cases, and I don't know at this moment which ones I've been named in.
Q	Do you have another copy of the list that
you produced in your prior deposition?
A	I may. I produced it yesterday. I'm not
entirely sure I still have it here today.
Q	If you don't, it's okay. I think I've got
a copy, and we can have a copy made during the break. Okay ?
A	Here we go.
MR. BIGGER: We'll just have this marked as Exhibit 8.
(Whereupon Exhibit 8 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	This list is limited to Florida cases. Is
that correct ?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, as I understand it.
Some of those plaintiffs lived in other states, but I believe the cases are only being held in Florida. BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Is it your understanding that each of
these cases is what's known as an Engle Progeny case?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I'm not -- I'm not entirely certain that they're all Engle Progeny cases.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Okay.
A	They're all in Florida. That much I know.
Q	In your prior deposition we discussed the
Engle class action. If I asked you those same
questions, would your answers be substantially the s ame ?
A	I believe so.
Q	Okay.
And in your prior deposition we talked briefly about what has become referred to as the Engle Progeny cases, which Evers is an Engle Progeny case.
If I asked you the questions that were asked in that prior deposition about Engle Progeny cases, would your answers be substantially the s ame ?
A	Yes, I believe they would be.
Q	Okay.
Nonetheless, these cases are all pending in the state of Florida.
A	That's correct. Well, I think one was
dismissed or something.
Q	Okay.
Well, aside from that one, these cases were all filed in the state of Florida.
A	I believe so.
Q	Are there any cases in which you are
serving as an expert witness currently that have not been filed in the state of Florida?
MR. BIGGER: Let me reask that. I derailed there.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Are there any cases in which you are
serving as an expert witness that are not Florida cases?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No -- I'm not currently involved in any other cases other than the ones on that list.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Nothing in California?
A Not at this moment.
Q	Nothing in New York?
A Not at this moment.
Q	And nothing in any other state?
A	No .
Q	Okay.
This document that we had marked as Exhibit 8 doesn't exactly request 9 on the Notice of Deposition Duces Tecum, which asks for a list identifying all cases in which you have testified at deposition or trial for the five years preceding the date of this notice.
I believe your testimony previously was that you have not been deposed or testified at trial in the past five years, other than with the one exception being the Patterson case in which you gave a deposition recently.
Is that still correct?
A	That's still correct. I have not been
deposed or testified at trial in any case in the last five years.
Q	Okay. Other than that case?
A	With the exception of Patterson.
Q	Okay.
And No. 10 on this document requests copies of all time records — and by "this document" I mean Exhibit 1 — copies of all time records reflecting the time you spent on these cases.
Did you bring copies of your time records for your time on the Evers case?
A	I believe I gave you that yesterday.
Q	Okay.
A	But I suppose I could give it to you
again. Would you like it?
Q	By "it" you're referring to a document
that you disclosed in the Patterson deposition?
document.
Q	Okay.
A	But --
Q	So do you break down your — well, you
keep track of your time that you spend on your service as an expert witness.
Is that correct?
A	Yes. I keep time notes.
Q	You keep time records?
A	Right.
Q	Okay.
Do you break down those time records for the particular case on which you’re working?
A	S ome t ime s.
Q	Okay.
Do these documents which you’ve just handed to me at any point break down the time you spent working on one case versus another?
A	Yes. Some of them do that.
Q	Okay.
So this or these documents represent the amount of time you have spent working on the Engle Progeny cases that are contained on the list which we marked as Exhibit 8.
Is that correct?
THE WITNESS: The time records relate to — yes, the time I've spent working on these cases.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	You may not have necessarily worked on
every case on this list as reflected in these time records. But it was certainly cases or a case or — strike that.
These records reflect time you spent working on one or more of the cases on this list, Exhibit 8 .
Is that correct?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: That reflects the time I spent working on one or more of these cases, yes.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Okay. That's what I asked you. So the
answer i s ye s ?
A	Yes, it was.
Q	Okay.
MR. BIGGER: We'll mark this as Exhibit 9.
(Whereupon Exhibit 9 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
THE WITNESS: Are we done with this document so I can give it back to you?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Yes. We'll put it back in the pile.
A Would you like this one back also?
Q	You can hang on to that.
A	Okay.
Q	We can look at it now.
If you'll look at Exhibit 7, which was the disclosure that was provided to us by counsel for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company at the time at which you were disclosed as an expert witness in the Evers case.
Do you recognize this document?
A	Yes, I do.
Q	In your prior deposition you were asked if
you prepared this document, and I believe your testimony was that you — it was the product of your communications with the lawyers.
Is that correct?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I helped to create the
document.
BY MR. BIGGER:
your opinions and the items contained in this disclosure with the lawyers for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and they typed up this document.
Is that correct?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: It was a result of sharing my opinions. Yes, that was one part of it, having that kind of conversation.
And also I think some of this was taken from my curriculum vitae.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	You didn't type this document, though?
A	No, I didn't type it.
Q	Okay.
I believe you earlier stated or you previously stated that you reviewed it before it was filed, though.
A	Yes, I did.
Q	You made sure everything in here was
correct ?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: To the best of my ability,
yes .
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Sure .
Under "Subject Matter of Expert Testimony" there are essentially three sentences which are broad categories of the opinions that you intend to offer in this case.
Is that correct?
A	I see this note — see three sentences
but — I see three clauses in this one sentence in the middle, if that's what you mean, yes.
Q	Let's look at the first sentence under
"Subject Matter of Expert Testimony."
A	Okay.
Q	It says,
"Dr. Hoffman is expected to testify about the vast amount of information communicated and available to the public —"
And I apologize. This says "including Florence Patterson." The one that was filed in the Evers case says "including Jacqueline Loyd."
MR. BIGGER: And, if it's all right with Counsel, we'll just substitute in the correct one. MS. LINDSAY: That will be fine.
MR. BIGGER: Okay.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	But, otherwise, the document is
substantially the same. So let's start over again.
"Dr. Hoffman is expected to testify about the vast amount of information communicated and available to the public, including Jacqueline Loyd, from a wide variety of sources concerning the health risks of cigarette smoking."
Is that the opinion you still intend to offer in this case?
A	I expect to testify that there was a vast
amount of information, yes.
Q	The second sentence reads,
"Dr. Hoffman is expected to testify about the widespread public knowledge during Ms. Patterson's" — and, again, that should be Ms. Loyd's — "lifetime, that cigarette smoking can be hazardous to health, lead to serious diseases, including cancer and premature death, and be habit forming, addictive and difficult for some people to quit."
Do you intend to testify that way?
A	I do .
Q	Okay.
And the third sentence says,
"Dr. Hoffman may also be asked to comment upon the opinions expressed by other witnesses in this matter to the extent they relate to her area of expertise."
As you sit here today, do you intend to comment upon the opinions of any other witnesses that have been expressed in this matter?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I only intend to comment if I'm asked. I mean, that's the intent of the sentence I think.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Let me back up a step.
Have you reviewed the testimony of any other expert witness in the Evers case?
A	No, I have not.
Q	Okay.
The only testimony that you reviewed in the Evers case are the depositions for which you have provided your handwritten notes. Is that
A	That is correct.
Q	Are there anything — is there anything in
your handwritten notes where you intend to comment upon — well, strike that. We don't need to go down that road.
MS. LINDSAY: We've been going close to an
hour .
MR. BIGGER: That's fine. Let's take a
break.
MS. LINDSAY: Do you mind if we take a quick break?
MR. BIGGER: Go off the record.
(Reces s. )
MR. BIGGER: We'll go back on the record. Well, off the record.
(Off the record.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Dr. Hoffman, at your previous deposition
you were asked a number of questions about the reliance materials as far as what you compiled and what you researched on your own.
Do you recall those questions?
A	I recall some of them.
Q	Okay.
receiving materials from other historians. Do you recall those questions?
A	I don't recall the specific wording, but I
recall that you asked about that.
Q	Generally?
A	Generally.
Q	And I think I asked you to identify all
the historians from whom you had received materials and included them in your reliance lists. Do you recall that?
A	Again, I don't remember the specific
wording, but we did talk about — I gave you the names of some of the historians who had helped me.
Q	Well, I think I had asked you I wanted the
names of all the historians who had helped you, and you provided those names.
In the effort to avoid duplication, I'm just trying to see if we can shortcut this.
Did those same historians you identified previously provide you information that's included in the reliance list for the Evers case?
A Yes. The same historians gave me some of those materials.
Q	Okay.
Did any additional historians who have
also worked for the tobacco companies provide you with materials that are included in this Evers reliance list?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Do you understand my question?
A	Are you asking — well, maybe just shorten
it for me, please.
Q	Sure.
You identified and you just stated that the same historians you previously identified as individuals who provided you with materials to include in your reliance list, those same individuals provided you materials that you included in this reliance list for the Evers case. Is that correct ?
A Yes. To — not always exactly but, you know, somebody might have given me something, and I decided not to use it in this case, for example.
But, again, that's substantially correct.
Q	Well, all right. Maybe there's no way to
shortcut this, then.
You testified previously that Dr. Lacy Ford provided you materials from the Tampa Tribune and the St. Pete Times.
Do you recall that?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I recall generally a question about Dr. Ford, yes, and materials I got from him related to Florida.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Did Dr. Lacy Ford provide you with
materials from the Tampa Tribune and the St. Pete Times ?
A	Yes, he did.
Q	Are those materials included in your
reliance list for the Evers case?
A	Yes, they would be.
Q	Did Dr. Ford provide you with any other
materials that you've included in your reliance list for the Evers case?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I believe I got a few public — public health department documents from Dr. Ford as well.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	What are public health department
documents ?
A Well, the state of Florida has a state department of public health. I'm not sure if that's
the exact title, but something to that effect.
And they have a bureau, for example, of chronic diseases which generated lot of information. So I believe I got a couple of documents of that sort from Dr. Ford.
Q	Who provided you with the documents from
the Miami Herald?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't recall offhand who I got those from. I think I might have gotten some from Michael Schaller, but I don't recall.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Did anyone provide you with the documents
from the Jacksonville Journal?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. I got some of those.
I got some for myself and I got some from Michael Schaller.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Did anyone provide you with the materials
that were — excuse me.
Did anyone provide you with materials from the newspaper in Pensacola?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
Q	Who?
A	I got those from Terry Fife, who is a
public historian and not a university historian.
Q	Okay.
Did anyone provide you with the materials, including your reliance list, from the Orlando Sentinel?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Who?
A	That was a previous research assistant
that I had.
Q	Okay. Not a — not another historian who
was or has served as an expert witness for tobacco compani es ?
A	That is correct.
Q	Has Dr. Fife served as an expert witness
for the tobacco companies?
A	Not to my knowledge.
Q	Not that you know of?
A	Right. Not that I know of.
Q	I believe you said he provided you with
materials from the newspaper in Pensacola?
Q	I apologize. I don't remember the name of
it. The name has escaped me off the top of my head. The Pensacola News.
A	Yes.
Q	He provided you with those materials?
A	She did.
Q	I'm sorry. She. I apologize. Terry. I
guess it can go both ways. She provided you with those materials?
A Yes, she did.
Q	Did you request those from her?
A	Yes, I did.
Q	How did you know that she had them?
A	I didn't know that she had them.
Q	Did she also provide you with the
materials from the Pensacola Journal?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. Both of the Pensacola
papers.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Okay.
So how did you go about requesting those materials from Dr. Fife? It is Dr. Fife; right?
Ph.D.
Q	Okay. We'll use Ms. Fife just to be
clear.
A	That would be most accurate.
Q	How did you go about requesting the
Pensacola materials from Ms. Fife?
A	I called her and asked if she had any
newspaper materials from Pensacola.
Q	Why did you think she would have newspaper
materials from Pensacola?
A	Because she has done research on the
questions of smoking and hazards of smoking. So I had — I requested something once before from her, and in this case she said yes, she did.
Q	Why has she done research on the hazards
of smoking?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't know. I think you'd have to ask her.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	What is your understanding of her reasons
for researching the topics of smoking and health?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
she is a public historian and so she has information on a variety of topics, and I thought she would have information on this.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	What's a public historian?
A	In history there are kind of — we're on
three tracks professionally that you could go into. One of them is public history.
Q	What track are you?
A	I'm an academic historian.
Q	What's the third track?
A	High school teaching.
There actually, of course, could be multiple tracks. Somebody might go into law, for example. But typically those are the three primary tracks .
Q	Within the field of history?
A	Correct.
Q	Is an academic historian the one that
requires the most education?
A	No. Not necessarily.
Q	Is it customary in order to teach at the
college level you need to have a Ph.D.?
A	No, not necessarily.
know ?
THE WITNESS: I believe she owns a company, although I'm not certain of that. But she's with a company called History Works.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Do you know what History Works does?
A	Public history.
Q	That's a little broad. Can you be a
little more specific for me?
A	Sure.
Q	If you know. Again, if you don't know,
you can just tell me you don't know. But if you do know what Public (sic) Works does more specifically, can you tell me?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I can tell you what public history is, and public history is the branch of history where someone with a degree, either — it could be at any level — a Bachelor's or a Master's or a Ph.D. — has a kind of consulting business where, for example, say a company — a chemical company or an insurance company, like the Hartford Insurance Company, could ask someone who is a public historian, "Could you research this for me? Could
you write this for me?" That would be one application of public history.
So it's not a teaching track. It's one where a person does professional historical research for various kinds of projects, like even — you know, the — it's not EPA but sort of like the Environmental Protection Agency where you have to sometimes get projects — pardon me — historical research on a site to determine its historical significance before it's either demolished or put on to a historical register.
So that type of historian does that type of research where it's task focused.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	When you requested the materials from
Ms. Fife, did you request smoking and health related materials or did you request all Pensacola News materials she had?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: In this case I asked her about the Pensacola newspapers. I asked her if she had collected the — you know, collected the Pensacola papers.
BY MR. BIGGER:
articles relating to smoking and health?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Okay. I think I'm understanding your question better. They're two together in a way.
Yes, the kind of information I was looking for was information about smoking and health that appeared in the Pensacola newspapers. So I did not ask for, you know, sports scores or other kinds of things.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	I guess what I'm trying to understand —
maybe you could just help me out here.
Did she have a specific collection of smoking and health articles that she had collected from the Pensacola papers?
A Yes, she did.
Q	You don't know why she collected those?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Or do you?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No, I did not ask her. So I don't know.
Q	You don’t know if she is — excuse me.
You don’t know if she has served as an expert witness for tobacco companies?
A	I don’t know.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Who provided you with the newspaper
materials from the Florida Times Union?
A	I got some of those for myself in
Jacksonville, Florida. I also got some from Lacy Ford, I believe. And also a research assistant.
Q	Where did you get the majority of the
documents from the Florida Times Union?
A	I couldn’t give you percentages.
Q	Did Dr. Ford give you a large number of
articles from the Florida Times Union or just a few?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Did Dr. Ford give you a large number of
articles from the Florida Times Union?
A	Yes. He gave me a large number of
personally researching for articles from the Florida Times Union?
A	What do you mean? How much time I spent
reading them? How much time I spent collecting them?
Q	Collecting them.
A	Collecting them? Perhaps a day.
Q	One day?
A Yes. I think that would be a reasonable estimate.
Q	Is that approximately true for the other
newspapers where you were provided the materials from other individuals like Lacy Ford?
MS. LINDSAY: Objection to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Let me ask this another way.
Was there any Florida newspaper where you spent more than one or two days personally researching for the smoking and health articles?
A	Yes .
Q	Which ones ?
A	The Lakeland Ledger.
Q	Okay.
Did anyone else provide you with articles from the Lakeland Ledger?
A	Yes .
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Who?
A	My research assistant.
Q	Anyone else?
A	No .
Q	So Dr. Ford never provided you with
articles from the Lakeland Ledger?
A No, he did not.
Q	No other historian provided you with —
other than your research assistant, who I'm going to presume is a historian — provided you with articles from the Lakeland Ledger?
A	No. No one did.
Q	Any other newspapers in Florida where you
spent more than one or two days collecting the
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I can't think of offhand any other newspaper where I spent more than a day on a Florida newspaper.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Who provided you with the articles
contained in your Evers reliance list for the New
York Times ?
THE WITNESS: I got a number of those
my self.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Who else provided you with the articles?
A	I got some from Michael Schaller.
Q	Anyone else?
A	No .
Q	Did Dr. Schaller provide you with a large
number of articles from the New York Times?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, I'd say so.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Would you say that Dr. Schaller provided
you with the majority of articles from the New York Times that are contained in your reliance list?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think that it would be safe to say the majority in the case of the New York Time s.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	How much time did you spend personally
researching the archives of the New York Times?
A	In just these cases or in all cases?
Q	In any of the Florida cases.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I had most of these -BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	I'm sorry. And by "Florida cases," I mean
the cases that you identified as the cases in which you're serving as an expert witness and which we have marked as Exhibit 8.
A	In this case I had those articles before I
started working on these cases.
Q	You had them from research that you had
done working in the California or the New York cases?
A	That's correct.
Q	Did Dr. Schaller provide you with the
articles from the New York Times when you first began serving as an expert witness in tobacco 1 itigation?
A	He provided some of them.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Like you testified earlier today, did he
provide the majority of them?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
guesstimate, yes, it would be the majority.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Okay.
Who provided you with the articles from the Miami Herald?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I believe you just asked me that question. Didn't we have that conversation?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	I don't think we explored it deeply. I
apologize. I'm just trying to clean up as I go through here.
A	It's hard for me to remember each and
every one because you're doing this over a number of years.
I think that most of them were from my research assistant.
Q	Well, you didn't start researching the
Florida cases at all until 2007. Is that correct?
A	That's correct.
Q	Okay.
And it's your testimony today that the majority of the materials from the Miami Herald were collected by your research assistant?
Q	Did any historian provide you any — any
other historian provide you with materials from the Miami Herald?
A	I believe I got some from Lacy Ford.
Q	Would you say that Dr. Ford provided you
with a large number of articles from the Miami Herald?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I'm sorry, I can't -- can't recall what percentage that would be in this particular case.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Would you say that — well, are the
articles you've included in the Evers case from the Miami Herald different from the articles you included in the Patterson case from the Miami Herald?
A	No .
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: They would be substantially
the same.
BY MR. BIGGER:
A	I think so.
Q	Okay.
Would you say that Dr. Ford provided you with the majority of the articles from the Miami Herald?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, I can't fully answer that. But my sense is that the answer would be no. It's a little bit of a guess. I believe I got most of those from my assistant.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Who employed you with the articles from
the Palm Beach Post?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: My assistant did.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Anyone else?
A	No .
Q	No historian provided you with any
articles from the Palm Beach Post?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Not that I recall.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Dr. Schaller didn't provide you with any
articles from the Palm Beach Post?
THE WITNESS: I don't believe that Dr. Schaller provided anything from Palm Beach.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	And Dr. Ford didn't provide you with any
articles from the Palm Beach Post?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
MR. BIGGER: What's the basis for the
obj ection?
MS. LINDSAY: I think that she told you that no other historian provided those materials to her. So I think it's repetitive.
But go ahead and answer.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Okay. You can answer.
A	Tell me the question again.
Q	Dr. Ford didn't provide you with any
articles from the Palm Beach Post?
MS. LINDSAY: Same objection.
THE WITNESS: No, I don't believe so.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	You don't believe so or he didn't?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
Q	Okay.
A	You know, I just thought of something.
I think — just to correct myself, I think there was one paper where I spent about three days collecting it, because my assistant didn't finish collecting it. That was one of the Miami papers.
But there are two Miami papers, and I'm not remembering the difference in the names. One is the Herald and one is the something else. That's in response to your question was there any paper where I spent more than a day.
Q	Sure.
And you said you spent three days you
believe?
A Yes. That's right.
Q	Okay.
That would be — is it your testimony that it was three eight-hour days, or are you simply saying over the course of three days you researched?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: They would be three days in a row in Miami at the public library there. Approximately eight-hour days. Perhaps longer.
Q	You weren't doing anything else other than
doing research at that time?
A	That's true.
Q	Okay.
Who provided you with the articles from the Tallahassee Democrat?
A	I think the Tallahassee Democrat I believe
was Michael Schaller and supplemented, however, by myself and my research assistant during the time I was in Tallahassee.
Q	Okay.
Who provided you with the articles from the Detroit Free Press?
A	Those I got from Terry Fife.
Q	Again, did you ask her for only the
articles related to smoking and health?
A	Yes .
Q	Who provided you with the articles from
the Toledo Blade?
A	Terry Fife.
Q	Do you know why Ms. Fife had articles
relating to smoking and health from the Toledo Blade?
THE WITNESS: You mean why the Toledo in particular?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Yes.
A Well, she's based in the Midwest. And so, for example, that's one reason why we call her because she is based in the Midwest and has a bit closer access than I do to some archives which are located only there.
Q	Okay.
There's an item on your reliance list called "various North Carolina newspaper articles."
Are you aware if that actually has the articles or if it simply has a slip sheet that references various North Carolina newspaper
A	I believe —
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I believe that's a slip
sheet.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Are you planning to produce the various
North Carolina newspaper articles?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
specific plan to. But I do have some North Carolina newspaper information that I have yet to look at.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Okay.
Is it your testimony that you intend to review those materials in forming the basis of your opinions?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I believe that my opinions stand on the basis of the materials I already have and that they are very fulsome and will give me more than enough to draw responsible historical conclus ions.
However, as I said yesterday, my research is ongoing, and sometimes I'll come across something that I realize would add even more and, you know, continue to round out the picture.
Historians are sort of like that. We tend to keep collecting. I wrote a book on the Peace Corps, and I tell you I still collect Peace Corps stuff in case they ask for a second edition.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	There's always hope.
A	There's always hope. Faint sometimes.
newspaper articles. Is that simply a placeholder that — a white piece of paper that says "various California newspaper articles"?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: At this point it is.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Okay.
Do you have various California newspaper articles in your possession on which you intend to rely in forming your opinions in this case?
A	My answer would be the same, which is that
my opinions are based on what I've given you. And, as I said yesterday, I will be prepared to testify today as to my opinions.
That said, for example, I recently tried to get the Vacaville Reporter, which is a California newspaper in the community that Ms. Evers lived for a couple of years, and I just found out that — it just came into the library two days ago, because I had to get it through an interlibrary loan. So I have not yet looked at it. I don't expect that it will change my opinions, however.
Q	Not the smoking gun?
Q	Pun intended.
Who provided you with the articles from the Sacramento Bee?
A	My assistant.
Q	Anyone else?
A	No .
Q	No other historians provided you with
articles from the Sacramento Bee?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No. No one did.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	You've referred at various times to your
assistant. Do you have one assistant?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I have one assistant.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Are they employed by the San Diego State
Univers ity?
A	No .
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: This particular assistant is
not .
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Who employs this assistant?
A	She —
THE WITNESS: She is retired.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	I'm sorry?
A	She is retired.
Q	Do you not pay her any compensation for
the time she spends working on your research
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I do.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	So you pay her for her time?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't personally pay her for her time. She would bill the same attorney that I am working for, for her time.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	So she bills counsel for R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Company for her time?
A	She bills Jones Day for her time.
Q	Who is counsel for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
C ompany ?
A	(Witness nodded head.)
that those records were not responsive to the request?
Let's go off the record for a second.
(Discussion held off the record.)
MR. BIGGER: Back on.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	What's the name of your assistant?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form. This — the research assistant has not been identified on — well, you know what? To be fair, could you please explain to me why you need the name and how you think it's relevant?
MR. BIGGER: Dr. Hoffman has identified that her research assistant has conducted a significant amount of research in compiling newspaper articles which are contained on Dr. Hoffman's reliance list, and I think we're entitled to know information about her.
And, if we want to, we may be entitled to seek copies of how much time she spent working on these cases. As Dr. Hoffman has indicated, she is being compensated by the Jones Day law firm to assist Dr. Hoffman with her research.
MS. LINDSAY: Here are my concerns with and why I'm objecting so you can understand for the
record.
Dr. Hoffman's research assistant is a private individual. I think we're starting to infringe on some privacy concerns when we start seeking the names and records of that individual.
Your duces tecum No. 10 asks for copies of all time records reflecting the time you,
Dr. Hoffman, have spent on these cases.
I don't believe that any of that is directed to the research assistant, and I think we would have to seek guidance from the court on that issue.
MR. BIGGER: I'm not seeking — I'm not making a claim that she should have brought the records here today.
I'm asking her what the name of her research assistant is, which I'm certainly entitled to get.
MS. LINDSAY: And, again, I would have to object to that and say I'm not so sure that you are and that may be something we need to seek guidance from the court on.
MR. BIGGER: Are you instructing her not
to answer ?
that. I'm saying we need to put a pause in the conversation and this is something that we would need to seek guidance from the court on.
And if the court says yes, name, absolutely.
MR. BIGGER: She's either going to give me the name today or you're going to instruct her not to answer.
MS. LINDSAY: I'm not saying that. I'm saying I think this is where we need to seek guidance from the court.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Dr. Hoffman, what's the name of your
research assistant?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	You can answer.
A	I don't really object to telling you.
Q	I understand.
A	However, I have a sense that there might
be some legal issue — something legal at issue here that I don't understand. So I'd rather not say r ight now.
Q	Dr. Hoffman, you don't have that luxury,
I'm sorry. You're being deposed, you're under oath
and, unless counsel instructs you not to answer, I need an answer to my question.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form. And this is what I have said, and this is where we're going to have to leave this.
We're going to have to put a pause in the conversation, and I recommend that we seek guidance from the court on this issue, because this person is not a witness. We're starting to infringe upon the privacy concerns. It raises issues of why this information is needed.
And I certainly am sure you don't intend this, but it starts going into areas of witness intimidation, harassment. And, again, I know that's not where you're — sure that's not your intent, but it does raise privacy concerns.
And I think to err on the side of caution, we should seek guidance from the court.
MR. BIGGER: Do you want to call the judge right now? Is that what you're saying? I'm happy to do that.
MS. LINDSAY: If you'd like to.
MR. BIGGER: If you want to tell the judge that you're not going to instruct her, you're not going to let her answer a question —
anything.
MR. BIGGER: Hold on. Hold on.
MS. LINDSAY: Let's be very clear on that. I've asked you repeatedly. This is a gray area.
I'm not sure about this. I think it does raise significant privacy concerns.
I would think we both want to err on the side of caution, and I'm just saying let's seek guidance from the court. If you want to seek a motion, I certainly understand. If the court says yes, absolutely, that's fine.
MR. BIGGER: I don't have to seek a motion for her name. If you're instructing her not to answer, you're moving for a protective order, that's fine. You can do so.
MS. LINDSAY: I have told you that I'm not sure. That I think this is an area where we should seek guidance from the court because of the significant privacy issues it raises.
MR. BIGGER: Look, under the rules you need to move for a protective order, instruct her not to answer or I get the answer to the question.
If you want to call the judge right now, that's fine. We can do that. I'm sure Judge Barton
would love to have a call from us right now. Or I gue s s —
MR. McCLURE: That's probably the safest thing to do.
MR. BIGGER: Or I guess Judge Silver.
MR. McCLURE: He's probably not available
but —
MR. BIGGER: Honestly, you don't want to provide the name, just the name.
MS. LINDSAY: Could we go off the record for a momen t ?
MR. BIGGER: Subject to the fact that I'm — I'll reserve my right to put on the record whatever we talk about, yes.
MR. KOETHE: That's fine.
MR. BIGGER: Okay. We'll go off.
(Discussion held off the record.)
MR. BIGGER: We are back on the record. And discussions were had off the record regarding the identification of Dr. Hoffman's research assistant who she has referred to as an individual who has conducted research for a number of the sources contained on her reliance list.
This individual is — has been or is compensated for her time from the Jones Day law
firm, as stated by Dr. Hoffman.
In lieu of placing her name on the record, parties — counsel for the parties have agreed that if and when a subpoena or other discovery request is sent out seeking information regarding Dr. Hoffman's research assistant, the parties and counsel for the parties have agreed that everyone here understands exactly who we're talking about and there won't be any indication or resistance on the basis that the person was not adequately identified so that we can all understand exactly who we're seeking the information about.
No other agreements regarding the validity of the subpoena or any other discovery request or agreement to provide information, anything of that sort has been made.
Simply an understanding that when Dr. Hoffman's research assistant is identified, everyone understands exactly who we're talking about.
MS. LINDSAY: Counsel is correct in his explanation of our agreement. We are not waiving any rights regarding the subpoena or even agreeing to the appropriateness of seeking that information.
That said, we absolutely agree and
understand that if such document is sent to us, we understand who Dr. Hoffman's research assistant is and know exactly to whom he's referring.
MR. BIGGER: Okay. Moving on.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	I believe we were talking about the
Sacramento Bee before a brief break. And I think you said, Doctor, that your research assistant compiled the research from the Sacramento Bee?
A	Yes, I did.
Q	Did any other historians provide you
information from the Sacramento Bee?
A	No, they did not.
Q	There are a number of textbooks that are
identified on this reliance list, and I believe all of them have the prefix ATB under the column titled "image number."
Who provided you with the textbooks identified on this reliance list?
A	Some of them I collected personally
through the library.
Q	What about the others?
A	I got some from my research assistant.
Some of these are ones I've had for many, many years so they well precede the Florida cases. I would
have gotten them from another research assistant I used to have, and I have gotten a few from other historians.
Q	Did the majority of the textbooks come
from other historians or from your or your research assistant's research?
A	That question I can't really answer very
well. It's been such a long time that I've been collecting these. It would be hard for me to know, to guess.
Q	How much time would you estimate that you
spent personally seeking out these textbooks?
A Again, it would be hard to estimate that. Often I go look through — for them on the Internet, and in those cases I don't have to go physically walking around the shelves of the library.
Sometimes I'd have to go to the library.
But it's hard to estimate the time because I've collected them over a number of years. And sometimes it doesn't take very long. It might be a 15-minute search on the library's website or another library's website.
Q	Is it your opinion that each of the
textbooks listed on this reliance list is important in forming the basis of your opinion?
THE WITNESS: They are all relevant to my
opinion.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	In fact, everything identified in this
reliance list is relevant and important in forming the basis of your opinion.
Is that correct?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I have included the things I did on the list because I thought they were all valuable for demonstrating my findings.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	There's nothing in here that you just
threw in that you don't need?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: That's — again, the word "need" is a little bit vague. Could the list have been shorter? Could it have been longer? Both things are probably true.
But I included everything that I thought would be useful to give you as clear an idea and the jury as clear an idea as possible of the great volume of information that's available.
Q	Well, is there any significance to the
number of documents that are on here? In other words, is it possible to demonstrate public knowledge with less than 4300 documents?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think it is possible.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	I don't believe I asked you this already.
If I did, I apologize. I'm not trying to be repetitive .
The Ft. Lauderdale newspapers, there was the Ft. Lauderdale News and the Sun Sentinel. Who provided you with the newspaper materials from the Ft. Lauderdale News and the Sun Sentinel?
A	Some of them I collected myself in
Ft. Lauderdale at the public library. I was there for, I believe, two days.
Q	Who else?
A	I got some from Michael Schaller.
Q	Were the majority of the Ft. Lauderdale
newspaper articles provided by Dr. Schaller?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I would have solicited quite a few from Dr. Schaller, and they could probably —
I think they would likely be the majority.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Did any other historians provide you with
Ft. Lauderdale newspaper articles?
A	No .
Q	There's also, I think, one or two articles
on here from the Ft. Lauderdale Daily News. I'm not familiar with that publication.
But did you — who provided you with the articles from the Ft. Lauderdale Daily News?
A	This is a little difficult to answer
because that particular newspaper changed its name five or six times.
So I honestly have to sit down and go through it every time myself to remember exactly when it was called which, by which name.
Q	What is the Ft. Lauderdale Daily News
called today?
A	I believe it's the Ft. Lauderdale Sun
Sentinel today.
Q	That was an earlier name for the Sun
Sentinel?
A	I believe so.
At this point I'll take your word over
mine because I don't know.
A	Even the librarians have trouble with it.
Q	I think we talked about the Orlando
Sentinel. Were your answers regarding the Orlando Sentinel the same or would they be the same for the Orlando Evening Star?
A	Yes, they would be.
Q	Some articles from the Miami Herald are
listed as image numbers with a different prefix than some other articles from the Miami Herald.
For example, some are from an image number with a prefix AFL and others are from — or excuse me — have a prefix either ALN or ALV. Does the prefix identify whether you collected those mate rials?
In other words, are the ones that — from the Miami Herald that you or your research assistant collected, are they potentially maintained with a different prefix than the ones that Dr. Schaller or someone else provided to you?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of that. I honestly don't understand the significance of the labeling.
Q	You don't understand the image numbers or
how these are stored or produced?
A	No .
Q	Okay. That's something that's done
entirely by the lawyers?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Their office assigns an image number, as I understand it.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Is it your understanding that their office
has essentially a massive database of this information, the same information that you have, so that when you identify, "I want you to include these articles from the Orlando Sentinel," you don't actually send them copies of the articles you want them to produce, do you?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: It would depend on the particular collection. I might have something that they do not have, in which case I would need to send it to them.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	But typically they have what you suggest
that they place on your reliance list?
THE WITNESS: I don't know that they typically do but they often do.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Often do. Okay.
Have you ever seen the — or visited the offices of Jones Day to see their database or view their database where they store that information?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Is that two questions? Is that two questions?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Sure. I guess it could be.
Have you ever visited the offices of Jones
Day ?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I have visited the offices — one of the offices of Jones Day.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Which office?
A	New York.
Q	Okay.
Are you aware if that's the office where these materials are maintained?
THE WITNESS: I don't know.
Q	Have you ever seen the system that Jones
Day uses to maintain these materials?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: If by that you mean filing cabinets or computers, no, I haven't. I wouldn't know where to look.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Have you ever asked them questions about
it?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I didn't think it was necessary because their copies correspond to my copies. You know, they're identical.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	And you doublecheck that to be sure?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I do.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	All of them or a spot check?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Most -- the vast majority I check. Occasionally I can't check something and I just run out of time. But I try to check almost all
of them. It's very time consuming.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Contained within this reliance list is
another, for lack of a better term, placeholder for various Methodist materials.
Do you have various Methodist materials that you still have yet to review?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No, I don't believe so.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Are there various Methodist materials that
you believe are relevant to the basis of your opinions in this case?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: There are various Methodist materials contained in that list and, yes, I do believe they are relevant, especially because the plaintiff was raised as a Methodist and her parents were very religious.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Are you aware that those materials are not
included in here?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I'm aware that some of them are included.
Q	So it's your belief that despite the fact
that there are occasions identified as various Methodist materials similar to the various 4-H materials we've already discussed that only contain a blank page with the title "various Methodist materials" and no additional materials, you believe that elsewhere in this reliance list there are Methodist materials that are included?
A	Yes .
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Can you give me some examples of those?
A	I would have to look at the list to —
Q	Nothing off the top of your head?
A No. I wouldn't — I would want to be more prec i s e.
Q	Okay. That's fine.
Do you know if any of the news clips, the video clips that you included on here, include footage representatives of either The Tobacco Institute, the Center for Tobacco Research or the Tobacco Industry Research Committee?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	You didn't make any effort to specifically
exclude that type of footage, did you?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No. Because they're naturally there in some of the clippings, some of the video clippings, just as in the newspapers there are occasional references and representations.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Did you include the video clipping from
Face The Nation with then CEO Hugh Coleman?
A	I don't recall.
Q	You don't recall if that's on here or not?
A	I don't.
Q	Are you familiar with the video clip that
I'm talking about?
A	I have I believe seen that. I do recall
something to that effect. But it's been a while since I've looked at that.
MR. BIGGER: Why don't we take just a couple minutes here real quick and I'll try and push through the last piece.
(Reces s. )
Q	Dr. Hoffman, I kind of want to circle back
around to the disclosure, those summarizing sentences that we talked about earlier regarding the subject matter of your testimony, and I want to bring it particularly to this case.
The first one, as we talked about before, is that you are expected to testify about the vast amount of information communicated and available to the public through a wide variety of sources concerning the health risks of cigarette smoking.
And I may be paraphrasing it a little bit.
When exactly did you feel or when is it your opinion that Ms. Loyd was aware that cigarettes were a health hazard?
A	I believe she knew that as a child.
That's what all the evidence points to.
Q	Okay.
A	Well before she began smoking.
Q	What is the basis for that opinion?
A	Well, for example, her father was
apparently — suffered from smoke-related — smoking-related health hazard problems. Had an advanced case of emphysema and was forced to retire before the age of 60, which in that generation was
really quite an early retirement. Today that might not seem so unusual. But back then I believe it would have been.
And that's why the family moved to Florida was because of her father's terrible breathing problems which her brother says, you know, they were all very keenly aware of.
Q	Do you know if her father was a smoker?
A	I believe he was.
Q	You do?
A	Yes. Again, I'd have to review the —
but, yes, because the mother, meaning Jacqueline Loyd's mother, blamed her husband's disease upon smoking. On his smoking.
Q	What else?
A	Both the people who knew Jacqueline Loyd
when she was a child, meaning her brother who was deposed, and her nearby neighbor who later married her brother, both said that they were warned and that Jacqueline was also warned by the parents not to start smoking. That would be one other reason.
Q	Anything else?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: The other reasons why I think that she knew this as a child is because she
grew up in a state where there was a very strong public commitment to preventing children from smok ing.
So that, for example, there was an actual law where it was a crime for a child to smoke cigarettes, and that was in advance of a stronger law that pertained in many other states.
Q	What state was that?
A	Michigan.
Q	Do you know how old Ms. Loyd was when she
left Michigan?
A	I believe she was about 24, 25. She left
in 1959. She was born in 1935.
Q	Is it your belief that the tobacco
companies want children to not smoke?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I can't comment really on their internal thinking or policy.
I could point you to websites and programs like the 4-H has, for example, which are sponsored by in this particular case Phillip Morris that urge children not to smoke.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	When was that?
A	That particular 4-H program began in the
year 2000.
Q	Anything before then?
A Well, there were warnings on the packages, of course, since 1966. But I don't know what else you mean.
Q	That wasn't voluntary, though, from the
cigarette companies, though, was it?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	In other words, they didn't voluntarily
agree to put warning labels on their cigarette packages ?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: As I understand it, it was a law, but it's also true that they volunteered for other things that were of a — to inform people.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Such as ?
A Well, for example, they agreed without being coerced to do so to list the tar and nicotine contents. That was something that was a request.
And I believe that they also brought up the idea of not doing any broadcast advertising any longer and the — this was towards the end of the 1 9 6 0 ' s .
So those things go together to make me think that there was some attempt to, you know, warn people.
Q	You've never seen any internal company
documents I'm sure — have you ever requested any internal company documents from the tobacco compani es ?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No, I've never requested any materials at all from the companies.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	You're aware that for several years now —
I don't know exactly how many years. I don't want to say a decade if that's too long.
But you're aware that as a result of the master settlement agreement and other litigation there are now publicly available databases of information that contain the tobacco companies' documents? Are you aware of that fact?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I'm not aware if that -- it was related to the master settlement or not.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Are you aware that these databases of
information are out there?
A Yes. I'm aware that you could find some documents on the Internet, for example.
Q	Are you aware that they're publicly
available?
A Well, the Internet is a publicly accessible medium. So, yes, I would consider that an example of being publicly available.
Q	Some sites are. Some sites are still not
publicly available, are they?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't know.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	You have to have a password and a log-in
to get in?
A	Well, like my own e-mail, you have to have
a password and log-in. It's probably true across the board in companies and private individuals.
Q	But these documents you're heard or are
aware are publicly available. Anybody can see them?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: The ones I've heard of, yes. BY MR. BIGGER:
them?
Q	So you're not aware that there are
internal company documents that refer to the youth as replacement smokers?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of those
document s.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Have you ever heard of the Archetype
Pro j ect ?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No I'm not.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	It was a Phillip Morris project. You've
never heard of that?
A	No, I have not.
Q	Took place in the 1990’s.
A	Sorry. I'm just unaware of that project.
Q	Okay.
Do you have an opinion about the tobacco companies' efforts to prevent youth from smoking?
A	That really would be outside the scope of
my research, for the most part.
It would pertain to my research if — for example, I mentioned 4-H. I know that they participated in a 4-H project.
But my emphasis is really on not what the companies were attempting. My emphasis was really on the material that's available. In this case, by looking at the 4-H material, I became aware that it was funded to some extent by Phillip Morris.
Q	As a historian what is your understanding
historically of the tobacco companies' efforts to prevent youth from smoking?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I have not as a historian specifically researched that angle on this problem. So I'm not looking to those records.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	So you haven't come across anything at all
in your historical research about the tobacco companies' efforts to prevent youth from smoking?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, I have. I just gave you an example of that in the case of — Health Rocks it's called. It was a 4-H program.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Aside from that one isolated 4-H program,
is there anything else that you've encountered in the course of your historical research regarding tobacco companies' efforts to prevent youth from
smok ing ?
THE WITNESS: Yes, I have.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	What else?
A Another example that comes readily to mind was from San Diego where we're meeting today where they were — and I don't remember — recall the story terribly well, but I do remember that they were offering — meaning Phillip Morris I believe it was — to pay for some smoking — anti-smoking materials for local city schools, and the local city schools said, "No, we don't want that money because it's from the tobacco industry," although in this case — I'm not even sure if they're support of the project was to be identified on the folders. But it created a little stir here in San Diego.
That's —
Q	When was that?
A	It was within the last five years I would
guess. Close to that.
Q	Anything else that you have come across
during the course of your historical research?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
I think that there probably would be a couple of other examples I could come up with, but I'd have to go back to my research to be sure.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	I asked you some questions in a previous
deposition about a March 1964 Gallup poll that was done by one of the tobacco companies. It was a national poll of adults ages 21 years and older.
Do you recall me asking questions about
that po11?
A	Yes. Although it was also helpful to me
that you showed me the poll. So, if you want to ask me more questions about it, maybe I should see it again.
Q	What I was going to say is if I asked you
the same questions in this deposition, would your answers be substantially the same?
MS. LINDSAY: I'm going to renew my objection that you asked her about a document she had never seen before until this deposition when you presented it to her. So I object on that basis.
MR. BIGGER: Yes.
THE WITNESS: I would say that I think they would, but I'm not sure. Because I believe you asked me several questions about it, and it's — you
know, if you wouldn't mind reiterating the questions, I think it's likely I would have the same answers but —
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Okay.
If I asked you the same questions, you would have no reason to believe your answers wouldn't be the same?
A	No. Although as I — as was just noted by
someone else, I was seeing that document for the first time so —
Q	I understand.
A	— it's possible if I had a chance to look
at it again in a more reflective environment I could come up with better or slightly different answers. But I have no reason to think I would, partly because I don't remember what I said yesterday about i t .
Q	As with anything, the more you see
something, the more familiar you get with it; right?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: The more you see something the more — I'm not sure if that's outside my expertise. It may be that you're asking me to talk about how people remember things. I don't know.
That's kind of a philosophical question.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	I'm just asking you the more opportunity
you have to work with something, the better understanding of it you have. Fair enough?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	It's not a trick question.
A	I think it would depend on what it is,
honestly.
I imagine there are some people, for example, who are medical technicians who handle the same lab tests every time for thousands and thousands of times.
But do they understand any better what the doctor or the pathologist is looking for and how the pathologist finds that? Maybe not. So just speaking in a philosophical way. It could go either way, I gue s s.
Q	Okay.
I asked you some questions in a previous deposition or you testified in your previous deposition regarding the definition of common knowledge and what common knowledge is and how it relates to common awareness.
A	Mm-hmm.
Q	If I asked you those same questions today,
would your answers be substantially the same?
A	I think they would be.
Q	Okay.
Do you think that there could be a difference in the common knowledge of a community in one part of the country versus the common knowledge of a community in another part of the country?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
For example, some things are very regional, like how to cook something. Southerners know how to bake biscuits. We hope that's still true. That wouldn't be common knowledge in the northeast.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Maybe shrimp and grits?
A	Shrimp and grits even more esoteric, yes,
from the northeast point of view.
Q	Not as well known in other parts of the
country?
A	Correct.
Q	Regardless, in order to have common
knowledge, the majority of the members of the
community have to have that understanding?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Would you agree with that?
MS. LINDSAY: Same objection.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Whatever community you're talking about.
A	And whatever subject we're talking about?
Q	Right.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: To define something as common is to say that it prevails, it's very prevalent information.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Right.
I asked you some questions yesterday regarding television, and I showed you a document from the Lorillard Company about television advertising and sponsorship of television programs by tobacco companies.
Do you recall that testimony?
A	I'm not recalling whether it was a
Nielsen — is this the same document that was — I'm not sure if it was a Nielsen document or a Roper document or a company document. But I do remember
Q	Okay. I'll get there.
MS. LINDSAY: Before we get into more substance, I'm going to object, as I did yesterday. Object to form and you're asking her questions about a document that she has never seen before the deposition in the Patterson case.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	It was an internal company document. But
the source of the information in the document on one of the pages was from the A.C. Nielsen Company. On the other page it was from what was identified as — I think it's LNA-BAR, which I actually went and looked up and it was a media measuring company similar to A.C. Nielsen. I don't know if they exist any longer. I couldn't find their website, but that i s anecdotal.
You do recall that testimony that you gave in your prior deposition regarding that document?
A	I recall some of it.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	If I ask you those same questions in this
deposition, would you believe your answers would be substantially the same?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form and same objection. Do I have a continuing objection?
MR. BIGGER: Yes. Anything about this document you're saying.
MS. LINDSAY: Thank you.
THE WITNESS: I think it would be substantially the same. But there is the problem that I did just get to look at it on the fly, and I could only look at a couple pages.
So, obviously, if I read the whole document, I'd have a better sense about it. Just looking at what I saw, I think probably my impulse would be the same.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Okay.
You'd still agree that many television programs, evening television programs, were sponsored by tobacco companies during the 50's and into the early 60's?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I would agree that that's what the document suggested.
Whether or not that document is accurate, how it would stack up against other documents if I were to do more research, you know, those are the
kind of questions I can't answer, not having — not having sat down with that document and to try to corroborate it because, when you do historical research any document — almost any document that you find, you stack it up against other documents to try to corroborate it.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Have you — you didn't do any research
into tobacco advertising for your opinions in this case, though, did you?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: What do you mean by that?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	You didn't include any tobacco
advertisements in your reliance materials, did you?
A	I have no materials — tobacco ads that
are on that list. But I do have tobacco advertising. I have a fair amount of it in various newspapers .
Q	That you feel is included on this — in
your reliance materials?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I did not include them in this because I did not think they were relevant to the question of public knowledge of the hazards of
smok ing.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	You've previously testified that
advertising is important to inform the public awareness, haven't you?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No, I don't believe I said that in that way.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Not just in your prior deposition in the
Patterson case but in any depositions or trial testimony that you've given, you don't believe you've ever said that advertising was important to consider when looking at the public awareness?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think that the second time you're saying it a little differently.
I think it's important to be aware of advertising and to look at it as one would look at a variety — the variety of things that the public sees, and then you have to stack it up against the other evidence and decide is this very important for understanding exactly what people knew about hazards. And knowing about hazards, I don't think it's nearly as important as all these other things.
I could have included ads. For example, the ads themselves have warnings on them. There was a certain period of time where ads, as you know, were required to also carry the Surgeon General's warning. I could have produced those, but I didn't think that they were as important as the things that are one the list.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	So you excluded them? You made the
decision to exclude them from the list?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I wouldn't say decision to exclude. That sounds harsher than I mean it. I would say I decided not to include them. They were not — nothing I felt I would have trouble with them being on there.
But, you know, I think you're already a little, you know, concerned that the list is so long, and it is a very long list. So I'd be happy to look at ads, however, if you wanted to show me s ome .
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Okay. When were you born?
A	1956. And that's on the CV.
(Discussion held off the record.)
MR. BIGGER: Back on the record.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Before you were ten years old, 1966 and
before, do you personally ever remember seeing television programs that were sponsored by tobacco compani es ?
A No. I wasn't aware of them at the time as being sponsored by tobacco companies.
Q	You don't ever remember having watched an
evening television program that was sponsored by a tobacco company?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I may have watched a program, but I don't remember it as having been sponsored by a tobacco company. I don't know if it was or was not.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Okay.
In your previous deposition you were asked questions about public awareness of addiction, and you were also asked questions about the distinction between addiction, habit forming, difficult to quit.
If I asked you those same questions again today, would your answers be substantially the same
to the extent that they were not specific to that previous case?
A	I believe they would be substantially the
same. I think that I might add one thing. We were talking about the debate in the terms, and I'm just aware that the extent to which — to give you an example of this, I was looking at some Methodist materials again last night because we were talking about this Evers case, and Mrs. Loyd was a Methodi st.
And I took note that in 1963, I believe — '62 or '63 — the Methodist church warned its members that tobacco was as habit forming as opium is the way they put it.
And I remarked on it because we were talking about that people can say a phrase and mean several things by it.
And in this case I thought that was a pretty good example that I probably would have brought to your attention the other day if I had been remembering it at the time.
Q	Do you also recall your previous testimony
that you did not believe there was a controversy regarding the — regarding whether smoking was a health hazard?
THE WITNESS: I don't -- I think that you might be mischaracterizing my testimony.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Please explain.
A	Could you ask me the question one more
time, please?
Q	In your previous deposition you were asked
whether you believe there was ever a controversy regarding whether smoking was a health hazard.
And maybe I'm incorrect, but I believe you said you did not believe there was ever a controversy.
Do you believe there was ever a controversy regarding whether smoking was a health hazard?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No, I don't believe there was ever a controversy whether it was a health hazard in the sense that health can include many dimensions. That there are lots of ways in which something can be unhealthy for you.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Do you believe there was ever a
controversy regarding whether smoking caused lung
cancer?
A Yes, there was a controversy that I saw in newspapers — commented upon in newspapers from time to time.
Q	Do you have an opinion on when that
controversy began?
A	I think the controversy began in the 30's,
the 1930's. And that's probably when it began.
Q	Do you have an opinion on when that
controversy ended?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: By "controversy," that's a very broad term.
So, for example, I would say that parts of it remained controversial for a very long time and may even still be controversial in the sense of — I'm not aware, for example, that medical researchers have still ever yet pinned down exactly what is the component in smoking or in the tar residue that's left over that actually triggers a cancer. So to me it seems that one could use the word controversy perhaps even to the present.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	I want to use the word however you
there was a controversy. And then you said you did believe there was a controversy regarding lung cancer.
Using the word as you had understood it to mean during your previous answers, when do you believe the controversy regarding whether smoking cigarettes caused lung cancer ended?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I believe I mostly answered
that .
But I can tell you that if you look at one segment of the public health community, which is a very, very important segment for this topic, and in general, that for the public health community that question was probably answered definitively for them by 1954 when the ACS said, "This is the way it is."
Certainly by 1957 when the Surgeon General began — you know, made the first warnings.
And then, of course, 1964 further nail in the coffin, to use a pun intentionally.
However, keep in mind I'm citing those particular Surgeon Generals because I think really important to resolving the question, you know, generally will it — will it make you susceptible to lung cancer. That's answered.
Why it does, how it does, why it does for some people and not for some other people, those things remain at issue.
It's also the case, however, that the very first such Surgeon General of the United States, Benjamin Rush, in 1798 also said that smoking is carcinogenic and that tobacco will cause cancer.
Not lung cancer, by the way, because at that time that was almost unknown.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Did he say that about cigarettes?
A	He used tobacco in a generic sense. But
in the Continental Army I think people would have been using tobacco in a number of forms, whether as snuff or as pipes or rolling them up.
I think — I think cigarettes are — they have existed always. In fact, you can go back to Columbus and there will be descriptions that sound like a cigarette. You can actually go to Mayan hieroglyphs and find cigarettes literally rolled up and smoked just like we think of it today.
Q	When did the tobacco companies believe the
controversy regarding smoking cigarettes causing lung cancer ended?
THE WITNESS: You know, I really can't tell you that. It's a big industry, and I have not researched their — again, their internal documents. There are statements about it.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Have you researched their public
statements ?
A	I have seen their public statements, yes,
definitely in the context of reading newspaper articles or watching video clips and that kind of thing.
Q	When was the first time that a tobacco
company publicly admitted that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I honestly am not sure at what point they used that particular phraseology.
As we mentioned yesterday, we were talking about they publicized — actually, paid to publicize quite extensively that scientists had linked to lung cancer as early as 1954.
But when they said, "Yes, we're certain," I'm just really not sure about that. I don't even really think it's extremely relevant, not to the question of what public awareness there was of the
hazards, because people were hearing constantly from very reputable, uninterested, disinterested sources. So I don't think it made a difference.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Well, did they — did the companies admit
in 1994 in their testimony before Congress that cigarettes were a health hazard?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't recall that element of the 1994 hearings. I assume you mean the Waxman hearings. And I just — I don't remember that part of a very long transcript. I'm not even sure, honestly, if it came up in that hearing. They were talking a lot about addiction.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	You've read the transcript?
A Yes. Parts of it.
Q	But you don't recall reading the part
where each of the executives were asked whether they believed their product caused cancer?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I just don't recall that. I recall the part about addiction. I just don't remember if I read it or not.
Q	You do recall the part where they were
each asked if their product was addictive?
A	I do .
Q	And you recall or do you recall each
executive indicated they did not believe their product was addictive?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: As I mentioned yesterday because I — at a prior deposition I think we discussed this.
I remember that they were told they could answer only yes or no, and that some of them tried very much to say that they were adhering to the previous Surgeon General's definition, not the current Surgeon General's definition.
By the current definition they did not — they said — by the old definition it wasn't addictive, and they never got a chance to really say the rest. But I definitely remember that because it was also on television too.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	So the answer was, yes, do you recall
A	I do recall their discussion of addiction,
yes .
Q	And you recall that each of them said
that they did not believe their product was addi c t i ve ?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form. She's answered this question.
MR. BIGGER: She didn't, in fact.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Do you recall that each of them answered
that their product was not addictive?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	It's just a yes or no question.
A	I recall that they commented upon the
addictive quality and said that they thought it was not addictive. The answer is no, according to the definition they were — they wanted to use.
Q	Okay. Thank you.
Do you recall in your prior deposition you were asked about whether any relatives worked for the tobacco companies or were lawyers who represented tobacco companies?
A	Yes, I recall that question.
Q	If I asked you those same questions, would
A	They would be.
Q	Do you recall the questions regarding
whether you or any members of your family were smoker s ?
A Yes, I recall those questions.
Q	If I asked you those same questions, would
your answers be substantially the same?
A	Yes, they would be.
Q	Do you recall whether or recall your
previous testimony regarding whether anyone in your family has died of a smoking-related disease? If I asked you those same questions, would your answers be substantially the same?
A	Yes. Except I think I would add an uncle.
I think I mentioned my grandfather. But maybe it was because you were saying immediate family. But I was close to my uncle so I would include him perhaps if you asked again.
Q	What do you believe was the
smoking-related disease that your uncle died from?
A	He died of lung cancer.
Q	And he was a smoker?
A Yes, he was.
Q	Did someone tell you that smoking caused
his lung cancer, or is that something you've come to
believe?
THE WITNESS: I believe we all assumed that. I don't remember anyone saying it per se.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	You don't remember a doctor saying that?
A	No .
Q	Okay.
Do you recall in your prior deposition me asking you some questions regarding your expertise in polling, statistics and epidemiology?
A	Yes, I do remember your asking those
questions.
Q	If I asked you those same questions, would
your answers be substantially the same?
A Yes, I believe so.
Q	Do you recall also that I asked you
questions regarding the Gallup poll and the Roper poll? Well, The Gallup Organization and The Roper Organization?
A	Yes, I remember your asking about that.
Q	If I asked you those same questions, would
your answers be substantially the same?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
Q	You're aware of both organizations?
A	Oh, yes.
Q	And you're aware both organizations are —
well, is it your opinion that both organizations are polling organizations?
A Yes, they are.
Q	Is it your opinion that both organizations
are a reliable source of information regarding public opinion?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I believe that they're one source of reliable information.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Regarding public opinion?
A	Regarding public opinion.
Q	As you sit here today, do you have any
other opinions that you intend to offer about which
I	haven't asked you?
A	Not that I can think of.
Q	Okay.
As you sit here today do you plan to conduct any further research or — as you sit here today, do you plan to conduct any further research regarding the issues about which we've discussed
today?
THE WITNESS: Well, as I mentioned earlier this morning, I was informed by the library that they got the copies of the Vacaville Reporter. So I may go back to those.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q	Other than the Vacaville Reporter, as you
sit here today do you have any specific plan to review any further materials?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No, I don't have any specific plan.
MR. BIGGER: I have nothing further.
MS. LINDSAY: Okay.
Let's take a couple minutes, and I'll look at my notes and see if I have any other questions.
MR. BIGGER: Sure.
MS. LINDSAY: Thank you.
(Reces s. )
MS. LINDSAY: We have no further questions unless Mr. Bigger has further questions for the witnes s.
MS. LINDSAY: We will read and sign. You can send the transcript to me, and I will give it to the witness.
