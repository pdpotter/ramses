knowledge she gave me a call.
13
17
Did she send you a letter?
I'm trying to remember.
12
16
Did she knock on
Object to the form.
Not necessarily.
And why not?
People, you know, call me about all
different kinds of things as a historian.
Q.
Okay.
Have you ever gotten a call from
any other attorney in your capacity as a historian?
19 A.
20 Q.
I don't believe so.
Okay.
So the first time you ever received
21 a call from any attorney involved in litigation was
22 in March 2005 when Julia Tyler called you?
23 A.
24 Q.
25
Yes.
When did you -- when did you give your
deposition in the Craft case?
When was that?

I believe it was -- I believe it was
2 May 2010.
3 sure.
4
Q.
It may have been 2009.
Okay.
I'm just not
So between the time you were first
5 contacted by attorneys for the tobacco companies and
6 the point when you gave your first deposition was a
7 period of about five years?
8 A. I would say four or five years, yes.
9 Q. Okay.
Did you do any research or any --
10 any research into the history of tobacco or anything
11 of that nature between 2005 and 2010?
12
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. When Julia Tyler called you in March of
15
16
2005, what did she tell you?
A.
As best I can recollect, she basically
17 said that they were looking for someone who, you
18 know, was a social historian, who had social
19 historians research skills particularly in things
20 like newspapers and other kinds of public documents
21 and that they were particularly interested in a
22 historian who could do some research and draw
23 conclusions regarding public awareness on smoking
24 and health issues.
25
Q.
Okay.
Did they tell you what conclusions
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221

8
9
10
11
Object to the form.
No.
When was the next contact you had with an
attorney with the tobacco company?
A.
I honestly don't know.
I -- I don't want
to speculate.
Q.
So after that first telephone call with
12 Julia Tyler in March of 2005, did you just talk with
13 attorneys on the phone or did you meet with them
14 face-to-face?

number of weeks.
Q.
It was probably a
I just don't recall.
Have you done any work for the tobacco
24 company attorneys in between that initial phone call

fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 17
1 A. I'm sorry.
2 Q. Sure.
Could you repeat the question?
Did you do any work for the tobacco
3 company attorneys in between that initial phone call
4 in March of 2005 and that first face-to-face meeting
5 a few weeks later?
6 A. No, I did not.
7 Q. How far away was Worcester from your home

20
21
22
23
24
25
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
It was a very modest restaurant, as I
recall.
Q.
Okay.
And what was the purpose of that
meeting?
A.
I had questions for them, and I think that
was the main point of the meeting.
Q.
Okay.
What questions did you need to ask

fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 18

them?
A.
I asked them a bit about, you know, the
3 kinds of research questions that historians
4 generally pursued.
5
I, you know, remember making it clear at
6 that time that I would approach, you know, research
7 questions with, you know, this sort of -- this kind
8 of research any way -- the way that I approach any
9 other research question as a historian; that I would
10 follow the, you know, historical method and, you
11 know, be independent in terms of the kinds of
12 conclusions that I drew.
13
Q.
Now, you said you had some kind of -- you
14 had a question of, you wanted to know what kinds of
15 questions historians pursue?
16
17
MR. KEEHFUS:
Q.
Object to the form.
I think that's what you said.
What sort
18 of questions did they tell you that historians
19 pursue?

21
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
No.
I'm sorry.
Object to the form.
Maybe I wasn't clear on
22 what I said.
23 know, the kinds of questions that -- you know, that
24 expert witnesses pursued with this kind of research.
25 Again, I wanted to know the nature of the research.
I generally ask the question of, you

3 details of the meeting.
4 satisfied that I would be an independent researcher;
5 that I would go about, you know, framing questions,
6 answering them, drawing conclusions based on the
7 historical method as I would any other research
8 project.
9
10
Q.
Okay.
I remember leaving
Do you agree as an expert witness

But do you have a preference one way or
No, I don't.

15
A.
Object to the form.
Not necessary -- I mean, I don't have any

You would just as well be fine not having

It honestly really doesn't matter to me.
Okay.
Now, after that face-to-face

And after meeting, did you begin
I did.
I don't remember exactly when.
5 I mean, it was the middle of the semester, so I'm
6 not exactly -- I don't really recall exactly when I
7 started.
8
9
Q.
Was it within -- did you start within a
few months of that meeting?
10 A. Yes, probably.
11 Q. Did you continue to have contact and
12
13
Yes.
conversations with the tobacco company attorneys?
A.
Occasional contact with Ms. Tyler, I
14 suppose, but, again, my recollections are pretty
15 hazy on that.
16 Q.
17 phone?
18 A.
19
20
21
Okay.
Ms. Tyler would call you on the
I -- she probably checked in from time to
time.

When you say check in, what did she want
to know?
22
MR. KEEHFUS:

24 while ago.
25 Q.
Object to the form.

2
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
3 A. I don't -- I don't think so.
4 Q. Did she ever ask you if you were having
5
trouble finding anything?
6 A. No.
7 Q. Did she call to offer -- to provide you
8
with materials?
9 A. No, I don't believe so.
10 Q. At that initial face-to-face meeting with
11 Julia Tyler and Dan Ball, did the subject of your
12 compensation come up?
13
14
15
16
17
A.
I honestly don't remember if we talked
about it then.
Q.
Would you have begun working without
knowing how much you were going to be paid?
A.
Well, as I said, I'm not exactly sure when
18 I started working, so, again, I don't remember
19 exactly the chronology of that particular
20 conversation.
21
Q.
But would you have started work without
22 knowing how much you were going to be paid?
23 MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
24 A. You know, I don't know.
25 Q. When you first started doing research, you

said your rate was $150 per hour, is that right?
2 A. As best I can recall, yes.
3 Q. Who determined that number?
4
5
6
Did you
determine that or was that suggested to you?
A.
I honestly don't remember.
I -- I think
that was probably suggested to me.
7 Q. By who?
8 A. I don't remember.
9 Q. Was it suggested to you by, you know,
10 friends, coworkers, professional associates or was
11 it suggested to you by an attorney for the tobacco
12 firms?

14

16
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Again, I don't recall.
just don't know.
Q.
Object to the form.
I may have -- I
I'm not going to speculate.
When did your rate change from a
17 hundred -- let me ask you this:
18 change directly from $150 per hour to $200 per hour
19 or was there an intermediate number in there?
Did your rate
20 A. There was not an intermediate number.
21 Q. Okay.
22
23
24
25
When did your rate change from 150
per hour to 200 per hour?
A.
I believe it was after -- after I finished
my Craft -- my work on the Craft case.
Q.
After you gave a deposition in that case?
United Reporting, Inc

fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 25
1 A.
2 Q.
Yes.
Was it your understanding after your
3 deposition that your work was complete in the Craft
4 case?
5 A.
6 point.
7 Q.
I don't think that was clear at that
Okay.
But it was clear to you that the
8 Craft case was over, right, when you decided to
9 change your rate, is that right?
10
11
12
A.
No.
I think there was still a chance I
was -- I could possibly be called to testify.
Q.
Okay.
Did you change your rate from 150
13 to $200 per hour in anticipation that you may be
14 called to testify?
15 A.
16 Q.
17
18
No.
Why did you change your rate from 150 per
hour to 200 per hour?
A.
I felt I was more experienced at that
19 point; that was four or five years into doing this
20 kind of research.
21 Q.
22 A.
23 Q.
24
25
Did anybody question your rate?
Not that I recall.
Did anybody ask you why you were
increasing it?
A.
I really don't remember.

7
I just remember
I don't remember the
Johnson, Tyler & Purvis.
Okay.
And what law firm was Dan Ball
with?
8 A.
9 Q.
He was with the same firm.
Okay.
And is that the firm that -- did
10 you deal with any other law firm or any lawyers from
11 any other law firm in between March 2005 and when
12 you first gave your deposition in the Craft case?
13 A.
Yes.
14 Q.
15 deal with?
16 A.
What other law firms or lawyers did you
I dealt with Ms. Segel at Goodwin Procter
17 and on the Craft case, Judy Bernstein-Gaeta at
18 Arnold & Porter.
19
20
Q.
When did you first come in contact with
Ms. Segel at Goodwin Procter?
21 A.
22 Q.
I would guess around 2006.
Okay.
So about a year after you were
23 first approached by Julia Tyler, you were put in
24 contact with Ms. Segel at Goodwin Procter?
25 MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 27
1 A. Yes, roughly around that time.
2 Q. Did you call her or did she get your
3
4
5
6
7
number from somebody and call you?
A.
Which is the "her"?
I'm sorry.
Could you
repeat the question?
Q.
Absolutely.
How did Ms. Segel get in
contact with you?
8 A. Again, I -- I don't recall the details.
9 Q. Did you receive a phone call or did she
10 come and knock on your door or did she send you a
11 letter?
12
A.
I'm -- I'm just not sure.
I know I met
13 with her here at Goodwin, but I'm not sure exactly
14 how -- how she made contact.
15
Q.
So you met with her face-to-face at
16 Goodwin Procter, is that right?
17 Segel?
18 A.
Yes.
19 Q.
Okay.
20
You met with Ms.
Where that was firm located?
Which
office?
21 A. Here in Boston.
22 Q. And that was in 2006, right?
23 A. I would -- around that time, yes.
24 Q. And what was the purpose of that meeting?
25 A. The purpose of that meeting was to ask me
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 28
1 if I would be interested in doing research on public
2 awareness regarding a Massachusetts case.
3 Q. And what was the name of that case?
4 A. That case was Aspinall.
5 Q. Did you say Astinall?
6 A. Aspinall, A-S-P-I-N-A-L-L.
7 Q. Okay, thank you.
8
Did you agree to do the
research in Massachusetts on that subject?
9 A. Yes, I did.
10 Q. But you never gave a deposition in the
11
Aspinall case, is that right?
12 A. That's correct.
13 Q. And then you said that you met with a
14 Bernstein at Arnold & Porter for the Craft case, is
15 that right?
16 A.
That's right.
17 Q.
Okay.
18
How did -- how did they get in
contact with you?
19 A. Again, I -- I don't recall exactly.
20 Q. Did they come and knock on your door?
21 A. I don't think so.
22 Q. Okay.
23
Did they send you a letter in the
mail?
24 A. It was most likely a phone call.
25 Q. Okay.
And who was it that called you?
United Reporting, Inc

A.
Again, I'm just not sure.
2 remember. 3 Q. Okay.
4 A. Again, I -- I don't know.
5
6
I don't
Was it this Bernstein person?
I don't
remember the details.
Q.
Okay.
I'm just trying to understand.
You
7 gave me the last name Bernstein, and I'm assuming
8 that you either talked to that person on the phone
9 or met them in person, is that right?
10
11
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
I probably talked with her on the phone
12 and then met her in person later.
13 Bernstein-Gaeta.
14
15
16
Q.
Her name is
It's a hyphenated name.
Okay, thank you.
And when she called you
on the phone, what was she calling you about?
A.
She was asking me if I would be interested
17 in researching a question of public awareness for
18 this Missouri case on light cigarettes.
19
Q.
Okay.
So it's my understanding that, one,
20 you got a call from Ms. Segel from Goodwin Procter
21 to do research on public awareness in Massachusetts
22 and then subsequent to that you got a call from Ms.
23 Bernstein to research public awareness in Missouri,
24 is that right?
25
A.
Yes.

And what, specifically, were you asked to
research by Julia Tyler and Dan Ball?
3
4
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
I don't think I was asked to research
5 anything specific at that point.
6 mainly doing was just beginning to do some initial
7 research into the history of tobacco, for example.
8 Tobacco use.
9
Q.
Okay.
I think what I was
That was your understanding of your
10 assignment or your -- what they asked you to do was
11 to just research general tobacco use?
12
13
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
Again, that's where -- that's where I
14 started, and I don't remember -- I was not given a
15 specific question at that point.
16
17
Q.
What was included within tobacco use?
What subjects?
18
MR. KEEHFUS:
19 ahead.
20 A.
Object to the form.
Again, I was researching just sort of
21 general history of tobacco, I guess would be the
22 better way to say it.
23
Q.
Go
Okay.
Tobacco use.
Prior to 2005, you hadn't performed
24 any original research solely on the history of
25 tobacco, had you?
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 31
1 A. Not solely on the history of tobacco, no.
2 Q. Prior to 2005, you hadn't done any
3 original research into what smokers knew about the
4 health risks of smoking in this country, had you?
5 A. No.
6 Q. Between 2005 and your first deposition in
7 the Craft case, were you involved with any other
8 attorneys or law firms besides Julia Tyler and Dan
9 Ball at Johnson, Tyler & Purvis, Ms. Segel at
10 Goodwin Procter and Ms. Bernstein at Arnold &
11 Porter?
12
MR. KEEHFUS:
13
A.
Object to the form.
I worked -- I did research for another
14 case called -- yeah, I did have contact with another
15 firm and that would have been Shook, Hardy & Bacon.
16
17
Q.
Okay.
Who from Shook, Hardy & Bacon got
in contact with you?
18 A. Honestly, I don't -- I don't remember.
19 Q. Okay.
What did -- what did the attorney
20 at Shook, Hardy & Bacon, what did they ask you to
21 do?
22
A.
They asked me to research public awareness
23 on smoking and health issues for a case that was the
24 Donovan case.
25
Q.
Okay.
Where was the Donovan case pending?
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 32
1 A. In Massachusetts.
2 Q. Were you approached by Shook, Hardy &
3
Bacon before or after Ms. Segel at Goodwin Procter?
4 A. That would have been after.
5 Q. But before you gave your deposition in
6
Craft, is that right?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. Since -- since your deposition in the
9
Craft case -- well, let me back up for a second.
10 Did you ever visit the Shook, Hardy & Bacon law
11 offices prior to your deposition in Craft?
12 A. No.
13 Q. Okay.
Did you ever have any face-to-face
14 meetings with any Shook, Hardy & Bacon lawyers prior
15 to your deposition in Craft?
16 A. No, I don't believe so.
17 Q. So prior to giving your deposition in the
18 Craft case, you had only spoken on the phone with
19 attorneys for Shook, Hardy & Bacon?
20
21
22
A.
Again, I -- I believe that's -- that's
true, to the best of my recollection, yeah.
Q.
Okay.
Now, I know that you went to the
23 Goodwin Procter office in Boston.
24 you ever go to any -- did you ever go to the offices
25 of Arnold & Porter?
Did you -- did
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221

1 A. Yes, I believe so.
2 Q. Which office did you visit?
3 A. Washington office.
4 Q. Any others?
5 A. No.
6 Q. When you were first approached by tobacco
7 companies to do this research, did you ever ask them
8 how they found you?
9
A.
Were you ever curious?
Yes.
10
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
11 ahead. 12 Q. Okay.
13 A. As I recall, one of the historians that
Go
What did they tell you?
14 had done some research for them contacted a
15 colleague of mine at Clark University because they
16 were interested in -- in finding or looking for a
17 social historian, basically.
18
Again, someone who was -- you know,
19 experienced in working in, you know, newspapers and
20 other kinds of public documents to, you know, do
21 research and provide expert testimony in a case.
22
Q.
So a historian who was already working for
23 the tobacco companies knew an associate of yours at
24 Clark University, is that right?
25
A.
That's correct.

for the tobacco companies?
3
MR. KEEHFUS:

4 A. The historian was Michael Schaller.
5 Q. Did you meet with Michael Schaller?
6 A. No.
7 Q. Have you ever met Michael Schaller?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. When did you meet him?
10 A. I guess I met him about two years ago.
11 Q. Okay.
12 A. Two or three years ago.
I didn't know him.
In what context?
He is a member of
13 a textbook team.
We published a textbook with
14 Oxford University Press, and there were seven
15 authors on that team and he was one of them.
16 Q. Did you only meet him that one time?
17 A. I met him, you know, when the textbook
18 team has gotten together to talk about the textbook
19 as we've written it.
20
Q.
Have you ever spoken with Michael Schaller
21 about research for the tobacco companies, research
22 into tobacco?
23 A. No.
24 Q. After you gave your deposition in the
25
Craft case, did you review your deposition?

1 A. Yes.
2 Q. Did you review it with the attorneys?
3 A. No.
4 Q. Did you ever ask any of the attorneys any
I reviewed it independently.
5 questions about what was contained within your
6 deposition?
7 A.
No, I don't believe so.
8 Q.
Did you ever ask him how you did?
9
do good or bad?
Did you ever ask him that?
10 A. No.
11 Q. Were you curious?
12
Did you
MR. KEEHFUS:

13 A. Not necessarily, no.
14 Q. When you read through your deposition in
15
16
17
18
19
the Craft case, did you make notations in it?
A.
I don't recall.
I don't think so.
I made some corrections but that was it.
Q.
You said you made corrections to the
deposition, itself, is that right?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. Did you fill out an errata sheet?
22
I know
Is that
what you did?
23 A. I did, yes.
24 Q. Did you talk with the attorneys about the
25
corrections you were making?

fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 36

2 Q.
No.
So you made the corrections, filled out
3 the sheet and sent it in yourself without talking to
4 anybody about it?
5 A.
6 Q.
7
That's correct.
Did they ever call you or want to talk to
you about the corrections you had made?
8 A.

No.
Since you gave your deposition in Craft,

11 in Craft, which law firms have you been involved
12 with?

23 A. No.

Were they in a -- in a big hotel?

5 rooms anyway.

Q.
I know we were in a couple
Were they like conference rooms or were

11
MR. KEEHFUS:

A.
Just office rooms.
MR. BERG:
And when she's describing
rooms, I'm not exactly sure what --
A.
I would -- I would just describe them as
office rooms.
Q.
Did you go over your expected testimony
with the lawyers at that time?
18

MR. KEEHFUS:
A.

I talked about what my -- my findings

they might ask you?

Did they ask you any specific
questions at all?
4
6
Okay.
Is that what you're saying?
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
No.
Object to the form.
They -- we went over the kinds of
questions I would be asked on the stand, yeah.
Q.
Right.
So they gave you examples of the
11 questions they were going to ask of you once you
12 were sitting on the stand at trial, right?
13 A.
14 Q.
15
16
17
18
Yes.
Did you go over the exhibits with them,
the demonstrative aids that you were going to use?
A.
As I had chosen them, yes, we went over
them.
Q.
Did they have the questions that were
19 going to be asked of you written down on a piece of
20 paper?
21 A.
22 Q.
23 questions?
24 A.
25 Q.
I don't believe so, no.
Did you ever see an outline of any
I -- I don't recall.
Did you ever see or receive any document

954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 44

or see any document that had expected answers on it?
2 A. No.
3 Q. How many days prior to your trial
4
5
testimony did you arrive in Broward County?
A.
I arrived on a Tuesday with the
6 expectation that I might be called to testify on
7 Wednesday, but I ended up not testifying I think
8 until the following day.
9 Q. 10 right? 11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Were they kind enough to get you a
13
You flew down from Massachusetts, is that
first-class ticket?
14 A. No, they weren't.
15 Q. Did they pay for your ticket or did you
16
have to pay for it and get reimbursed?
17 A. I believe I got reimbursed.
18 Q. You submit like an expense report, is that
19 right? 20 A. Yes.
21 Q. What hotel did you stay at?
22 A. I think the hotel was called the Riverside
23
24
25
or something like that in Fort Lauderdale.
Q.
I'm familiar with it.
Let me ask you this:
It's a nice hotel.
You said you arrived on a

2 Wednesday in Ciccone, is that right?
3 A.
4 Q.
5
A.
7 Q.
9
10
11
Okay.
And do you -- you flew into Fort
Lauderdale, I'm assuming, right?
6
8
As I recall, yes.
Yes.
Did you meet with the attorneys on Tuesday
or did you meet with them on Wednesday?
A.
I think we met on Wednesday morning, best
as I can recall, yeah.
Q.
Did you meet again before you gave your
12 testimony after that initial meeting on Wednesday
13 morning?
14 A.
15 Q.
I don't believe so.
After you -- let me ask this:
After you
16 gave your testimony in Ciccone, after you testified
17 in court at the trial, did you ever review your
18 testimony?
19 A.
20 Q.
21
A.
23 Q.
25
Did you ever ask any attorneys any
questions about your testimony?
22
24
Yes, I did.
No, I don't believe so.
Did you -- did you ever see a video of you
sitting on the stand testifying?
A.
Yes.

fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 46

2
Q.
So your testimony was recorded and that
recording was provided to you?
3 A. Yes, it was.
4 Q. Did you watch that recording by yourself
5
or with anybody else?
6 A. As I recall, I watched it with Ms. Segel.
7 Q. And this would have been at the offices of
8
Goodwin Procter in Boston, is that right?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. And watching it with Ms. Segel, did Ms.
11 Segel have any commentary for you regarding your
12 testimony?
13 A.
As I recall, we mainly talked about -- I
14 tend to talk too fast.
15 that the judge called me on, so we talked -- she --
16 we watched the video, and I saw some examples of me
17 speaking too fast and sometimes not projecting
18 enough, so they were mainly issues of presentation
19 on the stand.
20
Q.
It was something actually
Ms. Segel talked with you -- Ms. Segel
21 went over how to better present yourself to the
22 jury, is that right?
23
24
25
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
Again, only presentation in a very narrow
sense; not in terms of substance but in terms of me
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 47
1 talking too fast and sometimes not talking loudly
2 enough.
3
Q.
So by talking louder and talking a little
4 slower, you would have given a better presentation
5 to the jury, right?
6
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
7 A. I can't answer that.
8 Q. So what was the purpose of watching the
9
video with Ms. Segel?
10
11
I don't know.
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
Well, it's something I wanted to do
12 because I wanted -- you know, to see, you know,
13 how -- how I appeared.
14
It's the first time I ever testified in
15 court and I -- you know, I was concerned because as
16 I said, the judge had asked me and the court
17 reporter several times to slow down.
18
So it was a matter of, you know, reviewing
19 just as I sometimes review myself teaching, it's
20 helpful to just get a sense of my presentation
21 style.
22 Q.
23
To help you better improve on your
speaking abilities, right?
24
25
Right.
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
Generally, again, yeah, I guess that's

probably true, yeah.
Q.
Did you speak with any other attorneys
3 outside of Ms. Segel regarding your testimony in the
4 Ciccone case?
5
A.
Not that I recall.

Q.
Ma'am, how much in total compensation have
19 you received from the tobacco company since first
20 agreeing to do this sort of work in 2005?
21
A.
Guessing in the general area of about
22 $200,000.
23 Q.
And you would have submitted invoices
24 evidencing all the hours worked to get you to
25 $200,000 or so?
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 49
1 A. That's correct.
2 Q. What's your salary as a professor?
3
MR. KEEHFUS:
Let me just object here.
4 I have a tough time understanding the relevance of
5 that.
6 much proportion-wise, I think that's fair, but at
7 this point, I'm not going to have a witness tell you
8 what her professional salary is.
If you want to get into questions about how
9
I don't think it's reasonably
10 calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
11 evidence and I think it's overly intrusive.
12 casting personal dispersions on you, Mr. Berg.
13 That's my position.
14
MR. BERG:
15 question again.
16 if you like.
17
Q.
Okay.
I'm going to ask the
You can instruct her not to answer
Ma'am, what's your salary, your yearly
18 salary as a professor at Clark University?
19 MR. KEEHFUS:
20
I'm going to instruct
her not to answer based on the reasons I've given.
21
22
I'm not
MR. BERG:
Q.
Okay.
This past year what proportion of your
23 salary has come from -- what proportion of your
24 total yearly income has come from research in
25 tobacco litigation?

3
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
You can answer.
I would say about half of my salary, my
overall compensation.
4 Q. Just in this past year?
5 A. Yes, in the past year.
6 Q. Over the past year, about how much have
7 you received in compensation from the tobacco
8 companies?
9 A.
I haven't done my taxes yet so -- for next
10 year, obviously, so, again, this is going to be a
11 ballpark figure.
12 ballpark of $80,000.
I'm guessing around in the
13 Q. Close to 80, so --
14 A. Maybe more.
15 Q. So almost half of the total compensation
16 and monies you've received since 2005 from the
17 tobacco company, almost half of that total amount
18 you received in just this past year?
19
MR. KEEHFUS:
20 A. I'm sorry.
21 Q. Okay.
Object to the form.
I don't understand.
A minute ago you had told me that
22 since 2005 you received about a sum total of around
23 $200,000, is that right?
24
25
A.
Actually, can I amend that?
Again, that
was -- it's probably closer to 500,000.
I apologize
United Reporting, Inc

I would say closer to 500,000 total since
That's more than double what you told me a

I'm sorry.
I was thinking about -- I

I guess I'm an absentminded
In any one given year, have you
13 ever made $200,000 from your consulting work or
14 research you've done for tobacco companies?

Since 2005, has the percentage of your
21 income that you've derived from doing research for
22 the tobacco companies, has that percentage remained
23 constant or has it risen over time?
24
25
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
It's not -- I think generally it's fair to
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 52
1 say since 2005 it hasn't been a consistent amount
2 every year, so I'm not quite sure how to answer the
3 question.
4 Q.
What's the least amount of money you've
5 earned from doing research for tobacco companies in
6 any given year?
7
A.
The least amount?
There's at least one
8 year in there that I didn't do any so zero, I
9 suppose.
10 Q. Okay.
11 A. Again, I would have to go back and look.
What year was that?
12 It was very near that.
13 around 2000 -- around 2007.
14 zero, but it was a small amount.
15 go back and look at my records.
16
Q.
I think it was probably
It might not have been
Again, I'd have to
Do you keep records of that sort of thing?
17 Do you have historical records of the compensation
18 you've received from the tobacco companies going
19 back since you first began this research?
20 MR. KEEHFUS:
21
A.
Object to the form.
Oh, I certainly keep track of my hours and
22 add it all up certainly when I do my taxes every
23 spring.
24
25
Q.
Okay.
Do you keep records of all the
hours you've worked in all the various years since
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221

2005?
2 A.
3 Q.
4
Yes, I have.
Okay.
Yes, I have.
Sure.
You keep -- you keep those at home
on your computer?
5 A. No.
6 Q. Okay.
I keep them in a little notebook.
So you have a little notebook where
7 you've tallied up all the hours you've ever worked
8 for tobacco companies, is that right?
9
10
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
What I do, again, to keep -- you know, I
11 basically keep track of how much I work each month
12 so that's how it's broken down.
13
14
Q.
So it's broken down monthly in that little
notebook, is that right?
15 A.
16 Q.
Yes.
Do you have a notation in that notebook as
17 to when your fee changed from $150 an hour to $200
18 per hour?
19 A.
20 Q.
I doubt it.
Have you submitted invoices to Shook,
21 Hardy & Bacon for the work you've done in the Cohen
22 case, this case?
23 A.
24 Q.
25 today?
Yes.
Did you bring any invoices here with you

Are those included?
I'll get into what documents you
5 have with you here a little bit later when we get
6 into detail on that sort of stuff.
7 hours -- well, I'll get to that in a little bit
8 then.

How many
In this case, you're not going to testify
10 at trial as to what Helen Cohen believed at any
11 point in time, are you?
12
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
13 A. No, I'm not, other than --
14 Q. Right.
15 A. If I may continue.
You're not going to --
Some references in the
16 depositions about what she knew at any given time,
17 but in terms of her own personal belief, what was
18 going on in her head, no.
19
20
21
Q.
I don't know what that means.
Can you
explain that to me?
A.
There are just several references in the
22 depositions, particularly those given by Mr. Cohen
23 and their son, Edward Cohen, in which they talk
24 about what they believe she knew at any given time.
25
Q.
Okay.
So my question is, you're not going

2 believed at any point in time, right?
3
A.
That's true.
4
5
MR. KEEHFUS:
Q.
Object to the form.
You're not going to offer any opinions in
6 this case as to what Mrs. Cohen believed regarding
7 the health hazards of smoking at any point in time,
8 right?
9
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. Do you intend on offering any opinion as
12
13
to what Mrs. Cohen understood at any point in time?
A.
Again, there are several references in the
14 depositions about what she said regarding smoking
15 and her family's understanding of what she knew
16 about smoking, so I may make reference to those.
17
Q.
Do you intend on offering any opinion at
18 the trial in this case as to what Mrs. Cohen
19 understood at any point in time?

MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Neither, actually.
Object to the form.
Advertisements, as I

Q.
Okay.
Did you include advertisements for
specific brands?
A.
Again, I selected -- you know, I tried to
13 select sort of a general kind of sampling of
14 different, you know, kinds of cigarette ads, so I
15 wasn't specifically looking for a particular brand.

18
Q.
Okay.
And are those within the -- you
said in the newspaper articles, is that right?
A.
They would be listed -- you know, where it

Q.
Okay.
Did you include any internal
company documents from the tobacco companies?
3 A. No, I did not.
4 Q. Why not?
5 A. Well, again, my charge here as a -- as a
6 social historian, expert witness, to assess public
7 awareness in regards to smoking and health issues
8 and addiction issues is about, you know, looking at
9 information that is readily available to the public,
10 what's part of the information environment.
11 Internal documents by their very nature are
12 internal.
13
They don't go out to the public.
I also should point out I did not look at
14 internal documents from the American Cancer Society
15 or the Massachusetts Department of Health or any
16 other of the many organizations that I looked at
17 either because, again, I'm looking at the
18 information that is disseminated to the public and
19 readily available to them.
20
Q.
Okay.
I only asked you if you included
21 internal company documents on your list.

23 industry believed public perception was regarding

MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
I didn't -- again, I did not look at
3 internal documents of any organization relevant to
4 this case because, again, I'm looking at information
5 that is disseminated widely, deeply to the public.
6 It's part of their information environment.
7
Q.
Okay.
You don't think it would be
8 relevant, though, to know what the tobacco industry
9 believed public perception was regarding smoking and

health?

A.

17 Q.
I'm looking at the information
Are you aware that the internal documents
18 of the tobacco companies are available on the
19 internet?
20
21
22
A.
I understand that they -- many of them
have been released, yes.
Q.
Do you understand that they're keyword

Can you be more

Have you

Q.
We're back from lunch.
Did you have any
12 conversations with anybody about your testimony
13 during the lunch break?
14 A. No.
15 Q. When we left off, we were talking
16 about -- I think we were talking about
17 advertisements, internal company documents.
18 remember that?
19 A. Yes, I do.
20 Q. Okay.
Do you
And you had mentioned to me that
21 some advertisements may be contained within
22 newspaper articles that you gathered from the Boston
23 Globe, is that right?
24
25
A.
Yeah, not within the articles, but they
were included in the newspapers that I researched

separate from the articles.
Q.
So they're not -- so the advertisements,
3 themselves, are they part of the actual resources
4 that I've received?
5 A. Yes, they should be there.
6 Q. So when I get those shortly, I'll be able
7 to talk to you about those.
8 advertisements -- cigarette advertisements from any
9 other sources?
10
A.
Did you seek out
Again, I -- if they appeared, for example,
11 in magazines, which is certainly an important source
12 that I looked at, then I would -- I would make
13 copies.
14
15
Q.
So you made copies as you were going
through magazines of cigarette advertisements?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. What brands of cigarettes did Helen Cohen
18 smoke? 19 A.
I know there were quite a few.
Again, I'd
20 have to look at my -- my notes to be sure, but I do
21 recall that she smoked quite a few different kinds
22 of cigarettes over the years.
23
Q.
24
25
What were some of those brands?
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
Well, some that I can recall and, again, I

3 one point.
4 Q.
5
6
I think Kents at
Did you seek out specific advertisements
for each one of those brands?
A.
No.
Again, I collected articles --
7 advertisements just sort of examples of them as I
8 went through the particular newspapers.
9
10
Q.
You didn't pick out every advertisement
you saw?
11 A. No.
12 Q. Why not?
13 A. You know, I tried to get to sort of a
14
15
general sampling of the ads that were there.
Q.
When you went through the Boston Globe
16 newspaper, did you pull out every single article
17 that had to do with smoking and health?
18
19
20
A.
I tried to be as -- as thorough as I
could, yes.
Q.
You wanted to pull all the articles that
21 you found in the Boston Globe that had to do with
22 smoking and health, right?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. But you didn't do the same thing for any
25
cigarette advertisements that were contained within

2
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
3 A. Yeah, I did copy advertisements.
4 Q. But you didn't copy every single one that
5
you saw in the Boston Globe, did you?
6 A. Not every single one, no.
7 Q. Why would you pull all the articles
8 for -- that discuss smoking and health and not pull
9 out all the cigarette advertisements?
10
11
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
You know, generally, again, I wanted to
12 get, you know, a sample.
13 are repeated over and over, so I tried to get,
14 again, sort of a general, good range of ads.
15
Q.
Okay.
Sometimes advertisements
Did you find that through the
16 Boston Globe that the cigarette advertisements, they
17 repeated themselves over and over and over and they
18 were prevalent?
19
20
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
No.
Object to the form.
I wouldn't say they were prevalent.
21 In fact, beginning in the late '70's, the early
22 '80's, the Globe actually suspended advertisement of
23 cigarettes in their newspaper.

subscriptions to it.

18 ProQuest?
Anybody can access.
Do you have your own subscription to
19 A. No.
20 Q. Whose subscription did you use?
21 A. I used the -- I accessed ProQuest for the
22 most part as I recall through the Clark University
23 library.
24
25

So the library has its own subscription
and you used that subscription?

MR. KEEHFUS:

Q.
Did you make Clark University or any

9 to do research for private consulting work?
10
11
12
A.
As I understand it, that's not a
requirement at my university.
Q.
That's not my question, though.
Did you
13 advise anybody at the university that you were doing
14 that?
15
16
MR. KEEHFUS:

No, I didn't because it's not required.

18 being suggested so, no, I didn't.

Q.
Does anyone at your university, at Clark
University, know that you testify in tobacco trials?
21
MR. KEEHFUS:

10 A. I'm sorry. Would you repeat that?
11 Q. Absolutely. Do these individuals at Clark
12 University, have you told them that you work for law
13 firms or have you told them that you testify live on
14 behalf of tobacco companies at trial?
15
16
MR. KEEHFUS:

information to anybody either, have you?

Q.
Did you meet with any attorneys during

fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 93
1 that visit?
2 A.
3 Q.
No, I did not.
On your Resource List, and I have a copy
4 of it now, I think we marked it as Exhibit 1, did
5 you individually search out and find every item
6 that's contained on your Resource List?
7
A.
I just want to review it quickly.
8
9
(Reviewing document.)
Q.
Take your time.
10 THE WITNESS:
11 (Reviewing document.)
12 A.
13 Q.
Yes.
Or slowly.
To the best of my knowledge I did.
So the Resource List I'm looking at
14 is -- it's 11 pages long and there's got to be
15 literally hundreds of -- hundreds of articles and
16 publications on here, right?
17 A.
18 Q.
Yes, probably.
And you're saying that you found every
19 single one of these items that are listed here on
20 your research list individually all on your own
21 without any help?
22
23
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Yes.
Object to the form.
I think there were maybe four years
24 in the Boston Globe where I had some -- directed
25 some research assistants from Clark University for
United Reporting, Inc

fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 94
1 another case, but other than that, yeah, this is my
2 research.
3 Q.
You never asked any of the attorneys to
4 provide you with any materials or items so you could
5 add them to your Resource List?
6 A. No, I don't believe so.
7 Q. Did any -- has any attorney ever suggested
8 to you that you include an item on your Resource
9 List that wasn't already there?
10 A. Not that I recall.
11 Q. I notice on your Resource List there's
12 various movies and cartoons and things of that
13 nature.
14 those?
Do you recall seeing those and finding

MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
16 A. Yeah, I -- yes, I do.
17 Q. Where did you find all those videos?
I

Q.
Do you recall pulling any -- any cartoon

There are cartoon clips on here, yes.

Resource List.
Q.
That fits the number with the one I'm
10 looking at.
11 Donald Duck?
12
Which number are you looking at?
A.
Do you recall watching cartoons for
I know there were some, you know, Disney
13 cartoons.
14 like one cartoon that sticks out most in my mind is
15 a Goofy cartoon, but there may be a Donald Duck
16 cartoon on here, too.
17
18

20
Q.
There were -- you know, I know there was
Okay.
Where did you go to find this
Donald Duck cartoon?
A.
Oh, gosh.
I'm just not sure.
I don't
recall.
21 Q. Did you find it yourself?
22 A. To the best of my recollection I did.
23 Q. Is it possible that you didn't find it?
24
25
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
I just don't know.

So that's possible that it was provided to
you by somebody else?
3
MR. KEEHFUS:
4 A.
5 Q.
Object to the form.
I'm just not sure.
Okay.
I'm looking at another one of these
6 cartoons it says Donald's Happy Birthday.
7 remember finding that cartoon?
8 No. 53, as well.
9
A.
Do you
It would be under
Again, I know there are a number of
10 cartoons in this period.
11 remember exactly.
12 specifically, but there are quite a few from this
13 era I know that were very antismoking.
14
Q.
I'd have to take a look at it
Where did you go to find all these --
15 these early year cartoons?
16 research those?
17
A.
No, that one I don't
Where did you go to
I know some of them -- at least I
18 found some of them, anyway, at the Museum for
19 Television and Radio in New York City.
20 have -- they have quite an extensive collection
21 which you can actually -- you can keyword search
22 their collection, so it may have come from there.
23 It likely came from there.
24
25
Q.
Okay.
They
So you would go to New York to do
research on these cartoons, is that right?

A.
I know I collected some things there for
sure, yeah.
Q.
Likely I got them there.
Where else would you have gotten the
cartoons from?
A.
There are some on YouTube I know, again,
6 which are pretty -- you know, the YouTube clips are
7 pretty searchable, as well.
8
9
10
11
12
Q.
When you would search YouTube for cartoon
clips, what kind of search terms would you use?
A.
Again, it's been a while since I collected
these, but you can put tobacco, cigarettes, smoking.
Q.
If I go to YouTube and I do a search for
13 tobacco, cigarette smoking, cartoon, it will pull up
14 Donald Duck or Popeye?
15
A.
Is that what you're saying?
Again, I think some of these were
16 collected at different places.
17 before, some of these are collected in New York at
18 the Museum of TV and Radio; others I think came from
19 YouTube.
20
Q.
Okay.
I know, as I said
Can you tell me whether Helen Cohen
21 ever actually saw any of these cartoons you have
22 listed on your Resource List?
23
A.
No.
I can't tell you that she saw any
24 of these, but I do know, again, from this era of
25 the '30's that there was quite a bit of
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 99
1 antismoking -- many antismoking messages in popular
2 culture.
3
Q.
Okay.
That's not what I asked you,
4 though.
5 know whether her family even had a TV in the 1930's?
6
A.
7 1930's.
8 usually.
9
Q.
Do you know whether Helen Cohen -- do you
I don't think many people had TV's in the
People saw cartoons at the movie theater
From what you reviewed in this case, have
10 you seen anything to suggest that Helen Cohen when
11 she was a kid went to the movie theater to watch
12 Donald Duck, Popeye or Wholey Smoke?
13
A.
No, I don't know that, but, again, I know
14 that the '30's, an antismoking message permeated a
15 lot of popular cultures, as well as other sources
16 such as textbooks and health education in
17 Massachusetts and things like that.
18
Q.
I see on your Resource List No. 143.
19 have selections from Ebony.
20 Helen Cohen read Ebony Magazine?
21
A.
No, I'm not.
You
Are you contending that
And what I -- why I looked
22 at Ebony, along with many other sources, is it's
23 one, you know, magazine, one, you know, purveyor of
24 information that, you know, the popular press, it's
25 one example of the popular press, you know,

No, but it's part of the information --

assess.

My question isn't asking you about what
12 information you were asked to assess.
13 simply asking, are you contending that Helen Cohen
14 ever read Ebony Magazine?

MR. KEEHFUS:

I think I said no, but I'll say it again.
No, I'm not contending that.
Q.
Okay, thank you.
That goes for any item
20 on your Resource List.
21 Cohen actually ever read or saw any single one item
22 on your Resource List, right?
23
A.
You can't say that Helen
Well, I do know, again, based on
24 depositions, that the family got the Malden News.
25 David Cohen mentioned that.
He lived in Malden.

9 the family has testified to.

I do know you know there was
Can you point to any single item on your

Not assumptions or probability; with
No, I can't, but I do know, again, that
17 all of this kind -- these resources that are on this
18 list represent the information environment that was,
19 you know, part of Helen Cohen's world from the time
20 she was a child up until the time that she died.

MR. BERG:
I'm asking her another
question.
A.
I guess I feel that I want to give you a
thorough answer.
Q.
Now, I asked you a little bit earlier if
6 you had received any affidavits in this case.
7 you remember that?
Do
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. If David Cohen had filed an affidavit in
10
11
this case, do you think you would want to see it?
A.
Again, I'm not a lawyer.
I'm not even
12 sure what is in an affidavit, to be honest with you.
13 I, you know, had a very specific charge in this case
14 to be an expert witness, which was about regarding
15 the information environment, public awareness
16 regarding smoking and health, so that's what my main
17 concern was and that was what I researched in this
18 case.
19
Q.
If there was a sworn statement filed in
20 this case by David Cohen, would you want to read
21 it --

I'm not sure

is?
If David Cohen filed a sworn statement in
this case, would you want to read it?

MR. KEEHFUS:
A.

If it was information that related to my
11 charge to -- to assess public awareness regarding
12 smoking and health, then, yes, but I don't know --

14 A.

16
If this -- were you finished?
Yes, I'm finished.

22
And you understand that an
Object to the form.
Okay.
Do you understand that?
Well, yes, I guess, if you're telling me
that's what it is.
Q.
Okay.
If the affidavit filed by David
23 Cohen in this case talked about various cigarette
24 advertisements that they were exposed to over the
25 course of their life, would you want to see his
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 104
1 statement so you could figure out what ads those
2 might be?
3
4
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
Again, I don't -- I'm -- my role here,
5 again, and I keep saying this ad nauseam so forgive
6 me, is to, you know, look at the larger information
7 environment.
8
9
Cigarette ads were part of that
environment.
I included them, as I said, on my
10 Resource List and I included them, weighed them as
11 part of my evidence in drawing my conclusions about
12 public awareness.
13
Q.
In addition to advertising, the tobacco
14 industry actually took -- they actually took
15 positions, public positions, right?
16 smoking and health?
17
18
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
With regard to
Object to the form.
When the tobacco company made statements
19 in the public, I included that information when it
20 showed up in newspapers and magazines, yes.
21
Q.
If Helen Cohen had been exposed to one of
22 these industry statements regardless of whether it
23 was in a newspaper or magazine, would you have
24 wanted to see it?

I did research this information
environment which did include industry statements.
Q.
Did you include any industry statements on
your Resource List?
5
6
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
Industry statements as they appeared in
7 magazines and newspapers, again, as part of the
8 information that was readily accessible by the
9 public, yes, I did include those.
10
11
Q.
Did you include advertisements for
filtered cigarettes on your Resource List?
12 A. Yes, I'm sure I did.
13 Q. Which brands of filtered cigarettes did
14
15
you include on your list?
A.
Again, I would need to go back and -- and
16 look at the actual files because, again, a lot of
17 this has been collected over a number of years, so I
18 would need to go back and refresh my memory.
19
Q.
If David Cohen recalled seeing
20 representatives of tobacco companies on television
21 saying that filters made cigarettes safer, would you
22 have wanted to go and look at those tobacco company
23 statements?
24
25
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
Well, I have looked at a number of
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 106
1 statements made by both the tobacco industry as well
2 as the Public Health Service, particularly in the
3 '50's, '60's, '70's -- well, really up through the
4 '90's regarding filtered cigarettes, so I have
5 certainly collected that kind of information.
6
Q.
Have you included on your Resource List
7 statements by representatives of the tobacco
8 companies, statements to the effect that filters
9 made cigarettes safer?
10
those on your Resource List?
11
12
Have you included any of
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
Again, if they made those kinds of
13 statements and they were reported in the press, the
14 Globe, the Palm Beach Post, the Sun Sentinel, et
15 cetera, made the newspapers that I have collected, I
16 certainly would have included that, yes.
17
The fact is, you know, the public
18 health -- if I may continue, there was quite a bit
19 of scientific -- many scientific studies that came
20 out in the '60's and '70's and even into the early
21 '80's from the American Cancer Society and Public
22 Health Service officials that actually said that
23 filters were safer.
24
25
Q.
That wasn't really my question, but let me
ask it again.
If David Cohen said that him and his
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 107
1 wife, Helen, saw representatives of the tobacco
2 companies on television saying that filters made
3 cigarettes safer, would you want to go look at those
4 statements made on television?
5
6
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
Again, I feel I did a thorough job
7 researching television news shows and Evening News,
8 The Today Show, a lot -- you know, as many of those
9 TV shows that I could get my hands on, so if they
10 said that, I'm pretty confident I would have come
11 across it and I would have included it, yes.
12
Q.
Did you ever ask what statements David
13 Cohen was referring to?
14 attorneys that?
15
16
17
A.
No.
Did you ever ask the
I didn't ask the attorneys about
questions regarding my research, no.
Q.
On your Resource List, are you including
18 any television clips, any clips of television
19 programs where individuals from the tobacco industry
20 are seen stating they don't believe cigarettes are
21 injurious to health?
22
A.
I did include television clips.
23 Oftentimes, you know, when a new scientific study
24 would come out or Surgeon General's report, there
25 would be a spokesperson for the tobacco industry.
I

954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 108

certainly included that.
2
My recollection is the usual response of
3 the tobacco industry was that there was more
4 research needed whenever these studies came out.
5
Q.
Okay.
Which of these statements have you
6 included in your -- on your Resource List?
7 can I find them?
8
9
A.
Well, they're all through it.
Where
You mean in
terms of television?
10 Q. Yes.
11 A. Okay.
Specifically in terms of television.
I guess I would go to No. -- I
12 don't know if you have the list.
13 Resource List?
14
Do you have the
83, which is summarized as "Experts from
15 various television news broadcast and special
16 reports including, but not limited to, See It Now,
17 ABC, CBS, NBC, Evening News, and the Wolfson
18 Archives, dated 1953-1990."
19 those have a spokesperson from the tobacco industry.
20
Q.
As I recall, many of
And you included those statements from the
21 tobacco company representatives in your TV -- in
22 your clips or TV clips that are on your Resource
23 List and provided to me here?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. Do you believe that the public paid
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 109
1 attention to the tobacco company statements that
2 were made in print and on TV?
3
MR. KEEHFUS:
4 A. I'm sorry.
5 Q. Sure.
Object to the form.
Would you repeat the question?
Do you believe that the public, the
6 American public paid attention to the tobacco
7 industry statements that were made in the '40's,
8 '50's?
9 attention to those?
10
A.
Do you think that the American public paid

11 the information environment.
12 be looked at as any historical document needs to be
13 and in context.
14 know, from -- from one source.
15 message reiterated, echoed, repeated in other
16 places.
17
I think they have to
They were one message coming, you
I don't see their
And, again, as, you know, based on all the
18 research that I did in this information environment,
19 I concluded that the public was aware of the dangers
20 of cigarette smoking and its addictive nature
21 because they were getting that message from so many
22 sources, you know, in this period that I looked at.
23
Q.
You just said that it's your opinion that
24 the public was aware of the dangers of smoking and
25 its addictive nature.
When are you contending that

954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 110

2
the public became aware of this?
A.
It's clear to me from my research that,
3 you know, from the early 20th Century on that there
4 was a clear, you know, awareness that cigarettes
5 were dangerous; that they were lethal and they were
6 habit-forming.
7
And going back to the earliest days of the
8 introduction of tobacco, there were many concerns
9 that it, you know, enslaved people, as they said it
10 at the time, and created all kinds of health
11 problems.
12 Q. Now, you keep referring to the public was
13 aware. What percentage of the American population
14 do you think constitutes the public?
15
16
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
I don't -- you know, I'm not going to put
17 a particular percentage on it.
In going back to
18 my -- the way, you know, I think I clearly defined
19 public awareness, public awareness is based, again,
20 on this information that's readily available to

What sort of health problems are you

8 that the general public was aware of in the 1920's
9 and '30's?
10
A.
Well, in looking at, you know, the
11 Massachusetts guidelines for health education, for
12 example, for the years that Mrs. Cohen started
13 school until the time she graduated public schools,
14 the '20's, '30's and '40's.
15
As early as 1896, the State of
16 Massachusetts mandated health education beginning in
17 the elementary grades saying that tobacco or
18 nicotine is a poison; that it causes all kinds of
19 health problems, including what they called tobacco
20 heart.
21 caused mouth cancer and caused tongue cancer.
22 '20's and '30's that gets, you know, reiterated

25 Public Schools where Mrs. Cohen went to school.

Again, the '30's we see, again, textbooks,

13 already, that reference, you know, cigarettes being
14 dangerous.
15 The turn of the 20th Century people were

13 information that was available to anybody else.

And, yet, despite this abundance of

16 the tobacco industry continued to deny the ill
17 health effects of smoking, right?

19
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
Again, I think it was mostly -- again, as
20 I recall from my own research, generally, the
21 tobacco industry's response was that, you know, the
22 scientific studies were not yet conclusive; that
23 more research needed to be done.
24
25
Q.
Okay.
At any point during the 20th
Century, did the tobacco industry share your opinion

Right.
When did the tobacco industry,
8 when did the tobacco companies admit that there was
9 a link between smoking and cancer?
10
11
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
I think the first public statements that
12 came from the tobacco industry were in the late
13 '90's, around 2000.
14
Q.
When did the tobacco industry, tobacco
15 companies, when did they finally admit that there
16 was a link between COPD and smoking?

19
20
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Again, I'm not sure exactly when they
specifically cited COPD.

I have no idea what that means.
Yeah, again, I -- I don't quite understand
the question.
Q.
Sure.
If the general public in your
5 opinion was so aware of the health effects of
6 smoking going back decades, did it make sense, does
7 it make sense to you that the tobacco industry would
8 deny those very same -- those very same ill health
9 effects up until the late '90's?

22 that was out in the public realm, right?

5
Q.
Right.
And, apparently, from what you
6 said, as a member of the public, the tobacco
7 companies and tobacco industry didn't believe --

When did Helen Cohen -- strike that.
When
did Helen Cohen first start smoking?
A.
According to the depositions, she started
20 roughly when she was 16 years old, which would be
21 around 1940.
22 Q. When did she quit?
23 A. I believe she quit in 1992.
24 Q. How many years is it from 1940 to 1992?
25 A. Can I use a pen?
Sorry.
I'm a historian.

2 A. That's why I'm a historian; not a math --

I would say 52 years exactly, yes.

During those 52 years, did Helen

6 during those 52 years?
7
8
9
10
11
MR. KEEHFUS:

According to the depositions, she
attempted to quit several times, yes.
Q.
When was the first time Helen Cohen tried
to quit?
12
13
Object to the form.
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
I know she talked about quitting I think
14 soon after the Cohens were married and then there
15 were a number of times after that.

and her daughter in 1955.
2 Q. When was Helen Cohen diagnosed with COPD?
3 A. Again, as I recall, there seems to be some
4 conflicting evidence about that, so I don't -- I
5 don't think I can really say for sure.
6
Q.
I'm looking at the second page of your
7 notes there right in the middle.
8 It says Helen diagnosed with COPD in '90's.
9 recall writing that?
10
A.
I'm just reading.
Do you
Yeah, I did, and then I know subsequently
11 I think with some of the other depositions, there
12 was some -- you know, some issues brought into play
13 there that made that a little bit unclear, so that's
14 what I recall.
15 Q. What depositions made it unclear to you?
16 A. Again, I'd have to take a look, but I know
17 there were some questions I think maybe toward the
18 end of one of the later volumes of David's
19 deposition, I believe, but, again, I'd have to look
20 at it in much more detail.
21
Q.
So it's your understanding that it's
22 David's deposition?
23 referencing?
24

Is that what you're

Q.
The last bullet point you have on your
2 notes, which are marked as Exhibit -- looks like
3 Exhibit 3, on the last bullet point on the second
4 page just above Edward Cohen's name you have "saw TV
5 show in 1970 about filtered cigs 'and as a result'
6 switched to filtered cigs - claimed someone on show
7 said filters 'less injurious to a person's health.'"
8 Were you able to find that TV show?
9 for it?
10
A.
Did you look
I -- you know, again, I've done a thorough
11 search through the Vanderbilt archives on news
12 shows.
13
I didn't find that particular one.
I do know, again, based on research that
14 I've done that there were, you know, quite a few
15 studies, including some from the American Cancer
16 Society in that era, the late '60's and early '70's,
17 that actually, you know, suggested that it was
18 better to smoke a filtered cigarette; and some of
19 that, you know, information is actually disseminated
20 through the U.S. Public Health Service, that if
21 you -- you know, there's a whole, you know, very --
22 a whole pamphlet that's published in 'the 60's and
23 reproduced again in the '70's that says that if you
24 must smoke, you know, smoke a filtered cigarette and
25 that actually is something that the American Cancer

3 information.
4 all the extra information about the cancer society?

7
Why do you feel compelled to give me
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
Don't argue with the witness.
A.
Well, you asked me specifically if I found
8 that show and I didn't, but I know the context
9 within which, you know, that kind of information was
10 given and so, again, as a social historian, I think
11 that's pretty important.
12
13
Q.
Are you going to hold your promise about
not being an advocate?

21 Service said.
22 I'm just commenting on the research that I've
23 uncovered for this case.
24
25
Q.
I mean, the facts are the facts, and
I'm going to ask a specific question.
Did
you seek out and find the TV show that David Cohen

-- that's listed at the last bullet point
above Edward Cohen's name on page two of your notes?
5

Object.
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
Asked and answered.
A.
Again, I did a thorough search through the
8 Vanderbilt archives of, you know, TV shows that, you
9 know, reference this kind of information.
I didn't
10 find a specific TV show that seemed to fit this
11 particular description.
12
13
Q.
Did you look at -- you looked at news
shows, you said?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. What other TV shows did you look at?
16 A. I've looked at, like, The Today Show.
In
17 1970, it would be mostly, you know, TV news shows
18 and Today Show.
19
20
21
22
23
Q.
I think those were the main ones.
You didn't look at any other TV shows
during that period of time, 1970?
A.
I may have looked at, like, some sitcoms
and things from that period.
Q.
As we're sitting here today, you don't
24 have a recollection of looking at any other TV shows
25 besides the ones you've listed, the news shows and

the two other ones that you described?
2
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
3 A. From -- from 1970 specifically?
4 Q. Yeah.
5 A. Again, I'd have to look at my Resource
6 List, but I don't recall at the moment beyond
7 evening news shows and The Today Show television
8 news shows that, you know, were relevant to this
9 kind of question.
10
Q.
Okay.
Is the TV show that David Cohen
11 referenced in his deposition, is that relevant to
12 your research?
13
A.
Well, it would be one, you know, piece of
14 the information environment that's out there and if
15 I, you know, could have found it, I certainly would
16 have included it.
17
Q.
Did you ever make a specific attempt to
18 find the specific TV show that David Cohen
19 referenced?
20 A.
Well, again, I had done a very thorough
21 search and looked at everything that's available for
22 1970 and I did not find a specific show in which,
23 you know, an individual claimed that filtered were
24 "less injurious" to a person's health.
25
Q.
How many different TV shows did you look

at for the year 1970?
A.
I'd have to go back and look at --
specifically at my -- you know, my listings.
Q.
Are you contending that you looked at
every single TV show that aired in 1970?

They're the main
it, so I looked at what they have for 1970.
Q.
That was the only place that you looked
was at the Vanderbilt archives?
A.
Yes.
That's -- that's the main repository
for television news.
Q.
Did you ever ask any of the attorneys if
16 they were able to find the TV show that David Cohen
17 was referencing in 1970?
18
A.
No.
Because as I said before, I don't ask
19 the attorneys questions about -- as I'm conducting
20 my own research.
21
22
Q.
Okay.
I do this independently.
If you're having an issue finding
something, who do you ask for help?
23
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
24 A. I'm not sure I ask anybody for help.

6 otherwise be relevant and should be on it?

A.
No.
I'm confident in my Resource List.

I
I've included -- you know, done a
13 In any historical research, whether it's
14 contemporary or whether it's, you know, a hundred
15 years ago, the historical record is never complete.
16
So, you know, it's the historian's duty
17 to be as thorough as possible, to collect, you
18 know, the information that's most relevant and to
19 build -- to draw conclusions from those sources.
20
Q.
Isn't it true that Helen Cohen indicated
21 that she smoked filtered cigarettes because they
22 were less harmful than regular cigarettes?
23 MR. KEEHFUS:
24
25
A.
Object to the form.
I think David Cohen, again, in his
deposition testified that they had switched to
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221

1 filtered cigarettes because they felt they were not
2 as or less, you know, injurious, less harmful.
3 But, again, that's something that the
4 Public Health Service, the American Cancer Society,
5 a lot of other health organizations were advocating
6 at that time, so...
7
Q.
What other research have you done specific
8 to this case besides the Boston -- besides looking
9 at the Boston Herald, the Malden Evening News, the
10 Boston Globe, the Randolph Herald, the Sun Sentinel
11 and Palm Beach Post?
12 original research have you done specific to this
13 case?

What other original --
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.

19 Committee.

21 period of the '20's and '30's and early '40's when

There's not one of those on
I don't think so.
I think these are just
the individual invoices.

Right.
And I'm referring to -- I'm
6 referring to a total amount for -- your total hours
7 and your total amount of money billed in this case,
8 in the Cohen case.
9 A. I'm sorry.
10 Q. Sure.
What was the question?
There's no -- on any of these
11 invoices, it's not indicated how many total hours or
12 total amount of money you've billed in the entire,
13 you know, for all of your work that you've done on
14 the Cohen case, right?
15 A. I don't think so, no.
16 Q. During the lunch hour, though, I went
17 through and just quickly added it up.
18 about 196, a little over 196 hours.
19 about right to you?

8 Q. I didn't tally up your expenses.

way?
Just
looking at -- I'm going to flip back to the last
10 page of that exhibit.
11 an eight-page exhibit, so it's the very last page,
12 and I see the date at the top left is November 1st
13 through November 30th, 2012?
It's the eighth page and it's
14 A. Right.
15 Q. I guess they're not in order.
16 to go to the seventh page.
17 is out of order.
18 I see a date at the top left.
19 2011, through January 31st, 2012.
I'm sorry.
We're going
The one page
The seventh page of that exhibit,
It's December 1st,
20 A. Right.
21 Q. Would this page be the first invoice that
22
23
you issued for work you've done on this case?
A.
24
25
Let me just check here.
(Reviewing document.)
A.
Yeah, it is.
That seems about right

954-525-2221

because I started about a year ago.
Q.
Just to be clear, this exhibit constitutes
3 all of the invoices that you've issued in this case,
4 right?
5 A.
Yes.
6 Q.
So it looks like -- did you have
7 something?
8 A.
9
I'm sorry.
There would still be -- I
would have filed one December 1.
10 one is here.
11 November.
December 1, 2012.
I don't think that
We just have
That there would be a December 1.
12 MR. KEEHFUS: There would?
13 THE WITNESS: Yeah.
14 MR. KEEHFUS: Even though the month is
THE WITNESS: I would have -- oh,
15
not over?
16
17 wait.
18 November 1 through 30th I would have filed on
19 December 1.
20
Q.
I'm wrong.
I'm sorry.
No.
Sorry.
No.
Sorry.
Is that your typical practice, to issue an
21 invoice for services rendered on the first day of
22 the month?
23 A.
The 1st of the month, yes.
24 Q.
Have you issued an invoice for services
25
The
rendered on the 1st of each month for the past five
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 130
1 years?
2 A.
No, because it would depend.
I mean,
3 there's some months that I'm not working on
4 anything, so it would vary a lot.
5
Q.
It appears that the invoice on
6 December -- from December 1st, 2011, to
7 January 31st, 2012, it appears about 18 and a half
8 hours of research at $200 an hour.
9
Can you flip with me, please, to the
10 second page of that exhibit, second page.
11 a date at the top of August 1st through September
12 30th, 2012.
13 A.
Yes.
14 Q.
And I see there's different descriptions
15 of the time that you billed.
16 prep and then there's hours research.
17 that?
It's got
There's hours witness
Do you see
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. What is "witness prep"?
20 A. Well, it covers a number of things.
21 Because I'm not writing an expert report in this
22 case, the time that I spend witness prep can include
23 the time I spend just sort of going through my
24 sources.
25 them, analyzing them, beyond just the research which
You know, sifting through them, weighing
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 131
1 is sort of collecting the information, so it
2 includes that time.
3 occasionally meeting with the attorneys to give
4 them -- show them some examples of the kinds of
5 things I'm finding to tell them, you know, about the
6 conclusions that I've drawn, so it's sort of a
7 number of things that fall into that category.
8
9
Q.
Okay.
It also includes, you know,
So you listed the witness prep
would include your analyzing the documents, is that
10 right?
11 A.
Yeah, in other words, you know, the time
12 that I would normally spend, you know, like, for
13 example, writing an expert report, which I'm not in
14 this case, I still need to pull the things -- you
15 know, pull the information together to go through it
16 and to think about, you know, analyzing what I
17 found, weighing it, drawing conclusions from -- from
18 the research that I've collected.
19
20
Q.
It's fair to say you don't analyze
the research as you're finding it, is that right?
21
22
Okay.
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Well, some of it.
Object to the form.
I mean, you know, again
23 I think it's important as part of the historical
24 method that, you know, you go into your research
25 with as open a mind as anybody can and so, I mean, I
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 132
1 certainly may be reading through the various things
2 I'm collecting, but in terms of, you know, being
3 able to look at all of the research, you know, in
4 toto that I've done and getting a broader sense of
5 everything that I've looked at, that requires, you
6 know, a different kind of time commitment I suppose
7 and, you know, the chance to sit down and, you know,
8 draw conclusions from the things that I've selected.
9
10
11
Q.
And witness prep also includes
conversations with attorneys?
A.
Yeah, I met occasionally with the
12 attorneys again to often, you know, show them some
13 examples of the kinds of things that I've found, the
14 kinds of sources I'm basing my -- my conclusions on,
15 what I'm concluding.
16
Q.
From what I can tell, first time that you
17 bill for witness prep is August 27, 2012, is that
18 right?
19 A.
20
I'd have to look.
Let me see.
(Reviewing document.)
21 A. Yeah, it looks that way.
22 Q. So is it fair to say you didn't have any
23 contact with any attorneys between December 5th,
24 2011, and August 27th, 2012?
25
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.

954-525-2221

1 A.
Between August and October.
2 had -- 3 Q. 4 A. August of -- I'm sorry.
5 Q. You have the dates wrong.
I would have
Between --
Say that again.
I just want to
6 help you out with the dates.
7 December 5th, 2011, through August 27, 2012.
8
9
A.
I was talking from
There may have been some, you know, phone
calls, some conversations in there.
Probably
10 nothing very extensive because, again, this is a
11 period where I was mainly doing my research and
12 collecting information.
13
Q.
Is there a reason why you didn't bill the
14 tobacco companies for the work you performed between
15 December 5th, 2011, and August 27th, 2012?
16 MR. KEEHFUS:
17 A.
18 Q.
I did bill them for research.
Okay.
19 though, right?
20 phone?
21
22
You spoke with them on the phone,
You spoke with attorneys on the
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
Object to the form.
Again, you know, I don't recall specific
23 conversations.
You know, I can't say exactly.
24 There may have been like some very brief
25 conversations or something.
I just don't remember
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 134
1 and, obviously, you know, I didn't bill for that
2 time so there mustn't have been much contact during
3 that period.
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
Q.
Are you contending that there wasn't any
contact?
A.
No. I said probably not much is what I
Okay. So that would mean that there was
said.
Q.
some contact between -- during that time period,
right?
11
12
13
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form of
the question.
A.
Again, all I have to go on here, you know,
14 are -- are these dates and my hours and so I don't
15 really want to speculate beyond that.
16
Q.
Okay.
So if you only want to look at your
17 dates and your hours, you have no notation of
18 witness prep, any hours expensed for witness prep
19 between December 5th and August 27th, 2012, right?
20 A. As far as I can tell, that's true, yes.
21 Q. Okay.
And are you contending that you had
22 no communication with any attorney for the tobacco
23 companies during that time period?
24
25
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
This is asked and answered several times now.
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 135
1
A.
No.
I said I -- you know, there probably
2 were some brief conversations in there.
3 some phone calls, you know, but, again, I'm -- you
4 know, don't have that in the record.
5
Probably
So I assume there were not any, you know,
6 extensive meetings by any means, but there
7 probably -- there probably was some contact.
8 can't again tell you how much, but it mustn't have
9 been much because I didn't bill them for the time.
10
Q.
Do you typically -- do you typically --
11 let me ask you this:
12 do you often avoid billing the tobacco company
13 attorneys for time spent working on tobacco
14 litigation research?
15
A.
17 that I do.
18 Q.
19 A.
20 Q.
22
Do you typically not bill --
MR. KEEHFUS:
16
21
No.
Object to the form.
I bill them for what I -- the work
You bill them for your time, right?
Yes.
And part of your time is spent talking to
lawyers on the phone?
A.
Again, if I didn't bill them, I assume it
23 wasn't a very long conversation.
24 the minute.
25
I
Q.
I don't bill by
Do you do that often where you, you know,
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 136
1 don't bill for your time?
2 tobacco companies for your time?
3 often?
4 A.
7
Do you do that
No.
5
6
You don't bill the
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form of
the question.
A.
No.
Again, I think I'm trying to be as
8 clear as can I here.
9 I'm guessing they were pretty fleeting conversations
I think these were very brief.
10 that I did not, you know, obviously take note of
11 and, you know, bill particular, you know, time for.
12
13
Q.
At the bottom of each of these invoices
there's a number there.
What's that number?
14 A. That would be my Social Security number.
15 Q. Okay.
Do you have -- when you receive
16 checks from the attorneys or from the tobacco
17 companies, are they made out to you, personally, or
18 are they made out to a PA or some corporation?
19
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
20 A. They're made out to me, personally.
21 Q. When was the first time you met
22
23
24
25
Mr. Keehfus?
A.
I believe I first met him this fall,
probably in September.
Q.
And that was a face-to-face meeting?
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 137
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. Okay.
3 Cohen case?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. Where did you meet him?
6 A. At Goodwin, Boston.
7 Q. Had he traveled out there just to meet
8 with you?
9
It was regarding this case, the
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
10 A. I don't know.
11 Q. How long was that meeting?
12 A. Again, I -- I don't recall.
13 Q. Generally, how long was it?
14
hour?
Two hours?
15
16
17
Ten hours?
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Was it an
Object to the form.
I think generally we would meet for two
hours or so.
18 Q. And what did you discuss?
19 A. I showed him -- I brought -- I remember
20 specifically bringing examples of my research, some
21 examples from the Randolph Herald, some from the
22 textbooks that were used in the Boston school
23 system, some of the health curriculum guidelines
24 issued by the State of Massachusetts in the 1930's,
25 some examples from -- did I say Randolph Herald

2 Beach Post.
3
4
Q.
I think I did.
What about these examples of your research
did you discuss?
5
A.
Probably from the Palm
What was the discussion about?
I tried to select some examples that I
6 thought were very typical of, you know, the kinds of
7 things that I was finding, again, to give him, you
8 know, some really good concrete examples of some of
9 the information, you know, that was in the, you
10 know, public sphere in this period.
11 was generally what our conversation was about.
12
Q.
I think that
You wanted to give him an idea about what
13 you were finding in the public realm.
14 you said?
Is that what
15 A. Generally, yes.
16 Q. Did you show Mr. Keehfus any of the
17
cigarette advertisements you were finding?
18
A.
I think there was one actually from the
19 Malden paper.
20 '40's included in that.
I think there was an ad from the
21 Q. You just showed him that one ad?
22 A. Yeah, I think that was the only one that
23 really appeared in that newspaper, one of a very
24 few.
25
Q.
During your research with the Malden
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 139
1 paper, did you include on your Resource List all of
2 the ads that were present in that paper, all the
3 cigarette ads?
4
A.
No.
Again, I -- as I said before, I
5 didn't collect all of the ads that I came across in
6 either the Malden paper or any of the other
7 newspapers.
8 of examples that appeared in the newspapers and
9 magazines.
10
Q.
You know, I collected a kind of range
Did Mr. Keehfus express his satisfaction
11 with what you were finding?
12 MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
13 A. I'm not sure what you mean by that.
14 Q. Did he tell you you were doing a good job?
15 A. I don't recall, you know, whether he said
16 that specifically.
17 know, pretty happy with the thoroughness of my work.
18
19
Q.
I think he generally seemed, you
He was pretty happy with what you had
found, right?
20
MR. KEEHFUS:
21
A.
Object to the form.
Again, in the sense that I think he seemed
22 to, you know, like the fact that I was -- you know,
23 had sought -- had tried to, you know, do a thorough
24 job.
25
Q.
He wasn't displeased with what you had
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 140
1
found, was he?
2 A. Displeased?
3 Q. Now, that was back in September.
Not to my knowledge.
When was
4 the next time -- well, let me ask you this:
5 else was at that meeting in September at Goodwin
6 Procter?
7
8
A.
Who
Jackie Segel was also present at that
meeting.
9 Q. Anybody else?
10 A. No.
11 Q. Was there anyone on the phone?
12 A. I don't recall.
13 Q. When was the next meeting regarding the
14
Cohen case after September?
15
16
17
(Reviewing document.)
A.
It looks like we had a meeting maybe
October 19th.
18 Q. And where was that meeting?
19 A. That was also in Boston at Goodwin.
20 Q. And who was present for that meeting?
21 A. Jackie Segel and Jason.
22 Q. Anybody else?
23 A. I don't recall, again, whether anybody
24 else -- no one was there, physically there.
25 recall if there was anybody on, you know, the phone
I don't

2
3
or not.
Q.
Okay.
So there was nobody on the phone at
that meeting on October 19th?
4 A. Again, I just don't recall.
5 Q. Okay.
And I'm just looking at your
6 invoice, the second page of your invoices,
7 Exhibit 2.
8 September at Goodwin Procter was on September 7th?
9 Does that sound like -- does that look right
10
Does it look like the meeting you had in
according to your invoice?
11 A. That could be -- that could be, yeah.
12 Q. Is there any other date it could have
13
been?
14 A. In September?
15 Q. Okay.
I don't think so.
You most certainly billed for your
16 time at that meeting at Goodwin Procter in
17 September, right?
18
19
A.
Did I bill for it?
Yeah, it's on the list
here.
20 Q. Okay.
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Okay.
And that's September 7th?
A minute ago you told me that
23 meeting was about two hours.
24 invoice, do you want to change that answer?
25
A.
No.
After looking at your
Because as I recall I went home
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 142
1 and -- you know, and continued to work through my
2 sources.
3
Q.
So you did three hours of work on
4 September 7th outside of that meeting, is that
5 correct?
6
7
8
9
10
A.
Yeah, I must have because that's what I
have written down, yeah.
Q.
Do you charge -- do you charge the tobacco
companies for your travel time?
A.
I usually do.
Some of that actually might
11 have been involved in that, too, like an hour up and
12 an hour back, so there might have been like -- I
13 know I worked on the train both ways, so there was
14 some additional work being done.
15
Q.
At this meeting on October 19th at Goodwin
16 Procter, it looks like that meeting -- was that
17 meeting about four hours, four and a half hours?
18
A.
Yeah, it -- I think it was probably about,
19 you know, maybe -- maybe two and a half and, again,
20 I often, you know, work on the train up and back, so
21 I probably included that time as well.
22
Q.
From looking through your -- never mind.
23 What was -- what was the purpose of that meeting on
24 October 19th?
25
A.
Again, I think it was mostly talking
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 143
1 about, you know, probably, again, doing a little bit
2 of show and tell with some of the research that I'd
3 found.
4
There probably was some discussion about,
5 you know, the trial date and, you know, the possible
6 deposition dates and things like that, some
7 technical things and dates to get on my calendar
8 regarding this particular case.
9 Q. What was discussed about a trial date?
10 A. I think I was told at that time that it
11
12
13
14
would probably be sometime in February.
Q.
At that meeting on October 19th, did you
provide dates of availability for your deposition?
A.
I probably did.
I know I certainly did at
15 one of these meetings, so it very likely was that
16 date.
17
18
Q.
You provided the dates in person, right?
You didn't do it over the phone?
19 A. Yeah, I think I did it in person, yeah.
20 Q. At that meeting on October 19th, did you
21 discuss with either Mr. Keehfus or Ms. Segel your
22 availability in February to appear live at the
23 trial?
24 A.
25
We probably talked about that, but I just
don't -- I don't recall any specifics.
I just know
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 144
1 that I, you know, had gotten information that the
2 trial was likely to go in February.
3
Q.
Would you have talked to them about your
4 upcoming class schedule and your teaching
5 responsibilities?
6 A. I don't recall talking about that.
7 Q. Would that be a factor in your
8
availability to appear at trial?
9
MR. KEEHFUS:
10
11
12
Object to the form.
A. Possibly.
I -- I just don't know for sure
Q. Would you be willing to cancel class and
yet.
13 reschedule it to a later date in order for you to
14 appear live at trial?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Would you tell your students why you were
17
cancelling class?
18
19
I would be willing to do that.
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
Again, I haven't really thought about
20 that.
21 there's a reason to cancel class, I usually don't
22 feel like I need to give them a reason.
23 happy not to have class.
24 me on it.
25 Q.
I doubt it.
I usually don't -- you know, if
They're
They're not going to fight
Let's put it that way.
If one of your students asked you why you
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 145
1
had canceled class, would you tell them?
2 A. Yeah, I probably would.
3 Q. Do you know what schools in Massachusetts
4
Helen Cohen attended, if any?
5
6
Sure.
(Reviewing document.)
A.
We know that she attended the Dorchester
7 High School For Girls and graduated -- from '38 to
8 '42 and graduated in 1942.
9
10
Q.
Do you know any other schools that she
attended?
11 A. No, I don't.
12 Q. Do you know when Helen Cohen knew that
13
smoking could cause lung cancer?
14
15
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
Again, I don't -- you know, as a social
16 historian, I don't, you know, make the case that I
17 can get inside Helen Cohen's head to know -- to
18 have, you know, any evidence of what she knew or
19 what she believed, but I do know, again, from David
20 Cohen's deposition that they discussed the 1964
21 Surgeon General's report and, you know, had talked
22 about quitting smoking at that time.
23
24
25
Q.
You don't know when Helen Cohen knew that
smoking could cause COPD, do you?
A.
No, I don't know, but, again, you know,

1 concerns about tobacco use and circulation go way
2 back and certainly were -- that kind of information
3 was out there in the '20's and '30's and mentioned

Q.
As part of your research on this case, did
6 you go and visit the neighborhoods where Helen Cohen
7 grew up?
8 A. No, I did not.
9 Q. Did you drive by any of the schools that
10
she may have attended?
11 A. No.
12 Q. Did you do any research into any
13 billboards that may have been in the vicinity of her
14 home or school?
15
A.
I've never seen any information like that
16 in all of the research I've done in Massachusetts.
17 That kind of information.
18 Q. 19 billboards?
20 A. Billboards from the 1920's and '30's?
21 Q. '30's, '40's, '50's.
22 A. No.
23 Q. Have you ever --

Have
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
In all the research that I've done in
5 Massachusetts, which has been pretty extensive, I've
6 never come across information regarding -- you know,
7 or examples of billboards, for example, in
8 neighborhoods unless they showed up, you know, in a
9 discussion in a newspaper report; that's the only
10 place I think I've ever seen anything like that and
11 it was much later, like in the 1990's.
12 Q.
13 this case?
14 A.
What opinions do you intend to offer in
I intend to testify that the public was
15 aware of the dangers of cigarettes.
16 caused a whole range of health problems; that they
17 were also habit-forming and addictive in this period
18 roughly of -- sorry -- of Helen Cohen's lifetime
19 beginning with the 1920's up through the time of her
20 death in 1992.
21
22
Q.
25
When you say that the public was aware,
what do you mean by "the public"?
23
24
Cigarettes
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
By "the public" I mean, you know, that
virtually every member of society regardless of
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 148
1 income, class, education, you know, had access to an
2 information environment that was pervasive with
3 messages about the dangers of smoking, so by "the
4 public" I mean just about anybody, everybody.
5
6
Q.
You're saying everyone had access or
everybody saw these messages?
7
8
9
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
Again, I, you know, can't make the claims
about what individuals saw specifically, but I --
10 you know, as an expert witness, I will testify that
11 the information environment was such that there was
12 public awareness regarding the smoke -- that smoking
13 was dangerous and could be addictive.
14
And, again, if I could just go on a little
15 bit here, that information environment includes, you
16 know, a wide range of sources, newspapers,
17 television reports, you know, public health, public
18 service announcements on TV, textbooks, educational
19 materials, information put out by various public
20 health organizations, as well as, you know, popular
21 culture; the fact that people, for example, talked
22 about coffin nails and cancer sticks and things like
23 that, so I'm drawing on a very wide range of
24 information.
25
Q.
Was television prevalent in the 1920's?
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 149
1 A. No, it wasn't.
2 Q. What about the 1930's?
3 A. No, but there were certainly --
4 Q. 1940's?
5 A. I'm sorry.
6 Q. Were you done?
7 A. I didn't mean to interrupt.
8
9
MR. KEEHFUS:
Go ahead.
I apologize.
Finish your
answer.
10 Q. If you weren't done, by all means.
11 A. No.
12 Q. If you're done, I'm going to keep going.
13 A. I guess I'm not, actually, if you could
14 give me a chance.
15 in the '20's and '30's and '40's, but there
16 were -- there were many other sources of information
17 that people got, you know, their news through.
18
Radio.
No, television was not popular
They got it through, you know,
19 newspapers and magazines.
20 and other magazines, so, yeah.
21
Q.
Okay.
They read Reader's Digest
I'm finished now.
Do you have -- do you intend to
22 offer any opinion in this case with regard to
23 the -- what the American public actually believed at
24 any point in time with regard to smoking and health?
25
A.
No.
I make a distinction between
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 150
1 awareness and belief.
2 stop there.
3
Q.
I think belief -- well, I'll
Do you intend to offer an opinion in this
4 case as to what percentage or what fraction of the
5 American public was aware of the dangers of
6 cigarettes in the 1920's, '30's or '40's?
7
8
9
A.
Will I make a judgment in terms of
percentage?
Q.
Is that your question?
Yes.
Do you intend to offer an opinion.
10 Do you intend to offer an opinion in this case as to
11 what -- as to what percentage of the American public
12 was aware of the dangers of smoking in the '20's,
13 '30's or '40's?
14
15
16
A.
No.
I won't make a characterization by
percentage.
Q.
Other than the opinions you've just
17 expressed to me, do you intend to offer any other
18 opinions in this case at trial?
19
20
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
Again, there, you know -- I plan to
21 testify as an expert witness on -- on the issue of
22 public awareness.
23 questions will be asked of me, but I will certainly
24 only be responding or, you know, answering questions
25 that have to do with the issue of public awareness
You know, I don't know what other

2
as I have assessed them as a social historian.
Q.
Do you intend to offer any opinion in this
3 case that the majority of Americans were aware of
4 the health effects of smoking in the '20's, '30's or
5 '40's?
6 A.
Again, I think I've made that clear.
I
7 think the public was aware, so I would say, yeah,
8 that the majority of the public was aware, yes.
9
10
11
Q.
majority?
A.
What do you base that opinion on that the
Where do you get the majority from?
Again, it's my -- you know, the
12 conclusions that I've drawn as a social historian,
13 given, again, the overwhelming amount of information
14 that's out there even in the '20's, '30's and '40's,
15 whether it be from -- you know, in school textbooks
16 or magazine articles and Reader's Digest.
17
I haven't come across anybody that -- or
18 any messages saying, you know, this is good for you.
19 In fact, the message is always that this is -- this
20 is bad for you and, again, I think the weight of the
21 evidence to me is clear as a social historian that
22 the public was aware of the dangers of smoking.
23
Q.
Do you recall seeing -- do you recall
24 seeing tobacco advertising from the '20's, '30's or
25 '40's with doctors in them?
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 152
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. Do you recall some of the wording that
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
would have been on those advertisements?
A.
Again, I would have to go back and check
my sources.
Q.
I don't recall specifically.
Do you recall whether those advertisements
may have said nine out of ten doctors prefer Camels?
A.
I do remember something like that, yes.
Again, I don't know specifically if that's the exact
wording but something to that effect, yes.
Q.
And those were advertisements that were
12 put out to the American public in the '20's, '30's
13 or '40's, right?
14
15
16
A.
I think they were mostly in the '40's, but
I would have to check.
Q.
Okay.
And that would have been part of
17 the body of information that was presented to the
18 public during the 1940's, those advertisements with
19 doctors in them?
20
21
22
23
24
25
A.
Yes.
That would have been part of the
information environment.
Q.
Did you include any of those
advertisements on your Resource List?
A.
Again, I'd have to go back and check.
I -- I can't remember if I have a Camel ad in there,
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 153
1 but I assume if it showed up somewhere in the Globe,
2 that it's there, but I would have to go back and
3 check.
4 Q.
So if an advertisement for cigarettes had
5 appeared in any of the newspapers that you've read,
6 if an advertisement for cigarettes appeared in any
7 one of those publications containing -- if it had a
8 doctor in it, you would have included that on your
9 Resource List?
10
MR. KEEHFUS:
11
A.
Object to the form.
Again, I -- I -- I can't say for sure.
12 know as I've already testified that I collected a
13 variety of -- of ads.
14 and look at what I have.
15
Q.
Again, I'd have to go back
When you were collecting advertisements,
16 were there specific types of ads you were looking
17 for?
18
MR. KEEHFUS:

19 A. No.
20 Q. Were there specific brands of
21 advertisements that you were looking for?

A.
I basically, you know, collected what I
2 thought was a -- you know, a good sample of the
3 kinds of ads that were out there.
4
Q.
When you were doing your research, would
5 you have gathered every ad that you came across for
6 cigarettes --

A.
Again, selected with, you know, the intent
3 of gathering like a wide range and a sample of what
4 was out there, yes.

Q.
Have you seen any medical records in this
case?
7 A. No, I have not.
8 Q. Have you seen any depositions of any

treating physicians in this case?
10 A. No.
11 Q. Have you seen any depositions of other
12
experts who've given depositions in this case?

A.
I don't believe so, but, you know, there's
10 always that possibility I run across something that
11 would be relevant.

Q.
Prior to your deposition this morning, did

4 A. I believe we met at 1 o'clock.
5 Q. All right.
6
What time was that?
How long did that meeting
last?
7 A. Roughly an hour.
8 Q. What was the discussion during that
9
10
meeting?
A.
It was basically to, you know, sort of go
11 over the -- you know, what to expect today, you
12 know, in terms of, you know, taking an oath, there
13 would be a court reporter in the room, how long
14 roughly the deposition would last, to make sure that
15 I tried not to interrupt you, which unfortunately
16 I've done a few times, to -- you know, to speak
17 clearly.
18
19
Q.
Those kinds of things.
I think we've done all right on the
interrupting today.
We've been all right there.
20 A. Okay.
21 Q. You've given two depositions prior to this
22 one, right?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. Were you curious about how this deposition

Did Mr. Keehfus or any other attorney ask
you any questions that you may be asked today at

Did they ask you any questions in
12 A. No.
13 Q. Besides going over the fundamentals of a
14 deposition, that there was going to be an oath, that
15 there was a court reporter, did you discuss anything
16 about the actual Cohen case, itself?
17
A.
I think, you know, I maybe reviewed again
18 for them what my conclusions are, what I base them
19 on.

21
That sort of thing.
Q.
Were you asked any questions about your
conclusions?

12 taken up by you expressing your opinions in this

Probably another 15 or 20 minutes.
I'm guessing.
Q.
Okay.

That leaves us about another
17 20 minutes.
18 about during that meeting?
19
20
21
Again,
I'm just curious what else was talked
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
Asked and answered.
A.
I remember them telling me to get a good
22 night sleep.
23 weather a little bit and some of the horrible
24 current events that are going on.
25 just a bunch of small talk for at least the end of
I think we probably talked about the

the meeting.
Q.
So relevant to this case, you've had a
3 meeting in September, a meeting in October and a
4 meeting yesterday, is that right?
5 A. That sounds roughly right.
6 Q. Were there any other face-to-face meetings
7 with any tobacco company attorneys relevant to this
8 case that we haven't discussed?
9
10
11
A.
Not that I recall.
To the best of my
recollection, I think we've covered it.
Q.
Would any other meetings, face-to-face
12 meetings, would they be represented in your
13 invoices?
14 A. Yes.
They should be, yeah.
15 Q. Have you expressed to me all of the
16 opinions that you intend on expressing at trial in
17 this case?
18 A.
Again, there may be -- you know, I don't
19 know exactly what I'm going to be asked at trial,
20 but I guess the best I can say now is that I
21 think -- I hope I made it clear what I will be, you
22 know, generally testifying in terms of public
23 awareness, and I don't plan on providing any expert
24 witness beyond my area of expertise.
25
Q.
So your opinions are going to be limited
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 161

to public awareness, is that right?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. Are there any opinions that you intend on
4 offering in this case that you haven't articulated
5 to me?
6
7
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
Again, that's kind of a hard question to
8 answer I guess because, you know, there are more
9 sort of specific and kind of nuance kinds of
10 questions that you could ask me about public
11 awareness, if I'm making myself clear.
12 Q.
13 opinions?
14
15
Are you talking about specific facts or
MR. KEEHFUS:
A.
Object to the form.
I think I'm clear about what my -- I think
16 I have been clear about what my opinions are, that,
17 you know, public -- the public was aware of the
18 dangers of smoking and the addictive nature of
19 cigarettes and -- during Helen Cohen's lifetime.

25
Why don't we take five
(A break was taken from
2:49 p.m. to 2:59 p.m.)
Q.
Earlier in the deposition I'd asked you if
you had made markings or notations in the
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 162
1 depositions that you reviewed.
2 that?
Do you remember
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. And you indicated that you underlined
5
certain things and you highlighted certain things?
6 A. Mh-hmm.
7 Q. That's yes?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. Okay.
Yes.
What sorts of things were you
10 underlining and highlighting?
11 for in that regard?
12
A.
What were you looking
Well, I -- anything -- any information
13 that gave me a sense of -- that would provide
14 me -- I guess the best way to put it is a more sort
15 of fine-grained picture of -- of Helen Cohen in
16 terms of, you know, where she lived, where she went
17 to school, information regarding, you know, whether
18 she watched the news or not, whether they got
19 newspapers.
20
Kind of, you know, again, address the
21 issue of public awareness in general, but
22 specifically, you know, regarding Helen Cohen and
23 the world within which she lived, it's helpful for
24 me to find -- to look for specific information
25 regarding, you know, her life, where she lived, what

11 deposition?
12 A.
Just curious.
Did you mark every
No, because there were some depositions
13 that I didn't feel really had information that was
14 relevant in terms of sort of trying to recreate
15 Helen Cohen's world vis-ŕ-vis, you know, awareness
16 of smoking and health, so I probably didn't mark

Edward Cohen.

Hannah Dahan.
We did David
Edward Cohen,
I marked a few things in
Just going through this
11 quickly, I don't -- I don't see any markings --
12 well, a couple things actually.
13 specific information about her, like her age and
14 that sort of thing.
15
I just marked some
Eva, a couple of things marked about, for
16 example, watching the news with her.
17 know I marked some things in here about the
18 conversations regarding her -- Linda Rose asking her
19 to quit smoking.
20
Linda Rose.
And Joseph Valenzuela, I don't think I
21 have anything marked in Valenzuela's as I look
22 through it very quickly.
23
I
Q.
So I have that you made notations in David
24 Cohen's, Edward Cohen's, Rachel Cohen's and Linda
25 Rose, is that right?

2
A.
I think -- did I say Eva, too?
I think I
had a few markings in Eva.
3 Q. Okay.
4 A. Yeah, I did.
5 Q. Did you use -- were the notations and
Yes.
6 markings that you made in the depositions, was there
7 a differentiation between what you would underline
8 versus what you would highlight?
9
A.
No.
It's probably if I had a pencil or a
10 pen or a highlighter at the moment I was reading
11 them.
12 Q. Whatever you had in your hand?
13 A. Yeah, exactly.
14 Q. Okay.
Did you use -- do you go back
15 through the depositions and focus in on the various
16 materials, various portions that you had highlighted
17 or marked?
18 A.
Yes, I did.
19 Q.
Did you use those highlighted and marked
20
21
portions to make your notes?
A.
I probably relied on them pretty heavily.
22 Also, I think in addition to that, I did often read
23 various sections again beyond just the highlighting
24 or the underlining.
25
Q.
Okay.
Is it fair to say that most, if not
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 166
1 all, of the information with which you marked or
2 underlined or highlighted is contained on your
3 notes?
4 A.
I don't know if all of it is.
Again, you
5 know, you read something the first time through and
6 I tend to probably over-mark or highlight the first
7 time through, so I don't know -- I doubt if it's
8 like a one-to-one correspondence I guess is what I'm
9 trying to say.
10
Q.
So you would possibly over-highlight it
11 the first time through and then go back and kind of
12 narrow it down, narrow the focus?
13
A.
Or sometimes information gets repeated
14 and, you know, I wouldn't keep repeating it in a
15 bullet point, I suppose.
16
Q.
I think you said earlier you didn't
17 actually tab or dog-ear the pages that you marked,
18 did you?
19 A. No.
20 Q. I want to take a quick look at your C.V.,
21 Exhibit 4.
22 that's your current C.V.?
The C.V. you have there, Exhibit 4,
23
(Reviewing document.)
24 A. Yes.

I see a Lecture section and then a Seminar section?
2 A.
3 Q.
Yes.
Is that current?
Are those -- those
4 aren't the current courses you're actually lecturing
5 in, are they?
6
A.
Two of them are -- or one of them I'm
7 lecturing in currently.

Q.
I got you.
This is sort of generally
Sort of my repertoire of
So depending on any given --
11 any given semester you could be lecturing on any of
12 these various subjects?
13 A.
14 Q.
15
Right.
And does the same thing go for the Seminar
section?
16 A.
17 Q.
Yes.
As I was flipping through your C.V., do
18 you include on your C.V. the research and consulting
19 work you do for the tobacco companies?
20 A. 21 Q. Which section do you include that under?
22 A. I think it's under Other Professional
23
24
25
Yes, I do.
Activities, page nine.
Q.
And how do you -- how do you describe it?
How do you describe it on your C.V.?

3
A.
I describe it as consultant/expert witness
for product liability litigation.
Q.
Okay.
So it's fair to say you don't have
4 which product you're involved in litigation with on
5 your C.V., right?
6
MR. KEEHFUS:
Object to the form.
7 A. That's true, yes.
8 Q. Is there a reason you don't put the
9
company on whose behalf you're testifying in these
10 cases?
11 C.V.?
12
A.
Is there a reason you don't put that on your
Not really.
I just thought this was,
13 you know, a good way to describe what I do.
14 had -- you know, done different kinds of expert
15 witness, you know, reports, so...

17
Q.
I've
Have you rendered any expert witness
reports in tobacco litigation or for a tobacco case?
18 A. Expert witness reports?
19 Q. Which cases have you rendered reports in?
20 A. Again, I don't know if there are issues of
21
22
Yes.
disclosure.
MR. KEEHFUS:
Again, I'll just remind
23 you to limit your answer to those cases where you
24 know you've been disclosed as an expert.
25 THE WITNESS:
Okay.

MR. KEEHFUS:
But answer the question
to the best of your ability.
3 A.
4 again.
5 did a case called Haglund in Massachusetts.
6 I mentioned before.
7 cigarettes.
8 case in New Hampshire.
9
10
Q.
I'll answer to the best of my ability
I'm a little bit absentminded sometimes.
Craft.
Donovan
MDL litigation in light
The Lawrence case.
A light cigarette
Are these all cases that you've been
disclosed as an expert in?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. So you've been disclosed as an expert in
13
the Haglund case in Massachusetts?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. And in each of these cases, the Haglund
16 case, the Craft case, the MDL case, the Donovan case
17 and the Lawrence case, in each of those cases you've
18 rendered an expert report?
19 A. Yes, I have.
20 Q. I know the MDL case must be in Federal
21
22
Court, right?
A.
You're asking the wrong person.
23 I'm a historian.
24 system very much.
25
I
Q.
Again,
I'm not plugged into the legal
How long -- how long are your reports
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 170
1 typically?
2 A.
3
4
Again, they vary.
I would say usually
around 75 to 80 pages.
Q.
Are there a lot of similarities amongst
5 the reports or is each one individualized for the
6 specific case?
7
A.
They're individualized.
Certainly, the
8 national story, you know, is the national story,
9 whether it's in Missouri or whether it's in New
10 Hampshire, but I individualize the reports depending
11 obviously on, you know, the state in which they're
12 litigated.
13 So I would do research, for example, in
14 New Hampshire newspapers and their Public Health
15 Service, et cetera, if it was a New Hampshire case,
16 so they are individualized.
17
18
19
Q.
Once you draft your expert report, who do
you provide it to?
A.
The attorneys who have contacted me to,
20 you know, conduct the research and draw my
21 conclusions.
22
23
Q.
Do you send it to them by mail or do you
send it to them by e-mail?
24 A. I think generally by e-mail.
25 Q. Have you prepared any such report in this
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 171

case?
2 A. A written expert witness report?
3 Q. Yeah.
4 A. No.
5 Q. Did you bring any of those reports with
6 you today?
7 A. I don't believe so, no.
8 Q. Each of the reports that you've drafted
9
10
11
and submitted have all contained a section relating
to the national awareness, is that right?
A.
I don't know if they're specific -- you
12 know, if it's broken out as a specific section, but
13 I often incorporate the national story and the state
14 and sometimes local story into -- you know, it's all
15 integrated into one report.
16
17
18
19
Q.
After you submit your report, have you
ever been asked to make any changes to it?
A.
that.
Only, you know, typos and things like
Missing footnotes maybe.
20 Q. Do you sign your report?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. So when you submit it electronically, it's
23 via -- it's in a PDF format or something like that?
24 It's not a word format, right?
25
A.
I'm not really sure.
I think probably

1 PDF, yeah.
2 Q.
3
Have you ever been requested to make any
changes to the substance of any of your reports?
4 A. No.
5 Q. Has any attorney ever gone over with you
6 about what's expected to be contained in an expert
7 witness report?
8 A. No.
9 Q. Has any attorney ever gone over with you
10
about the formatting of an expert witness report?
11 A. No.
12 Q. Are there any documents or any materials
13 that you brought with you today that I haven't
14 talked to you about?
15

And just flipping back to the page three,

1 Schedule A, I'm not going to go through every item
2 listed there, but have you produced and have you
3 brought with you all materials and documents that
4 would be responsive to the requests contained on
5 Schedule A?
6 A.
To the best of my knowledge, yes.
7
MR. BERG:
Pending my review of the
8 materials provided to us over the weekend contained
9 on that hard drive or flash drive, it's my
10 understanding they contain resource materials,
11 because of the date it was produced, it was not
12 enough time or sufficient time to go through
13 everything and look at it all.
14
So pending my review of the materials
15 on your Resource List, I don't think I have any
16 other questions for you at this time, but I may have
17 some more at a later point in time after reviewing
18 all of the materials that have been made available.

1 Q. My first question is, how are you?
2 A. I'm fine.
3 Q. Good afternoon.
4
Thank you.
Do you remember earlier
you were asked questions about an affidavit?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. Obviously, you're not a lawyer, right?
7 A. No.
8 Q. Do you run across affidavits every day in

I'm not a lawyer, no.
your work as a history professor teaching college
students at Clark University?
11 A. No, I don't.
12 Q. And, in fact, it sounds like you didn't
13
even know what an affidavit was?
14 A. In this particular context, no, I don't.
15 Q. But you did read the deposition of the
16
Plaintiff, David Cohen, is that right?
17 A. Yes, I did.
18 Q. Did you read all seven volumes?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. What I would like to do, Dr. Greenwood, is
21 show you -- let me just back up.
22 earlier that you don't recall having any knowledge
23 of an affidavit that David Cohen submitted in this
24 case, is that right?
25
A.
I believe you said
I don't recall that, no.

fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 175
1
Q.
So what I want to do is show you Volume 7
2 of David Cohen's deposition at page -- starting at
3 page 754, and the section I would like you to look
4 at goes through page 770.
Okay?
5 A. Okay.
6 Q. And what I would like you to do is just
7 briefly read those pages of Mr. Cohen's deposition
8 and then I would like to ask you some questions
9 about it.
I'm going to hand you the deposition now.
10 A. Starting?
11 Q. 754 at the top.
12 A. Okay.
13 Q. To 770.
14 A. Okay.
15 Q. I believe what I've handed you is just a
16
17
photocopy of your original.
A.
Right.
18
19
To where?
MR. BERG:
Did you say page 754
through 770, Jason?
20 MR. KEEHFUS:
21 (Reviewing document.)
22
23
24
25
A.
Okay.
Correct.
I think I've generally gotten the
gist of this.
Q.
Okay.
After reviewing those pages of
Mr. Cohen's deposition, does that refresh your
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 176
1 recollection regarding whether you had an
2 understanding that David Cohen had submitted an
3 affidavit in this case?
4
A.
Yes.
It seems from the questions that are
5 being asked, right, that they're taken from the
6 affidavit.
7 Q.
And you saw from your review of those
8 pages of David Cohen's deposition that he was asked
9 about specific television programs and
10 advertisements that he claims to have seen
11 throughout his life, is that right?
12
A.
Yes.
13
14
MR. BERG:
Q.
Objection to form.
Including some of the programs, TV shows
15 and other things that appear in the media that
16 counsel asked you about today, right?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. Did you review and consider David Cohen's
19 deposition in drawing your conclusions, in forming
20 your opinions that you've given today?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Anything about the pages that you've
23 reviewed again today that in any way changed or
24 modified the opinions that you've reached in the
25 Cohen case?
United Reporting, Inc
954-525-2221
fbfcf058-82fd-4846-937e-2398c7b0e93dPage 177
1 A. No.
No, they didn't.
2 Q. And even though you may not have seen the
3 actual paper copy of the affidavit, do you feel
4 comfortable that you know at least generally of the
5 substance of the affidavit by reading this
6 deposition testimony?
7
MR. BERG:
Objection.
Form.
8 A. Yes.
I -- yes, I do.
9 Q. Was Mr. Cohen actually asked about
10 specific paragraphs in his affidavit that are quoted
11 in his deposition?
12
A.
Yes.
There are a number of places where
13 they quote directly from the affidavit in the
14 deposition.
15 MR. KEEHFUS:
16 the questions that I have.
