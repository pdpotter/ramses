Continued deposition of JAMES KIRBY MARTIN, PH.D., held at the offices of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, LLP, 666
Fifth Avenue, New York, New York, pursuant to Notice and Agreement, before Thomas R. Nichols, a Registered Professional
Reporter and a Notary Public of the State of New York.
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 8:58 a.m. on June 23, 2000, and this is tape number 4 of the continuation deposition of
Mr. James Kirby Martin.
THE REPORTER: I'll remind you, Dr. Martin, you're still under oath.
THE WITNESS: Thank you.
MR. KRAUS: Michael, before we begin, we did calculate how much time we spent yesterday, and although we were here from
8:30 until 5:30, there were only five hours of deposition time. So the way we look at it there are four hours remaining today.
We would like to work through lunch so we can get it done, those four hours done in as little time as possible.
MR. STOLPER: I understand your position. I won't order lunch. J A M E S K I R B Y M A R T I N , resumed as a witness, having
been previously sworn by the Notary Public, was examined and testified as follows: EXAMINATION BY MR. STOLPER:
Q. Good morning, Professor Martin.

Q. Do you believe that smoking causes lung cancer?
A. Do I personally believe that smoking causes lung cancer? Yes, I personally believe that smoking is a cause of lunch cancer.
Q. How long have you believed that?
A. Well, I would say since about 1954. That's when my father quit smoking. Because he drew to my attention reports in
newspapers, programs on television, and that's when he quit smoking.
Q. Do you believe since 1954 that smoking causes lung cancer?
A. I believe since 1954 that smoking may well be a cause of lung cancer.
Q. When did you believe that smoking is a cause of lung cancer?
A. I think I just answered the question.
Q. You just answered --
A. 1954.
Q. So 1954 you knew that it was a cause of lung cancer.
A. Well, that's what my father told me and I didn't have any reason to disbelieve him.
Q. Do you believe that cigarettes are addictive?
A. It depends on what kind of a definition you want to use with respect to addictive.
Q. What's your understanding of what addictive means?
A. Well, my understanding in the popular parlance is that if you start it's going to be quite difficult to quit. If you start it can
well be quite difficult to quit, to stop smoking.
Q. And you believe that?
A. Do I believe that? Yes.
Q. For how long have you believed that?
A. Oh, I certainly was aware of the method my father used to quit smoking in 1954. It was a major impression of my life. I
can describe the process if you want that he went through.
And what he did, he started one day with twenty, the next day with nineteen, the next day with eighteen. He went down to one
and then he stopped. And I remember him saying two weeks later that he thought the worst of it was over.
So I got a pretty good idea. I mean, it was a fairly impressionable object lesson for a small boy.
Q. So the impression that you came away with was that it was difficult to quit stoking?

3Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. That's correct.
Q. When did you believe that that difficulty meant that smoking was addictive?
A. Well, this is a complex subject. We change our vocabulary to suit the temper at the time, and if I could give you an example.
It was smoking was a habituation in the 1960s. In the 19th century smoking was described quite often as enslaving in a culture
in which slavery existed, and to be a slave was to be in chains and not really to have any freedom. And a 17th century kind of
a term would be that it was bewitching, and if you're bewitched you really don't have control over your own life.
So we have lots of different ways of saying that it's difficult to quit.
Q. OK. But on a personal level, I am asking about you, when did you believe that the difficulty in quitting in your mind equated
to addictive?
A. Well, in my mind since the term has been around in use since the 19th century, I didn't make any particular distinction
whether it was habit-forming or whether it was addictive or whatever.
And I know that the current coinage of terminology is addictive, and if that's what we need to use, fine.
Q. When was the first time you used the term “addictive” in describing the effects of cigarette smoking?
A. The first time? I don't have the slightest idea.
Q. You have issued two reports in this case that we have marked as Exhibits 1 and 2. Everything that you considered, all the
materials that you considered in formulating your opinions in those reports are identified in those reports?
A. Well, there are a series of attachments, lists which represent documents upon which I relied in coming to my conclusion.
And that would certainly be a representation of the universe of materials that I have gone through.
I can't say literally every document that I've looked at is there, because if, for instance, we just listed all the articles that appeared
in the wake of the surgeon general's report in 1964, we could produce a 40- or 50-page list on that alone. So --
Q. Did you look at -- I'm sorry. Did you look at every document that was issued in response to the ‘64 surgeon general's report?
A. I just referred to newspaper articles that appeared in January of 1964 in response to the surgeon general's report.
Q. OK. So everything that you looked at you identified on the list that came with your report.
A. No, that's not what I said. I said that the list is a representation. There would be a high level of redundancy if we listed
literally every document that I had ever looked at, and I gave you the newspaper example, because it's the most -- for instance,
the Cleveland Plain Dealer had something between 30 and 40 articles in January of 1964 alone in response to the report from
the surgeon general. And that was characteristic. Some papers had more, some papers had less among the various papers that
I had reviewed. But we didn't list all 30 or 40 articles from any particular newspaper.
Q. Had you read all 30 or 40 --
A. Yes.

4Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. -- Cleveland Plain Dealer articles?
A. Yes. Not only I've read them, I've researched them.
Q. So your list, the list that you gave us is to tell us what you considered is really representative of the documents that you
looked at.
A. Well, I think that would be a fair characterization, yes. I can't say that literally everything is there.
Q. OK. Well, if I needed to know everything that you considered, all the 30, 40 Plains Dealer articles that you just referred to
by way of example, how would you go about identifying everything you considered?
A. How would I go about identifying everything I considered?
Q. Yes.
A. Well, we can, if you want, we can go through the report and we can go through all the documentation that I looked at.
Q. You just said that going through your report, the report doesn't list every document that you considered, the list that you
gave us.
A. Well, what I meant was there are a series --
(Due to overlapping, the reporter requested a clarification and the record was read.)
MR. KOETHE: I am not sure that was a question.
MR. STOLPER: I will restate it just to clear things up.
Q. You're telling us that the two lists, and I will represent to you that there was a third list that we received last week identified
as a second supplemental list.
A. Yes.
Q. So in total we've received three lists of materials that you considered, correct?
MR. KRAUS: Objection. What you received is a list, three lists of documents that he may refer to or rely upon in relation to
his testimony. And those words are from his expert report.
MR. STOLPER: Well, thank you for testifying. That's completely inappropriate. If he wants to clarify the difference between
consideration and reliance, that's for him, not for you to testify to.
MR. KRAUS: We provided you with the list.
MR. STOLPER: But he is testifying. This isn't your deposition. If you want to clarify it, you can clarify it in front of Golden.
This becomes an issue here.
Q. Now, professor. There are three lists that we've received, correct?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
5Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. Yes, that is correct.
Q. And you've just testified that those three lists are incomplete in terms of identifying everything you considered; is that right?
A. That is absolutely correct. I have considered thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of documents.
Q. OK. Are you aware that you're under an obligation to provide us with a list of all the materials you considered under the
Federal Rules?
A. If -- I don't know how to answer that question.
Q. Are you aware of it, yes or no?
A. I don't know how to answer the question.
MR. KOETHE: Objection, he answered the question. It calls for a legal conclusion.
Q. Are you aware of the obligation, yes or no? MR. KRAUS: Objection.
A. I am not going to answer that question.
Q. Excuse me?
A. I said I have answered the question.
Q. You answered with you don't know how to answer. That's not an answer to the question.
A. That's right, I don't know how to answer.
Q. Why do you not know how to answer?
A. Because it's a legal point that I perhaps don't understand as an individual.
Q. So the answer --
A. When --
Q. Go ahead. I don't want to cut you off.
A. When I go about the business of writing a book or writing an article or whatever it is, I will look at hundreds and thousands
of documents to try to draw what I hope are fair and appropriate conclusions from that material.
I am not going to list in any bibliography literally every document that I have ever looked at. That becomes impossible to do
an after awhile.
Q. You received materials for documents from attorneys in this case?
A. I received materials through the discovery process.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
6Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. What kind of materials have you received?
A. Various materials that came in as a result of discovery. Materials from various unions, materials from various trade
departments of the AFL-CIO, materials from the files of Dr. Selikoff. These would be some representative examples.
Q. When you said you received union materials from the attorneys, are you talking about asbestos workers unions?
A. I could try to give you some examples of materials that came forward in discovery from, let's say, the textile workers,
the ironworkers, the asbestos workers, the roofers union. I received documents from the metal trades department, from the
construction trades department.
This would be at the national AFL-CIO. So on and so forth.
Q. And it's your understanding that these were documents that were produced in this litigation?
A. Yes, during discovery.
Q. Do you have an understanding of whether or not you received all of the documents? Well, let's start with an example. You
like examples. You said the textile workers union produced documents in this case that you received?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you have an understanding of whether or not you received all of the textile worker union documents that were produced
in this case?
A. I am not sure that I can answer that question. I assume that the process would be that these materials were in some way
subpoenaed, that someone went in, and whether that would have been the textile workers or someone else or the individual in
charge of their archives, I really don't know the process.
And then that material was forwarded to me with Bates numbers on it. So Bates numbers were very consistent, one through
whatever, giving the particular -- the particular agency that the documents had come from, or organization perhaps is a better
term.
Q. Did you ask for all of the documents that were produced from each of the unions that produced documents in this case?
A. I did not -- I did do some reviewing of documents so that all of the documents would not have to be sent to Houston. Because
the volume is -- I don't know how to describe it to you. Perhaps it would fill up a good part of this room.
Q. So you say you did some reviewing.
A. Yes.
Q. What does that mean? You went to?
A. Yes, I went to Winston-Salem on two occasions and reviewed documents there. On one of those two occasions my research
assistant went with me. And we -- the documents were put out in a room somewhat like this and we spent on each of those
occasions two days going through the documents.
Q. Did you make a request for particular documents to be put in that room?

7Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. Did I make a request? Well, that was my understanding in conversation. That was what we would be doing, yes.
Q. What did you ask for?
A. I asked to have the documents out so that we could review them.
Q. Which documents?
A. Well, let's say -- in the process of discovery let's take the textile workers or the boilers makers as another example. Those
documents would come in and they would represent -- I can't count the number of pages, but great stacks on a desk two-thirds
this size. I mean, a table two-thirds this size. And we would do the best we could to go through them.
Q. Who was the “they” in that sentence?
A. I'm sorry?
Q. Who went through them? You and your research assistant?
A. I did and my research assistant, yes.
Q. How about the attorneys?
A. Well, we talked about some of the documents, yes.
Q. Were they also reviewing documents?
A. Well, I would assume so, yes.
Q. Did they do selections for you as to which documents to look at?
A. Well, we talked about specific kinds of documents. But I can't -- I don't quite know how to answer the point about selection
because when you're confronting a roomful of documents, you're willing to go through them and you're going to be looking
for material that may be relevant to the subject that I am dealing with. There would be a lot of material in these documents
that would not be relevant.
Q. You didn't look at every document. You or your research assistant didn't look at every document that was in that room,
correct?
A. It would have been Impossible.
Q. OK. So others went through that for you.
A. I wouldn't say that, no.
Q. All the documents that were in there were documents produced by unions in this case?
A. Virtually all. The one exception would be the, um, Dr. Selikoff's materials. There may have been one or two others like
that that aren't coming to mind right now.

8Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. And you say they filled up a large conference room?
A. Yes, they did.
Q. And you didn't review all the documents that were in that room, neither you nor your research assistant, correct?
A. Well, we tried to review the documents we thought would be most relevant to the subject that I was asked to investigate.
Q. How did you ascertain the relevancy of boxes of documents that you didn't review?
A. Well, that's -- well, let me -- maybe I should back up and say that by sheer volume it's been impossible for me as an individual
to review in the time that I have available all of the documents that have come in.
Q. Fair enough. I mean, I am not wishing upon you something inhumanly possible, but I am just trying to understand what
your methodology was and what your process was.
So you had a roomful documents. Clearly you couldn't go through all of them, so the answer is you didn't go through all of
them, right?
A. That's right, I did not go through all of them.
Q. Has anybody else gone through them for you other than your research assistant to tell you what's in there?
A. Well, I just -- I said I discussed with the attorneys what kinds of documents perhaps would be most relevant to the area, the
subject area that I am focusing on, and that's what we tried to do, is to get at those documents.
Q. Why don't you describe for me the type of documents that you were told would be relevant.
MR. KRAUS: Objection.
A. What do you mean by told?
Q. You just said you had discussions about what to look at and what not to look at.
A. I said a discussion is different from a telling. From a telling. I realize there is no such word. But the word “tell” implies
that I was being directed perhaps in puppet like fashion in what I was doing, and I was not be directed in puppet like fashion.
We had discussions.
Q. OK. But you just said you didn't go through all the boxes. So you made selections on which documents to go through.
How could you have selected which documents to go through if you or your research assistant didn't go through all the boxes
just to figure out what was in those boxes?
A. Well, we had to make those choices at the time. It was a sheer physical impossibility not to go -- I don't know whether
anybody has gone through all of those documents.
Q. And you made your choices based on information provided by the attorneys, right?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
9Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. No, that isn't correct. We had mutual discussions and we then would try to look at the documents that would seem to be
most relevant.
Q. So you're saying in your discussion's the lawyers told you nothing about these documents.
A. No, I didn't say that.
Q. OK. So I asked you, What did they tell you? And you took issue with the word “tell.” So you said you had discussions --
A. The context of the word “telling” as you presented it was that they were telling me what to say and they were telling me
what to do, and that was not the case.
Q. Let's put the word games aside. What were your discussions about in terms of what to look for?
A. Our discussions were about the kinds of materials that would appear. Now, I will give you an example. I'm sorry, but that's
one way to communicate information.
And that would be the 1978 major national campaign sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and Joseph Califano, secretary
Health, Education and Welfare, to send out millions of pieces of literature, thousands of press releases, and various radio and
television spots to warn individuals about problems, health problems, associated with asbestos.
So it was of interest to me in terms of whether that information was being distributed. It was of interest to me whether it
was appearing in various union files. That is, did the unions receive that information about the health dangers associated with
asbestos.
Because that would suggest that they had received this information, that the information, it's just a way to look and see whether
that information was getting out. So what I did, I would go in and I would try to -- or my research assistant would try to target
to see whether the information was there, and invariably it was.
Q. Before we go through how you went and found it, let me just try to identify the things that you're looking for. So you
mentioned the 1978 campaign. I'll refer to it as the Califano campaign. Does that main sense?
A. Fine.
Q. What else?
A. Any Selikoff materials that might be relevant. Any materials that came out of Dr. Selikoff's -- and I hope I get this, the title
of this organization correct -- the Insulation Industry Hygiene Research Program, which he began in 1968, and which engaged
in a massive campaign to distribute information to unions, to scientists, to individuals in industry, so on and so forth.
I looked for information that came out of a West Coast organization that was sponsored by Dr. Philip Polakoff. Polakoff worked
closely with Dr. Selikoff, and he began this organization, the Western Institute for I believe it's Occupational and Environmental
Studies. I am not quite sure that that's what it stands for, but I think that's correct. And anyway, the exact title is in my report.
Because Dr. Pole is very active in distributing information.
I looked for information that came from the variety of pamphlets, publications that came from the government. I looked for
materials that came from the AFL-CIO per se. The AFL-CIO obviously became very concerned about the issue of asbestos
health-related problems and became very active in distributing literature and doing everything possible to get the word out
about the dangers of asbestos.

10Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
These would be the kinds of things that I was looking for. And I guess I should add further, I was interested in information
that might be circulating through such agencies and organizations as the American Cancer Society and the American Lung
Association.
Q. Why were you doing that?
A. Because the American Cancer Society was actively involved in sponsoring some of Dr. Selikoff's research when the federal
government was not willing to sponsor it. And the American Cancer Society has been engaged in public education programs,
very, very actively so.
Well, it depends how far you want to go back. I guess you could go back into the 1920s. But in the sixties certainly and in the
1950s, sixties and seventies, the ACS had a whole series of programs that were designed to encourage people to stop smoking.
And again, I would be looking for materials that really related to that.
Furthermore, I would find indications, and I will give you two examples. The ACS started to work directly with the insulators
union. I believe the date was about 1978 in terms of specific quit smoking programs. And in addition to that --
Q. That's the insulator union that worked with Dr. Selikoff?
A. Yes, yes, I am using yesterday's vocabulary.
Q. OK.
A. And the machinists union, which is one of the largest ones out there --
Q. I don't mean to cut you off. The American Cancer Society worked with the machinists union as well?
A. I don't know whether they worked with them directly or not. But the machinists union became involved in a major campaign
to encourage workers to quit smoking.
Q. Which may or may not have been independent of the American Cancer Society.
A. I don't know whether there is a direct connection there or not. But I am sure the encouragement was probably coming
partially from the ACS.
Q. Is there anything else you were looking for categorically in the boxes?
A. Well, I'm sure that -- I'm probably leaving something out that's fairly obvious. I'm trying to do this just from straight memory,
recall.
Q. Is it fair to say --
A. Well, I'm sorry.
Q. Go ahead.
A. Let me give you one more example. The Oil Chemical and Atomic Workers Union, quite often designated OCAW, became
very heavily involved in developing information about the dangers of disease related to asbestos, and it was a point of interest
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
11Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
that the OCAW union developed a slide program in the mid-1970s, and I believe the program was something like, the title,
and I'll put this in quotes, quote, “Asbestos, a Dangerous Killer.” I don't have it quite right, but that's a .... pretty close to what
the title of this program was.
And they, the OCAW union, not only -- not only used this program and showed it among all of their locals around the country,
but, and in some instances they shared it or sold it or whatever the process was to other unions so that it could be shown as a
way to further warn individuals about the dangers of asbestos exposure.
Q. any other categories or types of documents you were looking for?
A. Well, I was very interested in the subject of the union position or the evolving union position with respect to smoking-related
issues. So I tried to look for material that would relate to that.
Q. You said “smoking-relating issues.” Would you have been looking for documents that defended or supported cigarettes or
the tobacco industry?
A. Well, some of these kinds of documents would emanate from various union-related agencies. And some statements with
respect to various positions would appear in various union publications and magazines. After all, that's a part of the process too.
What I was, if I can describe this in the sense of an overview is, I was interested in the circulation of information, what
information was getting out there.
Q. And the information --
A. That's -- that's -- I'm trying to summarize.
Q. Right. And the type of information was sort of the antismoking perspective or information that talked -- well, let me clear
up the question. The information that you're talking about is antismoking-type information?
A. Information with respect to what was being presented about asbestos-related diseases, some of which would relate in turn
to issues about synergy and lung cancer.
Q. So are there any other types of categories of documents that you were looking for when presented with this universe of
documents?
A. Well, I think I did say documents from the federal government, didn't I?
Q. I think you did.
A. OK. It would have emanated from various agencies such as OSHA, O-S-H-A, or NIOSH, N-I-O-S-H. So on and so forth.
Q. You're in a roomful of documents that you couldn't possibly get through all by yourself. How are the documents identified
or organized? Maybe the box -- you said they were in boxes?
A. Yes.
Q. How were the boxes identified or organized?
A. Well, they would be set up according to Bates numbers. One through whatever.

12Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. So they were identified or they were segregated by source from where they came?
A. Yes. Well, they had different Bates identification numbers on them.
Q. Is it your understanding that the bearing Bates numbers represented the sources from which the documents came?
A. That would be my understanding, yes.
Q. Do you know how many different ranges of Bates numbers there were?
A. So many that I couldn't possibly remember them. I never attempted to count. 50, 60.
Q. Would that mean that their about 50, 60 different sources of documents that came into that room?
A. This came into that room?
Q. Yes.
A. Not literally, because in some instances the documents would have shipped to me completely. What I mean, for instance,
in the last week and a half, I received seven large boxes of documents from the building and construction trades counsel of the
AFL-CIO. I have not looked at that material. I mean, it's an impossibility.
Q. So you received boxes in addition to what was in that room that you visited in --
A. Yes.
Q. I just wanted to finish the question for the purposes of the record.
A. Sorry.
Q. It was Womble Carlyle you said?
A. Yes.
Q. There were several sources from which those documents came that were in the room of boxes, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know how many different sources there were?
A. In that room at that particular time when those two trips --
Q. Yes.
A. There may have been five to ten, something like that.
Q. Five to ten different sources?

13Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. Yes. And I will try to try to explain this chronologically as best I can.
I made a trip in April, sometime around the middle of April. I made a trip in early May. And my guess would be that, and this
is purely a guess, that 50 to 60 percent of that material has come in since the trip I made in May. That would be my -- I am
just trying to give you a guesstimate.
Q. I appreciate that. Now, if you have boxes that came in from different unions and perhaps Selikoff's files as well in this
room, and you've identified several different types of documents you were looking for, how did you go about finding topics of
documents among those boxes that came in from different unions?
A. Well, you would just go through them as fast as you possibly could and ask for -- and this is what we did. We would ask for
copies of those documents that seemed to be relevant. All of them are not going to be directly relevant. They may deal with a
variety of issues that I was not asked to look into. So that would be basically what we would do.
Q. So just so I understand your methodology here for reviewing the documents, and I assume your methodology that you applied
in looking in that room also applied to what you did when you received boxes in Houston; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. So through discussions with the attorneys you came to some agreed upon understanding of relevance?
A. I believe that the best way for me to answer that question is that through our discussions I made several suggestions about
the kinds of documents that we might look at in trying to get at the specific issues that would seem to relate most directly to the
subjects that I was asked to look into. And that would be the best way for me I think to attempt to answer that question.
Q. Are you saying that the lawyers didn't suggest to you what may or may not be relevant?
A. Well, I think if they saw a good document, anybody with an eye for a good document, I would be interested in that.
Q. And they gave you what you considered “good documents”?
A. I would say that they showed me a few documents that I think were interesting and I think I showed them a lot of documents
that were also very interesting and important.
Q. Once you identified the types of things you were looking for, then you just took one box at a time and reviewed them as
quickly as you could?
A. That's right.
Q. And then at some point you just ran out of time. Is that what happened?
A. That's what happened.
Q. So of all the documents, all the boxes that were in that room, how many did you leave behind?
A. Well, I believe that a lot of the material that we were unable to get through has since been shipped to me. We have received
an enormous amount, as I have tried to indicate, and my research assistant is spending a lot of time on those materials as am I.
Q. Who determined which boxes should be provided to you either in the room or sent to you in Houston?

14Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. Well, I think I explained, someone, I don't know who, put the boxes physically in a room.
Q. Did you ask for them?
A. Well, I asked to see the material that had come in.
Q. All of the material?
A. Yes.
Q. There was no selection criteria about what you should see or not see?
A. Well, there would -- no.
Q. As you sit here now, you don't know whether you've reviewed, either you or your research assistant, have reviewed all of
the documents that have been produced in this case from, say, the unions?
A. I am confident that nothing has been held back from me.
Q. Well, I am not talking about what has been given to you. I am talking about what you reviewed.
A. Well, as I tried to explain, in a relatively short period of time, I have tried to go through a massive amount of material.
Q. Do you have a rough estimate how many boxes we're talking about?
A. Well, the building and construction trades, which we received last week, would extend from about the middle of that table
in linear feet to here.
Q. About 25 feet?
A. Well, 7 boxes, and the boxes are three feet. 21 feet, all right?
Q. OK.
A. So that would give you an estimate of that particular production.
Q. OK.
A. Some of the productions were maybe would be down to half a box or a quarter of a box. The Selikoff production materials
I would say would be about a half a box, which would be, what? A foot? Something like that. A foot and a half. I am just
trying to give you estimates.
Q. Oh, I know. And you mentioned before that you had a conference room some rough equivalent to this size that was filled
with boxes and you received boxes --
A. No, it was about half the size of this. I'm sorry if I indicated --
Q. I am just trying to get a sense of, did you get fifty boxes, a hundred boxes, a rough estimate of how much paper you've gotten.

15Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. Well, the method that we used, let's say from here to here we would have the boiler makers production. What we would do
is we would go through the boiler makers production as fast as we possibly could. Then we would go to the next production
and we would go through that.
And one of the problems with this material was that it wasn't always in, shall we say, a neat form of chronological order. So
you would have to turn pages fairly rapidly. But if you -- a lot of the material was not relevant to what I was being asked to
investigate. So I wouldn't spend or we wouldn't spend any time on that material.
Q. You weren't involved in the request to the unions for documents; is that right?
A. No, I was not.
Q. Do you even know as you sit here today what requests were placed on the unions to produce documents?
A. I can't tell you that. I was not involved in that process. I don't even know when that process occurred. What I can tell you is,
documents, an enormous production of documents has come in in the last roughly month and a half.
Q. So I understand, you weren't involved. So it's fair to say you don't know what selection criteria the unions used in producing
these documents.
A. That's right, I would not know. However, I would assume the selection criteria was to go through files and to present material
that related directly to the case. Having to do with asbestos-related issues.
Q. Now, the list that we talked about earlier, the three lists that we have received in this case, did you prepare knows lists?
A. I certainly worked on them, yes.
Q. Did anybody else work on them?
A. Well, I worked on them with the attorneys.
Q. Who actually wrote them up?
A. Well, I don't have a staff. So the lists were actually typed up I presume by someone at Womble Carlyle.
Q. Did you check the lists?
A. Yes.
Q. Who decided what was on the list?
A. Well, I made suggestions and I would say that all of those suggestions are reflected on that list. And we exchanged thoughts
and ideas about what should be included. We would make decisions in order to keep the list under some sort of management
control.
I go back to the 1964 example. I think if we put all the material we had on that, you would have a list more like this (indicating).
And so what we tried to do was to come up with a fair and representative sampling of materials that I thought were representative
of what I was relying on.

16Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. That answer has invoked a couple of questions from me. Let me follow up with that.
When you said “we,” these with discussions between yourself and the attorneys?
A. Yes.
Q. You said you made some suggestions as to what should be included on the list.
A. Yes. Nothing is on the list that I would -- would not have wanted on the list.
Q. OK, you just took away one of my questions. What were those suggestions that you made that should be on the list?
A. Well, I talked about various kinds of materials that I had come across and I just wanted to make sure that they appeared
on the list. If you want to go through the list, we can go through it. We can spend the rest of the time going through the list
item by item and I can talk, do the best I can.
Q. Well, perhaps if you were taking your own deposition, maybe we could do that, but I would rather do something else. I am
just trying to understand. I just found out based on your testimony this morning that the list doesn't represent everything you
considered. So I am now trying to figure out how you arrived at these lists. You've said you made some suggestions.
So rather than going through on a document-by-document basis, I would just like to understand what were your suggestions as
to how you take a large universe of documents and you distill it down to a less large volume of documents.
A. I don't think there's any reason. Let's say a government agency puts out a pamphlet and it appears in several union files. I
don't think there's any reason to repeat every file that that came from. I am just giving you this as an example. This is a process
of trying to come up with a fair representation of the materials that are available.
Q. So as a general matter you would say that the lists are representative of what you looked at.
A. I think I've said repeatedly that there's no way to prepare a comprehensive list.
Q. Of the asbestos worker union materials that you've considered in formulating your opinions in this case, which is obviously
based on your testimony, beyond what's identified here, what percentage of those materials came from the productions in this
case?
MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
A. What percentage of the production came from -- I just want to understand the question.
Q. Sure. Did all of the material that you considered relating to asbestos worker unions come from documents produced in this
litigation?
A. No.
Q. You researched materials beyond those.
A. Yes.

17Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. Would those include the materials you got from Shelly Book, um --
A. Bookspan?
Q. Bookspan.
A. Yes.
Q. Any other sources?
A. Yes, from my own research and from --
Q. OK.
A. -- which I described yesterday, in going through several union publications.
Q. OK.
A. And I indicated some of those, and I think they are listed in my report.
Q. OK. So you did your own efforts where you went to the University of Texas.
A. The New York Public Library.
Q. The New York Public Library.
A. Yes.
Q. And then you also had the contract research done.
A. Yes.
Q. And then you received documents that were produced in this case.
A. Yes.
Q. So my question is, what percentage of the materials that you considered came from the production?
A. Well, I guess I never -- it's very hard to say because of the following. You go through let's say a run of the carpenter magazine
in the 1980s, and that's in a library, and it may be a shelf ten feet long, and you have a production from the construction and
building trades counsel and that may be twenty feet long. So I can't, I mean, I have never sat down and tried to calculate that.
Q. OK, let's do it by way of time spent. You said you've spent roughly a couple of hundred hours on this matter.
A. Right.
Q. How much of that time was dedicated to reviewing the boxes that were produced in this case?
A. Right. I would say in terms of my own time, one third at most.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
18Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. And how much of your time has been dedicated to reviewing the materials provided to you by Shelly Bookspan?
A. That's very hard for me to say. If I had to divide it for you, I would say that that would be another 10 percent, one-tenth,
something like that. The rest of it pretty much involved my own research, because that is what really will confirm things for me.
Q. When you submit your monthly bills that you've testified about yesterday, do they identify the tasks or the types of things
you were doing?
A. Not literally specifically.
Q. What does it say? Give me a sample bill.
A. It says reading and research.
Q. It wouldn't specify reading and research materials received from Shelly Bookspan?
A. No.
Q. Well, you could do this chronologically, right? You know when you reviewed her materials?
A. Yes.
Q. And you know when you received, you described here this morning, when you received or reviewed the productions, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And your bills would correlate to the time spent on the types of things you were doing.
A. Well, that's actually, because this is an ongoing process, so it's very difficult for me to say that I did A, and then I did B
and then I did C.
Q. When did you come to New York and go to New York Public Library?
A. February.
Q. When did you go to the University of Texas?
A. I, as I think I tried to indicate, I made one trip in 1999, late in 1999, and I think I made three trips in February and March
of 2000.
Q. When did you go to Womble Carlyle and review boxes of documents there?
A. One trip was in the middle -- was roughly around April 15th of 2000.
Q. That was the first time?
A. First. And the second trip was sometime during the first week of May.

19Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. Do you have copies of all the bills that you submitted to Womble Carlyle?
A. Yes.
MR. STOLPER: I would like to request of counsel a copy of those bills.
MR. KRAUS: OK.
Q. Since May the time spent on this case has been in reviewing the large volume of documents that have been produced?
A. As I just explained, this is an overlapping process. Material, Shelly Bookspan has done research. Those materials have come
in at various times. Documents of which are part of the production process have come in at various times. When I have had
the time I have gone out and done research.
Q. Have you done any research in April on your own?
A. I think probably the bulk of what I was doing in April was trying to get into production related documents. Yes, I did some
research on my own. And while I can't tell you what specifically it may have been at this particular point in time, I do not keep
a daily log of my every move, I'm sorry.
Q. How do you keep track of the amount of hours you spent on the matter?
A. Well, at the end of the day I put down a number, giving the time that I spent on the matter.
Q. Yesterday's you said that you were surprised by the large number of volumes, the large number of unions that would fall
into the category of the asbestos worker unions that we defined.
Do you recall that?
A. Yes.
Q. Not every one of those unions that you were considering make up the 11 million or so asbestos workers that you identified
yesterday produced documents in this case, right?
A. I can't say for sure.
Q. Have you ever asked any of the lawyers involved whether or not you received documents from every one of the unions?
A. So far as I can tell, I have received or have had access to every document that has come out of the production process.
Q. OK, I understand that. But beyond the production process, have you ever asked whether or not the production in total
represented every union that makes up the 11 million or so asbestos workers?
A. Just to review from yesterday, the million is not my number. That's a number that was bandied about in the 1970s. I only
gave it as an estimate in terms of individuals who may have been exposed to asbestos at some point.
What I've been learning in this process is, and I think I gave you this example yesterday, I would not have thought that machinists
would have somehow been involved in coming in contact with asbestos, but then I learned that the machinists encompassed
railroad workers of various types and kind who were in contact with asbestos, just to give you that example.

20Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
So that sometimes it is very, very difficult to tell because some workers within the union group would not necessarily have
contact with asbestos and other workers would.
Q. You've opined in this case that workers exposed to asbestos were made aware of the health risks associated with synergy,
correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. And yesterday when I asked you how did you define or how did you -- yes, how did you define the universe of those workers
you said, well, a number not my number, but the number given in the late seventies was around 11 million consisting of several
different unions; is that right?
A. Right, up to 11 million --
Q. Up to a 11 million.
A. -- I think was basically the way it was stated. I think it was more in the 7 to 11 million, but I just....
Q. Several million --
A. Yes.
Q. -- workers were exposed to asbestos. And it's that universe from which you're opining, that you're opining about.
A. Yes.
Q. Now, the question is, I am just trying to understand here about this document production in this case, the documents that
were produced in this case, did you ask whether or not the documents that were produced in this case came from every one of
the unions that made up the 7 to 11 million asbestos workers?
A. I wouldn't know what all those unions would be. Because we're talking in terms of locals hundreds if not thousands in terms
of nationals and internationals in the hundreds. So I wouldn't know what they would be.
That's what I was trying to indicate to you before by using the machinists example, that I would not have thought the machinists
necessarily would have been coming in contact with asbestos. But I didn't consider that this union involves railroad workers,
many of whom because of their work around boilers, engines, that sort of thing, were in contact with asbestos.
What I can tell you also about that is in the AFL-CIO unions are organized through departments. There is a metal trades
department. There is an industrial union department. There is a building and construction trades department. And that those
departments became very, very concerned about the asbestos issue in the, um, beginning in the late sixties and moving into the
1970s, and that they were very active in trying to disseminate as much information as possible about the dangers of asbestos.
And I believe to date, if I could try to indicate to you, that we have received production materials from the metal trades
department and from the building and construction trades department. The latter being the seven boxes, the 21 feet that I
described to you.
Q. Those are examples.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
21Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. Right. And the IU, the industrial union department, I do not know whether a production has come in yet or not from them.
I do know it's been requested.
Q. So there are more unions either nationally or locally, that would make up this population, the population of asbestos workers,
that you know of as you sit here.
A. Unions are not discrete entities all over the land, the landscape. They organize in the AFL-CIO through these departments
that are the three major ones I have just indicated to you.
Those departments, for example, the metal trades department became very heavily involved. They had an occupational health
and safety committee. It becomes a full department. The AFL-CIO has an equivalent department. And they are concerned about
disseminating information to all of those unions that would fall under that group.
Q. Right, but that's just the AFL-CIO. The AFL-CIO doesn't represent all of the unions that had members exposed to asbestos,
correct?
A. I can't say for sure, but I think that is correct.
Q. So your opinion about awareness is based on the documents that you've reviewed as part of your research, correct?
A. I would hope so, yes.
Q. So that in order to establish whether someone was aware of information, you would need to see whether or not the documents
in the first instance were actually sent to those people in your?
A. Well--13
Q. Well, let me just finish the question for the transcript. -- that were actually sent to asbestos exposed workers.
A. What we are doing right now, we were talking about a corner of the whole. And when we put the whole back into place,
those documents were one representation of the universe of material that was being made available consistently to individuals
about the health consequences of smoking.
That information was coming through a whole variety of sources as I indicated in my first report. And as I stated, this was
the context for the more specific materials that were being sent out in the 19 -- beginning after Dr. Selikoff's studies in the
late sixties and early 1970s.
Q. I understand that. What we're talking about now is the scope of dissemination and your ability to identify that scope within
our targeted audience. And that was what my question was.
If you don't know as you sit here today whether or not documents, you've seen documents from every one of the unions that
make up every one of the unions -- let me do it this way. If you don't know whether or not every one of the asbestos worker
unions -- maybe the simplest way to put it is, if you haven't seen documents from every one of these unions that had asbestos
exposed workers in it, how do you know that every one exposed to asbestos actually received the materials that you've identified
in your report as representative?
A. I can't say that any one individual at any one time received any one particular document. What I can say is that there are
a whole variety of materials that were -- every effort was being made available to have those materials about asbestos related

22Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
diseases, remembering the whole universe that's out there of information about the dangers of smoking, that that information,
every effort was being made available.
I just went through the AFL-CIO, the way they organize according to departments. That those departments send information to
a whole variety of unions that would fall under that umbrella, and that that is the nature of operation, the process I just explained.
When Dr. Selikoff went to Groton, Connecticut and looked at, investigated some one thousand individuals involved with the
building of submarines, and this was a study he did in the mid-1970s, he didn't just look at and study individuals who were
literally asbestos, that is, they were putting asbestos in the submarines. He looked at carpenters. He looked at individuals who
were pipe fitters. Looked at individuals who held a whole variety of occupations that would have somehow brought them into
contact with the dust in the air.
So that it wasn't just one particular group or one particular union. In any kind of a job where asbestos may have been involved,
you could have several different unions being represented.
Q. Right, and my question to you is, you don't know whether each of those unions, whether within or without --
A. To the best of my knowledge, that information was being disseminated to members of those unions based on my studies
to date.
Q. Which unions are you referring to?
A. Do we have a list of the unions available? Shall we go on the web page and call up the AFL-CIO page?
Q. The purpose of this deposition is not to educate you about these unions. I need to know what you know.
A. Well, the purpose is not to educate you about the unions either.
Q. Professor Martin, we have to -- for purposes of this record, you can't interrupt my questions. I understand you may not like
the questions. You may not like this process, but I've got to ask a question and you've got to wait till my question is done
before you give an answer.
A. Thank you.
Q. Now, we're talking about unions. You said to the best --
MR. STOLPER: Well, let's get the answer read back. It's the last answer.
(The following portion of the record was read:
“QUESTION: Which unions are you referring to?”)
MR. STOLPER: And I'll just stick with that question.
A. All of them.
Q. All of the unions that make up the seven --
A. All of the --

23Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. We're doing it again. I'm still trying to get my question.
All of the unions that make up the seven to eleven million asbestos exposed workers. Is that what you're saying?
A. I think every effort was made to, and I believe I have explained that repeatedly in my report and repeatedly to you, that every
effort was made to distribute that material to every one who had contact with asbestos. I will give you one more example.
The United States government in 1978 sent a notification to somewhere between 30 and 40 million Social Security recipients,
individuals that the government thought may have come in contact with asbestos to try to help in the warning process. That was
a very comprehensive effort. But I don't think they were probably sending individuals who had been in contact with asbestos
a lot information they perhaps were not already aware of.
Q. But you have not as part of your research been able to confirm that every one of those unions received the information that
you're referring to; is that right?
A. You're asking the impossible.
Q. In your research were you able to quantify the volume of information that was presented to all of the asbestos exposed
workers?
MR. KOETHE: Object to the form of the question.
A. Quantify in what sense?
Q. Whatever you mean quantify to mean.
MR. KRAUS: Object to the form of the question.
A. A great deal.
Q. Can you explain that answer?
A. Yes. A great deal means a lot.
Q. OK, I understand your definition of quantity. Now answer the original question.
A. Which is?
Q. Would you like it read back?
A. Yes.
MR. STOLPER: Can yo please read it back.

exposed workers?”)

24Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. I think I have given you several different examples of the kind of information that was being made available to those workers.
It's difficult for me to put a number, say, between one and 10 or 30 percent or 50 percent or anything on that. So no, I have
not attempted to quantify it.
Q. Thank you.
A. There was a lot.
Q. OK. For the purposes of your opinion in terms of establishing whether or not someone was made aware of some piece of
information, does it matter to you whether it's a lot or a little information that's provided?
A. No, it doesn't matter to me.
Q. It doesn't matter to you whether the information that's provided is provided -- well, let me say it this way. It doesn't matter
to you how frequently the same information is provided; is that right?
A. Let's go back and I will go through this again. In my first report I talked about the context. And that is a context where
information is being repeated and repeated and repeated in our society, that smoking is not good for one's health. A specific
issue came up about asbestos related diseases and then a corner of that, when we get beyond asbestosis, mesothelioma and other
forms of cancer caused by asbestos has to do with the particular issue of smoking and synergy.
When that information became available, it became a part of the volume that was being put out there and being made available
to individuals about the possible health consequences of smoking. Every effort from what I have been able to tell by individuals
who were generally concerned about that made an effort to try to spread that information as far and wide. Ranging from an
individual like Dr. Selikoff, from union leaders like George Perkel or Anthony Mazocci to various agencies of the United States
government, including OSHA and NIOSH, to various agencies that Dr. Selikoff had founded, such as the insulation industry
program, that Dr. Polakoff had founded, such as the WIOES program, and I can go on and on and on.
Q. OK.
A. I believe -- please, let me finish. I believe that every human effort was made to try to distribute that information to affected
workers.
Q. I understand.
A. Based on my review of the record.
Q. OK. And my question -- I appreciate that answer. You've said that repeatedly. My question, maybe you didn't understand
it, was somewhat different.
For purposes of your methodology, when you, in order for you to determine whether the information that these people were
trying to get out, that all the people that you just identified by way of example, in order for you to determine whether the people
that were supposed to receive that information were actually aware of the information that was being sent to them, it doesn't
matter to you, does it, the frequency that that message or that information is being presented to them, does it?
A. Yes, it does matter to me. And what I've just indicated to you is the information is constantly circulating through the society
over and over and over again. The frequency is there. I can't put a quantitative number on it. I can't say it hit this individual five
times. It hit that individual three times. What I can say is the information is being made available.

25Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. I understand that your opinion is that the information was being made available and was being made available often,
frequently, whatever word you would like to choose. But what I am asking you is about your methodology, your ability to
conclude that people were made aware.
That is, you don't -- as a prerequisite to that, you don't need to establish that it was frequently made, that the information was
made frequently in order to conclude that someone was made aware of that information; is that correct?
MR. KOETHE: Objection. It's been asked and answered.
A. I don't know how to say the same thing yet another way. I think that that context is incredibly important. That's the reason
I keep going back and referring to it.
MR. KRAUS: Michael, we have been going for about an hour and fifteen minutes. Can we take a short five-minute break?

BY MR. STOLPER:
Q. Professor Martin, you said you've done some of your own research specifically on the asbestos workers union; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. You went and searched for materials at the New York Public Library; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. What search terms did you use?
A. Search terms?
Q. How did you -- let me back up. How did you identify materials at the New York Public Library?
A. When Katie Harrison and I went to the New York Public Library we had a limited amount of time, and we had already
identified that we wanted to look at certain newspapers, which I had not reviewed before. Among those newspapers -- or
those newspapers would include Newsday, included the Brooklyn Eagle, which actually went out of business in 1963, and also
included the Long Island Press.
In addition, we had identified, and I think I stated this yesterday, union magazines that were in unions that included The
Carpenter Magazine, included the UA Journal, included The Elevator Constructor, included The Ironworker and also included

26Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
The Asbestos Worker. That list was, we were focusing at that particular time upon the unions that were identified in terms
of the NAW case.
Q. Thank you for that answer. I have got a few follow-up questions. Let me just start with the end. You said that there were
unions identified in the NAW case?
A. Yes.
Q. Who identified them?
A. Health trust funds, the seven health trust funds that were involved in that particular case.
Q. Do you mean the plaintiffs in that case?
A. Yes.
Q. And that's what you were referring to in your last answer?
A. Yes. Now, some of this does overlap, because in some of these unions, the most obvious being the insulators union, even
though the publication is called The Asbestos Worker, those are individuals or those unions would relate to both cases.
Q. When you said you had identified certain sources, you talked about newspapers and you identified some local newspapers.
A. Yes.
Q. Was your search limited to just local newspapers?
A. No. Over the years I have been through a great number of newspapers, and papers in this area would include, for instance,
The New York Times.
Q. I'm sorry, maybe I'm working off an assumption that may be incorrect. When you came to New York to do your searches,
to do some research here, you were searching at that time for information relating to synergy; is that right?
A. I wouldn't say we were just searching for information relating to synergy. We were looking for information that would
relate to, um, the kinds of information that would be made available to the general population in this area about health hazards
associated with smoking.
And we were also looking at material that would have been made more specifically available to union members. We didn't have
a specific focus on just synergy in that research.
Q. But it was included among the things you were looking for.
A. Yes, it would be included among the things, yes.
Q. And so I had asked why local newspapers at the exclusion of national, and your answer was, well, you've looked at national
before.
A. Yes.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
27Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. OK. So because you had looked at national before, but you hadn't looked for -- you hadn't researched the topic of synergy
before coming to New York.
A. No.
Q. So why did you feel the need to research local newspapers?
A. Well, it's -- we clearly have in the United States papers which are more national in focus, I would say probably the big three
being The New York Times, the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times.
We have papers which have a regional focus, let's say like the Cincinnati Inquirer or the St. Louis Post Dispatch.
And we also have a variety of local newspapers, and one of the -- in terms of the circulation of information, it's -- I'm interested
in what get through even to the local papers. And what I have found invariably is that the local papers do give extensive coverage
to issues having to do with the health hazards associated with smoking, and they do give coverage to issues having to do with
the difficulties of stopping smoking.
Q. So you found the local newspapers to be helpful in terms of providing information about health risks associated with smoking?
A. Well, again, by example, the Long Island Press had, I'm going to give you an guesstimate, somewhere between 20 and 30
articles in January 1964 alone in some way relating to the surgeon general's report.
Q. And the question was, and you gave me an example and I appreciate that, but was it your conclusion that the local newspapers
provide you with what you consider relevant information?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you find that the local newspapers provided helpful information about synergy warnings?
A. The first article with respect to the subject of synergy that I recall seeing appeared in the New York Harold Tribune, and
this is an approximate date, since I don't have it in front of me, June of 1967.
It was an article by a reporter by the name of Alton Blakeslee, and he covered the presentation that Dr. Selikoff and Dr.
Hammond made to the American Medical Association on the subject of smoking, asbestos and synergy.
Q. I'm sorry, I missed your answer. I missed the first part. This is from the Chicago Herald Tribune?
A. No, no, the New York Herald.
Q. Oh, New York Herald Tribune.
A. Yes. A paper which I believe went out of existence in approximately -- I'm going to have to guess at this -- 1968, sometime
in the late 1960s.
Q. That would explain my ignorance.
A. It hasn't been there for over thirty years. This was an AP story and I would assume, although I haven't followed up on it, but
as an AP story it would have been printed in other papers that were AP papers or carried AP stories.

28Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. Do you know where in that paper that story appeared?
A. No, I don't recall specifically.
Q. Was it on the cover?
A. I don't recall.
Q. Do you have a copy of that article?
A. Yes, and it's mentioned in my report.
Q. In your report. Do you happen to know if it's identified in your initial report or your supplemental report?
A. Supplemental.
Q. It's in the supplemental?
A. Yes.
Q. In your research did you pull every issue of the New York Herald Tribune from a period of time and read that?
A. The New York Herald Tribune is a paper which is extremely difficult to get in whole copy. Most of what one can get out of
the Herald Tribune today comes from gaining access to their quote unquote, morgue, and all newspapers have these and they
simply clip articles and they categorize them A through Z, depending on the particular topic.
And the morgue, so-called, for the New York Herald Tribune and actually for a great portion of The New York Times, is
actually located at the Center for American History at the University of Texas in Austin. And I think that is where I obtained
a copy of that article.
Q. I am going to make my question just lightly more broad. I was trying to find out if there was a way for you to narrow
your search, so that you didn't have to look through every local newspaper in New York to research for information that was
relevant to your opinion.
A. I am not sure how to answer that question, because this has to do with the volume of information that is being made available
and it has to do with coverage of stories, and it's important for a historian to know that there was comprehensive coverage, and
that's what I am trying to -- by looking at different levels, that's what I am trying to determine.
Q. I understand. Let me clear up my question.
How did you find that article in the New York Herald contribute on that particular day?
A. I found that article as I just indicated. I believe it was from the morgue collection at the University of Texas at Austin.
Q. I understand where you got it from. But how did you find that article among the large volume of many years of many issues
of the New York Herald Tribune?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
29Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. Well, my review of the New York Herald Tribune, as I said, it's very difficult to get a microfilm copy of the paper. And so
my review of that paper, that particular paper, was a function of looking at materials in the morgue collection at the University
of Texas at Austin.
Q. I am not saying how did you physically go find it. I am asking how did you -- did it come from an index? How did you
identify that article --
A. Yes, there was --
Q. -- from another one?
A. I am sure it was under asbestos.
Q. That's the question I am trying to find out. What were your search terms? How did you go about finding asbestos related
articles?
A. I'm sorry. The search terms in the morgues of newspapers begin with A. I don't know, maybe amoeba, and end with Z, or
zebra, something in between them. And then it's broken up basically everything in between.
Q. So can you tell me what the terms were from A to Z that you used to go find information related to asbestos and synergy?
A. Yes, asbestos, smoking, tobacco, disease. Well, there are one or two others that -- cancer, the obvious. Those would be
the major ones.
Q. Synergy?
A. Didn't look under synergy. It may well not have been there.
Q. And when you say disease, was that just in general or --
A. Yes.
Q. -- is that in conjunction with another term?
A. Disease.
Q. By itself?
A. Yes. They do have categories. And they will break sometimes into subcategories, because it may be disease cancer, it may
be disease heart trouble, it may be disease whatever.
So they do have within the -- within the general group they will have, in these morgues they will have specific subgroups. And
so what we would try to do is we'd try to review through those subgroups.
Q. So, for example, then you would look at all the articles that fell under the category of “disease cancer”?
A. In sometimes yes. Because I have gone through more than one morgue, I don't know, I don't recall specifically how, I mean,
different morgues have -- for instance, I don't recall without reviewing that specific article whether the term “synergy” was
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
30Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
used. And if the term “synergy” was not used, then it would not necessarily appear under that. My recollection is that that
article was under asbestos, but ....
Q. OK. And I guess I didn't mean to go right into that example, but you gave me that example. Are these the terms that you
would have used as you went from morgue to morgue?
A. These would be the kinds of terms, yes.
Q. Did your terms change as you went from morgue to morgue or were they uniform?
A. Well, I can -- I am now thinking of more. I mean, cigarette would be a term that you would -- that we would have included.
But that is the general, that is the general group of terms.
Q. And those types of terms would have been used when you were at University of Texas searching.
A. Yes.
Q. And that was also the same terms that you would have been using when you came to New York for the New York Public
Library?
A. For the New York Public Library? The method that I used in -- because of a great deal of time constraints, and there's real
no way in a three-day period you can read every issue of every paper, especially three newspapers, I looked for specific dates
to see whether certain kinds of stories were covered.
A very specific date would be the Surgeon General's report in 1964 and then the coverage that followed that.
Q. What were some of the other specific states that you were looking for?
A. I have a -- I can say that the 1954 Hammond and Horn report. It's approximately June. 1957 Hammond and Horn report.
1962 Royal College of Physicians report on the health hazards associated with smoking. Stories that might relate to -- I am just
trying to give you examples. Joseph Califano antismoking campaign in 1977. These would be the kinds.
Q. You mentioned when you came to New York -- what's the name of your research assistant?
A. Katie Harrison.
Q. You mentioned when you came to New York that you had to split up time with Katie Harrison.
A. Yes.
Q. She went to once source and you went to another.
A. Yes, that's correct.
Q. You went to the New York Public Library?
A. Yes.
Q. Where did she go?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
31Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. She went to what is called the Annex. This isn't quite common in large research libraries any more, because the huge volume
of material they simply can't keep in the main location.
So they actually afforded us a great privilege, because we were unaware of this coming in, and they allowed Katie to have
access to the materials in the Annex. Because if we'd had to have them all delivered over to the main library, they would have
been arriving about the time we were scheduled to leave.
Q. What guidance or direction did you give Katie to look at the documents in the Annex?
A. In the -- with respect to the union magazines, the five that I mentioned? To go through as many copies as you possibly
could and look for articles that related to issues having to do with smoking, health, and anything along that particular -- along
that particular line.
Q. Were there indices to these journals, do you know?
A. By and large not. I can't recall that I have ever specifically seen an index to any of these journals.
Q. So the way to understand the information that's the unions were presenting would require you to have to look through each
of these journals?
A. Yes.
Q. Who decided which journals that she should be looking at at the Annex?
A. Well, I decided that, because that -- given that we had three days, basically 16, 17 work hours apiece, not a lot of time to try
to cover a lot of material, I wanted to specifically limit this to, this search to knows journals that I had previously mentioned
that relate to unions and trust funds that are involved in the NAW case.
Q. So it was just the seven funds or unions?
A. Yes, but they -- there are five publications as I recall that would represent those seven funds.
Q. Do you have a sense of the volume of -- how many members made up the seven funds to which you were just referring?
A. Well, that's very difficult, because some of the funds are local, and I don't know how many members would be in that
particular local union.
And others are, I believe the asbestos worker fund is a national fund. So that I can give a fairly precise number -- 17, 18,000.
With the locals it's so hard to say, because the local could have ten members and it could have 10,000. So I just don't really
know exactly.
Q. But the seven funds are national funds?
A. No.
Q. They're mixed of national and local.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
32Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. That's my understanding.
Q. So you're not sure in total how many members make up the seven funds?
A. The seven funds, no, I am not.
Q. Other than the journals that you were able to get, of those seven funds, how many -- well, you said there were five journals?
A. Yes.
Q. How many of those journals was Katie -- her last name again?
A. Harrison.
Q. Harrison. How many of those journals did she make it through?
A. Well, it's very difficult for me to answer that question, because this was one of -- it's a matter of piecing it together. For
instance, the carpenter union magazine was available in total at the University of Texas at Arlington for the decade of the 1980s.
So that in that particular -- in that particular case, she would have been looking primarily at the 1960s and the 1970s, because
I think at that point we had already obtained material from the 1980s.
Q. From which unions? I'm sorry.
A. I said from -- I am talking about the carpenter union.
Q. That's what I thought you said.
A. The ironworker magazine, we already had a pretty extensive run on that based on research for another case that I was involved
in, the Ohio ironworkers case last year.
Q. That case did not involve asbestos.
A. No.
Q. Or the risks associated with the synergistic relationship between asbestos and cigarettes, right?
A. That is correct.
Q. OK.
A. So that in each instance we didn't have very much from The Elevator Constructor. We were able to find some copies.
Sometimes these collections are not complete.
What one does to initiate a search like this facilitated greatly by the worldwide web today. Basically you can do a web search
through, um, I can do this through my own library at the University of Houston and I will search like an -- and I am not sure what
the letters stand for -- OCLC search, which would allow me, um, will tell me where the best collections of these materials are.
And so what I did was, I picked New York because it seemed like of the materials that we needed to go through, most of them
we were going to find, find the most of them at the New York Public Library.

33Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. They say everything is in New York, so coming from a local.
There were other journals other than the seven -- other than the five that you had identified from the national asbestos workers
union located at the Annex; is that right?
A. There may well have been, but we focussed on those five.
Q. OK, I just wanted to make sure. I am just trying to understand what's there. I have never been to the Annex. So -- will never
even try to assess what's there, so....
A. Yes, the answer is yes.
Q. In terms of the direction that you gave Katie Harrison for finding responsive or relevant materials in these journals, is it fair
to characterize it that she was looking for information that contained warnings about the health risks associated with smoking?
A. Yes.
Q. And was she looking for anything relating to health risks associated with asbestos exposure?
A. Yes.
Q. As a historian -- well, let me back up. Let's take the Revolutionary War as an example. You've published on that subject and
you've obviously researched different aspects of the Revolutionary period here in the States, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And you're aware that there are historical debates about the Revolutionary War period here, as a general proposition.
A. Yes.
Q. And there are facts from which different historians can reach different conclusions about what happened during the
Revolutionary War period; is that right?
A. I suppose, yes.
Q. And as a researcher and a historian, it's important for you to investigate different view points and different facts from a
particular period of time; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you find yourself as a historian interpreting different conflicting facts at any given period of time?
A. Historians vary from A to Z. Some spend a lot of time in the archives. Others don't. I happen to be of the former type, and
that is that I believe in doing an abundance of research before trying to draw a conclusion.
And as I was trained in graduate school, one has to go with the preponderance of the evidence in formulating a conclusion.

34Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. But in reaching, even determining what the preponderance of the evidence is, you need to assess conflicting views or
conflicting pieces of evidence; is that right?
A. Well, yes, one would have to do that, yes.
Q. You find yourself reaching conclusions based on conflicting pieces of information, correct?
A. No, I just said that I find myself reaching conclusions based on the preponderance of evidence. Part of the process of doing
research is to take into consideration conflicting documents.
MR. STOLPER: Can I have that last answer read back?
(A portion of the record was read.)
Q. In your report you opine on public awareness of the health risks associated with smoking dating back to the 1600s.
A. Yes.
Q. And you even reference King James?
A. Yes.
Q. You're aware that dating back to that time that there was conflicting information about the health risks associated with
smoking; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. And you're aware that -- well, your opinion is that messages about the health risks of smoking were sent to the public at
large dating back to the 1600s; is that right?
A. Yes, there's quite an extensive literature of debate about the use of tobacco products in the 16th -- I'm sorry, in the 17th
and into the 18th centuries.
Q. So is it fair to say that people were also aware of that debate --
A. Very much so.
Q. -- during the -- I'm sorry. Let me clarify. -- during the --
A. During those two centuries?
Q. Yes.
A. Yes.
Q. And from your perspective being aware of the debate is sufficient enough to conclude that they were aware of the health
risks that were being debated at the time; is that right?
A. Well, perhaps I should indicate what the debate was about. And --
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
35Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. At any particular period of time?
A. No, I am talking about the 17th and 18th centuries. The predominant form of medicine being practiced at the time came why
an ancient by the name of Galen, G-a-l-e-n, and it involved the balancing of bodily humors, and the way, the most standard
way for a medical person to balance those humors was to bleed an individual, the so-called art of phlebotomy.
And at the time in the 17th and the 18th centuries, proponents of tobacco said that it had certain valuable properties: It's
characteristics was it would make you hotter and drier, and so a doctor might recommend tobacco use to you if you had too
much phlegm, one of those bodily humors, which meant you were too cold and too wet. This is not an understanding we have
today about medicine but -- so a doctor might recommend.
Other individuals came along and said this is absolute nonsense, that we can see various kinds of adverse health effects regardless
of what the formula might be in the context of Galenic medicine. And so a lot of the debate would focus on that particular issue
-- individuals who were great snuffers, and they might develop mouth cancers, and that would be brought out in the literature,
and maybe this use wasn't what it was cracked up to be, so on and so forth.
Q. Is it fair to say based on that that the harm associated with smoking has changed since the 16th century till today or 17th
century till today?
A. Well, there are different types of smoking going on at different times. So you -- you have general categories. But the kind of
understanding of medicine that we have today wasn't there in the 17th and certainly into the 18th century. The modern diseases
of medicine are very much a product of the post-Civil War era.
Q. And you mentioned the 17th and the 18th centuries.
A. Yes.
Q. That there was this debate.
A. Yes.
Q. Would you agree that the same debate took place in the 19th and 20th centuries?
A. In the 19th century what starts to happen is that the bulk of the material that is being presented is warning about the health
dangers associated with use of tobacco. The modern cigarette is still somewhat out in the future in terms of the 1880s, 1890s.
So you do have a debate, but it's more or less a one-sided debate, because you have groups which are now coming to the fore,
such as the American Antitobacco Society in the 1840s and the 1850s, which is a parallel organization to the temperance and
prohibition movements of the same decades.
And a lot of it, a lot of this, what is being presented is that the problem with tobacco is that it dries you out and therefore just
drinking water is not going to satisfy your thirst, and ultimately you must, to quench the thirst, to tobacco producers, you must
in turn, to quench that thirst, you would go to the use of distilled spirits, for instance, the hardest forms of alcohol.
And so you have reformers were saying if we're going to deal with drinking related problems, we have to deal with tobacco
related problems, and the two are tied together. There is no consequential pro tobacco movement in the 19th century. This
movement would broaden or become, um, these issues would be taken up by the W.C.T.U., the Women's Christian Temperance
Union, by the national and international anticigarette leagues, and various other groups.

36Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
And you have quite a production of pamphlet literature on that particular subject, and these pamphlets were circulated far and
wide, and you had speakers going out speaking about the dangers of tobacco across the United States, which was a major form
of communication, that is, going out and speaking about issues at local meetings in an era in which they don't have the kind
of communications networks we have today.
Q. That's all information I didn't know before and I thank you for that. I understand that now, that the specifics of the debate
have changed over time as information and understanding of science has changed over time?
A. Yes, our -- I'm sorry.
Q. I guess my question is slightly broader. And that is, do you agree that there's been a debate, a public debate, about the health
effects of smoking since the 17th century until today?
A. I would have to qualify my response and say, I think that debate pretty much came to any kind of a consequential end by
1964 in the surgeon general's report.
Q. So it's your opinion that the public debate about -- oh, OK. So let me just understand. So you would agree with me that there
was a public debate about the health effects of smoking since the 17th century through 1964.
A. Well, I would say -- I would call it a scientific medical debate as part of it. I mean, that information being made available
to the public in a variety of ways.
Q. Well, your opinion's about public awareness. So I would rather for purposes of clarity just focus on public debate. So when
I say public, I am not referring to the exclusive nature of the scientific literature and what's debated among scientists, but really
what the public knew, from King James through today.
A. Fine.
Q. So would you agree that there was a public debate about the health effects of smoking since the early 17th century, the time
of King James, through 1964?
A. Predicated on that there has to be a source for that debate. That is, different kinds of information being made available. The
debate per se will fundamentally in the public arena be drawn to a conclusion by the summary of all the literature that is out
there, and that will be drawn together in the surgeon general's report, which is reported to the public.
Q. In 1964?
A. 1964.
Q. The first part of your answer you meant their needed to be a conflicting -- you needed two sides to the issue in order to
have a debate. Is that --
A. Yes.
Q. -- what you meant by the words you were using?
A. Well, in the scientific community, and this will spill over into the public press, there's a debate about the sources of cancer
that does go on in the 1950s, and you have some scientists who argue that cancer is fundamentally a problem of the environment

37Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
and chemicals and pollutants in the environment versus individuals such as where we've talked about before -- Graham and
Wynder, Hammond and Horn and their epidemiological studies, in which they say the pollutants, in specific we're talking about
here, are tobacco, smoke, tar, sodium, and so forth, as a source of lung cancer and heart disease.
Q. So is it your opinion that after 1964 the public was not subjected to conflicting messages about whether or not smoking
was harmful?
A. Well, I am sure there were different messages, but after 1964 the bulk of those messages that were coming out and that were
being featured were messages to the effect that smoking was most likely harmful to one's health.
Q. When you say the debate ended, is that because that there was no longer a conflicting view, that it was really just the
antismoking view that was prevalent?
A. The antismoking view in the sense of the dangers of tobacco use, yes, that is -- that debate I think basically is over.
Now, I'm not saying there aren't different positions, but in terms of the predominance of the evidence and the predominance of
the actions after 1964, all of that would suggest that the debate was fundamentally over.
Q. Whose actions were you just referencing?
A. Well, as an example, the federal government putting the Cigarette Warning Label Act in 1965 leading to warning labels
beginning in 1966, the setting up of the, um -- I am trying to think of the exact title. The National Clearing House on Smoking
and Health.
These were the kinds of -- so called remedial actions that were called for in the ‘64 surgeon general's report, putting limitations
on cigarette advertising that would come into place by 1971.
And these kinds of actions would suggest to me that there really wasn't that much of a debate left in terms of what the public
is -- the information the public is receiving.

Q. Professor, we have put in front of you what has been marked as Exhibit Number 5. It's a Time Magazine article dated April
18, 1988. The cover of Time Magazine reads “Butt Out,” B-u-t-t out, “The War Over Smoking.” It's got a picture of a man and
a woman, one with a cigarette, the man holding a cigarette, the woman with a face mask.

Do you recognize this magazine?
A. Yes.
Q. Have you seen it before?
A. Time? Yes.
Q. Have you seen this issue?
A. I believe so.
Q. Do you recall when you saw it?
A. Not specifically.
Q. In the last few months? Years ago?
A. Sometime within the last years, five or six years. I maybe even read it back in 1988.
Q. Time is a national magazine?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you consider the information contained in time to be influential on the public awareness about the health effects of
smoking?
A. Not necessarily.
Q. You don't think it is?
A. I said not necessarily.
Q. Well, what makes it?
A. Well, by 1988 if we go back to our pool of polling information, all of the polls were coming out with very high levels of
not only awareness, but belief that smoking was harmful.
So I doubt whether this article had any impact at all on that national body of -- that national body of poling data and the
information contained therein.
Q. So your understanding of public awareness, the health risks associated with smoking, is dependent upon poll data?
A. No.
Q. Well, you just referenced pole data.
A. Well, I can -- I can give you lots of references to lots and lots of other information. For instance, if we look at school curricula
in the 1980s, at the time that this material is being presented, the schools throughout the United States are not demonstrating that

39Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
the students are learning about the debate about tobacco. They haven't demonstrated that for a hundred years. There materials
that are being presented to students at various and all grade levels indicate that smoking is not good for one's health. So that
would be one source of information.
In April and May of 1998 there were various newspaper stories and headlines about C. Everett Koop and the 1988 surgeon
general's report having to do with the issue of nicotine addiction. My guess is that this article, which I don't recall, although I
see Koop's name appearing at the bottom of the first page, would reflect that that particular issue that is going on. And while
there is maybe a debate about the meaning of addiction, that doesn't mean that there wasn't both a general awareness and belief
by the late 1980s, which was extremely high, 90 percent or more of the smoking was harmful to one's health throughout the
general population.
(Discussion off the record.)
Q. Professor, the Time Magazine is dated April 18, 1988.
A. Yes.
Q. The Time cover reads “The War Over Smoking,” with the depiction of a man snarling with a cigarette in his hand and a
woman with a mask on her face.
A. Yes.
Q. What is the message that's being portrayed by this magazine cover?
A. Well, the message that I would get out of this is, the person on the left is a smoker and is upset about all the restrictions that
are being placed by national, state and local agencies on their smoking. The person on the right is probably a person who is
concerned about, because of the mask on the face, would be concerned about the alleged dangers of secondhand smoke.
And so that this would represent to me, it's part of a debate that is going on about smokers' versus nonsmokers' rights, which
I think is somewhat different from what we were discussing before.
Q. In terms of the public debate over the health effects of smoking, you're aware that tobacco companies publicly refuted the
findings of the 1964 surgeon general's report, right?
A. I don't know whether I would say, use the word “refuted.” I guess I would need to see that in writing.
Q. What is your understanding of the tobacco's industry position in response to the 1964 surgeon general's report?
A. Without the statements in front of me, my general recollection is that comments were made to the effect this is nothing more
than a summary of information previously known to we need further research. And that's just to give you a brief answer.
Q. So in taking a position that further research is needed, the tobacco industry is refuting the allegations or refuting the
information in the ‘64 surgeon general's report that, as you've characterized it, the debate is over about whether or not smoking
is harmful; is that right?
MR. KRAUS: Objection to the form of the question.
A. The word, the operative word here is “refuting,” and I am not sure that that is a word that is appropriate.

40Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. What word are you comfortable with to describe it?
A. Well, I am not sure I can put it in one word. I just said that the kinds of public comments that were made was, would vary
from we need more information to there's nothing new here. That sort of thing. And again, with the qualifier that I don't have
the materials in front of me.
Q. The tobacco industry disagreed with the conclusions reached in the 1964 surgeon general's report?
A. I don't really know how to answer that question because I haven't read materials beyond the kind of public comments that
were made that would perhaps reflect the views of the tobacco industry.
Q. You're saying you did see the public views of the tobacco industry.
A. Yes, there were -- I believe there -- yes, there were public comments. There were television programs, standard journal --
and there were obviously lots of news articles in the standard journalistic practice to present both sides of the issue allegedly.
At least journalists like to think they're doing that.
And if we would just go by count, if a newspaper had 30 articles about what the surgeon general's report was all about and
what the warnings were all about, and what we're stating, they might at most have one or two articles allowing some sort of
industry comment.
So the vast weight of the information that was being made available was not in favor of, the matter of -- let's say tobacco was
not -- was not healthful. The vast preponderance of the message, and certainly the message that was getting through, was that
smoking, hardly a new finding in 1964, the use of tobacco products wasn't good for your health.
Q. So while I understand your view of the weight of information at the time, but you would acknowledge that there was a
debate, and on one side of the debate was the tobacco industry and on the other side were folks like the surgeon general's report,
the surgeon general and other antismoking advocates that took the position that smoking was harmful.
A. Well, as I have tried to indicate, I feel that as of the surgeon general's report in 1964 the debate is fundamentally over.
Q. The public debate was you said.
A. The debate. And that is, that there are positions that are being presented, but I don't think there is any debate.
Q. Well, the tobacco industry certainly debated those positions, right?
A. The tobacco industry questioned those positions. But that doesn't mean that anyone responded to them or that anyone believed
them.
Q. You don't know one way or the other whether anyone believed the tobacco industry and the statements they publicly made,
do you?
A. Based on, go back to information with people being polled, questions about, do you think smoking is harmful? Do you think
it's a great risk? All of those polls that are out there of various types and kinds, always posed the different questions, I think
what you conclude is the vast bulk, up to 90 percent or more of the population, was not accepting an argument that smoking
had healthful qualities. And I don't know who was presenting that argument.
Q. So your basis for whether or not the information was believed is coming from polling data?

41Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. No. Again, when you -- I talk about all of the public education, private education going on with schoolchildren in the studies
of what they were learning. That is not a debate. That is an open-and-closed issue. It's all smoking is not good for you. You
shouldn't start and you should stop if you have started.
You have various state and federal agencies. If we just take as an example, what I'm referring to here, the National Counsel on
Smoking and Health encouraged the formation of regional and local counsels. Those regional and local counsels were constantly
mounting programs to further warn people about the dangers of smoking.
Daniel Horn himself, who was very prominent in the field and was the director of the National Clearing House for Smoking and
Health, which grew out of the surgeon general's report, at a conference in Syracuse, New York in, I believe it was 1968, said, and
this is a public statement recorded in the local newspaper, you could, and I'm paraphrasing, you could shout information from
the highest rooftops that smoking was not good for you. It wasn't healthful. And you wouldn't be telling people anything that
they didn't already know. That was in 1968. Those words tend to suggest to me that there's not much of a debate that's going on.
Q. But that answer that you gave with all those different examples talks about the effort to educate individuals.
But my question to you prior to that was, in order for you, Professor Martin, to today tell us what people believed as distinct
from aware, as we talked about yesterday, what people believed, the way you can reach a conclusion about what people believed
historically is based on the poll data.
A. No, it's not. There are a whole complex of factors that will come into concluding that people believed something. The poll
data allows you to measure and perhaps quantify that.
But what I am trying to suggest is, with so much information circulating through society coming from so many sources, when
people are literally being bombarded day after day after day, down to the very present, I would say in the very last month alone
in my newspaper, the Houston Chronicle, we have had two or three stories about tobacco-elated issues. And there was certainly
nothing in those stories saying that there's any debate about the health consequences of tobacco.
I am saying that the sum total of all of that information that is being made available, that would lead to the formulation of the
belief, one measure of which would be polling data.
Q. Is there any other way to measure whether population actually believes something other than to assume, well, the information
was presented. They must have got it. And they must not only have gotten it, but they must have believed it?
A. Well, the sheer weight of material. I mean --
Q. So it's an assumption based on the weight of the material?
A. No, it's an assumption based on -- surely if people would have to go outside and smoke in the street as they do today in New
York City and across the United States, they must have some understanding why they're going outside.
My guess is that if we went downstairs and did an interview, we would find most of them would say it's because people thing
smoking isn't healthful, right? To believe that. They may well believe that themselves.
What I am saying is there's just a whole variety of things that the sum total of which can result in a conclusion that this knowledge
is common, widespread and accepted.

42Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. None of the polls that you've looked at indicate that one hundred percent of those polled believed that smoking was harmful;
isn't that right?
A. The polls that I had looked at certainly by the 1970s are indicating, and these include by the way governments conducted
by the -- I'm sorry, I didn't state that correctly -- polls conducted by agencies of the federal government concluded that the
number was running over 90 percent.
I can only go back to George Gallup, who said in the 1950s that when you're hitting numbers as high as the kinds of numbers
that he was seeing in regard to awareness issues with respect to smoking, that these are very high numbers.
Q. We're talking about believability. I don't want to cause any confusion here.
A. OK, I'm sorry.
Q. I understand your position about awareness, but now I am taking about believability.
A. Yes.
Q. And I'm just trying to figure out how you could figure out what people believe. I asked you about polling data.
Can you identify any one poll that showed that greater than 90 percent of those polled stated that they believed --
A. Yes.
Q. -- that smoking was harmful?
A. I'm sorry. Yes.
Q. Which poll?
A. Let's look on our list for polls in 1970 as 1975 conducted by HEW. Let's look on our list for polls conducted by Gallup, the
Gallup organization during the 1980s. Let's look on our list for polls conducted by the Roper organization in the 1980s and into
the 1990s. I mean, I am just trying to give you some examples off the top of my head.
Q. Fair enough. One follow-up question. You mentioned polls by HEW. What is HEW?
A. In the seventies it was Health and --
THE WITNESS: What is it? Help me out? Human Welfare?
MR. KRAUS: Health, Education and Welfare.
A. I'm sorry, Health, Education and Welfare. It is today Health and Human Services.
MR. KRAUS: Don't criticize me for testifying. I just trying to be helpful.
MR. STOLPER: Thank you for saving the time.
Q. Do you rely on poles that are done by HEW?

43Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. Yes.
Q. Do you find them to be sound?
A. I found them to be consistent with other polls.
Q. Have you ever found them to be inconsistent?
A. In terms of if they structure questions about belief correctly, such as do you think smoking is harmful? and 90-95 percent
would answer yes, I would say that that concept is both common, it's common, it's widespread, and it would suggest very high
levels of belief.
MR. STOLPER: Mark this as 6.
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 6, letter dated 1/11/90, marked for identification, as of this date.)
Q. We have handed you Exhibit Number 6, professor, which is dated January 11, 1990. It's a letter from RJR to a principal
of a school in Amherst, New York.
Have you had a chance to review it? Just let me know.
A. OK.
Q. Have you seen this document before?
A. I don't recall it specifically.
Q. Do you recognize that RJR is a tobacco company?
A. Yes.
Q. You specifically did not request or review tobacco company documents; is that right? As parts of your research.
A. The vast bulk of tobacco company documents were never in the public arena. So when you're dealing with public awareness,
it would be fundamentally a contradiction in terms.
Q. But there are tobacco company documents that did make its way into the public arena.
A. This one did.
Q. And there are others, aren't there?
A. There may well be.
Q. But you didn't look to any of those.
A. I didn't specifically look to any of those.

44Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. But you specifically didn't look for any of the tobacco company documents. Even those that went into the public arena,
isn't that right?
A. I don't want to say yes or no to that, because I have seen similar documents. I just don't recall what they are.
Q. Did you ask the tobacco companies for any documents, any of their documents?
A. Well, the question here has to do with private documents and public documents, and I presume this was part of some
disclosure somewhere at some time. Beyond that I can't comment.
Q. You're referring to this document?
A. Yes.
Q. But before I got into the specifics of this document, I just wanted to clarify your methodology, and that is, you didn't ask
the tobacco companies for any of the documents, any of their own documents, that either were distributed to the public or --
well, just leave at it that. Were distributed to the public. Isn't that right?
MR. KOETHE: Object to the form of the question.
A. Did I specifically ask? A lot of these documents I didn't specifically ask for.
Q. Did you ask any of the tobacco companies for any of their own documents?
A. My working assumption is the vast bulk of company documents were not in the public arena. Therefore, they could not have
much influence on public awareness related issues. That was my working assumption.
Q. I understand the reasoning, your assumption, but the question I asked you was a yes or no. Did you or did you not ask
them for it?
A. I did not specifically call tobacco companies and ask for documents.
Q. Turning your attention to the exhibit we put in front of you, do you see that it's a letter written from R.J. Reynolds to a
principal of a school in New York?
A. I see it's a letter written by Joe F. Spok, I believe it is, manager of the Public Information, Public Relations Department, to
a principal in a high school in New York.
Q. The author of this document appears to be an employee of R.J. Reynolds?
A. Yes.
Q. The letter suggests that the principal has fifth grade students?
A. What the letter actually says, “A number of your fifth grade students have written R.J. Reynolds commenting that they do
not feel our company should allow the use of our brand names on children's toys and candy cigarettes.”
So that would suggest to me that a fifth grade teacher as part of educating students about the health dangers associated with
tobacco asked students to prepare letters to send to R.J. Reynolds, and that's what produced this letter as a response.

45Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. Can I draw your attention to the first sentence of the third paragraph, just after where you read, where it says, “Some of the
students also commented about the controversies surrounding cigarette smoking.” Do you see where it says that?
A. Yes.
Q. So doesn't this suggest to you that as of 1990 fifth grade students were perceiving that there was controversy --
A. In one classroom --
Q. -- around cigarettes?
A. -- in New York, yes, it suggests that to me.
Q. If I could draw your attention to the last paragraph of this -- no, no, I'm sorry, last paragraph on the first page where it reads,
“Despite all the research going oh, the simple and unfortunate fact is that scientists do not know the cause or causes of the
chronic diseases reported to be associated with smoking.”
Do you see that?
A. Yes.
Q. And that's RJR's position to the school principal?
A. Yes.
Q. And this is what RJR appears to be telling the school principal to tell the fifth grade students?
MR. KOETHE: Object to the form of the question.
Q. You can answer.
A. This is written to the principal. I would be very surprised if the principal given that notion of attitudes about smoking in
1990 shared this letter with everyone. With anyone. Excuse me. I meant anyone, not everyone.
And what I can tell you in turn is that public education programs, private education programs, for over a hundred years have
emphasized the dangers of tobacco use, and I would presume that this was a response to a write-in campaign to the company
and that's what this letter was about and that it had no influence whatsoever.
MR. STOLPER: Can i just have the last two sentences read back.
(A portion of the record was read.)
Q. What's your basis for opining that RJR's message to a principal in Amherst, New York in 1990 had no influence?
A. Because the emphasis in the school curriculum was one directional, and that would have been that smoking was hazardous
to your health and that this teacher was not encouraging smoke. She was encouraging the students not to smoke and she was
encouraging them to write to the company about why were they producing this kind of a product. That would be what my
conclusion would be.

46Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
This was part of an antismoking education class exercise, and this was a response to that. As I'm reading the letter.
Q. In the last paragraph of the letter do you see where RJR is asking that they would appreciate the principal passing the
information along to the students? Do you see where it says that?
MR. KRAUS: Objection to the form of the question.
A. Yes.
Q. Do you have any way of determining whether RJR conducted a letter writing campaign to school officials throughout the
company?
A. No. Not that I'm aware of.
Q. But you would agree in 1990 RJR is at least -- you say they're having no effect. But you'll at least acknowledge that RJR
is actively debating whether or not smoking is harmful; is that right?
MR. KRAUS: Objection to the form of the question.
A. Based on my reading of the letter, this is a response to students sending them letters saying we see problems with your
product. And this is a response to that.
Q. Isn't that response conflicting with the conclusions of the 1964 surgeon general's report?
A. In terms of every known measurement, in terms of every known curriculum material that was being made available not only
perhaps to these students, but students throughout the United States, this letter would have had no effect.
Why? Because even in the 1960s and 1970s, there was again a whole variety of surveys in which students are being asked
questions about the dangers of tobacco. Have you heard about them? Are you aware of them? That sort of thing. And you
always had very, very high levels of awareness with respect to that matter, if not in time you will have not only awareness, but
belief. So in the broader context, this is one letter.
Q. Let's just focus on different types of information or categories of information that you considered. I believe you identified
educations ago one of the areas. And you cited the textbooks and polling data to reflect the message that was being sent to kids
and polling data to reflect what they were aware of. Is that correct as to what you did?
A. Curriculum materials, as I said before, have been around for well over a hundred years. Textbooks have been around for
well over a hundred years. And the message is constant, and that message is -- it may be stated in different ways because of the
words we choose to emphasize at particular points in time, and that is that smoking is harmful to your health.
Q. In analyzing the textbooks and the educational materials, you didn't obtain textbooks, for example, from all over the country;
isn't that right?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. How many states did you receive textbooks from?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
47Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. I have reviewed lists of textbooks, as comprehensive a collection as there is in the United States. I obtained those materials
from a gentleman by the name of Richard Means. And he is a retired professor of health education at Auburn University.
Q. The list of text books don't tell you what's in there with regard to smoke and health, isn't that right?
A. I have never reviewed a health textbook that I can recall that said smoking is good for you.
Q. But you don't know affirmatively whether it said anything about smoking in any of the textbooks that are identified on that list.
A. Invariably these textbooks, health related textbooks would have a section quite often paired together on alcohol and tobacco.
And yes, these textbooks did make comments going back to examples that I have in my initial report back to the mid-1880s,
and invariably they did discuss the issue. In any health related textbook there would be some sort of a comment about the
dangers of using tobacco.
Q. That's an assumption you made having looked at the list.
A. What list?
Q. The list of textbooks that you said.
A. I have not only looked at the list, but I have looked at hundreds of textbooks.
Q. Have you identified the hundreds of textbooks that you looked at?
A. You'll find several textbooks on the list as a representative sample. Again, they're very redundant. Anyone who writes
textbook knows that they all tend to say -- they come to a common means, and I talk about that process in my first report.
Q. In your report you don't distinguish between different types of education around the country; isn't that right?
A. Such as? Could you give me an example of what you mean?
Q. For example, is it your opinion that the level of education that students received in this country is the same nationwide?
A. What I can tell you is that virtually every state in the United States, because I haven't looked at literally every state, that
virtually every state or every state that I have looked at, and there have been a number of them, they have a series of laws that
begin to come into place going back to the 1880s. And those laws mandate health education, and within that mandate they in
turn will specify some of the subject areas that must be taught in health education classes. So that's the first part of it.
The second kind of a mandate is, that will come into place in the 1880s and 1890s, and that is, the teachers must begin to be
certified. That is, they must take instruction when they're in school to be prepared to teach about a variety of health subjects,
including alcohol and tobacco. So that's a second subset.
The third subset of this is that schools, districts and state, state agencies, produce all sorts of curricula and all sorts of curricula
mandates with respect to specifically what the teachers must be talking about at specific points in time. All of that material
leads only to one conclusion, and that is the past one hundred years of health education is covered subjects like alcohol and
tobacco, and in no instance am I aware of at this particular point in time has that involved saying these products were good
for you. In fact, it's usually quite the opposite.
Q. Have you studied curriculum or curricula since 1964 on a national basis?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
48Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. Yes. A number of different types of curricula have been made available, and increasingly, as again, this is the case with
any kind of textbook writing, the knowledge that would be contained in the textbooks is reflective of the knowledge that is
available at a particular point in time.
So increasingly actually beginning in the 1950s, textbooks and curricula will emphasize a link between smoking and lung
cancer. That link will be broadened to heart disease. That link will eventually include listing tobacco and tobacco products as
addictive substances comparable to heroin and other kinds of hard drugs, so on and so forth.
Those materials are there. A lot of money goes into the development of those materials. In fact, one of the most recent articles
I read in the Houston chronicle is a whole new curriculum that has been developed that is trying to be installed throughout the
United States, again to deal with these issues. So yes, these are in constant development after the 1960s.
Q. You didn't factor into your opinion any differences in socioeconomic status -- well, let me say it differently. You didn't
consider the fact that there are poor school districts versus -- well, back up. You point to textbooks and curriculum and say
that they were widespread.
A. Yes.
Q. Do you take into account the fact that there are schools throughout this country, let's date it from 1964 on, that have less
resources than others?
A. Well, that's -- certainly knowing in the state I live in that's been an issue, and that issue has been resolved by redistributing
the tax money.
Q. You're talking about a resolution during your life, during the last decade.
A. Yes. Well, no. Actually the last two decades.
Q. Are you saying that -- would you recognize that there is an illiteracy problem today in this country?
A. Yes, I'd say there's an illiteracy problem.
Q. And there's been one since at least 1964.
A. Well, I think there has been one since the beginning of time.
Q. OK. But at least since 1964.
A. If not back to the beginning of time.
Q. OK. And there's a, if you track education and the impact of education based on socioeconomic status, well, let me just --
I will make this a lot simpler.
You could point to textbooks and curriculum, but if somebody doesn't know how to read, they are not going to get the messages
contained in those books or those curricular; is that right?
A. Well, the books, if they can't read, it will be somewhat difficult. But presumably the books are reinforcement as to the
standard textbook, to what the classroom teacher is presenting, and you have various kinds of state mandates. You don't literally
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
49Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
have to have a textbook in front of a person to receive the information. They may not have had textbooks at the Willowridge
School for all I know.
However, the teacher is presenting certain kinds of information. Quite often that is mandated by the school district, the county
or the state, and the teachers are receiving curricula guides. And whether -- I think whether a district would be rich or poor, I
can't imagine there is a state out that would say we're only going to send the curricula guides to the teachers in the rich districts,
because the schools end up paying for these. These are state-generated materials coming out of state departments of education.
So I guess the only other point I can make is that while there is literacy, most states have some sort of law which will require
students to be in school up to -- usually it's the age of 16, and these subjects are quite often covered repeatedly in primary grades
according to these curriculum guides.
Q. Is it your opinion that every one who smokes cigarettes today, in 2000, in the United States, has at some point been told in
the educational process that smoking is bad for you?
A. Pretty much so.
Q. At what point in time did school textbooks contain the message that smoking was harmful to your health?
A. The earliest that I have seen, and this is sort of the beginning of the rise of the modern textbook industry, those books go
back to the 1880s. I don't recall that I have seen anything before the 1880s.
Q. That would be the start. At what point would you be able to say that everybody in this country was being told in school that
smoking is bad for you through the use of textbooks?
A. Well, I can't. I am not sure that I can give you a specific date. But once you have mandated public education, and most states
are to the point where you have some form of mandated public education by the year 1900, they may debate over the hours of
the day, and that has to do with an agricultural society and children being home to help with farm-related activity.
But most schools are in a position where they -- I should say not in a position, where they have been mandated to be open for
X number of months and attendance is required. Certainly by the early 20th century.
So if we wanted a safe date, I guess we could safely say by 1920 or at the latest by 1930. But I would say 1920 would be a
very safe date.
Q. Do you believe that cigarette ads contain messages about the health effects of smoking?
A. I think we'll have to become more specific.
Q. Are you aware of any ads by the tobacco industry in the 20th century --
A. I've seen cigarette ads.
Q. -- that contain information about the health effects of smoking?
A. I've seen cigarette ads, yes.
Q. Not just have you seen cigarette ads, but that contain information about the health effects of smoking.

50Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. Yes. I've seen advertisements from the 1950s that talk about various kinds of things that say our cigarette won't burn your
throat as much as someone else's cigarette, that sort of thing.
Just to give you an example. I don't exactly think that's a very positive health message, but it's a message.
Q. And those who saw the ad or -- those who saw the ad would be made aware of that message; isn't that right?
A. I suppose so. I don't know. I have not -- I am not an expert on cigarette advertising or advertising in general. So these would
be personal opinions.
Q. Your opinion is about public awareness in this case. And you didn't in your analysis -- well, let me say this. In your report you
don't mention anywhere, in either of your reports, you don't mention anywhere the influence of cigarette ads. Isn't that right?
A. No, I don't.
Q. You don't mention cigarette ads at all in your report.
A. I don't recall that I did.
Q. And that would include cigarette ads that contain information about whether smoking is harmful.
A. Well, that's -- I thought you said healthful before. I may be wrong.
Q. I haven't used the word “healthful” today. That's your word. I can't say it. It's a tongue twister.
A. OK. Harmful.
Q. Harmful.
A. Cigarette ads which said they were harmful.
Q. No, no, let me restate it. Since 1964 you're aware that the tobacco industry has placed ads that state -- well, that contain
information about whether or not smoking is harmful. Do you agree?
A. Since 1964?
Q. Yes.
A. Could you give me an example?
Q. Well, I am just asking for your awareness as opposed to giving you an example. Are you aware that the tobacco industry
put out ads?
A. Since 1964?
Q. That's right.
A. That said cigarettes were harmful?

51Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. No, no, that contained information about whether or not cigarettes are harmful..
A. I am not sure I can answer the question without a specific example.
Q. You testified earlier that the tobacco industry's position in response to the ‘64 surgeon general's report was that we just don't
know enough. It's still not proven whether or not smoking causes cancer.
A. Something to that effect. Without having documents in front of me, that's a guess on my part.
Q. OK. Are you aware that the tobacco industry has repeated that message publicly since that time?
MR. KOETHE: I am going to object to the form of the question because I do think it mischaracterizes earlier testimony, but --
MR. STOLPER: The question doesn't even involve his testimony.
But go ahead, you can answer. Do you need it read back.
THE WITNESS: Yes, please.
MR. STOLPER: I'm going to ask the court reporter to read it back. (A portion of the record was read.)
MR. KOETHE: Same objection.
A. I can't document without specific instances, but I have seen that -- I have seen that message.
Q. Where have you seen that message?
A. Well, if we take newspaper articles as an example, some report will come out about this, that or something else that may
be harmful to tobacco and reporters will call someone, some representative of the tobacco industry and say, What's your take
on this? And the message will be pretty much the same.
Q. But you in your research didn't identify ads.
A. Well, we weren't talking about ads.
Q. I'm sorry. I want to qualify that. Ads by the tobacco industry.
A. In my research did I specifically look at advertisements?
Q. Yes.
A. I mean, I have seen cigarette advertisements, but no, I didn't specifically. As I said before, I am not an advertising expert.
Q. I wasn't suggesting you were an advertising expert. I am just saying as part of your methodology you didn't review
advertisements by the tobacco industry that contained messages about whether or not smoking was harmful.
A. I did not purposefully seek out. Is that what you're suggesting?
Q. That's right.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
52Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. I did not purposely seek out. However, in 1967 there was quite a debate in the public press that involved the Federal
Communications Commission, and the Federal Communications Commissioned ruled on the so-called “Fairness Doctrine,”
that in regard to cigarette advertising, because it might well be dangerous to one's health, that agency should be allowed to put
on television a variety of public service announcements warning of the dangers of tobacco.
And my research assistant and I have collected an enormous number of those public service announcements, and they aired
continuously from 1967. And after cigarette advertising was knocked off the TV or was legislated off the television in, again,
I think the date was January 2, 1971, in various ways these ads continued even though there was no cigarette advertising on
television. And these are antismoking advertisements and public service announcements I'm referring to.
Q. Are you aware of the tobacco industry's efforts to limit or eliminate those public service announcements?
A. It didn't have much effect.
Q. And you're able to conclude --
A. If one, I mean, I'm sorry. I should finish.
Q. I cut your answer. Go ahead.
A. That I'm not aware of specific efforts to eliminate those. I mean, they don't -- specific records don't come to mind, but they
were not successful.
Q. They weren't successful in eliminating them in their entirety, correct?
A. Public service announcements?
Q. Yes.
A. Public service announcements with respect to -- again, that I have seen, with respect to the health consequences of, dangerous
health consequences associated with smoking, certainly the ones that I have continue well into the 1980s.
And I can only presume that if agencies such as the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American
Lung Association, and various governmental agencies were making these announcements, that they were getting on the air with
some regularity. Getting on the air, that is, on television.
Q. For purposes of the deposition, I'll agree with you. Public service announcements were issued. No debate about that. But
you have no way of knowing whether more public service announcements would have been done absent the influence of the
tobacco industry.
MR. KOETHE: Object to the form of the question in that it assumes facts not in evidence.
MR. KRAUS: I also object that you're calling for him to speculate.
A. My response would be that I would have a hard time believing that agencies such as the American Cancer Society, the
American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the HEW under Joseph Califano and others in its various
permutations, that any of these would have been listening carefully to the tobacco industry on this subject.

53Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. What about the broadcasters that would have been airing the public service announcements?
A. The broadcasters? You mean the local stations? Again, I would have to -- I would have to speculate about that. I don't have
any information.
I can tell you that some of these advertisements became very, very famous and well-known, and that would suggest to me they
were on television quite a lot.
Q. Hypothetically if the tobacco industry were successful in reducing the number of public service announcements that were
aired on television, you would agree that that would have an effect on public awareness of health effects of smoking.
A. No, I wouldn't agree with that. And I will have to come at this from two different points of view. I have not specifically
looked into FCC regulations, but I do know from personal experience that in the decade of the 1970s, and I presume it's true
down to our own time, the FCC expects stations to carry a variety of public service announcements that all advertising cannot
be from the dollars of potential corporate sponsors.
So that I can't -- while I can't state the specific information because I haven't studied the information in detail, that would be
certainly from my point of view a part of the equation.
Secondly, whether a person sees something like the coughing cowboy one time or 50 times, it probably has less effect each
time you see it. That's one reason you keep changing these and making new ones, because they lose the effect over time. But
anybody who has seen the coughing cowboy is not going to have a very positive impression of cigarettes and smoking. I am
just using that. That one came out in about 1967 or ‘68.
MR. STOLPER: Mark this as Exhibit 7.
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 7, letter dated 6/5/78, Bates number TIMN 073120, marked for identification, as of this date.)
Q. We have put before you, professor, what has been marked as Exhibit Number 7. It's a letter from the Tobacco Institute to
broadcasters dated June 5, 1978. It bears the Bates stamp of TIMN 073120. And as I explained yesterday, that Bates stamp
reflects the production by the Tobacco Institute.
A. OK.
Q. Let me know when you have had a chance to look at the document.
A. OK.
Q. Have you had a chance?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you see the Tobacco Institute?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know what the Tobacco Institute is?
A. Yes.

54Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. What is it?
A. It's, to use my terms, the trade association of the tobacco industry.
Q. Do you see in this letter dated June 5, 1978, they're writing to broadcasters about public service announcements?
A. Yes.
Q. And this letter represents an effort by the Tobacco Institute to limit the number of -- to influence broadcasters about the
number of public service announcements that are to be aired. Do you see that?
MR. KOETHE: Object to the form of the question.
A. I don't read -- I don't see where it says limit the amount. Maybe I didn't read it completely or carefully enough.
Q. If I can draw your attention to the second to last paragraph from the bottom, which reads “HEW and FTC want your prime
time. Before you're forced to give away more of it to antitobacco activists, we felt you should know how their claims rely more
on fancy than fact.”
Do you see that?
A. Yes.
Q. What's your understanding of what the Tobacco Institute is trying to accomplish by sending this letter?
A. It's saying before you give away more time. It doesn't say will you reduce or cut back on your time.
Q. OK, but they're trying to limit the total number of public service announcements that are to be aired; isn't that right?
MR. KOETHE: Object to the form of the question. It calls for speculation.
A. I can't, without knowing how many were on at this particular time. After all, they may have been run on every hour of every
day. So I am not sure what kind of limitation. It's talking here about prime time or some such thing.
It's also talking about some article that I have never -- that at least I am unaware of. It has to deal with behavior.
Q. You're referring to the American Journal of Public Health?
A. Yes, this article published a review of 126 reports on the results of smoking education programs.
Q. You have never seen that article?
A. I may well have. I just don't recognize it in this context.
Q. Do you recognize the journal, the American Journal of Public Health?
A. Absolutely. There are several publications from the American Journal of Public Health on the reliance list.

55Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. Do you know if you have on your reliance list an article from the American Journal of Public Health where there was a
review of 126 reports on the effects of smoking education programs?
A. I can't say for sure, but I don't think so.
Q. The Tobacco Institute is citing to that report to suggest that public service -- well, let me quote it. The Tobacco Institute
is referring to the American Journal of Public Health article to suggest that smoking education programs have not produced
significant change in smoking behavior.
Do you see where they are doing that?
A. Well, actually, the next paragraph talks about campaigns that have specifically used mass media advertising methods, and I
presume the campaigns they are talking about are public service announcement related campaigns.
That would not be necessarily a part of the review of 126 reports, because there are obviously a great variety of smoking
education programs out there. So I don't know what portion, for instance, would fall into the mass media category.
Q. Right. The letter is pretty clear. They're saying that in general, according to the American Journal of Public Health, smoking
education programs are not effective.
MR. KRAUS: Objection. You've mischaracterized both the letter and his testimony.
Q. You can answer.
A. I was trying to make the distinction that the third paragraph talks about 126 reports, and the fourth paragraph talks about
specific group of campaigns without numbering them that use mass media advertising methods. And I take it the author found
in that category that none of these campaigns has produced significant change in smoking behavior.
I don't know what the author said about the other campaigns. I don't know whether that was the overall conclusion. All I can
do is read what is on the paper.
Q. Have you read any articles that have appeared in the American Journal of Public Health where the article concludes that
public service announcements were ineffective in producing change in smoking behavior?
A. I don't think I'm familiar with this particular article.
Q. Have you seen any articles like it?
A. Like it dealing with media related issues?
Q. Yes.
A. I probably have, but none is particularly coming to mind. Not necessarily in the American Journal of Public Health.
Q. If the Tobacco Institute is accurate in representing the findings of this article in the American Journal of Public Health, that
would conflict with your opinions in this case, wouldn't that be so?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
56Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. What I can tell you is it would not only conflict with my opinion, but it would conflict with an enormous number of
individuals who spent millions and millions of dollars producing dozens if not literally hundreds of different of public service
announcements, all of which conveyed in different ways a single message, and that was that smoking wasn't good for your health.
That in turn had become part of that corpus of knowledge that is out there. So while these may not have any specific effect,
the sum total as we talked about before is a specific effect. After all, during this period in question we talk about over 50
million Americans who stopped smoking. So without knowing more about this or being able to review or analyze it, I can't
say more than that.
Q. Was that information that you're just referring to available in 1978?
A. I don't know what number was available in 1978.
Q. But would you have had that conclusion in 1978, that the sum total of all this information was actually effective?
A. Well, it is my understanding that in terms of smoking prevalence rates that the number was declining in the 1970s, and it's
continued to decline down to our own time.
So I don't know how a person can turn around and say it didn't affect smoking behavior when smoking, the number of smokers
is in decline. I don't know how the author reached the conclusion since I don't --
Q. So you think the author was being misleading by sending this letter to broadcasters?
A. I have no idea what the author was trying to do in this. Sorry.
Q. Having read the letter, you have no idea what the author from the Tobacco Institute was trying to accomplish?
A. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you meant the author of the article in the American Journal of Public Health.
Q. No, no. I'm sorry. No, I am talking about the letter.
A. What my reading the letter is is that they're saying that they want to take more of your prime time for public service
announcements. We're going to encourage you not to do so.
Q. And the reason they give in this letter for not doing to?
A. They go back to that particular article. I have no way of knowing whether anybody ever read this letter.
Was this letter actually sent to someone? I mean, I have got to ask questions like that because that's what historians do.
Q. Well, I guess you will get to ask the Tobacco Institute that. But for the purposes of today's deposition.
Your opinion in 1978 is that it was known in 1978 that public service announcements that were part of smoking education
programs were effective; is that right?
A. I would assume that certainly all of those people investing all of that money thought that there must be some basis for
effectiveness or they would not have done that.
Q. Putting aside from the perspective of the people who actually made the ads, from your perspective.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
57Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. My own personal perspective?
Q. No, no. Let me clarify that. Your opinion of what was known in 1978 about the effectiveness of public service announcements
as part and parcel of smoking education programs, were they effective or not? Was it known in 1978?
MR. KRAUS: Objection to the form of the question. What do you mean by effective?
A. I would have to answer the question just as I did before. And that is, if you take smoking prevalence rates, the number of
smokers is in decline during the 1970s. I would suspect -- while I can't say that any one public service announcement affected an
individual's decision, as I tried to indicate yesterday, there are lots of different things that could affect a decision to stop smoking,
I would have to say that certainly the sum total impact of public service announcements was to further spread awareness and
belief that smoking was harmful. That comes out again in all the public polling information that we have gone through.
So I would have to conclude that public service announcements were having some effect. But to try to isolate that, I mean,
there are so many variables at play here, to isolate one and to try to study that without the broader array is very, very difficult
for me to do.
Q. Just picking up on your answer before when I asked about this journal article and you said it was contrary to the larger
body of information that's out there, so I am -- just a time question. In 1978 would that article -- well, not the article itself,
but the conclusions as represented by the Tobacco Institute, would they have run afoul of the larger body of information that
was known as of 1978?
A. I have got to be clear when you say larger body of information that we're not talking just about public service announcements.
When I say larger body of information, I am talking about all that information that has been circulating through society for
years and years and years about the health consequences of smoking. That's what I'm referring to.
I can't say as an individual that any one particular element or source of that information, such as public service announcements,
affected any one individual's decision making. However, what I can say is that smoking prevalent rates were in decline, which to
me would suggest that perhaps this may have been one of the factors that may have affected someone's decision to discontinue
smoking. Or not start in the first instance.
Q. As you sit here today, I mean, you were segregating out public service announcements. So then you could say that -- mass
media advertising methods you're unable to say whether or not they were able to bring about significant change in smoking
behavior. Separate and apart from the overall information that you rely upon.
A. There are so many different kinds of information I rely upon, I cannot eliminate one, and I think you're asking me to eliminate
one. Without being familiar with the article I can't eliminate that.
My personal opinion would be the public service announcements did have some sort of an effect along with lots and lots of
other types of information that was being made available to the public.
Q. And the opinion you just stated, was that well-known in 1978?
A. What, that --
Q. That public service announcements were successful as you just said.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
58Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. Well, certainly people who were making them thought they were a success. The people who were airing them thought they
were successful.
Q. How about the people --
MR. KRAUS: Could you let him finish his answer?
MR. STOLPER: I thought he was.
A. Why would the American Cancer Society invest so much money in public service announcements when it is just one of
several ways to convey information to people if it didn't think or it didn't have some basis that someone somewhere was paying
attention to these kinds of announcements?
I mean, that's a very logical decision that an administrator would go through at an agency such as the American Cancer Society,
which was a major supplier. The same with the American Heart Association, another major supplier. These were very --
campaigns. They were very elaborate campaigns. They weren't always just contained -- for instance with the American Heart
Association the complains didn't just necessarily involve a public service announcement on TV. They would be a much broader
an array.
They could come up with a national spokesperson. The national spokesperson in some of the Heart Association material that I
have reviewed would do special tapes. It would be presented to workers in local areas. Those workers in turn would be supplied
with all sorts of graphic or visual material which would be sent out in local communities.
These things aren't done in isolation. They are part of a larger whole. That's what I am trying to suggest.
Q. So you say, in response to my question you said the American Cancer Society and others who put out public service
announcements wouldn't have done it if they didn't have a basis for thinking that it was effective; is that right?
A. They had other ways of communicating their messages, and I would be very surprised that they would -- as individuals who
were concerned about these issues, I would shall very surprised if these kinds of agencies would have invested so much money
if they had not been under the impression that this kind of material along with all sorts of other kinds of activities that were
going on was not having an effect.
Q. And isn't the same thing true of the tobacco industry?
A. What same thing?
Q. I'm going to fill in the blank.
A. I'm sorry.
Q. Why would the tobacco industry put out ads communicating their position about whether smoking is harmful if they didn't
have a basis for thinking that at least some people would be receiving and acting upon that message?
A. This is the Tobacco Institute, any specific instance. There are no cigarette advertisements on TV after 19 -- January 2, 1971,
which I believe is the date.
Q. The question wasn't limited to the Tobacco Institute or that particular example of public service announcements. You made
the general statement that they wouldn't have put out that type of communication. The American Cancer Society as an example,
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
59Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
they have lots of ways of putting out information. They wouldn't have gone the way of public service announcements if they
didn't think it was an effective way of communicating their message.
A. Right.
Q. So the question is, isn't the same thing true for the tobacco industry? They wouldn't have been putting out ads, magazine
print or otherwise, if they didn't think that their message was getting through.
A. Well, you have to tell me what that message is and then we can perhaps -- and this is all going to be speculation because
we're back into the area of advertisement again and I have not presented myself as an expert on advertisement.
Q. But you have presented yourself as an expert on what people knew about tobacco and smoking. You obviously know that
the tobacco industry has spent billions of dollars to communicate their point of view about smoking since 1964, don't you?
MR. KRAUS: Objection. Lack of foundation?
Q. You can answer.
A. Well, I don't have any numbers. But I suppose we can conclude that if these public service announcements, to quote from the
article, none of these campaigns has produced significant change in smoking behavior. What is good for public announcements
might well be true for the tobacco industry.
Because as I have repeatedly stated over and over again, the amount of public awareness and/or belief that is out there is
extraordinarily high by the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, and it's reflected in a whole variety of public opinion polls that we have
discussed, and it's also reflected in smoking prevalence rates which are in decline.
In fact, one could argue that cigarette advertising was a total failure. But I'm not an advertising expert.
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 12:37. We're going off the record.
(A recess was taken.)
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 12:49 p.m. We're back on the record.
MR. STOLPER: Can I get the last answer read back.
(A portion of the record was read.)
Q. I don't want to misstate your prior testimony before the break, so let me know if you agree with this.
Is it your opinion that the tobacco industry was not successful in influencing what information regarding smoking and health
appeared on TV?
A. It was not successful in -- when you say TV, are we talking specifically about public service announcements or are we talking
about cigarette advertisements? Television shows? I just want --
Q. We can start with public service announcements. I was thinking more broadly of television shows in general, but either one,
television shows or public service announcements.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
60Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Is your opinion that the tobacco industry was not successful in limiting -- I think I used the word influencing before, so let me
restate it so that there's no confusion.
Is it your opinion that the tobacco industry was not successful in influencing what appeared or didn't appear on television
programs which would include public service announcements with regard to smoking and health?
A. I would say that generally speaking these were pretty uninfluential.
Q. Prior to today's deposition were you aware of any efforts by the tobacco industry to influence what information appeared
on TV, as an example, with regard to smoking and health?
A. Well, I had read some articles in newspapers presented by various individuals that would talk about -- and this may also
include movies that they would say, well, here is someone who smoked in this television program or someone smoked in
that movie, and we shouldn't allow that sort of thing to go on. I've been aware that some people have conducted that kind of
research, yes.
Q. But your conclusion is that any effort by the tobacco industry was unsuccessful.
A. I said pretty much so.
Q. If the tobacco industry were successful would that change your opinion?
A. Well, that's a counterfactual question based on what you just presented, because I just said I didn't think they were very
successful. So I would have to see some hard and fast evidence that they were successful in some way.
I don't think you can count as a success when cigarette advertisements were eliminated from television in 1971. I'd call that
somewhat of a failure. Public service announcements were still on in the 1970s and the 1980s and there was no counterbalance
in the form of cigarette advertisement. So fairness was apparently not both -- didn't cut both ways. But the law was cigarette
advertisements were off of TV.
I have reviewed television programs of various types and kinds and I have yet to find one what in terms of a plot that was being
developed that would serve as anything but a warning to the audiences that smoking wasn't probably very good for them.
Q. Would you agree that images that appeared on TV with regard to smoking -- for example, if a movie star was smoking, a
television star was smoking a cigarette on TV, would you agree that that imagery influences the viewers' perceptions about
the risks associated with smoking?
A. I guess you would have to give me a specific instance. Because I have seen images of people smoking on TV, and the whole
point of those individuals smoking is to make the point that smoking is not good for you, because that's usually built into the
script in some way.
Q. Is that true for all television programs?
A. I can't talk, I can't speak for all television programs.
Q. Is that true for all decades since television has been around?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
61Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. It is certainly true I think in terms of the types of programs that are on television. I can't say that someone didn't at some
point smoke on television. I don't think we have laws against that. But I have no basis of evidence that it made any difference
if they did.
Q. Is it your opinion that smoking was never glamorized on television?
A. No. I can't say that.
Q. So it's possible that smoking was.
A. Well, when smoking was much more commonplace in American culture, people smoking on television was a common
occurrence. When smoking became much more a questionable kind of activity, especially with regard to health, whatever, I
think we could trace a very rapid decline of the cigarette on television.
Q. And when was that? The 1970s?
A. Yes, I would say that began at the time of the surgeon general's report and continued increasingly so down to our own time.
Q. So you're saying in 1964 and from 1964 smoking became socially unacceptable?
A. I think increasingly, and that was one of the factors that I gave for people stopping smoking, increasingly after 1964 smoking
became among -- in certain quarters socially unacceptable, and that did affect peoples' decision to stop smoking.
MR. STOLPER: I would like to mark as Exhibit Number 8.
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 8, executive summary from the Tobacco Institute dated 4/17/87, Bates number TIMN 349140 through 41,
marked for identification, as of this date.)
MR. STOLPER: Is it allowed to be given to the witness?
MR. KRAUS: Yes. Do you know, Michael, whether this is a Bliley document or not?
MR. STOLPER: I didn't think it was, but if you like, in the interest of time, make an objection, as you normally do with the
Bliley, I don't care. We could just move forward and you reserve your rights.
MR. KRAUS: We'll reserve our rights to an objection on that ground.
MR. STOLPER: OK.
Q. So have you had a chance to look at what's been marked as Exhibit Number 8.
A. Yes.
MR. STOLPER: For the transcript, I will identify it as a executive summary from the Tobacco Institute dated April 17, 1987,
and it bears the Bates stamp TIMN 349140 through 41.
Q. Professor Martin, I would like to draw your attention to the second page under the heading “TI Media Watch.” Do you see
where I am referring?

62Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. Yes.
Q. Do you see where it reads “TI staff convinced CBS Evening News not to run a story featuring the American Lung Association
attacking the cigarette industry in the wake of the Federal Trade Commission's decision to end tar and nicotine testing”? Do
you see that?
A. Yes.
Q. Have you had a chance the review that paragraph?
A. I am doing it right now.
Q. OK.
A. OK, I have finished it.
Q. Were you aware that the tobacco industry attempted to kill a CBS Evening News program regarding smoking?
MR. KRAUS: Objection to the form of the question.
A. Well, if we read here, you know, “not to run a story featuring the American Lung Association attacking the cigarette industry
in the wake of the Federal Trade Commission's decision to end tar and nicotine testing,” I didn't realize that that -- I'm sorry.
I just didn't realize that that had come to an end. I need an explanation about that.
Q. I'm sorry, the “that” in that sentence?
A. That the Federal Trade Commission is no longer testing -- no longer testing tar and nicotine, that it is no longer measuring
tar and nicotine, I didn't know that.
Q. OK. But that's separate, aside from the question.
A. But is that true? I am just asking. It wasn't true in 1996 when I stopped smoking because the tar and nicotine measurements
were still on the cigarettes then.
Q. I think for purposes of my question, whether the FTC had decided in 1986 or ‘87 to make a decision with regard to tar and
nicotine testing, I think that's sort of a side question.
The question I posed to you is, were you aware that the tobacco industry attempted to kill a story that was to appear on CBS
Evening News that would have been critical of cigarettes?
MR. KRAUS: Objection to the form of the question.
A. Let me respond. I don't recall this specific instance. What I'm getting out of this, and that's the reason I raised the other point
is, one reason the story wasn't run was it was not going to happen. I mean, but sometimes that affects the situation.
The Tobacco Institute can make all sorts of claims like this, that it had an effect on the decision, but without knowing what
CBS -- was going on the CBS Evening News at that time, I really can't respond completely to the question.
Q. Well, the question was just did you know that a story was killed, not did you understand why or the reason.

63Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. Since the story was not run, it may have not been run because it wasn't true. That's the issue that I was raising.
Q. Is that a position according to this that TI was raising, that it was untrue?
A. They may have been making all sorts of claims about their accomplishments that were also not true. I don't know.
Q. But there's no suggestion that the reason it was killed was because it was untrue. It states there that the charges are unfair.
Do you see that?
A. Um --
Q. Do you see where it says that?
A. The question that I am raising, and I honestly don't know and that's the reason I ask is, when did the Federal Trade Commission
decide to end tar and nicotine testing? If that's not true, then what would be the point of having the story?
Q. So what you're doing here is you're coming up with another reason why the story should have been killed. You're saying
the story was wrong.
A. Well, actually, from a news point of view that would be a good reason to kill the story if it's not true. But I am not debating
that. All I am saying is I am just trying to get the context. I need to get the context of this and I don't understand the context.
I just don't have the information available to me.
Q. But the question about whether or not -- I think you answered if original question.
As a researcher you would have had no way to find out whether or not the Tobacco Institute influenced the decision whether
to air or not to air smoking related information.
A. Yes, as a researcher I would have a way based on the context of television programming and television news in the 1980s
and 1990s. I don't think the Tobacco Institute influenced much of what was on television in the 1980s and 1990s.
So that I then would put that into this context, and my counterresponse would be, as a researcher and as a historian, trying
to evaluate a document without enough contextual information that I have asked for, my conclusion would be this is a claim
that may or may not be true. But I would find it very difficult to believe the CBS Evening News is bowing to the whim of the
Tobacco Institute. I would be very surprised at that.
Q. But that's what's being suggested by this Tobacco Institute document.
A. That's what it says. It does not mean it's true.
Q. But that's what's being suggested, correct? By the Tobacco Institute.
A. That's what they suggest right here.
Q. If the Tobacco Institute were true in what it said, that would influence your opinion, wouldn't it?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
64Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. There is a counterfactual question because what I just said, um, what I have just said is that I have no basis of understanding
whether this is true or not. And I find probably that claim to be somewhat of a stretch if not an exaggeration.
And in addition, if this story had aired by 1988, to go back to the whole universe again that we have talked about, I can't imagine
this would have made any difference one way or the other.
Q. You're saying --
A. Because -- I'm sorry.
Q. Go ahead. You can finish. You're at a “because.”
A. Because of all the information that has been circulating through society increasingly so that we have talked about again and
again during the 20th century and with increasing volume and frequency in the fifties, sixties, seventies and eighties. The story
would have probably gotten lost in the wind if it had aired.
But I am interested. Just for personal interest, I would like to know whether that's true, that tar and nicotine testing ended in 1988.
Q. So you're saying if I wanted to -- myself, if I today wanted to spend a billion dollars to advertise, put out advertisements, to
say it's unproven that smoking causes cancer. Until we find out whether smoking causes cancer, you shouldn't stop smoking.
And I spent a billion dollars to advertise that in all mass media outlets that I could possibly get. You're going to tell me that that
effort would have no impact on what people were aware of with regard to smoking and health?
A. Could you give me a specific example?
Q. I thought I just did. I just gave you a hypothetical.
A. You're saying as hypothetical example we spend a billion dollars in 19 -- I'm sorry, in 2000.
Q. In 2000.
A. I forgot which year we were in. I know it sometimes. I got the dates confused.
In the year 2000 you spent a billion dollars on that subject I would suggest to you that would be the biggest waste of money
you could possibly spend.
Q. How about 19 -- I'm sorry.
A. And the reason for that is that we talked about smoking prevalence rates, and all of the previous advertising has had very
little effect apparently on that process of decline. We talked about that. And because the process of decline is there.
And I can't imagine hypothetically that it would make any difference because I think we are now talking the point of virtual
full awareness and belief with respect to the dangers of tobacco, using tobacco products.
Q. How about the opposite? If I wanted to spend a billion dollars today to advertise that smoking, you shouldn't smoke. It's bad
for you. It causes cancer among other things. would you say that that would be a waste of money and time?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
65Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. It might well be, because Daniel Horn in 1968 said you can shout that from every rooftop in the United States and you
wouldn't be telling people anything they didn't already know.
Q. How about kids? Because you talked about education. What if I were to do the same thing today, spend a billion dollars
advertising in publications and television shows where kids watch and said, don't smoke. It's bad for you? Would you have the
same opinion, I would be wasting my money?
A. I can't -- I can't say. What I can tell you is again we go over all of our polling information. I have looked at a number of
surveys of attitudes and understandings on the part of children over a long period of time, and they conclude over and over
again, they speak at very high levels of awareness, belief and understanding.
Q. Right. And you mentioned earlier when I presented you with the example of the fifth graders, you said even if the principal
told them what RJR was asking the principal to tell them, hey, it's not known yet what causes cancer, you said they wouldn't
have believed it in the 1970s.
MR. KOETHE: Object to the form of the question.
A. I don't know what the principal did. But my guess is if he had told the children he would have had a war on his hands with
the PTA and the school board and he might have gotten fired in the context of 1978. If that was the year, ‘77/‘78. That's a
hypothetical.
Q. That's a hypothetical.
A. Yes.
Q. Neither one of us knows what the principal actually did.
A. That's right.
Q. But if the principal did, hypothetically, if the principal did tell those kids, Listen, let me read to you what RJR wrote back.
Look, kids. You actually got a response to your letter. Let me read to you what the tobacco company says, and you read to
them what the tobacco company said, is it your opinion that that message from RJR wouldn't have had an impact on those
fifth graders?
A. The principal is one of many potential authority figures in the lives of fifth graders. My guess is the teacher wouldn't have
let the principal in the room to do it in the first instance if the principal had decided to do that. But the teacher is clearly an
authority figure, and may be a far more important authority figure than a principal.
In addition, those children have parents. They have others in their lives who would be authority figures. They may have gone
home and watched Happy Days for instance and the show in which Joanie decides she should smoke to be part of the peer
group, and at the end she's convincing members of the peer group not to smoke and to stop smoking.
So that it depends on, I mean, what I am trying to suggest to you from the hypothetical point of view is that the sum total of the
weight of information is coming out with the single message, smoking is not good for you.
Q. Right. I understand all the bases why you believe and have testified that evidence presented to kids, that smoking is bad
for you outweighs any other evidence.

66Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
I am just trying to get you to agree or disagree with the idea that if I were to spend a billion dollars today sending that message
to kids that smoking is bad for you, is that a waste of time because they already know it from all the other sources of information
other than my billion dollars worth of ads?
A. Right. Well, it would be a redundancy in the sense that it is coming from so many other sources and overly -- I'm sorry, I
didn't state that -- over and over and over again, and so I really can't say what the impact would be.
Q. Any hired you because you're an expert on what people know today about smoking and said to you, Professor, I would hike
to spend a billion dollars today to send out this message to kids, Don't smoke, what would you tell me to do?
A. I couldn't stop you from doing it if you wanted to spend your money that way. But what I would also tell you is that message
has been going out repeatedly over and over and over and again in all sorts of forms and all sorts of forums. Beyond that there's
not too much that I can say. But it's your money.
Q. How about if you're RJR, R.J. Reynolds, tobacco maker. It's 2000. The chairman calls you up and says, Professor Martin,
you have been testifying on our behalf in different litigation. I have read your opinions. I think you're right. But I need your
advice. I would like to spend a billion dollars today to put out ads to kids to tell them not to smoke. Am I wasting my money?
What would your answer be?
A. Well, I have never met anybody who works for the tobacco industry and I am not expecting a call, so I don't know how
to answer the question.
Q. It's just a hypothetical. I have no expectation that you are going to get a call from the chairman of RJR, but as the hypothetical
goes, I am calling upon your expertise now.
A. To put out don't smoke ads?
Q. To kids. I have got a billion dollars. I can invest it in other things. Based on what you know about what kids know about
smoking in 2000, am I wasting my money?
A. I would say to you that you're going to give them a message which has been repeated over and over and over and over again
in our society, a message which is out there constantly and pervasively. So do as you will.
Q. You would use the term that there's almost full awareness. I think that was your term.
Does that suggest that there's a capacity of information after which any additional information that's provided is merely
redundant?
A. You get a messages 40 times or 50 times. When does it take hold with any individual? I can't say.

BY MR. STOLPER:
Q. Sir, I had asked you a couple of hypotheticals before the tape change. You said in 2000 it would be a waste of my money
to spend a billion dollars for the ad campaign whose message was we don't know if smoking causes cancer or not and those
who claim that smoking causes lung cancer are wrong.
And I believe you said I would be wasting my money in the year 2000; is that right?
A. Well, it was hypothetical.
Q. Hypothetical.
A. And I have repeatedly stated I am not an advertising expert. But I would -- I would say it wouldn't be a very wise investment.
It would not be a good use of your money.
Q. Same hypothetical, 1970. Would it still be a waste of my money in 1970?
A. It would be well on its way to being a waste of your money in 1970.
Q. Does that mean that when you say “well on its way,” meaning it would affect some people, but not as many people as --
it would affect some but not all?
A. Well, since it's a hypothetical, maybe yes, maybe no. I really don't know.
Q. Now, you keep saying you're not an advertising expert. But you also agree that ads affect public awareness of issues as a
general statement, don't you?
A. Do I agree with that?
Q. Yes.
A. I don't -- I can't answer that question. I am not an advertising expert.
Q. So you have no way of knowing whether ads affect public opinion?
A. I can give you two examples.
Q. I just want to do it -- before you give me examples, I just want to do it yes or no.
Do you believe that advertisements, cigarette advertisements, at any point in time can influence the recipients of those ads?
A. Well, from what little I know about advertising, a lot of advertising is predicated on the Why are you driving the Ford? Why
don't you drive a Chevrolet? Why are you smoking a lucky? Why don't you smoke a Chesterfield?
So that would be one sort of a way that advertising might be influential in trying to convince people to use product A as opposed
to product B. And I would think that a lot of advertising would be predicated around that notion and that concept and that idea.
Q. Is it your opinion that today every one who smokes believes that they are at risk of getting lung cancer?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
68Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. I would say a very high proportion of people who smoke are not only aware of it, perhaps do yes believe that they can
develop serious disease of various types and kinds, including lung cancer.
Q. Is the same true for 1964?
A. Well, there's certainly been a great deal more information presented since 1964. But fundamentally I think that there was
movement in that direction in 1964.
Q. Was there enough movement so that by 1964 all smokers knew that they were at risk of getting lung cancer from smoking?
A. Well, we have gone over this repeatedly and the answer to that question is primarily yes.
Q. And the same would be true in 1970, all smokers in 1970 knew they were at risk for lung cancer?
A. I never said all at any time, so we have gone over it again.
Q. My questions have all said all in the last few minutes. So did you not hear me say all?
A. If you said all, I believe I qualified it and said -- well, read back what I said.
(A portion of the record was read.)
A. Fundamentally with the qualification that there may be exceptions to every rule, smokers were receiving an enormous amount
of information by 1970 if not long before that smoking was potentially dangerous to their health.
Q. I asked you if all smokers in 1970 knew that they were at risk of lung cancer and your response is that smokers in 1970 were
being given a lot of information that said smoking was bad for you.
A. That's right. That's what I said.
Q. I understand what you said. Just the answer doesn't fit to the question.
MR. KRAUS: Objection. You're arguing with the witness.
Q. Attorneys are taking issue with the amount of time we're spending here and I am just trying to limit the amount of Q and
A we have to do here.
A. I am trying to limit it to and I am trying to come up with very brief answers, because as I have said repeatedly, you have
asked me the same questions over and over and over again and I have tried to give you reasonable answers to these questions.
Now, on the matter of whether it's all or high proportion or a significant number, I cannot give you a specific. That's what I was
trying to indicate to you. But what I have tried to indicate in my reports, both reports, is that a great deal of information was
being made available and that there were very high levels of awareness to the point of common knowledge and that in addition,
beyond that, there were very striking levels coming in by 1970 and beyond that showed high levels of belief.
Q. You had said before that one needed to be an expert in advertising, of which you were not, as you say, in order to understand
the impact on the public of such ads.
A. I don't think I said that.

69Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. Well, do you disagree with that statement?
A. What I can tell you is that there were thousands and thousands and thousands of bits and pieces of information that were
being made systematically and unsystematically to individuals, that smoking was not good for their health. That if advertising
had so much impact, then I don't understand why. Prevalence rates were going down. That's the briefest answer I can give you
in relation to that question.
Q. So it's your opinion that in order to figure out what messages were getting through to smokers that one would look to
prevalence rates?
A. The last place one would -- I'm sorry. One would look to prevalence rates. One would look at public opinion polls. One
would look at the sum total of newspaper articles and newspaper, um, radio and television programs, what was being presented
in the public schools. The whole array of information I presented in my report.
MR. KRAUS: Can I have just a moment?
(Discussion off the record.)
MR. KRAUS: Here is what I suggest we do about time. Obviously we're already past nine hours. The court reporter not
unreasonably said he would like to get something quick to eat.
My suggestion is that we take 15 or 20 minutes, let the court reporter have a quick sandwich. I see that people brought some
food in. We'll go to 2:30. Paul has an airplane to catch. I have got another commitment as well in New Jersey.
As between you and Craig, how you split up that time and who asks the questions, we're indifferent. But we're willing to go
until 2:30.
MR. BOAS: Well, it is my position that the National Asbestos Workers have a day to ask questions. I certainly don't plan to
use it all, but I plan to use as much time as I need to ask the questions that need to be asked on behalf of our clients.
I believe based on what I have seen so far that even if I were to start now there is an excellent chance that that would go
beyond 2:30.
MR. KRAUS: Well, that may be your position. The deposition was cross-noticed in both cases. Judge Gold has directed that
for witnesses like Professor Martin who have been proposed previously and testified previously that there's a maximum of
nine hours for their examination. You knew that going in. How you divided your time with Mr. Stolper was between you and
Mr. Stolper.
And I think we'll have to reserve on whether or not any further time will be made available to you. But today is going to end
at 2:30.
MR. BOAS: I disagree with your proposition that because Mr. Stolper and I have chosen to cross-notice depositions that we
somehow are sharing every moment. When Mr. Stolper is asking questions, my time is ticking away.
Our clients have separate questions to ask regarding the witness's report, and so on, and his opinions in the National Asbestos
Workers case.
To the extent that there is overlap with Mr. Stolper's questions, certainly I will not have to ask those questions again.

70Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
This deposition could easily have been noted for two separate days, which is to say one or two days for Mr. Stolper and at a
separate date in the National Asbestos Workers case. And I believe that to limit my time to ask questions based on the fact
that there has been cross-notification is using the fact that we have tried to make this convenient as a lever to prevent us from
having our opportunity to ask questions.
MR. KRAUS: I understand your position, but time is ticking away. My suggestion is that we break now and take 15 or 20
minutes so that every one can get a sandwich and then ask as many questions as can be asked until 2:30. I doubt that you and
I are going to agree on this dispute because there's no reason for us to belabor it.
MR. BOAS: I agree with that.
MR. STOLPER: So it's closing at 2:30 no matter what.
MR. KRAUS: Yes.
MR. STOLPER: You don't want to raise the issue with Gold now.
MR. KRAUS: No.
MR. STOLPER: Because I won't be finished by 2:30.
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 1:36 p.m. We're going off the record.
(A luncheon recess was taken at 1:36 p.m.)
AFTERNOON SESSION
(Time noted: 2:07 p.m.)
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 2:07 p.m. We're back on the record.
MR. STOLPER: Before I proceed with some questions, we'll just handle the scheduling issue.
Counsel for the defendants have stated that the deposition is going to conclude at 2:30. It's our position on behalf of the plaintiffs
and Falaise, that we are not done, and we need additional time to conclude the deposition.
We have offered in conjunction with plaintiffs in the NAW case to complete the deposition by 5 o'clock today, and it's my
understanding that that offer has been rejected. Is that right?
MR. KRAUS: That's correct for a variety of reasons. First, we commenced the deposition yesterday, or at least we were here to
commence the deposition at 8:30 in the morning. We made known to you our position before the deposition began in writing
that it was our understanding that it was to be concluded within nine hours. We were here until 5:30 yesterday, although only
five hours of examination took place over that nine-hour span.
We were here again at 8:30 this morning. Again the deposition didn't start until 9:00. We are willing to go until 2:30, even
though it is well beyond the nine hours, that we commenced the deposition with an expectation that it would be concluded.

71Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Professor Martin is tired. Mr. Koethe has a plane to catch. I have a family commitment. And therefore, we have stuck by our
offer to continue until 2:30 where the deposition will conclude at 2:30.
With respect to NAW, I understand Mr. Boas's position that he is being cheated out of his examination. We don't agree with
that position. But he and I have spoken and I have told him that we will get back to him with a more complete response to
his position hopefully next week.
MR. BOAS: Let me just add so the record is clear that yesterday I had indicated that I did not believe that we would finish when
counsel for the defendants had indicated that they would prefer to finish and that I had questions to ask in addition to those
being asked by Mr. Stolper, and that the questions that I would ask on behalf of the plaintiffs in the National Asbestos Workers
would be in addition to those asked by Mr. Stolper, and that the time which we have allotted for our case, which is one day for
the witness, should not be deemed to be in any way abridged by the fact that we chose to cross-notice with the deposition by
the Falaise plaintiffs to avoid the necessity of asking redundant questions of the witness.
Certainly, we could have noted his deposition for a different day and taken a full day of testimony. And while I believe in light
of the questions asked by Mr. Stolper it will not be necessary for us to take a full day, certainly it will not been possible for us
to finish at 2:30, which I note for the record is about 15 minutes away from now and I have yet to ask a single question.
In light of those facts we will have to let the magistrate judge resolve this issue.
MR. KOETHE: I would like to make a short statement for the record. As defense down for NAW we communicated in writing
to plaintiffs' counsel two and a half weeks ago our position that Mr. Martin would be made available for one day, and one
day only, pursuant to agreement entered into among the parties in the case. That position was made known to them and no
response was forthcoming.
I would also like to point out that yesterday afternoon when counsel for plaintiffs and NAW suggested that they were going to
need additional time, we made the offer yesterday afternoon to spend an additional hour and keep Dr. Martin here to answer
additional questions, an offer which was not taken up by the plaintiffs.
MR. BOAS: In response I would add that any position taken by the defendants in the National Asbestos Workers case is certainly
nothing that we should be bound by in the absence of a ruling by the magistrate judge. If they felt that we were not entitled to a
full day in the National Asbestos Workers cases, in the National Asbestos Workers case in addition to whatever time the Falise
plaintiffs' might take in their examination, quite frankly we disagree. And I do not think that it is necessary for us to respond
when we have already noticed a deposition and thereby transmitted our intent to ask questions.
As for counsel's offer of one hour to take a deposition when we have the right to take an entire day's questions, I do not consider
that a serious offer.
MR. KOETHE: We'll have to take it up at a later time.
MR. STOLPER: Now that we have all said our peace.

JAMES KIRBY MARTIN, resumed and testified as follows:
EXAMINATION BY (Cont'd.)
MR. STOLPER:
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
72Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
Q. Professor Martin, in the few minutes we have remaining, as a historian and researcher, can you determine what people were
aware of with regard to the health risks associated with smoking without relying upon opinion polls?
A. Well, I think that public opinion polls are further confirmation of what would be otherwise obvious by virtue of the sheer
volume of information that is being made available and is circulating through society.
So while one's conclusion may not be as precise, one's conclusion would still I would think be fundamentally the same.
Q. Is it a fair characterization of your methodology that you assumed that the sheer volume of information equates to the receipt
of that information by those?
A. No.
Q. Absent opinion polls, how do you know as a researcher, what evidence do you have that indicates that a student, for example,
actually read the textbook that you identified in your report?
A. What I can tell you is that teachers in courses relating to public health -- or perhaps just when you're in the primary schools
it may not be divided into a particular kind of a course -- were given a series of mandates and curriculum guides and they were
expected to teach that material.
So I would say that on the basis of that evidence and the basis of that information, absent textbooks, if students were in class,
and hopefully they were, there is every likelihood and there's every reason to assume that they were being taught lessons about
tobacco.
Q. Let's stick for the purpose of the following series of questions with your supplemental report and in general your opinions
about knowledge of synergy. OK?
A. OK.
Q. You identify in your report the press surrounding Dr. Selikoff's 1968 JAMA article in which the concept of synergy is
discussed.
A. Yes.
Q. And I think you may have cited too various newspaper articles.
How do you know that any of the press, that any of the asbestos exposed workers read the press releases or articles that you've
identified in your report?
A. What I can tell you is that if we -- let's perhaps do this. Let's begin with Dr. Selikoff and then let's look first at his insulation
industry hygiene research program.
Among the various activities of that group, Dr. Selikoff would bring in union leaders, would have them come in and would
teach them and offer them the latest information about synergy related issues. In turn, those individuals would go out and they
would present and they would spread that information. So that would be one way that would be going, that that kind of process
would be occurring.

A second way would be through Dr. Selikoff's initial operation, and I am only referring here to the late 1960s, that Dr. Selikoff
and others are sending out all sorts of information. For instance, Dr. Selikoff maintained an elaborate mailing list, I think I've
referred to that before, sending materials, his progress reports, to all sorts of union leaders. In turn, as I've tried to indicate, that
material does appear in various union files.
An additional way that this would be going on is through the AFL-CIO, through the various departments of the AFL-CIO. They
in turn are also reckoning with dealing and they are sharing this information.
So these were some of the ways. In addition, on the West Coast, and I mentioned Dr. Polakoff before, Dr. Polakoff not only
was involved in the program to look at individuals and to offer them physicals and whatever it might be to determine whether
they had the beginnings of asbestos, that as part of that program these workers were handed all sorts of literature. They were
shown video films, on and on and on and on and on. Again, I have mentioned some of these. So these would be some of the
ways that I can characterize that process.
Q. I understand that you've just described what's been in your report, and that is the process. You have described the types
of information that have been circulated and some of the channels through which it's been circulated. And my question, I am
focusing on the recipient side of this information. Those who were supposed to be receiving, the asbestos workers.
As a researcher, how do you reach conclusions that they actually got all the material and the message is being distributed by
union leaders, Selikoff, Polakoff, et al.?
MR. KRAUS: Objection. Asked and answered.
A. Well, again, we have to go back not only to the specific information, but the broader universe of information that was
available about smoking and health related issues.
Q. But just could clear up, I don't want to -- sense we're short on time. My questions are really about information about synergy.
Not information about smoking in general.
A. I will just give you the one example then, and that is the federal government sent out to 30 or 40, again, depending on one's
count, million Social Security recipients warnings that if you have been in contact with asbestos, we would advise that you get
medical exams to find out whether you do have a problem with asbestosis, mesothelioma, perhaps with various forms of cancer.
And that among those items there would be a message that if you're a smoker you should stop. And that if certainly -- well,
we would not with older individuals assume the message, and I don't think it says you shouldn't start. I think that would be
self-evident.
Q. I understand that you reference the mailings by the government that contain that information. But how can you figure out
as a researcher whether or not those 20 to 30 million people actually received the letter, opened these letters, opened the letter,
read it, and --
A. In that case I would assume that all million opened the letter because it had their Social Security check on the outside. Now,
whether they read the letter or they just threw it away, I can't speak to that particular issue.
But this thing goes back that this information is being offered over and over again in a variety of forms that we have discussed
during the past two days, and those forms were reflected in my reliance tests.
Q. Can you site any polls that confirm your opinion that asbestos workers knew about the increased risks due to synergy?

74Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. Can I cite any polls specifically --
Q. Yes.
A. -- that asked asbestos workers specifically whether they knew?
Q. Yes.
A. I am not sure I am aware of any such poll. However, I am aware of many, many polls that ask members of the population,
including union members, what they thought about smoking, and that one of those polls, for instance, dealt with do you think
it's harmful to your health and what are the risk levels, and there is actually -- and this is in the 1970s. There's actually a column,
and I don't remember the exact numbers, but the union members per se were there with every one else in terms of that sense of
awareness and knowledge about the potential harmfulness of smoking. So that is at least one poll that I can cite.
Q. Which poll are you referring to? Is it a Gallup poll? Roper? HEW?
A. I think, I think it's a Roper poll from 1987.
Q. Did they ask about in that Roper poll -- I understand that you may not recall the specific name, but the poll that you're
thinking about right now, did they ask specifically whether the people responding to the poll were aware that smoking causes
lung cancer?
A. Yes.
Q. And specifically identified lung cancer.
A. I don't know whether it specifically identified lung cancer or it was a more general question, because I honestly don't
remember at this point.
The question was is smoking harmful to your health, and that is what I remember as the question.
Q. OK. Have you seen any polls that were done exclusively among asbestos workers about their knowledge or awareness of
the health risks associated with smoking?
A. Have I seen any? Well, I've seen an incomplete poll that was conducted by the government. And I think it was again part of
-- it was part of the Califano campaign in 1977-‘78, and what it generally speaking indicated was that there were -- there was
a rising level of awareness that -- among those who were polled, that -- I am trying to think of the exact question, that asbestos
related -- that you needed to be aware that there were asbestos related diseases as part of, because that was the purpose of the
campaign. Because these campaigns never focused on synergy per se, because there were a variety of other diseases that were
associated and are associated with asbestos exposure.
Q. So that poll that you were referring to -- when you said campaign, you meant the Califano campaign that you talked about
earlier?
A. Yes. And that would include the million Social Security recipients as well.
Q. Califano did commission some poll to be done to set forth the basis for why they needed to do this campaign in ‘77-‘78?

75Robert A. FALISE; Louis Klein, Jr., Frank Macciarola; and..., 2000 WL 35639703...
A. No, I think it was kind of a -- some sort of an awareness poll, are you aware, and that they wanted to demonstrate to the poll
that the numbers went up. It wasn't -- I can't tell you more than that because I don't have a full description of it.
Q. You haven't seen the poll itself.
A. No, I have not.
Q. What have you seen about it?
A. I have seen some numbers in various places, but I don't know what to make of them because without a sense of what the
questions are that are being asked, it's very, very difficult to get a sense of what -- I presume it's one -- I presume that it's some
sort of effectiveness poll.
Q. So would you agree that as of at least 1977-‘78, the time the Califano campaign was initiated, that there was not full
awareness, as you have used that term today, of the risks due to the synergistic relationship between smoking and asbestos?
A. In the framework of the first report that I offered, that there was an abundance of information available about the health
consequences of smoking, I can't say with this particular issue that there would have been one hundred percent awareness. In
19 -- we're talking --
Q. ‘77-‘78.
A. ‘77-‘78. What I can say is that, if I am not mistaken, I hope I don't give you the approximate date, in approximately 1986
the federal government through OSHA, if I am not mistaken, mandated that every worker having exposure to asbestos would
be given an annual physical exam and would be specifically given an update about health, about their own particular health,
whether they were showing signs of asbestosis or whatever, and that they would also specifically be warned about smoking.
Q. So I understand what you're saying, what was the timing, rough timing?
A. I think it was approximately 1986.
Q. So having these medical exams in 1986 increased awareness of the harm due to synergy?
A. I can't say whether it increased awareness or not. Because these individuals were already fully aware long before 1986 that
smoking might have deleterious health consequences.
In terms of that very specific matter, I would think at a point in time in which presumably by government mandate every
asbestos worker was being told every year that smoking is not good for you, that you could certainly, one could fairly conclude
that they had to be aware.
Q. But if we just, again, focusing on not awareness of smoking generally, but your opinion about synergy, of what people
knew about synergy.
A. But I cannot separate these things out because they are inseparable.
