3	VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record.

8	JANETTE THOMAS GREENWOOD, Deponent, having
9	previously been duly sworn, deposes and states as follows:
10
II	CONTINUED EXAMINATION BY MR. SURPRENANT:
12
13	Q. Good morning, Professor.
14	A. Good morning.
15	Q. Thank you for bringing the excerpts from The
16	Pursuit of History. I just read them here this morning.
17	Quite interesting. And I will mark them as an exhibit
18	and have some examination on them later.
19	But I don't want to beat a dead horse, but
20	I -- but I am very interested and concerned about the
21	use of "public awareness" as -- as -- as inserted into
22	the historical research question you answered by the
23	lawyers for Philip Morris.
24	Aware that the normal natural primary
1	definition of aware -- of awareness is knowledge,
2	correct?
3	MR. SNAPP: Object.
4	BY MR. SURPRENANT
5	Q. To be aware of a fact means to have knowledge
6	of a fact, correct?
7	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
8	question.
9	THE WITNESS: No. I don't think that's the
10	case, as I went over a number of times yesterday.
11	Knowledge, as I pointed out, is certainly based on
12	information, but what I've been charged to do in this
13	case is to document in the information environment that
14	was out there for people in Missouri regarding light
15	cigarettes.
16	BY MR. SURPRENANT
17	Q. Okay. Well, I spent some time this morning
18	on the Internet. At home, I have a 22-volume, I think,
19	edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, but I'm not at
20	home, so I had to resort to the Internet, but I was
21	trying to find some definitions of awareness. And I'm
22	going to go over a few of them.
23	(Exhibit 11, Printout of Webpage, marked.)
24
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT
2	Q. I've marked as Exhibit 11a printout from --
3	I think it's the Free Dictionary.
4	Aware, adjective. I'm reading from a
5	document. First meaning: "Having knowledge or
6	cognizance." And then at the bottom, noun. Awareness.
7	"Having knowledge of" as the first meaning.
8	So the use of "aware" and "awareness" from
9	the Free Dictionary which I went online this morning is
10	not the way you're using "public awareness," correct?
11	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
12	THE WITNESS: Again, I think I have explained
13	what my definition is. Public awareness, as I have
14	defined it I think quite clearly in my report, is
15	information that is readily available to -- to everyone.
16	It's information that is widely disseminated. It's
17	information that's deeply disseminated. It's
18	information that is reiterated, reinforced over time.
19	So that is my definition of "public awareness" and how I
20	have used it in this report.
21	BY MR. SURPRENANT
22	Q. Yeah. Professor, I thoroughly understand
23	that. You've made that point and -- a number of times,
24	and I'm aware of that.
1	But my question was: Your -- your use of
2	"awareness" is inconsistent with the definition of
3	"awareness" from the Free Dictionary, which I've marked
4	for identification as Exhibit 11, correct?
5	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
6	THE WITNESS: No. I wouldn't say it's
7	inconsistent. As I explained yesterday, awareness --
8	knowledge is based on information that's -- that's
9	available to people, okay. There is a connection
10	between awareness and knowledge. I think we've gone
11	over that a number of times yesterday.
12	So I'm not -- so, you know, knowledge, as it
13	says in this dictionary -- which again, I have no idea
14	what the Free Dictionary is. I'm not familiar with it.
15	It looks like it's, you know -- as you suggest, it's an
16	online dictionary. I don't know the -- the
17	qualifications of people who put this together.
18	But I did say that there was a relationship
19	between information and knowledge. Knowledge is built
20	and based on information.
21	Again, as a historian in this case, I can
22	tell you what information was available to the people of
23	Missouri regarding light cigarettes. What they knew
24	about light cigarettes, again, I can't answer. It was
1	not my charge in this case to answer that.
2	And again, knowledge is, you know, what --
3	what a person chooses to make of that information,
4	whether they absorb it as knowledge, whether they reject
5	it is again outside of my scope as a social historian in
6	this case.
7	BY MR. SURPRENANT
8	Q. And not only is it outside your charge, a
9	historian is not able to say what any individual or what
10	a population actually knew, correct?
11	A. No. I wouldn't say that that's the case at
12	all.
13	Q. Okay. Now I am even more concerned because
14	it now seems to me that you want the jury to say based
15	on your research that the class or the public knew a
16	fact. And I thought you said up and down yesterday that
17	that wasn't your intent. Have you changed your
18	testimony?
19	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: No. I'm not changing my
21	testimony. And I don't think you're relating what I
22	said yesterday clearly. I think you're misconstruing
23	what I said.
24
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT
2	Q. Well, then we're going to have --
3	A. May I -- may I finish, please?
4	Q. Sure.
5	A. What I said yesterday was that I have been
6	charged in this case as an expert witness, as a social
7	historian, to document the information that was
8	available to the people of Missouri regarding light
9	cigarettes.
10	And I did that, again, defining "public
11	awareness" as the information that is readily available
12	to people, emanating from a wide variety of sources,
13	repeated, reinforced, reiterated over time, broadly
14	disseminated and deeply disseminated, okay. That's what
15	I have been charged with in this case.
16	Historians can determine individual belief,
17	depending again on the sources that are available. I
18	was not charged with that particular duty in this case.
19	For example, you used -- well, let me just
20	stop there.
21	Q. Okay. I thought I'd established this
22	yesterday, but now I'm going to have to do it again --
23	A. I think you did.
24	Q -- I'm afraid.
1	MR. SURPRENANT: So let me mark as Exhibit 12
2	a handwritten sheet that I just did.
3	(Exhibit 12, Handwritten note: Health Issues
4	Relating to Light Cigarettes, marked.)
5	BY MR. SURPRENANT
6	Q. The title is Health Issues Relating to Light
7	Cigarettes. I've quoted "public awareness," and I mean
8	the definition that you've given me that I know that's
9	in your report that we've talked about. And I put a not
10	equals sign, public knowledge.
11	Now, is that -- is that correct or not? Or
12	are you now saying public awareness equals public
13	knowledge or public awareness does not equal public
14	knowledge?
15	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form. We've been
16	through this numerous times --
17	MR. SURPRENANT: Well, the problem -
18	MR. SNAPP: You're misstating her testimony.
19	We went through this over and over again yesterday.
20	MR. SURPRENANT: The problem is that the
21	witness -- and I think she's been encouraged to do
22	this -- is not answering my questions.
23	The present question is very simple. Does
24	public awareness, as the witness has used it in her
1	report, does it or does it not equal public knowledge?
2	She can say yes. She can say no.
3	What she doesn't need to do -- what she
4	doesn't need to do is once again give me a speech about
5	what I already know, which is how she has defined public
6	awareness. I get to ask the questions. This is in
7	effect cross examination.
8	BY MR. SURPRENANT
9	Q. Professor Greenwood, is public awareness --
10	and you don't have to tell me what it is. I know what
11	it is as you have used it in your report. Does it or
12	does it not equal public knowledge?
13	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form. I also
14	object to any insinuation that she's been instructed to
15	answer the questions in any way other than honestly --
16	MR. SURPRENANT: Sure.
17	MR. SNAPP: -- and consistent with her
18	opinions.
19	MR. SURPRENANT: Okay.
20	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
21	question.
22	THE WITNESS: I would say that public
23	awareness does not equal public knowledge, but public
24	knowledge is certainly related to and connected to
1	public awareness because knowledge is based on the
2	information that's available.
3	MR. SURPRENANT: And then I have a
4	understand -- a definition of "understanding" from
5	Google, which I'm going to mark as Exhibit 13.
6	(Exhibit 13, Printout of Webpage, marked.)
7	MR. SURPRENANT: Oh, could I see that just
8	for a moment, Professor?
9	I'll have to make a copy of this at the
10	break. I only have two copies. And so I will --1 will
11	pass examination on that until the break when I can make
12	a copy.
13	So let me go to the Merriam Webster online,
14	which I've marked as Exhibit 14.
15	(Exhibit 14, Printout of Webpage, marked.)
16	BY MR. SURPRENANT
17	Q. Awareness. Two entries found. One, archaic.
18	Watchful, wary. Two, having or showing realization,
19	perception or knowledge.
20	Now, this does not define awareness as having
21	information available to an observer. It instead
22	defines it as -- as the observer having shown
23	realization, perception or knowledge, correct?
24	MR. SNAPP: Objection to form.
1	THE WITNESS: The definition is having or
2	showing realization, perception or knowledge. Yes.
3	BY MR. SURPRENANT
4	Q. And -- and -- okay. That's Exhibit 14.
5	Let me go to the next one I was able to find
6	this morning.
7	(Exhibit 15, Printout of Webpage, marked.)
8	BY MR. SURPRENANT
9	Q. Your Dictionary. And at trial, I'll actually
10	have my -- my Oxford English.
11	Example 15 from Your Dictionary, online
12	service, YourDictionary.com. Aware definition.
13	Adjective. One, obsolete. On one's guard; vigilant.
14	Two, knowing or realizing; conscious; informed.
15	So the Your Dictionary does not define
16	awareness as information being available to an observer
17	without regard to whether the observer actually knew of
18	the information, read the information or made any use of
19	the information, understood the information,
20	comprehended the information or perceived the
21	information, correct?
22	MR. SNAPP: Object to form.
23	THE WITNESS: I'm not sure what the question
24	was.
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT
2	Q. Sure. This definition defines awareness as
3	knowing or realizing, not that the observer merely had
4	the information in some sense available to him or her,
5	correct?
6	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
7	THE WITNESS: Well, if one knows something,
8	that knowledge, as I've mentioned earlier, is based on
9	information.
10	Yeah. This is a -- this is a dictionary
11	definition. Again, I know nothing of -- of the source.
12	Never heard of YourDictionary.com.
13	And again, I think I've made it very clear.
14	I think it's extremely understandable the way I have
15	defined "public awareness." I think a jury can
16	understand that very clearly, what the scope of my -- my
17	research was, what my charge was and what my conclusions
18	were.
19	BY MR. SURPRENANT
20	Q. Right. But you could have defined
21	"public" -- you could have -- you could have defined --
22	instead of describing -- instead of using the term
23	"public awareness," for example, you could have defined
24	actual individual knowledge by every member of the class
1	and used your same definition, and it would have been
2	entirely misleading, correct?
3	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: I - I don't understand the
5	question.
6	BY MR. SURPRENANT
7	Q. Right. Scholars have to use -- it is
8	inappropriate to make up -- to let the tobacco lawyers
9	make up a phrase that is misleading and then define it
10	in an idiosyncratic way that is inconsistent with common
11	English.
12	MR. SNAPP: Objection to form.
13	THE WITNESS: Is that a question?
14	MR. SNAPP: Argumentative.
15	MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. Is it -
16	THE WITNESS: May-
17	MR. SURPRENANT: Let me -- okay. Strike it.
18	I'll ask the question again.
19	BY MR. SURPRENANT
20	Q. You're a professor, correct?
21	A. Yes, I am.
22	Q. A scholar, right?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. A scholar isn't supposed to use idiosyncratic
1	phrases that are misleading as commonly understood
2	without any scholarly support, correct?
3	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
4	question.
5	THE WITNESS: I'm not using it in an
6	idiosyncratic way. I use this concept in my teaching.
7	As I said yesterday, I use it in my research. I use it
8	in my own scholarship. This concept is embedded in
9	social history. I can give you some examples, if you'd
10	like, how I use it in my teaching.
11	BY MR. SURPRENANT
12	Q. I'm not interested in --
13	A. Because I did not make--the tobac--my
14	point in giving you some examples from my teaching is
15	that the tobacco lawyers did not make this up. This is
16	not a term that was foisted, forced upon me by the
17	tobacco industry. I use this concept all the time in my
18	teaching.
19	Q. How much support --
20	A. And I'd be happy to give you some examples.
21	Q. Okay. Now, let's be clear. I'm not
22	interested in a concept. I'm interested in the term
23	that is attached to the concept by the tobacco lawyers.
24	Now, what support, what scholarly support,
1	do -- have you identified in your report, which is
2	66 pages long, single-spaced, 287 footnotes. For the
3	term "public awareness" as you have defined it in your
4	report, I'm correct that there is no scholarly source
5	cited, correct?
6	MR. SNAPP: Objection to form. It's
7	compound. It's argumentative. It's asked and answered.
8	THE WITNESS: I think my definition is very
9	clear what public awareness is. And it is a concept
10	that I use as a teacher and a scholar regularly as a
11	social historian.
12	MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. Let me mark as
13	Exhibit 17 a document that I prepared.
14	(Exhibit 17, All Scholarly Support Cited by
15	Professor Greenwood in Her Expert Report for
16	Her Definition of "Public Awareness,"
17	marked.)
18	MR. SURPRENANT: Mark as Exhibit 17 -
19	MR. SNAPP: Do we have 16? I'm sorry.
20	THE WITNESS: Yeah. We're missing some
21	numbers here.
22	MR. SURPRENANT: I skipped 16.
23	MR. SNAPP: Oh, okay.
24	MR. SURPRENANT: 16 is another definition
1	that I'll get back to.
2	BY MR. SURPRENANT
3	Q. Okay. Now, Exhibit 17 says All Scholarly
4	Support Cited by Professor Greenwood in Her Expert
5	Report for Her Definition of "Public Awareness."
6	"Definition. The concept" -- let me strike
7	"of." "The concept of public awareness" -- and that
8	should be a small I -- "is a familiar one to social
9	historians. It is the knowledge that is shared within a
10	community, as reflected and reinforced by a number of
11	sources that were widely disseminated in that community,
12	including newspapers, magazines and songs, and, since
13	the 20th century, other dimensions of popular culture,
14	such as movies, televisions, and cartoons."
15	And then it says, "Support Cited. None in a
16	single-spaced 66-page report with 287 footnotes."
17	Now, is that accurate or not?
18	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of question.
19	Object to the exhibit as argumentative and misstating
20	her testimony.
21	BY MR. SURPRENANT
22	Q. Okay. Now, either that -- either this --
23	this exhibit which I've marked correctly states the
24	facts surrounding scholarly support cited in your report
1	or it doesn't. And -- and so tell me where that
2	scholarly support is cited, if there is any in there.
3	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: Can -- please repeat the
5	question.
6	BY MR. SURPRENANT
7	Q. Right. There was a couple of typos in the
8	definition, so I should strike the first "of" and the
9	"is" in the second sentence should be small case I.
10	But on the left is a quote out of your
11	report, Page -- Page 2 and 3. It's the quote from
12	Paragraph C2. And there's no -- there's no support
13	cited. There's 287 footnotes in the report, but there's
14	not a footnote there saying in effect, "Here are
15	scholarly sources that support my use of the term
16	'public awareness' as I have defined it."
17	I am correct, am I not, that in your report,
18	there is no scholarly support cited for how you have
19	defined the term "public awareness"?
20	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
21	question.
22	THE WITNESS: There is no footnote for that
23	particular cite -- cita -- or for that particular
24	sentences that you have -- have cited here.
1	Again, this is a concept -- I'll repeat what
2	I've said several times. This is a concept that is
3	familiar to social historians. I as one use it all the
4	time in my teaching and my scholarship.
5	BY MR. SURPRENANT
6	Q. Okay. Can -- have you looked and seen if
7	your scholarship, you've ever used "public awareness,"
8	that -- that precise term? Not the concept. I
9	understand the concept. And I understand why a social
10	historian would find the concept useful. I'm not
11	arguing with the concept.
12	What I'm arguing is the critical risk that is
13	going to flatly mislead the jury and that is intended by
14	the tobacco lawyers to mislead the jury.
15	So what I want to know is in your published
16	scholarly writing, have you ever used the term "public
17	awareness" as you have def -- as it was used, as it was
18	defined by the tobacco lawyers in your report?
19	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
20	question. It's argumentative. It's been asked and
21	answered. Move to strike the preamble to the question
22	with respect to any motivations by any lawyers
23	representing any party in this case.
24	MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. Let me strike that
1	question and ask a fresh one.
2	BY MR. SURPRENANT
3	Q. Have you ever used -- can you -- strike that.
4	Can you identify anywhere in your published
5	scholarship where you have defined the term "public
6	awareness" in the way that you have used it in -- as the
7	way it was written by the lawyers for Philip Morris when
8	they gave you the research questions?
9	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
10	question.
11	THE WITNESS: There's so much in your
12	question that I disagree with and I think I've made
13	clear, which makes me hesitate to answer your question
14	as a simple yes/no.
15	BY MR. SURPRENANT
16	Q. Okay. I'll strike the question then. Let me
17	start again.
18	The lawyers for Philip Morris wrote the
19	research questions you've answered, correct?
20	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
21	THE WITNESS: No.
22	BY MR. SURPRENANT
23	Q. They told you the research questions they
24	want -- wanted you to answer, correct?
1	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
2	THE WITNESS: They charged me, as I have
3	said, with seeking out the question of public awareness,
4	what citizens of Missouri knew regarding light
5	cigarettes -- or were aware of. Excuse me. What
6	citizens of Missouri, what information they had access
7	to regarding light cigarettes.
8	BY MR. SURPRENANT
9	Q. Okay. Why didn't you call it -- why didn't
10	you call it "information the public had access to,"
11	since that's what you're talking about? Why did you
12	call it "public awareness," where awareness is commonly
13	and consistently defined to be knowledge?
14	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
15	MR. SURPRENANT: Well, strike that. Strike
16	that.
17	BY MR. SURPRENANT
18	Q. Did you ask -- strike that.
19	Why did you use the term "public awareness"
20	as written for by the tobacco lawyers, when awareness is
21	commonly defined and understood to mean knowledge, and
22	you were not using it in that fashion?
23	MR. SNAPP: Objection to the form. It's
24	argumentative. It's compound. Misstates prior
1	testimony.
2	You can answer.
3	THE WITNESS: I'm very clear how I'm using
4	it. Public awareness, I think, is -- is a term that I
5	use because I think it is understandable, very
6	comprehensible to -- to a jury, to a layperson. Again,
7	I think my definition of it is very clear, what the
8	meaning of "public awareness" is. And I think it's a
9	very accessible term.
10	Again, I, you know, reject and deny your
11	characterization that this was a concept forced upon me,
12	foisted upon me by -- by the attorneys I've worked with
13	in this case.
14	BY MR. SURPRENANT
15	Q. Now, the research question that you answered
16	was posed by the tobacco lawyers, right?
17	MR. SNAPP: Objection to form.
18	THE WITNESS: I was charged with seeking --
19	documenting information regarding the information
20	environment, information that was readily available,
21	again, over a series of years from various sources to
22	the people of Missouri regarding light cigarettes.
23	Again, I think I have said this numerous
24	times. I think it's very clearly stated in my report.
1	I don't know what else to tell you about that. I think
2	I've got a very clear definition there that -- that a
3	layperson could easily understand.
4	BY MR. SURPRENANT
5	Q. Just two minutes ago, you said, "I was
6	charged with what the class knew, what the people in
7	Missouri knew," and then you corrected yourself.
8	Isn't -- isn't that the very risk --
9	A. No.
10	Q. — it's so easy when you're using the term
11	"awareness" to think "knowledge"?
12	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
13	THE WITNESS: No.
14	BY MR. SURPRENANT
15	Q. Okay. Now, with that, have you ever used the
16	term in your published scholarship "public awareness" in
17	the way you've used it in your report, in the way it is
18	used in your report?
19	A. Wait. You changed the question there a bit,
20	I think.
21	Q. Right, because you didn't use it. The
22	tobacco lawyers did. So I'll ask it again.
23	Have you ever used --
24	MR. SNAPP: Objection to all --
1	THE WITNESS: No.
2	MR. SNAPP: -- references to the tobacco
3	lawyers. This is getting -- I'm not sure what you're
4	trying to do here. You keep asking the same question
5	over and over again with insinuations about tobacco
6	lawyers. She's testified repeatedly that she came up
7	with the term.
8	MR. SURPRENANT: No. She didn't. You're
9	making things up. You're making things up.
10	MR. SNAPP: Okay.
11	MR. SURPRENANT: You're just -- you're just
12	making --
13	MR. SNAPP: The transcript reads -- the
14	transcript will tell us what she testified to. She
15	never testified that the tobacco lawyers, as you use
16	that term, told her what to do, dictated what she had to
17	do. To the contrary, she testified that if these
18	questions were in any way inaccurate from a historical
19	method perspective or if they used inaccurate terms, she
20	would have changed them.
21	MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. Let me ask a fresh
22	question. See if we can move on.
23	BY MR. SURPRENANT
24	Q. Have you ever used the phrase "public
1	awareness" in your published scholarship in the fashion
2	it is used in your expert report?
3	A. Again, I would have to go back and reread
4	things that I've written over the years. I'm not sure.
5	I don't think I have, but I, again, have certainly used
6	the concept numerous times.
7	Q. Yes. And I understand that. And the
8	concept, as I said, is a useful one. That's not what
9	I'm worried about.
10	(Exhibit 16, Printout of Webpage, marked.)
11	BY MR. SURPRENANT
12	Q. Let me mark -- I've marked as Exhibit 16
13	somethingfromtheSynonym--Synonym.com. It's a hard
14	word to say.
15	A. Synonym.
16	MR. SNAPP: Synonym.
17	BY MR. SURPRENANT
18	Q. Synonym. My -- my vocabulary vastly exceeds
19	my pronunciation.
20	The definition of "awareness." The noun
21	"awareness" has two senses. One, awareness,
22	consciousness, cognizance, cognisance, knowingness.
23	Having knowledge of.
24	Now, having knowledge of is different than
1	having information available to an observer without
2	regard to whether the observer actually perceived or
3	knew the fact, correct?
4	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
5	THE WITNESS: Again, I think this is a
6	complicated question that you're asking. As I've said,
7	there's a connection, a relationship, between awareness
8	and knowledge, as I've discussed it over the last couple
9	of days.
10	Again, I can tell you as a social historian
11	in this case what information was available to the
12	people of Missouri. What people chose to acknowledge,
13	the cognitive process of knowing something or ignoring
14	it or dismissing it or embracing it, I can't tell you
15	that.
16	And again, I think the distinction I've made
17	is very clear. And I've made that distinction
18	consistently. They are related. They're not one and
19	the same.
20	BY MR. SURPRENANT
21	Q. You just said that awareness does not take
22	into whether the observer accepted or rejected the
23	knowledge. That's not the question.
24	There's -- there's a threshold question.
I	It's not whether the class in Missouri was given --
2	here's information on compensation. You can either
3	accept it or reject it. There's a threshold question,
4	which you cannot answer, whether the class in Missouri
5	ever even perceived that information about compensation,
6	correct?
7	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: Again, I'm not sure what you
9	mean by a threshold question. I guess I'm unclear, and
10	I want to be clear what you mean by that.
II	BY MR. SURPRENANT
12	Q. Okay. I used the example yesterday of my
13	wife and I. We both went to school way longer than
14	probably any human being should. We read two daily
15	newspapers, multiple magazines. I think we're
16	well-informed. And -- and I never had any glimmer of an
17	idea about compensation till I was hired in this case a
18	few months ago.
19	So it would be wrong to say, "You,
20	Mr. Surprenant, did not acknowledge and accept but
21	rejected information about compensation." I never --1
22	never --1 never read it. I never knew about it. I
23	never heard it. That's what we're talking about.
24	How can -- awareness cannot mean that the
1	class, as you have used it -- you have used it to say
2	infor -- strike that.
3	You have defined public awareness in a way
4	that avoids the question of whether any individual
5	member in the class or the class as a whole ever had
6	information about compensation presented to it, correct?
7	MR. SNAPP: Objection to the form of the
8	question.
9	THE WITNESS: Can there -- that's a pretty
10	long question. I can tell you again --1 think I'll
11	just repeat what I've said before. I can tell you what
12	information was available out there over a long period
13	of time, coming from a lot of different sources,
14	repeated and reinforced broadly and deeply disseminated.
15	I cannot tell you what an individual saw or
16	believed. I can't tell you what a group of people saw
17	or believed, but I can tell you the information that was
18	available to them.
19	MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. So I've marked as
20	Exhibit 18 another document that I prepared.
21	(Exhibit 18, All Scholarly Support Professor
22	Greenwood Could Cite at Her Deposition for
23	Her Definition of "Public Awareness,"
24	marked.)
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT
2	Q. It's the same as Exhibit 17, with the same
3	typos unfortunately that I've corrected by hand. And it
4	cited -- the title is All Scholarly Support Professor
5	Greenwood Could Cite at Her Deposition for Her
6	Definition of, quote, "Public Awareness," and it has the
7	same definition from Paragraph C2, Page 2 and 3 of your
8	report. And on the right-hand side is a blank column.
9	"Support cited at deposition."
10	And feel free to -- to -- if you can cite me
11	to any scholarly support that defines the precise term
12	"public awareness" as you have used it, we'll just fill
13	it in here. But -- but I think the answer is going to
14	be that you can't cite any, correct?
15	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
16	question.
17	THE WITNESS: Again, I think as a social
18	historian, as someone who's been trained in social
19	history, this is a deeply embedded fundamental concept
20	that I use in my teaching and my scholarship.
21	BY MR. SURPRENANT
22	Q. Right. But what -- but what I'm looking for
23	is something like, for example, if Professors Tosh and
24	Lang defined the term in The Pursuit of History, "public
1	awareness," as you have used it, then I'd fill in
2	"J. Tosh and S. Lang, The Pursuit of History." So that
3	would be scholarly support for how you've used it.
4	And I'm asking you is there any scholarly
5	support that we can fill in that uses "public awareness"
6	in the way that you have defined it -- in the way it is
7	defined in your expert report?
8	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
9	THE WITNESS: Again, I'll simply repeat what
10	I've said. This is a widely used concept that I have
11	used in my teaching and my scholarship, used regularly
12	by social historians.
13	BY MR. SURPRENANT
14	Q. I understand that, Professor. I understand
15	the concept. I said five minutes ago, I can understand
16	why the concept of information that is widely available
17	to the public and reinforced from multiple sources is a
18	useful concept for social historian. I get that.
19	The problem is you have connected it to a
20	term "public awareness," and so I'm asking not is the --
21	is the concept of information widely known and
22	reinforced within a social community a concept that's
23	used in scholarly social history. I'm sure it is.
24	I'm asking for scholarly support that has
1	used -- that has -- that has used the term "public
2	awareness" to describe that concept.
3	MR. SNAPP: Is there a question?
4	MR. SURPRENANT: Yes.
5	BY MR. SURPRENANT
6	Q. Is there any -- is there anything I can fill
7	in here?
8	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
9	She's -- she's answered this question
10	repeatedly.
11	You can answer again.
12	THE WITNESS: I'll just repeat what I've --
13	I've said before. I use this -- this concept. Social
14	historians use it. At the moment, off the top of my
15	head, I cannot come up with an exact citation for you in
16	footnote form, but this is a concept that I use.
17	BY MR. SURPRENANT
18	Q. Okay. Now, you get to review the transcript
19	for errors. And what I'm going to ask is for the court
20	reporter to put in a blank right here so that in the
21	privacy of your --of your office or your library, if
22	you can find any scholarly support to fill in, I invite
23	you, Professor, to do that when you review the
24	transcript.
1	(Exhibit 19, The Pursuit of History excerpt,
2	marked.)
3	BY MR. SURPRENANT
4	Q. So I've marked the excerpts, The Pursuit of
5	History, that are referenced at Page 81 in Exhibit B to
6	your report, as Exhibit 19.
7	And I've read it. And -- and so could you
8	direct me, because I read it quickly, but I --1 didn't
9	find the term "public awareness" or not really even a
10	good fit for the concept in this excerpt. I'm not a
11	scholar. I'm a lawyer, so maybe I missed it.
12	So could you direct me to where in this
13	excerpt the concept of public awareness -- even though
14	the term is not used, where the concept of public
15	awareness, as you have used it in Paragraph C2 of your
16	report at Pages 2 and 3 is found?
17	A. Okay. I'd just like to refresh my memory on
18	this, so I'm going to have to take some time to look at
19	it.
20	Q. Absolutely. And this is not --
21	MR. SURPRENANT: Why don't we go off the
22	record? There's no reason -- just take as much time as
23	you need.
24	VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is three minutes
1	after 10. We're off the record.
2	(A recess was taken.)
3	VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the record. The
4	time is 10:13.
5	MR. SURPRENANT: Yeah. What I just wanted to
6	say on the record is that Mr. Snapp objected to my use
7	of the word "tobacco lawyers." And I explained in what
8	I think was a cordial off-the-record conversation that I
9	meant no improper insinuations, and if any were
10	perceived, I apologize.
11	I was using it effectively as Professor
12	Weiner uses it in his article "Big Tobacco and the
13	Historians," but I promise I won't use it in the future.
14	I will say "lawyers representing Philip Morris." Okay.
15	MR. SNAPP: Thank you for that. Your off-
16	the-record comments were well-received. My objection
17	was not to the use of the term so much as the perception
18	that it was more of an attack on Dr. Greenwood's
19	integrity in that she didn't do her own work, which she
20	has testified repeatedly that she has done her own work.
21	And as for Dr. Weiner or Mr. Weiner or
22	Weiner, I believe the criticisms of that article were
23	that he was acting as a journalist and his journalism
24	was in fact suspect because he didn't present both sides
1	of the story.
2	So we can talk about that article, but --
3	offline, but I appreciate your off-the-record comments.
4	MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. Just in response, I
5	don't mean to suggest or anything -- any questions I've
6	asked to be in any way a suggestion of lack of integrity
7	on behalf of Professor Greenwood.
8	We --1 think it is critically important that
9	the term "public awareness" was provided to Professor
10	Greenwood by lawyers for Philip Morris, and I am going
11	to rely on that fact in a motion in limine, but you and
12	I can brief that issue in the fullness of time.
13	BY MR. SURPRENANT
14	Q. Okay. Now, The Pursuit of History, did we
15	mark that as Exhibit 18?
16	A. 19.
17	Q. 19. Okay. I read the excerpts, and it's
18	very interesting. I perhaps will at some point in time
19	read the book.
20	But you have now had a break, and so I,
21	Professor -- I'm not a scholar, certainly not a
22	professional historian. I didn't see the concept of
23	public awareness as you've used it clearly set forth
24	here, and perhaps I'm missing it. And if so, where is
1	it set forth?
2	A. I talked about this a little bit yesterday.
3	I think the reason that I included this on my reliance
4	list is because on Page 288, the authors, Tosh and Lang,
5	talk about the issue of mentalitie, which I talked about
6	yesterday as being, you know, related to this notion of
7	public awareness, another way of using the term "public
8	awareness."
9	What I particularly liked about this piece
10	and why I cited it is I think it gets to the heart of
11	what social historians do and what we're charged to do
12	as we work as scholars and as we work as teachers. And
13	that is the often very difficult task of bridging our
14	own, you know, present understandings with the way
15	people, the -- you know, the universe of information
16	that people had in the past, and -- and they're not one
17	and the same.
18	I like this piece because of that
19	explanation, which again is something that I think is
20	central to -- to how I teach and how I approach social
21	history as a scholar. And I can give you a really good
22	example of this, I think, when I teach about slavery
23	because it's extremely difficult in two -- our
24	current-day world, 2010, to understand, for students to
1	understand, for anyone to understand how one person
2	could own another. How can one human being own another
3	human being?
4	So the challenge I have as a professor is to
5	try to get students and aid them in this process, to
6	sketch out sort of the universe of information that
7	people had about slavery.
8	So to do that, I get them and look at again a
9	variety of sources. What kinds of information is being
10	promulgated, is emanated from a variety of sources about
11	African-Americans?
12	I have students look at sermons that were
13	written that talk about blacks suffering under the curse
14	of Ham in the Bible, that they were, you know, cursed by
15	God to be slaves or servants.
16	I have them look at cartoons from a period,
17	other images that depict African-Americans in a negative
18	light. I would have them look at what slaveholders are
19	saying; the slaveholder trade magazines which actually
20	existed, which talked about how to be a good master,
21	gives a good sense of how slaveholders were thinking
22	about slaves.
23	I'd have them look at slaveholders' records
24	which show, you know, this information that people had
1	regarding, you know, looking at black people as
2	commodities, people to be bought and sold.
3	And so by that method then -- also, I should
4	say, you know, have them look at, you know, abolitionist
5	writings, what they're saying.
6	Again, so this -- these kinds of
7	information --or memoirs, the narrative of Frederick
8	Douglass you brought up yesterday is a great example,
9	again, one source of information regarding the nature
10	of -- of black people.
11	So that's a really important teaching tool
12	because it sets out again this whole body of information
13	that, you know, Americans had regarding the nature of
14	African-Americans.
15	Now, you know, can I tell you from that
16	information what, you know, all white Americans thought
17	about black people? No, I can't. But I can give you a
18	sense -- sketch out this universe of information within
19	which people worked. I can give you a sense of, you
20	know, again, the kind of knowledge that they took away
21	from that information.
22	But I can't make a big general statement
23	because again, I think in that particular case, it would
24	be very hard for me to say, you know, what the average
1	white American thought about black people.
2	So that's why I like this piece, going back
3	to this. That's why I like this piece because I think
4	it gives a sense of how this notion of mentalitie and
5	how social historians used it.
6	Q. Do you have them read the Second Inaugural?
7	A. The what?
8	Q. Second Inaugural? Lincoln's?
9	A. Lincoln's Second Inaugural? Yeah. I
10	probably do. I mean, it's after emancipation, but yeah.
11	Students read it.
12	Q. Yeah. He has -- because you reminded -- he
13	has a sentence where he talks that has the phrase -- he
14	essentially suggests that the Civil War is punishment on
15	the white community for the sins of slavery. Frederick
16	Douglass thought it was very impressive.
17	In any event, so let me -- let me -- let me
18	pursue this -- this exhibit because it does have some
19	things that--that I find interesting. Let me go to
20	the page you cited, Page 288, "Getting into the mind of
21	the past."
22	He says, "Dissemination" --
23	A. I'm sorry -- the top of that page. Okay.
24	Q. Yeah. "Dissemination is an important issue."
1	And I -- in context, he means dissemination of
2	information, correct?
3	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
4	THE WITNESS: I'm not sure. I'd have to read
5	what comes before.
6	BY MR. SURPRENANT
7	Q. Okay. What -- what he says is "Dissemination
8	is an important issue, but by itself it is not an
9	adequate framework for the study of popular culture."
10	And -- and -- strike that.
11	What -- what -- in what sense do you believe
12	the professors are using "dissemination" in that
13	sentence? Because you can go back to 287.
14	A. I'll have to look at the previous page.
15	Q. Let me -- let me withdraw that question and
16	go back to the first excerpt, from 103 to 106.
17	There, the professors are talking about --1
18	think it's very clear. They say you have to identify
19	everything. Preferably you want to look at all sources
20	that have a bearing on the problem in hand.
21	Do you agree with that as a social historian?
22	I was reading from Page 103, "Weighing
23	sources against each other."
24	A. Let me just find the sentence.
1	Again, yeah -- you have to read the whole
2	sentence, I think, for that to make sense.
3	Q. Yeah. "The procedure is rather to amass as
4	many pieces of evidence as possible from a wide range of
5	sources -- preferably from all the sources that have a
6	bearing on the problem in hand."
7	Is that the way a social historian should
8	operate? Is that the proper --
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. — practice?
11	Okay. Now, I --1 know you didn't read it,
12	but -- but let me refer you to Exhibit 7, the article by
13	Professor Kyriakoudes.
14	And -- and at the -- his conclusion -- I'm at
15	the last page of the text before the references,
16	sentence on the bottom, beginning with "as." "As a
17	consequence"--
18	A. I'm sorry. What page are we on?
19	Q. The last page of the text, V small Roman 14,
20	114. Under Conclusion. And if you go down to the --
21	the last full sentence on the page, beginning with "As a
22	consequence."
23	And please read whatever you want in context.
24	I'm going to read the text and then ask you a question
1	about your report.
2	"As a consequence of this flawed methodology,
3	defense historians present a history of the cig -- of
4	the cigarette in which the tobacco industry all but
5	ceases to exist as an agent in the history of the rise
6	of the cigarette in American life. The effect is to
7	present a skewed and profoundly ahistorical view of the
8	cigarette divorced from all historical context where
9	scholarship and evidence adverse to the industry's legal
10	theories are ignored. From the testimony of indust --
11	industry historians, one would never understand how it
12	came to be that anyone ever smoked."
13	And -- and so my question to you, Professor,
14	is by -- by not going into TobaccoDocuments.org and by
15	not studying what Philip Morris knew and understood and
16	how it attempted to manipulate popular understanding,
17	the criticism is that -- that the role that Philip
18	Morris played disappears and -- and isn't that the risk
19	that a social historian runs when he or she decides to
20	ignore the documents from one of the principal actors in
21	the controversy?
22	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
23	THE WITNESS: Well, first of all, I think I
24	need to say that I haven't read this article. And I do
1	not feel comfortable commenting on this article,
2	especially — you know, I have no, you know -- having --
3	you having read a couple sentences from the conclusion.
4	I --1 can't comment on this article. I
5	don't know what the evidence is that this professor
6	has -- has amassed. So I just want to make it clear
7	that I'm making no comment about this article. I would
8	not feel comfortable by any means doing that because I
9	haven't read it.
10	BY MR. SURPRENANT
11	Q. That's fine, Professor. I understand.
12	A. Okay. And so that said --
13	Q. Let me just ask --
14	A. I'm not sure what the question was.
15	Q. Let me ask a question independent of that
16	article. Philip Morris is the largest domestic
17	manufacturer of cigarettes, correct?
18	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
19	THE WITNESS: I don't know.
20	BY MR. SURPRENANT
21	Q. Okay. It is one of the principal tobacco
22	companies in the United States, correct?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. And -- and you know that Philip Morris was
1	one of the leaders in the tobacco industry's open
2	question strategy from 1954 to 1999 when the industry
3	spent billions of dollars trying to call into question
4	any connection between smoking, disease and addiction.
5	Doesn't a social historian run an enormous
6	risk of reaching ahistorical conclusions when he or she
7	ignores the evidence of one of the principal actors in
8	the controversy at hand?
9	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
10	question.
11	THE WITNESS: Again, I -- in answering this
12	question, I -- you know, you've given me sort of a long
13	prologue to the question, which I don't agree with or I
14	can't say that I do agree with. I'd have to hear it
15	again.
16	I do not ignore the tobacco industry, as I've
17	explained. Again, my definition of public awareness,
18	again, I think it's very clear what I was charged to do
19	was to document the information that was readily
20	available to the citizens of Missouri regarding light
21	cigarettes and broadly, deeply disseminated, reinforced
22	and reiterated over a long period of time.
23	That public information -- in that public
24	information, I did find, and I do reference that, Philip
1	Morris spokesmen, tobacco industry, in my report. I
2	don't ignore it. Clearly my charge was again to look at
3	this public -- publicly accessible, readily accessible
4	information that is the basis of public awareness.
5	BY MR. SURPRENANT
6	Q. Professor Greenwood, is it your professional
7	conclusion that devoting eight sentences in a 66-page
8	single-spaced report to the efforts of the tobacco
9	industry to call into question the link between smoking
10	on the one hand and disease and addiction on the other
11	is a balanced portrayal of the tobacco industry's
12	participation in the health controversy of this century?
13	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
14	question.
15	THE WITNESS: Again, I want to reiterate what
16	my specific charge was. It was looking at the issue
17	of -- again, the inf or -- readily available information
18	regarding light cigarettes. And I did include, you
19	know, that information, comments regarding, for example,
20	the FTC method that the tobacco industry made in 1967
21	and subsequently. Comments that the tobacco industry
22	said regarding, you know, some studies that came out
23	about light cigarettes and health consequences. I
24	included them and saw them, again, within the larger
1	context of -- of public information.
2	BY MR. SURPRENANT
3	Q. I appreciate that, but my question is more
4	precise.
5	Do you -- is it your professional conclusion
6	that eight sentences out of a 66-page single-spaced
7	report discussing the efforts of the tobacco industry to
8	call into question the link between smoking on the one
9	hand and disease and addiction on the other is a
10	balanced portrayal of the tobacco industry's
11	participation in the controversy surrounding smoking?
12	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
13	question. And I also object to any indication that her
14	testimony focuses on the tobacco industry's
15	participation in the controversy surrounding smoking.
16	She's testified what her opinions deal with, and they
17	are not the tobacco industry's participation in the
18	controversy surrounding smoking.
19	MR. SURPRENANT: Mr. Snapp, I rarely
20	reformulate questions in response to objections, but I'm
21	going to make an exception to my practice, and I'll
22	state with greater precision, being edified by your
23	objection.
24
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT
2	Q. Do you think, Professor -- is it your
3	professional conclusion that eight sentences in a
4	66-page single-spaced report is a balanced portrayal of
5	how the tobacco industry attempted to influence what the
6	public understood about the link between smoking on the
7	one hand and illness and addiction on the other?
8	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form. The same
9	comment applies to this question. She has not testified
10	that her testimony or her opinions address the tobacco
11	industry's attempts to influence anything.
12	But you can answer.
13	BY MR. SURPRENANT
14	Q. I'll ask another question. Most of this --
15	most of this report discusses how the -- how -- what
16	information was available to the public as a general
17	matter on the risk of smoking and more specifically on
18	the risk of smoking light cigarettes versus regular
19	cigarettes.
20	Isn't that in the report?
21	A. I don't agree with your characterization of
22	the report. Again, I focus, as I was charged to do, on
23	the question of information available to citizens of
24	Missouri regarding light cigarettes. That was my
1	charge. That was what I researched.
2	Q. Okay.
3	A. And I did include the tobacco industry's
4	comments and statements regarding light cigarettes on
5	key issues as they pointed out, such as the FTC method,
6	on some scientific studies regarding light cigarettes.
7	That voice is there.
8	Q. Is that a fair and balanced portrayal of the
9	voice? Eight sentences in a 66-page report?
10	A. I would have--
11	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
12	Go ahead.
13	THE WITNESS: I would have to go back and see
14	whether it's eight sentences. I don't know if that's
15	the case.
16	I know that I certainly incorporated that
17	voice. It was, you know -- as I mentioned, went over a
18	number of times yesterday, it was one voice in a
19	universe of information. It's a voice that does not get
20	repeated, reiterated, reinforced from other sources. So
21	I feel very strongly that my documentation of the
22	tobacco industry, Tobacco Institute, tobacco industry
23	spokespeople, is fair. Again, within -- as viewed
24	within the larger context of available --
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT
2	Q. Now, wouldn't --
3	A. May I finish?
4	Q. Sure.
5	A. -- of available information.
6	Q. Now, wouldn't -- wouldn't there be objective
7	criteria that one could bring to bear in measuring
8	voice? For example, the amount of money that was spent
9	by big tobacco to call into question whether there was
10	any ill effects from smoking regular cigarettes or light
11	cigarettes versus the amount of money that was spent to
12	convey the contrary method -- message?
13	MR. SNAPP: Object-
14	BY MR. SURPRENANT
15	Q. One could look at that, those -- those
16	metrics, correct?
17	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form. It's a
18	compound question.
19	THE WITNESS: Again, I - yeah. That's a
20	compound question. I'm not sure exactly what you're
21	asking. If you could, simplify --
22	BY MR. SURPRENANT
23	Q. Sure.
24	A. -- that for me, please.
1	Q. Sure. You minimize the voice of the tobacco
2	industry because you say it was only one voice and it
3	wasn't echoed and picked up.
4	Couldn't you as a social historian attempt to
5	say how much money did the tobacco industry spend trying
6	to undermine the message that there were any health
7	effects from smoking versus how much money was spent
8	conveying the message that smoking did cause health
9	issues?
10	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
11	Mischaracterizes her prior testimony.
12	THE WITNESS: I don't agree with your premise
13	that I miss --or "minimized" is your word -- the
14	tobacco industry's voice in this document. As I've said
15	before, I've given you some good examples of how I've --
16	I've included, incorporated that voice.
17	The second part of your question, as I
18	understand it, is related to could I measure the impact
19	in terms of amount of money spent? That would be --1
20	honestly don't know if that's possible. It's certainly
21	beyond my expertise as a social historian. It seems to
22	me that you would need to speak to a marketing expert, a
23	consumer -- consumer behaviorist, again, someone who
24	deals with perceptions, again, which is -- is beyond
1	my -- my expertise.
2	BY MR. SURPRENANT
3	Q. In determining whether the tobacco industry's
4	voice had an effect on public understanding, wouldn't a
5	social historian want to look at how much money was
6	spent supporting the "no health effect" message versus
7	the "health effect" message?
8	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form. Asked and
9	answered.
10	THE WITNESS: Again, my charge was specific
11	to look at the issue of public awareness regarding light
12	cigarettes. I think -- again, I'll just repeat what I
13	said before. I think when you're talking about effect,
14	you're talking about impact, you're talking about
15	perception, you're talking about what people take away
16	from an ad or a statement. Again, I think that is
17	beyond my expertise and not what I was charged to do as
18	the expert in this case.
19	MR. SURPRENANT: What I've written and I'm
20	going to mark as the next exhibit -- which I think is
21	19?
22	MR. SNAPP: It's 20,1 think.
23	MR. SURPRENANT: 20. I'm out of stickers.
24	Thank you.
1	God, these are nice stickers. My second
2	daughter, Alexandra, loved stickers when she was
3	younger. And I once brought home a bunch of deposition
4	stickers, and she thought they were so lame.
5	THE WITNESS: Not as much fun as unicorns and
6	balloons and things like that.
7	MR. SURPRENANT: Yes. That's exactly her
8	point of view.
9	21?
10	MR. SNAPP: 20.
11	THE WITNESS: 20.
12	MR. SURPRENANT: Huh?
13	MR. SNAPP: 20.
14	(Exhibit 20, Handwritten notes, marked.)
15	BY MR. SURPRENANT
16	Q. Okay. Now, what I wrote on Exhibit -- what
17	I've marked as Exhibit 22 -- I'm just trying to
18	understand an implication of your testimony. And let
19	me -- let me first do it without regard to the
20	demonstrative, and then I'll try to use it.
21	If -- as a matter of logic, if a consumer was
22	convinced by the tobacco industry, the Tobacco
23	Institute, the individual efforts of the individual
24	tobacco companies, that cigarettes did not -- regular
1	cigarettes did not cause ill effects on health and was
2	not addictive, if a consumer believed that from 1971
3	through 1999, as a matter of logic, the consumer would
4	have to believe that Marlboro Lights did not cause ill
5	health effects or addiction, just as a matter of logic,
6	correct?
7	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
8	question.
9	THE WITNESS: I - I don't feel comfortable
10	with your -- with your characterization, and I don't
11	think I can make that connection as a matter of logic.
12	BY MR. SURPRENANT
13	Q. Okay. Well, then now -- now let me mark as
14	Exhibit 22 —
15	MR. SNAPP: I think it was actually 20. The
16	next one was 20.
17	MR. SURPRENANT: Well, you - I write
18	whatever you tell me. Mr. Snapp, I'm just the most
19	compliant person. Whatever you tell me to do, I do.
20	BY MR. SURPRENANT
21	Q. Okay. Exhibit 20, it says on the left-hand,
22	"No cigarette causes ill health effects or addiction."
23	On the right-hand, it says, "Marlboro Lights do not
24	cause ill health effects or addiction." And in the
1	middle is a bracketed arrow, and in the middle of the
2	bracket, it says, "Must necessarily mean, if true."
3	So the logical proposition I'm trying to
4	illustrate is that --
5	MR. SNAPP: Can I take a look at that?
6	MR. SURPRENANT: Sure.
7	BY MR. SURPRENANT
8	Q. -- is that as a matter of logic, if an
9	individual -- if an individual believes no cigarette
10	causes ill health effects or addiction, that individual
11	as a matter of logic must necessarily conclude that
12	Marlboro Lights do not cause ill health effects or
13	addiction, correct?
14	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
15	THE WITNESS: Again, I think I've - I've
16	answered this question. I again don't feel comfortable
17	commenting as an expert on, you know, this kind of
18	logical -- or your argument that this is a logical --
19	that one thing follows logically from the other.
20	What I can tell you, again as someone who
21	deals with evidence as a social historian and as someone
22	who has, you know, spent quite a bit of time researching
23	these questions is that the overwhelming message that
24	emanated from a variety of sources, really from the
1	1950s forward, is that no cigarette is safe. That
2	message grows stronger over time. I can tell you that.
3	And I'm comfortable making that statement.
4	This, I am not quite --1 don't quite know
5	where you're going with it.
6	MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. Move to strike
7	everything after "what I can tell you."
8	Let's go back to your report --
9	MR. SNAPP: Object to the motion to strike.
10	BY MR. SURPRENANT
11	Q. Let's go back to your report, and I'm not
12	going to go through all the sources, but I just want to
13	go through perhaps, you know, Footnotes 4, 5, 6.
14	The report -- I'm going to go through the
15	footnotes in Paragraph -- in just Roman I. I'm not
16	going to go through all of them. And to orient the
17	examination, I'm going to be questioning whether it is
18	reasonable to believe the cited sources actually played
19	any role in -- in the class's understanding.
20	And yesterday, I had examination on
21	Footnotes -- the sources in Footnotes 2 and 3. I won't
22	repeat that.
23	In Footnote 4, we have a citation to an
24	article on Page 2 of an April 13, 1957 article in the
1	St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
2	Now, let's say a smoker was my age, for
3	example, 54. At the time that article came out, the
4	smoker would have been two years old. Is it --1 wasn't
5	reading when I was two years old. Is it -- is it
6	reasonable to believe that -- that this article was
7	actually read and understood by -- by a member of the
8	class who -- who is today 54?
9	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form. She's
10	testified that she's not talking in her opinions about
11	what any class member believed, but you can answer.
12	THE WITNESS: Again, I think you need to
13	understand this section of my report in context. And I
14	think you're mischaracterizing the purpose of it.
15	In many ways, these questions that you're
16	focusing on, the footnotes that you're focusing on in
17	Section 1 are really just sort of background information
18	regarding, again, public awareness about the dangers
19	of -- of cigarettes and the very early focus by public
20	health authorities as well as the federal government and
21	the Surgeon General to think and to promote -- to think
22	about, promote, to begin to research what they refer to
23	as a safer cigarette.
24	That's the point of me citing this evidence
1	in this report, that this is an old idea relatively
2	speaking. The notion of a safer cigarette that, you
3	know, you might be able to filter out the toxic elements
4	in tobacco smoke that were related to disease, again,
5	based on this notion of tobacco being -- smoking being
6	dose-responsive, going back to those early 1950s
7	experiments in St. Louis that again seemed to capture
8	the interest of the citizens of St. Louis and Missouri
9	because they were at the center of these -- this
10	research.
11	This is just simply showing that, you know,
12	this -- there was -- there's a deep history to the
13	notion of trying to develop a safer cigarette.
14	MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. Move to strike,
15	nonresponsive.
16	MR. SNAPP: Objection to the move -- motion
17	to strike. It was responsive to the question.
18	BY MR. SURPRENANT
19	Q. Do you recall if you were provided the
20	citations in Footnote 4 by attorneys or paralegals
21	working on behalf of Philip Morris?
22	A. No. I --1 asked -- this is information
23	that, again, that I had -- research I had done myself.
24	I knew there were articles out there about safer
1	cigarettes, and I asked -- particularly around these
2	dates, many of these dates related to, as you can see if
3	you read the paragraphs above them, Congressional
4	testimony.
5	I probably asked my research assistant in
6	Missouri to collect this information for me in -- in the
7	St. Louis paper. The Washington paper and the Times
8	that are cited, I would have gotten online.
9	Q. Okay. If I could direct your attention to
10	Footnote -- to the next -- to Page 6, Paragraph 5, this
11	is, by my count, one of the eight sentences in the
12	report that discusses the tobacco industry's efforts to
13	affect public -- public understanding of the health
14	issues around tobacco.
15	And it says newspapers -- after discussing
16	the widely publicized report in November 1959, then at
17	the -- at the end of the paragraph, it describes the
18	response from the tobacco companies. Quote:
19	"Newspapers also included a response from the Tobacco
20	Institute that claimed Surgeon General Burney's
21	assertions were not new, end quote, not supported by
22	experimental evidence."
23	My -- my question, Professor, is for
24	virtually every paragraph in your report through 1999,1
1	could identify a similar attempt, a similar voice of the
2	Tobacco Institute or other spokesman for the tobacco
3	industry trying to call into question all of the
4	information you cite.
5	My question is: Why didn't you uniformly
6	include the tobacco industry's response and just did it
7	in the -- in the citations that I marked as an exhibit
8	yesterday?
9	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
10	THE WITNESS: Again, I think maybe there's
11	some misunderstanding again about what my charge was
12	here. I did cite tobacco industry responses relating to
13	light cigarettes. You know, again, I --1 feel very
14	confident in my research on this that I was thorough
15	and -- and you know, weighed my -- my sources
16	accordingly and, you know, carefully read through the
17	evidence that I had.
18	And I included the tobacco industry's
19	statements regarding light cigarettes as they appeared,
20	again, in publicly disseminated information.
21	BY MR. SURPRENANT
22	Q. Marlboro Lights were introduced in 1971,
23	correct?
24	A. Yes.
1	Q. And all the information about -- about
2	lowered tar and nicotine that you cite prior to that
3	doesn't deal with light cigarettes, correct? It deals
4	with either going from an unfiltered cigarette to a
5	filtered cigarette or a very high-tar and nicotine
6	cigarette to one that would not classify as a light
7	cigarette, correct?
8	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
9	THE WITNESS: I think there are references --
10	again, I'd have to go back and look exactly -- to
11	certainly lower tar cigarettes absolutely going back
12	much earlier than 1971 to safer cigarettes to filtration
13	systems.
14	Certainly in 1967 when the FTC listings come
15	out that measured tar and nicotine content by the FTC
16	method, newspapers often referred to low-tar or
17	low-yield cigarettes.
18	THE WITNESS: I'm afraid I'm going to have to
19	take another break, if that's okay.
20	MR. SURPRENANT: Why don't we do that,
21	Professor? And I'm getting near--I'm going to have a
22	handful of questions, and we'll be done.
23	THE WITNESS: Okay. Thank you.
24	VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 10:52. We're off
1	the record.
2	(A recess was taken.)
3	VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record.
4	This is Tape No. 2. The time is 8 minutes after 11.
5	BY MR. SURPRENANT
6	Q. We live in an uncertain universe, Professor.
7	I just promised you I will be done as soon as I can,
8	before -- as close to 11:30 as possible. Let's see if
9	that's the case.
10	Okay. Page 16 of your report, Paragraph 8.
11	In 1978, DHEW -- is that Department of Health, Education
12	and Welfare?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. In 1978, DHEW Secretary Joseph Califano,
15	declaring cigarette smoking Public Health Enemy No. 1
16	and slow-motion suicide, also proposed a graduated tax
17	on cigarettes according to nicotine, tar and carbon
18	monoxide content.
19	You know, I withdraw the question.
20	* I'll go to Page 20. Paragraph 10, Page 20, first
21	sentence. "Throughout the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s,
22	FTC reports on tar and nicotine content and annual
23	rankings in the newspapers regularly stressed that the
24	lower the tar and nicotine, the better for the smoker."
1	Would it have any implication for any expert
2	conclusion you have reached, Professor, if at least from
3	the mid-1970s, Philip Morris knew that as a practical
4	matter, that sentence was false and that low-tar
5	cigarettes were just as dangerous as regular cigarettes?
6	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form. Assumes
7	facts not in evidence. Calls for speculation. It's
8	also compound.
9	MR. SURPRENANT: Other than that, it's a
10	sterling question.
11	Could you please reread it for the -- for the
12	witness?
13	* (Question read.)
14	MR. SNAPP: Same objections.
15	THE WITNESS: Again, I don't know what Philip
16	Morris knew at this time. Again, I can respond based on
17	the information that I know, the evidence that was out
18	there is that this is the message, the less tar, the
19	better, that was continually repeated, continually
20	reinforced, stated over and over again in a -- by a
21	variety of sources, in a variety of sources, from the
22	1950s forward.
23	BY MR. SURPRENANT
24	Q. Do you know who Judge Kessler is?
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. Who is Judge Kessler?
3	A. She's a federal judge who has ruled on some
4	cases regarding light cigarettes. That's about all I
5	know about her.
6	Q. And do you know that she published a several-
7	hundred-page-long opinion on -- after a nine-month trial
8	on -- on health issues around tobacco?
9	A. That case and her decision was certainly
10	publicized in the press, so I know it through that. I
11	haven't read the 700 pages.
12	Q. More recently, the -- the way it works in the
13	federal system is you have a district court, and then
14	the appeal goes up to the court of appeal. And there's,
15	I think, 11 circuits. And an appeal from the DC
16	district court goes up to the court of appeals for the
17	DC circuit.
18	And more recently, the court of appeals
19	affirmed Judge Kessler's opinion. Did that receive
20	public attention?
21	MR. SNAPP: Objection to the form.
22	THE WITNESS: Yes. I believe it was in the
23	newspapers and on television news. Yes.
24
1	BY MR. SURPRENANT
2	Q. And one of the things Judge Kessler found is
3	that the defendants in that case, including Philip
4	Morris, violated the civil Racketeer-Influenced and
5	Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, by fraudulently or
6	deceptively marketing light cigarettes.
7	Was that reported in the -- in the press?
8	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
9	THE WITNESS: Judge Kessler's decision was
10	certainly reported in the press. Yes.
11	BY MR. SURPRENANT
12	Q. Okay. I am actually skipping some of these
13	because I think they would just lead to a series of
14	repetitive questions and answers, but let me go to
15	Page 30, Paragraph 7. I just have a terminology
16	question.
17	You say in Paragraph 7, "A 1966 study,
18	publicized in several Missouri newspapers, showed that
19	smokers of some filtered tip cigarettes actually inhaled
20	more tar and nicotine than those who smoked filtered
21	cigarettes."
22	I'm just confused. What is -- what is filter
23	tip -- how is that different than filtered, filtered
24	brands?
1	A. I'd better read this a second. Just give me
2	a few -- a minute.
3	I need to go back and look at it. That may
4	be a typo. It may be non-filtered brands. I mean,
5	that's what it seems to be, according to the -- the rest
6	of that paragraph.
7	Q. Okay.
8	A. But if I could --1 could double-check that
9	for you. I'd be happy to do that.
10	Q. Yeah. I--yeah. I just wasn't following
11	the terminology.
12	A. Yeah. I think that may be a -- and there is
13	another typo in that sentence, too, that I see.
14	Q. You know, the funny thing is the typos go
15	into documents after you finish them. They weren't in
16	there before.
17	A. They do. It's a strange thing.
18	Q. It's a virus.
19	MS. BERNSTEIN-GAETA: I agree.
20	BY MR. SURPRENANT
21	Q. Okay. Page -- okay. What I'm going to --
22	okay. Strike that.
23	Let me just go to Page 40, Paragraph 30.
24	And -- and I'm going to -- I'm going to -- strike that.
1	Let me just ask questions.
2	Paragraph 30, Page 40 of your report cites a
3	magazine called Current Health in March of 1984 titled
4	"The Light Cigarette Hoax." So what's going on here in
5	sum or substance is that a health magazine in 1984 is
6	kind of trying to call out that light cigarettes is a
7	hoax and it's not really any safer. Correct?
8	A. Well, I think if you read the direct quote
9	from that article, it's a bit more complicated than
10	that. Again, I think, you know, what they're
11	referencing here -- and they even use the Surgeon
12	General's term about nullifying the intent of low-tar
13	cigarettes.
14	They're talking about compensation, you know.
15	Again, smoking, as they say here -- and if I may quote
16	directly from the article, as I've -- I've cited it in
17	my report, "Smoking lower tar and nicotine is not the
18	answer. One can get more tar and nicotine from these
19	'low,'" in quotes, "cigarettes by inhaling the smoke
20	more deeply, by holding it in the lungs longer or by
21	increasing the number of cigarettes smoked."
22	And then it goes on to use the term,
23	"Smokers' habits often nullify the intent of low-tar
24	cigarettes."
1	And again, this come three years after the
2	Surgeon General's warning in 1981. So this is sort of
3	getting that same warning out from the Surgeon General
4	in a -- in a popular health magazine.
5	Q. But what is the hoax?
6	A. I think, as they're saying here, the hoax is
7	the sense that, you know, you can -- that -- that these
8	cigarettes are somehow safe, and the -- the hoax seems
9	to be the impression that you can smoke as many of these
10	as you want, that that -- that seems to be what some
11	light smokers believe and -- and they'll be safe.
12	And again, they're just -- the magazine is
13	simply really reiterating what the Surgeon General said
14	about low-tar and nicotine cigarettes.
15	Again, the hoax --1 think if you continue
16	down in that particular paragraph, where they again
17	reference, "Numerous studies have shown that when
18	nicotine content is lower, smokers take more puffs.
19	They smoke more to compensate, feeling this low-tar and
20	nicotine cigarette is so safe, it is okay to smoke more.
21	Again, that's the hoax. Nothing could be further from
22	the truth. The truth is there is no safe form of
23	tobacco."
24	Again, repeating in sort of more layman's
1	terms, I suppose you could say, what the Surgeon General
2	said in 1981.
3	Q. Okay. Let's turn to Page 45. And that is a
4	runover paragraph. Paragraph 42 starts on Page 44, and
5	then it runs over to Page 45.
6	A. Yeah. Okay.
7	Q. And this is dated August of 1983. And the --
8	I'll quote after the block indent.
9	"The article concluded," internal quote,
10	"'The widely touted notion that low-tar and nicotine
11	cigarettes are safer than the -- than stronger brands is
12	a pipe dream.'"
13	And so what was out there in the public as
14	late as -- as August of 1983 was that it was widely
15	touted that lowered tar and nicotine was safer, correct?
16	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
17	THE WITNESS: Again, this quote is, you know,
18	directly from--from Newsweek actually, right? August
19	of 1983. The notion that low -- less tar is better is
20	certainly out there and was, you know, widely touted.
21	But again, as I've mentioned numerous times
22	over the last couple of days, that assertion was almost
23	always accompanied by the caveat that smokers should not
24	change their behavior, their smoking behavior, modify
1	their smoking behavior.
2	Again, if you look above the direct quote
3	from the magazine in that paragraph that you've just
4	cited, it talks about specifically Dr. Benowitz's study
5	and again, the issue of compensation, that a smoker -- a
6	human smoker tends to get the same satisfying level of
7	nicotine he would from a stronger cigarette by smoking
8	more, inhaling more deeply or puffing more frequently.
9	MR. SURPRENANT: Okay. Move to strike
10	everything after "but again" as nonresponsive.
11	MR. SNAPP: Objection to form --to the
12	motion to strike.
13	BY MR. SURPRENANT
14	Q. If we could turn to Page 53, Paragraph 61,
15	you quote Professor Frank Lautenberg?
16	A. Senator Lautenberg.
17	Q. What did I say?
18	A. Professor.
19	Q. You quote Senator Frank Lautenberg in 1988 as
20	stating, "Light cigarettes are a deadly sham."
21	So -- so again what we see here, this is
22	actually during the class period. A elected senator
23	from I believe New Jersey saying, "Look, folks. You
24	need to understand light cigarettes are a deadly sham."
1	Doesn't -- doesn't that indicate to you, and
2	there's going to be more examples even deeper and later
3	in the class period, that the durability and persistence
4	of the notion that light cigarettes are better for you
5	was really marked, and it was like trying to put out a
6	fire.
7	You have it called a hoax in '83. You have
8	it called a pipe dream in eighty -- in '83. And '98,
9	Senator Lautenberg is still trying to put out the fire.
10	Isn't -- strike that.
11	Doesn't these three examples show that there
12	was a real persistence in the public mind, a false
13	persistence, that light cigarettes were better for you?
14	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
15	THE WITNESS: Again, I don't think you can
16	draw that conclusion from the evidence that you've
17	cited. Senator Lautenberg's quote again I think needs
18	to be read in context, as all historical evidence needs
19	to be read in context.
20	He's referring quite specifically to the FTC
21	method and the FTC numbers and is criticizing that, that
22	they are misleading to the public, which, as I point out
23	in my report, actually Tobacco Institute says in 1967,
24	when this was first instituted.
1	So again, I think, you know, your quotes need
2	to be read in context.
3	And what I see again, as a historian looking
4	over this period of time, is a consistency in message,
5	as I've said, that, one, no cigarette is safe. Second,
6	the less tar, the better. And third, if you're going to
7	switch down to a low-tar cigarette, don't modify your
8	smoking behavior.
9	BY MR. SURPRENANT
10	Q. Okay. Let's go -- so -- so you don't -- you
11	would disagree with the analogy, the metaphor that I
12	used, that the -- the hoax, the pipe dream, the deadly
13	sham that light cigarettes were safer was like a fire
14	that just wouldn't go out; you would reject that
15	metaphor based on your reading --
16	A. Yeah. Yeah. I guess I don't --
17	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
18	BY MR. SURPRENANT
19	Q. --based on your reading of the materials?
20	A. I guess I don't quite understand the metaphor
21	and how it fits--
22	Q. It's a wonderful metaphor.
23	A. -- what I'm saying here. Okay. Maybe.
24	Q. I mean, I mean, isn't --1 mean, like let's
1	say if -- if the message that -- the 1983 message, which
2	you cite, that it was a pipe dream, that lower tar and
3	filters -- lower tar and nicotine cigarettes were --
4	were healthier, less risky, if that message had been
5	widely adopted, there would be no need 15 years later
6	for Senator Lautenberg to warn people it's a deadly
7	sham, correct?
8	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
9	THE WITNESS: And I'm not sure what you mean
10	by the message being adopted. Again, it seems to me, is
11	that getting, you know -- getting -- it seems to me
12	that's getting into notions of belief, what people
13	believed.
14	Again, I'm saying that message, there was a
15	very strong message out there before the 1980s, before
16	Senator Lautenberg as well in the -- what year is that?
17	In the nineteen --in 1998 that, you know, no cigarette
18	is safe, and switching down is going to be better --
19	could be better for you, might minimi -- may be able to
20	minimize your risk, but don't modify your smoking
21	behavior. That's not a new message in 1998.
22	BY MR. SURPRENANT
23	Q. Okay. Let's go to Paragraph 78 at Page 60.
24	Now, this is from 60 Minutes II, which is February 2001,
1	relatively late in the class period. And I'll quote:
2	"In February 2001, 60 Minutes II presented a story
3	entitled 'The Low-Tar Myth,' which criticized the FTC
4	method."
5	Internal quote: "'What smokers don't know,'
6	a reporter explained, 'is that the government's low-tar
7	number on the pack has almost nothing to do with how
8	much tar they're inhaling. It only tells you how much
9	tar is being delivered to a smoking machine, not to real
10	smokers.'"
11	So there, we have a television report late in
12	the class period saying low tar is a myth and that
13	smokers don't know it. That is another example, is it
14	not, of the persistence in the public mind, the false
15	persistence, that lower tar and nicotine cigarettes were
16	healthier?
17	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
18	THE WITNESS: Again, I think as you've
19	pointed out, this is one journalist's opinion regarding
20	this low-tar myth.
21	Again, I think I've provided lots of
22	documentation with my charge as the expert in this case
23	being to document the information that was readily
24	available to citizens of Missouri regarding light
1	cigarettes. This is not a new message in 2001. And
2	again, I think my report provides that evidence, and I
3	document that.
4	BY MR. SURPRENANT
5	Q. Okay. I'm going to have one more example and
6	then -- and then try to sort through it, and then we'll
7	be done.
8	If you could, go to Page 64, Paragraph 90.
9	Quote: "In July 2008, national news broadcasts and
10	national newspapers reported the FTC's decision to
11	rescind its endorsement of the FTC method of measuring
12	the tar and nicotine content of cigarettes. CBS's Katie
13	Couric explained, Tonight, the label -- the labels say
14	low tar, but a government agency says the claim smokers
15	have trusted for years doesn't mean a thing.'"
16	This is yet another example from your report,
17	is it not, where the public message is that as late as
18	2008, it is saying smokers trusted the fact that lowered
19	tar and nicotine was healthier and it's false?
20	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
21	THE WITNESS: What was the question? Is
22	there a question?
23	BY MR. SURPRENANT
24	Q. Yeah. Let me reread it.
1	Paragraph 90, the quote I just read, is yet
2	another example of where the message is as late as 2008,
3	that consumers mistakenly trusted the notion that
4	lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes were safer.
5	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
6	THE WITNESS: Again, I heard a statement.
7	I'm not sure I heard a question.
8	BY MR. SURPRENANT
9	Q. The question --
10	A. I'm sorry if I missed it.
11	Q. Let me -- let me -- the quote from
12	Paragraph 90, from Katie Couric, that a government
13	agency says that the claim smokers have trusted for
14	years doesn't mean a thing is yet another example from
15	your report, very late after the class period, that --
16	that what people actually believed and trusted, i.e.,
17	lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes were healthier,
18	continued to persist, correct?
19	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
20	THE WITNESS: Again, I cannot tell you as a
21	social historian in this case what people believed. I
22	do know, however, that the FTC method was criticized
23	from its very inception, not only by the tobacco
24	industry from 1967 forward, but by organizations such as
1	Consumer Reports, Reader's Digests, health organizations
2	warned smokers that the amount of tar and nicotine that
3	they ingested may not really be reflected in the numbers
4	because people don't smoke like machines smoke.
5	Again, there's lots of information out there,
6	and you know, that's what I can testify to regarding
7	issues and problems about the FTC method.
8	BY MR. SURPRENANT
9	Q. Well, let's have kind of a discussion of
10	history. I've just cited materials from 1983 through
11	2008, 25-year period, where time after time, there are
12	emphatic public statements that either expressly or
13	implicitly say two things. The public is being deceived
14	by the persistent notion -- strike that. Let me -- let
15	me restate the question.
16	I've just gone over 25 years of examples
17	where the concept, the notion, that lowered tar and
18	nicotine cigarettes were less risky was called a pipe
19	dream, a hoax, a deadly sham, a low-tar -- a myth. And
20	as late as 2008, it's called, you know, a claim smokers
21	have trusted for years which is false.
22	Doesn't that show that there is a persistence
23	in the public mind of the low-tar myth and that the
24	fact -- the fact that information was available that
1	said it was a myth did not make the myth go away?
2	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form of the
3	question.
4	THE WITNESS: Again, I cannot tell you as a
5	social historian in this case what -- how people
6	perceived the message, what their perceptions were. I
7	can tell you, again as I have on several occasions now,
8	what information was out there regarding low-tar
9	cigarettes.
10	And again, I think there is a message from
11	very early on, preceding this class period, certainly
12	continuing through it, that there's no safe -- there's
13	no such thing as a safe cigarette. Less tar is better.
14	If you can't quit smoking or you won't quit smoking,
15	switch down, but do not modify your smoking behavior.
16	Those messages are out there. Again, I can't
17	tell you about, as an expert, the public perceptions of
18	those message -- messages, the public belief. Again,
19	that's in the area of cognition. I can tell you, as
20	I've said, what messages were out there, which I think
21	I've documented quite extensively in this report.
22	BY MR. SURPRENANT
23	Q. Okay. So let's talk about one strand,
24	Professor, of the messages that were out there. One
1	strand of the messages that were out there as late as
2	2008 is that there was a persistent public
3	understanding, which was false, that lowered tar and
4	nicotine cigarettes were safer. That's one of the
5	strands of the message that was out there that is
6	identified quite clearly in your report, correct?
7	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
8	THE WITNESS: No, I don't think that's
9	exactly what I'm saying or what I've said in this
10	report. I've related Katie Couric's, you know,
11	quotation regarding low-tar cigarettes. I don't know
12	where Katie Couric got that information. I don't know
13	what she's basing it on. I don't know what foundation
14	she has for asserting this particular belief. It's
15	reported out there as such, again as part of public
16	information that's readily available, and that's how I
17	have -- have used it in this particular report.
18	BY MR. SURPRENANT
19	Q. Let me just ask one final -- address one
20	final topic, and then we'll be done, Professor, and
21	thank you for your patience.
22	* One of the issues in this case which you address is
23	what was publicly available information on the relative
24	delivery and health risk of light cigarettes versus
1	regular cigarettes. And that's a topic that is addressed
2	in your report, correct?
3	A. Could you please repeat that? I want to make
4	sure I understood what you said --
5	MR. SURPRENANT: Ms. Reporter--
6	THE WITNESS: --in terms of characterizing
7	my report.
8	* (Question read.)
9	THE WITNESS: Again, if I could ask for a
10	little clarification, what do you mean by "delivery"?
11	Again, I think that's a kind of a technical term. I
12	want to make sure we're on the same page.
13	BY MR. SURPRENANT
14	Q. That's fine, Professor. Let me withdraw the
15	question. Try to get at it differently.
16	When you became aware that Judge Kessler had
17	found, among other things, that Philip Morris in concert
18	with other tobacco companies had misleadingly marketed
19	Marlboro Lights, did you think that it would be useful
20	for you to closely read those sections of her decision
21	to see if it might cast any light on your research
22	assignment?
23	MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.
24	THE WITNESS: No, because I think -- again, I
1	think my charge was quite specific as an expert witness
2	in this case. Again, I was asked to research, you know,
3	the messages that were information available to citizens
4	in Missouri regarding light cigarettes.
5	And you know, again, certainly Judge
6	Kessler's -- reports of Judge Kessler's decision were in
7	the newspapers and magazines and television reports and
8	things like that. And I, you know, certainly dealt with
9	that -- with that information as it was publicly
10	disseminated, as was my charge in this case.
11	MR. SURPRENANT: Okay, Professor. Thank you
12	for your patience. And I have no further questions at
13	the time -- at this time, and the deposition is over
14	unless Philip Morris's lawyers wish to examine you.
15	MR. SNAPP: We have no questions.
16	VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 11:39. We are off
17	the record.
