CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. PAIGE:
10 Q. Please state your full name.
11 A. Lacy Ford.
12 Q. Dr. Ford, my name is Gary Paige.
We met
13 briefly, and I'm sure you understand I'm going to ask
14 you some questions.
15 confusion from the video conference, please let me
16 know, okay?
17 A. Thank you.
18 Q. All right.
If there's any delay or
19
In this case you were retained
by Jones Day?
20 A. Yes; that's correct.
21 Q. And you understand that they represent
22
R.J. Reynolds?
23 A. Yes, I do.
24 Q. And how many times have you been retained
25
by lawyers representing R.J. Reynolds in the past, do
5
1
2
you know?
A.
I have testified in approximately ten
3 cases over a period of 14 years, ten or 11 cases.
4 And I've consulted with them on some other cases that
5 didn't end up, you know, actually going to trial for
6 one reason or another.
7 Q. So you've testified in trial ten times?
8 A. Yes; that's correct.
9
10
Ten or 11, I
believe, yes.
Q.
And is that the same amount of times that
Page 411 depo of Lacy Ford
you've testified in deposition, as well, or have you
12 given more depositions?
13
A.
I've given depositions in cases that I did
14 not testify and there were cases I testified and I
15 did not give depositions.
16 depositions I've given is probably, oh, around 12 or
17 13.
18 trial testimony.
19
So I think the number of
One or two more, but not too many more than
Q.
And approximately how many other cases,
20 before being retained about this case because I'm
21 going to talk to you about your involvement with the
22 Engle cases in a moment, but before being retained in
23 this case, approximately how many other cases were
24 you retained on where you did not testify?
25
A.
Probably in the neighborhood of 12 to 15.
6
1
2
Something like that.
Q.
So would it be fair to say that in the 12
3 or 11 depositions you've given or the ten or 11 trial
4 testimonies that you've given, those cases probably
5 encompass 15 cases that you were retained on that
6 were in litigation and you gave some sort of
7 testimony on?
8 A. Yes, something like that.
9 Q. And you've been retained additionally 15
10 more times before this case on other cases, but just
11 purely as a consultant?
12
13
14
A.
In that range.
I would say more than ten
without being too precise.
Q.
So somewhere in a total of 25 to 30 cases
Page 5depo of Lacy Ford
15 in the past?
16 A. That's correct.
17 Q. And would all those cases be for R.J.
18
19
Reynolds or some for Philip Morris, as well?
A.
All those cases began either as R.J.
20 Reynolds cases or cases in which R.J. Reynolds was a
21 co-defendant with other companies.
22 have been one or two cases in which R.J. Reynolds was
23 -- in which I had already been designated as an
24 expert, but R.J. Reynolds, for one reason or another,
25 fell out of the case and I continued on as an expert,
I think there may
7
1
2
but that is unusual.
Q.
But with the 25 or 30 cases where you've
3 been retained, either as a consultant or testifying
4 expert, the initial contact and the initial retaining
5 of you went through lawyers representing R.J.
6 Reynolds?
7
8
9
A.
That's correct; to the best of my
recollection, yes.
Q.
And I assume the first time you were
10 contacted by a law firm to be involved in this
11 tobacco stuff, it was probably a law firm
12 representing R.J. Reynolds; is that correct?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Was it through R.J. Reynolds directly or
15
16
17
through one of their lawyers?
A.
I was contacted by a lawyer in the Jones
Day law firm in 1995, and they indicated in that call
Page 618
depo of Lacy Ford
that they were representing R.J. Reynolds.
19 Q. And do you know how they got your name?
20 A. I don't.
I believe I was referred to them
21 by other historians that they were contacted, but I
22 don't know that for sure.
23
Q.
Were you surprised to get a call out of
24 the blue from a law firm representing the tobacco
25 company?
8
1
A.
Well, I had been contacted on a couple of
2 other occasions about possible consulting work for
3 litigation purposes, and I guess I was surprised
4 every time, but it is something that historians are
5 sometimes contacted to do.
6 I guess would be the answer.
7
Q.
So I'm always surprised,
But before getting to that, I went through
8 your CV and I read some of your other depositions.
9 It's my understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong,
10 before that initial contact from Jones Day, you
11 didn't really have any interest in doing work on
12 behalf of the tobacco companies; is that a fair
13 statement?
14
A.
I certainly have never done any work for
15 them before that nor sought any work from them, no;
16 that's correct.
17
Q.
And you didn't have any interest in your
18 career in the history of tobacco prior to that
19 initial contact; is that correct?
20
21
A.
No; that's not correct.
My specialty, as
you know, is probably American history, and within
Page 7depo of Lacy Ford
22 that, southern history.
And tobacco, in a variety of
23 ways, you know, the growth of it and the
24 manufacturing of it and the sale of it, has an
25 important part of that history.
So it was something
9
1 that I had some interest in.
2 thought about necessarily doing any consulting work
3 at that point.
4
5
6
Q.
I have not, of course,
Have you published on the history of
tobacco before being contacted by Jones Day?
A.
In the published work that I had done,
7 there were certainly mentions of tobacco in one form
8 or another, yes, but other than --
9 Q. Have you -- I'm sorry, go ahead.
10 A. Well, I'll just say that I had --
11 certainly, when it was appropriate to discuss
12 tobacco, given the topics I was publishing about, it
13 had received some brief treatment.
14
Q.
So would it be fair to say that any
15 mention in your prior publications before 1995 in
16 regards to tobacco would have been brief?
17
18
19
A.
Yes, that would probably be fair or not
terribly extensive, in any case.
Q.
And in terms of the publications that
20 you're referring to where you did have a brief
21 mention of tobacco prior to being contacted by Jones
22 Day in 1995, can you tell me which publications you
23 are referring to?
24
A.
Well, there would be several, but probably
Page 825
depo of Lacy Ford
the chief one would be the book that I wrote in -- it
10
1 was published in 1998.
2 there called Origin to Southern Radicalism of Oxford
3 University prep.
4 about early efforts to grow tobacco in South
5 Carolina.
6 1790s.
7
Q.
There's a brief section in
There's a brief section in there
This would have been in the 1780s and
Okay.
But that didn't deal with the
8 issues of common knowledge or public knowledge of the
9 health hazards of tobacco, correct?
10 A. No, it did not.
11 Q. And that book that you're referring to
12 that was published in 1998, how many pages was that
13 book?
14 A. I believe it was 370-plus pages of text.
15 Q. And how many pages were devoted to the
16
efforts to grow tobacco in South Carolina?
17 A. Maybe one, 1-1/2.
18 Q. So that's what you mean by a brief
19
mentioning of tobacco?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. You understand, in these tobacco
22 litigation cases, and maybe I wasn't clear and I
23 apologize, you're being offered as an expert who is
24 going to testify about public knowledge and common
25 knowledge of the health hazards of tobacco and the
11
Page 9depo of Lacy Ford
1 knowledge of the addictive nature of nicotine,
2 correct?
3
A.
Yes.
I'm going to talk about the public
4 awareness of the health hazards of smoking and the
5 public awareness of the addictive or habit-forming
6 qualities of cigarettes, yes.
7
Q.
Tell me what the extent of your work was
8 prior to being contacted by Jones Day in 1995 in
9 regards to the public awareness of the health hazards
10
11
of tobacco and the addictive nature of nicotine.
A.
Well, certainly in those instances where I
12 taught courses dealing with the modern US period, the
13 subject of the health impact of tobacco was something
14 that was mentioned, if it was appropriate to the
15 course, but that would be the extent of my
16 involvement with the subject at that time in 1995.
17
Q.
Right.
But that dealing was with the
18 public awareness?
Or maybe I'm not following you.
I
19 want to know, and maybe I'm missing what you're
20 saying, prior to 1995, did you publish at all on the
21 public awareness issues that you're here to testify
22 about today?
23 A.
Prior to 1995, I had not published on the
24 issues of public awareness of the health hazards of
25 smoking.
12
1
Q.
Prior to 1995, did you teach any courses
2 that involved public awareness of health hazards and
3 the addictive nature of nicotine that you're prepared
Page 10depo of Lacy Ford
4
to testify to today?
5
A.
Well, I'm trying to give you a good answer
6 to that.
In teaching, I didn't teach any courses,
7 certainly, that focused on that.
8 American history survey courses, that might be
9 included as a small part of a larger hull or South
10 Carolina history since 1865, but I'm not trying to
11 say that I taught courses that focused on that
12 subject.
13 answer.
14 Q.
But even in the
I was trying to give you a more complete
I understand that it may have came up in
15 some of these courses the efforts to grow tobacco and
16 maybe tobacco caused lung cancer and things of that
17 nature, but did you really go in any depth, or in any
18 depth at all, about the public awareness of those
19 issues in those courses before 1995?
20
A.
Well, certainly not the kind of depth that
21 you go into for these cases.
You could go into the
22 depth to the extent -- you don't go into a lot of
23 depth about a lot of things.
24 were things that you go into in more depth about than
25 this.
And, of course, there
13
1
I'm not really trying to claim, though,
2 that a lot of attention was given to it in these
3 classes, but it was discussed, I guess, is what I'm
4 trying to convey.
5
6
7
Q.
So would you agree that in some classes it
wasn't discussed at all?
A.
Some of the classes that I teach, which
Page 11depo of Lacy Ford
8 deal with the pre-Civil War period, it wasn't
9 discussed at all; that's correct.
10
Q.
And other classes where it was discussed,
11 the public awareness and the health hazards of
12 tobacco or nicotine, if it was discussed, it would
13 have been minor, if at all?
14
15
16
A.
It was certainly not the focus of the
class, yes.
Q.
Can you give me an example of how it would
17 have came up pre-1995?
18 what type of thing you would have said about that?
19
A.
Just a short example of like
Well, one of the courses that I teach is
20 South Carolina history since 1865.
21 know, tobacco emerged as an important cash crop in
22 South Carolina in the early 20th century and
23 continued to be down into the 1980s.
24
25
And as you may
However, tobacco farming was on the
decline probably from the 1960s into the 1980s.
And
14
1 in analyzing that decline, one of the things I would
2 have mentioned would have been the issue of the
3 health hazards of smoking and resulting, whether
4 causal or not, as kind of a decline in demand for
5 cigarettes and so forth.
6
Q.
Okay.
I understand.
So were you talking
7 about, hey, there's, you know, the Surgeon General's
8 Report and warnings on cigarettes, and that may have
9 played a part in the decline?
10
A.
Yes, something along those lines.
Page 1211
Q.
depo of Lacy Ford
But in terms of analyzing, you know, the
12 newspaper articles, the media attention, and poll
13 results in term of public awareness, you didn't
14 really get into that; is that a fair statement?
15
A.
Certainly not at the level of preparing
16 something for publication, yes.
17 teach.
18
Q.
Just looking to
Well, before you were retained in 1995,
19 did you have an opinion as to what percentage of
20 Americans believed smoking caused lung cancer, say,
21 in 1965?
22 MR. SUAREZ:
23 MR. PAIGE:
24 MR. BATISTA:
25
Objection.
Form.
Let me rephrase that.
Gary, this is David.
If we
could, can we agree that any objections lodged
15
1 by any of the defendants' counsel will serve as
2 an objection as to all defendants?
3
4
MR. PAIGE:
Whatever he thinks.
5 MR. KOETHE:
6 MR. PAIGE:
7
I'll refer that to Paul.
Q.
I think that would be fair.
Okay.
(By Mr. Paige)
Then no problem.
In looking at the
8 materials that you relied upon, I got your reliance
9 materials, there are certain poll results that you
10 have from the Gallup polls and other polls.
11 reviewed those, correct?
12
13
14
A.
You
I have reviewed a number of polls in my
research for this case, yes.
Q.
All right.
And certainly, through your
Page 13depo of Lacy Ford
15 review of the polls, you have some opinions about how
16 many people knew that smoking caused lung cancer
17 during different decades and different time periods,
18 correct.
19 A. Yes; that's correct.
20 Q. Well, when you were teaching your courses
21 pre-1995, I'm assuming you had not yet done that
22 research?
23
24
25
A.
No, I had not done that research at that
time.
Q.
So when you were teaching your courses,
16
1 you weren't really talking about what people believed
2 in terms of -- you know, what the public knowledge
3 was in terms of smoking and lung cancer in the '50s,
4 '60s, or '70s, were you --
5 A. If I understand --
6 Q. Well --
7
8
9
MR. KOETHE:
Q.
Let him finish.
(By Mr. Paige)
I wasn't done with my
question.
10 A. I'm sorry.
11 Q. I was going to say, and, if so, can you
12
tell me what you were basing it upon at that time?
13 MR. KOETHE:
14 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
I had probably a lot less
15 well-documented understanding that the health
16 hazards of smoking were well known.
17 basing that on my sort of experience as a
Page 14
I was18 depo of Lacy Ford
historian and what I had seen in terms of
19 coverage and newspapers and on television on
20 those sorts of things.
21
I had not, at that point, undertaken the
22 research to amass the body of documentation.
I
23 wouldn't have ventured to offer my opinion as an
24 expert without doing that research to back it
25 up.
But for teaching purposes, my knowledge
17
1 seems sufficient.
2 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Okay.
But again, for
3 teaching purposes, if I understand you correctly and
4 I'll move on, it wasn't the focus of your courses and
5 if it was discussed at all, it was briefly in some of
6 your courses?
7 A. It was not the focus of my courses.
8 Q. What I said was correct?
9 MR. SUAREZ: Form.
10 MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
11 MR. BATISTA:
12
Objection asked and
answered.
13
THE WITNESS:
I would say that it was not
14 the focus of my courses and I tried to discuss
15 the issue appropriately depending on what the
16 course was, but that would admittedly not be a
17 major focus of any of the courses that I taught.
18 Q.
19
(By Mr. Paige)
Now, is it the major focus
of any of the courses now?
20 MR. KOETHE:
21 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
Well, the course I'm
Page 15depo of Lacy Ford
22 teaching right now, it ends in 1877, so I don't
23 really get into it.
24 they are -- certainly, they're just not general
25 history courses offered for which this is going
I mean, I don't think that
18
1 to be a focus.
And I think, in the courses if
2 it's appropriate, I think I treat it adequately,
3 but I'm not trying to tell you that it is a
4 major focus, no.
5 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Has it been the major
6 focus of any of your publications since being
7 retained by Jones Day?
8 MR. SUAREZ:
9 THE WITNESS:
Objection.
Form.
I would say, no, that it has
10 not, as I understand major focus.
11 Q.
12
13
(By Mr. Paige)
How were you retained in
this particular case?
A.
I was contacted by Mr. Koethe from Jones
14 Day, I believe, in June of this year.
15 that -- he mentioned the case to me and asked me if I
16 would be willing, given my background in the health
17 risks of smoking in Florida in particular, be willing
18 to consult and possibly serve as an expert witness
19 and I agreed.
20
Q.
He told me
Were you asked, and I'm going to get into
21 your reliance materials later in more detail, but
22 were you asked to look at materials that related
23 specifically to the decedent in this case and his
24 understanding of the risks of smoking?
Page 1625
depo of Lacy Ford
Yes, I was.
A.
19
1 Q.
And what were you told initially about
2 Mr. Sherman?
3 A.
I think I was told originally that he was
4 a long-time resident of Florida and, prior to that
5 Illinois, and that this was a lung cancer and smoking
6 case.
7
8
I think that was the gist of it.
Q.
Was this the first Florida Engle-related
case that you were retained on?
9
MR. KOETHE:
10
Object to the form.
THE WITNESS:
At approximately the same
11 time, maybe a little bit earlier, I was asked
12 about another case.
13 Hardbreath case.
14 Q.
I believe it was the
(By Mr. Paige)
And do you know how many
15 other Engle-related cases you are currently retained
16 on?
17
A.
If the Hardbreath case is ongoing, I had
18 suspended work on it myself, but if it's ongoing, I
19 guess I'm still related to that.
20 time, I believe I've agreed to work on one other
21 case, and I haven't actually begun work on that case
22 yet.
23
24
25
Q.
And since that
And what is the name of that case?
MR. KOETHE:
Objection.
I'm not sure,
Gary, you may be getting into an area where
20
Page 17depo of Lacy Ford
1 there's no known disclosure.
2 think --
3
MR. PAIGE:
So I don't
Well, Paul, you presumably
4 know what cases you've retained him on and you
5 know what cases you've disclosed him on.
6 you don't know and you want to ask him the name
7 of the case, you can have him whisper it in your
8 ear or leave the room.
9
MR. KOETHE:
10
MR. PAIGE:
You can do that.
Okay.
Hold on.
But if you want to instruct
11 him not to answer because he hasn't been
12 disclosed, that's fine, too.
13 MR. KOETHE:
14 MR. PAIGE:
So if
Let me just --
But I don't want you to say he
15 may have been disclosed or he may not have,
16 because if he has been disclosed, I'm entitled
17 to know about it.
18 MR. KOETHE:
19 (Off the record.)
20 MR. KOETHE:
21
MR. PAIGE:
Gary, you can ask the
Did you just mute me?
Was
there a conference going on there?
24
25
Just a second.
question.
22
23
Hold on.
MR. KOETHE:
I did mute you.
I was asking
him what case --
21
1
2
3
MR. PAIGE:
Q.
All right.
(By Mr. Paige)
No problem.
So if I understand you
correctly, prior to the Sherman case, you were
Page 184 depo of Lacy Ford
retained on the Hardbreath case and some time after
5 the Sherman case, you were retained on another
6 Engle-related case; is that correct?
7
A.
Very recently, within the past few weeks,
8 I've been asked about another case.
9 recall off the top of my head because I haven't begun
10
11
The name I don't
work on it yet.
Q.
Okay.
Do you know what county it's in?
12 Have they asked you to research some newspapers or
13 anything like that?
Do you know where it is?
14 MR. SUAREZ:
15 THE WITNESS:
Objection.
Form.
All I can say is that I was
16 planning to begin work on that after this
17 deposition.
18 detail about that case except to tell you that I
19 have been consulted about one additional case.
20 Q.
21
I can't really give you any more
(By Mr. Paige)
And who contacted you
about that case?
22 A. Jones Day.
23 Q. So in addition to the 25 cases that we
24 previously spoke about where you've either testified
25 or have been hired as a consultant, those were all
22
1 cases that you were retained on prior to any
2 involvement with Engle prior to the cases, correct?
3 A. As I understand that, yes.
4 Q. And since the Engle decision, you've been
5 retained on the Hardbreath case, the Sherman case,
6 and one other case as far as you know?
7
A.
Yes.
Page 19depo of Lacy Ford

9
10
Q.
Have you given Jones Day or any of the
defendants permission to list you on cases without
contacting you first or retaining you first?
11 A. No, not that I can recall.
12 Q. Would you have a problem if they were
13 listing you on as an expert on the Escambia County or
14 Hillsborough County on cases that you didn't know
15 about?
16
A.
Well, I just haven't run into that
17 situation.
18 wanted to use me.
19 limited amount that I can do.
20
Q.
They've always consulted me if they
My schedule is limited.
There's a
Since 1995, you've earned income every
21 year for your work related to tobacco research,
22 correct?
23 A. Yes; that's correct.
24 Q. Do you know approximately an average of
25
what amount you're paid each year for this type of
23
1
2
work?
A.
Yes.
It's based on the number of hours I
3 put in in any given year, and that number has gone up
4 and down -- did you lose me?
5
6
MR. PAIGE:
9
10
I hit something.
Hold on.
7
8
Hold on.
(Off the record.)
Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Do you
remember where we were or do you want me to ask the
question?
Page 2011 A. depo of Lacy Ford
You probably better re-ask the question.
12 Q. Since 1995, can you tell me how much
13 you've been paid doing work on behalf of R.J.
14 Reynolds and the tobacco companies?
15
A.
I'm paid by the hour, and the amount of
16 work has varied a good deal from year to year.
17 in total, over that 14-year period, probably about
18 $35,000 per year would be a good average during that
19 period of time.
20
21
22
23
24
25
Q.
But
Do you know what the most you made in any
particular year?
A.
Let me think about that.
It's been a
couple of years probably where I made over $60,000.
Q.
You don't recall ever making six figures
in a year doing this type of work?
24
1
A.
No, I don't believe.
In fact, I'm certain
2 that I have not made six figures in a year doing this
3 kind of work, no.
4
5
6
Q.
And how much have you been paid for this
case to date?
A.
Let's see.
I've put in bills for ten
7 hours of work at $175 an hour for this case.
8 haven't put in a bill for September yet.
9
10
Q.
Now, I
And how much time did you spend in
September working on the case?
11 A. About 30 hours.
12 Q. So you're at 40 hours in this case so far?
13 A. Yes; that's correct.
14 Q. And do you know how much you would expect
Page 21depo of Lacy Ford
15
to be paid for your testimony at trial?
16
17
A.
it just depends how long I'm involved at trial.
18
19
Again, I have an hourly rate of $175, so
Q.
Did you receive a copy of our notice to
take your deposition duces tecum?
20 A. Yes, I did or a copy of it.
21 Q. Did you try to bring with you the items
22
that we requested?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. Cold you tell me what you brought with you
25
today?
To the extent I could, I did, yes.
Well, Doctor, tell me what you brought one at
25
1 a time, because some of them I may want to mark and
2 others I may not.
3 would appreciate it.
4
5
A.
So if we could do it slowly, I
I have with me my Curriculum Vitae
recently up to date.
6
Q.
Why don't we mark that.
If you can give
7 it to the court reporter, we'll mark that as Exhibit
8 1.
9 up-to-date CV, correct?
10
And that, as I understand it, is your most
A.
11
Yes, it is.

12 identification.)
13 Q.
14 notice?
15 that you have.

Do you have a copy of the
We'll mark that as Exhibit 2, the notice
16 A. I don't have a copy with me, no.
17 Q. No problem.
Tell me what else you have.
Page 2218
depo of Lacy Ford
I brought about six pages of handwritten
A.
19 notes, which are my notes from the interrogatories
20 and depositions that I read related to this case.
21
Q.
All right.
In those notes, did you write
22 what you thought were the most significant facts from
23 what you read?
24
25
A.
I wouldn't characterize it like that.
I
wrote down things that would give me a sense of the
26
1 personal history of the plaintiff.
2 cases, I wrote down things that were significant to
3 me.

I did not bring a set with me this

Okay.
You don't have a copy of your

13 A. I did not bring one, no.
14 Q. Did you submit an extra report in this

case?
16 A. Yes, I did.
17 Q. And where is that?
18 A. I have a copy of that, and I did not bring

No, there's really not.
I guess I missed
I was supposed to.
MR. KOETHE:

No, it's all right.
I'm not

3 and I'm not criticizing you, Professor.
4 appreciate that you brought the file as you
5 remember and thought was appropriate.
6
MR. KOETHE:
Hold on, Gary.
I
I need to
7 make a statement before you go on to your next
8 question.
9
MR. PAIGE:
Well, I would object to you
10 making a statement.
11 statement and it's inappropriate, it may be a
12 problem for later, but you can do whatever you

If you want to make your
I cannot prevent you from making a
Go ahead, and we'll see how the
MR. KOETHE:
Okay, thank you.
Just so
17 we're clear, we provided to you an extra witness
18 disclosure, and I think there's some confusion.
19 There is no report that Dr. Ford prepared for
20 this case --
21
MR. PAIGE:
See, Paul, that's a problem
22 with you talking because I could have asked the
23 doctor that.
24 wouldn't have a problem with it, but now that
25 you're testifying, I have a problem with that.
And if that was his testimony, I

That's inappropriate.
I don't know you
2 and there's a lot of lawyers involved in this
3 case that are licensed in Florida and that are
4 not licensed in Florida, and I can tell you that
5 what you're saying now is totally inappropriate.
6 So if I could just question the witness
7 without you testifying, I would appreciate it
8 very much.
9 -- we will address that later.

I think your statement, you know, is

We
So you have
There is no other expert report that has
16 been prepared for this case.
17 expert disclosure that has been prepared for
18 this case that hasn't been provided to you, and
19 I think the record needs to be clear on that.
20 MR. PAIGE:
21 MR. KOETHE:
There is no other
No problem.
You know, you asked the
22 question.
And in terms of what a report is and
23 what a disclosure is, Dr. Ford may not be
24 attuned to the distinctions that may or may not
25 pertain to that type of question.
I want to
30
1 make sure that the record was clear and that
2 we've given you everything that we have with
3 respect to that report.
Page 264
MR. PAIGE:
depo of Lacy Ford
Well, I'm sure that your
5 client will appreciate your speaking statement.
6 I don't know if the judge will be so enthused by
7 it.
8 Q.
9
10
(By Mr. Paige)
Professor, you've
testified before in many cases where you've had to
write reports, have you not?
11
A.
I guess in every case I've testified in,
12 I've been disclosed.
13 have to write sort of your own disclosure.
14 it's in a state court, I've relied on lawyer's
15 advice, because sometimes those are prepared and I
16 generally read and approve them.
17
If it's in a federal case, you
That's what I did in this case.
And if
There was
18 a disclosure, and I confess that I didn't mean to
19 mislead you if I suggested there was anything other
20 than a disclosure, which you have.
21 of that, which I didn't bring probably because I
22 figured you would have a copy of that.

The reports that you've
16 written in federal court, I've seen some of them.

18
A.
Yes, I tend to refer to those as
19 affidavits, but, yes, they're lengthy affidavits that
20 are often filed in federal court.
21
22
Q.
And in your bill, Exhibit 3, is it an
itemized bill or not?
23 MR. KOETHE:
24 THE WITNESS:
25
Object to the form.
It lists the number of hours
I worked and what I did in those hours.

Okay.
Can you read it to
A. In June, I did two hours of reading and

In July, I did three hours of reading and
5 review.
6 and review.
And in August, I did five hours of reading
7 Q. So your bill is three different pages?
8 A. Yes.
9
10
One per month that had been
submitted, yes.
Q.
So, I'm sorry, in June, what did the
Page 2811
12
depo of Lacy Ford
reading and review include? Do you know?
A.
The reading and review in June, I think,
13 included any materials about the plaintiffs that the
14 lawyers had sent, like the interrogatories.
15 looking back through work that I had done, I'm making
16 sure that I had what I thought was appropriate
17 materials; newspapers, magazines, background
18 information at the time.
19 Q.

21 A.

In my

That latter part of that answer is from
And then what about in July, what does
that time entail?
A.
Again, it was three hours.
Essentially,
33
1 reading depositions as they were available and
2 reviewing my Florida and Illinois material.
3 particular, beginning to think about what body of
4 material would be appropriate for the reliance list
5 and that sort of thing.
6
7
Q.
In
Does it say that on the bill what you're
saying or does it just say three hours?
8 A. It says, "Reading and review three hours."
9 Q. Okay.
10 A. Not beneath that, no.
11 Q. And in August, what does your time entail?
12 A. Five hours, again, more reading and
13 review. 14 Q.
So it doesn't specify?
And do you know what you were reading and
Page 29depo of Lacy Ford
15
16
reviewing at that time?
A.
Again, I think I was working primarily
17 looking at my kind of archive of research in deciding
18 what would be appropriate given what I was knowing
19 and learning about the Sherman case.
20 most of that, as I've indicated, has been done in the
21 month of September.
22
Q.
And, of course,
But the reading and reviewing of the
23 report that you now call a disclosure, you did not
24 bill for that?
25
A.
Well, that would have been part of the
34
1 reading that I've done, but that would have been a
2 very small part.
3 like that.
4
5
Q.
Probably, 15 minutes or something
Did you have any e-mails or correspondence
between you and the lawyers?
6 A. No.
7 Q. Is there a policy that you have with them

9
where they tell you don't put anything in writing?
A.
No.
10 depositions.
11 Q.
12
I mean, I made notes from the
But when they send you the depositions,
there's not a cover letter with it?
13 A. Generally, there's not, no.
14 Q. And there's no e-mail between you and them
15 at all? 16 A.
17
Sometimes we do scheduling by e-mail, but
that wasn't the case here.
Page 3018
19
depo of Lacy Ford
So how did you know when your deposition
Q.
was for this case?
20 A. Mr. Koethe called me and let me know.
21 Q. And then how did you get the report or the
22 disclosure as you now call it?
Did it just come in
23 the mail with nothing attached to it?
24 MR. BATISTA: Object to the form.
25 THE WITNESS: It did come in the mail and
35
1 he had told me that it was coming.
2 it and called him back and told him what I
3 thought about it.

5

9
But it just came in an
envelope with no letter?
A.
There was not a cover letter that I
recall, no.
Q.
Did you think that was odd to get the
disclosure with no letter with it?
10 A.
11 coming.

you just receive one page?

(By Mr. Paige)
A. No, I believe I received it in this form,

yes.
14 exactly what you received in the envelope without the

16
17
18
19
20
A.
Let me look at it just for a minute and
make sure that's the case.
Q.
All right.
Is that what you received in
the envelope without the cover letter?
A.
Mr. Paige, I'll have to say I don't
21 remember if I received this whole number of pages or
22 just the part relating to my disclosure.
23 point, I just don't remember.
24
Q.
Okay.

15 copy of the report or disclosure or whatever it
16 is, and you could provide it to the court
17 reporter, since he didn't bring it today, I'd
18 like that marked as Exhibit 5 and not what you
19 gave him because he doesn't know that's what he
20 received.

23
But if he can get you a
Is that a problem?
MR. KOETHE:
We'll look into it.
I'm not
objecting.
MR. PAIGE:
If not, we'll have to do
24 another whole deposition to look at it.
25 we could do that, too.
I mean,
I would think this is
38
Page 33depo of Lacy Ford
1 the easier way.
2 will you let me know?
3
MR. KOETHE:
But if you're not in agreement,
I will let you know.
Do you
4 want to mark the disclosure that was filed in
5 this case or not that we have here today?
6 is the question that I'm --
7
MR. PAIGE:
No.
That
I want to mark -- I want
8 to have what he was supposed to bring with him,
9 which is a copy of the report or disclosure that
10
you're now calling it.
11
MR. KOETHE:
Well, that's what you do
12 have, Gary, and it's what we have here.
13 we're happy to mark it.
14
MR. PAIGE:
So
He's saying he doesn't know.
15 Do you want to go off the record and talk to him
16 and make sure that he can authenticate that
17 that's what he received?
18 that.
19 MR. KOETHE:
20 MR. PAIGE:
21 (Off the record.)
22 (Plaintiff's Exhibit 5 was marked for
23 identification.)
24 Q.
25
Okay.
I have no problem with
Okay.
(By Mr. Paige)
We'll do that.
Go ahead.
Exhibit 5, which has been
marked to your deposition, is that the disclosure
39
1 that was provided to you by Jones Day without a cover
2 letter that you received at your home?
3
A.
The portion that pertains to my testimony,
Page 344 depo of Lacy Ford
my disclosure, is the part that I had sent in.
5 best of my recollection is that I did receive it in a
6 package, which included some other disclosures as
7 well, but I'm not absolutely positive about that.
8
9
The
That's the best answer I can give you, but
I can certainly assure you that the portion that is
10 my expert disclosure, is my expert disclosure in this
11 case and the only disclosure that has been prepared.
12
Q.
Okay.
So you're saying, on Exhibit 5,
13 page four and five is what you received in a package
14 from Jones Day, and whether it is in this form or
15 another form, that's what you received?
16
MR. SUAREZ:
17
Q.
Objection to the form.
(By Mr. Paige)
I think if you look at
18 page four, that's where it describes you and then it
19 goes into page five.
20
A.
Yes, that is my disclosure beginning at
21 the bottom of page four and carrying over to
22 page five.
23
Q.
And the form that you received it on, was
24 it like on another piece of paper that probably was
25 not in this form when you received it?
40
1
A.
I'm just saying it may have been or it may
2 just have been my portion of it excerpted.
3 can't remember now which it was.
4 back and look.
5 might be another question, but I could do it.

(By Mr. Paige)
And that's fine.
I
22 understand that.
Now, the disclosure in Exhibit 5
23 for what you received at home, which will be marked
24 as Exhibit 6 to your deposition, is that a report
25 that you prepared or is it a report that Jones Day
41
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
prepared?
A.
It is a report that Jones Day prepared in
consultation with me and with my approval.
Q.
No, but when you received it, was that the
first time you had seen that report?
A.
I think I had talked to Mr. Koethe about
it in substance on the phone on a prior occasion.
Q.
Well, what part of this report did you
talk to him about on the phone?
A.
The issues which I would testify about.
Page 3611 Q. depo of Lacy Ford
Which is the first paragraph?
12 A. It begins with, "Dr. Ford is expected to
13 testify," in the third sentence and continues through
14 the first and through the second paragraph.
15 he asked me questions about some of the material in
16 the final paragraph, and I provided him information
17 with it.
18
MR. BATISTA:
And then
Gary, just for the record,
19 you're talking about this expert disclosure,
20 right?
21
22
MR. PAIGE:
That's what I believe he's
speaking about.
23
MR. BATISTA:
Because you keep saying
24 report, but the document itself is titled
25 Disclosure.
So I just wanted to be clear.
42
1
MR. KOETHE:
It's actually titled Witness
2 List, so we're totally clear.
3 sure because we're using these words and I don't
4 know if they have any technical meaning in
5 anybody's mind, but this is what was filed in
6 the case, whatever anyone wants to call it.
7 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
You know, I'm not
Now, the words that are
8 used in the first paragraph that you contributed
9 through your telephone call with Mr. Koethe, have you
10 been described as an expert in similar terms in other
11 cases in the past or is this the first time that you
12 really used these terms to describe --
13
14
A.
It's been described in similar terms in
the past, yes.
Page 37depo of Lacy Ford
15
16
Q.
And he was aware of that and was in
possession of that information?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. So would it be fair to say the actual
19 disclosure of you, number four to this expert witness
20 list, was prepared by Jones Day and then they went
21 over it with you to make sure it met with your
22 approval?
23
24
25
A.
With my consultation and approval, yes, it
was prepared by Jones Day.
Q.
And when did you have that conversation
43
1
2
3
with Mr. Koethe?
A.
To the best of my recollection, that was
at some point in August, yes.
4 Q. And how long was that phone consultation?
5 A. 20 minutes or so.
6 Q. And how many other phone calls have you
7
Something like that.
had with him about this case?
8 A. Probably four to six.
9 Q. And would those have all been during June,
10
July, and August?
11 A. Or September, yes.
12 Q. Well, do you know how many were in
13
September?
14 A. I would say two or three.
15 Q. And then you had maybe two or three during
16
17
July and August combined.
A.
Yes, probably during those months
Page 38depo of Lacy Ford
And that would include the initial call
18 combined.
19 when he asked me if I was able to undertake this
20 particular case.
21 Q. You don't bill for your phone calls?
22 A. Generally, phone calls are very brief, and
23 I guess that I probably don't figure that in.
You
24 know, a passing phone call, I don't try to fit that
25 in the number of hours.
44
1
Q.
Okay.
They call you and you're on the
2 phone for five minutes coordinating a deposition, you
3 wouldn't bill for that, correct?
4 A. That's correct; yes.
5 Q. But for your 20-minute consultation in
6 preparing your expert report, you did not bill for
7 that either?
8 A.
9
hours.
I may have factored that into the August
I probably did.
That would have been a
10 somewhat more substantial phone call.
11 the report, I probably did factor that in.
12
13
Q.
In preparing
Can we move past the report now?
Let's do
that.
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Have you received any grants from the
16
tobacco industry?
17 A. No, I have not.
18 Q. Have you ever submitted a grant proposal
19
to the National Cancer Institute?
20 A. No, I have not.
21 Q. Have you submitted any grant proposals to
Page 39depo of Lacy Ford
22 any organization related to your opinions regarding
23 cigarette issues?
24 A. No, I have not.
25 Q. Tell me about the bill that you have not
45
1 yet submitted for September that entails 30 hours.
2 Can you tell me what that was for?
3
A.
Yes.
That was really for additional work

10 Mr. Sherman, the plaintiff in this case, in order
11 that we could compile the reliance list that we made
12 available to you as the basis for my possible

14
Q. Who made the reliance list available to
16 A. I believe that Jones Day law firm sent you
17 a copy. 18 Q.

me?
Exhibit 4 -- I'm sorry, I wrote a note to
ask you something.
A.
What is Exhibit 4, again?
Exhibit 4 is a list of the cases that I've
21 given testimony in since 2000, either in the form of
22 deposition or trial testimony in the list of the
23 case-related materials such as complaints and
24 depositions related to the Sherman case that the law
Page 4025
depo of Lacy Ford
firm provided me for me to review in this case.
46
1
Q.
2
That's fine.
MR. PAIGE:
I appreciate that.
Why don't we take a
3 five-minute break.
4 THE WITNESS:
5 (Recess from 11:40 a.m. to 11:48 a.m.)
6
Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
7 your reliance list.
8 that?
9
A.
Yes, I need one.
Professor, I have seen
Can you tell me how you compiled
Yes, I think I can.
Over a period of time
10 and working on this particular case and other cases,
11 I have recommended to the lawyers a certain set of
12 documents or certain sets of documents, it changes
13 somewhat, that I would rely on for my opinion.
14 of them are probably the same in every case, and a
15 number of them are different in each case.
16
Some
I try to identify, in some form or
17 fashion, sets of materials and send copies of those
18 materials to the lawyers if they don't -- if I
19 haven't already sent it to them, and they compiled
20 the list in the form that you received.
21
22
Q.
Did they remove any of the documents that
you recommended to be included on your reliance list?
23 A. No, they did not.
24 Q. And did they add anything to the list that
25
you recommended on your reliance list?
47
Page 41depo of Lacy Ford
1 MR. KOETHE:
2 THE WITNESS:
3
Q.
Object to the form.
No, not to my knowledge.
(By Mr. Paige)
So you reviewed the list
4 and the list is exactly what you recommended to the
5 attorney that you included in your reliance list?

A.
Unless there's a mistake in it, and I
didn't notice one, but, yes, essentially.
Q.
lists.
I notice there's two different reliance
Was there a reason why there were two
10 different lists or no?
11 MR. SUAREZ:
12 THE WITNESS:
Objection to form.
I don't know that there are
13 two different lists.
14 different lists unless they're just lists at two
15 stages of compiling.
16 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
I'm not aware of two
Well, were there two lists
17 at two different stages of compiling that you're
18 familiar with?
19 A. I don't recall that.
20 Q. And do you have the reliance list with you
21
22
23
24
25
today?
A.
I did not bring it.
MR. KOETHE:
No, I did not.
I do have the list, Gary, if
you're interested.
MR. PAIGE:
Okay.
Why don't we mark the
48
1 reliance list and then show it to the doctor so
2 I can ask him about it.
3
(Plaintiff's Exhibit 7 was marked for
Page 42depo of Lacy Ford
4
identification.)
5
MR. KOETHE:
I have given to the court
6 reporter, and it has been marked as Exhibit 7,
7 Gary, the list that our office sent to you
8 approximately two weeks ago.
9 -- it's stated, Sherman-Lacy Ford Material.
10
It is Dr. Ford's
This list is identical to the list that we
11 disclosed to you when Dr. Ford was disclosed
12 with the exception that it contains an
13 additional column on the right-hand side, which
14 corresponds to the images of the documents that
15 we provided to you at your request.
16
So this list is, and I'm representing,
17 this list is the same list that we sent to you
18 with Dr. Ford's disclosure, but you asked to
19 have the actual material sent to you.
20 those to you.
21 materials, because they're on a disk, we added
22 this additional column with an identifier for
23 each document that appears on the CD.
24 is what has been marked as Exhibit 7.
25 Q.
We sent
And to help you identify those
(By Mr. Paige)
All right.
So that
Do you have
49
1
Exhibit 7, Doctor?
2 A. Yes, I do.
3 Q. And that is the document that you provided
4 to Jones Day and recommended be disclosed as your
5 entire reliance materials, correct?
6 A. Yes; that's correct.
7 Q. Tell me generally, so I can understand,
Page 43depo of Lacy Ford
8 what is the purpose of these reliance materials to
9 you as an expert?
10
A.
To me, these materials represent the
11 larger set of materials from which I might draw at
12 trial illustrations and examples.
13 some sort of exhibit form to support the testimony
14 I'm giving.
15
Q.
Okay.
I might use it in
And you want the reliance materials
16 to paint a full and accurate picture from both sides,
17 correct?
18 MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
19 MR. SUAREZ: Object to the form.
20 THE WITNESS:
Again, as I was saying, I
21 think this is, as I said before, this is a list
22 from which I might draw illustrations or
23 examples to support my testimony.
24 Q.
25
(By Mr. Paige)
How did you decide, for
example, which newspaper articles go on the list and
50
1
2
which ones did not?
A.
Again, I think that there are a lot of
3 newspaper articles, for example, included in here
4 that I would probably not use as illustrations for
5 time purposes, but that collectively and together
6 taken as a whole, they support my testimony and they
7 include the things that I would be most likely to
8 refer directly to or to use as an exhibit at trial.
9 I picked things that I think generally
10 would be most useful in illustrating my testimony
Page 44depo of Lacy Ford
You know, you can't show the jury everything
11 given.
12 that you've looked at or seen in your research.
13 it's the things that, I guess, tend to hit what would
14 be, I would say, major points of my testimony or that
15 I think might be part of, since I don't actually know
16 exactly.
17
Q.
Okay.
So
For example, there's different
18 newspapers.
19 York Times, Fort Lauderdale New, The Miami Herald,
20 the Chicago Tribune.
21 decades and decades of research.
22
You have the Orlando Sentinel, The New
You know, we're talking about
Obviously, I understand you cannot put
23 every single article written in those newspapers that
24 you've looked at on your reliance list.
25 can both agree with that, correct?
I think we
51
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. But you selected some articles out of each
3 of those newspapers to include on your reliance list,
4 correct?
5 A.
6 answer.
7 What I'm trying to convey here is to paint a broad
8 picture of how much information came into the public
9 domain about the health hazards of smoking.
10
I think maybe I can give you a better
Let me get to what you're trying to say.
Certainly, this was a major national
11 issue.
So I include things that were national in
12 nature in national magazines; Life, Newsweek,
13 national publications like The New York Times.
14 Others are more closely track the places and things
Page 45depo of Lacy Ford
15
that the plaintiff may have done in their lifetime.
16
So for this case, I would use materials
17 from Illinois newspapers in areas where Mr. Sherman
18 lived like Chicago, or in Florida.
19 the Miami area with The Miami Herald.
20 attended Baptist churches at times, so there's some
21 Baptist materials in here dealing with the health
22 hazards of smoking.
23
In particular, in
His family
So some of this is tailored to the life
24 story of the plaintiff.
And that is the portion that
25 changes somewhat from case to case.
52
1
Q.
Okay.
Maybe my question wasn't clear, and
2 I'll go back to it.
But in terms of the story that
3 was covered in The New York Times or Newsweek
4 magazine that you include in your reliance material,
5 did that story differ from the story that was
6 published in the Fort Lauderdale News or the Illinois
7 newspapers during the same time period?
8 MR. KOETHE:
9 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Well, it's difficult to
10 answer it.
11 and it's difficult to answer.
12 of the period tended to be covered by state and
13 local publications, as well as the national
14 ones.
15
I mean, it's a very broad question
The major stories
And often, the regional and state
16 publications, the local newspapers, would carry
17 additional material that would relate to things
Page 4618 depo of Lacy Ford
that were going on in that area in terms of
19 awareness issues.
20
So I did think it's important to bring
21 those in, because often it's that sort of local
22 activity that generates the most local publicity
23 even though the story itself might be a national
24 thing that would be covered.
25 differences, but they're related to the same
So, yes, there are
53
1 issue.
2 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Right.
The Surgeon
3 General Report or warnings, that was national news?
4 That wasn't a local story, correct?
5 MR. KOETHE:
6 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
That was a story that was
7 covered in both national and local publications
8 in generally considerable detail and with
9 considerable follow up.
10
Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
So a lot of this
11 information we're talking about was covered
12 nationally, but there are also some local stories, as
13 well, that you copied?
14 MR. SUAREZ:
Objection.
15 Q. (By Mr. Paige)
16 A. Yes.
Form.
Is that correct?
There are a number of things that
17 are local and coming from what I would call
18 non-national sources of information that relate to
19 the health hazards of smoking.
20
21
Q.
Can you point me to any of these local
issues that you're referring to that you know
Page 47depo of Lacy Ford
22
23
Mr. Sherman was personally exposed to?
A.
Well, certainly there was a lot.
Florida
24 was uniquely involved with the American Cancer
25 Society's activities to spread the message about the
54
1 health hazards of smoking.
And I believe The Miamian
2 was president of the American Cancer Society in the
3 1960s.
4 which according to deposition testimony, Mr. Sherman
5 and his family read pretty regularly.
That's well publicized in The Miami Herald,
6 Q. He read The Miami Herald?
7 A. According to his deposition testimony,
8 that seems to be the case, yes.
9 wife's and family.
10
11
12
Q.
Not his, but his
And do you know what section of The Miami
Herald he would concentrate on or he would read?
A.
That was not indicated in the deposition,
13 but there were articles about smoking in a variety of
14 sections of The Miami Herald.
15
Q.
Right.
You know some people wake up and
16 they read the sports and other people may read the
17 business section, you know that, correct?
18
MR. KOETHE:
Object to form.
19 Q. (By Mr. Paige)
Do you know that?
20 A. People read the different parts of the
21 newspapers and they read them in different orders.
22 think that's one reason it's important to include
23 things on my reliance list, like advice columns,
24 which you wouldn't see if you just look at the front
Page 48
I25
depo of Lacy Ford
Those did have information about the health
page.
55
1 hazards of smoking.
2 of the newspaper to have missed these stories.
3
Q.
So you would have to miss a lot
I don't think anybody is saying
4 Mr. Sherman wasn't aware of stories that publicized
5 the health hazards.
6 the depositions?
7
A.
Is that your take from reading
My take from reading the depositions,
8 particularly from his wife, was that they had
9 followed those stories, according to her
10 recollection, pretty closely as they emerged in the
11 1950s and '60s and beyond.
12 Q. They were an educated couple?
13 A. I think that she designated him as a very
14 intelligent man, as did others.
15 high school to join the Navy before graduation.
16
17
18
Q.
I believe he left
But it was your perception, from reading
everything, that he was a fairly intelligent man?
A.
He seems to be bright and well informed
19 based on what I could gather from reading the
20 depositions.
21 Q.
But what I was getting at before, quite
22 frankly, which I did not get an answer to, quite
23 frankly, and respectfully maybe my question wasn't
24 clear, in terms of The Miami Herald, if I take that
25 paper out, for example, I take out a year, 1965 or
56
Page 49depo of Lacy Ford
1 1963, a year of less significance, and during that
2 year there are certain tobacco-related articles in
3 the newspaper, how do you decide which articles to
4 include on your list and which ones to exclude?
5 MR. KOETHE:
6 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Probably the most important
7 criterion in terms of this list would be the
8 probability that I would want to use an
9 illustration related to that article or use that
10 article to directly support something that I was
11 saying at trial.
12 to even a semi-manageable number, you have to
13 make some choices.
14 Q.
And in order to cull this down
(By Mr. Paige)
You wanted to use
15 materials that you believe Mr. Sherman was exposed to
16 one way or another?
17
A.
If it related to something that I thought
18 I might bring up in my direct testimony, that would
19 be the case, yes.
20
Q.
Okay.
And you understand, through your
21 review of the Miami newspapers, the New York
22 newspapers, the Chicago newspapers on your reliance
23 list that during the 1950s, there are articles
24 setting forth the health hazards of smoking
25 cigarettes, correct?
57
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. And there are also numerous articles on
3
the same papers disputing the health hazards of
Page 504
depo of Lacy Ford
smoking cigarettes, correct?
5 MR. KOETHE:
6 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Well, that's not exactly the
7 way the I characterize the coverage in that
8 newspapers.
9 Q.
10
11
So --
(By Mr. Paige)
MR. SUAREZ:
Q.
Okay.
So if I --
Let him finish.
(By Mr. Paige)
I just want to know if you
12 agree that there were articles disputing the health
13 hazards of smoking in the '50s in those newspapers.
14 MR. SUAREZ: Object to the form.
15 MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
16 THE WITNESS:
As a general rule, any
17 comments or statements taking issue with the
18 health hazards were included as part of a longer
19 article, which was explaining the health
20 hazards.
21
It was very unusual for there to be a
22 separate article which dealt with nothing but
23 people making statements or offering opinions
24 that disagrees with the fact that smoking was a
25 hazardous behavior.
58
1
Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Are you aware of articles
2 in the newspapers and magazines that you have in your
3 reliance list in the 1950s where doctors, tobacco
4 company representatives, the tobacco institute, the
5 AMA, or other health organizations came forward and
6 the primary coverage of the article was that smoking
7 did not cause lung cancer?
Page 51depo of Lacy Ford
8 MR. SUAREZ: Object to the form.
9 MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
10
THE WITNESS:
Again, I don't know that I
11 would agree with your characterization of those
12 articles.
13 timeframe in which doctors, scientists,
14 representatives of tobacco companies were making
15 statements to the effect that the health hazards
16 of smoking had not been proven and that there
17 needed to be more work done.
18
I have seen articles in that
Particularly, a common statement was the
19 statistics, while they might be a good indicator
20 of risk, don't explain causation.
21 to take one single statement and lump what all
22 of those statements were about.
23 statements were relatively few compared to the
24 larger body of material pointing to the health
25 risks of cigarette smoking.
So it's hard
And those
59
1
2
3
Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Did you include those
articles in your reliance materials?
A.
I think I've included articles that have
4 had comments to that effect.
I don't know whether I
5 included any of the very few separate articles that
6 there were.
7 Q. Why would you not include them?
8 A. Well, they would probably -- there were so
9 relatively few in number compared to the large body
10 of other articles, that they probably wouldn't have
Page 5211 depo of Lacy Ford
been things that I would have used to illustrate my
12 point on direct testimony, at least.
13
Q.
When you say few in numbers, can you just
14 give me an example?
Like if I pick a year like 1960,
15 how many articles would you consider to be so few
16 that you didn't include them in your reliance
17 materials for The Miami Herald, for example, where
18 that was the primary story?
19 MR. KOETHE:
20 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I can probably give you
21 something of a ballpark estimate.
There were,
22 for every article that addressed the health
23 hazards of smoking, probably every news article
24 that has addressed the health hazards of
25 smoking, probably no more than one of four of
60
1 those included internally to that story comments
2 raising questions about it.
3
If you look at the larger numbers of
4 stories, not just breaking news stories about
5 scientific studies and the like, that percentage
6 would go down to more like one in ten.
7
And in terms of -- in all the sources I've
8 looked at, stories which focused on questioning
9 the scientific report alone without considerable
10 discussion of the reports themselves, it would
11 have been a single-digit fraction.
12 ten percent of the number.
13 given year.
14 were some.
Less than
Maybe way less in a
That just didn't tend to be.
I have seen some.
Page 53
Theredepo of Lacy Ford
15 Q.
16 number?
17 something.
18
A.
(By Mr. Paige)
Ten percent of what
I don't understand.
I must have missed
The total number of stories in a given
19 period of time related to the issues of the health
20 hazards of smoking.
21
Q.
You understand that there were articles
22 disputing the health hazards of smoking in the '50s,
23 '60s, and even into the '70s, correct?
24 assuming there are different percentages as we go
25 along; would that be a fair statement?
And I'm
61

2
MR. KOETHE:
Q.
Object to the form.
(By Mr. Paige)
Let me rephrase it then.
3 Before I get to the next area, can we agree that
4 there were stories disputing the health hazards of
5 smoking in the 1950s?
6 MR. KOETHE:
7 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
And again, I think, as I
8 said before, there were a few stories disputing
9 the health hazards of smoking in the 1950s.
10 in comparison to the large number, the much
11 larger number, which were emphasizing the health
12 risks associated with smoking.
13 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
I understand that.

THE WITNESS: There were few in the '50s.
18
19 There were some, but they got even smaller in
20 number over time.
21 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
And that's what I'm trying
22 to figure out.
So in the '50s, what percentage do
23 you think were disputing the health hazards as
24 opposed to the '60s and '70s, if you can give me the
25 results of your research?
62
1 A. Again, to the best of my recollection --
2 Q. Just if you can give me the results of
3
your research as an expert of public knowledge.
4
MR. KOETHE:
Object to the form.
5 Q. (By Mr. Paige)
Go ahead.
6 A. To the best of my recollection, I would
7 say that in the 1950s, in all forms, you take all the
8 stories that related to the health hazards of
9 smoking, the number of stand-alone stories taking
10 issue with that would have been significantly less
11 than ten percent.
12 Q. And the '60s?
13 A. It would have been a lower single-digit
14 number. 15 Q. Less than five percent?
16 A. That's putting an awfully fine point on it
17 since I haven't attempted to count those up exactly,
18 but, yes, five or less.
19 Q. And then what about the '70s?
20 A. On the fundamental point of smoking being
21
hazardous to health, there were very, very, very few
Page 55depo of Lacy Ford
22 stories.
There were some new issues that came up in
23 the '70s, in which there were more scientific
24 disagreement about where there might be more stories,
25 but not related to lung cancer, which is the issue in
63
1
2
this particular case.
Q.
And then what about in terms of the
3 stories that did cover the adverse health affects of
4 smoking?
5
I think you said earlier that within those
6 stories, there would be a statement from the tobacco
7 companies or the tobacco institute disputing that or
8 saying that it had not yet been proven or they need
9 more research.
10
11
What percentage of articles contained
those types of statements that you know?
A.
I would say that probably of the hard news
12 stories, maybe one out of five to one out of four.
13 And of the total number of stories, closer to one out
14 of ten.
15 Q.
16
Something like that.
And those numbers, you believe are
consistent with your reliance materials?
17 MR. KOETHE:
18 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I would not necessarily say
19 that those, in terms if you're going to look
20 through my reliance materials and see if ten
21 percent of the articles have the statements in
22 there, I'm not claiming that at all because I'm
23 providing you reliance materials I might use as
24 illustrative at trial.
So it would be a
Page 5625
depo of Lacy Ford
different percentage, I think.
64
1

5
Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
What percentage do you
think is on your reliance materials?
A.
You know, I haven't attempted to ascertain
that, actually.
Q.
But in terms of your reliance materials,
6 these are the materials that you're going to rely
7 upon in giving your opinions at trial under oath to
8 the jury, correct?
9
A.
Well, in giving my opinions at trial and
10 particularly answering questions when crossed, I'll
11 rely on the entire body of material that I reviewed,
12 which goes well beyond this reliance list.
13
What I'm claiming for this list exactly --
14 whatever you want to call it.
15 Materials, the one that I have in front of me -- is
16 that it would be from this set of materials that I
17 would draw any demonstrative exhibits or draw quotes
18 to it or call direct attention to the jury in my
19 direct testimony.
20
It's called Sherman
That's all I'm claiming for this list.
21 it's a narrow body of material in which I would
22 answer questions based on my testimony at trial.
23
Q.
So
In your disclosure, it states that you are
24 expected to testify about the vast amount of
25 information communicated with the public concerning
65
Page 57depo of Lacy Ford
1
the health risks of smoking, correct?
2
3
4
A. I'm looking for the exact phrase, but,
Q. And in that vast amount of information you
yes.
5 indicate available to the public regarding the health
6 risks to smoking cigarettes, you believe you have
7 sufficient information within your reliance materials
8 to describe that to the jury?
9
A.
I think that, once again, I don't know --
10 I would characterize in my trial testimony the types
11 of stories you were talking about, just as I have
12 characterized them here.
13
I don't believe that I have not often
14 illustrated those in my trial testimony, and I don't
15 -- I haven't really begun to prepare the exact trial
16 testimony that I would give.
17 questions I were asked.
18 questions you're asking here today, I would give
19 those answers.
20
Q.
It would depend on what
If I were asked the
Do you dispute that there was a vast
21 amount of information available to the public
22 disputing the adverse affects of tobacco in the '50s
23 and the '60s?
24 MR. SUAREZ: Object to the form.
25 MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
66
1
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I would dispute that.
2 There was information, but it was a small part.
3 It was small in nature compared to the much
Page 584 depo of Lacy Ford
larger body of information affirming the health
5 hazards of smoking.
6 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
7 A.
It was not vast, as I understand your
8
9
It was not vast?
question, yes.
Q.
And in terms of the newspapers and the
10 magazines and the sources that you have cited between
11 the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, would you be surprised to
12 know that there were literally -- in your sources
13 that you cited to, would you be surprised to know
14 that there were literally thousands of articles where
15 the primary concern was disputing the health aspects
16 of smoking?
17 MR. KOETHE:
18 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
That would be inconsistent
19 with my research, yes.
20 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Okay.
And the same would
21 be -- I don't know if I asked you -- so it would be
22 inconsistent with your research that if we took
23 Newsweek, The New York Times, Fort Lauderdale News,
24 The Miami Herald, the Illinois paper, the Florida
25 newspapers, and the newspapers that you referenced
67
1 during the years that you referenced, 1951 through
2 1971, you would be surprised to learn that there were
3 over a thousand articles assuring people that smoking
4 was safe or not dangerous?
5 MR. KOETHE:
6 THE WITNESS:
7
Object to the form.
That is certainly a much
larger number of articles than I would
Page 59depo of Lacy Ford
8 recollect.
But whatever the number is, it is a
9 small number compared to the other number of
10 articles.
I'm hesitant to go with absolute
11 numbers.
12 as the ones you're referring to, were very few
13 in number.
14 Q.
But in percentage terms, articles such
(By Mr. Paige)
Can you give me a number,
15 when you say very few, what you would think it is
16 based upon your research?
17
18
19
MR. KOETHE:
Q.
Object to form.
(By Mr. Paige)
Or a range or an
approximation of a range?
20 MR. SUAREZ:
21 THE WITNESS:
Same objection.
I can probably answer your
22 question better within a narrower timeframe.
23 any given year -- just because it's easier to
24 deal with the numbers, let me preface that --
25 let's say, in any given year, let's say 1957,
In
68
1 you would find just a few articles, which
2 themselves focused on raising questions about
3 the health hazards that were a major sort of
4 articles that you would find in any single
5 newspaper, no more than a few.
6 than five.
7
Probably, less
Now, those same articles might appear in
8 different newspapers, but the same phenomenon
9 would apply to the 40 or 50 articles about the
10
health hazards.
Page 6011
Q.
depo of Lacy Ford
(By Mr. Paige) Well, you took some of the
12 articles that you have in your reliance materials and
13 have duplicated them when they were published in
14 multiple sources, have you not?
15 A. Yes; that's correct.
16 Q. You have some articles that have been
17 printed in ten different sources as ten different
18 reliance materials even though they're the same
19 article, correct?
20 MR. KOETHE:
21 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
Well, I wouldn't say that
22 exactly.
I mean, some things -- there are
23 reports that go out, say, about a scientific
24 finding, but there are several different wire
25 services.
All newspapers don't carry the same
69
1 portion of wire service stories.
2 they're not exactly the same.
3
So, you know,
What I would say is that a particular
4 scientific study is widely reported and, let's
5 say, the seven scientists reports that came out
6 in '56 or '57, I probably have a story about
7 that from several different newspapers, but it's
8 not necessarily exactly the same story, but it's
9 about the same subject matter.
10
Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Okay.
But would that be
11 the same rational when you're talking about the five
12 pro-health articles that you are stating?
13
14
MR. KOETHE:
Q.
Object to form.
(By Mr. Paige)
Let me rephrase.
Page 61
You knowdepo of Lacy Ford
15 what I mean, but I'll rephrase it so we're clear.
16 You were telling me before that there was an article
17 that came out that said smoking is not proven by the
18 AMA, something of that sort, and it was in the Fort
19 Lauderdale news.
20 That same story may be published in ten or
21 twenty different newspapers within the year, but it's
22 counted as one when you were telling me there's only
23 five in a particular year; is that correct?
24 MR. KOETHE:
25 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Well, since I was trying to
70
1 say in a particular year from a particular
2 source, it would have been counted singularly,
3 but I think that was consistent with the context
4 which I was presenting my answer.
5 trying to mislead you or anything.
6 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
I wasn't
No, that's fine.
But I'm
7 saying the same would hold true with some of your
8 reliance material that it is the -- even though you
9 might have in a particular year a hundred articles in
10 different sources, a lot of those are really the same
11 article over and over again, are they not?
12
A.
I wouldn't agree with the characterization
13 that they're the same article over and over again.
14 would say that they're the same scientific study or
15 the same point or the same statement being covered in
16 a different place in some way by that newspaper.
17 They're not all about different subjects.
Page 62

depo of Lacy Ford
For example, there was an article that
Q.
19 came out, "Facts Behind the Cigarette Scare," was the
20 title of the article.
21 the same date in the Orlando Sentinel and the Chicago
22 Daily Tribune, and it was published with the same
23 title in The Florida Times, the Chicago Daily
24 Tribune, again on 6/28.

5 similar.

All right.
Here's another story you have,

12 Palm Beach Post and then you have it on the same day,
13 another article, "British Doctors Agree Smoking is
14 the Cause of Smoking," in The Tampa Tribune.
15 are two different articles as far as you're
16 concerned?
17
A.
Those
Well, they're two different articles
18 reporting on the same finding of the British doctors.
19 I do that to illustrate how widely covered these
20 things were.
21 picked up by The New York Times. They're picked up
Page 63
These weren't things that were justdepo of Lacy Ford
22
23
in Orlando and Tampa, as well.
Q.
And then the five articles that may be
24 published a year saying that smoking does not cause
25 cancer or has not been proven to cause cancer in,
72
1 say, 1957, those articles were also widely
2 disseminated, as well, correct?

Q.
Did you include in your reliance materials

20 not cause lung cancer and it has not been proven that
21 it causes lung cancer?

When did you do your
research into these Florida and Illinois newspapers?
A.
It was done over a period of time
14 beginning in 1995 and probably ongoing to some
15 extent, but most of it would have been completed by
16 2006 or '07.
17 Q.
18
19
You didn't do any new research for these
cases for this case?
A.
Well, no, I wouldn't say that exactly.
My
20 research is always ongoing.
21 and I went back and consulted material, particularly
22 about Illinois and Florida, that I had not previously
23 -- or had not used in a long time, or in some cases,
24 probably hadn't previously used.
25
Q.
I read the depositions,
We can agree, and I'm going to go through
74
Page 65depo of Lacy Ford
1 some of your sources, we can agree that you did not
2 include all the articles in the Orlando Sentinel
3 where they said smoking was safe or the hazards of
4 smoking had not been proven in the 1950s or '60s,
5 correct?
6 MR. SUAREZ: Objection.
7 MR. KOETHE: Objection to form.
8 THE WITNESS:
9
Again, I think I had
explained how I made the decision to put the
10 material on this list, and it's not in an
11 all-inclusive list of either all articles that
12 do -- the many articles that emphasize the
13 health hazards of smoking nor is it all
14 inclusive of the few that take issue with that.
15 Q.
16
(By Mr. Paige)
So do you agree with it or
do you disagree with it?
17 MR. KOETHE: Objection to form.
18 MR. SUAREZ: Same objection.
19 THE WITNESS:
Would you repeat that part
20 of your question, please.
21 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
I'll rephrase it because
22 I'm going to ask you this question probably 15 or 20
23 times because I'm going to ask it in regards to each
24 source that you have.
25
I want to know, for The Florida
75
1 Times-Union, did you include all of the articles that
2 you came across in your research where it was noted
3 that smoking is safe or the hazards were not yet
Page 66depo of Lacy Ford
4
proven?
5 MR. KOETHE:
6 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Again, two issues in that
7 question.
I don't even necessarily recall
8 seeing an article that said smoking was safe.
9 do remember seeing some news coverage of people
10 making statements that the link between smoking
11 and lung cancer or other diseases had not been
12 proven, and I didn't include any articles from
13 any newspaper in the list that I provided you as
14 a possible basis for my testimony in the Sherman
15 case.
16 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
I
Professor, did you include
17 any articles from The Florida Times-Union where it
18 was reported that the hazards of smoking were not
19 proven?
20 A.
Without going through the list and looking
21 at all The Florida Times-Union articles I did put on
22 here, I couldn't give you a definitive answer.
23 Because stand-alone articles of that type were rare,
24 I tended to go with more representative materials.
25 think some of The Times-Union articles I include
I
76
1 would have statements to that effect within a larger
2 article, but not necessarily in the article itself.
3
Q.
Did you come across any articles in your
4 research of The Florida Times-Union where it was
5 reported in a stand-alone article that the hazards of
6 smoking were not yet proven that you did not include
7 in your reliance materials?

The same would be true for
the Orlando Evening Star?
14 MR. SUAREZ:
15 THE WITNESS:
Same objection.
Again, and I hate to rehash
16 this in every case, but I think I've explained
17 to you how I went through these sources and what
18 this list is supposed to cover.
19 would have not included every article of that
20 kind, but I didn't include every article of any
21 kind, as this is a selective -- by definition,
22 it's a narrower list than the entire body of
23 material I looked at.

Therefore, I
So would the same be true

no?

19 hazards of smoking pretty thoroughly, yes.

Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Do you have the
2 stand-alone articles in a separate area of your
3 office that you can provide?
4 A. No, I do not.
5 Q. If I ask you to provide the stand-alone
6 articles that you have copied but not included on
7 your reliance list, you could not provide that?
8 A. No, that's not what I said.
9 Q. Could you provide that?
10 A. All of my materials are filed by what we
11 refer to as providence.
12 newspapers are together.
13 basically, chronologically and not by topic.
14 would be my answer.
15 had a separate file of them, and I don't hold them in
16 a separate file.
17
18
Q.
In other words, all of the
And so they're filed,
That
I thought you were asking if I
(By Mr. Paige)
You included
advertisements on quitting aids, correct?
19 A. That's correct.
20 Q. You have a lot of different quitting aids
21 as I saw through your reliance list, would that be a
22 fair statement?
23 A. Yes, they're in there.
24 Q. And do you believe that the advertisements
25
for quitting aids help to shave public opinions and
83

beliefs that smoking was hazardous?
A.
I don't think I've included them for that
particular reason.
I've included them for --
4 Q. What is it?
5 A. I've included them primarily to show that
6 there have been programs and products -- I guess
7 would be the best word -- to help people to quit
8 smoking if they wanted to for a very long time.
9 that is really another aspect of my testimony.
And
It
10 would be only very indirectly that that would relate
11 to spreading the word about health hazards.
12 Q.
Do you know if any of those products
13 worked?
14 '50s and '60s, that they were really reliable
15 products to help people quit smoking?
The ones that you have relied upon from the
16 MR. SUAREZ:
17 THE WITNESS:
Objection to form.
I'm really not an expert on
18 the effectiveness of those products.
19 that from what I've read in doing my research
20 that some people who use them would credit them
21 with helping them quit smoking, but that's a far
22 cry from knowing whether the product was
23 effective or not.
24 Q.
25
(By Mr. Paige)
I know
Well, that was part of the
advertisement where they would take a statement from
84
1 somebody who used it to voice how great the product
2 was, correct?
3
A.
In some cases it was, yes.
Page 744
Q.
depo of Lacy Ford
But in terms of the reliability of the
5 Aquafilters or the other advertisements that you
6 cited to, you don't know whether they worked or not,
7 do you?
8 A.
9
10
I'm not in a position to testify about
their effectiveness, no.
Q.
But in terms of your opinions that you're
11 here for today, if I understand you correctly, it's
12 your belief that in reading, seeing those
13 advertisements, it would help people understand that
14 smoking is bad for you?
15
16
MR. KOETHE:
Q.
Objection.
(By Mr. Paige)
17 MR. KOETHE:
18 THE WITNESS:
Or could be bad for you?
Same objection.
I think that's not my answer
19 or not the way I would use these in testimony.
20 Certainly, one of the big emphases, particularly
21 in the public health community, once the health
22 hazards of smoking became widely known, what's
23 to encourage people to reduce those risks by
24 quitting and the fact that these products were
25 available and programs were available, you know,
85
1 since the 1950s and forward, I think my point
2 there is to indicate to the jury that the idea
3 of quitting has been collectively promoted,
4 really, as the statistical information about
5 lung cancer and smoking became widely known, and
6 so, too, has the quitting alternative been
7 promoted.
That's really the point that I offer.
Page 75depo of Lacy Ford
8

Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
of hand in hand.
All right.
They were kind
And I think either the articles or
10 the advertisements kind of tied the adverse health
11 effects into a reason why people should quit,
12 correct?
13
A.
Some, of them do, yes.
And in that way,
14 they would be tied to awareness in a kind of
15 secondary fashion.
16
Q.
But weren't there voluminous other
17 advertisements from the same time period for the
18 tobacco companies that also helped shape public
19 opinions and beliefs that smoking was glamourous and
20 not bad for you?
21 MR. KOETHE:
22 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Cigarettes were certainly a
23 widely advertised product in this time period.
24 I've seen no evidence that they suggested that
25 smoking was safe.
In fact, some of them even
86
1 indirectly raised the issue of health problems.
2 So I would agree with half of your proposition
3 that cigarettes are widely advertised, but I
4 would disagree that those advertisements
5 permitted the notion that smoking was healthy.
6 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
In your research, you
7 didn't see any advertisements in the '50s or '60s
8 assuring the public that smoking was healthy or safe?
9
10
MR. KOETHE:
THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
I saw some advertisements
Page 7611 depo of Lacy Ford
suggesting that people should try one brand
12 versus another, and this was mostly in the early
13 1950s and pretty much disappeared later on, but
14 none of them actually were suggested that --
15 none of them said, in my own view, that smoking
16 was safe.
17 brand.
18 Q.
It was just advertising a particular
(By Mr. Paige)
So you would be surprised
19 to see advertisements from the '50s where the
20 cigarette companies were advertising that their
21 cigarettes were safe?
22 MR. KOETHE:
23 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
Again, let me be clear.
I
24 think there were some advertisements in the
25 1950s, particularly the early 1950s, that one
87
1 might say had a health dimension of sorts.
2 as I've looked at those ads, the dimensions
3 seems to be that one brand might be preferable
4 to the other in terms of reduction of risks, but
5 none of that is a statement that smoking is
6 safe.
7 my answer concerning advertisements.
8 Q.
9
But
And so, I think that would certainly be
(By Mr. Paige)
You didn't see any
advertisements from cigarette companies that
10 contained statements from doctors or nurses that you
11 came across?
12 A.
13
14
I did see statements in advertisements
made by doctors and nurses.
Q.
Did you include any of those in your
Page 77depo of Lacy Ford
15 reliance materials in the sense that they may have
16 helped shape public opinions or public beliefs?
17 MR. KOETHE:
18 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Again, there's two answers
19 to that question.
I certainly considered
20 advertisements and their contents in arriving at
21 my opinion and examining the issues of the
22 public awareness and the health hazards of
23 smoking.
24 However, I did not include -- what I was
25 saying is I did not include any advertisements
88
1 on the lists of materials that I thought I might
2 make an exhibit out of or use as illustrative in
3 my direct exam at trial, but I do rely on my
4 review of advertising for my opinions.

12 more of this coughing issue and maybe I can try
13 to resolve that and won't interrupt all of your
14 concentration.
15 MR. PAIGE:
16 (Recess from 12:47 p.m. to 1:37 p.m.)
17
Q.
That's fine.
(By Mr. Paige)
Professor, the newspaper
Page 7818 depo of Lacy Ford
or magazines articles you have chosen, is it fair to
19 say that some were included during timeframes before
20 Mr. Sherman was even born?
21
22
23
A.
Yes.
Some of the items I've included date
before his birth.
Q.
And is it fair to say we can agree that he
24 did not review or rely upon any of those in forming
25 his beliefs as to whether or not smoking caused lung
89
1 cancer?
2 A.
Well, they are not included because I
3 would have anticipated he or others, even of his
4 generation, to have seen them directly, but I think
5 the development of this body of knowledge about the
6 health hazards of smoking was a cumulative process
7 that occurred over a number of years.
8
9
I'm trying to show you some examples how
there were very early indications that smoking was
10 bad for the health and how that informed people who
11 were of Mr. Sherman's parents' generation and even
12 maybe his grandparents' generation.
13
Q.
Okay.
So you're not saying the reliance
14 materials included on the first six or seven pages
15 were anything that Mr. Sherman ever saw or relied
16 upon, are you?
17 MR. KOETHE:
18 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
No, I'm not saying that he
19 might have, on the first six or seven pages,
20 seen those things himself, but people who taught
21 him in school might have seen them.
Page 79
His parentsdepo of Lacy Ford
22 might have been aware of them.
Certainly,
23 people of his parents' generation might have
24 seen some of them.
25 but some of them.
Obviously, not all of them,
90
1
Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
But which ones of his
2 parents saw or which ones of his teachers saw, would
3 be speculation on your part?
4
A.
Well, there was clearly a body of
5 knowledge out there by the time Mr. Sherman started
6 school that smoking was a health risk, and I'm trying
7 to show the basis for that and not trying to show
8 that he specifically had read things that were
9 published before he was born.
10
Q.
Okay.
And the same would be true, you
11 have a voluminous amount of materials on your list
12 that you're rely upon that did not exist until after
13 he passed away, correct?
14
15
A.
Let me check on that.
There are some
items on here, yes, after he passed away.
16
Q.
And you're not saying that he based his
17 beliefs on the adverse affects of smoking on those
18 articles or those sources, are you?
19
20
21
A. No, they're not included for that purpose,
Q. And then I know that you cited certain
no.
22 newspapers and certain magazines that you believe
23 that he personally read, correct?
24
A.
Yes.
Page 8025
Q.
depo of Lacy Ford
I'm not talking about the articles -- I
91
1 know you can't cite to which article he read nor
2 which newspaper -- but which newspapers, magazines,
3 or publications do you believe that Mr. Sherman was
4 reading during his lifetime?
5
A.
Well, from deposition testimony, we have
6 the fact that the Chicago Tribune and The Miami
7 Herald were newspapers that he read, and we also have
8 testimony that his wife read a number of magazines.
9 I think Life and Look were mentioned by one of the
10 people who gave depositions.
11 awareness was influenced not only by what he saw, but
12 what he talked about with other people.
13
Q.
And certainly, his
I understand that, but do you know if
14 Mr. Sherman ever read Life or Look in his entire
15 lifetime?
16
17
18
A.
I don't recall anybody saying that
directly, no.
Q.
So the publications in your reliance
19 materials that he did review, that we know that he
20 read, were the Chicago Tribune and The Miami Herald,
21 though, correct?
22
23
24
25
A.
Based on the deposition testimony, I
believe that's correct.
Q.
And of the articles that you pulled out
that you relied upon in the Chicago Tribune and The
92
Page 81depo of Lacy Ford
1 Miami Herald, can you cite me to the ones that you
2 know or you believe were specifically read by
3 Mr. Sherman, if at all?
4
A.
I can only go by the deposition testimony,
5 chiefly, of his wife that they were aware of the
6 articles coming out in the 1950s and that they were
7 certainly aware of the Surgeon General's Report.
8 I could cite you to those that reported on the
9 Surgeon General's Report based on his wife's
10
11
So
deposition.
Q.
Okay.
So Mrs. Sherman said that she and
12 her husband were aware of the 1965 Surgeon General
13 Report, correct?
14
15
16
A.
The Surgeon General's Report was '64, but
in that year.
Q.
'64, I apologize.
And the news of that
17 report was in the Chicago Tribune and The Miami
18 Herald in 1964 and for some time thereafter, correct?
19 A. Yes; that's correct.
20 Q. And the specific articles that he saw that
21 referenced the Surgeon General Report, it's fair to
22 say we don't know which ones they were, but we know
23 that they were included in those papers?
24 A. That's correct.
25 Q. Are there any other portions of the
93
1 Chicago Tribune or The Miami Herald that you can tell
2 me that Mr. Sherman personally read that you know of
3 that's based upon your review of the materials that
Page 824 depo of Lacy Ford
you're willing to testify to as you're sitting here
5 under oath?
6
A.
It was my impression, based on the
7 deposition testimony, that when he lived in Illinois,
8 he read The Tribune pretty regularly and also the
9 same is true of The Herald when he was living in
10
South Florida.
11
So he certainly would have ready access to
12 all the articles in that time period.
13 any deposition testimony that I could recall pointing
14 to perhaps a specific article.
15
16
Q.
There wasn't
Well, what he had access to and what he
read are two different things, correct?
17 A. Yes, that's true.
18 Q. Do you know whether or not, from your
19 reading of Mrs. Sherman's deposition, whether
20 Mr. Sherman read articles in the Chicago Tribune and
21 The Miami Herald where the article was geared towards
22 reporting on the fact that it had not yet been proven
23 that cancer is caused by smoking?
24
25
A.
I believe that Ms. Sherman did indicate --
I forget whether she had seen or she believed she had
94
1
2
seen some articles to that effect.
Q.
Did you make an effort to include those
3 articles in your reliance materials as they pertain
4 to Mr. Hess?
5 A. You mean Mr. Sherman?
6 Q. Mr. Sherman, I apologize.
7 A. The short answer to that would be no, I do
Page 83depo of Lacy Ford
8 not.
9 I had completed my review of her deposition.
10
At the time I prepared this list, I don't think
But in
any case, I did not.

Was Mr. Sherman aware of statements from
12 the tobacco representatives denying the adverse
13 health effects of cigarette smoke during the '50s and
14 '60s?
15 MR. KOETHE:
16 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I don't know if I can answer
17 that question as you asked.
I believe
18 Mrs. Sherman said that Mr. Sherman had seen some
19 articles which raised questions about some of
20 the studies.
21 say about that.
22 Q.
So that's about as much as I could

23 opinions, did you look at any of the internal tobacco

16 Society that was issuing pamphlets and

19 public knew.
20 Q.
I was trying to evaluate what the

Why do you think it was
21 important to review the public position and the
22 public opinion of the tobacco companies regarding the
23 adverse health effects of smoking.
24
25
A.
Well, I guess I thought it was important
to, in understanding what was public knowledge and
96
1 what was commonly available and readily available to
2 people, I was looking at all things that came into
3 the public domain.
4
In those instances, like newspaper
5 comments, which they were in the public domain, I
6 certainly included those analyses.
7 information that was like the larger body of
8 information indicating otherwise that was available

That was
So it was necessary to consider that
information as part of what was public information.
Q.
I appreciate that.
You're aware of
12 newspaper articles and interviews given by the
13 tobacco representatives where they stated their
14 position on the health hazards of tobacco and you

15 factor them into your equation in reaching your
16 opinion, although, some of those or many of those may
17 not specifically be in your reliance materials; is
18 that a fair statement?

And at the time that Mr. Koethe retained
4 you in this case or prior thereto, you had a
5 discussion with him about the Engle decision?

Well, I think the essence of that decision
7 is that essentially there could, at some time in the

10 would it be possible that I would be available to be

cancer and many other diseases.
So I'm not saying that I didn't say
3 anything that the company said or published.

5 that I saw, they were usually other people
6 saying them.
7 people, but other people saying them.
Page 91
To
Maybe not the majority of other
I mean, Idepo of Lacy Ford
8 don't think that I would be in a position to
9 determine if any of those statements were false.
10
So in some ways, that is kind of
11 inconsistent with my testimony in the case.
12 on the other hand, I don't think I was
13 testifying directly on the subject that you're
14 asking about.
15 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Okay.
But
So from a
16 historical perspective, you're unable to cite me to
17 one thing that was published from R.J. Reynolds or
18 Philip Morris that was false or misleading?
19 MR. KOETHE:
20 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Well, I wouldn't want to
21 agree to that in such a blanket form.
I think
22 one runs across what I would call inaccurate
23 statements.
24 you believe to be inaccurate or some things that
25 are proven later to be simply wrong.
Perhaps, there are statements that
104
1
Most of the things that I saw in the
2 public press were things that were, I guess at
3 some level, understandable or defensible
4 assertions as far as I could tell even though
5 they were not widely held.
6 Q.
7
(By Mr. Paige)
were they making that you think were defensible?
8 MR. KOETHE:
9 THE WITNESS:
10
What inaccurate statements
Object to form.
Again, I'm not saying that I
could identify one, but I'm sure that somewhere
Page 9211 depo of Lacy Ford
in this broad body of material, there might be
12 something of that effect.
13 want to agree with your assertion.
14
That's why I didn't
The main line of things that were said
15 repetitively in the public domain by the
16 companies were things like statistics don't
17 cause causation, which I think is something that
18 most people believe, but statistics do indicate
19 risk pretty effectively.
20
To the individual smoker, risk is what
21 matters.
They constantly said more research was
22 needed and more research was needed and was
23 done.
24 diseases for which smoking was believed by the
25 public health community to be a risk factor.
And ultimately, they discovered new
105
1
So I think those main lines of arguments
2 that I saw repetitively, had people not
3 associated with the companies also taking them
4 at that time.
5 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
But did you consider those
6 statements to be misleading or not misleading?
7 That's what I would like to know.
8 MR. BATISTA:
9 MR. KOETHE:
10
Objection.
Object to form.
THE WITNESS:
Well, in some ways, for my
11 purposes, I was just testifying to the fact that
12 they were made.
13 conclusion about whether they were misleading or
14 not and in what context you would make that
Page 93
It wasn't my job to reach adepo of Lacy Ford
15 decision.
16 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Well, actually, you said
17 that they were not false or misleading, but they were
18 inaccurate but defensible.
19 sure that I'm clear that you not consider any
20 statements to be misleading based upon all of the
21 extensive research that you had done; is that
22 correct?
23 MR. KOETHE:
24 THE WITNESS:
25
So I just want to make
Object to form.
Again, I think that it just

3 that were made.

I'm trying to talk about what
I'm trying to convey to you that, to the
5 extent that I can recall them all, the
6 statements that were made in the public domain
7 by the company were supported by some scientist
8 or somebody else at that time.
9 gives them some sort of sense that they were not
Which, to me,
10 isolated with the company.
11 they were misleading is not something that I
12 testified about then or it seems that I would be
13 likely to testify now.
14
The finding that
All this information was out there.
The
15 positions that the companies were taking ran
16 contrary to the main thrust of the information,
17 that is true.
Page 9418
Q.
depo of Lacy Ford
(By Mr. Paige) But you've researched and
19 you have found -- and I reviewed your reliance
20 materials -- based upon your reliance material you
21 know that millions of smokers in the '60s and the
22 '70s believed the contrary information that was put
23 out by the tobacco companies, don't you?
24 MR. SUAREZ: Object to the form.
25 MR. KOETHE: Object to form.

THE WITNESS:
Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
No, I don't know that.
So you dispute that?
3 MR. BATISTA: Object to form.
4 THE WITNESS: All the evidence I've seen
5 indicates, in fact, that very few people, a very
6 low percentage of people, looked to the tobacco
7 companies for information about health.
8 Q.
9
10
11
(By Mr. Paige)
And how many people in the
1960s believe that it had not yet been proven that
cigarettes cause lung cancer?
A.
I believe in 1969, there was probably
12 around 20 percent, or maybe slightly higher than that
13 of the population who, for one reason or another, did
14 not believe that it had been proven that cigarettes
15 cause lung cancer.
16 those people didn't think that it increased the
17 health risks, but --
18 Q.
19 though.
20 people?
21 A.
It doesn't even mean that all of
I want to know how many people it was,
Percentages don't mean much to me.
How many
Well, I'll have to go back and drag.
Page 95
Thedepo of Lacy Ford
22 American population at that time was, what, about 180
23 million, but then you narrow that down to adults.
24 Percentages mean a lot more to me, and I tend to talk
25 in terms of percentages.
108
1
Q.
But I'm asking the questions, most
2 respectively, and I would like to know.
3 important to know how many people it was.
4 could tell me how many people in 1969 did not yet

A.
To me, it's

If not, we can get to it a
I would have to make a rough estimate
would be the best I could give you at that time.
11 Q. All right.
That would be acceptable.
12 A. I would say the population of the United
13 States at that time was around 200 million.
14 Something around 20 percent would be 40 million, but
15 many of those would be children.
16 to 25 millions adults, probably.
17
18
19
Q.
So it would be 20
When did Mr. Sherman begin smoking?
What
year?
A.
I believe, according to the deposition
20 testimony, it was about 1944.
21 it was when he got out of the Navy, maybe in '46,
22 that he became a heavy smoker.
23
24
Q.
And others said that
And when did he first believe that
cigarettes caused lung cancer based upon your review

A.
I don't think I could answer that question
2 because I have sort of no way of knowing what he
3 believed and did not believe.

5
Q.
You testified in what phase of the Engle
trial?
6 A. It was phase one, as I recall it.

not, from phase one?
13 MR. KOETHE:
Object to form.
14 THE WITNESS:
I mean, I'm trying to tell
15 you what I know.
I know that the Engle verdict
16 was generally in favor of the plaintiffs.
17 details of it and what break down in phases, I
18 don't have a lot of specific knowledge of that.
19 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
The
You testified, in phase
20 one as a historian, and Mr. Rosenblatt had a
21 different historian who testified in phase one for
22 the plaintiffs, correct?
23
A.
It is not my recollection that
24 Mr. Rosenblatt had a historian testify, but I could
25 be wrong about that.
I didn't hear any of his
110
Page 97depo of Lacy Ford

witnesses testify.
Q.
In reading the Engle decision, is it your
3 position and your belief that the jury in Engle
4 accepted and believed your position or they rejected
5 your position?
6 MR. KOETHE:
Object to form.
7 THE WITNESS:
Again, I did not read the
8 Engle decision.
I presented my testimony about

10 cigarette smoking to the jury.

12 my testimony played one way or the other in
13 their verdict.

That was a big
If you can, from a
15 historical perspective, just tell me about your
16 understanding of lung cancer in the United States
17 between 1900 and 1950, how it changed.
18 MR. SUAREZ:
19 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Well, again, with a caveat
20 that I'm speaking as a historian and not a
21 medical expert, the incidents of lung cancer
22 began to go up in the United States early in the
23 20th century and then spiked fairly considerably
24 in the time period between 1930 and '50 and
25 continued to rise for a while thereafter.
111
1
As a result, it got -- it's a
2 life-threatening and life-ending disease that
3 was becoming more common and got a lot of public
Page 984 depo of Lacy Ford
attention in the media and otherwise.
5 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
6 A.
In the '50 and '60s.
In the '50 and '60s?
The attention it got
7 began to increase even earlier than that, but not to
8 the extent that it increased in the early 1950s.
9
10
11
Q.
And how prevalent was lung cancer, say, in
1900?
A.
Again, I'm not a medical expert, and I
12 couldn't really answer that, but it was not nearly as
13 common as it became later.
14
Q.
Well, you could agree from a historical
15 perspective that lung cancer was very rare at the
16 turn of the century?
17
18
19
20
A.
Well, I would certainly say it was much
more uncommon than it later became.
Q.
You wouldn't agree from a historical
perspective that it was extremely rare?
21 MR. KOETHE:
22 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
I probably haven't examined
23 the issue of how common it was closely enough in
24 1900.
25 the increase, but it was certainly much less
I was more concerned with the pattern of
112
1 common.
2 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
And what about smoking
3 cigarettes, how prevalent was that around 1900 in the
4 United States?
5
A.
Well, in 1900, cigarettes were a fairly --
6 at least, kind of mass produced, cigarettes, as we
7 came to know them in the '50s and '60s, were a
Page 99depo of Lacy Ford
8 relatively new product and they were fairly quickly
9 growing more popular in that time.
10
Q.
I think just in terms of my knowledge,
11 now, I think it's about 15 percent of adults that
12 smoke; is that correct?
13
14
A.
I think the last figure I saw was 18 or
19, but something in that ballpark.
15 Q.
16 smoked?
17 A.
18 around that.
19 Q.
20
21
And in 1950, about 50 percent of adults
Yeah.
Maybe just under that, but right
And then 1900, what percentage that you're
familiar with?
A.
I don't think that I have any reliable
22 data for 1900, but it was, as I say, cigarettes were
23 relatively a new product.
24 on as a major national commercial product in the
25 first couple of decades of the 20th century.
It was beginning to catch
I
113
1 couldn't give you a percentage would be the short
2 answer.
3 Q.
Okay.
But we would agree as more people
4 started smoking, doctors started seeing more cases of
5 lung cancer?
6 A.
7
Yes; that's correct.
MR. PAIGE:
I apologize, I know we just
8 took a break, but can we take another break,
9 Paul?
10
MR. KOETHE:
Sure.
Page 100depo of Lacy Ford
Thanks.
11 MR. PAIGE:
12 (Recess from 2:14 p.m. to 2:19 p.m.)
13
Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Were cigarettes
14 popularized in America during World War I, and, if
15 so, can you explain to me how?
16
A.
Yes, I would say cigarettes grew popular
17 during the World War I era and they continued to grow
18 popular in the 1920s.
19 conveniently consumed form of tobacco than chewing
20 tobacco and cigars and snuff and that sort of thing.
21 And as the economy changed, more factory jobs, you
22 couldn't keep a cigar in your mouth for the whole day
23 and that sort of thing.
24 That was a broad and continuing process, actually.
25
Q.
They were a cleaner and more
People shifted to tobacco.
But did you learn anything or see anything
114
1 in your historical research as to what extent, if
2 any, World War I had on popularizing cigarettes in
3 America at that time?
4
A.
I think there's sort of a question as to
5 whether how much they popularized it.
Cigarettes
6 were certainly very much a part of military life in
7 World War I and American soldiers wanted cigarettes.
8 And a number of groups and organizations, including
9 the Army itself which supported the troops, made
10 cigarettes available to them.
11 soldiers, you know, continued to smoke after the war,
12 as well.
13
14
Many of those
So it's kind of a chicken and an egg
argument regarding World War I and smoking in that
Page 101depo of Lacy Ford
15 regard.
16 Q.
But at that time, we can agree it was
17 generally not accepted or not common knowledge that
18 cigarettes caused lung cancer?
19
A.
Well, there was certainly a lot of
20 information at that time from people who were
21 concerned about this growing percentage of Americans
22 who smoked that it was habit forming or addictive and
23 bad for your health, but the lung cancer issue arose
24 later.
25
Q.
My question is, do you think it was common
115
1 knowledge in the 1920s or 1930s that cigarettes
2 caused lung cancer?
3 MR. SUAREZ: Object to form.
4 MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
5 THE WITNESS:
Certainly, cigarette smoking
6 can be associated in some people's mind with
7 cancer and life-shortening diseases by the 1920s
8 and '30s.
9 about lung cancer specifically based on
The primary research and publicity
10 statistics began around 1948 or '50.
11 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
When I'm asking about
12 common knowledge, do you know what I'm talking about
13 or am I talking a language you don't understand?
14 A. No, I understand that.
15 Q. When I'm saying common language, you
16 understand I'm not talking about some people or a few
17 people, do you not?
Page 10218 A. depo of Lacy Ford
Yes; that's correct.
19 Q. Okay.
So my question to you is quite
20 simple and I think you answered it in a roundabout
21 way, and I don't know why you're answering in a
22 roundabout way rather than answering my question, but
23 respectively my question is, do you believe that it
24 was common knowledge to the public in the 1920s that
25 cigarettes caused lung cancer?
116
1 MR. KOETHE:
2 THE WITNESS:
I object to the form.
In the 1920s, I don't
3 believe that lung cancer was central to the
4 public's information about the hazards of
5 smoking.
6 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
7 MR. KOETHE:
8 THE WITNESS:
9
10
11
So the answer would be no?
Object to the form.
The answer would be just
what I said.
Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
I don't understand you.
Was it common knowledge or not?
12 MR. KOETHE:
13 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
I would say that it was
14 common knowledge in the '20s that smoking was
15 hazardous to your health, but I don't think you
16 could necessarily break out its association with
17 lung cancer as a single component of that larger
18 hazardous notion in the 1920s.
19 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
When I'm taking about lung
20 cancer, I'm assuming that you know what I'm talking
21 about, don't you, Professor?
Page 103depo of Lacy Ford
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. I assure you I'm going to talk about all
24 the other health hazards you're wanting to talk about
25 like stunting your growth, and coughing, and getting
117
1 your wind, or whatever you want to talk about, but
2 right now --
3
MR. SUAREZ:
Gary, just ask your question.
4 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
-- I want to talk about
5 lung cancer.
6 and you can answer it quite template, I think we both
7 know the answer, is it your opinion it was common
8 knowledge to the public in the 1920s that smoking
9 cigarettes caused lung cancer?
So my question to you, respectfully,
10 MR. KOETHE:
11 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
Again, I would just say that
12 if you limit it to lung cancer, that was not
13 probably a large enough -- it was only one
14 component of a larger sense of cigarettes having
15 danger, and I don't know that I could answer.
16 I could probably not say that lung cancer
17 alone was common knowledge in the 1920s, but it
18 was part of a larger knowledge.
19 distinction I'm trying to make.
20 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
That's the only
I'm sure you would opine
21 there came a time when it became common knowledge
22 that cigarettes caused lung cancer, correct?
23 MR. KOETHE:
24 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
Yes, sir; that's correct.
Page 10425
depo of Lacy Ford
(By Mr. Paige) But that time was not the
Q.
118
1
1920s, was it?
2
3
A.
If you limit it to lung cancer alone, I
would say that I couldn't say it's in the 1920s, no.
4
Q.
Do you think it was in the '30s?
5 MR. KOETHE:
6 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
With all of the same
7 qualifications, I would say, again, that there's
8 a growing awareness of the health hazards of
9 cigarettes, but it's probably not focused on
10 lung cancer until the late 1940s or the early
11 1950s.
12 Q.
13
So was it in the '30s or
not?
14
15
(By Mr. Paige)
MR. KOETHE:
Object to the form.
Asked
and answered.
16
THE WITNESS:
Well, I think I just
17 answered that.
I would say, no, as a single
18 component, not in the 1930s.
19 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Okay.
You answered it
20 that time, thank you.
21 talking about that -- well, I'll get to that in a
22 couple of pages.

There was
Was there also an effort
to encourage it that you're aware of?
11 MR. KOETHE:
12 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
There was certainly a lot of
13 competition between brands and for shares of the
14 growing market, but I guess I'm not an expert on
15 the underlying consumer choice about why
16 cigarettes became popular.
17 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
So you have an opinion
18 that it was discouraged, but you don't have an
19 opinion as to whether or not it was encouraged?
20 MR. KOETHE:
21 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
Well, I agree that it was a
22 consumer product that was growing in popularity.
23 I just don't have enough evidence to know why,
24 beyond speculating on obvious reasons for it,
25 that people like it.
People recommended it to
120
1 other people.
It was a competitively marketed
2 product, and all of those reasons.
3 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
There was a lot of
Page 1064
depo of Lacy Ford
advertising that you're aware of, correct?
5 A. There was advertising, yes.
6 Q. It was advertised as something that was
7 very glamorous to do and very masculine for men to
8 do, correct?
9
MR. KOETHE:
10
Object to the form.
THE WITNESS:
Well, those are depictions
11 of advertising, which probably are the realm of
12 an advertising expert rather than me, but they
13 were certainly a frequently advertised product.
14 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
There were the health
15 concerns in the '20s, '30s, and '40s, I think you
16 were saying, about cigarettes, but not necessarily
17 lung cancer, correct?
18 A. Yes, health concerns in the '20s and '30s.
19 Q. And some of those health concerns -- I can
20 go through some of them -- were no more cough.
There
21 was a lot of advertising about causing coughing; is
22 that correct?
23 MR. BATISTA: Object to the form.
24 THE WITNESS: Those are not primarily the
25
kind of health concerns I was referring to
121
1 earlier.
2 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Well, I'm going to go
3 through a whole list, but you're not aware of the
4 health concern of cigarettes causing people to
5 cough --
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. -- in the '20s, '30s, and '40s?
Page 107depo of Lacy Ford
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. And are you aware of the fact that certain
10 cigarettes advertised that their brand would cause no
11 more cough in the '20s, '30s, and '40s?
12 A. Or less coughing, yes.
13 Q. Are you aware of the fact that people were
14 concerned that it would stunt their growth in the
15 '20s '30s, and '40s?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. And are you aware of the fact that in the
18 '20s, '30s, and '40s the cigarette companies were
19 advertising using doctors and nurses as spokespersons
20 for their product?
21 MR. KOETHE:
22 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
I'm aware that endorsements
23 from doctors and nurses were present in the
24 advertisements, yes.
25 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
And the message that was
122
1 getting out to the public domain was that their
2 product was safe for consumption, correct?
3 MR. KOETHE:
4 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
Well, I don't know that I
5 could -- I think, would I entirely agree with
6 your proposition, I think doctors were saying
7 that they preferred this brand.
8 brand.
9
10
They liked this
The nurses were saying the same thing.
They also had been saying in that time
period, in the early '20s and '30s, that this
Page 10811 depo of Lacy Ford
brand causes less cough, but I don't think that
12 those are claims that it's entirely safe.
13 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Why do you think it would
14 be important to have a doctor as opposed to a
15 policeman saying that he preferred one brand over
16 another?
17 of good health?
You don't think that that shows a picture
18 MR. SUAREZ: Object to the form.
19 MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
20 THE WITNESS:
Again, I think that gets
21 into an interpretation of the advertisement that
22 might be beyond my area, but I understand the
23 logic of your question.
24
25
A wide range of people, including a
tobacco growers or tobacco buyers, were featured
123
1 in these ads.
So it wasn't simply a focus on
2 doctors and nurses or health professionals of
3 any kind.
4 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Do you believe that there
5 was a common knowledge or belief in the public that
6 smoking caused growth stunt or more coughing in the
7 '20s, '30s, and '40s?
8 MR. BATISTA:
9 MR. KOETHE:
10
THE WITNESS:
Objection to form.
Object to form.
I don't know that I could
11 opine about whether that was common knowledge.
12 It was certainly a message that was communicated
13 in school textbooks and other things in that
14 period.
There were even statistical studies
Page 109depo of Lacy Ford
15 showing, or at least inferring, that smokers
16 didn't grow to be as tall or as healthy as
17 nonsmokers.
18 Q.
19
(By Mr. Paige)
When did the public really
start hearing about smoking and cancer?
20 MR. KOETHE:
21 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
Well, even some of these
22 earliest reports about cancer connected smoking
23 to lip cancer, to throat cancer, and possibly
24 other kinds of cancer.
25 the lung cancer connection began in 1948 and '50
The focus of smoking and
124
1 and really intensified over the next decade or
2 so.
3 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
What was the first major
4 publication where it was reported linking cigarettes
5 to lung cancer that was widely read?
6 MR. KOETHE:
7 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Well, without agreeing that
8 this is the first major publication, Reader's
9 Digest was the most widely read publication,
10 which addressed the smoking and lung cancer
11 connection.
12 it pretty fulsomely from there on, really, to
13 the next few decades.
14 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
15 A.
There was, I think, a mention of it in
It began in 1950/1952 and covered
Was that 1950 or 1952?
16 1950, and then the beginning of ongoing coverage
17 about 1952.
Page 11018
Q.
depo of Lacy Ford
So would it be fair to say, the beginning
19 of shaping the public knowledge or the public beliefs
20 that cigarette caused lung cancer in the public
21 domain began more or less in 1952?
22 MR. KOETHE:
Object to form.
23 THE WITNESS:
Well, I do want to add the
24 caveat that the notion that cigarette smoking
25 could shorten life by causing a variety of
125
1
diseases was well known before 1952.
2
Certainly, during the early 1950s, the
3 focus on the connection between cigarette
4 smoking and lung cancer became broadly, you
5 know, pervasively discussed almost in the
6 public.
7 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
So the broad discussion
8 where people started to believe that cigarettes
9 caused lung cancer in the public domain began more or
10 less in 1952, correct?
11 MR. KOETHE:
12 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
I would say that the broad
13 discussion about cigarettes and lung cancer took
14 shape in the early 1950s, yes.
15 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
But you were saying before
16 that time there was information in the public domain
17 that cigarettes would cause death in other ways, but
18 not by lung cancer, correct?
19
A.
Well, I think including lung cancer, but
20 not focused on that.
I wouldn't exclude lung cancer
21 from it because obviously the information gets
Page 111depo of Lacy Ford
22 greater -- comes down in perhaps greater specificity
23 later.
24 There were widely publicized studies that
25 life insurance companies had discovered that smokers
126
1 didn't live as long as nonsmokers in the 1930s.
2 would embrace all manners of diseases including
3 smokers who died of lung cancer, but it wasn't
4 focused on lung cancer as the reports later became.
5
6
Q.
That
Was Mr. Sherman exposed to those insurance
company reports that you're referring to?
7 A.
Well, these were published in Reader's
8 Digest.
9 through the period.
They were often repeated in school textbooks
So it's entirely possible that
10 he and his classmates and others he knew were, in
11 fact, exposed to it.
12
Q.
So you're saying, before 1952, the public
13 belief was that cigarettes would kill you, but then
14 in 1952, it came out that cigarettes would kill you
15 by lung cancer?
16 MR. SUAREZ:
17 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
I think the emphasis on the
18 health risks of lung cancer came out in the
19 1950s.
20 public information, some public information,
21 before 1952.
22 studies reinforced studies in that time period.
23 Q.
24
There was certainly a little bit of
It sort of gained some momentum as
(By Mr. Paige)
When it came out that
cigarettes caused lung cancer in 1952, that was big
Page 112depo of Lacy Ford
25
news, correct?
127
1
A.
It was big news.
The Wynde-Graham Study
2 that made the biggest news that came out before 1952
3 and was covered in many many newspapers around the
4 country, that wasn't just 1952.
5 '49/'50, going into '52/'54.
6
Q.
That's 1950,
So, if I understand you correctly, there
7 was information in the public domain before 1952 that
8 cigarettes, you know, could be bad for you.
9 could stunt your growth.
They
It could do these other
10 things.
There's a variety of ways that possibly
11 cigarettes could be bad for you, but the emphasis
12 that the public really stood up and took notice that
13 cigarettes could really have health effects was in
14 the 1950s?
15 MR. KOETHE:
16 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
Again, I just couldn't say
17 correct to the question as you phrased it.
18 I would say is that there became an intense
19 focus on the health risks of cigarette smoking
20 beginning in 1950 and continuing onward over the
21 next several decades.
22 Q.
23
(By Mr. Paige)
What
So you would describe it
as an intense focus?
24 A. Yes, I think that would be fair.
25 Q. So how would you describe it prior to that
128
Page 113depo of Lacy Ford
1
2
time period then, if I could just compare the two?
A.
There was a broader concern about the
3 health effects of smoking that was not focused on
4 lung cancer, primarily.
5
6
7
Q.
But was it an intense focus that was
focused in the media?
A.
It was a major message about smoking in
8 school textbooks in every part of the country that
9 I've looked at.
So I think that's pretty important,
10 but it wasn't the kind of breaking news story that it
11 became in the 1950s as these statistical studies, one
12 after another, showed strong associations between
13 cigarette smoking and lung cancer.
14
15
16
Q.
Was it covered in Mr. Sherman's school
textbooks?
A.
I have reviewed the textbooks that were
17 approved for use in the Chicago area at the time he
18 was in school, and in every case, I believe there is
19 some admonition about the health hazards of smoking
20 and cautioning people against tobacco use at least
21 until they become adults and can make an appropriate
22 decision for themselves.
23
Q.
Well, part of the reason they wanted
24 people to wait until they got older was because of
25 the concern that it would stunt your growth, correct?
129
1 MR. KOETHE: Object to form.
2 MR. SUAREZ: Object to the form.
3 THE WITNESS:
I don't know that I could
Page 1144 depo of Lacy Ford
break it out with that specificity, but I think
5 the larger message about waiting to make a
6 decision is that it was a fairly big decision.
7 It could affect the health of your lifetime and
8 they wanted people to be more mature when they
9 made that decision.
10
Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
And you believe that was
11 in Mr. Sherman's textbooks that he read when he was
12 in school?
13
14
15
16
17
18
A.
It was certainly in the Illinois and
Chicago area textbooks in that time period, yes.
Q.
Tell me the admonition that you remember
from his textbooks.
A.
I don't know that I could be that specific
off the top of my head.
19 Q. Is it in your reliance materials?
20 A. The textbooks are listed in the reliance
21
materials, yes.
22 Q. The ones that Mr. Sherman saw?
23 A. The ones that are approved for use in the
24 Chicago area and in the state of Illinois during the
25 time he was in school, yes.
130
1
Q.
And generally, what is your belief that
2 those textbooks said a general manner?
3 generally what you recollect about them?
4
A.
Can tell me
In a general manner, they point out that
5 smoking is extremely habit forming or addictive --
6 and I'm using that word in a non-medical sense -- and
7 that once people start, they have difficulty to quit.
Page 115depo of Lacy Ford
8 They're using this to encourage people not to start,
9 because if they change their mind, they could have
10
difficulty quitting.
11
The second message is that there could be
12 serious health risks from smoking.
13 that, you know, it's expensive.
14 It's not socially acceptable in some circles.
15 employers don't want to have smokers.

21
Q.
And the third is
It causes cough.
Some
There's a
Some are more emphasized in some books
What grade or grades was he advised about
the habit-forming problems with smoking?
A.
Generally, and my recollection of the
22 books, is those start appearing about fourth grade
23 and continue through junior high and high school.
24
25
Q.
And the same would be with the health
risks?
131
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. And the textbooks that you have cited that
3 include that information are textbooks that you
4 believe that he read or was exposed to personally?
5
A.
Yes, there were textbooks that were
6 approved for use in the Illinois and Chicago schools
7 in the time period that he was in school.
8
9
10
Q.
Were those books, I know they were
approved, but were those books that his school used?
A.
Unless they were using unapproved books,
Page 11611 depo of Lacy Ford
which I have no reason to think that they would, they
12 would chose from the approved list of books.
13
14
Q.
Okay.
So you've included everything from
the approved list?
15 A. Yes, I have.

I've also included a number
132
1 of textbooks from a later period for the time
2 his children might have been in school, for
3 example.
4 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Can you tell me the ones
5 on page eight which are the textbooks you believe he
6 was or may have been exposed to in school?
7
A.
The Burkard book, item 209, was one that
8 was approved for use in Illinois and Chicago; 209 and
9 210, I believe.
10 Q. What grades were those for?
11 A. 210 is for grade six.
12
13
14
And I believe the
Burkard book may have been for an older group.
Q.
Do you know what grade Mr. Sherman was in
in 1931?
Page 117depo of Lacy Ford
15
A.
Well, in 1931, he would have been -- I
16 don't think he would have started school.
17 textbooks are generally adopted and used for a five-
18 to eight-year period after they're adopted.
19 the areas are longer than that.

Did you look into how long they used the
Health and Human Welfare book after it was adopted?

25 particular book was approved for use.

I'm not interested in the textbooks in
Florida at that time period, just Chicago.

A.
Yes, I don't see anything else on page

Let me indicate to you that I made an effort, I
12 believe, in dealing with Illinois textbooks here,
13 dealing with textbooks on the list, to just include
14 books that were approved for use in either Florida or
15 Illinois during the appropriate time period.

I don't think that there are any books on

Well, if you do pursue it, will you let us
19 know through your lawyers so we could talk to you

17 on a document, which I did not have the
18 opportunity to review in context that included
19 that statement.
20
I do believe I've been cross-examined
My response to it then, which is my
21 response to it now, is that I don't know whether
22 such an effort was made, but if it was, it
23 failed in a fairly grand manner because people
24 were well aware of the health risks of smoking.
25 Some people decided to smoke anyway, but they

23 There have been, I think, more public
24 pressure against smoking and, you know, limiting
25 where you can smoke and that sort of thing.
And I
142
1 think, frankly, based on some evidence I've seen,
2 that once people know someone who has either suffered

deposition testimony that I read, and particularly
19 that of his wife, I believe that they were following
20 the stories that came out on the press and on
21 television about the health hazards of smoking.

Well, isn't that how the
filtered cigarette was advertised in the '50s?
5 MR. KOETHE:
6 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
Well, there were a lot of
7 different ways filtered cigarettes were
8 advertised in the '50s.
9 did say that filters might be safer.
And some, in the ads,
And,
10 indeed, some of the scientists thought filters
11 could be safer, but safer didn't mean that they
12 ended all of the risk.
13 filters made that point pretty clearly.
14 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
The publicity around
Did some of the
15 advertisements in the early '50s market filters as a
16 safe cigarette?
17 MR. KOETHE:
18 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
No.
I think some of the
19 advertisements in the '50s marketed filters as
20 perhaps a safer cigarette.
21 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
In your research, did you
Page 127depo of Lacy Ford
22 see that there was a controversy in the '50s?
There
23 were some people saying that cigarettes caused lung
24 cancer and other people, including the tobacco
25 companies with the Frank Statement, saying it had not

been proven, correct?
A.
Yes, there were people saying that it had
not been proven.
Q.
And there were some people who believed
5 that cigarettes cause lung cancer and they tried to
6 quit or they quit at that time, and there were other
7 people who didn't believe or didn't know what to
8 believe at that time, correct?
9
MR. KOETHE:
10
Object to form.
THE WITNESS:
Well, there are a lot of
11 components to that question.
12 we always know why people decided to quit.
13 there were people who would quit in response --
14 according to the information in response to the
15 health information and maybe others who quit for
16 other reasons.
17
I'm not sure that
Yes,
I don't hold myself up as an expert on all
18 the reasons why people quit, but certainly
19 concern about health was a very plausible reason
20 for people to quit.

22 So if you want to go ahead, ask a different
23 question.

1 aware of the facts, through your historical research,
2 that there were people in the '50s who were unsure as
3 to whether smoking caused lung cancer or not and they
4 switched to filters as a precaution just to be safe,
5 in case?
6 MR. KOETHE:
7 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
I don't know that I could
8 link the two parts of your question.
9 were people in the 1950s who, by all evidence,
10 were well aware of the studies showing smoking
11 to be a risky behavior who did not believe that
12 smoking necessarily caused lung cancer.
13 there were those people.
14
Yes, there
Yes,
And I read that there were people who
15 decided to switch to filters to try to, for the
16 purpose of perhaps smoking a cigarette, that
17 would not being as hazardous.
18 was a lot of publicity out there that that was
19 not true.
20 could necessarily do.
21 Q.
Although, there
To link those two is not something I

Okay.
Do you know if
22 Mr. Sherman switched filters because he was trying to
23 be cautious in case there was actually a link that he
24 was uncertain about?

(By Mr. Paige)
Did the tobacco companies
know that cigarettes caused lung cancer in 1953?
6 MR. KOETHE:
7 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
Again, as I said before,
8 except to the extent that information went to
9 the public domain, I can't testify as to what
10 the tobacco companies knew.
11 certainly lots of reports out there in 1953 that
12 cigarette smoking raised one's risk of getting
13 lung cancer.
14 saying at that time that they didn't think a
15 causal link had been proven.
16 Q.
17
18
There were
And the tobacco companies were
(By Mr. Paige)
What was the Frank
Statement?
A.
The Frank Statement was a paid
19 advertisement that appeared in a number of newspapers
20 all across the country taken out by a number, not
21 all, but a number of tobacco companies basically
22 saying that recent scientific data was raising this
23 question in a serious manner.
24 that the scientific studies were accurate and they
25 were going to provide money for further research.
They weren't convinced
147
1
Q.
All right.
So in 1953, from what you read
2 in the public domain, the cigarette companies who
3 were manufacturing this product and who had
Page 1304 depo of Lacy Ford
scientists working for them, did not yet believe that
5 cigarettes caused lung cancer, correct, for 1954,
6 correct?
7 MR. SUAREZ:
8 THE WITNESS:
9
Objection.
Form.
Well, again, I couldn't say
what the companies believed, but the Frank
10 Statement, in fact, says what I just articulated
11 that it said.
12 Frank Statement, the companies say that they
13 don't believe that the scientific studies have
14 reached the point of being confirmed.
15 Q.
They did not believe -- in the
(By Mr. Paige)
All right.
It says that
16 there is no proof that smoking cigarettes is one of
17 the causes of lung cancer, correct?
18 MR. KOETHE:
19 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
I'd have to see the document
20 to know the exact wording.
21 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
You've testified many many
22 times that you're not aware of the fact that that is
23 a part of the wording of the Frank Statement?
24 MR. SUAREZ:
25 THE WITNESS:
Objection to form.
I don't have the document in
148
1 front of me.
It certainly sounds familiar, and
2 I would certainly accept the characterization
3 they were saying that the link had not been
4 proven, yes.
5 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
So either the tobacco
6 companies believed at that time that the link had not
7 been proven or they were publishing false information
Page 131depo of Lacy Ford
8
to the public, one or the other, correct?
9 MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
10 MR. SUAREZ: Objection.
11 THE WITNESS:
Well, I have no reason to
12 question what they put in the Frank Statement,
13 but I only know what's in the Frank Statement
14 from the Frank Statement.
15 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Okay.
So if we were to
16 take them for their word in 1954, it does not appear
17 at that time that they believed that cigarettes
18 caused lung cancer, correct?
19
20
21
22
A.
That's correct; but the same statement
indicates that they were aware of scientific studies.
Q.
But they were going to do some research to
check it out?
23 A. Among other things, yes.
24 Q. But it's your opinion that, even though
25
the tobacco companies didn't believe, do you think
149

Mr. Sherman should have believed it in 1954?

I was not opining at all on

The fact that he decided not to believe,
11
12 that is a decision, and I'm not in a position to
13 stand a judgment of that decision.
14 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
If the tobacco companies
15 did not believe that cigarettes caused lung cancer in
16 1954 and if Mr. Sherman did not believe that
17 cigarettes caused lung cancer in 1954, both of those
18 positions would be consistent with what millions of
19 Americans believed in that time period, correct?
20 MR. KOETHE:
21 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
I'm trying to think that
22 through.
Yes, I think, I mean, if I understand
23 your question, I think that's correct.
24 were clearly, in 1954, a lot of Americans who
25 did not believe that it had been proven that
There

6 Q.
So it didn't
It continued.
(By Mr. Paige)
Well, when do you think
7 the AMA came out publicly and said that smoking
8 caused lung cancer?
9
A.
Well, the AMA did several things.
In '64
10 or '65, I think they made their clear statement on
11 that.
12 in public as saying the statistical associations were
13 serious matters.
But up until that time, they had been quoted
14
The AMA, in particular, had a very kind of
15 scientific as opposed to public health definition of
16 causation and weren't satisfied that there was some
17 hard sort of clinical biomedical evidence to say that
18 one things leads to the other as opposed to just
19 simply associated with it.
20
Q.
Did you see articles in your own reliance
21 materials where the heads of the AMA were coming out
22 in the late '50s and early '60s saying that it had
23 not been proven that cigarettes caused lung cancer,
24 are you aware of that or not?
25
A.
I am aware that AMA leaders took
155
Page 137depo of Lacy Ford
1 statements that they believed that it had not been
2 proven.
3 if you look carefully, they're talking about the
4 scientific causation and the establishment of
5 laboratory evidence that identifies particular
6 mechanisms, which causes the link between lung cancer
7 and cigarette smoking.
8
9
Q.
But I think in almost all of those articles,
Do you think Mr. Sherman, who was a high
school dropout had more information and more
10 knowledge about the health hazards of cigarettes than
11 the leaders of the AMA and the Surgeon General of the
12 United States?
13 MR. SUAREZ:
14 THE WITNESS:
Objection to form.
I think Mr. Sherman, as a
15 consumer of cigarettes, had to worry about not
16 whether scientific causation had been
17 established in the minds of some, but what his
18 own personal health risks were if he continued
19 to smoke.
20 there would be no question that the chief health
21 recommendation of the government and the
22 American Cancer Society and everybody else is if
23 you want to avoid lung cancer, don't smoke.

(By Mr. Paige)
We can move to the '60s in

8 smokers at that time did not believe cigarettes
9 caused lung cancer, correct?

Object to the form, as well
11 as the argumentation.
12 Q. (By Mr. Paige)
13 A. Well, I think that figure is high, but I
Is that correct?
14 do agree with you that smokers in the '50s, even a
15 majority of them, did not believe that smoking caused
16 lung cancer.
17
But it's also true that in 1957 and 1959
18 the Surgeon General of the United States made strong
19 statements supporting the link between cigarette
20 smoking and the risk of getting lung cancer, and that
21 was in the 1950s.
22
Q.
Right.
And in 1957, there were
23 approximately 50 million smokers.
So we know between
24 25 and 30 million of them did not believe that
25 smoking caused lung cancer yet, correct?

15 Americans in 1957 who did not believe that cigarettes
16 caused lung cancer, according to the testimony of
17 Mr. Sherman's wife, he was one of them, was he not?
18 MR. SUAREZ:
19 THE WITNESS:
Objection to form.
I'm not sure that I could
20 say that based on her testimony particularly to
21 that period of time.
22 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
If John Sherman was
23 uncertain in 1957 as to whether or not cigarettes
24 caused lung cancer, that would be totally consistent
25 with what your research showed that 25 or 30 million
158
1
other Americans also believed at that time, correct?

Certainly, John Sherman was

The tobacco companies, R.J. Reynolds and

Object to the form.
Yes, but with the
21 understanding that, throughout most of my

23 and commonly term in which people refer to it
24 among themselves in the public as addictive or

3 developed and recognized in the medical
4 community, which is beyond my expertise.

6 General warns about cigarette smoking and lung
7 cancer, it says he doesn't believe it's
8 addictive from a medical standpoint.

So do you have an
10 opinion that Mr. Sherman believed nicotine was

14 labels to Mr. Sherman in the 1950s, as I'm not
15 sure I have a basis from anything anybody said
16 in the deposition testimony to say that, all I
17 can say from what they did say is that he was a
18 pretty heavy smoker.

You've already indicated
20 he was a heavy smoker, who appeared to be a chain
21 smoker, who smoked at least two packs a day, who

12 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Based upon your research
13 into the layperson and commonly used definition of
14 addiction that you've been speaking about, and you
15 actually even have some mention of it in your expert
16 disclosure, do you believe that Mr. Sherman met your
17 -- and I know it's not a psychiatric definition --
18 but did he meet your lay and commonly used definition
19 of addiction or not?
20 MR. KOETHE:
21 THE WITNESS:
Objection to form.
I just don't know that I
22 have enough information about Mr. Sherman to
23 say.
He was a heavy smoker, I know that.
24 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
25
What was the tobacco
company's knowledge about the health hazards of
168

smoking as it related to lung cancer in the 1960s?
2 MR. SUAREZ:
3 THE WITNESS:
Objection.
Form.
Once again, I was not asked
4 to answer the question of what the tobacco
5 company's knowledge was.
6 they took that came in the public domain in the
7 1960s.
8 Q.
9
10
(By Mr. Paige)
I know what positions
What was their public
position in the 1960s?
A.
The public position in the 1960s tended to
11 be, again, that more research needed to be done and
12 causation still hadn't been proven because statistics
13 couldn't prove causation.
14
Q.
How were they getting that position of
Page 149depo of Lacy Ford
15
16
theirs out into the public domain?
A.
Well, it didn't get a great deal of
17 publicity in the 1960s as a decade.
18 sometimes quoted in newspaper articles and on
19 television stating their position.
20
21
Q.
Okay.
They were
Were they involved in a
letter-writing campaign.
22 MR. KOETHE:
23 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
I don't recall seeing
24 evidence of a letter-writing campaign.
I know
25 that company representatives sometimes made
169
1 speeches that were covered in the newspaper in
2 which they repeated their position.
3 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Would you be surprised
4 that they were writing letters to elementary school
5 classes and high school classes around the country
6 telling schoolchildren that it had not been proven
7 that cigarettes caused lung cancer in the 1960s?
8 MR. SUAREZ:
9 THE WITNESS:
Objection to form.
In the cases where I've seen
10 those letters, they was almost always a response
11 to queries from classes, including health
12 classes, which had read in their textbooks and
13 were doing projects on the health hazards of
14 smoking to respond.
15
In those opinions that I've seen, yes,
16 they did maintain their positions, but I've seen
17 no evidence that that was something that was
Page 15018 depo of Lacy Ford
done except in response to requests for
19 information.
20 Q.
21
(By Mr. Paige)
But you're aware of the
letters?
22 A. I have seen some of them, yes.
23 Q. Do you know how many they wrote?
24 A. No, I do not.
25 Q. Well, you've been presented with those
170
1 letters that were written by Philip Morris and R.J.
2 Reynolds to schoolchildren in litigation, correct?
3
4
5
A.
Yes, I've been asked questions about those
in cross-examination in the past, yes.
Q.
And you've been retained by R.J. Reynolds
6 on at least 25 cases and you're currently retained on
7 at least three cases, correct?
8 A. That's correct.
9 Q. And you're here to testify about the
10 public knowledge of the health hazards of smoking,
11 correct?
12 A. Yes; that's correct.
13 Q. And you want to have as much information
14
as you can on that topic, don't you?
15 A. Yes, I do.
16 Q. Did you ask Mr. Koethe or any of the
17 lawyers at Jones Day to get you all the letters that
18 R.J. Reynolds wrote to schoolchildren or widows or
19 widowers across the country in the '60s assuring them
20 that cigarettes were not unhealthy whether the link
21 had not yet been proven?
Page 151depo of Lacy Ford
22 MR. KOETHE:
23 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
No, I have not.
I didn't
24 think that that was necessary for my testimony.
25 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
You wouldn't be interested
171
1 to see how many letters they wrote?
2 20 or 20,000?
3
A.
Whether it was
That wouldn't matter to you?
I think that the number is not an issue
4 here.
5 mean, if people write a letter in response, whether
6 it's to children or members of the family who may
7 have raised a question, I think that is not an
8 unexpected thing.
9 hazards is so widespread, I think that's just a drop

11
I've seen no evidence in any reports of -- I
The information about the health
in the bucket compared to it.
Q.
It was so widespread to fourth graders in
12 1963 that you think it would be a drop in the bucket
13 to send a letter to fourth graders telling them that
14 it hadn't been proven yet that cigarettes caused lung
15 cancer?
16 MR. KOETHE: Objection to form.
17 MR. SUAREZ: Objection.
18 THE WITNESS:
Form.
Well, as I said earlier, I
19 think the fact that those letters were written,
20 the ones that I've seen, indicate how thoroughly
21 and frequently the health hazards of smoking
22 were being taught in the schools in the '60s.
23
24
This is part of the initiative and part of
the class project, and the company sent those
Page 15225
depo of Lacy Ford
I've seen those, and they did
letters out.
172
1 nothing to change my opinion.
2 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
What were the public
3 statements that the cigarette companies were telling
4 their shareholders about the relationship between
5 cigarettes and lung cancer in the '60s?
6 MR. SUAREZ:
7 THE WITNESS:
Objection.
Form.
Again, I think that I have
8 seen some of those statements and they're
9 essentially saying the same thing that they were
10 saying in newspapers and other places.
11 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
So based upon the letters
12 that you've seen and the shareholder reports that
13 you've seen, you would agree that it's possible that
14 the cigarette companies still, in 1964 and 1965 and
15 1966, may not yet have believed that their product
16 caused lung cancer?
17
A.
Well, based on the statement that they
18 were making in public newspapers and magazines, they
19 continued to take issue in some way with the
20 findings, which -- it's generally not necessarily
21 raising issues with the risks, but saying it hasn't
22 been proven.
23 other causes of lung cancer we haven't discovered.
24 Those kinds of things.
25
Q.
More research is needed.
There can be
And if Mr. Sherman had the same beliefs as
173
Page 153depo of Lacy Ford
1 those expressed by the tobacco companies in the '60s,
2 that would be consistent with what your research
3 showed millions of other smokers in the same
4 timeframe?
5 MR. KOETHE: Objection to form.
6 MR. SUAREZ: Objection.
7 THE WITNESS:
Form.
Again, I don't think that I
8 have enough information to testify about what
9 Mr. Sherman's beliefs actually were.
What I can
10 say about the 1960s is that the public awareness
11 of the health hazards of smoking was universal
12 and different people made different decisions
13 about what to do with that information.
14 Q.
15
(By Mr. Paige)
Well, you have the 1964
Gallup poll in your reliance materials, correct?
16 A. I believe that's correct, yes.
17 Q. And in accordance with the 1964 Gallup
18 poll, only 50 percent of smokers of 28 cigarettes or
19 more a day believed that smoking caused lung cancer,
20 correct?
21
22
MR. KOETHE:
I'm going to object to the
question.
23 MR. PAIGE:

7 preserve for the record an objection if you're
8 going to ask him about a poll and not show him
9 the poll.
10
11
MR. PAIGE:
Q.
Okay.
(By Mr. Paige)
You're familiar that you
12 have the 1964 Gallup poll on your reliance materials,
13 correct?
14 A. Yes, I am.
15 Q. And you've testified about that poll
16
numerous times, have you not?
17 A. I have testified about it.
18 Q. And you're familiar with the fact that 50
19 percent of the smokers of 28 cigarettes or more a day
20 did not believe that smoking caused lung cancer, are
21 you not?
22
A.
Without having the document in front of
23 me, I don't want to say specifically.
What I can
24 testify to is that the belief level about lung cancer
25 in '64 and '65, whether it's the particular poll
175
1 you're referring to or other polls I've seen, is
2 about 60 percent.
3 a little bit lower than the belief level overall.

The belief level among smokers is

6 correct?
7
A.
Testimony in the depositions tend to

indicate that he did, yes.
Q.
And you would agree that roughly in 1964,
10 roughly 25 million smokers who were smoking that many
11 cigarettes, did not believe cigarettes caused lung
12 cancer yet, correct?
13 MR. SUAREZ:
14 THE WITNESS:
Objection.
Form.
Again, I don't want to be
15 too precise without having the exact date in
16 front of me, but, yes, there were a number of
17 smokers who did not believe the abundant
18 information that smoking was a health risk.
19 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
In the '64 Surgeon General
20 Report -- well, prior to the 1964 Surgeon General
21 Report, isn't it true that 60 to 70 percent of
22 doctors in America were smoking?
23 MR. KOETHE:
24 THE WITNESS:
25
Object to form.
No, I don't think that's
accurate based on the information that I've
176

2 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
After the 1964 Surgeon
3 General Report, are you aware of the fact that the
4 cigarette companies' internal documents indicated
5 that they wanted to publicly give the smoker a
6 psychological crutch and self rational to continue
7 smoking?

Did you see anything that public domain in
the '60s or '70s, or even the '80s, where the tobacco
10 companies released to the public their internal
11 research linking cigarette smoking to lung cancer?

Object to the form.
I know that there was
information shared with both the Surgeon General
Page 157depo of Lacy Ford
15 in '64 and for the Surgeon General's 1979
16 report, but I don't know that I can recall other
17 occasions in which the information was released.
18 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
So you're aware that the
19 tobacco companies were releasing their internal

That's the extent of my knowledge, I
(By Mr. Paige)
Okay.
In response to the
1964 and 1969 Surgeon General Report, didn't the
10 cigarette companies publicly take the position that
11 it had not yet been proven that cigarette smoke
12 caused lung cancer?
13 A. Yes, they did.
14 Q. So in response to the 1964 and the 1969
15 Surgeon General Report, are you aware of the tobacco
16 companies releasing any internal medical research
17 directly to the public telling them that they had
Page 15818 depo of Lacy Ford
determined a link between cigarette smoking and lung
19 cancer?
20 A.
21
As you asked the question, I believe, no,
would be the answer.

Q.
In the 1970s, what was the tobacco
11 company's public position regarding smoking and lung
12 cancer?
13 MR. KOETHE:
14 THE WITNESS:
Object to form.
Well, in the 1970s, from the
15 standpoint of public discussion of the issue,
16 the issues tended to change and to get into
17 other issues such as low tar cigarettes and new
18 diseases.
19 about the company's position on lung cancer.
20 But to the best of my recollection, it didn't
21 change appreciably from the 1950s to 1960s.

I'll try to make this quick.
I'll move
A.
Do you agree, in
A minority of Americans, less than a
17 fourth, I believe at that point as a percentage, did
18 not believe that cigarette smoking caused lung
19 cancer.
20 Q.
About 70 percent roughly did believe it.
I'm talking about smokers.
Do you know
21 what percentage of smokers believed that cigarettes
22 caused cancer in the 1970s?
23
24
25
A.
Again, that would be a slightly higher
percentage of smokers of the general population.
Q.
And whether it's 30 percent or 40 percent,
183
1 you would agree that that would encompass millions of
2 Americans?
3
A.
Yes.
At that point, it would be millions,
Page 162depo of Lacy Ford
4
yes.
5
Q.
And in 1980 -- well, do you agree
6 currently the understanding of the link between
7 cigarette smoking and addiction to nicotine is
8 greater today than it was in the '50s and '60s and
9 '70s?
10 MR. SUAREZ: Objection.
11 MR. KOETHE: Objection to form.
12 THE WITNESS: 13 question?
14 Q.

Could you repeat that
I didn't follow it.
(By Mr. Paige)
I was reading two
15 different things.
I believe I may have mixed and
16 matched there.
17 understanding of the link between smoking and
18 addiction is greater today than it was in the '50s?
Do you agree that currently the
19 MR. KOETHE:
20 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
I would argue that the
21 awareness of the health risks between lung
22 cancer and cigarette smoking was universal in
23 the '50s, and it's virtually universal today.
24 higher percentage of people have accepted that
25 information as true today to where belief is
A
184
1 almost universal.
2 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
I'm talking about nicotine
3 and addiction, and I'm going to start talking about
4 the '88 Surgeon General Report.
5 today, do you agree there's a greater understanding
6 of the link between nicotine and addiction as there
7 was in the '50s from a historical perspective, if you
Page 163
I just want to know,depo of Lacy Ford
8
know?
9
MR. KOETHE:
10
Object to form.
THE WITNESS:
Again, with the
11 understanding that addiction, and I use it as
12 it's not medical, I couldn't comment on whether
13 there's a better scientific or expert
14 understanding.
15 were addictive or habit forming, was widely
16 known, universally known in the 1950s.
17 so that it was a part of everyday conversation
18 and humor.
19 Q.
And the fact that cigarettes
(By Mr. Paige)
So much
Do you agree in 1981 the
20 FTC poll showed that 32 percent of smokers or 15
21 million smokers were unaware that smoking caused lung
22 cancer?
23 MR. KOETHE:
24 THE WITNESS:
25
Object to the form.
I'm not going to comment
about that poll without looking at it, but I
185
1 would say that by 1981, people were not unaware.
2 They may not have believed, but they were not
3 unaware.
4 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
I did misspeak it, and I
5 agree with that.
6 percent of smokers or 15 million smokers did not
7 believe smoking caused lung cancer in 1981?
8
9
10
A.
But would you dispute that 32
That would not be inconsistent with my
research as a belief number among smokers.
Q.
Would you agree that your research has
Page 16411 depo of Lacy Ford
shown that, according to the 1964 Gallup poll, 50
12 percent of smokers thought that filters made
13 cigarettes safe?
14 MR. KOETHE:
15 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
That's not something that
16 sticks in my mind, and I couldn't comment
17 without reviewing the document.
18 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Do you dispute that
19 millions of smokers in the '60s thought that by using
20 filters they were making smoking cigarettes more
21 safe?
22 MR. KOETHE:
23 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
Certainly, there was a lot
24 of interest in the late '60s among the public
25 and among the scientific community in public
186
1 evidence suggesting to the companies in making a
2 safer cigarette and as people began to switch to
3 low tar cigarettes as they came out.
4
From the evidence that I've seen, they had
5 a variety of reasons for doing that.
6 so in the hopes that they were safer, but the
7 underlying message in all the information that I
8 saw is that the only safe thing to do is quit
9 smoking.
10
Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Some did
But you do not agree that
11 50 percent of smokers thought that by using filters,
12 they were making smoking safe --

17 document to see.
18
Q.
I have to review that particular
(By Mr. Paige)
I want to talk about your
19 testimony that there's a long standing awareness that
20 smoking is habit forming or addictive.
21 tobacco companies first believe that nicotine was
22 addictive?
23
A.
When did the
Again, I couldn't give you a precise
24 answer on that, but I'm aware in my research that,
25 again, you're talking about a different definition,
187
1 perhaps an appropriate definition from a medical and
2 scientific standpoint, but not what I was looking for
3 in my research.
4
5
Q.
When did they first admit publicly, under
any definition, that nicotine was addictive?
6 MR. SUAREZ:
7 THE WITNESS:
8 a precise date.
9 Q.
Objection to form.
As I said, I can't give you
It would have been post-1995.
(By Mr. Paige)
And are you aware of the
10 1957 Gallup poll that showed 26 percent of smokers
11 indicated that they wanted to stop smoking, but could
12 not?
13
14
15
A.
Yes, I do recall that.
I won't agree to
the exact number, but a number like that, perhaps.
Q.
Are you aware of a 1972 or have you seen a
16 1972 document from the tobacco company that said,
17 "Happily, for the tobacco industry, nicotine is
Page 16618
depo of Lacy Ford
habituating and has a physiological affect"?
19 MR. KOETHE:
20 THE WITNESS:
Object to the form.
I don't recall seeing that
21 document, but both of those things are things
22 that would have been said by school textbooks in
23 the 1920s and '30s.
24 Q.
25
(By Mr. Paige)
So most consumers already
knew it?
188
1
A.
It is certainly my argument that most
2 consumers -- indeed, all consumers knew that tobacco
3 could be habit forming and there was a physiological
4 reason for it in some respects.
5
Q.
Well, have you seen a 1978 tobacco
6 document that actually disputes what you just said
7 that indicates that very few consumers actually are
8 aware of the effects of nicotine, the addictive
9 nature of it, and that it is actually a poison?
10 MR. SUAREZ:
11 THE WITNESS:
Objection.
Form.
I have not seen that
12 document and that's contrary to information that
13 was widely distributed to the public for many
14 years before that.
15 Q.
(By Mr. Paige)
Are you aware of a 1982
16 tobacco document that indicates most smokers would
17 like to stop, but are unable to?
18 MR. KOETHE:
19 THE WITNESS:
20 that document.
21 Q.
Object to form.
(By Mr. Paige)
Again, I don't recall seeing
Do you know what
Page 167depo of Lacy Ford
22 percentage of smokers wanted to quit in the '80s, but
23 indicated they could not?
24
25
A.
I have seen information to that effect,
but I couldn't recapitulate it off the top of my head
189
1 except to say that there were some smokers who
2 believed that they could not.
3
Q.
When Mr. Sherman started smoking, do you
4 know the percentage of teenagers that smoked at that
5 time?
6 in the 1940s?
7
The percentage of male teenagers that smoked
A.
I see no information that will allow me to
8 answer that question.
9 the education was to advise teenagers against

11
The thrust, of course, of all
starting to smoke.
Q.
You didn't see that a lot of teenagers and
12 young people in the '40s and '50s were smoking
13 because it was the thing to do and they were
14 advertising through, you know, Mickey Mantel and
15 people like that smoking?
16 MR. SUAREZ:
17 THE WITNESS:
Objection.
Form.
Beginning in the 1950s, I've
18 seen a lot of discussion about how to discourage
19 young people from starting to take up smoking
20 and what the best way of doing that is.
21 say that in the textbooks, in the 1940s, there
22 was certainly a lot of information encouraging
23 students not to take up smoking.
24 people did anyway, and I don't know what the

(By Mr. Paige)
Do you know when
2 Mr. Sherman started smoking, he believed that tobacco
3 caused lung cancer?
4
5
6
A.
I have no evidence to make a judgment like
that.
Q.
Okay.
It would be unlikely in the 1940s
7 that a teenager would believe that based upon the
8 information that you reviewed?
9
A.
I think a teenager in the 1940s would have
10 been advised not to start smoking at 17.

12 I couldn't say that he was likely to believe that it
13 caused lung cancer.
14
Q.
It was a
That would be as much as I could say.
Sir, do you agree that it would be
15 unlikely that Mr. Sherman, as a teenager in the
16 1940s, would have believed that cigarette smoking
17 caused lung cancer?

MR. SUAREZ:
Objection.

THE WITNESS:
I don't know what
21 Mr. Sherman believed.
22 might have been unlikely.

I would agree that that
And do you have an opinion
24 as to what his understanding was about the
25 physiological effects of the addictive nature of
191
Page 169depo of Lacy Ford
1 nicotine was when he started smoking in the 1940s as
2 a teenager?
3
4
A.
I wouldn't have any basis for offering an
opinion on that.
5 Q. Do you have any questions for me?
6 A. I didn't know I was allowed, but, no, I

don't.

MR. PAIGE:
