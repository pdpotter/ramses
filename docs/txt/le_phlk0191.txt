ELIZABETH COBBS HOFFMAN, PH.D., having been duly administered an oath in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure Section 2094, was examined and testified as follows:
(Exhibit 1 premarked)
EXAMINATION
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Dr. Hoffman, my name is Scott Nealey, and I represent plaintiffs in this case.
How many times have you been deposed?
A I’m trying to recall. Probably under ten. I’m going to guess six or seven.
I’m very sorry. I just don’t recall that number. I didn’t know I needed to tally it.
Q It’s not a memory test.
So you’ve been deposed six, seven, eight times -- something like that?
A Yes. That’s a good guess.
Q Okay.
And outside of tobacco litigation, have you ever been deposed?
A I don't recall. I might have been once.
Q What would the occasions for that have
been?
A It seems to me that it might have had to do with a real estate transaction here in San Diego.
I'm sorry. It was quite a while ago.
Maybe 20 years ago.
Q A personal real estate transaction?
A Yes.
Q And outside of tobacco litigation, have you ever been hired as an expert in litigation?
A No. I've never been hired as an expert in litigation.
Q Okay.
Now, if I’m understanding -- if I’m understanding, you were first retained in around 1999; is that correct?
A Yes, that’s correct.
Q And you were hired by an attorney at a law firm called Johnson, Taylor & Purvis?
A No. That’s not the correct tile. It’s Johnson, Tyler & Purvis.
Q Tyler.
A P-u-r-v-i-s.
Q And who did you work with at Johnson,
Tyler & Purvis?
A I initially worked with Alan Purvis.
Q And you understood that Mr. Purvis had originally been a partner at Shook, Hardy & Bacon?
A I understand that he worked at Shook,
Hardy & Bacon. I assume he was a partner, but I don’t know that for sure.
Q Okay.
So Mr. Purvis had worked at Shook, Hardy as a lawyer and gone off and founded his own firm but continued to do tobacco litigation; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: He did not found his own firm. He joined a firm.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
Now, how did you get in touch with Mr. Purvis?
A I didn’t get in touch with him. He got in touch with me.
Q How did he get your name?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I understood he got my name
from Michael Schaller, who is another historian, like myself.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And you understood that Mr. Schaller was already employed at the time as an expert working for the tobacco companies?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t know what you mean by the term "employed."
His employer was University of Arizona, and it still is. But he is an expert witness, yes.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And at the time Alan Purvis got your name from Mr. Schaller, Mr. Schaller was working as an expert witness on behalf of the tobacco companies; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: He was working as an expert witness with Johnson, Tyler & Purvis, not, as I understand it, with the tobacco company directly.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q But he was -- the client and the person paying the bills were the tobacco companies; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: The primary client of
Johnson, Tyler & Purvis was PhilipMorris.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And the primary client of Shook, Hardy & Bacon was PhilipMorris; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t know that. In fact, I would doubt it.
I think they’re a very large company that probably has a number of clients.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Have you ever researched the Shane firm as a historian?
A No, I have not.
Q Have you ever even gone to the Web and looked at the history of that firm?
A No. It’s outside the scope of my research.
Q Have you seen descriptions of the Shook, Hardy firm in the secondary sources you have looked at?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, not very often. I’ve seen them referred to in various locations over the years, but -- because, as I said, it’s a very large firm, so sometimes its name is in the news. But I
haven’t researched it, per se.
MR. NEALEY: Now, I believe, if I look at your report -- and I’ll mark your report and Waggoner as Exhibit 2 to the depo -- you discuss secondary sources and consulting secondary sources. That’s part of the historical process?
A Historians do typically consult secondary and primary sources.
(Exhibit 2 marked)
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And you look at secondary sources -- and so that you understand -- "secondary source" is a published article or chapter, or book or presentation by another scholar in the field; is that correct?
A Yes. A secondary source is -- is typically a published source, and, of course, it can be on almost any topic.
Q And a secondary source -- a lot of secondary sources are what we call peer-reviewed; correct?
A Some are, and some are not.
Q And what is the purpose of peer-review?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: The purpose of peer-review -- which is often employed by journals --
particularly is to ensure that an article meets the standards of the profession.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And when something is peer-reviewed, could you just explain who the peer-reviewers are?
A Well, as the phrase implies, they are peers of the individual who -- or individuals who are submitting the article. So they would be fellow historians, if it was an article written by a historian.
Q And when one is -- and when you have an article in, for instance, a historical journal that is peer-reviewed -- when the article’s first submitted, if it’s sent out for peer-review, generally, how many historians’ peers would be given a copy of that article to look at?
A I don’t know. I think it would depend quite a bit on the journal.
Q Well, is it -- is it one? Is it sometimes three? Is it sometimes five?
A I really don’t know. I’ve never edited a journal, so I’m not sure.
It could be one, or it could be two. I suppose it could be any of those numbers. I would doubt it would be as many as five, but I might be
wrong.
Q So you’ve never been a journal editor; is that correct?
A No —
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’ve never been -- I’ve never been the primary editor. I’ve served on boards of editors but I’ve never been the editor of a journal.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q But even serving on the -- serving on a board of editors for a journal, you don’t know how many people would peer-review articles, typically?
A No. I don’t know that.
Q Don’t know that.
Have you served as a peer-reviewer?
A Yes, I have.
Q And when you’ve peer-reviewed, have you been asked to be a peer-reviewer in areas you are recognized as an expert in?
A Yes.
It would vary somewhat because, of course, my broad specialization is American history. So sometimes I would get asked to review something that’s very particular and very often something that
was fairly general.
Q Well, like, for example, I know that you have a manuscript that you’ve done about the Peace Corps; right?
A Yes. That’s right.
Q And so you might ask to be a peer-reviewer in articles regarding the Peace Corps or related movements; is that correct?
A Yes. That’s correct.
Q And I take it that you’ve probably never published anything in the area of ancient Britain; is that correct?
A I’ve written on that subject, but it’s not yet published.
Q Ah. Okay. Okay.
And have you ever been asked to be a peer-reviewer in anything related to ancient Britain?
A No. I’ve never peer-reviewed an article about ancient Britain.
Q But you’ve written something now about ancient Britain; is that correct?
A Yes, depending on how you define "ancient."
Henry VIII, is that ancient enough?
Q What?
A Is Henry VIII ancient enough?
(Laughter).
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q It would generally be considered middle Britain, but putting that issue aside -- so you’ve written an article about Henry VIII; is that correct?
A No. Not an article.
Q It is what? A manuscript? Book chapter?
A Yes. It’s -- he appears in a book chapter and some other elements of middle-Britain history.
Q Okay.
Well, I’m glad that you picked up my term that it is middle Britain, so now we can at least agree on the timeframe.
But -- so, have you ever been asked about having just written something in the area of middle Britain -- have you ever peer-reviewed in the area of middle Britain?
A No, I have not.
Q Now, has what you’ve written, the book chapter -- does that go through a peer-review-like process?
A I think "peer-review" is a -- more of a technical term. I’m not exactly sure if it applies in quite the same way with books.
But, yes, it’s similar in that the book -manuscript -- will go to an editor, and Harvard Press will share the book, manuscript with other historians before publishing it.
Q So much like if you have an article that’s published in a peer-review journal and the article’s sent out to peer-reviewers, if you have a chapter in a book like you’ve written on Henry VIII and some other topics, that would then go to other scholars in your field who would provide the editor’s comments and suggestions; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
Although I have to say, I just -- I don’t quite know -- in academia, there always is a question about what constitutes peer-review.
Sometimes you can write a chapter in a book that’s solicited by an editor of the book. And some academic officials won’t consider that a form of peer-review. But other historians certainly will review -- will read the manuscript and often give feedback, but it’s not quite technically peer-review. BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
I’d refer to as slightly more informal peer-review -they might consider a book chapter peer-review and some might consider it not; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: That’s how I understand it.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
Now, the reason why one looks at secondary sources as you’ve written in your report, is to give context in proportion to primary sources; is that correct?
A Yes. That’s one reason.
Q Okay.
And part of the peer-review process is to have other historians look at what you’ve done to see if you’ve put the things in the correct context; is that correct?
A They might consider that.
Q And part of the reason why you do peer-review is to see when you’ve looked at particular materials that you haven’t missed some particular materials; correct?
A Sometimes.
If they think there’s something really large and germane, they might mention it; sometimes
they won’t.
Q And another reason why we do peer-review is, as you used the term, to see there is appropriate proportions given to the materials that you’re relying on, and that the analysis of them is correct; is that correct?
MR. FOWLER: Objection. Objection to
form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t think it works quite in the way that you’re describing.
(Off the record)
MR. NEALEY: Back on the record.
We had a question about the stipulations we’re operating under, and I think we have an agreement that an objection by one party serves as an objection for all parties, and that objections other than as to form of the question are reserved for trial.
MR. FOWLER: Yes. Thank you.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Dr. Hoffman -- and when one does peer-review, one will get comments back about one’s conclusions and analysis as to whether the materials support that conclusion or don’t support that conclusion; correct?
A Sometimes.
Q And one in peer-review will get back information from the peer-reviewer about sources and materials, both primary and secondary, that need to be considered or need to be addressed by the author; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: That doesn’t happen very commonly in my experience, but I’m certain that it does happen sometimes.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And that’s because you pretty much have found everything that falls germane into the area you’re talking about, and a peer-reviewer shouldn’t be saying to an author: Gee, you didn’t consider this, and you didn’t consider this and you didn’t consider this; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, again, that’s a bit
long.
Could you -- I’m sorry. Would you mind repeating just the basic question for that? I’d like to answer it correctly.
BY MR. NEALEY:
because -- because most scholars, when they have submitted something for peer-review, have comprehensively looked at the materials, a reviewer shouldn’t be able to sit there and say: You didn’t look at this, you didn’t look at this and you didn’t look at this, and that’s why those kind of comments are infrequent; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Not quite.
The -- you said that the author would have comprehensively considered all the materials. In any subject, there are multiple and redundant materials to consider. So sometimes, the person isn’t getting that feedback because they’ve -- they have adequately demonstrated their case, not necessarily because they have read every conceivable thing a person could have read.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So when you were contacted by Mr. Purvis in 1999, did you -- did you talk to Dr. Schaller before agreeing to be retained?
A Yes. I spoke to Dr. Schaller first.
Q So -- and what did Dr. Schaller tell you?
A He told me that he had been working as an expert historian on these kinds of cases for some
period of time; and that he wanted to know if I might be interested in doing the same.
Q Did he tell you about anyone else who was working in this area as a historian for the tobacco companies?
A Yes, he did. He did tell me about some other folks who were doing the same thing.
Q Who else did he say was doing the same thing?
A Because it’s been quite a long time ago, I don’t remember all of them. And I’m not sure if I learned this solely from him or perhaps also from Mr. Purvis, but two of the kind of big names that he mentioned at that time were Steven Ambrose and Joan Hoff Wilson.
Q Any others?
A I’m sure there were. I just don’t recall off the top.
Yeah. I know there were a couple others.
I just don’t recall.
Q Okay.
So -- now, when you started on this project with Mr. Purvis, what did you charge on an hourly basis?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: When I first started, I was charging $175 an hour for research and 200, I think, for trial testimony, if I recall correctly.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And you’ve never been retained as an expert witness in any matters before; is that correct?
A No, not as a legal expert.
I mean, not as an expert for legal kinds
of issues.
Q Other than your position at the time with San Diego State University, did you have any other significant source of income outside of your academic salary at that point?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q What else were you doing?
A I began textbook writing.
Q And what time were you doing textbook writing?
A I’m sorry. What do you mean -MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
time”?
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q You said you had begun textbook writing.
I’m asking you when you began textbook writing.
A Well, in approximately the same month as I began doing this other work. It was a busy year.
Q So you began working on a textbook in 1999 as well; is that correct?
A That’s correct.
Q But before 1999 -- before you were hired by Mr. Purvis, and you started working on this textbook, do you have any other substantial source of outside income, other than your academic position at San Diego State University?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No.
I was a -- I sat on a panel for the U.S. State Department, but I don’t think it was very much money. Try government work.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Yeah.
So would it be fair to say that before 1990, your source of income was almost exclusively your academic position at San Diego State University?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
income was primarily from my wage salary.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, when you started on this project with Mr. Purvis, you knew who you’d be testifying for?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Can you clarify that just a
tiny bit?
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Did you know who you would be testifying on behalf of?
A I understood that their client was PhilipMorris.
MR. WALKER: Same objection.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, did you also understand you might be testifying on behalf of RJR Reynolds?
A I didn’t really think about that very much at the time. Soon thereafter, I think there might have been a case in which -- a kind of class action in which Reynolds was also involved.
Q Now, when you were hired by Mr. Purvis in 1999, he contacted you at Dr. Schaller’s recommendation, had you ever published anything in the area of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses?
A No. I hadn’t published -MR. FOWLER: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Prior to 1999, I had not published work on the history of smoking, per se.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And prior to 1999, had you ever presented any work at a conference or related to the issue of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses?
A No. It was in 1999 that I began to do more general kinds of research.
Q And would it be fair to say that before 1999, you had never done historical research on the topic of the history of public attitudes toward smoking and related illnesses; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: This was a new project for me, like some of the other new projects I took on in
1999.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, since 1999, have you ever published anything in a peer-reviewed journal on the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses?
on that topic.
Q Have you ever presented at a conference on the issue of the history of public attitudes toward smoking and related illnesses?
A No.
The primary way in which I’ve published on that or talked on that is in the context of my textbook.
Q And have you ever -- have you ever been asked to be a peer-reviewer since 1999 in the area of the history of public attitudes toward smoking and related illnesses?
A No. That hasn’t been something I’ve been asked to do.
Q Okay.
Now, when you started working with Mr. Purvis, did you do a literature review?
A I started out by formulating my question, at which -- after which I would have begun reviewing literature, primary and secondary.
Q And when you did your literature review, the secondary literature review -- or -- did you find that Dr. Schaller had ever published in the area of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I wasn’t searching for Dr. Schaller’s name, so no.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So put another way, when you searched for articles and books and chapters, when you did your literature review, you found nothing that Dr. Schaller had ever published in the area of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses, did you?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I did not do a search of that sort. I was focusing more on primary sources than secondary.
But, no, I never did find an article that he had written on that subject.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And over the last 12 years, Dr. Schaller hasn’t published anything on the area of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t know.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well --
A He may have.
Q -- as you have gone through this project over the last 12 years, have you kept up with the literature, what others are publishing in this area?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: My research has been primarily in primary sources, and I do look at secondary literature as it comes out. But my emphasis is not in secondary literature, nor is it in my other fields of research, either.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Are you saying that you haven’t continued to check the secondary literature, and journals and books to see as material comes out on this question in the secondary literature?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I said I do check on secondary literature.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And as you check on secondary literature, you’ve never seen anything published by Dr. Schaller over the last 12 years on the issue of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I have not run across anything by him on that subject.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, have you talked to Dr. Schaller since, about your work?
A Yes. I’d speak with him occasionally.
Q Okay.
Did you have Dr. Schaller review your reports in these cases?
A No, I did not.
Q Have you ever sent your testimony, when you’ve testified in court, to Dr. Schaller and asked him if he had any comment?
A No, I have not.
Q Have you ever sent your report, in this case, to any other historian and asked them if they had comments?
A No. I’ve not.
Q Have you ever sent your testimony when you’ve testified in court to any other historian and asked them to -- if they have comments -- an informal peer-review?
A This -MR. FOWLER: Object to form.
normal practice. And so, no, I don’t do that, because it’s not how I would normally work.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, you don’t normally work in litigation; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I do. I do do this work quite a bit.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And the only time you’ve ever done this work is for tobacco companies; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: What do you mean, this type
of work?
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Litigation. The only time you’ve ever come and testified in court is on tobacco cases; right?
A Yes. That’s true.
Q Okay.
So -- but when you had a paper or something that you had done that you wanted to get published in the past -- before 1999; before you started working with Mr. Purvis -- when you had a paper you wanted to get published, you would send
that paper around to colleagues and ask them for comments; right?
A I sometimes did, and I often did not.
Q And you would search out people in that field, and you would ask them for comments; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I would answer this question the way I answered the preceding one: Sometimes I did, and often I did not.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And then when you submitted the paper, or book chapter, it would be sent out to other historians, who would look at it and give you comments; right?
A Sometimes.
Q And -A I’m sorry.
MR. WALKER: She hadn’t quite finished, Scott. You can’t tell that over the phone.
MR. NEALEY: Yeah, I apologize. It’s hard for me to tell over the phone.
THE WITNESS: Yeah. I was just going to add -- I’m sorry -- that sometimes they do and sometimes they don’t give you comments.
But, yes, if you send it to a publisher, they might send it out and get comments. Sometimes they’ll just send you their comments.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So before something makes it into a peer-reviewed publication -- and you have peer-reviewed publications -- a number of sets of historians have looked at what you have written; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t know a number of -it sounds like it’s a large number of people.
Sometimes I think it’s an editor, and sometimes it probably is maybe two or three people at the most, I would think. But I’m not sure about that, because, again, I’ve not been an editor.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So every peer-reviewed article that you have done has been looked at by an editor and a couple of peer-reviewers; is that correct?
A I think that’s correct, yeah.
Q And it’s also been probably looked at by some of your colleagues who you might have asked for comments or discussed certain sections of before it even gets to peer-review; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, as I just previously answered, sometimes that would happen and sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes I will simply write something and submit it without sending it to other colleagues first.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, what other historians have you discussed your work on this project with?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: "On this project,” you mean these -- the three deposition cases we’re talking about today?
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q No.
I’m talking about the project you’ve been -- well, let me, just as background,
Dr. Hoffman -- the materials you’re relying on in this case, you’ve been collecting since 1999; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’ve been collecting materials on the topic since 1999.
BY MR. NEALEY:
start with a clean sheet of paper, and go pull everything you thought you needed and do comprehensive research; you relied on what you’d already done, and then you looked and sought if there was something specific to this case, in addition to what you generally had, that you needed to find; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I did some combination of what you just described.
I always start with an open mind and a blank piece of paper, if you will, in the sense of I’m curious and interested to know how the general picture of American history applies in this particular individual’s life.
So, yes, I always come with a lot of background information that has to do with the training I’ve received over the years, and experience I’ve obtained and I apply that. But I also start with a clean piece of paper as I’m trying to understand what happened to a particular individual in their lifetime.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So, for example, looking at your reliance list in the Waggoner case, the first item there is an
article by Reader’s Digest. You went through Reader’s Digest to find material on the topic that you’re testifying on. You went through those Reader’s Digests in 1999-2000 before you testified in the Boekin case; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. I collected a lot of Reader’s Digests before -- from 1999 onward.
Sometimes I would go back, however, in the case, like the Waggoner case where two individuals testified to that issue being -- to that magazine being in Ms. Waggoner’s home in the 1960s, and I’d look at it again to see what might be particularly pertinent. That particular article you’re talking about is from 1966. So that was the period of time in which the Reader’s Digest was in the Waggoner home -- well, actually, I guess it wouldn’t have been called "Waggoner"; it was the Reese home at that time, because she was married to a different gentleman.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q But you didn’t go back and sit in some library and leaf through 50 years of Reader’s Digests; you’d go back and you looked at the collection of articles that you had already pulled
from Reader’s Digest; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. That’s a fair description. I would look at the collection that I already had obtained.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And the collection of Reader’s Digest materials you obtained, you obtained in 1999, 2000, 2001, before you testified in Boekin; right?
A Well, certainly the majority I would have obtained by that time. But, you know, new ones do come to light as time goes on.
Q Well -- and I could go down and -- you have -- the second article you have is from Senior Scholastic from 1954. And you went through Senior Scholastic, looking for materials well before you were retained in the Waggoner case; correct?
A Yes. I saw that before the Waggoner case, for sure.
Q Yeah.
And, in fact, you went through and found the Senior Scholastic stuff before you testified in Boekin in 2001; right?
A I believe so. It’s been a while, but that strikes me as correct.
Q Yeah.
And the next two sources you cite are People magazine and Time magazine and Newsweek magazine. That’s 3, 4, and 5. And you went through Time, and People and Newsweek and pulled articles that you wanted to save well before you were retained in the Waggoner case; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. I obtained those before the Waggoner case.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And, in fact, you probably went through People, and Time and Newsweek and pulled the articles that you wanted out of them; you did that in the ’99,
2000,	2001 timeframe; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, actually, I think I probably looked at People magazine later on, but I don’t recall. It just seems to me that’s something I got later.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Yeah.
But certainly, before were you retained in the Waggoner case; right?
A Yes. That’s correct.
Q Now, back to where we were.
I asked you what -- when we talk about this project, I’m talking about the work that you started in 1999, the materials you were collecting -all that you were doing up until today. I want to know what historians you’ve discussed the work you were doing, the conclusions you were reaching or the sources you were finding.
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’ve discussed this material with several historians. Some names that come to mind are Joan Hoff Wilson, whom I referred to earlier. And I believe Tom DiBacco I spoke to quite a number of years ago and also Richard Means. And I want to say Greg Black and John Snetsinger at some point.
So these are some names that come to mind. BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Any others?
A Yes, actually, now that I’m thinking.
Robert Schulzinger and Chester Patch.
Q Any others?
A I’m sure there are others -- oh, Michael Parrish.
Q Any others?
A No. Not that I can think of right now.
Oh -- oh, God. James Kirby Martin and William Stueck.
I think I also spoke once with Greg
Michelle.
Q Okay.
Now, Joan Hoff Wilson, she was also retained as an expert for the tobacco companies?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I don’t believe she was retained by the companies, but I’m not sure. But she was working as an expert witness for -- for a law firm. I don’t know which law firm.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Yeah.
She was working as an expert witness hired by lawyers to testify on behalf of the tobacco companies; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: She was working on the history of smoking and health, and I believe -- I’m not sure. I really don’t know her particular background all comprehensively, but I do know she was working for some lawyers at one point.
///
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, just so we understand, when you first started working in these cases, who did you bill your time to?
A I billed my time to Johnson, Tyler &
Purvis.
Q And at some point, did you start sending your bills to somebody else?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, I did.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And who did you start sending your bills
to?
A For a short time, I sent the bills and worked, with Shook, Hardy & Bacon. And after that, I worked primarily with Jones Day.
Q And over the last several years, have you sent all your bills to Jones Day?
A Yes, I have.
Q And before that, you sent them to Shook, Hardy & Bacon?
A For a very short time, yes.
Q And before that, you sent them to Mr. Purvis; is that correct?
A Well, I sent them to the law firm,
Johnson, Tyler & Purvis.
Q Now -- but you know that Johnson, Taylor [sic] & Purvis is not personally paying those bills; you know their clients, the tobacco companies, are paying those bills; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I assume that all attorneys bill their clients. So, yes. And I knew that their client was PhilipMorris.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So you know that ultimately, the work you’re doing is being paid for by PhilipMorris; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. Along that little ladder there, but, yes. At that time, anyway.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q You also know -- okay.
And you know when you were billing Shane, that your work was being paid for not by Shane -they weren’t writing a check out of their own pocket; you knew that the money to pay you was coming from the tobacco companies; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
billing their client.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And the client was tobacco companies; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. Yes. In this case, it
was.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And you also know when you were sending the bills to Jones Day, that Jones Day wasn’t paying those bills out of their own pocket; you know that the money was coming and passing through Jones Day from the tobacco companies; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I know that they were billing their client for the work that I was doing. BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
And as long as we’re there, since 1999, how much have you been paid for your work as an expert witness on behalf of the tobacco companies?
A I’m sorry. I only have my records for about the last ten years. And the past ten years, it’s around $550,000.
copies of your bills back for the last ten years?
A Yes, I do.
Q Okay.
And are they in a file someplace?
A Yes. I have them in -- in files and also electronically.
Q Okay.
So basically, those bills -- you can push a button and print ’em out for the last ten years; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, I think so.
I have to say I haven’t gone back and made sure there are no holes, ’cause I have several computers. But I think I have a pretty comprehensive record.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
And similarly, you then also have a paper copy of them in a file over the last ten years; is that correct?
A I should.
Q Okay.
$550,000?
A Yes. It’s in that range, yes.
Q Okay.
And you also worked for another two years before that; correct?
A That’s correct.
Q And that was a pretty extensive period of work because you were getting prepared for your first testimony; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, there was a fair amount of work involved, yes.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Yeah.
So -- and because you testified in a California case called "Boekin" in 2001; is that correct?
A Yes. And that’s where my records start.
Q Yeah.
So your records start with your testimony in Boekin, or your records start after Boekin?
A No. It seemed to me I looked at it not long ago, and I think it starts with the -- with the testimony in Boekin. I think.
Q Yeah.
out what you had been paid before you testified in Boekin, I could add those two numbers together and come up with what you’ve been paid in total; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I don’t know. You
might.
I had some bills outstanding. I don’t know at the time I testified in trial where exactly those things stood. It took a long time to get paid in that particular case. So I’m -- you know what I mean? I’m not sure what number -- you know, it would be a ballpark way of looking at it.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Yeah.
What was the trial result in Boekin?
A The trial result was a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.
Q And how much in damages were awarded?
A I believe that the jury came up with an initial figure of $3 billion.
Q And it was a little hard to get paid after
that?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
related to that. They were just bureaucratic and slow was my impression.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Very slow in paying you for your work in Boekin after that $3-billion verdict?
A No. That doesn’t seem to me the fair way of saying it, because they had been slow all along.
That particular law firm was just a little
bit slow.
Q Who was that particular law firm?
A Arnold & Porter.
Q Ah. So did you bill for the Boekin work to Arnold & Porter, then?
A No.
The way it worked is that I billed Johnson, Tyler & Purvis. They turned over bills, then, to Arnold & Porter, and Arnold & Porter was, you know, consistently slow in processing things.
Q Can you give me a -- an estimate of how much you would have billed -- beyond this 10-year period for those two years as you were getting ready to testify in Boekin -- the period beyond the ten years you’ve got the records -- how much approximately were you paid for that work?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, I’m very sorry. I would answer you, if I had the records.
I don’t know. I can’t even really give you a good guess.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Couple-hundred-thousand dollars?
A Oh, I don’t think so.
No. Nothing near that. But, again, I’m sorry. I just don’t know.
Q Okay.
Now, since the Boekin case over the last ten years, this $550,000 you’ve gotten since testifying in Boekin, what percentage of your income over those ten years has that been? Has it been 25 percent? 30 percent? 40 percent?
A I don’t know. I don’t know. I’d have to go back and think it through.
You know, I’d have to add in other -- my salary and my royalties.
I’m sorry. I don’t know the answer off the -- offhand.
Q Well, if you can give me an estimate -- I assume you’re capable, knowing your salary and the amount of royalties you’ve gotten, to tally them up and give me some kind of an estimate of what
percentage of your income, $550,000 has been over the last ten years.
A You know, I would really be giving you a guess.
Do you want just a guess?
Q I -- I’ll give you some time to think about it, if you’d like. But whether it requires you to sit down and add your royalty numbers to 550 and then figure out your approximate salary over the last ten years -- however you do it -- you know, if you can give me an estimate, that’s what I’m asking for.
I don’t want you to make it up, but, you know, if you’ve got to stop and you’ve got to write down your approximate royalties, your approximate salary over the last ten years, and then $550,000, and then do the math. However it’s easy.
A All right. I’m sitting here thinking this through right now. Just give me a minute.
(Brief pause)
Well, I -- let’s see.
Well, okay. You know, I’m going to guess here, so I’m -- this is imprecise, but, you know, over ten years, I probably would have made about a million dollars in wages. Something like that. And I think about 300,000 in royalties. So are we
looking at 25 percent? Something like that?
I don’t know.
Q Asking a lawyer to do math is always bad.
A Well, asking a historian to do it is equally egregious.
Q It’s slightly more than 25 percent.
A Okay.
Q But -- so you’re saying that approximately over the last ten years, you’ve made a million in wages, $300,000 in royalty, and $550,000 in your testifying on behalf of tobacco companies; is that correct?
A Yeah. Ballpark figures.
Q Okay.
This is probably one that a jury can even figure out the math on their own.
Now, we were asking about the historians you talked to. Joan Hoff Wilson was also working, to your knowledge, as an expert for lawyers who were paying her and then she was testifying on behalf of the tobacco companies; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: The work that she was doing, that I knew about, was her work on smoking issues -smoking and health. She -- you know, that’s the part
I understood. So in that sense, it fits. Although, I don’t know her very well, so she might have been doing other kinds of expert testimony in addition.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
Now, when you talked to Joan Hoff Wilson, did you get sources or materials from Ms. Wilson?
A No, I did not.
Q And what was your discussion with Ms. Wilson?
A I wanted to know what her experience had been, had she felt that she had complete academic freedom to come up with the conclusions that the evidence warrants, and she said she had; she felt that she was able to pursue the same standards of excellence that she would with anything else she works on. That was important to me.
Q Did you have any other discussions with
her?
A No.
Q Did you ever ask her to check and see if you had missed something, or you were drawing any incorrect conclusions?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. Just as like I wouldn’t
do with most other projects I work on.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And with Joan Hoff Wilson when you did your literature review, has she ever published anything in the area of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses? MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Not that I’m aware of.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And then you said you talked to Tom DiBacon [sic]?
A DiBacco.
Q DiBacco. I took note, and my notes were
bad.
(Laughter)
THE WITNESS: But that was pretty funny. BY MR. NEALEY:
Q DiBacco.
So Dr. DiBacco -- was he also working as an expert for the tobacco companies?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. He was working on smoking and health. That’s why I talked with him. BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
And did you ever ask Mr. DiBacco to look at your -- the sources you were using or the conclusions you were reaching to see, in an informal peer-review, if you were missing something?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. But that wouldn’t be my normal procedure. So I didn’t follow it in this case, as I have not in other cases, of topics I work on.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Did you get any sources from Mr. DiBacco?
A I don’t think so. I don’t recall, but I don’t think so.
Q Okay.
And when you did your literature review, did you find anything that Mr. DiBacco had ever published in the area of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses?
A You know, I just don’t recall. He might have, but I don’t recall.
Q Well, certainly, if he published something in the area of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses, when you did your literature review, you would have looked at it; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. If I thought it was relevant, I certainly would have.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And you don’t -- you didn’t come across anything by Mr. DiBacco that had ever been published in the area of history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses?
A Not that I recall.
MR. FOWLER: Object to form.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And then, again, going off my notes, you said that you talked to Richard Mean?
A Means, M-e-a-n-s.
Q M-e-a-n-s.
The court reporter will be happy with the
spelling.
And Mr. Means, he was also an expert hired by lawyers to testify on behalf of the tobacco companies; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. I think he was hired by -- I assume -- a law firm. I don’t know.
I talked to him about his research on education -- which had been published -- some of it.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And Mr. Means was also hired as an expert on behalf of the tobacco companies, and that’s why you called him; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
MR. FOWLER: Misstates her testimony.
Objection.
THE WITNESS: Well, I called him because I knew he had done extensive research on health education across the United States.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And Richard Means -- who gave you his
name?
A I think Alan Purvis told me about him.
Q Did Alan Purvis also tell you about Tom DiBacco?
A No. No. Julia Tyler mentioned to me Tom DiBacco.
He was at that time doing -- actually, I think he was involved in the Engle case, so that’s kind of why I knew about his work. But then I talked with him on my own.
Q And -- and who gave you the name of Joan Hoff Wilson to call?
A Michael Schaller.
But, of course, I also knew her prior to his telling me that she had been doing this kind of work.
Q And so Alan Purvis told you they had also retained Richard Means, and you could give him a call; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think that he told me that Richard Means had been doing some of this kind of research. And so that’s why I called him. I asked for the phone number. Didn’t tell me to call him.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And has Richard Means published anything in the area of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, I believe his publication was primarily in health education.
He is deceased now.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q But it’s fair to say that I could certainly go through your entire reliance list in this case -- which is 248 pages long -- and not find anything published by Mr. Means in the area of history of public attitudes towards smoking and
related illnesses; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t think there’s anything in there from Richard Means.
My materials are largely primary sources as is often customary among historians. That’s our emphasis.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And you’re unaware of any publications by Mr. Means, ever, in the area of history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I’d give you, again, my same answer: His work focused on health education, in which tobacco, of course, and smoking is a component part. But the emphasis would be on health education, per se.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And did you get any materials from Mr. Means, or did he give you the names of -- or sources that you should consult?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: He shared with me some of his research in California.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Meaning, he gave you copies of sources that he copied?
A Yes. He gave me some sources on California, which, of course, I supplemented quite extensively. But he had done some research in the state library that was of help. And he shared some of that with me.
Q This is in the timeframe before you testified in Boekin in 2001; correct?
A I think it is, yeah. Around that time, but probably before it.
THE REPORTER: Counsel, this is the
reporter.
Off the record?
MR. NEALEY: Yes.
(Off the record: 10:14 A.M.-10:20 A.M.)
MR. NEALEY: Back on the record.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, you mentioned that you talked to Greg Black, if I’m writing the name down -- is that correct?
A Yes.
Q And who gave you the name of Greg Black?
A Alan Purvis told me about Greg Black. I
think it was, anyway.
Q And Mr. Black, he was also retained as an expert to work for the tobacco companies?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, I’m not entirely
sure.
They were both from Kansas.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And when the lawyer, Alan Purvis, gave you the name of Greg Black, you called him up?
A Yeah. I eventually did.
Q And what timeframe was this?
A Well, I think I spoke with him a few times, because he had a lot of very interesting research that was ongoing. I think, you know, probably around the year 2000.
Q And did you understand him, also, to be working for Mr. Purvis on the same type of project you were working on?
A You know, I think it was a bit different. I’m not entirely sure.
I know they were working together, but I don’t know if he had been retained as an expert or not.
Q You knew Mr. Alan Purvis, the lawyer for
PhilipMorris, was working for Greg Black; is that correct?
MR. FOWLER: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I knew that they knew each
other.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And did Mr. Black tell you who was funding?
A No, he did not.
Q Now, when you talked to Mr. Black in the 2000 timeframe, did you obtain any materials from him or any sources or leads from him?
A Yes. He had done some research in television, so I obtained some information from him about that.
Q So some of the sources you have on television came from Gregory Black, whose name you were given by Alan Purvis, the lawyer for PhilipMorris?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Some of the materials might be. Of course they’re -- I mean, they’re general, generic materials like, you know, guessing wildly here, Leave It To Beaver or something. So there would be a lot of other sources and places you could
have gotten the same material from, but he had -happened to have collected some of it. So that was very helpful.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And when you got these TV shows from Mr. Black, these were episodes where something bad was said about tobacco; is that correct?
MR. FOWLER: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Well, the focus of my research, of course, was on smoking and health. So, yes, those were the types of episodes that I was looking to see if they existed or not.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Did you also look to see if episodes existed where characters in those TV shows smoked on the TV shows?
A I wasn’t -- again, you have to remember the scope of my research, which is what people knew about the hazards of smoking. So casual smoking, of course -- since that’s something that people did do -- sometimes would be in there. For example,
Mr. Cleaver smoked a pipe. So, you know, you would see that when you were hearing that, you know, Wally was telling Cleaver -- Beaver -- that: You should not smoke.
So -- but the emphasis of my research was always on what people knew, people like Ms. Waggoner, about the harms of smoking. So those would be the kinds of episodes I would be focusing on.
Q This is sort of like the 1950s,
Mr. Cleaver is sitting there smoking his pipe, and he tells his young, not-even-adolescent son: Don’t smoke; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, yeah.
This is in the context of the fact that people did smoke, and they often knew it was bad for them. Of course, this is a period of time in which someone like Mr. Cleaver might have known that smoking a pipe was considered not as harmful as smoking cigarettes.
But, anyway, the emphasis of that particular episode was that, you know, "Smoking will wreck ya," as Wally said.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So that was an episode of Leave It To Beaver, and that was found by Mr. Black, and then shared with you; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
indicated to begin with, I’m not entirely sure that’s the best example, but it could have been. That might have been where I first saw the Leave It To Beaver episode.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Yeah.
Now, one of the most popular shows in this period of time was I Love Lucy; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I Love Lucy was a very popular show, yeah, because it went into reruns, of course.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And it was sponsored by a tobacco company; right?
A I think it had a number of sponsors. But as far as I know, it seems I’ve heard that, yes, at one point it was sponsored by a tobacco company; I mean, in the sense of ”A word from our sponsors” means: A word from the folks that advertise with us. Q Yeah.
And who was the sponsor of I Love Lucy?
A Again, I think you just asked that question.
I think that at one point, one of its
sponsors -- one of its advertisers was one of the tobacco companies, but I don’t recall which.
Q Okay.
Well, and so you had a -- you know looking at the times, I Love Lucy was a -- probably the most popular television program in the period of time it was running; correct?
A I really don’t know what its ratings were compared with others.
Q Okay.
And it was sponsored by a tobacco company;
right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I believe that one of the advertisers was a tobacco company. But, again, I don’t recall which one, and it wasn’t the focus of my research.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And all of the characters on that TV show smoked; right?
MR. FOWLER: Object to form.
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t recall.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, Lucy would smoke on the set; right?
THE WITNESS: You know, now I’m stretching
back here.
I think Lucy and Desi smoked. I’m not sure if -- what were the other two? -- you know, Fred and Ethel both smoked. I don’t know. They might have.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And Lucy and Desi Arnaz, every episode that they’re smoking on the -- on the comedy episode, which was sponsored by a tobacco company; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I don’t know that they were smoking on every episode. But I have not done -- I have not looked at every episode of I Love Lucy.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, were you going to try to understand what the times were and what information -- what the times were, or were you trying to just look for pieces of information where something bad was said about tobacco?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: My research -- I designed my research in such a way as to give me clear
parameters, as any historian -- or I guess, probably any scholar would do.
In this case, I wasn’t looking at every form of behavior that touched upon smoking; I was looking at how people like Ms. Waggoner would have heard or learned about the harms of smoking. That people smoked was not something that was the focus of my research. I assumed that people smoked.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And Mrs. Waggoner would have known that a very, very popular star, much beloved, you know, from I Love Lucy and Desi Arnaz -- that they both smoked, and their show was sponsored by smokers; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t know that she would have known all of that. She might have. She certainly would have known that a broad cross-section of humanity smoked, and a broad cross-section of humanity did not smoke, like her parents, who both quit smoking in that same period of time.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So you got some episodes like this I Love Beaver [sic] thing from Mr. Black -- did you ever get anything else from Mr. Black?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I got several episodes of different television shows from him, but I don’t recall precisely which ones. I had seen some myself, of course, too.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q When you did your literature review, has Greg Black -- has he ever published anything in the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: He’s not a historian, as I understand it. As I recall, he’s a communications scholar. But I didn’t come across anything of his on smoking.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And in discussing that, you’re not an expert in advertising; is that correct?
A No, I’m not an expert on advertising.
Q And you’re not an expert in how people receive messages; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, of course, in history, we’re always interested in about -- how information is conveyed. But I’m not a communications expert, if that’s what you mean.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Exactly.
And you’re not a -- an expert on an individual level as to -- as to an individual’s susceptibility and nonsusceptibility to particular information, such as in the field of cognitive or social psychology; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: If you’re asking am I a cognitive or social scientist, the answer is "no." BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And you’ve never looked at the issue, or studied or published in the area of whether people actually received, processed and understand information; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, that’s a very technical way of saying, it seems -- I mean, do people get information and hear it? And in that sense, no, historians would -- we often talk about, you know, what government was saying, and what the public was saying, hearing about a particular issue.
So I’m not a psychologist, certainly, but I’m very interested in how information is communicated and responded to by the public.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Do you have any specialty in public health?
A No. Not as a --Q Or ever done any research?
A No. I’m not a public health official, you know. I’m a historian.
Q Do you have any expertise in how the public receives or understands public health messages?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I am to the extent I’m talking about the history of public health efforts to educate Americans about the hazards of smoking, including addiction and lung cancer. So, yeah, I am expert in that respect. Very much so.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
Well, then what is the phenomenon of intellectualization, Dr. Hoffman?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t know if you’re using that in a technical or psychological sense. I’m not a psychologist.
I mean, I could give you probably a
pretty, you know, intuitive definition of that but not a technical one, if you mean that as a term used in -- you know, in psychology.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q You’re certainly aware that there’s a whole field of psychology that deals with how people process messages and whether they understand and comprehend them or they disregard them; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, I’m not an expert in that area, so I’m not quite sure what you’re referring to.
But I assume that many disciplines -- you know, brain research, and psychology and communications -- we all look at these same kinds of topics.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And, so, you don’t know from a technical term what intellectualization means; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t know what capacity in which you’re even using it.
I mean, are you using it as a biologist would use it? As a psychologist?
As a historian, we would probably tend to
use it in a particular kind of way, but I’m not sure what you’re driving at.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q What does intellectualization mean to a historian, then?
A Well, I’d say, if you were to intellectualize something, you would try to raise it to a cognitive intellectual level as opposed to, say, emotive.
Q And do you know how that process works within people when they have information?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’m not a psychologist, so -- I have the feeling that you’re trying to ask me a question there that would be outside my expertise. BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, do you know what the phenomenon of rationalization is?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I know the phenomenon of rationalization as a common phrase that we use. But, again, if there’s a technical sense in which you’re using it, I wouldn’t know.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So in the -- the way of rationalization as
to how we process and accept or disregard evidence or information, you don’t understand that; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I think that if you ask me if I understand the commonsensical use of it,
I certainly do. People might say, "Today I’ll have a dessert, because yesterday I didn’t." So a person would try to rationally examine their options, and then they would make choices based on their rational deductions. So that’s the sense in which I understand that term.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q But certainly as it relates to the processing and either acceptance or disregarding of particular pieces of information, you don’t have an understanding or expertise in that phenomenon?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: My research -- what I can tell you is that my research is based on, you know, how people get information, how it’s put out there to them, what -- the things they say about it, how that comes into polls, how it changes behavior.
You know, fifty million people quit smoking, so I assume that they had some rational
process for making the choice. But I’m not a psychologist. And so I couldn’t tell you that -- or an addiction expert. I can’t tell you how they might use it within their discipline.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And you don’t have any expertise in how addiction affects the processing of information regarding health risks; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I’m not a medical
scientist.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And are you familiar with the psychological concept of denial?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’m familiar with it in that I’ve heard it, but I’m not a psychologist, and I can’t tell you exactly how it might work.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So how it relates to the processing of information and whether people understand it, or believe it or disregard it, you don’t understand -you don’t know anything about that; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
how -- you know, I can tell you about how people behave, and what information they were given and what average Americans were commonly aware of, but I can’t talk about the interior psychological process of denial.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So we talked about a lot of information in your report regarding Mrs. Waggoner.
Can you say to a degree of reasonable professional certainty that any single piece of information that you cite in your report -- that Ms. Waggoner actually read?
A No. I -- she would have to go through the report and tell me that.
I -- you know, I can tell you what books she was supposed to have read and the newspapers she said she subscribed to and read, but I can’t put any particular piece in her hand at a given moment in time.
Q And can you say as to any piece of information in your report that assuming she had read it, that she would process that information, believe that information, and not disregard it, or skip it over, or rationalize it or some other way that she discounted it?
THE WITNESS: What I can tell you is that she said, for example, that she believed smoking was a sin, and she also told me that -- not to tell me -I’m sorry -- that she in her deposition said that her parents had told her this, and her siblings had told her this and that she understood it in that way.
And I know from researching the records of the Church of God that it was considered sinful, because it harmed the body by giving people lung cancer and other kinds of diseases.
So she’s testifying that she believed that information. So that’s what I can tell you, based on my research. I can’t give you any deeper psychological analysis than that.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Can you show me where, in your resource materials, the Church of God said that smoking was a sin because it caused lung cancer?
A Well, yes, I can.
I’m sorry. Did you have a question?
Q Yeah.
A Would you --
Q What’s your source for the notion that the Church of God said that smoking was a sin, because it
caused lung cancer?
A The Church of God Evangel, E-v-a-n-g-e-l, publication -- that’s -- it should be on the reliance list -- said in various words -- the wording is not precisely what you just said there. But if you read it -- and I think when the jury sees it, they’ll see quite clearly -- that the Church of God Evangel believed smoking was a sin, because it was harmful and specifically because it caused lung cancer but also other kinds of diseases; and, also, because it was habit-forming or addictive. Although people could quit.
Q What number is that on your reliance list?
A Let me pull out the reliance list,
Mr. Nealey, and I’ll look. It’s a very long list, as you know. So I’m going to have to -- it’s going to take me a while to find it.
But if you had it on a disk -- which I don’t have in front of me -- you could, I suppose, search it by, you know, title and probably -- to me the most telling title would be Evangel, because it’s not a title that’s repeated very commonly elsewhere. Otherwise, I’m going to have to go through these 200 pages to find it. There should be several of them on there.
Q What year did Evangel say that smoking causes lung cancer, and therefore, it was a sin?
A I’d say it’s in the ’50s. But I -- if I -- it would probably be in my Waggoner report as well, by the way.
I’m sorry. I’m just leafing through it
right now.
On pages 32 and 33 of my report, you’ll see some references to it. For example, in 1946, they said, quote, "The old saying is ’Driving nails into their coffin. Committing Hara-Kiri, the American way,’" unquote.
"The article noted that nicotine was a form of poison and urged readers to be skeptical of advertisements for cigarettes.
"A two-part series on tobacco and health in 1952 cautioned that nicotine was a narcotic which brings about a craving for the drug."
They also -- skipping down here now, it says, "The Church of God Evangel also kept readers informed about new scientific findings. In 1955" -which, as you know, is well before Mrs. Waggoner started to smoke -- "it reported on the American Cancer Society study about smoking and lung cancer.
In 1958, it quoted extensively from
Hammond and Horn, and it summarized, "Tobacco is a killer. Its continued use is a slow form of suicide. Heavy cigarette smoking speeds death seven to eight years before your time."
Now, that was the year before the plaintiff began smoking.
So those are some examples but there were numerous others as well.
Q Now, Mrs. Waggoner’s parents had told her smoking was a sin; is that correct?
A Yes. That’s what she said.
Q And in what timeframe did her parents tell her smoking was a sin?
A It sounded to me, from her deposition, that they told her this over the course of her lifetime -- over the course of her childhood, rather.
Her father had smoked, I believe, when he served in World War II, and he quit smoking and told her about that. But -- so -- it was so long ago that she doesn’t remember him ever having smoked. So he must have quit while she was a very young child. And he, of course, was a minister. And two of his sons went into the ministry. So this was a very important topic to their family.
Evangel magazine?
A I don’t know.
Q Did she testify she read it?
A No.
She -- again, this is one of those things where I can’t exactly put it into her hands. I don’t know if she read it or not.
I do know that this was the Pentecostal message, and that her father was a minister. So I think it’s a fair historical deduction to say that these are the kinds of messages she would have been getting very consistently.
Q And in 1958, even this Pentecostal organization, which believed that, as you’ve testified, smoking was a sin, their magazine says that, "Heavy cigarette smoking speeds death seven to eight years before your time"; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. That’s — that particular article -- again, now I’ve flipped the page back, so I can’t reread it.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Page 33, Doctor.
A Okay. Yeah. Thank you.
It may be that that’s exactly what they
were saying there, because, of course, that is what Hammond and Horn were talking about: That they’re saying it’s a dose-dependent relationship; that the amount of the dose affects how seriously it harms you. And so they were trying to tell people that, you know, the bigger the dose, the worse it is. Although as a sin, of course, they believed that any dose whatsoever was sinful because you were harming the body.
That’s right. Let’s see. We’re talking about -- not pipe smoking -- I’m sorry. I’m on page 34 -- 32. I’m trying to go back and see if that quote is as you said it was.
Oh, yeah. Heavy cigarette smoking. Yeah. Thank you. You’re right. It’s "heavy cigarette smoking" in that particular quote.
Q So here we have a -- according to your testimony, we have a religious organization that believed that smoking is a sin and they are citing two of the leading antitobacco researchers of the era; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: They wanted to explain to readers why it was a sin. And so they felt it was a sin, not only because of this new cancer research on
bronchiocarcinoma, but the quote before that -- which actually, I didn’t read, but it’s right before that on page 33 -- they talked about one of the problems of it was that nicotine was a narcotic which brings about a craving for the drug, and it created a habit-forming -- it was habit-forming.
So that’s another way in which they felt it was sinful because you shouldn’t become a slave to any substance. And so they were very concerned about it for that reason as well. That was -BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, this was -- on the scale of anti-smoking zealotry of Hammond and Horn and the Church of God Evangel is on one end, from the messages being put out by the tobacco companies themselves.
Is that a fair statement?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I don’t know that that’s a fair statement.
I wouldn’t characterize them as "zealots," for example, just to take the first half of your sentence.
BY MR. NEALEY:
people not to smoke because they doctrinarily believe it to be a sin, is citing the best medical evidence they can come up with as to why you shouldn’t smoke; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: They were reporting the news pretty straight out in the same ways that, for example, the Vilas County News-Review did. They overlapped a lot in the way they covered the issue.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Did the Church of God Evangel magazine -did it include the position of the tobacco industry at the time?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No.
Most newspaper articles did not, nor did they -- that I recall. I’d have to go back and look at it to be certain there was no reference. But I don’t recall that being their focus at all.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And when we look at the 1950s and putting things into time, in 1958, this church magazine trying to convince people that smoking was a sin, doctrinarily, cites the best medical research they can come up with, and they say that, quote, "Heavy
cigarette smoking speeds death"; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, again, it’s a very long statement.
I’m not sure I would agree with all of it, but certainly, they were saying that lung cancer was a possible consequence, but going back to 1946, of course, they were calling it a form of suicide.
So -- and they also encouraged readers to be skeptical of advertisements for cigarettes and that kind of thing. So their emphasis wasn’t as much on sin as on health consequences. Sin was a part of it, but the focus was on the health ramifications.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Dr. Hoffman, what was "heavy smoking" in
1958?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I -- you know, I can tell you what the research said -- you know, they -sometimes they would -- I heard references -- people would say ten cigarettes. Some people would say two packs a day.
Again, you have to remember that public health officials were warning people that any form of smoking was not safe. And that they were also
telling them there was a relationship to dose; that the greater the dose, the greater the hazard.
But in the context of the 1950s, they were also very conscious that it was a matter of choice. This was the Cold War. Americans were being continuously told: Here’s information. You as a free person must make your own choice.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q What was "heavy smoking" in 1958?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, I can only tell you what I did. I don’t know what a medical definition would be.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, do you know what -- what the Church of God Evangel meant by "heavy cigarette smoking"?
A They were simply quoting Hammond and Horn.
I don’t think they were trying to give a definition.
Q Well, what did Hammond and Horn mean by "heavy cigarette smoking" as of 1958?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, I didn’t focus on what the dose was that they were particularly concerned about, especially because they always said: You shouldn’t smoke at all. But the more you smoked,
the worse it is. Because all of it is poison, which, of course, the children, like Victoria Waggoner, were being told in school at the same time.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, Ms. Waggoner -- at what age did she start smoking?
A I think she said she started smoking around 16, around 1959 and became a regular smoker in 1960.
Q So she started smoking in 1959 at age 16?
A Yes. That’s -- it’s slightly inconsistent in the testimony, but that seems to be the figure that’s most commonly cited.
Q And she became a regular smoker in 1960; is that correct?
A That’s what the testimony said.
Q Was she a heavy smoker between 1959 and
1960?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: My impression is that she was not. But I’d have to go back to my notes to freshen up on that particular detail.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q When did Victoria Waggoner become a heavy smoker?
THE WITNESS: I don’t think that that -- I don’t recall what she said in the testimony about that. I’d have to go back to the deposition. Sorry. BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, we can probably agree that if she’s not a regular smoker, she’s not a heavy smoker; right?
A Yeah. You think that between 1950 and 1960, it must have been infrequent.
Q And -- but you can’t identify any time that she would have become a heavy smoker; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I just don’t recall that detail right now. Sorry.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, you’re familiar with the position of the U.S. Surgeon General, as of today, that cigarette smoking is more addictive -- more addictive than heroin or cocaine; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, I’ve seen that referred to loosely. But, again, my focus has not been on, you know, the particulars -- comparisons between nicotine and other addictive substances. But
I’ve certainly heard that comparison made or seen that.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Have you read -- in your last 12 years working with the tobacco companies, have you read all the Surgeon General’s reports?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I don’t work with the tobacco companies, but I have seen that reference made, yeah.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So -- but you read and looked at the various Surgeon General’s reports; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. Of course, they have varied -- varied considerably over time as well.
I mean, as I’m sure you know, they said in 1964 that it wasn’t addictive; that by the medical definition of "addiction," that changed over time.
The medical addiction changed quite a bit in the 1980s under Everett Koop. So I’ve seen those references. And, of course, the materials and the attitudes of the medical profession have changed.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And does any place in the Church of God
Evangel that you looked at -- did they describe smoking cigarettes as more addictive than cocaine or heroin?
A In the 1950s, they called nicotine a narcotic, which brings about a craving. So, you know, obviously, they were grouping it in a class of substances, which are known to be very risky and very hazardous. But I don’t recall a specific comparison that they made.
Q And the Church of God Evangel, they didn’t refer to it as an addictive substance; they said it was a bad habit; right?
A You know, they might have called it "addictive."
That word, of course, is used interchangeably with craving or enslaving or habit-forming. So I’m honestly just looking at a couple of references on page 33. So I’d have to go back to the materials to see if they used the word "addictive."
My hunch is they probably did, but I’m not recalling it specifically.
Q Well, if they had used the word "addictive," you would have put it in your report; right, Dr. Hoffman?
THE WITNESS: No, not necessarily.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q You’d be very excited if they called it addictive; right?
MR. FOWLER: Oh, come on. Object to the form. Argumentative.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Right?
A No.
I like my research, but I don’t think that a particular word gets me excited.
Q Now, when you -- you mentioned that you talked to John Snetsinger?
I’m probably mispronouncing that. Maybe you can spell it for the court reporter.
A I’m going to hazard a guess here. I think it’s S-n-e-t-z-i-n-g-e-r.
Q You spelled it the same way I did, so we’re both wrong, I guess, if we’re wrong.
A Okay.
Q Dr. Hoffman, John Snetsinger -- how did you get in touch with John Snetsinger?
A Well, I’m not -- I think I just gave him a call. He works up at Cal Poly.
Q Who gave you his name?
A I think it was Michael Schaller told me that John was doing some related work.
Q So Michael Schaller told you John Snetsinger at Cal Poly was doing some work. And you understood that he was also working for -- on behalf of the tobacco companies; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I understood he was doing research on smoking and health and was an expert witness.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q An expert witness for the tobacco companies?
A Yeah.
MR. WALKER: Objection.
THE WITNESS: An expert witness for the defense in these tobacco cases.
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And was he also being paid by Mr. Purvis?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t know.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, did you call John Snetsinger in 1999,
2000, 2001 timeframe?
A No. I believe it was a bit later.
Q Okay.
What timeframe did you call Mr. Snetsinger and talk to him?
A Oh, I think my hunch might have been 2002,
2003	-- perhaps in there. So just slightly later.
Q Why did Dr. Schaller tell you to call Dr. Snetsinger?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, he didn’t tell me to
call him.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q What was the genesis of Mr. Snitzer’s [sic] name coming up when you were discussing these cases with Mr. Schaller?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Okay.
Well, again, I’m not 100 percent sure it was Michael Schaller who gave me his name, but I learned that Dr. Snetsinger was doing research on -he had done some research up at University of California Medical School in San Francisco on the anti-smoking movement and that 1970s, ’80s and ’90s. And I just found that very interesting and thought it
was very relevant to my work. So I contacted
Dr. Snetsinger to ask him about that, and, you know,
what archives he had found and that kind of thing.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And did you get materials from Dr. Snetsinger?
A I think I got a couple of articles from him, but not really -- not much. I basically got those on my own. He just told me primarily where he had gotten things, and so I went to the archives myself.
Q Okay.
So some materials Dr. Snetsinger gave you and some things he told you you could get at this archive, and he identified where the material was; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. That’s a fairly customary way for historians to work.
Sometimes we will share something, especially if you found something small that’s easy to share. And other times, we’ll -- and tell each other, you know: Oh, I -- you know, this is an archive that’s really great. It’s got a lot of pertinent information.
So in this case, I think it was something along that line.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And Dr. Snetsinger -- did you ever give him a copy of your report, or ask him to look at a copy of your report or look at any of your testimony?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No, I didn’t.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And I take it that Greg Black -- you never gave a copy of your report or any of your testimony and asked him if there was anything you were missing or for any comments; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. That would not be my normal process in historical work. I do that very infrequently on anything. But I did not do it in this case.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
And Richard Means -- I take it, that you didn’t give a copy of your report to Mr. Means, either, or any of your testimony and ask him if he had any comment or missed something or got something wrong; correct?
THE WITNESS: Yes. I was only asking him for a particular kind of information. So I had no reason to send him my broader report. And he didn’t ask for it.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, Dr. Snetsinger, have you -- in your search of secondary sources and your literature review, have you run across anything Mr. Snetsinger has ever published in the area of history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t recall. No, I don’t
think so.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And obviously, you don’t have any publications by Mr. Snetsinger on your reliance list, either; right?
A No.
As is customary, my focus is on primary records, so I don’t have anything by him.
Q Looking at the anti-smoking movement in the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, what was the first time that any place in the United States -- that there was a ban on smoking in any specific location?
A Oh, my goodness.
Well, I think that Massachusetts Bay Colony prohibited it for a time, or tried.
It’s kind of come and gone, historically speaking. You know, as you know, in different parts of the world, it’s been banned at different times.
But the more modern prohibition movement really got going in a big way in the early 20th Century and late 19th century, and there were several states which banned smoking altogether, including, I think, Wisconsin.
Q And we had a prohibition movement regarding alcohol in the United States, and a constitutional amendment in 1920 and repeal in 1933; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. There was a legal amendment, to -- that was at the federal level to prohibit alcohol, as is well known.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And, of course, in the Massachusetts Bay Colony or in any of the things you’re talking before, nobody was arguing for those bans because smoking caused lung cancer; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Not lung cancer, per se, no.
There was a lot of talk about throat cancer and lip cancer, but lung cancer is a -- what you might call a more modern disease.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So let’s look into the period of Ms. Waggoner’s life; okay?
In the 19 -- as you said, ’50s, ’60s,
’70’s and ’80s, can you identify in the ’50s, ’60s, 70’s and ’80s, in the modern era after there’s some information about lung cancer, what was the first ban on smoking in the United States, in any location?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, I kind of don’t understand the question.
Are you saying, were there other prohibition movements during the 1940s and ’50s?
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q No.
I’m asking: In the United States, what was the first place -- anywhere in the United States -- that passed a law restricting smoking from a particular area?
A Well, of course, smoking was illegal when Victoria Waggoner was a young woman -- a child. In
fact, she said she understood it was illegal. And so she got other people to buy cigarettes for her.
So it was banned for people her age, certainly, during the period of time that we’re talking about. But it wasn’t banned for adults. It was restricted in various ways where you could smoke and that kind of thing. But there was no general prohibition, except for young people.
Q What restrictions were placed on where adults could smoke in the 40s, 50s, ’60s and ’70s? What’s the first one you can identify?
A Well, you couldn’t smoke in school.
Q By law.
A Well, I’m actually not sure if this was by law. I can’t recall now. But Ms. Waggoner recalls that you were forbidden from smoking in school, and that there were "no smoking" signs. That was commonly the case; that in churches, like the Pentecostal church and schools like the schools she attended, that smoking was prohibited for everyone, adults as well as children. And that was of course in the ’40s, ’50s, ’60s, ’70’s and ’80s.
Q When was the time that there was a law banning, in a public place, that you could identify in the United States, in the modern era, prohibiting
smoking?
THE WITNESS: I believe I just answered that. Schools are public places.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Was there a law in Georgia or a law in Florida that banned smoking in schools?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’m sorry. I’d have to review my notes on that to remember if it was actually in law or simply school policy. I don’t recall.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Let me just ask: In Florida, what was the first jurisdiction in Florida to ban smoking in workplaces?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, in Florida and in Wisconsin, there was a time at the start of the 20th Century where it was entirely illegal to sell or manufacture cigarettes.
So if you want to talk about a really early, really comprehensive ban, that was true in Wisconsin between 1905 and 1915.
Florida -- in Florida, of course, there
was a shorter period of time, but it was also -- they also tried to make a law against it in Florida, as well, but that did not get implemented in quite the thorough way it was in Wisconsin where Ms. Waggoner was born and grew up.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q I’m not asking about the prohibition era. I’m asking in the -- from the ’50s forward, what was the first jurisdiction in the state of Florida that banned smoking in workplaces?
A I don’t recall offhand. I don’t know.
Q What -MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q As we’re looking at historical events, what was the first -- the timeframe of the first jurisdiction in Florida that banned smoking in workplaces?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I’m sorry, Mr. Nealey, but I think the answer is still the same: The first time it was banned was at the start of the century. Later, there were bans, again, in the 1970s. Sometimes, individual employers would simply ban it.
There was also a period of time where I
think it was banned in the prisons, too, but I can’t give you an exact date and time for all of those. Certainly they’re part of my larger knowledge of this, but I don’t recall the specific dates.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q As to Florida, you just mentioned the 1970s. What was the timeframe when the first jurisdiction in Florida -- in the modern era, not talking prohibition; I’m talking from the ’50s forward -- what was the timeframe when the first jurisdiction in Florida banned smoking in workplaces?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t know which would have been the first community to do that.
Obviously, at some point, it got to the state level. But before that, typically, communities did, but I don’t know which one was first in Florida. BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Was it in the ’60s, and the ’70s and the ’80s that the first community in Florida banned smoking in workplaces?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, since I don’t know which was the very first one, I can’t really answer that.
There was a giant rash of them in the early ’70s, of course, but there could have been one in the ’60s for all I know.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q When did the State of Florida ban smoking in workplaces, in the modern era?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Right. I don’t remember.
I’d have to look back over my notes to see when one of the first Clean Air Acts was passed. I think it was in the early ’70s, but I’m not sure about that.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Your testimony is that you believe that in the early ’70s, that was the first time that Florida statewide banned smoking in workplaces?
A You know, again, I just really can’t answer that question. I’d have to review my notes to give you a specific date. I wouldn’t want to give you the wrong date.
I can give you an estimate as to the time period, but --
Q Well, what’s your estimate as to the timeframe that Florida first banned smoking in workplaces statewide?
A Well, of course, there was the elevator
ruling, and then there were rulings about you must have a smoking area. Then ultimately -- I think it was in the ’80s, maybe early ’90s, where they said: Okay, statewide, even smoking areas are out.
So it was a progression that got more intense as time went by. I don’t remember when the exact Clean Air Act went into effect.
Q Would it surprise you if I told you that it wasn’t in the ’70s, wasn’t in the ’80s -- it wasn’t even in the ’90s?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, then that could be -in fact, I remember one of the -- again, as I said, there were kind of different tiers that got more restrictive as time went. And I remember one of the deponents saying that she was very proud to have voted for the Florida Anti-smoking Act of, I think,
2004	or something like that.
Of course, you know, I’ve been focusing on this particular research related to Ms. Waggoner on the period up to the time when she quit smoking. So obviously at some moment, she banned it herself.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Would it surprise you, Dr. Hoffman, that the first state to ban smoking in workplaces in the
United States was the State of California in 1998?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I know California had a lot of Clean Air Acts before that beginning in the ’70s. But it may be -- it would never surprise me to think that California was first, being a Californian. But -BY MR. NEALEY:
Q You know, Dr. Hoffman, having spent 12 years working in this area, that the first state to ban smoking in workplaces was California, and it happened in 1998; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: As I’ve told you, I don’t have a specific chronology in front of me, but I know California has been first and a leader in this for many years. It was the second, for example, in 1959 -- the second state ever to say,
comprehensively: All smoking is bad for you. Lester Breslow, who was the head of the California Department of Public Health made that statement back then.
So, you know, this piece of information that you’re focusing on is a part of a very large and very long -- very long pattern.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And, in fact, in Florida, the smoking in workplaces was not banned until a constitutional amendment voted on by people in Florida was implemented in 2003; right, Dr. Hoffman?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, my focus has been on what people knew about the harms. It’s not been on the focus of -- focused on legislation and how people have progressively implemented that. I’m very interested in it, and it’s a part of my research, but I can’t tell you whether it was by constitutional amendment or what process it was done. It came up repeatedly in the legislature, of course.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Dr. Hoffman, your claim is, there was a state ban in workplaces back in the ’70s on smoking in workplaces, was just wrong; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No, it’s -MR. FOWLER: Misstates her testimony.
MR. WALKER: That’s not what she said.
MR. FOWLER: Objecting.
THE WITNESS: Yeah. And I don’t think that is what I said. If I did, I certainly misspoke.
What I was saying is that different employers banned it at different times. So as a statewide thing, I don’t think that was the case.
As I said, it began in places like elevators, usually. And of course, the FAA banned it in planes after a particular time. So it was kind of piecemeal, but it was definitely trending in a certain direction.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well -- and let’s talk about the FAA, so that we understand and we’re not, you know, applying a presentist bias here.
When did the FAA first ban smoking in
airplanes?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form. Move to strike the preamble.
THE WITNESS: Again, I’d have to consult my, you know, notes to give you the precise date.
In history nowadays, we focus not so much on knowing the exact date for everything; although, we do know and we keep track of them, but we don’t expect to have a pop quiz on them.
The FAA began this process in the late 1960s, and it was Ralph Nader who first charged that people should not be subjected to secondhand smoke in
planes. So initially, I think it was, like, early 1970s -- ’71, ’72, in there -- where they required airlines to have separate sections for smoking and smoke-free areas. And then as time went on -- and I don’t recall now the precise year, they then banned it altogether on flights under two hours, which, of course, is the vast majority of flights. And then, eventually, as we know, it was banned altogether.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
And so you’re talking back to the things -- what the airline was required to do was put a little sign and you could smoke in front -- you could smoke behind the sign but not in front of the sign; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, that’s how I recall it from personal experience, yes.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
So when we look at the times, you get on an airplane in the 60s, ’70s and the ’80s, and there would be a little sign that would say: Row 7, or row 8, or row 11 or whatever it was, and if you were on -- in row 10, you couldn’t smoke in row 10; but if
you were in row 11, you could smoke in row 11; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t think it lasted as long as you are indicating there. I don’t think it went into the ’80s.
But in any case, when there were separate smoking sections, yes, it was true, as it was also in places like restaurants or even outdoor smoking areas; that you could smoke within that area, but you couldn’t smoke outside the designated area.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And what year -- what year -- well, let me just ask: What decade, do you believe, Dr. Hoffman, that the FAA instituted its two-hour rule banning smoking on flights below two hours?
A I’m going to guesstimate the ’70s, but were I -- drawing up a chart, of course, I could give you this precise date, but I can’t this morning.
Q And what era do you believe that the FAA banned smoking on flights under six hours?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I just don’t recall the six-hour rule. So I don’t know.
BY MR. NEALEY:
smoking in airplanes came into effect in 1988 -would that surprise you, Dr. Hoffman?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I wouldn’t be surprised if I went back to my notes and found that. You know, I’d have to do it. It strikes me as that’s awfully late, but I might be wrong.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Yeah. But if we want to talk about the times, and what people knew and you want to understand what’s going on, wouldn’t it be kind of a very different attitude if you believe that smoking was banned in airplanes in the ’70s, and it turns out it really wasn’t banned until 1988?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No, not at all.
People knew extensively about the harms, and they knew about it throughout that time period. There was a lot of debate about it, there was a lot of legislative activity around it, a lot of popular organizing that went into those various bans.
But you have to remember, this was also a period of time which there was a lot of emphasis on free choice, and all those years of the years of the Cold War and, again, the idea is that Americans don’t
believe in what Europeans would call a "nanny state". And so that’s one reason why it -- it was a gradual process, because Americans knew they were giving up some element of personal choice. And Americans are very -- we’re kind of crotchety about that. So that would not surprise me.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Do you know who wrote the law that banned smoking on flights of less than two hours?
A No. I don’t know offhand. I don’t think that’s a part of -- pardon me?
Q Is the name Frank Lautenberg ringing a bell for you, Doctor?
A No, it doesn’t.
Q Does the fact that that law banning smoking was only passed in 1987 and went into effect in ’88 -- does that ring a bell?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I just didn’t focus on that kind of fine detail, like who was the legislative analyst or legislator who suggested it. And, of course, it varied state by state as well.
Not, of course, in the case of FAA rules. Those would have been nationwide.

BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Right. It’s -A So, I —
(Simultaneous discussion interrupted by
the reporter)
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q You’re right. You thought that the FAA had banned smoking on airplanes in the ’70s; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, they restricted it severely, because people knew that it was hazardous. BY MR. NEALEY:
Q You thought, Dr. Hoffman, that the FAA had banned smoking on airplanes back in the ’70s; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No.
As I told you, I wasn’t certain about the particular dates of the process. And I can easily recall them if I just go back to my notes, but I don’t recall those particular dates off the top.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, you also mentioned that you talked to -- and I’ll butcher the name -- a Robert Schulzinger?
A Yes. That’s correct.
Q And could you spell that for the court reporter.
A Yes. I believe that one is spelled S-c-h-u-l-z-i-n-g-e-r.
Q And how did you get in touch with Mr. Schulzinger?
A I was on a committee for the U.S. State Department with him.
Q Did somebody tell you that he was working on tobacco-related work?
A He told me.
Q He told you.
He told you he had been hired by the tobacco companies?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, who did he say had hired him?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: He was working as an expert witness with Johnson, Tyler & Purvis. He wasn’t hired by a tobacco company.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So he was also working with Mr. Purvis; is that correct?
A You know, I’m not sure if he was working with that gentleman, per se. But -- we didn’t talk about it at any great length.
Q So you’re both saying -- now, what’s his historical area of expertise?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: He writes fairly broadly.
He’s done textbooks on American history, I think.
I don’t follow his particular career very, very closely, but he’s written on American history, generally, as well as on U.S. foreign relations.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
His area of expertise is U.S. foreign relations in the 20th Century; right?
A That would be one of his areas of expertise.
Q So you just -- you both on a state department committee dealing with foreign relations, and he just happens to mention that: By the way, I’m also working with the Purvis law firm as an expert for the tobacco companies?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
///
Q Now, when you did your secondary-source research, did you find any publications or book chapters or anything on the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses that’s ever been published by Mr. Schulzinger?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, he might have it in his textbook. But I don’t know. I don’t think I’ve read his particular textbook.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And you certainly don’t cite anything by Mr. Schulzinger on your reliance list; right?
A No. I generally don’t cite secondary sources because, for historians, we always consider the primary source the real authoritative, you know, data that we work from. So that’s what I wanted to give you.
Q Would you have a -- did you get any sources or discuss any materials that Mr. Schulzinger might have?
A No. Huh-uh.
Q Did you ever -- in what timeframe did you talk to Mr. Schulzinger?
A I would guess around 2006 -- something
like that -- 2005, possibly.
Q So when you’re sitting in a -- I take it that this discussion with Mr. Schulzinger was in person?
A Yes, it was.
Q And did you say: Hey, here’s my theory or here’s what I looked at; is there something I’m missing? Do you have any suggestions?
Did you ever discuss anything like that?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I didn’t think it was
necessary.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Did you say: Hey, is there anything you’ve got that you suggest I go look at?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I did not. I felt very fully informed at that point.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And when you talked to Mr. Schulzinger, did you -- did you -- have you ever given him your report or any of your testimony and ask him to give you an informal peer-review?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
necessary.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, you next talked to -- you said Chester Patch?
A Yes.
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And how did you come to be in contact with Chester Patch?
A I’ve known him for, oh, 15 years.
Something like that.
Q Well, how did you come to talk with him about the work, or mentioning or discussing the work that you were doing in the tobacco cases?
A We were just standing in line at a lunch line at a conference, and he mentioned it.
Q He mentioned that he was also working for the tobacco companies as an expert witness?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: He didn’t say he was working for the tobacco companies.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Was he also working for the Johnson,
Taylor & Purvis [sic] firm?
A No. I believe by that point that firm had
disbanded. I’m not sure which firm he was consulting with.
Q Was it -- but he was consulting with law firms who were representing the tobacco companies in litigation; right?
A Yes. That’s right.
Q And it was pretty well known by now that you were doing this kind of work amongst all the other people doing this kind of work; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t know.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
But it was well-enough known that Charles Patch, who you know, came up and said: Oh, well, I’m also working for lawyers -- and testifying on behalf of the tobacco companies; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, he mentioned to me that he was doing that work. So I mean as I say, we’ve known each other for a long time. So I don’t know how he knew that, but -- you know, I just don’t know.
BY MR. NEALEY:
literature, have you found anything that’s ever been published by Charles Patch in the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I think he’s been working on this only fairly recently.
MR. WALKER: Hey, Scott. We’ve been going for about an hour. If you come to a good point, I’d like for us to take a break.
MR. NEALEY: Let me just finish with Mr. Patch, and then we can take a break.
MR. WALKER: Okay.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q When did you have this discussion with Charles Patch -- Chester Patch?
A I’m trying to remember. I think it was six months or a year ago. Something like that.
Q Do you know when he was first hired to work in these areas?
A No. I don’t know.
Q Okay.
Did you discuss the substance of any of your opinions or the work you’ve done with Charles Patch -- Chester Patch?
A We just had a casual conversation about
it. You know, so, yes, I talked to him a little bit about my findings.
Q And did you ask him for any sort of informal peer-review -- give him a copy of your report, give him your testimony, and ask him if he’s got any suggestions?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. That would not be my normal process, so I did not do it in this case, either.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Did you share any sources with Chester Patch?
A Well, I think -- now that you mention it,
I remember I was talking about an archive to which we had both traveled, which is kind of a coincidence, but we both -- at UCLA and at the film and television archives in Beverly Hills. So we just kind of compared notes on that, in a very informal way, though.
Q But you didn’t give him your resource list and said: Gee, is there something I missed; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I felt my list was more than adequate.
Q And you didn’t give Chester Patch -- he didn’t give you any list that he had to see if there was something he missed; right?
A No. I didn’t ask him for anything like
that.
Q Have you had any subsequent discussions other than this meeting in the lunch line at a historical conference six months to a year ago?
A Yes. We discussed it over dinner last summer.
Q This is summer of 2011?
A Yes. That’s correct.
Q Is that the only other time you’ve discussed or had a meeting with Chester Patch?
A Yes, that I recall.
Q And at the dinner, did you bring anything with you?
A My purse and a sweater.
Q You didn’t give him a copy of your report or any of your reliance list or anything and ask him for comments, did you?
A No, I did not.
Q Did he give you any copy of his reliance list or anything he was looking at or ask for any
comments on anything?
THE WITNESS: No. We discussed a variety of historical topics that we’re both interested in, and in none of those cases did we share notes or reliance lists or current writing projects. So we didn’t in this case, either.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
And with Mr. Patch, and your conversations with him, and the second time when you guys had dinner together, did he give you any -- discuss any sources that he’d looked at, or did you discuss any sources you’d looked at, with him?
A I think that’s when we talked about the UCLA television archives and the archives in Beverly Hills.
Q And I take it that you’re unaware of anything from your literature review that Chester Patch has ever published in the area of history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
Q Okay.
What do you know Chester Patch is -what’s his area of history he’s published in?
A Oh, he focuses a lot on communications, television. He’s written about the presidency.
Writes a lot about the ’50s and ’60s, ’70s. He’s written on everything from Eisenhower to Reagan. So he, of course, has looked quite extensively at this same period of time in which these issues became so prominent in American life.
Q And with Chester Patch, is he working with Jones Day?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t know.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And for the second meeting, did you -- did you just call him, or he calls you up or e-mails? Or how did this second dinner happen?
A We talked over e-mail about getting together for dinner, socially.
MR. NEALEY: Okay. You asked for a break. Let’s take a short break.
MR. WALKER: Okay. Five minutes?
MR. NEALEY: Yup.
(Off the record: 11:29 A.M.-11:34 A.M.)
MR. NEALEY: Back on the record.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Dr. Hoffman, the next person you mentioned that you had discussed your work with was Michael Parrish, if I’m pronouncing that correctly?
A Yes.
Q Okay.
And how do you spell Parrish?
A P-a-r-r-i-s-h.
Q Okay.
And how did you come to be in contact with Michael Parrish?
A Well, I worked with him. It was the first job I had out of graduate school was at UCSD, which is where he works. So that’s how I came to be in contact with him.
Q Okay.
Well, regarding your work on -- as an expert witness for the tobacco companies, how did you come in contact with Michael Parrish?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’m sorry. I don’t -- could you restate that for me, please? I’m sorry.
Q Regarding your work as an expert witness for the tobacco companies, how did you come in contact with Michael Parrish?
MR. WALKER: Same objection.
THE WITNESS: Well, we didn’t -- I never really came into contact with him much in that respect, but I learned from an attorney with Jones Day, I believe, that Michael Parrish had done some consulting work along these lines.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So an attorney at Jones Day told you that Michael Parrish was also working as an expert witness on behalf of the tobacco companies; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. That’s how I recall.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And who was the attorney at Jones Day who told you this?
A Well, I think it might have been Paul Koethe. But I might have also learned it from Julia Tyler at Johnson, Tyler & Purvis. I’m just not really recalling it at the moment.
Q And what timeframe did you learn this from them that Michael Parrish was working as an expert
witness also for the tobacco companies?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I learned that he was working as an expert witness, I think, around 2005. Something like that.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And so you heard from either somebody at Johnson, Taylor & Purvis [sic] or Jones Day that Michael Parrish was also an expert in around 2005, and did you then call him?
A No, I did not.
Q Did you -- how did you come to -- did he call you?
A No. He did not.
Q Did you guys meet? Did you e-mail?
What was the form of your communication regarding your work on these cases?
A It’s going to sound kind of funny, but I think it might have been another lunch line, or dinner line or something -- you know, at a conference. So I said something: Oh, I hear you’re working on smoking and health. Something like that.
I mean, we’ve only perhaps talked about it one time very briefly.
Q Okay.
So you knew that he was doing this because you had been told by lawyers, and then you just ran into him at another conference?
A Yes. That’s right.
Q Now, Michael Parrish, when you did your literature reviews, have you ever found anything that Michael Parrish has ever published in the area of history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I haven’t run into anything he’s written on the subject.
As I understand it, he’s researching it for the same reason I am, which is to understand it, so as to be able to testify as to the historical circumstances. And that’s the primary reason it seems to me he was doing that work.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, when you talked to Parrish, did you ever share any sources with him or discuss any source materials with him?
A No. Just in the same way that he and I share a lot of other interests as well. We do research in some similar areas, and we just don’t get together to talk about our sources. It’s just kind
of not how it works in the history business. I did not do so in this case, either.
Q Did you provide any of your reports or any of your trial testimony and ask him to -- for comments or peer-review or critique?
A No. That would not be customary, so I did not do that.
Q And did he give you any suggestions of places to look or vice versa for materials?
A No. Not that I recall.
Q The next historian who you said you discussed your work -- was -- I wrote this down, and I’m probably right -- I have James something Martin?
A James Kirby Martin.
Q I’m glad I didn’t do it because I thought
I	had written "Curly."
So James Kirby Martin.
And how did you come to discuss your work with -- in these cases with James Kirby Martin?
A I heard he had done some research on a -on an African-American newspaper in Tampa. And I was doing some research on that paper, too. So I contacted him to ask him, you know, what he had found.
Q Now, how did you come to learn that James
Kirby Martin was also looking at the same African-American newspaper in Tampa?
A I’m not 100 percent sure, but I believe Paul Koethe from Jones Day mentioned to me that Dr. Martin had been doing some research on this newspaper, like me.
Q Okay.
So you believe the lawyer at Jones Day told you that James Kirby Martin was also looking or had looked at this African-American newspaper in Tampa; is that correct?
A Yes. He knew, of course, about Dr. Martin’s research, because Dr. Martin was working with him. So he told me about it.
Q And you anticipated my next question, which was: James Kirby Martin was also hired as an expert in this case by Jones Day to testify on behalf of the tobacco companies; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I -- as I understood it, he was working for Jones Day on smoking and health, which would have, in this case, been pertinent to these cases -- the cases in Florida.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Yeah.
When you -- when you did your literature review, did you find anything that James Kirby Martin has ever published in the area of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I didn’t come across any publications of his on that subject.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And so I take it that you got in contact with James Kirby Martin?
A Yes, I did.
Q And how many times did you talk to him?
Did you meet with him? E-mail him? What was your communication?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: As I best recall it, we spoke maybe two or three times on the phone. He’s in Texas, so it’s quite far from me in California. I did not -- I never met him in person.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Yeah.
And did you obtain some information or suggestions of places to find information or vice versa, with him?
A It confirmed largely what I already knew. But, yeah, we discussed materials that can be found in the archives of the Tampa -- I can’t remember the name of the university now -- University of Southern Florida in Tampa. So, he had done some research there and found articles. And I went back and found some of the ones he found but also found some additional ones.
Q So you guys compared what you had each found in your research in that particular archive?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yeah. There, we were doing a very similar thing. So we compared notes, so to speak.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q In an informal way, in the sense that you just discussed what you found, or did you actually send him a list or vice versa of what you had each found?
A No. He had sent me some things he had found. I can’t remember if I sent him some things back. I just don’t recall. I went there after he did.
Q So certainly, he sent you some of what he found at the archive, and then you may have sent him
some additional stuff that you found after he had sent you stuff?
A Yes. We were sharing information there, as you sometimes will do in history.
Q And what time did this -- did these conversations and the sharing of information with Mr. Martin take place?
A Oh, I’m not sure offhand. I want to say
2	007 maybe. 2 008.
Q Okay.
And have you talked to him since?
A No. I haven’t spoken to him in a while.
Q Did you ever share your reports or any of your testimony with him?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I did not do that. Wouldn’t be my -BY MR. NEALEY:

Q Did you ever ask for a form of informal peer-review from Mr. Martin on your work?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. That wouldn’t be customary, so I did not.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, the next thing you mentioned is William Stueck. And he’s at the University of Georgia?
A Yes. I believe so.
Q And you know Mr. Stueck very well; right?
A No, I do not.
Q Now, how did you come to be in touch with William Stueck?
A I’m trying -- oh, he was in -- because he’s in Georgia, I became aware that he was doing some similar kinds of research. And I contacted him at one point to ask if he had any graduate students who might be able to assist me in obtaining some newspaper records that were available only in Georgia.
Q When did you call Professor Stueck?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’m going to guess around
2008.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And Paul Koethe gave you Mr. Stueck’s
name?
A I don’t recall.
Q Well, one of the lawyers gave you Mr. Stueck’s name; right?
A No. It could have been Professor Schaller, for example. I just don’t recall. But it might have been.
Q Okay.
So either Dr. Schaller or one of the lawyers gave you Mr. Stueck’s name; correct?
MR. FOWLER: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. Although, I knew of his work. I’ve -- you know, I’m familiar with him as a historian, so it wasn’t an unknown quantity.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, when you talk about Mr. Stueck’s work and not being an unknown quantity, has Mr. Stueck ever published in the area of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses?
THE WITNESS: Not that I’m aware of.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And certainly, you didn’t run across anything by Mr. Stueck when you did your literature review that he’s ever published in the area of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I have not found him in my literature review.
Although keep in mind, in the history business, it’s a little different from some of the sciences where there’s more emphasis on secondary literature. In the history profession, we focus primarily on primary sources.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, so -- and you knew when you called Mr. Stueck -- or Dr. Stueck -- that he was also an expert witness for the tobacco companies; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I knew that he was an expert witness for one of the law firms.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Did you have one conversation with him or
a couple?
How -- what was your interaction with him?
A I don’t recall. I might have sent him an e-mail and said, "Hey, can I give you a call?"
Seems like we just had a couple brief interactions. As I said, I don’t know him well.
Q And did you share any sources with him?
A No. I don’t believe so.
Q Did he give you any materials?
A No, not personally. I did work with a graduate student of his.
Q You got materials from a graduate student of his?
A Yes.
Q And were they materials that Mr. Stueck had collected or the graduate student collected from Mr. Stueck, or were they materials that you had the graduate student get?
A They were materials that I engaged the graduate student to find for me, from two newspapers that I identified and that I wanted to get some information from. Because these collections were available only in Georgia, I thought it was most efficient to get a graduate student to do the initial
search, which, of course, is something I have also done here in California and would be a normal part of my practice as a historian.
Q Did you share any of your reports or your testimony with Dr. Stueck and ask him for comments or some form of informal peer-review?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No, I did not.
MR. NEALEY: The court reporter -- if I could have you mark as Exhibit 4, Dr. Stueck’s report.
THE REPORTER: Off the record.
(Off the record: 11:49 A.M.-11:50 A.M.)
MR. NEALEY: Back on the record.
Off the record, we marked several documents. And so that the record is clear, we have marked the notice to the deposition as Exhibit 1. We have marked Dr. Hoffman’s expert report in Waggoner as Exhibit 2.
We have marked her materials list, which is entitled "Waggoner-Cobbs Hoffman Materials,"
April 19th, 2011, which is a 248-page document, as Exhibit 3.
(Exhibit 3 marked)
report of William Stueck as Exhibit 4.
(Exhibit 4 marked)
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Dr. Hoffman, I take it that you’ve never seen Dr. Stueck’s report?
MR. WALKER: If I could just jump in, I’m I don’t think you mentioned this -- the report that was marked as Exhibit 4 is Dr. Stueck’s report from the Duke case, just so that it’s clear which report it is you’re referring to.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Have you ever seen this, Dr. Hoffman?
A No, I have not.
Q Okay.
And -- but you did know, before I showed this to you, that William Stueck, who’s a professor at the University of Georgia, is also an expert witness for the tobacco companies; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. I’m aware that he’s done expert-witness testimony.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
And Dr. Stueck, if you look at page 8 of his report, he cites as his article II a book by
Cassandra Tate called "The Cigarette Wars: The Triumph of the Little White Slaver" -A Yes, I see that.
Q -- from 1999?
A Yes, I see that.
Q Have you seen that book?
A Yes, I have.
Q You’ve read that book?
A Yes, I have.
Q Cassandra Tate is a historian; right?
A I don’t know if she still is, but this was a history -- thesis, I believe.
Q And this was actually published as a book; right?
A It was published as a dissertation and as a book, yes.
Q Okay.
And you’ve read that book; right?
A Yes, I have.
Q Okay.
But that book isn’t on your reliance list. Is there a reason why?
A Yes, there is.
Q What’s that reason?
A The -- a number of materials I’ve read is
too voluminous to include everything. I compiled the list that I thought was representative of my findings and of the general universe of information on this topic.
So as I mentioned before, my emphasis is on primary records. That’s true of most historians as I’ve always understood it. There are many historians, in fact -- some who will start by reading only the primary record and then go back later to the secondary record. People have different ways of approaching things. But as historians, we always believe that the primary record is the -- is the most important record. That’s why on my reliance list, you’ll find 99.9 percent of things, documents are primary sources.
So Cassandra Tate’s -- I believe I -- I probably refer to it in my report. Or at least I might have. Maybe I did; maybe I didn’t. I don’t know. But I’ve read her book, but it would not be, you know -- terribly important thing on my reliance list.
For example, in Wisconsin, it was illegal to smoke, and Cassandra Tate talks about that. But I would focus on the Wisconsin law. And that’s what I would think was most important to cite.
So it’s always a question of what you think as a writer, or research is most important to bring forward to give a representative and fair report.
Q There’s also -- if you go to page 22 of Dr. Stueck’s report, footnote 48, Dr. Stueck cites to Allan Brandt’s book, "The Cigarette Century: The Rise and Fall of the Deadly Persistence of the Product That Defined America," a book published in 2007.
Have you read Allan Brandt’s book?
A Yes, I have.
Q And you’re certainly aware of the contents of that book.
Is that fair to say?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’ve read the book.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q You’ve read the book.
And if you look at page 29, there is a book by -- in footnote 64 -- there’s a book by Richard Krueger, "Ashes to Ashes: America’s 100-Year Cigarette War, the Public Health and the Unabashed Triumph of PhilipMorris," which was published in 1996.
Have you read Krueger’s book "Ashes to
Ashes"?
A Yes. I’ve read many, many books, and that’s one of them.
Q Now, when we look at the many, many books that you’ve read -- by the way, when you read Brandt’s book, and Krueger’s book and Tate’s book, you didn’t read that and put it out of your mind; you read and considered what they had to say; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: All the materials I read I give careful consideration to.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And you also looked to see if there was some sources that they had cited in their book; right?
A Sometimes.
You know, I don’t look at every footnote, no. I look at some which I thought were particularly interesting or that referenced aspects of the topic I hadn’t thought about before, so then I would look at a footnote. But I don’t look at all the footnotes.
Q All three of those books, there are detailed reference citations to particular documents and information sources; correct?
THE WITNESS: Well, they’re all -- as I recall, all footnoted books. And so, yes, they would indicate where the author got the information they did.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And you would agree with Dr. Stueck that as part of the historical method when one reads a secondary source, one pays particular attention to the materials that are cited therein to see if there is something that one needs to look at or consider; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
MR. FOWLER: Also mischaracterizes Dr. Stueck’s testimony. So objection.
THE WITNESS: I can tell you why I look at footnotes. I don’t know why he does. But I assume it’s the same reason anyone does, which is that you want to see where the person got information.
You generally don’t look at every footnote, even in a book that pertains very closely to your subject. Sometimes books have different emphases.
Those three books all have a particular focus they were taking. So some of their interest --
footnotes would be of interest to me, and others I would just glance at and, you know, wouldn’t pay a lot of attention to. It would vary.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, Dr. Stueck -- if you look at page 16 -- writes the following sentence -A Give me half a sec, just so I can get to
16.
Okay. I’m there now. Thank you.
Q And as background, this Duke case involves somebody who was a child in the ’40s and early ’50s. And Dr. Stueck writes, quote -- in paragraph 27 -"Although a sharp reduction occurred in efforts to prohibit tobacco products, during Sarah Holmes’ childhood and cigarette consumption increased . . . "
Would you agree that in the ’30s and ’40s, that cigarette consumption increased, and that there was a sharp reduction in efforts to prohibit tobacco products?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form. Move to strike the preamble.
THE WITNESS: I can tell you that my research showed that prohibition movements, in general, underwent a profound change in the 1930s.
For example, with alcohol, there was, you
know, a reversal of the Volstead Act. And so there was a -- the country in general stopped -- went more in the direction of regulation than prohibition, because they found that prohibition didn’t -- as they would say, "Didn’t work." People wanted to use these things anyway, and so it tended to create a lot of organized crime to respond to the demand. So there wasn’t -- I would agree with that first half of the sentence, that there was a refocusing.
For example in Wisconsin -- since we’re using the Waggoner case as our focus today -- one of the things that happens is that they start having a temperance day, and it’s organized around Francis Willard, who was a founding member of the women’s Christian Temperance Union and happened to be a Wisconsin native. So there was -- so prohibition kind of morphs into restriction and in to more of a -- encouraging people voluntarily to do the right thing, rather than forcing them to do that. So that’s kind of the first second -- first half of that sentence.
"Cigarette consumption increased" -- I -you know, I know that as a general truth. I don’t have the specific statistics in front of me. And, of course, Gallup polls don’t start until the 1930s.
So I’m not sure he would measure the increase of consumption. Possibly by looking at reports of the U.S. Department of Commerce, something like that. But I think it did -- of course, the population as a whole increased. So I don’t see why that wouldn’t be true, but I haven’t focused on that because that wasn’t the focus of my research.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, in all these 12 years you’ve been looking at this, you do know the period of time when cigarette consumption on a per capita basis was at its highest in the U.S.; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’m aware that in the 1950s, the Gallup polls showed that peak usage as a percentage of the population was basically 1954.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And the highest consumption of cigarettes on a per capita basis as shown by, as you said, production and sale of cigarettes in the universe was from the period of 1965 to 1967; right, Dr. Hoffman?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
MR. FOWLER: Objection. Mischaracterizes her testimony.
you kind of take that apart for me.
There’s per capita, there’s quantity of tobacco, there’s a number of people in the population who smoke -- the percentage of people in the population that smoke is quite complicated. So if we take it apart piece by piece, I might do a better job of answering your question more accurately.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Dr. Hoffman, when was the period of time in years that cigarette consumption on a per capita basis was at its highest in the United States?
A I don’t know. I know that the per capita -- I mean, the percentage of people who used it was highest in the ’50s, and it went down consistently from there. But I just don’t know the per capita figures on consumption.
Q What’s your source for the fact that cigarette consumption as a percentage of the population was highest in the ’50s?
A Primarily Gallup polls. But there would be -- I think it’s the Gallup poll that really gives us that baseline. After that, there are a variety of polls of course that show that trend -- government polls and such, but the Gallup poll to me is where we start.
Q Okay.
Now, you mentioned, also, that you talked to Greg Michelle.
Who put you in touch with Greg Michelle?
A Well, Greg Michelle contacted me.
Q And who gave Greg Michelle your name?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t know. I mean, it could well -- I just don’t know, but I would guess Paul Koethe at Jones Day, but he might have just called me because he knows of me.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And Greg Michelle identified he was an expert working for the tobacco companies as well; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. He contacted me in the context of doing research on smoking and health.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And have you, in your review of secondary materials and journal articles and publications -has Greg Michelle ever published in the area of the history of public attitudes toward smoking and related illnesses?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Not that I’m aware of.
Q And you certainly haven’t ever run across any articles he’s published in the area of the history of public attitudes toward smoking and related illnesses; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. Not that I recall.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And Mr. Michelle asked you for some information on pulling some documents in California; is that correct?
A No. He didn’t ask me for any particular information.
He asked if I knew of anyone who might be able to help him as I had been helped myself at other times by researchers in different parts of the country. So he needed some help finding some newspaper information in California, because not every archive carries everything. And so these things tend to be spread out all over the place.
Q Did you discuss any sources or materials that you might consider or Mr. Michelle might consider?
A No.
Q And did you provide him a copy of your report or any of your testimony and ask him for some form of informal peer-review?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I didn’t, because that would not be my usual process as a historian.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Have you ever talked to Dr. Persinnian at the University of Tampa?
A No. I don’t know that person.
Q In all your work with -- over these last 12 years and in your review of journal articles and publications, have you ever seen anything published by Dr. Persinnian from the University of Tampa in the area of the history of public attitudes toward smoking and related illnesses?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Not that I recall.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Do you know Dr. Roberts at Purdue?
A What’s the full name of that individual?
Q Dr. Roberts -- I’ll come up with his first name if you wanted me to -A I don’t know --
Q He’s a professor of sports history at the
university -- at Purdue.
THE WITNESS: No. I just don’t recall a Dr. Roberts. I might have met somebody by that name, but I don’t recall it.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Do you recall meeting or talking with somebody named Dr. Roberts from Purdue University regarding your work on health and smoking issues?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I don’t recall that.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q How about a Dr. Geer at Vanderbilt University? Ever talked to him about health or smoking issues?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, I ask for a first name just because it might help my jog my memory better, honestly. But I don’t recall offhand. I know someone else at Vanderbilt, but I don’t recall a Dr. Geer, did you say?
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q G-e-e-r.
A No. I don’t know anybody by that name that I remember.
Q His first name is John Geer.
A No. I just remember Will Geer.
Q Okay.
Is that somebody you talked to about your work with smoking and health?
A This is how I know how old you are,
Mr. Nealey. Will Geer used to be a famous actor.
Q Oh, okay.
And Dr. Roberts’ first name by the way, since you ask, is Randy Roberts.
A Okay.
No, that really doesn’t ring a bell.
Sorry.
Q Okay.
And certainly, I take it that in your research looking at journals and articles and things that have been published, you’ve never run acrost any publications by Dr. Randy Roberts at Purdue University on the issue of the history of public attitudes toward smoking and related illnesses; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t recall any articles by a Randy Roberts.
Again, I focus more on the primary sources
than on the secondary sources. I don’t recall that at all.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And you haven’t ever run acrost a Dr. John Geer from Vanderbilt University, who’s published in the area of the history of public attitudes toward smoking and related illnesses?
MR. WALKER: Object to the form.
MR. FOWLER: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t recall an individual by that name.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, have you ever discussed the work you’ve done or the research you’ve done with any historian who wasn’t also employed as an expert witness by the tobacco companies?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, I have.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q What other historians who were not employed by the tobacco companies have you discussed your work over the last 12 years?
A Oh, any -- probably any number, beginning probably with my -- the chair of my department at the time I start -- undertook this work, whose name is
Harry McDean.
Q Any others?
A Yeah. Let me think.
I’ve discussed it with Bruce Schulman, who’s also an American history expert, likely myself, on the middle-late years of the 20th Century --S-c-h-u-l-m-a-n.
I’ve discussed it with David Kennedy at Stanford University, who is also what we would call an "Americanist."
Q Anyone else?
A Yeah. I remember having dinner one night up at Stanford and discussing it, also, with Dr. Gordon Chang, C-h-a-n-g, who is an Americanist; and Professor Jack Rakove, R-a-k-o-v-e, who is also an Americanist.
Q Anyone else?
A Gosh, over 10 or 12 years, I -- I discussed it at one point with Howard Kushner, K-u-s-h-n-e-r. And he was actually for a time working as an expert witness. And then he stopped working as an expert witness. So he’s not been doing that for quite a number of years. But we spoke about it.
A Oh, yeah. I think I probably have talked about it with -- you know, when you have good friends who are in the history business, you just talk with them about what you’re doing. So I think I probably talked about it with an Americanist at the University of Virginia, whose name is Brian Balogh, B-a-l-o-g-h.
Q Anyone else?
A Not that I recall.
Q Now, the chair of your department, did you ever discuss the findings or conclusions or the sources you were using, with him?
A No.
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q I think I heard a "no." Is that correct?
A Yes. I said, "No."
Q Okay.
That was simply a disclosure of the fact you had been hired as a witness; is that correct?
MR. FOWLER: Objection to form.
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think it was probably a little more casual than that. But, yes, I was asking him about it and telling him about it, to begin with, because I wanted him to know what I was working on.
And then secondly, we just discussed it as one does in a casual way: What one’s working on; what one’s current research is.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And then you mentioned that you discussed it with Bruce Schulman.
Did you ever do any form of informal peer-review with Mr. Schulman? Ask him about the sources you were citing? Asked him if you missed anything? Asked him if your conclusions appeared correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I didn’t think that was
necessary.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So would this just be a -- in the form of a casual conversation like: Hey, I’m working as an expert and this is what I’m doing?
A Yes.
And I -- I might have asked him if he had time to do that kind of work, too, but I think that might have come up. But he’s very busy, and he was unable to.
Q Okay.
would also be interested in doing the same type of work you were doing for the tobacco companies?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think I may have.
Again, this conversation was quite a while ago, so I’m not entirely certain.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, when was this conversation?
A Oh, seven, eight years ago, maybe.
Q But we’re talking 2002 to 2003 timeframe?
A Yeah. Or 2002-2005, maybe.
Q But I take it that you, in essence, didn’t get any -- any form of peer-review from Bruce Schulman; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I did not solicit that, or get or receive it.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, you said you talked to David Kennedy.
Did Dr. Kennedy -- what was the substance of your conversations with him?
A We just spoke about the work I was doing, as we would speak about other kinds of historical research I’m engaged in.
Q Did you ask him for any form of informal
peer-review, discuss your conclusions, the materials you were relying on, and see if he had any suggestions or thoughts?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I didn’t think that would be relevant.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Did you ask Dr. Kennedy about maybe working with the tobacco companies and doing the same sort of research you were doing?
A No.
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I did not.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, you mentioned that you’d discussed it with Dr. Gordon Chang.
Did you ask Mr. Chang if he would be interested or suggest maybe him working in the same way that you were working?
A No. I did not.
Q And when you talked with Mr. Chang, did you ask Mr. Chang for any form of informal peer-review, run your conclusions, the materials you were relying on, the approaches you were using, by him?
THE WITNESS: No. I didn’t think that was
necessary.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And in the discussion you had with Mr. Chang, was it just what I might refer to as a social discussion?
A Well, yes, in the same way he would tell me about what he was working on at the time. And we had a mutual conversation about, you know, research that we were doing. So neither of us asked the other for a review of what our work was.
Q Now, when you talked to Professor Rakove, did you talk with him about maybe working or doing the same sort of research you were doing?
A No, I did not.
Q And when you talked to Mr. Rakove, did you ask him for any kind of informal peer-review, looking at the approach you were using, looking at the approach or the materials you were using?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I was no longer his student so I didn’t do that.
BY MR. NEALEY:
discussion like gee, I’m working for the tobacco companies?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, yes, it was a casual conversation. They were interested in the topic, and so we discussed it.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, you also mentioned that you talked with Howard Kushner. He had in the past worked as an expert witness for the tobacco companies; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I believe he was working with Johnson, Tyler and Purvis at that time, on a consulting basis. So that was right around the time he was doing that.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q What time was this?
A Well, it was right around the same time I started doing it. So I think 1999 to probably 2002 or ’3.
I’m not sure if he did that kind of work that long. He had moved away to another university, so we lost contact.
Q Okay.
So we could add Howard Kushner to the list that we discussed earlier of people who have been employed and worked for the tobacco companies via the lawyers; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You could add him to the list of people who had done some expert witness research.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
And when you talked to Mr. Kushner, were you given his name by Alan Purvis?
A Yes, I was.
Q Okay.
And so when Alan Purvis gave you the name of Mr. Kushner and you contacted him, what was -what did you discuss?
A That was a point when I was still considering whether or not I wanted to undertake the research. And so, as I did with Joan Hoff Wilson, I asked this other historian whether he felt completely free in his research to pursue the findings to their logical and verifiable conclusion. And he said, yes, he did. He felt quite good about the research he was doing. So that was our primary conversation about
it.
Q Did you get any sources from him or materials from him?
A No. I did not.
I -- he gave me the name of a research assistant who had done some work for him, so that was helpful, because she was someone who was already familiar with some of the sources.
Q She had already culled materials for him and you hired the same researcher to pull materials for you?
A Yes. Some of the same materials.
Q Some of the same materials.
Did you actually just get the collections that the researcher had already pulled?
A It was a combination. She gave me some things she had already located for him that were relevant. And then I asked her to locate other kinds of things for me that I thought were pertinent.
Q Well, this researcher had already gone out for Mr. Kushner and, for instance, culled materials.
Did you get, like, a box of materials from this researcher or two boxes or half a box?
I mean, what was the volume of this stuff?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form. Move to
strike the preamble.
THE WITNESS: You know, it would be hard for me to categorize how much stuff it was.
Certainly enough for a few binders -- perhaps four-inch binders -- something like that.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And these were copies of articles and particular citations to books and things like that?
A No. They were not.
Q What kind of materials were they?
A They were primary documents, which is a different beast, if you will.
Q Well, what kind of primary documents?
A The San Diego Public Health Department had done a fair amount of work on anti-smoking in the 1960s. And so she shared with me some of the materials she found at the public health department, and I also directed her to look a few more places to find more information on San Diego.
So that was the kind of information, primarily, I got from her or that she got for me.
Q Okay.
And some of that material just came as a -- several binders, four-inch binders, of material she’s already collected and you had to get more
stuff; is that correct?
A Yes.
Or sometimes it didn’t come bound, and I’d say, "Hey, put this in a binder for me” because it’s -- otherwise, it’s hard to deal with.
Q Is there anybody else other than this -that we’ve discussed who’s given you already culled materials?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Other than we’ve already
discussed?
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Yup.
A No.
Well, I think I would have gotten some materials from a public history agency named "History Works" that has gotten me some materials that they had already previously collected. That’s the primary one I can think of.
Q Well, did you talk to and get some materials from the archivist at Johnson, Taylor [sic] and Purvis?
A No. I did not.
Q Did you get some materials from Shane and their archivist?
MR. FOWLER: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I did not.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And History Works, that’s a company in Chicago; right?
A Yes, it is.
Q And they sent you some materials that they previously collected?
A Well, how it would work is, if I needed some materials, I would call them and say, for example, "Have you ever looked at or collected materials from, say, the Chicago Tribune for, you know, this two decades or something?"
And they would sometimes tell me, "Yes"; and sometimes they’d say, "No." And then I’d take it from there.
Q And History Works -- you’d call History Works and say, "Hey, do you have some materials on tobacco from the Chicago Tribune?"; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yeah. It would be in pursuit of the particular research we’re discussing today, which all concerns smoking and health.
///
Q And History Works had already collected some of these tobacco sources into a particular place and you’d call them up and see if they looked at the particular source you were looking at; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: They’re a public history company. So some stuff they’ve already done. And some stuff they would not have already done. So if they have -- already have it, of course, that’s helpful. And even when they do, I often go back and corroborate it myself and look for additional information.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, who gave you the name of History Works?
A I first learned about them from Paul Koethe at Jones Day.
Q So Paul Koethe said you can call up History Works and ask them for materials; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: He told me about them. He told me that they’re a public history organization that works with a wide variety of clients and, you
know, has a very strong reputation in the Midwest.
And so I contacted them subsequently and spoke with the founder and primary historian, who works for that organization -- founded it and owns the organization. So after I had assured myself of her sterling qualities, which she has many, then I began to use them on an occasional basis.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And they’d go look at a source and pull materials from that source or give you materials from that source related to tobacco?
A Yes.
It was always in the context of this particular research. Sometimes it’s not tobacco, per se, in the sense that I might ask them to find out more for me about a small community in the Midwest that’s pretty hard to do research on it -- they’re removed from California. So sometimes it will be more contextual research.
Q Now, who was the person at History Works you talked to?
A The owner of History Works is a woman named Terry Fife: T-e-r-r-y, F-i-f-e.
Q And when you call up History Works and ask them to do something or find something or research
it, they’d send you a bill?
A No.
Q No?
A "No."
Q Well, who was paying for all this?
A They would bill directly, as I understand it -- they would bill Jones Day directly, as they do some other clients.
Q Ah. Okay.
So they -- when Jones Day told you to call History Works, Jones Day already had up a whole billing arrangement with them, and whatever they did, they just billed Jones Day directly; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, a research assistant I might use could bill Jones Day directly if they were doing work for me that was related to these cases, because I -- I’m not an employer and I don’t have a tax -- you know, set up or anything like that. And History Works, as I understood it, had been already working for them previously.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So it was very clear, when Jones Day told you to call History Works -- it was clear that Jones Day had already worked with them before, and the
billing was all handled, and you could just call them up and ask them to find stuff and they’d forward it to you; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: What was clear to me was that they were a very reputable, private company, independent, and that they had a variety of clients, including Jones Day. And the nice thing about that was that I did not have to handle a separate billing. And I could vet them on my own, too. I became very confident in the ability of Terry Fife and her staff, and remain so.
So it’s very helpful to have somebody in the Midwest who can run some of the these errands that I can’t always run for myself. Although, I have done research of my own in the Midwest as well.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, what percentage of the materials you’ve collected have come from History Works?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I really couldn’t give you an estimate. Not a huge percentage, but, you know -I couldn’t give a number -- pardon?
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q 5, 10 percent?
A I just really can’t hazard a guess. It wouldn’t be fair or accurate.
It’s not a -- it would not be a terribly high percentage, in any case.
Q Now, you got some materials from Brian Barlow [sic].
I mean, you also discussed your work with Brian Barlow [sic]; is that correct?
A I discussed it with Brian Balogh.
Q That’s spelled B-o-w-l-o-w?
A No. It’s B-a-l-o-g-h.
Q Okay.
And Dr. Balogh -- did you solicit any type of peer-review or informal peer-review -- discuss the work you were doing, the materials you were relying on, the conclusions you were reaching, with Mr. Balogh?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: With Dr. Balogh, I’ve discussed many different projects, and I don’t believe I’ve ever asked him for any kind of what you’re calling an informal peer-review. I was simply sharing with him my current research. And he did the same with me.
///
Q And was this a -- again, sort of a social conversation?
A Yeah. I think that’s a fair characterization.
Q And did you also ask or discuss in any way with Dr. Balogh maybe him doing work with the tobacco companies or for the tobacco companies?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I did not.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Other than the discussion that you had with Bruce Schulman, is there any other person who you have discussed or suggested might also work as an expert for lawyers working with the tobacco companies?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: There was one other person at one time that I thought about recommending.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Who was that?
A I knew you were going to ask that.
I can’t remember his last name now. His first name is Bill. And he had red hair till he lost it. But he was -- he is a historian in California.
At some point, I asked him about it, but I’m sorry. That’s all I can recall at the moment.
Q Did you actually talk to Bill about it or did you just think about talking to Bill about it?
A No. I think we had a brief phone conversation. It was quite a number of years ago.
Q And he wasn’t interested in it?
A No. He had young children. He was too
busy.
Q Maybe I’ll -- I’m about ready to go through what you’ve brought as your file. I’m happy to do that, or we can take a short break for lunch. It’s up to you.
MR. WALKER: What’s your preference?
THE WITNESS: Well, maybe it’s lunchtime. 12:30. Is that -- seems like a reasonable time to break.
MR. WALKER: Yeah.
MR. NEALEY: That’s fine.
THE REPORTER: Off the record.
(Luncheon recess taken at 12:31 P.M.)

MR. NEALEY: Back on the record.
EXAMINATION (Resumed)
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Dr. Hoffman, before we broke, we were talking about some names. And I’d like to give you a couple more and see if you have interacted with them regarding your work on these smoking and health issues for the tobacco companies.
Have you ever talked with or consulted with Lacy Ford?
A Yes.
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. I spoke to him, I believe, once.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
And you did that while doing your work for the tobacco companies?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I consulted him when I was doing research independently on the question of
smoking and health.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And who gave you the name of Lacy Ford?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t recall.
I’ve heard his name over the years. I don’t know any specific person gave me his name. I think I just looked him up and called him, but I’m not sure. I might have gotten a phone number from an attorney.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And you knew when you called Lacy Ford that Lacy Ford was also working as an expert for the lawyers working on behalf of the tobacco companies; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. I was aware he had done research -- like myself -- on smoking and health for the defendants.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
And you also knew that he was a paid expert when you talked to him; right?
A Well, I assume he had been compensated for his time.
Q Did Alan Purvis give you his name?
A I don’t think so. I think I had heard Alan Purvis probably mention him at times, but I don’t think I got any name from Alan.
Q And why, in specific, did you call Lacy
Ford?
A I called him at the time when I was first starting to do research in Florida, because I understood, as a southerner, somebody on that coast, that he had already done some research. So, you know, I asked him about some of the newspapers he had done research in.
Q And did you get some ideas of sources or did he send you any materials?
A I had my research assistant get some materials from him.
Q Okay.
So your research assistant actually got some already-gathered materials from Lacy Ford; is that correct?
A Yes. He did that, as well as, you know, talked with Dr. Ford about some of the archives and then my research assistant and I both went to the archives and got materials there.
you were basically -- were suggested to you by Lacy Ford, who was also an expert for the tobacco companies?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I don’t think that would be fair to say.
So many places are very obvious that a trained historian would automatically know to go to a place like the state archives. So it would be assumed, when two historians spoke to each other, that they would know the basic waterfront, as it will [sic].
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, the volume of materials that your research assistant got from Lacy Ford -- I mean, how thick were they? How much stuff did you get?
A I don’t know. Again, probably a few binders, but I’m not sure. Maybe half a box. Something like that. You know --
Q And what timeframe did you have this discussion with Lacy Ford and your research assistant contacted him?
A I think probably around the year 2006 or
Q Okay.
Now, when you did your secondary-source review and you did your literature review, did you find any articles by Lacy Ford in the area of public attitudes and public understandings regarding the risks of smoking?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t recall any articles by Dr. Ford on that subject.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And so that I ask it the same way I asked before, did you find any articles in journals, book chapters, presentations -- anything that’s ever been written by Lacy Ford on the history of public attitudes toward smoking and related illnesses?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I don’t believe so.
I haven’t read that much by Dr. Ford, to
be honest.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Do you even know what kind of historian he
is?
A Well, yeah. You know, the history field is a pretty large one, Mr. Nealey, and so there are lots of historians in it that you might know about but you wouldn’t necessarily have read their work.
Q Well, what kind of historian is he?
A He’s primarily a historian of the South, is what I recall.
Q Now, did you ever ask Dr. Ford to look at your report or your testimony or in any way to sort of informally peer-review what you were doing and the conclusions you were reaching as -- for cases in the South?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No, I didn’t.
Again, as I said before, that wouldn’t be customarily. That’s not something I would normally do, so I didn’t in this case, either.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, if I give you the name Jim Martin, did you ever talk to him?
A Yes. You and I spoke about him before lunch.
Q Okay.
I don’t have him listed -- oh, this is James Kirby Martin is also Jim Martin?
A Yes. That’s right. Jim is his nickname.
Q Great. I didn’t recognize him with the different first name.
Q Another person -- and I want to see if you ever talked in your work with the tobacco companies -- if you ever talked to Jeff Norrell?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’ve spoken to Jeff Norrell before, yes.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And when you talked to Jeff Norrell, you did so regarding your work for the tobacco companies; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I spoke with him about my research on smoking and health.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
And when you talked to Mr. Norrell, you also knew that he was also employed by lawyers to offer expert testimony for the tobacco companies; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t think that probably employed is the exact, correct word, but I know he was consulting with them. I think it’s a little bit different from being employed.
But in any case, yes, I knew he was doing
that kind of research when I spoke with him.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q He was doing research for attorneys on behalf of attorneys to -- who were being paid by the tobacco companies; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Historians generally would think of their work as being on behalf of the historical record. So that, for example, if I write a book for Harvard University, I don’t think of myself as working for Harvard or writing for them. They will use my research. They will make use of what I write. And in this case, the defense attorneys will make use of it, but I really honestly think of myself as working on behalf of history.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, Mr. Norrell, when you called him, you knew he was employed by lawyers to render opinions on behalf of tobacco companies; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’m aware that he was a witness on the matters of smoking and health for those attorneys working for -- I think PhilipMorris as well as Reynolds.
///
Q Okay.
Now, Jeff Norrell, when did you talk with
him?
A Oh, you know, I’ve spoken with him a couple of times over the years. Maybe the earliest I spoke with him was maybe 2006 or ’7. Somewhere in there.
Q And have you gotten materials from Jeff Norrell or suggestions of places you could go find materials?
A I’ve gotten a few things from him over the years -- a couple of Southern newspapers where he had done some research and collected newspaper articles.
Q So he would send you -- you got a box of stuff from him or half a box?
I mean -A No. Very little, actually. A small stack, probably, is going to be my best bet. Maybe less than a ream of paper.
Q And these materials are copies of things that he’s pulled out of particular areas that discuss tobacco; correct?
A Well, these are newspaper articles that would have informed the general public about the
harms of smoking -- like Victoria Waggoner, when she was living in the South, if you consider Missouri the South.
Q Well, I grew up in Oklahoma, so I won’t testify who might consider themselves part of the South -A Okay.
Q -- including Missouri and Oklahoma.
Now, Mr. Norrell, when you talked to him, and when you did your review of secondary sources, when you went and did your literature review -- did you find anything that was ever published or presented by Mr. Norrell in the area of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Although he’s expert in that field, I’ve not come across anything by him about it. BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So like you, Mr. Norrell has never published in the area of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
true, in the sense that I -- yes, I have published in my textbook. I’m the editor of a volume in which there is information on smoking and how the public viewed it.
I hope I made that clear before. I’m sorry if I didn’t.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q The only thing you’ve ever published is the information that you’ve put in your textbook; is that correct?
A Yes, that’s correct.
Q And I might as well just address this now. Your textbook that you are referring to that had some information that you have written on the issue of the history of public attitudes, smoking and related illnesses, is that your publication: Major Problems in American History, 1865 to the Present?
A Yes, that’s correct.
Q And did you include this information on the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses -- did you include it in the 2002 edition?
A Yes, I believe so.
Q And did you include it in the 2006 edition?
A Yes, I believe it’s been in all three editions.
Q Okay.
A Different things -- it changes a bit, of course, each time, but it’s -- yeah, there’s been something on it, because temperance and prohibition were really big topics in the 1920s and 19 teens [sic].
Q And third edition? I don’t see that on your resume so when did that come out?
A The third edition came out this year, actually. So it came out 2011.
Q Did you include those sections of your book in your reliance materials?
A No.
Q But obviously, you have copies of those books; right?
A Yes, I do.
Again, my reliance materials are meant to be representative, not exhaustive.
Q Now, those -- in connection with the book in your third, second, and first edition that you drafted on -- that would involve tobacco, did you ever have anyone peer-review those?
of how not all historical work is peer-reviewed. In this particular case, it’s not peer-reviewed. It just doesn’t figure in the same way that you’ve been using that term.
Q Did you include a notation in your book that what you were discussing and the research you were doing was funded by the tobacco companies?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I did not. Just as I made no reference to other forms of research I had done, you know, at other times. It wasn’t relevant. BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So your view is that when somebody testifying is an expert witness and somebody has been paid over $550,000 to do the research by one party, that historians shouldn’t disclose that to people reading what they write?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: It would be important and relevant to do so in certain cases, but in other cases, it’s simply not relevant. In this case, based on the kind of book it was, it wasn’t relevant.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Dr. Hoffman, when you teach your students, do you tell them that if a party with a particular --
to use a colloquial term -- ax to grind -- is funding a particular study that they need to let people know, when they publish that?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: In history, we always talk about bias and the importance of avoiding it or making it clear when it is unavoidable or something like that. But, again, it would depend on the context in which the work was being done.
In the particular context we’re talking about, it has no relevance whatsoever.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So if you had a student who was working with you and that student came to you and said, "I’ve been paid $550,000 to do this historical study by a defendant in litigation, and I’ve testified on these subjects, and I was entirely funded by a party in reaching these conclusions and I’m going to submit this stuff for review by other historians. Should I disclose the fact that I’ve been paid $550,000?" -what would you tell them?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, this is a very long statement, but I think you began by saying if a student was writing a study on something and they
were -- this was going to be a book about something and they had been -- gotten money from one party to the controversy that they were discussing, they should reveal it. I would agree with that. I think in general, that’s an important principle.
In this case, it doesn’t apply, however -in the case we’re talking about, because this was a textbook. It was -- had many, many topics. This was a very small part of it. So it would have been irrelevant, I believe, in my professional judgment.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And anyone reading that section that you wrote in the first, second and third edition would have no idea that you had been paid $550,000 by tobacco companies to research the subject that you were now putting in that book; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, there’s many things about me that they wouldn’t know and times in which my life has touched on some of those historical topics, but it wasn’t relevant to reveal that.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Is there any other parts of your book that you’re writing in your book that you’ve been paid $550,000 to research?
THE WITNESS: All of it in a sense.
As I said, I’ve made a million dollars in wages as a historian. And quite a bit in royalties as well. So throughout my career, I’ve been compensated for researching historical topics. And I don’t go around saying: Here’s where I got my -here’s where I got money, unless it’s in some way related.
For many years, I believe it’s in my CV, I worked for a feminist organization. When I write about the history of feminism, I don’t say, "And I was compensated for ten years working for this movement." It wouldn’t be relevant. It might be relevant in some circumstances, but not in others.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, Dr. Hoffman, let’s assume that somebody read one of your publications on feminism; correct? They could look up on the Internet and find your CV; right?
A They wouldn’t find the CV that pertains to that. So, no. The answer is "no."
Q Well, wait a second. I can get your CV off the Internet; right?
Internet.
Q Dr. Hoffman, if I wanted to know that -if I was reading one of your early articles about the feminist movement, I can look at your curriculum vitae and see that you have worked extensively with feminist organizations; right?
A No, not necessarily.
Q I can find out from looking that you were the president of the Center For Women’s Studies and Services and a board member for the Center For Women’s Studies and Services, between 1985 and 1994; right?
A Yes, because in the CV that I gave you, it goes back into the years before I was an academic. Normally, that’s not something I would put on my academic resume. I often don’t.
Q And I also can find that you were a keynote speaker at various girls’ clubs, et cetera, and that you’ve written publications regarding youth and feminism -- in fact, that you made media appearances on that; right?
A Yes. It’s true. I believe that’s on that CV I gave you.
Q Okay.
article, I can look and see that you have a background doing what I might say is activism on the part of women and youth.
Is that a fair statement?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, yes. You would, but the general public would not be able to. But you certainly could. Especially if I connected those dots for you.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Where on your CV, Dr. Hoffman, do I find out that you’ve been an expert witness for tobacco companies since 1999?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: That is not on my CV, as is some other activities I do that are not on my CV.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, but this is an activity that you earned between 25 and 30 percent of your income at over the last 12 years. And it’s not on your CV.
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Do you have a question, sir? BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, is there a reason why it’s not on your CV?
A Yes. I -- it’s not -- a CV like a resume is usually written for a particular need. And so, you know, depending on the need, I will tell people what my experience is in relation to something. In this case, I just don’t think there’s any need for it. It’s not relevant. It’s one of the things I do. And I have to say, I wear quite a few hats, just because I like to do a lot of different kinds of things.
Q And if I look at your profile at San Diego State University, when I’m looking at your textbook,
I also don’t see that you’ve worked since 1999 as an expert witness for the tobacco companies; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t believe that’s on my -- on the university website, no.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And, in fact, your university website -first of all, you drafted this; right?
A Yes. They usually ask us for a short paragraph. And I think I did -- it’s probably, you know, eight or nine -- seven, eight years ago. I don’t remember it very vividly, but I think it’s my draft.
that you have done. And you describe the fact that your research interest includes U.S., European, third-world and Latin-America history. And that you’re currently writing a new history of American foreign relations from 1976 -- 1776 to the present; right?
A Yes. I believe it should say something in there about the history of the 1960s and the history of reform as well, under which this topic fits. But those are certainly some of my interests.
Q And you don’t say on here for somebody looking -- reading your book, that you’ve been a consultant and expert witness for the tobacco companies from 1999 to the present; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Right. There are really, truly any number of things that would not be in that paragraph. And that’s one of them.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, I think I asked about Jeff Norrell, and if I did, I apologize. But when you got some materials from Jeff Norrell, did you ever ask him for any kind of informal peer-review of what you were doing; send in your reports, your deposition testimony, or your trial testimony, and ask him if
there was something you were missing or something you should be looking at?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I didn’t think that was
necessary.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And when you talked to Mr. Norrell -scratch that. When you -- I may have again asked this before, and I apologize if I have.
When you talked to Mr. Norrell and learned about his work, did you ever, in your literature review and your review of secondary sources -- did you ever see anything that Mr. Norrell had ever published in the area of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I did not.
As I mentioned, of course, my focus is on primary materials, but I never did see anything in particular by Jeff Norrell on this topic.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
And let me give you another name here:
Luis Martinez. Did you ever talk to him?
Q And you know that Luis Martinez is also an expert for the tobacco companies; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I know that Dr. Martinez works in Florida and does research on smoking and health in Florida. And, also, Cuba, I believe.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And you also know that Luis Martinez was hired by the tobacco companies, through their lawyers, as an expert witness; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I know that he consults with -- I believe it’s Jones Day.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, who put you in touch with Luis Martinez?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think I learned from Paul Koethe that Dr. Martinez has been doing this kind of research.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And Paul Koethe is from Jones Day; right?
A Yes, he is.
Q So you learned of Mr. Martinez’s work in this area and that he was working for -- indirectly
for the tobacco companies -- from a lawyer at Jones Day; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I learned about his research, I believe, through Jones Day.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And you contacted Mr. Martinez?
A Well, he and I were attending the same conference in San Diego a couple of years ago, so I suggested we get together — just meet each other. So we did that.
Q And so you met Mr. Martinez when you were at a conference -- that would be the AHA conference in San Diego; correct?
A Yes, that’s correct. American Historical Association.
Q Yeah.
And I could look up the time -- but I saw that on your resume -- you were one of the coordinators for that; is that correct?
A Yes, that’s correct.
Q So you would have met in person with Mr. Martinez when that conference happened, which would have been -A January 2010.
Q January of 2010. Okay.
Now, had you heard that Mr. Martinez was working in this area well before that or just at the same time?
A No. Maybe sometime in the preceding year, I would suspect.
Q And did you, in your review of secondary materials and your literature review, did you ever see anything that Mr. Luis Martinez has ever published on the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. Not that I recall.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And did you swap any information, or get anything from Mr. Martinez or learn of any sources from him?
A No.
Q Did you give Mr. Martinez anything or suggest he look any place?
A No.
Q Did you discuss your findings or conclusions with Mr. Martinez to see if he had any suggestions of things you should look for or things that you might have missed?
A I discussed my findings with him, but not for the purpose you described.
Q So you didn’t seek any sort of informal peer-review from him?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. That — that didn’t make any sense.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Did you show him any of your reports or any of your testimony?
A No, I did not.
Q Did you ask to see his reports, or testimony or reliance list?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I didn’t ask him for
anything.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
Have you had any interactions with him regarding the work you’ve done, other than that dinner that you had in San Diego, in 2010?
A No. We just met for coffee in San Diego briefly. That was the only time.
Q Now, are you familiar with the name Roger Sharpe?
A Yes, I am.
Q And you also talked with Roger Sharpe who was an expert, also, like you, for the tobacco companies; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I don’t recall speaking with Dr. Sharpe.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q You know that Roger Sharpe is also an expert for the tobacco companies in these cases; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, you’re kind of reminding me of it. I’m not 100 percent certain, but that sounds right.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And was he also a name that was mentioned to you by Jones Day?
A I’m not exactly sure where I heard his name. I might have.
Q And have you ever talked to Roger Sharpe?
A Not that I recall.
Q And have you ever e-mailed with him or met
him?
to be 100 percent certain, because I just don’t remember it. But I don’t recall ever speaking with him, actually.
Q Okay.
And because you -- I want to make sure that I’m not missing something.
We discussed a number of witnesses earlier at some length who were also experts for the tobacco companies.
And I would like to know if -- from any of those witnesses, if you got, directly or indirectly, information; meaning, did your research assistant get information from them? Did their research assistant give you stuff? Did your research assistant get stuff from their research assistant?
And maybe I’ll just run through the names and see if you can tell me if you got anything directly or indirectly from them or if you gave them something directly or indirectly.
Do you understand what I’m asking?
A Yes.
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I do.
MR. WALKER: Move to strike the characterization of the witnesses.
Q Do you understand what I’m asking,
Dr. Hoffman?
A Yes, I believe so.
Q Okay.
So with Joan Hoff Wilson, did you directly or indirectly get any material from her, or did you directly or indirectly give her any material regarding the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
And regarding Tom DiBacco, did you directly or indirectly get material from him or information from him or did you directly or indirectly give him materials or information on the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t recall, but I think not. It’s been quite a long time, but I don’t recall getting anything from him or giving anything to him.
///
Q Okay.
And I believe we discussed Richard Means, and you said you did get some materials from Richard Means; correct?
A Yes, that’s correct.
Q Okay.
Did you get any materials from Richard Means indirectly -- his research assistant gave them to you or he gave them to your research assistant?
A He gave some materials to Terry Fife, from whom I got some of his materials.
Q Ah. So you got some materials directly from Richard Means and then you got some through Terry Fife.
Is that a fair statement?
A Yes.
As I mentioned to you, he’s dead now. So it would be hard to get anything from him at this point.
Q And Greg Black, did you get any materials directly or indirectly from Greg Black, or did you give any materials to Greg Black directly or indirectly?
A Well, as we discussed before lunch, I did
get some materials from Greg Black directly.
Although, it may be that it was his research assistant who put things in an envelope. You know, I don’t recall that. It seems like there was somebody like that. But it’s been quite a long time.
But, yes, I received some materials from Dr. Black, but I didn’t send him anything.
Q Did you get any materials that you believe came from him through History Works or some other source?
A No.
Q Now, John Snetsinger, did you get any materials directly or indirectly from Mr. Snetsinger or his research assistant, or did you give him anything directly or indirectly?
A I believe I got a couple of articles from him or maybe just suggestions of articles that were available on the Internet. I can’t remember. It’s been quite a while now. But I got a few things from him, either in that way or more directly. But I did not send him anything.
Q Now, Chester Patch, I think we probably know the answer, but did you get anything directly or indirectly from Chester Patch or did you give him anything directly or indirectly?
A No, I did not.
Q Now, Michael Parrish, did you get something, directly or indirectly, from him related to the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses? Or did you give him anything, directly or indirectly, on that subject?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I did not give -- or receive -- anything from him.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, James Kirby Martin, you did get some materials from him; correct?
A Yes, I did.
Q Okay.
And did you get anything indirectly that came from James Kirby Martin or from his research assistants or people working with him?
A No.
Q Now, William Stueck, did you get anything directly or indirectly from Mr. Stueck regarding the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses, or did you directly or indirectly give him anything or any possible sources?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
Q Greg Michelle -- did you get anything from him either directly or indirectly through a research assistant or otherwise on the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses, or did you give him anything either directly or indirectly on those subjects?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No, I did not.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And Lacy Ford, I think we discussed him.
If I’m remembering right, you said you did get some materials from Lacy Ford; is that correct?
A Yes, that’s correct.
Q Okay.
Did you get any additional materials from Lacy Ford indirectly; meaning that they would have been work done by his research assistants or work that would have come via your research assistant from either him or his research assistant?
A Well, as I remember, I mentioned that my research assistant obtained some things from Dr. Ford.
I was going to ask you a couple questions about your file. And if you’d look at what we’ve marked as Exhibit 1, it asks for you to bring particular materials with you.
And if I can have the reporter make up about maybe 15 stickers and just put for all of these -- just Hoffman and then today’s date on them so we can distinguish the date of the deposition if there’s some later issue.
And then I’m just going to ask if you could get your file and walk me through what you have brought with you.
THE REPORTER: Off the record.
(Off the record: 2:07 P.M.-2:08 P.M.)
MR. NEALEY: Back on the record. Okay.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So, Dr. Hoffman, you were asked to bring your file on the case. What materials have you brought with you?
And I’m asking for the notice purposes here, both general materials you brought with you and also specific materials on the Waggoner case. I’ll deal with the case-specific stuff that you might have brought on Pickett and Gollihue later.
But what did you bring with you?
A Well, I went over the list of things you asked for, and I brought a variety of things.
How would you like me to proceed? Want to just go -- want me to talk about the materials?
MR. WALKER: He just wants you -MR. NEALEY: Just tell me what you have.
THE WITNESS: One of the things you asked for was a current curriculum vitae. And so I brought one of those.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
Is that curriculum vitae the same other than the addition of the new edition of your book of the one that was attached to your expert report?
A Gosh. I just don’t know. I’d have to sit and go through it. There might be a couple other things that changed. I add new books or stuff like that.
MR. NEALEY: Okay.
Well, maybe what we’ll do is, we’ll just mark the new CV as exhibit -- this is Exhibit 5?
THE REPORTER: Yes.
MR. NEALEY: Okay. So just stick an Exhibit 5 sticker on there, and we can continue.
(Exhibit 5 marked)
Q What else did you bring?
A I also brought bills, which are related -invoices that I made up, related to the three cases we’re talking about today. And so I have a collection of invoices, which shows the hours and on which days I worked on these respective cases.
MR. WALKER: If I could just jump in here, Scott. I know you’re aware of our position about what’s being produced in terms of billing and invoice information sheet -- Dr. Hoffman brought her bills as they relate to the three cases in which she’s being deposed today. And to the extent that it contains information that relates to other cases, that information has been redacted. So I wanted to mention that on the record, partly because you can’t see what she’s brought, but that’s what we’ve done.
MR. NEALEY: Okay.
And let’s mark those bills as Exhibit 6.
(Exhibit 6 marked)
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q How much, Dr. Hoffman, do those bills approximately total?
redacted, it impedes my multiplication a little bit, because some of them included other cases. So it’s hard to -- hard to say.
I’m looking to see if I have maybe a bill that doesn’t have any other cases on it. I guess they all have some other cases, so it takes away the grand total. So the grand total would include these cases and some other cases. I may guess approximately, maybe -- maybe $40,000.
Q Okay.
MR. WALKER: And just so the record is clear, Scott, the bills reflect the hours that she spent on the three cases and the rate that she was charging for the hours she spent on the three cases.
So I just want it to be clear: The number can be calculated from the paperwork that she has.
She was just explaining that you can’t just look at the document and see the total laid out. Just wanted to make sure -MR. NEALEY: You guys wiped the totals off the bills as well; right?
MR. WALKER: The bills never included a total for the Waggoner case, or a total for Pickett or a total for Gollihue. So the information you just asked about was never contained in the bills. You
would have to look at the hours that were spent on those cases, multiply that times her rate, and then you could find out what the total would be for those cases.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And, Dr. Hoffman, it’s fair to say, I believe, that what you’re relying upon, however, is not just that $40,000 for the work; you’re relying upon the materials that you have gathered in your work in this area since 1999; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I’m relying upon my whole history and training as a historian, which, of course, goes back even farther than that.
But, you know, certainly that experience is reflected in the reliance list. These bills start on June 30th, for example, in 2011. And so, yes, there was quite a bit I knew about the subject before then.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And it would probably be fair to say that the materials that are reflected for this case, meaning Waggoner -- the 248-page resource list -that probably 90 percent of them were gathered not specific to these three cases.
Is that a fair statement?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’m not sure if the percentage is right, but certainly a very high percentage would be materials where I simply learned about this topic over a period of years. And so, yes, I would include all of those -- not all -- but, again, I would include a representative sample. If I tried to include all, it would be very cumbersome and impossible, really, for both of us.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, did the attorneys tell you to only bring the bills for these three cases?
A Well, I read your Notice of Deposition, and that was my impression.
Let’s see. Which number was that?
So, you know, it was a conversation we had. Of course, I’m trying to decipher what lawyers mean when they phrase things and sometimes another attorney will say: No, this sentence means this instead of that. So we had a conversation about it.
In any case, at the end of the day, my understanding was I needed to bring information related to the cases that we’re discussing today.
You have done a study over the last 12 years of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Over the last 12 years, I’ve been studying public awareness of the issues of smoking and health.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
And your study of the issues that you’re testifying to in this case, that study of those issues didn’t just start with the -- with your retention in the Pickett, Gollihue and Walker [sic] cases; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: As we discussed, I started focusing on this research in 1999. So that was well before I knew about these individuals.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And your study of these issues that you’re relying upon in this case started in 1999; right?
A Yes. Some of the information I would have learned early, and some of it much later.
But you had an understanding, talking to
lawyers, you were only supposed to bring the bills related to these three cases; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: That was my impression that, yes, I needed to produce the information that was related to these three cases.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Did you go and scratch out everything unrelated to the three cases from the bills?
A Yes, I did. Including my Social Security number.
Q Did the lawyers tell you to scratch that
out?
A On the Social Security number, actually, I think it was Mr. Walker who first spotted that. I didn’t notice it right off, but I certainly would have wanted to have done it.
Q I’m not asking about your Social Security number. I’m asking for information -- work you did on -- other than these three cases that was redacted, did you take that off the bills?
A Yes, I did. I got a black marker yesterday and marked through them.
Q And did the lawyers tell you to do that?
A Well, we -- as I said, we had a
conversation about what was necessary to produce and how to be responsive to your list. So as we understood it -- and as I understood it -- based on my conversation with them, I just needed to produce the stuff on Gollihue, Waggoner and Pickett.
Q Okay.
And if the lawyers asked you to produce a complete set of those ten years’ worth of bills you have, you could push a button or pull the file and produce those in a couple minutes; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I could search for them, as I indicated before. I believe I have them. I don’t know if it will take two minutes, but, you know, it shouldn’t take a long time.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
Well, we’ll ask that you produce those and we obviously have a standing issue with the defendants on this. But so the record is clear, I’m asking that you produce them.
MR. WALKER: And just so the record is clear, we object to that production for the reasons that have been discussed already.
///
Q What else did you bring, Dr. Hoffman?
A I brought e-mails that -- where I sent messages to either one of the attorneys involved in this case or to History Works, the research agency that’s given me some assistance.
Q So these are invoices you sent to History Works?
A No, sir. They’re not invoices. They’re e-mails.
Q Ah. Okay.
So is that all the e-mails that you have related to these cases?
A Yes, it is.
Q And do you have other e-mails related to your study starting in 1999 that you didn’t bring with you?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I would have some -- very few -- but over the course of ten or 12 years, I have a few probably.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
So you only brought -- sorry.
A Sorry. I was just going to add that I’ve
also changed computers a few times. So I don’t -- it would be hard for me to know how many of those I could produce. There would not be very many, but I’m also not sure how I’d get at some of them. I think that was your question.
MR. NEALEY: Let’s mark those e-mails as
Exhibit 7.
(Exhibit 7 marked)
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q What else did you bring?
MR. WALKER: Scott, just before you move on, let me just make clear the e-mails that she brought were individually clipped together, and so we just put a binder clip on the full set.
There are a few pages where there was some password and login information that’s been redacted. And I think there may be a couple of places in there where there’s some identifying information of research assistants and such that has been redacted as well.
I don’t think there’s anything else on there that was redacted.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Dr. Hoffman, did you redact these documents?
A Yes, I did.
Q Okay.
And did you do so at the request of the
lawyers?
A No.
Q Okay.
What else do you got?
A I have some handwritten notes, or actually copies of handwritten notes, that I made on the depositions. So I brought those as well.
Q Okay.
Let me ask you a question: What else do
you have?
MR. WALKER: Let’s be clear. I think we started just in Waggoner. You probably have more than that there.
THE WITNESS: Yeah. I have handwritten notes on all three cases, the depositions for Gollihue, Waggoner and Pickett cases. Just to make that clear. They’re separately pinned together so you can see how Waggoner -- where it starts and stops and where Pickett takes up, et cetera. So that’s another thing. That’s, like, a different thing. That’s handwritten notes on the depositions, which I assume we want to make these an exhibit?
yet.
MR. NEALEY: We’ll do Waggoner as
Exhibit 8.
(Exhibit 8 marked)
MR. NEALEY: We’ll do Gollihue as
Exhibit 9.
(Exhibit 9 marked)
MR. NEALEY: And we’ll do Pickett as Exhibit 10.
(Exhibit 10 marked)
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So -- and what else did you bring with
you?
A The other thing I brought -- and I’m honestly not sure if you want it or not. I brought all of the depositions that I received that were taken in the case that I -- ones that I got -- you know, having to do with the family members typically of either the decedent or the plaintiff.
I brought them all. The only thing of mine they have on them is I always put my initials in the top right-hand corner just to remind myself if I’ve read something or not. Just kind of a way to be sure I didn’t miss something. And some of them --
not all of them, but a few of them -- have highlighted sections where I’ll get happy with my yellow highlighter or something. Typically, I’ll highlight the birthdate, for example, because some of these details are hard to find later on. So I don’t know if you want those or not.
I have only the originals. I didn’t make you copies ’cause if I made you copies on a regular machine, you know, the yellow would fade away, anyhow. So I don’t know what you want me to do there, but I’ve brought them in case you wish them.
Q Let me ask a question: To the extent you highlighted something, did you then transfer those -that information into your notes?
A Absolutely.
So the handwritten notes would -- they would have everything, I would think, that you want to know that I took note of when I highlight something it’s usually because I want to remember it later where I read it so I can write it down in my notes.
Q Okay.
Now, anything else you brought with you?
A No. I think that’s it.
MR. WALKER: Scott, just -- let me just
add one thing: There are a couple of other materials that I think are responsive to your request that she didn’t bring because you already have them. An example of that would be the reliance list. I think you may have had one already marked as an exhibit.
And then the only other thing would be certain records that were -- have already been produced to you in discovery like military records and educational records.
MR. NEALEY: Dr. Hoffman —
MR. WALKER: I think -BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Dr. Hoffman, do you have any notes that you have taken throughout your study -- so I’m talking 1999 forward.
Do you have any notes that you’ve taken on the materials that you have reviewed or the materials you’ve relied or materials that you have looked at, either primary or secondary?
A Yes, I do.
Q Okay.
Tell me what those look like and where
those are.
A They would vary widely. And I should make note, too, by the way -- one of the things you asked
for were notes about this, you know -- case notes, so to speak. And those were attached to an e-mail. So I kind of want to make it clear that one set of that stuff is wrapped into an e-mail that you are going to get to. So just to let you know that. You can look for that in the e-mail.
As to other notes I’ve written, prior to learning about Mr. Gollihue or Ms. Waggoner, et cetera, they would be in different forms. I have some, for example, handwritten notes -- we mentioned early this morning, we were talking about the UCLA film archive. So when I went to the film archive, I made notes on some of the shows I watched or where I found stuff.
I have notes on things like Reader’s Digest over the years -- small summaries of what an article was about so that I don’t have to reread the whole article to know.
I made up a chronology so I can try to remember exactly when the FAA outlawed certain things.
So, you know, the long list of dates.
It’s kind of a historian thing to do. I have made notes on other magazine collections from time to time, Prevention magazine strikes me as one I
remember doing a lot of notes on.
So sometimes, I just collect the bare documents and occasionally, I’ll make up a note about a document just to remind myself of what it was about.
So I have probably a truckload or more -not of case notes or notes about documents, but of documents themselves.
MR. WALKER: Hey, Scott, when you think about it, I’m hoping there’s a short break in our future here. You probably haven’t reached a stopping point yet, but when you get to one, we could use it.
MR. NEALEY: Great. I’ll see if I can close this off, and then we can -- I’m happy to take a break.
MR. WALKER: Okay.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Dr. Hoffman, recognizing that you’ve got a truckload of materials, as you just said, what’s the volume of notes that you have, the handwritten notes from UCLA, the chronology you did, et cetera? How thick is that stuff?
A I don’t know.
I mean, that would not be a truckload for sure. My notes would be smaller. The primary
materials are extraordinarily voluminous, but the thing is I would have to comb through a variety of files, though to find them. That’s -- you know, some of them would be electronic. Some would be, you know, handwritten scattered through many different files. I have quite a number of file drawers that I would have to go through.
Q Well, the electronic notes that you’ve taken, you can just print ’em off your computer?
A Yes. Some of those I can get at more easily.
Q And the -- do you have a master file where you keep notes so you -- you get some of your materials there?
A No, I don’t.
Q So is it -- for instance, these handwritten notes from UCLA, when you went and looked at -- tells you what TV programs you looked at, where are those notes kept?
A Well, those would be in one file, and those file drawers that I talked about -- I just happened to look at that one recently, so I’m kind of remembering it. But there would be others, like American Cancer Society. And then I might have a page of notes in there, for example.
Q Would it be fair to say that the notes would be combined with the primary materials you have from that source?
A Yes.
Q Okay.
But in the case of the handwritten notes from UCLA, you looked at more TV programs than you -than ultimately copied.
Is that a fair statement?
A Well, yes. And, of course, it’s a totally different process of duplication. Sometimes you can just get the primary video, for example. A source might be willing to make you up a copy of a video. Like right now, I’m getting something from Wisconsin that’s supposed to be in the mail. But other times, at UCLA, they have a procedure where you’re not actually allowed to make any copies, which is kind of a bummer. But there, you just have to make notes on what you saw.
Q Okay.
Did you -- when you were asked about materials, did you understand, somehow, that you were not supposed to bring these notes with you to the deposition?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I understood that I needed to bring the notes that related to these three cases. BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And did that understanding come from the defense counsel, when you talked to them?
A That understanding came from my prior experience in depositions.
Q How long is this chronology?
A Oh, my chronology -- I think maybe 18 pages. Something like that. 20 pages perhaps.
Q Okay.
Any other typed-up or electronic documents other than the chronology you think you have?
A Yes. I would have some notes on 19th Century literature, for example. I’m pretty sure I’ve got notes on that. I have notes on some of the different church groups. I always need, as a historian, to summarize some of the findings at least. Otherwise, again, they become too voluminous to recall easily.
Q And I take it that these notes are something that you used in preparing your opinions in this case?
A Some of them, I would; and some of them, I didn’t look at.
Q You didn’t go back -A They’re more like an aid to memory. So sometimes you go back because you don’t remember something precisely.
Q And so, for instance, if you wanted to include something in your report on the American Cancer Society, you’d go back to look at the page of notes and see what they’ve got there; right?
A Well, no. Probably I’d go back to the primary source in that case.
MR. NEALEY: Okay. Your counsel had asked for a break. We can take a short break.
Five minutes? Ten minutes?
MR. WALKER: That would be great.
MR. NEALEY: Okay.
(Off the record: 2:31 P.M.-2:37 P.M.)
MR. NEALEY: Back on the record.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Dr. Hoffman, we were talking about the various notes that you have. The electronic ones -are they -- you’ve got one computer that you’ve got a file with all that stuff on?
A Yeah. They should -- you know, sometimes I trade back-and-forth between computers. But, yeah, I should have a comprehensive file someplace on one
of those.
And then you just -- you can -- you could easily forward that to defense counsel, what -- your various electronic notes and your chronology; is that correct?
A Yes. I could definitely forward the chronology.
Q I think I’m going to ask that you -- at least I’ll look at the handwritten notes. I’ll think about it. But I’m going to ask that you produce the chronology that you’ve got and the other electronic notes that you’ve made.
MR. WALKER: And I think you know our position on materials that weren’t prepared for this case. We object to that for reasons that I think have been discussed with you previously.
MR. NEALEY: Okay. Well, fine. I’ve noted my question; you’ve noted your objection. And I take it, if I ask for Dr. Hoffman to produce her handwritten notes that she’s made of these sources, that you would also -- your position would be that those wouldn’t be produced by you, either?
MR. WALKER: It’s the same position:
She’s producing what she has for this case, her notes
that she prepared as part of her work on this case, which is what she’s already brought. So if the request is for notes that don’t relate to this case, then we object to that for the reasons that have already been provided.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, Dr. Hoffman, do you have notes someplace of the secondary sources or -- that you’ve looked at?
A Yes. I have them on some of the secondary sources. Not all.
Q Okay.
And where are those notes kept?
A Generally, handwritten in the file.
Q Do you have a particular file with your notes on the secondary sources that you’ve looked at and considered?
A Yeah. There’s a particular file I would go to if I wanted to find them. I’m not sure every note would be in that file, but that’s -- would be my starting point. Most of it would be.
Q Okay.
So the secondary sources, if I wanted to know what secondary sources you looked at, that file of notes would tell me the secondary -- at least some
of the secondary sources that you’ve reviewed; is that correct?
A Yes. They would indicate some of the secondary sources that I’ve reviewed.
Q And you’ve reviewed those secondary sources as part of your study of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
Again, I consider the primary sources my authoritative sources, if you will. The secondary sources are a sampling of books or articles I’ve read, but it’s not exhaustive, because it’s not the most important part of my research.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And I think I’d ask that that file of notes from review of secondary materials be produced as well?
MR. WALKER: We have the same -MR. NEALEY: If you could forward that -let me finish.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And Dr. Hoffman, you could forward that file on to counsel to produce?
A Well, no. That’s not electronic. I’d have to make Xerox copies of those materials. And then I could forward the duplicates.
Q Okay.
I understand what you’re saying.
MR. WALKER: And we have the same
objection.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Your position, Defense Counsel, is you will not produce that either?
MR. WALKER: We object to the production of materials that are unrelated to this case.
She has produced a reliance list. You have a list of everything that she’s relying on for this case. You have her notes for these cases. And to the extent that the request relates to something that wasn’t prepared for this case or these cases, I should say we do object.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Dr. Hoffman, you mentioned you had a whole truckload of primary sources and also some secondary sources.
All of those primary and secondary sources, the truckload of materials -- you considered all of that as part of your study of the history of
public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: They’re all things that I read in order to understand the subject very fully.
As I mentioned, however, the universe is far too large to reproduce for you easily -- nor would it be necessary -- in the sense that what I’m relying upon are the materials I have produced for you, which are quite representative.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well -- but to be -- make it clear, and so that the record is clear, all that as you described it a truckload of primary and secondary materials, you read all of those, and you considered all of those as part of your study of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
And in the same way that if you were to study the American Revolution, you might have the -the Declaration of Independence might figure in a number of different documents or, you know, secondary sources. But to talk about the Declaration of
Independence, you wouldn’t feel it was necessary to bring all ten copies, or versions or discussions of it that you might have.
So, certainly you’ve read them all, and considered them all and could conceivably in some perfect world produce them all, but I can’t imagine anybody would want to read them all. That’s why I’ve tried to come up with a list I think is somewhat manageable for us both.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So -- and that’s my next question: Since you read and considered as part of your study all of those truckload of primary and secondary sources, how is it that this list for Waggoner -- which is 248 pages long -- how did you figure out what went on the list and what didn’t?
A Well, again, it’s part of the historical method: Always to consider what is most representative; what is relevant; what pieces of evidence, you know, speak for maybe a whole group of kinds of evidence, so that you’re not overwhelming a reader, or jury or an attorney with too many things that become redundant.
So, for example, let’s take the 19 -January 1964 date, when the Surgeon General first
released his report. You know, a newspaper like the Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel had 18 articles that one day on this subject. There were a lot of articles in the days that came afterwards. There were a lot of articles on the days that preceded it. But from the point of view of being representative and making it clear for the jury how the Sun Sentinel might have covered that topic, I’ll probably just pick out maybe two out of that possibly 35 or 40 articles I could show.
And so it seemed to me it would be burdensome on you, as well as on me, as well as on the jury to try to show all the articles, when basically, a couple will illustrate the point quite well and in a fair way that shows the extent of public concern about the topic.
Q Dr. Hoffman, just as a -- you know, to use a simple term -- scratch that.
Let’s look at your report for a second, Exhibit 2. And right after your signature, there is a document that says, "Waggoner" at the top. And it says, "Dr. Hoffman has considered or may review the following materials in this case . . .," and it’s a two-page document.
A I’m sorry. I’m trying to follow you now on this.
There is a -- where is this? What part --Q In your report, Exhibit 2, at the back of -- right after your signature, which is at page 64, there is a two-page document that’s entitled -- it says at the top, "Waggoner," and it says, "Dr. Hoffman has considered or may review the following materials in this case . . .," and it’s a two-page list.
Did you prepare that?
A No. I did not type it up. But I would certainly have gone over this list with them, you know -- these are the kinds of things -- they’re on my list -- basically all this sort of stuff.
So I did not type it up. However, it’s -I would suspect it was an attorney who was trying to give an overview of the kinds of materials. As you said, it does come after my signature.
Q Okay.
So the lawyers prepared this two-page document; is that correct?
A Yeah. It looks like what they did is they took things that are already on my reliance list, and they just kinda listed them so you would have a
little clearer idea of the universe.
Q So did you sit on the phone and give them these items, or did they just -- the lawyers just prepared this list?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q That’s right after your signature?
A Oh, you know, we’ve discussed it many times over the period of time I was working on this report. So these are all things we talked about any number of times. And I would say, for example: All right. You know, I want to make sure that, you know, since Ms. Waggoner read Reader’s Digest, I want to make sure we have Reader’s Digests on there. So it looks like, in this list, that they made me put:
Okay, Reader’s Digest. And other kinds of things.
So these are -- it looks like a culled list from my larger reliance list.
Q But you didn’t provide the information -you didn’t sit down and say, include this on the list; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I did in the sense that I would say: Include this, please -- in the reliance list. And I’m going to include that on the
reliance list. So it’s -- it’s very directly from me, but I didn’t sit down and type up this particular list.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, looking at your reliance list,
Exhibit 3, did you type up Exhibit 3?
A No. I’m not that good a typist.
Q The lawyers typed up Exhibit 3; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, I’m not sure who did. I would suspect it wasn’t a lawyer, but maybe it was. Certainly, the list was typed by some staff member at Jones Day.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
And did you -- how did the specific materials on here, how did this grouping of over 7,160 documents -- how did that get created?
A Well, as I said to you, I would sometimes say: I want to make sure we have a lot of these articles that I’ve collected on, say, from the Gainesville Sun -- just picking up a name at random, probably because Mr. Gollihue got that newspaper. So sometimes, I would get some feedback of: Well, okay. We’ve already have 40 of these. Do we need more of
these?
I’ll say: Well, no. We don’t need more of those. That pretty much does us for the Gainesville Sun.
So sometimes it’s a conversation back-and-forth, because sometimes attorneys are aware of issues in a particular case that I don’t know about, and I’m not aware of. But it’s at my direction -- the list that’s created.
Q But you didn’t pick these documents on the list. The lawyers or somebody working under the lawyers picked them; right?
A No.
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I picked these
documents.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Did you actually go pull these documents and the 7,160 documents, did you actually pull them out and give them to the lawyers?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, some of them, yes; and some of them, no.
For example, as you know, there are a number of cases and so they have digitized quite a
few things that I don’t have to provide a copy. I have my own copy, or I even obtained it. But sometimes someone else -- another historian might have obtained something as well. So they would already have, for example, a Time magazine article that I have. And they’d have a digitized copy. And I tend not to digitize too many things.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, let me give you a -- an example. There’s an item here, number 3235, ”A Frank Statement of Policy: Reilly Plastictypes Printer’s Ink.” It’s on page 111 of the reliance list.
A I’m sorry. Let me find 111.
Is that in the middle of the page? Bottom of the page?
Q It’s in the middle. It’s number 3235.
A Oh, okay. Sorry about that. Gotcha.
Q Okay.
It’s a document entitled, ”A Frank Statement of Policy, Reilly Plastic Pipes, Printer’s Ink.”
A Right.
Q Did you -- did you pull that document out and ask that it be included on this list?
Sometimes I’ll say something like -- you know, I want to get some of these frank statements because there are, of course, a number of frank statements on different kinds of things. And so, you know, somewhere at the attorney’s office, it would say: Okay. Well, here’s one. It’s one from Printer’s Ink here.
So I would take a look at it and say:
Yeah. Let’s use that.
There’s another one on toilet paper, which I believe is still here as well.
Q So you didn’t pull this and put it on the list; the lawyers pulled this and put it on the list; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, as I mentioned, I’m not actually typing up the list or any such thing.
It is a process of discussion. And I will say something like, you know: I want some union materials on here.
And so I’ll look at the union materials I have, and we’ll have a conversation about it.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q You didn’t ever go through and pull all these documents; the lawyers pulled all of them;
right, Doctor?
THE WITNESS: No. That’s not true.
MR. FOWLER: Completely misstates her testimony. Objection.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q How about an article -- go to page 37,
Dr. Hoffman.
A Okay.
Q It’s item number 1042.
A Number 37, 10 -- oh, okay. Yeah. I’m sorry. There’s several sets of numbers here.
Q Page 37, document number 1042.
A Yeah. I gotcha now.
Q An article -- Dr. Molner -- "Many Irritants Cause Eczema" -- from the Pensacola News from 1962.
A Yes. That’s right.
Q Did you tell the lawyers to put this document on this list?
A Yes.
Again, it’s kind of a -- it’s a process of conversation. In other words, Dr. Molner, for example, was -- had a lot of articles. And one of the things I always want to make sure is on there are
articles which show how -- what you would call "advice columnists” or -- advising, you know, their readers. And so from the Pensacola Newspaper,
Dr. Molner was syndicated, and he was not only in Pensacola but quite a number of other places as well.
So I wouldn’t take every article written by Dr. Molner, because there would be too many. But I’d want to have a representative sample.
Q And did Ms. Waggoner, did she ever live in Pensacola, Florida?
A No. Victoria Waggoner did not live in Pensacola. She moved to the Jacksonville area later in her life.
But as you know, my general research question is what did Ms. Waggoner and people like her in the states in which she lived know about the harms of smoking. And so that’s why another paper from northern Florida would be important for me to have seen to be able to answer the question.
Q Did Ms. Waggoner ever read the Pensacola
news?
A She -- I don’t believe she did. I’d have to review the notes, but I don’t think she cited that as one of them. She took the -- I think it’s the Florida Times Union.
Q So who made the decision to put an article by Dr. Molner about irritants causing eczema from 1962 from the Pensacola news -- who decided to put that on this list?
A That would be me.
Q Was that you?
A Yes. Me.
Q You made the decision?
A Yes, absolutely.
Q And you went and pulled that from your stack of information from the Pensacola news?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I would look at the Pensacola newspapers and select something.
Now, keep in mind, Dr. Molner -- the headlines are sometimes a bit unclear. For accuracy, you want to give the precise headline as it appears in the newspaper so when you went back into the newspaper, you could find the article again.
But inside the article, that’s where you’d find something on smoking. So I didn’t include it because we wanted to know more about eczema, in other words.
BY MR. NEALEY:
page 149?
Q Are you there?
A I’m almost there.
MR. WALKER: She’s looking.
THE WITNESS: I’m trying to get these papers apart there. They’re stuck together.
Okay. Yes. I’m there now.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q You cite a -- an article here -- let’s just use as an example, 4330.
A Okay.
Q From -- a publication called Good Health in 1931?
A Yes. That’s right.
Q Did Mrs. Waggoner read Good Health?
A No. I don’t believe she would have. And, also, this is 1931. So it was before she was born.
Q Did you go and pull a copy of this Good Health included on the list?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, again, I didn’t -the -- Jones Day has these things digitized, so I wouldn’t have to go pull an article and give it to them.
But, yes, I would want to have articles from Good Health in there. And especially from that early period to show the context in which she was born and that would have led people like Pentecostalists to know something about the harms of smoking.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Did you suggest that that specific issue of Good Health go on here, or did Jones Day pull that?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, I don’t recall on that specific one. Sometimes you’ll say: Okay.
Let’s get a collection of Good Health articles. And, they’re all fairly similar, by the way.
And so to get one from different decades, different parts of a decade, someone else might suggest: Okay. We’ve got this one here.
And that would be fine, because I review
them all.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
Now, your report, Dr. Hoffman, talks in several places about advertising; is that correct?
It says -- just right up front on page 3, you said, "I examined paid advertisements for cigarette brands."
You see that?
A I’m going to turn now to page 3. That certainly is my memory of it. Hold on.
I’m sorry. Which paragraph is that?
Q It’s the bottom paragraph of 4, starting four lines up from the bottom.
A Yes. Thank you very much. I do see it
now.
Q Okay.
So you said, "I examined paid advertisements for cigarette brands."
I don’t see a single cigarette advertisement on this list, Exhibit 3.
MR. WALKER: Is there a question?
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Am I wrong?
Are there cigarette advertisements on
here?
A Well, there are some advertisements on there. But generally, they’re not cigarette advertisements. They’re advertisements for quitting
smoking, for example.
Keep in mind that my focus of my research was on what people knew about the harms, and the hazards and the risks associated with smoking. The focus was not on all the information people might have ever had about smoking, but rather, how they would know about the harms associated with it.
Q Dr. Hoffman, where are the paid advertisements for cigarette brands that you say in your report that you examined?
A I didn’t think it was necessary to include images of those. I assumed honestly that you would have some as well.
But keep in mind that, again, my focus was on, you know, the harms and that’s not what is the focus of advertising for any product.
Q Well, I’m -- so you examined a bunch of cigarette advertisements, but you don’t have ’em on your list, Exhibit 3. Where would I find them?
A Well, they would be relatively simple to find. I can tell you, for example, I would go through sometimes a newspaper and look specifically for them to look at the number of them, to see how many there were. I didn’t think -- let’s say if I found 12 that it was necessary to reproduce those 12
since what I’m going to tell you is that it’s a very infrequent occurrence that these advertisements appear at all.
So it just didn’t seem to be necessary based on what I was going to show to the jury.
Q I just lost a contact. If you don’t mind taking about a two-minute break. I’m going to go stick it back in.
A Sure. Go ahead.
THE REPORTER: Off the record.
(Off the record: 3:01 P.M.-3:04 P.M.)
MR. NEALEY: Back on the record.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q You said, Dr. Hoffman, that you had done a survey of cigarette advertisements? Could you describe what that survey was?
A Well, yes, I can.
At one point, I had read in Time magazine that newspaper advertising was only one -- I mean, cigarette advertising was only 1 percent of newspaper advertising. And I just thought that was interesting. And I had a very comprehensive collection of the Los Angeles Times -- every reference that I could find in the Los Angeles Times over a period of time to cigarettes and to ads and
such.
So at one point, I asked my research assistant to sit down and go through an entire month of L.A. Times and look for every single possible advertisement of cigarettes just to, you know, kind of get a ballpark figure in the sense that whether or not the Time magazine article was correct or not. So we went through and got every teeny -- from the teeny, tiniest to the largest ads to get a numerical comparison with other types of advertising. Because, of course, there’s ads for lots of other things as well: You know, cars, and alcohol, and food and animals. The list goes on and on.
So by golly, by gum, we found out that actually the percentage of tobacco advertisements was something like -- we found 1.8 percent. So Time magazine says 1 percent.
We did this for three months, actually.
For like the months of January for like three different years that stretched over a couple decades. I’m just interested. Sometimes, you know, you wonder if something is correct or not, so you try to figure it out. So that’s the survey I did. Homegrown.
A It’s a part of my general knowledge.
Since none of the plaintiffs actually read the L.A. Times, it probably wouldn’t come up in any big way in this case. But it helped me to feel more certain that Time magazine was correct.
Q Now -- so you read in Time magazine that only 1 percent of newspaper ads were for cigarettes; is that correct?
A That’s correct.
Q And, of course, newspapers also have a whole classified section of advertisements; correct?
A Yes, they generally do.
Q And they also, in addition to having a whole section of classified advertisements -- they also have a whole bunch of ads, generally, for department stores and sales at department stores; right?
A Yes. They have lots of different types of advertising in them.
Q Now, magazines and periodicals like Time magazine, do they have classified advertisements in them?
A No. I have personally never noticed that in a magazine.
Q Do magazines -- do they have ads for the
weekly special that cover up two or three pages at the local grocery store?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Most magazines that I looked at are national magazines. So they might have advertisements for a particular type of grocery.
They might advertise a particular kind of soda, let’s say, but not the local store. Although they could have Kmart, or Target or something, and then it’s a local store and a national store.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q But magazines don’t have the kind of, you know, full-page ads for the weekly special at Safeway, or your local Albertson’s or something like that; is that correct?
A Gosh, I don’t know. That sounds right, but I haven’t really examined them for that purpose.
I just tend to notice -- I would in my own mind think, is this a food category, or is it a clothing category or something like that.
Q Now, a lot of the types of advertisements that one sees in newspapers, that one doesn’t see in periodicals like Time or Reader’s Digest; correct?
A I don’t know. I really don’t think -- I think that’s outside my expertise. I don’t want to
get too deeply into it.
Q Well, Dr. Hoffman, since you went and looked at newspapers and you heard this reference in Time, did you ever go and, for instance, check to see what percentage of advertising space in Time magazine was tobacco advertisements?
A I’ve done that on a few occasions.
Q And the percentage of the advertising in Time magazine -- it’s not 1 percent for tobacco ads; it’s considerably higher; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: It’s -- I don’t think it’s that much higher. Not in my calculations.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Have you calculated that in your opinion historically in the ’40s, and ’50s and ’60s, the percentage of advertising in Time magazine -1 percent of them was tobacco ads?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. It’s a different percentage. It’s a higher percentage, but it’s still relatively low.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, in magazines, isn’t it fair to say that the percentage of ad space in magazines,
periodicals, is more like 10 to 15 percent for tobacco companies in the ’50s and ’60s?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, again, I haven’t done any exhaustive survey of this. It’s really been more thumbnail sketches because I’m not an advertising expert, per se, but I’m interested in the proportion of advertising.
And the ones I’ve looked at have ranged between 5 and 9 percent on average, which is quite a bit higher than the 1 percent, of course, but it still means that more than 90 percent of the products advertised are something other than tobacco.
So, again, I thought that that was an important indicator to me that advertising was not omnipresent in that sense as compared to other products.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So if in your calculation, when you looked at periodicals, you found 5 to 9 percent of the advertising space was for a cigarette ad, that means any periodical you would have picked up would have had a couple cigarette ads in it; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. That’s not true.
Q And it’s not true because at least one publication you looked at, Reader’s Digest, didn’t take cigarette ads after a certain period of time; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: In that particular case, they never took cigarette advertising.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q If have you picked up a copy of Time magazine in the ’40s, ’50s and ’60s, you inevitably in every issue would find a couple cigarette advertisements; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think that’s probably true. You would generally find one to three.
But, again, I haven’t studied this that exhaustively. I’ve only studied a few issues, just to get a thumbnail sketch to verify my impressions, corroborate what Time magazine was saying.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And if you studied a -- any magazine directed at the African-American community in that ’40s, ’50s and ’60s timeframe -- in fact, even into
the ’70s -- you’d also find at least a couple full-page cigarette ads; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, it would depend on the publication. Many would. Some would not.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And if you picked up a publication like Life magazine, would you find -- in any issue of Life in the ’40s, ’50s, ’60s and ’70s, you’d find several full-page cigarette ads; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: What you would find and what certainly I found was there would typically be one or two ads -- sometimes more -- but that, again -- more than 90 percent of the ads would be for something else. So they would be mixed in very much in the kind of average way that they were in other places as well.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And if you picked up a publication that was directed at young people and particularly young males, a sports magazine or something like playboy in the -- Playboy obviously wasn’t in the ’40s, but if you picked up something aimed at a younger male audience in the ’40s, ’50s and ’60s and into the
’70s, you’re also going to find in any periodical, two, three, maybe more cigarette ads; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’m sure you would in some; and some others, I know you wouldn’t.
Mad Magazine is an example where you would not -- and that was certainly aimed at young men. Although, I have to admit I read it myself as well.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And if you picked up a sports publication in the ’50s, and ’60s and ’70s, you would find tobacco ads; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You might in some.
Again -- you have to remember, of course, again, that it would be in the context where there would be lots of different kinds of advertising. And I think that it would commonly be one of the forms, but one of the less common forms.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And if you watched four or five hours of television in the ’50s or the ’60s before the cigarette ban on TV, you would have also seen a cigarette ad; right?
certainly was on the air up until 1971. Turning point.
Q In fact, you could go through a day, and you’d watch several hours of television, and you’d read a newspaper, and you might read a periodical and you’d see half a dozen or more cigarette ads in that period of time; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yeah. You might, or you
might not.
You might also, of course, see advertisements for how to stop smoking. You might also see, you know, advertisements that in one way or another indicated why smoking wasn’t a good thing.
So all of those things were mixed together, and the public, you know, was exposed to it all.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And the cigarette ads in the 1950s, they were advertising filters; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yeah. I think in general, filters were advertised. That was a distinction that cigarette makers would make between different kinds of cigarettes.
Q And starting in 1971, you would see advertisements based around the fact that they got a low tar, or a low nicotine or they were light cigarettes and prominently displayed that. That was one form of cigarette advertisements that people would see; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’m sorry.
What was the year you just cited there?
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q I think it’s 1971.
A Okay. No. I didn’t quite hear that part of the sentence.
Yes. I mean, this, of course, was something that the Federal Trade Commission asked the companies to do, was a nonbinding requirement, but the companies cooperated in doing that. And they were asked to put it on, you know, all of the packages and eventually the advertising.
Q Now, there’s a whole literature regarding cigarette advertisements -- in fact, there have been whole articles published analyzing cigarette advertisements and how prevalent they were and who they were targeted at.
MR. WALKER: Objection to form. Move to strike the statement.
THE WITNESS: As you recall, I look primarily at original-source documents. And I do not follow the professional literature on advertising per se, because I’m not an advertising expert. It’s just something that historians do typically include in their research.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, let me just give you an example.
A ten-second Internet search while I’m talking to you on the phone pulled up a paper entitled, "Cigarette Advertisements in Magazines: "Evidence For the Differential Focus on Women’s and Youth Magazines." It was published in the journal Health, Education, Behavior, in June 1988. And it is an analysis of cigarette advertisements in eight popular magazines from 1960 to 1985.
Do you ever read that?
A Again, that’s a -- that’s a kind of -that’s a kind of secondary source that I really wouldn’t attend to. It sounds like that was written probably for other scholars of advertising.
In my case, I’m really looking more at
what people were being told about the harms -- again, going back to my research focus.
So, for example, I would tend to include what the schools told people about advertising or what religious organizations like, for example, again, Victoria Waggoner, since we’ve been focusing on her -- you know, the Pentecostalists would say: Advertising, you have to be very careful. All kinds of advertising is self-interested. That’s the nature of advertising. Beware of what advertisers will tell you.
So what I looked at was the context in which people received advertising. And then to some degree, the proportion of that advertising was in these various publications. As I said, it’s fairly small.
Q This article about the prevalence in contents of cigarette advertisements in eight popular magazines from 1960 to 1985, it’s written by four professors at Stanford University. And it’s a peer-reviewed published article.
Did you ever read it?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form. Asked and
answered.
give you the same answer. I assume they’re not historians, and that they are probably advertising, or social science, or behaviorists or something like that. That wouldn’t be the kind of material I would be generally looking for.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So things that you can find by professors at Stanford who analyzed complete runs of magazines looking at the prevalence of advertisements in 1960 to 1985, that wouldn’t be something you’d be interested in looking at in rendering your opinions that -- in looking at paid advertisements; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I have to say: What’s the question there, again? I’m sorry.
Would you mind just restating it for me, because it sounds like it’s more of a rhetorical question.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Did you look -- did you do a literature review of the literature on tobacco advertisements to find out who had done analyses of them; of their contents before coming in to testify?
A No. See, I looked at the primary documents, not the secondary literature on
advertising. That to me is what’s relevant for a historian to look at.
Q And the fact that four professors at Stanford University did a comprehensive analysis of the cigarette advertisements and their prevalence in eight popular magazines from 1960 to 1985, and then it was published in the peer-reviewed literature -that was not something that you would be interested in looking at before rendering your opinions on paid advertisements and their prevalence; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
MR. FOWLER: And, you know, this is getting really argumentative, Scott. I object to it on that basis as well.
THE WITNESS: I -- to me, what’s most relevant is not what advertising experts are saying about advertising, but the kind of warnings that people like Victoria Waggoner were getting about advertising, the publications -- in particular, that she mentioned that other people deposed in the case mentioned, like Reader’s Digest -- that was specifically, you know, in her home -- since I knew that there was no advertising in that, or in the other magazines that she mentioned -- such as U.S. News and World Report, I tried to look at the
specific publications she referenced rather than a generic group of magazines that some group of experts is interested in for their own reasons.
See what I mean?
I don’t know how better to explain this.
But I tried to go back to what Victoria Waggoner and her family actually read. And that’s what I looked at.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, since you tried to go back, as you’ve just testified, and looked at what Victoria Waggoner and her family read, the third article on your reliance list is People magazine.
Did Victoria Waggoner read People
magazine?
A No. She didn’t reference People magazine.
And keep in mind, of course, here, I would go into greater depth on something that she actually talked about or someone else in her group of intimates spoke about. But I’m also interested in what the general public is seeing as well. And so, therefore, I am getting kind of a wide, broad-brush look at all different kinds of magazines.
So People magazine is a good example of something that, you know, was read by the public.
But to get a specific Stanford survey of seven magazines or something just honestly doesn’t seem terribly relevant to me in my expert opinion.
Q Let me ask about this article, Cigarette Advertising in Magazines: Evidence For a Differential Focus on Women’s and Youth Magazines that was published in the Journal of Health,
Education Behavior in June 1988 by four professors at Stanford University. And they say in the abstract, that, quote: Across all eight magazines, the average number of cigarette ads per issue increased substantially following the 1971 ban on cigarette ads.
Do you agree or disagree with that conclusion they’ve reached in their peer-reviewed study?
MR. WALKER: Do you have a copy of the document for the witness to review, Scott, if you’re going to be asking questions about its content?
MR. NEALEY: No. I found it in ten seconds on the Internet while we were on the phone. So, no, I’m afraid I don’t have a copy for you.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q But do you agree with what is in the abstract?
I’ve read you the abstract, and do you agree with it?
MR. WALKER: I’m actually asking if you have a copy for the witness to review, if you want to ask her about statements that are made in the article or in abstracts of the article, not whether you have one for me.
MR. NEALEY: No. I don’t have a copy.
Counsel, as I told the witness, I found this in ten seconds on the Internet while talking with the witness.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So my question is: These authors in the abstract I’m looking at of the article that we’ve been discussing -- it says, quote: Across all eight magazines, the average number of cigarette ads for per issue increased substantially following the 1971 television ban on cigarette ads.
Is that a true statement or a false statement, in your opinion?
MR. WALKER: Object to asking a question about a document that you’re not allowing the witness to review.
But you can answer, if you can.
question.
THE WITNESS: Yeah. I honestly think I would have a better -- I could respond to it better if I had read that article. So I am kind of flying blind there.
Perhaps you’d like me to get up on one of the local computers here.
MR. NEALEY: I’d be more than happy to.
You’re going to see the same thing I’m seeing, if you’d like me to. The website that I’m looking at, and the first thing that popped up when I did a search was http:\\hdd.sagepub --s-a-g-e-p-u-b -- .com -- /content/15/2/225.abstract.
MR. WALKER: Is that a link to the actual document or just to some abstract of it?
MR. NEALEY: This is the abstract.
MR. WALKER: I think she was asking you if you had a copy of the document that she could look at. She said if she had read that, she could -- be better able to respond to your question.
MR. NEALEY: No. I just have the
abstract.
THE WITNESS: Now, in my experience it’s better really to read whole thing, because an abstract sometimes is kind of a funny distillation of
something that -- I -- I -- yeah. I believe you’re completely, Mr. Nealey -- to read it accurately, but I think if I was able to opine on these findings, I’d have to really read the article.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q But put another way, you don’t know whether the number of tobacco advertisements in magazines, popular magazines, went up substantially following the 1971 ban on cigarette ads?
You don’t know one way or another; is that
correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, I’ve not heard that before.
The Time magazine article I was telling you about I think was from the ’80s. Again, I’m just recalling that off the cuff. I’d have to go back and look at it to be 100 percent sure.
I’ve not heard that before, and I don’t even know what publications, of course, they’re talking about in the research article you found.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And in looking at this abstract of this research article from -- from four Stanford professors in the journal, Health, Education,
Behavior, the abstract continues: Moreover, beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, proportionally more ads were placed in women’s and youth-oriented magazines than in magazines which targeted other population segments.
From your review of paid advertisements, do you agree or disagree with that statement?
MR. WALKER: Object to the form.
And I’m continuing to object to asking questions about a document she’s not reviewed and you don’t have, to show her.
THE WITNESS: I don’t really have a basis for answering the question accurately. I’m sorry. I wish I could.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
And then the authors say -- the abstract says: These data suggest that the tobacco industry may have responded to decreases in the number of smokers and the per capita consumption of cigarettes with an enterprising attempt to recruit new smokers, particularly young people and women.
Do you agree with that statement or
disagree?
MR. WALKER: Objections.
THE WITNESS: Yeah. I’d have to say the same thing.
And, also, of course, you know, in the cases we’re talking about today, none of these people said that they were influenced by advertising to start smoking. So it just doesn’t seem relevant, nor do I have the document. So I can’t answer the question. I’m sorry, Mr. Nealey.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Do you have a file someplace of the paid advertisements that you looked at?
A No. They wouldn’t be separated from -you know, from newspaper articles. You know, sometimes you can have newspaper and a copy of an advertisement in that collection. You know, I have quite a few like that. They wouldn’t be segregated.
Q Let’s put it this way: When you went through Time magazine, and People magazine and Newsweek and all the reports that you’ve done -- all the publications you’ve looked at -- you also noted when they had advertisements. I mean, you saw those ads; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
they were there.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And I could pretty much show you any ad from a publication, periodical, from the ’30s, ’40s, ’50s, ’60s, ’70s -- and you would have seen that advertisement at one point or another; is that correct?
A No. That’s not correct.
Q If I showed you an advertisement from the 1940s that was one of these advertisements that talked about the fact that it’s the brand doctors smoke or the brand doctors prefer or that it has smoke that helps with smoker’s cough, you would have seen an advertisement like that in your work over the last 12 years; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. I’ve seen some of those. Certainly not in all the publications I looked at, though. But, yes, I have seen those from time to time.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And you’ve also seen all the advertisements from the 1940s during the war period that advertises their use of cigarettes by sailors, and airmen, and people in the Army and the Marines;
right?
THE WITNESS: Honestly, I don’t recall any like that. I might have, but I don’t recall any.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q You don’t recall any advertisements by the cigarette companies with the military?
A No. I just don’t know. Sorry.
Q And if I showed you an article of Time magazine from the 1940s, the war period, you wouldn’t recognize advertisements in there from the 1940s with military theme -- soldiers, sailors, airmen?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, I might. I might.
I wasn’t really studying that, especially considering that our plaintiffs in this case were born in the mid-1940s. And so, you know, we are focusing on this case. And, you know, it wouldn’t be very relevant.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q I could show you ads from the 1950s that advertised and touted the quality of their filters and how well their filters worked. And you’d recognize those as examples of advertisements that you’d seen; correct?
THE WITNESS: I certainly saw some advertisements which focused on filters. Yup.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And when we roll into the ’60s, you’d also see advertisements that were aimed at women; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t quite know how to answer that honestly.
You know, different brands have different emphases. So -- so, for example, a brand like Eve was oriented towards women, since it has a woman’s name in the title quite clearly. Or Virginia Slim.
So advertisements like that would be, I think, geared towards women. Although, as we know, Mr. Pickett smoked Eve, so I guess that’s not 100 percent true.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And we also -- I could show you examples of advertisements that were directed at African-Americans; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, advertisements in my experience and for all products, especially in recent years, have a multicultural, you know, mix of folks.
know, you would see advertised. And there would be African-Americans in them or, you know, a variety of groups -- sometimes of not clear racial background.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q But back in the ’40s, ’50s, ’60s and ’70s there were brands of cigarettes and advertisements that were specifically directed at the African-American community; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I don’t know about that. I just really don’t know enough about the marketing or product design, ’cause that was outside my research.
Again, I’m really interested in how people knew about the harms. And, of course, I saw advertisements for, you know, Jim Brown of the Cleveland Browns, who was African-American, who said, "I don’t smoke.”
And there would be other groups, too, where clearly they were trying to in these ads to reach out to people in different backgrounds and say, "Hey, someone like you cares about this issue.”
So there would always be a mix.
BY MR. NEALEY:
the 1970s and after 1971 that touted the low tar, low nicotine or light nature of the cigarettes; right?
Have you seen those ads?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. I’ve seen ads which seemed it appears to me the emphasis is on the low numbers.
And, of course, that was because Congress, and the Surgeon General and the FTC wanted the companies to do that. I mean, they asked them specifically to make those numbers as public as possible. So they did.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Do you have a file someplace that I could look at that contains cigarette advertisements or examples of them that you’ve looked at, as part of your examination of paid advertisements?
A No.
As I’ve indicated, they generally would be interspersed with the -- like newspapers and that kind of thing. So I don’t have them segregated into a file.
Q Now, if I could have the reporter mark Dr. Cummings’s report as -THE REPORTER: 11.
MR. WALKER: While the court reporter is about to mark those, if you’re moving into a new area, it might be a good time for a quick break.
MR. NEALEY: That’s fine.
(Off the record: 3:35 P.M.-3:39 P.M.)
MR. NEALEY: Back on the record.
THE REPORTER: Exhibit 11 is marked for the record.
(Exhibit 11 marked)
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Dr. Hoffman, you know who Dr. Michael Cummings is; correct?
A No, I don’t know offhand.
Q You’ve never heard the name "Michael Cummings” before?
A No, I don’t believe so.
Q Has he testified on the other side of cases from you?
A I don’t know.
Q Did you ask to see the reports of the people who were giving opinions on the other side of this case?
A No, I did not.
Q Mr. Cummings has a list of publications,
almost all of which are in the area of smoking, that has 313 items on it.
Have you ever read anything by Mr.
Cummings -A No, I haven’t.
Q -- or Dr. Cummings?
A Not that I’m aware of.
Q Okay.
Well, I’d like you to turn to page 33 of Dr. Cummings’s report. And I’d like to ask you some questions about whether you looked at particular materials that he’s looked at.
A Okay.
Q If we go to page 33, starting on the second paragraph from the bottom, Dr. Cummings cites and discusses the Federal Trade Commission report to Congress pursuant to the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act in 1967.
Have you ever read that or seen that or reviewed that?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Have I reviewed the FTC report? Is that what you’re saying?
BY MR. NEALEY:
A You know, it rings a bell, but I don’t recall it offhand. I probably have. I’ve read quite a few FTC documents.
Q Okay.
A I’d have to go back --
Q And the Federal Trade Commission report on people’s exposure to marketing themes and communications and advertisements by cigarette companies would be something in the area that you’re giving opinions about; right?
A Yes.
As I said, I’ve reviewed quite a few FTC
documents.
Q Okay.
So it’s highly likely that you’ve seen and read this 1967 FTC report to Congress; is that correct?
A I think it’s a good chance of it.
There were several hearings in Congress in ’67 and ’68 that are reviewed. And it’s possible.
FTC report was wrapped into that testimony. That would be my -- that would be my best guess, not having it in front of me.
Q The only way to find out if you’ve actually read that would be to have you go through
that truckload of documents; is that correct?
A Well, fortunately, it’s better organized than that might suggest. But I’d go back to my congressional hearings and I’d look for it there.
Q Dr. Cummings in the next paragraph talks about two Bate [sic] numbers. And they are documents from the various defendants addressing the effectiveness of their marketing in driving sales.
Have you ever seen either of those
documents?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form. Move to strike the characterization of the documents.
THE WITNESS: Well, honestly, I don’t have my Bates numbers memorized. So I can’t answer it very well. Although, it implies to me -- it says these were -- in sentence number 4, it says, "These were internal business records of the defendants."
And I have not examined the internal records of the defendants. So I think that I probably haven’t seen them.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q You’ve never looked at any of the internal documents from the defendants that relate to the issue of the history of public attitudes towards smoking and related illnesses; is that correct?
THE WITNESS: Yes. Those documents were not relevant to my understanding of the topic, so I did not examine them.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Now, moving on to page 34, Dr. Cummings refers to a 1981 FTC report.
Did you look at the 1981 FTC report on cigarette warnings and cigarette consumption?
A Is this the top paragraph?
Q Yup.
A It says: See 1981 FTC report, Bates number such and such. I might have seen it.
I’m generally looking at, you know, reports that are introduced into Congress. So I could well have seen that one. I don’t recall the number offhand.
Q Okay. And then we go on.
And a couple -- next paragraph -Dr. Cummings says: It is well established in the health-psychology literature that a person’s belief about health risks does have a significant influence on behaviors related to health, such as smoking.
And he cites the National Cancer Institute Theory, At a Glance: A Guide For Health Promotion
Practices From 2005.
Have you ever read that?
A No, I have not.
Q And going down two paragraphs, the paragraph starting, "In fact,” there’s a citation to a book put out by K.E. Warner, called "Selling Smoking: Cigarette Advertising and Public Health," put out by the American Public Health Association in 1986.
Have you ever looked at that book?
A No, I haven’t.
But as you notice, the sentence before that does make the point that I would generally make, which is that smoking has declined because of increasing public awareness on the dangers of smoking.
And of course, I would also add, reshaped attitudes towards it as well.
One of the great campaigns was not just make smoking hazards better known, but to make smoking behavior uncool and socially unacceptable.
So those have all contributed to the
decline.
But I haven’t seen this book in particular it looks like by K.E. Warner.
Again, these look like things that have to do more with cigarette advertising expertise, which is not something I would, you know, generally portray myself as having. I use advertising in the way that historians generally would, which is a different sort of way. We’re not interested in health psychology.
Q And then, Dr. Cummings cites the 1989 Surgeon General report.
Have you read that?
A The 1989 SG report, yes, I have.
MR. WALKER: I don’t know what you did, Scott, but suddenly we can hear you a whole lot better.
MR. NEALEY: I’m at a place where I can pick up the phone. So I did that instead of using the speaker, which in certain places I can do.
MR. WALKER: It’s very helpful.
MR. NEALEY: I figured it would make it
easier.
MR. WALKER: Yeah.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And then Dr. Cummings says -- cites in the next paragraph, a paper by Saad-O’Brien -- "The Tobacco Industry Summons Polls to the Witness Stands: A Review of Public Opinion on the Risks of Smoking,"
A Well, no.
As you note, it was presented at the annual meeting of the American Association For Public Opinion Research. I’m not a poll adjuster. I wouldn’t -- that’s not the kind of document that would be relevant in my research.
There’s a whole -- there’s a whole universe of information out there that one could conceivably draw in to any project, but that’s one reason why it’s important to carefully define your question, or, you know, you’d be at it forever.
I cite polls. That’s a very different kind of usage.
Q Dr. Hoffman, you cite polls in your work in your report, don’t you?
A Yes, I do.
Q So having cited some polls, and looked at some polls, don’t you think it would be important to understand something about polling and what from the secondary literature, how that polling is viewed?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t think it would be appropriate for a historian to try to form the depths
of the theories of polling in order to use that information, any more than I would try to understand medical science to understand why it is people thought that smoking was harmful.
What I’m interested in is that people were told it was harmful and that they received that information. So that’s what’s important for my research, not these questions that are more important for specialists who want to understand better how medical science determined that or, you know, how polls measure it -- that kind of thing. So I would use it in a more general way.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, Dr. Hoffman, you just said two things at once, and I want to see if I can understand.
You said that it’s interesting to know if people were presented or given materials; is that correct? That’s one question?
A One question is: What kind of information was the public being provided by teachers or schools or parents or whoever.
So, yeah, that’s one part of it.
that information was being received by the individual; correct?
A Yes. The reception of information is also important to analyze. Very much so.
Q Okay.
And whether somebody receives or doesn’t receive information, or whether they process it, that’s an area for a cognitive, or social psychologist or a health medicine specialist; that’s not your expertise; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I don’t think that’s an accurate characterization.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Have you ever published anything on how people receive information or don’t receive information?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, yes.
As a historian, I would often look at the question of how people receive and respond to information. A good example would be World War II. Americans were renowned for being isolationists, but over the course of the mid- and late 1930s, they gradually came around to a different point of view
because of information they were receiving from newspapers and magazines about the threat of Nazi Germany.
So there -- how people received information and how they responded to it is very important; and I, for example, in that study used polls by the Gallup organization to determine how Americans received and responded to information.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Dr. Hoffman, is there a difference in the perception between smokers and nonsmokers of whether lung cancer was caused by smoking throughout the ’50s and ’60s?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Some polls were segregated, and those numbers would be separated out. And sometimes they weren’t separated out. And they, you know, show different results -- not wildly different, but, yes, they tended to be different. Sometimes smokers had a higher degree of belief, and other times smokers were more skeptical about it. But that was certainly something that was discussed.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Can you cite a single poll to me or identify a single poll in the ’50s or ’60s where
smokers had a higher belief that smoking caused lung cancer than nonsmokers?
A Well, what I was thinking of when I said that was a study that was done in San Diego, actually, among high school students. And they said that high school students who were smokers tended to remember the warnings and the classes better than students who weren’t smokers. That’s just something that pops into my mind when you ask the question.
Q I asked a very specific question in response to what you just said, Dr. Hoffman.
Can you identify a single poll anyplace in the ’50s or ’60s in which smokers reported a higher belief that smoking caused lung cancer than nonsmokers?
MR. WALKER: Move to strike the initial
statement.
THE WITNESS: Polls are all phrased differently.
To me, it’s relevant if students who are smokers remember being warned about it. And I’ve got to tell you: I don’t remember the specific poll, if the emphasis was only lung cancer or other harms because there are a lot of harms associated with smoking. And those students who were smokers tend to
remember it better. That’s just the poll I’m thinking of. So that’s what comes to mind.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q So you’re unable to identify any poll in the ’50s or ’60s in which smokers reported a higher belief that smoking caused lung cancer than nonsmokers; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, I’d have to go back to my materials to see precisely what they said.
As I said, the figures were in different places at different times. The ’50s and ’60s are -compared with the ’70s and ’80s -- the figures move around a little bit. But, I’m sorry. I can’t answer that question as you phrased it.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And Dr. Hoffman, you’re well aware from having reviewed these materials over 12 years that when you look at polls from the ’50s and ’60s -- in fact, beyond that -- that smokers consistently report a lower belief that tobacco smoking causes cancer or is bad for their health than nonsmokers; correct?
A It would be helpful if we looked at the specific polls. But sometimes they will say: I understand it’s been linked, but I haven’t decided
whether it’s conclusive or not.
And I think sometimes, yes, the smokers do indicate a greater skepticism. But we’d have to look at the specific polls, which I don’t have at my fingertips.
Q Well, let me give a couple of examples.
Mr. Court Reporter, we’ve sent two Gallup reports, one dated June 1960 and one dated 1964. I believe you have both of them?
THE REPORTER: Yes.
MR. NEALEY: Let’s mark those as the next exhibits, Exhibit 12 and Exhibit 13.
(Exhibit 12 marked)
(Exhibit 13 marked)
THE REPORTER: Off the record.
(Off the record: 3:55 P.M.-4:01 P.M.)
MR. NEALEY: Back on the record.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Dr. Hoffman, as we were talking about the differences between beliefs of smokers and nonsmokers, I’ve marked Exhibit 12 and Exhibit 13.
Have you ever seen these documents before?
A No. I haven’t seen these documents.
It looks like they might be internal documents from the statement on the front cover, but
Q So you don’t recall in all this 12 years of work -- you’ve never seen either document 12 or 13; is that correct?
A You know, I don’t recall these particular documents. They look like internal documents.
And, of course, the Gallup organization, they tend to use the same typeface in everything they do, so I’ve seen many, many Gallup polls. They look very similar to this -- these particular ones.
I’m rather guessing they’re internal documents based on what it says on the front page, which says they’re not for public distribution. But I don’t recall right now.
Q And if we turn to page 5 of Exhibit 12, do you see the differences broken down between the beliefs of smokers and all respondents as to whether smoking is one of the causes of lung cancer?
A Yes. I can see that now. Thank you.
Q And is this consistent with what you’ve seen in the polls you’ve looked at?
A Yeah. I see that there is a difference between ’em. The cigarette smokers are somewhat less in their beliefs that it’s -- it switches over time, and it’s kind of going up for everybody, it looks
like. But cigarette smokers are lagging a little behind the other adults.
Q And if we look on page 6, and if we actually break the numbers into smokers and nonsmokers, the way the chart on page 6 does, the difference is even greater because we’ve -- we’re taking the cigarette smokers out of the "all adults"; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’m sorry. Let me see -okay. Yes. I see what you’re saying here.
Cigarette nonsmokers were 69 percent -- something like that. Yeah. In June 1959 -- as opposed to cigarette smokers being 43 percent. So, yeah, there’s a more significant difference when it’s set up that way.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q That’s a 26 percent difference; right?
A Yeah. Looks like it.
Q And if we look at today, which is the June 2006 number, that’s showing a 15 percent difference between the belief of smokers and nonsmokers?
A Where are you?
A I don’t have that in front of me. Where do you have that?
Q It’s the next column over from June 1959, on page 6.
A Oh, today. I thought you meant like today today.
Q No.
A Sorry about that. Well, John is rubbing his brow. I think he thought you meant today, also.
We’re still back on page 6; right? And today being six months later than June 1950 -- no. A year later.
So there, again, that seems to be fairly typical of these figures. They bounce around.
Actually, the nonsmoker number had gone down a little bit, and the cigarette smokers had gone up a little bit. They’re slightly closer together, actually, in that second column under the "Today."
Q And if we look at Exhibit 13, and I direct you to page L-6 -A Okay. I’m getting there. Okay. Okay.
Yup.
Q And this report’s a couple more polls -three extra polls, and it shows the Gallup results for May 1962, June 1963 and February 1964.
A Right.
Q And you see there, also, that there is a significant difference in the beliefs of nonsmokers and smokers as to whether cigarette smoking is one of the causes of lung cancer; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, the interesting thing -- one interesting thing, looks like the smokers of cigars and pipes actually have a higher level of belief than do the nonsmokers. 77 percent of them think it’s the cause of lung cancer.
So, yes, you do see variances among these different groups. The nonsmokers it looks like it stayed pretty much the same. It’s fairly flat. Whereas the belief of current cigarette smokers is going up and has climbed fairly significantly.
And, again, it’s probably odd, but cigar smokers -- they’re the ones who believe most strongly it’s related to lung cancer. It’s kind of curious. You have to look at these things over really long periods of time to make a lot of sense is my general belief and experience.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And when we looked at that last number, which is of course just a single poll, that’s taken
right after the Surgeon General’s report; right?
A February 1964, yes.
Q Yeah.
So in February 1964, right after the Surgeon General’s report when Gallup went out, it found 68 percent of nonsmokers thought that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer; right?
A Yeah. It says: Yes, cigarette smoking is one of the causes of lung cancer.
And as you said, nonsmokers say 68 percent believe that, smokers of cigars say 77 percent believe that and current cigarette smokers 53 percent. So majority, but just above the majority.
Of course, there might have --Q Well -A -- harmful in other ways, too, keep in mind. I noticed in that other document they talked about heart disease, and smokers and nonsmokers were basically at the same figures, one-third.
Q And that’s because the issue that was being trumpeted in the ’50s and ’60s was not heart disease; there was a lot of information out about lung cancer. It was called the "cancer scare"; right?
THE WITNESS: I actually think that there was quite a bit on heart disease, and problems in pregnancy and that kind of thing.
The Surgeon General’s report of 1964, as you I’m sure know, covered a number of topics. And they were covered quite fully in the newspapers. The multiple harms of cigarette smoking, including addiction, of course. Or they, of course, called it "habit-forming" -- the habit-forming nature of cigarette smoking.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, Doctor, if they were both covered and they were covered so extensively, why is it, then, the same poll after the Surgeon General’s report, when it comes to heart disease, 53 percent of nonsmokers say cigarette smoking causes heart disease, but 68 percent says cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, it’s hard for me to know why people draw the particular conclusions that they drew. And, you know, that’s -- I guess that’s why polling is a science.
But it’s quite clear to me that -- and the polls, of course, going back to 1954, said that
70 percent of people believed that smoking was harmful. So the different harms that different members of the public focus on, it’s hard to opine at any given moment in time why they focused as they did at a particular point.
We do know these numbers were going up, of course, and quite consistently for all the kinds of disease.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Do you have an expertise where you can explain why the message is put out so extensively as you testified to and put in your report -- with the release of the Surgeon General’s report -- why those are being viewed differently by nonsmokers and smokers, with nonsmokers having 15 percent more of them believing that smoking causes lung cancer and only, as you said, barely a majority of smokers believing so, after all that information?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: It’s hard -- I can’t really give you an expert answer on how people interpret information.
What I can tell you is that people were being warned and more hearing it and knew that they had been warned, even if they chose not to believe
the warning or to question whether or not all the scientific evidence was in yet. And, of course, we notice among the people in the generation that all of these plaintiffs, or decedents, belong to that --
98	percent of those people were aware that a link had been made. What they chose to make out of that was to some extent an individual decision.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Is it fair to say that the information that’s out there -- how it was received by smokers and nonsmokers and the differences between how it was received, which results in this -- as of February 1964 -- 15 percent difference in belief that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer -- that is not a subject that you are an expert on?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’m sorry. That’s such a long statement.
Could you rephrase it a little more succinctly for me so I make sure I really do follow all parts of your question?
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Is it fair to say that you are not an expertise [sic] in how information is received by people as it relates to belief so that you can
explain why it is that there is a 15 percent difference, for example, in this poll -MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q -- from February, 1964.
A Again, it’s a bit convoluted, but I can say some things about how information is received.
I think that, again, any historian worth her or his salt would have to be able to say something about how information is received. There would just be lots of different measures for it. And opinion polls would be one piece of evidence. They wouldn’t be all that I would look at, and no historian would do that. Certainly maybe a pollster would.
But I would be looking at lots of ways in which people communicate and show how they interpreted information. For example, the numbers of people who actually do smoke going down or the fact that something that was socially acceptable becomes socially unacceptable. That would be to me an important piece of information, or that the laws changed; that you couldn’t smoke in different kinds of places. That would tell me that information was received -- even things like how people behave with
their kids, or how they behaved around their parents tell me that something was received -- like all of these plaintiffs warned their kids, and their kids hid their smoking from them. So that to me would be just as important as looking at a particular poll and why they said a particular thing at a particular moment is -- you know, I can’t give you -- I don’t know if anybody could give you an expert opinion that would fully answer that question.
But, yes, I can certainly testify as to how information was communicated and how it was received.
Q Can you explain why there’s a 15 percent difference, Dr. Hoffman, in the way smokers and nonsmokers were viewing whether smoking caused lung cancer after the Surgeon General’s report was released in February 1964?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form. Asked and
answered.
THE WITNESS: I can’t answer at a specific moment in time why in a specific poll people answered as they did.
What I can just tell you is, as I’ve said before, is that the information was put across, that people like Victoria Waggoner, and Manuel Gollihue
and Oliver Pickett all got it, and received it and to an important extent acted on it in a variety of ways, not always by quitting, obviously, but they might have warned their children, and that to me would be a very powerful indication that they cared and that they had received this information if it’s something they would try to impress upon their children.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
Now, Dr. Hoffman, another important source of information that people would have gotten in the ’50s, ’60s, ’70’s, and more recently about smoking would have come from their doctors; right?
A Yes. I think that it’s true. It would have come very frequently from their doctors.
Q The next article that Dr. Cummings cites on Exhibit 11, is at the bottom and continuing onto the top of page 35 -- is a -- a survey done of doctors in 1958.
A Hmm-hmm. I’m sorry. Which --Q National -A Where is that on page 35?
Q It’s at the top, very first partial paragraph.
Q Have you looked at the National Physicians Advisory Panel for May 1958, their poll of the belief of physicians?
A Well, that looks to me that that was a survey funded by the Tobacco Industry Research Council. And I’m not aware of that survey. Perhaps it was an internal document. Again, I haven’t seen that.
Q Well, if we tried to find out what the public information is, wouldn’t it be interesting to have a whole survey as to what doctors believed as of 1958?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, as I said -- I’ve always been looking at what was there out in the public domain -- what we’d call the "public domain." So I did not go searching for internal documents that wouldn’t have been available to the public.
I can tell you that there were surveys of doctors. I’m certainly remembering one from Florida. Not that particular year, by the way. Just coincidentally, it was a bit later. I think it was ’64 or ’65. And it showed that something like 90 or 95 percent of Florida physicians had warned patients about the health risks of smoking. That’s
I also know that smoking amongst physicians declined more rapidly than perhaps amongst any population group. In fact, the United States Post Office had a huge poster that they put on the side of every mail truck in America for an entire month in 1968 or ’69, right in there, which said, you know: 100,000 doctors have quit. You know: What are you going to do?
So what physicians thought and told the patients was relevant to me. And I cared very much about it. And I did see that and took special note of it wherever it came up. I don’t recall the survey. I don’t -- I’m not even sure if it’s available publicly or not.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Did you, in the 12 years you worked -- did you ever say: Gee, what doctors thought was important; what materials were out there on doctors?
Did you ever go to some of the archives of -- scratch that.
You know there are archives of internal documents -- right? -- from the tobacco industry?
A I’m aware that there are documents online, for example. And I believe that -- I think -- I’m
not entirely certain about this, but I’m pretty sure that Stanton Glantz has a collection at UC -University of California Medical School, I think.
Q Did you ever go look at any of them?
A No. But they weren’t relevant to my research. And I really have quite a lot to do to cover to -- and to get the basis of what I do actually need.
Q When you were looking at the sides of mail trucks and the survey of Florida physicians in the -sometime in the late ’60s, did you ever go look at any of these internal collections of documents to find out what polls and materials had been done by the tobacco industry on the beliefs of physicians?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form. Asked and
answered.
THE WITNESS: Yeah. I think I would answer that in the same way.
Keep in mind there is no shortage of polls. And that the things I’m referring to, I knew about them partly not only because they existed and they were in specialized publications, but also because they were reported on in the newspapers. So often these things had multiple lives, if you will. Not only would you get it on the side of the mail
truck, but you’d get two or three articles telling you it was going to be on the side of the mail truck and that kind of thing. So they were very easily found and more pertinent to my research.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And in the 1950s, a lot of doctors still smoked; right?
A Well, you know, quite a significant portion of the population smoked. And doctors certainly were, you know, within that group. And I think in fact, they might have smoked in slightly higher percentages, but I’d hate to opine too closely on that not having recently looked at those figures.
Q And in the ’50s or early ’60s, you’d go in your doctor’s office, and your doctor would be smoking away as he’s talking to you; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I don’t know. I imagine some doctors did smoke and some did not, just in the same way that some were overweight and some were not. They’re human, too.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q But today, you’re not going to walk into your doctor’s office anyplace in the United States and find your doctor smoking around you; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, as you know, it’s illegal in most places in the United States to smoke indoors or at least in many places. So that would apply to physicians’ offices as well.
As I said, they did quit more rapidly and in greater numbers than -- at least initially, than the general population. They were on the leading edge.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
Continuing with Dr. Cummings’s report, the -- Dr. Cummings cites an Elmer Roper poll conducted for PhilipMorris.
Do you look at those polls?
A No.
Again, I did not look at any internal documents. So if that was a document that was, you know, kind of a proprietary document, if you will, that wouldn’t have been one I would have looked at.
I really looked at -- see, I wasn’t interested just in knowing what those percentages were, Mr. Nealey, but it’s also of great interest to me that Gallup would publish the polls, because Gallup becomes a part of how people know about things. So it not
only -- it’s like a feedback loop in a kind of way.
So Gallup would say: Hey, most people, you dodos -or whatever -- the implication was, most people think smoking is harmful -- 70 percent in January 1954.
And that would be another way in which people would learn.
Billy Graham, for example -- and, of course, Mr. Pickett was Baptist and if I recall correctly, so was Mr. Gollihue. Billy Graham would talk about the Gallup polls.
So, again, these things had multiple lives. They not only told us what a pollster found on a given day, but they became part of the educative process in themselves. So an internal poll would not have that effect.
Q Did any of these three plaintiffs -- did they ever go to a Billy Graham revival?
A I’m not aware. No one testified to that.
I know that they attended church, but I don’t know if they ever attended a revival. I’m not sure anybody was asked that question in deposition.
Q Did anybody of these three plaintiffs ever hear anything that Billy Graham said?
A You know, I don’t know. He was certainly the most famous Baptist preacher for 30 or 40 years.
But, again, remember I’m not trying to place a particular document in the hands of any of these plaintiffs. I’m trying to help you and the jury understand the climate of public awareness. So Billy Graham might not have been something that they particularly listened to, but I know a lot of Baptists did. And all three of these plaintiffs lived in Florida, which is part of the Southern Baptist Convention.
Q Dr. Cummings next cites a 1967 U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare Report.
Have you read that?
A Could you show me what page that’s on, please?
Q It’s on page 35, third paragraph down.
A Sorry. I didn’t realize we were still sticking with page 35. Okay.
"HEW mentioned that consumers needed more information about" -THE REPORTER: Slow down a little bit.
THE WITNESS: I’m so sorry.
"By 1967, U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare Report mentioned that consumers needed more information about cigarettes in order to
make an informed choice.”
So, I’m sorry, sir. What’s your question?
Q Have you looked at that report?
A I’m not sure which report it is. Of course, it doesn’t give the headline, or the title or any specific information that would help me pin it down better. But I might well have seen that report, sure.
That could have been an SG report. I can’t tell if that was an SG report or some other report.
Q You’ve looked at a lot of government reports. Is that fair to say?
You tried to search out all you can find on this issue?
A I didn’t search out every last thing I could find. Historians generally don’t. What we look for is a pattern. And after a certain point, you don’t necessarily keep trying to find every last government record. It wouldn’t be consistent with our method. But, you know, assuming this, for example, might be an SG report, I certainly would have looked at it.
Q Next, is a -- an internal study from RJR Reynolds on whether smokers thought that cigarette
smoking in moderation was safe.
Have you looked at that poll?
A No. I see a response that says this was an unpublished 1970 study. So I wouldn’t have seen that one, I don’t believe.
Q But you could have gone and gotten the internal studies on whether people thought smoking in moderation was safe, had you chosen to go to some of the archives for tobacco documents; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I could have obtained the particular document that apparently Mr. Cummings found if -- you know, assuming that it existed. But, you know, I had so much other information which showed very consistently that people were being warned; that they heard those warnings; that they could repeat those warnings -- Victoria Waggoner could repeat the warning verbatim, for example,
40 years later.
So, you know, I had plenty of stuff really that was to me very clear from a historical point of view, from historical patterns.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q The next article is a report prepared for the Federal Trade Commission in May 1977 by Martin
Fishbein.
A I see this -- I see what you’re saying here. I don’t -- I don’t remember this particular report. I’m not sure where it appeared. Perhaps even you could tell me.
It’s not clear from this citation to me where it appeared. But apparently there was a Martin Fishbein who said that. But --Q Did you -A -- that’s not consistent, of course, with what I found.
Q Yeah. It isn’t.
If a report prepared by the -- for the Federal Trade Commission says that, quote: Almost 50 percent of all current smokers had not fully accepted the proposition that smoking cigarettes is dangerous to health -- that would be totally contrary to the conclusions you reached; right?
A Well, Mr. Nealey, I mean, as you were showing me yourself, there were these polls from much earlier which showed that more than half of smokers accepted the idea that it was related to lung cancer.
So, you know, as we can see, polls bounce around; one poll may say one thing; one may say
another. The trend of the polls always, though, was consistently one in which smokers were saying it was connected with a variety of kinds of disease.
So I don’t know why Dr. Martin Fishbein made the conclusion he did. It’s not consistent with the plethora of evidence that otherwise surrounds this topic. It’s true in -- that’s just simply true. Evidence can disagree, but when you sum it all up and look at it and in your own expert opinion you can conclude that, no, this is the most correct conclusion to come to, and I have.
Q When a report is prepared by the -- for the United States Federal Trade Commission, and it reaches a contrary conclusion to the one you’ve reached, is that a document you would have liked to have read and liked to have reviewed before rendering an opinion?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Not necessarily. It depends on what kind of document it was. I don’t know if it was an internal document.
I considered a variety of things which show that, you know, kinds of evidence which might seem to contradict and you have to take all the evidence together. If I missed one poll out of all
the others and it seems to suggest something else that’s different from every other poll, I’m not completely heartbroken that I haven’t seen it, since there seems to be quite a lot of other very reputable polling organizations have come to a different, including a lot of FTC reports, by the way.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And then the next citation that Dr. Cummings has to his own paper are smokers adequately informed about the health risk of smoking and a medical -- medicinal nicotine -- in 2004 -- did you ever read Dr. Cummings’ paper?
A No. As I told you, I’m not familiar with Dr. Cummings’ work. I suppose he’s not a historian, but I don’t know. I just have not heard his name before.
Q Okay.
And the next paragraph, Dr. Cummings cites a -- an article -- a peer-reviewed article -- from the American Journal of Public Health in 1996 by Cohen, J.B.
Have you ever read that?
A No. But -- boy, I sure disagree with the statement there, though. I mean, I just think it’s absurd, practically: The evidence from other recent
studies of smokers confirm that smokers continue to be misinformed about smoking, even today.
I mean, I think the polls say that
99	percent of people believe that smoking will give you lung cancer. So I cannot understand how he can make this sort of statement. I do see it, however.
Q Do you see any poll that says -- can you cite me any poll that says 99 percent of smokers at any time believed that smoking causes lung cancer?
A You know, I would have to just look at the polls again.
Right now, I’m thinking of youth polls.
And I honestly don’t recall now if they’re separated out by smokers or nonsmokers. But I do know the rates are 99 percent. It’s like insane it’s so high.
Q Going down on page 36, and two brief paragraphs down, Dr. Cummings cites an article from the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1999 by Azari and Cleary?
Do you see that?
A Yes, I do.
Q Did you find that peer-reviewed published article from JAMA? Did you ever read that?
A No. I generally don’t read the Journal of the American Medical Association. I have sometimes,
but it’s not part of my -- it’s not something I would have looked at.
Of course, keep in mind, this is also from 1995, which is past the period of time in which I believe any of the plaintiffs actually got lung cancer. So in this particular case, I probably would not have used this under any circumstances.
Q Well, if you have a peer-reviewed study of smoker attitudes that’s published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that says that as of 1995, between 30 and 40 percent of smokers didn’t acknowledge that they had a higher risk of heart disease or cancer from smoking, wouldn’t that be relevant to whether smokers were getting the message or not?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: It might or might not.
Honestly, again, this is his one- or two-sentence summary of that survey. I’d have to look at the survey to see how relevant it was. Even the phrasing here, "Smokers fail to acknowledge their average higher risk" -- you know, it may be that they said: Everybody else is at risk, but not me; because I exercise, and I eat right.
article to really tell.
But I do think it’s fairly pertinent. In the Waggoner, Pickett and Gollihue cases, this falls outside the period in which it would have been relevant to any of these particular smokers.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, is there a difference in perception of risk between the risk one generally thinks and the risk one thinks oneself is running?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, again, I can’t answer that as a psychologist would.
I can answer it only as a historian would, which is that people take risks. And for some reason, they are willing to do that. That happens a lot in history, or people wouldn’t invade other people’s countries. They do something they know is risky, and they do it. Why they do is something that is the matter of endless discussion.
MR. NEALEY: If the reporter could mark the next document -- materials Dr. Riddel reviewed as our next exhibit.
THE REPORTER: 14.
And off the record.
(Exhibit 14 marked)
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Have you ever seen this resource list before?
A No. I don’t know who Dr. Riddel is.
What’s his name, even? Or her name?
Dr. who? -- Riddel?
Sorry. Just don’t know.
Q Don’t know. Okay.
The articles on page 1 through 9, have you ever read any of them?
A No. No. I wouldn’t -- this is not -Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, the Journal of Health Economics are not -- things that have to do with the general public’s knowledge of smoking and the hazards. So I wouldn’t go to these to try to find out what Americans had seen, especially people like our plaintiffs who were not scientists.
Q Do you have any expertise in risk perception?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I have in the sense that we -- I just discussed it. I mean, how a historian would talk about risk, but not as a psychologist.
Not, you know -- I couldn’t do it the way that a brain scientist might, something like that -- or a neurologist. You know, I -BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Have you ever published -- done any research, or done any publication or any research in the area of risk perception?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. Not as a separate scientific discipline, I have not.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
And none of these articles on risk perception and risk analysis listed on Dr. Riddel’s list in 1 through 9 have you read; correct?
A Let me look at 1 through 9 very quickly
here.
Journal of Scottish Political Economy is one of ’em. Journal of Economics and Finance. American Journal of Agricultural Economics.
No. None of these are pertinent to me.
MR. WALKER: Scott, if I could just jump in, it looks like -- because there’s only one copy -are you asking about numbers 1 through 9, or did you say pages 1 through 9?
MR. WALKER: All right.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Did you read any of -- articles number 10 through 22?
A Journal of Marketing Research, The American Economic Review, Journal of Consumer Research, Psychology and Health -- no.
No, I wouldn’t have. These are all from the ’90s -- 2009.
Nope. None of these would have been part of my research. I doubt they would be part of any historian’s research, but, you know, they might. One or two of them might be.
Q Is it fair to say that you have no expertise and no information on the entire area of how risks as to health as it relates to smoking is perceived by smokers?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I don’t think that that’s fair. That’s probably too broad a characterization.
I don’t have -- I’m not an expert on risk evaluation or psychological processing of information or anything like that. But I can certainly testify
to the fact that people took risks; that they knew they were taking risks; they chose to do that.
We have even in the depositions many statements by plaintiffs and others that, for example, some people took the risk of smoking because they enjoyed smoking.
Now, going at a deeper level than that, trying to understand the cognitive processes at a sophisticated scientific level, I can’t.
But as a historian, my goodness, any historian could talk about the risks that people take -- calculated risks, often, but nonetheless, they choose to take them.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Looking at Dr. Riddel’s items numbered 23 to 35, do you read any of these?
A Oh, looks like the Gallup organization stuff, I probably would have read, or some of it. Again, it just depends on the particular one. These are pretty generically described.
It says, "Gallup Organization Trends in Public Attitudes." Although maybe that was the one you just showed me.
As you I’m sure know, that these headlines tend to repeat a lot because they’re talking about
Saturday Evening Post, I might have read that. That’s a Gallup organization one, too.
But here, things like Journal of Drug Issues: A survey Of Economic Models of Addictive Behavior. No, no, no, no, no. That’s not at all something I would have thought was pertinent or necessary.
Q And you have no knowledge on the area of how addiction affects perception of risks of smokers; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form. Asked and
answered.
THE WITNESS: I’m not a medical doctor, of course. I don’t pretend to be able to talk in any depths about perception and how addiction might affect that.
We certainly know that Ms. Waggoner quit cold when she got diagnosed with lung cancer.
So people do quit. Of course, she was one of 50 million smokers who did quit in that same period of time. So why one person processes the information in a way that’s different from somebody else, I don’t -- I can’t really quite answer it from a medical point of view.
From a historical point of view, I can say that people do perceive risk; they take risks; they make choices about them; and often they act to diminish their risk, but sometimes they don’t.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Did you read any of the articles on number 36 to 49 on Risk Assessment and Tobacco?
A Neighborhood Effects and Housing Demand is one of them. Consumer Demand in the United States. The Women More Risk-Averse -- no. These -- you know, some of these just really would be either redundant or outside my area. They’re fairly specialized scientific publications it appears from economists and other kinds of scholars with whom -- whose research I would not generally try to incorporate. Again, because I have plenty of information outside of that, that’s historical research and primary sources. And keep in mind, almost all of these -all of them, but almost all of these -- are secondary sources.
As I’ve tried to indicate, my emphasis is always on primary materials, not secondary ones.
Q Can you identify any articles of 50 through 62 that you’ve read in the area of risk perception and smoking?
A You know, somehow the Teenager Looks At Cigarette Smoking conducted for the American Cancer Society sounds familiar. I’d definitely have to look back at my ACS files to look at that. But that somehow looks -- again, American Cancer Society, that’s an organization that’s not only a public organization, but makes a big, big effort to publicize anything it gets. It’s not like an article in a scholarly journal that might have a very limited readership. So that’s something I would have been interested in, because the American Cancer Society might not only have done a poll, but they’d make a big effort to publicize it; whereas, these others are quite -- some of them seem quite rarified, like American Journal of Epidemiology, volume 152, I just wouldn’t have used. That’s also, I think, the year 2000. Again, that falls far outside our scope in this particular case.
Q This is all literature about risk perception and what smokers believed; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’m not sure it’s all on that, but, you know, it could be. I’d have to look back.
like agriculture or something. So I don’t know.
But, yes, it appears to be social scientific literature, secondary literature, on risk-taking behavior in general.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And you’re not an expert in risk-taking behavior; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’m not an expert on it in the sense of -- from a psychological or economic point of view or sociological point of view. I would just look at it as a historian does. But, again, that’s -- you know, it’s a very different way of looking at this kind of thing.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Looking at items number 63 to 7 6, do you read any of those?
A Yes. Actually number 65 is a book I’ve read. I actually own that book.
Q Okay.
Anything else?
A I’m sorry. I’m trying to get through it real quick.
Agricultural Economics Research, Journal of Law and Economics -- no. Nothing -- that’s the
Again, that’s -- that would be a general -- that’s what’s called a "trade book,” the one on the dread disease. So that’s something that would be written for the general public, unlike some of these specialized scholarly secondary sources.
Q Now, any of items 77 to 90 that you’ve
read?
A I’m reading it.
The Elasticity of Demand For Gambling -no. None of these are ones that I recognize.
Q Do you know who Paul Slavic is?
A No, I don’t.
Q Have you ever published in the area of risk perception regarding tobacco smoking?
A No. I haven’t published in the area of risk perception regarding tobacco smoking.
Q And you see the vast bulk of what I’ve been showing you on Ms. Riddel’s list are articles on the risk perception related to smoking; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I see four articles in which "Risk" is the title -- somewhere in the title, so I assume he’s a scientist of some sort who focuses on that.
Q You’re not a scientist who focuses on the area of how any individual would perceive the risk of cigarette smoking; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’m a historian. I’m not a scientist, as we would generally use that term.
There’s a science of history, you might say. And some people argue that it’s a social science, but I wouldn’t wish to portray myself as a hard scientist.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q When we look at items number 91 to 102, do you read any of those?
A It’s possible I would have seen that number 101, the Adult Use of Tobacco Survey. I may have seen a number of tobacco survey uses -- tobacco use surveys -- I’m sorry -- by the U.S. Department of Public Health. I don’t remember if I saw that one particularly.
I see -- yes. They also have Adult Use of Tobacco 1970, HEW. Probably saw some of those. Because, again, it’s slightly unclear to me, only because those may or may not have been done for the Surgeon General’s reports in those years. So
sometimes it gets wrapped into another document and makes it a little hard to identify.
Q Have you read any of items number 103 to
114?
A Yeah. I believe I’ve read the number 105, by Kip Viscusi.
I might have even read number 107, but I can’t recall that offhand.
But so those are -- of course, those are both what we would call "trade books." They’re books that are meant for a general, educated audience, not a highly specialized scholarly audience. So those ones jump out.
Q Now, if we go to the end of her reliance list, the last page, she cites various issues in the New York Times, Reader’s Digest, Newsweek, Life and Time -- and you have looked at each of those publications; is that correct?
A Yes. Yes, I have.
Q Now, it’s important to view actions by what people -- by the times in which they occurred; is that correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Historians always try to evaluate information historically, which means in the
MR. NEALEY: Well, in this case, looking at the Times literally rather than figuratively, if I can have the reporter mark two newspaper articles from the New York Times as our next exhibits, 15 and 16. And if the reporter would mark the 1957 article Exhibit 15.
(Exhibit 15 marked)
MR. NEALEY: And the 1959 article as Exhibit 16.
(Exhibit 16 marked)
THE WITNESS: You know, 20 minutes ago, we said: Do we need a break? And it’s been a little bit of a while now. Could I have a quick bathroom break?
MR. NEALEY: You can have a quick bathroom break. And if it makes you happy, I’m probably within about 10, 15 minutes of being done.
THE WITNESS: Thank you. I’ll be right
back.
THE REPORTER: Off the record.
(Off the record: 4:49 P.M.-4:52 P.M.)
MR. NEALEY: Back on the record.
BY MR. NEALEY:
York Times to be the nation’s paper of record in the 1950s, and ’60s and ’70s?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Oh, I don’t know. It’s certainly one of the most important.
Of course, that was a time period in which there were a lot of very strong newspapers. But I know the New York Times thinks of itself that way.
But there are also some other good strong ones: L.A. Times, Chicago, et cetera.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q But you would expect, as a historian, that if there was an issue that was being discussed in the public realm and information being provided, the New York Times would do a comprehensive and accurate reporting of that; correct?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I think they would attempt to. I think that other papers would, too. It would just depend. Sometimes one paper would be more fulsome on a topic than others.
I think they’re a good strong newspaper, if that’s what you mean. Whether they were the very best, I’d be more hesitant to weigh in on.
///
Q And this is an article from the New York Times in 1957 -- July of 1957, and it discusses a change in position of the official position of the U.S. Surgeon General regarding smoking.
Do you remember that change as the official position of the Surgeon General in the summer of 1957?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, there’s a little bit of a historical controversy about that, but the -- I’ve heard it said that the 1954 statement was actually pretty similar to the 1957 statement. Some people said that the 1954 statement wasn’t actually made; that the Surgeon General -- I think his name was Leonard Steele -- or Sheeley; maybe Sheeley -- at that time -- that he wrote it up in his papers, but he didn’t actually announce it.
But then later on, people would go back and refer to it as if he actually had announced it but he hadn’t. And this is kind of a little eddy here. It’s not highly interesting. But I don’t think there was a big change in their point of view from 1954 to 1957.
second paragraph; that in 1954, there was evidence of a statistical association, but left open the question of cause and effect.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Well, was the New York Times writing in 1957 -- were they wrong about the Surgeon General issuing a statement -- an official pronouncement in 1954?
A Well, honestly, some historians would say that they were wrong; that the pronouncement actually wasn’t made official. But it’s kind of a small matter of debate. But I think the New York Times might have it slightly wrong, actually.
Q So when they are citing the new report and new position in 1957 and they publish all across the country that this was a change in position from 1954, if the Public Health Service thought that the New York Times was just wrong, don’t you think that they would have written the New York Times or contacted the New York Times and said: No, no, no, no. We never really issued that 1954 statement; it doesn’t exist?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form. Argumentative. Calls for speculation.
they would have done. I’d have to speculate on why they did or didn’t take it.
I mean, keep in mind, these were different surgeon generals. One person doesn’t remember exactly what another person says.
It seems to me the emphasis of this article, however, as it says in the headline is that the U.S. links cancer with cigarettes. So they were trying to make the point that the evidence is increasingly strong. That’s what it seems to me that they’re saying in this. Again, of course, I’m reading it really quickly because I just got it.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q You’ve read this before, haven’t you,
Dr. Hoffman?
A I may well have read it. I think I have, but it’s been a long time. And, you know, I’d have to really get at it fully. I’d have to reread it, because I’ve read so many things. And it’s also very tiny print.
Q You went through the New York Times. You certainly would have pulled out an article on the official position of the Surgeon General of the United States, when you went through the New York Times; right, Doctor?
THE WITNESS: Yes. I would have definitely been looking for this, of course, because it was covered very widely and heavily throughout the country, including all three places where the plaintiffs lived or the decedents.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And, Doctor, the change in position, according to the New York Times is to, quote, "Increasing and consistent evidence existed that," quote, "’excessive cigarette smoking is one of the causative factors of lung cancer’"; right?
A Yes. That’s what it says.
Q So the official position of the Surgeon General as of the summer of 1957 was that excessive cigarette smoking may be one of the causes of lung cancer; right?
A No. They said "is," not "may be."
Q And, actually, they didn’t say that excessive cigarette smoking is one of the causative factors of lung cancer; they said that there was increasing and consistent evidence that excessive cigarette smoking is one of the causative factors of lung cancer; right?
THE WITNESS: It sounds to me like you’re quoting the first sentence of the article. And, yes, that’s right. That sounds right to me.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q Okay.
Now, what is "excessive smoking"?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: They don’t specify that
here.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q In 1957, was it the official position of the U.S. Surgeon General that smoking in any amount causes lung cancer?
A No. I don’t think that would be their position today, either.
Smoking one cigarette in your lifetime would not -- has never been -- that I’ve ever heard -- been put forward as a cause of lung cancer. So it’s a dose relationship. You have to do enough of it over enough period of years for it to have that potential consequence.
Q And the official position of the Public Health Service, up until 1964 was that there was increasing and consistent evidence that excessive cigarette smoking was one of the causative factors of
lung cancer; right?
A Well, yes, because they always pointed out there are some people who are nonsmokers who also get lung cancer, but it’s just a very tiny percent. It’s generally smokers who get lung cancer.
So, you know, a newspaper article, of course, is always a distillation and is generally shorter than a long and official report. So in these -- they would generally make the point that it’s one of the causes of lung cancer without giving extensive explanations of other potential causes.
Q And this is what the public would have gotten. The public wasn’t reading the official statement of the Surgeon General issued in June of 1957; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, the public, of course, would have gotten not just this; they would have gotten lots of other things as well. You know, they would have gotten things from schools, like the every-pupil test, which in 1958-’59 asked Ohio students, like Mr. Gollihue, to equate the terms: "Cigarette smoking is a cause of ’blank’ lung cancer."
then or now. But this would have been one piece of the larger body of information that people like the plaintiffs would have gotten.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q This reflects the official position of the Surgeon General until January of 1965; correct?
A No.
Q Well, the official position of the Surgeon General up until 1965 -- from this point in ’57 to 1965 -- was that there was increasing and consistent evidence that excessive cigarette smoking is one of the causative factors of lung cancer; correct?
A Well, I’m a little baffled, because I don’t know why you keep saying 1965.
Q Sorry. 1964. I misspoke.
A Oh. Okay. That’s fine. I wasn’t sure.
Q So the official position from January -- I mean from July of 1957 until January of 1964 of the Surgeon General was as the New York Times has put it that: There was increasing and consistent evidence that excessive cigarette smoking is one of the causative factors of lung cancer; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, it’s exactly as you read it. That’s one of the statements that’s being
made.
And, yes, people were being warned that it was a scary thing; that there was consistent and increasing evidence. Of course, in medical science, things are always understood with greater and greater precision, at least we hope so over time.
In 1964, of course, what happens is the federal government takes more than 3,000 studies, and puts them all together and creates this product for the general public. But, you know, they were warning, you know, vociferously for a decade or more before that.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And when we’re looking at the historical record and the information through the lens when it was given, if we look at Exhibit 16, this is also an article from the New York Times of December 11th, 1959. And you would have run across this, I take it?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Yeah. I probably would have. I can’t remember by title every article I’ve read.
In the Los Angeles Times alone, there are more than 2,200 articles. So just to explain to you why I won’t necessarily, immediately recognize
something every single time. I have to go back to the records.
Let’s see. "Burney Disputed on Cancer Study, AMA Questions Report" -BY MR. NEALEY:
Q The "AMA" is the American Medical Association; right?
A Yes. That’s correct.
Q It’s the organization of American doctors questioning a report that listed smoking as the main factor in lung disease; right?
A Again, I’m trying to dash through it.
Just give me a moment to read it; okay?
Okay. Thank you. Now I have it. So go
ahead.
Q This is the kind of information that was available to smokers and nonsmokers in 1959; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, it would have -certainly some people who got the New York Times would have read this.
Keep in mind, a magazine like the New York Times -- or pardon me, a newspaper like the New York Times would have a more voluminous coverage.
that in the Vilas County News-Review that -- you know, the newspaper I read -- in the Waggoner case.
So this would have been a story absolutely out there. It wouldn’t have been the main story. It would probably have been -- there would have been far more coverage of the warnings in 1957, and 1959 and 1964 than there would have been about the scientific debate.
But certainly, yes. I mean, you’re seeing it right here. "JAMA," as it’s often called, was questioning as to whether they had all of the information that they needed to make as they put it kind of an all-or-nothing authoritative position. So these particular medical doctors were saying: We want more kinds of evidence. And, you know, that is how medicine works. There is a lot of back-and-forth on, you know, how exactly disease unfolds.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And so the official Journal of the American Medical Association in 1959 was saying that there was insufficient evidence to warrant the assumption that cigarette smoking was the principal factor in the increase in lung cancer; right?
A Well, they are saying just what they said in the article.
Of course, we know that this is -- not everything people read. We also know that the polls are showing that Americans, as a group, seem to be believers to a greater extent than the Journal of the American Medical Association. But also the Journal of the American Medical Association says -- what is it -- five years later that the association between smoking and lung cancer is so well-known that you don’t even need to put warnings on the pack.
So it’s -- you know, like most people that are saying slightly different things at different times. But they certainly knew that Americans had been warned about it, ’cause they felt that they had been warned so extensively that any further warning would be redundant.
Q And the article says that the American Medical Association disputed the Surgeon General in his conclusion that heavy smokers are more prone to lung cancer than other people; right?
A Okay. Let’s see. They were restating the issue whether or not this is really it or not.
’Cause they were saying that there are some other factors -- and keep in mind, you know, there was a debate to some extent about what kinds of evidence or -- are conclusive. The statistical evidence --
must you reproduce something in a test tube in the lab?
And doctors did tend to prefer, for a long time, the sort of test-tube kinds of evidence.
But that happens, of course, in 1964; is that Luther Terry says: Nope. We’re going to now believe statistical evidence -- because they felt it was so compelling. But the AMA is obviously pronouncing somewhat of a disputing point of view there.
Q And if you’re a smoker, and you’re smoking in 1959 and you read these articles, you could feel pretty comfortable that, as long as you were not excessively smoking or a heavy smoker, then this really just didn’t apply to you; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: No, I don’t think so.
Because, keep in mind, they’re just talking here also about lung cancer. And 7 0 percent of Americans five years before this said that smoking was hazardous to your health. So they would -- you know, obviously, different people might be more concerned about one kind of hazard than another.
But, no, I don’t think so. People who -as one of the deponents said: We didn’t call them
coffin nails for nothing -- and this was a woman who was Victoria Waggoner’s sister-in-law.
Again, we have to look at the whole range of evidence. If you took just this one article and I built my entire case on one article, or you built your entire case on one article, then I think that we should look again at our sources.
It seems to me quite clear that Americans believe that smoking was addictive, it was seriously habit-forming, that it could enslave you. They believed it was dangerous. They thought it was another nail in your coffin.
The same period of time, earlier than this -- early around 1955, slang dictionary showed that people started to use the word "cancer stick."
There’s so much evidence, Mr. Nealey, that points in the direction of people understanding that this was a grave hazard; that this kind of article, I don’t think, substantively reveals anything any different.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And this article, if one read it and one were a smoker, one could feel safe in the knowledge that, while the Surgeon General was saying that heavy smoking was a principal factor in the increase of
lung cancer, that the American Medical Association said that that hadn’t been shown; right?
MR. WALKER: Objection to form. Asked and
answered.
THE WITNESS: Yeah. That’s kind of speculative. But I honestly think if anybody gets a warning from the Surgeon General that -- you know, if my life were on the line, I’d be taking it very seriously.
But, you know, people have different ways of looking at things. Certainly people were being warned and they knew that the warning had been issued.
In fact, this is a way in which the Surgeon General’s warning gets a second life.
Because if you didn’t read the article about the Surgeon General Burney’s warning two days earlier, you now are reading about it again.
BY MR. NEALEY:
Q And this wasn’t just in the New York Times; this is an AP article; this is a wire-service article; right?
A Yes, that’s correct.
Q And so this article could have been printed any place in the United States; is that
THE WITNESS: Well, it might have been. I mean, some newspapers subscribed to AP, and some subscribed to UPI and some did not subscribe at all. But certainly since it comes out over a wire service, it would go beyond New York, for example.
In fact, even the city where the story was filed tells you that somebody in Chicago probably read it as well.
MR. NEALEY: Okay. I have no further
questions.
Thank you very much, Doctor.
THE WITNESS: Thank you, Mr. Nealey.
MR. WALKER: I have no questions.
MR. NEALEY: Okay.
MR. FOWLER: This is Greg Fowler. I have no questions at this time, either.
