EXAMINATION
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
Q.
on time.
Thank you.
Thank you, everyone, for being
I think I was the last one here.
Good morning, Dr. English.
9
A. Good morning, Mr. Surprenant.
Q. Philip Morris has retained you as an expert
medical historian in this case; is that correct?
10 A. That is correct.
11 Q. And as -- I noticed in your report --
12
strike that.
13
Now, you know, as a medical historian, that
14 smoking is the leading cause of illness, disease and
15 death in the United States, correct?
16
A.
As a physician I know that as well as a
17 historian of medicine, it's a leading cause of death,
1 8 yes
19
20
Q.
And as a medical historian I notice --
well, strike that.
21
I notice in your report you cite a number of
22 times to statistics and conclusions from the American
23 Cancer Society; is that correct?
24
A.
I do, yes.

3990547415Page 8
1 Q. And what is the American Cancer Society?
2 A. It's a voluntary public group that is
3 interested in promoting research, public education,
4 and lobbying for cancer in this country.
5
Q.
Okay.
And, as a medical historian, do you
6 regard the American Cancer Society as a reliable
7 source of information?
8 MR. ROSENTHAL:
9 THE WITNESS:
10
Objection to form.
Reliable in what sense?
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
11
Q.
Well, do you regard, as a medical
12 historian, their conclusions about the link between
13 cigarette smoking and illness as reliable?
14
A.
Well, you know, as a medical historian, I've
15 actually gone through the American Cancer Society's
16 annual reports for, oh, for 60, 70 years, and so they
17 have had a lot of conclusions about the risks of
18 smoking, especially for cancer.
19
So I would have to know the date, but I
20 do -- I think the American Cancer Society is a very,
21 you know, respectable organization.
22 you know, there are three missions of education,
23 research, and lobbying, you know, forefront.
24
Q.
Okay.
It's always had,
Now, on its current website that you

1 could go on and look at today the American Cancer
2 Society reports that, on an annual basis,
3 approximately 443,600 people in the United States died
4 from illnesses relating to cigarette smoking.
5 agree or disagree?
6
A.
Do you
I have no way of independently verifying
7 that one way or the other, but, you know, I'll take
8 what the American Cancer Society says.
9
Q.
And it says that smoking kills more
10 Americans than alcohol, car accidents, suicide, AIDS,
11 homicides and illegal drugs combined.
12 approximately correct to you as a medical historian?
13
A.
Does that sound
Well, of course, you're talking about 2010,
14 so that really wouldn't be my role as a historian, but
15 in 2010, I think that those numbers would be, you
16 know, in the ballpark.
17
Q.
18
Now, before smoking, I mean —
strike that.
This is my first deposition in this case,
19 Dr. English, and this case has been going on a number
20 of years.
21 in late in a case, I always feel as if I'm speaking a
22 foreign language that I haven't quite mastered.
23
24
A.
And when I, as a lawyer, kind of parachute
Well, this is my first deposition in this
case as well.

1
Q.
Yes, but you have had similar depositions
2 before.
So I will try to make my questions as
3 coherent as possible.
4
The American Cancer Society points out that,
5 not only does smoking cause death, but it also can
6 significantly harm a smoker's quality of life while
7 the smoker is alive.
8
9
A.
Again, we're talking about do I personally
agree with that or are we talking --
10
11
Do you agree with that?
Q.
As a medical historian do you have a view
on that?
12
A.
Well, again, you know, a historian looks at
13 things over time and you're asking a question about a
14 2010 website.
15 is that I would tend to agree with the American Cancer
16 Society's view on that in 2010, yes.
17
Q.
So I think the way I would answer that
Now, there is something that I didn't
18 understand until I got on this case, which was --
19 other than in a very general way —
20 secondhand smoke?
21
A.
but what is
Secondhand smoke, it's the —
firsthand
22 smoke is what a smoker gets through the cigarette
23 itself.
24 part of secondhand smoke.
And then when the smoker exhales, that is
And then there is also a

1 component of secondhand smoke that is being burned at
2 the cigarette that doesn't actually get inhaled in the
3 smoker in the first place.
4 components of it.
So there are two
5 Q. Out of either end, as it were.
6 A. Well, one -- yeah, but one end also goes
7
through the smoker first.
8
9
Q.
Okay.
Now, the American Cancer Society
reports that on an annual basis 4,600 —
46,000 --
10 nonsmokers died from heart disease due to secondhand
11 smoke.
12 correct to you?
13 A.
Does that -- does that sound approximately
Well, I'm not sure about that.
I think that
14 there has been a long sort of historical controversy
15 about how those numbers -- that particular -- those
16 particular numbers are calculated.
17 have an opinion about that.
18 representation that that's what the website says, but
19 I'm not sure that I'm as comfortable with that number
20 as maybe some others.
21
Q.
Okay.
So I'm not sure I
I mean, I'll take your
I understand that, Dr. English.
22 Let's see what we can agree on.
Without tying you to
23 a specific number, even a general number, it is the
24 case -- is it the case -- that secondhand smoke kills

3990547419Page 12
1 thousands, if not tens of thousands, of Americans a
2 year who themselves are not smokers?
3 A. I'm not sure I have an opinion on that.
4 Q. Okay.
Would you agree with the American
5 Cancer Society that children are especially sensitive
6 to secondhand smoke?
7
A.
I would —
I'm not exactly sure where the
8 Cancer Society is getting that, but I would say, as a
9 pediatrician, that I would agree with that.
10
11
Q.
Okay.
And you no longer are an active
practicing physician; is that correct?
12 A. That's correct.
13 Q. You retired from that in 2005?
14 A. That's correct.
15 Q. But for a number of years you had an
16
active, how do you say it, pediatric practice?
17 A. Yes, about 30 years.
18 Q. And you treated children to young
19
teenagers?
20
A.
Well, actually I began in the prenatal visit
21 and then I would pass my patient on to another
22 physician when they graduated from college.
23
24
Q.
Okay.
And smoking is a problem in youths;
underaged smoking is a problem, correct?

3990547420Page 13
1 A. It is.
2 Q. And approximately 1 in 5 smokers begin
3
smoking in high school?
4
5
A.
that would -- that sounds about right.
6
7
Q.
And would you agree that, as a general
matter -- well, strike that.
8
9
I'm not sure what the current number is, but
Do you agree that nicotine and cigarette
smoking are addictive?
10 A. Well, are you asking me as a physician?
11 Q. Sure.
12 A. Yes.
I mean, and the reason I make a
13 distinction is that there is actually a long history
14 of how the public health community has viewed nicotine
15 and the addicting qualities of it, but —
16 there is a little different because in one I have a
17 historical perspective, but if you're asking me in
18 2010, as a pediatrician, do I think nicotine is
19 addicting, yes, I do.
20
Q.
Okay.
so my answer
And let me follow, kind of take a
21 segue from where I was going and try to understand the
22 distinction you were just making, Dr. English.
23 is your view as a medical historian as to whether or
24 not cigarette smoking and nicotine are addictive?
What
If

3990547421Page 14
1
that is different from your views as a pediatrician.
2
A.
Yeah.
I mean, I think that physicians and
3 the public health authorities always understood that
4 cigarette smoking was hard to quit.
5 very long time they have thought that nicotine was the
6 substance within cigarettes that was -- was largely
7 responsible.
8 you -- how do you define this, whether it's dependency
9 or -- how do you define this relationship between
And I think for a
But when it came down to actually how do
10 nicotine and humans smoking, there the public health
11 community has had sort of a long history on how they
12 describe it.
13
So, for example, in the first Surgeon
14 General's Report there is a whole chapter that
15 addresses the question of whether this particular
16 group of experts in 196 4 thought that cigarette
17 smoking was addictive.
18 looked up definitions of addiction, which were based
19 on the World Health Organization, and they said they
20 didn't think so.
21 that cigarette smoking was hard to quit.
22 deny that nicotine was the chemical that was
23 important, but when it came —
24 their definition did not include the word "addiction."
They -- what they did was they
I mean, it wasn't that they denied
They didn't
when push came to shove

3390547422
Source: http://industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/fpkl0190
3990547422Page 15
1
They used the word "habituation."
2
Well, since then, the World Health
3 Organization has moved in its definitions of
4 addictions and the Surgeon General has moved in its --
5 I'm using "its" even because it's really a consortium
6 of people -- but in its definition, they reviewed
7 addiction in 1979, and it's really sort of a divided
8 opinion that some people think it was more of a social
9 habit, more people thought it was a straight-up
10 nicotine addiction.
11 They reviewed it again in 1988, and then they
12 emphatically said that they thought that nicotine was
13 an addiction.
14
Q.
There is back and forth on that.
And when would you say there was a medical
15 consensus that nicotine was an addiction, it was an
16 addictive drug?
17 A.
It's hard actually to put a date, I think,
18 precisely on that.
I mean, certainly by —
I think
19 most people would have said by 1988 there certainly
20 were people who were doing research in, you know,
21 especially in compensation about when, you know, when
22 a smoker moves from a higher to a lower nicotine
23 cigarette.
24 thought in the '70s that nicotine was an addictive

substance.
2
So I think it's hard to actually pin down a
3 precise moment when -- but that's how public health
4 consensuses are.
5 when that happens.
6 of that.
7
Q.
Often it is not a precise moment
But I think there was a spectrum
Would you agree that the younger a smoker
8 starts as a general matter, the more that -- the more
9 addictive -- strike that.
10
Would you agree as a general matter that the
11 younger the smoker starts smoking the harder it will
12 be for that smoker to quit because of his or her
13 addiction to nicotine?
14
A.
I really don't have a professional opinion
15 on that, I mean, and either as a historian or as a
16 pediatrician.
17 my patients who were smokers stopped and in fact
18 probably most of them stopped at some point.
19 but I don't have -- I don't have an opinion about
20 whether a younger smoker has a more difficult time
21 with that or not.
22 Q.
I do know in my practice that some of

So --
Now, are you aware of survey data

24 were in high school we all thought we were

invulnerable and did some really stupid things.
2
A.
I'm not sure I ever thought that, but I know
3 people use that expression, but at least my dealing
4 with teenagers they are beset with vulnerabilities,
5 maybe unrealistic ones --
6
Q.
Well, they are.
They are.
But the point
7 is, is that, are you aware of a survey that a large
8 number of smokers in high school, underaged smokers,
9 believed that in five years they will be able to quit
10 smoking, and, in fact, the vast majority are addicted
11 smokers seven to nine years later?
12
13
A.
I'm not
aware of those numbers.
14
15
I don't have an opinion on that.
Q.
Now, you're teaching a class this spring
called "Chubby History"?
16 A. I am.
17 Q. And I looked at the synopsis, and I think
18 you said that many public health officials believe
19 that obesity is the second most important public
20 health problem after smoking.
21 A. I do say that.
22 Q. And so do I -- I think I correctly inferred
23 that it is your belief, as a historian, that today
24 cigarette smoking is the most important public health

problem.

3
A.
It's certainly right up there as an
important public health problem.
4
Q.
And Philip Morris, am I correct, that it is
5 far and away the leading cigarette manufacturer by
6 market share in the United States?
7 A.
8 share is.
9 Q.
I don't know what Philip Morris's market

10 are caused by smoking that we've reviewed, it is your

Q.
Okay.
Dr. English, I will get back to what
2 you're an expert in, the scope of your expertise, what
3 you know about Philip Morris specifically, but let's
4 go back to 1988.
5
6
In 1988 you were a professor and a
practicing pediatrician at Duke?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. Okay.
9
And you were approached by a lawyer
named Murray Granick
[sic] of this firm, correct?
10 A. Garnick, G-A-R-N-I-C-K.
11 Q. And Mr. Garnick at that time was involved
12
in defending Philip Morris in litigation, right?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. And he was also involved in defending the
15 lead industry against cases of claims of lead
16 poisoning, correct?
17
A.
He was in the same firm with lawyers who
18 defended lead.
19 work in lead, but, anyway, he was knowledgeable.
20
Q.
I'm not sure whether he did a lot of
And you ended up being retained as a
21 medical historian expert by the lead industry,
22 correct?
23 A. Yes, somewhat later in the mid '90s.
24 Q. And the substance of your testimony in the
Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.

3390547435

3990547435Page 28
1 lead poisoning cases was that the things that
2 plaintiffs were complaining about were publicly known;
3 is that correct?
4 A.
Well, we'd have to go —
I mean, that's a
5 very complicated set of cases, and they are all
6 different.
7
So do you have a particular case in mind?
I mean, my general task in that was that the
8 history of the evolution of knowledge about the
9 dangers of lead poisoning, and then the public health
10 communities' responses about what the —
11 Americans should do to lessen that.
12 general, and that's really the same general task that
13 I've taken in the case like this one today dealing
14 with low-tar cigarettes is generally the accumulation
15 of knowledge about the risks of smoking and what the
16 public health community has recommended to do about
17 that.
18
19
Q.
Okay.
what
But that's, in

Mr. Garnick.
20 A. Garnick.

issues?

1 of knowledge about the dangers of smoking and what the
2 public health community advised it to do about that up
3 through the publication of the first Surgeon General's
4 Report in 1964.
5
6
Q.
So your research from —
and you worked on
it for about two years, correct?
7 A. About that, yes.
8 Q. And you never prepared a report.
9 A. I don't think there was ever a report
10 prepared. I know I didn't prepare a report, no.
11 Q.
And am I correct in understanding your
12 previous deposition testimony that you weren't
13 retained for a specific case or at least it never
14 evolved into that?
15
A.
Well, I think there was a case, the Haines
16 case, which was ongoing, and I hear that it may still
17 be ongoing, you know, decades later, but I think it
18 was in the -- the possibility that that case might go
19 forward was why I was retained, but, more generally,
20 it was a more open-ended type of assignment.
21
Q.
And so you were studying the public health
22 community's positions on smoking and the dangers of
23 smoking from when through 1964?
24
A.
Roughly 20th century.

Q.
Okay.
And one thing I hadn't learned, I
2 hadn't understood until this case, am I correct that
3 cigarette smoking is really a phenomenon of the last
4 century, in other words, there's very little cigarette
5 smoking before the 21st century?
6
7
A.
10
It's mostly
1880 ' s onward.
8
9
Machine-rolled cigarettes, yes.
Q.
And prior to that time obviously tobacco as
a product of the New World and Europeans used tobacco
then from the 1500's was principally cigars and pipes?
11
A.
Or they —
yeah.
In categories that -- or
12 chewing -- that we would probably list as cigars,
13 sometimes they were wrapped in paper, but mostly what
14 we would call cigars, pipes and chewing.
15
Q. A cigar is tobacco wrapped in tobacco
17 A. That's my understanding.
18 Q. Okay.

leaves?
And then you worked for about two
19 years, and then what happened, did Mr. Garnick just
20 tell you to stop or what happened?
21
A.
Yeah, that's about -- I mean, between then
22 and the late '90s occasionally we would have a
23 conversation, but I don't think I did any substantive
24 research between that time.

9 that case was in 2001.

11

12 Philip Morris or Philip Morris and other tobacco
13 companies or other tobacco companies on a number of
14 occasions, correct?

4 communications --

as opposed to the
7 existence of the communications.
8 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
9
Q.
Right.
Now let me try to get at it this
10 way.
11 Mr. Rosenthal, what was your understanding of your
12 assignment?
13
After talking with Mr. Lombardi and
A.
That it would be similar to what I had done
14 in Miles-Price in that I would be looking at
15 particularly how the public health community viewed
16 and supported the development of low-tar cigarettes
17 from, you know, roughly the middle of the 20th century
18 and to the end.
19
So in that case it would be really no
20 different from Miles-Price, but there have been eight
21 years or so since then and there have been some
22 developments and that I would in some measure extend
23 chronologically the scope of the report.
24

how the class is defined?
2
A.
I believe the class is defined as all
3 citizens of the state of Missouri who purchased and
4 smoked Marlboro Light cigarettes for a period of five
5 years, and I think the dates are roughly 1995 to 2000,
6 but I could be off by a year or so.

5 largely duped and revised it, and then added
6 discussion to bring it up to the present; is that

8
9
A.
and filed in a number of cases,
I'm not sure what you mean by the word
"duped."
MR. ROSENTHAL:
10
11
You took a report that had been filed --
I was going to object to
form too.
12
THE WITNESS:
By that, but, yes, I took that
13 form of that report as a base and then I made some
14 modifications to it, yes.
15 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
16
Q.
I didn't realize "duped" can have very
17 different meanings.
18 I was using it in the shorthand phrase of duplicate
19 and revise.
20
Duped can mean to trick someone.
So it's largely -- your present report is
21 largely a report that you prepared in other cases that
22 largely is repeated here and then you've brought it up
23 to the present; is that correct?

More or less, yes.

Q.

Let me try to now move to a question
4 to asking you about how you, as a medical historian,
5 go about practicing your expertise.
6 you -- have you read Professor Greenwood's report in
7 this case?
8 A. No.
9 Q. She is also a historian.
And I'll tell
The scope of her
10 report is more aimed at information that was addressed
11 to the public as opposed to the public health
12 community, but she had a section which I noticed yours
13 didn't that talks about what the historical method is.
14 And I was going to ask you if you proceed as does
15 Professor Greenwood.
16
She said the historical method -- let me
17 just ask without reference to Professor Greenwood.
Do
18 you agree that the historical method generally follows
19 the mode of the scientific method?
20 A. I'm not sure what she means by that.
21 Q. Okay.
22 A. Maybe she defines it in the next sentence.
23 Q. Okay.
24

Do you agree there are four steps to the
2 historical method?
One, the formulation of a research
3 question; two, searching out a wide variety of sources
4 that provide evidence to help answer the research
5 question; the review and analysis of the sources and
6 the development of a working hypothesis; and then,
7 finally, reaching conclusions based on sources.
8 you generally agree?
Do
9 A. In general, yes.
10 Q. Your expert report contains a number of
11 conclusions, but it doesn't identify what the research
12 question or questions were that you were addressing.
13 What were they?
14 A.
They were how the public health community
15 evaluated low-tar cigarettes as a public health
16 response to the knowledge that smoking cigarettes
17 causes diseases and kills.
18 did they base their judgments that low-tar cigarettes
19 provided a reduced risk.
20 they go about informing the public about their
21 conclusions about low-tar cigarettes.

2 A. Sure.
3 Q. Now, would you agree, with respect to --
4 that the historical inquiry has to appropriately frame
5 the -- the research question, correct?
6
A.
Yes.
I mean, we might have a discussion
7 on -- given the topic -- what the appropriate question
8 is, what the word "appropriate" meant, but, yes, I
9 think so, yes.
10
Q.
Okay.
Let me try.
I was trying to come up
11 with a couple of examples what I, as a lawyer, perhaps
12 using lawyer terminology, would say -- well, let me
13 just ask the question.
14
In the following hypothetical example, in
15 your view would the historian have committed a
16 mistake, and, if so, what kind of mistake?
17 a historian, a graduate student, Ph.D. candidate, said
18 that he wanted to study whether American slaves were
19 happy with their status as slaves or detested their
20 status as slaves, but he was only going to look at
21 slave owners' accounts of that issue and no other
22 data.
23 owners said about whether they viewed their slaves as
24 being happy or not.
Okay?
Let's say
So he was going to read what slave

3390547460
Source: http://industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/fpkl0190
3990547460Page 53
1
2
Would t h a t be a mistake in the h i s t o r i c a l
method?
3
A.
Well, I think this is where we get to the
4 idea of what is the appropriate question.
If the
5 question is what were the perceptions of slave owners
6 about their slaves' happiness or not, then the source
7 material would appropriately look at slave owners.
8 Q. Okay.
9 A. If the question was, irrespective of what
10 slave owners said, what did slaves think about this
11 institution, then the appropriate sources would be
12 different.
13
Q.
And so the way you would -- and let's say
14 it was the second, that the candidate said, I really
15 want to find out whether American slaves prior to the
16 abolition of slavery were happy with their status, and
17 I think the only source that I'm going to look at is
18 what slave owners said.
19 mistake that that hypothetical historian would have
20 made, how would you describe it?
21
A.
I take it that that, the
Well, I mean, it depends.
And, again, you
22 have to get into the actual research because I would
23 imagine that some slave owners might actually be more
24 sensitive to what their slaves felt.
So you'd have to

3390547461

399054746Page 54
1 look at the source to see whether it was an
2 appropriate one or not.
3
This, of course, gets me very far afield
4 from medical history, so I'm not exactly sure what all
5 the available sources would be for slave narratives.
6 I know people spend their whole lives on slave
7 narratives, but I think there is a body of primary
8 sources of slaves and their recollections of slavery
9 that they probably would draw on.
10
Q.
So would it be fair to say that in my
11 hypothetical the historian erred at least in part by
12 only reviewing a narrow and likely suspect body of
13 evidence?
14 A.
Again, you know, I don't want —
you chose a
15 specific example there, and I don't necessarily know
16 if I can answer because I don't know that particular
17 field.
18 historian, you know, understand the sources that he or
19 she is dealing with and make the best out of the
20 materials that are available.
21
I think it would be important that the
Q.
Okay.

24 mistake in the practice of history, and ask you about

it.

In my hypothetical, the Ph.D. candidate
3 says, I have a remarkable thesis that anti-Semitism in
4 Poland between 1939 and 1945 under the Nazi regime was
5 almost completely wiped out.
6 anti-Semitism in Poland in 1945.

There was a lot of

made?

10 historian on what Philip Morris knew about the

18 re-ask it.
19 While you may be aware of some
20 communications that Philip Morris made to the public
21 health community on the topic of Light cigarettes, you
22 have not done a systematic study sufficient to form
23 expert opinions on that topic, correct?

You have no expert opinion on how Marlboro
6 Light smokers understood "Light" in Marlboro Light,

If you take, go back to the psychological

MR. ROSENTHAL:
Just as a preliminary
14 matter, I have a foundational objection, I think, to
15 any questioning based on this because it does not
16 provide sufficient information, such as the year in

So the reason -- really the reason
5 that I -- to go to a question I asked a little while
6 ago, and to continue to try to kind of research, I
7 mean, refine this issue of the difference between
8 available -- information that was available and how
9 that information was understood from a historical
10 point of view, you have no expert opinion on how a

A.

You are not an expert in surveys.
I don't take surveys.

11 know how to interpret them, depends on the survey, I
12 guess, but I don't take surveys, no.

14 you wouldn't have expertise to determine independently
15 whether that survey was reliable or unreliable,

What I would probably do, because certainly
18 that would cross my mind would be, if I knew something
19 about the organization taking the survey.
20 it was a Gallup organization survey, for example, I
21 would probably think that that would be -- would

2 asking -- I take it, as an expert medical historian,
3 you do not have the training or experience to
4 independently reach an expert conclusion as to whether
5 any particular survey is reliable or unreliable.
6 A. I think that's fair.
7 Q. Okay.
8
Same question with respect to
polling.
9
A.
Again, I read polls and I would, you know,
10 defer to the organization producing the poll, but I
11 don't take -- I mean, I don't actually conduct polls.

Q.
And you, as an expert medical historian, do
13 not have the training or background necessary to reach

5 information about -- to avoid cognitive dissonance on
6 the notion that I know tobacco smoking could kill me
7 and yet I smoke cigarettes?
8
9
A.
No.
I mean, I think the question is
complex, like what do I -- you know, who are the
10 smokers in question, but I think my answer would be --
11 would be no.
12
Q.
Let me kind of take a detour here from
13 medical historian expertise.
14 your pediatric practice, did you ever have discussions
15 with your patients about, doctor, I know I smoke
16 cigarettes and I know cigarettes can kill me, but I
17 smoke them anyway, where you just anecdotally learned
18 information about how smokers deal with that cognitive
19 dissonance?

A.
When you were active in
Well, as a general rule, I talk to my
21 patients about smoking beginning with a prenatal visit
22 and then with the actual patient every year at their
23 annual physical from prekindergarten up until the last
24 time I saw them.

2 part of that, to get more directly to your question,
3 as part of that occasionally there would be an
4 adolescent who smoked.
5 that, but it would be anecdotal in the sense that it
6 would be based on relatively few visits.

Okay.
And, as
So I have a little sense of
Prenatal, you mean you began -- what
does "prenatal" mean?
9
A.
It means that the pregnant woman and her
10 partner come in and talk about whether I'm going to be
11 their pediatrician afterward, any particular advice I
12 would have about especially the parents' behavior
13 before the baby is born.

it's important not to smoke cigarettes.

6 that, they have not permitted those kinds of
7 descriptors.

9
Q.
And do you have an opinion as a medical
historian what caused the EU to prohibit the "Light"
10 designation on Light cigarettes such as Marlboro
11 Light?
12
A.
I don't.
I haven't done enough research in
13 there to know.
14 conferences on it, but I haven't read that.
15
16
Q.
I mean, I am sure they probably had
Am I correct that shortly in the United
States the "Light" term will be prohibited?
17
A.
My understanding of the law by the FDA is
18 that those terms cannot be used until the FDA gives
19 approval of them.
2 0 Q.
And do you have a view whether the
21 designation "Light" cigarettes has an inherent
22 tendency to communicate to potential or actual smokers
23 that there are less health risks than with a regular
24 cigarette?

1 A. I don't have an opinion on that.
2 Q. Do you have an opinion whether the legend
3 "lowered-tar and nicotine" inherently communicates to
4 a potential or actual smoker that the Light
5 cigarette -- the cigarette that has lowered tar and
6 nicotine -- is -- inherently communicates that it has
7 less health risks than regular cigarettes?
8 A. I don't have an opinion.
9 Q. How did you go about finding and
10 identifying the Missouri-specific information
11 contained in your report in this case?
12
A.
Well, specifically I took them from my
13 report in the City of St. Louis case.
Did you want me
14 to talk about how I generated the materials in the
15 City of St. Louis case?
16 Q. Thank you, Doctor.
Yes.
17 A. This was a fairly big undertaking mainly
18 because many of the indexes which tell —
19 access -- provides access to materials for the medical
20 historian on a more general, larger scope, nature,
21 simply don't catalog all of the scientific, medical,
22 nursing, public health journals in Missouri.
23
24
have
And so I went about trying to recreate the
public health community in the state of Missouri,

1 so -- I was interested in what the -- what the state
2 government was doing, what the City of St. Louis
3 government was doing in their departments of public
4 health.
5 that we talked -- we talked a little bit about the
6 American Cancer Society.
7 the Heart Association, Lung Association, Public Health
8 Association, all of those have local state chapters.
9 So I was interested in what the Missouri chapter --
All of the voluntary health organizations
All of them, whether it was
10 and it turns out, not only did they have national
11 materials that they distributed, they have their own
12 journal, they had their own educational materials that
13 they distribute.
14
So it was a big undertaking.
Plus, just the state of Missouri has, I
15 don't know, six or eight medical journals.
16 a number of nursing journals.
17 journals.
18 The City of St. Louis has its own journals.
19 a big undertaking that I tried to capture what their
20 understanding about the nature of the health hazards
21 of smoking.
22
23
Q.
They have
They have hospital
They have hospital administrator journals.
So it was
And did you receive assistance from anyone
in that big undertaking?
24
A.
I did.
I had a number of paralegals who

I also made visits to a number of the

Q.
I take it, to the extent the paralegals
15 identified materials that you believed was relevant,
16 you relied on those materials and included them in
17 your report.
18
A.
My technique was, I mean, I wanted them
19 to -- this is a very -- very voluminous.
20 gave them things like, if the word "smoking" appeared,
21 I wanted the full text, even if it had no bearing at
22 all.

Q.

I'm not sure how
—
Well, let's start with the City of
St. Louis.
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. And I understand that you had some
11 communication with the paralegals and then they went
12 out and presumably went to archives and libraries and
13 stuff.
14 A. Right.
Yes.
15 Q. And then they brought you back what you
16 viewed as a purposefully overbroad selection of
17 materials --
18 A. Right.
19 Q. -- which you then winnowed down to what you
20 thought was relevant and responsive to your historical
21 inquiry.
22 thought it was relevant and responsive, and you

on the work the paralegals did under your supervision.

7 BY MR. SURPRENANT:
8
9
Q.
Uh-huh.
And what is it you told the
paralegals they should be looking for?
10
A.
I gave them just a broad, general list of
11 words, things like smoking, tobacco, the diseases that
12 were associated with smoking, things like, you know,
13 educational programs.
14 -- I don't have it in front of me.
15 them to do was to be very inclusive and knowing that I
16 would probably not use most of what they found.
17 And how did I come up with the list?
There was a long list.
I don't
But what I wanted
Well,
18 one of the things I did was, as I identified a
19 particular journal, I would ask them for them to copy
20 the entire journal —
21 issues.
22 that this particular journal or organization, the
23 kinds of things that they were concerned about so I
24 could then have them focus more particularly sort of
that issue —

Why do you not rely or why have you
13 not used tobaccodocuments.org in your expert work on
14 your cases dealing with tobacco issues?
15
A.
Well, my task has been to look at what the
16 scientific and public health communities knew and
17 understood about the value of low-tar cigarettes.
18 so I have focused primarily on the published
19 scientific literature or educational materials from
20 the Cancer Society, materials that the Surgeon General
21 has put out.

23 company.

A.
I have not searched that, so I can't tell

5 you that most of the -- I think virtually all of the
6 documents that I have used have come through other
7 databases.

9
Q.
Is one of the reasons that you have not
relied or not examined the documents in
10 tobaccodocuments.org is because one of the lawyers for
11 Philip Morris told you strategically you should not do
12 that?
13 A. No one's ever told me that.

15 take it you could get on tobaccodocuments.org just by
16 putting that in the Internet search site and it would
17 come up.

Q.
Am I correct that archives are typically a
primary and valuable resource that historians consult?
4 A. Of course.

6 through your research assistants archives for your

A.
The archive that I dealt with in detail was
the one -- the Lewis Robbins archive at Johns Hopkins.

11 A. Robbins.
—
He was the head of the cancer
12 control program of the National Cancer Institute and
13 the U.S. Public Health Service from sort of 1957
14 through '65, I believe.
15
16
Q.
I've always wondered why there is an S
after John in Johns Hopkins.
17
A.
In Hopkins?
Because that's his name.
There
18 is a Quaker version of John that has a plural -- has
19 an S at the end.

It is not a plural.
It's an S.

6 Q. And then what you did in this case is you
7 looked -- you got your report -- when did you prepare
8 the report for the City of St. Louis case?
A.
9
Well, I was deposed a year or a year and a
10 half ago, so it would have been before that, so I'm
11 going to say somewhere around maybe 2005 or six.
12
Q.
And then when you were retained in this
13 case you then looked to your report in the City of
14 St. Louis case and adapted some of the
15 Missouri-specific discussion?

17 Q. Did you do any additional Missouri-specific

3 compensation in the '70s might be of an issue in this
4 case.
5
Q.
So those -- those files, those documents,
6 were pre-existing in files that you had been
7 accumulating over the years in your office as part of
8 your retention by the tobacco companies?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. Now, what was the selection process that

12
A.
I added a couple of documents.

13 there is some that were from the federal government

18 '72, '73, in there.

20 on smoking and health, and I added something, a

3 journal?
4
A.
I approached this whole process with that in
5 mind, but also really even a step further as a book in
6 the sense that the materials, you know, it's more
7 encompassing than a single article would be.
8
9
Q.
Now, I'm trying to formulate this question,
Dr. English.
Virtually everything that you quote that
10 occurred prior to the Tobacco Institute being
11 disbanded that called out the danger of smoking or
12 related topics, I could get a contemporaneous report
13 from the Tobacco Institute trying to undermine that
14 communication or similar communications.
15 matter of historical practice, why did not your
16 analysis include what the Tobacco Institute was doing
17 to try to undermine information suggesting that
18 smoking regular cigarettes or smoking Light cigarettes
19 could kill you or give you disease?
20 MR. ROSENTHAL:
And as a
I object to the form and
21 lack of foundation, both as to the question and the
22 lengthy preface before it.

3 their communications were.

My focus has been on the
Now, in the course of that many years, I
5 mean, I've read a lot of newspaper accounts and

Well, do you have -- do you believe that
12 there is a likelihood that, if you were to analyze in

14 Institute to the public health community, that you
15 would find a decades-long program of what you would
16 consider professionally to be disinformation?

22 single time when, let's say, the Surgeon General said,
23 you know, we rely on the Tobacco Institute for A, B or
24 C.

from that point of view they are probably irrelevant.

Now, so in your question -- but part of your

2
Q.
We've talked around this issue,
3 Dr. English, and so I would make an objection to my
4 own question as asked and answered in part, but let me
5 try to exhaust you on this topic.
6
Why did you determine that you would not
7 examine in a comprehensive way consistent with the
8 rigor required of a medical historian to determine
9 what the tobacco industry in general and Philip Morris
10 in particular communicated to the public health
11 community about the relative delivery and risk of
12 Light cigarettes versus non-Light cigarettes?
13
A.
The way I define my historical question was
14 what the public health community and what the
15 scientific communities knew about this.
16 include in my historical question what a manufacturer
17 knew.
18
Q.
I didn't
You read several hundred pages of Judge
19 Kessler's opinion in United States v. Philip Morris.

2 Q. Okay.
3
But what you read is you focused on
her discussion of Light cigarettes, correct?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. And that ran into several hundred pages.
6 A. I believe so, yes.
7 Q. And one of her conclusions was that the
8 tobacco defendants, including Philip Morris,
9 fraudulently or deceptively marketed their Light
10
cigarettes, correct?
11 A. I believe that's correct.

Did you find yourself

14 expert opinion on that topic?

So if Hercules was to tell you that Philip

12 either misled or not misled because of the descriptor
13 "Lights" and the legend "lowered-tar and nicotine."

Q.
Yeah, I wasn't in my last question and your
13 answer to it, Dr. English, I wasn't attempting to
14 communicate that all the lawyers would agree that, as
15 I phrase the issue, that was a central issue, but
16 assuming that's the central issue, that is, the degree
17 to which -- or whether or not Marlboro Light smokers
18 in Missouri between 1995 and 2003 were misled by the
19 "Lights" descriptor on the box and by the "lowered tar
20 and nicotine," as we've established, you don't have an
21 expert opinion on that topic.

The opinions that you do have about what was

How did class members
And on the left-hand side of the paper I'm
21 putting Dr. English's expert conclusions in this case.

3 THE WITNESS:
Objection to form.
Let me say how they —
how
4 they might bear on this, and that is the public health
5 community clearly recommended low-tar cigarettes to
6 American smokers for a period of decades because it
7 was -- as a -- what I call a third-tier
8 recommendation.

The most important recommendation
The second thing was, if
10 you're already a smoker, you need to stop.

12 nicotine -- and this was done by governmental
13 authorities, members of the American Cancer Society
14 and others.

But if you
So this information was out there.
It was a
16 determined decision in public communication.
Exactly
17 where Missouri smokers got their information, I can't
18 tell you, but I —
19 me that they got their information from the public
20 health community.
21 know that, that there will be people here who do know
22 how to study consumer perception that may be able to

1 A. Yes.
2 Q. Okay.
Now, who did they make
3 recommendations to?
I know the different -- different
4 recommendations would go to different people, but, in
5 general.
6 A. Well, they made recommendations to smokers.
7 Q. To the public, in other words?
8 A. To the public.
9
10
Some of the recommendations
they made were to physicians with, I think, ultimately
the physicians were an intermediary to the public.
11 Q. Okay.
Now
—
12 A. I mean, they also -- I mean, the "New York
13 Times" commented on the recommendations, and so it was
14 picked up by the media.
Lots of magazines picked up
15 various elements of it.
So I think there probably
16 were a variety of audiences.
17
Q.
Okay.
Now, where we've had some discussion
18 is about the ability of a medical historian to reach
19 expert opinion, expert conclusions, on what the public
20 health community understood.
21
Okay.
Now, I take it, it is your testimony that
22 you can have some insight, not only into what
23 information was available and what recommendations
24 were made, but you can gain insight into what the

1 public health community understood because you have
2 written documents where they talk about their
3 understanding; is that correct?
4
5
A.
Yes, I think I can do that in some
instances.
6
Q.
Okay.
Now, it may not matter.
It may be
7 semantics, I don't know, but, as a historian, you're
8 not able to reach expert opinions on what people
9 believed because belief is inherently subjective.
10
A.
Well, of course, you know, the public health
11 community can be people, it can be an organization,
12 you know, and we may be getting into semantics there,
13 but sometimes when they come out and say, we recommend
14 low tar because, that comes close to a belief, I
15 think, or an understanding.
16 making a distinction there that you maybe are making
17 in asking your question.

I think where there is
—
unless it was ellipses that were in the original.
13
MR. ROSENTHAL:
Well, I'm looking at finding
14 of Fact 2174, there are ellipses at the beginning of

You know she has now joined

5 MR. ROSENTHAL:
I'm aware of that, yes.

9 ellipses are original to Judge Kessler

And is it your representation that the

Well, since it's inside a

12 MR. ROSENTHAL:

that's my assumption,

1 different questions on these different findings of
2 fact depending on what they say.
3 2027 --
4
5
A.
Now, Finding of Fact
You're going to have to explain to me what a
finding of fact is.
6 Q. Well, you read Judge Kessler's opinion?
7 A. I did read portions of it, but I'm not sure
8
what a finding of fact is.
9
Q.
What I'm going to say is that a judge in a
10 judge trial where the judge is the trier of fact --
11 there is not a jury -- is the judge will, after the
12 trial, with the input of the parties, will then reach
13 Findings of Fact, that is, the Court will find as a
14 fact a certain fact, a certain datum, as it were, and
15 will also reach conclusions of law based on those
16 facts.
17
18
A.
So the finding of fact is based on evidence
that the judge has heard.
19 Q. Yes.
20 A. Okay.
21
22
Right.
MR. ROSENTHAL:
In theory, at least.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
23 Q. Okay.
24 A. Uh-huh.
And presumably there is dispute at
Thompson Court Reporters, Inc.

3990547534Page 127
1
the trial about the facts.
2
Q.
Right.
A judge in a judge trial, as Judge
3 Kessler did here, will hear conflicting evidence, and,
4 like a juror, a jury, will decide essentially who to
5 believe and who not to believe, but a jury is a black
6 box.
7 to -- they are just required to fill out the special
8 jury interrogatory, you know, which are usually used
9 and not just a verdict.
They don't -- they don't -- they aren't required
But a judge has to find
10 facts, make conclusions of law, so it can be appealed
11 and the court of appeal can understand what the judge
12 found.
13
And so with that little introduction to law,
14 Professor English, so the first one I'm going to have,
15 as I was saying, I'm going to have different questions
16 on different of these findings.
17 as you know from being an expert witness in the case,
18 included Philip Morris, correct?
19 A. That's —
20 Q. Okay.
21
And the defendants,
yes.
So Finding of Fact No. 2027:
Defendants did not disclose the full extent
22 and depth of their knowledge and understanding of
23 smoker compensation to the public health community or
24 to government regulators.

Because you have not done a systematic study

3 have no opinion one way or another as to whether this
4 factual finding is correct or not.
5 MR. ROSENTHAL:

End of first
Again, Dr. English, I'm not asking you with
5 respect to that sentence whether you agree with Judge
6 Kessler, disagree with Judge Kessler, whether --
7 whether she had an adequate basis for that or an
8 inadequate basis.
9 that you do not have an expert opinion as to whether

10 would cause smokers -- I don't know whether she is

No, I don't
I guess part of my answer is that, you know,

opinion about would be what the defendants knew.

6 into the first instance where the Court, Judge
7 Kessler, is citing written testimony on direct.

10
You know, they should have written testimony
on direct in every case.
Direct testimony is so
boring.
11
Quoting the third sentence:
To feed their
12 addiction, therefore, these smokers would defeat the
13 stated purpose of the lower delivery products, and
14 then she cites a witness, Henningfield, written
15 direct, and she gives the page and line citation.
16
Reading that sentence in conjunction as I
17 think it should be with the prior sentence that I read
18 to you, I am correct, am I not, that because you have
19 not studied Philip Morris's internal documents in a
20 systematic way, you have no expert opinion on whether
21 that third sentence read in conjunction with the
22 second sentence is accurate or not, correct?

9 the FTC contemplated at the time it adopted its method
10 that numerous potential variations among individuals
11 in everyday smoking behavior could have some effect on
12 tar and nicotine yields, it did not have a full
13 understanding of smoker compensation -- that smokers'
14 addiction to nicotine would cause them to smoke
15 low-tar cigarettes more intensely to satisfy their
16 nicotine addiction, and thereby inhale amounts of tar
17 and nicotine comparable to those inhaled by smokers of
18 full-flavored cigarettes.

The next sentence said in Finding of Fact
2349:

8 Morris, withheld the long-held knowledge that the
9 primary reason the FTC Method could yield misleading

11 to obtain relatively stable nicotine intakes through
12 smoker compensation, and then a citation to the
13 written direct of Henningfield.

that.
16
I take it you do not have an expert opinion
17 because your testimony didn't -- your analysis --
18 didn't address it whether the tobacco companies,
19 including Philip Morris, withheld from the FTC their

Is that one of the ways that Philip Morris,

6 nicotine addiction most smokers would smoke the
7 cigarette in such a way, consciously or unconsciously,

1 unconscious efforts to smoke the cigarette in order
2 to -- it would provide relatively stable levels of
3 nicotine after switching from a higher tar and
4 nicotine cigarette to a lower tar and nicotine
5 cigarette?
6 MR. ROSENTHAL:
7 THE WITNESS:
Objection to form.
Let me try to answer it this
8 way.
From the very beginning the FTC understood that
9 what a smoker got and what the machine got were
10 different and for all the reasons that they enumerated
11 in the news release at the time.
12 1967, a full idea of what compensation was and
13 nicotine titration, that was a -- that was a
14 scientific idea that emerged a little bit later
15 especially with Michael Russell's studies in the
16 1970's.
This, of course, was
17 Certainly, I think, in some of their annual
18 reports and also reviews of whether they should change
19 the FTC Method, the FTC clearly states that they know
20 that what a machine gets and what the smoker get are
21 different.
22 exists.
23 you have in your question, into a single document, I'm
24 not sure they do that precisely, but I think that they
They mention the fact that compensation

2 nicotine addiction or at least nicotine titration is
3 what is fueling compensation.
4 well aware of that.

Q.
I think they were very
Well, you put several things together.
7 There is no doubt, Dr. English, that the FTC was aware
8 that compensation was possible, correct?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. There is no doubt that they were aware and
11 stated that the FTC methods results would not be
12 tracked by actual smoking and the actual smoking
13 intake could vary based on the smoker, correct?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Okay.
And they obviously knew there was a
16 variety of ways a cigarette smoker could compensate by
17 smoking more puffs, by smoking more deeply, by holding
18 the smoke, inhaling it longer, as it were, and smoking
19 further down into the -- what is the technical term of
20 the cigarette?
21 A. Closer to the butt?
22 Q. Closer to the butt, yes, okay.

23 that was known and talked about in the public health

5
Well, let me ask it this way.
I'm correct,
6 am I not, that for much, if not virtually all of the
7 period of time the FTC Method was in effect, the FTC
8 did not have the core knowledge that it was the
9 nicotine addiction that would cause the smoker to
10 extract as much nicotine from a lowered tar and
11 nicotine cigarette as from the higher one they had
12 switched from, correct?
13 MR. ROSENTHAL:
14 THE WITNESS:
Objection to form.
I don't agree with that.
I
15 mean, I think the reason smokers compensated was for
16 nicotine.
17 health -- in fact, I can't think of a single document
18 that comes to mind at the moment that would say that
19 smokers compensate for any other reason than nicotine.
20 That goes with the concept of compensation.

8 are aware of the fact that nicotine, in sum or
9 substance, that nicotine addiction would drive smokers
10 to obtain relatively stable nicotine intake through
11 smoker compensation.
12
A.
Well, as I pointed out here, we could flip
13 through this, but my point is they were aware of
14 compensation and compensation implies nicotine --
15 smoking for nicotine levels.
16 just part and parcel of the public health community's
17 understanding of what compensation was.
18 no -- what else would be driving it?
19
Q.
I mean, I think that's
There is
Well, first of all, are you now saying that
20 that is the implication in the FTC's communications
21 but they never made that implication express?

Q.
Okay.
Now let's ask -- let's go to the
3 next level.
It is one thing, Dr. English, to say, we
4 all know the only reason a smoker compensates is
5 because of nicotine addiction.
6 thing to say that addiction will cause them to smoke
7 lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes in such a way as
8 to obtain relatively stable nicotine intakes.
9 another point, correct?
10 MR. ROSENTHAL:
11 THE WITNESS:
It is a far different
That's
Objection.
The way the public health
12 community used the term "compensation" in the 1970's
13 and onward is that the smoker adjusted smoking
14 behavior based on the level of nicotine.
15 was that they would adjust their behavior upward, more
16 intensive smoking, in response to lower levels of
17 nicotine.
18 in the historical documents I've read how people
19 understood this.
20 every smoker do it or not.
21 was discussion about that aspect of it, but not the
22 sense that compensation existed and that it was -- it
23 was linked to nicotine.

Q.
Dr. English, just as a matter of logic, if
2 the FTC knew, if the FTC knew that because of nicotine
3 addiction that the addicted smoker would smoke the
4 cigarette, whether consciously in part, unconsciously
5 in part, all consciously, all unconsciously, to obtain
6 relatively stable levels of nicotine, that would have
7 told them for that reason that the FTC Method was
8 misleading the public, correct?

The FTC knew that what
11 their —

13 individual smoker, got.
14 -- and they knew it had nothing to do with what an
15 average smoker got.
16 doing is coming up with a machine number that would
17 give smokers a way to distinguish higher based on FTC
18 measurements and lower based on FTC measurements.

3 Marlboro regular.
4 knew that almost invariably that smoker of Marlboro
5 Light is going to smoke the cigarette so in such a way

9 THE WITNESS:

Well, a couple things.
One
10 is, I don't think anyone who was discussing
11 compensation would have used the word "invariably."
12 They knew it was possible for some smokers but maybe
13 not all smokers.
14
So that was one.
The question of misleading gets the intent

17 to deliberately mislead the public?

2 any document that you cite that expressly says, from
3 the FTC, that we understand that the smoker is going
4 to change his smoking habits when they switch from a
5 higher to a lower tar and nicotine cigarette in such a
6 way that their addiction will cause them to smoke in
7 such a way where they get comparable levels of
8 nicotine?

MR. ROSENTHAL:

THE WITNESS:

Well, certainly they never
11 expressed it the way you did.
First of all, they
12 would never say "the smoker."
They might say it's
13 possible for, you know, a smoker but not —
14 smoker, but "the smoker" implies the population.
15 I'll come back to what my original answer, and that is
16 that they understood that compensation exists, they

17 It is clear -- quoting -- it is clear, based on their
18 internal research documents, reports, memoranda, and
19 letters, that defendants have known for decades that
20 there is no clear health benefit from smoking low-tar,
21 low-nicotine cigarettes as opposed to conventional,
22 full-flavor cigarettes.

I'm correct, am I not, that you do not have

That's correct.
BY MR. SURPRENANT:
4
Q.
Continuing, it is also clear that, while
5 Defendants knew that the FTC Method for measuring tar
6 and nicotine accurately compared the nicotine tar
7 percentages of different cigarettes, they also knew
8 the method was totally unreliable for measuring the
9 actual nicotine and tar any real-life smoker would
10 absorb because it did not take into account the
11 phenomenon of smoker compensation.
12
13
Do you have any expert opinion on the
accuracy of that sentence?
14 MR. ROSENTHAL:
15 THE WITNESS:
Objection to form.
The only way I could answer
16 that question is I do know what Philip Morris and
17 other tobacco companies, what their submission was
18 when the Cambridge Method first came up in the FTC
19 held hearings, and the -- and the tobacco companies
20 expressly said that they did not believe that the
21 method actually measured what smokers obtained from
22 cigarettes, and that opinion was taken over virtually
23 verbatim by the FTC when they announced the method.

Q.

Let me return to a topic that we
12 kind of had some examination on without being
13 duplicative and try to get a better understanding.
14
You have framed your analysis around what
15 the public health community understood, what knowledge
16 was available to it, about the relative delivery and
17 health risk of lowered tar and nicotine cigarette
18 versus higher tar and nicotine cigarette.
19 recommendations they made based on that and what they
20 understood as discerned from the recommendations and
21 the documents they published.

But among the things you haven't
2 done is to identify in a systematic way that would
3 comport with the rigor of medical historical research
4 to identify what the tobacco industry, including

If I was a potential smoker in 1994 and I

But, first of all, is the smoker in your
15 hypothetical relying on everything that Mr. Campbell
16 said?
17 the video that I saw and so he saw the idea that the

I think consumer behavior is
14 much more complicated than that.
15 I do know, and I'm not an expert there, I suspect that
16 a potential consumer might consider all the
17 information that's out there.
18 into a field where I really don't have expertise, and

Q.
Did you read it where the seven-year-old
boy who had asthma testified that there were a lot of
10 things that he wanted to do that he couldn't do
11 because smoking was allowed in public places, like
12 bowling alleys, and occasionally when he was around
13 secondhand smoke he would feel sick for days, and the
14 secondhand smoke and the smoking in public places,
15 like bowling alleys, made him feel as if he was not
16 normal and not equal to his other friends who didn't
17 get as sick as he did from secondhand smoke.
18 asked the CEOs, doesn't this child's testimony
19 indicate there is a real issue with secondhand smoke,
20 and none of them would agree that public smoking
21 should be banned.

Q.
Okay.
Now, Dr. English, I appreciate your

4 what I've put on the right-hand side of Exhibit 9 are
5 the relevant issues.
6
I'm not saying that the lawyers,
That's an argument we can have.
What I want to do is understand the
7 relationship, if any, between what's on the left-hand
8 side of Exhibit 9 and what's on the right-hand side of
9 Exhibit 9.
10 Now, on the left hand is what the public
11 health community knew and recommended about lowered
12 tar and nicotine cigarettes versus higher tar and
13 nicotine cigarettes.

15 is.
And, Dr. English, that's just
Okay?
16 A. Okay.
17 Q. And I am correct, am I not, that there is
18 no relationship between your testimony on what the
19 public health community knew and recommended about
20 lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes versus higher tar
21 and nicotine cigarettes and the topic of what class
22 members understood Marlboro Lights and lowered tar and

THE WITNESS:
That's not exactly what I
2 said.
What I said is that I don't know what class
3 members understood, but I think there is a connection
4 in the sense that the public health community wanted
5 smokers -- these are people who would not stop and
6 wouldn't, you know, smoking -- they wanted them to
7 know about low-tar cigarettes.

So I think there is a connection there.
That's certainly what the message was.

11 about their reception of the message.

Q.
But what I
So I don't know
Well, what is more is that's a question of
14 consumer behavior, and you told me just before we
15 broke that that is a topic that you have no expertise
16 on and would be extremely reluctant to opine on,
17 correct?

1 about lower tar and nicotine cigarettes versus higher
2 tar and nicotine cigarettes to what the class member
3 understood Marlboro Lights and lowered tar and
4 nicotine to mean, but that's not —
5 connection you can provide, correct?
6 A. That's correct.
7 Q. Okay.
that's not a
Now, the second one, issue, I put
8 there is what class members understood about health
9 risks associated with Marlboro Lights versus Marlboro
10 Reds.
And, again, because that is an issue of
11 consumer behavior and marketing and advertising, all
12 of which are topics you're not an expert on, there is
13 no connection between that issue —
14
strike that.
Your opinion on what the public health
15 community knew and recommended about lowered tar and
16 nicotine cigarettes versus higher tar and nicotine
17 cigarettes does not address the issue of what class
18 members understood about health risks associated with
19 Marlboro Lights versus Marlboro Reds, correct?
20
A.
I would answer in the same way.
I mean,
21 certainly the public health community had the
22 information, but I'm -- I haven't studied the class,
23 so I'm not able to make that —

1 consumer behavior, so I'm kind of reluctant to go down
2 this path, but let me ask a few questions.
3
I've asked you about tobacco -- whether
4 you've studied the impact of communications from the
5 Tobacco Institute to the public health community and
6 whether that affected their understanding or
7 communications by Philip Morris to the public health
8 community, and I believe you've expressed in sum or
9 substance that you don't think that any such
10 communications would have had an impact on what the
11 public health community knew and understood; is that
12 correct?
13
A.
Certainly the ones that I've seen.
I mean,
14 I haven't made a systematic study, but over the years
15 I've seen quite a few documents, you know, probably in
16 the hundreds of documents.
17
Q.
Now, just as a matter —
and I know you're
18 not an expert in consumer behavior -- but do you have
19 any kind of lay opinion that the public would much
20 more likely be influenced by -- about, you know, risks
21 and dangers or the absence of risks and dangers from
22 smoking cigarettes by communications from the --

A.
Yes, I do.
Do you recall that?
I do remember the line of
questioning.
4
Q.
Okay.
Now, are you aware that an express
5 aim of the open-question strategy was to create in the
6 smoking public or the potential smoking public's mind
7 an issue that said, while there are statistical
8 correlations between smoking and lung cancer, it is an
9 open question whether there is really a cause and

effect?

As a logical matter, as a logical
14 matter, unless you have determined in a systematic way
15 sufficient to form expert opinions about what Philip
16 Morris knew about compensation and when it knew it,
17 you could not arrive at an opinion as to whether
18 Philip Morris manipulated the FTC on the issue of
19 compensation and the FTC testing method, correct?
20 would be missing a vital input.

In these cases I have seen quite a few

in this particular issue because I think the Federal

I mean, I think that
3 it was the public health community that asked the FTC,

9 historian, correct?
10 MR. ROSENTHAL:
11 THE WITNESS:
You've seen some
Objection.
Well, let me just say how it's
12 happened in other cases and you can say whether
13 something like that might happen in this case.
14 other words, when I've been shown a document from
15 Philip Morris, I'm asked an expert opinion about
16 whether that document represents knowledge that was
17 not generally available in the public health
18 community.
19
In
In other words, I don't think I have to
20 know -- do research on every possible document that
21 Philip Morris had in order to be able to make -- have
22 an opinion about a single document, usually one
23 introduced by Plaintiffs, with a claim that it really
24 is superior knowledge than what the public health

1 community is.
2 then I would make -- have an opinion about whether the
3 public health community actually knew this particular
4 point.
5 And I suspect that that's what may happen in this
6 case, but I'm -- I'm not certain about that.

I've been shown those documents, and
I mean, that's the way it's gone in the past.
Q.
Well, if I have my hands on the wheel, it
won't, okay?
If I were to look in your report, if I
10 were to ask you, Dr. English, can you point me in your
11 report where you address in a systematic way
12 sufficient to allow you to reach expert conclusions
13 the topic, what Philip Morris and the tobacco industry
14 knew and understood about compensation and when they
15 knew it, would there be a part of the report you could

Is this a new paragraph on this report or
is this paragraph appeared in other reports?
3 A. I believe it's appeared in other reports.
4 Q. Okay.
5
Do you recall why you first inserted
it into your report?
6
A.
My recollection is that it covered the
7 general issue that we're talking about here this
8 afternoon, in that in many -- in some of the trials
9 I've been in, I was thinking particularly of the
10 Miles-Price one, I was asked questions about whether a
11 particular Philip Morris document or Philip Morris
12 study was, you know, how that fit into what the public
13 health community knew, what was it -- did it show
14 superior knowledge, no difference, and in a general
15 way sort of covers that -- the issue of that.
16
Q.
Okay.
So am I correct that the sum and
17 substance of your discussion of the topic of what
18 Philip Morris and the tobacco industry knew or
19 understood about compensation and when they knew it,
20 the sum and substance, the totality of that discussion
21 is in paragraph 68?

I'm aware that in previous

22 company defendants —
23 that had the tobacco company defendants disclosed
24 their knowledge about compensation in the 1970 ' s, the
some plaintiffs have alleged

1 conclusion of the 1981 Surgeon General Report would
2 have been different.
3
So that's the conclusion we're talking
4 about.
And then to skip to the last paragraph, you
5 say:
6 Plaintiffs in support of this allegation in previous
7 litigation and am unaware of any Defendants internal
8 study that reflects information not known to the
9 public health community about compensation by
I have reviewed documents identified by
10 increasing the number of cigarette smoked per day, the
11 one form of compensation not taken into account by
12 epidemiology.
13
Okay.
So this kind of relates to what I'm
14 talking about, but it's clearly different and much
15 more narrow.
16 report, you do not address in a systematic way that
17 would allow you to reach conclusions of a medical
18 historian what Philip Morris and the tobacco industry
19 knew and understood about compensation and when they
20 knew it, correct?

Now, I take that into account.
Dr. English, but logically you cannot reach an expert
10 conclusion as a medical historian about whether the
11 public health community knew and understood everything
12 Philip Morris and the tobacco industry knew about
13 compensation and that they knew about it at the same
14 time because you don't have the antecedent expert
15 opinion about what Philip Morris and the tobacco
16 industry knew and understood about compensation and
17 when they knew it, correct?
18 MR. ROSENTHAL:
19 THE WITNESS:

20 understand your question, but I do know what the

But I am adding a different and additional
component, is that, not only would smokers compensate
10 and not only would they compensate because of nicotine
11 addiction, but that compensation, as a general matter,
12 would reach, perhaps not exact, but comparable levels
13 of nicotine addiction so the smoker would get

In that section of the Surgeon

12 talking about whether a lower-tar cigarette would have
13 clear health benefits, and so the -- this asterisk

15 might compensate, and, therefore, not get the benefits
16 of low tar.

10
lowered tar and nicotine cigarettes, correct?
11
A.
I think the general view, and I think that's
12 in my conclusions there, of the public health
13 community is that they believe that low-tar cigarettes
14 had health benefits despite the fact that some smokers
15 could compensate.
16 had a few studies that were -- human studies -- at
17 this point in 1972 that were -- thinking particularly
18 of the Bross study, exciting studies that would
19 indicate that there was less risk in filtered

for a long time, many years, were a pediatrician.
11 A. I am.
12 Q. And you are now a retired pediatrician.
13 A. That is correct.
14 Q. Okay.
I'm correct, am I not, that
15 teenagers, one of the reasons they occasionally engage
16 in irrational or immature behavior, is not only
17 they're relatively inexperienced, but that their
18 neurodevelopment isn't complete, correct?

A.
That's certainly one of the ideas about
20 that.
21 that, but that's one of the ideas, yes.

And they do that despite, you know,

We're quibbling a little bit
20 here because he doesn't use the word "addiction" in
21 this particular quote, but, again, he's talking about
22 compensating to maintain a level of nicotine in the
23 blood, which is one of the characteristics, I think,
24 that many people would consider as evidence of

But I don't want to quibble on terms, but
2 I think it's —
3 "addiction"
4 was in the 1970 T s.
5 what was driving the behavior of compensation, which,
6 as they -- I think these examples show their
7 understanding was that what was driving the
8 compensation was the quest of the smoker,
9 unconsciously, to maintain a level of nicotine in the

10 blood during waking hours, of course.

No, I am -- I am interested in
13 addiction and the role that plays in compensation.
14 I'm explicitly interested in it.

17 you're saying, Surprenant, you're overly focused on

But in 1972 the Surgeon General referred to
8 the substance of what Dr. Russell was stating as an

12 this point in the mid '70s in the public health
13 community.

You know, we're getting into
16 the point, how public health consensus are made on a
17 given topic.
18 I think this notion of compensating to maintain a
19 level of nicotine grew in its acceptance.
20 know that I can actually give you a date when that
21 happened, but the public health community understood
22 that compensation could exist, and the only
23 explanation I've ever seen about compensation, what
24 drives compensation, is that of nicotine.

One of the things that you have said is
7 that the public health community knew and understood

9 cigarettes and made recommendations to the public,

correct?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Okay.
Now, ultimately in this case what
13 we're concerned about isn't what the public health
14 community understood or knew.
15 what the public understood and knew, and, most
16 specifically, the class of Missouri smokers of
17 Marlboro Lights.
18
We're concerned with
And so, as a matter of logic, if every time
19 the public health community said something about
20 smoking and then "Big Tobacco" including the Tobacco
21 Institute said, there is no proof, they are making it
22 up, it's unsubstantiated, there is no evidence for it,

MR. ROSENTHAL:
First of all, I object to
3 the paragraph-long preface, which I'm not even sure
4 was a question, but I also object to the form and
5 foundation of the question.

THE WITNESS:
Well, part of your question
7 had to do with public health community recommendations
8 about low-tar cigarettes to the public.
9 I've ever seen a tobacco company, a Tobacco Institute
I don't think
10 document, in any form -- I mean, I know I haven't done
11 a systematic search -- shown that would countermand
12 that particular message that low-tar cigarette -- that
13 the public, if they are going to smoke, should smoke
14 low tar.
Maybe they have; I just haven't seen one.
15 And, again, how the public achieves -- how
16 they process the information, it's not something that
17 I have an expert opinion about.

Okay.
Now, if in 1988 the Tobacco
20 Institute is, even on that late date saying, it's an
21 open question, we don't know if cigarettes are
22 addictive, we don't know if cigarettes cause health
23 issues, we don't know if they kill people, they are
