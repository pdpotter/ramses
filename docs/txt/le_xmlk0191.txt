CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. LAWSON:
Q. Good morning, Dr. Kyriakoudes, how are
you?
A. Good.
Q. Good. We met a little earlier. My name is Christine Lawson, and I'm here on behalf of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. I know you’ve done this a number of times; is that right?
A. That’s correct.
Q. So you pretty much know the routine?
A. That’s correct.
Q. If you need a break at any time, let me
know.
A. I will.
Q. If you don’t understand one of my questions, will you let me know?
A. I will.
Q. I will try to rephrase it. If you answer my question, though, is it fair for me to assume that you understood the question?
A. Yes.
MS. LAWSON: On the phone we have
Mr. Tepikian. Bruce, are you here on behalf of
Philip Morris and Lorillard today?
MR. TEPIKIAN: That is correct.
(Defendants' Exhibit 1 was marked for
identification.)
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) All right. Let's start
with your notice of deposition. We'll mark that as the first exhibit, if I may. I'm going to ask you to take a look at that and see if you've seen this before.
A. You asked me if I've seen this before?
Q. Yes.
A. And I have. I received this by electronic mail attachment.
Q. You notice, I think, it's the last two pages there that asked you to bring certain items with you today.
A. That's correct.
Q. And have you brought any items responsive to that?
A. I have.
Q. Can you tell me what you brought, please.
A. I’ll just tell you what I brought, and then if you want to link it to the —
Q. That's fine.
A. I brought three data disks of reliance material.
Q. Okay.
A. And those are for you to have.
Q. And these three disks, are these all your reliance materials for Campbell case?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay.
A. Well, I would add to that, you know, be a little understanding in that I'm just myself. I don’t have any staff.
Q. Okay.
A. So that's the materials that I keep to do my research that I rely upon, but I have a supplement list of other items in there for which I don’t actually keep copies and for which there are hyperlinks. Mostly, Legacy database documents. But I will add to that, also, the materials I've used in my previous cases since January, which would be the Hess case and the Sherman case and the Ferlanti case.
I'm reaching the point where, particularly for video exhibits, which are well known and widely circulated, but take up a large amount of space on my computer, that I'm not keeping copies of those. So I would add that to my universe of reliance documents.
MR. SALES: Are they linked, though?
THE WITNESS: Just about all of them, yes.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) On these disks?
A. On these disks.
Q. All right.
A. But there may be some things that aren't, here and there.
Q. Okay.
A. So I know that sounds maybe not as satisfying for you as you'd like, but it's a huge volume of material that I've collected over the years. I'm really at the point, really, where I need somebody to help me organize it the way your experts provide a list, and I'm working to that. I'm getting there.
Q. Let me ask you just for the record, you understand you're here today about a case called Campbell versus R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, et al.?
A. I do understand that, yes.
Q. All right. And what you’ve described to me in your previous answer would be your reliance materials for the Campbell case?
A. Yes.
Q. So it's going to be on these disks or hyperlinked?
A. Through something called supplemental reliance documents, which is on the first disk of the Word file.
Q. Or it was used in the Hess, Sherman, or Ferlanti cases?
A. Correct.
Q. And that would be the university of your reliance materials for the Campbell case?
A. Yes. And what we mentioned earlier, the preservation deposition. I may draw upon some of those materials.
(Defendants' Exhibit 2 was marked for
identification.)
Q. Doctor, is that your handwriting on the
disk?
A. That is my handwriting.
Q. And there are three of them, correct?
A. There's three.
Q. And just for the record, they are
labeled —
A. Kyriakoudes 1, 2, and 3.
Q. — Kyriakoudes Campbell 1, and then Kyriakoudes Disk 2, and Kyriakoudes No. 3.
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Now, Doctor, do you go by Doctor or Professor?
A. Professor; that's fine.
Q. Professor, are there documents on these disks that were not used in Hess, Sherman, or Ferlanti, to your knowledge?
A. When you say used, you mean as like —
Q. Or disclosed as reliance materials in Hess, Sherman or Ferlanti?
A. Yes, there would be. And I can describe those for you.
Q. Can you tell me which ones those would be?
A. Yes. You know, I'm constantly doing research, and I've got some additional newspaper exhibits in there, which I could describe to you.
Q. If you would, please.
A. Additional stories from newspapers like the Hartford Courant, The Chicago Daily Times — I'm sorry, the Chicago Tribune — newspapers from Panama City in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. They would be
under a subdirectory that will help you find that listed as newspapers.
Q. And I think the first one you told me was the Hartford Courant?
A. That's right.
Q. When did you look at the Hartford Courant?
A. Well, I’ve looked at that paper over time. I did some additional research in the Hartford Courant in the last few weeks.
Q. Why did you do that?
A. I have another case.
Q. Okay.
A. Just so you'll know, my position has been, I gave it all. You know, I’ll just give it to you.
It’s a case in Connecticut.
Q. What's the name of that case?
A. Bifolk, B-i-f-o-l-k.
Q. I think you said you also had some new Chicago Tribune articles in there?
A. That's right.
Q. When did you look at the Chicago Tribune?
A. That's been in the last couple of weeks.
Q. Why did you look at it?
A. No particular reason. It's just part of my general research. And just so you'll know, I have
regained access to a proprietary database. A subscription database called ProQuest, which I’ve used in the past. So I've had access for that in the last month, and so I've been making advantage of that by doing just general cigarette research.
Q. In the Hartford Courant, which time periods were the articles that you were looking at? What time period?
A. In this one, mostly it's from the '60s onward; '60s to the early '90s.
Q. How about for the Chicago Tribune, what time period?
A. That's almost the whole course of the 20th century.
Q. And I think you also told me you looked at a newspaper from Panama City?
A. Yes, Panama City and Fort Walton Beach.
Q. When did you look at it?
A. Those have been over the last, maybe this spring, I would think. That's from a different proprietary database that I have regular access to called Newspaperarchive.com. These are the research tools that I use, and that one I have ongoing access. With ProQuest, I have a short window. My university doesn't subscribe to the ProQuest.
Q. And just so I make sure I understand, this Panama City, is it Panama City and Fort Walton or —
A. Two separate papers.
Q. Two separate papers? Okay. Why did you look at the paper from Panama City?
A. Those are the ones in the Newspaperarchive.com database that are from Florida.
I searched for Southeastern US and Florida. So no case-specific reason. Just, again, part of my general research into the history of smoking and health.
Q. Would it be fair to say that you looked at that paper because it happened to be archived on the Newspaperarchive.com —
A. That would be fair.
Q. — website?
A. Yes.
Q. And no other reason?
A. Right; that’s correct.
Q. And what time period did you look at for the Panama City papers?
A. And this is true also for the Fort Walton paper.
Q. Okay.
A. Basically for the period, and this would
be confirmed when you look at the dates, but my recollection is ’50s, ’60s, ’70s.
Q. And would all of your answers that you gave me regarding the Panama City paper apply equally to the Fort Walton paper?
A. They would.
Q. Other than these Panama City and Fort Walton papers, have you looked at any other newspapers from Florida?
A. I don’t think so, no.
Q. All right. What other materials did you bring with you?
A. Okay. You had asked for e-mails?
Q. Yes, sir.
A. And so I brought those. One of them is — I printed a bunch of them on a sheet just to save paper.
Q. As long as I can read them, I don't care.
A. Yes. I can characterize the e-mails. They're essentially scheduling and conveying depositions and other documents by e-mail attachment.
(Defendants' Exhibit 3 was marked for
identification.)
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) What else do you have for
me, Doctor?
A. You asked for my curriculum vitae.
Q. And this is your current CV?
A. It is.
(Defendants' Exhibit 4 was marked for identification.)
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) Do you have anything else
for me?
A. In Items 9 and 10, you had asked for presentations and public statements. Here is the last presentation I gave, which would have been February of ’08, early February, at University of North Carolina. I’ve given you in other depositions — and when I say others, I mean, depositions within the last six months. So this was the one I printed out.
Q. Where was this one delivered?
A. It was delivered to the University of North Carolina. It was something called the Hutchins Forum. It was a public lecture, and those were the PowerPoint slides that accompanied my spoken presentation.
MS. LAWSON: Let's mark this as the next exhibit.
(Defendants' Exhibit 5 was marked for identification.)
THE WITNESS: And just to continue that, Item No. 19, you’re probably aware of this, but I did give a radio interview, an extensive radio interview, I think in September, late September/early October of ’08. The hyperlink is in my CV. So if you want to review what I said in that interview, you can go to the Internet and check the archive at the radio station.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) And that interview was on
the topic of smoking and health?
A. It was, yes. Well, they built it more specifically as the role of the cigarette and Southern life, but issues of smoking and health came up, and so I discussed that.
Q. One of the things you were asked for in the duces tecum is to bring your complete file in this case. Do you have any files for this case?
A. I don't. I mean, I have the electronic materials that were delivered to you there of the e-mails. And then the files that are referenced in those e-mails, although, I'm sure you have them, are also on the first disk under the subdirectory Campbell.
Q. And you're asked in number four for copies
of any notes created in connection with this case.
Do you have any notes regarding the Campbell case?
A. I have no notes for this case.
Q. You're also asked for copies of all-time records reflecting the time you spent on this case.
Do you know how much time you spent on the Campbell case?
A. Well, I've talked with Mr. Searcy a few times on the telephone.
MR. SALES: Sales.
THE WITNESS: Mr. Sales. Okay. Searcy is the name of your law firm?
MR. SALES: Right.
THE WITNESS: We're old friends, as you can tell.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) I can tell.
A. I've talked to him a couple of times on the phone on consultive matters; maybe, probably 90 minutes total. And then I reviewed the depositions. Not all the depositions in the case, but the ones that we've talked about — the husband, the sister of Mrs. Campbell — that's probably about another three hours. I'd say 4-1/2 to five hours.
Q. Have you kept any written records of that
time?
A. No, I haven’t.
Q. Do you know how much you have billed for your work on the Campbell case?
A. I’ve yet to submit a bill.
Q. Do you have any idea how much that bill is going to be?
A. Well, certainly 4-1/2, five hours so far. And then, you know, closer to when the trial happens — I usually submit a bill after the trial.
So I imagine I’ll go out there for a day.
Q. Okay.
A. If it’s like for every other case I’ve done, I got there for a day to prepare, and then I testify for a day, so that’s two days. I kind of do it by-the-day basis. So that’s $6400.
Q. And your hourly rate is still 400?
A. Yes; that’s correct.
Q. Did Mr. Sales or anyone in his firm pay you a retainer for work on the Campbell case?
A. No. And my practice, just so you know, I have gotten retainers in the past. And usually, that’s part of — I actually bill my hours against it. So it’s not like for doing nothing. It’s actually that I work the eight hours. I don’t bill them again.
Q. Number six on the duces tecum asks for all records, summaries, depositions, and other documents excluding the transcripts of depositions taken in this case provided to you for your review by plaintiff's counsel.
Now, we talked about the deposition of Mr. Campbell, I believe, and the deposition of Professor Michel and the deposition of the decedent's sister, Sandella?
A. That's right.
Q. Any other depositions you've reviewed in this case?
A. No, that's it. That's what I've look at.
Q. Have you prepared any written notes on any of those depositions?
A. No, I just read them.
Q. And since you told me you haven't billed yet, I don't suppose you have any invoices related to the Campbell case right now?
A. No, I don't.
Q. Have you drafted any expert reports for the Campbell case?
A. They didn't ask for any expert reports, so I didn't draft one.
Q. Do you know if an expert report has been
provided on your behalf in this case?
A. I haven’t given them one. I have a standard expert report that circulates. That’s kind of a generic expert report that they may have submitted that if they have that from somebody, I didn’t given it to them.
Q. Have you talked with Mr. Sales or someone in his firm at all about your opinions in this case?
A. I described to Mr. Sales the scope and content of my testimony of what I have testified about in the past. He indicated some familiarity with the preservation deposition that was conducted in January when I talked to him on the phone, but I did tell him the subjects that I talked about and the general content of my testimony.
Q. Let’s talk about that generic trial preservation deposition for just a moment. You referenced it was January 2 6th or 27th. Does that sound about right?
A. Sounds about right.
Q. And do you know if for the Campbell case whether you will testify live or whether that trial preservation deposition will be played?
A. It had been my understanding in my conversations with Mr. Sales that he would want me to
come to the trial live.
Q. So you were planning on testifying live,
then?
A. That’s correct; yes.
Q. Do you plan to offer any opinions related to the Campbell case that were not expressed in that generic trial preservation deposition?
A. Well, probably. And you probably have a sense of this already, that generic deposition, the attorney that asked me questions, Howard Acosta, if you recall, took a different tact than most of my trials including the ones that I've done since that preservation deposition. You know, which is fine. I mean, I knew all those things.
In my discussions with Mr. Sales, I got the sense that what I would be talking about would be more inline with what I had discussed in the Hess case and the Sherman case, but, you know, until we sit down and figure that out, he's free to ask me any number of questions.
Q. Sure. What do you think it was that Mr. Acosta did differently in that trial preservation deposition than you would want to do in your testimony in the Campbell case?
A. Well, I've often included in my testimony
a kind of background on the culture of what I call the rise of America cigarette culture, the social history of smoking, the practice of smoking, and issues surrounding that. I mean, that's been a while since I did that, but that wasn't as big a theme in that testimony.
Q. When you mentioned a few minutes ago the testimony you gave in the Hess and the Sherman cases, do you plan to offer any opinions in the Campbell case that you did not offer in Hess or Sherman?
A. Well, I mean, that's a hard question to answer. It just depends on what Mr. Sales or whomever is going to be the attorney that's asking me the direct questions, asks me. I think my opinions are well known. I've testified quite a bit, and I generally stay within a boundary, which I see as clearly within my expertise.
I have not taken any courses in toxicology or anything like that, and so I don't plan to expand into areas that are different than what I've testified in in the many cases which I have testified.
Q. Do you remember testifying recently in a case called Martin, in Pensacola?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you plan to offer any opinions in the Campbell case that you did not offer in the Martin case?
A. Well, the Martin case was a little bit different in that the attorney in that case, Matt Schultz, only asked me questions that really related just to the social history of tobacco use without focusing on some of the areas that I've testified about in the past.
Say, for example, the public statements by the tobacco industry, the role of Hill & Knowlton and that whole issue or the various values of mechanisms that I used to measure; public knowledge, and the public understanding of the risks of smoking at different periods of historical time. So that was a little bit unusual. And maybe just a sliver, just one small theme of what I've testified about in the past.
So to answer, I don't know. I mean, I plan to offer opinions that are generally within the scale and the scope of what I've discussed in tobacco litigation in the last few years.
Q. I think you told me before when I was asking you if you planned offering any opinions in the Campbell case that were different than the ones
in the generic trial preservation deposition back in January, that you told me that you didn’t think that really covered sort of the social history and background culture; is that right?
A. That's right.
Q. So if I take the trial preservation deposition and I add to it your testimony and the opinions you gave in the Martin case, would that include the full sum of your opinions that you might offer in Campbell?
A. Almost.
Q. Okay. What’s missing?
A. And here's what's missing: In both of those cases, I didn't talk about — I'd have to remind myself in the preservation. I can't remember if I talked about the Hill & Knowlton story in the preservation depo.
Also, I didn't discuss polls and survey data, I believe, in either of those trials, and that's a big part of my presentation in other cases.
Q. Anything else you can think of?
A. And, you know, did I do a lot on public statements by the industry and television commercials, and those kinds things? Sitting here right now, and you'll have to forgive me, but I think
the cases, the individual cases, might mean more to you as an attorney than they do to me as an expert witness. I don't mean this in any flippant way, but they do tend to run together.
I'm sorry, I can't give you a satisfying answer on that, because I'd have to say the same thing I said earlier, which is, you know, the general universe of opinions that I've given in the cases that I've testified in the last couple of years would be fair.
MS. LAWSON: All right. Well, we can do this almost as fast. Let's mark this as the next exhibit.
(Defendants' Exhibit 6 was marked for identification.)
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) All right. I'm going to
show you the disclosure that was provided to us for you in this case, and I'm going to ask you to take a look at that.
A. Okay.
Q. Have you seen that before, that document? A. I don't think I've seen this particular document. I've seen this language before in other disclosures, and the language is fine with me. I think it's accurate.
Q. Is that language you drafted or someone else drafted for you?
A. I don't think I drafted this particular paragraph, no. It looks like something that was originally taken from my standard expert report.
Q. All right. You notice on here there's a section titled Generic, and there's a section titled Case Specific; is that right?
A. That's correct.
Q. Under the Case Specific, and I'm just going to read it for the record and I'm going to ask you some questions about it, if that's okay.
A. It is.
Q. All right. It says: Case Specific.
Dr. Kyriakoudes may also be called to discuss the historical issues discussed above as they relate and apply to plaintiff's specific locales, though such testimony is most likely to be illicited by way of rebuttal, if at all. Did I read that correctly?
A. Yes.
Q. What does that mean to you?
A. Well, that means to me what I've often said in the scenarios, and you're probably familiar with, is that I'm not the historian of the plaintiff or the buyer for the plaintiff. I mean, there's
certain aspects of the plaintiff’s kind of objective demographic data that are relevant. And we're talking here, you know, when they were born, where are they located in historical time, and general regional — you know, where they grew up.
But, as that’s been the case in the past, I’m not going to say affirmatively that a particular plaintiff knew or didn’t know any particular fact.
And this is largely driven by the fact that the evidence is inadequate for me as a historian to make that judgment.
Q. Do you have any opinions that you plan to offer at trial that would be specific to Mrs. Campbell?
A. Specific to her?
Q. Yes.
A. Let me be as precise as possible. As I think about this, the only thing would be if I was, say — for example, in the Martin case — asked about the cultural history of tobacco, and at the general time of Mrs. Campbell, you know, and her era of her life. Those kind of questions.
Q. But nothing specific to Mrs. Campbell herself?
A. No, not really. That, again, if we use
the example of knowledge as an issue, I'm not going to say, because I can't because of the lack of evidence, what she definitely knew or didn't know. Someone like her in her time and place, kind of the general public where she may have fit in history, those kinds of things, I would say as I've done in the past.
MR. SALES: And I may ask him questions like is there anything about her family circumstances or her background from your perspective that would have shielded her or insulated her from things that were exposed to others. That kind of thing.
I'm not suggesting he amplify his answer, but just to let you now that that's something that I would — that came up in Dr. Michel's deposition.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) Well, I'll ask you that
question then. Is there anything about Mrs. Campbell that would insulate her from information that was valuable to the rest of the public?
A. Insulate her?
Q. Yes.
A. I mean, she was a person living in a small to medium-sized southern city. I mean, this is how I
think about those things, and that's why I'm indulging in this narrative. You know, she would have had access to national media through radio and television advertising. She would have been, you now, part of that. Insulated, I'm not so keen on that term.
MR. SALES: I was trying to say I'm going to get him to agree that there was nothing special about Pensacola that caused the TVs not to work there and the newspapers not to arrive and so forth.
MS. LAWSON: No, I understand. I'm just putting the question on the record.
MR. SALES: I think we're saying the same
thing.
THE WITNESS: Yes. Yes, you know, she was typical. That's really what I'm looking at. Again, she was from — her father smoked, I recall, from reading the deposition. That's typical of the time period.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) So is it fair to say you
do not believe there was anything atypical about Mrs. Campbell?
A. Not in the broad outlines like I've been outlining. I mean, of course, she was her own unique
person —
Q. Sure.
A. — in that regard. And, I mean, to a degree, we’re all unique.
Q. Right.
A. But the way I look at behavior in groups, she fits in.
Q. So would it be fair to say that you’re not going to opine that she would not have had access to any information that was not generally available to people there in the Pensacola area?
A. Right. Yes. And, again, that's really another way of asking something that I mentioned earlier. I'm not going to say she did or didn't affirmatively not.
Q. Now, back to your disclosure. There are certain topics listed here under the generic disclosure, and I'm going to go through and read those for the record.
I just want to make sure that I know the parameters of the opinions that you're going to offer for the Campbell case. So we'll go over these, and if there are any areas that are left out, I'm going to ask you to tell me about that. Is that fair enough?
A. That’s good, yes.
Q. All right. The subject says:
Dr. Kyriakoudes will testify on the general subject matter of history and demography. Is that correct as it applies to Campbell?
A. Yes.
Q. And do you have any opinions that are specific to the Campbell case on the subjects of demography?
A. That are different from other cases?
Q. That are different from any other case.
A. No.
Q. All right. Just going on in your disclosure, it says: This subject area generally includes the history of tobacco production and consumption, including cigarette consumption, public knowledge, and perception over time of the health risks of cigarette smoking.
Now, I’m sorry, that’s a couple of areas there. Do you plan to offer testimony in this case, in the Campbell case, that's any different than you've offered in Hess or Sherman or Martin on the history of tobacco production and consumption?
A. No, I mean, that hasn't changed. I mean, the history hasn't changed, and I haven't changed my
mind.
Q. Okay.
A. If that's what you're asking.
Q. All right. Do you plan, in the Campbell case, to offer any testimony on the topic of public knowledge and perception over time with the health risk of cigarette smoking that are different than the opinions you offered in Sherman, Hess, or Martin?
A. No. My opinions haven't changed since
then.
Q. Same question for: Cigarette advertising and different information and their impact over time on public perception of cigarettes and smoking.
A. Again, no, there's been no change in my analysis or my conclusions and, therefore, my opinions will be similar.
Q. Do you plan to offer any opinions that are different from those you offered in Sherman, Hess, or Martin on cigarette smoking as a cultural phenomena?
A. No change; the same.
Q. I believe you told me earlier that you read Professor Greg Michel's deposition in this case; is that right?
A. I skimmed through it, yes.
Q. Why did you read that?
A. It was sent to me by the attorney.
Q. Did you ask for it?
A. No, no, he sent it.
Q. Did he tell you why he was sending it to
you?
A. He said that he had conducted a deposition of the defense expert that typically, and this was also my understanding, that typically the order of investigation is the plaintiff's expert goes first and then the defense expert. And he said, I'm sending it to you. So he sent it to me, and I skimmed through it.
Q. Was there anything in Professor Michel's deposition that was relative to your opinions in this case?
A. Relevant? I think my position is well known on the defense opinions, given the article that I wrote. I was surprised and gratified to see that there was a point of agreement between the two of us.
Q. What did you think that point of agreement
was?
A. I'm not recalling the precise language, but there was a line of questioning in the sense Professor Michel agreed with the position I've maintained, which is generally that the cigarette
health issue is a national story and national coverage. I don’t think they use his language, but the meaning there is generally consistent across the country.
Q. Is it your opinion that there was no difference in the portrayal of cigarettes from one community in the United States to another community in the United States?
A. Portrayal of cigarettes?
Q. Yes.
A. I don’t know about that. That’s pretty broad. I could break it down.
Q. Please do.
A. Local attitudes towards tobacco and local attitudes towards cigarettes, there is some variation. Certainly, Durham, North Carolina is going to have a different attitude, let’s say, in 1950. Whereas Winston-Salem is going to have a different attitude towards smoking cigarettes than Provo, Utah.
I mean, there’s hard evidence to, you know, support that. There’s been studies of doctors in North Carolina who are less likely to accept the emerging signs on smoking and health compared to their peers nationally. This is research done in the
'50s and '60s.
I've never made a big point about that in my testimony. What I was really getting at in the earlier line of questioning was that the issue of smoking and health as the press coverage of the emerging science operated in historical times — the ’50s and the 60s and the 70’s — was essentially a national story.
And while there are variations from here to there, for my purposes and for my opinions, those variations have not been significant. And, again, when you go to most local papers when there's a new announcement about the American Cancer Society, it's usually in an AP or UPI or Reuters or New York Times news service story depending upon where and when you're looking at.
So that's really the issue I was talking about more in terms of national media. And, of course, then with things like television news or radio news, those tend to be national network broadcasts. Again, so the local variation in that aspect of the story is not significant.
Your question, again, just to be precise, was a little bit different. And that's about, as I understand, portrayal of cigarettes. I interpret
that to be broader and to include what local attitudes were towards tobacco. There is some variation there. That’s supported by hard evidence.
In my PowerPoint presentation I supplied to you, there is a 1972 Gallop Poll slide. Keep going and I’11 tell you when you get to it. Up at the top, it says, Southern Knowledge Lab, and what that is is that's some Gallup data from 1972 that I recalculated myself broken down by region.
It was essentially South and non-South, and they do see a difference between the response among Southerners and non-Southerners. It's a hard table to interpret. It' s the raw SPSS output. It' s not always the most reader friendly.
Q. Have you looked at any of the newspapers from Pensacola?
A. No, I haven’t done any Pensacola-specific newspaper research.
Q. Since you haven’t looked, you can’t say what was reported in the Pensacola newspapers, can you?
A. No, not in the newspapers, no.
Q. Have you looked at any historical materials specific to Pensacola?
A. I've looked at some photographs of the
city to get a kind of feel for the place. Those I derived from these picture histories. They were used in the Martin case. Otherwise, things unique to Pensacola, no.
Q. The photographs you just referenced that you used in the Martin case, do you plan on using them in the Campbell case?
A. I don't because they're of a different historical period. Mr. Martin was about maybe 13 or 14 years older. And so, for example, I pulled out a picture of Pensacola from the World War II era. Yes, I mean, we could show that picture. It's not a big deal, but I hadn't planned on it.
Q. Did you review any of Professor Michel's reliance materials offered in the Campbell case?
A. No, I haven't reviewed his specific materials, no.
Q. Have you reviewed someone else's materials?
A. I've looked through — I have the reliance materials from other cases of Robert — no, it's Michael Schaller.
Q. Anyone else's?
A. I have Lacy Ford's list. Most of those are familiar to me, so I actually don't have the
actual data, but I do have the actual list that was provided to me, I think, by Gary Paige.
Q. Why did you review Dr. Schaller's materials?
A. Well, keep in mind, I think, it was three DVD disks. Review means put it in the machine, open it up, and look through it a little bit.
Q. Okay.
A. Well, I think it's good to have more information. There’s a lot of stuff in there. You know, a lot of newspaper research and those kinds of things. There’s no point in reinventing the wheel.
So it’s good to have.
Q. Do you think any of the materials from Dr. Schaller's reliance list are relevant to any opinions you may offer in the Campbell case?
A. You mean, would I use them as exhibits?
Q. No. I'm asking, are they relevant to your opinions in the Campbell case?
A. Oh, are they relevant to my opinions?
Q. Yes.
A. Well, this might be a difference between the way a lawyer thinks about this and the way historians think about this. You know, my view is more is better. You know, it there's other
historical materials, I'm happy to have them, especially now that they're in digital form and I'm not overburdened by paper.
Q. Okay.
A. And that's wonderful, but they're not necessary for me to formulate my opinions. I just kind of skim through them. And sometimes there's things in there that, for example, there'll be movie excerpts in there, which I've seen those movies and I have different excerpts, which are not nearly as well done because I do it myself. Yours are a little more professionally done.
I used yours, I think, in one of the cases. I think it was the Ferlanti case. I said, William, mine aren't that good. The sound is out of sync with the video. You know, I'm kind of a sole proprietor. Let's use these that the defense has. They're just better. Someone who actually knew something about video editing did them. You know, that kind of thing.
Q. Did any of Professor Schaller's materials that you saw impact your opinions in any way?
A. No, no.
Q. Do you remember what categories of documents were in Dr. Schaller's materials that you
saw?
A. Well, there were lots of newspapers.
Q. Newspapers. What else?
A. I mentioned some videos.
Q. Movie clips?
A. Movie clips, American Cancer Society, Public Service Announcements, and Heart Association, you know, those so-called Fairness Doctrine Era Public Service Announcements. What else did he have in there ... That's about what I looked at. You know, that came from like local American Cancer Society pamphlets and things like that, which ranked highly in my research methodology.
Q. Do you remember if there were any educational materials from Florida there?
A. Oh, yes, I think there was like the old Florida health notes, the Health Department statements. Some of those are good. I like those.
I believe there's some textbook materials in there and the like. I've seen a lot of that in my own research. Yes, that's in there.
Q. You said just a minute ago the Florida health notes and the Health Department things were in there and those were good, what did you mean by that?
A. Oh, I liked some of them.
Q. What did you like about them?
A. Well, I've seen those before, and I've come across some of them myself. Some of the early-century ones are very interesting.
Q. And what do you mean by that?
A. I probably have those off actually. I believe it's 1906, roughly around there, where they describe the unhealthfulness of cigarettes largely as an exercise in describing in very racist language the unsanitary conditions under which they're manufactured; very anti-Chinese animus. It's actually a good example of typical anti-Chinese hysteria from that time period.
It's actually more important for understanding immigration than it is for understanding the history of smoking and health.
Q. Anything you think that's from the 1906 Florida health notes?
A. 1903, 1906; right around that time. You know, I'd have to dig it out and refresh myself of the exact date, but approximately then.
Q. And what was your recollection of how cigarettes were described in that particular Florida health notes?
A. Like I just said, basically it said don't
smoke cigarettes. They're manufactured in unhygienic conditions. I mean, it's only to describe characterizations by dirty Chinese immigrants. And, again, as I suggested, this is typical of anti-immigrant animus that you would see sometimes at this period of time particularly directed towards Chinese. That was a bit of an issue in American History in the late 19th/very early 20th centuries.
Q. Do you remember if any of those Florida health notes described cigarettes as coughing nails?
A. The exact term, there's one, I think, from 1915. It's got the skull on the cover. They might use it in that one, but I would have to refresh my recollection to know for sure.
Q. Do you know if any of those early Florida health notes described cigarette smoking as addictive?
A. I can't remember. You know, I'd have to refresh my recollection on that.
Q. Would it be significant in any way to your opinions if the early Florida health notes described cigarette smoke as addictive?
A. No. These early notes are typical, and I've described this in my testimony as the anti-cigarette prohibition movement, you know, that
peaked just before World War I and then, of course, quickly dies thereafter for a variety of complex reasons.
No, I mean, it's good to know. Historians are omnivores when it comes to evidence, and I'm delighted to have and consider everything. No, I've long taken that into account. This has been long familiar to me.
MS. LAWSON: Let's go off the record.
(Off the record.)
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) Have you ever heard of a
professor from the University of Vanderbilt named John Geer?
A. From Vanderbilt?
Q. Yes.
A. John Geer?
Q. Yes.
A. From the history department?
Q. I'm sorry, in the political science department.
A. No, that name is not familiar to me.
Q. Are you aware that Professor Geer has been named as a defense expert in the Campbell case?
A. Well, I never heard of him, so I guess the answer to that question would also be no.
Q. Okay. He was specifically named as a polling expert. Are you going to be offering opinions on the Campbell case on the topic of polling?
A. Well, I deal with survey data and polling data in my research, so quite possibly.
Q. And since you’ve never heard of Professor Gear, I assume it’s safe to say you haven’t reviewed his deposition in this case?
A. That’s correct.
Q. Or any of his reliance materials in this
case?
A. That’s correct.
Q. And you don’t know anything about his opinions in this case?
A. That is correct.
Q. Do you know the name of the smoker in the Campbell case?
A. Mrs. Betty Campbell?
Q. Yes.
A. Yes.
Q. And do you know when she was born?
A. I believe it was 1942.
Q. Okay. Do you know where she was born?
A. In Pensacola.
Q. Do you know where Mrs. Campbell lived throughout her life?
A. Well, let me characterize it as, you know, mostly in Florida with pourings into Georgia. She seemed to have a tumultuous childhood in terms of, you know, having lived, I believe, with her sister. Her mother seemed to have health problems, so she moved around a bit. I don't have all the specific moves documented.
Q. Now, you agree, don't you, that newspapers are an important source of information for the public?
A. Yes, they're an important source.
Q. And that would hold true for the 1940s?
A. Yes, it would hold true for the '40s.
Q. And the 1950s?
A. It would hold true in the '50s.
Q. And in the 1960s?
A. Yes.
Q. And in the 1970's?
A. Yes.
Q. And the 1980s?
A. It would hold true. It would be up there — you know, television would be more important, but newspapers are important.
Q. When did television become more important than newspapers?
A. Well, I think pretty quickly. I mean, by the late 1950's, TV ownership is almost universal in the 90-plus range, and people watch a lot of it.
Q. Do you know if Mrs. Campbell read the newspaper?
A. All I know is from what I read in the depositions. And her husband mentions, he doesn't say that she read the paper, but I believe he said she took the paper, the Pensacola News Journal.
Q. Do you know what time period she may have read the paper?
A. I don't recall a discussion of time period in the depositions for which I can get an affirmative answer.
Q. I think you've already told me you haven't researched any of the Pensacola newspapers, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. What newspapers have you researched that you believe might be relevant to what people in Pensacola would have known on the topic of smoking and health?
A. Well, again, my answer would be the same that I've given, say, for example, in the Sherman
case, which is if you look at a paper like The New York Times, which is a paper of record, that gives you an overview of the kind of national coverage on the issue of smoking and health that was occurring in the United States.
Q. Do you recall if the coverage on smoking and health in The New York Times would be just like that in the Pensacola papers?
A. Just like it? No, The Times is going to have more information. I mean, my experience has been that The Times covers the stories more in depth. Hence, the term paper of record. But to the extent it’s a national issue, cigarettes are a nationally advertised product, the general contours are going to be similar. That's based on my review of many other newspapers.
Q. Do you have an opinion as to whether there would have been local stories in the Pensacola papers related to smoking and health that would have been in papers like The New York Times?
A. Oh, certainly there’s going to be local stories. For example, and I'm sure your historians have unearthed this, things like maybe a local presentation. You know, in the 1960s smoking lounges in schools became an issue in many communities. And
so there would be local coverage of those kinds of things.
Yes, so what happened only in Pensacola would be covered in the Pensacola paper. But, you know, similar types of events were happening across the country. And in another local community, what’s happening there, it's going to be very similar in the broad outlines. And it’s going to be covered in their papers as well.
Q. What’s your basis for that opinion?
A. The review of The New York Times deeply and regional papers and local papers, other local papers.
Q. But if you have not looked at the Pensacola papers, you can’t say that what was going on in Pensacola was what was going on anywhere else, can you?
A. You’re correct. I haven’t read the Pensacola papers, so I’m not going to affirmatively say that something was or wasn't in the Pensacola paper.
My point is that this was a national story. And in terms of the national coverage, there’s a broad uniformity to the national aspect of this. You know, the new American Cancer Society
study, say, for example, the big epidemiological study that’s released in the ’50s, that’s picked up by the wire service and covered nationally.
Q. Have you conducted any local research in the Pensacola area as part of forming your opinions in this case?
A. Aside from the photographs? No, no additional research.
Q. And were the photographs done online or were they done in person at a local archive in Pensacola?
A. No. What I did was I got from the library a couple of picture books, a couple of picture history books. Actually, in fact, the attorney discussed pictures. And then I said, Look, here’s some examples. There was one — I’m forgetting that title, but it had been written by an archivist at Pensacola Historical Society.
So, you know, I said, Why don’t you just go talk to this lady. She’ll probably give you as many kinds of pictures that you want. You know, run that errand for me. So that’s how I did that.
Q. So is it fair to say that, I guess, it was Mr. Schultz you were talking about when you said, that attorney?
A. That’s correct.
Q. Did Mr. Schultz get those pictures for
you?
A. Yes. He got a set of pictures after I indicated where to get them from and who our likely contact person was, and I'm forgetting that name.
Then I reviewed them, and I said, Well, these look good.
Q. Did you personally talk with that local archivist yourself?
A. No.
Q. And I think you told me the picture book came out of a library. Where was that library?
A. Well, I got them through — in a library, at my university library.
Q. And which library did you borrow them
from?
A. I don't remember. I also looked at the same book at Barnes & Noble in Pensacola, so that's really where I got the title from.
Q. Since you haven't looked at the Pensacola papers, would it be fair to say that you don't know what sort of cigarette advertisements were carried in the local papers in Pensacola?
A. In the local paper, that would be fair.
Q. Do you know anything about Mrs. Campbell's employment history?
A. Well, I know what I read in the deposition, which is she worked kind of as an administrative assistant at local hospitals.
Q. Do you know anything about her education?
A. Well, she went to high school, and she had some junior college education.
Q. Do you know where she went to school?
A. I thought the high school was named Escambia High School, and the document is in one of the documents I reviewed. I guess, basically her transcript; and then Pensacola junior college.
Q. Do you know what courses she studied in school?
A. All I know is what's on those transcripts that were provided to me by the plaintiff's attorney, and which I brought with me today in computer form.
Q. Do you have any recollection of what subjects she took?
A. In high school?
Q. Yes.
A. Yes. The transcripts say she took the general course of classes that you would take; typical stuff.
Q. Is part of your research in forming your opinions in the Campbell case, have you looked at any of the textbooks that were used in school since Mrs. Campbell attended?
A. I've look at many many health textbooks. What may or may not have been assigned in her school, I may have looked at those, because I’ve look at so many. But I'm not in a position to tell you affirmatively which edition, for example, of Your Health or whatever was used in her school.
Q. Do you know if the topic of smoking and health was taught in the schools that Mrs. Campbell attended?
A. I don't. All I know, all I can infer is what I saw in her transcript. I didn't see a health course, for example, listed on that transcript, so I don't know either way. I don't know.
Q. Would it make any difference to your opinions in this case if the topic of smoking and health were taught in her schools?
A. No. Because, I mean, particularly in the 1960s, not so must in the '50s, but especially by the 1960s, textbooks begin to include what I call effective — well, let me rephrase — not effective, but accurate smoking health education.
You know, basically it's this: I'm a teacher, and when I want to know what my students know, I give them an examination. Then I read that examination. I don't grade their textbooks, and I basically look — that's essentially how I approach this issue. You don't have any indication as to whether the teacher taught that information effectively, whether he or she chose to cover it in the class, whether the students read it.
I mean, you know, so in that sense, it's something to consider. And, I mean, it's something to consider, and I have. But, I think, it's a lot smaller in my analysis than perhaps the defense's story and analysis.
Q. Do you know if teaching on the topic of smoking and health was required in schools that Mrs. Campbell attended?
A. At the time that she attended them, I don't know that. I don't know either way.
Q. Does it make any difference to your opinions in this case one way or the other?
A. Not really for the same reasons that I outlined in the previous answer.
Q. And I think you told me just a few minutes ago that by the 1960s you believe the textbooks were
giving accurate smoking and health education; is that a correct statement?
A. What happens is, and I've said this before and maybe what I said earlier was a little bit inelegant. What happens is is that my review of textbooks is by the 1960s, particularly after the Surgeon General's report, the school health textbooks really begin to get the message about smoking and lung cancer.
You know, you can look at some of the better selling textbooks in the 1940s and the 1950s, and their discussion of smoking and health usually revolves around this is something for adults to do, this could promote nervousness. Not much awareness of the role of cigarettes in causing the kinds of disease that we now know and have known for a while that they do cause.
And, you know, I often use in my exhibits as an example of that in my testimony the late '40s Joint Committee on Health Education and the National Education Association of America and the American Medical Association discussion.
MS. LAWSON: Let's go off the record for a second.
(Off the record.)
THE WITNESS: So that's an example of, you know, in the late '40s at least in the public health best practice is it's not quite making that connection. The sciences, at least from my perspective in terms of the public consciousness, the science is still emerging.
By the ’60s, though, the textbooks do incorporate the Surgeon General's findings in particular.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) Is it your opinion that
in the 1940s health textbooks used in Florida did not teach children about diseases we know are associated with cigarette smoking?
A. Well, again, I can't tie them specifically to Florida, but having reviewed many many health textbooks from the 1940s, generally they're silent on the issue of lung cancer.
Q. What about respiratory problems?
A. I have not seen a reference to emphysema. You know, generally the discussion is vague and indistinct. Things like, well, you know if you're an athlete, this might get your wind. What that means, of course, is hard to interpret. That's fairly vague.
Q. Would it be fair to say then that at least
from the 1940s, you don’t believe the textbooks told children anything more about smoking and health than it will cut your wind?
MR. SALES: Objection to the form of the question.
THE WITNESS: As I alluded to earlier or mentioned earlier, you know, there's often a discussion that, don’t smoke, it might impact — make you nervous. Some textbooks talk about stunting your growth. Some textbooks talk about damaging your eyesight, making your hands shake. A lot of symptomatic issues.
Sometimes there’s references to coughs, smoker's cough. But not the kind of discussion, which I think would be effective like this product accounts for 20 percent of overall US mortality, for example, which would be an accurate statement.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) Does cigarette smoking
account for 20 percent of overall US mortality in the 1940s?
A. No. I mean, it does today. Due to the lag time and the emergent cigarette culture, it had not reached that level then.
Q. And just to go back, I’m not trying to
misrepresent your testimony. I'm trying to understand what you're saying. For textbooks from the 1940s, it didn't tell children anything about smoking and health other than it will cut your wind, make you nervous, stunt your growth, damage your eyesight, make your hands shake, or give you a smoker's cough?
MR. SALES: Objection to the form of the question.
THE WITNESS: As I sit here, I've looked at so many books. Let me characterize it by what I said at the end of my previous answer, which is lots of attention on what I call the symptoms of smoking, not much attention to lung cancer.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) And by symptoms of
smoking, do you mean it will cut your wind, make you nervous, stunt your growth, damage eyesight, make your hands shake, and smoker's cough?
A. Yes, those would be included in that, yes. Q. Anything else?
A. That seems about right. I mean, I may have left one off, you know, an obscure one, but that's the general characterization. That's accurate.
MR. SALES: Objection to the form of the last question.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) Would it be fair to say
that, in your opinion, in the late 1940s, textbooks did not teach children anything other than those list of symptoms you just went over?
A. That's fair. I mean, again, as I sit here, you know, there might be some minor variation of that. There's a lot of textbooks. Yes, I mean,
I'm happy with that.
Q. Okay. Do you have an opinion as to whether in the 1940s textbook used in schools in Florida told children that smoking could be either hard to quit or addictive?
MR. SALES: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Well, the textbooks that I've looked at, when they talk about smoking, generally they describe it as a habit.
Sometimes they describe it a — you know, sometimes they say it's not a healthy habit. Sometimes they say it's a habit that you shouldn't do until you're an adult.
There's some variation there, but generally they call it a habit. There may be a book here and there that describes it as an
addiction, but I'm not thinking of one as I sit
here.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) Do you know if any of the
health textbooks used in Florida before 1950 described smoking as an addiction?
A. Well, I've looked at many text books.
And, again, my answer would be similar to what I've said earlier. I haven't made the connection between the ones that may or may not have been used in Florida as opposed to nationally published books.
Q. So you don't know exactly which textbooks were used in Florida?
A. That's correct.
Q. How about the 1950s, do you have an opinion about how smoking and health was covered in health textbooks in the 1950s?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. Okay. What's that opinion?
A. As a rule, health textbooks were slow to pick up on the emerging science, at least, as it was covered in the press, as I understand it, to have emerged. That's not surprising. Textbooks tend to follow that lead. That's the nature of the genre of textbooks.
By the late '50s, some of them do begin to
incorporate a discussion of lung cancer, for example, and, you know, that kind of serious disease. I'm drawing a blank here on the author of basically the best selling textbook I cite in my expert report, University Minnesota medical professor and then head of American Cancer Society in the state of Minnesota, and perhaps even nationally — Diehl, Howard Diehl. His book goes through a number of revisions. His is basically the best selling textbook of this period.
Q. And that period being the 1950s?
A. That's '40s through the '60s. I believe the title is something like Your Health, but I have to double check the exact title. It's been through many editions. His is an example. It's either the late '50s or the early '60s edition that begin to reflect what I consider to be the message that smoking will kill you.
Q. Do you have an opinion as to when it first began to be communicated in health textbooks that smoking will kill you?
A. Well, generally after the Surgeon General's report textbooks incorporate those findings.
Q. Did they have those findings before the Surgeon General's report?
A. I'd have to double check. With Diehl, the editions that I've looked at, he's probably a little bit ahead of the curve, I think it's the early '60s edition, you know, I think for high school students, it may or may not say that. As I sit here, I can't recall.
Q. Do you have an opinion about when, in health textbooks, smoking was first linked with cancer?
A. Any kind of cancer?
Q. Yes.
A. Well, if you go back to the earlier ones, sometimes there's a discussion of lip cancer and oral cancers. That's a common 19th century item. Whether it's caused by the tobacco or the heat of a tobacco pipe, you know, you've got to look at the particular document, but that's an early one.
Q. And that would have been in health texts from the 19th century?
A. Yes, discussions of health in the 19th century. The issue of textbooks for public schools, that genre doesn't quite exist in the late 19th century. There are other publications that express the idea of health education. They're not strictly textbooks in the way we think of them today.
Q. Do you have an opinion as to when health textbooks for public schools first associated smoking with cancer?
A. Any kind of cancer?
Q. Any kind of cancer.
A. Again, I would never ask the question that way or present it that way. The way I would ask it is, well, what is the dominant message. And my earlier answers hold to that. You can find some early textbooks where here or there they mention oral cancer and throat cancer. Those kinds of things; not lung cancer. That's later from the evidence that I've looked at.
Q. When you say, some of the earlier texts, do you have an opinion as to when smoking was first linked with cancer of any sort in a health textbook for a public school?
A. The first time ever?
Q. Yes.
A. No, I don't have an opinion on that.
Q. Okay.
A. I mean, first? Who knows, I mean ...
Q. Do you know what particular disease Mrs. Campbell had that's at issue in this case?
A. Well, I know, yes, emphysema or COPD is
what's discussed.
Q. Do you have an opinion as to when smoking was first linked to emphysema or COPD, however you want to phrase it, in a health textbook for a public school?
A. Right now, I mean, I've seen reference to it in books in the 1960s, particularly after the Surgeon General's report post-'64. Whether that's the first, I don't know, but certainly it's after 1964. As a new set of textbooks are revised to reflect those findings, it does become part of the discussion.
Q. Do you know if health textbooks from the 1940s told students that smoking can cause respiratory disease?
A. Well, respiratory disease is different.
You asked me about emphysema. I haven't seen one from the 1940s that said it could cause emphysema.
Q. Okay. How about respiratory disease?
MR. SALES: Objection to the form of the question.
THE WITNESS: Well, it depends what you mean by respiratory disease. And again, my earlier answer where we listed things like, you know, getting your wind, if you want to think of
that as respiratory disease, that’s discussed.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) Do you know if health
textbooks from the 1950s — and by health textbooks, I mean, ones used by public schools — told students that smoking could cause respiratory disease?
A. Well, again, my answer would be the same as the one that I just gave you.
Q. Do you know if health textbooks from the 1950s told students that smoking could cause emphysema?
A. You know, what I’ve looked at, I haven’t seen that term emphysema from '50s textbooks. There may be one.
Q. Do health textbooks used in school play any role in your opinions in this case?
A. Well, I gave an earlier answer about how to grade students, and that’s really how I approach it. The issue of health textbooks for me is that, I mean, they’re not a big part of my opinion. That’s probably the quickest way to get to that answer.
Q. Which particular source is the major part of your opinion for this case?
MR. SALES: Objection to the form of the
question.
THE WITNESS: As in all my cases, I rely
heavily on the evaluative mechanisms.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) And what do you mean by
that?
A. Well, I think survey and polling data is good. I mean, you want to know what people know, and that's one way to know.
Q. So you believe polling data is a good reflection of what people know?
A. Well, when you put it that way now, the issue of what a poll measures, there's huge literature on that. And the simple answer is that all a poll tells you is what the poll asks, what the question asks. You have to take into account where it sits in the poll, the questions preceded in particular on that day of the responses.
It is a snapshot and nothing more. And that's assuming that there's been a decent sample, a decent meaning, a random sample of which a representative portion of population has a chance of being included. You know, if there's any sampling bias. But, yeah, I mean, that is a good measure for a historian, because, I mean, we can't go back in time.
That is one of the better sources of evidence that we have for evaluating what people knew
and understood to be the risks of smoking. We have a lot of data in that area. Obviously, the standard public polling like Gallop and Roper, those groups. But then, you know, the massive body of industry conducted polling marketing studies, folks who research, and that body of data, which is fascinating.
Q. I’ve been trying to follow your answer.
Is the question to my answer yes?
A. Polling is a good source for measuring what people know. It's an important one.
MS. LAWSON: Could you read back my last question, please.
(The record was read by the reporter.)
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) So the answer to that
question, is a good reflection of what people know, is your answer yes or is it no?
MR. SALES: Objection to the form.
THE WITNESS: It depends on the poll. You know, taken into account all the caveats that are standard in any textbook and public opinion, polling is a legitimate source for measures of public opinion.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) So I still don't
understand if you've answered my question yes or no.
MR. SALES: Same objection.
THE WITNESS: Well, you’re wanting me to give a kind of generalization, but polls, like any form of evidence, have to be used with great care. I mean, take, for example, there's a recent good book called Methods and Meaning in Polls by a guy named Strauss. It came out a year or two ago. It's a very nice summary.
Polls have to be used with great care.
But, you know, unlike information that was available to the public, polls are a systematic way of measuring what people actually purport to know at the time that the poll is taken. So they are good, but they have to be used with great care. And that's really — so I agree with your question.
My answer is: Yes, with the proviso that the care and the use of the interpretation polls — which I've given some examples, a sampling — with what the question actual says when the poll is taken, is an important source. Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) Okay. So you would agree
that how a question on a poll is worded can significantly impact the responses you get?
A. Absolutely, yes.
MS. LAWSON: Let's go off the record.
(Off the record.)
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) Professor, would you
agree that schools could be an important source of information on smoking and health?
A. Yes. The full spectrum of school, the total experience of school, is an important source of information.
Q. Do you have an opinion specific to Mrs. Campbell about what role school played in knowledge that was veiled to her about smoking and health?
A. Her personally as distinct from the general?
Q. Yes.
A. No, no, I only discuss schools in general.
Q. We talked a little while ago about television, and I think you told me that by the late 1950s television had really surpassed newspapers as the source of information for people?
A. Yes.
Q. Would that include as a source of information on the topic of smoking and health?
A. Yes; all news.
Q. Have you done any research about what was
being said on television in the Pensacola area on the topic of smoking and health in the 1950s?
A. I've researched network broadcasts, national network broadcasts.
Q. Any broadcasts you found from the 1950s?
A. Is that a question?
Q. Yes.
A. What about —
Q. I'm sorry, did you find any national broadcasts on the topic of smoking and health from the 1950s?
A. Oh, yes.
Q. What did you find?
A. Well, and example would be Ed Murrow, See It Now.
Q. Anything else?
A. I researched for the national news through the radio reports transcription service for tobacco industry documents for the 1950's. You know, national broadcasts coverage of the Frank Statement, Good Morning America — I'm sorry, the Today Show, radio broadcasts, and the like. There's extensive documentation of that. Much of which is in my disclosure documents.
Q. You're familiar with the studies done in
the early and mid-1950s by Drs. Graham and Wynder?
A. Wynder, yes; that’s correct.
Q. Were those covered on national news in the 1950s?
A. Oh, yes, those were very news-worthy items.
Q. How about the studies done by Drs. Hammond and Horn?
A. Yes, the American Cancer Society epidemiological studies, yes, those were also important items of news.
Q. And they were covered on the national news broadcasts?
A. They were indeed.
Q. Are they among your reliance material?
A. I referenced as to those studies. I don't have in my reliance materials the actual scientific publications, if that's what you're asking.
Although, I looked at those.
Q. I'm asking actually about the news coverage. The national broadcast you were telling me about that you reviewed, are national broadcast regarding those studies included in your reliance material?
A. Yes. From 1950s, with the exception of
See It Now, I don't have the actual recordings. I have transcripts, but those are in there, yes.
Q. And where did you get those transcripts?
A. From the files of tobacco companies. You know, some of it is through Hill & Knowlton. Some of it is through the industry sources. They would collect the transcriptions of the broadcasts.
Q. Okay.
A. And it's not until, at least, in my research, it's not until the '60s, particularly in this case, the Vanderbilt Television News Archive, which is '60s or early 70's, that you have easily accessible video of all broadcasts. So I relied on the transcriptions for this earlier period.
Q. And those were transcriptions of what?
A. News coverage.
Q. News coverage?
A. Yes. All kinds; the Evening News, radio programs, all manner of material.
Q. You referenced the Vanderbilt Archives a minute ago. Have you been to the Vanderbilt Archives to look at their collection?
A. The television news archives, yes.
Q. And have you found coverage of smoking and health stories in the Vanderbilt Archives?
A. I have, yes.
Q. And is that material in your reliance list or in these materials on the disks you provided to me?
A. Yes; a few examples, not everything that I’ve looked at. You know, you no longer have to go there physically. They have a really good website now, so I access it through their web interface.
Q. Have you gone back to look at the actual video clips?
A. Yes. I've ordered VHS tapes from them.
You can order clips, and I’ve done that.
Q. Have you ever gone physically to the Archives and viewed them there?
A. Yes. I went to school there. Yes, I have, and I’ve been back, yes.
Q. Do you believe what was being recorded on television programs like those you just told me you reviewed had any impact on the information regarding smoking and health that was available to Mrs. Campbell?
A. Well, I mean, to the extent that national news broadcasts reflect national news, yeah. I mean, they would have been part of the information out there.
Q. So you agree that the information in those news broadcasts would have been available to Mrs. Campbell just like everyone else in the public?
MR. SALES: Objection to the form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. I mean, I can't say whether she herself saw any particular broadcast, but a nationally broadcast news program would have been on people's television when it appeared.
I mean, it's different than today where you don't have, this period we're talking about, the 24-hour news cycle. CNN has not yet been invented not until 1980 or '81. I forget the exact year.
So things that are covered on the news, initially news broadcasts were 15 minutes, and they expanded to a half hour. You know, it's not the same as today. But, yes, if it's nationally broadcast, it's out there when it's broadcast.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) Do you know what year
Mrs. Campbell started smoking?
A. Let's see. She was born in 1942. The deposition testimony says around the age of 13. So that's essentially 1955.
Q. Do you have any information about when she began smoking on a regular basis?
A. In my review of the testimony, I'm not sure what regular basis means. I mean, her sister talks about her smoking at 13. I'm not sure what regular means. It's unclear in my review of the testimony.
Q. Do you remember some testimony from her husband's deposition that he didn't realize that she smoked until they had been married for several years?
A. Yes, he did say that, yes.
Q. Does that strike you as unusual?
A. You know, I don't know the circumstances of that. I mean, I think, you could smell — I mean, if you're a nonsmoker, you can smell it. But I'm not privy to their marriage, and so I really can't say either way.
You know, back then when so many more people did smoke, essentially having the odor of smoking on you, somebody could have picked it up from just being at any public place or anyone's home. So people were more acclimated to the smell of smoke back then as a matter of social practice and social convention. So I have no view either way on that.
Q. Do you know if Mr. Campbell smoked?
A. He said he didn't smoke.
Q. Is it fair to say you don’t know why Mrs. Campbell decided to start smoking cigarettes?
A. Her as an individual?
Q. Yes.
A. It’s fair to say that, yes.
Q. And is it fair to say that you don’t know if cigarette advertising played any role in her decision to start smoking cigarettes?
A. Well, you know, my testimony has been and my position is that cigarette advertising is part of the information environment, if you will, that is out there for the public. I can’t say that any particular advertisement made any particular person start smoking. That’s not an area that I — that’s not a question that I feel competent to answer or for that matter anybody.
But I will say the pervasiveness of cigarette advertising at this time, for example, let’s say, dealing with 1955, was such that cigarettes were a legitimate item of commerce that it would seem as a normal item of consumption. And cigarette advertising played a significant role in building the demand for cigarettes as well as shaping the public's knowledge and expectation of how the
cigarette would operate and behave. And for that matter, how to use the cigarette.
So all those things are relevant in advertising, but a particular advertisement to a particular individual, I can’t do that.
Q. So it's fair to say that you don’t know which ads, if any, Mrs. Campbell ever saw for cigarettes?
A. That's correct; her as an individual, yes.
Q. And since you haven’t reviewed anything specific to Pensacola other than the pictures you told me about, would it be fair to say you don’t have any information about particular cigarette advertisements that were published in Pensacola during the 1950s?
A. Well, the newspaper, now, I'm going out on a limb by saying that Time, Life, Newsweek, Reader's Digest — that's a non-advertising question, but I thought I would give you that one — were available to the people in Pensacola. Those are the national magazines in the national press. For that matter, as well, we know billboards were an important form of advertising. Things like that.
Q. The newspapers, I think we've talked about. It's fair to say since you haven't reviewed
Pensacola newspapers, you don’t know what cigarette ads were in the newspapers; is that correct?
A. That would be true. Yes; that’s correct.
Q. And the same question for billboards, do you have any information or any opinions about billboards for cigarette use in Pensacola in the 1950s?
A. All I can say from a national level is that billboard building painting, which means painting the side of buildings, were important venues for advertising for tobacco products and other products as well.
But do I have a list of the billboards and where they appeared in Pensacola? No. But I think we impute that if billboards were part of the national advertising strategy, they were very likely also in Pensacola on the roads leading in and out of town.
Q. But since you weren't in Pensacola in the 1950s, you can’t say they were definitely there, can you?
A. That’s correct; at this point. Who knows, I may find a billing document from where the billboards were. And if I do, I'll let you know.
Q. Okay. Fair enough. Would that same
response also be equally applicable to any other advertising for cigarettes specific to Pensacola?
You can’t say because you weren’t there?
A. Yes. But, again, another form of advertising, things like point of purchase advertising, which were nationally distributed, unless we have pictures of stores and the cash register as a specific principal of business — which, of course, we do have in the case of the Martin case. We have one of those, which had a Philip Morris and I believe a Chesterfield ad that you could make out.
But I'm still within the reasonable methods of my discipline to say that when the American tobacco company or the R.J. Reynolds company mounts a national point of purchase advertising campaign, that it's reasonable to assume that the outlets of cigarette where R.J. Reynolds products were sold probably are going to reflect that campaign.
And by point of purchase, just so that you're clear, I mean, the tabletop displays or the end-of-aisle displays. And often these are made of cardboard that are distributed nationally to promote the product.
Q. But you don’t have any information about any of those sorts of advertisements specific to Pensacola, do you?
A. At this point in time, no.
Q. Do you know if Mrs. Campbell read Time Magazine?
A. I don't know that she did or that she didn't.
Q. How about Life Magazine?
A. I'd have to give the same answer.
Q. Newsweek?
A. Same answer.
Q. Reader's Digest?
A. Same answer.
Q. Do you know if Mrs. Campbell ever saw the Frank Statement?
A. I don't know either way.
Q. Do you know if the Frank Statement was published in the Pensacola newspaper?
A. No, I don't.
Q. And I think you've already covered this, but just to make sure I have it clear for the record, you don't intend to offer any opinions about what Mrs. Campbell believed about smoking and health, do you?
A. Her as an individual?
Q. Yes.
A. No. And on the issue of the Frank Statement in the Pensacola paper, I'd have to review the document that lists where it appeared. It may or may not have, and I'd have to review that document, which is in my disclosure. It's basically the invoice that Hill & Knowlton prepared.
Q. Would it be fair to say that you don't intend to offer any opinions about whether Mrs. Campbell was addicted to smoking?
A. No. That's not my area. So the answer is, yes, it would be fair to say that. I'm not going to give an opinion.
Q. No, you're not going to opine whether she was addicted to smoking?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know if any of Mrs. Campbell's family members ever told her that smoking was harmful to her health?
A. I can't recall. I'd have to review the deposition. There may have been something in there, but I can't recall right now.
Q. Would you agree that family members are a source of information on smoking and health for
people?
A. Yes, they’re a source, yes.
Q. Would it make any difference to any of your opinions in this case if family members did tell Mrs. Campbell that smoking was harmful to her health?
A. No.
Q. Do you know what brands of cigarettes Mrs. Campbell smoked?
A. Well, taking as a caveat a long discussion about brands and a whole second deposition, which seems to be the purpose of which was to identify or sort out Mr. Campbell's recollection of brands, having said that, among the brands that he described she had smoked, which is numerous brands, which I can list a few; Viceroy was mentioned, Chesterfield,
Merit is mentioned, Basic is mentioned, Winston.
Q. Do you know if she smoked filtered or unfiltered brands?
A. Well, in the case of Parliament, which is mentioned, that's a filtered brand. Winston is a filtered brand, Merit and Basic are filtered. So certainly those are filtered. If I'm recalling, because there was a lot of cigarettes mentioned so bear with me for a minute, I recall maybe Pall Mall was mentioned. But it was unclear whether it was the
original Pall Mall, which was, of course, unfiltered or the later manifestation. I mean, it was in the ’50s. It was the unfiltered type. It’s difficult to sort out.
I think the take-away point on her smoking was that she was the kind of smoker that smoked a lot of different brands of cigarettes. I think it's a reasonable imputation from the deposition testimony to suggest or to infer that she probably smoked a lot of different brands, and, therefore, that is the source of the faulty recollection of her husband. Well, I don’t want to characterize it faulty, but the complex recollection.
Q. Does it make any difference to any of your opinions in this case whether she smoked filtered or unfiltered brands of cigarettes?
A. Well, you know, my testimony has been that particularly in the — well, once the health crises — let me rephrase that. The simple cancer scare, to use the language of the documents, emerges that the filter market expands dramatically and that many people turned to filters because they believed that filters would remove what may be harmful.
I'm not going to make an opinion of Mrs. Campbell as an individual, but as an opinion on
the cigarette market itself, that is a historical fact, yes.
Q. And what time period did this health crisis or cancer scare or however you want to phrase it, when did that occur?
A. Well, when I use the term cancer scare, I'm actually adopting the language in the Hill & Knowlton documents. To them the cancer scare really emerges in the fall/winter of 1953 with the mouse skin painting studies, which are not the first studies to make the news from the Wynder and Graham research, but that's the one that really has an impact that is profound. And, of course, the industry mobilizes to address that. So '53 onward.
Q. And did the cancer scare receive a great deal of media coverage?
A. Oh, yes, that's why it was a scare.
Q. So it was a scare because lots of people heard about it; would that be correct?
A. Yes. It was a major item of news. This is why the industry mobilized to get their side of the story out.
Q. And this cancer scare occurred before Mrs. Campbell ever started smoking?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you recall giving a deposition in a case called Lillian Campbell? It would have been on March 31st, 2009, I believe.
A. Lillian Campbell?
Q. Yes. It had been taken by Mr. Geary, I think.
A. That wasn't called Kaplan?
Q. I'm sorry, Kaplan.
A. Yes.
Q. I apologize. If I said Campbell, please forgive me. I meant Kaplan.
A. Yes.
Q. The name Kaplan.
A. I do remember that, yes.
Q. And the opinions you offered in the Kaplan case, do you know if you plan to offer any of those same opinions in the Campbell case?
MR. SALES: It's a little unfair, but can
you be more —
THE WITNESS: Read me the highlights.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) I can be more specific.
A. Yes. I mean, you have the highlighted section. I mean, there's no —
Q. I've got sections. I'm just asking.
Mr. Geary asked you a series of questions, and I
don’t know that they were particularly specific to Kaplan. But one of the questions he asked you was: Whether it was your opinions tobacco companies concealed certain information from the public. And there was a series of questions that relate to that.
Have your opinions about that changed any since the Kaplan deposition?
A. No, that's the same. That helps me. See, I can give you a good answer, then.
Q. I believe you also discussed in that deposition the cancer scare that we were just discussing. Do you remember that?
A. Yes. You know, I helped — be a little more pointed in refreshing my memory when you get to that portion which is highlighted.
Q. One of the questions that Mr. Geary asked was: Members of the public could read and hear about the debate — and I think you were talking specifically about the smoking and health debate — are reading newspapers and watching things on TV?
And you said: That’s correct; radio as
well.
Is that still your opinion today?
A. Yes, I mean, the smoking and health controversy played itself on the national media.
That's what he was asking me about, and that's true.
MR. SALES: Let's go off the record.
(Off the record.)
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) As part of your research
for Campbell and the other Engle Progeny cases, have you looked at a publication called Harper's Weekly?
A. Yes.
Q. And can you describe for me the research you did in Harper's Weekly?
A. Yes. Harper's Weekly is a 19th century weekly magazine. It's kind of a Time Magazine of the 19th century. I went through a database called Harp Week, which covers it from found in 1857 from the time I did it. I think they carried it through the 1870's. I think I looked up key word searches like tobacco, cigarettes, smoking, also things like spittoon. I have an interest just as in my general research in the material called Trip Smoking or more generally tobacco use. So that went to that way in looking for stories on that.
Q. The things that you found in Harper's Weekly, are they included in your reliance materials on this case?
A. Yes; under a subfolder called Common Knowledge and then 19th Century. I have an example
of the research, which I've used in exhibits.
Q. What did you find in Harper's Weekly?
A. First, there's not that much discussion. One story, you know, addressing the idea that cigarettes cause cancer — I'm sorry, tobacco, not cigarettes — placing it in the context of the thought of the times, and that's the example I use.
Also, there's a few other stories that are in there. I didn't denote them all, but here and there. The idea that cigarettes caused — I'm sorry, let me rephrase that. It's not cigarettes. It's tobacco at this time — caused lip cancer, which was an issue we mentioned earlier in this deposition, may have come up in Harper's. It certainly comes up in The New York Times from that time period as well.
Q. Did you find any cartoons related to tobacco?
A. In Harper's?
Q. Yes.
A. I'm trying to remember. There are some cartoons. I may have. It's been a while since I went through this particular document, but there are anti-tobacco cartoons in the press in the 19th century. You do see those.
Q. Do you remember any cartoons in Harper's
Weekly associating tobacco use with death?
A. Harper's specifically?
Q. Yes.
A. Not in that one. I've seen it in other publications, though, at that time period.
Q. How many articles related to tobacco or cigarettes or smoking in the various terms that you told me did you find from Harper's Weekly?
A. I mean, I did this a long time ago. I couldn't tell you the exact number, but it was not many. I mean, for the time period that I looked at, it was not a huge number of stories; occasional.
Q. I heard you use the term common knowledge just a minute ago. What does common knowledge mean to you?
A. Right. It's a term I actually don't like to use, which I've described. What it means to me is and the way I describe it in my article in tobacco control and to summarize it briefly, and this is the way it's used by scholars — I mean, it's a technical definition, so I dote the technical definition from philosophy and gained theory. There's a lot of overlapping disciplines. It's also used in education.
It is a mutually acknowledged state of
understanding among two or more parties. So the criterion technically for common knowledge are: I have to know it and know that it's true. You have to know it and know that it's true. And then I have to know that you know and you have to know that I know. That's the mutually acknowledged.
So that's really what it means. I mean, that's not my definition. That's what the scholarly definition of what common knowledge is.
Q. I think you testified before that for there to be common knowledge, you have to have a hundred percent knowledge among the community? Is that fair?
A. Well, what I do is I infer from that, well, look, you know, I mean, if everybody knows, that's the technical definition. Everyone has to know. So, yes, a hundred percent, but then I offer a little caveat because I'm a data guy and a statistics guy. Let's have some measurement error. So let's take maybe two standard deviations from the meaning on a normally distributed population, which depending upon the details, gets you about 95 percent. So that's what I do.
In the Bifolk deposition, which we mentioned earlier, the attorney asked me at length a
series of questions and that's basically the short answer for that.
Q. Do you believe that most people now understand that smoking can be associated with lung cancer?
A. Oh, yes, now most people — I mean, this is the issue: If you do a public opinion poll and, say, you ask the old original question, do you think cigarette smoking is one of the causes of lung cancer; I mean, yes, you’re going to get a very very high rate of affirmative response on that.
Q. When do you think it was that people came to associate smoking with lung cancer?
A. When you say most, give me a level.
Q. You use your definition of most.
A. Okay. Great. Yeah. My position on this is that the public begins to get the message and really begins to understand and know the dangers of this product. The turning point comes in the mid-to-late ’70s. And after that, the period of smoking really begins to take a steep decline. I mean, the total consumption of cigarettes in the United States peaks in 1982.
I think behavior, and you haven't asked me this, but I'll tell you, I think behavior is an
important evaluative mechanism of knowledge. And so, you know, the term comes in the ’70’s. It takes a while. I mean, it doesn't happen all at once, but that’s really when the public, really as a group, begins to get the message.
Q. Do you believe people’s beliefs are always manifested in their behavior?
A. Always?
Q. Yes.
A. I think behavior is a good way to look at belief when you look at large groups of people. Like group behavior, I think that is another powerful source as a historian.
Q. Would it be fair to say that your opinion is that people began to stop smoking when they learned that smoking could harm their health?
MR. SALES: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, at the population level, yes. When more of the public begins to really understand the dangers, then you do see a significant change in the trend in smoking behavior, yes.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) Do you know what
percentage of the population smokes today?
A. The exact number, I'd have to check, but
it’s around 22-1/2 to 23 percent nationally. The male/female figures, it's slightly lower for females. It's probably higher for men. State prevalence varies. I think Utah and California are on the low end. Kentucky is on the high end.
Q. Do you believe that people that smoke today do not understand that smoking can be harmful to their health?
A. I think that for many people, particularly teenagers, which is typically the age that people develop a nicotine addiction through cigarettes, I mean, that’s just a statistical reality, they don’t completely understand the full extent of the health risks.
Yes, I do think that there are still gaps in knowledge. I mean, they're much less than they were, say, in 1955, but, yes, there are still gaps in knowledge among certain populations; misperceptions, misunderstandings, yes.
Q. What gaps and knowledge do you believe still exist?
A. Well, I think, as a general rule, particularly for young people, and again this is just simply in the social science research on this issue and the paper research, one of the things that
scholars have found is that young people won’t — you know, they’ll respond to very high rates affirmatively, oh, smoking is dangerous, but they don’t understand.
This is the problem with polls. They don’t give you a complete answer or any one poll doesn’t give you a complete answer. What they don’t understand, typically misperceived are, one, the full extent of addictiveness of the product. And the other is the fact that it’s not the one cigarette that they're smoking that is the risk. It's not an individual cigarette risk. It is a cumulative risk that is incurred over a significant period of time.
And, again, there is a good discussion of this current, you know, 1989 and the 1989 Surgeon General's report, the fourth chapter. It has a nice discussion of these issues. And again, I'm dealing here historically because I'm a historian. Although, I do read about temporary tobacco control issues.
What's going on right now is not my principal area of research.
Q. I think you told me one of the areas where you believe there's a gap in knowledge still is about, I think you said, the full extent of addictiveness of smoking; is that right?
A. Well, today that's my sense of things. Although, I don't intend to opine on the current state of 2009 tobacco awareness.
Q. What is the basis for that opinion that you have?
A. As a historical — well, you know, there's some good survey research on this. Some of it is conducted by your client, R.J. Reynolds Company, on what people understood the addictiveness of smoking to be. There's discussion of this in the public health literature in the 70's and '80s.
Q. I think you said surveys or studies done by Reynolds?
A. Yes. There's a good one. There's a good survey.
Q. Can you name it for me?
A. It's in my reliance. I've used it in my demonstratives. It's the old habit versus the addiction polling question, I believe, from 1981 or '82. I think '82. You can get the full citation in the subcategory called Polling. There's a PowerPoint in there where I've taken the raw polling data and put it into graphic form, Excel. Simply, I made a spreadsheet out of it. The Reynolds document is there with the full citation.
Q. I think you also said some public health literature. Can you name that for me?
A. Yes. Well, the best guide to that is the United States Surgeon General Report, which has a very comprehensive summary of the state of research and public understanding on the risks of smoking.
Q. What is the earliest reference you found in your research linking smoking or tobacco use as an addiction?
A. I mean, now, I use the term addiction. I mean, I'm no toxicologist. I'm not a scientist. I mean, it's described as a habit in most of the popular press. That is the typical way that it's described. Sometimes people use the term addict, I'm a nicotine addict. You know, there's a movie called Saboteur, which is an Alfred Hitchcock film from the ' 40s .
Q. And that movie uses the term nicotine addict, right?
A. Yes. So obviously that phrase, some of the discussion, if you look into — is it James Harvey Kellogg or John Harvey Kellogg? I'm going to get the first name wrong. Kellogg, who was a Seven Day Adventist, Battle Creek Michigan anti-tobacco advocate, he uses that term, I seem to recall.
That would be going back to the era of the 20th century. I mean, you know, the first and the kind of gotcha, that's not how historians look at things. You know, we look at what is the dominant mode of discourse on this, and habit is the dominant mode of discourse until very recently.
Q. Have you done any research on the definition of the word habit as used in popular culture?
A. Well, you know, in reading the term habit, it's contextualized within the discussion of historical documents. So, yes, the answer is yes.
Q. What is your understanding of what habit meant to the general populace in the 1940s?
A. Well, you know, there's a nice little discussion of it, that later, if you go to 1953, there's a Reader's Digest story on how to stop smoking. I think, Brean, he had written a book and he was kind of getting the word out about that book. He says it's a habit. He says it's not physically addicting like — I'm drawing from memory here, but I think he used the reference to opiates, which we know, of course, is not a good example. He says it's a habit, that when you stop using it, it makes you feel uncomfortable like not having three meals a day.
Things like that.
So I think for the mid-20th century, that's a reasonable definition of a habit. Something of which the cessation of the activity makes you feel uncomfortable.
Q. Did most of the people in the 1950s in this country know that if you tried to stop smoking, it would be hard to do?
A. Hard to do, not difficult to quit. For some people — the evidence on this is very sketchy. It’s clear to me that for some people, they interpreted quitting smoking as something that was hard to do. But most of the antismoking people say just stop. They tended to downplay the difficulties involved with smoking.
It is clear, though, that there is no discussion information that reflects what would become the medical consensus on how difficult it was actually to quit smoking. I'm just drawing upon my reading of the 1988 Surgeon General's report. Again, I'm not a toxicologist or an addiction specialist, but, yes, generally it's a habit. And like any habit, just willpower would stop it. You could just stop.
Q. We talked earlier about some national
magazines that you mentioned to me like Time, Newsweek, Life, Reader's Digest. Do you remember that?
A. Yes.
Q. And those were circulating in this country in the 1950s, right?
A. Yes, it was.
Q. And were there not a number of articles in each of those publications during the 1950s that told people that it could be really hard to quit smoking?
MR. SALES: Objection to the form.
THE WITNESS: Really hard? Nicotine?
Gene Tunney says, Look, just quit. You know, just quit cold turkey and stop doing it. I did it. You should do it, too. That's what they told them.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) Did they tell people it
would be hard to quit?
MR. SALES: Same objection.
THE WITNESS: Some said it might be hard for you to quit, but that, you know, with willpower you could quit. That was the message. They didn't say it was an addiction. Again, addiction meaning a physiological dependence process. Again, I'm not a scientist, so I don't
understand all the chemical biology behind that. Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) Even if they didn't use
the word addiction, did they tell people it would be hard to quit smoking?
MR. SALES: What's the "they" now? I've lost track of —
MS. LAWSON: The magazines that we listed before.
THE WITNESS: Some did, no doubt. But the general tenor of the discussion, the typical answer was what I said earlier, which is, while it may make you uncomfortable to quit, you know, with willpower and simply quitting, you could quit.
There are all manners. I mean, there are people trying to get people to quit smoking. Brean, for example, he's got a book on how to stop smoking. And there's others telling you don't worry about it. I mean, yes, there's a welter of information out there. Much of it contradictory particularly in the 1950s.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) In what way was it
contradictory?
A. Well, there was lots of information in the press saying don't worry about it, smoking isn't a
cause of disease. You know, smoking is easy to quit. And some say the opposite, that it is a cause of disease and that it' s a habit that you should give up.
Q. I think you just told me, and forgive me, I'm not trying to mischaracterize your testimony, but I'm trying to understand it, you believe that in the 1950's there were lots of things in these magazines saying smoking isn't a cause of disease?
A. Oh, yes, there's a long narrative. I mean, I've testified to this frequently. There's a long narrative. Much of it, although, not all, much of it originates from the industry calling into question the science implicating smoking a disease.
Q. Do you have any opinion about how many articles there were in these magazines we've just listed saying that smoking is not a cause of disease?
A. Or calling into question the science linking smoking with disease, you mean a number?
Q. Yes.
A. No, I don't have a number. I mean, it's a frequent part of press coverage in the 1950's, especially.
Q. Do you have any opinion about whether there were more articles linking smoking and disease
or more articles disputing smoking and disease?
A. Well, I mean, an article can do both. So, you know, you’re not dealing with two discreet categories, which is the problem with content analysis, which I've never been comfortable with because it's whatever code and scheme you come up with. It’s too much of a garbage in/garbage out.
There's people in school of journals that won’t disagree with me on that, but I'm really not high on context analysis as a reasonable method to come up with the kinds of answers that, as a historian, I would need. And that's coming from a guy that's very comfortable with quantitative analysis.
Having said that, you know, you have a welter of stories coming out some calling into question the science linking disease. Some say don't worry. Some say it causes lung cancer. Some say it's pollution. Some say it's constitutional. It's genetic.
They don't use the term genetic. Constitutional is a 1950s term, which essentially meant the same thing. Some say, yes, it cuts life. The American Cancer Society is saying our new research, we have to release it early because the
findings are so clearcut.
It's all over the place in the 1950s.
It's really that kind of wide open confusing debate.
Q. Do you plan to offer any opinions in this case as to whether there were more articles in the 1950s disputing smoking and disease links or more articles in the 1950's saying there is a link between smoking and disease?
MR. SALES: Just so I'm clear, you mean like account? Like which were there more of?
MS. LAWSON: Number, numberwise.
MR. SALES: Anywhere?
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) In the materials that
you've reviewed.
MR. SALES: I'm sorry, thanks.
THE WITNESS: No, I'm not going to offer an opinion on that for the reasons I described earlier in my answer about content analysis.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) So would it be fair to
say you do not plan to opine in this case that there were more articles in the materials that you reviewed disputing a smoking and disease link as opposed to articles that said there is a link between smoking and disease?
A. Right. Because I think to offer a number
like that, no matter what the number was, does not say anything important about this debate, because you’ve got to look at the stories as they unfold in historical times and in context. I mean, you simply kind of weigh these things no matter which way they go. That’s ahystorical. That tells you nothing.
Q. So would you not believe it important if there were more stories in the public media linking smoking and disease?
A. Well, it depends. I mean, this is the historical part. It depends. Certainly you would agree that the Surgeon General’s report, that story is more important. The release of that report in January of ’64, that report is more important than other stories; to use an example that is important. That’s a big story.
So not all stories are equal. It’s just not. It would not lead to reliable usable results to do that. That’s my opinion. You’ve got to look at how it unfolds in historical time.
Q. When you say that not all stories are equal and you use the example of the Surgeon General’s report, you would agree that was a big story, right?
A. That was a big story.
Q. Why was it a big story?
A. Because it was covered on the front page of every newspaper I ever talked about either that afternoon, if they had an afternoon edition. It was released on a Saturday or on the next day on the Sunday paper.
That was a story that had been followed for some time because of the whole progress of that, the Advisory Committee, was an item of newsworthy interest on a subject that people were deeply interested in because the majority of Americans smoked. So the overwhelming majority of men, not the majority of women at this time, but overall the majority of the population.
Q. And was the source of the information one of the things that made it important? The fact that it was the Surgeon General of the United States?
A. Sure. The Surgeon General is the Surgeon General. That was something to consider. Yes, that's important.
Q. Would you agree that different sources have different measures of credibility with the public?
A. It depends. Again, you have to look at these things in historical time at certain points,
Q. On the topic of smoking and health, would you agree that the credibility of the information would be dependent upon the source?
A. Credibility is a factor. You know, volume is a factor. I mean, here's the problem, and maybe this will clarify this whole line of questioning, you've got in the '50s and the '60s, which is the period we're talking about, you've got information saying don't smoke, it's dangerous. That's coming from the public health community first.
Slowly in time it begins to come from government. Leroy Burney says, well, I'm not saying you should quit smoking in 1957/'58. So, you know, it's a lot of qualifications. So you've got people saying don't smoke, but then you've got lots of information that says it's okay to smoke. Some of that information is coming through the press. You know, say, TIRC and all that. You know, Clarence Little says, Well, the statistical data, not good.
Men are not mice. Those newspapers stories.
But the other source of information that says it's okay to smoke is this massive advertising campaign. That's also information to the public media. You know, 40-plus percent sponsorship of
every television program in 1960 and the back page of nearly every issue of Life Magazine with a Coke can elbowing and throughout that magazine and every other — just about every other magazine, not Reader's Digest, so I anticipate your next question. And so, that's what's going on.
And then on top of that, you’ve got social practice and social acceptability, which is in essence another thing that’s supporting the cigarette culture. So you specifically take these newspaper stories like the objective news stories and kind of weigh them, it doesn’t tell you anything. And that’s the reason why it doesn’t tell you anything.
They call it the newspaper because it’s news. What's new. They don't call it the oldspaper. They don't tell you what you already know. They tell you what is new.
Q. Do you believe that if offered an article, let's just take the Wynder and Graham study with the painting of the mice, an article on that and how cancer was produced on the backs of the mice when painting them with cigarette tar, would that have the same credibility for someone in the 1950s on whether smoking could be a cause of disease as a cigarette advertisement?
MR. SALES: Objection to the form.
THE WITNESS: One on one?
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) Yes.
A. They’re not the same thing. What you’ve got is the relentless cigarette advertiser, and you’ve got one newspaper story or one magazine story one time in Life Magazine. Say, for example, if we take the December Life Magazine, which features the mice, now, that story is published and then it stops. And what’s on the back cover of that Life Magazine?
A cigarette ad. Throughout that magazine, there’s cigarette ads.
So, you know, one on one, that don’t work on a one-on-one equivalency. And that’s what makes advertising such a powerful instrument of persuasion. It’s heft. You know, it’s just the sheer volume that shapes the culture.
Q. Is it your understanding that people in the 1950s were taking their information on smoking and health from advertisements?
A. Some people were, yes. Particularly when cigarette advertisements contain health information, yes .
Q. What’s your basis for that opinion?
A. The review of the content of the
advertisements and behavior, smoking behavior.
Smoking increases in the 1950s, and also even performance — or let me rephrase that, not performance. Even polling data in the 1950s it supports, at least in terms of the public, increasingly holding skepticism towards the cigarette disease theory.
Q. What polling data from the ’50s supports your opinion that people were getting their information about smoking and health from advertisements?
A. Well, it’s not a one-on-one, you know, kind of clear cut.
Q. Well, explain it to me, if you would.
A. Yes. One of the things you would find in the 1950s is on the standard Gallop Poll question, do you think cigarettes are one of the causes of lung cancer, for me, about 1955 to the end of the decade, those responding in agreement with that, particularly among smokers, which is the population I think that's relevant here in terms of the denominator of a measure, it actually falls. So it actually declines. I mean, I've got a nice little graph indicating such in my exhibits.
And, you know, my position is that the
public looked to the advertisements and that they relied on them. And for that matter, that was a position held by the industry that the public can rely on the advertisements. And when those advertisements included health information, they relied on health information.
Q. So the polling questions you just pointed me to are the basis for your opinion that in the 1950s people were taking their information about smoking and health from advertisements?
MR. SALES: Objection to form.
THE WITNESS: I’ve already answered your question. I can say what I just said. I'm not trying to be nonresponsive.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) I'm just trying to
understand the basis for your opinion.
A. You know, there isn't — I've not seen a polling question where they say, do you agree with the statement I get my health information from cigarette advertisements. It doesn't work that way.
I suspect if you ask people that, they'd probably say no. Most of them would say no. The way it works is the public's perceptions of the product are shaped heavily by advertising.
So in that regard, advertising is
persuasive. And when advertising has health-related information in it, it works to persuade a portion of the population that way, particularly smokers.
Q. Do you hold yourself out as an expert on the topic of advertising?
A. A history of advertising as a historical phenomena, yes. I mean, I deal with that. I've published on that.
Q. What research have you done to support your opinions about, I think the way you termed it was, persuasiveness of cigarette advertisement during the 1950s?
A. Well, I've look at extensively cigarette advertising. I mean, I've looked at lots of ads. I mean, thousands of them. I've looked at consumption data for cigarettes, I've look at changes in the market mix of types of cigarettes. I've looked at industry evaluations of the success of their publicity campaigns. You know, I mean, from a historical perspective, I've looked at this from a variety of different views.
Now, again, I don't design advertising campaigns. I'm not going to tell you what a particular ad had on a particular person, but ads had a historical phenomenon. I mean, it's a pretty clear
issue. Since you don’t have a pending question, let me take a pit stop.
MS. LAWSON: Go ahead. Let's go off the record.
(Recess from 12:28 p.m. to 12:40 p.m.)
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) Okay. I know you were
outside talking with Mr. Sales about airbags when we were on break. Did you discuss anything related to your opinions in this case while you were out there? A. No, I did not.
Q. Or anything regarding to your opinions related to smoking and health?
A. No, nothing relating to the reasons why we're here.
MR. SALES: Well, actually we talked about Aspirins and Reye Syndrome.
MS. LAWSON: Airbags, Aspirin, and Reye Syndrome?
MR. SALES: Right.
Q.	(By Ms. Lawson) Okay. When was it that
you were first approached by doing research for smoking and health?
A. I've answered this many times. You can refer to my prior testimony. Early in 1998 or in late 1997 or over the Christmas break.
Q. When you were first approached, were you given a particular historical question to research?
A. I was called by an attorney, Louis Fondren who I've mentioned, who he was interested in the nature of the corporate relationship between Brown & Williamson and British American Tobacco. That's, in fact, the first thing he wanted me to look into.
I looked into that. And then as part of that, I saw that the issue of public knowledge or the public's understanding or common knowledge, the terms vary, was big. He later asked me about that, but I had already begun looking into that on my own, but 1998.
Q. When you're talking about, I think you said, common knowledge or public awareness and health effects of smoking, was there any particular historical question that you framed for yourself regarding that subject?
A. Oh, yes, the same question that I've used throughout this, which is what did the public know and understand to be true and what portion of the public understood. The public is not one person. We're dealing with tendencies and quantities. What were their knowledge, how-tos, and beliefs about cigarettes generally and in particular cigarettes
relating to the question of cigarettes unhealthful aspects at certain periods of time in history in the United States.
Q. And has that research question ever changed?
A. No, it’s pretty much the same thing I’ve looked into. It’s gotten more sophisticated particularly as I’ve done my own work on this in the sense that I've branched out. I mean, this is not so much a testimony thing, but just in terms of understanding this, I'm looking at it from different angles, material cultures, social practice rituals of smoking, you know, behavior. Now, that, we've talked about. So you attack the problem from every possible vantage point that is supported by evidence.
Q. Once you got the historical question that you've described to me, how did you go about developing a research strategy to answer that question?
A. Sure. You review what has been published on the subject; not much at the time, very little. I reviewed the standard histories of smoking. At that time the two best books were an older book by a guy named Sobel, Robert Sobel called Satisfied. And there was a new book that came out called Ashes to
Ashes that came out in ’98, ’99. I forget the exact year. When that came out, I made myself read that book. What’s the author’s name — Joe Kluger is the last name.
I reviewed what I thought were systematic sources of data. I went to polling. And at that time I went to the obvious polling sources, which were the Gallup reference volumes. Gallup publishes these reference summary volumes. I mean, this is at the very beginning of the process to ascertain what attitudes and beliefs were over time.
Later, I went to, when I had access to the online Roper Center Archives, I used those. And since, I relied heavily on that because you could get the raw data and manipulate it yourself.
Eventually I began reviewing the civil public information press. Things like that. You know, kind of went step by step by step. Industry documents, they have a lot on public knowledge and public understanding as well.
Q. Anything else?
A. I began watching movies. I began looking at advertisements, television commercials that offer six hours of TV commercials on VHS from video resources at the archiving company. That would have
been around 2001, I guess. I’m constantly building my knowledge base on this.
Q. Do you have any specific methodology used for forming your opinions in this case, the Campbell case?
A. That are distinct from prior cases?
Q. Yes.
A. No, I have nothing that's distinct and unique in this case in terms of methodology.
Q. So you follow no methodologies specific to the Campbell case?
A. Right; that is any different than any other historical opinion I’ve given related to smoking and health in litigation.
Q. And you’ve told me several times today that your work is ongoing; is that right?
A. Well, yes, I'm always learning new things. Yes, I mean, I'm always learning new things. That's true, so it is ongoing.
Q. Do you believe you've done sufficient research to offer the opinions that you've given me here today for the Campbell case?
A. Yes, I have.
Q. Do you think that there's any other research that you could do that would change any of
the opinions you’ve offered to me today?
A. No. I mean, there isn't.
MS. LAWSON: That's all the question that
I	have.
MR. SALES: I don't have anything. Bruce, do you have anything?
MR. TEPIKIAN: I do not.
MR. SALES: I don't have any questions. (Deposition concluded at 12:50 p.m.) (Pursuant to Rule 30(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and/or O.C.G.A.
