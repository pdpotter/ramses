1	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time now is
2	approximately 9:12. We're now on the record.
3	JAMES KIRBY MARTIN,
4	having been first duly sworn, testified as follows:
5	EXAMINATION
6	MR. KRAUS: Ron, could we do a couple
7	of --
8	MR. MOTLEY: Sure.
9	MR. KRAUSE: -- preliminary requests
10	before we start? One is that I want to make sure
11	that we all recognize that Magistrate Gold directed
12	that there will be another four hours of examination
13	and only four hours.
14	MR. MOTLEY: That's my understanding
15	is that's correct.
16	MR. KRAUS: And secondly we had an
17	agreement in the first -- during the first two days,
18	since this deposition was cross-noticed in Falise and
19	NAW, that an objection by any one attorney would be
20	deemed joined in by all so that we would avoid the
21	chorus of objections. Is that all right with you?
22	MR. MOTLEY: That's fine with me.
2	3	MR. KRAUS: That's all I have.
24	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) I suppose we ought to
page	7
page	8
1	introduce ourselves on the record. My name is Ron
2	Motley, Professor Martin, and with me are Jodi
3	Flowers and Ann McGinness Kearse -- she insisted
4	McGinness be placed on the record, since she's from
5	County Cork in Ireland.
6	A. Okay.
7	Q. And also appearing is in Tammy Cauley.
8	She's not an attorney; she's a legal assistant.
9	What courses do you teach at the
10	University of Houston that relate to history, sir?
11	A. Well, over the years I've taught a whole
12	variety. I've taught for 31 years, both at Rutgers
13	University in New Jersey and at the University of
14	Houston, and so I can -- why don't I start at the
15	undergraduate level and work up. I think that -- at
16	the basic level I teach -- and I teach and I have
17	taught courses in the first and the second half of
18	U.S. history. The dividing line is normally the end
19	of the Reconstruction period to 1877, from 1877.
20	I've taught that course repeated over the years. I
21	can't tell you how many times.
22	I've taught a variety of special
23	topics courses, everything from conservative thought
24	in America to violence in the American experience, page	8
page	9
1	topical kinds of courses which you would use to try
2	to attract individuals to the subject of history.
3	I've taught at the upper division undergraduate level
4	courses in Colonial and Revolutionary America and the
5	primary bulk of my teaching -- and also, again, a
6	variety of upper division undergraduate seminars,
7	such as this particular upcoming semester I'm going
8	to be a teaching a course in addiction and disease in
9	the American experience, which will be a seminar for
10	15 students, for undergraduates.
11	At the graduate level I teach, again,
12	a whole variety of courses, mostly in recent years
13	courses dealing with introduction to research and
14	writing in United States history and then advanced
15	research and writing in United States history. And
16	to briefly describe those courses to you, the
17	function there is to help students to find topics in
18	all fields of United States history and then help
19	them get launched at the beginning level, help them
20	get launched into their research topics. At the more
21	advanced level, to work with students on topics from
22	A to Z to help prod them along as they work on their
23	Master's thesis and their dissertation. So that
24	would be kind of a rundown of some of what I've
page	9
page	10
1	taught over the years.
2	Q. Did you describe yourself -- let me
3	rephrase this.
4	You have provided with us a current
5	curriculum vitae. Is that correct?
6	A. Yes. I believe that's the case. I don't
7	believe I have provided the whole vita, but I have
8	provided selected pages from it.
9	Q. In any earlier iterations of your
10	curriculum vitae, have you ever described yourself as
11	a social historian?
12	A. Yes, I have.
13	Q. Beginning when, sir? Do you recall?
14	A. I would say, as a social historian, that
15	would go back to the period of the 1970s. Certainly
16	that would relate to the kind of work I've done with
17	the Rutgers Center of Alcohol Studies, where we tried
18	to study the social history of drinking in America.
19	And that particular work, in turn, led to my
20	involvement with New York University Press and we
21	began a series of books back in -- monographs, I
22	guess you would call them, academic monographs back
23	in 1983, '84. I don't remember the exact year. And
24	the title of that is The American Social Experience. page	10
page	11
1	That is the title of the series. There are now 39
2	books published in that series, and I serve as
3	general editor for that series.
4	Q. The book you coauthored on drinking.
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. What was the title on that?
7	A. Drinking in America. The subtitle was A
8	History. I think it's something like 1620 to 1980.
9	The book initially appeared in 1982.
10	Q. You authored a chapter in that book?
11	A. No, I -- we co-wrote the book.
12	Q. Did you write any particular chapter
13	yourself?
14	A. What we did in terms of our operating
15	methodology, we would do rough drafts, work on the
16	rough drafts together, then we would divide out
17	certain subjects and try to write those particular
18	subjects up but the -- all the chapters in that book
19	are a true collaboration of two people.
20	Q. Have you published as of today any papers
21	in peer-reviewed social scientific journals relating
22	to cigarette smoking?
2	3	A. No. No, I have not.
24	Q. Have you published a peer-reviewed article
page	11
page	12
1	in any social science journal since 1972?
2	A. In any social science journal?
3	Q. Yes. Peer reviewed.
4	A. Since 1972?
5	Q. Yes, sir.
6	A. I'm sure I have but --
7	Q. Memory fails you?
8	A. I -- my vita is there. I guess we could
9	look at that.
10	Q. Okay. Sir, have you followed the media
11	reports of a case that was tried for a period of two
12	years in Miami, Florida, called Engle, E-N-G-L-E,
13	versus Philip Morris?
14	A. I didn't follow it specifically, no. I've
15	severe various -- I mean, I've seen various news
16	reports on television. I've seen reports in the
17	local paper, which is the Houston Chronicle.
18	Q. Have you been retained in this case by any
19	law firms?
20	A. In the Engle case?
21	Q. No, sir, in this case, Falise.
22	A. In this case, yes. Yes.
23	Q. Which firm, sir?
24	A. In the Falise case, Womble, Carlyle, page	12
page	13
1	Sandridge & Rice.
2	Q. Okay. And are you appearing here
3	exclusively on behalf of R. J. Reynolds?
4	A. I'm not appearing here on behalf of
5	R. J. Reynolds. I'm appearing here on behalf of
6	Womble, Carlyle, Sandridge & Rice.
7	Q. Okay. Who do they represent?
8	A. So far as I know, they represent
9	R. J. Reynolds.
10	Q. Are you appearing -- is your testimony
11	being adopted by Philip Morris, for example?
12	MR. KRAUS: Objection. Calls for
13	speculation on his part.
14	A. I really don't know how to answer that
15	question.
16	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) When you testified in the
17	iron workers' case, what firm retained you. Do you
18	recall?
19	A. Yes. Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue.
20	Q. And who were they representing?
21	A. I believe they were representing
22	J. R. Reynolds.
23	Q. Have you ever been retained by a law firm
24	that represented Philip Morris? page	13
page	14
1	A. I'm not sure how to answer that question.
2	I'm trying to be honest with you. I really don't
3	know.
4	Q. Okay. Well, let me try giving you some
5	names of law firms. Shook, Hardy & Bacon. Does that
6	name ring a bell?
7	A. Yes, it does.
8	Q. Have you ever met with lawyers who came
9	from Shook, Hardy & Bacon?
10	A. Yes, I have.
11	Q. And did you understand who they
12	represented?
13	A. Yes, I -- thank you for -- that helps me.
14	This -- yes, Phillip Morris, as a matter of fact.
15	Yes.
16	Q. Have you ever met the gentleman -- and I'm
17	sure I'm going to do disservice to the pronouncing of
18	his name but I believe he pronounces it Sismancheck
19	(phonetically) --
2 0	MR. WAGNER: Szymanczyk.
21	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Szymanczyk, the chief
22	executive of Philip Morris, USA?
23	A. Have I?
24	Q. Yes. page	14
page	15
1	A. No.
2	Q. Have you been told that Mr. Sismancheck
3	(phonetically) --
4	MR. WAGNER: Szymanczyk?
5	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) -- testified in the Engle
6	case that I was mentioning earlier?
7	A. No, I have not.
8	Q. If I asked you to assume that he testified
9	that he believed his mission as CEO of Philip Morris
10	was implementing changes in the way Philip Morris
11	does business, would you have any knowledge about
12	that?
13	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
14	A. Not really.
15	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Are you aware that he
16	testified that he -- his company, Philip Morris, had
17	been out of alignment with society's expectations of
18	the company?
19	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
20	A. I was -- I'm not aware of his testimony.
21	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Are you aware, sir, that --
22	strike that. Let me lay a foundation.
23	Since the last time you were deposed
24	in the Falise case, have you looked at any documents page	15
page	16
1	of any kind?
2	A. In regard to the Falise case?
3	Q. Yes, sir.
4	A. Yes, I have.
5	Q. Would you describe generally the nature of
6	those documents.
7	A. Yes. I have looked at and have continued
8	to review labor-related materials and have -- these
9	are materials that were part of the production and
10	I've been trying to -- I mean, the discovery
11	production process -- and I've been trying to
12	continue the process of evaluating them.
13	Q. Anything other than union documents?
14	A. Well, yes. I have looked at other
15	materials that we -- that go back to, I guess in
16	terms of collection dates or research dates, back
17	into the mid-1990s.
18	Q. These are documents that relate to what?
19	A. Awareness issues with respect to smoking.
20	Q. And these are documents in journals,
21	newspapers, magazines or what?
22	A. Everything from newspaper articles to
23	magazine articles to articles having to do with
24	education, what textbooks were available, what page	16
page	17
1	textbooks were saying. I've also looked at a variety
2	of -- since the last deposition -- a variety of
3	popular culture sources. That sort of thing. These
4	are some that at least I'm recalling right now.
5	Q. Publicly available things?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Okay. Have you availed yourself of an
8	opportunity to look at any of the internal documents
9	of the tobacco companies that are posted on the
10	Internet?
11	A. Since my subject is public awareness,
12	internal documents which were not part of the public
13	record fundamentally don't really relate to what I
14	have been asked to look into. So, no, I haven't
15	looked specifically at -- and certainly not in the
16	last month.
17	Q. What about press releases that are issued
18	by various tobacco companies or the Tobacco Institute
19	to advise the media of certain positions of the
20	companies? Have you looked at any of that?
21	A. Well, I have not looked at company press
22	releases per se. I've looked at enormous number of
23	newspaper articles. In fact, I've even done some
24	evaluation of newspaper articles in which various page	17
page	18
1	kinds of comments were made by company spokespersons;
2	and I presume that those comments came from press
3	releases of various types and kinds. So, yes, I have
4	looked at them, but it's been an indirect process of
5	looking at the whole host of newspaper articles
6	relating to health issues and tobacco.
7	Q. Specifically have you asked lawyers
8	representing R. J. Reynolds for any internal
9	non-published public opinion surveys that
10	R. J. Reynolds may have commissioned over the course
11	of history?
12	MR. KRAUS: Objection. Assumes a fact
13	not in evidence.
14	A. I haven't -- I have tried to focus on
15	materials which are part of the public record that
16	would somehow influence or affect public awareness
17	with respect to smoking.
18	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Would you not find it of
19	some interest if R. J. Reynolds had, indeed,
20	commissioned a survey of public opinion about the
21	health hazards associated with smoking cigarettes,
22	that that would be something of interest to you,
23	whether it was published or not?
24	A. Well -page	18
page	19
1	MR. WAGNER: Objection.
2	A. In --
3	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Can you give me a yes or no
4	on that one?
5	A. What I can tell you is I've looked at an
6	enormous number of public opinion polls.
7	Q. Have you looked at any commissioned
8	specifically by R. J. Reynolds?
9	A. Not that I recall.
10	Q. Are you aware that R. J. Reynolds and other
11	cigarette companies have placed on the Internet some
12	26 million pages of internal documents?
13	A. I am aware that there are an enormous
14	number of tobacco-related documents on the Internet,
15	yes.
16	Q. Are you aware that certain tobacco
17	companies have testified in the Engle case that they
18	are restrained from engaging in any conspiracy to
19	limit or suppress research into smoking and health?
2	0	MR. WAGNER: Object to form.
21	A. I'm not sure what that means.
22	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Do you know what -- I
23	believe you testified that you have had an interest
24	in the conspiracy theory of events. page	19
page	20
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. Well, do you know what it means to engage
3	in a conspiracy?
4	A. Well, there are many different definitions
5	of what it means to engage in a conspiracy; but quite
6	often that definition would include two or more
7	individuals somehow reaching a conclusion that they
8	should do some such thing and perhaps do it privately
9	and surreptitiously. Obvious example, the Kennedy
10	assassination.
11	Q. Who do you think --
12	A. Was there a -- well, who do I think?
13	Q. Yeah, who do you think --
14	MR. WAGNER: Objection. Irrelevant.
15	A. Probably Lee Harvey Oswald.
16	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Are you aware that
17	cigarette companies' CEOs testified in the Engle case
18	that they have agreed not to make any more material
19	misrepresentations regarding the health consequences
20	of using their cigarette products?
21	MR. WAGNER: Objection.
22	MR. KRAUS: Objection,
23	mischaracterizes the testimony. And, Ron, could I
24	have a proffer as to what this is relevant to? As page	20
page	21
1	you're well aware, Judge Weinstein has already ruled
2	that evidence relating to the Master Settlement
3	Agreement is not admissible.
4	MR. MOTLEY: I didn't ask him about
5	the Master Settlement Agreement.
6	MR. KRAUS: You know that all of that
7	evidence comes out of the Master Settlement inquiry.
8	MR. MOTLEY: No, sir, it doesn't.
9	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Can you answer that
10	question, sir?
11	A. Could you repeat it, please.
12	Q. Sure. Are you aware that CEOs of the
13	various tobacco companies testified that they will no
14	longer make material misrepresentations regarding the
15	health consequences of using cigarette products?
16	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
17	A. No, I'm not aware of that.
18	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Have you seen the
19	television commercials that Philip Morris has been
20	placing on the air waves recently about they're
21	changing their conduct?
22	A. I have -- I maybe have seen one or two. I
23	very rarely watch television. So I don't know
24	particularly one comes to mind. page	21
page	22
1	Q. Are you generally aware or have an
2	awareness that they have run such ads, whether you've
3	seen them or not?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. What conduct do you believe Philip Morris
6	is changing?
7	MR. WAGNER: Objection.
8	MR. KRAUS: Objection.
9	A. Well, I don't really know how to answer
10	that question. That isn't a question that I've
11	investigated.
12	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Do you know what
13	Mr. Szymanczyk would have been referring to when he
14	testified that it was his mission to put Philip
15	Morris back into the mainstream of business in
16	America and back doing what should be done by a
17	responsible company?
18	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
19	A. I'm not familiar with his testimony.
20	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Well, having done the
21	amount of research you have, sir, on what's publicly
22	available, have you seen anything in what you've read
23	that would indicate to you that in the past Philip
24	Morris had acted irresponsibly? page	22
page	23
1	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
2	A. What I can tell you is -- and I have to go
3	back to the research base -- is that the materials
4	that I have looked at point to one general conclusion
5	and that is that there are very high levels of
6	awareness with respect to the potential health
7	dangers associated with smoking and with respect to
8	the difficulties of quitting smoking. Those were the
9	questions I was asked to investigate, and I've tried
10	to investigate them with -- by looking in a very
11	broad range of sources. And so that's the answer I
12	can give you.
13	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) So you can't tell me
14	whether you've seen anything in this vast research
15	that you've undertaken to indicate that Phillip
16	Morris was acting irresponsibly toward the public?
17	MR. WAGNER: Objection to form.
18	A. I've seen -- as I've tried to indicate,
19	I've seen various kinds of comments that would appear
20	in newspapers. I've seen some newspaper editorials
21	that said that smoking was bad for people. I don't
22	remember specifically that those articles or
23	editorials were attacking particular tobacco
24	companies; but certainly the information that smoking page	23
page	24
1	was perhaps not a healthful habit and that it would
2	be difficult to quit, that information was certainly
3	widespread. That's what I have seen.
4	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Have you attended any
5	witness preparation school conducted by Womble,
6	Carlyle?
7	A. No, I have not.
8	Q. Do you know what a witness preparation
9	school is?
10	A. No, I don't have any idea.
11	Q. Have you ever been videotaped with a
12	question-and-answer format to prepare you for
13	testifying at trial?
14	A. No, I have not.
15	Q. How many times did you meet with lawyers
16	from Jones, Day or Womble, Carlyle prior to giving
17	the first testimony that I believe you gave to a
18	jury, which was in the iron workers' case?
19	A. In the iron workers' case?
20	Q. Is that the first time you appeared before
21	a jury?
22	A. Yes.
2	3	Q. Okay. Can you tell me how many times you
24	have met with lawyers from Womble, Carlyle or from
page	24
page	25
1	Jones, Day prior to testifying?
2	MR. KRAUS: Can I ask for a point of
3	clarification?
4	MR. MOTLEY: Sure.
5	MR. KRAUSE: Are you asking for
6	meetings in preparation for the testimony, or all
7	meetings?
8	MR. MOTLEY: All meetings.
9	A. All meetings. Well, in terms of meetings
10	with Womble, Carlyle before the iron workers' case, I
11	don't recall any direct meetings because, so far as I
12	know, I was not -- at least I had no connection with
13	Womble, Carlyle.
14	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Okay. Jones, Day.
15	A. Okay. Jones, Day. In respect to that
16	particular case?
17	Q. Yes, sir.
18	A. Okay. It would be very hard for me to
19	categorize those meetings because I made a number of
20	trips to Ohio to do research at the Ohio Historical
21	Society and at various state agencies in that, in
22	Columbus; and naturally since Jones, Day has an
23	office in Columbus, that was my base that I operated
24	out of when I was doing that research. So it's very page	25
page	26
1	hard for me to give you a specific number -- 8, 10,
2	12. I don't have a specific number. In terms of
3	total, all types and kinds of meetings in that?
4	Let's say 10 to 15.
5	Q. That's with Jones, Day?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. And what about Womble?
8	A. And that's in relation -- I'm talking about
9	with Ohio Iron.
10	Q. Right.
11	A. Okay.
12	Q. What about what Womble, Carlyle in relation
13	to Falise?
14	A. Actual face-to-face meetings?
15	Q. Yes, sir. We'll start with that.
16	A. All right. I would say -- and this is a
17	guess on my part -- three or four. That would be an
18	estimate on my part.
19	Q. Since your last deposition, how many hours
20	would you say you've spent in reviewing these union
21	materials and the other things that you described
22	you've done since then?
23	A. Well, I'm going to -- I'll give an estimate
24	of 25, 30, something like that. page	26
page	27
1	Q. Have you prepared any supplemental report,
2	based on what you looked at?
3	A. Since June, late June?
4	Q. Yes.
5	A. No, I have not.
6	Q. Okay. And let me ask you some questions
7	about your own smoking history.
8	A. Okay.
9	Q. I believe you testified that you stopped
10	smoking in 1996.
11	A. That is correct. In November of 1996.
12	Q. Okay. And when did you start?
13	A. Well, I had a real checkered career. I
14	think I started at approximately the age of 19. I
15	smoked on and off through college and graduate
16	school. I stopped smoking for two years.
17	Q. Approximately when was that?
18	A. Approximately '68, '69 to '71, when I was
19	writing my dissertation and starting my teaching
20	career at Rutgers. Then I smoked various kinds of
21	things after that and even -- well, yeah, I did. And
22	there was a long period where I didn't do any
23	smoking; I'd use a little smokiness tobacco now and
24	then. That was about a ten-year period. I started page	27
page	28
1	smoking again then in 1992, and I quit in 1996.
2	Q. What cigarettes were you smoking in 1992?
3	What brand?
4	A. Kent.
5	Q. Kent. In your -- did you do any product
6	research prior to selecting Kent?
7	A. Well, if you call what cigarette I thought
8	had the best taste for me, I guess that's product
9	research. I would say that, yes, I sampled various
10	kinds and I found that particular cigarette very mild
11	and then that's what I was looking for.
12	Q. How many packs of Kent did you smoke,
13	average, on a day?
14	A. It varied all over the place. I might
15	smoke as few as five or ten a day and two packs on
16	another day. It just depended on circumstances.
17	Q. Is there an event that triggered your
18	decision to stop smoking?
19	A. Yes. My oldest daughter is a medical
20	social worker and she works at a hospital here in
21	Houston and she brought me all the American Cancer
22	Society literature and asked me if I'd participate in
23	the Great American Smoke-out, which was in November
24	of 1996; and I said, fine, I'd be glad to. And I page	28
page	29
1	have stopped and I've not touched a cigarette since.
2	Q. Do you recall what brand you smoked when
3	you first started?
4	A. I think -- but I'm not sure -- that it was
5	a mixture of Kent and Newport. This would be back in
6	the mid-Sixties.
7	Q. Okay. Do you believe that you were ever
8	addicted to the nicotine contained in cigarettes?
9	A. Well, I think that's a very good question
10	because when I made up my mind I wanted to quit,
11	which I did on three occasions -- and the third one
12	permanently -- I had no real difficulty. I mean, I'd
13	have a day or two of anxiousness or whatever you're
14	supposed to have and then that was the extent of it
15	so that it was not a difficult -- in terms of the
16	modern definition of addiction, I thought -- I think
17	that some of those definitions are pretty extreme. I
18	think to turn smokers into drug addicts is kind of --
19	it's good rhetoric, if we could describe it that way,
20	but I think it's bad public health policy.
21	Q. Did you ever consider yourself a drug
22	addict?
23	A. Heavens, no.
24	Q. So you disagreed with the definition of page	29
page	30
1	addiction as contained in the 1988 Surgeon General's
2	report?
3	A. I think that the Surgeon General wanted to
4	make a certain kind of a statement that he realized
5	would have all sorts of repercussions of various
6	types and kinds. And he did that. But I think the
7	term -- I know the term "addiction" has been around
8	at least 160 years, if not much longer, and then it
9	was popular in terms of one term to describe it.
10	Q. What question are you answering right now?
11	A. I'm not sure what the question was.
12	Q. I didn't think so. I asked you do you, yes
13	or no, agree or disagree with the Surgeon General's
14	definition of addiction contained in the 1988 --
15	MR. WAGNER: Objection. Irrelevant.
16	MR. KRAUS: I object to the form of
17	this question.
18	A. I answered it's possible to agree and
19	disagree because it's --
20	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) That's fine.
21	A. My personal opinion is that the definition
22	provided by the Surgeon General is extreme. That's
23	my personal opinion, but I realize that the Surgeon
24	General was trying to accomplish certain kinds of page	30
page	31
1	purposes and he was trying to effect certain kinds of
2	changes. And perhaps he was successful in doing
3	that.
4	Q. Sir, do you know what chemicals were added
5	to Kent when you were smoking them in 1992 to 1996?
6	MR. WAGNER: Objection. Irrelevant.
7	A. No, I really don't.
8	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Do you care?
9	A. Well, I guess I could or should; but it
10	certainly didn't affect my decision to smoke.
11	Q. Have you suffered any lung damage as a
12	result of your history of smoking cigarettes, to your
13	knowledge?
14	A. To my knowledge, no.
15	Q. Have you had a pulmonary examination since
16	1960?
17	A. I think I have, yes.
18	Q. Who is your pulmonary physician?
19	MR. KRAUS: Objection. Relevance.
20	You can answer.
21	A. I'm trying to come up with his name. I
22	can't answer the question. I can't think of the
23	fellow's name.
24	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Okay. Do you believe -page	31
page	32
1	let me ask you this. Would you agree with
2	Mr. Schindler, the chief executive officer of
3	R. J. Reynolds, that their customers had the right to
4	rely on the statements regarding cigarettes and
5	health that the company issued from time to time over
6	the last 40 years?
7	MR. KRAUS: Objection to the form of
8	the question and objection that it's outside the
9	scope of his expert report.
10	You can answer.
11	A. Okay. I really don't know how to answer
12	the question.
13	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Have you done any studies
14	or seen any studies where the effect of
15	R. J. Reynolds' public statements were measured by
16	R. J. Reynolds -- that is, any polling or survey data
17	specific to the impact that their statements on
18	smoking and health were making with their customers?
19	A. What I've seen are a great number of polls
20	which show that Americans are very aware at very high
21	levels.
22	Q. Sir, what question are you answering?
23	A. Mr. Motley, I'm answering your question.
24	Q. No, sir, I didn't ask you about public page	32
page	33
1	polls. I asked you about R. J. Reynolds' surveys of
2	whether or not their customers relied on statements
3	that R. J. Reynolds made in the public domain with
4	respect to smoking and health.
5	A. Am I aware of specific studies?
6	Q. Yes, sir.
7	A. No.
8	Q. Did you ever smoke low-tar cigarettes?
9	MR. WAGNER: Objection. Irrelevant.
10	A. Yes, I think so.
11	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Why?
12	A. I never smoked cigarettes which were
13	non-filtered. I never smoked cigarettes which had a
14	very strong flavor because they would give me
15	headaches.
16	Q. Did you think the filter was a safety
17	device?
18	A. I wasn't really thinking about that one way
19	or the other.
20	Q. Did you think low-tar cigarettes were safer
21	than full-flavor cigarettes, so-called full-flavor
22	cigarettes?
23	A. This was not a consideration in my smoking.
24	Q. You never thought of that? page	33
page	34
1	A. Oh, I may have; but I don't recall
2	specifically now.
3	Q. Are you familiar with the term
4	"psychological crutch"?
5	A. Yeah, I think I have a general -- yes. Let
6	me change that to "yes."
7	Q. Okay. Are you familiar with the term
8	"reassuring customers"?
9	A. Reassuring customers?
10	Q. Uh-huh.
11	A. I could probably take a guess.
12	Q. What would you guess that means?
13	MR. WAGNER: Objection.
14	A. Well, Ford Motor Company wants to reassure
15	you that their cars are better than Chevrolets.
16	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Are you familiar with the
17	Pinto gas tank incidents?
18	MR. KRAUS: Objection. Relevance.
19	A. Yes, I am in a very general way. I
20	don't -- I can't recall when but I remember Pintos
21	had a problem with their gas tanks. If their cars
22	were hit in the rear end, some of them caught on
23	fire.
24	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Have you read the Journal page	34
page	35
1	of the American Medical Association from 1995 that
2	examined certain documents of one tobacco company,
3	Brown & Williamson?
4	A. Is this the Stanton Glantz issue?
5	Q. It's an issue in which he published
6	articles, yes.
7	A. I'm aware of it, yes.
8	Q. Have you looked at the editorial from the
9	board of directors of the American Medical
10	Association that appeared in that journal?
11	A. Well, if I have, I don't recall
12	specifically what the commentary was.
13	Q. Do you recall the term, the American people
14	have been "duped" by the tobacco industry?
15	A. Well, based on my research, they haven't
16	been.
17	Q. Do you recall that or not?
18	A. I just gave you my answer.
19	Q. You don't recall that that statement was
20	made, or you don't agree?
21	A. I may or may not recall, but it does not
22	bear any -- I mean, I can say the American people
2	3	were duped by the Pinto and be wrong. So I don't
24	know how to answer that question. It really doesn't
page	35
page	36
1	seem to relate, from my point of view, to the
2	questions I've been asked to investigate.
3	Q. Do you believe that public health officials
4	are making misleading statements when they say the
5	American public has been duped by the tobacco
6	industry?
7	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
8	A. Well, what I can tell you about that is --
9	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Can you answer that yes or
10	no?
11	A. There is no "yes" or "no" answer to that.
12	Q. Well, I don't need a speech about your
13	polling data. I just want --
14	A. I wasn't going to talk -- I was going to
15	talk about C. Everett Koop.
16	Q. Okay. But --
17	MR. KRAUS: I would appreciate,
18	Mr. Motley, if you wouldn't interrupt the witness.
19	MR. MOTLEY: No, sir. This gentleman
20	when he testified was interrupted ten times by the
21	Federal judge for not answering questions, and I'm
22	not going to waste my time by getting the same pat
23	answer to every question, that he's looked at public
24	polls. page	36 page	37
1	MR. KRAUS: Were you appointed a
2	Federal judge in the interim and I --
3	MR. MOTLEY: No, sir, I wasn't but I
4	will --
5	MR. KRAUS: Well, then you'll abide by
6	the Rules that --
7	MR. MOTLEY: Don't even try to lecture
8	me about the Federal Rules. Okay.
9	Can you repeat the question?
10	(The record was read as requested.)
11	MR. KOETHE: I'm going to instruct the
12	witness that if you cannot answer Mr. Motley's
13	questions with a "yes" or "no" answer, that's within
14	your right to give an answer that you feel you need
15	to give to explain your answer to his question.
16	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Well, I don't know what
17	kind of instruction that is; but you certainly don't
18	have to answer a question "yes" or "no" if you don't
19	believe it would be within the range of credibility
20	to say "yes" or "no." Okay. And you've given me an
21	answer to my question.
22	Now, have you come across the
23	transcript of an appearance on Face the Nation where
24	the guest was Joseph Cullman, III, the chairman of page	37
page	38
1	the board of Phillip Morris, Inc.?
2	A. Face the Nation?
3	Q. Face the Nation. Are you familiar with
4	that program?
5	A. No.
6	Q. It's a news program on Sundays by CBS.
7	Does that refresh your memory at all?
8	A. I don't know -- I don't even know what
9	period we're talking about.
10	Q. In 1984.
11	A. 1984?
12	Q. Yes, sir -- no, excuse me, 1971.
13	A. 1971?
14	Q. Yes, sir.
15	A. I'm not familiar with that. No, I'm not.
16	Q. Okay. Are you familiar with the
17	advertising promotion restrictions that the tobacco
18	companies have agreed to in 1998?
19	MR. WAGNER: Objection. Irrelevant.
20	A. Well, I guess I have a general -- you mean
21	1998?
22	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Yes, sir.
23	A. Is this the 15 percent rule?
24	Q. That would be part of it. page	38
page	39
1	A. Okay. That's what I'm familiar with.
2	Q. Okay. Are you aware that the chief
3	executive officer of Philip Morris testified that he
4	believed tobacco industry advertising in the past was
5	too open and too visible?
6	MR. KRAUS: Objection to the form.
7	MR. WAGNER: Objection to the form.
8	A. No.
9	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) The Tobacco Institute. I
10	believe from your prior testimony you are familiar
11	with the fact that it was a trade association.
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Are you aware that the Tobacco Institute no
14	longer exists?
15	A. Well, I would -- I didn't know whether it
16	no longer existed. I thought it was on the verge of
17	not existing.
18	Q. And why did you believe that?
19	A. Well, that's just my impression from, I
20	guess, reading newspapers.
21	Q. Do you know why it no longer exists?
22	A. I can't answer that question. I can't be
23	sure of an answer.
24	Q. Have you read an op ed piece by former page	39
page	40
1	President Jimmy Carter?
2	A. I've read op ed pieces, but I don't
3	remember one specifically by Jimmy Carter.
4	Q. Specific to the issue of smoking and
5	health.
6	A. I don't recall.
7	Q. If I suggest to you that he said that he as
8	a President of the United States was misled by the
9	tobacco companies, would that refresh your memory?
10	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
11	A. That wouldn't recall. That wouldn't recall
12	anything. And certainly Joseph Califano, his
13	Secretary of HEW, mounted major campaigns that I have
14	investigated.
15	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Okay. Explain to me -- I'm
16	familiar with your investigation of the 1978
17	announcement that was placed in Social Security
18	checks. That was initiated at the instance of
19	Mr. Califano. Is that the investigation to which you
20	refer, or are there others?
21	A. Joseph Califano began a major campaign
22	against smoking and an effort to raise even higher
23	levels of public awareness with respect to the
24	dangers of smoking. And that campaign -- in that page	40
page	41
1	campaign he described smoking as slow-motion suicide
2	specifically. So I guess we could call it the
3	slow-motion suicide campaign. In addition, of
4	course, there was the asbestos campaign.
5	Q. Right. Have you ascertained any number
6	other than that that was used by Mr. Califano, the
7	estimated number of Americans exposed to asbestos
8	being between somewhere 7 and 11 million? Do you
9	recall that number?
10	A. Yes, I do.
11	Q. Have you seen anything in your research
12	that would indicate that number is too high or too
13	low?
14	A. Excuse me. I have seen other kinds of
15	estimates.
16	Q. And what kinds of estimates were those,
17	sir?
18	A. Well, there were estimates, once you got
19	into the 1980s, that put the number in the 20 million
2	0	range.
21	Q. Sir, do you know what percentage of
22	whatever the number might be, 11 or 20 million, of
23	the persons exposed to asbestos in the workplace were
24	nonunion employees? page	41
page	42
1	A. Well, it depends on, I guess, how one would
2	define the workplace.
3	Q. A shipyard, for example.
4	A. A shipyard.
5	Q. The Charleston naval shipyard, for example.
6	Do you know whether that work force of many thousands
7	of people were union or nonunion?
8	A. Well, the shipyard I would be more familiar
9	with would be the Groton shipyard in Connecticut, and
10	I believe a very high percentage of those workers the
11	doctors I recall studied were organized union members
12	affiliated with the -- well, part of the reporting
13	relationship came through the metal trades department
14	of the AFL-CIO. So there I would guess a high
15	percentage. I'm not really familiar -- I don't -- I
16	can't speak to the Charleston situation. That might
17	be somewhat different because the labor movement in
18	the South is traditionally not as well organized; it
19	lags beyond behind other parts of the country.
20	Q. Indeed, would you agree that the vast
21	majority of people who work in the building and
22	construction trades -- and I don't mean as members of
23	the building and construction trades department of
24	the AFL-CIO but I mean generically in those trades -page	42
page	43
1	are nonunion?
2	A. The vast majority?
3	Q. Yes, sir.
4	A. It would depend on when we're talking
5	about.
6	Q. Let's talk about in the Sixties.
7	A. I would think you'd have a greater number
8	of unionized building and construction trade workers
9	in the Sixties than you would have in the 1990s.
10	Q. You would agree, though, sir, that there
11	has been historically a large number of building and
12	construction tradesmen who were not affiliated with
13	unions?
14	MR. KRAUS: Object to the form of the
15	question.
16	A. I can't give you a specific number, but
17	what I can say is that's why the Califano campaign
18	did not address itself to specific unions.
19	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) That being that he
20	recognized that there were nonunion persons?
21	A. Well, he recognized there were nonunion --
22	there are always nonunion workers in the United
23	States.
24	Q. Right. Do you know of an effort to reach page	43
page	44
1	nonunion asbestos-exposed persons, prior to
2	Mr. Califano's campaign of 1978, with respect to the
3	issue of asbestos and cigarettes?
4	MR. KOETHE: Object to the form.
5	A. There were various actions, various kinds
6	of conferences sponsored by the -- sponsored by the
7	Federal Government, pamphlets that were put out by
8	the Federal Government through NIOSH and OSHA.
9	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) When?
10	A. Those were not restricted to union members
11	per se. In -- as I recall around 1974.
12	Q. Are you -- excuse me, are you not confusing
13	that with the pamphlet that was issued by NIOSH and
14	OSHA in 1980?
15	A. No, I don't believe so.
16	Q. All right. Do you recall the information
17	was imparted in the 1974 pamphlet that you recall?
18	A. These pamphlets would invariably talk
19	about, try to make individuals aware of the potential
20	dangers of asbestos would quite often point out that
21	asbestos is sort of pervasive in its use in a whole
22	variety of ways and products in American society,
23	some 3,000 items, and that there are various ways
24	that individuals can come into contact with asbestos, page	44
page	45
1	so that they would define the nature of the product
2	itself, would talk about then the dangers associated
3	with the dust produced by asbestos, and would then go
4	on to describe certain kinds of diseases that are
5	associated with asbestos -- asbestosis, mesothelioma,
6	if I'm pronouncing that correctly -- and would also
7	normally would talking about the synergistic
8	relationship with respect to tobacco and asbestos
9	exposure, quoting quite often a Dr. Selikoff figure.
10	Q. And this discussion of synergism, did that
11	relate to a specific disease?
12	A. Yes. Lung disease.
13	Q. Lung disease or lung cancer?
14	A. Yes, lung cancer.
15	Q. Are you familiar with the term, "the
16	compromised lung"?
17	A. The compromised lung?
18	Q. Yes, sir.
19	A. I'd have to guess at it, and I'm not a
20	medical doctor. So I'm not sure what that would
21	mean.
22	Q. Are you aware of any efforts by the
23	cigarette companies to put out brochures of any kind
24	to alert people exposed to asbestos in the United page	45
page	46
1	States that the combination of asbestos and
2	cigarettes not only was hazardous in regard to lung
3	cancer but also in regard to nonmalignant lung
4	disease?
5	A. Am I aware of any pamphlet?
6	Q. Yes, sir.
7	A. No.
8	Q. Similar to the NIOSH one you described.
9	A. No.
10	Q. Your research in regard to public awareness
11	of asbestos and cigarettes, did it include an effort
12	to locate articles that discussed the compromised
13	lung in regard to the interaction of asbestos and
14	cigarettes on nonmalignant lung disease?
15	MR. KRAUS: Objection to the form of
16	the question. He testified earlier he didn't know
17	what compromised lung means. So you've got to
18	provide him a definition.
19	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Well, I would think that it
20	goes without saying that if you didn't know what the
21	compromised lung concept was, you haven't done
22	research on that issue.
23	A. Well, I've seen articles which describe
24	various diseases; and I'm not picking up on the page	46
page	47
1	meaning of compromised lung. So I guess that's
2	the -- would be difficult for me to say, yes, I have.
3	Q. Have you seen articles in the public domain
4	that discuss the effect of cigarette smoke on the
5	cilia, C-I-L-I-A, of the human lung?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Have you attempted to quantify those
8	articles?
9	A. Well, no, I haven't attempted to quantify
10	them. I mean, I can give you numbers from -- the
11	Surgeon General's report, I think, said it reviewed
12	8,000 articles dealing with smoking and health. I'm
13	talking --
14	Q. 8,000 newspaper articles?
15	A. No, 8,000 --
16	Q. Medical?
17	A. Medical or medical-related, scientific, or
18	perhaps just personal opinion.
19	Q. Well, what I was asking about, though, was
20	the lay press. Have you conducted a methodically --
21	strike that. That's a poor question.
22	Have you attempted to methodically
23	study in the incidents of reportage in the lay press
24	with respect to the interaction of asbestos and page	47
page	48
1	cigarettes on nonmalignant lung disease?
2	A. On nonmalignant lung disease?
3	Q. Yes, sir. Not lung cancer.
4	A. Not lung cancer.
5	Q. No, sir -- yes, sir.
6	A. I don't recall seeing. I've looked at a
7	great number of newspaper articles. I don't recall
8	articles that spoke about non -- I'm not even sure
9	what you mean by you -- when I -- nonmalignant lung
10	disease -- are we speaking about -- is this another
11	term for asbestosis?
12	Q. Not necessarily. It can be a term --
13	A. Well, I've seen articles which -- I'm
14	sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
15	Q. No, but I'm talking specific to the
16	interaction between asbestos and cigarettes with
17	respect to nonmalignant lung disease.
18	A. Well, if we include asbestosis as a
19	nonmalignant lung disease, yes, I've seen a number of
20	articles that speak to the -- speak and use the
21	terminology "asbestosis."
22	Q. Yes, sir. But did it use that term in
23	connection with the interaction of asbestos and
24	cigarettes? That was my specific -page	48
page	49
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. They do. Okay. You've provided us with a
3	list of materials that you rely on.
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Will you be able at the time of the trial
6	of this case to identify those articles that deal
7	with nonmalignant diseases that result from or are
8	aggravated by the interaction between asbestos and
9	cigarettes?
10	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
11	A. Well, again, I don't recall that particular
12	terminology. It doesn't mean it's not there.
13	Rather, I recall various diseases being listed; but I
14	don't remember a distinction between nonmalignant and
15	malignant. So it might be difficult for me to speak
16	to that particular -- I think this is a medical
17	doctor distinction that a person who is not trained
18	in medicine may not understand. I don't know.
19	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Were you asked by Womble,
20	Carlyle in the Falise case to look for the effect of
21	the interaction of asbestos and cigarettes on
22	nonmalignant, non-cancer lung disease?
23	A. Non-cancer --
24	Q. Yeah.
page	49
page	50
1	A. -- lung disease or --
2	Q. Yeah.
3	A. If we're referring to asbestosis, that's
4	part of the whole.
5	Q. Okay. What about chronic obstructive
6	pulmonary disease?
7	A. Well, that again would be part of the
8	whole.
9	Q. In respect to asbestos and cigarettes, that
10	would be part of the whole?
11	A. Yes. But in so many of the pamphlets that
12	I have reviewed and that I've seen and the newspaper
13	articles, the -- I don't remember that many
14	references to COPD. What I do recall certainly in
15	these articles are references to asbestosis, to
16	mesothelioma, to lung cancer among smokers and
17	non-smokers, and to various other kinds of cancers
18	that might be mentioned such as, let's say, rectal
19	cancer, as an example.
20	Q. Other than the 1974 NIOSH brochure that you
21	and I were discussing five or ten minutes ago and the
22	Secretary Califano's campaign in the Social Security
23	checks with respect to asbestos and cigarettes, are
24	you aware of any effort by public health officials to page	50
page	51
1	alert nonunion asbestos-exposed Americans?
2	A. Any Government sponsored program would not
3	focus just on unions but would focus on all workers
4	and would even go beyond workers and would go into
5	the community of particular concern to Dr. Selikoff
6	such as his Patterson, New Jersey, studies in the
7	1970s for individuals who lived around the former
8	asbestos plant there. He was very concerned about
9	what would happen to families and the health problems
10	related to families. So these issues I've seen
11	covered in various newspaper articles and I would
12	have -- I guess the overall answer that I would have
13	to give would be that all of this is going to point
14	to a reaction where approximately in 1990 asbestos is
15	eliminated from the American economy, so that I can't
16	trace the particular path of the particular pamphlet
17	or the particular effect of a particular conference
18	but every effort from my understanding is the public
19	health service is making a good effort to get this
20	information out and about.
21	Q. Well, do you have any pamphlets or
22	campaigns prior to 1974 to the general public?
23	A. Prior --
24	Q. You mentioned the pamphlet in 1974. page	51
page	52
1	A. Right.
2	Q. Prior to 1974 that discuss the interaction
3	between cigarettes and asbestos?
4	A. Prior to 1974? I would have to look and
5	see if there were various kinds of conferences that
6	would be held. Certainly there was newspaper
7	coverage.
8	Q. Of what?
9	A. Of what we just talked --
10	Q. Asbestos --
11	A. Asbestos and cigarettes, yes. And that
12	wouldn't be directed just at the labor community.
13	(Exhibit 10 marked)
14	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Professor Martin, have you
15	located Exhibit 10 in your research, prior to my
16	giving you a copy of it?
17	A. Lost Empire, Chapter 3, Part 3, "Like a
18	Cigarette Should," Winston-Salem Journal,
19	October 30th --
20	THE REPORTER: I'm sorry, I can't
21	understand what you're saying.
22	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. I'm just
23	reading from the top. I'll slow down.
24	A. Appeared in the Winston-Salem Journal, page	52
page	53
1	October 30th, 1999, by Frank Tursi, T-U-R-S-I, Susan
2	White, and Steve McQuilkin, M-C-Q-U-I-L-K-I-N. Yes.
3	That would be the source.
4	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Yes, sir. And have you
5	seen that in your research?
6	A. Have I seen this in my research? Not this
7	particular version, no.
8	Q. Have you reviewed the collection of
9	documents from the memoirs of John Hill, the
10	co-founder of Hill & Knowlton.
11	A. At the University of Wisconsin?
12	Q. Yes, sir.
13	A. No, I haven't seen those. I may have seen
14	one or two of them in some way, but I haven't gone
15	and researched them specifically.
16	Q. Do you recall the extent of the publication
17	of the Frank statement in 19 -- early 1954?
18	A. Do I recall the extent?
19	Q. Yes, sir, how many newspapers it appeared
20	in.
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Yes, sir.
23	A. And that number is given in here and so far
24	as I can tell, those numbers are fairly accurate. page	53
page	54
1	It's 200 plus.
2	Q. Right. Okay. And in the course of your --
3	if you would, look, please, sir -- these pages are
4	not numbered but up at the top there is a fax page
5	number. Page 09.
6	A. Right.
7	Q. In the first full paragraph, it makes
8	reference to the Frank statement publication but then
9	says: In the same edition of the Winston-Salem
10	Journal in which the ad appeared, Darr -- being the
11	president of R. J. Reynolds at the time -- didn't say
12	anything about conducting independent research to
13	protect the health of smokers. He said that the
14	companies formed the research committee as a
15	"concerted effort on the part of the tobacco industry
16	to combat a bit of propaganda which we believe to be
17	erroneous, unfair, and unjust."
18	My question to you is, sir, in the
19	course of your historical research, did you come
20	across the article which quoted Mr. Darr in January
21	of 1954?
22	A. Come across the article?
23	Q. That they're quoting from here.
24	A. Well, I've read a number of articles around page	54
page	55
1	this time period; and whether that particular quote,
2	I read that particular quote, I can't say. From Darr
3	specifically.
4	Q. In this document, there's a reference to a
5	gentleman named Ed Jacob. And if I can direct to you
6	where that reference appears, it would be, again, Fax
7	Page No. 12.
8	A. I'm there. Yes, I'm there.
9	Q. It would be second full paragraph,
10	beginning with the words: "The men who attended the
11	meeting at the Plaza Hotel knew little about biology,
12	medicine, or other sciences. They had come up in an
13	industry that sold an agricultural product," noted Ed
14	Jacob, a New York lawyer who had long represented the
15	tobacco industry.
16	Then they quote from Mr. Jacob. And I
17	have the document here that they quote from, but let
18	me read you what they say in this newspaper article.
19	"Given this lack of sophistication" -- referring to
20	the presidents of the tobacco companies -- "many
21	industry officials in 1953 felt that claims about
22	smoking and lung cancer could be exposed of summarily
23	by opening some laboratories and proving in very
24	short order that the claims being made were wrong."
page	55
page	56
1	And then he says: In the minds of most company
2	officials, there was just no substance to the claim
3	that cigarette -- that smoking cigarettes caused lung
4	cancer.
5	Now, have you read any documents that
6	Mr. Ed Jacob has generated on behalf of his client,
7	R. J. Reynolds?
8	A. Ed Jacobs specifically?
9	Q. Yes, sir.
10	A. Not that I recall.
11	MR. MOTLEY: This is a Bliley
12	document.
13	MR. KRAUS: I was just going to ask
14	you that.
15	MR. MOTLEY: I figured you were.
16	(Exhibit 11 marked)
17	MR. MOTLEY: Do you want to make a
18	statement on the record or is my telling -- I
19	understand you have a continuing objection. The --
20	do you want to make an objection or just --
21	MR. KRAUS: I'll just make the
22	standard objection to the use of any of the Bliley
23	documents, and we reserve all of our privilege
24	claims. page	56 page	57
1	MR. MOTLEY: Sure.
2	MR. WAGNER: And can you designate the
3	questions and answers that relate to this document as
4	"Confidential."
5	A. Did you want to direct me to a particular
6	portion of this or read the whole document?
7	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Yes, sir, I'll just -- no,
8	I'm not going to ask you to do that.
9	A. Okay.
10	Q. But I take it you've never seen this
11	document.
12	A. I don't know. Just a second. I don't
13	believe that I have seen this document.
14	Q. If you'd look on what's denominated
15	page 1 -- it's actually four pages in. It says
16	"Industry Background" up at the top?
17	A. Yes, sir.
18	Q. Then it says Ed Jacob in the top-left
19	corner and says June 27th, 1980.
20	MR. KRAUS: Just technically, I think
21	that's the top-right corner.
22	MR. MOTLEY: Top-right corner.
23	Correct.
24	A. Yes. page	57
page	58
1	MR. MOTLEY: Might put it in
2	perspective if you look at it upside down.
3	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Now, do you see the
4	sentence that was quoted in the Winston-Salem Journal
5	says: "Given this lack of sophistication, many
6	industry officials in 1953 felt that claims about
7	smoking and lung cancer could be disposed of
8	summarily by opening some laboratories and proving in
9	very short order that the claims being made were
10	wrong." So they did get the quote right in the
11	newspaper.
12	A. Yes, looks like that.
13	Q. Yeah. Now, are you aware that the CEOs of
14	these companies to which this refers who met at the
15	Plaza Hotel in December 1953 were men who were the
16	presidents of -- for the time -- very substantial
17	consumer product manufacturing companies --
18	substantial in assets?
19	A. Yes. And the date was December 15th, as a
20	matter of fact. I'm very familiar with this story.
21	Q. Right. And you see that Mr. Jacob, who
22	represented R. J. Reynolds, describes these
23	presidents as lacking sophistication?
24	A. Okay. "Given this lack of sophistication." page	58
page	59
1	Q. Right.
2	A. If that is a comment about their personal
3	behavior, I don't think that's what he meant.
4	Q. No.
5	A. I think what he meant was that they were
6	not sophisticated in, I would assume, medical
7	research.
8	Q. Okay. Biology, I believe he said.
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. Biology, medicine, and the sciences.
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. Would you believe, sir, that a person who,
13	like Mr. Darr, who was an educated man who was
14	running a major United States corporation, would have
15	had greater or less sophistication on biology, the
16	sciences, and medicine than a blue-collar worker with
17	a tenth grade education?
18	MR. KRAUS: Objection.
19	MR. WAGNER: Objection to form.
20	A. I really don't know how to answer that
21	question because I don't know anything about
22	Mr. Darr. I don't know what his background is. For
23	all I know, he may not have had a tenth grade
24	education himself. page	59
page	60
1	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Well, I'm asking you to
2	assume that he did have a college education.
3	A. That he did have a college education.
4	Well, I would assume that, yes. I would assume that
5	if someone went to college and had a college
6	education, they would have more education than
7	someone who didn't make it through the tenth grade.
8	Q. Right. Now, on page 2 of the document --
9	this is a document by Mr. Jacob -- he says in the
10	second full paragraph: "Yet another possibility --
11	and the one that was ultimately adopted by
12	industry -- was for the companies to set up an
13	organization to fund research by independent
14	scientists with the results of their research being
15	given at least as much publicity by a public
16	relations organization as the attacks on smoking."
17	And then he describes the creation of the Tobacco
18	Industry Research Committee.
19	A. I'm very familiar with this story.
20	Q. Okay. And have you attempted to ascertain
21	how widely disseminated and published in newspapers
22	the annual reports of the tobacco industry research
23	committee were?
24	A. I've seen various kinds of articles. And page	60
page	61
1	what I can tell you, in terms of the Frank statement
2	per se, is that it was, as we agreed upon, was
3	published in some 200-plus newspapers in January -- I
4	believe the date was 4th, 1954, and that any effect
5	that it had was immediately counteracted by a whole
6	host of other newspapers articles that came out in
7	the winter and the spring of 1954 reporting the
8	research results of Drs. Hammond and Horn's ACS
9	study, which received national headlines in June of
10	1954, so that while I'm aware that this is -- this
11	information was there, that you have the formation of
12	the TI, the appointment of a board, the appointment
13	of individuals to serve on that board to consider
14	grant research, and while I'm aware that the
15	companies per se were not -- did not have research
16	laboratories that were looking into questions of
17	health in 1953, '54 -- after all, just a very few
18	scientists had done that by that particular point in
19	time -- that the understanding was that the best way
20	to handle this situation would be to funnel funds
21	through the TIRC.
22	MR. MOTLEY: We've been going at this
23	for about an hour and 15, 20 minutes. I'm sure this
24	gentleman would like to rest his fingers for a page	61
page	62
1	minute. Would you like to take a break now?
2	THE WITNESS: That's fine. Sure.
3	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time now is
4	approximately 10:28. We're off the record.
5	(Recess taken)
6	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time now is
7	approximately 10:42 and we're on the record.
8	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Let me ask just a few more
9	questions about this document of Mr. Jacob, if you
10	don't mind; and then I'm going to move on to
11	something else.
12	A. Okay.
13	Q. If you would kindly turn to page -- on my
14	copy the pages are getting somewhat obliterated. But
15	it's page 4 but you can't see 4 on the bottom. And
16	the only reason I know it's 4, if you go two over,
17	you see 6.
18	A. What's the very first paragraph? Begins
19	"in 1962"?
20	Q. No, "which the industry could meet to
21	deal."
22	MR. KRAUS: You were on the right
23	page.
24	THE WITNESS: I was there before? page	62
page	63
1	MR. KRAUS: Yes. The difference is
2	you were, I think, referring to the first full
3	paragraph of the page.
4	MR. MOTLEY: Oh, okay. I see what
5	you're talking about.
6	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Down at the bottom of that
7	page -- I don't think we're on the same one.
8	MR. KRAUS: No, you're not.
9	THE WITNESS: No, I'm sorry. It's one
10	more.
11	MR. KRAUS: You're there.
12	THE WITNESS: Okay.
13	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Mr. Jacob, at the second
14	sentence in the first incomplete paragraph, says: As
15	the frequency of Congressional and other governmental
16	hearings quickened in the Sixties and Seventies, the
17	Tobacco Institute developed into an important and
18	rather effective organization.
19	You haven't reviewed, have you,
20	Tobacco Institute documents which relate to how
21	widely they disseminate certain pamphlets which
22	disputed that cigarettes cause disease, have you?
23	A. I've reviewed a host of pamphlets, but I
24	don't recall specific Tobacco Institute pamphlets. page	63
page	64
1	Q. Okay. Well, I'm going to go into that in a
2	few minutes.
3	A. Okay.
4	Q. Down -- the next thing I want to ask you
5	about is down at the bottom of page 4. Mr. Jacob
6	says the 1964 Surgeon General's report made a major
7	impact in the marketplace, resulting in a one-year
8	dip in sales. Are you familiar with that?
9	A. I don't quite see where we are. I'm sorry.
10	Is it --
11	Q. I'm not convinced we're on the same page.
12	What's the first word on that page that you're on?
13	A. "Which."
14	Q. Which. Well, we are, then. Down at the
15	bottom. It says the 1960s --
16	A. Okay.
17	Q. Mr. Jacob says that the 1964 Surgeon
18	General's report made a major impact in the
19	marketplace, resulting in a one-year dip in sales.
20	Are you familiar that sales actually -- for
21	cigarettes actually dipped in the year following the
22	release of the Surgeon General's report?
23	A. I don't know whether it was a whole year;
24	but there was a dip, yes. page	64
page	65
1	Q. Okay. It's maddening when these pages
2	don't come out so, have you to try to figure out
3	where we are here.
4	A. Is there a title?
5	Q. This is -- actually there's a page 10 and
6	you can see the 10.
7	A. I have it.
8	Q. Now, the next page is what I want to ask
9	you about. This is entitled "Political Aspects of
10	the Smoking and Health Issue." Mr. Jacob says in the
11	early Fifties the subject of smoking and health was
12	just beginning to be a matter of public awareness and
13	the thing that caught on was lung cancer.
14	You don't agree with that, do you?
15	A. No, I don't.
16	Q. Okay. He goes on to say during this
17	period, the early Fifties, the Government, Executive
18	Branch and the regulatory agencies and the Congress,
19	largely ignored the burgeoning controversy. Do you
20	agree or disagree?
21	A. I'm lost again. I'm sorry. I think I'm on
22	the wrong page.
23	Q. Does it say political aspects?
24	A. All right. page	65
page	66
1	Q. You're on the right page.
2	A. Okay.
3	Q. The last sentence of the first paragraph:
4	During this period the government largely ignored the
5	burgeoning controversy. Would you agree with that
6	statement?
7	A. I guess we've got early Fifties --
8	Q. Yes.
9	A. -- is what we're referring to.
10	Q. Yes, sir. I know the Blatnik hearings were
11	in '57.
12	A. Yes, the Blatnik hearings. So I would say
13	in the early Fifties there isn't really that much
14	Government activity.
15	Q. Okay. Then on the next page, Mr. Jacob
16	writes -- in the middle of the page, it says: In the
17	1965 Congressional hearings. Do you see that, almost
18	exactly in the middle of the page?
19	A. Is this like page 12 or 11?
20	Q. It's the page after the one we just saw.
21	A. That's going to be this one.
22	Q. Drop your finger down just a little bit.
23	Next paragraph.
24	A. Oh, okay. Got it. page	66
page	67
1	Q. In the 1965 Congressional hearings, the
2	industry put on a full-scale medical defense by
3	inviting testimony from 39 doctors and other
4	scientists who told Congress of their disagreement
5	with the conclusions on causation in the Surgeon
6	General's report.
7	Now, are you aware that at that
8	hearing the industry, in fact, did call witnesses to
9	dispute the Surgeon General's findings?
10	A. I have a general awareness.
11	Q. Okay. Page 18. And it does have a page on
12	the bottom.
13	A. A short page?
14	Q. Yes, sir. (Reading) In January 1979 -- the
15	second -- sentence -- Califano observed the
16	15th anniversary of the 1964 report by causing the
17	issuance of a monumental tome purporting to be an
18	overall review of the field. That 1979 report had
19	far more short-term media attention than long-range
20	scientific impact. The scientific view appears to be
21	that it contained nay.
19	Q. It's dated 8/24/78, memo from H. Steel to
20	M. McCue, M-C-C-U-E. It reads: Very few consumers
21	are aware of the effects of nicotine, i.e., its
22	addictive nature and that nicotine is a poison.
23	First, sir, did you know that nicotine
24	was a poison --
page	85
page	86
1	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
2	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) -- in some form?
3	A. Textbooks have been saying that to primary
4	school students since the 1880s.
5	Q. Well, you weren't here then, were you?
6	A. Well, no, but -- so there's no news there.
7	Q. So you -- your answer is that nicotine is a
8	poison and you knew that?
9	A. Well, I said textbooks have said that.
10	Q. Well --
11	A. And that's been widespread as part of the
12	general understanding of nicotine.
13	Q. Did you understand it to be a poison?
14	A. Well, I -- what are we talking about with
15	respect? In the 19th century there were all sorts of
16	pamphlets were talking about --
17	Q. Now, tell me about -- please. We've been
18	getting along pretty good here.
19	A. I know.
20	Q. And all I'm doing is asking you a simple
21	question. Were you --
22	A. Was I aware --
23	Q. James Kirby Martin --
24	A. If I would take straight nicotine, it would page	86
page	87
1	probability kill me. That's right.
2	Q. So you was aware -- that shows -- I was a
3	history major. They didn't teach me how to speak.
4	Were you -- you were aware, then,
5	nicotine was a poison?
6	MR. WAGNER: Object to form.
7	A. If you take a heavy dosage of nicotine,
8	it's going to probably kill you. That's right.
9	(Exhibit 15 marked)
10	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) This is hard to read,
11	Doctor. The second sentence is what I have reference
12	to.
13	A. Okay.
14	Q. Well, actually it says: The purpose of
15	this memo is to outline my views as to how consumer
16	attitudes towards nicotine will change in the near
17	future. In order to explain changes, I need to
18	explain present attitudes towards nicotine. Very few
19	consumers are aware of the effects of nicotine, i.e.,
20	its addictive nature and that nicotine is a poison.
21	Most members view nicotine as the number that allows
22	the tar -- that follows the tar figure on cigarette
23	packs. Hardly any consumers use nicotine numbers as
24	a basis for their purchase. Tests have been page	87
page	88
1	conducted to determine the effect of -- gosh, can you
2	read that?
3	A. No.
4	Q. (Reading) Of including nicotine numbers in
5	the advertising message. And in every case there
6	were adverse reactions to -- I think it's the ads.
7	A. I think so.
8	Q. Okay. Now, has any lawyer representing a
9	tobacco company shared with you any data to which
10	Mr. Steel is referring in this memo to Mr. McCue in
11	1978?
12	MR. KRAUS: Objection. I don't see
13	any reference to data in the memo.
14	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Go ahead, sir.
15	MR. KRAUS: You can answer the
16	question.
17	A. No, I'm -- no.
18	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Are you aware that some of
19	the cigarette companies had, within their
20	organization, consumer behavior departments that
21	looked at consumer behavior and consumer attitudes?
22	A. I would say yes because many large
23	corporations involved in selling a whole variety of
24	products have consumer affairs organizations or page	88
page	89
1	units.
2	Q. Have you been provided with any consumer
3	affair surveys of smoker attitudes toward the health
4	risks of cigarette products that they smoke?
5	A. Not that I'm aware of. I need a specific
6	example before I say no.
7	Q. Well, you don't recall any, do you?
8	A. No, I don't recall any.
9	Q. And have you asked for any?
10	A. Have I asked for any?
11	Q. Asked Womble, Carlyle or Shook, Hardy?
12	A. These are internal company documents --
13	Q. Yes.
14	A. -- that we've talked about?
15	Q. Yes. Well, but that explore consumer
16	attitudes towards cigarettes.
17	A. I haven't asked for that kind of
18	information. It's not part of the public record.
19	Q. Realizing full well that the Supreme Court
20	has ruled that the Food and Drug Administration
21	lacked jurisdiction to promulgate the regulations
22	that it did, I nevertheless ask you this question.
23	Prior to the Supreme Court's decision, had you read
24	the so-called Executive Summary of the Food and Drug page	89
page	90
1	Administration with respect to what was available to
2	that agency in 1980 with respect to nicotine and
3	consumers?
4	A. No.
5	Q. In -- are you familiar with the 1988
6	Surgeon General's report on nicotine addiction with
7	respect to relapse rates amongst people who try to
8	quit?
9	A. I've read portions of that report, and I
10	remember something about relapse rates. I don't
11	remember specific rates.
12	Q. That the rates are 75 to 80 percent -- that
13	is, people who try to quit maybe succeed like Mark
14	Twain. He said it's easy to quit, he'd done it a
15	million times.
16	A. I'm also familiar with 50 million people
17	have quit since the Surgeon General's report.
18	Q. How many of them start?
19	A. I have no idea.
20	Q. You don't have any idea?
21	A. No. I know what the popular number is,
22	because I hear it all the time.
23	Q. What's that?
24	A. Something like 3,000 a week or something. page	90
page	91
1	Q. That's children --
2	MR. WAGNER: Objection to the form.
3	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) -- under 18.
4	MR. WAGNER: Under 24.
5	MR. MOTLEY: That's what you say.
6	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Do you think the average
7	smoker understands that the relapse rates for smoking
8	are equivalent to that for heroin?
9	MR. WAGNER: Objection. Relevance.
10	A. I know that that's one of the arguments in
11	that report.
12	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Are you aware that in
13	December 1976 the British-American Tobacco Company
14	board received a report in which it was stated:
15	While it might be maintained that consumers are fully
16	aware of the alleged risks of smoking, they have
17	little or no knowledge of the non-tobacco
18	constituents?
19	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
20	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Have you ever seen such a
21	reference?
22	A. I don't even know what it means, let alone
23	see it.
24	Q. What about a 1977 Brown & Williamson page	91
page	92
1	marketing and advertising report that finds: This
2	would require establishing gas as a meaningful health
3	hazard in cigarettes because currently there is very
4	low consumer awareness or comprehension of the gas
5	problem?
6	MR. KRAUS: What's the question?
7	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Are you aware that such a
8	report was received?
9	A. By?
10	Q. Brown & Williamson marketing and
11	advertising report.
12	A. Is this an internal report?
13	Q. Yes, sir.
14	A. Well, then obviously not.
15	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
16	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Do you know what the gas
17	problem refers to in cigarette smoking?
18	A. The gas problem?
19	Q. Uh-huh.
2	0	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
21	A. Well, I suppose -- I'm not a chemist, but I
22	suppose it must have something to do -- this is my
23	personal opinion and not being a chemist. It has
24	something to do with what is released as tar is page	92
page	93
1	produced and as the cigarette burns.
2	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Have you previously in a
3	deposition been asked about a gentleman by the name
4	of Helmut Wakeham, the former vice-president for
5	research and development of Philip Morris?
6	A. The name doesn't -- isn't familiar to me.
7	Q. Are you aware that in 1968 he recommended
8	to the president of Philip Morris that asbestos
9	workers be alerted not to smoke?
10	MR. WAGNER: Objection to the form.
11	A. I haven't seen that document.
12	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) And that he repeated that
13	recommendation in 1970?
14	MR. KRAUS: Objection to the form.
15	A. I haven't seen these -- I haven't seen the
16	document, no.
17	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Have you seen a
18	recommendation by a medical consultant to the Tobacco
19	Advisory Council in 1980 that warning labels be
20	amended on packages of cigarettes in Great Britain,
21	to reflect synergism?
22	MR. WAGNER: Objection to the form.
23	Relevance.
24	A. In Great Britain? page	93
page	94
1	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Yes, sir.
2	A. I don't think so.
3	Q. Have you seen and been shown a memo of
4	Philip Morris in 19 -- in the early Eighties that the
5	cigarette companies will be unable to explain why
6	they didn't warn asbestos workers about synergism?
7	MR. KRAUS: Objection to the form.
8	A. I haven't seen. No, I haven't.
9	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) You mentioned earlier the
10	rotational warnings.
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. Are you familiar with the hearings that
13	took place in the FTC staff report recommendations
14	with respect to rotating warning labels?
15	A. I think I looked at that report a long time
16	ago. Is it approximately 1981?
17	Q. I believe so.
18	A. Okay. What I remember from it was that the
19	argument was being made that if we had yet more
20	specific warnings, this somehow would convince more
21	people to stop smoking. That is my best shot at it.
22	It's been a long time.
23	Q. Do you know what percent of construction
24	workers were smoking in the 1980s? page	94
page	95
1	A. Construction workers?
2	Q. Yes, sir.
3	A. Well, with a check of prevalence rates, I
4	would say -- I mean, I'm going to guess at this --
5	maybe 3 0 to 4 0 percent, something like that.
6	Q. Have you seen studies of asbestos-exposed
7	populations demonstrating that upwards of 80 percent
8	of those asbestos-exposed construction workers smoked
9	cigarettes?
10	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
11	A. Have I seen studies to that effect?
12	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Yes, sir.
13	A. Well, I've seen and have reviewed Selikoff
14	materials when he worked with the carpenters' union
15	in the late 1980-s, just before his death; and I
16	don't remember that figure specifically.
17	Q. Have you looked at the report of the Port
18	Allegheny, Pennsylvania, Health Surveillance Program
19	for workers at the Port Allegheny, Pittsburgh Corning
20	plant?
21	A. I've read about the Pittsburgh Corning
22	plant --
23	Q. The one in Tyler?
24	A. In -- work.
page	95
page	96
1	Q. That's the one in Tyler maybe.
2	A. Right. Well, but they also -- he talks
3	about Pittsburgh.
4	Q. Okay.
5	A. So whether -- I don't recall seeing that
6	specific report.
7	Q. Are you aware that the union and management
8	cooperated in the 1980s to have a community health
9	outreach program in that community and to institute a
10	smoking cessation program for the benefit of the
11	former employees of the Pittsburgh Corning Unibestos
12	plant and their families with respect to cigarette
13	smoking and asbestos?
14	A. I wasn't aware of that specific program,
15	but I'm aware that such programs --
16	Q. Are you aware --
17	A. -- begin to come into play in the mid to
18	late 1970s.
19	Q. Are you aware that in 1978 Dr. Selikoff
20	published a study in which he stated, after surveying
21	three shipyards, that most shipyard workers were
22	abysmally ignorant of the asbestos risk, except for
23	the insulation workers, and were totally ignorant of
24	the risks from cigarette smoking and asbestos page	96
page	97
1	combined?
2	MR. WAGNER: Objection to the form of
3	the question.
4	A. I've read a lot of Selikoff material, and I
5	wasn't aware of that specific statement.
6	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Have you looked at
7	Dr. Selikoff's published, in the medical literature,
8	reports on asbestos and disease?
9	A. Yes. I haven't looked at them all, but
10	I've looked at a few articles.
11	Q. Are you familiar with his Maxie Rosenow
12	lecture of 1978?
13	A. Well, you know, his list goes to about 30
14	pages. So --
15	Q. I know doctor -- knew Dr. Selikoff very
16	well.
17	A. Whether I'm familiar with that particular
18	lecture, I don't recall that particular lecture.
19	Q. Are you familiar with any studies done by
20	insurance companies at various shipyards in the
21	United States with respect to the level of awareness
22	of shipyard workers concerning asbestos generally and
23	asbestos and cigarettes specifically?
24	A. I'm aware that many insurance companies page	97
page	98
1	very early on, going back into the 1930s and 1940s,
2	would not insure asbestos workers.
3	Q. No, my question was are you aware -- first
4	of all, do you know that there are several different
5	kinds of shipyards -- or were -- in the United States
6	involved in building and repair of ships?
7	A. Oh, I'm sure there are; but I don't know
8	anything personally about shipbuilding. I've never
9	really been around ships.
10	Q. Have you ever heard the term "contract
11	shipyard"?
12	A. No.
13	Q. Have you ever heard of a shipyard in
14	Pascagoula, Mississippi?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. Do you recall the name of it?
17	A. No.
18	Q. Are you aware of any shipyards in the
19	Houston area?
20	A. I believe there are shipyards over in the
21	Houston Ship Channel. Whether they are actually
22	involved in the construction of ships per se --
23	Q. Or repair.
24	A. Or repair?
page	98
page	99
1	Q. I said --
2	A. Okay.
3	Q. Are you aware of the existence of shipyards
4	in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, which is on the east
5	bank of the Mississippi River, across from
6	New Orleans?
7	A. I've seen it.
8	Q. You've seen it --
9	A. Yeah, because I've been on some sort of --
10	I don't know what you call it, a paddle-wheeler
11	around the Mississippi River. So you go right by
12	them. Right across from downtown New Orleans.
13	Q. Are you aware of any surveys of contract
14	shipyard employees' knowledge of asbestos,
15	specifically in asbestos and cigarettes specifically
16	conducted by insurance companies for contract
17	shipyards?
18	A. No.
19	Q. Are you aware of a publication by
20	Selikoff's group called the Key Highway Study?
21	A. What year was it published?
22	Q. 1980.
23	A. The Key Highway Study?
24	Q. Yes, sir. page	99
page	100
1	A. Was this on his bibliography oft
3	five minutes and you're telling me that he doesn't
4	document --
5	A. Well, he talks about programs on CBS; but
6	the absence of program doesn't mean that anybody's
7	controlling the network.
8	Q. Well, do you know what all he did look at,
9	sir?
10	A. He said -- CBS apparently emerged
11	unscathed. Sorry, that's on page -- looks like 17 --
12	when the industry decided against direct retaliation.
13	In what sense? I find it very
14	interesting that he would not go to any of the
15	available public opinion polls that were out and
16	available by 1963 or along before which said the
17	message was getting through consistently and there
18	were high levels of awareness. He didn't do a
19	complete research job, looks like to me.
20	Q. Didn't do a good job?
21	A. I said he didn't do a complete research
22	job. I never said good or bad; I just said complete.
23	Q. Do you cite that report in your report?
24	A. No. page	114
page	115
1	Q. Do you make comment on that report in any
2	of your testimony that you've given by way of
3	deposition or trial testimony?
4	A. Have I ever commented on this report?
5	Q. That's correct. That's what I'm asking.
6	A. This is the first time I've had any kind of
7	a discussion -- that I can recall, the first time
8	I've had any kind of discussion about the report.
9	Q. Now, are you aware that in connection with
10	this gentleman, the assistant city editor of the
11	Washington Post's conclusion with respect to --
12	Conclusion No. 1 about confusion -- his words -- have
13	you seen the document from the Tobacco Institute
14	setting forth that the strategy of the tobacco
15	industry was to create doubt and confusion?
16	MR. KRAUS: Object to the form of the
17	question.
18	A. That's a non sequitur. How does one relate
19	to the other?
20	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Doubt and confusion?
21	Doubt --
22	A. Maybe we should go over the question again.
23	Q. Okay. (Reading) It has always been a
24	holding strategy consisting of creating doubt about page	115
page	116
1	the health charge, without actually denying it.
2	A. Is this -- are you reading from a certain
3	part of the report?
4	Q. No, I'm sorry, not that. I'm to another
5	issue. I ask you if you were aware that the Tobacco
6	Institute's vice-president reported to the president
7	of the Tobacco Institute that the tobacco industry's
8	strategy has been to create doubt about the health
9	charge, without actually denying it.
10	A. Is this one of the internal company
11	documents?
12	Q. It is, sir.
13	A. I'm not familiar with it, then.
14	Q. Now, let's see if any of this you might
15	find important. Did you consider any advocacy ads
16	that were placed by the Tobacco Institute and
17	R. J. Reynolds with respect to their contention that
18	the case against cigarettes had not been proven in
19	the Eighties?
20	A. Advocacy ads?
21	Q. Yeah. Have you seen the Wall Street
22	Journal this morning, by the way?
23	A. No, I haven't looked at it.
24	MR. MOTLEY: Would you get that for
page	116
page	117
1	me? Y'all should have one under the door of your
2	room.
3	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) You know what an advocacy
4	ad is?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. Are you aware, for example, that even today
7	Philip Morris placed a full-page or a half-page -- I
8	can't remember -- advocacy ad with respect to how
9	they've changed their conduct?
10	MR. WAGNER: Objection. Irrelevant.
11	A. I have the Wall Street Journal.
12	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) You have it with you?
13	A. No. I was -- it was under my door. I'll
14	take it home and give it to my wife. She'll read it
15	tonight or tomorrow, something like that. I read USA
16	Today.
17	Q.	Wall Street Journal doesn't have a sports
18	section very often, does it? Now, with respect to --
19	A. With the state of the Houston Astros, I
2	0	don't need to read sports anymore.
21	Q. Are you familiar with an advocacy ad
22	campaign that R. J. Reynolds launched in the 1980s
23	with respect to smoking and health issues?
24	A. Well, I may have seen instances of page	117
page	118
1	advocacy --
2	Q. Advocacy.
3	A. -- I'm sorry, advocacy advertising. I
4	don't recall any particular item.
5	Q. Have you considered the number of press
6	releases that were issued by the Tobacco Institute
7	and the number of media outlets which printed
8	excerpts from those press releases?
9	A. Well, I think I gave you -- excuse me. I
10	gave you the example of commentary in New York Times
11	articles between 1950 and 1957.
12	Q. Right.
13	A. I would assume that some of that commentary
14	would have come out of press releases that were being
15	put out by perhaps a particular tobacco company or
16	TIRC, one or more of those articles featured
17	particular tobacco company executives, so that what I
18	can tell you is in that sense yes. I can also tell
19	you, as a former university administrator, all the
20	press releases in the world doesn't necessarily mean
21	any of them are printed anywhere in any newspaper.
22	We proved that at Rutgers, big time.
23	Q. But you missed the second part of my
24	question, which was the Tobacco Institute's tracking page	118
page	119
1	of the success of their press releases in receiving
2	public airing -- A-I-R-I-N-G -- in media outlets.
3	A. No, I haven't.
4	Q. You haven't seen any of that information?
5	A. The TI tracking?
6	Q. Yes.
7	A. No.
8	Q. What about have you considered the effect
9	of grassroots campaigns by organizations funded by
10	the tobacco industry with respect to smoking and
11	health issues?
12	A. I don't know what you're referring to.
13	Q. Do you know what the NSA is?
14	A. National Smokers' Association.
15	Q. Alliance. But that's close.
16	A. Alliance. Okay. I'm sorry.
17	Q. Are you familiar with their efforts to
18	defend the rights of smokers?
19	A. Oh, in a vague way. But I've not read
20	their literature.
21	Q. Do you know -- have you asked for or
22	received the various press releases of the National
23	Smokers' Alliance?
24	A. No. page	119
page	120
1	Q. Are you familiar with the Healthy Buildings
2	International?
3	A. Healthy Buildings?
4	Q. International.
5	A. Building? Like the building like we're in
6	today?
7	Q. Right. I hope it's not a building like
8	we're in today.
9	A. I hope so, too. No, I'm not.
10	Q. What about ICOSI?
11	A. I don't know what that is.
12	Q. Have you ever asked for or seen a list of
13	the various advocacy films that the tobacco companies
14	have produced with respect to smoking and health
15	issues?
16	MR. WAGNER: Object to form.
17	A. Advocacy films? I'm --
18	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Documentary.
19	A. We talked about those particular films.
20	I'm aware that some of those are there but -- I've
21	looked at a lot of films. Most of them are produced
22	by such agencies as the American Cancer Society,
23	which have high credibility on this subject.
24	Q. Well, have you looked at any of the films page	120
page	121
1	produced by the Tobacco Institute?
2	A. I don't recall that I have, no.
3	Q. Have you compared the number of viewings of
4	the American Cancer Society's films versus the
5	viewings of the Tobacco Institute's films?
6	A. What I -- I give you just one example.
7	Q. Can you say yes or no and then give me one
8	example?
9	A. Yes, I can. I haven't studied the Tobacco
10	Institute's films. But I can tell you the American
11	Cancer Society, I've looked at their annual reports
12	and the American Cancer Society repeatedly made
13	efforts to put films out in the hands of every
14	primary, secondary school, public and private, in the
15	United States. And they did this in the Sixties and
16	into the 1970s. It was part of their overall public
17	education campaign.
18	Q. Right.
19	A. And the numbers were -- in terms of the
20	give-aways, were in the thousands -- 40, 50, 60,000,
21	depending on the number of schools -- and the number
22	of viewings were in the millions.
23	Q. Do you know how many consumer outreach
24	efforts were conducted by, for example, page	121
page	122
1	R. J. Reynolds to respond to consumer requests for
2	information and to -- well, just leave it at that.
3	A. Consumer?
4	Q. Consumer. Joe Bow, the smoker, would write
5	and ask R. J. Reynolds and say, "Are you putting
6	chemicals in my cigarettes and, if so, what kind?"
7	And R. J. Reynolds would respond in the form of a
8	letter to that smoker who made such an inquiry. Are
9	you familiar with how many of those have occurred?
10	A. I'm much more familiar with what the
11	National Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health has done
12	with those kinds of --
13	Q. So you don't have an answer to my question
14	because the truth of the matter is you haven't asked
15	R. J. Reynolds about that, have you?
16	A. Are those --
17	MR. WAGNER: Objection to the form.
18	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Have you?
19	A. Are those internal company documents?
20	Q. I'm asking you if you are aware of how many
21	consumer inquiry responses R. J. Reynolds made a
22	private mailing to a smoker or a customer who writes
23	in for information?
24	A. I'm not aware of any specific number. page	122
page	123
1	Q. Same question with respect to Philip
2	Morris.
3	A. No.
4	Q. How about general mailings to consumers?
5	Do you --
6	MR. MOTLEY: Well, it's a
7	two-thirds-of-a-page ad. I'll mark this in a second.
8	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Are you -- have you
9	inquired of R. J. Reynolds as to whether or not they
10	have made general mailings to consumers with respect
11	to smoking and health issues?
12	A. No.
13	Q. Have you -- are you familiar with the True
14	Magazine Incident?
15	A. I can't give you any details about it, but
16	I am familiar with the incident.
17	Q. What do you know about it?
18	A. Well, there was some sort of an article
19	published in the 1960s which made various claims --
20	and I don't remember the details of it. I looked at
21	that a long time ago.
22	Q. Now, I want to ask you specific to a
23	document -- let me ask you about this one. And I
24	don't know that I have another copy. So I'll give page	123
page	124
1	you mine. It's called the --
2	(Exhibit 17 marked)
3	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) This is No. 17 for the
4	record. It's called "The Smoking Controversy: A
5	Perspective," in 1978. Are you familiar with that
6	publication?
7	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
8	A. No, I haven't seen this. I don't recall
9	seeing this document.
10	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Have you inquired as to how
11	widely it was disseminated?
12	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
13	A. No.
14	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Do you know whether or not
15	it contains a statement about asbestos and cigarettes
16	interaction?
17	A. If I haven't looked at it, I wouldn't know.
18	Q. Are you -- have you been shown the
19	testimony of Dr. Julius Richmond, the former Surgeon
20	General of the United States, who issued the 1979
21	Surgeon General's Report?
22	MR. MOTLEY: That's not a Bliley.
23	A. What --
24	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Julius Richmond. page	124
page	125
1	A. Testimony?
2	Q. Testimony in a case with respect to his
3	efforts to educate asbestos-exposed individuals, as
4	Surgeon General, of the hazards of asbestos and
5	cigarette smoking and with what success he was able
6	to make such a communication.
7	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
8	MR. KRAUS: Could I ask you, testimony
9	from where?
10	MR. MOTLEY: Testimony in the case of
11	Wiley versus -- W-I-L-E-Y -- versus R. J. Reynolds, I
12	think.
13	A. Well, I've looked at all the materials with
14	respect to the Califano-Richmond campaign and I know
15	that Richmond sent a letter to 400,000 doctors --
16	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Correct.
17	A. -- that he was involved in developing a
18	whole range of other materials and that those
19	materials varied from everything from radio and TV
20	spot announcements to posters which were put up in
21	shipyards and other locations, to various other
22	aspects. That I do know that.
2	3	Q. You do know that. But do you know what
24	success rate Dr. Richmond has testified he -page	125
page	126
1	testified that he achieved with respect to alerting
2	asbestos-exposed workers of the hazards of the
3	combination of cigarettes and asbestos?
4	A. I'm not familiar with his testimony at all.
5	Q. Okay. And you don't know what he did to
6	ascertain the success of the program, do you?
7	A. Well, I mean, like I said, I'm not familiar
8	with the testimony, you know.
9	Q. But are you familiar with what steps
10	Dr. Richmond took to assay the success or failure of
11	his efforts to inform asbestos-exposed workers not to
12	smoke?
13	A. Well, I am familiar with the survey --
14	Q. Which one?
15	A. -- that was done in 1978 and 1979 and I
16	would presume that Dr. Richmond must have had some
17	involvement in that and that survey said that in
18	terms --
19	Q. Which one, sir. '78? You said you haven't
20	seen '79?
21	A. I've read about '79.
22	Q. What -- where did you read about it?
23	A. An article -- and I believe it's called
24	Communications Journal. I think that's the name of page	126
page	127
1	the journal.
2	Q. And what was the gist of the conclusion of
3	that article?
4	A. That it was a successful campaign in
5	raising levels of awareness about health dangers
6	associated with asbestos.
7	Q. That that was a successful campaign. And
8	what did they base that upon?
9	A. They based it upon three surveys.
10	Q. Three surveys. '78, '79, and '8 0?
11	A. No, I believe there were two surveys --
12	there was an initial survey before they began the
13	campaign, roughly June of '78, and then there were
14	follow-ups in '79.
15	Q. And what was the third one?
16	A. There was a second follow up. I think the
17	that, as I remember it -- I haven't looked at that
18	article in the last few weeks -- as I remember it,
19	there was a pre-campaign survey. There was then a
20	survey while the campaign was ongoing, and then there
21	was a follow-up survey after the campaign was
22	fundamentally over. And that was well into 1979, the
23	third survey.
24	Q. And did you list this, whatever the title page	127
page	128
1	of it is, as a reliance material of yours?
2	A. I believe so, yes.
3	Q. And have you provided us with a copy of
4	that?
5	MS. FRANKEL: Yeah.
6	A. Well, it's with the reliance materials; and
7	I think there's a full set available.
8	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) All right. Now, are you
9	familiar with, in addition to the '78 and '79
10	surveys, what Dr. Richmond himself directed to be
11	done to try to find out the success rate of his
12	campaigns that they began in '78 and continued
13	through '79 with respect to asbestos and cigarette
14	interaction?
15	A. Beyond the '79, the final survey? No.
16	Q. Have you ever heard of the College of
17	Tobacco Knowledge?
18	A. I don't think so.
19	Q. Do you know how many appearances in any
20	given year that spokespersons for the Tobacco
21	Institute made on public on -- not Public
22	Television -- but on television shows?
23	A. Spokespersons for TI?
24	Q. Uh-huh. page	128
page	129
1	A. No.
2	Q. Do you know who Brennan Dawson is?
3	A. No.
4	Q. What about Bob Tollison?
5	A. Tol --
6	Q. Tollison. T-O-L-L-I-S-O-N.
7	A. I can't say for sure, no.
8	Q. What about Walker Merryman?
9	A. Walker Merryman?
10	Q. Merryman.
11	A. No.
12	Q. Have you -- just as a general question -- I
13	won't have to go through all of these things. But I
14	take it you don't know the efforts the Tobacco
15	Institute expended on tracking the success of getting
16	their message in various media outlets, just as a
17	general proposition?
18	MR. KRAUS: Objection. Asked and
19	answered.
20	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) You don't have that
21	information?
22	MR. MOTLEY: Well, I don't want to go
23	through each one of these --
24	MR. KRAUSE: No, you asked that page	129
page	130
1	specific --
2	MR. MOTLEY: Yeah, I -- but I want to
3	make sure it's clear on the record, if you don't --
4	if you'd indulge me so I don't have to go through
5	this long list.
6	A. I haven't gone through Tobacco Institute
7	materials that relate to that particular matter.
8	MR. MOTLEY: That saves us a lot of
9	time.
10	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Doctor, do you recall the
11	contaminated Tylenol bottle incident?
12	A. Maybe, yes. Is it -- let me try to
13	describe it.
14	Q. Sure.
15	A. Was this where a woman had punctured the
16	wrapper or something like that and then --
17	Q. Well, I don't know if --
18	A. -- laced it with some sort of --
19	Q. I don't know if it was --
20	A. -- undesirable chemical?
21	Q. I don't know if it was a man or a woman.
22	A. Okay. I'm sorry.
23	Q. No, but that's the gist of it?
24	A. Okay. page	130
page	131
1	Q. And do you recall the response of Johnson &
2	Johnson, the manufacturers of Tylenol, what they did
3	once they found that out?
4	A. I think that, if I'm not mistaken, they did
5	some sort of recall, at least in that particular part
6	of the country? And I'm going to guess but I think
7	it was in Milwaukee or in that area.
8	Q. Have you ever heard of something called
9	TIML?
10	A. TIML?
11	Q. Yes.
12	A. No, I don't know what that stands for.
13	Q. Are you aware that Philip Morris conducted
14	a recall campaign because their cigarettes were
15	contaminated with a substance?
16	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
17	A. TIML? Recall? No.
18	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Have you ever heard of
19	the Micronite -- it's MITC, I'm sorry. It's not
20	TIML.
21	MR. KRAUS: You had two of the letters
22	right, even three.
23	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) If they had TIML in there,
24	I'm sure they'd recall it. MITC. page	131
page	132
1	MR. KRAUS: In all seriousness, does
2	that change your answer in any way?
3	THE WITNESS: No.
4	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Do you know what urea is,
5	U-R-E-A?
6	A. Doesn't sound good. But, no, I don't think
7	so.
8	Q. What about Coumarin, C-O-U-M-A-R-I-N?
9	A. Coumarin?
10	Q. Coumarin.
11	A. I don't think so. These are chemicals?
12	Could I just ask?
13	Q. Yes.
14	A. They're chemicals?
15	Q. Yes.
16	A. No.
17	Q. Crocidolite asbestos. Do you know what
18	that is?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Are you aware that Kent cigarettes had
21	crocidolite asbestos filters?
22	A. For a brief period back in the early
23	Fifties, yes.
24	Q. Are you aware of the allegation that page	132
page	133
1	R. J. Reynolds' cigarettes were contaminated with
2	asbestos, an allegation made by someone here in
3	Texas?
4	A. I don't know.
5	Q. Have you asked whether any of the cigarette
6	companies have ever discovered whether their
7	cigarettes or their filters are contaminated with
8	asbestos?
9	A. Well, I'm familiar -- the only one I'm --
10	incident that I'm familiar with is the Kent, the
11	original Micronite filter.
12	Q. Right.
13	A. And I think that was '52, '53, something
14	like that. 1952, '53.
15	Q. Do you believe there's a -- from what
16	you've read, is there a safe level of exposure to
17	asbestos, which will not produce disease?
18	A. According to what I've read, the conclusion
19	of the United States Government is there was no safe
2	0	level.
21	Q. Do you know what the recommended -- do you
22	know what maximum allowable concentration means?
23	A. Yes, sir.
24	Q. What does it mean with respect to asbestos?
page	133
page	134
1	A. Well, it means the number of -- in layman's
2	terms -- because I don't know a difference between
3	milliliters and millimeters and that sort of thing --
4	I'm not trying to pretend I'm a scientist. It has to
5	do with the number of fibers -- or sometimes the term
6	"dust" can be used -- that would be in the air, in a
7	certain cubic space of the air. That would be my
8	working definition, I guess.
9	Q. Do you know what the maximal -- maximum
10	allowable concentration for asbestos-containing
11	products was from 1948 to 1960?
12	A. I think it was over -- it was in the 12 to
13	15, if not higher, range.
14	Q. Twelve to 15 of what?
15	A. Well, that's the problem. I -- 12 to 15 --
16	would it be a milliliters? Is that the
17	appropriate --
18	Q. That's the appropriate term, but that's not
19	the appropriate standard for '48 to '60. Have you
20	ever heard of something called 5 million particles
21	per cubic foot?
22	A. Well, maybe that's what we're -- all I can
23	tell you is that I've seen the number drop from -- I
24	thought it was around 15 or something like that, page	134
page	135
1	based on a 1938 standard, to in the area of 5, which
2	was done in the early to mid Seventies, to the area
3	of 2, which I don't know whether that was in the late
4	Seventies or early Eighties. And Dr. Selikoff and
5	others were arguing at that time that there was no
6	safe level, that you could not even have a -- that
7	the 2 number would not even be acceptable.
8	Q. Then I take it are you unaware of the
9	difference between million particles per cubic foot
10	and milliliters --
11	A. I'm really --
12	Q. -- per CC?
13	A. When it comes to math --
14	Q. Excuse me, fibers per milliliter.
15	A. When it comes to these scientific terms, I
16	really don't feel comfortable with them. I'm a
17	historian. I just -- I got a sense that there were
18	too much in the air and there were attempts to reduce
19	it. What the specific formula was, I gave you my
20	best approximation; and I believe that as of 1990
21	there's no approximation. It's off the table,
22	asbestos at least.
23	Q. Do you know when the Environmental
24	Protection Agency first announced a partial ban of page	135
page	136
1	asbestos products of any kind?
2	A. First announced an asbestos ban?
3	Q. Ban, B-A-N.
4	A. It's in the 1980s, I believe.
5	Q. Do you know what the term friable,
6	F-R-I-A-B-L-E, means?
7	A. Friable. Doesn't sound good, but I'm not
8	sure.
9	Q. Are you aware of any participation by the
10	Tobacco Institute in OSHA proceedings with respect to
11	asbestos?
12	A. OSHA proceedings with TI?
13	Q. Yes.
14	A. No.
15	Q. Have you ever heard of the name, the
16	Asbestos Information Association of North America?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Have you ever looked at any documents,
19	public pronouncements and the like from the Asbestos
20	Information Association?
21	A. I've seen some documents.
22	Q. Are you familiar with a survey that was
23	done by the Asbestos Information Association of North
24	America in 1973 to ascertain the level of awareness page	136
page	137
1	by the American public of the health hazards
2	association with exposure to asbestos?
3	A. No.
4	Q. Are you aware of the position that the
5	Asbestos Information Association, through its law
6	firm, Kirkland & Ellis, took with respect to the 1976
7	OSHA proceedings, specific to the issue of asbestos
8	and cigarette interaction?
9	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
10	A. No, I'm not. Nothing's coming to mind
11	about that.
12	(Exhibit 18 marked)
13	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Now, what this is actually
14	the speech as it was presented and then the minutes
15	as they were typed up. So it's really the same
16	thing, but you'll see two different kinds of types.
17	You see that type, and then you see the minutes
18	typed.
19	A. Okay.
20	(Discussion off the record)
21	MR. KRAUS: This is Exhibit 18.
22	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Okay. Professor, if you'd
23	kindly look -- it's well in here. Let's see. One,
24	two -page	137 page	138
1	A. Is it after "About the Speaker," or is it
2	not that far?
3	Q. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
4	11, 12, 13, 14, 15 -- Okay. The presentation is
5	right here. It says "Why Asbestos?"
6	A. I'm through to "About the Speaker." Is it
7	after the speaker?
8	Q. Next page. It says "Why Asbestos?" And
9	then he asks the rhetorical question in the second
10	paragraph: "Why us? Can asbestos really be all that
11	bad?" The date of this is June 7, 1973. Okay?
12	A. Okay.
13	Q. Now, if you turn over multiple pages -- and
14	I apologize, I can't tell you how many pages. Let me
15	see if I can tell you how many pages. "Why
16	Asbestos?"
17	Okay. If you start with "Why
18	Asbestos?" as page 1, you go over --
19	A. Actually the page number's up at the top.
20	It says page 5, 6, and then --
21	Q. This should be -- yeah, page 8. You're
22	right. My clip was in the way. And then in the third
23	paragraph, Mr. Swetonic, the executive director of
24	the Asbestos Information Association, says: And now, page	138
page	139
1	having heard the bad side of the public relations
2	problem, it's time for some good news. The good news
3	is despite all the articles on asbestos health that
4	have appeared in the press over the past half a dozen
5	years, very few people have been paying attention.
6	Let me explain. In February the Association
7	undertook a personal interview research survey of the
8	American public to determine its attitude toward
9	asbestos and its awareness of the health issue. The
10	survey was conducted by the Opinion Research
11	Corporation during March and April. More than 2,000
12	demographically selected Americans were interviewed.
13	Were you aware that that had been
14	undertaken?
15	A. No.
16	Q. (Reading) Without going into enormous
17	detail, the results show that only 23 percent of the
18	American public are aware of the health hazards of
19	asbestos and that 80 percent of those 23 percent
20	consider it a hazard only to those who are
21	occupationally exposed. A mere 3 percent of those
22	interviewed stated that they considered asbestos a
23	health hazard to the general public and less than
24	one quarter of 1 percent considered it the most page	139
page	140
1	dangerous material on the list they were given to
2	choose from. Surprisingly, college-age youths of
3	America are no more aware of the hazards of asbestos
4	than their parents and grandparents. These results
5	should be reassuring to those industry customers who
6	fear that the general public will stop buying their
7	products because they contain asbestos.
8	Now, I take it this is the first time
9	you've seen this?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. And have you seen the underlying opinion
12	research data from which Mr. Swetonic makes his
13	speech?
14	A. No.
15	Q. Okay. To be fair to Mr. Swetonic, he does
16	say there's bad news. And he says: Our figures show
17	that 20 of the 25,000 deaths, or 80 percent, will
18	occur among those in the insulation trades.
19	So he says there's bad news here, too;
20	and he talks about the appalling death rates from
21	insulation workers.
22	A. Well, he must be basing that on Selikoff.
23	Q. He was, yes. Right.
24	A. Right. page	140
page	141
1	Q. Now, are you aware of any efforts of the
2	asbestos industry to demonize, if I can use a Motley
3	phrase, Dr. Selikoff?
4	A. The asbestos industry?
5	Q. Yes.
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Okay. What are you aware of?
8	A. I read an article that appeared in the 1973
9	New York Times weekly magazine. I think the author's
10	name was Robert Sherrill. And there is a
11	vice-president from Johns Manville and in that
12	particular article he refers to Dr. Selikoff as
13	something like an enthusiast, I think is the term.
14	That may be not as strong of a term or it may be too
15	strong, but that's the kind of term that's used.
16	Q. Are you aware --
17	A. A "true believer" maybe would be the kind
18	of image.
19	Q. What about a dangerous man?
20	A. A dangerous man?
21	Q. Yes.
22	A. I haven't seen that in the material that
23	I've reviewed. I don't recall that.
24	Q. Same question with respect to the tobacco page	141
page	142
1	companies. Have you seen any documents that would
2	relate to any efforts to demonize Dr. Selikoff?
3	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
4	MR. KRAUS: Demonizing efforts by the
5	tobacco companies?
6	MR. MOTLEY: Yes.
7	MR. KRAUS: Object to the form of the
8	question.
9	A. I'm not aware of anything.
10	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Are you aware of the
11	efforts of R. J. Reynolds to obtain Dr. Selikoff's
12	data from his 1979 survey?
13	A. You mean the survey that he wrote up in
14	1979 --
15	Q. The prospective survey of 17,000 --
16	A. No, I'm not -- I've read the article, but
17	I'm not aware.
18	Q. Do you know if there's 17,800 members -- or
19	if there were -- who were enrolled in the prospective
2	0	study by Dr. Selikoff, do you know how many of them
21	lived in Canada, 'cause it was the insulation
22	workers -- Heat Frost Insulation and Asbestos Workers
23	of North America. It was Canada and the U.S. Do you
24	know what percent lived in Canada? page	142
page	143
1	A. No, I don't. I couldn't make a reasonable
2	guess of that.
3	Q. Do you know what percent of insulation
4	workers in the United States were not members of the
5	heat frost -- let's just call it the asbestos
6	workers' union, 'cause that's what they called
7	themselves.
8	A. Well, the insulators workers' union, we
9	can --
10	Q. Right.
11	A. -- call it to keep it separate from other
12	asbestos workers.
13	Q. Right.
14	A. I have -- yes, I've seen some numbers about
15	estimates about that and, as I remember, it was in
16	the five, 10,000 area, something like that.
17	Q. Have you ever visited the Brooklyn
18	shipyard?
19	A. Have I personally?
20	Q. Yes, sir.
21	A. No, I have not.
22	Q. Have you reviewed any documents that were
23	generated out of the Brooklyn naval shipyard?
24	A. Perhaps the material has come through in page	143
page	144
1	our -- through the discovery process. I'm not
2	recalling a specific document that's there. We have
3	a great number of shipyard-related documents.
4	Q. Do you know what the Ship Builders Council
5	is?
6	A. Ship Builders Council.
7	Q. C-O-U-N-C-I-L.
8	A. I know what council cement.
9	Q. I was just making sure he wasn't spelling
10	it C-O-U-N-S-E-L.
11	A. No, I'm not sure.
12	Q. Are you aware of any surveys conducted by
13	the Ship Builders Council with respect to the
14	knowledge of asbestos hazards amongst contract
15	shipyards' employees?
16	A. By?
17	Q. The Ship Builders Council.
18	A. I'm not.
19	Q. Are you familiar with any surveys of
20	Brooklyn naval shipyard employees with respect to the
21	knowledge of asbestos hazards?
22	A. Brooklyn -- could you repeat?
23	Q. Brooklyn naval shipyard. Any surveys that
24	might have been conducted of the knowledge of the page	144
page	145
1	employees of the Brooklyn naval shipyard of asbestos
2	health hazards?
3	A. Specifically when?
4	Q. At any time.
5	A. Anytime? Well, after 1984 you have to
6	inform the employees of risks associated with
7	asbestos and the possible -- the synergistic
8	relationship. I suppose after that point the ship
9	workers are being informed.
10	Q. Did you -- do you know whether or not the
11	Brooklyn naval shipyard was in operation in 1984?
12	A. I don't know anything about the Brooklyn
13	naval shipyard.
14	Q. Do you know what the rate of lung cancer is
15	amongst Brooklyn naval shipyard ex-employees?
16	A. I don't recall reading any studies --
17	although I'm not saying there weren't -- about
18	workers in the Brooklyn naval shipyard. I know there
19	are a number of studies of shipyard workers, but I
20	don't recall specifically the Brooklyn naval
21	shipyard.
22	Q. Have you ever heard of the Bath, B-A-T-H,
23	shipyard?
24	A. In? page	145
page	146
1	Q. Maine.
2	A. Maine? No.
3	Q. Newport News Shipbuilding Company?
4	A. Well, I've been in Newport News. So I
5	would take it the company would probably be in
6	Newport News.
7	Q. Do you know whether it's a shipyard that
8	was -- I'm looking for the right word -- I'll just
9	use "run" -- run by the U.S. Government or was it a
10	private shipyard?
11	A. No, I don't know. I know that some
12	shipyards are run by the U.S. and there were
13	certainly, I think, more back at the time of the
14	Second World War than today. But there are a number
15	of shipyards that have been run by the U.S.
16	Government and the United States Navy.
17	Q. Are you aware of any efforts to ascertain
18	the level of awareness or the fact of awareness of
19	Newport News Shipbuilding Company's employees?
20	A. Well, only insofar as have been included in
21	the --
22	Q. The '84 thing?
23	A. Right. Or '78. It was '78 referring to
24	the Richmond and Califano program. page	146
page	147
1	Q. Okay. And are you familiar with the names
2	of any other shipyards in the New York metropolitan
3	area other than Brooklyn naval shipyard?
4	A. Well, I -- the only one -- I don't know how
5	close this is to New York but the Groton,
6	Connecticut, shipyard. General Dynamics. Selikoff
7	studied them very thoroughly in the mid-Seventies.
8	Q. Yes, sir. When -- have you looked at the
9	medical literature with respect to asbestos and
10	cigarettes interaction between 1968 and 1979?
11	A. The medical literature?
12	Q. Yes, sir.
13	A. I've looked at the proceedings of the
14	New York Academy of Sciences in 1978 and '79. I've
15	looked at the proceedings of the New York Academy
16	in '64 which were published in '65. They cover a
17	great variety of topics; and since I'm not a medical
18	doctor, some of it is quite difficult for me to
19	understand.
20	Q. Do you know whether or not the cigarette
21	companies have studied the smoking prevalence of
22	blue-collar workers?
23	A. I can't answer that question. I'm not
24	aware of a study. page	147
page	148
1	Q. Do you know whether blue-collar workers
2	start smoking earlier than their white-collar
3	compatriots?
4	A. I haven't seen studies to that effect.
5	Q. Do you know whether blue-collar workers
6	smoke more cigarettes per day than their white-collar
7	compatriots?
8	A. Per day?
9	Q. Per day.
10	A. I can only point to the -- I believe these
11	are the Harris polling studies done in the 1980s
12	which talk about awareness of the harmful effects of
13	cigarettes, and there the numbers of blue-collar
14	workers and union members are fairly consistent.
15	Q. Polling data?
16	A. Yes, polling data.
17	Q. I wasn't talking about awareness; I was
18	talking number of cigarettes.
19	A. Yes. The reason I keep going back to
20	awareness is that's what I was asked to investigate.
21	Q. Right. Do you know whether cigarette
22	companies targeted specifically construction workers
23	for different marketing campaigns?
24	MR. KRAUS: Objection to the form of page	148
page	149
1	the question.
2	A. I don't. I have no knowledge of that.
3	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Do you know how much money
4	cigarette companies spent on advertising promotion in
5	1997?
6	A. I don't know how much any company spent on
7	advertising in 1997.
8	Q. Okay. Would you believe the figure of
9	$6.5 billion would represent a fairly substantial
10	advertising and promotional budget?
11	A. It depends on relative to what other
12	industries. I don't know whether that's No. 1 or
13	No. 50. Without the comparative analysis, I couldn't
14	comment on whether that's a meaningful figure or not.
15	To me personally, that's a lot of money.
16	MR. MOTLEY: Okay. Can we take a
17	little break and let me see how much more I've got to
18	do, 'cause I know everybody's anxious to get home.
19	MR. KRAUS: Okay.
20	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time now is
21	approximately 12:33 and we're off the record.
22	(Recess taken)
23	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time now is
24	approximately 12:44. We're back on the record. page	149
page	150
1	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Doctor, I handed you while
2	we're off the record a rather old textbook. Would
3	you mind reading the title and the author into the
4	record, please.
5	A. Sure. It's Edwin -- I'm sorry, sometimes
6	these glasses don't work. Edward Hallet Carr, What
7	is History? Published, according to the title page,
8	in 1961 by Knopf.
9	Q. And, Doctor, I believe you told us off the
10	record that that's not a book that you use in your
11	practice of the methodology of historians?
12	A. Well, I may use the methods that are in
13	there but it's not -- there are a number of such
14	books.
15	Q. Right. Okay. Now, with -- if someone were
16	to do a point-in-time survey like, let's say, 1995,
17	if you were to go out and interview 2,000
18	demographically representative persons and inquire of
19	their knowledge in that year, 1995, of whether
20	cigarette smoking causes lung cancer and is a cause
21	of lung cancer and other such questions, could you --
22	and I want to emphasize this is a point-in-time
23	survey. This is not a survey where in 1995 they ask
24	the people, the respondent, when did you first hear page	150
page	151
1	and they get different dates, 1950 or 1970 or
2	whatever. It's a point-in-time survey, what do know
3	today. As a historian, can you use a study such as
4	that to relate back to the Fifties and Sixties?
5	A. Yes, I think you can.
6	Q. In what way?
7	A. Well, it's a point-in-time survey. So
8	you've taken a snapshot of a representative group of
9	the population out there on the landscape, presumably
10	that landscape being the United States. So this
11	would be a representative group, and you have their
12	sense of what their knowledge was in 1995. Now, if
13	similar such studies have been -- occurred at other
14	points in time -- and I know that they actually
15	have -- then it's very possible to do a comparison in
16	the long term. You can then chart a long-term
17	pattern with respect to what knowledge was at
18	particular points in time, including 1995.
19	Q. Okay. Are you familiar with a discipline
20	of social science that's called the history of
21	medicine?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. Are you familiar with practitioners of that
24	particular social science? page	151
page	152
1	A. Of that particular social science? Yes.
2	Q. Have you ever published an article on the
3	history of medicine?
4	A. No.
5	Q. Are you familiar that are there -- with the
6	Columbia University School of History?
7	A. Yes, I'm familiar with the Columbia
8	department.
9	Q. Is the Columbia department -- as a general
10	matter, I realize you've probably got a couple of
11	people in Houston that ought not be there -- but do
12	you as a general proposition believe that the
13	Columbia University School of History is well thought
14	of nationally?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. Have you ever read any articles on specific
17	methodologies with respect to studying the history of
18	medicine?
19	A. Studying the history of medicine?
20	Q. Yes, sir.
21	A. Specific articles on that?
22	Q. Yes, sir.
23	A. Only insofar as those would relate to
24	general studies about the way to go about conducting page	152
page	153
1	research in history.
2	Q. Now, we've talked earlier -- and this will
3	be the last area of inquiry -- about the '78 report
4	of which you've seen and the '79 report which you've
5	seen referred to but haven't been able to get a copy
6	of yet.
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. And I would ask you are you familiar with
9	the in the '78 poll, conducted in June 1978 by and
10	published by the National Cancer Institute, September
11	the 11th, 1978, that finds that non-white, low social
12	economic groups, Southerners, and those unaware of
13	the health risks of asbestos exposure most frequently
14	indicated that they did not know when symptoms of
15	illness would be most likely to occur? Do you recall
16	that finding?
17	MR. WAGNER: Objection.
18	A. Not that particular finding, no.
19	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Okay. All respondents on
20	an unaided basis -- in other words, no prompting --
21	were asked what, if anything, they thought people who
22	may have been exposed to asbestos could do to reduce
23	their health risks. Are you familiar with the
24	finding that stopping smoking was only responded to page	153
page	154
1	by 2 percent --
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. -- of the respondents and that 6 percent
4	even said there's nothing we can do, the fatalist --
5	I think they use the word "fatalistic" response that
6	there is nothing that can be done was achieved by
7	6 percent?
8	A. I think that's right, but there was also a
9	don't know. Would that be part of that 6 percent?
10	Q. I don't know the answer to that because I
11	don't have it in front of me.
12	A. Okay.
13	Q. The conclusions by the '78 survey was --
14	were awareness of asbestos as a topical subject was
15	not especially high in June 1978 when this study was
16	conducted. Only half of all respondents claimed to
17	have heard or read something on asbestos, with the
18	important subgroups of those 50 and over being
19	somewhat more aware, 55 percent, and manual labor
20	slightly less aware, 43 percent.
21	Do you recall that? I know I'm
22	reading to you. Take my representation that's part
23	of it.
24	A. I vaguely remember these numbers, yes. page	154
page	155
1	Q. (Reading) Even when aiding respondents --
2	prompting -- by asking directly whether people
3	exposed to asbestos have an increased risk of
4	illness, only 58 percent of total respondents answer
5	yes. This level also holds for older Americans but
6	declines to only 50 percent for manual laborers.
7	Among non-whites, the understanding that asbestos
8	increases risk to illness is at only 36 percent.
9	Does that do violence to your memory
10	of the conclusions from that report or some of the
11	conclusions?
12	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
13	A. The -- this was the -- I just want to make
14	sure that I've got this straight. The June '78
15	report is done -- I'm sorry, the survey was done
16	prior to.
17	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Correct.
18	A. And it was also a general national survey
19	that was not targeting specific national population
2	0	groups.
21	Q. Correct.
22	A. Okay.
23	Q. Correct. Now, have you been provided with
24	any focus group surveys or focus group information by page	155
page	156
1	the cigarette companies where they would do focus
2	groups of different types of smokers to ascertain
3	what they knew about smoking and health?
4	MR. WAGNER: Objection to form.
5	MR. KRAUS: Assumes a fact not in
6	evidence.
7	A. No, I haven't seen any material on focus
8	group meetings.
9	Q. (BY MR. MOTLEY) Okay. Are focus groups
10	sometimes helpful?
11	A. There are a lot of them being done out
12	there with a lot of different corporations. So
13	someone must think they're helpful.
14	Q. I take it, then, you're not aware of focus
15	group surveys that were done of asbestos-exposed
16	individuals in 1980 with respect to their knowledge
17	of health hazards generally and specifically with
18	respect to smoking and asbestos exposure?
19	MR. WAGNER: Object to the form.
20	A. Focus groups --
21	Q.	(BY MR. MOTLEY) Surveys --
22	A. Focus groups.
23	Q. -- of asbestos-exposed individuals.
24	A. Done by? page	156
page	157
1	Q. Jesus Christ, what was of the name of that
2	group? I'll have to provide that for you?
3	A. Okay.
4	Q. But it was an opinion research group.
5	A. I'm not --
6	Q. Not familiar?
7	A. Doesn't ring any bells.
8	MR. MOTLEY: Okay. I am through. And
9	it's nice to meet you, sir.
10	THE WITNESS: Thank you.
11	MR. MOTLEY: I hope you have a nice
12	weekend.
13	I hope you folks make your plane.
14	This concludes the deposition pursuant
15	to the Court's Order on behalf of Falise and whoever
16	else the Court's Order applies to. I don't know the
17	ins or outs of that. If it applies to somebody else,
18	then it applies to somebody else.
