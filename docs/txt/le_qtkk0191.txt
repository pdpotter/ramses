19	LACY K. FORD, JR., M.D.,
20	having been first duly sworn, was examined and testified
21	as follows:
22	CROSS-EXAMINATION
23	BY MR. PAIGE:
24	Q All right. Please state your name for the
25	record, sir.
4
1	A I'm Lacy Ford.
2	Q And when were you first retained in this
3	case?
4	A I was retained in this case in November of
5	2009.
6	Q And who contacted you?
7	A Mr. Paul Koethe from the Jones Day law firm
8	representing R.J. Reynolds.
9	Q And how did he contact you?
10	A He called me by phone.
11	Q Okay. And what were you asked to do in
12	this case?
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	A He asked me if I would be willing to serve
14	as the expert witness on the historical awareness of
15	the health risks of smoking and reviewed some of
16	the -- I guess the details of the lawsuit with me.
17	Q what details did you review with him?
18	A He explained that the, that the smoker in
19	the case was a lifelong Florida resident; explained
20	something about the time table of the trial and a
21	potential deposition; explained to me that it was
22	essentially a lung cancer and -- case; and asked me
23	if I thought I would be able to do it in the, in the
24	time that I would have, and I agreed.
25	Q So you're saying he talked to you about --
5
1	he asked you if you would be the historian on
2	awareness, correct?
3	A Yes; that's correct.
4	Q Do you testify on common knowledge as well?
5	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
6	Q (By Mr. Paige) For example, are you going to
7	testify as to what the common knowledge was about the
8	health hazards of smoking and, and disease?
9	A Yes. I expect to testify as I have in
10	other cases about -- a little bit about the history
11	of smoking, the history of the health risks
12	associated with smoking, what the public knew, what
13	information came to the public at various points in
14	time throughout pertinent time periods about what the
15	public knew about the health risks of smoking.
16	Q In terms of common knowledge, how do you
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	define common knowledge?
18	A Common knowledge is information that was
19	available to ordinary people, people from all walks
20	of life. It was not simply something that experts
21	knew. It was information that was broadly and widely
22	circulated among the general public at a given point
23	in time.
24	Q Do you, do you believe that common
25	knowledge requires a awareness by the public or a
6
1	belief by the public?
2	A I believe essentially, by definition,
3	knowledge is the information that people have and
4	common knowledge is information that's common among a
5	broad spectrum of people, what people -- how they
6	evaluate that information, what they decide to do
7	with that information are all things that go into
8	belief. And while belief is certainly something that
9	I look at and testify about, I believe that public
10	awareness is -- and the information that the public
11	has is the best indicator of what was common
12	knowledge at any given time.
13	Q How many Engle cases have you been retained
14	on in total?
15	A I testified in one case in addition to this
16	one, and I think currently I've been disclosed in two
17	others.
18	Q Okay. How many have you been retained on
19	but not disclosed?
20	A Received information for consulting
21	purposes on two or three other cases, which it's --
Page 5
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	none of which it is my understanding are currently
23	still pending. I don't remember the names of those
24	cases. And in none of those cases did I do very much
25	work, as I recall.
7
1	Q Okay. So you've only been, you've only
2	been retained as an expert or a consultant on five
3	Engle cases is your testimony?
4	A Five or six I would say is correct.
5	Q So half of those you've been disclosed on
6	and the other half you were just a consultant who was
7	not disclosed?
8	A That's my understanding. Yes. I think
9	these were cases that did not progress very far
10	toward trial.
11	Q How about in general? Have you been
12	retained as a consultant to help out other tobacco
13	historians get up to speed on learning this area?
14	A No, I have not.
15	Q Have you consulted with other tobacco
16	historians?
17	A No, I have not.
18	Q You've never -- you never spoke to or wrote
19	or e-mailed with Professor Martin?
20	A Oh, I've spoken to him. I have on occasion
21	requested that he send me materials, but I've never
22	consulted with him about opinions in any case or any
23	testimony I would give or anything of that nature.
24	Q Okay. Tell me about how many times you've
25	spoken to Professor Martin about this type of work.
1	MS. BROWN: Object to form.
2	THE WITNESS: I have not spoken with
3	Professor Martin recently that I recall. I've
4	been doing this type of work now for about 14
5	years and I've probably talked to him maybe a
6	half dozen times in that. That would be a rough
7	estimate.
8	Q (By Mr. Paige) And when was the last time you
9	spoke to him?
10	A I don't recall, it's not been recently.
11	Q was it within the past couple years?
12	A As I say, I don't recall. I think it's
13	been probably -- well, it's been more than a year and
14	less than four, somewhere in that time frame.
15	Q Okay. And what, what were your
16	communications with him about? You said that he sent
17	you information, or you sent him information?
18	A I think that we have had both types of
19	exchanges. I have called him and asked if in any of
20	his research he might have a particular set of
21	newspapers or materials that I needed to look at and
22	asked him to send them to me, and he has done the
23	same with me on a few occasions.
24	Q Now, when you're communicating with
25	Professor Martin, do you bill for that time or do you
9
1	do that on your own free time?
2	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
3	THE WITNESS: Well, generally, if it's just
Page 7
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	a brief phone call, I certainly don't bill for
5	that period of time. Now, the -- of course,
6	I -- if he sends me some material, I bill for
7	revi ewi ng that.
8	MS. BROWN: Mr. Paige.
9	MR. PAIGE: Yeah.
10	MS. BROWN: Just can we agree that
11	objection by one defendant counts as an
12	objection for both?
13	MR. PAIGE: Yes.
14	MS. BROWN: Thank you.
15	Q (By Mr. Paige) At, at -- other than Professor
16	Martin, what other tobacco historians have you
17	communicated with about this line of work?
18	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
19	THE WITNESS: if by "tobacco historians"
20	you mean historians who testify -- have
21	testified for the defense, I have communicated
22	with five or six other historians.
23	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. And who are they?
24	A Communicated with Professor Jeff Norrell of
25	the University of Tennessee; communicated with
10
1	Professor Roger Sharp of Syracuse University. I've
2	communicated with Professor Luis Martinez in Florida.
3	I've communicated with Professor Greg Michelle. I've
4	communicated with Professor Cobb-Hoffman in
5	California. And I've --
6	Q Who was that?
7	A Lisa Cobb-Hoffman, I believe was her name.
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	Again, I have not communicated with her recently. I
9	may not have that exactly correct. And I have
10	communicated with Professor Bill Stuke at the
11	university of Georgia.
12	Q Okay. Now, these are all tobacco experts
13	who are testifying in Florida currently. Is that
14	your understanding?
15	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
16	THE WITNESS: I don't know. They're,
17	they're historians that I know who have done
18	research and testified in the past. I don't
19	know about Florida currently.
20	Q (By Mr. Paige) Well, have your communications
21	with them been generally about the Florida Engle
22	litigation and the history for Florida residents that
23	you're talking about?
24	A No. It's been a broader range of
25	communication than that. Some of the communication
11
1	has certainly involved Florida plaintiffs and some of
2	that would be cases coming out of the larger Engle
3	case, but that would only be a portion of the
4	communication. And not all of the communication have
5	been about that.
6	Q Now, in talking about Professor Stuke,
7	Martin, Hoffman, Michelle, Luis Martinez, Norrell and
8	the one from Syracuse that you mentioned, have you
9	met any of them in person?
10	A I believe that I have met all of them in
11	person except for Professor Cobb-Hoffman.
12	Q Okay. And when -- had you ever met -- been
Page 9
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	in a meeting with several of these historians at the
14	same time?
15	A No, I have not.
16	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
17	Q (By Mr. Paige) So it's just been one-on-one
18	meetings with them?
19	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
20	THE WITNESS: Well, in some instances it
21	wouldn't even be meetings. It would be running
22	into them at meetings -- at professional
23	organization meetings and being introduced or
24	shaking their hands or saying hello, so it
25	wouldn't all be meetings.
12
1	Q (By Mr. Paige) But in the meetings that you
2	had with these people, were they just one-on-one
3	meetings with you and them?
4	A if I -- if I've met with these people
5	individually, it would just be one-on-one meetings.
6	Yes.
7	Q Tell me about your meeting with Professor
8	Martin.
9	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: It's been a number of years
11	since I met with Professor Martin. I went to
12	Houston and met with Professor Martin to review
13	a collection of materials he had on union
14	publications from -- mostly from Ohio and West
15	Virginia. He made those collections available
16	to me. I reviewed them. I asked him to make
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	some copies of them. And that was the essence
18	of my meeting with Professor Martin that I
19	recal1.
20	Now, I have, I believe, encountered
21	Professor Martin at history conferences in
22	addition to that, but that was the only time I
23	had a meeting which involved material related to
24	this litigation.
25	Q (By Mr. Paige) Have you ever had a meeting
13
1	with you, Professor Martin and tobacco lawyers all in
2	the same room together or either by phone?
3	A No, I have not.
4	Q And what about the, the other professors
5	that you mentioned? Tell me about the meetings that
6	you had with Hoffman, Michelle, Martinez, Norrell, et
7	cetera.
8	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
9	THE WITNESS: As I, I think I indicated
10	earlier, I've not met Professor Hoffman.
11	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. I apologize.
12	A Professor Michelle visited Columbia a year
13	and a half or two years ago to look at copies of my
14	Florida newspaper collection, which I made available
15	to him. He made some copies of it and, and left. I
16	had a very short meeting with him and showed him my
17	materials and found a place he could look at them.
18	Q who was that? That was Michelle?
19	A Professor Michelle. Yes.
20	Q Okay. And how long was that meeting?
21	A You know, I, I -- let me correct myself,
Page 11
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	Mr. Paige. That may -- I may -- I'm actually not
23	sure now whether I've ever met with Professor
24	Michelle or not. I've talked to him on the phone.
25	The meeting I was thinking about in Columbia, I may
14
1	have been -- I know that -- well, I do believe
2	Professor Michelle visited Columbia and looked at my
3	materials, but I'm not absolutely certain. Professor
4	Martinez-Fernandez did and Professor Stuke did.
5	Q And Norrell?
6	A My relationship with Professor Norrell is
7	somewhat different in that he and I both worked in
8	the field of southern history more generally. Apart
9	from this litigation, we attend some of the same
10	conferences. I see Professor Norrell at the Southern
11	Historical Association meeting almost annually. And
12	I believe he visited Columbia one time and, and asked
13	to make some copies of material while he was on his
14	way to vacation on the Carolina coast. That's been
15	several years ago.
16	Q And what -- who was the, who was the
17	Professor from Syracuse again?
18	A Professor Roger Sharp.
19	Q Oh. And tell me about that meeting.
20	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
21	THE WITNESS: The only meeting I can recall
22	having with Professor Sharp in which tobacco
23	litigation was discussed was that we were at a
24	history meeting generally eight or ten years
25	ago. And he ran into me and, and told me that
15
1	he'd been asked to consult and possibly serve as
2	an expert in some tobacco cases and asked if he
3	could talk to me about the time commitment
4	involved. And we arranged to have coffee later
5	that afternoon and he met with me.
6	And I believe we had coffee and talked
7	about, you know, sort of the, the type of
8	research he would need to do and the time he
9	would have to put into it. I have not met with
10	Professor Sharp since that time, although we
11	have talked on the phone.
12	Q (By Mr. Paige) Did you provide him with
13	copies of your materials?
14	A He has requested some materials from me
15	over the years; not a great deal.
16	Q So Dr. Michelle, Luis Martinez, Norrell,
17	Martin and Stuke, you actually provided copies of
18	your reliance materials to them?
19	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
20	THE WITNESS: Well, no, sir. It doesn't
21	work exactly that way. I mean, it's not that,
22	that they -- they usually ask if I have a
23	specific thing, like a specific newspaper or a
24	specific magazine. And I would make copies of
25	the specific thing that they asked for and send
16
1	that to them.
2	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. And would these other
3	tobacc -- do you see a conflict or a problem with you
Page 13
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	communicating with other tobacco-retained experts --
5	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
6	Q (By Mr. Paige) -- about your testimony --
7	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
8	Q (By Mr. Paige) -- or about the work that
9	you're performing?
10	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
11	THE WITNESS: I don't. We don't discuss
12	our testimony or opinions with each other. And
13	historians do, I think, typically share
14	research. And so it seems to me that it's very
15	much what historians ordinarily do in their
16	scholarly work.
17	Q (By Mr. Paige) But when you say you don't
18	discuss your opinions, would you be surprised to know
19	that all of these people have the same exact opinions
20	as you do regarding common knowledge and awareness?
21	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
22	Q (By Mr. Paige) Do you know how that came to
23	be?
24	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
25	THE WITNESS: Well, I don't know exactly
17
1	what -- I mean, I know that all of these
2	historians testify for the defense. I don't
3	know exactly how they've arrived at their
4	opinions or exactly what -- how they frame their
5	testimony. Some of it may be the same as mine
6	and some of it may be different, but I do think
7	that, overwhelmingly, historians who would look
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	at this material would reach conclusions very
9	similar to the ones that I've reached in my
10	research.
11	Q (By Mr. Paige) Did -- now, in terms of these
12	other tobacco experts, have you communicated with them
13	by e-mail or letters at all?
14	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
15	THE WITNESS: Not that I can recall. No.
16	Q (By Mr. Paige) So you would be surprised if
17	any of these experts had an e-mail to or from you or
18	had a letter to or from you?
19	A I would be certain, virtually, that, that
20	they didn't have any letter from me related to
21	tobacco litigation or research or any e-mail in that
22	front. I think that I -- that some of them have
23	asked for me to send my mailing address to them by
24	e-mail, which I've probably done and they have that.
25	But that would be just the address that's on my CV,
18
1	which you have.
2	Q But do you have other e-mails or
3	correspondence to these experts aside from
4	tobacco-related research?
5	A None that I can recall. No.
6	Q Is there, is there a reason why you've
7	chosen not to put anything in writing when
8	communicating with any of your colleagues about this
9	type of work?
10	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
11	THE WITNESS: In thinking -- let me add
12	something to my previous answer, if I may, Mr.
Page 15
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	Paige. I think that Professor Norrell and I did
14	have correspondence. I served as an outside
15	referee for a tenured promotion case at the
16	University of Tennessee. And I think that he
17	corresponded with me asking me to do that, and I
18	responded to that. But that's not about this
19	litigation. But I think you asked a broader
20	question about anything and I wanted to -- I
21	remembered that after I answered.
22	No. It's, again, usually just a matter of
23	them calling me up, asking me a question if I
24	have something, am I willing to share it with
25	them, is it something I can copy and send to
19
1	them, or do they want to come look at it and
2	make a more selected copying request from it is
3	the general nature of the conversation.
4	Q (By Mr. Paige) Do you commonly use e-mail in
5	your professional life?
6	A Yes.
7	Q How many e-mails would you say that you
8	receive a day?
9	A Well, now that I'm chair of the department,
10	I probably receive 30 a day, mostly, you know, from
11	my own faculty. Before that, it would be a much
12	smaller number, maybe a third of that or something.
13	Q How long were you -- tell me how long the
14	meetings were when these experts visited you in
15	Columbia. How long was each meeting, more or less?
16	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	THE WITNESS: 20 to 30 minutes.
18	Q (By Mr. Paige) So they came all the way to
19	Columbia for a 20-minute meeting?
20	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
21	THE WITNESS: Well, generally, they, they
22	came to -- they'll come to Columbia to look at
23	materials I've collected. And, you know, I
24	don't really have time to sit there with them as
25	they review that, so I would give the material,
20
1	they would find a place to review it. we might
2	have breakfast together quickly before the day
3	started. And I would go in and -- to do my work
4	and they would do theirs and, and either get
5	copies made or, or sometimes leave something for
6	me to have copied and mailed to them. And so
7	they might be in Columbia for a day or day and a
8	half, but my time with them would be short.
9	Q (By Mr. Paige) So Professor Michelle or
10	Martin or Martinez-Fernandez would come all the way to
11	Columbia to look at your materials and copy your
12	materials for a day and a half, but only spend 20 or 30
13	minutes actually talking to you, and that may even
14	occur over breakfast?
15	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
16	Q (By Mr. Paige) Is that what you're saying?
17	A In my recollection, it usually occurred
18	over breakfast and it may have taken, you know, maybe
19	somewhere between 20 and 40 minutes, but not a great
20	length of time.
21	Q Okay. But that was correct what I said? I
Page 17
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	repeated what you said accurately?
23	A I mean, I think, yeah, that's -- that
24	was -- that's the general pattern when that happens.
25	Yes.
21
1	Q But I don't understand because, for
2	example, I got copies of your materials -- probably
3	the same materials as you had those professors look
4	at in your office -- and I was just copied a disk and
5	sent to me in my office in Hollywood. Is there a
6	reason why you would recommend or ask them or not
7	discourage them from getting on a plane and coming
8	all the way to your office to look at the materials
9	when you could just mail them a disk?
10	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
11	THE WITNESS: Well, again, it's -- your
12	request to me was to turn over a reliance list,
13	which is, you know, a large thing of materials
14	that I reviewed that help form my opinions in
15	this or another particular case. Generally what
16	other historians are asking for is to look at,
17	at simply material that I may have from one
18	source that they, they don't have, aren't able
19	to get readily.
20	And in fact, I do -- if it's, if it's a
21	small amount of material, I do say why don't I
22	just copy what I have and send it to you and you
23	don't have to come here and look at it. But
24	sometimes they want for their own purposes to
25	review a large -- maybe a larger body of
1	material, say an entire newspaper and, and
2	decide what they need from it making their own
3	evaluation of that rather than relying entirely
4	on mine. And when they want to do that, that's
5	fine.
6	Q (By Mr. Paige) I'm sorry. So essentially
7	what, what would they come and look at? Give me an
8	example that would not be on the disk that you sent me
9	that would require them or warrant them coming all the
10	way to your office.
11	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
12	THE WITNESS: Again, I think that it would
13	be material that's, that's on the disk that,
14	that you've been sent in all likelihood. But I
15	think most historians are interested in doing
16	their own research and making their own
17	evaluations of the material and they are in the
18	process of doing that. Sometimes I can assist
19	them in one certain area. And so, you know, I
20	may have a copy of, of a particular newspaper
21	that, that I've worked on in some case over the
22	years. Just hypothetically, Charleston, West
23	Virginia newspapers I've done a lot of research
24	in. I have a large collection of those and
25	somebody might want to come in and take a look
23
1	at just those newspapers. So that's the type of
2	thing that I'm talking about.
3	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. Tell me what type --
Page 19
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	obviously, for this case, nobody would be coming to
5	look at the Charleston, west Virginia newspaper. So
6	what is it that you have in your library that's not on
7	a disk that the other tobacco experts would have to go
8	through and do their own research to arrive at
9	ultimately what is probably on your own disk?
10	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
11	Q (By Mr. Paige) what are you talking about?
12	Like do you have all The Mi ami Heralds in your office or
13	something like that?
14	A Well, again, I'm saying that I think
15	that -- I'm not saying that they come to look at
16	things that are not on the disk that you have. I'm
17	just saying that that disk is, is a large amount of
18	research turned over as, as is proper in the
19	litigation that we're involved in so that you, you
20	have a copy of it. But most historians are not going
21	to ask another historian to turn over an entire body
22	of research like that. They are -- that would be
23	unusual. What's much more common for historians
24	doing anything is to share some particular source.
25	And to answer the other half of your
24
1	question in terms of the Florida cases, I do have a
2	pretty extensive collection of many Florida
3	newspapers because I was involved in Florida cases
4	almost from the beginning of my involvement with this
5	type of litigation. And others have come to Florida
6	cases much later, as there's been a large number of
7	them in this post Engle phase. And so I do have a
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	large collection of Florida newspapers and other
9	Florida materials and I, I assume that's the reason
10	that -- I mean, well, that is the reason, I think,
11	that -- it's not the reason in every case that people
12	have come. Some have wanted other things. But in
13	terms of, of Florida materials, that's essentially
14	the reason that they would ask for some assistance
15	from me.
16	Q Right. For example, you have a reliance
17	list and Professor Martin has a reliance list, it
18	wouldn't surprise you that you both have the same
19	exact articles from the same exact newspapers on each
20	of your reliance lists because he went to your office
21	and looked at your materials, would that surprise
22	you?
23	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
24	THE WITNESS: I haven't seen Professor
25	Martin's reliance list. And I don't recall, I
25
1	mean, that Professor Martin has looked at, at my
2	Florida collection, if he has a collection of
3	Florida newspapers, I may have -- he may have --
4	I may have sent him some at his request, but
5	he's not a person that I recalled looking at
6	them.
7	Q (By Mr. Paige) And what about Professor
8	Michelle?
9	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: Professor Michelle did come
11	and look at some Florida newspapers. I'm sure
12	that he's looked at others as well.
Page 21
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	Q (By Mr. Paige) Did he come alone?
14	A That's my recollection.
15	Q And I guess what I'm trying to get at is
16	say, for example, one of the papers Professor
17	Michelle looked at was The Mi ami Heraid. Do you have
18	certain Miami Herald articles on your reliance list?
19	Do you have a greater library of Miami Herald articles
20	that you gave to him and say, here, go at it and take
21	which ones you want, or do you give him the exact
22	ones on your reliance list?
23	A Oh, no. I would, I would show him all or
24	make available to him all copies from The Mi ami Herald
25	that I have, and not all of those would be on my
26
1	reliance list.
2	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
3	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. So you, so you have
4	articles from particular papers that you've reviewed
5	but that you've chosen not to include on your reliance
6	list?
7	A Yes. The reliance list does not include
8	everything that I've reviewed by any stretch of the
9	imagination.
10	Q All right. For example, there might be --
11	in The Mi ami Herald there may be certain anti-tobacco
12	articles with headlines that you have reviewed but
13	you did not include in your reliance list?
14	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
15	Gary, are you asking about articles that
16	he's reviewed for this case or just ever?
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	MR. PAIGE: Ever.
18	MR. WALKER: Okay.
19	THE WITNESS: Well, again, the best answer
20	I can give there is that my reliance list in
21	this case is intended to, to include materials
22	that I used in developing my opinion for this
23	case, but it is only a subset of a larger body
24	of materials that I would, would have reviewed
25	over time. And that would include articles of a
27
1	variety of descriptions.
2	Q (By Mr. Paige) For example, you -- your
3	expert opinion on common knowledge and public awareness
4	is not only based on these reliance materials, but it's
5	based upon your broader education, knowledge and
6	experience, would you agree with that?
7	A Yes. My opinion is certainly based on all
8	of those things. And the reliance list is not an
9	exhaustive list of everything I've reviewed.
10	Q Okay. For example, I couldn't -- you
11	wouldn't expect me to be able to go to court after
12	reviewing your reliance list and say, hey, I'm an
13	expert historian now, I could rely upon these
14	documents and now these are my expert opinions,
15	because your opinions are not only based upon these
16	materials, but based upon your articles you've read,
17	books that you've read, things that basically give
18	you your reason for being an expert and the basis for
19	a lot of these opinions.
20	MR. WALKER: Objection.
21	Q (By Mr. Paige) Do you agree with that?
Page 23
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
23	THE WITNESS: Well, I think that it is my
24	education and training as a historian as well as
25	the entire body of research that I've done in
28
1	this area that I use for expertise. And a
2	reliance list in general are things that I think
3	can be useful in providing the basis for the
4	opinions I'm going to give in a particular case.
5	So if something wasn't particularly -- certainly
6	reviewed newspapers, for example, that are not
7	particularly pertinent to the, the Cohen case
8	that are not on my reliance list for this
9	particular case.
10	Now, obviously, there is -- there are a lot
11	of materials on the reliance list and I won't be
12	able to use all of them in illustration, but
13	only a small fraction of them, but they do
14	provide the sort of foundation for an opinion in
15	this particular case. But that's a different
16	thing from saying that it's all the materials
17	I've reviewed.
18	Q (By Mr. Paige) All right. This foundation is
19	taken from a broader foundation, correct?
20	A Yes. I think that it is a foundation
21	that's necessary for this particular case, in my
22	estimation, but that doesn't mean that, you know,
23	obviously my larger opinions are informed by some
24	other materials. But I think the reliance list
25	would, would be a firm foundation for supporting
29
1	the -- my testimony in this case.
2	Q All right.
3	MR. WALKER: And I had an objection to
4	form. Remember to give me a moment to get it
5	in.
6	THE WITNESS: I apologize.
7	MR. PAIGE: You know what? John, I'll just
8	give you a standing objection to form. So we
9	don't really need to be interrupted, it's fine.
10	You don't have to worry about that.
11	Q (By Mr. Paige) But I want to ask you
12	professor, for example, and then I'm going to move on:
13	There are polls, for example, that you have in your
14	reliance materials, the Roper polls, the Gallup polls,
15	which are obviously the leading polls. You obviously
16	have done other readings of other materials or
17	textbooks to let -- that you're relying upon to say
18	that those are the leading polls, but you haven't
19	included those textbooks or readings on your reliance
20	list, is that a fair statement?
21	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
22	THE WITNESS: Yes. My broader training and
23	expertise as a historian allows me to identify,
24	you know, what leading newspapers are, what
25	leading polling organizations are. And I don't
30
1	know that in the reliance list I have attempted
2	to provide documentation for those things.
3	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. If you knew today -- I
Page 25
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	know you don't and I'm not asking you. If you knew
5	today which 200 exhibits -- do you know which 200
6	exhibits that you were going to be relying upon at
7	trial, would you be able to give me that list or is
8	there a reason why you feel it's necessary to give me
9	4- or 5,000 exhibits if you're not going to be using
10	them at trial?
11	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
12	THE WITNESS: Well, I don't know. I mean,
13	the biggest reason I couldn't give it to you
14	today is I don't know what particular
15	illustrations I would use at trial. And to some
16	extent, I guess, I'll have to say that this may
17	require legal expertise that I don't have. My
18	understanding of the reliance list is that it's
19	a broad list of things that undergird your
20	opinion and which you might -- which form a
21	larger body of which you will draw some for use
22	at trial. Now, that -- whether that's legally
23	accurate or not, I don't know. But that
24	would -- that's all I can say --
25	Q (By Mr. Paige) Well, who told you that?
31
1	A -- all I can say about that.
2	Q Who told you that?
3	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
4	THE WITNESS: In, in being involved in this
5	case, as I guess -- I couldn't pinpoint a single
6	attorney, but attorneys have advised that your
7	reliance list is kind of self-defining. it's
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	kind of materials you rely on for this
9	particular case; not everything you've ever
10	seen, but rely upon for this particular case.
11	And so that's why, I think, it is the way it is
12	at this point.
13	Q (By Mr. Paige) But it's not everything you've
14	relied upon? It's not everything you've relied upon?
15	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
16	THE WITNESS: It's certainly not everything
17	I've examined in acquiring my larger expertise
18	on the subject. I think that it would more than
19	cover what I would need to draw on for this
20	particular case.
21	Q (By Mr. Paige) Can you -- if you were asked
22	by the court to give us the -- strike that.
23	In Sherman, I think you used less than a
24	hundred exhibits. Let's say it was more or less a
25	hundred exhibits that you used in Sherman for trial.
32
1	if you were asked to provide us with 200 exhibits or
2	300 exhibits that you might use at trial as opposed
3	to this 5,000 exhibit list, would you be able to do
4	that, or is there a reason why you just physically
5	cannot do that?
6	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
7	THE WITNESS: I -- that's just not
8	something that I've undertaken to do at this
9	point. No, I couldn't do that today.
10	Q (By Mr. Paige) But, but if the court asked
11	you to do that, you could do that within a couple of
12	weeks?
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
14	And, Gary, you're asking if he knew what he
15	wanted to use at trial? is that the
16	hypothetical?
17	MR. PAIGE: John, if the expert has a
18	problem with the question he could ask me to
19	rephrase it. And I will resent the fact that
20	he's now telling me he doesn't understand it
21	because you have indicated he shouldn't
22	understand it.
23	MR. WALKER: Well, earlier you made that a
24	condition of your question. I just want to be
25	clear about --
33
1	MR. PAIGE: John, I'm going to call the
2	judge. I'm not going to, I'm not going to waste
3	my time. Please, I'm telling you, you have a
4	standing objection to form. If you want to say
5	form, go ahead. If you want to jump in and
6	interrupt, I'm going to call the judge.
7	MR. WALKER: Just tell me: So you're
8	refusing to answer that to clarify your
9	question?
10	MR. PAIGE: I'm not answering your
11	questions today. That's right.
12	MR. WALKER: Okay. You won't clarify a
13	question. Thank you.
14	MR. PAIGE: I won't clarify a question for
15	you. You're not being asked the questions.
16	THE WITNESS: It's my expectation that as,
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	as I -- in consultation with Mr. Walker and
18	others, that as we prepare for the direct
19	testimony, we will turn over the materials I
20	decide to use for demonstratives in this case to
21	you at -- whenever that's appropriate. That's
22	my best answer.
23	Q (By Mr. Paige) How long does it generally
24	take -- okay. You've done that before in other cases,
25	correct?
34
1	A Yes.
2	Q How long does the process usually take --
3	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
4	Q (By Mr. Paige) -- to get your list down from
5	5,000 to a hundred or two?
6	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
7	THE WITNESS: Well, it's a process that
8	takes quite a number of weeks. And at times
9	there are issues that might come up as you
10	present your case at trial that I had probably
11	not -- perhaps not intended to testify about,
12	but would might decide to if some new issue
13	arises for me to address. So I'm just reluctant
14	to say that that's something I could do in any
15	precise period of time.
16	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. But aside from any new
17	issues that might arise, you could certainly -- without
18	being confined to a specific list, but a list that you
19	could expand on if needed, it would take you I think
20	you said a few weeks to do that, to go through these
21	thousand exhibits and get down to a couple hundred?
Page 29
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
23	THE WITNESS: It would take, it would take
24	several weeks probably, given my schedule, to do
25	that.
35
1	Q (By Mr. Paige) why does it take so long? is
2	it because you have to read everything?
3	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
4	THE WITNESS: Well, it -- there are a lot
5	of items to choose from in some respects and so,
6	yeah, it just takes some time to do. And it's
7	not something I'm able to devote full time to at
8	this point so, you know, I have to think about
9	other commitments that I have as well.
10	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. How much were you --
11	how much have you been paid or how much have you billed
12	for this case so far?
13	A I have billed for six hours of work in
14	November. And I have not yet done so, but I will
15	bill for 32 hours of work in December.
16	Q And what would the 32 hours of work -- was
17	that basically reviewing depositions and re-reviewing
18	your materials?
19	A Yes.
20	Q And before trial, how much time between now
21	and trial do you anticipate that you will put into
22	this case in preparation for trial such as scaling
23	down your list and getting your testimony in order?
24	A Let's see. I've gotten about 40 hours --
25	38 to 40 in right now, so it would probably be
36
1	something in the 40- to 60-hour range. It would run
2	a little longer or it could be a little less, but
3	that would be my best estimate at this point.
4	Q I think in Sherman you had told me that you
5	had billed 140 hours for that case before you got on
6	the stand. Do you think it will be more or less the
7	same for this case?
8	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
9	THE WITNESS: I would say that, that it
10	would be, without limiting myself one way or the
11	other, 120 to 150 hours in a case like this I
12	think is kind of the normal range.
13	Q (By Mr. Paige) And that does not include the
14	actual time you bill for at trial --
15	A Well, probably the total --
16	Q -- or does that?
17	A The --if, if, if I told you at trial that
18	I had 140 hours, that was prior to the testimony.
19	But my 120 to 150 estimate includes trial testimony.
20	Q And just tell me basically your income.
21	what did you make, what did you make last year more
22	or less doing tobacco-related work for the tobacco
23	companies?
24	A In, in 2009, I believe a little more than
25	$25,000.
37
1	Q That was your total for expert work and
2	consult work and review and research, et cetera?
3	That was your total amount you earned last year?
Page 31
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	A Yes. That's a rough, rough estimate.
5	That's it.
6	Q And what about the years preceding that?
7	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
8	THE WITNESS: Best estimate I can give you
9	is that I have averaged since I've been doing
10	this work 30- to $35,000 a year of income from
11	it. That varies. Some years are higher, some
12	years are lower. The last two to three years
13	have been lower is my recollection. But
14	probably more than 20 but less than 35. And,
15	again, that's --
16	Q (By Mr. Paige) And that started in 1994?
17	A 1995.
18	Q '95. Now, wasn't it -- didn't you tell me
19	the first couple years you had billed more, though,
20	just getting up to speed and doing your initial
21	research?
22	A Actually, I had -- based on my recollection
23	and not having reviewed those numbers recently, I
24	don't believe that those early first couple of years
25	were above average -- above the average that I've
38
1	given in terms of income. I think that the above
2	average years were years that I was involved in more
3	than one trial, and those came later.
4	Q But -- so what is your -- you're telling me
5	under oath today, including all the work you did for
6	Engle, all the consultation work that you've done,
7	you have earned no more than roughly more or less a
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	half a million dollars?
9	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: I would have to do the, do
11	the math in my head. It might -- you know,
12	certainly less than 600,000, I would say.
13	MR. PAIGE: Can we take a two-minute break,
14	a bathroom break --
15	THE WITNESS: Sure.
16	MR. PAIGE: -- John?
17	MR. WALKER: Yes.
18	(whereupon, a brief recess was taken.)
19	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. Last time I deposed you
20	we spoke about your publications that you've written on
21	cigarettes or tobacco or anything in that arena. Can
22	you just tell me about that briefly on the record so I
23	have it for this case what your experience is in
24	writing on topics tobacco related?
25	A I think, as I indicated to you last time,
39
1	some of my publications do include brief discussions
2	of tobacco as a cash crop, its impact in the economy
3	in various parts of the south at particular periods
4	of time. You know, the -- my publications do not
5	address the substance of my testimony in these, in
6	these cases as I would say generally.
7	Q All right. You have not published any
8	articles, books, chapters, peer review articles or
9	anything, anything on public awareness of the health
10	hazards of smoking cigarettes, correct?
11	A That's correct.
12	Q And you've not been asked to do so by
Page 33
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	any -- anybody, to write or get involved in any such
14	publications, to co-author or be the lead author,
15	correct?
16	A That's not, not entirely correct. No.
17	Over the course of time I have been asked on two or
18	three occasions at least to make a presentation on
19	the subject, but I have not done so.
20	Q What type of presentation are you talking
21	about?
22	A My apologies for taking some time on this.
23	It's been a number of years now. There was a -- an
24	organization that I wasn't familiar with. I think it
25	was the Mealey, m-e-a-l-e-y, organization asked me to
40
1	make a presentation at a conference they were holding
2	out west. This was in the late '90s or early 2000s.
3	it may have been a continuing legal education type of
4	conference, it didn't look like the type of thing
5	that as a historian I would typically do, and I
6	declined that invitation.
7	And a historian whose name I can't remember
8	asked me if I would be interested in doing a panel at
9	the historic -- at a historical convention about it,
10	and I wasn't. So I have been asked to do a coup --
11	to make presentations, but I have not done so.
12	Q Okay. The Mealey organization, you would
13	agree, is not a very well-known organization,
14	correct?
15	A I couldn't say that. It wasn't well known
16	to me as a historian. It might be quite well known
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	in some other discipline, but I --
18	Q It might be well -- I'm sorry?
19	A It might be well-known among scholars in
20	some other discipline, but it's not well -- wasn't
21	well-known to me as a historian.
22	Q Okay. So other than the presentation by
23	the Mealey organization and the panel discussion by
24	the historian, who you don't know his name, you've
25	never been asked to make a presentation on common
41
1	knowledge of the health hazards of tobacco, correct?
2	A That's my recollection.
3	Q That you can recall?
4	A That's right.
5	Q And in terms of books, you've never been
6	asked by a publisher or a peer review journal or
7	another author to serve as the primary or co-author
8	on any articles that are tobacco related that you can
9	recall?
10	A That is correct. Although an add to that
11	that it's really not typical to be solicited as a
12	historian in that particular fashion, but -- it's not
13	unknown, but it's not common.
14	Q Well, it's not unusual if somebody is
15	writing an article to ask you to join in as a
16	co-author? That happens all the time, doesn't it, in
17	peer review journals?
18	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
19	THE WITNESS: I would say that it happens.
20	Most -- there are relatively few co-authored
21	pieces. There are some and I have been a
Page 35
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	co-author in historical journals. But, usually,
23	articles are not solicited by journals but
24	submitted by authors is the point I was trying
25	to make.
42
1	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. But -- okay. So no
2	author has asked you to assist as a co-author on a peer
3	review -- or article to be submitted to a peer review
4	journal on the issues that you've been retained as an
5	expert in this case, correct?
6	A That's my recollection. Yes.
7	Q And you've never had an article that you
8	wrote accepted by any peer review journal in the
9	world expressing the opinions that you're going to
10	express to the jury, correct?
11	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
12	THE WITNESS: Yeah. I have not submitted
13	an article for peer review to a journal for
14	publication on the matters that I'm going to
15	testify about in court.
16	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. You've submitted other
17	articles to peer review journals, correct, on other
18	topics, have you not?
19	A Yes; that's correct.
20	Q But you've never, you've never even
21	attempted to write an article on public awareness of
22	the health hazards of smoking consistent with the
23	opinions that you're going to take in front of the
24	jury and submit such an article to a peer review
25	journal, correct?
43
1	A To this time, I've not chosen to do that.
2	Yes.
3	Q Are you going -- are you planning on doing
4	it?
5	A I don't have any plans at this point.
6	Q There are peer review articles on common
7	knowledge of health hazards of smoking that you've
8	read and you're familiar with, correct?
9	A I don't know that -- I mean, I don't know
10	that I have seen articles certainly written by
11	historians on common knowledge of smoking that, that
12	I'm familiar with, although I have reviewed a number
13	of materials which might loosely fit in that
14	category.
15	Q Okay. Prior to being retained by the
16	tobacco companies, is it fair to say you never
17	published anything on the issue of tobacco or
18	cigarettes?
19	A Well, I published prior to being contacted
20	on tobacco and cigarettes as an economic phenomenon.
21	But in terms of directly addressing the health risks,
22	that was a type of historical research that I was --
23	had not previously done.
24	Q And what you're talking about, the economic
25	phenomenon of tobacco in southern America, you had
44
1	written a textbook, correct?
2	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
3	Q (By Mr. Paige) There is a textbook you wrote.
Page 37
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	And within that textbook that topic was covered by you.
5	Is that correct, or no?
6	A No. It's not a textbook. But I've written
7	larger books and articles, which some portion of
8	which may deal with that.
9	Q Well, how many, how many did you write
10	before you were retained by tobacco that dealt with
11	tobacco?
12	A I had written one scholarly monograph that
13	had a few paragraphs on tobacco and I had written a
14	book review that dealt with tobacco and probably one
15	article that had some reference to tobacco as an
16	economic phenomenon.
17	Q Okay. So the monograph that you published,
18	the scholarly monograph, how many pages was it?
19	A A page -- the total length of the book
20	or --
21	Q Yeah.
22	A The text was about 380 pages.
23	Q And was it those 380 pages you had a
24	reference to tobacco which encompassed about two
25	paragraphs?
45
1	A Yeah. Page, page and a half, something
2	like that.
3	Q And that had nothing to do with public
4	awareness of the health hazards of smoking, though?
5	A That's correct.
6	Q And you're talking about a book -- and then
7	this book review you're talking about, when was that?
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	when was that and what was that about?
9	A I reviewed a book that was a community
10	study of two counties in North Carolina which became
11	important tobacco growing and producing counties and
12	I certainly commented on that phenomenon in my book
13	review.
14	Q How long was the book that you reviewed?
15	A Oh, I don't recall off the top of my head.
16	250 to 300 pages, roughly.
17	Q And how -- and that book was about tobacco
18	growing in the southern states?
19	A No. it was -- it focused on a two-county
20	area in North Carolina, one of which was what became
21	Durham County and was in the center of the post Civil
22	War tobacco boom in that portion of North Carolina.
23	And, you know, that played a significant role in the
24	book and I did comment on it in my book review.
25	Q When did you write your book review?
46
1	A I don't have my B-day in front of me. It
2	was -- would have been in the late '80s or early
3	'90s; 1980s and nineteen --
4	Q And who did you say -- but I don't
5	understand. Like your book review, was it published?
6	Your book review was published, or who did you send
7	your book review to?
8	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
9	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just
10	so you -- scholarly journals receive books for
11	review and they select reviewers. I was asked
12	to review this particular book. I accepted that
Page 39
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	and wrote a, and wrote a review for it. I
14	believe it was for a publication called Reviews
15	in American History. And that's how that
16	process works.
17	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. That's not a book that
18	you wrote. You read the book, correct?
19	A That's right.
20	Q Okay. So when I'm asking you about things
21	that you published, you certainly didn't publish that
22	book; you were just asked to read it?
23	A Well, I published a review of it is what
24	I'm trying to say.
25	Q Okay. But you would agree -- okay. As a
47
1	historian, it's important that you read as much as
2	possible regarding the issues that you're purportedly
3	an expert on?
4	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
5	THE WITNESS: It's certainly important to
6	do the research you need to do to reach your
7	opinions. Yes.
8	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. As a historian, you
9	read a lot?
10	A Reading, reading the work of other scholars
11	and, and -- is important and it's also important that
12	you do your own research. And I believe at least
13	that my work is very empirically based, which means
14	it's deeply based in primary research, but it's also
15	informed by reading the work of other historians as
16	wel1.
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	Q Why is it important as a historian that you
18	read the work of other scholars?
19	A Well, one of the things we do is try to --
20	historians do in the process of doing research and
21	getting published is try to address their opinions or
22	their conclusions to a larger audience of historians.
23	And it's certainly useful to know what other people
24	in that audience of historians are, are thinking
25	themselves about the subjects that you work on.
48
1	There are also occasions in which you rely on a book
2	that someone else has written for the -- simply for
3	the information it provides rather than for the
4	interpretation that it advances.
5	Q Did you -- the -- well, how -- strike that.
6	How do you decide which work of other
7	scholarly scholars are important to read? How do you
8	make that decision?
9	A As a general rule, you decide, you know,
10	what, what subject you're researching and look for
11	other material that is related to your area of
12	research. And then you try to find the work of, of
13	people you believe to be the best historians
14	published by the best presses or in the best journals
15	and you try to make yourself aware of that and work
16	through that in, in a timely fashion.
17	Q Did you do that for your opinions in this
18	case, or did you not do that?
19	A Yes. I, I did do that for my opinions in
20	this case.
21	Q The -- let me just go back to your book
Page 41
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	review. Just so I'm clear: The -- do you know the
23	name of the book that you reviewed?
24	A I don't recall it off the top of my head.
25	The title of my review was The Ties that Bind, I
49
1	think.
2	Q Okay. But it was, it was a book that was
3	not about common knowledge of the health hazards of
4	smoking?
5	A That's correct.
6	Q it had a portion in the book about the
7	financial impact on Durham, North Carolina from
8	tobacco?
9	A That would be a rough characterization of
10	it. Yes.
11	Q And then the last publication that you've
12	mentioned that you wrote was you said you wrote a --
13	published one article, what article was that?
14	A I published an article on -- or co-authored
15	an article on the economic performance and output of
16	South Carolina economy from the Colonial period down
17	to about 1980. And there were references to the
18	economic impact of tobacco at a couple of points in
19	that article.
20	Q And how long was the article?
21	A 20-some pages.
22	Q And how long was the reference to tobacco
23	within that article?
24	A A few sentences.
25	Q And where was that published?
50
1	A it was published in a volume of essays.
2	And I forget the publisher at this point. It was
3	early in my career.
4	Q Was it accepted by a peer-reviewed journal?
5	A Yes. it was a peer-reviewed volume.
6	Q Have you taught any courses at the
7	university where the issues are related to the health
8	hazards of smoking?
9	A Again, as I think I may have told you
10	previously, not taught any courses where that's the
11	primary focus of the course. It certainly is
12	something that may -- that has -- that comes up in,
13	in a lecture here and there, whether you're talking
14	about the Colonial period and the introduction of
15	tobacco as cash crop or the more modern period where
16	the health risks of smoking had become an issue.
17	There are things that I treat within the larger
18	context.
19	Q Prior to being retained -- prior to be
20	solicited by the tobacco companies, did you ever
21	teach a course related to the health hazards of
22	smoking?
23	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
24	THE WITNESS: I taught courses in which
25	that was a part, but never a course in which
51
1	that was the primary focus.
2	Q (By Mr. Paige) well, had you done research
3	about that before being retained by the tobacco
Page 43
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	companies?
5	A Well, I certainly had not done any focused
6	research on it. I was relying at that point on a
7	larger body of general historical knowledge.
8	Q what is, what is the course title that you
9	teach?
10	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
11	THE WITNESS: Well, I teach a number of
12	different courses.
13	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. What are they?
14	A Well, currently, I, I have taught over
15	the -- I guess over the course of my career both
16	halves of the American history survey class. I have
17	taught the second half of the history of South
18	Carolina, which is an upper-level undergraduate
19	course. I've taught courses on the old south or the
20	pre Civil War south and the post Civil War south.
21	I've taught a number of graduate courses on 19th and
22	20th century United States.
23	Q What are you, what are you most well-known
24	for in terms of your profession in terms of a
25	professor who publishes and speaks and teaches on --
52
1	on what topic?
2	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
3	THE WITNESS: On the pol -- I think that
4	what I'm best known for is my writings on the
5	politics and the economy of the 19th and 20th
6	century American south.
7	Q (By Mr. Paige) And in terms of your being
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	known for being an expert on the common knowledge or
9	the awareness of the health hazards of smoking, that's
10	not something that you're recognized as an expert on
11	based upon publications, grants given, research --
12	well, not research, but publication, grants or teaching
13	outside of the litigation arena, is that a fair
14	statement?
15	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
16	THE WITNESS: Yes. I think I'm
17	recognized -- have been recognized as an expert
18	in a variety of jurisdictions in litigation. I
19	have not attempted to publish in this area
20	outside of the work that I do in litigation.
21	Q (By Mr. Paige) Have you ever submitted a
22	grant proposal or received a grant from the National
23	Cancer Institute?
24	A No, I have not.
25	Q Have you ever submitted a grant proposal or
53
1	received a grant from any organization relating to
2	the issues of health hazards of smoking?
3	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
4	THE WITNESS: No. I have not submitted any
5	such proposal.
6	Q (By Mr. Paige) Have you ever been sought out
7	as a -- strike that.
8	You're familiar with the Surgeon General
9	reports?
10	A Yes. in a general sense, yes.
11	Q You have reviewed the '64, the '79, the
12	'88, '89 Surgeon General reports, as I recall; is
Page 45
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	that correct?
14	A Yes; that's correct.
15	Q And the Surgeon General of the United
16	States has sought out the opinions of several
17	historians to assist in their research and writings
18	of those reports; is that correct?
19	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
20	THE WITNESS: I don't know that I'm
21	familiar with that. That may or may not be
22	true. I just don't know.
23	Q (By Mr. Paige) Well, you've never been
24	consulted by the Surgeon General on any reports of the
25	Surgeon General on public awareness of health hazards,
54
1	have you?
2	A That's correct.
3	Q Have you ever been asked to give testimony
4	regarding the health hazards of smoking to the United
5	States Senate or House of Representatives or any
6	governmental agency?
7	A No, I have not.
8	Q I think we discussed this last time, in
9	your reliance list you have some national
10	publications -- Reader's Digest, New York Times, et
11	cetera -- because you feel that this was a national
12	story, a national issue; is that correct?
13	A Yes. it was, it was a national as well as
14	a local story. Yes.
15	Q Okay. And you included the Miami papers
16	because Mr. Sher -- Mr. Cohen lived in Miami,
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	correct?
18	A Well, yes. it made -- that would -- it
19	made it especially important because he lived in
20	Miami and there was testimony that -- in the
21	depositions that he was a regular reader of The
22	Mi ami Heraid.
23	Q if he wasn't a regular reader of The
24	Mi ami Herald, would you have -- strike that.
25	You have other cases where you include the
55
1	local paper even though the person is not a regular
2	reader of that paper for some reason; is that
3	correct?
4	A Yes. That would be correct.
5	Q Okay. And why would it be important to
6	include -- for example, you have the Hollywood
7	Sun-Tattler, which is close to Miami. Why is that
8	important to have the Hollywood Sun-Tattler as
9	something to rely upon in the Cohen case?
10	A Well, I think in any case, but certainly in
11	the Cohen case as well, the, the information --
12	environment that any individual lived in involves not
13	only things that they may have read but that people
14	they knew and conversed with and who lived in their
15	community may have been exposed to and would shape
16	the opinions of other people in that community
17	because personal conversation, word of mouth,
18	interaction with co-workers, that kind of thing is a
19	large component for building of public awareness on
20	any given subject. And I think that's certainly true
21	here as well. So you would include a range of
Page 47
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	materials, not just ones that any given smoker may
23	have seen because you're trying to see what
24	information was available in the larger community and
25	not just for that one individual.
56
1	Q Well, for example, did the New York Times
2	have a wire service to The Mi ami Herald; do you know?
3	A You know, I don't recall that off the top
4	of my head, although the, the New York Times was a
5	newspaper that was read in south Florida in the
6	second half of the 20th century. Not as commonly as
7	The Mi ami Herald certainly, but --
8	Q But you want to -- because Nate Cohen lived
9	in Miami, you want to include newspapers that were
10	read in the -- at least in the Miami area, correct?
11	A That's correct.
12	Q And you don't want to exclude any major
13	newspapers that were published and read in the Miami
14	area, correct?
15	A To the extent possible that I have reviewed
16	the major newspapers, yes, that would be the case.
17	Q What were the major newspapers in the
18	Miami -- in Miami in the 1950s and '60s?
19	A Well, I think The MiamiHerald was the major
20	newspaper in that time.
21	Q And what else?
22	A Well, let's see. There was the Fort
23	Lauderdale newspaper. I think it became more
24	important later on. There were -- like you say, I've
25	included some Hollywood Sun-Tattier for this case.
57
1	There may have been others that I'm not recalling
2	right now, but --
3	Q Okay. Were there any that you excluded
4	from your list for some reason or another?
5	A No. Not that I -- not for any particular
6	reason that I recall.
7	Q Okay. And as an expert historian trying to
8	determine the information available to Mr. Cohen, you
9	certainly should be an expert enough to know what
10	were the major newspapers in Miami, would you agree
11	with that?
12	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
13	THE WITNESS: Well, at var -- I think at
14	various times during my research I took
15	considerable pains to find out what the major
16	newspapers were. And I think in reviewing
17	deposition material for this case it was clear
18	that the most important one with regard to the
19	Cohen family and Mr. Cohen personally was The
20	Mi ami Heraid.
21	Q (By Mr. Paige) Well, you include The
22	Mi ami Herald, you include The Mi ami Herald in the Sherman
23	case and he didn't even live in Miami, correct?
24	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
25	THE WITNESS: Well, I did include it in the
58
1	Sherman case. And he certainly lived in the --
2	Mr. Sherman lived in the greater Miami area.
3	Excuse me.
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	Q (By Mr. Paige) Right.
5	A And --
6	Q And you --
7	A -- and, as I said earlier, I think in
8	addition to materials that may -- I have reason to
9	believe that were part of the plaintiff specific or
10	the smoker's specific information environment, the,
11	the larger knowledge of the community comes into the
12	question of public awareness as well. And The
13	Mi ami Heraid would, I think, always be an important
14	source of what information was circulating in south
15	Florida. And I include typically other Florida
16	newspapers as well. Not necessarily all Florida
17	newspapers, but other Florida newspapers as well.
18	Q What was -- what were the two main
19	newspapers published in Miami in the '50s and '60s
20	and '70s?
21	A My recollection is The Mi ami Herald. I
22	don't remember off the top of my head what a second
23	one might have been. Although in my research into
24	the Miami area, I looked at, I think, all newspapers
25	published in that area to some extent, including even
59
1	the Spanish-speaking newspaper, which I'm probably
2	not using in this case because it was not a
3	Spanish-speaking --
4	Q I just want to know: In Broward County you
5	have the Fort Lauderdale Daily News and the Hollywood
6	Sun-Tattler. in Miami you have The Mi ami Herald. Do
7	you know the second large -- do you know the two
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	largest Miami newspaper publications from the '50s
9	and '60s?
10	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
11	Q (By Mr. Paige) And if you don't, just tell
12	me.
13	A Off the top of my head I don't remember,
14	other than The Mi ami Herald.
15	Q Would there be a reason for you to exclude
16	one of the top two major newspaper publications in
17	Miami for Nathan Cohen's case?
18	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
19	THE WITNESS: No, there would not.
20	Q (By Mr. Paige) And as a historian, you would
21	not exclude or be expected to exclude important
22	information from your opinions, would you?
23	A No. But I think there, there comes a point
24	where you think you have an adequate and even
25	superabundant foundation for what you're going to
60
1	say. And I think, you know, to some extent there was
2	such coverage in this -- for this particular case
3	there was such coverage of these matters in The
4	Mi ami Herald and such strong indication from the
5	depositions that that was the newspaper for the, for
6	the Cohen household that I think focusing on that is
7	something that historians would ordinarily do and,
8	and I have done to some extent in this case.
9	Q So that's the reason that you included the
10	Pensacola newspapers, Jacksonville newspapers, couple
11	cases from the Tampa area, a couple cases from the
12	Broward County area, and you decide to include only
Page 51
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	one paper from the Miami area? That's the reason why
14	you did that?
15	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
16	Q (By Mr. Paige) Or was the reason that you
17	really don't know the second paper?
18	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
19	THE WITNESS: And as I said, I can't
20	remember a second paper today. And when I was
21	researching south Florida generally I tried to
22	get a sense of the papers, and I haven't
23	reviewed that for today. But I think The
24	Mi ami Herald is itself both the largest paper in
25	the area and the one that was pinpointed in the
61
1	depositions by people who knew Mr. Cohen.
2	Q (By Mr. Paige) Do you think that was the
3	largest paper in Miami in the '50s?
4	A I'm hesitant to answer that without -- off
5	the top of my head, but it was certainly a large and
6	widely circulated newspaper in Miami in that period
7	of time.
8	Q Okay. I just want to know: Was it the
9	largest newspaper in Miami in the '50s? Either yes,
10	no or you don't know.
11	MR. walker: Objection to form. Asked and
12	answered.
13	THE WITNESS: Off the top of my head today,
14	I don't know.
15	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. And did The Mi ami Herald
16	have a wire service with the New York Times?
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
18	THE WITNESS: I don't remember whether they
19	did or not. Some newspapers did and didn't.
20	There were variety of wire services. The New
21	York Times was not the most commonly used by
22	newspapers. And I would have to go back and
23	review my materials to answer that more fully.
24	Q (By Mr. Paige) Why did you -- you did not
25	include advertisements on your reliance list; is that
62
1	correct?
2	A Yes. I think that's correct.
3	Q You previously told me, though, you believe
4	that the advertisements help shape public opinions
5	and beliefs. Do you remember telling me that?
6	A Well, I think that except in --
7	Q I'm not -- sir, sir, I'm just asking you:
8	Do you remember telling me that? That's my question.
9	A I don't remember that exact language. No.
10	Q Okay. Do you agree that advertisements
11	from tobacco companies helped shape public opinions
12	and beliefs in the '50s and '60s?
13	A I, I bas -- I have basically not seen any
14	evidence that they shape public attitudes and
15	opinions about the health risks of smoking. They may
16	well have played a role in brand selection among
17	smokers or in some other way. But one of the, one of
18	the reasons for not including advertisements on my
19	reliance list would be that it was only an incidental
20	and kind of tertiary ways, in my opinion, that
21	advertisements played any role in shaping the public
Page 53
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	awareness and the health hazards of smoking, and
23	that's what my reliance list is focused on. So even
24	though I reviewed advertisements -- just let me
25	finish quickly. I reviewed advertisements because
63
1	they certainly were things that came to the public,
2	the public had access to and saw them, but I've seen
3	no evidence that they shaped public opinions on the
4	issue of the health hazards of smoking.
5	Q Okay. You're not an advertising expert,
6	correct?
7	A That's -- I'm not an expert on designing an
8	advertising campaign or the -- structuring the
9	content of advertising. I did review advertising in
10	terms of its impact on the public awareness issue.
11	Q You've never published one article in your
12	life on public awareness -- forget about cigarettes.
13	But on any, any issue in general, you've never held
14	yourself out to be an expert on public awareness,
15	have you?
16	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
17	THE WITNESS: Well, I've held myself out to
18	be an expert historian and I think one of the --
19	I think the question of what the public knew and
20	when the public knew it is fundamentally a
21	historical question and is what historians do
22	and what information is available publicly on
23	some variety of subjects. And I think in most
24	things that I do write, even if they're not
25	relating to the health risks of smoking, that
64
1	the concept of, of public opinion, of public
2	awareness, information that's broadly known and
3	shaped in people's knowledge environment is, is
4	something that I do study as a historian.
5	Q (By Mr. Paige) What have you published on
6	public awareness in general?
7	A Well, again, I think I'm trying to say that
8	much of the work that historians do while not
9	labeled --
10	Q No, no, no. Sir, sir, my question is:
11	what have you published on public awareness in
12	general?
13	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
14	THE WITNESS: Well, I'm trying, I'm trying
15	to say that --
16	Q (By Mr. Paige) Why don't you answer my
17	question first and tell me what you published in public
18	awareness?
19	A I haven't published anything that has
20	public awareness in the title. However, much of the
21	work that I do as a historian has to do with
22	understanding what information was available to
23	people and what -- how that shaped their knowledge
24	environment in any given period of time. That is
25	fundamentally what historians do. I don't know that
65
1	labeling it public awareness is something that
2	historians commonly do. But the substance of coming
3	to understand public awareness is the essence of much
Page 55
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	that historians do.
5	Q Sir, maybe if you don't understand my
6	question, tell me you don't understand. Because next
7	time you don't answer my question, I'm going to call
8	the judge. Do you know that there are experts --
9	MR. WALKER: Gary, I don't think it's
10	appropriate, I don't think it's appropriate for
11	you to make that kind of a threat to a deponent.
12	MR. PAIGE: Well, I do, I do. Okay. I'm
13	not threatening. I'm not threatening, so --
14	that's what I'm telling him.
15	Q (By Mr. Paige) Do you know that there are
16	experts in the field of public awareness or marketing
17	or consumer psychology who actually have researched and
18	published on the topic of public awareness? Do you
19	know that there is such a thing that exists?
20	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
21	THE WITNESS: I'm aware that there are
22	fields of expertise in social psychology and
23	marketing. I'm not aware of people who present
24	themselves as experts in public awareness.
25	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. What are the -- what is
66
1	the area in social psychology and marketing that you're
2	aware of?
3	A I'm not an expert in either of those
4	fields.
5	Q Okay. So do you know that people who are
6	experts in the field of social psychology and
7	marketing actually publish on consumer awareness,
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	consumer beliefs?
9	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
10	Q (By Mr. Paige) Do you know that? Have you
11	read any of those articles?
12	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
13	THE WITNESS: I'm not an expert in those
14	fields and that's -- since that's outside my
15	area of expertise, it's not anything I've
16	undertaken to study systematically.
17	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. Have you published --
18	I'm not asking about the title. But have you published
19	an article that generally talks about -- the article is
20	about public beliefs and consumer awareness?
21	A I would draw a distinction between those
22	two. I think that --
23	Q Okay. Let me separate the question, then.
24	I'm going to separate it. Have you written a article
25	that generally -- in general is written on the topic
67
1	of public awareness? And just tell me the titles of
2	the articles. You don't have to explain anything.
3	Just tell me the title of the articles.
4	A Again, I'm saying I think that most of what
5	I have written as a historian deals with the question
6	of public awareness of information. Consumer
7	awareness is -- I would say I have not attempted to
8	publish anything about consumer awareness.
9	Q Okay. So you haven't published anything on
10	consumer awareness or consumer beliefs, correct?
11	A I would say that's correct. Yes.
12	Q But you have published on public awareness
Page 57
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	in general. So tell me which of the articles -- just
14	give me three of them that I can go to to look at
15	your writings.
16	A Well --
17	Q Just tell me three of them.
18	A I think both of my, both of my published
19	books deal with what the public knew about certain
20	subjects at a specific historical period of time.
21	And that is the essence of, in some cases, of what
22	being a historian is. it's not about the subject
23	matter of this particular case, it is a matter about
24	what the public knew, what information the public
25	had.
68
1	Q You were saying before that advertisement
2	helps shape public opinion and beliefs in brand
3	selection and other ways. Tell me the other ways
4	that you were talking about.
5	A Well, I said they may have. I don't --
6	haven't undertaken attempt to -- I'm not an
7	advertising expert and I haven't undertaken to study
8	advertisements, except as they relate to the issue of
9	public awareness of the health hazards of smoking.
10	Q Okay. So the other ways that the
11	advertisements may have shaped public opinion may
12	have been health issues, but you're not an expert in
13	that field. Is that what you're saying?
14	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
15	Q (By Mr. Paige) Or you're saying they did not
16	help shape public opinions in health hazards
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	whatsoever, even though you claim not to be an expert?
18	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
19	THE WITNESS: what I'm trying to say is
20	that I tried to evaluate everything that came
21	into the public domain about the health hazards
22	of smoking. Advertisements were certainly
23	something that came into, came into the public
24	domain. I don't think that the advertisements
25	did not, in my view, have an impact on the
69
1	public's awareness of the health hazards of
2	smoking except perhaps in a very small a way.
3	Q (By Mr. Paige) what about in the, what about
4	in the public beliefs about the health hazards of
5	smoking? Well, strike that.
6	We spoke about this before. You draw a
7	distinction between awareness and belief, correct?
8	A Yes, I do.
9	Q And you draw a distinction between what
10	somebody may have heard and what somebody believes,
11	correct?
12	A Well, I draw a distinction between the
13	information they have and what decision they make
14	about that information and the deci -- belief is a
15	personal decision, so it's not just a function of
16	information.
17	Q Sir, you've answered this question for me
18	before. If you can't answer it, just tell me you
19	can't answer it with a yes or no. Do you draw a
20	distinction between what the public may have heard
21	and what the public believes?
Page 59
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	MR. WALKER: Object to the form.
23	Q (By Mr. Paige) Do you agree they're two
24	different things?
25	MR. WALKER: Asked and answered.
70
1	THE WITNESS: I agree that public awareness
2	and belief are different.
3	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. And awareness is what
4	people hear about, correct?
5	A Well, it's not -- it's more than that.
6	Q Okay, well, do you draw a distinction
7	between what people hear and what people believe?
8	For example, you know in the polls that you're
9	relying upon there is some questions that talk about
10	hearing something and believing something. Right?
11	You've seen that, haven't you?
12	A I do understand that there is a distinction
13	between hearing and believing.
14	Q Okay. That's all I asked you. Simple
15	question, in fact, we talked about it before, it
16	took you a very short time to answer that same
17	question so --
18	MR. WALKER: Move on to your next question
19	please, Gary. Just move on.
20	Q (By Mr. Paige) We don't have to argue over
21	every question.
22	MR. WALKER: Move to the next question.
23	Q (By Mr. Paige) The -- did advertisements, in
24	your opinion -- I understand you're saying it didn't
25	help shape public awareness, but did advertisements
71
1	help shape public beliefs --
2	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
3	Q (By Mr. Paige) -- about health hazards of
4	smoking?
5	A Based on the evidence that I've seen, I
6	don't believe that advertisements shaped public
7	beliefs about the health hazards of smoking.
8	Advertisements were --
9	Q And how --
10	A Sorry. Go ahead.
11	Q No. How did you determine that?
12	A The content of most advertisements did not
13	deal with health in any way whatsoever. There is
14	plenty of evidence that advertisements were held in
15	low regard by the public and the public was skeptical
16	of them. And the -- even though advertisements
17	continued, levels of awareness which were high
18	remained and belief levels rose over time. And some
19	of the advertisements may have even served to
20	heighten public awareness of the health hazards of
21	smoking or at least there was some publications at
22	the time during the 1950s which, which made that,
23	that case.
24	So as -- I don't see that there is any --
25	advertisements were certainly something that the
72
1	public was aware of, but I think that they drew their
2	information about the health risks of smoking not
3	from advertisements but from the American Cancer
Page 61
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	Society, the Surgeon General and others.
5	Q Interesting. The -- you're familiar with
6	advertisements that -- from your -- from R.J.
7	Reynolds that had doctors smoking, correct? You've
8	seen that?
9	A Yes.
10	Q Have you seen that?
11	A Yes; that's correct.
12	Q And that advertisement was a extensive
13	campaign for R.J. Reynolds, was it not?
14	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
15	THE WITNESS: I can't answer the part about
16	that it was an expensive campaign, but I have
17	seen ads featuring doctors for R.J. Reynolds
18	products.
19	Q (By Mr. Paige) well, it was an extensive
20	campaign, was it not?
21	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
22	THE WITNESS: It was a campaign that ran
23	for several years in the late 1940s and early
24	1950s, as I recall.
25	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. On TV and radio? I
73
1	mean, on TV and print, correct? And radio.
2	A I'm certainly aware that it ran in print
3	during that period of time. I don't know how long.
4	I know it ran on television. I don't know how long
5	it ran.
6	Q Okay. And it's your opinion that R.J.
7	Reynolds continued with this extensive campaign with
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	doctors smoking even though it didn't work?
9	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: I can't answer that question.
11	I don't know what you mean by work. I wouldn't
12	have a way of -- I don't know what the intent of
13	the advertising campaign was. what I can say
14	about the campaign was that I have seen no
15	evidence that it shaped the public awareness of
16	the health hazards of smoking.
17	Q (By Mr. Paige) Well, what do you think the
18	intent of the advertisement showing doctors and nurses
19	smoking would be?
20	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
21	Q (By Mr. Paige) As an expert, do you have any
22	idea what that might be?
23	A Well, as I said, I'm not an advertising
24	expert. The use of, of socially prominent people was
25	something that advertising of all types did at the
74
1	time. Doctors are generally well respected. But I
2	don't know anything about the advertising campaign
3	except that I have seen the ads that ran.
4	Q There were advertisements with athletes
5	saying that smoking didn't get their wind, correct?
6	A There were certainly advertisements for
7	cigarettes that featured athletes. I don't remember
8	that particular content, but I'm not prepared to say
9	that -- without reviewing them, that it wasn't there.
10	But certainly athletes were used and celebrity
11	endorsements for cigarettes as for other products.
12	Q And do you understand that we're here
Page 63
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	talking about cigarettes and not other products
14	today? Do you know that?
15	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
16	THE WITNESS: Yes, I am. But other
17	products were advertised and --
18	Q (By Mr. Paige) Well, two wrongs don't make a
19	right, does it?
20	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
21	Q (By Mr. Paige) You think that's proper, just
22	because somebody else does something you should do it
23	too?
24	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
25	THE WITNESS: No. I'm not arguing that at
75
1	all. I'm trying to -- as I would do with any
2	piece of historical evidence, put it in a larger
3	context.
4	Q (By Mr. Paige) Well, what other hazardous
5	product where the manufacturer knew that their product
6	could kill people and didn't tell the public about it?
7	Tell me another manufacturer that used doctors and
8	athletes to market their product other than cigarettes.
9	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of -- I
11	don't -- I can't answer that question. I don't
12	know what any companies knew about their
13	product, including the cigarette companies,
14	other than things that came into the public
15	domain.
16	Q (By Mr. Paige) Well, you know that they, they
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	first admitted that cigarettes cause lung cancer after
18	the year 2000, correct?
19	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
20	THE WITNESS: I -- it was in the late 1990s
21	or early 2000s. Yes.
22	Q (By Mr. Paige) And the same with nicotine
23	being addictive, correct?
24	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
25	THE WITNESS: I understand that company
76
1	executives had not made that statement until the
2	past decade or so. Yes.
3	Q (By Mr. Paige) And, in fact, they made the
4	opposite statement for decades, in the '50s, the '60s,
5	'70s, '80s and into the '90s the tobacco companies made
6	public statements in press and on TV that their product
7	was not addictive and that their product did not cause
8	lung cancer, correct?
9	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: No. That's not correct.
11	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. You haven't seen
12	statements from public officials from the tobacco
13	companies in the 1990s, as late as 1994, saying that
14	nicotine is not addictive?
15	A I have seen statements like that. Yes.
16	Q Okay. Have you seen statements in the, in
17	the '60s and '70s and '80s saying that they were
18	not -- that they did not know if cigarettes caused
19	lung cancer?
20	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
21	THE WITNESS: Yes. I have seen statements.
Page 65
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	And it's difficult to, to describe the number of
23	statements with -- in a single phrase, but --
24	which the statements I have seen from -- and
25	made in public by tobacco company
77
1	representatives is that they did not believe
2	that lung cancer had been proven as a cause -- I
3	mean cigarettes had been proven as a cause of
4	lung cancer. That was -- and that more research
5	was needed and that some specific sort of
6	causative clinical cause needed to be found that
7	statistics didn't prove the risk. Those were
8	the general types of statements that I saw.
9	Q (By Mr. Paige) And that, and that they were
10	doing research and if they ever determined an
11	ingredient that was hazardous it would be removed,
12	correct?
13	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
14	THE WITNESS: I have seen a statement to
15	that effect, that there would be the efforts to
16	remove hazardous ingredients.
17	Q (By Mr. Paige) No. Not that they were making
18	efforts, but that if they found any dangerous
19	ingredient they would make such an effort, correct?
20	A I can recall seeing at least one statement
21	to that effect. Yes.
22	Q Which statement is that?
23	A it was a statement made by a representative
24	of a trade organization in the aftermath of the
25	Surgeon General's report. Might have been
78
1	Mr. Cool man. I don't remember his name right off the
2	top of my head.
3	Q Okay. And that was a trade organization
4	that R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris both belonged
5	to, correct?
6	A To the best of my knowledge, yes.
7	MR. PAIGE: Can we take another quick
8	break, John?
9	MR. WALKER: Sure. This is a good time.
10	(whereupon, a brief recess was taken.)
11	Q (By Mr. Paige) who is the, who is the -- who
12	are the best historians or the leading historians on
13	cigarette and public beliefs?
14	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
15	THE WITNESS: I guess that I would say to
16	that that, that I've certainly done as much
17	research on this as anyone I know. And I,
18	frankly, trust my own research and conclusions
19	on this more than any other historian I know. I
20	don't mean to be immodest about it, but I'm
21	relying on my own work here and I've done a lot
22	of it over a good many years now.
23	Q (By Mr. Paige) But you were telling me before
24	that historians will do readings of other leading
25	historians in other leading journals. And although you
79
1	don't have to accept their conclusions, you could
2	reject them, but it's a good basis for hearing both
3	sides of the story and getting adequate information.
Page 67
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	You remember we spoke about that before?
5	A Yes.
6	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
7	Q (By Mr. Paige) And do you now disagree with
8	that statement?
9	A No.
10	Q Okay. So who are the, the -- now,
11	obviously, in this arena the issue of public belief
12	of the health hazards of smoking, there is two sides.
13	You know that by now, correct?
14	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
15	THE WITNESS: Well, I know that it -- yes,
16	the subject of adversarial litigation. Yes.
17	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. And not only
18	litigation. There is two sides in the public domain.
19	There is books written, articles written, it's not
20	just in the litigation arena, correct?
21	A Well, there has been material written.
22	It's not terribly voluminous by comparison with other
23	subjects, I would suggest, but, you know, there is
24	material written.
25	Q The fact that you do expert work for the
80
1	tobacco companies is not a secret, it's something
2	that people you work with know, your family knows,
3	your friends know, correct?
4	A That's correct; yes.
5	Q Have you -- so who are the best or leading
6	historians in this area other than yourself?
7	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	THE WITNESS: Again, that's a difficult
9	evaluation for me to make. This is not -- it's
10	not an area in which there is a great deal of
11	publication and I'm -- I have not, as I
12	testified earlier, really discussed testimony
13	with either -- any of the other historians that,
14	that, that I know that work in these cases. I
15	know that in a broad general sense other than
16	this subject I respect the work of Professor
17	Robert Jane Norrell a lot. There is a book by
18	Professor James Patterson on cancer generally
19	which has a chapter on smoking and cancer that I
20	have a high regard for.
21	I think if I were to say -- don't agree
22	with all of it, but I think if I were to
23	recommend one, one chapter of any book, it would
24	be Patterson's Dread Disease to people to read
25	for an introduction to the subject. I think
81
1	that's kind of what it is is an introduction to
2	the subject. But he's a respected historian.
3	That was a wel1-received book. And I think it's
4	either Oxford University Press or Harvard
5	University Press that published it.
6	Q (By Mr. Paige) Has he been an expert for the
7	tobacco companies, as far as you know?
8	A Not to my knowledge, but --
9	Q And what about Norrell?
10	A Yes. He is -- has been an expert. Yes.
11	Mentioned him earlier.
12	Q Now, who are some of the other -- do you
Page 69
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	know of any -- like, for example, who is Lewis
14	Caricudas? would you consider him a leading
15	historian on this subject matter?
16	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
17	THE WITNESS: I know Lewis Caricudas and
18	I've not been impressed with the research he's
19	done in this area, but he has been active, as
20	you may know, as an expert for plaintiffs; quite
21	active, actually, in recent years as an expert
22	for plaintiffs.
23	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. But you wouldn't
24	consider him a leading source on the history of public
25	beliefs or cigarettes?
82
1	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
2	THE WITNESS: Based on what I've seen of
3	his work, I would not.
4	Q (By Mr. Paige) How about Allan Brant?
5	A I'm familiar with Professor Brant and his
6	work. Yes.
7	Q Would you consider him to be a leading
8	source on the history of cigarettes?
9	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: Yes. I think he is a
11	respected historian who has done a lot of work
12	on the history of the cigarette and the history
13	of cigarettes and health. And, again, I think I
14	disagree with some of his conclusions, but I do
15	respect his work.
16	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. And would you also
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	consider Stan Glantz to be a leading source on the
18	history of cigarettes?
19	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
20	THE WITNESS: I'm familiar with Stan
21	Glantz. To my knowledge, he's not a historian.
22	Excuse me.
23	And I think Professor Glantz is most
24	interested in public health dimension of smoking
25	and not the historical dimension. When he
83
1	speaks about historical matters, I tend to
2	disagree with him.
3	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. And -- okay. So the --
4	have you read the book Cigarette Century?
5	A I have read, I have read much of it. I've
6	not read it cover to cover, it's a long book and --
7	Q Well, who gave you that, who gave you that
8	book?
9	A Oh, I think I ordered it myself.
10	Q And for what reason did you order it? Just
11	as part of your scholarly work as a historian?
12	A Yes. And I think I saw Professor Brant on
13	Comedy Central of all places and decided to order the
14	book.
15	Q And what about Cigarette Papers? Did you
16	read that book?
17	A I believe I looked at that early in my
18	research. I haven't looked at it lately.
19	Q And what about Ashes to Ashes? Did you
20	read that book?
21	A Again, yes, I -- early, early in my
Page 71
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	research I did read that book. Yes.
23	Q And what about the book Tobacco: A Cultural
24	History of How an Exotic Plant Seduced Civilization?
25	Did you read that book?
84
1	A Yes, I did, as I recall.
2	Q And that was part of your research as well?
3	Was that part of your research?
4	A Again, at some earlier point, yes.
5	Q And were all these books purchased by you
6	on your own so you could read them, or did somebody
7	give them to you as a gift or as part of your
8	research?
9	A I think that in -- I mean, they were not
10	given to me by anybody. In some cases I may have
11	checked them out at the library; in other cases I
12	purchased them.
13	Q Now, the school textbooks that you have on
14	your reliance materials, do you know if Nathan Cohen
15	used any in the classrooms or schools that he
16	attended?
17	A I know that, that the, the books that are
18	on my reliance list provided the, the -- well, the
19	books that were approved for use in Florida and that
20	his school district -- excuse me. Or his schools in
21	Florida would have used some of those textbooks.
22	Yes.
23	Q I know. But you have a lot of textbooks on
24	your reliance materials. So rather than me read all
25	of them, can you cite me to the one or two textbooks
85
1	that you know or you really have a good-faith basis
2	for believing were used in the classrooms or schools
3	that Nathan Cohen attended?
4	A I don't know which of these Florida
5	approved textbooks were used in Nathan Cohen's
6	schools. I've not been able to find records which
7	indicate that.
8	Q Have you looked at any of the internal
9	tobacco documents -- have you reviewed any internal
10	tobacco documents?
11	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
12	THE WITNESS: No. I have not reviewed any
13	internal tobacco company documents unless they
14	have been shown to me as part of a question on
15	cross-examination at trial. Been a few of those
16	over the years. And when that happens, I
17	usually ask to look at it in its entirety. But
18	I only reviewed material that came into the
19	public domain at times material.
20	Q (By Mr. Paige) Are you familiar with the
21	content -- other than what's been shown to you by
22	plaintiff attorneys, are you familiar with the content
23	of the internal -- of any of the internal tobacco
24	documents such as R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, Hill &
25	Laughton, Tobacco institute, et cetera?
86
1	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
2	THE WITNESS: Well, some materials that may
3	have been generated by any company or the
Page 73
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	tobacco institute may have come into the public.
5	They may have been published at the time or
6	stories about them in the newspaper when I would
7	know about them from that. But I have not
8	examined internal company documents because they
9	did not come to the public at the time and,
10	therefore, did not shape public awareness.
11	Q (By Mr. Paige) So you -- other than what was
12	in the newspaper, you have not reviewed nor are you
13	familiar with any of the internal tobacco documents or
14	archives?
15	A Well, I wouldn't limit it to just
16	newspapers. But other than material that somehow
17	made it into the public at the time through some type
18	of publicity or publication effort, if they were
19	internal and remained internal, I have not reviewed
20	them for the very purpose the fact that they were not
21	made public.
22	Q So you're not aware of them?
23	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
24	THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of their
25	content. No.
87
1	Q (By Mr. Paige) And you've never asked to see
2	them, correct?
3	A That's correct. I've only focused on
4	material that came to the public and could shape
5	public awareness.
6	Q And it's your testimony under oath that you
7	have no interest in seeing them?
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
9	THE WITNESS: Well, I think it's my
10	testimony that the public awareness could only
11	be shaped by things the public had access to.
12	if they didn't have access to those documents,
13	they did not shape public awareness.
14	Q (By Mr. Paige) Do you have an interest in
15	seeing those tobacco-archived documents or not?
16	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
17	THE WITNESS: They're certainly not
18	something that I need to see to give testimony
19	on public awareness and the health hazards of
20	smoking.
21	Q (By Mr. Paige) But you've been doing this
22	work for fifteen years. These documents have been made
23	public. You hold yourself as an expert in this arena,
24	hold yourself out as an expert. Aren't you interested
25	in looking at them?
88
1	MR. walker: Objection to form. Asked and
2	answered.
3	Q (By Mr. Paige) I mean, you could discount
4	them and say they're not important, but don't you have
5	an interest in looking at them?
6	MR. walker: Objection to form. Asked and
7	answered.
8	THE WITNESS: Well, I think the fact -- let
9	me try to explain it this way. Public awareness
10	could only be shaped by information that the
11	public had. Since these were internal documents
12	and the public didn't have them in the 1950s or
Page 75
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	the 1960s or the 1970s, they did not shape
14	public awareness, which is what I need to make
15	my determination about.
16	The fact that they may have been published
17	since the year 2000 is one thing. It means they
18	are available now, but it didn't do anything to
19	shape public awareness in the historical period
20	that I'm interested in. Does that mean that I
21	would never look at them? Not necessarily. But
22	for the purpose of this testimony and the time
23	constraints that I operate under, focusing on
24	what the public knew, what information did come
25	to the public I think is an entirely appropriate
89
1	thing.
2	Q (By Mr. Paige) well, if you were interested
3	in looking at them, you certainly could look at them,
4	correct?
5	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
6	THE WITNESS: I don't know. One of the,
7	one of the issues that historians always have to
8	consider is how material is made available. And
9	I can't, as I sit here today, know exactly what
10	I could look at, how -- what, what I would know
11	about it if I did look at it, so -- but I know
12	that there --
13	Q (By Mr. Paige) Aside --
14	A I was trying to finish.
15	Q The types --
16	A Go ahead.
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	MR. WALKER: You can finish your answer if
18	you need to.
19	Q (By Mr. Paige) Go ahead.
20	A I was going to say, I know that there were
21	documents that were internal documents for a long
22	time that in the past few years have been made
23	available through the litigation process and
24	otherwise, but I've not undertaken to look at those
25	for the reasons I stated previously.
90
1	Q Okay, if you, if you wanted to see those
2	documents -- forget about being an expert. Just
3	being a human being, if you wanted to see those
4	documents, you could look at those documents,
5	correct?
6	MR. walker: Objection to form. Asked and
7	answered.
8	Q (By Mr. Paige) There is nothing preventing
9	you from doing that, is there?
10	A I know there -- I know that there are
11	previously internal documents that are available to
12	look at. And, no, nothing is stopping me from
13	looking at those, except the fact that I think
14	they're not relevant to my research at this point.
15	Q Okay. Okay. But other than your opinions,
16	you've made no effort to -- aside from being an
17	expert -- look, you've reviewed various books:
18	Cigarette Century, Cigarette Papers, Ashes to Ashes.
19	You're reviewing that because you're a historian and
20	you're reading information. Is there a reason why
21	you will not look at the archives? Did somebody
Page 77
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	instruct you, hey, professor, do not look at those
23	documents?
24	MR. WALKER: Objection.
25	THE WITNESS: Oh, no. Absolutely not.
91
1	MR. walker: Objection to form. Asked and
2	answered.
3	Q (By Mr. Paige) And if you want it, okay, the
4	documents are public. They are available to anybody,
5	correct?
6	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
7	THE WITNESS: I've not, I've not looked
8	into that. I don't know that they're open to
9	anybody. But I think they are public now, to
10	the best of my knowledge.
11	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. You didn't know that
12	they're on the internet? Nobody told you that?
13	A Well, I know, I know from, from my own work
14	that there are internet sites, what I don't know is
15	how exhaustive they are and a whole manner of other
16	questions, which would be pertinent for a historian
17	who was evaluating them. There is a difference --
18	just to answer your -- the fullness of your question,
19	there is a difference between reading secondary
20	literature or background literature, which you asked
21	me about recently in the previous question, and, and
22	the type of primary research you're doing. And
23	these, these internal documents would fall under the
24	category of primary research, which is one reason
25	that one casts a broader net in one area than one
92
1	might in the other.
2	Q Okay. The questions I've been asking you
3	are pretty -- I mean, we can be done with this in
4	three minutes. The documents are available for you
5	to see them if you really wanted to, correct?
6	MR. walker: Objection to form. Asked and
7	answered.
8	THE WITNESS: There are some --
9	Q (By Mr. Paige) Is that correct or incorrect?
10	A Excuse me?
11	Q Is that correct or incorrect?
12	A I don't know to what extent that is
13	correct. There are previously internal documents
14	that are available. That is correct.
15	Q Okay. And you've made no, you've made no
16	effort to look at them, correct?
17	MR. WALKER: Objection to form. Asked and
18	answered.
19	THE WITNESS: That's correct.
20	Q (By Mr. Paige) And it's your testimony that
21	nobody told you not to look at them; that's a decision
22	that you made on your own, correct?
23	MR. WALKER: Objection to form. Asked and
24	answered.
25	THE WITNESS: Well, it's a decision that I
93
1	made about what's necessary and important for me
2	to look at in terms of this testimony. And, and
3	so that is a decision I've made on my own. Yes.
Page 79
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	Q (By Mr. Paige) But is that something you
5	discussed with lawyers or you just made that decision
6	on your own and that was the end of it?
7	A Well, they have certainly not objected to
8	my decision. Let's put it that way.
9	Q Did you know that Professor Martin,
10	Michelle, Hoffman, Luis Martinez, Norrell, Sharp, all
11	these other experts that you've talked about before
12	for the tobacco companies, did you know that they
13	also have not looked at the tobacco documents either?
14	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
15	THE WITNESS: I'm not familiar with that.
16	No.
17	Q (By Mr. Paige) So if that were true, you
18	think it's just an independent coincidence that none of
19	the tobacco company experts have looked at the tobacco
20	documents despite all the publicity they've received,
21	and it's nothing that has been discussed with the
22	attorneys?
23	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
24	Q (By Mr. Paige) Is that your testimony?
25	A Well, certainly the attorneys have not
94
1	instructed me not to look at anything, including
2	those documents. But I, I don't believe it's a
3	coincidence. I believe that it's the nature of what
4	these historians are researching that's led them to
5	make a decision not to look at information that
6	wasn't in the public in an effort to determine what
7	public awareness was. That's not a surprising
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	decision to me if, in fact, that's a decision that,
9	that other people have also made.
10	Q Yeah. But you, you are testifying as to
11	what public beliefs are. You know the tobacco
12	companies are part of the public, the executives.
13	You can see right in their documents what they
14	believed, yet you don't want to look at it --
15	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
16	Q (By Mr. Paige) -- or just close your eyes.
17	A As I've indicated earlier, there are plenty
18	of public comments by the company stating their
19	position on that.
20	Q So that you're making the assumption that
21	the public statements were their, their truthful and
22	honest statements --
23	MR. WALKER: Objection.
24	Q (By Mr. Paige) -- that that's really what
25	they believed?
95
1	A Their public statements are the information
2	that I have about their beliefs. That's all I can
3	say.
4	Q So their belief -- you're willing to make
5	the statement -- you're willing to testify under oath
6	that they did not believe that cigarettes caused lung
7	cancer or was not addictive, but Nate Cohen, who has
8	nothing to do with the cigarette companies, he, he
9	should have known when the tobacco company said they
10	didn't know; is that correct?
11	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
12	THE WITNESS: Well, there are two or three
Page 81
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	parts to that. The first part is I can only
14	testify about the statements that the company's
15	made in public because those are the statements
16	that were part of the public awareness story.
17	And we've already discussed kind of what those
18	statements were.
19	in the case of Nate Cohen, it appears to me
20	from the deposition company -- deposition
21	testimony, excuse me, that he very definitely
22	believed that cigarettes were harmful to his
23	health and certainly the people that knew him
24	seemed to think that was the case. So I don't
25	think he was a person who didn't believe there
96
1	were risks.
2	Q (By Mr. Paige) You didn't, you didn't read
3	his wife's testimony where she said he didn't know what
4	to believe and he didn't really believe it until the
5	'80s?
6	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
7	Q (By Mr. Paige) Do you remember her saying
8	that under oath?
9	A Well, I think his wife's testimony was that
10	he was aware of the publicity about the health risks
11	of smoking. And I think she may have said that, that
12	he didn't believe, but his daughters and friends and
13	neighbors all seemed to indicate that he believed.
14	He talked to his daughters about the health risks of
15	smoking. One of his co-workers -- or a family friend
16	said they talked about the risk after the Surgeon
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	General's report in '64. Another one of his wife's
18	co-workers had conversations with him about the risk.
19	So I think that while since we don't have any --
20	Q Sir, my question, my -- I asked you about
21	beliefs, not awareness. Okay. You've already told
22	me awareness and belief are different. Okay? I'm
23	not going to go round and round in circles. So I
24	want to talk about beliefs. You keep talking about
25	awareness.
97
1	MR. WALKER: I'm going to ask you not to
2	interrupt the witness. If you ask a compound
3	question, you should expect a compound answer.
4	MR. PAIGE: I am interrupting him. If you
5	want to stop the depo, be my guest, John,
6	because I'm asking about belief.
7	MR. WALKER: if you ask a compound
8	question, you should expect a compound answer.
9	MR. PAIGE: No, no, no. I didn't ask a
10	compound question, so -- I'm asking about
11	beliefs, okay, not awareness. Let's be clear.
12	Q (By Mr. Paige) I want to know what -- when
13	did Nate Cohen -- my question is: Did you read his
14	wife's testimony where she said he did not believe it
15	until the '80s? Did you read that or not?
16	MR. walker: Objection to form. Asked and
17	answered.
18	THE WITNESS: I did read that testimony.
19	Yes.
20	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. Now, you're saying
21	other people said he believed it before the '80s. is
Page 83
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	that what you're now telling me?
23	A Yes. Based on the deposition testimony --
24	Q Okay.
25	A -- people other than his wife said that he
98
1	had beliefs, I would say certainly in the 1960s, that
2	there were health risks to smoking.
3	Q Okay, who said he believed that cigarettes
4	cause lung cancer in the '60s?
5	A I don't know that there was a specific
6	reference to lung cancer, but both of his -- there
7	was a deposition by a friend or extended family
8	member who said that they talked about the health
9	risks after the '64 Surgeon General's report. And
10	his daughter --
11	Q who said he believed, who said he believed
12	it in the 1960s? That's what I want to know.
13	A I believe there was testimony from his
14	daughters that in the late '60s or early '70s he
15	talked to them that smoking would be -- could be
16	harmful to your health.
17	Q Okay. Was that -- do you know what year
18	his daughter was born?
19	A I think '59 and '61 --
20	Q Okay.
21	A -- maybe.
22	Q So which daughter said that he, which
23	daughter said that he believed it in the '60s?
24	A I think that, I think that they both did.
25	Now, I recognize that his youngest daughter would
1	have been quite young, but his daughter Beth, I
2	believe, talked about doing a school project in 1969
3	where they talked about the health risks of smoking.
4	Now, she may have misstated that slightly, but the
5	deposition said 1969.
6	Q Okay. So you, you, you -- and I'm familiar
7	with that testimony. So you would extrapul ate from
8	that testimony that Nate Cohen, according to his
9	daughter, believed that cigarettes caused lung cancer
10	in the 1960s; is that correct?
11	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
12	THE WITNESS: I didn't say lung cancer, but
13	I said that based on his daughter's testimony I
14	believe that certainly by the early 1970s, if
15	not earlier, Nate Cohen believed that there were
16	serious health risks associated with cigarette
17	smoking.
18	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. That would be from one
19	of his daughters or both of his daughters that you came
20	to that conclusion?
21	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
22	THE WITNESS: To the best of my
23	recollection, I think from both of his
24	daughters' depositions.
25	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. And is there any other
100
1	information that you're basing -- that you -- is there
2	any other information that you have that Nate Cohen did
3	not believe like the tobacco companies that cigarettes
Page 85
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	had not been proven to be a cause, is there any other
5	testimony that you're basing your opinion that he
6	believed it in the '70s other than the two daughters?
7	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
8	THE WITNESS: Well, I think the bulk of the
9	deposition testimony that I reviewed indicated
10	that he certainly had a serious concern about
11	it. There was testimony from Janet Schwartz, I
12	believe, that went to that effect to -- from an
13	accountant that did work for them to that
14	effect. And there was testimony from one of his
15	wife's co-workers that he attended an American
16	Cancer Society quitting clinic in the 1980s,
17	which is certainly suggestive that he was --
18	that he believed smoking was a health risk.
19	Q (By Mr. Paige) All right. I agree with you
20	the testimony indicates by the '80s he believed it.
21	You're telling me that the two daughters stated that he
22	believed it in the late '60s, early '70s, and that's
23	part of your opinions. And, you know, the daughters
24	will say what they say and you'll -- I guess you'll
25	stand on that. But who else said that he believed it,
101
1	believed it -- not that he was aware of it, not that he
2	was concerned about it, but that he believed it in the
3	'60s or '70s other than the two daughters?
4	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
5	Q (By Mr. Paige) Just give me their names
6	because I'll have them testify.
7	A Well, as I said, I believe that both the
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	accountant -- whose name I don't remember -- and
9	Janet Schwartz indicated that certainly prior to the
10	1980s he had made comments to them that to me
11	suggested that Mr. Cohen was very definitely aware
12	and seemed to believe that there were serious health
13	risks related to smoking.
14	Q what, what statement, what statement did
15	Janet Schwartz make? Did you bring her depo with
16	you? Do you have it there?
17	A It -- I turned it over to John yesterday.
18	Q Okay. Do you have it with you or not?
19	MR. WALKER: It's one of the documents that
20	he's brought as part of your duces tecum
21	request.
22	MR. PAIGE: Okay.
23	MR. WALKER: I think it is.
24	Q (By Mr. Paige) Why don't you show me the part
25	of the depo of Janet Schwartz that's leading you to
102
1	believe that Nate Cohen believed cigarettes was deadly
2	or -- I forget what you said -- could cause deadly
3	disease in the '70s? Can you do that?
4	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
5	THE WITNESS: I'll need to look at the --
6	that deposition and probably the notes I have on
7	it as wel1.
8	MR. walker: Do you want to take a break?
9	MR. PAIGE: Okay.
10	(whereupon, a brief recess was taken.)
11	Q (By Mr. Paige) I want to attach your notes --
12	all notes that you have as Exhibit 1 to your
Page 87
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	deposition. What else did you bring with you other
14	than depositions and notes?
15	(Whereupon, the court reporter
16	marked Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 1 for
17	identification.)
18	A I brought a copy of my CV, the one invoice
19	which I -- you asked about earlier that I prepared
20	for this case, the copy of the reliance list.
21	Q Okay. So most of that I have except for
22	the notes, so if you could attach the notes as
23	Exhibit 1. Why don't you look at your notes for
24	Janet Schwartz and the other person and tell me what
25	of their testimony led you to testify under oath that
103
1	Janet Schwartz testified under oath that Nate Cohen
2	believed cigarettes were deadly in the '70s? Not
3	that he was aware of it, but that he believed it.
4	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
5	MR. PAIGE: Okay. We'll go off the record.
6	(whereupon, a brief recess was taken.)
7	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay, when did the tobacco
8	companies first believe -- what is your opinion, based
9	upon the materials that you reviewed, that the tobacco
10	companies first believed cigarettes caused lung cancer?
11	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
12	THE WITNESS: Their first statements were
13	in the past ten years on that subject.
14	Q (By Mr. Paige) And so it's your opinion that
15	the cigarette companies first believed cigarettes
16	caused lung cancer in the last ten years; is that
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	correct?
18	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
19	THE WITNESS: That was the time in which
20	they acknowledged that causation had been
21	proven.
22	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. The cigarette
23	executives are members of the general population,
24	correct?
25	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
104
1	THE WITNESS: That's correct.
2	Q (By Mr. Paige) And is it your opinion that
3	they first believed cigarettes cause lung cancer in the
4	last ten years?
5	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
6	THE WITNESS: I know that that's when they
7	made that statement. Yes.
8	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. And when is -- what is
9	your opinion as to when the cigarette executives or
10	cigarette companies first believed nicotine was
11	addictive?
12	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
13	THE WITNESS: I don't have any information
14	that would allow me to answer that except what
15	they said in public. And by the formal
16	definition of addiction that was being used at
17	the time, they first admitted that also in the
18	past ten years.
19	Q (By Mr. Paige) Do you have any reason to
20	believe that the cigarette companies first believed
21	cigarettes cause lung cancer before the last ten years?
Page 89
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	A The only information I have about their
23	beliefs are the things that were stated publicly.
24	And, as I've said earlier, I think those statements
25	tended to be that causation hadn't been proven, that
105
1	more research was needed. And that doesn't mean that
2	there wasn't some recognition, I suppose, of health
3	risks, but I don't -- I can only go by the public
4	statements that were made.
5	Q Do you have any reason to believe that the
6	cigarette companies believed more research was no
7	longer needed and the cause was proven prior to ten
8	years ago?
9	A No, I don't.
10	Q And the same would be true about them
11	admitting nicotine was addictive, correct?
12	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
13	THE WITNESS: Excuse me.
14	Q (By Mr. Paige) Do you have any reason to
15	believe that the cigarette companies believed nicotine
16	was addictive before ten years ago?
17	A Using the definition of addiction developed
18	by the Surgeon General at that time, no, I don't.
19	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
20	Q (By Mr. Paige) Now, it's your opinion,
21	though, Nate Cohen believed nicotine was addictive
22	when?
23	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
24	THE WITNESS: I don't know that I have
25	enough information from -- to know exact -- to
1	know when Nate Cohen believed or if he believed
2	that nicotine was addictive. Certainly he was a
3	person who --
4	Q (By Mr. Paige) Are you --
5	A -- who found it very difficult to quit
6	smoking.
7	Q And when did he first believe that it was
8	very difficult to quit smoking?
9	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: I don't know that I have
11	enough information to, to put a very precise
12	date on that.
13	Q (By Mr. Paige) And when did, when did Nate
14	Cohen first believe that cigarettes cause lung cancer
15	or other deadly disease?
16	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
17	THE WITNESS: Well, there is testimony that
18	suggests that he believed there were health
19	risks to smoking I believe as early as the
20	1960s.
21	Q (By Mr. Paige) And what statement is that?
22	A That's the statement on pages 44 and 45 of
23	Janet Schwartz's deposition.
24	Q And what does she say?
25	A That -- the question was: Did he ever talk
107
1	about his smoking to anyone you're aware of?
2	And she said yes.
3	And, who?
Page 91
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	She says, wel1 , me.
5	Question: What did he say?
6	There was a time when we talked about
7	smoking, it was not healthy.
8	Do you recall when that was?
9	It was shortly after the Surgeon General
10	made the warning that cigarette smoking was bad for
11	your health.
12	And that was the statement that I was
13	referring to earlier.
14	Q Okay. So that statement, that statement
15	indicates that he was aware of the Surgeon General
16	warning in 1964 which dealt with lung cancer,
17	correct?
18	A Yes; that's correct.
19	Q And you know, following the Surgeon General
20	report on lung cancer, far more people had heard of
21	it than actually believed it, correct?
22	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
23	THE WITNESS: Yes. A large majority of
24	Americans believed it, but almost everyone was
25	aware of the information at that time.
108
1	Q (By Mr. Paige) Right. Mostly everybody had
2	heard of the Surgeon General report, but there were
3	millions of smokers who did not believe it, correct?
4	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
5	Q (By Mr. Paige) Or is that incorrect?
6	A Well, by 1969, the belief level among the
7	population was about 70 percent. The other
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	30 percent were divided between not believing it and
9	being uncertain.
10	Q Okay. Sir, following the Surgeon General
11	report, do you agree or disagree that there were
12	millions of smokers who did not believe that
13	cigarettes caused lung cancer?
14	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
15	THE WITNESS: There was a small proportion
16	of Americans who did not believe after the
17	Surgeon General's report. A small proportion
18	would be a number of people, certainly.
19	Q (By Mr. Paige) Do you not understand what the
20	word "millions" means? Do you not understand that
21	term?
22	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
23	THE WITNESS: In my, in my examination of
24	this trying to understand what the public was
25	aware of and what the public believed, I tend to
109
1	look at these in percentage or proportion terms.
2	I would have to go back and review -- I
3	understand what millions means, but exactly how
4	many at any point in time, I would have to
5	review. But I do understand --
6	Q (By Mr. Paige) But do you -- so just tell
7	me -- okay. So tell me you don't know if you don't
8	know. You don't have to answer a different question.
9	Do you know if there were millions of
10	smokers following the Surgeon General report who did
11	not believe cigarettes caused lung cancer?
12	MR. WALKER: Objection.
Page 93
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	Q (By Mr. Paige) Do you know that or do you not
14	know that?
15	MR. WALKER: Objection to form. And I
16	object to you instructing the deponent on how to
17	answer your questions.
18	THE WITNESS: That, that number at the time
19	would have been in the millions. I don't know
20	what the exact number would be off the top of my
21	head.
22	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. See, that wasn't that
23	difficult, was it? was that that hard to do? was that
24	that hard to answer the question like that?
25	MR. WALKER: Ask your next question, Mr.
110
1	Paige.
2	Q (By Mr. Paige) I don't understand the
3	reluctance to not answer the questions I'm asking you.
4	We don't have to play games. You're busy, I'm busy.
5	So, believe me, just like you don't want to be here all
6	day with me, I assure you, I don't want to be here all
7	day with you. So if you just answer my questions --
8	because you've answered them before. Most of the stuff
9	I'm asking you I've asked you before, so I know what
10	your answers are. You don't have to, you know, play
11	games. There is no reason to do that.
12	MR. WALKER: I object to the
13	characterization of the witness playing games
14	and I'll ask that you move on to your next
15	question, please.
16	Q (By Mr. Paige) Do you know if Nate Cohen was
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	one of the millions of smokers who did not -- who had
18	heard of the Surgeon General report, but did not
19	beli eve i t?
20	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
21	THE WITNESS: I don't have enough
22	information to determine it. It seems clear
23	that he was aware of it and I think the evidence
24	suggestions -- suggested that he believed there
25	were health risks from smoking after the Surgeon
111
1	General's report.
2	Q (By Mr. Paige) Well, that's what I'm trying
3	to find out. That -- you read me Janet Schwartz's
4	testimony. Is there other testimony that you think is
5	suggestive that he believed it?
6	A I think the testimony of his youngest
7	daughter, that he was -- by the 1970s he believed it.
8	Yes. And then his --
9	Q Okay. So, so is it fair to say that, based
10	upon your review of the record, he was aware of the
11	1964 Surgeon General report, but there is conflicting
12	information as to whether he believed it in the '70s
13	or the '80s? is that a fair statement?
14	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
15	THE WITNESS: To be more specific, I would
16	say that his wife tends to dispute whether he
17	believed it or not and the other two deponents
18	suggest very strongly that he did believe it.
19	So it's contradictory in this case.
20	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. So you had -- okay.
21	Well, we'll see. But just so I'm clear: The
Page 95
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	'64 Surgeon General report comes out. Everybody was
23	aware of it, including the tobacco executives, correct?
24	Correct?
25	A Yes; that's correct.
112
1	Q There were millions of people who didn't
2	believe it, correct?
3	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
4	THE WITNESS: Yes.
5	Q (By Mr. Paige) Including, according to your
6	research, the tobacco executives didn't yet believe it,
7	correct?
8	A That's correct.
9	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
10	Q (By Mr. Paige) And it wasn't until the '70s
11	that the daughters say he believed it, but the '80s the
12	wife said he believed it, correct?
13	A Yes. I think that's generally consistent
14	with my testimony.
15	Q And that would be either one or two
16	decades -- or two or three decades before the tobacco
17	executives believed it, correct?
18	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
19	THE WITNESS: The public statements of the
20	tobacco companies came, yes, after levels of
21	public belief were almost universal.
22	Q (By Mr. Paige) So that would -- so Nate
23	Cohen, if he believes it in the '70s or the '80s, he
24	would have -- according to your research, he would have
25	believed it 20 or 30 years before the tobacco
113
1	executives believed it?
2	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
3	Q (By Mr. Paige) Correct?
4	A Based on their public statements, that's
5	correct; yes.
6	Q And if he didn't believe it until the '70s
7	or '80s, according to some of the polls that you
8	reviewed -- the Roper polls, the FTC polls -- there
9	were millions of smokers who didn't start believing
10	it until the '70s or '80s, just like Nate Cohen,
11	correct?
12	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
13	THE WITNESS: Yes. Although those people
14	were always in the minority of Americans, but
15	yes.
16	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay, well, is there
17	something wrong with being in minority or in the
18	minority?
19	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
20	THE WITNESS: No. There is nothing wrong,
21	but I think it's helpful to context when you use
22	a large number that it's -- that it is a
23	minority.
24	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. But if you have --
25	sometimes people who are in the minority are right,
114
1	correct? The masters aren't always correct, are they?
2	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
3	THE WITNESS: No, they're not.
Page 97
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	Q (By Mr. Paige) In fact, early in the
5	eighteen -- I mean in the 19th century, there were a
6	lot of people who thought cigarettes cause
7	tuberculosis, correct?
8	A There was a lot of belief at one time that
9	cigarettes were one of the causes of tuberculosis.
10	Yes.
11	Q And, and those people were wrong, correct?
12	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
13	THE WITNESS: with the understanding that
14	I'm not a medical expert, it is my lay
15	understanding that that has not proven to be the
16	case.
17	Q (By Mr. Paige) And the, the cigarette
18	companies, the manufacturer of the products, did not
19	state publicly that it had been proven that cigarettes
20	cause lung cancer until, until the late 1990s or early
21	2000s, correct?
22	A Again, as I've stated earlier, yes.
23	Q Is it fair to say you're not an expert on
24	consumer choice as to the reason why cigarettes
25	became so popular?
115
1	A Well, no. I think I have given testimony
2	in previous cases -- I don't know that I will in this
3	case -- about the -- about historical evolution of
4	the popularity of the cigarette, so I do have
5	expertise on that.
6	Mr. Paige, before you ask, before you ask
7	another question, can I get one of these two-minute
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	breaks?
9	Q I'm sorry.
10	A I didn't get to take a break when I was
11	looking through. It will just be very brief.
12	Q No problem.
13	(whereupon, a brief recess was taken.)
14	Q (By Mr. Paige) You know, I just want to know
15	if you are or you are not. Do you consider yourself an
16	expert on consumer choice as to the reasons why
17	cigarettes became so popular?
18	A I think I've answered that already.
19	Q I don't understand. Are you an expert on
20	that or not?
21	A Yes. I think I am a historical expert on
22	the rise of cigarettes as a popular consumer product.
23	Q Okay. At the turn of the century, at the
24	turn of the 20th century, there were not that many
25	people smoking, correct?
116
1	A Not smoking cigarettes. That would be
2	correct. Yeah.
3	Q All right. And then there was a rise
4	sometime between the early 1900s through the 1950s,
5	correct?
6	A Yes; that's correct.
7	Q And two of the major events that led to the
8	rise of -- well, cigarettes were the -- world war I,
9	correct, is one of the reasons?
10	A That appears to be a factor. Yes.
11	Q The mass marketing that took place,
12	correct?
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	A Well, the production of the cigarette as a,
14	as a product, mass-produced product was a factor as
15	was the --
16	Q When did that occur?
17	A -- invention -- that occurred in the late,
18	late 18th century and by the 19th century was, was --
19	by the 20th century was common, by the early 1900s
20	was common.
21	Q And that was, and that was the Bonsack
22	machine?
23	A Yes.
24	Q And then after that, you had World War I,
25	and then, like, you had the mass marketing of the
117
1	Camel cigarettes, correct?
2	A You also had -- in addition to, to those
3	things, you also had the shift to -- became an urban
4	nation by 1920, the shift to factory production where
5	the use of other forms of tobacco like chewing
6	tobacco, snuff for cigars was less practical.
7	Cigarette smoking seemed to work well for smoking
8	breaks in factories and those kinds of things. So
9	there were a variety of factors that went into that.
10	Yes.
11	Q Right. Well, before -- there was a time
12	when cigarettes were not inhalable either, correct?
13	A I don't know that they weren't inhalable,
14	but they were mostly hand rolled and made from very
15	strong tobacco.
16	Q And then they had the flue curing process
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	that was invented, correct?
18	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
19	THE WITNESS: Yes. There were a variety of
20	innovations in the processing. Yes.
21	Q (By Mr. Paige) That made cigarettes more
22	inhalable, correct?
23	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
24	THE WITNESS: I don't know that I'd put it
25	that way, but it helped, helped their rise of
118
1	popularity as a product, consumer product.
2	Q (By Mr. Paige) You don't think flue curing
3	made the cigarettes more inhalable?
4	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
5	THE WITNESS: I would have to review that
6	question. I think it may improve taste.
7	Q (By Mr. Paige) You think -- you never read
8	that flue curing enabled the pH level to be lowered so
9	that cigarettes could be tolerated when inhaled --
10	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
11	Q (By Mr. Paige) -- as opposed to a cigar that
12	doesn't have flue curing?
13	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
14	THE WITNESS: I can't say that I recall
15	that off the top of my head. I may have well
16	read i t.
17	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. So just so I
18	understand: You think flue curing made cigarettes
19	taste better and you're not sure whether it made them
20	more inhalable?
21	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.

22	THE WITNESS: It made them more palatable
23	to consumers. Let's put it that way. To be
24	more specific --
25	Q (By Mr. Paige) But you don't know why?
119
1	A -- I would have to review to see.
2	Q Okay. So you had the late 18th century the
3	invention of the Bonsack machine, the flue curing.
4	And then at the turn of the century you had World War
5	I and mass marketing. And all those four events
6	helped contribute to the rise of the popularization
7	of cigarettes in America, correct?
8	A In varying degrees; yes.
9	Q And by 1950s, half of all adults were
10	smoking cigarettes, correct?
11	A Approximately, yeah. Maybe just under
12	half.
13	Q And that was about 50 million Americans at
14	that time, correct?
15	A Again, I, I can't agree to the absolute
16	number without checking. But just under half of all
17	adult Americans. Yes. That sounds about right.
18	Q Well, do you know approximately how many --
19	A That sounds about right.
20	Q Okay. So it was approximately 50 million
21	Americans or half of the adults were smoking in the
22	1950s?
23	A Yes, approximately.
24	Q And when you say, when you say "adults,"
25	are you talking about -- people over what age?
1	A Well, the legal age for smoking was
2	different in different states, so I might have to --
3	my answer is based on percentages derived from, from
4	polls and other reports on what percentage of
5	Americans smoked and I would have to go back and
6	examine what age they used. But 16, 18, 21 were,
7	were different ages that states used.
8	Q Okay. But you -- okay. But the '40s and
9	the '50s when the tobacco companies were using sports
10	personnel and movie stars and past and future
11	presidents to advertise their products, you know that
12	there were teenagers -- 12, 13, 14 years old -- who
13	were smoking, do you not?
14	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
15	THE WITNESS: Yes. I have seen evidence to
16	that effect. Yes.
17	Q (By Mr. Paige) All right. And Nate Cohen was
18	somebody who started smoking -- I think he was like 14,
19	15 years old, correct?
20	A I would have to say that it -- that it's
21	hard to know when he started because I didn't see any
22	testimony who actually -- of anybody who actually
23	knew him when he was that age, but the, the reports
24	through the depositions indicated that. Yes. But
25	those were second- and third-hand testimony.
121
1	Q Okay. But that was consist -- well, was
2	that consistent with what Nate told his doctors in
3	the medical records?
Page 103
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
5	THE WITNESS: I have not reviewed the
6	medical records.
7	Q (By Mr. Paige) The cigarette and lung cancer
8	connection began to take footing in 1948, 1950 and
9	intensified over the next several decades, correct?
10	A There had been evidence of it before that
11	and discussion of it, but it really became the focus
12	of the public health concern and discussion beginning
13	about 1948 in a way that it had not been previously,
14	and it was one of the most discussed public health
15	stories in the United States in the 1950s.
16	Q Okay. Do you agree that it started -- the
17	cigarette and lung cancer connection began to, began
18	to be discussed in the public domain around 1948,
19	1950 and intensified over the next several decades?
20	A Well, I think it was, was intense -- yes.
21	I think it was very intense in the '50s and '60s and
22	170s al1. Yes.
23	Q Okay. You know who said that, who made
24	that statement before?
25	A It could well have been me.
122
1	Q Right. That's why I'm not disagreeing with
2	you.
3	A it intensified in that period compared to
4	the earlier period.
5	Q And Reader's Digest was the first major
6	publication addressing the lung cancer smoking
7	connection in 1950, correct?
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	A It certainly began to address it in a very
9	major way in 1950. Yes.
10	Q And the Frank statement was published,
11	what, in 1953 or '54?
12	A 1954. Early 1954.
13	Q And that was a statement -- a public
14	statement where the tobacco companies publicly stated
15	they did not believe the link between smoking and
16	lung cancer had been proven, correct?
17	A it was an advertisement that the companies
18	took out in newspapers across the country which said
19	that there had -- that they did not believe the
20	recent statistical work which had gained a lot of
21	attention had proven a cause and effect relationship
22	between smoking and lung cancer. And they pledged to
23	support additional research in the -- on the subject
24	in the future.
25	Q And they continued with that statement or
123
1	stance for decades thereafter, correct?
2	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
3	THE WITNESS: It was certainly a statement
4	that persisted for the next 15 years or so in
5	the public press. Yes.
6	Q (By Mr. Paige) well, they made that statement
7	in response to the 1964 or the 1969 Surgeon General
8	reports, correct?
9	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: They made similar statements
11	to that, statements to that effect or very
12	similar statements in their public responses.
Page 105
13	Yes.
14	Q (By Mr. Paige) And you're aware of public
15	statements in the '70s that tobacco companies assured
16	smokers that they did not accept cigarettes were
17	harmful, and if there were any dangerous ingredient
18	ever identified they would be removed, correct?
19	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
20	THE WITNESS: I have seen those statements.
21	Yes.
22	Q (By Mr. Paige) And the, the -- okay. Now,
23	you reviewed certain polls, Roper polls, Gallup polls,
24	correct?
25	A Among -- yes, among other polls. Also
124
1	Harris polls and some government polls.
2	Q what, what is the, the Roper, Gallup and
3	Harris polls? What are they?
4	A Those are private polling organizations
5	that also typically release at least some of their
6	polling information to the public and sometimes their
7	polls were publicized in the press as well.
8	Q Why did you choose to rely upon those polls
9	as opposed to other polls that we may have?
10	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
11	THE WITNESS: They were voluminous in
12	nature. They were easy to access. Their
13	methodology was explained in some public place
14	that I could access so I could understand it. I
15	also used a number of government and other polls
16	which met the same criteria.
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	Q (By Mr. Paige) is the Harris poll a leading
18	poll organization?
19	A It was in the 1960s. I'm not sure that it
20	is today. I haven't checked on it recently. But it
21	was a leading polling organization in the 1960s.
22	Q what about the Gallup and Roper polls? Are
23	those leading polling organizations?
24	A The Gallup polling organization certainly
25	was at that time and it remains active. And the
125
1	Roper poll was a leading polling organization as
2	wel1.
3	Q Are those -- would you consider the Gallup
4	and Roper polls to be the two leading polling
5	organizations aside from the governmental polls?
6	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
7	THE WITNESS: They are certainly -- they
8	were certainly active polling organizations in
9	that time. I don't know. I didn't see -- I did
10	see occasional polls from other sources that I
11	would look at, but those were ones I most
12	commonly saw and I could verify their
13	methodology. I made no attempt to establish
14	their ranking among polling organizations for
15	that sort of thing.
16	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. So you might be relying
17	on polls that are not even the, the most reliable
18	polling organizations?
19	A No.
20	Q You don't know?
21	A No. That's not correct. I did -- I --
Page 107
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	they are very reliable polling organizations. What
23	I'm saying is I don't know how large they were
24	compared to others. Gallup is certainly the most
25	well-known organization and Harris was well known at
126
1	that time as well.
2	Q And Roper?
3	A I'm not as sure about Roper in terms of --
4	I'm confident in the methodology of the polls that
5	I've selected. I don't know where it stacks up, but
6	it appears to have been a prominent polling
7	organization.
8	Q Are you a polling expert?
9	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: As all historians do, I would
11	use polls in my research. I'm not a pollster.
12	I wouldn't attempt to design a poll. But in
13	terms of understanding its results and its
14	validity, I'm qualified to do that.
15	Q (By Mr. Paige) Are you comfortable relying
16	upon polls in your expert opinions?
17	A If I am -- you know, if they're publicly
18	available and I can understand how and when they were
19	done, yes.
20	Q So are you comfortable, then, or not?
21	A Under those conditions, yes.
22	Q Are those the conditions that you operated
23	under or not?
24	A Yes.
25	Q And do you think the polls are an important
127
1	part, or you don't really need them for your
2	testimony?
3	A Well, I think somewhere in between those
4	two alternatives. I think they are a valuable piece
5	of the testimony. I think you shouldn't -- it would
6	be my position and should be any historian's position
7	that you shouldn't give anything excessive weight
8	outside of the context. And you need to understand
9	the context of what the information and environment
10	was when a certain poll was taken and understand the
11	poll in that context. So I don't over value polls.
12	I wouldn't lift them above other sources of
13	information. But they are valuable just as all the
14	other sources of information I use are.
15	Q Did you -- as a historian, can you tell me
16	what is the most authoritative polling organization?
17	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
18	THE WITNESS: Well, and I'm not sure that
19	the concept of authoritative -- the most
20	authoritative goes with an organization. The
21	authoritativeness of polls depends on how
22	they're done. And if they're methodology is
23	explained, lots of organizations can do a
24	reliable and reputable poll. I simply pick
25	larger ones whose polls tended to be public and
128
1	whose methodology was well laid out, as were
2	the -- as was the case in government polls.
3	Q (By Mr. Paige) And -- but not Roper and
Page 109
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	Gallup and Harris?
5	A No. Including Roper and Gallup and Harris.
6	Q The -- you agree it would be unlikely that
7	Nathan Cohen believed smoking caused lung cancer in
8	the 1940s?
9	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: I just don't have any
11	evidence to, to know what Nate Cohen would have
12	believed in the 1940s about anything because I
13	have no information from anyone who knew him in
14	the 1940s. I, I do know --
15	Q (By Mr. Paige) well -- go ahead.
16	A That was the end.
17	Q I mean, you -- as I said, you can tell me
18	you don't know. But as a historian and an expert on
19	public awareness, knowing that the Frank statement
20	was not even published until 1954 and the Surgeon
21	General report didn't come out until 1964 and
22	Reader's Digest didn't publish their first article
23	until 1950, do you think it was likely or unlikely
24	that a teenager believed smoking caused lung cancer
25	in the 1940s?
129
1	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
2	THE WITNESS: Well, there was an abundance
3	of that information, including information from
4	school textbooks showing that -- which -- and
5	Nate Cohen did go through the school system as a
6	well-educated person -- talking about the health
7	hazards of smoking including respiratory
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	diseases like lung cancer and diseases that
9	could shorten your life. So I do think that the
10	level of awareness of the health risks of
11	smoking was quite high in the 1940s. That
12	information was available to Nate Cohen as a
13	young man, as a student. I don't know what his
14	beliefs were at that time.
15	The focus of the discussion had not turned
16	to lung cancer as it did a few years later, but
17	it was included in the larger information about
18	diseases that could cause you to die earlier
19	than otherwise.
20	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. Do you know what Nate
21	Cohen believed about deadly diseases of smoking in the
22	'40s, '50s or '60s, what his belief level was?
23	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
24	Q (By Mr. Paige) And, if so, just tell me what
25	it was.
130
1	A I don't, I don't have any information on
2	what he believed in the 1940s or 1950s. There is
3	information, which I testified earlier, that he
4	believed there were health risks to smoking in the,
5	in the 1960s and some in the '70s, and it was clear
6	that by the 1980s he believed there was serious
7	risks.
8	Q Okay. And the -- what was the event that
9	caused the Frank statement to be published and the
10	intensification of the battle or information about
11	cigarettes and lung cancer that occurred over the
12	next four decades?
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	MR. WALKER: Objection.
14	Q (By Mr. Paige) what was the event that
15	started it all?
16	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
17	THE WITNESS: Well, I don't believe that
18	there was a single event, but there was
19	appearing between 1948 and '54 or end of 1953
20	were a series of epidemiological or statistical
21	studies showing that smokers were much more
22	likely to die of lung cancer than nonsmokers,
23	and that the more you smoked, the more likely
24	you were to die from lung cancer.
25	There was also some research done in the
131
1	laboratory in 1953 that got a lot of publicity,
2	the mouse skin painting experiments. And so I
3	think that when the Frank statement refers to
4	recent work that's come out, it was that body of
5	work that had been appearing and getting
6	widespread publicity in the early 1950s that --
7	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay.
8	A -- was the, was the backdrop for that
9	statement.
10	Q Okay, is it fair to say that after the
11	turn of the century, as more and more people started
12	smoking and we had this popularization of cigarettes
13	occurring, scientists began seeing over the '30s and
14	the '40s and the '50s more and more cases of lung
15	cancer?
16	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	THE WITNESS: Yes. There --
18	MR. WALKER: Go ahead.
19	THE WITNESS: Yes. I think that definitely
20	as, as more people smoked, and particularly as
21	more people had smoked for a couple or three
22	decades, there was a dramatic rise in the number
23	of lung cancer cases which is what helped chest
24	surgeons, heart surgeons begin to notice it.
25	There began to be statistical analysis of it and
132
1	out of this analysis of lung cancer came the
2	link with smoking as a cause.
3	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. And so as a result of
4	the, the rise in lung cancer and the rise in smoking at
5	the same time, these studies between 1948 and 1953 were
6	conducted which started to tend to prove the, the
7	relationship between smoking and lung cancer in the
8	medical community, correct?
9	A Yes. And to be widely publicized to the
10	general public as well.
11	Q And then after the Frank statement, those
12	studies continued -- people continued studying
13	whether there was a link between smoking and lung
14	cancer. And that takes us to the 1964 Surgeon
15	General report, correct?
16	A Yes; that's correct.
17	Q And then the Surgeon General comes out and
18	says it. And despite that, the tobacco companies
19	publicly denied it for decades, correct?
20	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
21	THE WITNESS: Again, I think the companies'
Page 113
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	statements are as I characterized them earlier.
23	Q (By Mr. Paige) You don't consider them to be
24	a denial?
25	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
133
1	THE WITNESS: I think that what they say is
2	that they don't believe causation has been
3	proven. So they deny the proof of causation.
4	Yes.
5	Q (By Mr. Paige) Do you agree that the belief
6	levels amongst smokers about the relationship between
7	smoking and lung cancer is much lower than the general
8	population?
9	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
10	THE WITNESS: It is lower than the
11	general -- among -- the belief level, not the
12	awareness level, but the belief level amongst
13	smokers is lower than among the nonsmoking
14	population. Yes.
15	Q (By Mr. Paige) And the majority of smokers in
16	the 1950s did not yet believe that smoking caused lung
17	cancer, correct?
18	A My recollection of the polling data for the
19	1950s is that there were, there were more smokers who
20	did not believe than believed, and then there was
21	another category that were still undecided. And so I
22	think to get to a majority you have to combine the
23	two categories in that poll. But it is certainly
24	true that belief levels were higher among smokers
25	than -- were lower among smokers than among
134
1	nonsmokers.
2	Q Well, without telling you who made this
3	statement, I want to know if you agree or disagree
4	with it: The majority of smokers in the 1950s did
5	not believe smoking caused lung cancer. Do you agree
6	with that or disagree with that person?
7	A I think the majority of smokers either did
8	not believe or not decided one way or the other.
9	That's certainly true. So if that means -- that
10	would be a majority who had not decided to believe.
11	I'm trying to be as complete as I can in my answer.
12	Q So do you agree or do you disagree that a
13	majority of smokers in the '50s did not yet believe
14	smoking caused lung cancer?
15	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
16	THE WITNESS: Under -- as I explained it,
17	yes, I think I believe that.
18	Q (By Mr. Paige) And do you agree that in 1957
19	there were 25 to 30 million smokers who didn't believe
20	smoking caused lung cancer yet?
21	A Again, I tend to work in percentages as
22	opposed to absolute numbers. And that sounds like
23	that is approximately the number, but I would want to
24	double check before --
25	Q Without telling, without telling you who
135
1	made the statement, I just want to know if you agree
2	or disagree that 25 to 30 million smokers did not
3	believe smoking caused lung cancer in 1957, according
Page 115
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	to the polls?
5	A I would say that that sounds correct
6	without being too precise about it.
7	Q Approximately?
8	A Okay.
9	Q I'm willing to say that.
10	In 1964, the belief level -- well, in 1964,
11	there were still 25 million smokers who did not yet
12	believe smoking caused lung cancer, correct?
13	A Again, I tend to not work in absolute
14	numbers.
15	Q Approximately?
16	A That sounds approximately correct. The
17	overall belief level in the population right after
18	the Surgeon General's report was at about 60,
19	61 percent. And so the minority that did not believe
20	would have been approximately that number.
21	Q Right. In 1964, the belief level of
22	smoking causing lung cancer was about 61 percent and
23	it was actually even lower for smokers, correct?
24	A That's correct; yes.
25	Q And, in fact, somebody -- I'm not going to
136
1	tell you who. I just want to know if you agree that
2	the fact is there were 25 million smokers who did not
3	yet believe smoking caused lung cancer in 1964,
4	approximately.
5	A Approximately, yes.
6	Q And in 1969, there were still approximately
7	25 million Americans, according to the polls, who
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	still didn't believe smoking caused lung cancer,
9	correct?
10	A Again, as I think I've said several times,
11	I did not track that in terms of absolute numbers.
12	The belief level was up to about 70 percent and it
13	had increased amongst smokers as well as nonsmokers,
14	but that still left a large number of smokers who did
15	not believe -- even though they were aware of the
16	information, they did not believe that smoking caused
17	lung cancer.
18	Q Okay. Do you agree or disagree with this
19	statement: In 1969, approximately 25 million
20	Americans still didn't believe smoking caused lung
21	cancer?
22	MR. WALKER: Objection to form. Asked and
23	answered.
24	THE WITNESS: I, I stand by my previous
25	answer to that.
137
1	Q (By Mr. Paige) No. I want to know: Do you
2	agree or disagree with the statement that somebody made
3	within the past year that, in 1969, 25 million
4	Americans still didn't believe smoking caused lung
5	cancer? Do you agree or disagree with that statement
6	that was made under oath by somebody?
7	MR. WALKER: Objection to form. Asked and
8	answered.
9	THE WITNESS: Well, again, I think I did
10	answer in saying that in, in round numbers
11	that's -- that might be accurate. Yes.
12	Q (By Mr. Paige) Does that sound pretty
Page 117
13	accurate to you?
14	A I honestly don't hold these population
15	numbers in my head over time and I'll have to --
16	Q Well, do you want to go look at the poll?
17	A Yes.
18	Q Do you want to go look at the poll? You
19	do? Okay.
20	A The poll wouldn't tell me the absolute
21	number, in all likelihood. The poll usually gives a
22	percentage. Sometimes it translates that into
23	absolute numbers. But I'm not, I'm not really trying
24	to, to disagree with you about the number. It's just
25	saying that I don't hold those absolute numbers in my
138
1	head as the percentages that I focus on.
2	Q I know that. But I've deposed you before
3	and we've had these discussions without difficulty,
4	so --
5	A I may have had a fresher memory of it last
6	time than I do this time. I mean --
7	Q Okay. So would you rather -- you would
8	rather -- so right now, is it fair to say you don't
9	know if you agree or disagree that in 1969
10	approximately 25 million Americans still didn't
11	believe smoking caused lung cancer? You don't know?
12	MR. WALKER: Objection to form. Asked and
13	answered.
14	THE WITNESS: I've given you the best
15	answer I can to that already.
16	Q (By Mr. Paige) I don't understand. You said
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	"might," you gave me some other roundabout answer. So
18	I just want to know if you agree, disagree or you don't
19	know the answer to the question.
20	A I would have to double check for the
21	accuracy of your 25 million.
22	MR. WALKER: Objection to form. Asked and
23	answered.
24	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. So that's why I'm going
25	to ask you it again. And if you say you don't know,
139
1	you don't know. In 1969, approximately 25 million
2	Americans still didn't believe smoking caused lung
3	cancer.
4	MR. WALKER: Objection to form. Asked and
5	answered.
6	Q (By Mr. Paige) Is your answer you don't know?
7	A I would have to double check for a precise
8	number. No. I don't know the number precisely.
9	Q Okay. Can you give me an approximate
10	number without double checking?
11	A No. I wouldn't want to do that, what I
12	could, could tell you is that it was probably over,
13	over 30 percent of smokers did not believe at that
14	time.
15	Q Okay, well, and then there were some
16	nonsmokers who didn't believe it either, correct?
17	A Yes. That number was a low percentage, but
18	there were some that did not. And there were many
19	smokers who did believe it, of course.
20	Q Right. And at any given time there were
21	roughly more or less about 50 million smokers,
Page 119
22	correct?
23	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
24	Q (By Mr. Paige) Because even though the
25	percentages went down, the populations were rising,
140
1	correct?
2	A Again, I'm trying to be as forthcoming
3	about this as possible. I haven't tracked those,
4	those population numbers over time. I understand
5	what you're saying about the percentage declines, but
6	there is the population grows larger. And I just
7	don't want to stipulate to an improper number without
8	reviewing the absolute number, which I didn't do
9	before today thinking --
10	Q Why don't you tell me -- no problem. Why
11	don't you tell me approximately how many smokers you
12	think there were, you know, just give me a range in
13	1969.
14	A Well, I hate to give information that I've
15	just -- that's not based on something that I have a
16	clear memory of. I mean, I could -- I would have to
17	reason that into a commonsensical way, but that
18	doesn't seem appropriate to me when I could look.
19	Q But I have not, I have not been doing this
20	for nearly as long as you have and I kind of figured
21	out pretty quickly that it's always been about
22	50 million smokers. Have you not figured that out?
23	Have you never figured that out?
24	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
25	THE WITNESS: I wouldn't say that I've
141
1	never figured it out, but I've never committed
2	those absolute numbers to memory --
3	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay.
4	A -- working with percentages I usually do.
5	I'm not disputing your number. I'm just saying I
6	couldn't agree with it either without checking.
7	Q Okay, would you agree that there would
8	have been at least 30 million smokers in 1969?
9	A That sounds plausible to me. But, again, I
10	would have to look it up. The population of the --
11	Q Would you have -- no problem. Would you
12	have any reason to disagree with prior testimony if
13	you stated in 1969 there were 25 million Americans
14	who still didn't believe smoking caused cancer? Has
15	anything happened that would have changed your
16	mind --
17	A No. My mind is not changed.
18	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
19	THE WITNESS: My mind is not changed. I
20	just can't remember the number clearly today.
21	Q (By Mr. Paige) In the '70s, you would agree,
22	according to the polls, there were still millions of
23	smokers -- just saying millions -- that didn't believe
24	smoking caused lung cancer?
25	A Yes. There remained people who do not
142
1	believe, even though that's a shrinking percentage
2	over time.
3	Q All right. I didn't ask you about
Page 121
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	shrinking. I was just asking: Do you agree, in the
5	'70s, there were still millions of American smokers
6	who didn't believe the link between smoking and lung
7	cancer?
8	MR. walker: Objection to form. Asked and
9	answered.
10	THE WITNESS: Yes, there were.
11	Q (By Mr. Paige) And during that level of
12	belief among smokers, there were public statements
13	being made by tobacco executives to smokers reassuring
14	them that the link had not been proven, and if ever
15	proven, they would remove the dangerous ingredients,
16	correct?
17	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
18	THE WITNESS: There were, there were
19	certainly statements being made to the effect
20	that causation had not been proven and there
21	were statements being made -- and, in fact, the
22	government was even making statements that work
23	was underway to try to make cigarettes safer
24	than they were, even though they couldn't be
25	made safe. So those were statements that were
143
1	being made.
2	Q (By Mr. Paige) But you've read the Surgeon
3	General report, correct?
4	A Some of them. Yes.
5	Q And have you read the DSM manual on
6	nicotine addiction? Have you ever looked at that?
7	A I don't recognize that off the top of my
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	head. No.
9	Q Okay. But on the 1988 Surgeon General
10	report on nicotine addiction, you know that the vast,
11	vast overwhelming majority of these regular smokers
12	who believed smoking was -- who were stating that
13	they believed smoking did not cause lung cancer,
14	these were people who were, who were addicts, they
15	were addicted, correct?
16	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
17	THE WITNESS: I'm not an addiction expert
18	and I wouldn't undertake to say anything about
19	that from the standpoint of addicted. I do know
20	that many people found it very -- smoking was
21	referred to as addictive in a lay sense by a lot
22	of people, it was habit-forming, and that many
23	people found it very difficult to quit.
24	Although many people quit very successfully,
25	so -- and I'm just not an expert on addiction.
144
1	Q (By Mr. Paige) All right. And many people
2	died because they couldn't quit, correct?
3	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
4	Q (By Mr. Paige) 300,000 people die a year
5	because they can't quit, correct?
6	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
7	THE WITNESS: I couldn't agree with that.
8	No.
9	Q (By Mr. Paige) Well, how many people do you
10	think die a year from smoking cigarettes --
11	A That number sounds --
12	Q -- of the company -Page 123
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	A -- accurate, but I --
14	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
15	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. That number
16	sounds accurate, that there are many deaths
17	attributed -- that many deaths attributed every
18	year to cigarette smoking, but I don't know why
19	people continue to smoke.
20	Q (By Mr. Paige) Well, did you ever, did you
21	ever see the Surgeon General report on nicotine
22	addiction where it describes why people continue to
23	smoke?
24	A I have seen that.
25	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
145
1	THE WITNESS: I have seen that opinion.
2	Yes.
3	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. So -- and have you seen
4	the Surgeon General report of 1989 where they say it's
5	not a choice to smoke, but an addiction?
6	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
7	THE WITNESS: I have seen the 1989 Surgeon
8	General's report. I don't remember that exact
9	statement, but statements to that effect. Yes.
10	Q (By Mr. Paige) So, so assuming that 85 to
11	90 percent of regular smokers are addicted to nicotine
12	and these tobacco executives are publicly stating that
13	nic -- that cigarettes have not been proven to kill,
14	and that they're going to remove the dangerous
15	ingredients, does that help explain to you as a
16	historian why there are still millions of American
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	smokers in the '70s still saying, hey, I don't believe
18	i t yet?
19	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
20	THE WITNESS: No. I think there --no. I
21	think one cannot simplify it. There were many
22	people who, who, who smoked and they smoked for
23	a variety of reasons.
24	Q (By Mr. Paige) You, you reviewed the 1981 FTC
25	poll?
146
1	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
2	THE WITNESS: I think that's not a poll
3	that I have relied on for my opinion, but I have
4	seen that in the course of litigation. Yes.
5	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. And you would agree --
6	you know that as late as 1981 there was still
7	15 million smokers -- in fact, that poll actually
8	states the number, not just the percentages, correct?
9	Correct? Is that correct?
10	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
11	THE WITNESS: Yes. And I think what I'm
12	even more familiar with is that some of the 1989
13	Surgeon General's report which had included
14	information from a variety of earlier polls also
15	broke down some numbers. And I think that
16	may -- I may have seen it as cited to that poll
17	in the '89 report. But, yes, it does give
18	absolute numbers.
19	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. And without stating who
20	made this statement, I just want to know if you agree
21	that as late as 1981, 15,000,000 American smokers still
Page 125
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
22	did not believe smoking caused lung cancer?
23	A Again, that sounds like it's approximately
24	accurate.
25	Q And do you agree that filters were being
147
1	advertised as a safer cigarette since the 1950s?
2	A I couldn't agree to that in quite such
3	broad terms.
4	Q Okay. So you, you -- if somebody stated
5	filters were being advertised as a safer cigarette
6	since the 1950s, you would disagree with that person?
7	A No. I'm not saying that either. I think
8	that there were some advertisements which suggested
9	that it was better to use one cigarette than another
10	and then there was later on a whole series of issues.
11	I don't think that that was certainly the only way
12	filters were advertised nor do I think that was the
13	way they were -- only way they were understood. It's
14	just that that's an overly broad generalization for
15	me to agree to all of it.
16	MR. WALKER: Gary, I need to object. I
17	think it's -- if you want to ask Dr. Ford
18	whether he agrees with a particular proposition,
19	I don't have a problem with that generally. But
20	if you're asking him about whether testimony
21	that he has given previously was accurate, I
22	think he needs to be able to see the statement
23	in context and not just the snippets that you're
24	reading.
25	MR. PAIGE: Oh, no. I would agree with
148
1	you. When we're in trial, we'll do it that way.
2	But this is a discovery depo, so I respectfully
3	disagree with you.
4	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay. So I'm going to change
5	the question with the caveat that you just mentioned,
6	though. Do you agree that one of the ways filters were
7	being advertised was as a safer cigarette since the
8	1950s?
9	A Again, I think the caveat I entered earlier
10	is what I would want to stick with.
11	Q well, that's -- I think you said one of the
12	ways, but -- so in a general statement, you disagree
13	that filters were being advertised as a safer
14	cigarette since the 1950s? You disagree with that?
15	Too general?
16	MR. walker: Objection to form. Asked and
17	answered.
18	THE WITNESS: Well, again, I think it's
19	just too broad. There were some --
20	Q (By Mr. Paige) Okay.
21	A it's too broad a generalization for me to
22	agree with it as I sit here today.
23	Q Is there a reason why you may have been
24	able to answer that before, but not today? Did
25	something change in your mind about that issue?
149
1	MR. WALKER: Objection to form. And,
2	again, if you're going to ask him about his
3	prior testimony, in fairness, he should be able
Page 127
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
4	to review what he actually said in its fullness.
5	MR. PAIGE: John, that would be absolutely
6	impossible with me sitting in Fort Lauderdale.
7	Q (By Mr. Paige) So I just want to know if you
8	made a statement like that and is there something that
9	happened between today and the last year that made you
10	change that opinion.
11	MR. WALKER: Same objection.
12	THE WITNESS: I don't think anything has
13	happened to make me change that opinion. I'm
14	sure I gave an answer as the best answer I could
15	give and a truthful answer at the time. I do
16	think it's a complicated, it's a complicated
17	story about, about filters, so that's all I'm
18	trying to indicate.
19	Q (By Mr. Paige) Do you know that -- do you
20	agree with this statement: As late as the nineteen --
21	as late as 1970, 58 percent of smokers thought that
22	filters reduced the adverse health effects of smoking?
23	A I don't remember seeing that precise
24	figure. And I remember that was a figure that
25	bounced around some as I've seen figures. But I have
150
1	seen information to that effect.
2	Q Okay. So do you agree that as late as
3	1970, approximately 58 percent of smokers thought
4	filters reduced the adverse effects of smoking?
5	A As I've said, I can't remember that exact,
6	exact figure.
7	Q Right. That's why I'm asking
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
8	approximately. Do you have a problem with that now?
9	A it's not a matter that I have a problem one
10	way or the other, other than I just can't remember
11	the numbers from that particular year as I sit here
12	today.
13	Q Okay, if the polls stated that and you
14	gave that testimony in Sherman's file, you would not
15	disagree with it today, would you?
16	MR. WALKER: Same objection as previous.
17	MS. BROWN: Object to form.
18	THE WITNESS: I wouldn't -- I don't know of
19	anything in my Sherman trial testimony that I
20	wouldn't still give as testimony that related to
21	the Sherman case as opposed to the Cohen case.
22	Q (By Mr. Paige) Are you aware that large
23	proportions of smokers have indicated a desire that
24	they not smoke or wish they weren't smokers at all?
25	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
151
1	THE WITNESS: Yes. I have seen that
2	information.
3	Q (By Mr. Paige) And do you agree that it's
4	been reported that nicotine is as addictive as cocaine
5	and heroin?
6	A I have seen those reports as well as
7	reports disputing that, but I have seen that. Yes.
8	Q Have you seen a report that smoking is not
9	as addictive as cocaine and heroin?
10	A well, just that that comparison -- I think
11	there has been criticism of that comparison.
12	Q Well, the Surgeon General of the United
Page 129
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
13	States said that nicotine is as addictive as cocaine
14	and heroin, correct?
15	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
16	THE WITNESS: That is correct.
17	Q (By Mr. Paige) Is that correct?
18	A Yes.
19	Q All right, who said it was not? who said
20	it was not? The tobacco companies?
21	A Well, I'm not talking about the tobacco
22	companies, but -- I couldn't pinpoint a single
23	individual, but I think that is -- well, that was a
24	comparison that the Surgeon General made in trying to
25	communicate to the public the habit-forming nature of
152
1	nicotine. Yes.
2	Q Well, not the habit-forming, but the
3	addictive nature of nicotine, correct? Correct?
4	A That's what the Surgeon General said. Yes.
5	Q And the, the, the people who criticized
6	that statement by the Surgeon General were the
7	tobacco companies, correct?
8	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
9	THE WITNESS: I think I have seen company
10	criticism of that statement. Yes.
11	Q (By Mr. Paige) And was -- other than the
12	tobacco companies, was there anybody else that you're
13	aware of who criticized the 1988 Surgeon General report
14	or disagreed with it that you can tell me who they are?
15	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
16	THE WITNESS: Off the top of my head, I
depo of Lacy Ford 1 06 10 Cohen case
17	can't cite anybody.
18	Q (By Mr. Paige) And, in fact, the tobacco
19	companies six years after that report went to Congress
20	and said that they didn't believe nicotine was
21	addictive, correct?
22	A Yes.
23	Q And then six years later, because of
24	litigation, they were forced to admit that was not
25	so, correct?
153
1	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
2	THE WITNESS: I know that approximately six
3	years later they admitted it. Yes.
4	Q (By Mr. Paige) Do you know why they were -5	why they admitted it?
6	A I know that it was in the context of
7	litigation, but I don't know anything beyond that.
8	Q And the same would be true about their
9	admission of cigarettes causing lung cancer?
10	A That is correct; yes.
11	Q And the -- you're aware that the Surgeon
12	General made the statement that smoking is not a
13	matter of free choice, correct?
14	MR. WALKER: Objection to form.
15	THE WITNESS: I know that the Surgeon
16	General has made statements to that effect.
17	Yes.
18	MR. PAIGE: All right. That's all I have.
19	THE WITNESS: Thank you.
20	MR. PAIGE: I'm done.
21	MR. WALKER: Thanks, Gary.
