13 BY MR. FEIWUS:
14
Q.
Good morning.
My name is Len Feiwus, as you
15 know, Professor, and I represent the defense, defendant
16 Liggett in this case.
17
Could you state your full name for the
18 record, please?
19 A. My name is Dr. Thomas Victor DiBacco.
20 Q. Are you currently employed, sir?
21 A. No, sir, I'm retired.
22 Q. And before you retired, sir, where were you
23 employed?
24
A.
At the American University in Washington,
25 D.C.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083513
1
Q.
And how long were you affiliated with the
2 American University in Washington, D.C.?
3 A. Thirty-three years, from 1965 to 1998.
4 Q. And what position or positions did you hold
5 at the American University?
6
A.
I was a full professor, having progressed
7 from an assistant professor to an associate professor
8 to a full professor.
9
Q.
And what was the broad area of the subject
10 matter of what you were -- the research and the work
11 you engaged in?
12 A. United States history.
13 Q. And how is it that you came to be interested
14 in United States history?
15
A.
16 Valley.
17 mines.
I grew up in a mining town in the Ohio
And all the boys who became men worked in the
I was the baby in a family of four, and I was
18 the only one that was really interested in school.
I
19 had two elementary school teachers, Ms. Mazock and a
20 Ms. Neptune, who just brought history to life for me.
21 And I thought it was the most wonderful thing so I
22 determined when I was a kid that I was going to be a
23 history professor.
24
Unfortunately, my mother one day when I just
25 had recovered from whooping cough said, Enough of this.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083514
1 We're going to Florida, Sarasota, Florida, where she
2 had a daughter.
3
So at age 13 I went to Florida, Sarasota
4 High School.
I found that I had gone to heaven.
It
5 was just a veritable, wonderful area for me to study
6 history.
I had two wonderful teachers again who said,
7 Tommy, you can do this.
8 Deal.
Dr. Jean Marani and Mrs. Mary
And so I studied hard and I went on to college
9 after that.
10
Q.
Could you tell the jury a little bit about
11 your educational background post high school, please?
12
A.
Yes, sir.

19 right afterwards.
We married
And then we went on to American
20 University in Washington where I was going to be a
21 professor.
I started my work there.
22 1962 in American history.
I got my MA in
I got my Ph.D. in 1965 in
23 American history and began teaching soon afterwards.
24
Q.
Could you describe for the jury if there was
25 a specific area of specialization in American history
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083515
1 that you focused on?
2
A.
I focused on a field that I helped to
3 develop.
It's called American social history.
And
4 that's the field of the average individual in everyday
5 life.
I had found as I was a college student that most
6 of the courses were relegated to Presidents and
7 Congresses and to politics.
And I think that students
8 had had enough of that, and I wanted to emphasize the
9 individual.
So I developed this course that
10 essentially dealt with American history from the
11 beginning to the present but with an emphasis on
12 everyday life.
13
Q.
And when approximately was that that you
14 developed that course in American social history?
15
A.
I started to teach it in 1965.
16 two-semester course.
17 to the Civil War.
It was a
It first ran from colonial times
18 War to the present.
Then the second ran from the Civil
And I taught that course at the
19 American University for a number of years.
20
Q.
Was a course in American social history
21 something that was common in 1965 at various
22 universities around the country?
23
A.
No, it was not.
It was probably the least
24 respected, but I must say today that more doctoral
25 dissertations are written in social history in America
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083516
1 than any other field.
2
So it was a new field, and I was just
3 delighted to be present at the creation.
4
Q.
Could you describe some of the
5 responsibilities that you had during the 30 plus years
6 that you were working at the American University as a
7 professor?
8
A.
Well, first of all, I had to gain tenure.
9 In other words, you're not going to be a professor
10 unless you can stay at a university for as long as you
11 want.
And so I had to write scholarly articles.
12 to develop courses.
I had
I had to teach the United States
13 history survey in addition to the United States social
14 history.
I was expected to speak not only to students,
15 but to community groups in terms of what we were doing
16 with regard to history.
And I also wrote.
I began my
17 career in writing with regard to developing this field.
18
Q.
19 sir.
So let's talk about some of your writing,
Have you published over the course of your career
20 in professional journals?
21 A. I have.
22 Q. And the jury has heard the term "peer
23 review."
Could you describe for us what a
24 peer-reviewed journal is?
25
A.
A peer-reviewed journal is a journal by
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083517
1 other professors who usually are more advanced than you
2 are and who are specialists in the field.
3 the field.
4
Q.
They know
And I did publish in peer-review journals.
And could you give us some examples of some
5 articles that you published in.
6
A.
My first article was in a Harvard
7 publication called the Business History Review.
And
8 I'll never forget it because the editor sent me a
9 letter back after I had submitted it and they said,
10 This is a great article, but it's too short.
And I
11 said, in a three-page return letter, that that was
12 sufficient, it told the story.
13
So they published it.
I published in the Journal of Politics,
14 which was a University of Notre Dame publication; in
15 Journalism Quarterly, which was a University of
16 Minnesota publication; the New England Journal of
17 History; the Journal of the American Historical
18 Association; the Organization of American Historical
19 Magazine and many others.
20
Q.
Beyond the publications in professional
21 journals, did you publish in any other forms or media?
22
A.
I wanted to do what Ken Burns and the
23 History Channel are doing today; I wanted to get the
24 message out to people about American history and social
25 history in particular.
And I did it through
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083518
1 newspapers, because I felt that the one great thing
2 about this developing field is that people did love
3 history if you presented them a good and clear and
4 concise history.
5
So I ran articles in newspapers.
Long
6 before there were computers I used to send my pieces
7 in, mail them into the newspaper with a self-addressed
8 envelope in case they rejected it.
And I tell you how
9 thrilled I was when I started to get acceptances and
10 having these published.
11
Q.
And the newspaper articles that you
12 published were also on the subject matter of American
13 social history.
14
A.
Much of it was.
In fact, I did a column,
15 eventually, on things in the home.
I did a column for
16 the Washington Post, a history of things in the home.
17 And they were so clever in coming up with good titles.
18 I did one on toilets and they highlighted it "Tanks For
19 the Memories."
I did one on linoleum.
I did articles
20 with regard to lamps and blankets and all of these
21 things that we take for granted today.
22
I did a column for the Washington Post
23 medical segment, which was done every Tuesday, which
24 was on the history of medicine.
25
So I did all of these in a way to educate
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083519
1 the public that history was more than simply politics.
2 And I did one other thing; I had each of my students
3 write a history of their families.
And some of them
4 were so moving and so good that I asked their
5 permission to put them in articles that I would write
6 and get them published as well.
7
Q.
Did you publish any works on American social
8 history in popular books?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. Could you describe them for the jury,
11 please?
12
A.
Yes.
My first book was a book entitled
13 "Jeremiah Moore and Moorefield."
And it was a book
14 that was devoted to an average Baptist person.
15 a Baptist minister.
16 layman.
He was
He was first just a Baptist
And the Fairfax County Historical Commission
17 asked me to write this because they were trying to get
18 his home, which was built in the late 18th century and
19 which was still in existence, to get this home
20 maintained in its original shape.
21 it, and I wrote this book.
22 every day.
And I offered to do
It deals with what he did
He was in jail sometimes for preaching
23 gospel that the Anglican church or the Episcopal
24 church, as it's called today, didn't like.
25
But I began this program with this little
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083520
1 book, and it became a standard reference book used in
2 libraries throughout the country as a model of how you
3 deal with average people.
4 Q. So is this book still in print today?
5 A. It's still in print.
You can buy it -- if
6 you do a little search on Amazon and Google and all
7 this you can get usually second-edition copies.
8
Q.
So just succinctly, Professor DiBacco, how
9 is this history book different from other history books
10 that were published at this time and before this time
11 in 1971?
12
A.
Well, because it stresses the everyday
13 average American.
It's not a thesis on Thomas
14 Jefferson or George Washington or individuals who are
15 well-known.
This is the heart of America.
The heart
16 of this great country is the individual and all of them
17 combined.
18 Q. Did you publish any other books?
19 A. The dream of my life was to do a textbook.
20 And I was asked to do a textbook on United States
21 history in 1992.
And I did such a textbook called
22 "History of the United States."
23
I also did two other books.
I did a book
24 entitled "Presidential Power in Latin American
25 Politics," which seems a little bit out of the sort but
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083521
1 I extended my vision to Latin America.
2
And then I did a book for the general public
3 entitled "Made in the USA:
The History of American
4 Business," which was designed to talk about the
5 inventive ingenuity of individuals throughout our
6 history.
7
Q.
You brought a copy of your textbook when you
8 came here today, and I have a copy of it.
9
MR. FEIWUS:
10 THE COURT:
11 THE WITNESS:
May I approach, Your Honor?
Yes.
Thank you.
12 BY MR. FEIWUS:
13
Q.
Professor DiBacco, this is the textbook that
14 you were describing in your testimony.
15 A. This is the textbook.
16 Q. So can you describe for the jury a little
17 bit about how this textbook came about and how it is --
18 well, we'll start with that.
19
A.
One of my articles in the Christian Science
20 Monitor was read by an editor at Houghton Mifflin,
21 which is a large publishing company in Boston.
And he
22 was fascinated because it dealt with everyday history.
23 And he called me up and he said, Would you be
24 interested in writing as the lead co-author a textbook
25 in American history that's different with the social
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083522
1 history which you advance?
2 And I said, Absolutely.
3 I wanted to do this.
4 contract.
And so I got a
We found two other individuals who were
5 willing to write part of it.
And we began the great
6 search to write a different type of history.
7 Q. And where is this textbook typically used?
8 A. It's used anywhere from 8th grade to the
9 12th grade.
And sometimes it's used -- in Miami-Dade,
10 for example, in Florida, it was used as a remedial
11 text.
In Broward County, just to the north, it was
12 used as an advanced placement text.
So I always think
13 that it's a text for all people.
14
Q.
When did you initially publish this
15 textbook?
16 A. 1992 was the first publication.
17 Q. And is it still in use today?
18 A. It's still in use today.
It's not sold as
19 much today in large part because textbooks are usually
20 changed by jurisdictions about every seven or eight
21 years.
And I chose not to update it because one of my
22 co-authors died.
And she was a wonderful lady, Lorna
23 Mason, and I didn't want to find another one.
I
24 couldn't find another one to replace her quality.
25
Q.
So I think you brought with you some slides
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083523
1 today that are going to assist the jury in going
2 through some of the testimony that you prepared.
And I
3 think you have a slide on some preface parts of your
4 textbook.
And I'd like to put it up here.
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. So what is the significance of this part of
7 the textbook --
8
A.
The significance of this part is to provide
9 to the student how this textbook is going to be
10 different from all of the other courses they've had in
11 American history prior to the 8th grade or the 10th
12 grade or whenever they take it.
13
And the three of us, the three authors
14 worked together to stress that this is a text that's
15 designed to provide to young people who are going to
16 live most of their lives in the 21st century why we are
17 the way we are today.
It's not about collecting old
18 piece of historic memorabilia.
19 topics.
It's about these
And in particular I underlined that I wanted
20 to show individuals' ideas, religion, geography,
21 technology, economics, how all of these have interacted
22 to help shape our national character in our nation.
23
Q.
Professor DiBacco, is the subject of tobacco
24 and cigarettes and cigarette smoking something --
25 within the United States, is that something that falls
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083524
1 within the subject of your area of expertise --
2
A.
Yes, tobacco and its place in American
3 history goes back to earliest times.
My first person
4 here, Jeremiah Moore, was paid in part in tobacco.
5 Virginia was a big tobacco state.
So it does play a
6 part.
7
I have references to the role of tobacco and
8 cigarettes in my textbook.
9
I have done a film for the University of
10 Notre Dame, which they asked me to do, in terms of
11 dealing with cigarettes, their health risks.
12
I've also written articles for newspapers
13 that have dealt with the subject of cigarettes and
14 tobacco in general.
15
Q.
Professor DiBacco, did there come a time in
16 your research activities when you started to focus
17 particular on the issues concerning cigarette smoking
18 and health in the United States?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. And when was that, sir?
21 A. I had done an article for USA Today.
I had
22 been asked by one of the editors there to do an article
23 because the Food and Drug Administration in July of
24 1995 was contemplating establishing more regulations
25 for cigarettes, and they asked me to do an article
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083525
1 tracing the history of regulation and my view of
2 whether or not we needed more regulation.
3
And I got a call after that appeared in this
4 newspaper from an attorney representing the cigarette
5 companies who asked if I might be interested in doing
6 research with respect to, of course, this topic on a
7 broader level.
8
Q.
Just so the record -- you don't need to
9 reveal the identity of the attorney, but for the
10 record, was that an attorney that was working for the
11 Liggett Tobacco Company?
12 A. No, it was not.
13 Q. And what year was that approximately that
14 you were contacted?
15
A.
It was 1995.
Shortly after that article I
16 was in Florida at the time, in that summer period,
17 working on a revision with respect to my textbook and
18 it was in July, August, September, sometime in that
19 area.
20
Q.
And the initial request, as I understand
21 from your testimony, from the attorney was that they
22 wanted you to do research for them on the issues of
23 cigarette smoking.
24
A.
They wanted me to do research to expand my
25 boundaries that I had ordinarily used in the other
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083526
1 articles that I published so that I might cover more
2 areas relating to information that was publicly
3 available regarding the health risks of smoking
4 throughout the country.
5
Q.
So what kind of research in particular did
6 you conduct at the request of this attorney?
7
A.
Well, I dealt with issues relating to
8 newspapers, magazines, movies, textbooks, films,
9 government documents, publications of American Cancer
10 Society, the American Lung Association, all of these
11 and whatever was publicly disseminated for use by the
12 people regarding the health risks of smoking.
13
Q.
And so in 1995 when you were retained to do
14 this, this was in the form of a grant or a consulting
15 agreement, what was the arrangement that you had for
16 the work that you performed?
17
A.
It was consulting.
18 hired by them.
In other words, I wasn't
I did consulting.
It was on an hourly
19 basis.
20
Q.
And how long did you -- how long did your
21 work as a consultant on the research areas that you
22 just described, how long did it proceed for?
23 A. Five years.
24 Q. And then at some point in time did the
25 nature of the work that you were doing in your
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083527
1 consultancy, did it change its focus?
2
A.
Yes.
It changed from research to appearance
3 in trial, such as this one, in which I would render my
4 evidence and my opinion relative to the health risks of
5 smoking and their public availability.
6
Q.
And so since it's, I guess, about the year
7 2000 that you've been doing that work?
8 A. The year 2000 was my first case.
9 Q. You've testified in court before a jury; is
10 that right?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Approximately how many times have you
13 testified in court on issues regarding cigarette
14 smoking and health and tobacco?
15
A.
This is my 8th case.
So eight times.
This
16 is the 8th case.
17
Q.
Now, in addition to working as a consultant
18 for this attorney or for tobacco companies, have you
19 worked as a consultant in other areas of historical
20 research?
21 A. Oh, yes.
22 Q. And in those consultancy agreements, the
23 consultancy relationships that you've had, have you
24 been paid for the time that you work?
25
A.
I have been paid.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083528
1
Q.
And were you paid also in connection with
2 the time that you spent working as a consultant on
3 these tobacco and cigarette and smoking issues?
4 A. Yes, sir, I have.
5 Q. And are you being paid in connection with
6 the work that you did in this case?
7 A. Yes, sir.
8 Q. And could you tell us what rates do you
9 charge for the work that you do?
10
A.
11 research.
I charge $75 an hour for any time I do
And I charge $125 an hour every time I
12 appear in a deposition or in a trial.
13
Q.
Approximately how much time have you spent
14 working in connection with this particular case?
15
A.
I would guesstimate, Mr. Feiwus, up to
16 couple days ago about 100 hours.
17
Q.
With respect to the seven trials prior to
18 this one that you did work on, you know, how much time
19 did you spend on each of those trials approximately?
20
A.
About the same except for the first one,
21 which was very different.
22 Q. You spent more time on the first one?
23 A. Absolutely.
24 Q. And why was that?
25 A. Because it involved many plaintiffs.

1
Q.
Now, professor, what I'd like to do is talk
2 a little bit about your methodology.
3 have a slide on this.
And I think you
Is there a generally accepted
4 methodology for doing historical research?
5 A. It is -- there is.
6 Q. What is that called?
7 A. It's called the historical method.
8 Q. Can you describe for the jury what exactly
9 is the historical method?
10
A.
Well, first of all, you have to start with a
11 particular question.
What are you going to research?
12 With respect to the issues relating to cigarettes and
13 health information and risks, the question is:
To what
14 extent was information relating to the health risks of
15 smoking, disease, death, addiction, habituation, the
16 difficulty that some people have in quitting, to what
17 extent was this publicly available?
That's the
18 question.
19
Then the second step is you have to have as
20 wide a set of sources to investigate that.
You can't
21 rely upon one newspaper or one magazine or one book.
22 You have to deal with as many aspects of the
23 information environment as possible.
24
You also have to recognize -- and the third
25 area -- that there are some sources that are biased.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083530
1 When I did my book on Jeremiah Moore there were all of
2 his relatives, his decendents living in North Carolina.
3 And they give me all sorts of information, some of
4 which was a lot of puff.
5 So it was biased.
6
I couldn't substantiate it.
They really loved that man.
And then you want to avoid what is called
7 present-minded analysis.
That's taking your values in
8 your lifetime today and trying to transpose them on the
9 era on which you are looking at.
The best example I
10 have of that is my father, who was an Italian
11 immigrant, he came to this country in 1912.
12 a miner.
He became
And when we were young kids, the four of us,
13 we would sit around the dinner table and my dad used
14 to -- he used to brag about how much money he made at
15 the mines.
And he said he made big money, $10 a week.
16 And, of course, the four of us kids would roll our eyes
17 around and say...
18
But when I became a historian I went back to
19 the time in which he was a miner and that was a good
20 wage.
So you don't want to transpose your values on
21 that of another era.
22
Q.
Okay.
Sir, did you utilize the historical
23 method in connection with the research that you did for
24 this case?
25
A.
I did, sir.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083531
1
Q.
And were you asked a question -- start with
2 historical question.
Were you asked a question in
3 connection with the work that you did for this case?
4 A. Yes, sir.
5 Q. And what was that question?
6 A. The question was:
To what extent was
7 information relating to the health risks of smoking,
8 including the risk of disease and death and addiction,
9 habituation and the difficulty that some individuals
10 have in quitting, to what extent was this publicly
11 available?
And to what extent shortly before and
12 during the lifetime of Ms. Westmoreland was this
13 publicly available and was she exposed to it?
14
15
That was the question.
Q.
And just so the record is clear.
Do you
16 have any particular information about
17 Ms. Westmoreland's -- her own knowledge of the risks of
18 cigarette smoking?
19 A. No.
20 Q. Do you have any particular information about
21 any specific documents or newspaper articles or things
22 that she may have seen in the press?
23 A. No.
I have no way to judge that.
24 Q. And do you have any particular information
25 about Ms. Westmoreland's own personal beliefs about
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083532
1 smoking or anything else?
2 A. No, I have no way to judge that.
3 Q. So when you say you looked at the time frame
4 of -- you know, you looked at information that was
5 publicly available in the time frame leading up to and
6 during Ms. Westmoreland's lifetime, why is that
7 relevant for purposes of your analysis?
8
A.
Well, it's relevant with respect to
9 determining how much and to what extent there was this
10 information environment. We live, Mr. Feiwus, in an
11 information environment. We have all these sources,
12 far more today than we did 10 years ago, that provide
13 us with information.
And to what extent did this
14 information environment provide that sort of
15 information regarding the health risks of smoking?
16
Q.
Did you provide us with a slide to help
17 explain to the jury what you mean by information
18 environment?
19 A. Yes, sir, I have.
20 Q. So what is an information environment and
21 could you help describe -- describe to the jury what
22 exactly you mean by it?
23
A.
These are the sources from which we get
24 information.
It may be information relating, of
25 course, to health risks.
It may be information related
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083533
1 to other topics, but for health risks we get
2 information from, first of all, common sense and our
3 personal observations.
4
In the 19th century when we did not have a
5 good medical society, people observed that cigarettes,
6 tobacco were bad for people because people seemed to
7 die much earlier, or they got certain maladies, coughs,
8 et cetera.
Personal observation.
That's an important
9 factor.
10
Family and friends.
11 family and friends.
We get information from
How many times have our mothers
12 and fathers told us, don't do this because it's bad.
13 That's very critical.
They play a large part in our
14 lives.
15
School.
School indoctrinates us with
16 respect to all sorts of information in terms of what is
17 good and bad health-wise.
18
Religion.
There are many religions that
19 impose all sorts of admonitions about taking into your
20 body anything that would defile a body made in the
21 likeness of God.
22
Newspapers.
Newspapers are the, I think,
23 the most democratic aspect of disseminating information
24 because throughout much of our history they were very
25 cheap.
And they would report on all sorts of materials
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083534
1 relating to health risks.
2
Magazines.
They too are important, although
3 they're not published as much today, but they were
4 important in the early 20th century.
5
Of course, physicians and scientists.
6 we go to the doctor.
When
When we read reports in terms of
7 newspapers about scientists who do research, we find
8 that out.
9
Pop culture.
Over a period of time there
10 have been all sorts of slang terms that have been
11 devised in reference to the bad effects of cigarettes.
12 One of the first was coffin nails, which originated in
13 the 1880s, suggesting that every cigarette you smoke
14 was a coffin -- a nail in your coffin.
There would be
15 terms regarding the habituation, addictive nature of
16 nicotine such as nicotine addict, nicotine fiend.
Pop
17 culture.
18
Radio and television.
How much this is
19 information disseminated to us about health risks and
20 smoking.
21
Movies.
Movies glamorized cigarettes, no
22 doubt about it, but they also provide movies which
23 suggests that they're bad for you.
24
Books.
25 write books.
Doctors write books.
Lay people write books.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-3408
Psychiatrists
And they contain3535
1 information based upon the health risks of smoking.
2
Then there are public and private
3 organizations such as the American Cancer Society,
4 which is the oldest of all of the health groups
5 established in 1912, designed to disseminate
6 information about the health risks of smoking.
There's
7 the American Lung Association, the American Heart
8 Association, Lymphoma and Leukemia Foundation.
It goes
9 on and on and on.
10
Government is finally the last one.
11 Particularly since the establishment of government in

13 back.
14 1870s.
And they go way
The first Surgeon General was appointed in the
But they disseminate information.
And they
15 started big time to do it in the 1950s and '60s about
16 the health risks of smoking.
17
Q.
So, Professor DiBacco, in order to answer
18 the question that you -- the research question that you
19 were asked in this case and to look into the
20 information environment on cigarettes and smoking
21 during the lifetime of Ms. Westmoreland, you endeavored
22 to research these various channels of information that
23 created the information environment?
24 A. That is correct.
25 Q. And what exactly did you do, for example, to
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083536
1 research some of these things, newspapers and movies
2 and school and all those different topics?
3
A.
I went to various repositories or what I
4 call libraries, institutions where these documents and
5 these particular areas are included.
And I prepared a
6 list for you, a partial list in terms of where
7 information regarding these books and pamphlets,
8 television, radio scripts all of these things are
9 included.
10
And, of course, the primary one is the fifth
11 one down from the top on the left-hand side the Library
12 of Congress.
I taught for many years at American
13 University in Washington.
The Library of Congress is
14 the most wonderful place for a historian.
15 you know, a kid with candy.
16 better.
17 it.
It's like,
You can't find anything
And it's free, it's open and anybody can use
Anybody.
18 the world.
It's the most democratic institution in
No one can say, stop, you're not a
19 professor.
20
But there are many other great libraries.
21 And here in the state of Florida:
Florida Atlantic
22 University Library, Florida State University Library.
23 I have great reverence for the University of Florida
24 Library because there is at the University of Florida
25 Library a center called the Holing Law Center.
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-3408
And3537
1 when I was working on my degrees in the American
2 University Senator Holing (phonetics) gave me a job so
3 I could support my family my wife and I had children
4 rather quickly afterwards.
And the Senator Holing law
5 library was one in which I found additional material.
6
So there is so much that you can garner and
7 sometimes it's going to be specific to a particular
8 state such as the University of California at
9 Los Angeles.
They contain mostly California documents,
10 but others, like those in Florida, contain Florida
11 documents.
The Library of Congress contains
12 everything, everything that you can imagine is in the
13 LC.
14
Q.
Just to try and ease out one specific
15 example so the jury can understand what kind of
16 research you did.
17 A. Sure.
18 Q. As part of your research did you review
19 historical New York Times articles?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. And New York Times is a national newspaper
22 in the 1940s, '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s, right?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. And so how did you go about doing research
25 on New York Times articles that would inform your
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083538
1 research for this case?
2
A.
The Library of Congress has what is called a
3 newspaper reading room.
It's in a new building called
4 the James Madison Building.
It has every newspaper in
5 the United States of America.
6 cubicles of microfilm readers.
7 reel by reel.
And you have maybe 50
So you choose dates
And you go through those dates reel by
8 reel in these cubicles looking for articles relating to
9 the health risks of smoking.
10
Now some of you may ask:
Well, can't you do
11 that with the index to the New York Times?
And the
12 answer is no, because indexes, even if you use indexes
13 on the computer, if you go to Google, you'll find that
14 they don't include everything.
15 index didn't do it.
16 day.
And the New York Times
So you've got to go day by day by
So for five years before I ever appeared in any
17 cases I would be the master of the microfilm with
18 regard to going through this.
And I had already done
19 it before.
20
In 1972 when I got my first sabbatical at
21 American University I wanted to write a book on
22 American social history.
And I began it by going
23 through the New York Times every day for a number of
24 years.
I started with the Franklin D. Roosevelt years.
25 And my goal was to look at what was of interest to
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083539
1 people, how did they live their lives then?
2
Q.
So you also identify on here something that
3 you refer to as a personal library, what is that?
4
A.
Over the years my wife and I collected all
5 sorts of materials relating to smoking and health.
6 would go to Salvation Army, to book fairs.
We
I think I
7 bought every almanac that -- information almanac ever
8 published by going to all these used book sales.
9
I have some Horatio Alger books, which are
10 books intended in the 19th century for little kids to
11 make them successful.
We use that term Horatio Alger
12 story, you go from rags to riches.
Well, one way you
13 did it is you didn't use any tobacco, you kept yourself
14 clean.
15
Q.
So what is the Vanderbilt University
16 Television News Archive?
17
A.
This is a fascinating one that we found, my
18 wife and I, and I think other researchers, which
19 includes all of the major three channels, ABC, NBC TV,
20 CBS television programs for the nightly news. There's
21 the nightly news program either at 6 or 6:30. Walter
22 Cronkite used to be with CBS, now we have Brian
23 Williams with NBC, yada, yada.
24
They collected all of these news segments
25 and they put them in a transcript so you can also check
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083540
1 whether television.
2
PBS also has a similar type thing.
And PBS
3 has a pretty good site in Washington D.C. where I do
4 work too.
It's not included there because there were
5 too many.
6 Q. Wolfson Media?
7 A. That's a center in Miami.
8 great deal of information there.
And they have a
Louis Wolfson was a
9 person who donated money for this media center.
And
10 they include all sorts of things from PSAs to news
11 programs that are available for researchers.
12
Q.
Now, on the right-hand side, second from the
13 bottom you have something identified as Johnson Tyler
14 and Purvis.
15
A.
Could you tell the jury what that is?
This is the law firm that contacted me back
16 in 1995 when they saw my article in USA Today.
17
And this is a library that they have
18 essentially built in materials related to the health
19 risks of smoking.
20
Q.
And is that one of the sources that you
21 consulted in connection with your research?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. And just to be clear, the archive that is
24 maintained there, does that involve or include internal
25 tobacco company documents?
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083541
1 A. No.
2 Q. So what is the nature of the materials that
3 are found in that archive?
4
A.
I wasn't the only one who got calls from
5 particular -- this particular --
6 MR. SALES:
Excuse me.
7 nonresponsive.
8 THE COURT:
9 MR. FEIWUS:
Objection,
Sustained.
Sure.
10 BY MR. FEIWUS:
11
Q.
Could you just describe for the jury if it
12 doesn't involve internal tobacco company documents,
13 what types of materials are held there that you
14 research?
15
A.
Newspapers, magazines, films, textbooks,
16 television program, clips.
17
Q.
Okay.
And did you do anything to -- you
18 mentioned earlier that part of the historical method is
19 to evaluate bias in your sources.
Did you do anything
20 to evaluate whether or not that source would be -- was
21 a credible source or a biased source in any way?
22
A.
Yes, I did.
Remember that this is a law
23 firm that works for the cigarette companies.
I wanted
24 to make sure that I wasn't getting hood-winked.
I
25 wanted to make sure that they didn't sanitize this
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083542
1 list.
I have a reputation to protect.
So I would take
2 whatever they had gathered and I would check it against
3 other sources to make sure that this was accurate.
And
4 I did that at the beginning.
5
Q.
With respect to the research that you've
6 been doing since 1995 on tobacco and cigarettes and
7 smoking, has your research been limited or curtailed in
8 any way by lawyers for tobacco companies that you did
9 work for?
10 A. No.
11 Q. And with respect to the research that you've
12 done in connection with this case have you formed an
13 opinion concerning the information that was publicly
14 available in the United States during the time frame
15 that you described concerning cigarettes, smoking and
16 health?
17 A. Yes, I have.
18 Q. And what is that opinion, sir?
19 A. My opinion is that information regarding the
20 health risks of smoking, in particular the risk of
21 disease and death, addiction, habituation, the
22 difficulty that some people have in quitting was widely
23 publicized before and during the lifetime of
24 Ms. Westmoreland and she was exposed to it.
25
Q.
And, sir, you hold that opinion to a
www.phippsreporting.com
888 811-34083543
1 reasonable degree of professional certainty?
2
3
4
A.
I do.
MR. FEIWUS:
Your Honor, after -- I think
this is a good time to break.
5 THE COURT:
Well, I agree.
6 Ladies and gentlemen I'm going to take a
7 chance on not needing as long as I said and just
8 figuring it's about 12:12 now.
9 1:30.
Let's resume at
We'll try to be ready for you then.
10 We'll recess until then.
11 (Jury exited the courtroom at 12:12 p.m.)
12 THE COURT:
Professor, you know you're not
13 to discuss your testimony with counsel during
14 this break.
You're still on the stand.
15 THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. SALES:
Oh, it's quite simple.
They

13 I think Your Honor was still in the courtroom --
14 THE COURT:
Password, yes, where the guy
15 responds "cancer."
16 MR. SALES:
Yes.
And I know I don't have it
17 in my hands.
I know from memory that that's
18 immediately followed up upon by the people on
19 the show with something like, "Don't get us in
20 trouble," meaning that, I believe, if we can see
21 the whole -- the next two or three seconds,
22 there will be a reflection that it is a matter
23 of controversy, because the suggestion's being
24 made, oh, everybody knew cigarettes caused
25 cancer.

THOMAS V. DIBACCO, Ph.D.
3 Being previously duly sworn to tell the whole truth
4 testified as follows:
5
RESUMED DIRECT EXAMINATION
6 BY MR. FEIWUS:
7
Q.
Good afternoon.
8 Dr. DiBacco.
Good afternoon,
When we -- right before the break I think
9 you -- you provided for us what your opinion was in
10 this case.
11
What I'd like to do is just have you
12 reiterate it, remind the jury, and then we can go about
13 talking about what you did to evaluate the evidence and
14 come up with the opinion that you have.
15
16
So what was the opinion again that you said?
A.
My opinion is that information relating to
17 the health risks of smoking, including the risk of
18 disease and death, habituation and addiction and the
19 difficulty that some individuals have in quitting, were
20 widely publicized before and during the lifetime of
21 Ms. Westmoreland, and she was exposed to that
22 information.
23
Q.
So, Professor DiBacco, as a way of
24 background, could you please describe for the jury what
25 the nature was, the quality was of the public
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083556
1 information concerning the health risks of cigarette
2 smoking at around the turn of the 20th century, about.
3
A.
Well, there were, I think, three important
4 developments with respect to the health risks of
5 smoking prior to the 20th century.
6
The first development was that doctors
7 identified what was called tobacco heart.
That is a
8 term -- if you look in the dictionary today, you'll
9 find it -- which references the fact that if you use
10 tobacco, cigarettes in particular, the vessels to the
11 heart are constricted.
It restricts the flow of blood
12 and it causes heart problems.
13
The second ailment that doctors honed in on
14 with respect to disease was Buerger's disease, and
15 that's spelled B-u-e-r-g-e-r-s.
And that's a disease,
16 if you use cigarettes, which can affect your
17 extremities.
In other words, you lose feeling in your
18 extremities, the hands and the feet.
If you quit
19 smoking, the symptoms are relieved.
20
21 amblyopia.
And the third ailment was what we call
That's an ailment with respect to smoking
22 and the eyes.
23 the like.
It creates problems with the eyes and
Physicians really looked at those areas and
24 were pretty much agreed upon the adverse effects.
25
The public had additional views, and they
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083557
1 were very much concerned about the effect of cigarette
2 use by children, and they attempted through such
3 organizations as the anti-tobacco league, the
4 Anti-Cigarette League, the Women's Christian Temperance
5 Union to restrict, if not ban, the sale of cigarettes
6 altogether, not only to youngsters, but to everybody.
7
And there was an attempt in Congress to pass
8 a federal law, but the Senate Committee on Epidemic
9 Diseases in 1892 said, We don't have any jurisdiction.
10 This is the States' responsibility.
11
Q.
And I think this was one of the issues that
12 was covered in your textbook.
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. And you have a slide on that.
15 A. I do.
16 Q. So this is from the section of your textbook
17 regarding what, Doctor?
18
A.
19 Movement.
This is the section of the Progressive
This is a movement in the early 20th century
20 that is usually referred to as the Progressive Movement
21 that was designed to eliminate issues that were adverse
22 to one's morals as well as to one's health.
23
Now, the moral issue was very high with the
24 progressives, but there were other groups that stressed
25 the health issues.
And by 1913, 16 states had banned
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083558
1 the sale of cigarettes completely.
2
Q.
During this time period, the early part of
3 the 20th century, the 1910s, the 1920s, did you find
4 evidence of an association between cigarettes and
5 disease in the popular press?
6
A.
Yes.
We found information about all of
7 these areas that I mentioned in terms of amblyopia and
8 tobacco heart, as well as, of course, Buerger's
9 disease.
10
But you also got the concern that was
11 evident in the popular press that people seemed to live
12 shorter lives if they used tobacco products.
And there
13 were a lot of popular slogans used, such as "coffin
14 nails," to illustrate that.
15
Q.
Was there also an association that you found
16 in the press in the early 1920s about the habituation
17 risks or the addictive risks of tobacco or cigarettes
18 or nicotine?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Could you describe that for the jury.
21 A. Yes.
There was a great deal of emphasis in
22 popular slogans that the press used, such as "nicotine
23 fit" and "nicotine addict," "nicotine fiend,"
24 f-i-e-n-d, to describe the inability of people to stop
25 smoking readily.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083559
1
Q.
And in your opinion, Professor DiBacco, did
2 those terms make their way into common parlance in the
3 early 1920s?
4
A.
They made their way not only into common
5 parlance in the early 20th century, but they would
6 continue throughout much of the 20th century.
7
Q.
You mentioned by 1913 [sic], 13 [sic] states
8 had banned the sale of cigarettes.
What happened with
9 respect to -- were there additional states that also
10 considered banning the sale of cigarettes?
11 A. Yes, and I made a slide on that, Mr. Feiwus.
12 Q. So this slide is entitled "Prohibition of
13 Cigarettes from 1892 to 1930, Which States Considered
14 or Passed Prohibition Laws."
15
And for the record, this relates to Liggett
16 Exhibit 3591.
17
So could you please describe for the jury,
18 what is the relevance of the slide?
19
A.
Well, 16 states by 1930 had passed laws
20 prohibiting the sale of cigarettes in their state, and
21 one of these states was Florida.
It passed it in 1899.
22 And this was a reflection of the fact that in the
23 popular parlance cigarettes were bad for you.
24 weren't good.
They
And in addition to 16 states passing the
25 prohibition laws, virtually all others, 38, considered
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083560
1 passing such laws.
They didn't do so, but at least
2 they considered it.
3
Q.
And during this time period, Professor
4 DiBacco, I think you mentioned, did the U.S. Congress
5 also consider a ban or prohibition on cigarette use in
6 the United States?
7
A.
They did, and they felt that in this time
8 period they did not have the power to do that, that
9 this was a State function.
10
Q.
What ultimately happened to -- with respect
11 to the 16 states that did pass prohibition laws such as
12 the State of Florida?
13
A.
They repealed them because, like prohibition
14 of alcohol, it simply was too hard to enforce.
So they
15 repealed these laws beginning in the 1920s and '30s.
16
Q.
And was there anything -- any kind of
17 regulation that entered into the fray after the
18 prohibition laws regarding cigarette use or tobacco
19 use?
20
A.
Yes.
In virtually every state of the Union,
21 legislatures passed laws mandating that schools had to
22 teach about the bad effects of cigarettes from the
23 earliest times, first grade all the way up through high
24 school.
And these requirements were designed to do
25 everything possible to prevent young people from taking
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083561
1 up cigarettes.
2
Q.
Okay.
Professor DiBacco, I think you have
3 provided us with an example of one of these elementary
4 school textbooks from 1931.
5 of "Health by Doing."
6
It is a book by the name
And it is Liggett Exhibit 3175.
Could you tell the jury about what that book
7 is and how it was used.
8 A. Can we put it up on the --
9 Q. We first have to have a little bit of
10 testimony about it.
11
A.
Okay.
This is a book that is designed
12 primarily for elementary school teacher -- students.
13 And what the book essentially does is to tell you why
14 cigarettes aren't any good for you.
15
Now, there's always, in these textbooks, the
16 recognition that if you grow older and you use
17 cigarettes they may not hurt you, but for a youngster
18 to take them up, they have an adverse effect upon many
19 parts of the body.
And this is the substance of this
20 particular book, as well as others.
21
Q.
The book that you brought as an example from
22 1931, was that -- do you have any evidence of whether
23 it was approved or used in any particular
24 jurisdictions?
25
A.
No.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083562
1 Q. Well, do you know about its approval?
2 A. It has been approved.
It was a -- one of
3 the leading textbooks of the time.
As to which states
4 it would be approved in, that would have to be on a
5 state-by-state basis, and those records are very hard
6 to ascertain.
7 MR. SALES:
No objection, Your Honor.
8 MR. FEIWUS:
9 MR. SALES:
You --
No objection to the entirety
10 of -- if you're working on "Health by Doing," no
11 objection.
12
MR. FEIWUS:
Okay.
13 BY MR. FEIWUS:
14
Q.
So we're going to now pull up a slide.
I'm
15 just going to show DFL7A, which is pages 232 and 233 of
16 a 1935 version of the approved elementary school
17 textbook.
And could you first tell us about the
18 authors of this textbook.
19
A.
Yes.
Drs. Burkard and Chambers are Ph.D.s.
20 They are professors.
Dr. Maroney, who is the third
21 co-author, is a physician.
22
He has an M.D.
In virtually all of these textbooks that are
23 provided to young schoolchildren, they are written by
24 at least one medical doctor.
25 "Tobacco does no one any good.
And here, as we read it,
It does some people a
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083563
1 great deal of harm.
It does not injure a full-grown
2 man nearly so much as it does a growing boy.
The use
3 of tobacco may injure a strong man very little (if he
4 does not smoke too much), but a growing boy may wreck

10 habits are hard to stop."

"Do not start
11 them.
12
Q.
So, Professor DiBacco, were there multiple
13 editions of this "Health by Doing" textbook that were
14 published over a number of years?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Are you familiar with versions of this
17 textbook that have statements about the habituation
18 risks of smoking cigarettes?
19 A. Yes, I am.
20 Q. Can you tell the jury about that?
21 A. Yes.
We often think that we're the first
22 people, those of us in the mid 20th century, to think
23 and know about nicotine.
Well, nicotine was a
24 substance that was identified very early on by
25 individuals not only in the popular press, but also
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083564
1 doctors as being very habit-forming.
And this was also
2 stressed in terms of these textbooks during the time.
3
Q.
So now, Professor DiBacco, one of the
4 sources of the information environment that you
5 mentioned was elements of popular culture:
Movies,
6 books, things of that sort.
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. Do you have any examples of -- that you
9 brought for the jury about how the disease risks or the
10 addiction risks of cigarettes made their way through
11 popular culture through those types of sources?
12 A. Yes, I brought one particular example.
13 Q. Okay.
What is -- this is Liggett
14 Exhibit 4335.
15
16
And what is this, Professor DiBacco?
A.
This was a movie that was popular in 1942,
17 during World War II.
18 first movies.
It was one of Alfred Hitchcock's
And in this movie you have an actor by
19 the name of Robert Cummings.
You don't see him very
20 much anymore because he passed away a long time ago.
21
But I've selected a particular passage out
22 of this movie which indicates that there is a knowledge
23 and an expression of the terrible effects of certainly
24 cigarettes in terms of nicotine.
25
MR. FEIWUS:
With the Court's permission,
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083565
1
2
we'll now show a short clip from the movie.
(Video clip was played and taken down to the best
3 of the reporter's ability as follows:)
4
VOICE:
Hey, buddy, hold the wheel a while,
5 will you, while I animate this thing.
6 nicotine addict.
7
I'm a
(Video clip concluded.)
8 BY MR. FEIWUS:
9
Q.
10 hear.
So it may have been a little difficult to
The term used by the actor, Mr. Cummings, was
11 what?
12
A.
That's not Mr. Cummings.
13 opposite man.
That's the
I'm -- "I'm a nicotine addict."
That's
14 what he says.
15
Q.
Okay.
And this was -- this movie was a
16 movie that was popular in wide release in 1942.
17
A.
Yes.
It was one of Alfred Hitchcock's first
18 suspense movies, and, of course, that name became
19 familiar with so many movies afterwards.
20
Q.
So what is the relevance of finding a
21 reference to "nicotine addict" in a 1942 movie that was
22 a popular movie at that time?
23
A.
Movies reflect society.
If a movie produces
24 something that the society doesn't understand, the
25 movie will not be a hit.
You use the terms that are
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083566
1 reflective of society.
And the term "nicotine addict"
2 is one that the society has already been exposed to so
3 it makes an effect in terms of the movie.
4
Q.
So that was very helpful, Professor DiBacco,
5 to talk about the pre-1950 period.
Now I'd like to
6 turn your attention to 1950 and thereafter.
7
So could you tell -- could you describe for
8 the jury what happens to the information environment
9 regarding cigarette smoking and health risks of
10 cigarette smoking starting in 1950?
11
A.
12 forward.
What happens is just a monumental leap
What had been largely relatively little
13 medical information in the 1800s and the early 20th
14 century, 1900, 1920, 1930, is countered by the 1950s by
15 a mushrooming, a blossoming of scientific medical
16 studies for the first time to back up the claims that
17 smoking cigarettes and health risks are tied together.
18 And the first one of these is a major one reported in
19 1950.
20
Q.
Before I show that to the jury, the question
21 I have for you, sir, is:
Were these scientific studies
22 that were being done starting in the early 1950s, were
23 they only -- were they recorded in peer-reviewed
24 journals or scientific journals?
25
A.
They were first put in scientific journals.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083567
1 There are two major scientific journals of medicine.
2 There was a big article today in terms of the Tampa Bay
3 Times about a new drug that's just been introduced in
4 terms of breast cancer.
5 MR. SALES: Objection; irrelevant,
6 nonresponsive. Tampa Tribune as well.
7 THE COURT:
8
Counsel, do you want to
redirect --
9
MR. FEIWUS:
10
Yes, I will.
That's fine.
I
will.
11 BY MR. FEIWUS:
12
Q.
So here's the question, Professor DiBacco:
13 Notwithstanding the fact that these studies were in
14 journals, did the information in the journals make
15 their way to the public at large through any kind of --
16 any kind of channels or sources?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. Could you describe that for the jury,
19 please.
20
A.
The information was taken from the journals
21 and put in newspapers and magazines and similar type
22 media.
And this particular one which we are going to
23 show you was taken from the Journal of the American
24 Medical Association in 1950.
It was a study of man
25 which linked their lives in terms of their being
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083568
1 related to lung cancer and studies made by two
2 prominent medical men, one of whom was Dr. Evarts A.
3 Graham of Washington University in St. Louis and a
4 younger physician by the name of Ernst Wynder.
And
5 they had done a study which comes out and which got a
6 major attraction in terms of the newspapers and press
7 of the day.
8
Q.
Okay.
So the two exhibits that we have
9 here, one is from the New York Times in May of 1950,
10 one is from Newsweek in June of 1950.
And, for the
11 record, they are Liggett Exhibits 4806 and Liggett
12 Exhibit 3203.
13
So the New York Times and Newsweek, these
14 were national media sources in the 1950s.
15
A.
National media sources.
These are two of
16 the largest publications in terms of circulation.
17
Q.
And these stories were featured prominently
18 in those publications.
19
A.
They were featured prominently in these, as
20 you will see by my next slide, which illustrates the
21 extent to which coverage was given.
22
Q.
One more question about this before we go to
23 the next slide.
The New York Times, was it -- was it
24 common, uncommon, unusual for local or regional papers
25 to pick up stories from the New York Times and reprint
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083569
1 them?
2
A.
Yes.
And if they didn't pick it up from the
3 New York Times -- remember, throughout much of the
4 history of newspapers there are several wire services,
5 one of which is the New York Times, the other one is
6 Associated Press, then United Press International and
7 Reuters come in.
So if one doesn't carry it, it's
8 carried by others.
9
Q.
Now, in your research did you actually find
10 examples where studies were carried in the national
11 papers that were also repeated or reprinted in some
12 form in regional or local papers?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Okay.
15 slide.
So that would -- this is the next
It's the same exhibit, 4806, the May 1950 New
16 York Times article.
17
18
So what is the relevance of this slide?
A.
Well, this is the same article.
We just
19 gave you the top half in the previous study, and this
20 gives you some extent to which it is explained in
21 considerable detail.
22
"Two reports in the current issue of the
23 Journal of the American Medical Association published
24 yesterday warned that there appears to be a significant
25 relationship between prolonged tobacco smoking and the
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083570
1 development of cancer of the lung."
2
Q.
Okay.
Now, following this 1950 study, were
3 there other studies that were picked up in the popular
4 press in the early 1950s?
5
A.
Yes.
In 1953 these same physicians,
6 Dr. Graham and Dr. Wynder, Ernst Wynder, did a study of
7 tobacco tars.
They took tobacco tars and they put them
8 on the skins, the backs of mice.
And these mice, 44
9 percent of them, developed cancer of the skin.
And
10 this was a story here in TIME Magazine, which was a
11 weekly news magazine.
LIFE was more a pictorial news
12 magazine with a lot of pictures.
And it is certainly a
13 major story, as illustrated by this slide.
14
Q.
And just for the record, I believe the LIFE
15 Magazine from December 21, 1953 is already in evidence.
16 Although I don't know what the Court's exhibit number
17 is.
But for the record, I will just put it as
18 Exhibit 3222.
And the TIME Magazine article from
19 November 30th, 1953 is Liggett Exhibit 3218.
20
21 is:
So my question to you, Professor DiBacco,
Did LIFE Magazine and TIME Magazine, were these
22 national publications with widespread circulation?
23
A.
24 magazine.
Widespread.
LIFE was the largest pictorial
And TIME was the largest weekly news
25 magazine.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083571
1
Q.
And was the 1953 mouse skin-painting study
2 by Wynder and Graham, did that receive a lot of press
3 in the -- at that time period?
4 A. It did.
5 Q. Okay.
And so you also have some examples
6 from LIFE showing some of the language.
Would you
7 please read that for the jury?
8
A.
9
Yes.
"The cause of the current challenge to a
10 major national habit was the discussion of research by
11 Drs. Evarts Graham and Adele Croninger of St. Louis's
12 Washington University and Dr. Ernst Wynder of the
13 Sloan-Kettering Institute of New York.
They had
14 repeatedly painted the skins of mice with cigarette
15 tar, inducing skin cancer in 44 percent of the
16 animals."
17 Q. And I think you have another slide.
18 A. I have another slide which shows more
19 vividly these particular adverse effects which you find
20 on the backs of mice.
And, again, LIFE Magazine,
21 widely distributed major pictorial magazine and giving
22 a great deal of attention to it.
23
Q.
Were these stories also picked up by the New
24 York Times?
25
A.
Yes.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083572
1 Q. And other national papers that you reviewed?
2 A. Yes, sir, they are.
3 Q. What's the significance of this?
4 A. This is just a callout or blowup of what we
5 had seen in the previous slide, which shows again the
6 adverse effects on mice in terms of painting tobacco
7 tar.
8
And one of the reasons that mice were
9 selected by these two scientists, according to the
10 reports in TIME and LIFE, is that the skin of the mice
11 was very similar to the tissue found in human lungs.
12
Q.
Are you familiar with the term "cancer
13 scare."
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Could you describe for the jury what the
16 cancer scare of 1953, 1954 was?
17
A.
Well, two researchers from the American
18 Cancer Society began a study -- actually, they had
19 begun it in 1951 -- of 187,000 plus veterans that
20 ascertained what was happening to these individuals if
21 they smoked.
And they did a several-year study.
And
22 they had thought it would take at least until 1956 to
23 complete the study.
But by 1954, they had found that
24 the evidence that they had already compiled on not all
25 of the 187,000 plus veterans was so persuasive that
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083573
1 they went to the American Medical Association meeting
2 in San Francisco to make a report.
And that created
3 national attention because here is another piece of
4 information regarding the adverse effect of cigarettes
5 on health.
6
Q.
So this -- the study that you're referring
7 to is the initial Hammond and Horn American Cancer
8 Society report, 1954; is that right, sir?
9 A. That is correct.
10 Q. And that was an epidemiological study at
11 that time.
12
A.
Yes.
These were two of the most renowned
13 researchers with the American Cancer Society.
14 Q. That's Drs. Hammond and Horn?
15 A. Dr. Daniel Hammond and Cuyler -- Daniel Horn
16 and Cuyler Hammond, yes.
17
Q.
And so the A -- the initial nonfinal but the
18 initial findings from the Hammond and Horn ACS study,
19 did they make their way into the popular press?
20 A. It did --
21 Q. And how was it --
22 A. -- in fact.
23 Q. And how was it covered?
24 A. It was covered in LIFE again.
It was
25 covered in the New York Times, the New York Daily News;
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083574
1 these and many other newspapers.
And these were all
2 designed to indicate to the public, here's the largest
3 study that had been done.
Remember, the first study
4 that Wynder and Graham made, which they published in
5 1950, it was only on a few hundred men.
This is the
6 beginning of the study of 187,000 plus, so it's much
7 wider and, therefore, much more emphatic.
8
Q.
So we have here LIFE Magazine from July
9 1954, which is, for the record, Liggett Exhibit 4378,
10 and a New York Times article from June 22nd, 1954,
11 Exhibit 4829.
And these are just two of many examples,
12 Professor DiBacco, of how this initial Hammond and Horn
13 study was reported in the press.
14 A. That is correct.
15 Q. And I think you have some additional slides
16 on this LIFE Magazine article.
17 A. I do.
18 Q. This is from July 5th, 1954.
And, Professor
19 DiBacco, what is the significance of this slide?
20
A.
Well, again, this brings to the attention of
21 Americans who get this preliminary report with respect
22 to how bad smoking can be for you that there begins an
23 enormous campaign for Americans who try to quit
24 smoking.
25
And here is an example in LIFE Magazine in
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083575
1 terms of replicating a coffin, which is taken back from
2 the late 19th century which suggested that a cigarette
3 was a nail in your coffin.
4 Americans is:
And now the question facing
How do I quit?
How do I swear it off?
5 And this is in a major publication.
6
Q.
So just realized that I don't have glasses
7 with me. Thanks very much.
8 That's much better.
The cartoon reads:
9 "Turn-of-the-century term 'coffin nail' comes back."
10 And the headline is "The Week's Topic A:
11 swear off?"
12
A.
How do I
What does "How do I swear off" refer to?
How do I quit.
How do I stop what I've been
13 doing.
14
Q.
And what does this tell you about popular
15 information about habituation risk and addiction risk
16 of cigarettes in 1954?
17 A. It tells you that it is widespread.
18 Q. What is this portion of the -- what's the
19 significance of this language?
20
A.
This is part of that same article which I've
21 culled out for you.
22
"The study, begun in November of 1951,
23 required periodic checks on the lives of some 200,000
24 male smokers and nonsmokers.
25 1956.
It was to be completed in
But the results already in, Hammond and Horn
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083576
1 felt, were so grave that they were imperative that they
2 be announced at once.
They told a rapt audience:
3 Cigarette smokers between 50 and 70 have a death rate
4 higher -- some of them as much as 75 percent higher --
5 than nonsmokers."
6
Q.
So, Professor DiBacco, are you familiar with
7 the Reader's Digest?
8 A. I am familiar.
9 Q. Can you describe for the jury what the
10 Reader's Digest was in 1950 and how that fit into
11 popular culture?
12
A.
Reader's Digest was the most popular
13 magazine in the United States in the 1950s.
It's still
14 published today, but it's a shadow of what it was.
It
15 is a magazine that takes articles that were elsewhere
16 and condenses them into readable form so that the
17 average American can understand them.
And Reader's
18 Digest in the 1950s carries these particular topics
19 that are being bandied about in terms of the American
20 press.
21
Q.
So just -- we have a slide here with some
22 Liggett exhibits of Reader's Digest articles from
23 January 1950, it appears, to January 1958.
24 ahead and read the exhibit numbers.
25 3201, 3212, 3233, 3267, and 2741.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-3408
I'll go
Exhibit 3200,3577
1
So did Reader's Digest have -- what was the
2 nature of the coverage that Reader's Digest had for
3 topics concerning cigarettes?
4
A.
Well, we'll see subsequently when we have
5 another slide, Mr. Feiwus, that Reader's Digest was so
6 much into the field of publishing information about
7 smoking and health that the American Cancer Society
8 gave it a special tribute.
We'll see in a few more
9 slides.
10
Q.
What are the relevance of these particular
11 articles of:
"Cancer by the Carton," "How Harmful are
12 Cigarettes," "The Facts Behind the Cigarette
13 Controversy," "The Facts Behind Filter-Tip Cigarettes,"
14 "Nicotine:
The Smoker's Enigma"?
What kind of
15 coverage was -- were these particular articles given on
16 these subjects?
17
A.
18 public.
This is the information in the general
There are a lot of smokers in America.
A good
19 proportion, half of the population by this time, were
20 smoking.
And this is an attempt to provide information
21 to Americans so that they can make up on their minds as
22 to what they want to do with regard to the smoking.
23 It's very high.
And this is a good indication of the
24 Reader's Digest giving you several issues to consider,
25 from the issue of filters all the way, of course, to
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083578
1 the issue of nicotine.
2
Q.
Was there -- by 1955 was there a strong
3 association in the public media between cancer and
4 cigarette use?
5 A. Yes, there was.
6 Q. And it says "Nicotine:
7 Enigma."
The Smoker's
What was in the popular press about nicotine
8 in the 1955 time frame?
9
10
11
MR. SALES:
Objection; hearsay.
He's asking
what was in other press, not displayed.
THE COURT:
You want to approach?
12 SIDEBAR CONFERENCE:
13 (The following proceedings were had before the
14 Court outside the presence of the jury:)
15
THE COURT:
You want to elaborate on the
16 objection?
17 elicit something more than --
18
How is that question seeking to
MR. SALES:
It was asking the popular press.
19 The extent, as I understand the question, beyond
20 this magazine.
21 and I may, but I can't cross the witness on
22 things that he doesn't say what they are.
I can cross with the magazine,
23 THE COURT: Okay.
24 MR. SALES: I know --
25 THE COURT: I believe he's testifying as an
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083579
1
2
expert on culture and what's in the wind.
MR. SALES:
That's fine.
The question was:
3 What was in the popular press?
4 press, because I know that often it has stuff
5 that's good for me in the same very article.
6 And this witness takes the position --
7
8
9
THE COURT:
Okay.
Okay.
Show me the
I understand.
What were you trying to elicit?
MR. FEIWUS:
I should just be allowed to
10 elicit from the witness that these are typical
11 articles that inform his opinion, but they're
12 not the only articles that inform his opinion.
13 He saw lots of articles.
14 hundred thousand or 10,000 articles.
15
THE COURT:
He hasn't brought a
So you could ask him were there
16 other articles like this that we're not seeing
17 today.
18 MR. FEIWUS:
Sure.
19 THE COURT: 20 MR. FEIWUS: 21 THE COURT: You know, do it that way.
22 MR. SALES: Well, I think he has a slide
Were there a lot of them?
Fine.
No problem.
23 up -- that's coming up that says that the
24 universe of these articles was confined to 38 of
25 them over time.
www.phippsreporting.com

MR. FEIWUS:
That was just the Reader's
Digest articles.
3 MR. SALES:
4 MR. FEIWUS:
5 THE COURT:
6 Talk to the judge.
7 him?
8
9
10
Well, then --
Isn't this a point for cross?
Remember, talk to the judge.
MR. FEIWUS:
What was your question to
I just said, isn't this a cross
point?
MR. SALES:
It's not a cross point if this
11 witness is allowed to say there's lots of other
12 stuff out there.
13 in the courtroom any of it.
14
15
THE COURT:
I'm not going to show anybody
If he's doing this as an
example --
16 MR. SALES: That's fine.
17 THE COURT: I mean, he's doing this as an
18
example.
19 MR. SALES: That's fine.
20 THE COURT: And his point is to say that
21
22
there was a lot of this stuff out there.
MR. SALES:
How do I cross him on that?
He
23 has a list of 20,000 things.
I've picked the
24 ones I want to use to cross him with.
25 doesn't say something about what to look for --
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-3408
But if he3581
1 THE COURT: Well, how many thousand?
2 MR. SALES: 1,000.
3 THE COURT: I have 950 of others that I
4 didn't put up here today, it sounds like it is
5 actually somewhat quantified.
6 MR. SALES: My objection was hearsay.
7 THE COURT: Well, and at this -- and I -- I
8 was encouraging the -- Mr. Feiwus to ask his
9 question a different way.
His point is that
10 there's -- will you be making a hearsay
11 objection to the question to eliciting testimony
12 that there were -- there was a great number of
13 articles that -- similar to the one that's up on
14 the board?
15 to that?
16
Would you make a hearsay objection
MR. SALES:
No, because he's talking about
17 Reader's Digest.
18 there were 38 of them.
19 with that.
20
THE COURT:
He later has a slide that says
I don't have a problem
Are there other similar, besides
21 the one Reader's Digest?
22 trying to get at.
23
MR. SALES:
That's what you're
You know the part -- I don't
24 think that's adequate, Your Honor.
25 view is that this coverage, both sides were
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-3408
The -- our3582
1 told.
This witness expressed a view that the
2 only competing message that's communicated was
3 this message.
4 about -- and if you look at that first slide he
5 showed, he said there was no competing message.
And you won't hear him talk
6 THE COURT: There was no what message?
7 MR. SALES: There was no competing message.
8 I agree that would be a cross point.
9
10
And it
will be.
But when he says this is what was being said
11 in other places and I don't know what the other
12 places are, how do I formulate my questions for
13 him on cross?
14
THE COURT:
How is that different when you
15 put up advertisements and say, This is a sample
16 of the advertising in the course of many, many
17 more -- and there were many more than this?
18
MR. SALES:
That's not true.
With respect
19 to Lark, we put up all we could find, and
20 they're all in evidence.
21 evidence.
22
23
THE COURT:
None of this is in
Well, you're going to put this
in evidence?

I don't like the question,

Thank you.
7 END OF SIDEBAR CONFERENCE
8 (The following proceedings were had before the
9 Court and jury:)
10 BY MR. FEIWUS:
11
Q.
Professor DiBacco, the question is:
In
12 other magazines, other periodicals at this time, TIME
13 Magazine, LIFE Magazine, other magazines that you may
14 be able to identify for the jury, was information about
15 the adverse effects of nicotine or the association with
16 cigarettes and cancer, did those appear in those types
17 of periodicals in the 1950 time frame?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. I want to go back to that LIFE Magazine that
20 we talked about before.
This is the original Wynder
21 and Graham mouse skin-painting study as it appeared in
22 LIFE Magazine.
23 A. Right.
24 Q. The jury has seen this magazine and has seen
25 tobacco company advertisements in this magazine.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-3408
My3584
1 question for you is:
Did you consider tobacco company
2 advertisements in connection with the work that you
3 did, the research that you did for this case and for,
4 you know, for this topic generally?
5
A.
Well, I saw tobacco advertising.
6 considered.
It was
It was not a part of the situation with
7 respect to looking at the health risks of smoking.
But
8 as they appeared, obviously they were looked at.
9
Q.
And so why -- when you say that
10 advertisements weren't considered as sources of
11 information concerning health, what is your basis for
12 that?
13
A.
Well, advertisements for cigarettes are
14 designed to sell cigarettes.
And these particular time
15 periods, which is now in the early 1950s, there were
16 all sorts of claims being made, which would eventually
17 be eliminated by the Federal Trade Commission.
There
18 were claims, for example, the issue of smoking
19 cigarettes with less irritation to the throat and the
20 like.
These were part of the environment of the 1950s
21 which the Federal Trade Commission eliminated by
22 September of 1955.
23
Q.
Professor DiBacco, the jury has also seen
24 during this time period, 1950s, particularly 1954
25 onward, many, many documents from the internal files of
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083585
1 tobacco companies.
2
And my question for you is:
Did you
3 consider internal tobacco company documents with
4 respect to the work that you've done in forming your
5 opinion for this case?
6
A.
No, I did not.
I dealt only with those that
7 were publicly available at the time.
8
Q.
Now, the jury has also seen from the
9 plaintiff's case a news program called "See It Now."
10 And I believe that you've brought a portion of "See It
11 Now."
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. My question is:
Could you just give us some
14 background as to what "See It Now" was in 1955?
15
A.
"See It Now" was the 60 Minutes of its day.
16 It was a half-hour program each week, usually on a
17 Friday.
Its moderator was one of the most respected
18 newsmen in the United States, Edward R. Murrow.
Some
19 of you may have seen the movie about Edward R. Murrow.
20 It was called "Good Night, and Good Luck."
It starred
21 David Strathairn.
22
And this particular program was designed to
23 deal with controversial issues of the time and to
24 present both sides of them.
25
Q.
And the particular clips that you brought --
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083586
1 and they're marked as Liggett Exhibit 4383 -- they come
2 from a program that ran how long?
3 A. Thirty minutes.
4 Q. Well, did it run on one night, two nights?
5 A. Two nights.
May 31st, 1955 was the first
6 segment for a half an hour.
And then June 7th, 1955
7 for the second segment.
8
Q.
So there's a total of 60 minutes that are
9 covered by this particular program that deals with
10 smoking and health issues, correct?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. And were there -- in this program were there
13 representatives of tobacco company interests that
14 presented their point of view?
15
A.
Yes.
Both sides.
16 health community on one side.
You have the public
You have the tobacco
17 industry on the other.
18
Q.
Okay.
And I believe the jury has seen some
19 of the portions of this show that relate to the tobacco
20 company representatives.
21 brought here today?
What portions have you
What is the jury going to see from
22 the short clip that you brought?
23
24 it.
A.
You're going to see the public health end of
You're going to see representatives of the

MR. FEIWUS:
So I think now we can show this
clip.
(Video clip was played and taken down to the best

MR. MURROW:
Tonight we present a report by
18 scientists on the relationship, if any, between
19 cigarette smoking and lung cancer.
20 accept responsibility for the editing, but the
21 facts will be presented by scientists who are
22 preeminent in their fields.
23
We obviously
This is the statistical department of the
24 American Cancer Society, where an extensive
25 survey of the possibility of the relationship

(888)811-34083588
1 between cigarettes and lung cancer has been
2 going on for three years.
3
DR. GRAHAM:
We, therefore, in 1950,
4 undertook a series of experiments on mice with
5 the idea of attempting to produce cancer in
6 these mice by using the tar obtained from
7 cigarette smoke.
8
MR. MURROW:
Next, Dr. Ernst Wynder and
9 research assistant Adele Croninger demonstrate
10 the cigarette-smoking machine that led to their
11 findings.
12
DR. WYNDER:
And this bottle contains the
13 amount of tar to which the average heavy
14 cigarette smoker is exposed to over a given
15 year's period of time.

MISS CRONINGER:
These animals were painted
17 three times a week with the cigarette tar
18 solution.

We believe that the present

DR. HAMMOND:
We in the American Cancer
2 Society are making a study of smoking habits and

(Video clip concluded.)
15 BY MR. FEIWUS:
16
Q.
So at the end, that was who, Professor
17 DiBacco?
18 A. That was Cuyler Hammond.
19 Q. And he is the --
20 A. The medical director of the American Cancer
21 Society.
22
Q.
Is it the same Cuyler Hammond that was
23 involved with the 1954 initial Hammond and Horn ACS
24 study?
25
A.
Yes, that is correct.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083590
1
Q.
After this 1955 period were there additional
2 scientific studies concerning the cancer risk of
3 cigarettes that came out in popular press?
4 A. Yes, there were.
5 Q. And what is the next study that makes its
6 way into the popular press that you've brought for the
7 jury today?
8
A.
Remember that every attempt is being made
9 during this time period to get as much evidence as
10 possible, so the American Heart Association, the
11 American Cancer Society and other organizations asked
12 seven experts who had not been identified in earlier
13 studies like Evarts Graham and Wynder to undertake a
14 new study to determine whether they found a
15 relationship between cancer and smoking cigarettes.
16
And they reported in 1957, these seven
17 experts did find that cigarettes were a factor in lung
18 cancer.
And you can see from this slide that it is
19 extensively covered in national magazines as well as in
20 the New York Times.
21
Q.
So just for the record, you have a New York
22 Times article dated March 23rd, 1957.
23 Exhibit 4860.
That's Liggett
A Newsweek magazine article called "The
24 Smoking Issue" dated April 1, 1957.
25 Liggett Exhibit 4398.
And that is
And then you have TIME Magazine,
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083591
1 it says, "Medicine:
Smoking & Cancer (Continued)," and
2 "continued" is in parenthesis.
That's April 1, 1957.
3 And that's Exhibit 4413.
4
And would you say that these are typical of
5 the coverage that was given in national newspapers and
6 periodicals of the seven-expert report in 1957?
7 A. Yes, I would.
8 Q. What's the -- what's the relevance in
9 particular of the TIME Magazine article in the upper
10 right-hand corner, "Smoking and Cancer"?
11
A.
What's relevant here is that it begins --
12 TIME Magazine, every time there is any information
13 that's new on smoking and cancer, it uses the
14 parenthesis "continued"; in other words, it's going to
15 be an ongoing story.
This is appearing whenever any
16 news study comes out that's going to continue it.
17 That's the significance.
18
Q.
Okay.
And you have some -- called out some
19 language on the next slide from the March 1957 New York
20 Times article on the seven-expert study.
And could you
21 read that for the jury and tell us the significance of
22 this particular language?
23
A.
"There is a direct cause-and-effect
24 relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer,
25 according to a report by seven experts who have made a
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083592
1 thorough review of the scientific evidence."
2
This particular study was sort of the focal
3 point of moving the Public Health Service and others to
4 issue warnings about cigarettes.
5
Q.
Now, as part of your research, Professor
6 DiBacco, did you also consider statements that were
7 made by tobacco industry representatives during this
8 relevant period of time, the 1950s?
9 A. Sure, absolutely.
10 Q. And what did you find with respect to the
11 way that statements by tobacco industry representatives
12 were reported in the national press?
13
A.
Well, I have a slide here which is the same
14 story in the New York Times relating to the story about
15 the seven experts finding relationship between smoking
16 and lung cancer.
It's a very long story.
17 see, it's carried over to the next page.
As you can
And the
18 highlighted remark gives the Tobacco Industry Research
19 Committee comment.
And it is a statement of Timothy V.
20 Hartnett.
21
"Since this report has reached public
22 attention by way of a news leak, it is impossible to
23 make comment based on the necessary thorough review of
24 the report itself.
Such comment should come from the
25 sponsoring agencies.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083593
1
"However, this report apparently offers no
2 original evidence, but is another review of studies
3 made by others and place heavy reliance on statistical
4 associations that have been widely publicized for
5 several years and widely questioned by other scientists
6 as to their significance.
7
"This serves once more to emphasize the
8 importance of careful and thorough research on the
9 basic and complicated questions of what causes cancer.
10 The Tobacco Industry Research Committee has
11 appropriated $1,100,000 to date for a wide range of
12 research projects to help provide the necessary
13 answers."
14
Q.
So that is a typical, quote, not proven
15 statement by the Tobacco Industry Research Committee,
16 or the TIRC, in the late 1950s, correct?
17
A.
It's a quote that is consistent throughout
18 the 1950s and '60s arguing that, one, it's a
19 statistical association that's been made.
We need to
20 do more research to find scientific causation of
21 cancer, and we will do everything possible to help with
22 that research.
23
Q.
And what is the relevance, in your opinion,
24 as to the relevant placement of the coverage of Timothy
25 Hartnett or the TIRC's statement as against the main
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083594
1 byline of the article?
2
A.
Well, it's buried, which means it's given
3 very little attention.
When you put it at the end of
4 the story, it's giving it a burying effect.
It's not
5 prominent.
6
Q.
And did you find this type of coverage
7 typical of the way the TIRC statements and other
8 tobacco industry statements of the same ilk were placed
9 and managed in the national press in the 1950s and
10 '60s?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Is there another study that comes out 1957
13 around the same time as the seven-expert study that is
14 relevant to your opinion?
15
A.
Yes.
And this is, finally, the final
16 Hammond-Horn report, which is finally put down in its
17 final form.
And this is the 187,000 plus veterans.
18 Now they get the final report.
19 the same.
And the conclusion is
"Cigarette smoking linked to cancer in a
20 high degree."
And, again, you see it carried
21 extensively in the New York Times and TIME Magazine and
22 other periodicals.
23
Q.
And just for the record, this is New York
24 Times, June 5th, 1957, and that's Liggett Exhibit 553;
25 and TIME Magazine, June 17th, 1957, Exhibit 4861.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083595
1
During this period of time, 1957, was there
2 information that was in the popular press regarding the
3 potential for warnings being required on cigarette
4 products?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. And could you describe that generally for
7 the jury.
8
A.
Well, there was a debate.
Many people in
9 the medical community thought they had had many years
10 of warnings now, at least since the 1950s.
And there
11 were others who objected and said, We still need
12 evidence.
And these warnings should be placed on the
13 cigarettes.
14
Q.
And was there information in the public
15 press about the position that the Surgeon General in
16 1957, Leroy Burney, took on the issue of whether or not
17 warnings were required?
18
19
A.
There was. Mr. Burney --
MR. SALES: Excuse me.
Your Honor, this is
20 the thing that we were talking about when the
21 jury was out, the Blatnik hearings and Congress.

1 (The following proceedings were had before the
2 Court and jury:)
3 BY MR. FEIWUS:
4
Q.
Professor DiBacco, in 1957 was there a
5 controversy that emanated from all this scientific
6 information concerning health risks of cigarettes, was
7 there a controversy, 1957, over whether or not
8 cigarettes should get warning labels at that time?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. And were there legitimate scientists outside
11 of the tobacco company that took the position that
12 warning labels were not required?
13
MR. SALES:
14
Objection to the form,
"legitimate."
15 BY MR. FEIWUS:
16
Q.
Were there tobacco -- were there scientists
17 and public health officials outside of the tobacco --
18 having nothing to do with the tobacco industry who took
19 the position that warning labels were not required?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. Okay.
And that information, that debate,
22 that controversy, was that well-publicized in 1957?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. So now I want to move on to the next
25 subject.
We earlier saw a film clip from 1942
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083601
1 "Saboteur."
2
Is the information that's coming out about
3 the health risks and the addiction risks of cigarettes
4 in the late 1950s, early 1960s, does that make its way
5 into other forms of popular culture beyond newspapers
6 and magazines?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. And did you bring any examples of that?
9 A. I brought one, yes, sir, Mr. Feiwus.
10 Q. Okay.
11 from 1962.
12
A.
And so this is "Sweet Bird of Youth"
And that is Liggett Exhibit 4438.
That's a movie.
It's starring two people,
13 one of whom you'll probably recognize, maybe both.
14 Paul Newman, who recently died, and Geraldine Page.
15 And this is a color movie in color in the period of
16 1962.
17
Q.
It's a short clip that you've brought.
Do
18 you want to preview for the jury what the language is
19 that comes out that's relevant to your opinion?
20
A.
Well, it's very hard to listen to this.
But
21 we'll repeat it for you.
22
Paul Newman has his girlfriend, Geraldine
23 Page. And he's a hustler of sorts, as he was in real
24 life. He's a good man.

But he obviously wants to be
And he tells her, you know, "I got a

And she says, "Come
2 out, and I want you to get me a cigarette."
And we'll
3 take it from there.
4 Q. Okay.
This was a popular movie in 1962.
5 A. Popular movie.
Anything that Paul Newman
6 did, popular.
7 Q. It was in widespread release.

2
Q.
Did you bring another example from
3 television?
4 A. I did.
5 Q. And that's the "Password" example from 1963.
6 A. Password was a word association game show.
7 It featured two celebrities and two out-of-the-audience
8 average people, Americans.
It was hosted by a
9 gentleman who's name is Allen Ludden.
The goal of
10 winning money on Password is for one partner of the
11 two teams to try to identify through hints to the other
12 partner what word Mr. Ludden had in mind as the
13 password.
14
Q.
And here is an example.
Right.
And so we're going to see that the
15 word that needs to be guessed is the one that's going
16 to be on the bottom of the screen.
17
A.
It's going to be on the bottom of the screen
18 so nobody sees it except the audience.
19
Q.
And one player is going to try to prod the
20 other player to --
21 A.

1 Henderson does everything she can to win this game, and
2 obviously the word "cancer" and "cigarettes" are tied

And, of course, the audience laughs.
And

5 is still part of an evolving story.
6
MR. SALES:
Excuse me, Your Honor.
I think
7 that is a stretch on history -- objection,
8 speculation -- why Mr. Ludden was saying
9 whatever he was saying.
10 THE COURT:
Sustained.
11 THE WITNESS:
Okay.
12 BY MR. FEIWUS:
13
Q.
So, Professor DiBacco, I'll just ask the
14 question again, and maybe you can answer it more
15 directly.
What is the relevance of the association
16 between cancer and cigarettes that was shown in this
17 program to your opinion about the public information
18 about the health risks of cigarettes in 1963?
19
A.
It reinforces my opinion that the health
20 risks of smoking permeating all avenues in terms of the
21 information environment.
22
MR. FEIWUS:
Your Honor, I can keep going,

16
Q.
Professor DiBacco, I want to turn to the
17 subject of the 1964 report.
So can you give the jury
18 some background as to how the 1964 Surgeon General's
19 Report came about?
20 beginnings?
21
A.
What was its -- what was its very
Can you tell that to the jury?
We've had seven years of reports beginning
22 in the 1950s that came out by scientists, and there are
23 so many of them.
24 fraction.
We mentioned only a fraction today, a
There are some 7,000 that have been
25 produced.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083609
1
And, of course, the issue is:
What do we do
2 in terms of these conflicting reports, some of which
3 are not identical, some of which, of course, are
4 similar?
And it was the feeling of the Public Health
5 Service that the President at the time, John F.
6 Kennedy, should appoint a blue-ribbon committee of
7 credentialed medical men to examine these 7,000
8 reports, not do any news research, but to look at all
9 of them, those produced by the scientific community,
10 those produced by the tobacco industry, those produced
11 by private individuals, all of which we could not have
12 time to mention.
13
And in 1962 that was done.
A ten-person
14 blue-ribbon committee, which was approved by the
15 tobacco industry, which was approved by the American
16 Medical Association, which was approved by the public
17 health community and the government, and they were
18 appointed with the task of coming up with a report with
19 respect to these 7,000 studies that had been done.
20
Q.
Was the formation of the ten-person
21 Scientific Advisory Board for the '64 report, did that
22 itself get carried in the press?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. What was --
25 A. Nothing --
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083610
1 Q. What was the nature of that coverage?
2 A. Nothing like this had happened before.
3 Nothing like this had ever happened before.
We had
4 always had Surgeon Generals that go way back to the
5 late 19th century and we had had all sorts of medical
6 problems, but nothing like this.
And it got widespread
7 coverage in terms of when the individuals were
8 appointed.
9
Q.
How long did it -- how long from the time of
10 the appointment of the Scientific Advisory Board until
11 the actual publication of the 1964 report?
12 A. About 18 months.
13 Q. And during that 18 months, was there any
14 press about the advisory board, its work, the potential
15 of the upcoming report?
16
A.
It was hush-hush until the last several
17 months, and then there was a lot of speculation.
But
18 there was no definitive report until January 11th,
19 1964.
20
Q.
Can you tell us the circumstances of the
21 publication of the 1964 report in January 11, 1964?
22
A.
On January 11, 1964 the report was issued by
23 the Surgeon General of the United States, Luther Terry,
24 in the State Department auditorium where President
25 Kennedy, who has now been assassinated, used to hold
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083611
1 his news conferences.
January 11, 1964 was a Saturday,
2 and they chose a Saturday because they were concerned
3 if they made the announcement about the report on a
4 Friday it might cause an economic downturn in stocks.
5 And the report was not issued until all of these
6 reporters got into the auditorium.
And they were given
7 this 378-page document, which was explained by Surgeon
8 General Luther Terry.
9
Q.
And was there coverage of the 1964 Surgeon
10 General's Report in the popular press?
11
A.
Not only was there coverage, but USA Today
12 wanted to look at all the big stories of the 20th
13 century, selected the Surgeon General's report of 1964
14 as one of the most -- of the hundred most important
15 stories, it was one of the hundred, and it was widely
16 covered.
And it was extensively reported both in the
17 newspapers, the magazines and on television.
18
Q.
And just for the record, we have here the
19 New York Times, January 12, 1964, Liggett Exhibit 3691;
20 the New York Times, January 12, 1964, Exhibit 3494;
21 Newsweek article from January 1964, Liggett Exhibit
22 4464; and TIME Magazine, January 17th, 1964, Liggett
23 Exhibit 1862.
24
So are these typical of the types of news
25 coverage that appeared in the press and in periodicals
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083612
1 in 19 -- January 1964 covering the report?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. Was this report widely covered beyond the
4 national media in regional and local markets,
5 newspapers that were more regional and local in nature?
6
A.
Not only that, but in this period you had
7 afternoon newspapers.
So sometimes you would find in a
8 local newspaper that the report would be carried that
9 very Saturday as opposed to Sunday, the next day, for a
10 morning paper.
11
Q.
So the New York Times article on the upper
12 left-hand corner, the headline is "Cigarettes Peril
13 Health, U.S. Report Concludes; 'Remedial Action'
14 Urged."
I think you have a callout of that.
15 A. I do.
16 Q. Okay.
So read this to the jury and talk
17 about the significance.
18
A.
"The long-awaited federal report on the
19 effects of smoking found today that the use of
20 cigarettes contributed so substantially to the American
21 death rate that 'appropriate remedial action' was
22 called for.
23
"Combining the results of many surveys" --
24 this is 7,000 reports -- "the study panel found no
25 doubt about the role of cigarette smoking in causing
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083613
1 cancer of the lungs."
2
This was so significant, these findings --
3 remember, it's a Saturday.
Saturday is a day when
4 Americans have off, even in the '60s.
And at night
5 television programs are geared to the family.
And all
6 three television networks preempted their regular
7 programming to hear the special report on the Surgeon
8 General's findings.
9
Q.
And did you bring us some excerpts from the
10 coverage from one of those special reports?
11 A. Yes, sir, I did, Mr. Feiwus.
12 Q. This is a NBC News Special Report dated
13 January 11th, 1964, Liggett Exhibit 4460.
Is there a
14 preview you need to give, or should we just show it?
15 A.
No, it speaks for itself.

17 of the reporter's ability as follows:)

More specifically, the committee states on

6 sources, it is the judgment of the committee
7 that cigarette smoking contributes substantially
8 to mortality from certain specific diseases and

10
MR. MCGEE:
The questioning turned to the
11 value of filters on cigarettes and to air
12 pollution as a possible cause of lung cancer.
13 Answering was Dr. James M. Hundley, Assistant
14 Surgeon General.
15 DR. HUNDLEY:
There is no evidence which
16 will establish the fact that filters have had
17 any effect in reducing the health hazards of
18 cigarette smoking.
19 MR. MCGEE:
One of the first to point an
20 accusing finger toward heavy cigarette smoking
21 was a noted lung surgeon, Dr. Alton Ochsner, and
22 that was back in 1936, after discovering a
23 dramatic increase in the number of lung cancer
24 cases among patients.
25
DR. OCHSNER:
We know that a man 50 years of
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083616

2 years longer life expectancy than a man the same

11 that will keep you from developing cancer of the
12 lung.
13 when these precancer changes are irreversible.
14 But we do know that if one will completely
15 abstain from smoking that these precancerous
16 changes will revert back to normal and that the
17 longer the time has elapsed since one has
18 stopped smoking, the less chance he has of
19 developing cancer.

6
Q.
Professor DiBacco, before we move on to a
7 new subject, is there any comment you want to give
8 about that?
9
A.
Well, one of the things you have to
10 recognize with regard to this report is not only was it
11 prime time, but you had individuals like the last
12 person there, who's Senator Maurine Neuberger.
She is
13 a senator, one of the few women senators, from the
14 state of Oregon, and she's urging that now we need to
15 take that remedial action.
And that's one of her
16 concerns that many individuals have, what do we do
17 next.
18
Q.
During this period of time, the 1960s, with
19 all this information coming out about the health and
20 addiction risks of cigarette smoking, was there any
21 information that you saw in the public press, public
22 media, periodicals, whatever sources that you reviewed,
23 regarding how to quit smoking or smoking cessation
24 that --
25
A.
Yes, quite a bit.
And I brought a slide for

2
This is in the period before the report was
3 issued and after the report was issued.
This is the
4 first one -- first slide.

This is a Ladies Home Journal report that
6 was done in November of 1961 which pointed out "Who

Professor DiBacco, what does this tell
2 you -- first of all, are these articles typical of the
3 articles that you found in periodicals, in newspapers
4 regarding smoking cessation in the 1950s to 1970s?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. Do you see a rise of the smoking cessation
7 articles around the time of the '64 report and
8 thereafter?
9 A. Absolutely.
10 Q. And what does this tell you about the
11 information that was publicly available about the
12 addiction risk of cigarettes in the -- in 1964 period
13 and thereafter?
14
A.
It tells you that individuals were trying
15 their best to stop smoking as soon as possible, because
16 what the Surgeon General's report did was to indicate
17 the adverse effects.
And it wasn't only in terms of
18 the relationship of lung cancer but to other diseases
19 as well.
20
Q.
In the New York Times article that we saw
21 and also in the piece from NBC, there was a reference
22 to remedial action, remedial action is called for.
23 What happened after the '64 report in connection with
24 the remedial action that was being referenced in those
25 two places?
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083621
1
A.
There was a movement to provide warnings on
2 cigarette packages.
3
Q.
And did the movement regarding putting
4 warnings on the cigarette packages, was that something
5 that played out in the public press?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. And could you tell the jury a little bit
8 about how that played out.
9
A.
Well, there was a group that believed --
10 obviously, the tobacco industry didn't think they were
11 necessary.
The American Medical Association believed
12 that --

That's fine.
That's fine.
25 BY MR. FEIWUS:
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083622
1
Q.
Professor DiBacco, let's just focus on the
2 information that was available.
Was there information
3 that you found in the press regarding, you know,
4 scientists outside the tobacco industry that supported
5 putting warning labels?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. Was it -- were there scientists and public
8 health officials outside of the tobacco industry that
9 after 1964 did not believe that there should be warning
10 labels?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. And was there a debate that you found in the
13 press concerning that issue, whether or not warning
14 labels should go on cigarettes in the '64, '65 time
15 frame?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. Okay.
And did you bring us a clip of one
18 such example of how that played out in the press?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Okay.
So this is Liggett Exhibit 3500, New
21 York Times, March 18th, 1964.
And what is the
22 significant -- first of all, why don't you read this
23 for the jury and then tell us what the significance of
24 it is.
25
A.
"But the American Medical Association filed
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083623
1 a statement with the commission contending that
2 cautionary labeling cannot be anticipated to serve the
3 public interest with any particular degree of success.
4 The health hazards of excessive smoking have been well
5 publicized for more than ten years and are common
6 knowledge."
7
This is an indication that the medical
8 community, and specifically the AMA, American Medical
9 Association, believed that all of these reports had
10 already done enough to bring forth the health message
11 in terms of the risks of smoking.
12
Q.
Now, notwithstanding this debate that was
13 going on in the pre-1966 time frame, did there come a
14 time when Congress acted and mandated warning labels to
15 go on cigarette products?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. Okay.
And did you bring us an example of
18 that?
19 A. I brought an example of that.
20 Q. Okay.
21 "CAUTION:
22 Health."
So this is DFL48, and it says,
Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous to Your
Is this the warning label that was required
23 by U.S. Congress in -- you know, beginning in
24 January 1st, 1966?
25
A.
That is correct.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083624
1
Q.
And did U.S. Congress mandate the precise
2 wording of this warning label?
3 A. It did.
4 Q. What about the placement, size of the font
5 of the warning label?
6 A. Everything.
7 Q. And this warning label ran on cigarette
8 packs, is that it?
9 A. On the side of the packs, that's correct.
10 Q. And it ran from January 1966 to October
11 31st, 1970?
12 A. That is correct.
13 Q. What happens in 1969 with respect -- I guess
14 before we get there, was there pub- -- what was the
15 reaction in the public press to the warning labels that
16 went on the cigarettes in 1966?
17
A.
Well, it was publicized.
And health
18 organizations like the American Cancer Society put out
19 posters to the effect that "Congress has acted.
20 next step is yours."
The
So this is an illustration that
21 these -- this warning, this widely distributed in terms
22 of the press, are known.
23
Q.
Can you tell the jury what a PSA or public
24 service announcement is?
25
A.
A public service announcement is an
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083625
1 announcement that the Federal Communications Commission
2 which governs radio and television stations require
3 stations to make, free of charge on behalf of public
4 service issues.
5
And one of the things that was done was that
6 the FCC so mandated that there be PSAs on the health
7 risks of smoking.
8
Q.
In addition to the PSAs that ran on
9 television and in the radio, were there efforts by
10 not-for-profit groups like the American Cancer Society,
11 American Lung Association to promote awareness of the
12 health risks and addiction risks of cigarettes after
13 the '64 report?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Is this such an example of that?
16 A. That's an example.
17 Q. Okay.
So beginning in 1970, what happens to
18 the warning labels that Congress had mandated in 1966?
19
A.
There are new warning labels that go into
20 effect which are stronger.
By 1970, November 1,
21 Congress has mandated as a result of pushing by the
22 public health community stronger warnings.
23
And this one comes on saying, "WARNING:
24 The Surgeon General has determined that cigarette
25 smoking is dangerous to your health."
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083626
1
The first one said, "CAUTION:
2 dangerous."
It may be
And this went on for 15 years almost, and
3 it would be replaced by even stronger warnings,
4 specific warnings beginning on October 12th, 1985.
5
Q.
Again, the language, the style, the font,
6 the placement of this warning label, were they mandated
7 by Congress?
8 A. All mandated by Congress.
9 Q. And this particular warning beginning in
10 1970, did it appear on cigarette packs?
11
A.
All on cigarette packs.
It would also
12 appear subsequently in advertising.
13
Q.
So it was -- this warning label after 19 --
14 sometime after 1970 is required on print advertisements
15 for all cigarette products?
16 A. That is correct.
17 Q. Do you recall when the -- when this warning
18 label was mandated to go on to print advertisements?
19 A. In 1972.
20 Q. In addition to warning labels, what -- what
21 other remedial action did the government take with
22 respect to the regulation of cigarettes starting in the
23 early 1970s?
24
A.
Well, as you can see, every year from 1964
25 onward, there would be a report by the Surgeon General.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083627
1 There were 32 of these reports devoted solely to
2 smoking and health.
3
Now, other issues would be covered.
There
4 would be -- they would be covered on nutrition and
5 child abuse and oral health and issues relating to
6 suicide prevention.
But the bulk of them dealt with
7 smoking and health.
8
You saw the new required warning labels
9 which will go on.
We'll show those in a moment.
There
10 was a ban and television and radio on cigarette
11 advertising beginning on January 2nd, 1971.
And
12 warning labels were required on all print cigarette
13 advertisements beginning in 1972.
14
Q.
Did the information concerning the health
15 risks of cigarettes and the addiction risks of
16 cigarettes in the 1970s continue to make it into the
17 popular press, newspaper, periodicals, television
18 programs and the like?
19 A. It did.
20 Q. And was it -- in your opinion, in what
21 manner was that story coming into the information
22 environment?
23 A. It mushroomed.
24 Q. What about the annual Surgeon General
25 reports; did the publication of the annual Surgeon
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083628
1 General reports in following years, did they engender
2 any additional publication of information of the health
3 risks of smoking in the popular press?
4
A.
It did.
It extended the number of areas of
5 one's health that could be adversely affected by
6 cigarette smoking, which dealt with such things as
7 diabetes, heart disease, enormous numbers of maladies,
8 even sexual dysfunction.
We have a whole list of
9 maladies which are now related to cigarette smoking
10 and, of course, disease.
11
Q.
And I think you mentioned it earlier.
Did
12 there come a time when the warning label that was
13 mandated in the beginning of 1970 was modified by
14 Congress?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. And what -- when was that?
17 A. October 12th, 1985.
18 Q. You brought some examples of those warnings?
19 A. I brought some examples.
20 still on our packages today.
21 "Surgeon General's Warning:
And these are
The first one reads:
Smoking Causes Lung
22 Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema, and May Complicate
23 Pregnancy."
24
"SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING:

2
"SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING:
Smoking by
3 Pregnant Women May Result in Fetal Injury, Premature
4 Birth and Low Birthweight.
5
And, finally, "SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING:
6 Cigarette Smoking Contains Carbon Monoxide."
7
Q.
The actual wording of the warnings, the
8 placement, the style of it, the font size, were they
9 all mandated by Congress?
10 A. They were --
11 Q. Do these warning labels, do they reflect
12 additional information about the health risks of
13 cigarettes that had come out in the late 1970s, early
14 '80s and that was publicly disseminated and in the
15 information environment at that time?
16 A. That's correct.
17 Q. Now, you mentioned earlier that there were
18 public service announcements.
Tell us again, when did
19 these public service announcements run, and what were
20 they, and what was their nature?
21
A.
These were public service announcements
22 usually created by the American Cancer Society.
There
23 was a gentleman at George Washington University by the
24 name of John Banzhaf who established Action on Smoking
25 and Health, ASH, and he believed that since we would
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083630
1 not eliminate cigarette advertising on television and
2 radio until January 2nd, 1971 that in the interest of
3 fairness, we ought to have public service announcements
4 which promote information about the health risks of
5 smoking.
6 agreed.
And the Federal Communications Commission
And beginning in approximately 1968, this is
7 what was done.
8
Q.
So did the public service announcements --
9 in your review, when did these public service
10 announcements typically run, and what kind of
11 publication did they get?
12
A.
Well, they ran on radio and television.
And
13 here is a slide that I have produced which indicate
14 what one network has done.
15 Broadcasting Company.
And that's the National
It allowed time for one-minute
16 anti-smoking commercials on four primetime television
17 programs in the fall schedule.
The date of this is
18 1968.

"The programs will appear early in the
20 evening when large numbers of people will be watching.
21 An NBC spokesman said Saturday the spots would be shown
22 each week on "The New Adventures of Huck Finn" at
23 7:00 p.m., "Adam-12," 7:30 p.m. Monday; "Jerry Lewis

4
In the period '68 to '72, is this consistent
5 with what you have learned about how the PSAs were
6 running on television and on the radio?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. And did you bring some -- well, one more
9 question.
Did the PSAs continue to run even after
10 1972?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Did you bring some examples of PSAs for the
13 jury?

Do you have any comments on this one

Yul Brynner was one of the most famous

Q.
Professor DiBacco, I just have one last
6 question for you, which is, given the evidence that
7 you've shown the jury, your work in this case, in view
8 of all the sources of information that you have, could
9 you tell the jury what your opinion is about the
10 quality and nature of information about the health
11 risks, lung cancer risks, addiction risks of cigarette
12 smoking from the period of time 1950 to 1993 when
13 Ms. Westmoreland was alive?
14
A.
My opinion is the information that was
15 publicly available during the period before and during
16 Ms. Westmoreland's life with regard to the health risks
17 of smoking, in particular the risks of disease and
18 death and addiction habituation and the difficulty that
19 some people have quitting, was extensive, widely
20 available and that Miss Westmoreland was exposed to
21 that.

I'm going to stay over

11
THE COURT:
Sure.
12 BY MR. SALES:
13
Q.
Dr. DiBacco, I don't think that you were
14 asked if we were to add it all up over time, it's about
15 20 years now, what have you tallied that you've earned
16 as a result of the work that you've done in this case
17 and similar cases?
18
A.
Well, over 20 years almost -- I've earned
19 about $20,000 a year if you average it out.
I would
20 say that in this case it would range somewhat less than
21 that.
In others, it would be somewhat more
and some
22 significantly less, and at least the first case
23 significantly more.
24 Q. I was just looking for a number, sir.
25 A. 400,000 total.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083639
1
Q.
It's more than that by now because that was
2 a figure you gave us some time ago, right?
3
A.
Well, that includes expenses.
So when you
4 deduct the expenses, less.
5
Q.
All right.
6
We'll stick with $400,000.
Now, just moments ago, you told Mr. Feiwus
7 what your opinion was, right?
Remember that?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. And the -- that subject matter that you
10 identified as your opinion -- well, let me back up a
11 little bit.
12
When you were beginning your direct
13 examination, you talked about some publications, some
14 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters that you've
15 contributed and your textbook that's up there, right?
16 Right?
Do you remember that?
17 A. Yes, yes.
18 Q. Let's leave those matters aside for the
19 moment. Just -- let's leave the textbook aside for the
20 moment. I want to ask you about that.
But on the
21 subject matter of the opinion that you've given in this
22 case, you have never published any peer-reviewed
23 article on that particular topic, have you, sir?
24
A.
No.
May I ask your name, sir?
25 your name.

Q.
Oh, my name is David Sales, sir.
I'm one of
2 the plaintiff's lawyers.
3 A. It's nice to meet you.
4 Q. I'm pleased to meet you.
5 A. I'm sorry.
6 Q. Right.
And I apologize.
I knew Mr. Bass.
He's the fellow who took your
7 deposition.
8 A. I remember him, yes.
9 Q. He's given me the pleasure of asking you a
10 few questions.
11 A. And give me your name again.
12 Q. David Sales, S-a-l-e-s.
13 A. Thank you, sir.
14 Q. Just to back up, if we may, you've never
15 published an article on that topic in any peer-reviewed
16 journal, right, sir?
17 A. No.
18 Q. You've never been asked to comment on that
19 subject matter on any of the television shows that you
20 appeared on over time, right, sir?
21 A. No.
22 Q. You've never been asked to give a speech as
23 part of -- being part of a panel discussion on those
24 subject matters, correct?
25
A.
No, sir.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083641
1
Q.
And you've never taught a course for the
2 topics of whether information relating to the health
3 risks of smoking were part of the same issues that you
4 talked about today, right, sir?
5 A. No.
6 Q. All right.
And I think you told Mr. Feiwus
7 that what happened was in the mid 1990s you were
8 approached by lawyers who represent cigarette firms, or
9 a cigarette firm, I should say cigarette company,
10 and -- after you had written an article that appeared
11 in USA Today; is that right?
12 A. That's correct.
13 Q. Let's take a look at it, if we could.
14 You'll remember that.
I have the date of -- I think it
15 was July 28th, 1995 or January.
16 that is because I can't tell.
And the reason I say
And maybe you can help
17 us.
18 A. It's definitely July.
19 Q. All right.
20 A. And it may be the 27th.
21 that with Mr. Bass earlier.
But we talked about
But it's one of those
22 dates.
23
Q.
All right.
Okay.
Well, anyway, it's the
24 middle of 1995?
25
A.
That's correct.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083642
1 Q. And this is the article, right?
2 A. That's correct.
3 Q. And the occasion of the article is discussed
4 in the beginning paragraph.
Because what was happening
5 at the time was that the Administration, that was the
6 Clinton Administration, was thinking about declaring
7 nicotine an addictive drug, right?
8 A. No.
That had already been declared.
9 Q. Well, by the Food & Drug Administration,
A. No, in 1988, the Surgeon General had
10 sir?
11
12 declared --
13 Q. Sir, look at your article, if you would.
14 A. I know that.
15 Q. I haven't asked you a question.
16 A. He announced --
17 Q. Sir, I haven't asked you a question.
18
Ready?
"The Food & Drug Administration announced
19 its intention to declare nicotine an addictive drug
20 this month."
That was the occasion on which you wrote
21 this article, right?
22 A. That's correct.
23 Q. Okay.
All right.
That's right.
And, in fact, that did
24 not happen in 1995, right?
25
A.
That is correct.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083643
1
Q.
It didn't happen until when, sir?
When did
2 the Food & Drug Administration first even get involved
3 in the question of whether or not nicotine is an
4 addictive drug?
5 A. It didn't.
6 Q. All right, sir.
And just to put a little
7 bit of a fine point on this, you expressed an opinion
8 about whether or not that should happen, right?
9 Whether or not the FDA should get involved, right?
10 A. That is correct.
11 Q. And one of the things that's highlighted
12 there -- and this is 1995, right?
13 A. That's correct.
14 Q. That would be eight years after the Surgeon
15 General first declared nicotine an addictive drug,
16 right?
17 A. Seven years.
18 Q. Thank you.
19
I think you're right on that.
"As for nicotine's addictive nature," you
20 wrote, "the verdict is still out."
Those are your
21 words, right?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. And the reason you thought so is that you
24 gave your own experience.
"Certainly for me and other
25 heavy smokers who went cold turkey years ago without
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083644
1 knowing we were ever clinically dependent."
2 your words?
That's my only question.
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. All right.
Those are
Right?
Now, as a matter of fact, sir,
5 in 1995, that wasn't the only article that you wrote
6 about matters of smoking and health, right, sir?
7 A. That's correct.
8 Q. And -- yes, sir?
9 A. Yes, sir.
10 Q. You also wrote an article that appeared in
11 the Washington Times.
I'm sorry?
Do you remember that?
12 A. I do.
13 Q. And the Washington Times is a paper, a daily
14 paper in addition to the Washington Post that appears
15 in the town where you used to teach, American
16 University, Washington D.C., right?
17 A. That's correct.
18 Q. And the title of that article, perhaps you
19 didn't write the headline for it, was "Imperial
20 Presidency Domestic Style," right?
21

23
A.
I wrote the heading.

THE COURT:
You're making my job too easy.
3 BY MR. SALES:
4 Q. So you remember this, right, sir?
5 A. I do.
6 Q. And the occasion of that article was, again,
7 a discussion about whether or not the FDA should get
8 involved, without getting into the details of it for
9 the moment, in matters relating to cigarettes, right,
10 sir?
11
A.
It was with respect to the Clinton
12 Administration's movement to push the FDA in that
13 direction, that's correct.
14
Q.
And you've already told us the outcome was
15 the FDA didn't get involved, according to you, never;
16 is that right, sir?
17 A. That's correct.
18 Q. One of the things you wrote is, "nor do we
19 know why teenagers in general smoke, although peer
20 pressure appears to be a frequently cited reason that
21 the new regulations will scarcely touch."
22 wrote that?
Right?
You
Right?
23 A. Yes, you scratched something out there.
24 Q. Yes, sir, Mr. Feiwus asked me to, and I
25 agree because it didn't have anything to do with these
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083646
1 questions.
2 A. All right.
That's okay.
3 Q. You talked about "the rectitude of the FDA
4 rules then lets Congress take the initiative in airing
5 the issues over tobacco's future."
It was your view
6 that's the way it should go down, Congress should be
7 involved, not the FDA?
8
A.
Congress is the legislative body.
It
9 created the warnings on cigarettes, and it should be
10 the body that establishes regulations, that's correct.
11
Q.
And you expressed in a national news
12 publication at that time also again the idea that the
13 jury was still out on the question of whether nicotine
14 was addictive in 1995, right, sir?
15 A. Well, you have to --
16 Q. Right, sir?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. Right.
19 A. But I have to explain that.
20 Q. Well, can we read your words first, and then
But --
21 you can explain?
22 A. I'll be happy to.
23 Q. "The FDA believes nicotine is an addictive
24 drug, but where's the evidence?
Addictive drugs make
25 the user clinically dependent, but thousands of smokers
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083647
1 have kicked cigarettes cold turkey, including this
2 writer, without the aftereffects that addiction
3 necessarily brings about."
4
And my only question to you, sir, is:
You
5 wrote that in 1995?
6 A. Right.
But you need the context.
7 Q. Sir, I didn't ask you about the context.
I
8 think Mr. Feiwus can do that.
9 A. All right.
10 Q. All right.
And it was around that time in
11 1995, sir, that lawyers, cigarette lawyers first
12 reached out to you, right?
13 A. I had not met with them then.
14 Q. Sir, wasn't it true that you were first
15 contacted by a lawyer representing a cigarette company
16 in approximately 1995?
17 A. Late 1995.
18 Q. Yes, sir.
I met with them in late 1995.
That's the same year we've been
19 discussing, right?
20
A.
21 August.
22
Q.
Yes.
But those articles are dated July and
That's not late.
Right.
They contacted you afterwards,
23 right?
24 A. I met with them afterwards.
25 Q. We're saying the same thing, sir.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-3408
I had only --3648
1
A.
No, sir.
I had not met them.
They called
2 me and they said could we talk about this.
And I did
3 not meet with them until October.
4
Q.
Well, let's just see if we can get the
5 chronology right.
Okay.
You with me?
6 A. Sure.
7 Q. You have two articles, right?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. One was July; is that right?
10 A. That is correct.
11 Q. You told us that.
Thank you for that.
One
12 was August?
13 A. That's correct.
14 Q. Is that late or mid 1995?
15 A. Well, I told you I didn't meet with them.
16 Q. Is that late or mid 1995?
17 A. It's mid.
18 Q. So the simple question is for you, sir, and
19 maybe we're saying the same thing:
Did you meet --
20 let me rephrase, account for your correction, and I
21 appreciate that.
22
Were you first contacted by the lawyers
23 representing cigarette manufacturers before or after
24 these articles appeared?
That's what I'm trying to
25 find out.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083649
1
A.
I was contacted by phone in a preliminary
2 fashion.
3 Q. Before or after?
4 A. Before.
5 Q. All right.
But you first met with them
6 after?
7 A. Afterwards.
8 Q. So they -- you're telling the jury that it
9 was before these articles appeared that they actually
10 reached out to you, right, sir?
11 A. That's right.
I --
12 Q. All right.
13 A. I did.
14 Q. And you told the jury that it was a law firm
15 that's depicted on one of these slides, the lawyer, do
16 you remember that?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. What's the name of that firm?
19 A. Johnson, Tyler & Purvis.
20 Q. Actually, sir, your sworn testimony is that
21 Mr. Purvis at that time was working at Shook, Hardy &
22 Bacon, right, sir?
23 A. Yes, but it was formed --
24 Q. Right, sir?
25 A. He was.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083650
1
Q.
Thank you.
And, now, the meeting that you
2 had with the lawyer from Shook, Hardy & Bacon, was that
3 before or after the articles appeared, sir?
4 A. After.
5 Q. All right.
Thank you.
I think you told
6 Mr. Feiwus as part of your review, while you are
7 familiar with online resources that allow for the
8 research of previously internal company documents, you
9 have not, as part of your work, made use of any of
10 those resources and have not evaluated any documents?
11 A. That's correct.
12 Q. From the files of the manufacturers
13 themselves; right, sir?
14 A. That is correct.
15 Q. Just to put a little bit of a fine point on
16 the work that you've done previously, I think you said
17 this is the eighth case in which you've appeared?
18 A. In trial.
19 Q. How many of those were you in the position
20 where you are now where Mr. Len Feiwus was asking you
21 the same questions, similar questions that you heard
22 today, sir?
23
A.
I started with Mr. Feiwus in a case called
24 Mattern, which was in a totally different jurisdiction,
25 which was Missouri.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083651
1 Q. I just asked the number of cases.
2 A. I don't --
3 Q. I don't want to know anything about them or
4 where they were.
Number of cases?
5 A. I'd have to add them up in my mind.
6 Q. That will be fine.
7 A. Okay?
8 Q. Yes, sir.
9 A. I count three.
10 Q. All right, sir.
There may be four.
And do you remember earlier
11 in your -- in direct examination you showed a ring
12 around the globe with some arrows, and you went around
13 and talked about all those sources that are available?
14 A. I do.
15 Q. All right.
16 changes to it.
I just -- I've made a few
I hope you don't mind.
And just bear
17 with me, if you would, please, because I want to ask
18 you if whether or not certain things that appear in my
19 handwriting, which is the messy handwriting
20 and Mr. Gustafson's, which is a little bit neater,
21 we've added those.
22
And I just want to ask you whether during
23 Ms. Westmoreland's lifetime whether or not those were
24 also part of her information environment.
25 going to be my question each time, sir.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-3408
And that's
All right?3652
1 A. Okay.
2 Q. If it appears that industry representatives
3 were quoted in newspapers like the New York Times,
4 would you agree that that was part of the information
5 environment?
6 A. Yes.
And it was included.
7 Q. All right.
Would you agree that if there is
8 evidence that manufacturers spoke publicly about their
9 products and the health risks of smoking that that was
10 part of the information environment?
11 A. Absolutely.
12 Q. All right.
Have you ever undertaken to
13 review the press releases of the various advocacy and
14 scientific organizations associated with the tobacco
15 industry in the '50s, '60s, '70s or '80s, sir?
16 A. Press releases are not publications.
17 Q. I didn't ask you whether they were
18 publications.
19 A. They --
20 Q. My question to you, sir, was have you ever
21 looked at them?
22 A. No, because they're not publications.
23 Q. Thank you.
Have you ever attempted to
24 compare press releases of the industry with the same
25 kinds of publications that you have identified here,
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083653
1 like newspapers and magazines, to check your work and
2 see if they made it in there?
3
A.
If they made it in there, I would know
4 through my actual press coverage.
5
Q.
All right.
Well, I think we're going to
6 test that a little bit in a while.
7 A. Okay.
8 Q. But you would agree with me that it would be
9 useful to look at a tobacco industry press release, the
10 date of it, and search in the New York Times or other
11 publications to see if those comments made it in there,
12 right?
13 A. No.
No.
14 Q. That wouldn't be useful?
15 A. That wouldn't be useful.
16 Q. All right.
Would it be useful to know
17 whether or not their comments made it into those
18 publications?
19 A. I would know.
20 Q. All right.
Well, we're going to check on
21 that.
22 A. Okay.
23 Q. I'm just asking you whether it would be
24 useful.
25
A.
That's good.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083654
1 Q. All right.
You agree?
2 A. No, I didn't agree.
3 Q. You don't agree that it would be useful to
4 know whether their comments made it into those
5 publications?
6
A.
If their comments made it into the
7 publication, I would know it from my review.
8
Q.
All right.
9 asking you now, is:
And my question, which I'm
Would you agree that it would be
10 useful for the work that you've done in this case to,
11 in fact, know the answer to whether they appeared in
12 those publications?
13
A.
The answer is that if it did appear, I would
14 have looked at it.
15
Q.
And would it be useful to know whether it
16 appeared?
17 A. Everything is useful.
18 Q. All right.
19
Thank you, sir.
Packaging, would you agree that information
20 contained on cigarette packaging contained -- was part
21 of the information environment for this particular
22 smoker in the '50s, '60s and thereafter?
23
A.
If the information that was related on the
24 packaging dealt with issues relating to smoking risks,
25 yes.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083655
1
Q.
All right.
Well, let's talk a little.
But
2 no other information would be part of her environment?
3 A. No.
4 Q. Okay.
So the way the cigarette appeared,
5 the packaging, the coloring, those are irrelevant,
6 right?
7 A. They are irrelevant, right.
8 Q. All right.
Let's take a look at this.
You
9 talked about this.
10 A. I can't read it.
11 Q. Okay.
Let me see if I can help you.
12 Baron, will I be able to -- there we go.
13 I will represent to you and show you in a
14 moment that this is a package of Lark cigarettes.
Will
15 you accept that, sir?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. Can you tell the members of the jury because
18 of what you know about what warnings appeared when,
19 when this cigarette package was likely sold, the time
20 frame?
And I'll direct you, "is dangerous."
When was
21 that, sir?
22
A.
On November 1, 1970 all the way to
23 October 11th, 1984 -- '85.
24
Q.
All right.
So certainly because you showed
25 the jury the same information, that information
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083656
1 contained on the packaging would have been part of
2 Ms. Westmoreland's information environment, right?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. All right.
And then you would agree also,
5 sir, that something that was much larger on the back of
6 the pack every time she opened up one of these, that
7 was part of her information environment, right?
8 A. Not with regard to health risks.
9 Q. Why not?
Wait.
Don't read it.
You'd never
10 even read the back of this package?
11 A. I just read it.
You put it on there.
12 Q. Before I just put it on there, had you ever
13 read it?
14 A. I just read it now.
15 Q. Before I put it up there, had you?
16 A. No.
You asked me to take a look at it.
I
17 read it.
18
Q.
Your eyes are faster than my hands.
Sorry
19 about that.
20
"Lark's filter has two outer tar and
21 nicotine filters."
22
Were these cigarettes filtering out
23 cigarette and tar, sir?
You don't know, do you?
24 A. Excuse me?
25 Q. Were these cigarettes in this package
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083657
1 filtering out tar and nicotine?
2 A. You have to read the rest of it.
3 Q. You don't know, do you?
4
THE WITNESS:
5
He's arguing with me.
Your
Honor, may I answer the question?
6
MR. FEIWUS:
7
Objection, Your Honor.
The
question is --
8
THE WITNESS:
9
You're not letting me answer
the question.
10 THE COURT:
11 MR. FEIWUS:
12
Just a minute.
Mr. Feiwus.
Beyond the scope.
He's not
here testifying about cigarette design.
13
MR. SALES:
I'm not asking about design.
14 I'm asking about the claim on the package that's
15 part of the environment which he just admitted
16 to.
17
THE COURT:
I'll allow it.
18 BY MR. SALES:
19
Q.
20
Let's start over, if we can, all right, sir?
THE COURT:
Overruled.
21 BY MR. SALES:
22 Q. Ready, Doctor?
23 A. Let's go.
24 Q. All right.
You see this, "Lark's filter has
25 two outer tar and nicotine filters."
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083658
1
Let's stop right there.
Okay?
Stop right
2 there.
3
A.
We can't stop.
You got to read the whole
4 thing.
5 Q. But I get to cross you, sir.
6 A. Well, it is, but you also have to be fair.
7 This deals with taste.
That's my job.
It has nothing to do with
8 health issues.
9
THE COURT:
Sir, sir, he gets to cross you.
10 You'll -- if the party that called you wants to
11 do so, he'll have the opportunity to give you a
12 chance to explain and flesh things out.
13 THE WITNESS:
14 THE COURT: 15 THE WITNESS:
16 THE COURT: So, Mr. Sales, the question is?
17 MR. SALES: I've forgotten, Judge.
18
Okay.
Go ahead, Mr. Sales.
Okay.
I'll
start over.
19
THE COURT:
Okay.
20 BY MR. SALES:
21
Q.
Do you agree, sir, that the words up to the
22 comma are, yes or no, "Lark's filter has two outer tar
23 and nicotine filters?"
Did I read that right?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. You don't know, do you, sir, whether or not
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083659
1 this cigarette filter filtered out any tar or nicotine,
2 do you?
3 MR. FEIWUS:
Objection.
4 THE WITNESS:
5 that question.
6 THE COURT:
7 THE WITNESS:
8 THE COURT:
9 MR. FEIWUS:
I'm not qualified to answer
Hold it.
That's beyond my expertise.
Is that withdrawn, Mr. Feiwus?
Yes, Your Honor.
10 BY MR. SALES:
11
Q.
And are you telling the jury that this has
12 no bearing on any information about the health risks
13 associated with the consumption of this product, the
14 portion that I just read?
Is that what you're telling
15 the jury, sir?
16
A.
I'm telling the jury that I'm not competent
17 to make a statement -- I'm not an expert in terms of
18 tar and filter charcoals.
You're asking the wrong
19 person.
20
Q.
All right.
"Plus an inner chamber of tiny
21 charcoal granules specially treated to smooth the taste
22 in a way no other filter can!"
Exclamation point.
23 read that right, didn't I?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. That was part of this lady's information
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-3408
I3660
1 environment, wasn't it?
2
A.
But it's in a field that I'm ill equipped to
3 make a --
4
Q.
I didn't ask about your qualifications.
Are
5 you an expert in the information environment?
6
A.
Not about filters and not about tar and not
7 about nicotine from a scientific standpoint.
8
Q.
All right.
Let's just look at the words
9 that are on the slide.
You told the jury you prepared,
10 right, "information environment," right?
11 That's you, right?
Quotes.
Right?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Are you an expert on the information
14 environment?
15
A.
With regard to materials that are publicly
16 explicable and nonscientific with respect to filters
17 and tar and nicotine.
These are scientific statements.
18 I'm not equipped to make a particular opinion on.
19
Q.
My question is much simpler than that, sir,
20 respectfully.
My question is, every time this lady
21 pulled open a pack, saw that on there, was that part of
22 her information environment?
23 A. I don't know.
24 Q. Let's take a look at one that's a little
25 different.
And I'll show you first the warning label,
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083661
1 it's got the "is dangerous" language on there.
Can you
2 tell us based upon your knowledge, training and
3 experience when that is likely the time frame when --
4
A.
October 12th, 1970 to -- excuse me.
5 November 1, 1970 to October 12th, 1985.
6
Q.
Will you agree that it was part of
7 Ms. Westmoreland's information environment that there
8 were 20 cigarettes in this package?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. Will you agree that it was part of her
11 information environment that the brand name was Lark?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Will you agree that it was part of her
14 information environment that these were filtered
15 cigarettes?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. Will you agree, whatever it means, that part
18 of her information environment was that the cigarettes
19 were with the Gas-Trap trademark filter?
20 A. Don't know what that means.
21 Q. I said, would you agree that it was part of
22 her information environment, whatever it means?
23 A. Whatever it means.
24 Q. All right.
Now my question to you is:
25 you ever looked at advertising for that phrase or
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-3408
Have3662
1 expression which the company had trademarked to see
2 what they were telling consumers about what it meant to
3 have Gas-Traps?
4 A. That's outside my area of expertise.
5 Q. So you didn't look at that?
6 A. It's outside my area of expertise.
7 Q. So you didn't look at it?
8 A. I didn't know.
9 Q. All right.
You would agree, would you not,
10 whatever weight you give to it, that advertising that
11 was available publicly was part of this lady's
12 information environment, right?
13 A. I would not agree.
14 Q. Okay.
Now, when we turn this over, there's
15 a little bit of a different statement here on the back.
16 Would you agree on the back of this, again, the
17 information that there were 20 cigarettes in the pack,
18 that that was part of her information environment?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. And, again, the name, that was part of her
21 information environment, right?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. And then the statement, "Only Lark has a
24 Gas-Trap filter, U.S. Patent Number 3,251,365, with two
25 outer tar and nicotine filters plus an inner gas filter
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083663
1 of activated charcoal granules.
These charcoal
2 granules reduce certain harsh gasses" -- hard to say --
3 "in the way ordinary filters do not.
You'll appreciate
4 the difference this filter makes after your first
5 pack."
6
Every time she picked this up, that was part
7 of her information environment, wasn't it, sir?
8 A. I don't know.
9 Q. Okay.
How about the picture where it says,
10 "tar" in quotes, "and nicotine filter number one, gas
11 filter" and then "tar and nicotine filter number two."
12 You see that diagram on the bottom there?
13 A. I do.
14 Q. That was part of her information
15 environment, wasn't it, sir?
16 A. I don't know.
17 Q. All right.
Let's work our way around
18 clockwise like ya'll did on direct examination.
I have
19 a few other items for you.
20
Now, you're aware, sir, that some of the
21 science that was conducted in the '50s, '60s, '70s and
22 '80s was supported by organizations that were paid for
23 by the tobacco industry, right?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. And to the extent those matters were
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083664
1 commented upon publicly in newspapers, that was part of
2 the information environment, wasn't it, sir?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. Now let's talk about doctors.
Do you agree,
5 because you've drawn an arrow from doctors, that
6 doctors in the public and in private were part of the
7 information environment of smokers during that same
8 time period?
9 A. They were.
10 Q. And you talked a little bit about something
11 that the AMA did in the 1960s in your direct
12 examination, sir.
Do you remember that?
13 A. No.
Remind me.
14 Q. Well, let me ask you about this.
Are you
15 familiar through any source what the relationship was
16 between the tobacco industry and the medical
17 profession, and specifically, the AMA during the period
18 of time that you've been talking about, '50s, '60s,
19 '70s?
20 A. It wasn't in the press.
21 Q. It wasn't in the press?
22 A. It wasn't in the press.
23 Q. Would you be interested to know whether, for
24 example, the AMA's opinions expressed publicly about
25 matters of smoking and health were influenced by the
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083665
1 tobacco industry?
Would you be interested?
2 A. Not unless it were in the press.
3 Q. All right, sir.
4 advertising.
5
You talked about
We can skip over that.
And you've got television on there.
You
6 agree, do you not, sir, that at various points in time
7 in the '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s, that representatives
8 of the tobacco industry appeared on television to give
9 the industry's view about matters relating to smoking
10 and health?
11 A. On occasion.
12 Q. All right.
We've seen "See It Now."
And
13 you told Mr. Feiwus that they were in that, right?
14 A. Yes, sir.
15 Q. And the -- we can look at clips, if you
16 like.
But one of the messages was that there was
17 uncertainty about whether cigarettes caused disease,
18 right?
19 A. Time frame?
Time frame.
20 Q. "See It Now," 1955, I think it was.
21 A. There was -- there was uncertainty.
They
22 argued there was statistical association.
23
Q.
And one of things that was in there was a
24 statement -- do you remember a fellow named DuPuis, a
25 Dr. DuPuis?
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083666
1 A. No.
2 Q. You don't remember him?
3 A. No.
4 Q. You don't remember someone who worked for, I
5 think it was Philip Morris, saying that, "If we find
6 something bad in cigarettes, we'll take it out?"
You
7 remember that, don't you?
8
A.
9
No, I do not.
MR. SALES:
Do you have that, Baron?
10 BY MR. SALES:
11
Q.
Let me ask you.
You didn't just watch the
12 parts of this show that you showed the jury, right?
13 A. Absolutely not.
14 Q. And when was the last time you reviewed it?
15 A. About six months ago.
16
17
MR. SALES:
I watched the whole thing.
Let's take a look at Dr. DuPuis.
(Video clip was played and taken down to the best
18 of the reporter's ability as follows:)
19
DR. DUPUIS:
So far we've found none that
20 would give us any cause for concern.
21 find any that we consider harmful, and so far we
22 have not, we will remove these from smoke..."

If we do

25
Q.
It's a very brief clip, but does that
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083667
1 refresh your recollection, sir?
2 A. Yes, it was very brief.
3 Q. All right.
But you remember now that, among
4 other things, Dr. DuPuis told that same Edward R.
5 Murrow audience that if they found anything in smoke
6 that was bad, they'd take it out, right?
7 A. Right.
8 Q. And that wasn't the only time that they said
9 that, right?
10 A. I don't recall.
11 Q. All right.
Do you remember seeing -- do you
12 remember you told the jury that when the Surgeon
13 General's report came out, it was big news, it was
14 covered in a major way in all the networks?
Do you
15 remember that?
16 A. That's correct.
17 Q. And you showed the jury part of an NBC
18 special, right?
19 A. Yes, sir.
20 Q. And having been working on this for a while,
21 you've also watched the CBS report, right?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Before we go to that, actually, let me ask
24 you something else.
If we go back to Edward R. Murrow
25 1955 "See It Now," one of the things that happened on
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083668
1 that show was also that there was a representative of
2 the American Medical Association who spoke.
Do you
3 remember that?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. Do you remember what he said or she said?
6 A. Not at this point.
7 Q. All right.
Somebody watching it, if they
8 were watching it back in the 1950s, would take comfort
9 after they heard the words of the American Medical
10 Association representative, wouldn't they, sir?
11 A.
I'd like to see it.
12 Q.
All right.
13 (Video clip was played and taken down to the best
Let's take a look.
14 of the reporter's ability as follows:)
15
MR. MURROW:
Next Tuesday, Dr. Elmer Hess of
16 Erie, Pennsylvania becomes president of the
17 American Medical Association.
18 however, as a physician who does not believe
19 there is any important relationship between
20 smoking and cancer.
21
22
23
He speaks now,
How do you account for the rise in lung
cancer?
DR. HESS:
Well, I think -- I don't think
24 smoking cigarettes particularly has anything
25 much to do with it in the first place.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083669
1 MR. MURROW:
2 DR. HESS:
Are you a smoker, Dr. Hess?
Yes.
I can't see where it's done
3 me a great deal of harm.
4 be a smelly, dirty and very expensive habit.
5 I've been a smoker all my life.
6 periods where I have quit smoking.
7 my life, I've smoked and I've enjoyed smoking.
8 I would rather myself live 15 very, very active,
9 productive years than live 25 years as a potato.
10
Cigarette smoking may
There have been
But all of

11 BY MR. SALES:
12
Q.
As a potato.
You couldn't forget that,
13 right?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. All right.
And you agree that somebody
16 who -- talking about the '50s, of course -- watches
17 that might take some comfort knowing that the guy who
18 was just about to be the head of AMA didn't seem too
19 alarmed, did he?
20
A.
No, because the other statements were more
21 forceful.
22 Q. All right.
23 A. His were not scientific.
His were off the
24 head.
25
Q.
Yeah.
And do you know how it was that
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083670
1 somebody from the AMA or who was about to become
2 president of the AMA could come in and weigh in in such
3 a cavalier way at that time?
4 A. You should ask the doctors, not me.
5 Q. All right.
All right.
Or perhaps look at
6 internal company documents to see how that could
7 happen, right?
8 A. It's not within my expertise, Mr. Sales.
9 Q. All right.
10
Yes, sir.
Now, we were talking about the CBS report.
11 You watched that as well?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. And do you remember a fellow who appeared on
14 there and gave an interview on behalf of the industry?
15 A. Let's see it.
16 Q. I asked you, do you remember?
17 A. I don't remember all of these.
18 see it.
19
Q.
But let's
Bring it before my attention.
I'm just asking you to test your memory a
20 little, if you don't mind.
Do you remember if there
21 was such a person?
22 A. I believe there was.
23 Q. Do you remember who it was?
24 A. I do not.
25 Q. Do you remember what his stature was within
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083671
1 the industry?
2
A.
3 Hartnett.
There are several.
Could have been William [sic] Cullman,
4 George V. Allen.
5
Q.
Could have been Timothy
I'm not certain.
Let's see it.
We're in the '60s now, all right, sir, not
6 the '50s.
7
A.
You remember last time we talked was 1955,
8 "See It Now."
9
Q.
I went to CBS, Reasoner, 1964 "See It Now."
10 You with me now?
11 A.
All right.
Yes.
12 Q.
Let's go ahead and play that.
13 (Video clip was played and taken down to the best
14 of the reporter's ability as follows:)
15
MR. CULLMAN:
I'm convinced that eventually
16 they will find some elements through a filter or
17 through leaf growing or a special type of seed
18 growing that will eliminate the mysterious thing
19 we are looking.
20 just as much as the Surgeon General, the AMA,
21 and we'll cooperate in every way.
22
We want to be the detective
Well, are you saying, then, sir, that there
23 is something toxic about tobacco or -- which are
24 removable by filter?
25 MR. CULLMAN:
Well, obviously, a filter
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083672
1 takes out certain tar and nicotine.
2 think the industry admits there are any bad
3 elements. 4 laboratories, through the Surgeon General,
5 through the AMA, through acts of God and the
6 like, we hope you may find them. And if they
7 are found, they will be removed. But at this
8 point, we do not know it."
9
I don't
If there are bad elements, through

10 BY MR. SALES:
11 Q. Do you know who that is, sir?
12 A. I think that's Mr. Cullman.
13 Q. Right, Howard.
14 Hugh Cullman.
I think they call him
That was certainly part of the
15 information environment in the 1960s, right?
16
A.
That's right.
That was part of it.
There
17 were many other spokesmen who differed with him.
18
Q. I'm just asking you if that was a part of
20 A. It was, a minor part.
21 Q. It was minor because the message was that
19 it.
22 cigarettes might not be harmful, so it was minor?
23
A.
No.
That all of the other representatives
24 did not go along with that opinion.
25
Q.
So if we watch the whole show, that's the
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083673
1 conclusion that we would draw from it?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. All right.
Let's talk about the 1970s.
Did
4 representatives of the tobacco industry sometimes
5 appear on national television in the 1970s?
6 A. On occasion.
7 Q. All right.
8 A. Could be George V. Allen, Timothy Hartnett,
Do you remember anybody who did?
9 Horace Kornegay.
10
Q.
All right.
Those are -- those are some.
11 But let's talk about a fellow named Joe Cullman, Joseph
12 S. Cullman, III.
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Do you remember him?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. What was his stature within the tobacco
17 industry in 1971, do you know?
18
A.
19 "stature."
I don't even know what you mean by
20
Q.
He was one of the spokespeople.
All right.
Well, he was president by that
21 time and CEO of Philip Morris, right?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. And he was by that time, or do you know, a
24 member of the executive committee in The Tobacco
25 Institute, right, sir?
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083674
1 A. I can't hear you.
2 Q. Do you know whether at that time, sir, he
3 was a member of the executive committee of The Tobacco
4 Institute?
5 A. I think he was.
6 Q. All right.
You talked about some particular
7 publications as having stature, right?
8 that like the New York Times.
You remember
That's an important
9 paper during the period of time that we've been talking
10 about, right, sir?
11 A. It is.
12 Q. And certain news shows where we live in an
13 era today with many, many channels, but in the '50s,
14 '60s and '70s, our programming opportunities were much
15 more limited, right?
16
A.
Not necessarily.
17 three mentioned.
18
Q.
You have three -- you had
There's news copies.
And one of the longest running television
19 shows, I think even today, is a show called Face The
20 Nation, right, sir?
21 A. It is.
22 Q. And you remember that one?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. Mr. Cullman appeared on Face The Nation in
25 1971, didn't he?
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083675
1
A.
2
All right.
He may have.
3 Q. All right.
You don't remember that one?
4 A. I don't remember it.
5 Q. Do you -- if I ask you whether someone
6 watching it as part of their information environment
7 might have taken comfort in someone so highly placed in
8 the industry, would you be able to answer that
9 question, sir?
10
A.
I would say that by 1971, there is little
11 comfort in terms of the statements of The Tobacco
12 Institute.
13 Q.
Okay.
Let's play that, if we could, please.
14 (Video clip was played and taken down to the best
15 of the reporter's ability as follows:)
16
JOSEPH CULLMAN, III:
We do not believe that
17 cigarettes are hazardous.
18 Because when, as and if, any ingredient in
19 cigarette smoke is identified as being injurious
20 to human health, we are confident that we can
21 eliminate that ingredient.
22
MR. HINTZ:
23 are safe?
24 Mr. Cullman?
25
We don't accept that.
Do you believe that cigarettes
Have they been proven to be safe,
MR. CULLMAN:
I believe they have not been
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083676
1
2
proven to be unsafe.
(Video clip concluded.)
3 BY MR. SALES:
4
Q.
And somebody watching that in 1971 as part
5 of their information environment would take comfort in
6 the words of Mr. Cullman, wouldn't they, sir?
7 A. No.
8 Q. All right.
9
MR. SALES:
10
Your Honor, may I approach the
witness, Your Honor?
11 THE COURT: You may.
12 MR. SALES: I don't know if you want one of
13
these or not, Judge.
14 THE COURT: I do.
15 MR. SALES: Thank you.
16 BY MR. SALES:
17
Q.
Do you recognize the thing that I've handed
18 you, Doctor?
19 A. Yes, this is my reliance list.
20 Q. All right.
And the reliance list is
21 something that when Mr. Bass took your deposition that
22 you provided to him, right?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. And what it is is -- terrible grammar,
25 pardon me, everyone -- it is a list of the things,
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083677
1 among others perhaps, as you indicated, that you have
2 relied on in the formation of your opinions, right?
3 A. A partial list.
4 Q. All right.
Can we tell by just looking at
5 the list whether or not there are things that you've
6 testified about today that are not on this list, or do
7 you believe the things that we've shown the jury are,
8 by and large, on the list?
9 A. There may be some that aren't on the list.
10 Q. This list -- and I'm making an assumption,
11 so please correct me if I'm wrong -- was not created
12 just for the purposes of this lawsuit, right, sir?
13 A. No, sir.
14 Q. This is kind of a work in progress.
You've
15 probably added to it over time?
16 A. That is correct.
17 Q. Have you deleted anything from your reliance
18 list over time?
19
A.
Not to my knowledge.
But I can't speak in
20 terms of the many cases that I've had.
21
Q.
All right.
Let's talk a little bit about
22 the methods, because you -- you've discussed that some
23 with Mr. Feiwus.
The methods that you used, for
24 example, in discussing the review of the New York
25 Times.
Remember you told us you sat in the cubicle,
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083678
1 and I don't remember where it was, but you sat in a
2 cubicle and spun the microphones over days and days --
3 years, I think, right?
4 A. That's correct.
5 Q. Now, I've read, and correct me if I'm wrong,
6 that you not only looked at the front page, but you
7 looked at the second page, you reviewed the entire
8 first page section -- excuse me -- main section of the
9 paper, all the way down to the sports, lifestyle,
10 classified, right?
11
A.
Well, I explained that to Mr. Bass in my
12 deposition.
I looked at all of the those articles that
13 would catch one's attention relative to the smoking
14 risks of cancer.
And I reference such terms as
15 "cigarettes," "cancer," "tobacco" and "lung cancer."
16 Q. All right.
17 A. So if there were a story, for example, on
18 the Boston Red Sox selling an agent, I wouldn't look at
19 it.
20
Q.
All right.
What if there were a story about
21 Joe Cullman, the same guy we just saw, talking about
22 the hazards of cigarette smoking and being quoted by
23 the New York Times, would you have flagged that?
24 A. I would like to see it.
25 Q. Well, that isn't what I asked you.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-3408
What I3679
1 asked you respectfully, sir, is if you saw Joe Cullman
2 talking in the paper about the hazards of cigarette
3 smoking, was that the kind of thing that would have
4 drawn your attention and you would have gotten a copy
5 of, right?
6 A. Absolutely, unless I missed it.
7 Q. All right.
8 A. Absolutely, sure.
9 Q. And I just want to find out from you, if we
10 can, what is the chronological period of time for the
11 New York Times that you covered, sir?
12
A.
Well, we covered it depending upon the
13 particular case during the time frame usually from the
14 period of the 1920s through the period of a particular
15 person's lifetime.
16
Q.
All right.
And, clearly, the area of
17 interest in this case for you has included not only the
18 period of time with of Ms. Westmoreland's life from the
19 '50s to the '90s --
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. -- but also a period of time well before
22 that time, right?
23 A. Well, some years before, sure, absolutely.
24 Q. So if there were articles in the 1960s,
25 let's say, as an example, where Mr. Cullman or other
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083680
1 representatives of the tobacco industry were quoted
2 about the risks of smoking and health, you would have
3 picked those -- pick up on that, right?
4
A.
I would have picked them up or I could have
5 missed them.
If there were a large number of them, it
6 would have been an egregious error on my part.
7 Q. All right.
8 A. If there were a few, then I would not be
9 concerned.
10
Q.
How many do we get to before we find an
11 egregious error on your part?
12 A. 50.
13 Q. How many?
14 A. 50.
15 Q. Five zero?
16 A. 50.
17 Q. Okay.
18 A. 15 over a long period of time.
What about 15?
It depends
19 upon the time period.
20 Q. All right.
21 A. Remember this is a partial list.
Sometimes
22 I eliminated a particular article because it was
23 covered by a tobacco industry statement in another
24 form.
25
Q.
And as we go along in working on this, you
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083681
1 have a reliance list available, so is it organized in
2 such a way, if I were to ask you, do you have on there
3 an article of such and such a date appearing in the New
4 York Times that you'll be able to tell us quickly?
5 A. No, I'd have to go through the whole thing.
6 Q. Well, isn't it chronologically organized?
7 A. No.
8 Q. It's not?
9 A. No.
10 Q. Let's take a look.
You see how there's this
11 column, the second column over there?
12
A.
Yeah.
But it bounces back and forth.
For
13 the New York Times, which doesn't begin until --
14
Q.
Just look at the second column of the page
15 that I highlighted at random.
Do you see that?
Don't
16 you have date codes there, sir, like 4926, that would
17 be November 26th 1990, 1966 and so forth, don't you
18 have that, sir?

14 whole thing on the screen and we can read it in
15 part.
16 this is cross-examination.
We have provided --
17 we have provided -- sorry.
Go ahead.
18
But I don't have them all that way, and
THE COURT:
Do you have -- I assume the
19 parties -- to the extent that the full articles
20 are available, the parties have had the
21 opportunity from disclosure to obtain --
22
23
24
25
MR. SALES:
Yes, they all have exhibit
numbers.
MR. FEIWUS:
I don't have a problem.
In
fact, counsel has handed me some of the articles

(888)811-34083687
1 he intends to use.
2 he's going to provide them to the witness when
3 he's asking him questions.
4
THE COURT:
I'm just making sure that
Well, to the extent you have an
5 article, to the extent you have the whole thing,
6 provide the whole thing when you inquire about
7 it.

10
MR. SALES:
I will. Some I do, and some I
don't.
THE COURT:
Yeah, I understand that.
And
11 you know, I'm -- I may be a judge, but I can't
12 make you do what you cannot do, right?
13 MR. SALES: Right.
14 THE COURT: Okay.
15 MR. SALES: Thank you, Your Honor.
16 THE COURT: Let's go head in that way, and
17 if that should lead to something else you find
18 objectionable, Mr. Feiwus, you know where to
19 find me.
20 bring them in.
Okay.
We're good to go?
Okay.

Let's
Jurors in the jury box, Your

More power to you.

So with
3 BY MR. SALES:
4 Q. You ready to get back to work, Dr. DiBacco?
5 A. I am.
6 Q. All right.
We were looking on the overhead
7 display and I was asking you some questions about a
8 document that was described by you as your reliance
9 list.
10 A. Right.
11 Q. Do you remember that?
12 A. Yes, sir.
13 Q. All right.
And one of the things that I
14 asked you was whether or not -- can you pull that back
15 up, Baron?
16
MR. PHILIPSON:
I'm sorry?
17 BY MR. SALES:
18
Q.
-- whether or not I asked you if the date
19 codes that appear in the second column --
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. -- would permit you to look and see if
22 articles that I'm going to ask you about are contained
23 in your reliance list.
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. All right.
And the question remains:
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-3408
Can3689
1 you?
2 A. Yes.
I have it in front of me.
3 Q. All right.
So, Mr. Philipson, if we can
4 switch for a moment to the demo PDEMO2, which is a
5 demonstrative exhibit that has some headlines, first
6 we're going to start in the 1950s, in the New York
7 Times, sir, all right?
You'll recognize the
8 characteristic print of the New York Times, right?
9 A. I'm looking at it, sir.
10 Q. All right.
What I'd like you to do is just
11 scroll down your reliance list, just look at the dates
12 for now. Okay?
You with me, sir?
13 A. I see them.
14 Q. All right.
Well, you're going to need to
15 look at your reliance list.
16 A. Okay.
17 Q. And I'll direct you, the 1953, looks like
18 it's on the second page.
19 A. 1953.
20 Q. All right.
21 A. I do.
22 Q. All right.
All right?
You see in 1953 there?
The first one is November 27,
23 1953 --
24 A. Okay.
25 Q. -- from the New York Times.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083690
1 A. All right.
2 Q. Is that on there?
3 A. No, I don't see it.
4 Q. All right.
It's not, right?
The next one is May 17, 1955.
5 Let's turn the page.
6 A. Okay.
7 Q. Actually, it's the same page.
May -- I have
8 May 21, something from TIME, "Medicine Smoke and
9 Cancer," that's there, right?
10 something from LIFE, right?
And then I have May 6,
You with me, sir?
11 A. No, I'm not.
12 Q. Okay.
13 A. I have May 17th, 1955.
Is that where we are
14 now?
15
Q.
16 sorry.
That's where we are.
And I misspoke.
I'm
You have May -- you have April 12 -- sorry.
17 Wrong again.
You have May 31 and nothing before that
18 in May of 1955, right?
19 A. I don't see it there.
20 Q. All right.
21 A. I'm looking at the back page too, back page
22 is Mr. -- some of these we inserted in the back.
23
Q.
I see.
Do we need to cross-check on the
24 back pages?
25
MR. FEIWUS:
Your Honor, I think the problem
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083691
1 is that the list is not actually in
2 chronological order.
3
THE COURT:
There are --
Approach.
4 SIDEBAR CONFERENCE:
5 (The following proceedings were had before the
6 Court outside the presence of the jury:)
7
THE COURT:
I want to reiterate if it's an
8 objection that's not something familiar like
9 leading, asked and answered, irrelevant,
10 hearsay, I want to go up here.
11 about why it's not fair.
12 chronological order.
No speeches
It looks like it's in
13 MR. FEIWUS:
14 looking through it.
15 of different lists that we had over time, so
16 that there are -- it runs chronologically for
17 two or three pages, then there's another one
18 that runs chronologically for two or three
19 pages.
20
It is not, Your Honor.
I was
This is actually an amalgam
But then it's also not a complete list.
This is really a reliance list that reflects
21 the materials that we had gave them for the
22 demonstratives today.
23 It's just a list of --
24
25
THE COURT:
It's not comprehensive.
I think he's trying to elicit
the fact that the witness is aware of other
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083692
1 things in the press and arriving at the -- in
2 arriving at his opinions.
3 to do that.
4 think -- the rhetorical point about the list has
5 probably been made.
6 these articles, whether he knows them?
7
I think he's entitled
But I -- do you -- do you -- I
MR. SALES:
Can't you just ask about
I can.
And I will represent to
8 the Court we've converted it into a PDF and
9 searched for everything I'm going to ask about,
10 and none of them are in there that I'm going to
11 ask about.
12 we'll figure out a way to show that to the jury.
13 I will concede that will save a lot of time.
14
15
16
Maybe he'll just agree.
THE COURT:
And if not,
How many items are on that list,
10,000?
MR. SALES:
Ten.
Oh, yeah.
There are many
17 things on there counsel didn't even talk about
18 today.
19
THE COURT:
I know that.
I know that.
But
20 I mean, what I'm saying is if you -- if it's not
21 exactly chronological, if hypothetically some of
22 these are lurking anywhere, you know, it really
23 presents a problem in terms of searching for it.
24
25
MR. SALES:
he's right.
In fairness to counsel, I think
I looked at the back, and there are
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083693
1 a series of chronological lists is the way I
2 look at it.
3
MR. GUSTAFSON:
4
That's why we're doing a
media search electronically.
5
THE COURT:
I understand that.
But unless
6 you're going to reopen and put on your tech
7 person or something, that won't be evidence, I
8 don't think.
9 way to do it.

MR. SALES:

We can ask while we're examining
I've done that before.
12
THE COURT:
13
You know, unless you figure some
You could?
Give them the PDF
and represent to him --
14
MR. SALES:
15
there.
16
Maybe.
THE COURT:
Maybe he'll agree they're not on
I doubt it.
Find your way.
But, I mean, I
17 don't -- I'm just saying I don't want you
18 testifying, okay.
19 misrepresent the list that it's incomplete or
20 incomplete and chronological as it was handed to
21 him.
22
MR. SALES:
And I don't want him to
Okay.
23 BY MR. SALES:
24
Q.
25 I'm sorry.
Dr. DiBacco, if I may, to orient us, to --
May I proceed, Your Honor?
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083694
1
THE COURT:
Yes.
2 BY MR. SALES:
3
Q.
Just to orient us, if I may, this is the
4 list that was prepared in advance of your deposition
5 and provided to Mr. Bass as part of the deposition
6 process, right?
7 A. That's correct.
8 Q. And if anything was deleted from the list
9 that you have collected in the past, that isn't
10 anything the plaintiffs did.
That's something that you
11 did, right?
12
A.
I don't remember any of these articles being
13 on any of my lists.
14
Q.
Okay.
Well, you're getting ahead of me a
15 little bit.
16 A. Okay.
17 Q. Just to -- if anything was ever deleted from
18 your reliance list --
19 A. I'd know about it.
20 Q. -- that wasn't something we did?
21 A. No.
22 Q. That was something you did, right?
23 A. No, no.
24 Q. So looking at PDEM02 -- I think you've
25 caught up with me now, and I appreciate you're getting
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083695
1 ahead of me a little bit.
2 hold on.
3 1957.
November 27, that one --
May 17, 1955, August 2, 1956, November 19,
You're satisfied that those are not on your
4 list, right?
5
A.
I'm satisfied that they are not on my list.
6 And I apologize.
7
Q.
8 next one.
They should be.
That's all right.
Let's take a look at the
And you do agree -- we don't have to go
9 through every one -- that these articles, include
10 statements from representatives of the tobacco industry
11 about some of the issues we've been speaking of?
12
A.
But they're also duplicative.
They're also
13 included in other articles.
14
Q.
I didn't ask if they were duplicates.
I
15 just asked you if you agree that there are statements
16 from the industry in these articles, right?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. And here, 53, 55, 56, 57, the ones we're
19 looking at, at least some of them, it doesn't appear
20 that that information is buried, right?
Some of them
21 it's the headline, right?

Objection.
Well, I don't know where to
place them --

Okay.
There's no --
Yeah, okay.
You can approach.
If it's not one of those standards.
7 SIDEBAR CONFERENCE:
8 (The following proceedings were had before the
9 Court outside the presence of the jury:)
10
MR. FEIWUS:
Your Honor, the problem is they
11 haven't given him the actual article.
You can't
12 tell where those statements are in the scope of
13 the larger article.
14 haven't shown him -- you have to give him the
15 entire article if you're going to ask him where
16 does it fall in the article.
You have rip lines.
You
17 In order for him to assess the amount of
18 prominence these statements are given, he has to
19 see the whole article.
20 it is.
21 are found.
22 going to ask him questions like that, he has to
23 give him the articles.
24
25
He doesn't know how long
He has to know where these statements
That's why I said before if he's
MR. SALES:
I think my question is if it's
in the headlines, it's not buried.

I didn't ask3697

it that way.
THE COURT:
At least some of them, it
3 doesn't appear that information is buried.
4 of them is in the headline.
5 MR. SALES:
6 MR. FEIWUS:
Some
That was my question.
Still, Your Honor, we can't --
7 without looking at the article, he cannot
8 address the prominence in which those statements
9 are given.
10
He needs the article.
MR. SALES:
He did address them.
He said
11 they were irrelevant because they were
12 duplicative.

MR. FEIWUS:
I think it's misleading.

He's

THE COURT:
I already said counsel needs to
17 provide the entire document if he has it.
18 I'm assuming you don't have it.
19
MR. SALES:
So
They've been provided, in all
20 those -- see, they have PT numbers.
21 those have been provided in advance, Your Honor.
22 THE COURT: In their entirety?
23 MR. SALES: Yes.
24 MR. FEIWUS: 25 THE COURT:
All of
Your Honor, he provided me --
Wait a minute.

copy of it here?
MR. SALES:
Sure.
All of them can be pulled
up for redirect.
THE COURT:
Well, I thought I made myself
5 clear before that if you anticipated and you had
6 the entire document and you're going to ask him
7 about it, you are going to hand him the entire
8 document.
9
MR. SALES:
I didn't print every one out for
10 the cross.
11 told the Court, that are coming up after these.
12 We can print them all out, and we'll do that
13 right now.
14
15
16
17
I printed out some, which is what I
MR. GUSTAFSON:
We're doing that right now.
I have three sets of each one.
THE COURT:
Let's do it that way, in light
of the objection.
18 MR. SALES:
19 MR. GUSTAFSON:
20 THE COURT:
I think it's reasonable.
Do you have them ready?
I'll keep handing them up.
So, gentlemen, let's get that in
21 the witness's hand.
22 your inquiry.
Then you can continue with
23 MR. SALES: Let me just get organized.

1 END OF SIDEBAR CONFERENCE
2 (The following proceedings were had before the
3 Court and jury:)
4 BY MR. SALES:
5
Q.
As we're printing out copies of the entire
6 articles, would you agree that some of the health
7 message information is included in the headlines of
8 these articles, sir?
Would you agree?
9 A. Yes, I would agree.
10 Q. And you know who Clarence Cook Little is,
11 right?
12
A.
Yes.
He was president of the University of
13 Michigan and became associated with The Tobacco
14 Institute.
15
Q.
And he frequently spoke on behalf of the --

His mic isn't on.

Judge, we're unmic'd.
Thank you.
Sorry.
Okay.
Got it.
22 BY MR. SALES:
23
Q.
And he frequently spoke on behalf of the
24 industry in the '50s and '60s, right?

A.
He did.

1 MR. SALES:
2 MR. GUSTAFSON:
3 MR. SALES:
4
Okay.
Is that just this one?
Yes.
Your Honor, I'm handing the
witness a copy of these four, if I may.
5 THE COURT:
Please.
6 THE WITNESS:
Thank you, sir.
7 BY MR. SALES:
8
Q.
You're welcome.
Thank you, Doctor.
And if
9 you focus on the headline, the one where Dr. Little is
10 referred to, Dr. Little is referred to not only in the
11 second part of the headline, but the information that
12 we have highlighted from 1955 appears.
13
And you can confirm this in the document I
14 handed you in the first paragraph of the article itself
15 in the New York Times, right?
"Smoke, Cancer Tide Turn
16 Obscure (phonetic)?"
17 A. Yes, I see that.
18 Q. "The possible relationship between cigarette
19 smoking and lung cancer and other afflictions is still
20 an unknown factor, Dr. Clarence Little emphasized here
21 yesterday," right?
22
A.
Yes.
There's a mistake in one of these.
23 It's not a New York Times.
It's the New York Daily
24 News, which is PT03122.
25
Q.
I stand corrected on that.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-3408
Thank you for3701
1 pointing that out.
That's the last one with the
2 different print style, right?
3
A.
Yes.
4 MR. SALES:
All right.
5 THE WITNESS:
Baron, you got that?
So we both made a mistake.
6 BY MR. SALES:
7
Q.
Yes, sir.
Let me show you -- and we'll
8 print out the entire article in a print which is PDEM03
9 from the 1960s and ask you -- the only question I have
10 for you right now is -- we'll print out copies of the
11 articles -- are whether or not -- whether or not these
12 matters appear on your reliance list.
And in
13 particular, I'd like to focus on the second and third
14 one, "Cigarette Threat Called Unproven" and the
15 headline in the third one, "Tobacco Spokesmen Dispute
16 Lung Study."
17
Can you tell us whether or not those appear
18 in your reliance list?
And I have full copies for you,
19 if I may approach, Your Honor?
20 A. Yes, thank you very much.
21 Q. Here you go, Doctor.
22 A. Thank you, sir.
23
At first glance, they do not appear.
24 some of these are intermixed.
Again,
But they do not appear
25 to be in the reliance memo.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083702
1
Q.
All right.
Thank you.
Let's go, if we
2 could, please, to PDM06, and we'll print those out in a
3 few moments.
We've got them already.
May I, Judge?
4 think this is the last of the ones we're not going to
I
5 show the whole copy of.
6 THE COURT: Okay.
7 MR. SALES: Thank you.
8 BY MR. SALES:
9
Q.
There are two more, Dr. DiBacco.
It's dated
10 up there, August 14.
11
MR. FEIWUS:
Okay.
12 BY MR. SALES:
13
Q.
Are you up -- have you had a chance to look
14 at these, two, Doc, PT 3091 and PT09129, and tell us
15 whether or not those are included in your reliance
16 list?
17 A. They do not appear to be.
18 Q. All right.
Now, I asked you specifically
19 when we started on this about Mr. Cullman, do you
20 remember that?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Here I have some full text ones, at least
23 let's take a look at the first page.
The date on the
24 bottom, you've seen this before how when you obtained
25 these from the New York Times, one way to get them is
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083703
1 when they're copywritten as opposed to going to
2 microfiche, are you familiar with that?
3
A.
I'm not familiar with that.
I do it the
4 other way.
5
Q.
All right.
Will you accept my
6 representation that there is an article that appeared
7 on April 10th, 1963 in the New York Times?
8
A.
Yes.
And let me just check and see if it's
9 on here.
10
Q.
All right.
"Cancer, Link Exoneration Seen
11 by Philip Morris Head."
That would be that
12 Mr. Cullman, while you're looking, right?
13 A. Yes.
Okay.
14 Q. Do you have that one?
15 A. No.
16 Q. All right.
And another one in a similar
17 format from April 15th, 1964.
So that would have been
18 a few months after the Surgeon General's report, the
19 Surgeon General's general report was released, right?
20 That's PT9126, for the record, from the New York Times.
21 Is that one on your list?
22
A.
I'm looking at it right now.
Hold on.
No,
23 it is not.
24
Q.
All right.
And just to do batteries of the
25 text there...
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083704
1
He took issue with the Surgeon General
2 Advisory Committee's report of January on smoking and
3 health, right?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. And that was a theme that was repeated in
6 the public press from the industry in the '60s, right,
7 sir?
8 A. For part of the '60s.
9 Q. All right.
And occasionally the industry,
10 when it spoke publicly, would talk about science that
11 was available elsewhere, right, sir?
You see that?
12 A. I see it.
13 Q. "Mr. Cullman reviewed a number of reports by
14 scientists, including that of a group of west German
15 scientists, which he said had recently reported a
16 five-year pathological study that tended to exonerate
17 cigarettes as a cause of lung cancer and indicted air
18 pollution."
Did I read that right?
19 A. You did.
What is the date?
20 Q. '64, right?
21 A. Okay.
22 Q. Right.
23 A. No.
24 Q. And do you remember we talked a little bit a
Thank you.
Yes.
Okay.
So that one wasn't on there either?
25 while ago by -- about Clarence Cook Little?
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083705
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. He sometimes would get equal time with
3 others, wouldn't he?
4
A.
With respect to television and radio and the
5 like?
6
Q.
7 print.
Well, let's talk about print since we're on
1963, that's before the Surgeon General's
8 report in '64, right?
9 A. That is.
10 Q. And do you have this one on your reliance
11 list, sir, anything from Newsweek?
12 on it, "Smoking and Health."
It has a big cover
Tell us if that's on your
13 reliance list, sir.
14
A.
At first glance in looking through this, I
15 don't see it.
16
Q.
Let me just show you and the members of the
17 jury, have you ever seen this before?
Do you recognize
18 that handsome man with the mustache there, Clarence
19 Cook Little?
20 bottom.
I can zoom in if you need to see the
He was, at the time, as this reflects, was he
21 not, '63, the scientific director of the TIRC, wasn't
22 he, sir?
23 A. That is correct.
24 Q. And since we're down there, let's see what
25 he says.
"Science does not yet know enough about any
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083706
1 suspected factors to judge whether they may operate
2 alone, whether they may operate in conjunction with
3 others, or whether they may affect or be affected by
4 factors of whose existence science is not yet aware.
5 Indeed, it is not known whether these factors actually
6 are causative in any real sense."
7
And that was a consistent theme of the
8 industry in the public press in the 1960s, wasn't it,
9 sir?
10 A. For a part of it.
For a part of the '60s.
11 Q. Take a look, if you would, please, at this
12 one, sir, from 1978 in the New York Times, July 8th.
13 See if you have anything from the New York Times on
14 that one.
It's referencing Tobacco Institute taking
15 issue with the study that says people with bad hearts
16 are more susceptible to crippling chest pains when they
17 sit near cigarette smokers.
18
A.
Is there a head to that, Mr. Sales?
It
19 doesn't appear as if that's a -- ah, okay.
20
Q.
I think we can agree that the tobacco unit,
21 in light of the content of the article that's being
22 referred to, is The Tobacco Institute, right, sir?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. All right.
25 A. No.
Is that on your list?
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083707
1
Q.
All right.
Also from the 1970s, which is a
2 little bit of a longer story, May 1st, 1971, "Cancer
3 Society Said to Avoid New Smoking Study."
4
See if that one is on there.
5 A. What's the date?
6 Q. It's May 1 of 1970.
And to orient you, that
7 was when the industry was accusing the American Cancer
8 Society about lying about a study involving beagles.
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. Do you remember that?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Is that on your list, May 1 of '70?
13 A. No, it is not.
14 Q. And do you remember when I asked you whether
15 a while ago, sir, you compared press releases of The
16 Tobacco Institute and other industry participants to
17 see if what they were saying was picked up in the
18 press?
Do you remember that?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. You looked at TIME Magazine.
21 bunch of them on there, right?
Didn't you, sir?
22 A. That's not the magazine.
23 Q. I know.
24 right?
You got a
Because now we can get it online,
Will you accept my representation that PT65821
25 is a copy of the article appearing "Medicine:
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-3408
More3708
1 Smoke," from TIME Magazine on the date indicated?
Will
2 you accept that?
3 A. Could I see the whole thing?
4 Q. Sure.
5 A. Can you move it down?
6 Q. The question only -- the only question I
7 have for you now is whether or not you'll accept my
8 representation that this appeared in TIME Magazine.
9 And if your answer is no, I'll go to something else.
10 A. What's the date of this, sir?
11 Q. It's January 22nd, 1979, which you know from
12 your work in this area would have been followed very
13 shortly after The Tobacco Institute's press release
14 following the release, I should say in that instance
15 before the release of the 1970 -- '79 Surgeon General's
16 report, do you remember that?
17
A.
This... still I can't -- can you move it,
18 move it down so I can see the date?
19 Q. The date is right up at the top.
20 A. Yeah.
21 Q. January 22 --
22 A. 1979.
23 Q. -- 1979.
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. That's not on your list, right?
No, that's not on there.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083709
1 A. No, sir.
2 Q. And have you -- the jury has actually seen a
3 press conference where Mr. Dwyer appeared.
4 mentioned him today.
You
Do you remember that?
I think
5 you did.
6 A. No, I did not.
7 Q. Do you remember Mr. Dwyer, the vice
8 president of The Tobacco Institute?
9 A. His name is familiar, yes.
10 Q. All right.
And you remember the
11 circumstances described here that even before that
12 Surgeon General's report in 1979 appeared that
13 Mr. Dwyer appeared on behalf of The Tobacco Institute
14 asserting that the links between smoking and disease
15 had not been proven conclusively, right?
16 A. Yes.
I saw that.
17 Q. There was a whole episode there where the
18 industry was attacking Mr. Califano, then the secretary
19 of what used to be called Health Education and Welfare.
20 Do you remember that?
21 A. I rather that.
22 Q. All right.
23 A. No.
24 Q. And do you remember also, sir, because I
That's not on your list, right?
25 think it's been referenced today that it was in 1988
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083710
1 that the Surgeon General released the first report
2 calling cigarettes an addiction, right?
3 remember that?
Do you
Do you remember that, sir?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. All right.
And does your reliance list
6 include article from the New York Times from May 17th,
7 1988?
Just take a look at that, if you could, please.
8 A. May I have a copy of it?
9 Q. This is my only one of that.
10 back up so you can take a look.
Let me put it
Anyway, you remember
11 the incident in that year the Surgeon General's report
12 came out a little bit later, in May, not in January,
13 right?
14 A. Yes, that's correct.
15 Q. And do you know who Brennan Moran is, sir?
16 A. I'd have to see the article, if I could.
17 Q. Here, let me just show you.
Do you remember
18 Brennan Moran, assistant to the president of The
19 Tobacco Institute, said in response to the report that
20 claims that cigarettes are addictive contradict common
21 sense.
She called the report "Another escalation in
22 the Surgeon General's anti-smoking campaign."
23
That made it into the information
24 environment, didn't it, sir?
25
A.
It did.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083711
1
Q.
Is that on your reliance list from the New
2 York Times?
3 A. No.
4 Q. And did you undertake at all, sir, to
5 evaluate the newspaper called the Asbury Park Evening
6 Press?
Have you looked at that?
7 A. That's not a major --
8 Q. Right?
9 A. That's not a major newspaper, Mr. Sales.
10 Q. I'm not saying it is.
I just asked if you
11 looked at it.
12 A. No.
13 Q. Do you remember where Asbury Park is?
14 A. In New Jersey.
15 Q. Do you know the relative distance from
16 Asbury Park to the town where Ms. Westmoreland lived --
17 A. No.
18 Q. -- when she was younger?
19 A. No.
I'd like to see the article if you want
20 to show it to me.
21
Q.
I'm not going to ask you about it.
Have you
22 undertaken to review newspapers from South Carolina
23 when Ms. Westmoreland resided in South Carolina?
24 A. From 1970 to 1976, no.
25 Q. You told Mr. Feiwus that a lot of these
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083712
1 stories were often picked up by local news because at
2 that time, newspapers, and even today, had wire
3 services where the UPI and AP, I think you mentioned
4 another one, I've forgotten, New York Times was
5 another, a lot of those local papers when there were
6 stories of national interest, they could get their
7 feeds through whatever means, they would get them from
8 those wire services, right?
9 A. Many times.
10 Q. And one of the reasons you looked at the New
11 York Times in these cases is because it provides sort
12 of a barometer of the kind of information that was
13 available out in the information environment that you
14 call, right?
15
A.
It is one -- one leg of the information
16 environment.
17
Q.
All right.
Let's shift gears, if we could,
18 please, and ask you a couple questions about some of
19 these advocacy organizations, because I --
20 Mr. Philipson, can I have this back?
21 Like magic.
22 Going clockwise again were the things I
23 added.
The Tobacco Institute, we talked a little bit
24 about that, right?
There was another advocacy or
25 scientific organization used to be called the TIRC,
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083713
1 later it was called the CTR, right?
2 A. CTR.
3 Q. Yes.
And we've seen today that sometimes
4 people associate with those organizations would speak,
5 right?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. All right.
And with respect to Liggett,
8 who's the defendant in this case, sir, you don't know
9 when Liggett became a member of the CTR, do you?
10 A. No.
11 Q. And with respect to the defendant here,
12 Liggett, you don't know if the tobacco -- whether
13 Liggett was a part of The Tobacco Institute, do you?
14 A. No.
15 Q. And you don't know whether or not The
16 Tobacco Institute -- let me back up.
17
Do you remember those PSAs you showed?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. You don't know whether The Tobacco Institute
20 had any PSAs of its own, do you?
21 A. Not to my knowledge.
22 Q. You talked a little bit about celebrities
23 and people who got cancer.
Do you remember that?
24 A. Talk about what, sir?
25 Q. Just one second.
You talked about some
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083714
1 people that were celebrities that got cancer and died.
2 Do you remember that?
3 A. And made PSAs.
4 Q. Right.
Well, there were other people,
5 famous people who might not have made PSAs who got
6 cancer and died but were very well known when it came
7 to matters of smoking and health, right?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. One of them you showed -- can I have that
10 picture of Edward R. Murrow?
11
Edward R. Murrow, for a man of the '50s, was
12 probably as well-informed about the things that we've
13 been talking about as anybody else, wasn't he, sir?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Lung cancer, dead, right?
16 A. Yes, he died of lung cancer.
17 Q. Right.
A. A lot of intelligent people die from lung
He was an intelligent man, wasn't
18 he?
19
20 cancer.
21
Q.
All right.
Well, let's talk a little bit
22 about some other celebrity people who were well
23 informed.
We talked a little bit about Harry Reasoner.
24 He was one of those newsmen who -- who gave a show that
25 got a lot of attention the day after -- the day of the
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083715
1 Surgeon General's report.
You told us about that,
2 right?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. You remember him?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. You've seen this show, haven't you?
7 A. Yes, I've met Mr. Reasoner.
8 Q. He got lung cancer, didn't he?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. He was very well-informed?
11 A. He chose to smoke.
12 Q. I didn't ask you about his choices.
I asked
13 you he was well-informed, right?
14 A. To the best of my knowledge.
15 Q. He was an intelligent man, right?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. And you know because you're a student -- a
18 historian, rather, in particular of American history,
19 that he not only was a smoker who got lung cancer, he
20 was a smoker who got lung cancer, had a lung removed
21 and then went back to smoking, right?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. All right.
Let's see if we can think of
24 somebody from the '70s and '80s that you might --
25 remember this guy?
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083716
1 A. Yes, Peter Jennings.
2 Q. He was an intelligent man, right?
3 A. To the best of my knowledge.
4 Q. He was a smoker, right?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. And he quit smoking, didn't he?
7 A. At some point, he did.
8 Q. And do you recall, sir, that there was a
9 circumstance in his life where he was under a lot of
10 stress and resumed smoking and later died of lung
11 cancer?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. All right, sir.
Talked about some other
14 people from the past.
15
16 up?
The jury has seen -- can you put them both
All right.
Let's show one.
I want to show you a
17 picture of someone -- and the jury has seen this a
18 couple of times -- who has spoken from time to time
19 publicly about issues that you've been talking about in
20 this case in the '80s and '90s, because we talked about
21 the '70s a little bit. We talked about the '60s.
22 talked about the '50s. So here's a man who spoke about
23 these matters on Nightline in 1984, national show,
24 right?
25
A.
ABC.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-3408
We3717
1 Q. Right?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. National show.
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. Catapulted one of our newsmen into sort of
Big audience, right?
6 rocket star fame -- excuse me, rockstar fame, at the
7 time at least, Ted Koppel, right?
8 A. That's debatable whether he's rockstar fame.
9 Q. All right.
10 A. No, I wouldn't say he's rockstar.
I think we agree on something.
He's got
11 a nice head of hair, but...
12
Q.
True enough.
Thank you.
This guy I want to
13 tell you is the same guy, left and right, he appeared
14 in 1984 -- 1984, right?
15
MR. PHILIPSON:
Um-hum.
16 BY MR. SALES:
17
Q.
-- on Nightline and then later before
18 Congress in the 1990s, a little older, little less
19 hair, a little grayer, like a lot of us are getting.
20 Do you know who he is?
21 A. No, I don't.
22 Q. Do you know, do you even know who Edward
23 Corrigan is, sir?
24
A.
There is an Edward Horrigan who was
25 associated with The Tobacco Institute, I believe.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083718
1
Q.
I don't want to correct you, but he used to
2 be the president and CEO of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
3 Company when he was on that Nightline show.
4 A. Right.
5 Q. Did you know that?
6 A. Yes.
And he also was with The Tobacco
7 Institute, too.
8
Q.
All right.
He might well have been.
Did
9 you know that he later in the 1990s became the
10 president and CEO of this defendant, of Liggett, right?
11 Did you not know that?
12 A. I did not know that.
13 Q. You would agree if he went on Nightline in
14 the 1980s that that was part of the information
15 environment, right, sir?
16 A. Not the 1980s.
17 Q. So it wasn't part of the information
18 environment if he went on national TV and, let's say,
19 denied that it was proven that cigarettes caused
20 disease, that would not have been part of the
21 information environment?
22 A. No.
23 Q. All right.
I'm just going to spend a little
24 bit of time with you reviewing some of things that you
25 showed the jury in those slides today, all right, sir?
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083719
1 All right?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. But just before we do, I think you covered
4 this with Mr. Feiwus, but on the school things that we
5 looked at, we looked at a textbook from 1931, right?
6 Right?
7 A. That's correct.
8 Q. And we know, because you told us that those
9 textbooks get revised every six or seven years, that
10 it's highly unlikely that that textbook was shown in
11 parochial school in New Jersey in the late 1950s,
12 right?
13 A. I don't know.
14 Q. All right.
And you have no idea, actually,
15 to be fair, what textbooks this lady ever saw anywhere
16 any time, right?
17 A. I have no idea.
18 Q. And you have no idea whether she saw any of
19 the things you showed the jury or whether she saw the
20 things that we've shown, right?
21 A. I have no idea.
22 Q. Remember this one?
And I -- I apologize to
23 everyone for my scribbles and ask, if we can, if you
24 could ignore those just to save time.
25
You remember that one, sir?
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083720
1
A.
I remember the slide.
I can't read the
2 writing.
3
Q.
I don't want you -- I'm hoping you don't
4 read my writing.
Actually, what it says up on the top
5 there is "Temperance Movement."
You know what that is,
6 right?
7 A. Sure.
8 Q. Part of the effort to ban cigarettes or
9 limit the access to them as part of a general movement
10 that led to, among other things, in the instance of
11 alcohol, prohibition in this country, right?
12 A. No.
They were two separate movements.
13 Q. All right.
But it was around the same time
14 certainly?
15 A. Around the same time.
16 Q. And it was sponsored, not exclusively, but
17 in part by people with religious orientations who had
18 specific objections along the lines that you talked
19 about about the human body and the like, right?
20 A. No, there were health advocates as well.
21 Q. Now, did I get it correct that there was a
22 time when it would have been illegal to sell cigarettes
23 to minors around this country?
24
A.
There was a time in the period of early 20th
25 century that States began to pass laws that would
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083721
1 prevent minors as they were defined in various states
2 at a certain age, yes.
3
Q.
So as a result of that, if it was unlawful
4 during whatever that time period was for this defendant
5 or any other one to try to sell cigarettes to minors,
6 that would have been unlawful and a breaking of
7 whatever that law was in those states, right?
8
MR. FEIWUS:
9
Objection; beyond the scope;
calls for a legal conclusion.
10 THE WITNESS:
11 THE COURT:
I don't know the answer.
Hold it.
12 objection.
13 objection, Mr. Feiwus.
14
Let me just -- I heard the
MR. SALES:
15
There was an
Past prohibition on the right,
Your Honor.
16
THE COURT:
17
Okay.
Give me a second.
Overruled.
18 BY MR. SALES:
19
Q.
At the time that it was unlawful, for
20 example, in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, if those were the
21 states that you meant to identify, to sell cigarettes
22 to minors --
23
A.
24 minors.
25
Q.
To anybody.
To anybody.
These aren't just
These are everybody.
If this defendant or any or manufacturer was
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083722
1 selling cigarettes to anybody during those periods of
2 time -- they were --
3 A. I --
4 Q. -- they were, were they not, breaking the
5 law?
6 A. I don't know.
7 Q. Did some states, in fact, have cigarette
8 bans that applied only to minors?
9 A. Later on.
10 Q. Well, you know as a matter of fact, sir,
11 because of the work that you do in this area that every
12 state in this nation prohibits the sale of cigarettes
13 to minors, right?
14
A.
Well, there is a difference between
15 prohibiting and forcing.
16
Q.
I didn't ask you that.
I asked you whether
17 or not you know, because of the work you do, whether
18 today and for a period of decades it has been unlawful
19 to sell cigarettes to minors everywhere, virtually
20 everywhere, including Florida, right?
21
A.
In terms of how the word "minor" is defined.
22 It varies from state to state.
23
Q.
All right.
And so in Florida, for example,
24 if there were periods of time when there was a ban of
25 the sale of cigarettes to minors, if this defendant
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083723
1 or -- in New Jersey or in South Carolina, if this
2 defendant is selling cigarettes to minors, that was
3 wrong, right?
4
A.
5 age was.
Again, it depends upon what the particular
I don't know what the state age was in New
6 Jersey or any other state.
7
Q.
A small point maybe, but do you remember the
8 LIFE Magazine, sir with the fireworks going off on the
9 front?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. You've seen this one before, right?
12 from 1954.
That's
This article, not the part that you showed
13 the jury, specifically states, doesn't it, sir, that --
14 it's real small because of the print form that I have.
15 Let's blow it up.
It specifically states that "While
16 tobacco in the medical sense is not addictive or
17 habit-forming, it often has an iron grip on its
18 habitual users," right?
19 A. We showed that.
20 Q. You showed that language?
21 A. We showed that article.
22 Q. You didn't slow that language, did you?
23 A. No, we showed other parts of the article.
24 Q. In the 1950s, it's true, isn't it, that from
25 a medical point of view, nicotine contained in
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083724
1 cigarettes was not viewed as an addictive drug, right?
2
A.
It depended.
They used the term
3 "habituation" which is often used in place of
4 "addiction."
5
Q.
Home stretch, everybody.
I forgot about
6 this one.
7
We talked about the 1980s and we showed you
8 the picture of Mr. Horrigan.
9 lady.
We've got a video of this
She also appeared on national television.
Do
10 you know who she is?
11 A. No, I do not.
12 Q. Does the name Anne Browder ring a bell?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. All right.
She's with The Tobacco Institute.
And she went on national
15 television in the 1980s and suggested that it was
16 unproven that cigarettes caused cancer or other
17 diseases, that would have been part of the information
18 environment at the time, wouldn't it have been, sir?
19 A. Not in the 1980s.
20 Q. That just would have evaporated into the
21 atmosphere.
Nobody would have paid attention to that,
22 right?
23 A. No.
24 Q. Okay.
Let's look at this, all right.
It's
25 not a final exam, but it just kind of looks like that
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083725
1 for the moment.
2 All right.
Let me get a different colored pen.
In the history of the United States, was
3 there a controversy as to whether cigarettes caused
4 lung cancer, in 1954, yes or no?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. Okay.
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. All right.
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. How about 1964?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. How about 1979?
13 A. No.
14 Q. Still a controversy?
15 A. No.
16 Q. All right.
17 A. If the issue relates to addiction, yes.
18 Q. No.
19 A. Lung cancer.
20 Q. All right.
There was a controversy?
Good.
How about 1957?
How about 1988?
I'm sorry.
Still no?
No.
Didn't mean to be unfair.
There's no controversy.
1994, the year of this lady's
21 death, controversy?
22 A. No.
23 Q. Okay.
And tell us when Liggett first
24 acknowledged that cigarettes caused cancer.
25
A.
1997.

1
Q.
All right.
No controversy here, those three
2 times that I identified.
But there was a controversy
3 at least up until 1964, right?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. All right.
So tell me when, since you've
6 given me those answers for those two periods of time,
7 when the controversy ceased to exist.
8
A.
It never evaporated.
It diminished to such
9 an extent that it was rarely noticeable.
10 Q. All right.
11 A. In 1979 --
12 Q. I just want a date.
13 A. I can't give you a date.
14 date.
I can't give you a
There's all --
15 Q. That's fine.
16 A. There's always a segment that's going to
17 take issue.
I'll accept that.
The tobacco companies continued to argue
18 throughout this period of time that the association was
19 still statistical and we needed to find the causative
20 agent, what causes lung cancer and more research needed
21 to be done.
22
Q.
All right.
You would agree that whatever
23 was available, to use the words that you used, sir, to
24 Ms. Westmoreland at every point in her life was
25 available to Liggett and every other manufacturer of
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083727
1 cigarettes in this country, right?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. And if we were to talk about their
4 executives, their board of directors, their scientists,
5 accountants, clerk, typist, whoever was living in this
6 country the periods that you've been talking about was
7 exposed to the same stuff, right?
8 A. No.
9 Q. No?
10 A. No.
11 Q. All right.
I'd have to explain.
Well, Mr. Feiwus might want to
12 do that with you, but let's see if we can do it this
13 way.
Would you agree that Liggett as of the early
14 1960s knew at least at much about the health hazards of
15 cigarettes as a young girl or teenage girl in this
16 country, sir?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. And would you agree that that would have
19 remained true for the entire period of time up until
20 she died?
They knew at least as much, all of them, all
21 of it together, scientists, directors, executives, they
22 knew at least as much, didn't they, sir?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. And probably a whole lot more, right?
25 A. I don't know that.
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083728
1
Q.
And if we were to ask the same question
2 about the health risks of cigarettes, rather the
3 addictiveness of nicotine, the same answers would be
4 given by you, wouldn't they be, sir, that during all
5 the relevant periods of time we've been talking about,
6 Liggett knew at least as much as Liggett knew --
7 excuse me.
Liggett knew at least as much as
8 Miss Westmoreland did about the habituating effects of
9 tobacco, whether it was addictive or not addictive,
10 whether it was a drug or not a drug.
Excuse me.
They
11 knew at least as much as she did?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. And then finally a couple of questions on
14 the warning labels.
You had a little bit of an
15 opportunity today to tie some of the warning labels to
16 some of dates.
And when we looked at the pack, for
17 example, you were able on the pack of cigarettes, you
18 were able to tell me that if a cigarette pack has that
19 label, it probably means that Mr. Philipson got
20 something from that 15-year period on eBay, I guess,
21 '70 to '85?
22 A. Who's Mr. Philipson?
23 Q. I'm just kind of organizing my thoughts a
24 little bit.
25
Let me redo this.
If we showed you a pack of cigarettes that
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083729
1 had this label on it, you know because of the work that
2 you've done that it was probably made in that 15-year
3 window, right?
4 A. It was distributed in that 15-year period.
5 Q. Good point.
6 A. It wasn't made.
7 Q. Okay.
8 A. It was made on November 1, 1970.
9 Q. I think we're saying the same thing.
Okay.
Might --
A
10 cigarette package with that warning label on it is from
11 that era, age '70 to '85 more or less, right?
12
A.
It's not more or less.
It's exactly that.
13 Precisely.
14 Q. We're saying the same thing.
15 A. No, we're not.
16 Q. Okay.
It is precise.
A cigarette package from that era
17 that has that label is from that era, the date is
18 identified?
19 A. Absolutely.
20 Q. I'm sorry.
21
I misspoke.
And we know also that cigarette labels that
22 have one of these four, they call them rotating, in
23 fact, you've got it there, rotating warnings.
If we
24 see a cigarette pack that has one of these warning
25 labels on it that appears here on this slide, we can be
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083730
1 fairly confident that they were distributed, is that
2 the word we should use, after October 12, 1985?
3 A. Beginning on October 12th, 1985.
4 Q. All right.
So if a witness in this case,
5 just to help us get organized a little bit, related an
6 event in time to the appearance of this warning label,
7 we know that that had to have taken place after
8 October 12th, 1985, right, sir?
9
A.
Well, I'm not certain what you mean.
10 don't know what you're talking about.
I
If a witness did
11 what?
12
Q.
If a witness who testified under oath in
13 this case that he had a conversation with the deceased
14 smoker about that third warning label, that
15 conversation had to have taken place after
16 October 12th, 1985, right?
17 A. It would have to have taken place.
18 Q. Right.
And just finally, since we're
19 talking about the history of the 1980s, there's been a
20 reference several times in the case to a Surgeon
21 General by the name of Koop.
Do you remember him?
22 A. C. Evarts Koop, Dr. Koop.
23 Q. Yes.
24 A. He was Surgeon General immediately after
And when was he first Surgeon General?
25 Julius Richmond and was in the period of Ronald Reagan
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-34083731
1 administration.
2 Q. And he was inaugurated January of 1981?
3 A. That's correct.
4 Q. So if someone testified in this case that
5 something happened during the time of C. Everett Koop,
6 the Surgeon General, we know that that had to be after
7 January 1, let's say, of 1981, right?
8 A. I'm sorry.
I lost you.
If someone --
9 Q. Remember what we just did here, sir?
10 A. Yeah, right.
11 Q. With the warning labels and I said if
12 something happened went that warning label was on a
13 pack of cigarettes, it had to be after such and such a
14 date in 1985, and you agreed?
15 A. That's right.
16 Q. I'm doing the same thing now with our
17 friend, Dr. Koop.
That's right.
All right?
18 A. All right.
19 Q. If somebody talked about something that
20 happened after Dr. Koop was Surgeon General from the
21 pure point of view of historical fact, that had to be
22 after January 1 of 1981, right, sir?
23 A. Yes.
But these warnings that we just --
24 Q. I'm not talking about warnings.
25 question has nothing to do with warnings?

2 THE WITNESS:
3 THE COURT:
Sure, sure.
First question:
Do you have a
4 record of when the PSAs, Public Service

6 Lose," and "Don't Be a Loser" were aired other
7 than the specific year?
8 months, how long or even which states?

THE WITNESS:

The answer to that question
10 is, no.
The PSAs aired on some particular ABC,
11 CBS, NBC shows at random.
12 THE COURT:

No.

Next question, "Why wouldn't the
6 information on the package of Lark cigarettes
7 not be a part of Ms. Westmoreland's

THE WITNESS:
Because the FTC disallowed any

11 ads or on cigarette packages with regard to
12 health claims.
