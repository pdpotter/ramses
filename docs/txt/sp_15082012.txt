LUIS MARTINEZ-FERNANDEZ, Ph.D.,
4 having been first duly sworn, testified as follows:
5
DIRECT EXAMINATION
6 BY MR. GARCIA:
7
Q. We've met but I need you to please tell us your
8 full name for the record.
9
A. My name is Luis Martinez-Fernandez, and I use a
10 hyphen between the two last names.
11
Q. And, sir, are you a Ph.D.?
12
A. Yes, I have a Ph.D.
13
Q. So, in deference to that title do you mind if I
14 call you doctor?
15
A. That's fine.
16
Q. Okay. Doctor, what is your professional
17 occupation?
18
A. I'm a historian and I'm a history professor.
19
Q. Okay. Where are you employed?
20
A. At the University of Central Florida.
21
Q. And how long have you been a history professor at
22 the University of Central Florida?
23
A. I started in 2004.
24
Q. Do you do work outside of your work as a history
25 professor at the University of Central Florida?
0007
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]1
A. Yes, I do.
2
Q. Tell me about that.
3
A. I do consulting work with Jones Day. I also do
4 -- I serve in the College Board of New York as a trustee,
5 and member of various committees. And informally I do
6 other consulting as well.
7
Q. Insofar as your consulting work is concerned do
8 you do that through a company?
9
A. The name of my company is Cultural Translations.
10 I'm the only member of that company.
11
Q. And is Cultural Translations a corporation,
12 partnership, or limited liability company?
13
A. At one point that name was used for a
14 corporation. That was many years ago. But it's just a
15 name that I use for which I did the paperwork for the, I
16 guess they call it a fictitious name.
17
Q. Oh, I see. It is a sole proprietorship then and
18 Cultural Translations is the fictitious name for
19 Dr. Fernandez-Martinez?
20
A. Yes, fictitious name in the sense that it's used
21 by the government.
22
Q. Okay. All right. And how long have you used the
23 fictitious name Cultural Translations?
24
A. I believe the approximation may be 2005 or '6.
25
Q. Okay. Does Cultural Translations file an income
0008
1 tax return?
2
A. That is included in one of the schedules for my
3 personal income tax forms.
4
Q. I see. Okay. Is it the case that when you
5 perform consulting work through Cultural Translations that
6 your client or customer will provide you with what we know
7 from experience to be an I-9 form when you are paid for
8 your services?
9
A. Is that the document that I get at the beginning
10 of the year with the amount of income?
11
Q. I believe so.
12
A. Well, if that's it, I do get those.
13
Q. Okay. You know what a W-2 is, right?
14
A. Yes, I do.
15
Q. Okay. Do you get a W-2 from your customers or
16 clients for work done through Cultural Translations?
17
A. Now, the W-2, if you could describe that to me.
18
Q. That is also an income statement that you receive
19 typically from an employer.
20
A. Oh, yes, I do.
21
Q. Okay. Well, does Cultural Translations receive
22 W-2 forms from any of its customers or clients?
23
A. No.
24
Q. Okay.
25
A. No. If I may clarify something. When you asked
0009
1 the question about the first document --
2
Q. Yeah.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]3
A. -- not the W-2, what I believe is the case that I
4 do get the W-2, I don't recall if I get another document.
5
Q. Fair enough. You probably get a W-2 from UCF?
6
A. That's correct.
7
Q. Okay. But what you're telling me, you're not
8 sure if you get an I-9 or some other document that
9 summarizes the amount of money paid to you by a customer or
10 client of Cultural Translations?
11
A. No. I don't recall anything other than the W-2.
12
Q. Okay. All right. So, when you do work for Jones
13 Day do you send Jones Day a bill for services rendered?
14
A. Yes, I do.
15
Q. And when you do that do you send Jones Day a bill
16 through Cultural Translations?
17
A. That's correct.
18
Q. Okay. All right. And has that been the case for
19 all of the work that you have done for Jones Day?
20
A. Probably at the beginning, no. Because I think I
21 started using Cultural Translations later, I actually know
22 that. So I would say at the beginning of my relationship
23 with Jones Day I did not bill through Cultural
24 Translations.
25
Q. I see. How would you have billed for the work
0010
1 that you performed for Jones Day at the beginning of your
2 relationship with Jones Day?
3
A. I recall that it would just be my name at the
4 top.
5
Q. Okay. All right. You mentioned that you do
6 consulting work for, I think you characterized it as other
7 consulting work, what did you mean by that?
8
A. Yeah, and I also used the word "informal." I'm
9 very active in the community. So cultural organizations
10 seek my advice. I don't know if it would be characterized
11 as consulting, but this is part of my professional work as
12 a historian and that is that very often we're asked to
13 review manuscripts for publication, articles for
14 publication, and journals as well. I don't know whether
15 that qualifies as consulting.
16
Q. Well, when you do that type of work do you bill
17 for your time?
18
A. I don't bill, but in most cases I receive a small
19 stipend for that.
20
Q. Okay. And when you receive a small stipend does
21 that stipend fall into your income tax schedule under
22 Cultural Translations?
23
A. Under self-employment, yeah. But I don't use
24 necessarily the term Cultural Translations when I receive
25 an invitation to review.
0011
1
Q. Okay. All right. When did you begin your
2 relationship with Jones Day?
3
A. I began that if I recall correctly early in 2001.
4
Q. Who at Jones Day contacted you early in 2001?
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]5
A. The first contact was through a lawfirm in Puerto
6 Rico, Fiddler Gonzalez.
7
Q. Were you living in Puerto Rico at the time?
8
A. No, I was here in the States.
9
Q. Okay. And what is Fiddler Gonzalez?
10
A. Fiddler Gonzalez is a lawfirm on the island.
11
Q. All right. Help me understand your answer. I
12 believe you said Jones Day contacted you through Fiddler
13 Gonzalez, a lawfirm in Puerto Rico.
14
A. I don't recall using the term "through."
15
Q. Okay.
16
A. My first contact was a conversation with lawyers
17 from Fiddler Gonzalez.
18
Q. Okay. Who there contacted you?
19
A. Who?
20
Q. Yeah.
21
A. I believe it was a young woman by the name of
22 Silvestrini. I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I think
23 that.
24
Q. And is Silvestrini a man or a woman?
25
A. A woman.
0012
1
Q. Okay. And was Silvestrini a lawyer with Fiddler
2 Gonzalez?
3
A. Yes.
4
Q. And why did she contact you?
5
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
6
A. She contacted me because they wanted to talk to
7 me about possible participation as a historian in some
8 court cases.
9
Q. What type of court cases?
10
A. I recall that the explanation was that it had to
11 do with tobacco.
12
Q. What was your response?
13
A. I said that I was interested in pursuing the
14 conversation.
15
Q. And what happened next?
16
A. Next we had a meeting in New York City with, I
17 believe Silvestrini was there, but there were Jones Day
18 lawyers as well.
19
Q. Okay. Did you meet at the offices of Jones Day
20 in New York City?
21
A. Yes.
22
Q. And when did that happen?
23
A. That must have happened early in 2001, shortly
24 after I received that call.
25
Q. You say early 2001, would be the first quarter --
0013
1
A. Yes.
2
Q. -- in 2001? Okay. And what was the purpose of
3 the meeting?
4
A. The purpose of the meeting was to explain to me
5 what the cases were about, and they wanted to listen to me
6 in the terms of my historical approach. And, what else, we
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]7 talked generally about the scope of the research.
8
Q. Scope of what research?
9
A. Of the research that I would be doing for the
10 lawfirm.
11
Q. Okay. All right. And this meeting in New York
12 City at the offices of Jones Day, was it just you and a
13 group of lawyers?
14
A. That's correct.
15
Q. Okay. Meaning were there any representatives
16 from any of the cigarette companies present?
17
A. No.
18
Q. All right. And as a consequence of that meeting
19 were you formally retained by Jones Day to conduct
20 research?
21
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
22
A. I don't recall if it happened then, it may have
23 happened shortly thereafter.
24
Q. I'm just trying to move things along quickly.
25 What happened as a consequence of that meeting in New York
0014
1 City?
2
A. Well, I started doing research for Jones Day.
3
Q. Okay. And what were you asked to do?
4
A. Generally they spelled out the general topic.
5 They explained what the court cases were about, and the
6 interest in public awareness. That was the general topic
7 that I was asked to pursue, general awareness in the
8 population, particularly Puerto Rico at that time, about
9 the health consequences of smoking.
10
Q. Okay. Before early 2001, when you were first
11 contacted by Silvestrini about doing research regarding
12 public awareness, had you ever done any research on that
13 topic?
14
A. On the topic of awareness of the health
15 consequences of tobacco?
16
Q. Yes, sir.
17
A. No, I had not done that.
18
Q. Okay.
19
A. I did -- I had experience working on tobacco in
20 general as a historian because that fits within my
21 scholarly work, but not awareness particularly, no.
22
Q. Help me understand the work that you did before
23 you were contacted by Silvestrini regarding tobacco?
24
A. Okay. Actually my dissertation had to do with
25 commercial exchanges between the Hispanic Caribbean and
0015
1 other countries. So tobacco figured prominently in that
2 study.
3
Q. Okay. Was this research from a socioeconomic
4 standpoint in the business of the tobacco trade as it
5 relates to Caribbean nations?
6
A. That's correct.
7
Q. And was your emphasis based on the fact that
8 tobacco was a significant business operation in the
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]9 Caribbean?
10
A. That's correct.
11
Q. And before 2001 did any of your work have to do
12 with the effects of tobacco or cigarette smoking on the
13 population?
14
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
15
A. If by work we mean historical research, the
16 answer is no. But I did have experience reading multiple
17 materials in my training as a historian of the Caribbean
18 that touched upon that.
19
Q. Okay. But that was never the emphasis of your
20 work before early 2001 when you were originally contacted
21 by Silvestrini, correct?
22
A. Well, I just mentioned that I had done some work
23 on tobacco for my dissertation so that was before 2001.
24
Q. Right. From a socioeconomic standpoint?
25
A. Correct.
0016
1
Q. But before 2001 you had never done any work that
2 emphasized on the public awareness of the health risks of
3 smoking, correct?
4
A. Public awareness has been a subject of study for
5 other projects, but specifically on awareness of tobacco,
6 no.
7
Q. Okay. And since 2001 have you established a
8 working relationship with the Jones Day lawfirm relative to
9 work that the firm has asked you to perform regarding the
10 general awareness of the health consequences of smoking?
11
A. Yes, I did establish a relationship until today.
12
Q. Okay. And that relationship has been continuous
13 to this day, correct?
14
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to form.
15
A. Yes.
16
Q. Okay. All right. And insofar as -- well, strike
17 that. Is Jones Day your client per se?
18
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to form.
19
Q. As far as your consulting work is concerned?
20
A. My understanding is that it is, all of my
21 communications, the billing, all of that, happens between
22 me and Jones Day.
23
Q. All right. And has any of the work that you have
24 performed at the request of Jones Day included direct
25 interaction with employees of the cigarette companies that
0017
1 Jones Day represents?
2
A. No.
3
Q. All right. So that I'm clear, in the course of
4 your work over the last, what are we now, 11 or 12 years?
5
A. Close to that, yes.
6
Q. Have you ever spoken with an employee of a
7 cigarette company in connection with the research that you
8 were asked to perform?
9
A. No.
10
Q. Not even once?
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]11
A. Not even once.
12
Q. And during the 11 or 12 years that you have done
13 work at the request of Jones Day have you ever asked to
14 speak with a representative or employee of any of the
15 cigarette companies that Jones Day represents for the
16 purpose of conducting your work?
17
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
18
A. Never.
19
Q. Not even once?
20
A. Not even once.
21
Q. Was there something unique regarding the
22 historical approach that you used in your projects, in your
23 research before early 2001 when Silvestrini initially
24 contacted you that you believe provided you with a unique
25 insight with regard to the work that you were ultimately
0018
1 asked, that you were ultimately asked to do on behalf of
2 Jones Day?
3
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
4
A. It's not clear to me what you mean by unique
5 insight.
6
Q. Let me ask you this. In connection with the work
7 that you were asked to do at the request of Jones Day did
8 you implement and utilize generally accepted historical
9 protocols?
10
A. Yes.
11
Q. All right. Did you have to use any historical
12 methodology that is unique or different than that which is
13 generally accepted in the historical community in order to
14 do your work at the request of Jones Day?
15
A. The methodology is the regular process that I
16 follow, yes.
17
Q. Okay. And what is that process?
18
A. It's a process that I was trained in, and is the
19 one that I use always for my work. If you want me to
20 describe it --
21
Q. Please.
22
A. Okay. Well, in terms of research, there's a
23 research phase in which my primary task is to identify and
24 make notes of materials that I believe may be pertinent to
25 that study. The next phase would be an analysis of those
0019
1 sources. And in the process of that analysis I reach my
2 conclusions as a historian.
3
Q. Okay. So going back to 2001, when you had your
4 first contact on behalf of the cigarette companies, when
5 was it that you began to research and make notes?
6
A. I can't give you an exact date but I know that by
7 June of that year I was doing it.
8
Q. By June of 2001?
9
A. Correct.
10
Q. Okay. When you did that research did you do it
11 on your own or did you have the help of staff?

Q. Let me ask it this way. Did you do the research
14 on your own?
15
A. I did the research on my own and I may have
16 actually used some research assistants --
17
Q. Okay.
18
A. -- that I contacted for that purpose.
19
Q. Research assistants at UCF?
20
A. Well, at Rutgers, where I was teaching.
21
Q. Okay. You were at Rutgers at the time?
22
A. Yes. And since 2004 I've also used research
23 assistants, but not current students at UCF.
24
Q. Okay. All right. Now, when you began your work
25 in June of 2001 was it focused on the case that was pending
0020
1 in Puerto Rico?
2
A. It was focused on that but it also included
3 acquiring an understanding of the issue nationwide.
4
Q. Okay. And did you go to Puerto Rico as part of
5 your research regarding the Puerto Rican case?
6
A. Yes, I went to Puerto Rico.
7
Q. Okay. And why did you do that?
8
A. I do that as a general practice of a historian
9 who needs to find the relevant documentation which is often
10 found in the places themselves. So, those documents, in
11 order for me to access them, I had to go to Puerto Rico and
12 do research there.
13
Q. Okay. And where did you go in Puerto Rico to do
14 that research?
15
A. I can name a few. The main source was the
16 library at the University of Puerto Rico.
17
Q. Okay.
18
A. I also visited the library at the School of
19 Medical Science which is also part of the University of
20 Puerto Rico. I paid a visit to the National Archives of
21 Puerto Rico. I went to the library of the Senate in Puerto
22 Rico. Those are the ones that come to mind. There may be
23 others but I don't remember at this moment.
24
Q. Okay. And when you went to those places did you
25 look at archives, books, and periodicals in order to gather
0021
1 source materials?
2
A. Yes.
3
Q. And were you successful in gathering all of the
4 information that you believe was relevant for your
5 analysis?
6
A. Yes, I did.
7
Q. Okay. And when was it that you were in a
8 position to analyze all of the sources that you gathered in
9 Puerto Rico back then?
10
A. I don't have a precise date but it was either in
11 2001 or 2002.
12
Q. Okay. All right. And when did you reach your
13 conclusions relative to that work?
14
A. It's difficult to pinpoint that because there're
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]15 different levels of reaching conclusions. So I may have a
16 general conclusion at one point but then that is sustained
17 by the documentation at another point.
18
Q. What does that mean?
19
A. It means that as I start looking at the
20 materials, I get a sense of the picture and the, sometimes
21 it's called the hypothesis, and then gradually as I look
22 and examine the documents that conclusion could either
23 change or be retained.
24
Q. And when was it that you reached your initial
25 conclusions based on the work that you were asked to
0022
1 perform by Jones Day?
2
A. Probably by, the initial conclusion which is not
3 final, probably by the end of 2001.
4
Q. Okay. And what conclusions did you reach by the
5 end of 2001?
6
A. Again, this is tentative, it's not the final
7 conclusion, but by that time I had a good sense that
8 information about health consequences of smoking had
9 reached the Puerto Rican community through a variety of
10 means, and that that information was pervasive and
11 recurrent.
12
Q. Okay. And as a consequence of those opinions did
13 you provide trial testimony?
14
A. Yes, I did.
15
Q. And was that in that very case in Puerto Rico
16 that you were initially contacted about?
17
A. I don't know if it was the first case that I was
18 contacted about, but it was -- I testified on one occasion
19 in Puerto Rico.
20
Q. When was the first time that you provided trial
21 testimony connected with the research that you were asked
22 to perform by Jones Day?
23
A. I don't have that date in my mind.
24
Q. Would it have been close in time to 2001?
25
A. If I were to pick a date, and again this is just
0023
1 a calculation, I would say perhaps it was 2003, but again,
2 I'm not a hundred percent sure of that date.
3
Q. Now, is the subject matter that you were asked to
4 testify back in 2003, if that's an accurate date, is it
5 essentially the same subject matter that you have been
6 asked to testify about in connection with the case of
7 Juanita Thurston that we're here on today?
8
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
9
A. Yes, that was the substance, the same substance.
10
Q. And when we're talking about the subject are we
11 talking about the general awareness of health consequences
12 of smoking?
13
A. That was the central subject.
14
Q. Okay. And throughout the 11 or 12 years that you
15 have been doing work for cigarette companies have your
16 opinions regarding the general awareness of health
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]17 consequences of smoking been essentially the same?
18
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
19
A. My recollection is that for every case I found
20 that the awareness where the individuals lived, and many
21 times the individuals, themselves, that they were aware,
22 and certainly their communities were aware.
23
Q. Okay. Let me follow-up on that. You said the
24 awareness in the communities where the individuals lived
25 and sometimes the individuals, themselves, did I hear you
0024
1 correctly?
2
A. Yes.
3
Q. Okay.
4
A. Well, let me rephrase that if I may. I
5 understood having looked at the documentation that the time
6 and place where the individuals in the cases lived, those
7 communities were aware. In many, many cases -- and so, as
8 part of a community they all were, they had that awareness.
9
Q. Okay. I'm not sure how that modifies your
10 previous answer. So, are you assuming that if a community
11 where an individual lived was aware, that then the
12 individual within that community was also aware?
13
A. No, I'm not making those assumptions.
14
Q. Then, please help me understand better what you
15 mean by that.
16
A. Okay. I come to the conclusion that the
17 community in which they live is aware. And I also come to
18 the conclusion as a professional determination as a
19 historian that as members of those communities they were
20 exposed to the similar types of information that reached
21 that community. So, they were, I can't recall a case where
22 that was not the case, they were exposed to that
23 information.
24
Q. Okay. All right. Help me understand then how it
25 is that you are able to come to the conclusion as you have
0025
1 in the past that if a community is exposed to whatever
2 information it is that you believe it is that they were
3 exposed to, that the individual himself or herself is also
4 exposed to it?
5
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
6
A. Well, the other documentation that I used were
7 the case depositions. And I believe that in all of them,
8 not a hundred percent certain, but the ones that I recall
9 that each one of those depositions demonstrated the fact
10 that there was an awareness of the individual.
11
Q. Okay. So, from a historical research perspective
12 the things that you would look for in order to determine if
13 an individual was aware, and I use that term in the same
14 sense that you would use it, you would need to have first
15 hand knowledge that the individual was exposed to that
16 information, is that correct?
17
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to form.
18
A. I don't believe I would have to have first
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]19 testimonies to that effect about the individual. There are
20 many other mechanisms that I use for that. In other words,
21 if somebody went to a school and the school curriculum and
22 the materials and the textbooks made them aware of that,
23 that is a connection that I establish.
24
Q. Okay.
25
A. And that's just one example.
0026
1
Q. Okay. And we'll talk about that in a minute.
2 But can you give me some other examples that would help you
3 establish a foundation for an opinion that information that
4 was generally disseminated in a community would actually
5 reach the individual who was the subject of a particular
6 case?
7
A. Yes. In most cases there is information in the
8 depositions that allows me to make that connection. For
9 example, if the family subscribed to a newspaper, and that
10 newspaper, I can place that newspaper in their living room,
11 that is a source of information that reached that person.
12
Q. Okay. Can you give me any other such examples of
13 things that you would rely upon to establish a foundation
14 for an opinion that an individual was actually exposed to
15 the information that you believe that an entire community
16 was exposed to?
17
A. Yes. And again this is just an example. If I
18 know that an individual was in school at a particular time,
19 and I have the knowledge of what they were being taught
20 through textbooks and other means, that is another direct
21 connection that I established.
22
Q. So, when looking at the type of educational
23 materials that a subject was exposed to, help me understand
24 the historical research protocol that you would follow in
25 order to come to the conclusion that an individual was
0027
1 exposed to, let's say, you know, some hygiene manual or
2 information about the health consequences of smoking?
3
A. The methodology or the protocol?
4
Q. Right.
5
A. My work I would define as a social historian.
6 And what a social historian does is that they study
7 communities and are able to recreate life, knowledge,
8 practices, in those communities. And I use that
9 methodology. Now, for these cases I also happen to have
10 specific information about the individuals. And mostly
11 that comes through the depositions. So, in reality I use
12 both.
13
Q. Okay. All right. So you're looking at
14 depositions and then you're looking at the universe of
15 information that you have gathered on the subject?
16
A. Correct.
17
Q. All right. And then you try and see if there is
18 a correlation?
19
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
20
A. I wouldn't use the word correlation.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]21
Q. What word would you use?
22
A. I would say that one set of materials, the
23 universal sources, allows me to understand the setting in
24 which these persons lived. And the other set of documents
25 speaks mostly about the individual. So, I use both and
0028
1 it's not a matter of correlation. It's a matter of
2 understanding a setting and understanding a community and
3 also understanding the particulars of one individual.
4
Q. All right. Okay. And did you apply that
5 research methodology and protocol when evaluating the case
6 that we're on, that we're here on today?
7
A. Yes, the same.
8
Q. Okay. All right. Let's get some housekeeping
9 out of the way then. And do you have in front of you your
10 notice of deposition for today? If not, I've got it here
11 on my computer, I'll show it to you.
12
MR. KEEHFUS: We've got it.
13
Q. Okay. All right. What I'd like to do is
14 basically walk you through the duces tecum part of the
15 notice which is the part of the notice that asks you to
16 bring documents, okay? I think, if you'll flip to Page 2,
17 if I'm not mistaken, the list there begins.
18
A. Yes.
19
Q. And what we'll do is we will mark this notice as
20 Plaintiff's Exhibit 1 for identification, and I will try
21 and keep a running list.
22
MR. GARCIA: By the way, if you need to take a
23
break at any time --
24
THE WITNESS: I could use a bathroom break.
25
MR. GARCIA: Let's do that, while I get this set
0029
1
up.
2
(Recess taken).
3 BY MR. GARCIA:
4
Q. Doctor, you know the drill. I'm going to just
5 tick these off one by one, and you tell me or show me what
6 you have brought with you in response to each request,
7 okay?
8
A. Yes.
9
Q. So, No. 1 of the Notice of Deposition that will
10 be marked as Plaintiff's 1. What did you bring?
11
A. May I read them?
12
Q. Yeah.
13
A. Okay. Yes. One document that I have is notes
14 that I've taken.
15
Q. May I see that, please?
16
A. (Hands document to counsel).
17
Q. Let me ask you this question. We will mark this
18 composite exhibit as Notes for Odom Case.
19
And let me ask you this question. In advance of
20 your deposition today I received a Reliance List, okay?
21 And in reviewing the Reliance List the very last item on
22 it, I'm going to show you this here in a second, is an item
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]23 numbered 5434 on this 180 page Reliance List called
24 Additional Odom Materials and it's identified as
25 AWX-006437.
0030
1
So, my question is, is this composite exhibit
2 which we will mark as Exhibit 2 the document, the very last
3 document that is included in the Reliance List?
4
A. I would like to see the document.
5
Q. Sure.
6
A. It's just with the number.
7
Q. Did you happen to bring with you today with your
8 materials a Reliance List?
9
A. A Reliance List? That is --
10
MR. KEEHFUS: I don't know if this will help you
11
or clear things up. What you have in front of you,
12
that composite exhibit are the notes that Dr. Martinez
13
has taken during his historical research. There are
14
some things that may fall into that last entry on the
15
Reliance List but that is not one of them. And I
16
don't know if that helps you or clears anything up.
17
MR. GARCIA: I'm not sure I understand what you
18
meant by that last part.
19
MR. KEEHFUS: That's not a "reliance document".
20
Those are notes that he has taken on documents that he
21
has looked at in his historical research.
22
MR. GARCIA: Okay. Then let me look at something
23
real quick before we go any further.
24
Okay. I think I understand what you're saying.
25
Okay. Got it.
0031
1
I am marking Notes for Odom Case as Exhibit 2 for
2
identification.
3 BY MR. GARCIA:
4
Q. All right. So help me understand what is
5 contained in this Composite Exhibit No. 2?
6
A. That's a collection of notes from a variety of
7 sources that I believe would be helpful for my presentation
8 in this case. Now, there may be other materials that are
9 not there that are also important which is actually a fact.
10
Q. Did you create Exhibit No. 2?
11
A. Yes.
12
Q. And this is all your work?
13
A. It's all my work.
14
Q. You typed all this out yourself?
15
A. May I take a look at it?
16
Q. Yeah.
17
A. Okay. I typed this document. I have used in the
18 past the help of a person who is a professional at
19 transcribing. And some of those transcriptions may have
20 been cut and pasted into this document.
21
Q. When you say transcription, this is something
22 that was typed up from something that you dictated?
23
A. Not dictated, no. It was actual materials, for
24 example, if there is a textbook page, I may not write it
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]25 myself, but somebody else wrote it based on my instructions
0032
1 to type the segments that I want that person to do.
2
Q. I see. Okay. All right. And is Exhibit 2
3 everything that you brought with you in response to Item 1
4 of the Subpoena Duces Tecum?
5
A. There are other items.
6
Q. Okay. Let's go ahead and identify them, so that
7 we have them handy.
8
A. Well, the bulk of them are in the disks. I have
9 some other ones here.
10
Q. Okay. And when you say some other ones, are
11 these items that were not included on the disks?
12
A. For example, I don't believe that that was
13 included on the disk. Actually it wasn't.
14
Q. Just so that we understand what "that" is, what
15 you're telling me is that what we have marked as your Notes
16 for the Odom Case as Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 2, this is an
17 item that was not included in the disks?
18
A. It was not included in the disks, that's right.
19
Q. And so we know that what the disks are for the
20 record, does the Reliance List that you have in front of
21 you, which we'll discuss in a minute, reflect every item
22 that was included in the disks?
23
A. I believe so, yes.
24
Q. Okay. Did you prepare the Reliance List?
25
A. In terms of putting it together with the format,
0033
1 I did not do that. But in terms of providing the
2 bibliographical information or the sources, that's what I
3 did.
4
Q. So what you're telling me -- strike that. Who
5 prepared the Reliance List?
6
A. As a document, it was prepared by the lawyers.
7
Q. Okay. What you're telling me is you provided all
8 of your source materials to the lawyers and then the
9 lawyers in turn organized and categorized and organized
10 this Reliance List?
11
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
12
A. That is my understanding.
13
Q. Okay. And now, the Reliance List that I was
14 provided has a date at the top, and the date of the
15 Reliance List that I have is August 8, 2012. My question
16 is, is that the date of the Reliance List that you have?
17
A. That's correct.
18
Q. Okay. And the Reliance List that I have is
19 comprised of a total of 180 pages. So my question is, is
20 the Reliance List in front of you comprised of 180 pages?
21
A. Yes.
22
Q. Okay. And is the very last item, at Page 180 of
23 the Reliance List, Item 5434, entitled Additional Odom
24 Materials?
25
A. That's what it says, yes.
0034
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]1
Q. And then on that, if we look over to the right
2 there on the Reliance List there's a code of AWX-006437, is
3 that right?
4
A. Yes.
5
Q. And that's simply a way to index where I can find
6 those materials on the three disks, correct?
7
A. Correct.
8
Q. Okay. All right. And so, what you're telling me
9 is that Exhibit 2 is not part of the item that is
10 identified on the Reliance List as Additional Odom
11 Materials, correct?
12
A. That's correct.
13
Q. Okay. All right. So, let's go back to the duces
14 tecum list and tell me what else you brought with you in
15 response to Item No. 1?
16
A. I have another set of notes, which are basically
17 the same in terms of their substance.
18
Q. Okay.
19
A. (Hands document to counsel).
20
Q. Okay. We'll mark these notes as Plaintiff's
21 Exhibit 3 for identification. And this is another
22 composite exhibit. Tell me what this is, please?
23
A. These are notes from a variety of sources that
24 supplement that other list that I gave you previously,
25 which I believe is Exhibit 2.
0035
1
Q. Like Exhibit 2, is Exhibit 3 a document that you
2 yourself created?
3
A. I created this document, yes.
4
Q. Okay. All right. And you described it as a
5 supplement to the notes reflected in Exhibit 2, correct?
6
A. Companion, supplement.
7
Q. Okay. And when did you prepare Exhibit 3?
8
A. This is something that I would have prepared in
9 July.
10
Q. Of 2012?
11
A. Yes. Probably June.
12
Q. When did you prepare Exhibit 2?
13
A. Exhibit 2, I would say basically, roughly the
14 same time. I mean, one was produced before the other.
15
Q. Which one was produced first?
16
A. I believe it was this one, Exhibit 3.
17
Q. This one is Exhibit 3. All right. So, Exhibit 3
18 was prepared first, and then you prepared Exhibit 2?
19
A. That's my belief.
20
Q. Okay. And you believe that you prepared Exhibits
21 2 and 3 sometime in June or July 2012, correct?
22
A. It would have been June or July.
23
Q. Okay. While we're on that topic, when were you
24 initially contacted to do work relative to the case of
25 Juanita Thurston?
0036
1
A. I don't recall the date. It was 2012.
2
Q. Okay. Do you have any paperwork in your file
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]3 that would help us determine as accurately as possible when
4 it was that you were initially contacted to perform work on
5 this case?
6
A. No.
7
Q. Absolutely nothing?
8
A. No, there's no record of that as far as I know.
9 What I could tell you is when I started researching for
10 Odom, that I can tell you with certainty, but not when I
11 was contacted.
12
Q. When did you start doing research for Odom?
13
A. If I may refer to one of the documents, June
14 30th.
15
Q. 2012, right?
16
A. 2012.
17
Q. All right. Can we assume that you were contacted
18 close in time to that date to begin work on this case?
19
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to form.
20
A. We can assume that.
21
Q. All right. Okay. What else did you bring with
22 you in response to Item 1 of the duces tecum?
23
A. Okay. Let's see. These are also notes, and
24 these are notes that I've taken as I read the depositions
25 and related documents for the Odom case.
0037
1
Q. Okay. I apologize if I asked this question
2 already, but going back to Exhibit 3, which would be your
3 initial notes on the Odom case, is Exhibit 3 an item that
4 is reflected in the Reliance List to the best of your
5 knowledge?
6
A. No.
7
Q. It is not?
8
A. No.
9
Q. Okay. All right. Let's mark what you've just
10 handed me as Plaintiff's Exhibit 4, and this is another
11 composite exhibit and it consists of handwritten notes,
12 correct?
13
A. Correct.
14
Q. All right. And what is this Exhibit 4?
15
A. As I do for every case, I write on the top the
16 name of the case and some basic information which I gather
17 from, I guess they're called responses to interrogatories,
18 so I take notes of that. And then I begin to read the
19 depositions and as I read them I make notes of -- I make
20 notes about them.
21
Q. Okay.
22
A. So this is what the document is.
23
Q. All right. So, would Exhibit 4 reflect all of
24 the, what we call discovery, which includes deposition
25 testimony that you reviewed relative to this case?
0038
1
A. Yes. It includes all of the ones that I
2 reviewed.
3
Q. At least everything that you reviewed and are
4 relying upon in order to provide your opinions in this
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]5 case, correct?
6
A. At this point, yes.
7
Q. Okay. Thanks. So, what are we going to call
8 Exhibit 4, what do you call it?
9
A. I would call it Notes on Depositions, Odom Case.
10
Q. The first page of Exhibit 4 has a No. 58 at the
11 top.
12
A. Yes.
13
Q. Pound sign and the number 58, what is that?
14
A. I have many similar sets of documents, and what I
15 do is I give them a number to separate them from others.
16
Q. Well, a couple of pages have the number 58 at the
17 top. Does that number correspond to a system that you use
18 to categorize documents?
19
A. May I take a look?
20
Q. Yeah, I think it's on the first two pages.
21
A. I only put those numbers on the front page and
22 what we have here is a duplication of the same.
23
Q. I see. Well, how did you determine to put the
24 No. 58 at the top of the first page?
25
A. Because I do them by numbers to identify my
0039
1 notebooks similar to this.
2
Q. All right. What do you mean notebooks?
3
A. Legal pads or notes.
4
Q. Oh, okay, you just number them?
5
A. I number them.
6
Q. And you put them in a file somewhere?
7
A. Yes, I do.
8
Q. So this would be pad No. 58?
9
A. 58.
10
Q. On the Odom case?
11
A. Odom case.
12
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
13
MR. GARCIA: He's objecting because I'm asking
14
leading questions, just to move this along or whatever
15
reason.
16
MR. KEEHFUS: No, and let me -- I'm not. But you
17
said this would be No. 58 on the Odom case, and I
18
don't know that that's accurate.
19 BY MR. GARCIA:
20
Q. Oh, okay. Please correct me.
21
A. Yes. It's No. 58 and it's on the Odom case. And
22 this is the one that I have, the only one that I have for
23 this case. In other words, previous numbers are pertinent
24 to other cases.
25
Q. Oh, I see. You just number your notepads?
0040
1
A. Correct.
2
Q. I see. Okay. Got it. Thanks for clarifying
3 that. So, really the No. 58 means nothing to this case?
4
A. Not to the case.
5
Q. All right. Okay. What other documents did you
6 bring with you in response to the Item 1 of the duces
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]7 tecum?
8
A. I have a list of sources that are of interest to
9 me for this case. Of course, you have the bulk of the
10 sources already on the disk, but this is additional and I
11 believe this is on the disk. I believe it is.
12
Q. All right.
13
A. Not a hundred percent sure.
14
Q. We'll take a look and see, but let's go ahead and
15 get this one marked. And before we do, was Exhibit No. 4,
16 your notes regarding the depositions in the Odom case, a
17 document that is reflected on the Reliance List?
18
A. No.
19
Q. Okay. We'll mark this next composite exhibit as
20 No. 5. And what are we going to call this one?
21
A. I believe there's a title on top.
22
Q. It says Odom New Sources, August 13, 2012.
23
A. Correct.
24
Q. Okay. And is Exhibit 5 to your knowledge
25 reflected on the Reliance List?
0041
1
A. To my knowledge, yes.
2
Q. Okay. And you've got the Reliance List in front
3 of you. Where is that document on the Reliance List?
4
A. It's under the very last item, Additional Odom
5 Materials. That's my belief.
6
Q. Okay. What is the item number associated with
7 what you believe to be Exhibit 5?
8
A. 5434.
9
Q. And what is the code so that I can find it on the
10 disk?
11
A. AWX-006437.
12
Q. Okay. And I've got that document in front of me
13 on my computer because I've got access to the disks. And
14 when I pull up that document, and I'll show it to you and
15 we will mark it as an exhibit, the very top says Odom
16 Sources, and then in parentheses, August 4, 11:30 a.m. Can
17 you see that, doctor?
18
A. Yes, I see that.
19
Q. Okay. Do you agree with me that what I just
20 showed you on the computer, which we will mark as Exhibit
21 No. 6 for identification, does not appear to be the same
22 document as what we have just marked as No. 5?
23
A. It's not the same document.
24
Q. Do you know why it's not the same document?
25
A. Because it -- in essence it's the same thing, but
0042
1 some of the sources appear there, and other sources appear
2 in another document which is the one that you showed me.
3
Q. Okay. So, there are some sources on what we have
4 just marked as Exhibit 5, which do not appear on the
5 document that I just pulled from the disk as reflected in
6 the Reliance List?
7
A. That's correct.
8
Q. Okay. Which begs the question, can I rely on the
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]9 documents on the Reliance List to be accurate if in fact
10 Exhibit 5 is not what you believe it is?
11
A. No. I know what it is. There's a document --
12
Q. While you're flipping through your pages, I'm
13 going to go ahead and email the document that we were just
14 looking at in the computer, which we will mark as Exhibit
15 6, okay?
16
So, let me see if we can get this squared away.
17 For purposes of your testimony at trial are you going to
18 rely on Item 5434 as reflected on the Reliance List which
19 we have marked as Exhibit 6 --
20
A. Yes.
21
Q. -- or, hang on, or on Exhibit No. 5 which is the
22 one that you brought with you today?
23
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to form.
24
A. May I take a look at Exhibit 2?
25
Q. (Hands document to witness).
0043
1
A. Maybe one of the others.
2
Q. Here.
3
A. There are two possibilities. One of them is that
4 the one, the last one that we looked at --
5
Q. Yeah, Exhibit 6 from the computer file --
6
A. Yes.
7
Q. -- right?
8
A. May have been accidentally at the time of
9 photocopying be here.
10
Q. What is here, in Exhibits 2, 3 or 4?
11
A. Yes. That's one possibility. The other
12 possibility -- well, you have the document.
13
Q. Yeah, the computer document that I got from the
14 disks that correspond with the Reliance List.
15
A. Okay. Is there just one document there?
16
Q. Well, let me tell you this. The document that we
17 marked as Exhibit 6 is entitled Odom Sources, August 4,
18 11:30 a.m., it consists of 103 pages.
19
A. There are two similar documents, which I believe
20 you have there. One refers to 11:30.
21
Q. A.m., right?
22
A. A.m., and the other refers to 4.
23
Q. 4 what?
24
A. In the afternoon, the same day.
25
Q. Okay. August 4, 4 p.m.?
0044
1
A. Yes.
2
Q. Okay. All right. Where would I find the 4 p.m.
3 document?
4
A. My belief is that it would be included under
5 Additional Odom Materials.
6
Q. Oh, okay. Let me flip through it real quick and
7 see if I can find that reference. While I'm flipping
8 through it, what is the document that we marked as Exhibit
9 6, which begins with August 4, 11:30 a.m.?
10
A. That is a list of sources for the Odom case.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]11
Q. Okay. And what is the document which you believe
12 is included here, that has the 4 p.m. reference?
13
A. It's the same type of document but it's new
14 documents, in other words, documents, I produced that after
15 11:30 that day.
16
Q. I see. It's additional source materials,
17 essentially?
18
A. Yes.
19
Q. Okay. And in the files that you brought with you
20 today do you have a copy of the 11:30 a.m. document?
21
A. There's a copy -- 11:30, yes, I do have it.
22
Q. Okay. You made reference to a 4 p.m. entry?
23
A. Correct.
24
Q. All right. You've got in your hand there a hard
25 copy of the one that begins 11:30 a.m., does that include
0045
1 the 4 p.m. documents?
2
A. If I can have a few minutes to look through it.
3
Q. Yeah. Go ahead.
4
A. No.
5
Q. Does the document that you are holding in your
6 hand only include the 11:30 a.m. materials?
7
A. That's my understanding, yes.
8
MR. GARCIA: Okay. Is that a copy that we can
9
mark and attach to this deposition, Jason?
10
MR. KEEHFUS: Yes.
11 BY MR. GARCIA:
12
Q. Let's do that. And, so, we will mark this hard
13 copy as Plaintiff's Exhibit 7. And that's another
14 composite exhibit entitled Odom Sources, August 4, 11:30
15 a.m.
16
So, do you have with you the 4 p.m. documents
17 that you were referencing?
18
A. My understanding is that it may -- it should be
19 included in the electronic files. I'm looking through them
20 now, the rest of my materials, and I don't see those.
21
Q. All right.
22
A. If you have it there --
23
Q. Yeah.
24
A. It's part of my -- the materials that I brought
25 in this case, on the disk.
0046
1
Q. All right. Well, in looking at the materials on
2 the disk, specifically the exhibit that we marked as No. 6,
3 on Page 99 of 103, there appears a title that says
4 Supplemental List Materials Odom, August 4, 2012, 6 p.m.
5 Let me show you that.
6
A. I see that, yes.
7
Q. Okay. Is that 6 p.m. entry different than the
8 4 p.m. entry that you were referencing or do you believe
9 that you were mistaken about the time?
10
A. Yeah. I was off by two hours, but this is the
11 one that I've been referring to.
12
Q. Okay. Now that I'm comparing the hard copy with,
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]13 which we've marked as Exhibit 7, with the computer copy
14 which we've marked as 6, I think I understand what
15 happened.
16
Do you agree with me that the last item on
17 Plaintiff's Exhibit 7, which is a composite exhibit of
18 double-sided information, meaning the information is
19 printed on both sides of the page, ends with a document
20 entitled "Seven of ten people knew that November 19 was the
21 ACS smokeout day"?
22
A. This last page does not belong here. In the
23 process of copying them, I believe that it got inserted
24 here, but it doesn't belong here.
25
Q. Now I'm really confused. Okay. Let me -- show
0047
1 me what you're referring to. You're holding Exhibit 7.
2 The reason I ask, I'm looking at the same page on the
3 computer. So, tell me why it is that you don't -- that you
4 believe this last page should not be part of Exhibit 7?
5
A. Because those are notes, not just the source,
6 bibliographically described.
7
Q. Okay. Why does that matter to you in analyzing
8 Exhibit 7?
9
A. I don't understand.
10
Q. All I'm asking you is, does the last page of
11 Exhibit 7 contain a, the last entry, something called
12 "Seven of nine people knew," etc.?
13
A. Yes.
14
Q. Okay. Correct?
15
A. I see that.
16
Q. Let me show you what appears on Page 98 of the
17 computer form, do you agree with me it's the same article?
18
A. May I take a look?
19
Q. Yeah.
20
A. Yes, it's the same.
21
Q. Okay. And then, the next page which is Page 99
22 is the page that contains the, that starts with
23 Supplemental List Materials Odom, August 4, 2012, at
24 6 p.m., correct?
25
A. At 6 p.m., I don't have a paper copy of that.
0048
1
Q. I understand. So --
2
A. Okay.
3
Q. It looks like the only difference between Exhibit
4 6 and Exhibit 7 is that Exhibit 7, that hard copy in front
5 of you, doesn't include the supplemental list materials,
6 August 4, 2012, at 6 p.m.?
7
A. I would have to look through it carefully.
8 There's a possibility that in the printing process,
9 photocopying process, that they were inadvertently included
10 here. Now --
11
Q. When you say here, inadvertently included in
12 Exhibit 7?
13
A. Correct.
14
Q. Like they're mixed in there somewhere?
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]15
A. It's a possibility.
16
Q. All right.
17
A. This may clarify the confusion. There are two
18 documents. There's one from 11:30 and one from 6:00 and
19 they're both there. So, those are the accurate documents.
20 I don't know if this one matches that one or not. It's
21 something that we could go through if you want.
22
Q. No. I just want to establish, I think you've
23 just addressed my concern, and that is, when it comes to
24 the trial of this case, will I be able to rely on the
25 computer version which we've identified as Exhibit 6 --
0049
1
A. Yes.
2
Q. -- as the more reliable version?
3
A. It may be equally reliable, but it is reliable.
4
Q. Well, reliable from the standpoint it has
5 everything that it should have --
6
A. Yes.
7
Q. -- right?
8
A. Yes.
9
Q. So we can throw Exhibit 7 away, as a matter of
10 speaking. We'll keep it. Okay. What else did you bring
11 with you in response to Item 1 of the duces tecum?
12
A. These are your documents.
13
Q. Yeah. Thanks.
14
A. I have emails of communications between myself
15 and the Jones Day lawyers.
16
MR. GARCIA: Okay. Anything in there, Jason,
17
that needs to be redacted or identified?
18
MR. KEEHFUS: No.
19 BY MR. GARCIA:
20
Q. Okay. Then, let's mark it as the next exhibit.
21 So, we will mark the Odom Case Emails as Exhibit No. 8 for
22 identification. Okay. Is Exhibit No. 8 something that's
23 on the Reliance List?
24
A. No.
25
Q. And are these emails in chronological order?
0050
1
A. Reverse chronological order.
2
Q. So the last document should be the first email
3 communication?
4
A. Correct.
5
Q. Who is Dawn E. McFadden?
6
A. She's a lawyer in the Jones Day firm.
7
Q. Okay. And is the Luis Martinez referenced in
8 this last page of Exhibit 8 you?
9
A. Yes.
10
Q. All right. And what Dawn McFadden is saying to
11 you is, here's a draft of your disclosure for the Odom
12 case. Please give me a call after you had a chance to
13 review it, correct?
14
A. That's what I recall, yes.
15
Q. And what is the disclosure that Dawn is
16 referencing in this email?
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]17
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
18
A. I believe that it is the document in which my
19 credentials are established and where I present what my
20 conclusions will be.
21
Q. Okay. And the foundation for those conclusions?
22
A. Yes, the types of sources.
23
Q. And this is an email from Dawn to you on May 23,
24 2012, correct?
25
A. If that's what it says there, that's it.
0051
1
Q. We can rely on that date?
2
A. Sure.
3
Q. Does that refresh your recollection with regard
4 to when it was that you were first contacted for work on
5 the Odom case?
6
A. Can you repeat the date?
7
Q. May 23, 2012.
8
A. Okay. It helps me understand that it was most
9 likely earlier in May, but it's possible that it may have
10 been April.
11
Q. Okay. Now, what email address is Dawn sending
12 these communications to?
13
A. Culturaltranslations@yahoo.com.
14
Q. And that's the email address that you use for
15 your work for Jones Day?
16
A. That's correct.
17
Q. Okay. All right. And does Exhibit 8 contain all
18 of your emails relative to this case?
19
A. I searched thoroughly and those were the ones
20 that came up.
21
Q. And when you do work on a particular case do you
22 create a directory in your computer in order to store the
23 communications relative to that case?
24
A. Sometimes I do have folders within my email that
25 include communications via email that pertain to a
0052
1 particular case. And that is the situation with the Odom
2 case.
3
Q. Okay. Well, let me show you a document that we
4 will mark as Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 9 for identification,
5 it is your disclosure as a witness in this case, okay?
6 We'll call it Dr. Martinez-Fernandez expert disclosure.
7 And you'll have to indulge me, I'm going to ask you to look
8 at it here on my computer.
9
THE WITNESS: May I take a bathroom break?
10
MR. GARCIA: Yeah, sure, take as many as you
11
want. Let's take a break.
12
(Recess taken).
13 BY MR. GARCIA:
14
Q. I've marked as Exhibit 9 your expert disclosure.
15 Do you have it up on the screen there, Jason?
16
MR. KEEHFUS: Yes.
17
Q. Would you take a look at it, doctor, and tell me
18 if that two-page document is the disclosure that was
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]19 discussed in the May 23, 2012, email with Dawn McFadden of
20 Jones Day?
21
A. It was the one that was discussed.
22
Q. Please take your time to look at it, confirm that
23 for me.
24
A. There may have been some minor changes between
25 what she sent, I don't know whether this one is the one
0053
1 that she sent first.
2
Q. Is the one that we have marked as Exhibit 9 the
3 disclosure that has your stamp of approval?
4
A. I don't know whether this is the draft that I
5 received --
6
Q. Yeah.
7
A. -- or this is one in which I may have asked for
8 changes. I don't know that.
9
Q. All I'm asking you is do you approve of the
10 disclosure which we have marked as Exhibit 9?
11
A. I would have to read it completely.
12
Q. Please take your time. I'm going to get some
13 water. And as you're taking your time to look through
14 that, doctor, let me represent to you that that is the
15 disclosure that was filed by the defendants with the court.
16
A. Okay. Yes, this is accurate except for one
17 change.
18
Q. Okay. Tell us what the change should be?
19
A. In the last sentence where it says
20 Dr. Martinez-Fernandez's involvement as an expert witness
21 has averaged approximately 10 percent of his time devoted
22 to professional activities, the new estimate is 15 percent.
23
Q. Okay. And since when has it been 15 percent?
24
A. I was asked to have that information ready so I
25 calculated that and it's accurate. When it changed, I
0054
1 don't know.
2
Q. Okay. When you say that you were asked to
3 calculate that information and have it ready, was that in
4 relationship to your deposition here today?
5
A. Correct.
6
Q. Okay. Who asked you to do that?
7
A. It was James.
8
Q. The mystery fellow on the other side of the
9 table?
10
MR. KEEHFUS: It's James Small from Jones Day.
11
Q. Okay. So, anything else that looks inaccurate to
12 you?
13
A. No.
14
Q. All right. Other than that one change do you
15 believe that the disclosure that we have marked as Exhibit
16 9 is the disclosure that was sent to you for your approval
17 back on May 23, 2012, as reflected in the emails?
18
A. I'm not a hundred percent sure because I may have
19 asked for some minor changes. So, the way to do that would
20 be to compare the draft with the one that was actually
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]21 filed. In essence, it's the same thing.
22
Q. Okay. Well, I don't see any other emails in
23 Plaintiff's Exhibit 8 concerning the disclosure. So would
24 it be safe to assume that if there were any changes to the
25 proposed disclosure that was sent to you by Jones Day back
0055
1 in May, on May 23, 2012, that you would have made any
2 changes to it close in time to that date, and just emailed
3 those changes then?
4
A. I communicated the changes and it was a phone
5 conversation.
6
Q. Okay. And when did that phone conversation take
7 place?
8
A. It would have taken place shortly after I
9 received this one.
10
Q. Shortly after you received this email on May 23,
11 2012, at 2:23 p.m.?
12
A. Correct.
13
Q. Okay. So, it would have happened that same day?
14
A. Either the same day or the following day.
15
Q. Okay. So, at the very latest, you would have
16 approved the disclosure that we have marked as Exhibit 9 on
17 May 24, 2012, correct?
18
A. That is the best answer I can give you, the most
19 accurate one, but it's possible that it may have been the
20 25th or 26th. Now, I believe that it was closer than that.
21 So, my estimate is that it was either on the day that I
22 received the draft or the following day.
23
Q. Okay. In any event, by Memorial Day 2012 you
24 approved the disclosure that we have marked as Exhibit 9,
25 is that correct?
0056
1
A. Memorial Day --
2
Q. May 25th, 2012.
3
A. Yes.
4
Q. Thank you, sir.
5
A. I believe that that's accurate.
6
Q. I gave you another day of wiggle room.
7
A. I don't remember the exact day when I
8 communicated the changes. My recollection is that it was
9 shortly thereafter, most likely the same day or the
10 following day.
11
Q. Okay. What is the next document that you brought
12 with you in response to Item 1 of the duces tecum?
13
A. I have a set of notes with me which I took at the
14 Palm Beach County Museum.
15
Q. Which Palm Beach County Museum?
16
A. The one, it's right next to the courthouse, and
17 it's where the offices of the Historical Society is.
18
Q. We will mark your notes from your visit to the
19 Palm Beach County Museum as Plaintiff's Exhibit 10 for
20 identification. Who did you meet with there at the museum?
21
A. Her name is Debbie Murray.
22
Q. Why did you go to the Palm Beach County Museum?
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]23
A. Because I believed that I could find relevant
24 materials there.
25
Q. What day did you visit the museum?
0057
1
A. I wrote the date at the top.
2
Q. August 7, 2012?
3
A. That's correct.
4
Q. Thank you. And did you find materials that you
5 believe were useful to you for your work in this case?
6
A. Yes.
7
Q. And did you copy them?
8
A. I made notes.
9
Q. Okay. So, you did not copy them?
10
A. There's something here which -- (hands document
11 to counsel).
12
Q. You just handed me a single page. Is this a copy
13 of the documents that you obtained at the history museum?
14
A. I obtained other copies.
15
Q. Do you have them with you?
16
A. I don't have them with me.
17
Q. Are they part of the information that's included
18 in the Reliance List?
19
A. No.
20
Q. Okay. I will mark this copy that you brought
21 with you as Exhibit 11. Is there a reason why you didn't
22 bring the other copies with you, doctor?
23
A. I just made copies and I have not looked at them.
24
Q. Oh, okay. Do you expect to look at them before
25 the trial of this case?
0058
1
A. Yes, I do.
2
Q. All right. When do you plan to do that?
3
A. Within the next two weeks.
4
Q. Okay. And in terms of quantity of materials that
5 you need to review, what are we talking about?
6
A. Maybe 30 pages.
7
Q. All right. And what are they copies of?
8
A. They're copies of materials, books, for example,
9 that I believe can be of use in this case to me, which I
10 have not assessed or evaluated.
11
Q. Are they -- strike that. What books?
12
A. I don't recall the names right now. I don't
13 recall the names.
14
Q. Are they school books?
15
A. No. These are mostly books which tell the
16 history of the locations that I'm studying, for example, a
17 history of Palm Beach or a history of Pompano Beach.
18
Q. Going back to Exhibit 10, what do these notes
19 reflect?
20
A. May I take a look at that?
21
Q. Yeah.
22
A. I have a copy here.
23
Q. In a general sense.
24
A. It starts with notes from a book, and they're
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]25 notes from some of the documents that I saw, all of these
0059
1 at the Palm Beach History Museum.
2
Q. Okay. And I gather from your notes that you were
3 trying to get a sense for black history in the community of
4 Palm Beach County, is that accurate?
5
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
6
A. Yes.
7
Q. I mean, that's what your notes say, they
8 reference black history, is that what you were attempting
9 to accomplish?
10
A. That's part of what I was attempting to
11 accomplish.
12
Q. What else were you attempting to accomplish
13 during your visit to the Palm Beach County Museum?
14
A. To get a sense of the progress of education.
15
Q. Anything else?
16
A. Any things that I believe would allow me to get a
17 good grasp of the communities where Juanita Thurston lived.
18
Q. And were the documents that you reviewed at the
19 Palm Beach County Museum helpful?
20
A. Yes.
21
Q. Were they useful?
22
A. Yes.
23
Q. And did you rely upon them in order to articulate
24 your opinions in this case?
25
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
0060
1
A. The ones that I was able to review?
2
Q. Yeah.
3
A. Yes.
4
Q. Okay. What else did you bring with you in
5 response to Item 1 of the duces tecum?
6
A. I have some -- actually I have this document.
7
Q. What is this document?
8
A. These are photocopies of Polk's, Pompano Beach
9 City Directory, 1955.
10
Q. What is that?
11
A. This is similar to a phone book but it has more
12 information about where individuals lived, what kinds of
13 papers, newspapers circulated, businesses, that type of
14 information.
15
Q. Okay. Where did you get it?
16
A. This I got at the Broward County Historical
17 Commission.
18
Q. Okay. And I will mark that as Exhibit 12 for
19 identification. And of what relevance is Exhibit 12 to
20 this particular case?
21
A. It's relevant because it provides information
22 about the community, and it also provides information about
23 the Thurston family.
24
Q. Okay. What in particular?
25
A. Okay. There's a list of inhabitants and I find
0061
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]1 Juanita included in the Thurston family.
2
Q. Is that on the second page of Exhibit 12?
3
A. Yes.
4
Q. Okay. Anything else other than what's reflected
5 on the second page of Exhibit 12?
6
A. The third page would be a larger, an enlarged
7 copy of that, of the same one, which focuses on the
8 Thurston family.
9
Q. All right. Anything else in that exhibit?
10
A. Let's see. There is a similar entry for Ely
11 Blanche.
12
Q. Okay. Who is that?
13
A. Ely Blanche is a pioneer of education for blacks
14 in Pompano Beach.
15
Q. All right. Blanche is the first name and Ely is
16 the last name, correct?
17
A. Blanche Ely.
18
Q. Correct.
19
A. There's a middle name, which, I don't know
20 whether it appears here.
21
Q. General, right?
22
A. Yes.
23
Q. Like General in an army.
24
A. The G --
25
Q. Right.
0062
1
A. -- appears here.
2
Q. Right. And is there any relationship between
3 Blanche Ely and Juanita Thurston?
4
A. Yes.
5
Q. What's the relationship?
6
A. Juanita attended the school where Blanche Ely was
7 principal.
8
Q. Okay. Anything else?
9
A. Yes. Let's see. Hammondville Road is a road
10 where the bulk of African-American businesses were located.
11
Q. In Pompano?
12
A. In Pompano. So, here is a copy of the page
13 within the directory that mentions the individuals and
14 businesses that were located on Hammondville Road.
15
Q. What page of Exhibit 12 are you on?
16
A. 5.
17
Q. Thanks. And of what relevance is that to the
18 Juanita Thurston case?
19
A. I wanted to be familiar with her surroundings and
20 that's the area where she lived.
21
Q. Okay. What else?
22
A. The next page is a larger size image of the
23 information that I just stated.
24
Q. Okay.
25
A. And that holds true also for the following page.
0063
1
Q. Okay.
2
A. The next page includes names of newspapers
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]3 relevant to Pompano Beach.
4
Q. And what are they?
5
A. Delray Beach News and County News, Fort
6 Lauderdale Daily News, Pompano Beach Sun, and the Pompano
7 Beach Town News.
8
Q. As part of your work in this case, were you able
9 to research those particular newspapers?
10
A. I haven't researched them. I've identified them
11 and I plan to read those in the near future.
12
Q. Okay.
13
A. Not all of them, I should say.
14
Q. Have you determined whether there are archives
15 for those four newspapers that you just mentioned?
16
A. I determined that for the Pompano Beach Town
17 News. I searched for the Pompano Beach Sun and it was
18 nowhere to be found. Fort Lauderdale Daily News, I believe
19 that I've looked at this one in the past. The paper
20 changed names over the years. And then the last one which
21 is the one on top, Delray Beach News and County News, and
22 again, I was not able to find archives for that one.
23
Q. To the extent that you have already conducted any
24 research of those newspapers, have you already identified
25 articles from those periodicals that you will introduce as
0064
1 evidence in the trial of this case?
2
A. Yes.
3
Q. Okay. Do you have --
4
A. That I may, I'm not sure whether I will.
5
Q. Fair enough. Do you have them with you?
6
A. I don't have them because it's just photocopies,
7 it's actually printouts from the newspapers, which I have
8 not read. The reason why I believe that they may be
9 useful, I haven't made that determination, is because there
10 was a particular section in the newspaper that dealt with
11 what was referred to news in the Negro community, something
12 along those lines. So, that was my focus.
13
Q. Okay. Did any of the articles that you reviewed
14 but have not brought with you here today deal with the
15 subject that you were asked to research, which is the
16 general awareness of health consequences of smoking?
17
A. I have not reviewed those.
18
Q. You haven't even looked at them?
19
A. Well, I've seen them, but not read them, because
20 what I did was as I said, I made copies of those columns
21 that referred to the African-American community.
22
Q. Okay. All right. Let me go ahead -- is there
23 anything else on that document other than the names of the
24 newspapers that you have referenced?
25
A. On that page?
0065
1
Q. On any page.
2
A. There's another one which mentions the schools.
3
Q. Okay.
4
A. And, yeah, it mentions the schools.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]5
Q. The schools in the Pompano Beach area?
6
A. Correct.
7
Q. All right. It just tells you what are the
8 schools in Pompano?
9
A. The names of the schools, that's what it
10 provides, yes.
11
Q. Okay.
12
A. And the addresses as well.
13
Q. All right. And how is that relevant for your
14 work in this case?
15
A. It's relevant because the Ely Blanche High School
16 is mentioned there.
17
Q. Okay.
18
A. The next page has a breakdown of different
19 districts I would call them and it includes the names of
20 the people, the head of household that lived in that
21 particular district, if we may call it that.
22
Q. Yeah. Okay. And how is that relevant to your
23 work in this case?
24
A. Because Robert Thurston is mentioned here.
25
Q. Who is Robert Thurston?
0066
1
A. This is Juanita's father.
2
Q. All right. So, her father was a pillar of the
3 community so to speak?
4
A. I don't have any basis to characterize him as a
5 pillar of the community.
6
Q. Okay. All right. What else?
7
A. The next one includes the churches, the names of
8 churches and the addresses.
9
Q. Okay. And how is that relevant?
10
A. Because there's some churches mentioned here that
11 may be the one that Juanita attended.
12
Q. Okay. Does that complete the information
13 contained in Exhibit 12?
14
A. That's it.
15
Q. All right. Let's put a sticker on it. The
16 newspaper articles that you mentioned, that you copied, but
17 have not yet reviewed, have you provided those to Jones
18 Day?
19
A. Not yet.
20
Q. Do you plan to?
21
A. Yes. The ones that I feel are relevant.
22
Q. When did you obtain copies of the Pompano Beach
23 Directory which we've marked as Exhibit 12?
24
A. I believe that was last Thursday, yeah, Thursday
25 of last week.
0067
1
Q. Okay. All right. And so what other documents
2 have you brought with you in response to Item 1 of the
3 duces tecum?
4
A. I have a sheet entitled Rosenwald Schools.
5
Q. We'll mark that as Exhibit 13. And what is
6 Exhibit 13?
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]7
A. That is an item at the Broward County Historical
8 Commission.
9
Q. Does it pertain to black history in the Broward
10 County area?
11
A. Yes.
12
Q. Okay. And how was it relevant to your work in
13 this case?
14
A. It talks about the schools, the black schools in
15 that area.
16
Q. All right. Anything else in response to Item 1
17 of the duces tecum?
18
A. I have Odom case hours, I don't know if that's
19 for Item 1.
20
Q. If it's something that falls under some other
21 category, then we will --
22
A. Yeah.
23
Q. So, let's focus on Item 1 of the duces tecum, if
24 we need to reclassify or --
25
A. That includes notes. These are stapled and I
0068
1 would like to unstaple them.
2
Q. You can do whatever you want. They're your
3 documents.
4
A. I have notes that I took for this case, which
5 are, I would call them graphic --
6
Q. Okay.
7
A. The one on top, the first one, is a family tree
8 of the Thurston family, as far as I could decipher it.
9
Q. Okay. What else?
10
A. The next one is a timeline of Juanita Thurston's
11 life, which includes when she was born, when her children
12 were born, the time of death, the time of diagnosis, that
13 type of thing.
14
Q. Does it include the places where she lived?
15
A. It includes it in the first one, it says where
16 she was born in Pompano. And then, there's a statement
17 here that by 1957 she no longer lived in Pompano.
18
Q. Okay. Does it indicate where she attended
19 school?
20
A. It does not indicate that, no.
21
Q. Okay. Anything else on that particular set of
22 notes?
23
A. There's a list of libraries and depositories that
24 I identified as potentially useful for my research.
25
Q. All right.
0069
1
A. Some of which I visited, others that I have not.
2
Q. Okay.
3
A. And then these are my notes to the deposition of
4 Mildred Evans.
5
Q. Okay.
6
A. That's all that is in this set of documents.
7
Q. Thanks. We'll mark that as Exhibit 14 for
8 identification. And is this family tree a document that
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]9 you yourself created?
10
A. Yes.
11
Q. And is the timeline of Juanita's life a timeline
12 that you yourself created?
13
A. Yes.
14
Q. And in the list of libraries and depositories,
15 you said you visited some but not others, I see the Palm
16 Beach County Museum, that's one you visited, correct?
17
A. Correct.
18
Q. And you visited the Historical Commission of
19 Broward County, correct?
20
A. Correct.
21
Q. That's where you got the directory, right?
22
A. Yes.
23
Q. And what other libraries and depositories did you
24 actually visit in connection with this case?
25
A. African-American Research Library and Cultural
0070
1 Center.
2
Q. Where?
3
A. This is north of Fort Lauderdale, the address is
4 here.
5
Q. Okay.
6
A. Delray Beach Historical Society is mentioned here
7 but I did not visit it.
8
Q. Okay.
9
A. The Spady Museum at Delray is mentioned, I did
10 not visit that, nor did I visit the Pompano Beach
11 Historical Society. Now, the next item is a repeat so it
12 appears twice. And that's the African-American Research
13 Library and Cultural Center.
14
Q. Did you gather any materials from the
15 African-American Research Center?
16
A. The same as I did in others, that I identify what
17 I thought would be helpful. I have copies of those, which
18 I have not looked at.
19
Q. Okay.
20
A. And therefore, I don't know whether they would be
21 relevant.
22
Q. And those are again documents that you didn't
23 bring with you, they're at your office and you just haven't
24 gotten around to looking at them yet, correct?
25
A. That's correct.
0071
1
Q. Okay.
2
A. Let's see, then towards the bottom, Delray Beach
3 Historical Society, which is mentioned above, so this is a
4 repeat as well, and also repeat of the Spady Cultural
5 Heritage Museum.
6
Q. All right. Are there any documents that you
7 brought with you in response to Exhibit 1 of the duces
8 tecum?
9
A. Any other?
10
Q. Uh-huh.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]11
A. Yes. These are notes that pertain to this case.
12
Q. Okay. And what are they notes of?
13
A. Those are notes that I made to myself, with some
14 information which I believe the bulk of it if not all was
15 something that I found at the Palm Beach County Museum.
16
Q. The history museum?
17
A. Correct.
18
Q. Okay. And what is the relevance of the notes on
19 Exhibit 15 to this case?
20
A. There's information there about churches in
21 Delray and also in Palm Beach County and information about
22 schools. There's some information on Blanche Ely and the
23 Spady School.
24
Q. All right. Any other documents in response to
25 Item No. 1 of the duces tecum?
0072
1
A. Yes. Here I have another set of notes, that I
2 would actually attach this to the other, the previous
3 document, because they're basically the same thing.
4
Q. To 15?
5
A. Yes.
6
Q. What's on that second page of Exhibit 15?
7
A. Information about locations in Delray. It
8 mentions Atlantic Avenue, for example. There's
9 information, there's a note of the Spady Cultural Museum,
10 information of the location of Delray. Let's see. There's
11 information about the schools, and when the early schools
12 were built. That's what appears here.
13
Q. All right. So, we'll put a paper clip on that,
14 they're part of the same exhibit. What else did you bring
15 with you in response to Item 1 of the duces tecum?
16
A. I just saw, there's another document that goes
17 along with the other two.
18
Q. With 15?
19
A. And it includes the titles of newspapers that I
20 identified as potentially of use.
21
Q. Okay. And did you research any of this?
22
A. Pompano Town News, yes. Fort Lauderdale
23 Sentinel, I believe Fort Lauderdale Daily News, Fort
24 Lauderdale Sun Sentinel, and those are the ones that I have
25 looked at.
0073
1
Q. Okay. And have you made copies of articles from
2 the archives of these papers that you are going to rely
3 upon in order to give your opinions in this case?
4
A. I haven't made a determination whether I'm going
5 to rely on them, but that's potentially the case.
6
Q. And do you have the copies of the articles that
7 you researched from these particular newspapers with you
8 here today?
9
A. No.
10
Q. Okay.
11
A. I haven't examined them yet.
12
Q. Is the reason that you did not bring those
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]13 materials with you today that you have not examined them
14 yet?
15
A. That's correct. And I have not made a
16 determination as to whether I'm going to rely on them or
17 not.
18
Q. Okay. Did anyone tell you not to bring them with
19 you here today?
20
A. No.
21
Q. All right. While we're at it, are there any
22 other documents that you brought with you in response to
23 Item 1 of the duces tecum that you want to lump in with
24 Exhibit 15?
25
A. Yes. There's one here, it's loose leaf,
0074
1 Resolution on Cigarette Smoking, which I believe is part of
2 the notes for this case, but it got loose.
3
Q. Okay. Part of the notes to this case. Is the
4 notes to this case a document that we have already marked
5 as an exhibit?
6
A. Yes.
7
Q. What number exhibit does that document belong
8 with?
9
A. I'd have to look at them.
10
Q. Okay. They're right here in front of you.
11 You've got Exhibit 2, Notes from Odom Case, Exhibit 3, more
12 notes, and so on, so --
13
A. I believe that it's either the first one you
14 mentioned or the second.
15
Q. Okay. All right. Is there a reason why that
16 document that you're holding in your hand is not with those
17 that have already been marked?
18
A. It may be there.
19
Q. Oh, okay. All right. Well, let's go ahead and
20 put an exhibit sticker on it so we don't lose track of it.
21 Where did this document, which we will mark as Exhibit 16,
22 come from?
23
A. I found that in the Internet in one of the pages.
24 The email address is there, I think, the web address is
25 there.
0075
1
Q. The URL is there, is that what you meant to say?
2
A. That's what I meant to say.
3
Q. Okay. And what is the relevance of this document
4 to this case?
5
A. The relevance is to understand the position of
6 the Southern Baptist Convention on the issue of smoking.
7 And the relevance is that Juanita Thurston is described in
8 several of the depositions as a Baptist who attended
9 Baptist churches regularly.
10
Q. Is it your opinion in this case that Juanita was
11 aware of the contents of Exhibit No. 16?
12
A. Not of that particular document.
13
Q. Okay.
14
A. I can tell you why.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]15
Q. Why?
16
A. Because the Southern Baptist Convention is the
17 umbrella organization for many, I would say perhaps most of
18 the Baptist churches, but there are Baptist churches that
19 are not affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention.
20
Q. Have you established whether or not the Baptist
21 church that Juanita attended is associated with the
22 Southern Baptist Convention?
23
A. No. I have not determined that. I believe that
24 I looked at the list of churches under the Southern Baptist
25 Convention and it was not included. That's what I believe.
0076
1
Q. Okay. All right. So, is it your opinion that
2 Juanita was not aware of the position of the Southern
3 Baptist Convention as reflected in Exhibit 16?
4
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
5
A. I don't have a way of determining that. She may
6 have been familiar with that, or may not have been familiar
7 with that.
8
Q. Do you have an opinion one way or the other as to
9 whether or not Juanita was aware of the position of the
10 Southern Baptist Convention within a reasonable degree of
11 historical probability?
12
A. I cannot make that determination --
13
Q. Okay.
14
A. -- at this point.
15
Q. All right. And is the reason that you can't make
16 that determination because you just don't have enough
17 information in order to make that call?
18
A. Could you repeat the full question again?
19
Q. Yes.
20
(Question read back at Page 76, Lines 8 - 11).
21
MR. KEEHFUS: Objection to form.
22
A. I don't have an opinion.
23
Q. Okay. And why don't you have an opinion?
24
A. I don't have an opinion because this resolution
25 by the Southern Baptist Convention may not connect directly
0077
1 with the particular church that Juanita attended.
2
Q. Okay. Is that your full and complete answer?
3
A. Yes.
4
Q. Thank you. Are there any other documents that
5 you brought with you in response to Item 1 of the duces
6 tecum?
7
A. I have some photographs that I took.
8
Q. Okay.
9
A. Do you want them?
10
Q. Yeah. We'll mark them and then you can tell me
11 what they are. So we'll attach the photographs as Exhibit
12 17. Are these photographs you took or are they photocopies
13 of photographs that someone else took?
14
A. These are prints of photos that I took.
15
Q. Okay. And there's a photograph of the Ely
16 Educational Museum, correct?
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]17
A. Correct.
18
Q. And there's a photograph of the Broward County
19 Historical Commission?
20
A. Correct.
21
Q. And photograph of the Pompano Beach Historical
22 Society, correct?
23
A. Yes. Pompano -- no, the last --
24
Q. Pompano Beach Historical Society?
25
A. May I see them?
0078
1
Q. Yeah.
2
A. You want me to explain all of them?
3
Q. Yeah.
4
A. The first one is a photograph of the Ely
5 Educational Museum, the facade of that building. The
6 second one is a picture of the sign in front of that
7 museum. The next one is the facade of the Broward County
8 Historical Commission. And the next four items are
9 pictures that I took from an exhibit at the Broward County
10 Historical Commission.
11
Q. Okay. All right. Why did you take those
12 pictures?
13
A. Because they're pictures of the schools that
14 Juanita Thurston attended.
15
Q. Okay.
16
A. There's one last item here.
17
Q. Okay.
18
A. And that is just basically notes to myself,
19 places where I can find illustrations.
20
Q. Illustrations of what?
21
A. That may be of use to me in this case.
22
Q. What are those places?
23
A. Spady Museum web page, there's another one which
24 is African-American Registry.org, and then the last one is
25 Florida Memory.com.
0079
1
Q. Okay. By illustrations you mean other
2 photographs?
3
A. Visuals.
4
Q. Visuals, okay, for your presentation at trial?
5
A. They may be used in the presentation.
6
Q. Okay. And have you sourced any of those yet?
7
A. Sourced?
8
Q. Have you identified the ones that you're going to
9 use at the trial of this case?
10
A. I haven't made that determination.
11
Q. Okay. All right. What else did you bring with
12 you in response to Item 1 of the duces tecum?
13
A. I believe that's all for Item 1.
14
MR. GARCIA: Okay. All right. So with that
15
let's take a brief break.
16
(Recess taken).
17 BY MR. GARCIA:
18
Q. All right. So, when we broke for lunch we, I
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]19 think, just got done, finished discussing Item 1 to the
20 duces tecum, correct?
21
A. Yes.
22
Q. And during the break did you have any discussions
23 with counsel about your testimony here today?
24
A. No.
25
Q. All right. And I saw that you were flipping
0080
1 through additional documents while we were sitting here.
2 Are there any other documents as you sit here right now
3 that you believe are responsive to Item 1 of the duces
4 tecum?
5
A. No. What I was flipping through is something you
6 already have.
7
Q. Okay. All right.
8
A. So the answer is no.
9
Q. Okay. Thanks. So, what I've done is I have
10 marked an electronic copy of the Reliance List as Exhibit
11 18 for identification. And what you have in front of you
12 is the printout copy that your lawyer brought with him.
13 And I just have a couple of questions about that --
14
A. Sure.
15
Q. -- okay? And have you seen Exhibit 18 before?
16
A. Is this the list of materials?
17
Q. The Reliance, what we call the Reliance List,
18 yes, sir.
19
A. Yes, I have seen it.
20
Q. Okay. And so, that list contains thousands of
21 items that you might potentially rely upon in providing
22 your opinions in this case, is that correct?
23
A. Correct.
24
Q. Okay. And I think you told us earlier you didn't
25 create that list per se, but you are the one who sourced
0081
1 the materials that were utilized in order to create it,
2 correct?
3
A. Correct.
4
Q. All right. And that is the case for every single
5 item that's on that list, correct?
6
A. I can't affirm that it's true for every single
7 item.
8
Q. Okay. And why is that?
9
A. Because I've seen it and I've gone through it but
10 I haven't done an item by item type of check.
11
Q. Okay. Well, then, how do we know that that is an
12 accurate list of everything that you have provided to the
13 lawyers as part of your research?
14
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to form.
15
A. For this case?
16
Q. Yes, sir.
17
A. I would describe it as an accurate list.
18
Q. Okay. I mean, you reviewed the list, right?
19
A. I reviewed the list, and I've reviewed the items
20 on it.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]21
Q. Okay. Every single one of the items?
22
A. I would say that it's likely that a few may have
23 escaped my attention, but I am familiar with all of the
24 items which I have looked at for previous cases.
25
Q. Are there items on that Reliance List, sir, that
0082
1 you have not looked at?
2
A. It's unlikely, but it's possible.
3
Q. Okay. Well, can you tell us with certainty that
4 you are familiar with every single item that's on that
5 Reliance List, Exhibit 18?
6
A. Familiarity as having examined them, yes.
7
Q. Meaning -- strike that. My understanding is that
8 Exhibit 18 is comprised of documents that you provided to
9 counsel in order to assemble the list, did I understand you
10 correctly?
11
A. There're items that I provided, that would be the
12 bulk. There were also items that I identified which I may
13 have not provided physically to the lawyers.
14
Q. Okay. What do you mean that there are items that
15 you have identified which you did not provide physically to
16 the lawyers?
17
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
18
A. I'm talking about materials from certain
19 magazines, for example, magazine articles, that I have in
20 my possession but I don't recall having provided them with
21 a physical copy of those.
22
Q. Okay. And yet you believe that those magazine
23 articles are reflected on that list, on that Reliance List?
24
A. Probably not all of them.
25
Q. Okay. Are there items on that Reliance List that
0083
1 you did not personally source and provide to the lawyers in
2 order to incorporate into that Reliance List?
3
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
4
A. Can you repeat the question, please?
5
Q. Sure. Are there items on Exhibit 18 that you did
6 not source yourself but that were somehow incorporated into
7 that list?
8
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
9
A. I would like to know what do you mean by source?
10
Q. Okay. I'm using source in the historical sense
11 meaning you did the research in order to locate the
12 document, identify it, become familiar with it, it's a
13 document that you provided to the lawyers, it is a, for
14 lack of a better word, a reliance document that's going to
15 be used in this case. Does that help you understand my
16 definition of source?
17
A. Yes.
18
Q. Is it consistent with your definition of source?
19
A. Well, I think you used it as a verb.
20
Q. I think you're right. I think you're right,
21 might even be an adverb, I don't know. But be that as it
22 may, what I'd like to know is if there are documents on
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]23 Exhibit 18 that you did not source?
24
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
25
Q. Verb. I think that was a grammatical objection.
0084
1
A. I think that's the case, yes.
2
Q. And as you sit here right now, can you tell me
3 which ones they are?
4
A. I don't have that as a category in my brain. If
5 I were to look at them item by item, perhaps I could do
6 that, or I could speak more broadly.
7
Q. I don't think there's enough time in the rest of
8 our lives to look at all of those items, but I just wonder
9 if you could perhaps narrow it down for me. Are we talking
10 about ten items, 50, a hundred or perhaps a thousand that
11 fall under that category?
12
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form. What category
13
are we talking about?
14
MR. GARCIA: Those categories of items that he
15
did not source.
16
A. I can't put a number on it. It may be, and this
17 is a guess, I don't know if you want that type of answer,
18 in the vicinity of a thousand.
19
Q. All right. And we won't hold you to that number,
20 but I appreciate your effort. Can you tell me with any
21 certainty where you believe those thousand or so documents
22 came from?
23
A. Those are documents that I have received over the
24 years from the lawyers.
25
Q. Okay. Have you received documents that fall
0085
1 under that category from any other source than the lawyers?
2
A. Yes.
3
Q. And when we're talking about the lawyers, we're
4 talking about the folks at Jones Day, correct?
5
A. Correct.
6
Q. All right. Well, what other sources have you
7 received documents that you did not yourself source?
8
A. I have received documents from colleagues who
9 have done similar work and I have approached them about
10 those documents and requested them. And I should also add
11 that some of them I have requested to a company, which is
12 History Works in Chicago.
13
Q. Would you agree with me that if you did not,
14 yourself, source a particular document then it would be
15 prudent for you as a historian to look at it and confirm
16 its authenticity?
17
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
18
A. Yes.
19
Q. Okay. I mean, if it were going to be a document
20 that you would incorporate in a scholarly writing you would
21 be expected to do that, wouldn't you?
22
A. Correct.
23
Q. Right. And you would have to vouch for the
24 source of that document, wouldn't you?
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]25
A. Yes.
0086
1
Q. Okay. Can you vouch for the source of the
2 thousand or so documents that are on that Reliance List
3 that you did not yourself source?
4
A. Yes, I can vouch for them.
5
Q. Okay. And how is it that you can vouch for them
6 if you haven't yourself been the one who sourced the
7 material?
8
A. Well, every time that I requested a document or a
9 set of documents from a colleague, I make sure that I had a
10 conversation with them about the process that they used to
11 acquire those documents and select them. So that's one
12 way.
13
Q. Okay. Well, I can appreciate that documents you
14 sourced from your colleagues would receive the Good
15 Housekeeping Seal of Approval. Can the same be said for
16 those documents that you did not source from colleagues and
17 which came to you from the lawyers at Jones Day?
18
A. Yes, I can because of the nature of those
19 documents.
20
Q. What is the nature of those documents?
21
A. The vast majority would be articles, copies of
22 articles of newspapers, magazines, that would be the bulk
23 of them.
24
Q. All right. And with regard to those newspaper
25 and magazine articles that were provided to you by the
0087
1 lawyers at Jones Day, are those documents that you
2 requested as part of your work?
3
A. Yes.
4
Q. Okay. What did you request from the lawyers at
5 Jones Day that they provided you with?
6
A. Well, I requested, for example, collections of
7 magazine articles from magazines that I have not worked
8 with directly, the same thing with newspaper articles that
9 I received. And not only did I accept them, but I analyzed
10 the validity of the selection itself.
11
Q. What does that mean?
12
A. That means that, first of all, I would have a
13 conversation with the lawyers at Jones Day on these
14 materials, what are they, and in some cases these were
15 materials that were put together as a set by historians.
16 And the main point really is that if I receive materials
17 from the lawyers, which I have, even though I trust them
18 based on the conversations that we had and the working
19 relationship that we have had, certainly they will not
20 misrepresent them, but just to make sure that I'm able to
21 also say that I vouch for them personally. In many
22 instances when I receive a set of newspapers, say, Miami
23 Herald, which I received from a colleague, I make an effort
24 to see whether those are representative and sometimes I
25 look at the collection again or have an assistant look at
0088
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]1 the collection again.
2
Q. When you say representative, you mean
3 representative of what?
4
A. Representative of the stories that appeared in
5 those newspapers or magazines on the general subject of
6 tobacco and health.
7
Q. Okay. All right. So, as you sit here you've got
8 the printout copy of Exhibit 18, do you vouch for every
9 single item that's on that Reliance List?
10
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
11
A. As I said, I can vouch for the vast majority. In
12 order for me to give you an answer, what you're requesting
13 about every single item, I would have to look and cross
14 check.
15
Q. Okay. As you sit here you don't feel comfortable
16 doing that unless you literally look at every single item
17 on that list, correct?
18
A. I think your question demands that type of
19 thorough --
20
Q. Analysis?
21
A. -- analysis.
22
Q. Right. Well, to the extent that this document,
23 Exhibit 18, is entitled a Reliance List, would it be
24 reasonable for me as the recipient to rely on the accuracy
25 of that document?
0089
1
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
2
A. It is reliable, that's the nature of the
3 document. And it reflects what I've described in terms of
4 the gathering of the materials. Whether you consider it
5 reliable for your own purposes, I don't know.
6
Q. Well, I just want to know if it's reasonable for
7 me to rely upon it as the list that you are relying upon,
8 the list of documents that you're relying upon in order to
9 provide your opinions in this case?
10
A. The answer is yes. But remember that I provided
11 some other sources that are not included here.
12
Q. Oh, yeah. I completely understand that. But I
13 want to focus on that document because again we're talking
14 about literally thousands of items on that document. And I
15 just want to know as we sit here today in the context of
16 this discovery deposition, which is the only time that I
17 get to talk to you, whether you have any reservation
18 whatsoever regarding the reliability of every single item
19 on Exhibit 18?
20
MR. KEEHFUS: I'm sorry, before you answer can
21
you read that back?
22
MR. GARCIA: That was the luxury model of that
23
question, I can do a sport model if you want.
24
(Question read back at Page 89, Lines 12 - 19).
25
MR. KEEHFUS: Objection to the form, go ahead.
0090
1
A. They are reliable.
2
Q. And you can say that without any reservation
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]3 whatsoever, correct?
4
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
5
A. It depends on the definition of reliable, really,
6 but I'm trying to give you the best answer that I can. The
7 items are reliable. I have copies of those materials. I
8 have examined, I don't want to say a hundred percent of
9 them, but I have examined most of them, the vast majority.
10 In that sense, this is reliable.
11
Q. Okay. All right. If you would turn to the last
12 page of that document, just bear with me one second here
13 while I pull up my copy. I'm looking at Page 180, which I
14 believe is the last page. Are you with me?
15
A. Yes.
16
Q. So, if I understand how this Reliance List works,
17 as we're looking at Page 180, the number of the document
18 appears on the left column, correct?
19
A. Correct.
20
Q. And then, if there's a date associated with that
21 document then it would appear on the next column, correct?
22
A. Correct.
23
Q. And then, under the caption Summary, we have the
24 title of the document or category of documents, correct?
25
A. Correct.
0091
1
Q. And then, the last column is the image number,
2 correct?
3
A. Correct.
4
Q. So, if I go to one of the three disks that were
5 provided to me in conjunction with the Reliance List I
6 should be able to source the document by referring to the
7 unique and distinct image number and then pull up that
8 document?
9
A. That's my understanding, yes.
10
Q. Have you ever tested it to see if it works?
11
A. I don't have any reason to say that they're not
12 reflective and they're not one and the same.
13
Q. Have you ever tested it?
14
A. Not a formal test.
15
Q. Okay. All right. Do you see Item No. 5413 on
16 Page 180?
17
A. I see that item.
18
Q. And what is the title of that item?
19
A. Various case specific materials including
20 pleadings, depositions, military, and educational records.
21
Q. And what is the distinct image number assigned to
22 that item?
23
A. ANS-000010.
24
Q. Okay. And have you reviewed that particular
25 item?
0092
1
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
2
Q. Various case specific materials including
3 pleadings, depositions, military and educational records?
4
A. Yes.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]5
Q. Okay. And by case specific materials, does that
6 mean to say materials specific to the Odom case, Juanita
7 Thurston?
8
A. Yes.
9
Q. All right. Let me see if I can find that item on
10 the disks. All right. I think I found it. So, let me
11 show you what I find when I went to the disk. It's a
12 document entitled Various Case Specific Materials Including
13 Pleadings and Depositions, do you agree with me?
14
A. That's what it says there, yes.
15
Q. And it looks like the document consists of one
16 page. And do you see the code there at the bottom of that
17 page, ANS-000010?
18
A. Yes.
19
Q. Okay. Do you know if there is any more to this
20 document than this one page with the title Various Case
21 Specific Materials Including Pleadings and Depositions?
22
A. There are materials that fall into that category,
23 yes.
24
Q. I agree with you, that there are. But do you
25 know why, when I pulled it up on the disk, all I see is
0093
1 just this one page?
2
A. I don't know.
3
Q. Okay. If you were using this system yourself,
4 this index and the disks, would you have expected to see
5 those materials which comprise the various case specific
6 materials including pleadings and depositions?
7
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to form.
8
A. I can't speak to the reason for using that way of
9 representing those documents. What I can tell you is that
10 those documents I brought with me.
11
Q. Okay. I appreciate that, but I need an answer to
12 my question, which is, would you have expected to see the
13 documents that you brought with you already in the disk
14 that was provided to me as part of the reliance materials?
15
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to form.
16
A. That's a heading for a category. I did not come
17 up with that. Now, generally, if there is a heading, one
18 would expect materials that reflect that definition
19 included there.
20
Q. It would be reasonable to expect that, correct?
21
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
22
A. Well, not being familiar with -- this is a legal
23 document.
24
Q. What is a legal document?
25
A. The Reliance List.
0094
1
Q. Exhibit 18?
2
A. If that's the number.
3
Q. Yeah, that's the number, it's written on there.
4
A. So it's a legal document.
5
Q. Right.
6
A. I did not format it or put it together as it is.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]7
Q. Right.
8
A. So, I don't know whether for legal purposes the
9 title is enough. I can't give you an answer to that.
10
Q. Okay.
11
A. If it was a bibliography with a heading, I would
12 expect to see items. But, again, this is a legal document,
13 and I don't have any way of judging the validity of a legal
14 document.
15
Q. Okay. To the extent that it's a legal document,
16 would you expect it to be accurate from a historian's
17 perspective?
18
A. Yes.
19
Q. And to the extent that the only item that is
20 included under the index, Exhibit 18, under the category of
21 Various Case Specific Materials Including Pleadings and
22 Depositions, a one page document which is basically the
23 title reflected in Exhibit 18, would you have some
24 reservations about the reliability of that list?
25
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
0095
1
A. I don't. And the reason is that that is a
2 descriptive category. And you requested the materials.
3 Now, almost all of them are in digital format. The ones
4 that you're referring to under that category, I have them
5 with me here.
6
Q. I understand that. But I'm asking you with
7 respect to the reliance materials that I received in
8 advance of the deposition, would you have expected the
9 materials that you brought with you here today to have
10 already been included as part of the reliance materials?
11
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
12
A. It's a legal document and I can't judge a legal
13 document.
14
Q. Okay. All right. Would that category that we
15 were just discussing, the various case specific materials,
16 fall under the category of items that you would not have
17 sourced and provided to the lawyers for the purpose of
18 preparing that list?
19
A. Correct.
20
Q. Okay. All right. Let's look at Item 2 of your
21 Subpoena Duces Tecum, please. Tell me if you would what
22 documents you brought in response to that?
23
A. In response to No. 2?
24
Q. Yes, sir.
25
A. I provided you with a set of photographs.
0096
1
Q. Would those be the ones that we identified as
2 Exhibit 17, sir?
3
A. That's correct.
4
Q. Okay. Anything else in response to No. 2?
5
A. No.
6
Q. Okay. How about No. 3?
7
A. I have provided those.
8
Q. Copies of all statements, written or recorded,
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]9 which you have examined in connection with this case. And
10 have we identified those as an exhibit?
11
A. I believe that some of them fall under the
12 category of notes which I have already provided you.
13
Q. Okay. And by notes, we're referring to things
14 like Exhibit 2, 3, 4, and 10?
15
A. Yes.
16
Q. Okay. How about No. 4?
17
A. All published professional standards or
18 guidelines used or referred to by you in formulating your
19 opinion.
20
MR. KEEHFUS: Let me interject before we get to
21
4. In response to No. 3, Dr. Martinez-Fernandez has
22
brought with him the depositions that he has received
23
that were taken in this case.
24
MR. GARCIA: Okay. As far as statements are
25
concerned?
0097
1
MR. KEEHFUS: Exactly.
2 BY MR. GARCIA:
3
Q. Let's go ahead and just identify for the record
4 the depositions that you reviewed, please. What I'd like
5 you to do is tell us who the witness is and the date of the
6 deposition, if you don't mind.
7
MR. KEEHFUS: Of the ones that he reviewed, is
8
that right?
9
MR. GARCIA: Correct.
10 BY MR. GARCIA:
11
Q. I assume you reviewed all of them?
12
A. I reviewed almost all of them, with the exception
13 of four that I received very, very recently.
14
Q. Okay. Well, then, while we're at it, let's
15 identify those as well. So, let's start with the
16 depositions that you received and reviewed by name of
17 witness, and date of deposition, and then the ones that you
18 received but have not yet reviewed.
19
A. Okay. Gwendolyn Odom, September 7, 2011, and
20 that's Volume 4. Gwendolyn Odom, November 11, 2011, Volume
21 5. Gwendolyn Odom, September 7, 2011, Volume 3. Moranda
22 Thurston, December 2nd, 2011, Volume 2. Bobby Thurston
23 Newsome, February 16, 2012. This is a draft deposition of
24 Thaddeus Hayes, July 30th, 2012. Bobby Thurston Newsome, I
25 may have mentioned this one before, February 16, 2012.
0098
1
Q. Okay.
2
A. Gwendolyn Odom, August 31st, 2011, Volume 1.
3 Gwendolyn Odom, August 31st, 2011, Volume 2. Moranda
4 Thurston, December the 2nd, 2011, Volume 1. Randy Odom,
5 March 16th, 2012. Mildred Evans, March 5th, 2012.
6
Q. Okay. And how about the ones you received but
7 have not reviewed?
8
A. Angeline Marshall, August 9th, 2012. Charles
9 Alvin Osborne, August the 7th, 2012. Oscar Harden, date is
10 August the 3rd, 2012. Willie Harden, August the 9th, 2012.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]11 Duriel Odom, March 13th, 2012. Ahmad Hayes, March the 2nd,
12 2012. And although I reviewed the draft deposition, I have
13 not reviewed the actual draft for Thaddeus Hayes, July
14 30th, 2012.
15
Q. Okay. Does that cover all the depositions
16 reviewed or not reviewed?
17
A. Yes.
18
Q. Okay. And does that exhaust then the list of
19 documents that comprise statements in response to Item 3 of
20 the duces tecum?
21
A. Item 3?
22
Q. Yes, which was copies of all statements, written
23 or recorded, which you examined in connection with this
24 case?
25
A. I have a handful of other documents that I
0099
1 believe fall into the same category.
2
Q. Let's identify them, please.
3
A. Plaintiff's Notice of Serving Better Answer to
4 Defendant, Lorillard Tobacco Company's Interrogatory No. 7.
5 The date is February 28, 2008.
6
Q. Okay.
7
A. Plaintiff, Gwendolyn E. Odom, Personal
8 Representative of the Estate of Juanita Thurston, Notice of
9 Serving Answers to Defendant, Lorillard Tobacco Company's
10 First Set of Interrogatories, propounded February 27, 2008.
11
Juanita Thurston, Blanche Ely High School,
12 Records Retention Office, there's an address.
13
Q. Okay. Let's take a look at that. Is this a copy
14 that we can mark for identification in this deposition?
15 Hearing no objection, I'll mark it as No. 19.
16
Okay. Anything else, doctor?
17
A. Plaintiff, Gwendolyn Odom's, Personal
18 Representative of the Estate of Juanita Thurston, Notice of
19 Serving Amended Answers to Defendant, Lorillard Tobacco
20 Company's First Set of Interrogatories propounded February
21 27, 2008.
22
Q. Okay. Anything else?
23
A. Yes. Plaintiff's Notice of Serving Answers to
24 Defendant, Lorillard Tobacco Company's Second Set of
25 Interrogatories, and there's a date which is July 14th,
0100
1 2011. There's another date as well.
2
Q. Okay. All right.
3
A. Amended Severed Complaint, date -- I don't see a
4 date on the first page.
5
Q. All right.
6
A. That's it.
7
Q. Okay. How about Item No. 4 on the duces tecum,
8 which is all published professional standards or guidelines
9 used or referred to by you in formulating your opinion in
10 connection with this case?
11
A. No, I don't have that.
12
Q. Okay. How about No. 5, professional literature,
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]13 treatises or textbooks or other publications which you
14 regard as authoritative in connection with this case?
15
A. This is a very broad request as I read it, so I
16 did not bring all of the professional literature.
17
Q. All right. Is there any unique and distinct
18 piece of literature, treatise or textbook that you expect
19 to discuss or introduce as evidence in the trial of this
20 case?
21
A. Yes.
22
Q. Okay. And what is it?
23
A. Those would be included on the disks.
24
Q. On the disks meaning the items on the 180 page
25 Reliance List?
0101
1
A. Correct.
2
Q. Okay. All right.
3
A. So the answer is yes, I brought them in disk
4 form.
5
Q. How about No. 6?
6
A. Copies of all published articles, written by or
7 contributed to by you within the past three years, or
8 drafts of speeches given by you within the past three
9 years, which affect your opinion in this case. I don't
10 have any item that fits that description.
11
Q. Okay. And is that because you haven't published
12 any articles or contributed to any articles or given
13 speeches about the subject of --
14
MR. KEEHFUS: Public awareness.
15
Q. -- the general awareness of health consequences
16 of smoking?
17
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
18
A. I have neither published nor given speeches on
19 that subject within the past three years.
20
Q. Have you done it ever?
21
A. I have not done it.
22
Q. Let's go to No. 7.
23
A. Copies of any published articles written by
24 others on which you have relied that affect your opinion in
25 this case. I don't have materials that fall into that
0102
1 description.
2
Q. Okay. None whatsoever?
3
A. None.
4
Q. No. 8, copies of any transcripts of testimony if
5 available given in other cases in which you have testified
6 either in deposition or trial in the past two years?
7
A. I don't have that.
8
Q. You don't have it in your possession, custody or
9 control?
10
A. I have those at home.
11
Q. Okay. So you have the ability to get them?
12
A. Yes, I do.
13
Q. All right. And did you review this list before
14 coming here today?
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]15
A. Yes, I did.
16
Q. Is there a reason why you didn't bring those
17 transcripts with you?
18
MR. KEEHFUS: Let me just interject at this
19
point. We filed objections to these. This is one
20
that we have objected to on the basis of the fact that
21
these transcripts are obtained through court reporting
22
services which may or may not limit the distribution
23
of those transcripts because of copyright protection.
24
MR. GARCIA: Okay. You want me to rule on that?
25
MR. KEEHFUS: No, I just wanted to make the
0103
1
record.
2
MR. GARCIA: I understand.
3 BY MR. GARCIA:
4
Q. Were you told not to bring those transcripts with
5 you today?
6
A. I wasn't told not to bring them, I was told which
7 items here are of relevance that I should bring.
8
Q. I understand. My question, sir, is were you told
9 not to bring transcripts of your testimony which you have
10 at your house which you gave in the last two years?
11
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
12
A. I wasn't told not to. I responded to the list.
13
Q. I understand, but you didn't bring those
14 particular items with you?
15
A. I did not bring them.
16
Q. All right. No. 9.
17
A. Copies of any reports prepared by you and
18 furnished to the defendant or his attorney. For this case,
19 I guess the only item that would fall in that category is
20 my disclosure.
21
Q. You mean the disclosure that we referred to
22 earlier, your witness disclosure?
23
A. That's correct.
24
Q. I believe it was Exhibit No. 9 for
25 identification, is that what you're referring to, the one
0104
1 that was the subject of the May email?
2
A. Yes.
3
Q. Okay. All right. No. 10, any drawings, graphs,
4 charts, illustrations or plans, I take it that the family
5 tree and the life graph fall under that category?
6
A. The timeline, yes.
7
Q. The timeline. Anything else, that we haven't
8 already discussed?
9
A. No.
10
Q. Okay. And then how about No. 11?
11
A. Copies of any and all notes, calculations or
12 other data prepared by you in formulating your opinion in
13 connection with this case. I have provided you with all
14 the notes.
15
Q. Okay. Did you have to do any calculations?
16
A. Calculations?
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]17
Q. Yeah.
18
A. The only calculation I did was to come up with,
19 using my calculator, hours for this case.
20
Q. For the amount of time you have invested in this
21 case?
22
A. Correct.
23
Q. Okay. And we'll get to that in a second. And
24 any other data prepared by you in formulating your opinion
25 other than what we have discussed and identified as an
0105
1 exhibit so far?
2
A. Formulating my opinion, no.
3
Q. Okay. How about No. 12?
4
A. Any professional publications, treatises,
5 textbooks or other publications which you have examined in
6 formulating your opinion in connection with this case.
7
Q. Anything in response to that?
8
A. I don't have those.
9
MR. KEEHFUS: Other than what's in the Reliance
10
List?
11
MR. GARCIA: Well, I don't know, he's the
12
witness.
13
A. Yeah. Well, they are for the most part included
14 there.
15
Q. Okay.
16
A. So, I think that reflects what I reasonably
17 expect to rely on.
18
Q. Okay. All right. No. 13.
19
A. Office records indicating time spent on your
20 undertaking and hourly charges therefore in connection with
21 this case. Yes. I have two items.
22
Q. Let's go ahead and identify it. And this next
23 item will be No. 20. And No. 20 is a document dated with a
24 date of July 10, 2012, addressed to Jones Day regarding
25 consulting services, June 25 - July 10, 2012. Has there
0106
1 been any portion of this document that's been redacted or
2 erased?
3
MR. KEEHFUS: Let me interject here, yes. This
4
bill reflected work for multiple cases. And it's been
5
redacted to reflect the total amount Dr. Martinez
6
billed on that date for his historical research in the
7
Gwendolyn Odom case.
8 BY MR. GARCIA:
9
Q. Okay. So, did you redact it or did the lawyers
10 redact it for you?
11
A. I did not redact it, it was the lawyers.
12
Q. So, how can I tell by looking at this how much
13 time you billed for this particular case, if you would help
14 me with that, please.
15
A. Not by looking at this document, you can't.
16
Q. Okay. So, how much time did you bill for that
17 time period identified on Exhibit 20?
18
A. I don't see that amount.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]19
Q. There's some numbers handwritten on the bottom,
20 is that your handwriting?
21
A. No.
22
Q. Okay. Are there any documents that you have here
23 with you that you can refer to that would help me get an
24 answer to the question?
25
A. About the hours devoted to the Odom case?
0107
1
Q. Yes, sir.
2
A. Yes, sir. I have that document.
3
Q. Okay. So, Exhibit 20 is of no use to you in
4 determining how much time you have for that time period
5 that's identified, correct?
6
A. Correct.
7
Q. And that's because most of it's been erased or --
8
A. I don't know if most.
9
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
10
Q. So, you have with you, though, a document that
11 will help you, right?
12
A. Yes.
13
Q. Okay. Let's identify that as Exhibit 21. Tell
14 me what that is.
15
A. It's the Odom case hours.
16
Q. Okay. And how is that document organized? It's
17 got a date and then a corresponding number of hours for
18 work on that day?
19
A. Yes. It also has the name of the case.
20
Q. Okay.
21
A. And it has the work hours, as well as travel
22 hours.
23
Q. Okay. And how can I tell whether the hours
24 reflected on a particular day are for travel as opposed to
25 research?
0108
1
A. Because on the first column I include only work
2 hours. The second column includes only travel hours.
3
Q. I see. And so, if we use August 11 as an
4 example, am I reading it correctly then that two hours and
5 30 minutes would be for work that you did on the case?
6
A. Correct.
7
Q. And then two hours and 45 minutes would be for
8 travel?
9
A. Correct.
10
Q. All right. And so, what we've got here at the
11 bottom is you have added up all of the hours and the total
12 is 119 hours for work, am I reading that correctly?
13
A. That's a calculation that I made, yes.
14
Q. Okay. And then on the next column, 10 hours and
15 42 minutes of travel, am I reading that correctly?
16
A. Correct.
17
Q. How is it that you get 42 minutes, all I see are
18 zeros and 5s on that first column.
19
A. Okay. Let's see. That's a typo.
20
Q. Okay. All right. That's the answer I always get
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]21 when someone adds things up wrong. I'm being facetious.
22 All right. So, it should be whatever the numbers add up
23 to, right?
24
A. Yes. And I should say that this is not an
25 official calculation for billing purposes, this is just a
0109
1 calculation --
2
Q. You better hope not.
3
A. -- for this document.
4
Q. All right. Any way, if we add up the hours we
5 should get an accurate -- if we add them up correctly we
6 should get an accurate total?
7
A. Yes.
8
Q. Okay. Is this something that you just put
9 together for purposes of this deposition?
10
A. Yes.
11
Q. And what is your hourly rate currently?
12
A. It's $225.
13
Q. And how long or for what period of time has that
14 been your hourly rate?
15
A. That changed, I don't have the exact date, but
16 maybe 2006, or the year before or after, that the rate
17 changed.
18
Q. So, and is that hourly rate the same regardless
19 of whether you're doing actual work or travel?
20
A. No, it's not the same.
21
Q. Tell me how it is different?
22
A. The travel rate is $75, which is a third of the
23 work rate.
24
Q. Okay. So, $75 per hour to travel, 225 for work?
25
A. Correct.
0110
1
Q. All right. And now, do you have other categories
2 of billing for your work on a case?
3
A. The categories are hours worked and hours
4 traveled, and I guess you would call it reimbursement for
5 expenses.
6
Q. Okay. Things like what, like mileage?
7
A. Mileage.
8
Q. Food?
9
A. Hotel, meals.
10
Q. Okay. And have you submitted a bill for the work
11 that you have done in this case up to this point?
12
A. I've submitted a partial bill which is the one
13 dated July 10.
14
Q. Which is the one that's redacted?
15
A. Yes.
16
Q. And did that include reimbursables such as hotel
17 and lodging and that sort of thing?
18
A. That does not include that.
19
Q. Okay. Do you bill for your time when you're
20 giving testimony be it a deposition or a trial?
21
A. Yes, I do.
22
Q. And how do you bill for that?
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]23
A. It's the same amount per hour.
24
Q. 225 an hour?
25
A. 225 an hour.
0111
1
Q. And do you require a minimum?
2
A. No, I don't.
3
Q. Okay. So, if we were to take, coming down to
4 West Palm Beach for the trial of this case, would you bill
5 75 bucks an hour for your travel time from your home to
6 West Palm Beach?
7
A. Correct.
8
Q. And then you would bill $225 per hour for the
9 time that you wait in the courthouse and then testify in
10 the courthouse?
11
A. That's correct.
12
Q. Okay. Until you get back in your car or plane or
13 whatever, and come back home?
14
A. Yes.
15
Q. And that would be billed at 75 bucks an hour?
16
A. Yes.
17
Q. Okay. All right. So, other than Exhibit 21,
18 have you brought with you anything that captures all of
19 your reimbursables for your work on this case?
20
A. I haven't billed those because if you see the
21 document, the actual travel, with the exception of July the
22 10th, the actual travel with the expenses began August the
23 7th.
24
Q. I see. Well, on July 10th, where did you travel
25 to?
0112
1
A. I traveled here, to this building.
2
Q. Okay. To meet with lawyers?
3
A. Yes.
4
Q. Okay. And why did you meet with them at that
5 time?
6
A. They asked me to come here and meet with them.
7
Q. For what purpose?
8
A. It was about this case.
9
Q. All right. What did you discuss?
10
A. Just general things about the case. I discussed
11 what I intended to do between then and the deposition date.
12 I discussed my research agenda. Basically that's what we
13 talked about.
14
Q. Okay. In looking at Exhibit 21, then, would June
15 30th have been the first day that you began your work in
16 earnest on this case?
17
A. That's correct.
18
Q. All right. And then, looking at the entry for
19 August 14th, you've got five hours of work and one hour of
20 travel, correct?
21
A. That's yesterday. And this reflects -- this does
22 not reflect the hours that I spent in the evening on this
23 case.
24
Q. Okay.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]25
A. Because when I printed this document, I didn't
0113
1 have that information.
2
Q. Where did you travel to when you say here that
3 you had an hour's worth of travel?
4
A. I traveled to this building.
5
Q. Okay. To this very office that we're sitting
6 here today?
7
A. Not this very office.
8
Q. Okay. An office on this floor?
9
A. Yes.
10
Q. All right. And why did you come here?
11
A. I came here because I was sent a document that I
12 had to appear for the deposition, and to bring materials,
13 which is a document, Notice of Taking --
14
MR. KEEHFUS: He's asking about yesterday.
15
A. Oh, about yesterday. Yesterday we came and I
16 showed the materials to the lawyers and told them what
17 materials I intended to bring today, that were not here
18 yesterday. And we talked about the deposition that would
19 happen today. That was basically it.
20
Q. Did you go over the list that we've been
21 discussing, the duces tecum list?
22
A. Yes, we went over this list.
23
Q. And did the subject of your prior trial or
24 deposition testimony come up then?
25
A. Prior trial --
0114
1
Q. Yeah.
2
A. Not that I recall as a topic, no.
3
Q. All right. And so, the five hours of work that
4 you billed on August 14th, you're saying does not include
5 work that you did in the evening?
6
A. Correct.
7
Q. Would that have been after you left the meeting
8 here?
9
A. Yes.
10
Q. Okay. So, is the five hours reflected on Exhibit
11 21 five hours that you spent meeting with the lawyers
12 yesterday?
13
A. Correct.
14
Q. Okay. And so, did you then leave here and go
15 home?
16
A. Yes.
17
Q. Okay. And what additional work did you do when
18 you got home?
19
A. Well, I did things like updating this. I updated
20 my curriculum vitae, that type of work.
21
Q. Okay.
22
A. Printing those materials. And I also read my
23 notes.
24
Q. So, how much more time did you spend working on
25 the case when you went back home?
0115
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]1
A. I could give you an estimate, which I would
2 really have to have my records, which I don't have with me.
3 But if I were to give you a ballpark figure, it would be
4 four hours.
5
Q. Okay. What records do you need to refer to that
6 you don't have here in order to tell me how many more hours
7 you spent?
8
A. Most, you know, I make a note about when I start
9 on a pad and when I finish, so I make those notations and I
10 don't have that with me.
11
Q. So, the only records that we have here today
12 indicating the amount of time that you spent on this case
13 in response to Item 13 of the subpoena is Exhibit 20, which
14 doesn't really tell you much, right?
15
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
16
Q. About your time.
17
A. Well, no. That document does not differentiate
18 between hours for one case or another.
19
Q. Right.
20
A. The bill doesn't.
21
Q. And then Exhibit 21, which is the total of the
22 work and travel hours to date, correct?
23
A. With the exception of late last night.
24
Q. Right. How about Item No. 14 of the duces tecum,
25 are there any reports by other experts which you have read?
0116
1
A. No.
2
Q. Okay. How about No. 15, any published, it says
3 monograms, it should probably say monographs, treatises,
4 manuals, textbooks or other documents, used as a reference
5 by you in connection with this case?
6
A. Yes, those are on the disk.
7
Q. On the disk meaning the disks that work in
8 conjunction with the Reliance List?
9
A. Yes. And there's --
10
Q. And the other documents you brought with you?
11
A. Correct.
12
Q. All right. How about No. 16?
13
A. No. 16, the correspondence has been exclusively
14 via email and I brought copies of all the emails.
15
Q. And those would be the emails that we have
16 already identified as an exhibit in this case, right?
17
A. Yes.
18
Q. Okay. And how about No. 18?
19
A. No. I don't have any document that fits that
20 description.
21
Q. All right. No. 19, seems like a catchall.
22 Anything that we haven't already looked at that falls under
23 that category?
24
A. Whatever I had, I already turned in today.
25
Q. How about No. 20?
0117
1
A. I believe that the family tree and the timeline
2 belong here and I already gave you copies of those.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]3
Q. Okay. Are there any specific exhibits that you
4 have identified and anticipate using at trial as you sit
5 here today?
6
A. Exhibits.
7
Q. Yeah.
8
A. I have not made a decision about that.
9
Q. Okay. All right. 21 is your CV. Let's go ahead
10 and mark that. Thank you. This will be No. 22. And so,
11 this is your most complete, accurate and up to date CV,
12 correct?
13
A. Correct.
14
Q. And this CV contains all of your publications,
15 whether they are published or in the works, correct?
16
A. Yes.
17
Q. And it also includes your conference and
18 symposium presentations, correct?
19
A. Correct.
20
Q. And you have several pages of those. Your CV is
21 15 pages total, correct?
22
A. Yes.
23
Q. Okay. I have a copy of a previous version of
24 your CV. There isn't anything in the one that we've marked
25 as Exhibit 22 that wasn't already included in the old
0118
1 version, older version of a CV, right?
2
A. No, this is an updated one.
3
Q. Yeah. The one that I've got, that was provided
4 to me previously, along with your disclosure, was 12 pages
5 long. So, it looks like you've added quite a bit to it?
6
A. Yes.
7
Q. All right. I'll just take a look at it real
8 quick. To save time, if I take a careful look at the 15
9 pages which comprise your CV, will I see anything in there
10 about any work relating to common knowledge and awareness
11 of the health risks of smoking cigarettes?
12
A. No.
13
Q. Okay. Let's go back to the duces tecum then, and
14 see if we can wrap that up. No. 22 asks for documents to
15 establish "An approximation of the portion of your
16 professional time and/or work devoted to service as an
17 expert for defendant during the past three years. This
18 estimate should be based on either hours expended, income
19 earned, or the approximate number of examinations performed
20 annually." I don't think No. 3 applies to you.
21
What I want to know is, to the extent you
22 referenced that 15 percent figure earlier, is that 15
23 percent figure based upon the time that you spend?
24
A. My professional time.
25
Q. Okay. It does not reflect income?
0119
1
A. It doesn't.
2
Q. Okay. What is the amount of income that you earn
3 doing consultation work through Cultural Translations for
4 Jones Day on these cigarette cases as a percentage of your
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]5 total income?
6
A. Based on the past few years, I would say that the
7 consultations represent roughly 55 percent of my income.
8
Q. All right. And when we say my income, I think
9 you mentioned to me earlier, please correct me if I'm
10 wrong, that the time that you bill under Cultural
11 Translations is actually a schedule on your personal income
12 tax return, correct?
13
A. Yes.
14
Q. Under the category of self-employment I believe?
15
A. Correct.
16
Q. All right. So, that when you say that the work
17 that you've done for Jones Day on these cigarette cases
18 comprises 55 percent of your total income, the total income
19 would include your work as a history professor at UCF,
20 correct?
21
A. Correct.
22
Q. And it would include work that you do consulting
23 for other clients? I forget the work that you said that
24 you do here locally.
25
A. Yeah. That's really minimal.
0120
1
Q. Okay.
2
A. We're talking about a few hundred dollars.
3
Q. All right. So, if we look at your income as a
4 whole, 45 percent of your income more or less comes from
5 your work as a history professor at UCF, correct?
6
A. Correct.
7
Q. And then, 55 percent of your income comes from
8 your work on these cigarette cases, correct?
9
A. That is an approximate estimate.
10
Q. I understand. How long has it been the case that
11 55 percent of your income is derived from work on cigarette
12 cases?
13
A. That's something that would have happened in the
14 last three years.
15
Q. Okay. So that I make sure that I understand your
16 answer, for the past three years, has 55 percent of your
17 income, of your total income come from your work on
18 cigarette cases?
19
A. Yes, an estimate of the three years as a set.
20
Q. I understand. And has the percentage of your
21 total income for the work on these cigarette cases
22 increased or decreased over time?
23
A. It has been pretty stable over the last four,
24 five, six years.
25
Q. Okay. And by pretty stable, you mean it just
0121
1 hasn't really varied that much?
2
A. In hours, yes.
3
Q. In hours. Okay. But I want to focus on the
4 percentage of your total income. Has the percentage of
5 your total income derived from work on cigarette cases
6 varied significantly over the last four to six years?
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]7
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
8
A. It has varied. I wouldn't characterize it as
9 significantly.
10
Q. Right.
11
A. But it has varied.
12
Q. How has it varied?
13
A. For example, when my fee was lower than $225, it
14 was different. So that accounts for a difference there.
15
Q. Oh, I see. What was it before it was 225?
16
A. I don't have that number in my mind. I can give
17 you an approximation, if you want.
18
Q. Yeah, sure.
19
A. 175.
20
Q. Okay. Why did you increase it?
21
A. I increased it because of my value, because of
22 the growing value of my time. The fact that I was
23 promoted, and the fact that I had many years of experience
24 doing that.
25
Q. Okay. Was the 225 rate a rate that you had to
0122
1 negotiate with Jones Day?
2
A. I expressed my interest in that rate of $225.
3
Q. Okay. And their response was?
4
A. Yes.
5
Q. Okay. In other words, you didn't ask for 250 and
6 they bargained with you and you agreed on 225?
7
A. That's correct.
8
Q. Okay. You believe you were making $175 an hour
9 and you increased it to 225 because you thought you were
10 worth it, and Jones Day accepted that increase?
11
A. Yes.
12
Q. They didn't put up much of a fight, did they?
13
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to form.
14
A. Not at all.
15
Q. Do you enjoy doing this work on these cigarette
16 cases?
17
A. I derive enjoyment from it.
18
Q. Do you want to continue doing it?
19
A. I'm interested in continuing to do that.
20
Q. How many cases are you currently working on?
21
MR. KEEHFUS: Let me just interpose an objection.
22
You can discuss the cases that you know you have been
23
disclosed as an expert on. But to the extent that you
24
are a consulting expert, and you have not been
25
disclosed, I'm instructing you not to answer the
0123
1
question to that extent.
2
MR. GARCIA: All right. So you're limiting the
3
instruction to litigated cases?
4
MR. KEEHFUS: I'm limiting the answer to cases
5
which he knows he has been disclosed as a testifying
6
expert.
7
MR. GARCIA: Right, which would be the litigated
8
cases, right? I hope so.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]9
MR. KEEHFUS: Well, do you understand --
10
MR. GARCIA: With that instruction in mind what
11
is your answer?
12
MR. KEEHFUS: Do you understand what I'm saying?
13
THE WITNESS: Yes.
14
MR. KEEHFUS: Thank you.
15
A. I can give you a list of what comes to mind.
16 There is a Wendel case, there is a Talenfeld case, there's
17 a Skolnick case, there's a Kaplan case. Those are the ones
18 that I remember. Now, I have been disclosed in other
19 cases, that I'm not a hundred percent sure whether they're
20 still active or not.
21
Q. Okay. All right. Just to close the loop on Item
22 22 of the duces tecum, again the 15 percent figure that you
23 mentioned earlier in deposition relates to the total amount
24 of time that you attribute to work on cigarette cases,
25 correct?
0124
1
A. The total amount of my professional work time.
2
Q. Right. So, put it into the proper context for
3 me. When you say the total amount of time, what are you
4 doing with 85 percent of your time?
5
A. With the other 85 percent of the time, I teach, I
6 do research, I serve in professional capacities for
7 organizations such as the College Board, I publish,
8 basically that's --
9
Q. Okay. All right. And then, with regard to the
10 55 percent figure then, again that's a percentage of the
11 income that you'd derive working on the cigarette cases in
12 relationship to your total income, correct?
13
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form, asked and
14
answered.
15
A. Correct. For the past three years that's the
16 ballpark figure.
17
Q. Thank you. Item 23, which I believe is the last
18 item, are the lists of cases in which you have testified as
19 an expert at trial or in deposition which you compiled
20 pursuant to Federal Rule 26, any similar state rule or any
21 court order?
22
A. That information appears in my disclosure as an
23 expert.
24
Q. I guess I missed that part. Do you have a copy
25 with you?
0125
1
A. No, I don't have that.
2
MR. GARCIA: Okay. Well, then, what we'll do is
3
we'll just save a place for it. And if you could just
4
get that to me, Jason, I would appreciate it.
5
MR. KEEHFUS: I think what the doctor is saying
6
is that this was provided already as part of his --
7
MR. GARCIA: I know, I don't have it.
8
MR. KEEHFUS: Okay.
9
MR. GARCIA: That's all I'm saying. If you have
10
it, and you can just email it to me, then we will
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]11
supplement the transcript with it. And then when you
12
sign the transcript, then you can confirm that it's
13
accurate. Does that sound fair?
14
THE WITNESS: Sounds fair.
15
MR. GARCIA: Why don't we take a break.
16
(Recess taken).
17 BY MR. GARCIA:
18
Q. So, are there any other documents that you
19 brought with you today that we haven't already discussed?
20 I hope you will say no.
21
A. No. These are originals.
22
Q. Originals, okay. Originals of what?
23
A. Of what you have.
24
Q. Of what we have here? Okay. Well, in terms of
25 what you were asked to do on this particular case, have you
0126
1 completed all of your work?
2
A. I have not.
3
Q. Okay. What else do you still need to do?
4
A. I still need to go back to the documents that I
5 identified as potentially useful last week, and analyze
6 them, make notes out of them, as I usually do.
7
Q. Well, have you reached a point in your work in
8 this case where you have formulated opinions?
9
A. Yes, I have preliminary opinions.
10
Q. Okay. They're not final opinions at this point?
11
A. I don't like to call them final until I've looked
12 at the documentation that I believe I need to look at.
13
Q. That's what I was going to ask. Will they be
14 final opinions when you are done looking at whatever else
15 you feel you need to look at?
16
A. Yes.
17
Q. Okay. And when do you anticipate that will be?
18
A. I anticipate doing that, ballpark figure, within
19 the next two or three weeks.
20
Q. Okay. All right. What are your preliminary
21 opinions?
22
A. My preliminary opinions are that -- well, based
23 on the depositions alone, there's plenty of testimony that
24 Juanita Thurston was aware of the dangers of smoking. And
25 that a variety of media reached her and these are media
0127
1 that carry those kinds of stories. Also that there's
2 testimony to the effect that people told her about the
3 health risks of smoking. So, my preliminary conclusion I
4 don't believe is going to change, was that she had that
5 awareness about the health consequences of smoking.
6
Q. So, you're saying that you can reach the
7 conclusions that are reflected in your disclosure just
8 based on the testimony that has been gathered in this case?
9
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
10
A. No, that's not what I said.
11
Q. Okay. What testimony supports your preliminary
12 opinion that the health risks of smoking reached Juanita
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]13 Thurston?
14
A. That appeared in several depositions, in terms of
15 her being aware, I can think of testimony by Gwendolyn
16 Odom, testimony by Thaddeus Hayes.
17
Q. Thaddeus.
18
A. Thaddeus.
19
Q. He's the one that told her, "You shouldn't be
20 smoking, these are bad for you," right?
21
A. That's correct.
22
Q. All right. Who else?
23
A. There's information in, I believe, in one of the
24 sisters, and I'm doing my best to try to present the
25 picture.
0128
1
Q. Well, listen, if you need to refer to any of your
2 notes, knock yourself out.
3
A. Then I'd rather do that.
4
Q. Yeah. So, what we're focusing on, just so we
5 understand for the record, you're providing to me that
6 testimony that you rely upon for your preliminary opinion
7 that Juanita reached an awareness of the health risks of
8 smoking?
9
A. Yes. We're talking about the testimonies now.
10
Q. Right. Well, and I'm focusing on that because
11 you just got done saying a couple of moments ago that just
12 "based on the testimony alone," you have reached that
13 preliminary opinion, correct?
14
A. Yes, I said that, but that does not exclude other
15 sources.
16
Q. Oh, I understand. And that's because you're not
17 done doing your work yet, right?
18
A. That's correct.
19
Q. So, Gwen, her daughter, Thaddeus Hayes, her
20 former son-in-law, who else?
21
A. I believe -- maybe I should look at the notes I
22 took. I'm going to look at the notes for Mildred Evans.
23
Q. That was her childhood friend or long time
24 friend?
25
A. Yes.
0129
1
Q. All right.
2
A. That does not appear in the notes for this
3 deposition.
4
Q. Okay. I'm just saying, use the notes to refresh
5 your recollection.
6
Oh, you mean Thaddeus, you haven't made notes on
7 Thaddeus's deposition yet?
8
A. I have made notes on Thaddeus.
9
First instance that I find as reflected in my
10 notes, back in 1976, Gwendolyn had a conversation with her
11 mother about quitting. And the mother said something along
12 the lines of she needed to stop smoking.
13
Q. Okay. So does that cover Gwen?
14
A. I'm still looking at the notes.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]15
Q. Sure, go ahead.
16
A. My notes also reflect that Juanita tried to quit
17 in 1983 because it was bad for her.
18
Q. Is that also from Gwen?
19
A. That's from Gwen.
20
Q. Yes.
21
A. I have another note also from Gwendolyn's
22 depositions and it says George Harden may have told Gwen --
23 no, I'm sorry, take that back. It doesn't respond to your
24 question.
25
Q. Okay.
0130
1
A. I'm done with Gwen's depos, and I'm moving to
2 Moranda. Now I'm jumping to Bobby Lee Thurston.
3
Thaddeus Hayes. Okay. I found a segment from
4 that deposition, and I'm going to read it. The question is
5 "Did Ms. Juanita Thurston know that smoking was hazardous
6 to her health?" The answer from Thaddeus is, "I am sure
7 she did."
8
Q. Okay.
9
A. Another part of the deposition is that Thaddeus
10 recalls having conversations with Juanita on the fact that
11 cigarettes were harmful. Another one, and this is a quote,
12 this is from Thaddeus, "I would say, well, you know,
13 Juanita, you should not be smoking," and she would say, "I
14 know, I know."
15
Testimony that Thaddeus told Juanita that she
16 needed to quit because cigarettes are not good. There's
17 testimony that Ms. Thurston referred to cigarettes as
18 cancer sticks. And that he, Thaddeus, told Juanita about
19 smoking being bad as early as 1974. And Thaddeus also says
20 that Gwen told Juanita that smoking was bad. And would
21 tell her mom that she needed to quit, and Thaddeus was
22 present during those types of conversations.
23
Thaddeus quotes something he heard from Juanita
24 and the exact quote is, "This is a bad habit. I need to
25 quit." And then further down, Thaddeus says that Juanita
0131
1 referred to smoking as a bad habit, every time I gave her a
2 pack of cigarettes. And told her, they weren't good.
3
There's a question for him, and the question is,
4 "It's your testimony that Juanita knew that cigarettes were
5 harmful as far back as 1968?" And the response is "Yes."
6
Now moving to Randy Odom.
7
Q. Before you move on to him, doctor, did you make
8 any notations with regard to the testimony of Thaddeus
9 Hayes that in his opinion Juanita was addicted to
10 cigarettes?
11
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
12
A. I looked through this quickly for the sake of
13 time.
14
Q. Quickly meaning your notes?
15
A. My notes.
16
Q. Okay.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]17
A. I may have skipped -- I'm not sure. But my
18 answer is based on this quick read, there appears to be no
19 note of mine on that.
20
Q. All right.
21
A. Randy Odom says that in one conversation with
22 Ms. Thurston she told him that she wished she never picked
23 up smoking. And that that conversation would have been in
24 1987 or perhaps a little after that.
25
Bobby Thurston Newsome, looking at another one.
0132
1
Those are the notes that I have thus far on
2 depositions.
3
Q. Based on the ones that you indicated to us
4 earlier that you reviewed, right?
5
A. The ones that I reviewed, exclusively.
6
Q. All right. Based on what you reviewed so far,
7 does any of the testimony corroborate the notion that
8 Juanita was aware of the risks of smoking cigarettes before
9 1968?
10
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
11
A. I don't recall directly, but there's information
12 here, I believe, that points to that. I haven't looked at
13 --
14
Q. When you say information, I'm interested in
15 testimony that you reviewed. What information do you
16 believe points to it?
17
A. I wasn't looking for that when I read it, so, I
18 don't know if you want me to read it again for that.
19
Q. You mean what, you mean the testimony, the notes
20 of your testimony that you read so far?
21
A. Yes.
22
Q. Okay. Well, I thought that you were reading it
23 in order to help me understand the foundation for your
24 opinion -- I'm sorry, the foundation for your preliminary
25 opinion that Juanita was aware of the health risks
0133
1 associated with smoking cigarettes, did I understand that
2 correctly?
3
A. In the context of, in which you pose that
4 question --
5
Q. Yeah.
6
A. -- I read your question as meaning direct
7 testimony, and testimony to that effect, that she was
8 aware.
9
Q. Okay.
10
A. There are other pieces of information in these
11 notes that allow me to understand that she was exposed to
12 other sources of information.
13
Q. Okay. Things like where she went to school,
14 things of that nature?
15
A. Newspapers that she subscribed to, that type of
16 thing.
17
Q. Have you seen anything so far that would help you
18 reach the opinion that Juanita Thurston was aware that
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]19 cigarettes caused lung cancer?
20
A. I can -- you mean in the depositions or
21 generally?
22
Q. Well, let's start with the depositions and then
23 we'll expand it.
24
A. Lung cancer specifically, no. There were people
25 around her, close relatives, her father, for example, who
0134
1 was a smoker, who died of throat or tongue cancer.
2
In terms of -- it's helpful for me to corroborate
3 specifically for Juanita that the media that reached the
4 community also reached her with information on the nature
5 of the harmful effects of smoking.
6
Q. Okay. Well, with that answer in mind, are you
7 aware of any information to support the opinion, if you
8 have one, that Juanita Thurston believed that cigarettes
9 caused lung cancer in the fifties?
10
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
11
A. I have a basis to -- I have a basis to say yes.
12 And that would be information from the textbooks that were
13 including that type of information, news items, that was a
14 major story, that connection during the 1950s and even
15 before that.
16
So, all of that information was information that
17 reached her household through a variety of means. And I'm
18 not even counting sources such as word of mouth. So, I can
19 identify media that provided that message and that
20 information that she had direct access to. And again, the
21 newspapers, news on TV, specifically those are the first
22 that come to mind.
23
Q. Sure. We'll try and isolate those, but are you
24 essentially of the opinion that one can infer based on the
25 fact that the media was disseminating that information in
0135
1 the fifties that that information actually reached Juanita?
2
A. I cannot make that claim for one particular
3 newscast or newspaper. I cannot make that link. The link
4 that I make is that that information reached not only the
5 community, but they had a TV set, she kept up with current
6 events, she had a wide circle of friends, and was very
7 active in institutions such as her church, where that type
8 of information, because it's common to the community, is
9 very likely to have been exchanged in conversations.
10
Q. Okay. And so you are inferring based on her
11 exposure to all of the different elements that she
12 described that she in fact was aware that cigarettes caused
13 lung cancer in the 1950s --
14
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to form.
15
Q. -- correct?
16
A. That information reached her.
17
Q. Okay. And you are providing that opinion as a
18 matter of fact, correct?
19
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
20
A. Yes.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]21
Q. Okay. All right. And would your opinion be the
22 same for the time period of the 1960s?
23
A. Yes, it would be the same.
24
Q. Now, do you have an opinion as to whether RJR as
25 a corporation knew that cigarettes caused lung cancer in
0136
1 the 1950s?
2
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
3
A. I don't have any basis to say that one way or the
4 other.
5
Q. Why not?
6
A. Because I have not come across any document or
7 any mention that would sustain that.
8
Q. Okay. Well, were you asked to provide such an
9 opinion when you were hired by Jones Day back in 2001?
10
A. On what the companies knew?
11
Q. Yeah.
12
A. No, that never came up.
13
Q. Have you ever been asked that during the course
14 of the last 11 or 12 years that you have done this work?
15
A. By Jones Day?
16
Q. Yes.
17
A. No, I haven't.
18
Q. And has Jones Day ever harnessed your ability to
19 perform any type of research?
20
A. Never.
21
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
22
Q. All right. Then, would the same hold true as far
23 as any opinions that you might have as to whether RJR
24 believed that smoking caused lung cancer in the sixties?
25
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to form.
0137
1
A. I don't have any basis to say yes or no to that.
2 That was not part of my research.
3
Q. Okay. And how about the seventies?
4
A. The answer is the same.
5
Q. The answer would be the same with respect to any
6 period of time, because it's never been a part of your
7 research, correct?
8
A. It's never been a part of my research, that's
9 correct.
10
Q. All right.
11
A. And I don't recall seeing that in the documents
12 and materials that I have studied.
13
Q. Sure. Have you ever seen that in any of the
14 materials that are available in the public domain?
15
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to form.
16
A. Public domain. I don't recall that, seeing that.
17
Q. Okay. When you say you don't recall, can you
18 rule it out one way or the other?
19
A. With a large degree of certainty --
20
Q. Yeah.
21
A. -- I can rule out that I have not seen those
22 documents.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]23
Q. Okay. As a professional historian, when you are
24 performing research on a topic do you want to gather as
25 much information as you possibly can in order to have a
0138
1 full and complete understanding of the subject?
2
A. The information that I determine that is useful
3 for the purposes of the particular research, yes, that's an
4 objective. However, in many instances of research, you
5 know that there are more things out there, but, it's not --
6 the rate of return is very small. So, if you spent more
7 and more and more hours, it's not going to change --
8
Q. Okay.
9
A. -- your conclusion.
10
Q. Well, to the extent that the subject that you
11 were commissioned to research involves cigarette smoking
12 and you have been retained on behalf of cigarette companies
13 to perform that work, would it be important for you as a
14 professional historian to understand what information if
15 any the cigarette companies themselves were putting out
16 into the public domain?
17
A. That was part of the broad picture. Insofar as
18 that information was reaching the public, that was part of
19 the universe of information that I considered and I
20 examined.
21
Q. Okay. And so, for example, in looking at
22 history, does the year 1964 figure prominently in your
23 research concerning public awareness of the hazards
24 associated with smoking?
25
A. Yes.
0139
1
Q. And why is that?
2
A. The reason for that is that was the year of the
3 Surgeon General's report on smoking and health, which was
4 the first of its kind. That was a story that received
5 widespread publicity through every media. The report
6 itself was sent to, I believe, it was in the hundreds of
7 thousands of copies. In most papers the segments of that
8 report appear, sometimes many pages.
9
Those findings in that report sparked a wide
10 array of activities that would look further into smoking
11 and health. Some of that was government entities, some of
12 that were organizations like the PTA, for example. In
13 other words, yes, it was a huge year in terms of
14 information reaching the public on that subject.
15
Q. And I take it that there is a lot of information,
16 lots of source documents, and perhaps even video
17 information that was available to you in performing your
18 research, correct?
19
A. On the significance of 1964?
20
Q. Yes.
21
A. Yes.
22
Q. All right. And in performing that research did
23 you analyze the response by cigarette companies to the
24 release of the Surgeon General's report?
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]25
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
0140
1
A. Insofar as those responses reached the public?
2
Q. Yeah.
3
A. Yes. Some of the reports on smoking and health
4 included statements by tobacco, by the tobacco industry.
5
Q. Okay. And in researching the statements by the
6 tobacco industry in your opinion, did the tobacco industry,
7 companies that manufacture cigarettes, did they embrace and
8 accept the Surgeon General's report?
9
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
10
A. They embraced parts of it. They embraced parts
11 of other similar reports, sometimes reaching the same
12 conclusion that more research needs to be done, for
13 example. And there were instances in which their response
14 was not -- one of not embracing them. However, one of the
15 things that I kept in mind as I was looking at those
16 statements was the context. So if it was a half page
17 story, say, on the report, I would look at that information
18 from the industry in the context of that whole story.
19
Q. In your opinion, did the cigarette companies
20 warmly receive the release of the Surgeon General's report
21 in 1964?
22
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
23
A. They responded to it, and there was disagreement
24 that I recall --
25
Q. Okay.
0141
1
A. -- with some aspects of that report.
2
Q. How would you characterize the disagreement?
3
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form. Go ahead.
4
A. In occasions they would say, well, this is not
5 new research, which is something that the Surgeon General's
6 report did not intend to do. The nature of the Surgeon
7 General's report was that it was a study of hundreds, if
8 not thousands, of other studies before. So, it's a
9 response, that there's an agreement.
10
In other instances, they would call for more
11 research. And in other instances they would say, well,
12 there's a relation that has been established but we still
13 need to have more scientific research that explains what
14 that relationship is. So, those are the kinds of responses
15 that I recall.
16
Q. Do you have any other preliminary opinions?
17
A. Along the lines of the main focus of the
18 research, my preliminary opinions are that somebody like
19 Juanita Thurston because of documents that pertain
20 specifically to her, but also because of my understanding
21 of the community of which she was part of, that she
22 received information beginning at an early age that smoking
23 was harmful. And that there were addictive qualities to
24 nicotine.
25
MR. KEEHFUS: Can you read back the answer?
0142
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]1
(Answer read back at Page 141, Lines 17 - 24).
2 BY MR. GARCIA:
3
Q. All right. So, let's focus on those last few
4 words, specifically addictive qualities of nicotine.
5 Without sparing any detail tell me what information Juanita
6 herself received to support your preliminary opinion that
7 she was aware of the addictive qualities of nicotine?
8
A. For one, school textbooks for health and in many
9 instances for biology used that precise terminology. They
10 used the term addictive. That would be one of them. I
11 guess, well, I don't guess, I know that people also gather
12 information by observing the world around them, and knowing
13 that somebody's smoking and it's difficult for them to
14 quit. Also, basically the textbooks. There were news
15 items, referring to newspapers that used that language
16 early on.
17
Q. That she was exposed to?
18
A. That would have reached her community.
19
Q. Okay.
20
A. And by the way, I think it's important for me to
21 explain a little bit about the term addiction. When I used
22 it, I used it in a nonpsychological term, I used it in a
23 general laymen's term. But there are many other ways in
24 which that was conveyed. It's hard to quit, for example.
25 It's something that grabs ahold of you. So, the term
0143
1 addiction, I've used it in the sense that it was used in
2 those early textbooks.
3
Q. Okay. So, if I look in those early textbooks
4 will I literally see the word addicted or addiction or
5 anything using the root term --
6
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to form.
7
Q. -- addict?
8
A. I recall seeing that language used in some
9 textbooks.
10
Q. Okay.
11
A. Almost every textbook that touched upon health
12 and smoking also made reference to the fact that it was a
13 habit. That was another term used.
14
Q. Right. In the context of it being a bad habit,
15 right?
16
A. Bad and also difficult to quit.
17
Q. Well, it didn't characterize it as a good habit,
18 did it?
19
A. I never saw that.
20
Q. Okay. All right. So, in the universe of
21 documents that are out there, can you identify specifically
22 for me what textbooks Juanita would have seen or read that
23 discussed cigarette smoking as being addictive?
24
A. I can't do that right now because I haven't
25 gotten to that stage. What I do know is texts that were
0144
1 adopted or selected for adoption by the State of Florida,
2 so, I would have to pin down some specific titles.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]3
Q. Sure. For purposes of today are the texts that
4 were adopted by the State of Florida, which you believe may
5 have reached Juanita, listed in Exhibit 18, the Reliance
6 List, or in any of the other documents that you brought
7 with you here today?
8
A. Yes.
9
Q. Would you please show me where I can find that
10 anywhere in the documents that you brought with you?
11
A. I found one which is No. 124.
12
Q. On the Reliance List, Exhibit 18?
13
A. Yes.
14
Q. Okay. Let me get there. Tell me again the
15 number, please?
16
A. 124.
17
Q. Thank you. If you have any others, just rattle
18 off the numbers.
19
A. 193.
20
Q. Okay.
21
A. I'm not doing this methodically, I'm just
22 shifting through the pages, if that's okay.
23
Q. Yeah.
24
A. 252, 264, 373, 427, 428, 429, 474, 475, 476, 477,
25 478, 479, 480, 481, 709, 54, 55, 111, 288, 291, 333, 334,
0145
1 335, 336, 337, 344, 388, 397, 398, 399, 400, 441, 442, 496,
2 513, 512, 576.
3
Q. In the interest of time, based on the ones that
4 you have identified, do you have an opinion as to which one
5 of those if any would have reached Juanita Thurston?
6
A. No.
7
Q. And is that because you still have work that you
8 have to finish in this case?
9
A. Yes.
10
Q. Okay. All right. But those are just what, a
11 sampling of the universe of documents in the education
12 system at different points in time?
13
A. It's not a sampling really, it's based on
14 information that I have gathered in the past as to which
15 textbooks were being adopted in the schools.
16
Q. Okay. Well, in trying to determine which ones
17 Juanita would have been exposed to, what are the things
18 that you would have to consider?
19
A. Well, the first thing that I would have to do is
20 go back to my notes and to the publications that provide
21 information on what textbooks were being adopted.
22
Q. Okay.
23
A. And then, see how those fit with the years during
24 which Juanita was in school.
25
Q. Okay.
0146
1
A. And at that point I would be able to affirm which
2 books were likely to have been used in her school.
3
Q. Well, I'm looking at Exhibit 14, which is your
4 timeline for Juanita Thurston, born in 19 -- from 1934 to
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]5 '67, is the first page. Is that something that you would
6 refer to in determining when she was in school?
7
A. Yes.
8
Q. Okay. And as we sit here, can you tell us what
9 years she would have been in school based on your work in
10 this case?
11
A. Yes. The direct information that I have is that
12 in the year 1948 - 1949, the academic year, she was in the
13 7th grade. And that the following year, she was in the 8th
14 grade for the academic year, 1949 - 1950. Now, that is the
15 direct information that I have from her report card or
16 transcripts.
17
Q. Right. And that's important information, isn't
18 it?
19
A. Yes.
20
Q. In trying to narrow down the list of
21 possibilities of school textbooks that she would have been
22 exposed to?
23
A. Yes.
24
Q. All right. What else would you want to know?
25
A. I would want to know about what?
0147
1
Q. In order to determine what textbooks she was
2 exposed to?
3
A. I would need to know the grades and the years and
4 then correlate those with the years of adoption because I
5 do have information on which books were adopted. So, I
6 would have to bring those two sets of information
7 together --
8
Q. Right.
9
A. -- to establish that.
10
Q. Okay. In arriving at your preliminary opinion
11 that she was exposed to information in school textbooks
12 that smoking cigarettes was addictive, have you done that
13 work to determine what specific textbooks she was exposed
14 to?
15
A. I have not done that yet.
16
Q. Okay. All right. But are you fairly confident
17 based on your prior work that she would have received that
18 information if she was in school?
19
A. Based on my prior work, and my familiarity with
20 really hundreds of textbooks, and the fact that all of
21 these textbooks touched upon smoking and health, a vast
22 number of them, perhaps I would feel comfortable saying the
23 majority of them make some allusion to the fact that it was
24 a habit, to the fact that they may or may have not used the
25 word addiction, many of these texts state very clearly that
0148
1 nicotine is addictive.
2
Q. Right. But as you sit here today you can't tell
3 us about the ones that relate specifically to Juanita,
4 right?
5
A. Specifically, no.
6
Q. Okay. All right. In the category of information
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]7 that's available in the public domain, are you ranking
8 school textbooks at the very top of that list --
9
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
10
Q. -- in terms of information specific to Juanita's
11 case?
12
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
13
A. No, I'm not.
14
Q. Is it pretty high up there?
15
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
16
A. It's hard to tell because what I do is I look at
17 people in different stages of their life. So, textbooks is
18 something that I associate with the school years. At
19 another stage in their life, they may not come -- while
20 they're not using textbooks, still their children and
21 grandchildren are using textbooks.
22
Q. Okay. And are you assuming that the information
23 that their children and grandchildren are exposed to is
24 also reaching individuals?
25
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
0149
1
A. I have found plenty of evidence to that effect.
2
Q. All right. And have you reached any opinions in
3 that regard in relationship to this case?
4
A. So far, if the question pertains to textbooks of
5 children and grandchildren reaching Juanita directly, I
6 have not come to that conclusion.
7
Q. Okay. Do you have any other preliminary opinions
8 in this case?
9
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
10
A. The preliminary opinions are that --
11
Q. And I don't mean to interrupt you, I'm using the
12 term "preliminary" because I've asked you if your opinions
13 are complete and crystallized, and you've indicated to me
14 that they are not, but that you have preliminary opinions.
15 So, I'm assuming that nothing is set in stone at this
16 point, is that fair to say?
17
A. Yes.
18
Q. Okay. So --
19
A. The primary ones are the ones that -- because now
20 you asked about additional, right?
21
Q. Well, I just want to know everything that you're
22 kicking around at this point in time.
23
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
24
A. My central conclusions are that information about
25 the health risks of smoking, and the fact that it could be
0150
1 difficult to quit reached Juanita Thurston and reached the
2 community and those around her.
3
Q. But in terms of specifics, you haven't really
4 crystallized that yet, right?
5
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
6
A. What do you refer by specifics?
7
Q. Specific textbooks, specific publications that
8 reached Juanita Thurston.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]9
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
10
A. I haven't made the final determination on
11 textbooks but I have established, for example, that based
12 on the depositions, people that saw magazines such as Time
13 and Newsweek at her home, that she subscribed to the Palm
14 Beach Post, West Palm Beach Post, and information about
15 broadcast news reaching her home, and she watching them,
16 so, I can establish those categories of direct connections
17 and others.
18
Q. All right. But you can't do that today, can you?
19
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
20
A. Well, I cannot connect textbooks, specific titles
21 of textbooks with her today.
22
Q. Okay.
23
A. That I can't do today.
24
Q. All right. Let me just go back a second to your
25 disclosure. I think I may have overlooked this, but there
0151
1 is a list of cases that appears in the last paragraph of
2 your disclosure, which was Exhibit 9 for identification.
3 And I can show it to you here on my screen, but it says
4 here at the last paragraph during the past three years
5 Dr. Martinez has given testimony in the case of, and it
6 starts with the case of Robin Cohen vs. RJR. Do you have
7 it in front of you now?
8
A. Yes.
9
Q. Okay. So, would those be all of the cases that
10 you have given testimony in, in the last three years?
11
A. It appears to be comprehensive, yes.
12
Q. Are there any cases missing from that list?
13
A. No.
14
Q. Okay. Before I forget, how much money have you
15 been paid since you began doing this research on behalf of
16 cigarette companies in 2001?
17
A. Since 2001, it approximates 600,000.
18
Q. Okay. Are you including year to date totals for
19 2012?
20
A. Yes.
21
Q. All right. I know that we had some discussion
22 about Exhibit 7, which is the document that has the August
23 4, 11:30 a.m. title on it, and the fact that Exhibit 6,
24 which is the computerized version is the more accurate
25 version, but my question is simply this, as I look through
0152
1 here, there are several excerpts from articles that appear
2 in the Palm Beach Post, for example?
3
A. Yes.
4
Q. Are these articles that I'm going to find on the
5 three disks that were provided to me?
6
A. No. I have not yet looked at those, nor I have
7 yet provided those to Jones Day.
8
Q. So, you've collected these articles somehow, but
9 you haven't analyzed them?
10
A. It's a very recent acquisition and I have not
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]11 analyzed them.
12
Q. Where did you acquire those articles?
13
A. I had a research assistant look at the online
14 collection, which includes the Palm Beach Post, I believe
15 also the Daily News, and using certain key words, I
16 instructed the research assistant to get all of them that
17 included those key words.
18
Q. Okay. All right. So you still have to look at
19 all of these articles and determine which ones are relevant
20 to this case?
21
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
22
A. I have to look at them, yes, and at that point
23 I'll make a determination of their relevance.
24
Q. What else do you need to do in order to finish
25 your work in this case, keeping in mind we have an October
0153
1 trial date?
2
A. First and foremost on my list is to give a
3 careful look and examination to the materials that I have
4 found in the Pompano Beach Town News. The same thing for
5 any sources that I may have identified during this last
6 week that seem to be promising. Thirdly, I want to give a
7 careful look at the Palm Beach Post articles that we were
8 just discussing a minute ago.
9
Q. Okay.
10
A. There may be other things that I want to do, for
11 example, take a closer look at other newspapers, I'm
12 thinking about Fort Lauderdale newspapers. There may be
13 other things, but in essence, I think that reflects my
14 current agenda.
15
Q. When would you estimate would be a good time for
16 us to visit with each other again so that I can learn what
17 your full and final opinions are?
18
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
19
A. As I said earlier, I think in a matter of two or
20 three weeks, and this is an estimate, I will have a much
21 stronger sense of the materials that I want to or may want
22 to use because I will have examined the sets of documents
23 that I just enumerated a couple of minutes ago.
24
MR. GARCIA: Okay. All right. Well, then, I'm
25
not going to use up any more of your time today.
0154
1
We'll continue this deposition until such time as your
2
opinions are final. Okay?
3
THE WITNESS: Okay.
4
MR. GARCIA: Thank you for your time.
5
THE WITNESS: Thank you, sir.
6
MR. KEEHFUS: I do have a few questions for you.
7
MR. GARCIA: Famous last words.
8
CROSS-EXAMINATION
9 BY MR. KEEHFUS:
10
Q. Dr. Martinez, how are you doing this afternoon?
11
A. I'm doing well, thank you.
12
Q. Earlier today you told us about a method or
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]13 protocol that you use in your historical research, do you
14 recall that?
15
A. Yes, I do.
16
Q. Does that protocol or method have a name within
17 your professional community?
18
A. It's generally understood to be the historical
19 method, but the historical method is broader than what I
20 described. What I described were the phases, starting with
21 an acquisition of documents phase. And then the following
22 phase would be the analysis and the careful examination
23 that allows me to reach conclusions.
24
Now, generally speaking that's the way this
25 works. But, and particularly in a case like this, you may
0155
1 be finding information at one point and analyze it, and
2 then realize that there's another set of documents and you
3 analyze them again. So, generally speaking it is that
4 order, acquisition and analysis, but it could happen
5 simultaneously.
6
Q. You were asked several questions about "general
7 awareness today," do you remember that?
8
A. Yes.
9
MR. GARCIA: Form only because I don't remember.
10 BY MR. KEEHFUS:
11
Q. In this case, have I asked you to conduct
12 historical research on the public awareness of the risk of
13 smoking, including the fact that it could be difficult to
14 quit, is that in fact what you've done in this case?
15
A. That's part of what I've done.
16
Q. Part of what you've done.
17
A. Yes. So, it's different levels, national
18 awareness, regional awareness, and then the person and the
19 people around her.
20
Q. Okay. You were asked about testimony in the
21 record of Ms. Thurston's awareness of the risk of smoking,
22 do you remember that?
23
A. Yes.
24
Q. And what you did was to go through your notes
25 that you had made, scan through them, the minutes that you
0156
1 took, and gave answers based on those notes, is that right?
2
A. Yes. I focused exclusively on direct statements
3 by people being deposed saying that she was aware at one
4 point or another.
5
Q. And to do that, you used the notes that you had
6 taken on these depositions today, right?
7
A. Correct.
8
Q. Okay. And are your notes used to refresh your
9 memory?
10
A. They're used to record information and it helps
11 to refresh my memory, yes.
12
Q. Do you record every single individual fact that
13 may be important to you in your notes?
14
A. I record the ones that I think are important.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]15
Q. But just because they're in your notes that
16 doesn't mean that there are not other facts that are also
17 important to you?
18
A. That's correct.
19
Q. For instance, you read Ms. Bobby Thurston's
20 deposition?
21
A. Yes.
22
Q. And do you recall her testifying about
23 Ms. Thurston's parents and how they felt about their
24 children smoking?
25
A. I recall that, yes.
0157
1
Q. What do you recall about that?
2
A. I recall in her testimony that her parents were
3 opposed to it and told them that it was bad from an early
4 age.
5
Q. And you told Mr. Garcia that you reviewed
6 Ms. Gwendolyn Odom's deposition, is that right?
7
A. That's correct.
8
Q. And do you recall Ms. Gwendolyn Odom testifying
9 specifically regarding Ms. Thurston's awareness regarding
10 whether smoking was addictive?
11
A. Yes, I do.
12
Q. What do you recall about that?
13
A. Addictive, I would have to go back to my notes,
14 but I recall something along those lines, from my reading
15 of the document.
16
Q. Let me see if I can refresh your recollection, if
17 you give me just one second. I'm going to direct your
18 testimony to Ms. Gwendolyn Odom's deposition, Volume 3,
19 Page 274, and specifically Lines 24, 25, and Page 275,
20 Lines 1 through 3. Would you take a look at that, please?
21
A. Question --
22
Q. Just take a look at it.
23
A. I'm sorry.
24
Q. Let me know when you're done reading it.
25
A. I read it.
0158
1
Q. Okay. Does that refresh your recollection,
2 Dr. Martinez-Fernandez, regarding Ms. Gwendolyn Odom's
3 specific testimony regarding her mother's awareness of the
4 fact that smoking was addictive?
5
A. It does refresh my memory, yes.
6
Q. And what do you recall about that, sir?
7
A. I recall the statement that Gwendolyn said when
8 she was asked whether her mother knew that she was addicted
9 for 20 or 30 years, and the witness response is
10 affirmative, "Yes, uh-huh."
11
Q. 20 or 30 years in reference to what?
12
A. My reading of this would be 20 or 30 years before
13 1992.
14
Q. Okay. You were asked about Ms. Thurston's
15 awareness of the health consequences of smoking, and in
16 specific lung cancer, do you recall that?
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]17
A. Yes.
18
Q. And while you were describing the foundation for
19 your opinions to Mr. Garcia, you referenced Mr. Thaddeus
20 Hayes's testimony that Ms. Thurston had referred to
21 cigarettes as cancer sticks. Do you remember that?
22
A. I remember.
23
Q. Now, as a result of your historical research have
24 you formed an understanding of what that term cancer stick
25 meant during the 20th Century?
0159
1
A. Yes.
2
Q. Can you tell us what that is, sir?
3
A. It's rather obvious that a cigarette is in the
4 shape of a stick, the cigarette can produce lung cancer,
5 and other types of cancer. So, the association with cancer
6 stick clearly represents the association that is commonly
7 held by people between those two things.
8
Q. And as a professional historian who has spent
9 hundreds, if not thousands, of hours researching this
10 topic, what significance to you is there that Ms. Thurston
11 referred to cigarettes as cancer sticks?
12
A. It is significant, that term in particular, but I
13 could come up with other examples, the fact that that is a
14 form of slang, in which a clear association is being made
15 between cigarettes and cancer, is a reflection not only of
16 her awareness but of the community's awareness because if
17 that term was commonly used, it reflects the community
18 understanding of that connection.
19
Q. And is there significance to you regarding
20 Ms. Thurston specifically using that very term?
21
A. Yes.
22
Q. And what is that significance?
23
A. And that is a reflection that she understood that
24 connection.
25
Q. Now, sir, you are a professional historian you
0160
1 told us?
2
A. Yes.
3
Q. You are not a mind reader, is that right?
4
A. I'm not.
5
Q. You don't professionally read minds --
6
A. No.
7
Q. -- right? If there is case specific evidence
8 regarding Ms. Thurston's awareness of the risks of smoking
9 does that form part of the foundation of the professional
10 opinions that you will give at trial?
11
A. Yes.
12
MR. GARCIA: Form, speculation.
13
Q. You're not making any inferences about what
14 Ms. Thurston knew or believed at any point in time, is that
15 right?
16
A. I am basing my connection, as far as her
17 awareness, on documentation. Now, beyond that, I believe
18 it's very clearly and strongly established just on that
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]19 documentation, one could infer things, but I'm not counting
20 on that because the information is so direct. So we're
21 very fortunate to have so much information about her, that
22 a direct connection can be made just from the sources.
23
Q. And you're not coming to trial to make any of
24 those inferences about what she subjectively knew or
25 believed unless you have hard case specific evidence,
0161
1 right?
2
A. That's true, when I have a direct connection with
3 her, yes.
4
Q. And indeed do you plan to give an opinion at
5 trial regarding the likelihood that Ms. Thurston had seen
6 or been exposed to the information that circulated in and
7 among the public regarding the health risks of smoking?
8
A. That's true.
9
Q. Now, you were asked a lot of questions that
10 reference the term called preliminary opinions, do you
11 remember that?
12
A. Yes.
13
Q. Okay. Do you feel you have sufficient
14 information here today to render your opinions in this
15 case?
16
A. I do.
17
Q. Okay. And do you feel you have sufficient
18 information to provide your opinions at trial?
19
A. I have sufficient, I could harness the case more
20 with other information, but as I stand today I can tell you
21 that I have reached these conclusions. I don't want to use
22 the term ultimate conclusion, just to be safe, but the
23 conclusions that I've been able to reach today are with
24 most certainty exactly the ones that I plan to share in
25 court.
0162
1
Q. In fact, you have provided your opinions today
2 within a reasonable degree of professional historical
3 certainty, is that right?
4
MR. GARCIA: Form.
5
A. I would say certainty, yes.
6
Q. You were asked questions about Exhibit 7, which
7 is a source list. It includes some, what appear to be
8 hyper, printed hyperlinks to the Palm Beach Post, is that
9 right?
10
A. Yes.
11
Q. Now, there are in fact articles from the Palm
12 Beach Post on your Reliance List and you have reviewed
13 those, is that right?
14
A. That's true.
15
Q. And have you done any cross check to determine
16 whether the Palm Beach Post articles that appear in Exhibit
17 7 also in fact appear on your Reliance List which is
18 Exhibit 18?
19
A. I haven't done a cross check as such.
20
Q. So, some of those articles that appear -- strike
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]21 that. So, some of those Palm Beach Post articles that
22 appear in Exhibit 7 may also in fact appear on Exhibit 18,
23 which is the list of documents that you rely on to give
24 your historical opinions in this case, is that right?
25
A. Yes.
0163
1
MR. KEEHFUS: Let's go off the record.
2
(Discussion off the record).
3
MR. KEEHFUS: Go back on.
4 BY MR. KEEHFUS:
5
Q. One final question, sir. Have you reviewed
6 sufficient information and have you conducted a
7 professional historical analysis to the extent that you are
8 ready to give opinions at trial within a reasonable degree
9 of historical certainty?
10
A. Today, yes.
11
MR. KEEHFUS: That's all the questions I have.
12
REDIRECT EXAMINATION
13 BY MR. GARCIA:
14
Q. So, let me have them. What are your opinions
15 that you're going to provide at trial?
16
A. I believe I said those twice before. I can
17 repeat them. The first is that Ms. Juanita Thurston based
18 on information specific to her, but also based on
19 information of the community that surrounded her was aware
20 at an early age that smoking could be dangerous and she
21 received that information from a variety of sources. And
22 related to that, that the same holds true for information
23 that tobacco, nicotine smoking, could be habit forming and
24 addictive.
25
Q. Anything else?
0164
1
A. Those are the central conclusions.
2
Q. And are those the same central conclusions that
3 you have reached in every case in which you have been asked
4 to provide expert opinions?
5
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
6
A. Thus far --
7
Q. Yes.
8
A. -- that is the case.
9
Q. Well, if you have direct testimony to corroborate
10 the fact that Juanita was aware of the risks inherent in
11 smoking, do you agree with me that it really doesn't matter
12 what additional information was out there and being
13 disseminated to the community and reaching her household?
14
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
15
A. I don't agree with that.
16
Q. Why not?
17
A. Because the way historians operate is you
18 understand the person, if you're studying a particular
19 person, you get as much information about them, but you
20 also get information of the world around them. In this
21 case, information that would have reached her community,
22 and as a member of that community, reached her, besides
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]23 what I just said that there's direct testimony in the
24 depositions that she was aware.
25
Q. Okay. All right. Well, I hope that you can
0165
1 appreciate my frustration because I came here to find out
2 what it is that you're going to say and what evidence
3 you're going to present at trial. And perhaps I
4 misunderstood, but my impression upon hearing your answers
5 is that there is still information that you have to review
6 in order to determine what it is that you're going to say
7 specifically at trial.
8
So, now that I've gotten that out of the way, can
9 you tell me specifically and we can start with school
10 books, what specific school books Juanita saw or read to
11 support your opinion that the hazards of smoking were
12 communicated to her at school?
13
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
14
A. As I said earlier, I still need to correlate and
15 connect the many textbooks that I have looked at, and which
16 are included in the materials that you received today, with
17 her grades and when she was a student at any particular
18 time.
19
Q. Sir, what materials have I received today
20 regarding the textbooks that she was exposed to?
21
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
22
A. I just went over the list of materials.
23
Q. Right, the ones that you were rattling off, those
24 numbers, those are Juanita's textbooks?
25
A. No. That's a large set of textbooks.
0166
1
Q. Sure. That's what I gathered from your answer,
2 is that those are just textbooks that were out there. I'd
3 like to know which are the ones that Juanita was exposed to
4 --
5
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
6
Q. -- so, please tell me which ones they are.
7
A. Okay. As I said, I haven't made that final
8 determination, but in the materials that I provided to you
9 today, including the notes, there is information of which
10 textbooks were being used in Florida in particular years.
11 What I haven't done and I'm not ready to do now, because I
12 have to sit down, is establish a direct connection between
13 her year in school and the books that were being used.
14
Q. All right. Can you show me where in the
15 materials that you have provided to me today I can see the
16 names of the specific textbooks?
17
A. Yes, I can.
18
Q. Please do that for me.
19
A. That would be, I believe, in one of the exhibits
20 that includes her notes. I'm beginning to find examples,
21 precisely of what you're asking.
22
Q. All right. Then what I'd like to do, would you
23 first identify for me what exhibit you're looking at?
24
A. Exhibit 2.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]25
Q. Okay. And then if you're going to show me
0167
1 specific pages, then I'll put stickers on them, so that we
2 can refer to them at trial. Okay?
3
A. Okay.
4
Q. So, just as soon as you've identified a page,
5 hand it to me and we'll identify it. Thank you. All
6 right. So, you just handed me a page, which we'll mark as
7 2-A. And this page has the names of two books from what I
8 can gather, Health by Doing, and Health at Work and Play.
9 Did I read that right?
10
A. Yes.
11
Q. Okay. So, doctor, is the book Health by Doing,
12 which appears to be a fourth grade book, a book that I will
13 find in the three disks that I received that are connected
14 to the Reliance List?
15
A. I understand that it should be there.
16
Q. Okay. Well, can you look in the Reliance List
17 and tell me what is the item number for the book called
18 Health by Doing?
19
A. Reliance List, can you provide me with a date?
20
Q. Yeah, here you go.
21
A. I found that.
22
Q. Tell me what item that is on the --
23
MR. KEEHFUS: Can I ask, too, that we also
24
identify it by the Bates number, that will help, item
25
number and Bates number.
0168
1
MR. GARCIA: Those are interchangeable, aren't
2
they? Or are you referring to the Bates number as the
3
image number?
4
MR. KEEHFUS: Exactly.
5 BY MR. GARCIA:
6
Q. Okay. That's fine. Go ahead. And I'll look it
7 up here.
8
A. 334.
9
Q. Right. So, what's the Bates number?
10
A. ATB-000041.
11
Q. Okay. And is the other book listed on Exhibit
12 2-A a specific, a case specific textbook?
13
A. Health at Work and Play, the year is 1942.
14
Q. And what grade book is that?
15
A. Fifth grade.
16
Q. And how old was Juanita in 1942?
17
A. She was born in '34, so, in '42 she would be
18 eight.
19
Q. And was that book in use in Pompano Beach
20 elementary schools at the time that Juanita attended that
21 --
22
A. Again, I have not been able to make those
23 connections.
24
Q. All right. But you've established that this is a
25 Pompano Beach textbook?
0169
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]1
A. This is a textbook that was used, that was among
2 those adopted within the State of Florida.
3
Q. Is it a Pompano Beach textbook?
4
A. I haven't made that determination.
5
Q. Okay. As you sit here right now are you in a
6 position to rule it in or rule it out as a Pompano Beach
7 textbook?
8
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to form.
9
A. I cannot rule it out.
10
Q. I'm saying Pompano Beach, we're assuming that
11 that's where Juanita attended elementary school, correct?
12
A. Correct.
13
Q. Okay. And so, we would want to know what books
14 the Pompano Beach school system was using at the time,
15 correct?
16
A. I can tell you what were the options, at this
17 point I can't tell you the specific textbook.
18
Q. Okay. So, are the two books that we've
19 identified so far in Exhibit 2-A options available to the
20 Pompano Beach school system?
21
A. Yes.
22
Q. Okay. What other books, and you're looking at
23 Exhibit 2 still?
24
A. This is the next page.
25
Q. Okay.
0170
1
A. Growing Healthfully, 1942 is No. 419, and the
2 number is ATB-000665.
3
Q. Okay. What page were you looking at?
4
A. It's the second page within this document.
5
Q. We'll mark that as 2-B. Here you go. What other
6 books in your opinion were available to the Pompano Beach
7 school system?
8
A. Available -- the last one that I said was Growing
9 Healthfully?
10
Q. I think so.
11
A. Okay. Then, the next one on this list is The
12 Body and Health from 1936. And it has a number 333.
13
Q. Okay.
14
A. And the other enumeration is ATB-000040.
15
Q. Okay.
16
A. Next one, Be Healthy, 1938. It's No. 351, and
17 the other number is ATB-000045.
18
Q. Are those on Page 2-B as well, the book you just
19 mentioned?
20
A. Yes.
21
Q. Okay. Any others?
22
A. Now we're to the next page.
23
Q. All right. We'll mark that as 2-C.
24
A. First one on that page is Every Day Biology,
25 1946. The number is 453, ATB-000236.
0171
1
Q. Okay.
2
A. The next one, Problems in Biology. That one does
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]3 not appear here under the year 1940. It's possible that it
4 appears as another edition elsewhere in the document.
5
Q. Okay.
6
A. Life and Health, 1945, No. 443, ATB-000060. I
7 don't find that particular book under the year 1946.
8
Q. You're looking at the Reliance List and you don't
9 see that book on the Reliance List, is that what you're
10 telling me?
11
A. Yes.
12
Q. Okay. Is it in the other materials that you
13 provided to me here today?
14
A. It may appear here on this list, but not on the
15 actual list of materials because I believe I discarded that
16 book because the subject is chemistry.
17
Q. Okay. And there was nothing in there about
18 cigarettes or nicotine or --
19
A. I don't recall that.
20
Q. All right. Any other books?
21
A. Next page.
22
Q. Mark that as 2-D.
23
A. Okay. This one, this list may be a little bit
24 harder for me to find as quickly because they don't have
25 dates.
0172
1
Q. Okay. So, do you know for a fact if it's on the
2 Reliance List?
3
A. We would have to verify that. And it could be
4 done either manually by looking at the entire list again --
5
Q. Yeah.
6
A. -- or perhaps electronically.
7
Q. You mean just using a search feature?
8
A. Yes.
9
Q. All right. I don't know how to do that, so, how
10 do you suggest we identify where it is on the Reliance
11 List?
12
A. The only thing that comes to mind is doing one of
13 those two things, manually or a search.
14
Q. Well, do your best, see if you can find it.
15 What's the name of the book again?
16
A. There's a large number of them, there're 12 on
17 this page alone.
18
Q. Okay. All right. Give me one name.
19
A. One name, start at the top, Health Stories and
20 Practices.
21
Q. See, I just tried to search for it
22 electronically, and I got zero results on the Reliance
23 List.
24
MR. KEEHFUS: Well, that could be because of a
25
technological --
0173
1
MR. SMALL: I have a version that's searchable, I
2
can search right now. I can direct you to it.
3
MR. GARCIA: I'm trying to do it, but it may be
4
more operator error than anything.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]5
MR. SMALL: There're -- Health Stories and
6
Practices, there are three versions on the list,
7
different copyright dates, No. 279, 337, and 400.
8
MR. GARCIA: Okay.
9 BY MR. GARCIA:
10
Q. All right. What were we on? Were we on Page 2-C
11 there of that exhibit?
12
A. This is 2-D.
13
Q. 2-D, okay. Any other school textbooks?
14
A. On this list, yes. There are --
15
Q. Okay.
16
A. -- several others.
17
Q. How about on Exhibit 2 as a whole, beyond what we
18 have marked as Exhibit 2-D, that we haven't already
19 identified?
20
A. So, beyond this page?
21
Q. Yeah.
22
A. Helping The Body In Its Work.
23
Q. Is that on a page we haven't marked yet?
24
A. We have not marked that yet.
25
Q. Let me see that. Okay. We'll mark that as 2-E.
0174
1 Are all of the books on Exhibit 2-E books that were
2 available to the Pompano Beach school system?
3
A. If you allow me to take a look at that.
4
Q. Yeah.
5
A. These titles were found in a publication entitled
6 the Administration of Health Education and Physical
7 Education in Florida Schools, Suggestions for Planning
8 Health Education and Physical Education Programs for all
9 Grade Levels.
10
Q. Okay.
11
A. So, Page 2-E.
12
Q. Right.
13
A. Health -- you want me to read all of them or just
14 --
15
Q. No. Are they all books that were available to
16 the Pompano Beach school system?
17
A. Yes, that's my understanding.
18
Q. Okay. Let's go on to the next page.
19
A. The Body and Health.
20
Q. All right. And that appears on Page 2-F for
21 identification. Here you go.
22
A. Thank you.
23
Q. Any others?
24
A. On the following page, I can pick randomly,
25 Health Progress.
0175
1
Q. Okay. Mark that page as Exhibit 2-G. Is it your
2 testimony that all of the books on Exhibit 2-G were
3 available to the Pompano Beach school system?
4
A. They were found in a publication entitled State
5 Adopted Free Textbooks For Use In Elementary And Secondary
6 Schools, so the answer is yes.
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]7
Q. Okay.
8
A. There's the next page, which is one item.
9
Q. Okay. We can mark that as Exhibit 2-H. Okay.
10
A. And the one item on that page is Life And Health.
11
Q. Right. Any other books in Exhibit 2 that in your
12 opinion was available to the Pompano Beach school system?
13
A. Yes. There are several pages similar to the ones
14 that we've looked at.
15
Q. Okay. Is that what Exhibit 2 is, a list of
16 textbooks?
17
A. Exhibit 2 is --
18
Q. The entire thing?
19
A. -- these are notes.
20
Q. Right. Okay. Well, tell me all of the other
21 pages that identify textbooks that were available to the
22 Pompano Beach school system?
23
A. The next page is notes from Florida School
24 Bulletin, Volume 26, No. 4, June of 1954.
25
Q. Okay.
0176
1
A. Now, by this time, Juanita Thurston was no longer
2 in school. Do you want me to continue?
3
Q. No. I wish we would have been done by now,
4 honestly. I would like to know, then, what are the pages
5 then that encompass the universe of possibilities of school
6 textbooks that were available to the Pompano school system?
7 And we'll just make sure that we have an exhibit sticker on
8 each of the pages that include those books.
9
A. 2-A --
10
Q. Right. If we've already marked it, then, I think
11 we've already established that. I'd just like to put
12 stickers on those pages that we haven't already identified.
13
A. 1, 2, 3, 4 -- these mention textbooks.
14
Q. Okay. And what was our last exhibit, H? 2-H?
15 Anyone?
16
A. 2-H.
17
Q. Great. All right. Well, I have marked as
18 Exhibits 2-I, 2-J, 2-K and 2-L, the four pages that you
19 gave to me. So put them in the stack there. So, are the
20 exhibits then that we have marked as 2-A to 2-L encompass
21 the universe of the textbooks available to the Pompano
22 Beach school system?
23
A. There are more.
24
Q. There are more. Okay. Well, let's keep marking
25 those pages.
0177
1
A. We skipped one page that doesn't have information
2 on textbooks.
3
Q. Then we won't mark it.
4
A. And the next one, it's a two page item --
5
Q. Okay.
6
A. -- entitled Florida State Adopted Textbooks Final
7 Draft.
8
Q. Give those pages to me and we'll identify them as
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]9 2-M and 2-N. Are there any other pages?
10
A. That's it.
11
Q. All right. Then, let's put that back together.
12 And help me understand then within those universe of
13 possibilities of textbooks that we have marked as subparts
14 to Exhibit 2, what you need to do then is do some
15 additional work to help narrow down that list as far as
16 what you would present at trial?
17
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
18
A. Yes, I need to do additional work.
19
Q. Okay. Do you have everything at your disposal
20 here and now in order to do that work?
21
A. I believe I do, it would take me quite a bit of
22 time --
23
Q. How much time?
24
A. -- to do that.
25
Q. How much time is it going to take you?
0178
1
A. Well, I have to be able to get into the mode of
2 analysis for that and, you know, I could do that. But
3 then, I want to be certain that the analysis that I do is
4 correct, so I would have to double check, I don't know, it
5 could be 20 minutes, it could be half an hour. I don't
6 want to rush it.
7
Q. All right. Well, would you prefer to do that
8 work when you're in the mode and you don't feel rushed to
9 do it?
10
A. I would prefer that, yes.
11
Q. All right. And do you believe that once you do
12 that work that you will be able to provide me with an
13 analysis that includes a specific list of those textbooks
14 that were actually in use in Pompano Beach during the
15 relevant time that Juanita was in school there?
16
A. I can tell you what the books that had been
17 adopted by the system were from among which the school
18 districts would select, so I can certainly narrow down this
19 longer list.
20
Q. Okay. All right. Well, my objective here today
21 was to come and learn and to the extent that your
22 disclosure, Exhibit 9, said that you were going to provide
23 specific opinions about Juanita Thurston, that's one of the
24 things that I'm interested in finding out. So, when
25 between now and the time of trial will you be able to
0179
1 provide me with that information?
2
MR. KEEHFUS: Object to the form.
3
A. I could do it as early as tomorrow or the day
4 after tomorrow, by Monday, say.
5
Q. Okay. What day is it today, Wednesday?
6
THE REPORTER: Yes.
7
MR. GARCIA: Yes, thank you. All right. Well,
8
that's what I'd like to do, so, I don't have any
9
further questions. And I reserve the right to
10
continue this deposition when you are prepared to give
file:///C|/...s%20Martínez-Fernández/Stanford/Legal/2012.08.15%20Deposition%20Luis%20Martinez-Fernandez,%20MD%20THURSTON.txt[26/04/2016 18:06:37]11
me that specific information. Okay.
12
THE WITNESS: Okay.
13
MR. KEEHFUS: And for the record, I'm not
14
agreeing to that at this time.
15
MR. GARCIA: Because that's what I want, right?
16
MR. KEEHFUS: But I don't have any further
17
questions.
18
MR. GARCIA: Thank you for your time, sir. It's
19
nice to meet you.
20
THE WITNESS: My pleasure.
21
MR. KEEHFUS: We're off the record.
