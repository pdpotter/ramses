1	stipulations?
2	MR. THORNE: Yes.
3	MS. V ALLE JOS - NICHOLS: Yes.
4
5	LOUIS KYRIAKOUDES,
6	being first duly sworn, was examined and
7	testified as follows:

9	THE COURT REPORTER: Would you like
10	to read and sign your deposition?
11	THE WITNESS: I would.
12	EXAMINATION
13	BY MR. THORNE:
14	Q. Good morning, Dr. Kyriakoudes. Is
15	it doctor or professor?
16	A. Professor.
17	Q. I'm David Thome and I'm here for
18	Philip Morris to ask you some questions
19	about the Bowden case. Are you prepared to
20	answer questions about that case and give us
21	your opinions?
22	A. Yes, I'm prepared.
23	Q. Okay. We're here in Gulfport,
24	Mississippi; correct?
25	A. That's correct.
0008
1	Q. Okay. And you have been retained
2	as an expert in the Bowden case?
3	A. That's correct.
4	Q. Okay. And who hired you to be an
5	expert in this case?
6	A. The Avera and Smith law firm.
7	MR. THORNE: Is that how you
8	pronounce it, Dawn, by the way?
9	MS. V ALLE JOS - NICHOLS: It's
10	actually Avera.
11	MR. THORNE: Avera. I've always
12	wondered. I hear people pronounce it both
13	ways.
14	MS. V ALLE JOS - NICHOLS: Yes.
15	Q. And Dawn Vallejos-Nichols --
16	MR. THORNE: Did I pronounce
17	Vallejos correctly?
18	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Very good.
19	Q. --is here next to you; correct?
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. And she represents the plaintiffs?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. And have you been in contact with
24	any other law firms that represent the
25	plaintiffs in this case?
0009
1	A. No, I have not, not since I signed
2	on to this case.
3	Q. All right. And you understand that
4	this is an Engle case; correct?
5	A. That's correct. That's my
6	understanding.
7	Q. And you've been involved in other
8	Engle cases?
9	A. I have testified in other cases,
10	yes, Engle cases.
11	Q. And let's talk a little bit about
12	your experience testifying in Engle cases.
13	How many trials have you testified in?
14	A. Just Engle?
15	Q. Just -- let's start with Engle,
16	yes, please.
17	A. I don't have that number
18	immediately at mind. I'll have to count
19	through, if I could take a moment to do
20	that.
21	Q. Let me see if I can help and you
22	can tell me whether I'm forgetting any.
23	A. Okay.
24	Q. You've testified -- you have a
25	trial preservation deposition; correct?
0010
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. And that was in 2009?
3	A. Yes. Yeah, I guess it would have
4	either been -- you probably have the dates.
5	I can't remember if it was in December of
6	2008 or in January of 2009, but right around
7	the winter.
8	Q. And, you know, you probably have
9	this on your CV, don't you?
10	A. I do on my CV, which I brought the
11	most updated version in response --
12	Q. Feel free to look at that, if you'd
13	like, if that would be helpful.
14	A. Okay. Good.
15	Q. It isn't a memory contest.
16	A. Yeah. But I do keep track of my
17	trials on my CV.
18	Q. Okay.
19	A. And, you know, I didn't put the
20	preservation deposition on here because it
21	didn't --1 don't know. It seemed like a
22	different kind of thing. But that was one.
23	So we'll start there. That's one.
24	Q. Okay.
25	A. In fact, let me just count.
0011
1	Q. Okay.
2	A. I have 20 either trial or
3	deposition cases on my CV, and it looks like
4	I've not entered in the most recent, which
5	was McEniry from last month. So I think 21
6	is about right.
7	Q. Okay.
8	A. I'll have to go back and add that
9	in there. So 21.
10	Q. And Haldeman, is that on there?
11	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Haldeman is
12	McEniry.
13	MR. THORNE: Is McEniry. The same
14	case. Okay. I've just always referred to
15	it as Haldeman.
16	A. Oh, you know what, that's how I
17	have it listed as well. So it's actually
18	20.
19	Q. So it's up to date?
20	A. Yeah, it's up to date.
21	Q. Good enough.
22	A. Sorry about that confusion.
23	Q. So McEniry and Haldeman, that was
24	your most recent trial testimony?
25	A. That was in September. That's
0012
1	correct.
2	Q. September. And that was also an
3	Avera and Smith case; is that correct?
4	A. That was with Avera and Smith law
5	firm, that's correct.
6	Q. What other cases have you worked on
7	with their law firm?
8	A. I worked on a case called
9	Alexander.
10	Q. Let me just help you with one. Did
11	you work on also a case called Hetzner with
12	them?
13	A. And Hetzner, yes.
14	Q. Okay. Any others that you can
15	think of that you've worked on with that
16	firm?
17	A. I believe that's just it with this
18	firm. That's my sole recollection.
19	Q. So Alexander, Hetzner, and
20	Haldeman/McEniry are the three cases you've
21	worked on with Avera and Smith?
22	A. Right. And then this would be the
23	fourth.
24	Q. This would be the fourth. What
25	about with the Wilner firm? What cases have
0013
1	you worked on with the Wilner firm?
2	A. The Wilner firm I testified at
3	trial for two cases in the last few years.
4	One is called Jewett and the other was
5	called Frailey. The Frailey case. And I
6	believe both Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds
7	were both defendants in those case.
8	Q. Phillip Morris was a defendant
9	until the first day of trial. That was
10	where I was going to get a chance to meet
11	you first.
12	A. Okay. I don't -- you know, I don't
13	keep up with that level of detail.
14	Q. I understand. Yes. But Mr. Wilner
15	decided to dismiss us on the first day of
16	trial.
17	A. Okay. I --
18	Q. You didn't miss us, though,
19	apparently.
20	A. No. Sorry.
21	Q. That's okay. All right. So as I
22	understand it in reading some of your prior
23	depositions, you have what I will describe
24	as generic opinions that you give from case
25	to case regardless of who the plaintiff is;
0014
1	is that correct?
2	A. That's correct. You know, the
3	history of the tobacco industry and its
4	actions doesn't change from case to case
5	because that's not dependant upon the case.
6	That's just the history.
7	Q. And do you have any new opinions in
8	that regard since the Haldeman/McEniry case?
9	A. No, I have no new opinions.
10	Q. Okay. And then you have opinions
11	that are, let's say, more case specific or
12	geared to this case; correct?
13	A. That's correct.
14	Q. All right. And so those are the
15	type of opinions that I think I'm going to
16	spend my time asking you questions about
17	today.
18	A. Okay.
19	Q. Sound good?
20	A. That sounds good.
21	Q. Okay. Let's talk a little bit
22	about what I think you're not going to
23	testify about so we can get that out of the
24	way. You're not going to talk about the
25	cause of Mr. Bowden's death; correct, or
0015
1	what caused it?
2	A. No. No, I'm not going to offer any
3	medical diagnoses like that.
4	Q. No state of the art regarding his
5	disease of lung cancer or any of his
6	conditions?
7	A. No. No, I'm not going to give that
8	testimony either.
9	Q. You're not going to offer any
10	opinions about what the company knew about
11	any of the diseases that he had?
12	A. About his specific disease?
13	Q. Correct.
14	A. Him as an individual as opposed to
15	the general knowledge of -16 Q. Right.
17	A. No, I'm not going to give any
18	opinions as to what the companies knew about
19	his individual health.
20	Q. And as I understand it, you're not
21	planning on giving any opinions about what
22	Mr. Bowden's specific awareness was about
23	the risk of smoking, what he knew?
24	A. Yeah. I can't really -- you know,
25	that's a complicated question and I'll
0016
1	clarify. I can't -- you know, I only have
2	the evidence in the case, which is
3	deposition evidence and some material items.
4	I can't get into his head and offer like a
5	psychological evaluation of his risk
6	assessments or what have you. I can only
7	rely on the objective data in the case as
8	reported in the testimony. I don't know if
9	that clarifies it.
10	Q. So do you intend to give opinions
11	about what various witnesses said about
12	Mr. Bowden's awareness of the dangers of
13	smoking and when he knew that it was
14	dangerous for him to smoke?
15	A. No, I don't anticipate -- no, I
16	don't anticipate giving that testimony at
17	all. Not in this case.
18	Q. Is there something in between that
19	you plan on testifying about? I just want
20	to make sure I cover all of your opinions.
21	A. Right. Yeah. No, I don't think
22	so. Because really, my understanding, and
23	I'll offer this explanation and I think this
24	will be helpful and efficient, is that my
25	testimony is going to be along the lines of
0017
1	what I -- in terms of the direct exam, the
2	same kind of questions that were asked in
3	the McEniry/Haldeman case about the history
4	of the advertising and marketing efforts as
5	a historical phenomena and those areas.
6	Q. Okay. And you're not going to give
7	an opinion about whether specific
8	information or lack thereof caused
9	Mr. Bowden to begin smoking; correct?
10	A. At initiation, no. You know, like
11	many people in the 1940s of his cohort bom
12	in 1925, he began smoking as a teenager.
13	Tobacco manufacturers sought to target that
14	age group. It was central to the business.
15	I'll give that testimony.
16	You know, as a general rule, the
17	public understanding of -- particularly
18	among younger people at this time, that was
19	quite limited as to the harms of
20	cigarettes. There just wasn't a general
21	amount of knowledge in terms of the mind of
22	the public. Does that clarify?
23	Q. Yes, it does.
24	A. Okay.
25	Q. And I'll ask you a few more
0018
1	questions about that later, but why don't we
2	just postpone that and we go through areas
3	that you're not going to testify about.
4	You're not going to say in your testimony
5	that he saw one particular ad that caused
6	him to smoke or caused him to switch to
7	another brand, are you?
8	A. A particular specific ad? Well, I
9	don't think I can identify a particular
10	specific ad, but I will testify that in
11	general in issues marketing and advertising
12	and promotional activities did influence
13	both the initiation of smoking and his brand
14	choice over time and cigarette type, if I
15	could say type of cigarette choice over
16	time.
17	Q. And are you going to be able to
18	give specific examples of the case of
19	Mr. Bowden about any advertisement or
20	promotion or marketing campaign that
21	affected him and how it affected him?
22	A. Well, I will Review the marketing
23	campaigns of the major brands or -- let me
24	rephrase that, of the brands that he smoked,
25	which were the major brands by and large of
0019
1	the day when he smoked them.
2	Q. Just to make sure that we're clear,
3	are you saying then that you're not going to
4	be able to tie it to a specific ad or
5	marketing that caused him to make a decision
6	to switch? Do you have any case-specific
7	information in the record that would allow
8	you to be able to do that?
9	A. Well, there are some case-specific
10	items. Ms. -- and I'll give a couple of
11	examples, if that's okay.
12	Q. That's fine. Sure.
13	A. Mrs. Bowden, his wife, talks about
14	how he received promotional items, of which
15	there are photographs of these in the record
16	that I've seen, from cigarette
17	manufacturers. Mrs. Bowden also testifies
18	that, you know, he saw light cigarettes. He
19	understood light cigarettes to be a
20	healthier, safer alternative. And so, you
21	know, I intend to talk about that --
22	Q. Okay.
23	A. -- and testify on that. And that,
24	again, fits with the larger patterns of both
25	the industry knowledge as to why smokers
0020
1	were turning to lights, low tars,
2	low-nicotine cigarettes and, even before
3	that, filters.
4	Q. Anything else case specific that
5	you can think of as you sit here right now
6	on that topic?
7	A. As I mentioned in my expert report,
8	I believe it's Tammy Zier also makes a
9	statement that he understood lights and low
10	tars to be a healthier type of cigarette.
11	Q. Okay. Anything else?
12	A. That's what comes to mind.
13	Q. Okay. Is it safe to say that
14	you're not going to give an opinion that
15	Mr. Bowden saw or heard anything from a
16	tobacco industry representative? Let me
17	rephrase that question. That's poorly
18	worded.
19	Is it safe to say that you're
20	not -- that you're not going to give an
21	opinion that Mr. Bowden heard any statements
22	or talked to any tobacco industry
23	representative?
24	A. I'm not aware of any evidence in
25	the case that he spoke with say, for
0021
1	example, a high official from the Tobacco
2	Institute or other executive level
3	individuals on a one-to-one personal meeting
4	basis; but, you know, the larger point is, I
5	think involved here, that the tobacco
6	industry and its agents like the Tobacco
7	Institute and its representative
8	organizations were disseminating information
9	that had both the intention and effect of
10	creating doubt and uncertainty, particularly
11	in most smokers as to the truth of the
12	matter that cigarettes actually do cause
13	lung cancer and other serious diseases; and
14	it will be my testimony that millions of
15	smokers, like Mr. Bowden were affected by
16	this; that, in fact, the entire national
17	debate over smoking was significantly shaped
18	by the tobacco industry who then started to
19	create doubt and uncertainty even while
20	possessing full knowledge of the truth of
21	the matter internally in their secret
22	documents.
23	Q. And I understand that that's your
24	overall kind of generic opinion, and I guess
25	I'm trying to point to, do you have any
0022
1	case-specific evidence that you can point to
2	in the record that Mr. Bowden specifically
3	saw any particular statement from TI, the
4	Frank Statement, or any other statements
5	from the tobacco industry?
6	A. I can't put him in front of a
7	particular statement. I do know that he did
8	read --1 believe there's a reference to
9	Life Magazine, but there is no like -- if
10	you're asking for like at a specific point
11	in time and space to put a particular
12	statement in his hand, in front of him as if
13	I was looking over his shoulder, no, I can't
14	do that.
15	Q. So, for example, no witness in this
16	case recalled him ever saying I saw the
17	Frank Statement; correct?
18	A. That is -- no. No. But it doesn't
19	have to be -- it doesn't have to be that,
20	because the Frank Statement was disseminated
21	many ways and, again, shaped the debate and
22	the understanding.
23	And the Frank Statement has two
24	items of significance. One, it is the
25	beginning of the public launch of
0023
1	essentially the conspiracy; and secondly,
2	the Frank Statement is repeated on
3	television and on the radio and in the news
4	media in many ways. And so it's amplified,
5	not just through the newspaper, 448
6	newspapers, but also through the media as
7	people talk about it and cover it on the
8	news. Everything from the Today Show to,
9	you know, see it now in Edward R. Murrow's
10	documentary and others.
11	So it does have impact on the
12	nation. And to the extent that Mr. Bowden
13	is, you know, a member of the general
14	public, you know, he can't help but be
15	touched by these statements.
16	Q. And I understand that that's your
17	general opinion, but what I'm just trying to
18	confirm is that you saw no evidence in the
19	record that any witness heard from
20	Mr. Bowden or talked to Mr. Bowden that he
21	had read the Frank Statement?
22	A. I didn't see that in the record.
23	If it's in there, I missed it.
24	Q. And that's true for any other
25	statements by tobacco companies or their
0024
1	officials, there's no evidence in the record
2	that Mr. Bowden saw or read any particular
3	statement?
4	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
5	the form.
6	A. Well, he -- no, he indicates that,
7	you know, awareness of the advertising, and
8	those would be statements. So to that
9	regard, yeah, there is some evidence of
10	that.
11	Q. Okay. Fair enough. Beyond
12	advertisements?
13	A. Yeah. No. He's been dead since
14	1994. If it's in there, I missed it.
15	Q. And I think we've covered that
16	area. Let's see. You're not going to offer
17	any opinion about when Mr. Bowden first knew
18	that cigarettes could be addictive; correct?
19	A. For him personally, no, I don't
20	anticipate giving that testimony in this
21	case.
22	Q. Let's talk a little bit about --
23	well, first of all, this case is brought by
24	Gloria Bowden; correct?
25	A. That's correct.
0025
1	Q. And I take it you have not ever
2	spoken to or met Mrs. Bowden?
3	A. No, I have not met Mrs. Bowden nor
4	any of the family members -- any of the
5	Bowden family members.
6	Q. You've read some of their
7	depositions, though; correct?
8	A. I have read, yes, depositions.
9	Q. And let's talk about when you were
10	first contacted about this case.
11	A. (Witness nodding head.)
12	Q. When is the first contact where
13	someone called you and asked you if you
14	might be willing to give testimony in this
15	case?
16	A. I got an e-mail, and I'll give you
17	the exact date. I got an e-mail on March
18	22nd.
19	Q. March 22nd of this year?
20	A. Of 2013. And I brought that e-mail
21	with me. And, in fact, Ms. Vallejos-Nichols
22	sent the e-mail asking if I would serve on
23	this particular case.
24	Q. And what information did they
25	provide to you about the case?
0026
1	A. Over time, after that e-mail, I
2	indicated obviously that I would serve.
3	That's why I'm here. They provided a large
4	amount of information, perhaps more than I
5	needed.
6	Q. I can imagine.
7	A. They seemed to have kind of sent
8	the whole file my way, but that included
9	depositions with immediate family members.
10	Obviously, Mrs. Bowden's multi-volume
11	depositions that occurred over the course of
12	two -- you know, 2012, but then again a
13	recent, I guess we'd call it, follow-up in
14	August, Ms. Barbara Dampier's. You know,
15	basically the surviving children. And then
16	from outside of there, other, you know,
17	spouses, ex-spouses, children, and other
18	people that, from my perspective, were
19	moving father and father afield. And then
20	lots of documents, a lot of them not
21	relevant to my testimony, medical records
22	and things that I don't normally, and have
23	not in this case, incorporated into my
24	evaluation and opinions.
25	Q. Okay. Do you have an e-mail that
0027
1	has the list of all of the documents that
2	you received or is this based on memory?
3	A. This is based on memory. And my
4	understanding is is that, in phone
5	conversations, the Avera Smith law firm was
6	providing you with a list of everything they
7	sent me.
8	MR. THORNE: Do I have that list,
9	Dawn?
10	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Yeah. That
11	was part of what we sent to you on either
12	the disc and through Hightail.
13	MR. THORNE: I just wanted to make
14	sure we got the complete list.
15	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Yes.
16	MR. THORNE: We'll take a look at
17	that when we have a break to make sure we've
18	got it.
19	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Well,
20	they're listed, but all of them were
21	attached to the depos and everything that we
22	sent. So it's not like a --1 don't think
23	it's an individual list of what we --
24	everything that we sent you.
25	Q. So you received medical records but
0028
1	you didn't review them?
2	A. I opened up a file and saw that it
3	was medical records and shut the file.
4	Q. Did you receive the complaint?
5	A. The complaint's in there. I didn't
6	read it.
7	Q. Did you receive interrogatory
8	responses?
9	A. Those I did receive. And it is my
10	practice to read those because those often
11	contain information directly relevant to my
12	analysis and opinions.
13	Q. Now, this is a case with a lot of
14	depositions that were taken, and certainly
15	Mrs. Bowden's deposition went on for quite a
16	period of time because she couldn't sit for
17	long periods. Did you take notes to keep
18	all of this material straight?
19	A. No. No. You know, I don't -- most
20	of the subject of the depositions, you know,
21	involved matters that are not relevant to my
22	opinions; issues of, you know, financial
23	situations; medical issues; and other things
24	that are not -- just not relevant.
25	So my practice has always been to
0029
1	go first to the index of the depositions,
2	which have essentially a concordance, and
3	read those carefully and look at things like
4	cigarette brands, key terms like quitting
5	and then going back to the document and, you
6	know, reading it for those issues.
7	Q. All right. So I take it then from
8	your response that you don't have any notes?
9	A. No, I don't have any notes.
10	Q. Okay. Did you mark up the
11	depositions at all?
12	A. No. They were all electronic.
13	Q. Did you take notes electronically?
14	A. No. Not for this case, no.
15	Q. Let's talk about any meetings that
16	you may have had with Dawn or anybody at
17	Avera and Smith. Have you had any phone
18	conversations with them?
19	A. Yes. I had a phone conversation
20	earlier this week.
21	Q. And when did that take place?
22	A. That was Tuesday morning.
23	Q. And what did you discuss on the
24	telephone conversation?
25	A. That was a phone call between me on
0030
1	one end and Ms. Vallejos-Nichols and Mr. Rod
2	Smith on the other end, and it was just kind
3	of a general review of issues in the case.
4	So, you know, I basically explained to them
5	what my understanding of the issues were.
6	It was probably about 30 minutes.
7	And then there was earlier phone
8	meetings. I prepared a short affidavit for
9	this case, which I submitted in October, and
10	we discussed that in the earlier meeting, a
11	phone call. I don't remember the exact date
12	of that, but it would have been either late
13	September or very early October.
14	Q. And did you prepare that affidavit
15	or did they prepare it for you?
16	A. I told them what I wanted to say in
17	it, but they actually typed it up and I kind
18	of -- and I, you know, did it that way.
19	Q. Did you make any edits to it?
20	A. I did. I did make an edit to it,
21	yes.
22	Q. What did you change?
23	A. Well, it needed a conclusion,
24	paragraph number 12, so I added that. I
25	also added paragraph number 10. I wrote
0031
1	that.
2	Q. Any other changes you recall making
3	to the affidavit?
4	A. I think I put in County of Hancock,
5	you know, on the signature page, which is
6	where I live, right above my name.
7	Q. I see it. Any other corrections
8	that you made or changes you made?
9	A. That's all I recall.
10	Q. Okay. And when you spoke to
11	Mr. Smith and Ms. Vallejos-Nichols earlier
12	this week, what did they tell you about the
13	case?
14	A. Not much. The main thing or the
15	one thing they did tell me was that
16	Mr. Smith indicated to me that he
17	anticipated that the direct exam in this
18	case would follow along the same subject
19	areas and subject items as the McEniry case,
20	and so he would be asking me, again,
21	questions about, you know, the history of
22	marketing and distribution of the cigarette
23	and those subjects that I covered in
24	September.
25	Q. Any other communications you've had
0032
1	with any lawyers in connection with this
2	case?
3	A. No other attorneys on this case.
4	Q. What about non-attorneys?
5	A. Or anyone, yeah, or any people even
6	employed or touched by a law firm.
7	Q. Any other materials that you
8	received that you intend to rely upon in
9	forming your opinions other than what you've
10	told me about?
11	A. No.
12	Q. And you mentioned that you've got
13	some e-mails with you. Maybe the easiest
14	thing to do at this point is to mark your --
15	the deposition exhibit and maybe we can just
16	run through it and you tell me what you had
17	that's responsive.
18	MR. THORNE: Mark this as Exhibit
19	No. 1.
20	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Is that the
21	notice?
22	MR. THORNE: The notice.
23
24	(Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit No.
25	1 was marked for identification and same is
0033
1	attached hereto.)
2
3	Q. So, Professor Kyriakoudes, you went
4	through this list; correct?
5	A. I did. Yes, I've gone through this
6	list.
7	Q. And this is not new to you. You've
8	seen this list before of items to bring to
9	your deposition?
10	A. That's correct.
11	Q. And so we won't go through each
12	one, but maybe you can identify documents
13	that you have -- or let me phrase it a
14	different way. You can tell us which of
15	these requests you have documents that
16	pertain to them.
17	A. Okay. Sure.
18	MR. THORNE: Do you have another
19	copy there? Mine is for some reason missing
20	pages.
21	A. You had asked for my current CV.
22	Q. Okay.
23	A. That's item number nine, and so
24	here it is (indicating).
25	Q. All right. And let me just ask you
0034
1	about the CV while we've got it. Is there
2	anything new on this CV since your
3	deposition was taken in Haldeman?
4	A. That was in 2012, wasn't it?
5	Q. It was in 2012, and I can't
6	remember the exact date. Maybe the summer
7	of 2012?
8	A. Yeah. Yeah, there would be new
9	items since it's a whole year and then some
10	has gone by.
11	Q. Okay. Can you let me know what's
12	new, if possible?
13	A. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
14	Q. Do you need this back?
15	A. Sure. I think for your purposes,
16	the main new thing is I gave a talk. Yeah.
17	I gave a talk, and I'll give the name of
18	that talk, and also this touches on
19	responsiveness to schedule A. The name of
20	the talk is "Disputed Science, the Tobacco
21	Industry, the Press, and the Public"
22	presented before the Eighth World Congress
23	of Science Journalists, Helsinki, Finland,
24	June 25, 2013.
25	The other new item, "Tobacco
0035
1	Industry Research on Smokers' Beliefs and
2	Behavior," National Conference on Tobacco or
3	Health, Kansas City, Missouri, August 16,
4	2012.
5	And my gut feeling is that the
6	McEniry deposition was in March of 2012, and
7	if that's the case, there's one other
8	tobacco talk, "What Does the History of the
9	Cigarette Epidemic in the American South
10	Tell Us About Global Tobacco Control in the
11	21st Century?" Policy History Conference,
12	June 9, 2012, Richmond, Virginia.
13	Q. Okay. Let's start with the first
14	one that you did in Finland. When -- remind
15	me again when that presentation was, because
16	I don't have it in front of me. I can't
17	write that fast.
18	A. All right. That was in June of
19	this year.
20	Q. June. All right. And did you
21	prepare any papers for that?
22	A. I prepared a PowerPoint and I
23	brought those PowerPoint slides.
24	Q. All right. And is that something
25	where you volunteered to speak or did they
0036
1	call you and ask you to come give a
2	presentation?
3	A. I was actually invited to this, and
4	they generously paid the substantial airline
5	fair to Helsinki. So it was an invited
6	presentation.
7	Q. And is there any kind of agenda
8	that you have for this presentation --1
9	mean for this conference?
10	A. I don't have that with me, but it
11	is available on the web. And I can describe
12	it to you.
13	Q. Okay.
14	A. It was on science and journalism,
15	and most of the presentations -- there was
16	some presentations on tobacco. Most of the
17	presentations were on issues of global
18	climate change and reporting on medical --
19	medical issues and things like that. It was
20	a conference of professional science
21	journalists.
22	Q. And you mentioned that there were
23	other presentations on tobacco?
24	A. I think there were. If you look at
25	the -- there may have been one or two. I
0037
1	didn't attend them, so I can't really
2	recall.
3	Q. Do you recall who spoke?
4	A. No. And I don't recall anybody
5	attending that would be from the American
6	tobacco control community. I did meet in
7	the reception a couple of people from
8	Malaysia and Indonesia who I believe had
9	made presentations and told me they had
10	spoken on that. And there was also, I
11	believe, presentations from the Finish
12	Cancer Society and groups like that.
13	MR. THORNE: Why don't we mark this
14	as Exhibit No. 2, and that being the
15	presentation that he gave in Finland.
16
17	(Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit
18	Nos. 2 and 3 were marked for identification
19	and same are attached hereto.)
20
21	MR. THORNE: We're going to mark
22	rather Exhibit 2 as his CV and Exhibit No. 3
23	being the presentation that Dr. Kyriakoudes
24	gave in Finland.
25	THE WITNESS: That's correct.
0038
1	Q. Let's go to the next one, which is
2	the presentation that you gave in Kansas
3	City, Missouri.
4	A. Yes. That was at the National
5	Counsel on Tobacco or Health sponsored by
6	the United States Department of Health and
7	Human Services and I was -- that was just a
8	regular conference. I was, you know,
9	invited to give that talk and spoke for a
10	half hour on the use of social science and
11	social science research in tobacco industry
12	marketing and smoker research efforts.
13	Q. And I think I understand from the
14	Haldeman deposition that you're preparing an
15	abstract for that meeting?
16	A. That's right. And I have a
17	PowerPoint for that, yeah, and there's an
18	abstract on the website of the conference.
19	I thought I had already given those over in
20	another deposition, so I was thinking that
21	that was the most -- you know, the only one
22	that I haven't supplied. But let me --1
23	didn't bring it with me but I'll happily
24	supply it immediately.
25	Q. That would be terrific.
0039
1	A. But right now, if you would like
2	for me to explain it to you briefly, I can.
3	Q. That would be terrific. When you
4	get that, why don't we mark that as Exhibit
5	No. 4 to the deposition.
6	A. Okay.
7
8	(Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit No.
9	4 will be produced to attornyes.)
10
11	Q. And if you want to explain it to
12	me, that would be terrific.
13	A. Sure. This is an area that I'm
14	interested in in terms of research. There's
15	been lots of research on what the tobacco
16	industry knew in terms of medical issues
17	related to smoking and that's been -- you
18	know, a lot of people do that. I'm more
19	interested in the way in which the industry
20	turned towards social scientists both within
21	marketing organizations, pollsters, surveys,
22	focus group leaders, and also within the
23	universities. They did -- and independent
24	researchers as well and how they used those
25	techniques of social science to understand
0040
1	the social and behavioral aspects of
2	smoking.
3	And I made kind of a broad general
4	presentation. I began with early 1950s
5	surveys, American Tobacco, Philip Morris, in
6	the early '50s looking at where they went
7	from survey data and then I moved forward
8	and looked at in the 1980s the work of
9	Sherwin Feinhandler, who was an
10	anthropologist who had a consultantcy that
11	did some work for the tobacco industry on
12	the -- kind of the social and cultural
13	significance of smoking in American life;
14	and I reported, you know, those findings and
15	related them to the course of the smoking
16	and health debate.
17	My principal conclusion was that in
18	this area of understanding, these documents,
19	this general social science research is
20	important for tobacco control people to
21	study and understand because it illuminates
22	also some of the techniques and the thinking
23	and activities of the industry.
24	Q. Did you find any activity that the
25	tobacco industry used in terms of social
0041
1	science that other industries don't use?
2	A. No. No. Yeah. The industry is
3	drawing upon a broader -- the tobacco
4	industry is drawing upon a broader body of
5	expertise that resides within marketing,
6	public opinion survey, and other social and
7	behavioral research organizations, and, you
8	know, many of the organizations that they
9	use, J. Walter Thompson, McCann-Erickson
10	have multiple clients; and these techniques
11	are available to other product
12	manufacturers. So, no, it's part of a
13	broader -- deepening and broadening of the
14	ability of marketers to kind of understand
15	the public and its behavior.
16	Q. Let's go next to the presentation
17	you gave in Richmond. Remind me when that
18	was?
19	A. That was in June of 2012.
20	Q. June of last summer. Okay. And
21	tell me a little bit about that
22	presentation.
23	A. That one was really focusing on the
24	South, and the title was, you know, "What
25	Does the History of the South Have to Say
0042
1	About Global Tobacco Control?"
2	And in that one, I simply made the
3	point -- it was a very --1 spoke for less
4	than --1 was only allotted 15 minutes.
5	Q. That's not much time to give an
6	introduction, huh?
7	A. That's right. That's a certain
8	kind of conference format, I guess. And I
9	presented the idea that if you look at the
10	data, the South actually is less likely to
11	smoke until really the 1960s and the 1970s
12	and then it rapidly becomes -- now has some
13	of the highest smoking prevalences.
14	And I basically used the model of
15	the South as an underdeveloped region within
16	a highly developed nation and gave some
17	explanations for undersmoking among rural
18	Southerners in the 1930s, '40s, and '50s,
19	poverty, lack of access to markets. They
20	certainly used tobacco but not cigarettes.
21	And then I focused on some of the ways in
22	which the tobacco industry focused
23	specifically on southern markets to build up
24	their business, sponsorship of things liked
25	the grand national NASCAR races, which
0043
1	later, you know, came to be known as the
2	Winston Cup. There are a number of
3	regionally specific marketing and market
4	research efforts.
5	Q. Do you have any papers or
6	PowerPoints in connection with that
7	presentation?
8	A. No. That one -- that one, I don't.
9	So I don't have anything that I could really
10	give you. It was really a kind of -- a talk
11	that I had given previously and which I have
12	supplied to you previously actually into the
13	same time line.
14	Q. Okay.
15	A. So you have a -- while I didn't
16	have the PowerPoints, I essentially took the
17	ideas in the PowerPoints and just spoke
18	about them in a kind of informal way.
19	Q. Anything new in this presentation
20	that wasn't in your previous one?
21	A. No. That one was pretty much an
22	adoption of a talk I had given at the
23	University of North Carolina under the same
24	title, and I've supplied those slides a
25	number of times.
0044
1	Q. Anything else on your CV that might
2	be of interest?
3	A. That's it. Oh, no. Promoted to
4	full professor.
5	Q. Congratulations.
6	A. I forgot about that one.
7	Q. That's important. All right.
8	Let's go back to the deposition notice and
9	attachment. What other documents did you
10	identify that were relevant to one of the
11	requests here?
12	A. You had asked for e-mails -- e-mail
13	communications, and they are between me and
14	Ms. Vallejos-Nichols. I have no other
15	e-mails from Avera and Smith employees or
16	attorneys or representatives.
17	Q. Okay.
18	MR. THORNE: Let's mark this as
19	Exhibit 5 to the deposition, and that's
20	e-mail communications with Avera and Smith.
21
22	(Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit No.
23	5 was marked for identification and same is
24	attached hereto.)
25
0045
1	Q. These largely look to me like
2	scheduling e-mails; is that correct?
3	A. Yes, that's right. Scheduling,
4	availability and --
5	Q. Go ahead.
6	A. The very last e-mail in that stack,
7	I think they're in reverse order, is the one
8	where they contacted me first about the
9	case.
10	Q. So it appears, at least from this
11	e-mail dated March 22, 2013 from Dawn to
12	you, that an earlier expert disclosure had
13	listed you as an expert to testify in this
14	case. Were you aware of that?
15	A. No. But --1 wasn't but they asked
16	me if I wanted to continue on the case.
17	Q. So Mr. Wilner never contacted you
18	and asked you if you would be a witness in
19	this case?
20	A. No. No.
21	Q. What other documents do you have
22	with you that are responsive to any of the
23	requests?
24	A. I have my copy of the affidavit
25	that I submitted. This is the final copy.
0046
1	I just brought this with me.
2	Q. All right. I have a copy, too.
3	We'll mark that as No. 6, and you can keep
4	your copy if you'd like to.
5	A. Okay.
6
7	(Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit No.
8	6 was marked for identification and same is
9	attached hereto.)
10
11	Q. Any other documents that you have
12	that are responsive to the request --
13	A. That's it.
14	Q. --to your deposition?
15	A. That's it.
16	Q. Let me just clarify a couple of
17	things to make sure that I've got
18	everything. Did you receive a letter or a
19	CD that contained all the documents in this
20	case?
21	A. They were delivered to me through
22	an FTP server called You Send It, or they
23	just changed the name to Hightail. They
24	were posted to that and then I downloaded
25	them.
0047
1	Q. So you download them basically from
2	the sky?
3	A. The cloud, yes. The cloud, yes.
4	Q. All right. So they weren't
5	physically sent to you?
6	A. No.
7	Q. You received them via e-mail?
8	A. No. I prefer electronic copies.
9	The volume of paper can be overwhelming and,
10	you know, why tear down the trees.
11	Q. Fair enough. All right. Let's
12	talk for a second about your time that
13	you've put into this case. There have been
14	a lot of depositions, I'm sure, for you to
15	read. How much time have you spent working
16	on this case so far?
17	A. Yeah. Actually, this one I put in
18	a good amount of preparatory time, more than
19	might be considered previous practice. I
20	really started focusing on this when I --
21	after I came back from the McEniry case,
22	which would have been mid-September, and
23	kind of worked on it first by reviewing the
24	depositions and assessing the universe of
25	documents that took me a number of hours,
0048
1	certainly at least -- at least six hours,
2	and then focusing on reading and reviewing
3	with more care Mrs. Bowden, Barbara
4	Dampier's, I forget how to say the last
5	name, Tammy and Nancy, the daughters. I
6	also looked Ted, Theodore, Bowden's
7	deposition and then just kind of making sure
8	I looked at least initially at every file
9	that I received.
10	That was the function of two
11	things. One, I just wanted to see what was
12	in there, but the other was it was difficult
13	to tell from the file names of what was a
14	deposition and what was an attachment to a
15	deposition or an exhibit or just a document.
16	So it was a little bit confusing.
17	I had to sort out what I had. So
18	it's --1 probably put in total at least,
19	you know, three full days. Three full days
20	of work.
21	Q. When you say "three full days," how
22	many hours are you referring to in the day?
23	A. 24. You know, about 24 hours.
24	Q. 24 hours total?
25	A. Yeah.
0049
1	Q. In addition to the six hours you
2	told me about previously? So you said the
3	first task, as I understand it, was to
4	initially figure out what you had and
5	quickly review things?
6	A. Yeah.
7	Q. And then you reviewed them in more
8	detail?
9	A. Yeah. Approximately 30 hours.
10	Q. About 30 hours. Have you provided
11	any invoices to Ms. --
12	A. No. I asked over the phone when
13	they first asked me to serve on the case, I
14	asked for my standard retainer of $3,500,
15	and they did send that to me. And that is
16	a -- you know, billed against the time that
17	I put in the case.
18	Q. So how much of the $3,500 retainer
19	have you used up so far?
20	A. Well, all of it and then some.
21	Because this has -- there's more material to
22	weigh through in this case than in previous
23	cases.
24	Q. All right. And so do you intend to
25	then submit a bill to them for your
0050
1	remaining time?
2	A. Yeah. At the end of --1 mean,
3	this case comes to trial in February --
4	early February. I anticipate arriving and
5	testifying perhaps approximately the second
6	week of February, and after that's done,
7	I'll kind of just bill them then.
8	Q. Is there any work after this
9	deposition and before the trial that you
10	anticipate doing to prepare for your
11	testimony?
12	A. Outside of, you know, conversations
13	with the attorneys as a kind of preparatory
14	to the direct exam, I don't anticipate any
15	additional work. As I understand this,
16	really what you're -- perhaps, if I may
17	assume what you're getting at, is additional
18	research or additional document review that
19	might result in new opinions and those kind
20	of things, I don't anticipate that.
21	Q. Okay. And if you do do any of
22	that, will you please let Dawn know so that
23	we can be notified?
24	A. Yes. And if -- again, if that
25	should happen, I'll certainly make myself
0051
1	available at a time convenient.
2	Q. Thank you. What percentage of the
3	time do you estimate of the 30 hours that
4	you spent reviewing depositions?
5	A. I -- it's hard to say on that.
6	Certainly most of it because the other
7	files, which are numerous, tend to be like
8	one-page documents. Even to the extent some
9	of them are handwritten notes, it looks like
10	notes that deponents brought with them. I
11	also reviewed photographs of marketing-
12	related items or themed merchandise, maybe
13	that's a better term for it, in the
14	possession of Mr. Bowden. But those went
15	pretty quickly. You know, you just kind of
16	look at those and take them in. Going
17	through the depositions takes more time.
18	So I would say, you know, --1
19	would say three-quarters of the time is
20	reviewing the depositions and maybe one
21	quarter of time kind of assessing and also
22	working on the affidavit.
23	Q. How long did it take you to prepare
24	the affidavit?
25	A. Not long. As I indicated in the
0052
1	earlier question, I discussed with them over
2	the phone the affidavit, indicating what I
3	had seen in the depositions that would be
4	relevant to kind of advertising and
5	marketing reliance, and then they sent me a
6	draft and I added essentially the two
7	paragraphs I indicated earlier. I mean,
8	total, including time to kind of look out
9	the window and think and contemplate, two
10	hours.
11	And then, oh, yeah, it was kind of
12	a pain to get the thing signed. I forgot
13	about that. I wasn't counting that in the
14	review time, but sometimes it's hard to find
15	a notary, and I was under some deadline,
16	too. I got it in, I think, a day or two
17	before it had to be filed. So I had to
18	drive to get it signed.
19	Q. Yeah. We're all familiar in trying
20	to find a notary. That's not always fun.
21	A. Well, you know, I ended up --
22	Q. And deadlines.
23	A. Yeah, the deadlines. It's been a
24	busy semester for me with a lot of other
25	things going on. So it's been -- you know,
0053
1	these deadlines come up and you've got to
2	make them.
3	Q. Well, the 2012 tax season
4	officially closed for all of the late filers
5	in October. So my question for you is, now
6	that you've filed your returns, how much
7	money do you think you made doing this type
8	of litigation -- tobacco litigation in 2012?
9	A. Oh, in 2012?
10	Q. Yes.
11	A. Yeah, I actually did get mine in on
12	time back in April. Well, I did two cases
13	and I had a couple of depositions, too. So
14	about $40,000 total.
15	Q. And what is that in terms of
16	percentage of your overall income?
17	A. In -
18	Q. For 2012?
19	A. 2012 my overall income. Oh, let me
20	think. That's about a third. I would say
21	33 percent, approximately.
22	Q. And then for 2013, how many times
23	have you testified in 2013?
24	A. I've had just one trial that I did
25	back in September and that's it.
0054
1	Q. Any other cases that you've been
2	reviewing to provide your opinions in
3	depositions?
4	A. Yes. I've been contacted by
5	another law firm called Lieff Cabraser.
6	They're probably familiar to you. And they
7	asked me to submit an expert report, and I
8	composed an expert report and submitted
9	that. I think they had to file that the
10	first of November and I submitted it that
11	week.
12	Q. Do you recall how many cases you've
13	submitted expert reports for to Lieff
14	Cabraser?
15	A. I don't. And I -- you raise an
16	issue. I need to get back with the
17	attorney, whose name is Robert Nelson,
18	that's the person I've interfaced with, and
19	actually find out just so that I know. But
20	I don't know.
21	Q. I think your deposition is coming
22	up in those cases. Are you aware of that?
23	A. The other thing -- they asked me to
24	supply dates. They said we had to have
25	dates in November, and I said, well, you
0055
1	know, there's not much of November left.
2	It's a really busy month, Thanksgiving and
3	all that. So I believe I gave them the 14th
4	and the 15th, but I have not heard from them
5	that it's been scheduled.
6	Q. Well, keep those dates open because
7	I think they have been scheduled.
8	A. Okay.
9	Q. Since they haven't told you, I'll
10	let you know that I think those dates are
11	going forward.
12	A. Okay.
13	Q. And so I've provided some helpful
14	information for you today in addition to
15	asking your opinions.
16	A. And I'll make the observation.
17	Q. I can't be here for that, though.
18	So you'll have another crew.
19	A. You know, often you -- and when I
20	say "you," the attorneys all around know
21	much more about what's going on in terms of
22	these issues than I do. You know, I
23	interact on these very kind of narrow areas
24	and then move on to, you know, my day job
25	teaching school.
0056
1	Q. Fair enough. Do you recall how
2	many reports you had to sign?
3	A. I signed one.
4	Q. You signed one?
5	A. Yeah. And I submitted that
6	electronically. And by "that," I mean, I
7	typed up a report with, you know, just kind
8	of like --1 put my own title on it with my
9	name on it as if it was a paper I had
10	written, and then I put on the back just a
11	signature line, not notarized, just my hand
12	signature, scanned, e-mailed the electronic
13	copy of the report as a Word document and
14	then scanned that last signature page on my
15	home scanner and then e-mailed that as a
16	JPEG or PDF. I can't remember which one.
17	Q. So I take it from what you just
18	told me that there wasn't a caption for a
19	particular case on the top of your report?
20	A. No. It was --1 didn't think I
21	needed to do that. I wasn't supplied with
22	that. They didn't kind of take it and
23	reformat it and send it back to me, which
24	sometimes that does happen.
25	Q. So I take it from what you
0057
1	described to me that in those cases you have
2	not reviewed any case-specific information
3	about the particular smoker?
4	A. That's correct. This is a -- kind
5	of a generic report, and, you know, I have a
6	standard report that I've used over the
7	years that every time I go back to I kind
8	of, you know, review it and make a change or
9	make an edition, and I did that for this one
10	as well.
11	Q. So how much time do you estimate it
12	took you to prepare those reports for Lieff
13	Cabraser?
14	A. I'm not exactly sure right now. I
15	hadn't reviewed that for this deposition.
16	But I did put some time into that because I
17	did add some sections and review that. So
18	certainly, you know, a number of hours. I
19	will say it came -- they asked me to submit
20	it rather late in the process. I think they
21	informed me sometime around the 20th or 21st
22	of October that they wanted this and it had
23	to be in by November 1st, which in my world
24	that's a pretty fast turnaround for college
25	teacher work and given that I have many
0058
1	other responsibilities. But I did put quite
2	a bit of time into it, but I'm not sure how
3	many hours.
4	Q. When you say "quite a bit," is it
5	more than 10, more than 20? I'm just trying
6	to get an idea.
7	A. Oh, yeah. No. I think I, over the
8	course of maybe two or three times, kind of
9	stealing time from here and there, probably
10	put about 10 hours total. You know,
11	everything, kind of proof reading and
12	getting it all ready to go.
13	Q. Any other cases that you're
14	reviewing, preparing reports for in
15	connection with the Engle litigation?
16	A. Not at that stage. I understand
17	that a case which I've previously been
18	deposed for called the Snow case is
19	scheduled for trial in the spring as well.
20	That is with an attorney named Manny Socias,
21	and I was deposed for that some years ago,
22	and I guess it was on the schedule and off
23	the schedule. You know, I don't keep up
24	with that. But that's kind of coming up.
25	And that's all I'm aware of for me that I'm
0059
1	planning for.
2	Q. Any new plaintiffs firms contact
3	you about any new cases they want you to get
4	involved in?
5	A. That's -- no. No. That's it.
6	That's all.
7	Q. Can you give me an estimate of
8	about how much you have -- let's do it this
9	way, how much time you've put in in 2013 in
10	Engle tobacco litigation?
11	A. 2013. Probably approximately one
12	full week's of work, a 40-hour week, but not
13	all at once. You know, spread out here and
14	there. On the weekends; you know, at night.
15	Q. When you say one full week, is it a
16	24-hour day, 8 hours a day?
17	A. No. A 40-hour week.
18	Q. A 40-hour week?
19	A. 40 hours, approximately.
20	Q. And how much time did you spend in
21	the Haldeman case preparing to testify and
22	going to testify?
23	A. Oh, yeah. I didn't include that.
24	40 hours would be for the things that we
25	just talked about. The Haldeman, that case
0060
1	was going to be tried last spring, and so I
2	had that spring probably three substantive
3	telephone meetings leading up to discussing
4	kind of the direct exam in the spring of
5	2013. I would say that was approximately 8
6	hours total.
7	Q. And were those 8 hours spent
8	talking to Mr. Smith?
9	A. Yeah. Basically, you know, long
10	phone conversations with Mr. Smith and the
11	other attorneys in the firm. Often, you
12	know, me on the phone and then them in a
13	room, because I don't know exactly who's in
14	the room.
15	Q. You don't know who's there. Fair
16	enough.
17	A. Yeah. And then probably about the
18	same amount of time kind of picking up where
19	we left off. I don't remember why, but
20	apparently the case got knocked off the
21	docket in some way or another in the spring
22	and then was rescheduled and did go to trial
23	in September, and so I had at least two
24	substantive conversations then where we
25	basically reviewed the direct exam.
0061
1	Q. And so was that another about 8
2	hours preparing again when it went in
3	September?
4	A. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe a little bit
5	less. Maybe more about 6 hours, because we
6	had kind of done a lot of that work in the
7	spring and didn't need to redo all of that.
8	Q. And then you had, what, a full day
9	of testimony actually at trial?
10	A. Yeah. Well, actually, it was a
11	little bit more than that. I was in Florida
12	for three days.
13	Q. Three days. And so you billed for
14	those three days; is that correct?
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. And how much do you bill for a
17	complete day?
18	A. At that time, $3,200 for a complete
19	day. I've raised my rate a little bit. I'm
20	not sure if that's reflected in this case,
21	but I'm transitioning to a socio cost-of -
22	living adjustment, and I've raised it to
23	$450.
24	Q. So that would be $3,600 a day then?
25	A. Very good. Yes, that's right.
0062
1	Q. I know that because I have a check
2	for you.
3	A. Oh, I see. I thought you were just
4	good at that. Well, you may still be good.
5	It figures.
6	Q. Well, we'll decide that later. All
7	right. So that's for the Haldeman case.
8	You had three days -- here is what I'm
9	getting at. I think you've got more time
10	than the 40 hours that you've told me about,
11	so I'm trying to get to the math without --
12	A. Let me clarify that. The 40
13	hours -- and I wasn't clear maybe when I
14	kind of followed up on this. The 40 hours
15	applies for the case -- for the
16	non-McEniry/Haldeman case. I wasn't -- you
17	know, we had been talking about these
18	preparatory cases that are still in process
19	and I was thinking along those lines. I've
20	put about 40 hours into those cases plus the
21	time that we put in for Haldeman.
22	Q. And for all of the time that you
23	did in 2013, are you billing $450 an hour or
24	$400 an hour?
25	A. Well, I haven't submitted any bills
0063
1	for the preparatory. I haven't been paid
2	for any of this preparatory work that we've
3	described. And then since I've just raised
4	my rate 12 and a half percent essentially
5	and I haven't raised it since 2008,1 was --
6	the Haldeman/McEniry case was billed at $400
7	an hour.
8	Q. And what about the work in this
9	case, did you bill at 450, because that's
10	what I wrote you a check for?
11	A. Yes. I have raised it, yes, and
12	they've agreed to that. And again, just the
13	idea behind that is that it's been that way
14	for five years and there's been inflation
15	and so I've just essentially added kind of a
16	cost-of-living adjustment to that.
17	Q. And I assume that's true for Lieff
18	Cabraser who hired you, it's going to be at
19	the rate of $450 an hour for the federal
20	cases you've talked about?
21	A. Right. That's correct. And I
22	actually haven't -- you know, I'm learning
23	things in the deposition. I need to contact
24	them and work -- and finalize those
25	arrangements for payment and the like.
0064
1	Q. Well, tell Robert I'm sorry if I
2	let the cat out of the bag.
3	A. Well, this is next week. So --
4	Q. But my understanding is -- and I'm
5	not involved but my understanding is that
6	those are dates that -- at least that have
7	been offered.
8	A. Okay. Well, they did say November.
9	I said I preferred December, but that's
10	probably more information than you need to
11	know.
12	Q. All right. Let's talk about the
13	depositions that you reviewed, and maybe one
14	easy way to do that is to look at your
15	affidavit.
16	A. Uh-huh.
17	Q. And I also brought with me just in
18	case, I can pull it out, I think the cover
19	sheets for some of the depositions, if I can
20	find that.
21	A. Well, maybe we can go forward and
22	if there's a need for that, we can --
23	Q. Okay. Let's talk about -- first of
24	all, there were a lot of depositions taken
25	in this case; correct?
0065
1	A. There are.
2	Q. Mrs. Bowden, Gloria Bowden's
3	deposition in and of itself was fairly
4	lengthy?
5	A. Yeah. My recollection is five
6	initial volumes and then a follow-up
7	deposition. I may be off by one, but that's
8	my recollection.
9	Q. And did you --1 think that
10	deposition exceeds maybe even a thousand
11	pages.
12	A. Yes. That would -- if you include
13	both -- all the depositions, yeah, it does
14	go over a thousand, because I think the
15	volume five ends up in the 800s or something
16	and then the follow-up one is a couple
17	hundred more.
18	Q. Some of that is an index to the
19	deposition, but in any event, it's a long
20	deposition. Did you read it in its entirety
21	or did you use the key word index to find
22	stuff that you thought might be important to
23	your opinions?
24	A. I did the latter. I start --
25	again, because as I mentioned earlier,
0066
1	there's a lot of material in there that's
2	relevant to other parts of the case that
3	don't involve my opinions and my expertise
4	and so I start with the -- like review of
5	the index. And in the case of these that
6	came in the form Adobe PDFs, but the index
7	items are hyper-linked. So you actually
8	just click on the index item and it takes
9	you right to that item in the documents. So
10	it's very efficient and very quick.
11	Q. So, in essence, you did somewhat of
12	a key word search where you saw a word that
13	interested you and you hyper-linked it and
14	went to that portion of the deposition and
15	then read those portions; is that correct?
16	A. That's right. And then I kind of
17	-- you know, you have to get the context.
18	So I go backward and forward and that -- at
19	some point, you know, I might get -- like
20	Barbara Dampier, I guess is how you say it,
21	D-A-M-P-I-E-R, you know, her deposition was
22	particularly rich in terms of descriptions
23	of Mr. Bowden's early initiation into
24	smoking, for example. And so, you know, I
25	kind of got into those and I kind of read
0067
1	more. I don't just look at the key words
2	but kind of use the key words to take me to
3	the document and then read around and learn
4	that way.
5	Q. Okay. And is that true, the way
6	you -- the methodology that you used, is
7	that the methodology you used for reviewing
8	all the depositions in this case?
9	A. Yes. Although, I will say that the
10	depositions that I identified in the report
11	are the ones that I focused the most
12	intently on.
13	Q. And how did you pick those six
14	depositions to focus most intently on?
15	A. Essentially, because those were the
16	family members -- surviving family members
17	that were closest to Mr. Bowden, his wife
18	and his children, and his cousin, who was
19	there when he was young.
20	Q. And cousin, she's a first cousin;
21	right? So not a cousin in the sense of the
22	words. It's one removed; correct? Let me
23	see if I can figure out the exact family
24	relationship. I had to make a chart to keep
25	track of it myself.
0068
1	A. It's a big family.
2	Q. Mr. Bowden was the nephew of
3	Barbara Dampier's dad?
4	A. That's correct. She initially
5	referred to herself, this was kind of funny,
6	as a double cousin, which I don't know what
7	that means, but they do clarify that
8	subsequently in the deposition.
9	Q. Yes.
10	A. But the key point for her is that
11	she has firsthand observations of Mr. Bowden
12	before he entered the military and she
13	describes the smoking situation of his
14	youth.
15	Q. I'll talk to you about that in a
16	minute, but let me just figure out, first of
17	all, which ones -- depositions you read. So
18	we got the six that you've identified here
19	in your affidavit; correct?
20	A. Uh-huh.
21	Q. And then there are others. Maybe I
22	can just run through them and you can tell
23	me whether or not you read them, and
24	hopefully, I've got a complete list. But
25	we've got, of course, Mrs. Bowden. We've
0069
1	talked about her.
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. We've got Theodore Bowden, Nancy
4	Winters, and Tammy Zier who are the
5	children.
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. And Theodore, he goes by Ted, he's
8	an adopted son; correct?
9	A. That's correct. And the oldest.
10	Q. The oldest. Correct. Then we've
11	got some other fact witnesses who were
12	deposed. We've got Scott Baker who was a
13	nephew. Did you read his deposition?
14	A. I really --1 looked at that and
15	skimmed it and didn't rely on it.
16	Q. What about Shane Baker, did you
17	review his deposition? He was also a
18	nephew.
19	A. Right. No, I didn't rely on that
20	either.
21	Q. What about Gary Cooke? He's the
22	former son-in-law who was married to Tammy.
23	Did you read his deposition?
24	A. No. I didn't rely on that either.
25	Q. Barbara Dampier, who was a cousin,
0070
1	did you review or rely upon her testimony?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Oh, that's right. We talked about
4	her. I apologize.
5	A. That's okay.
6	Q. Kay Hartley who was a niece?
7	A. No, I didn't. I didn't rely on
8	that one.
9	Q. Did you read it?
10	A. I opened it up, skimmed it briefly,
11	and shut it down. I focused on the ones
12	that -- his sister and his kids.
13	Q. What about Christopher Marvin who
14	was a grandson, did you read his deposition?
15	A. No, not with any care. I didn't
16	rely on that one.
17	Q. What about Ceceila Ramsey who was
18	married to Mr. Bowden's son, Michael, did
19	you read her deposition?
20	A. No. This seems to be getting far
21	afield from the things that I was interested
22	to know and I didn't review that.
23	Q. Jacqueline Stokes, did you review
24	her deposition? She was the former spouse
25	of Mr. Bowden. They were married in 1945.
0071
1	A. I did review that and didn't
2	seem -- it didn't seem to provide me any
3	information that I needed.
4	Q. When you reviewed her deposition,
5	did you note that she didn't recall that
6	Mr. Bowden was a smoker?
7	A. I did note that, which that was an
8	unusual item. I would call that an outlier,
9	given a long period of time. It seems it
10	was a relatively brief marriage. And the
11	clear evidence is that he was not just a
12	smoker but a heavy smoker. I thought that
13	one was -- you know, it didn't seem to tell
14	me anything.
15	Q. So in your mind, you discounted
16	that testimony?
17	A. Oh, yeah, I did. Yeah.
18	Q. You mentioned you read Yvonne
19	Tillman; correct?
20	A. Yes. That's his sister. Yeah, I
21	did read that.
22	Q. How much did you study that
23	deposition?
24	A. Oh, to the same that I did say, for
25	example, you know, Ted Bowden. I went
0072
1	through the index and reviewed it and put a
2	couple of hours into it.
3	Q. All right. And then Lisa Hoff who
4	was a niece.
5	A. Yeah. I really didn't --1 stayed
6	away from the more distant relatives just
7	because it didn't seem -- they didn't seem
8	to provide the kind of information I needed
9	for this case and for my opinion.
10	Q. Would that be true of Debra White
11	as well? She was also a niece.
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. I think that I've covered all the
14	depositions, but you've certainly told me
15	the ones that you focused on; correct?
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. So if I missed one, that's one
18	that, since you don't have it listed in the
19	six in your affidavit, you didn't spend a
20	lot of time reviewing or relying upon?
21	A. That's correct. You're good to go.
22	Q. Okay. The other documents that you
23	refer to that you reviewed a lot of those
24	were exhibits to the deposition; correct?
25	A. That's correct.
0073
1	Q. Did you review the exhibits to
2	depositions of people who you didn't rely
3	upon their deposition?
4	A. No, I didn't. Not at all.
5	Q. And I take it from what you've told
6	me already that you haven't done any
7	independent research on any newspapers that
8	Mr. Bowden may have read during his
9	lifetime?
10	A. No, no special research for this
11	case. My recollection is the only one that
12	came up was the Florida Times Union, the
13	Jacksonville paper, and I've not done any
14	special research into that paper for this
15	case.
16	Q. So he lived in various places like,
17	for example, in Broward County for a period
18	of time, Duval, in the Jacksonville area.
19	You didn't do any independent research in
20	those counties about different information
21	that was available about smoking and the
22	risks of smoking?
23	A. No. No. That's right. He lived
24	in the Jacksonville area, largely on the
25	southwest side of townish, you know,
0074
1	generally, and did seem to move around a
2	bit; but no, no special research in those
3	areas. I've not been out to Jacksonville to
4	go to archives.
5	Q. And no intention of doing that?
6	A. No, I don't have any intention of
7	doing that.
8	Q. Okay. Do you want to take a
9	break?
10	A. Let me take just a quick restroom
11	break and then we'll move forward.
12
13	(The time is 10:20 a.m.)
14
15	(Whereupon, a short break was
16	taken.)
17
18	(The time is 10:29 a.m.)
19
20	Q. All right, Dr. Kyriakoudes. Let's
21	move forward and talk a little bit about
22	what you gleaned from the depositions about
23	Mr. Bowden and his life.
24	A. Okay.
25	Q. And, of course, his smoking
0075
1	history. And I'll just kind of lead you
2	through this and you can tell me if there's
3	any additional things, but I thought we
4	would do it a little bit in chronological
5	order. How does that sound?
6	A. That sounds like a good idea.
7	Q. Okay. So he was bom in 1925;
8	correct?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. And he was bom in the Jacksonville
11	area?
12	A. Yes. Yes, Jacksonville.
13	Q. And he's one of seven siblings?
14	A. That's correct. A big family.
15	Q. Yeah. And did you understand from
16	reading the depositions that most of the
17	family members said that cancer ran in their
18	family?
19	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
20	the form.
21	A. Well, I did notice that --1 mean,
22	I'm not a medical person. So that's not
23	something I paid attention to. In the
24	interrogatories, there is a listing of cause
25	of death of a number of his relatives and
0076
1	there was an indication that some had died
2	of various types of cancer, but I made no
3	note of the type, and that doesn't fit into
4	my opinions, or figure into my opinions is
5	more accurate.
6	Q. All right. So Mr. Bowden in about
7	1937 drops out of school in about the
8	seventh grade. Did you see that?
9	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
10	the form.
11	A. Well, I might have missed that. My
12	understanding was that he dropped out of
13	school to join the military a little bit
14	later than that, during World War II; and if
15	there was an earlier period where he had
16	dropped out, I might have missed that.
17	Q. Okay. Let's talk a little bit
18	about his enlistment in the military. You
19	mentioned before that his distant -- second
20	cousin -- how do we describe that?
21	A. Well, she -- cousin, you know, is
22	fine enough.
23	Q. Double cousin?
24	A. Double cousin. I mean, you know,
25	neighbor. You know, I mean, I'm not -- for
0077
1	me, the consanguinity, that is the blood
2	relationship, doesn't figure into my
3	opinions. What does figure in, that she is
4	there, essentially a neighbor, during his
5	youth, hanging out at the house on the porch
6	smoking. Well, observing him smoke.
7	Q. Well, let's talk a little bit about
8	her. She's nine years younger than
9	Mr. Bowden; correct?
10	A. I believe so, yes. That's right.
11	Q. And so at the time period where she
12	testified that she recalled Mr. Bowden
13	smoking before he went into the military,
14	she was -- he went in the military about age
15	17. So she would have been, you know, age
16	6-
17	A. Yeah.
18	Q. -- during that time period;
19	correct?
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. So she would have been very young?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. And she also had -- Mr. Bowden also
24	had a sister who was her same age; correct?
25	A. Yvonne, that's correct.
0078
1	Q. And you read Yvonne's deposition?
2	A. I did, that's correct.
3	Q. And Yvonne doesn't remember her
4	brother smoking before he went in the
5	military; correct?
6	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
7	the form.
8	A. Yes. Well, yeah, she doesn't
9	testify to that. Barbara does.
10	Q. Okay. So I'm correct that she
11	doesn't recall her brother smoking before he
12	went into the military?
13	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
14	the form.
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. And then Yvonne, to the extent her
17	memory is accurate, only remembers one
18	occasion in which she recalls Mr. Bowden
19	smoking, as she described it, on his
20	parents' porch; correct?
21	A. Yeah. What she describes is
22	essentially his returning on leave, I guess
23	you would describe it military leave, and
24	that he was smoking on the porch. That's my
25	recollection.
0079
1	Q. Just --1 just want to make sure
2	we're clear on the record. So Barbara's
3	memory is it's when he's on leave that he
4	was smoking on the porch?
5	A. No. I thought that was Yvonne that
6	said that. And then Barbara indicates it's
7	before he goes into the military.
8	Q. And what I was getting at,
9	Barbara's memory is on one occasion she
10	believes that she saw him smoking before he
11	went into the military on her parents' --on
12	his parents' porch; correct?
13	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
14	the form.
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. Dawn just wants you to give enough
17	time for her to get her objection in. Do
18	you recall from Yvonne Tillman, the sister's
19	deposition, that she said that it was a
20	no-no to smoke in her parents' house?
21	A. Yeah. I mean, they seemed to have
22	gone outside to do it, although there was
23	certainly plenty of smoking going on.
24	Q. But doesn't Ms. Dampier remember
25	that there were adults there on the porch,
0080
1	possibly even Mr. Bowden's father present,
2	when he recalls him smoking -- when she
3	recalls Mr. Bowden smoking?
4	A. Well, they report that the elder
5	Bowden, Willie Bowden, Sr., was a pipe
6	smoker, and was it Agnes, the mother, also
7	smoked cigarettes? I interpret that to mean
8	that, you know, they went outside. You
9	know, the porch being outside.
10	Q. Doesn't it strike you, though, as
11	strange that Mrs. Bowden -- excuse me.
12	Doesn't it strike you strange that Yvonne
13	Tillman says that her parents said no
14	smoking for the kids at the house and yet
15	her double cousin seems to recall him
16	smoking at age 17 —
17	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
18	the form.
19	Q. --on the porch with his parents?
20	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Sorry.
21	Object to the form.
22	A. No, it doesn't. These are events
23	now that are 70 years -- over 70 years. 70
24	years in the past and people relying on
25	memory of, you know, kind of everyday
0081
1	behavior. So, no, it doesn't strike me as
2	odd. It was -- and what we know about the
3	context of America's smoking culture and in
4	the 1930s and the 1940s, we know the history
5	of the course of smoking initiation and
6	prevenance. It all -- it doesn't strike me
7	as odd.
8	Q. So Ms. -- for example, Ms. Dampier
9	could be off about her memory when she was
10	six-years-old that happened 70 years ago
11	about when she saw Mr. Bowden smoking?
12	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
13	the form.
14	A. Barbara may be off, Ms. Yvonne also
15	might be off. Either way. It's pretty
16	clear that, you know, once he's in the
17	military he does actually become a smoker.
18	He enters the military actually just before
19	he turned 17 and a few months, and that's
20	good enough for my purposes for my opinions.
21	Q. So let's talk about his entry in
22	the military. That's when Mrs. Bowden says
23	that her husband told her that he became a
24	regular smoker; correct?
25	A. That's correct.
0082
1	Q. And he, as she said, joined the
2	military when he was age 17?
3	A. I think it —
4	Q. Somewhere in there?
5	A. I think it's, if I'm recalling and
6	I don't often recall this particular
7	levelty, but I thought his birthday was like
8	in December, and I think he's --1 did look
9	at his military record. I seem to recall
10	that he joined that fall, maybe -- yeah,
11	that fall. So~
12	Q. Regardless of when he joined, --
13	A. Yeah, it was about 17.
14	Q. -- Mrs. Bowden's memory from
15	discussions with her husband is that he said
16	he became a regular smoker when he joined
17	the military?
18	A. Yes. Which, again, is a very
19	common -- as a matter of historical smoking
20	prevenance, a very common situation,
21	particularly for that cohort of people who
22	served during the World War II period.
23	Q. And he joined in 1942?
24	A. That's correct, yes.
25	Q. And he was in the military for
0083
1	about four years until about 1946 when he
2	was honorably discharged; correct?
3	A. That's correct.
4	Q. And when he gets out after his
5	first tour of duty, that's when he marries
6	Ms. Stokes; correct?
7	A. That's right. His first marriage.
8	Q. And he also, after he gets out,
9	completes his high school education?
10	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
11	the form.
12	A. I seem to recall that, yes.
13	Q. Fair enough. Let me rephrase the
14	question, because it was poorly worded. He
15	leaves the military in 1946. One of the
16	things he does is he goes back and finishes
17	his high school education?
18	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
19	the form.
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. And at that point in time, that's
22	when he -- strike that. About 1948 he
23	re-enlists in the Marines; correct?
24	A. That's correct. He has a second
25	term of service.
0084
1	Q. And he's in the Marines for maybe
2	three years; correct?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And part of that time where he's in
5	the Marines he actually spends some time in
6	jail while he's there; correct?
7	A. Yes. That comes out in his wife's
8	deposition. That's a -- he has, I guess, a
9	court martial and has to spend about a year,
10	maybe a year and a half in prison.
11	Q. And he's charged, I think, with
12	embezzlement and theft and improper dealings
13	with a recruit?
14	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
15	the form.
16	A. I can't remember the exact specific
17	thing, but it seemed to revolve around kind
18	of petty financial mismanagement.
19	Q. And so he's honorably discharged in
20	1951 from the Marines after that service?
21	A. Yeah. He leaves. I don't know if
22	it was necessarily an honorable but --
23	Q. Dishonorable?
24	A. It might have been, yeah. But I'd
25	have to say I haven't looked at that
0085
1	document. So --1 did look at some of his
2	service record, but the service record
3	largely listed was the first wave of service
4	in World War II, which as an aside was
5	interesting to me because of where he
6	served. He was in the thick of the Pacific
7	campaign.
8	Q. And what about where he served is
9	relevant to your opinions in this case other
10	than just a general interest?
11	A. Just general interest.
12	Q. Fair enough. Now, let's talk a
13	little bit about the military and
14	cigarettes. You're aware that the military
15	purchased cigarettes from the tobacco
16	companies; correct?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. And that the military distributed
19	cigarettes in really two ways. One way was
20	that people could go buy the cigarettes at
21	the PX who were enlisted; correct?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. And those were referred to
24	oftentimes as tax-free cigarettes?
25	A. Yes. They were at substantially
0086
1	lower prices because they weren't federally
2	taxed or state taxed.
3	Q. The other way that they did it is
4	included in the rations that were provided
5	to soldiers serving overseas like
6	Mr. Bowden; correct?
7	A. Yes. C and K rations often had a
8	four-pack with each meal.
9	Q. So a soldier, for example, if you
10	look at historical information, you can see
11	the rations included food, it could include
12	candy, gum, cigarettes, and maybe some other
13	things of interest to the soldiers serving
14	in the battlefield; correct?
15	A. Matches.
16	Q. Matches as well. You can't have a
17	cigarette without matches. And so during
18	Mr. Bowden's time while he was in the
19	military, he became a regular smoker;
20	correct?
21	A. That's correct. That's my
22	understanding.
23	Q. And do you have an understanding
24	what brands he was smoking when he first was
25	in the military?
0087
1	A. Yeah. The deposition testimony
2	centers on -- well, really the most popular
3	brands of the day, Camel and Lucky Strike.
4	Q. And are you familiar with the fact
5	that the military really only carried the
6	most popular brands as duty-free or tax-free
7	cigarettes because of all of the paperwork
8	involved in the process?
9	A. Well, there weren't that many
10	brands at this time. So you really only
11	have, you know, five major brands. You
12	know, minor brands like Murad, I'm not sure,
13	you know. But, I mean, by this time, they
14	have an infinitesimal market share of their
15	older form of cigarettes.
16	I do know that the provision of
17	adequate supplies of cigarettes was a
18	principal concern of the military. They
19	worked hard to make sure that cigarettes
20	were available everywhere that American
21	servicemen were stationed in the world.
22	Q. In fact, there were Congressional
23	hearings about that. Are you aware of that?
24	A. Yes. Yeah. In 1944. Yeah. I
25	believe it was 1944. Yeah. The hearings on
0088
1	the provisioning of supplies to our soldiers
2	in which there is a separate hearing just
3	based on cigarettes.
4	Q. And one of the concerns was that
5	there was a shortage of cigarettes; correct?
6	A. That's correct, yes. There was
7	problems with getting -- distributing
8	cigarettes and getting them to the troops,
9	and Congressmen were concerned about that.
10	Q. And there was also a shortage of
11	cigarettes for people who weren't in the
12	military, that there weren't enough to meet
13	the supply or the demand here in the U.S.
14	for people who wanted to smoke; correct?
15	A. That's correct. And what's going
16	on is a number of factors. You know,
17	classic demand and supply. It's more time
18	production.
19	Tobacco is an item considered
20	essential to national defense, and so its
21	production was supported. One, if they were
22	a tobacco worker, could claim an exemption
23	from service because of the domestic need.
24	Other critical industries had similar
25	arrangements. But also the smoking
0089
1	prevenance. The consumption of cigarettes
2	explodes during World War II, the rate of
3	smoking and also the amount. And so there's
4	a significant increase in the demand.
5	In those hearings, you've read them
6	so you would know this, one of the
7	statements by the Army -- the military
8	representative is that the presumption is
9	that in the military everyone smokes. That
10	was their presumption. When asked how do
11	they determine the demand for cigarettes,
12	well, we presume that everybody smokes.
13	Q. And they did that and I think they
14	testified that they wanted a supply of like
15	1.4 packs her person; correct?
16	A. Yeah. That's about right, yes.
17	Q. And obviously many people were
18	smoking more than that; right?
19	A. Sure.
20	Q. And some people were smoking less
21	or not at all?
22	A. Yes. Although the smoking rate in
23	the military is very, very high. Again, the
24	presumption is that everybody smokes.
25	Q. And so Mr. Bowden is not unusual in
0090
1	the sense that many of the men who were
2	dealing with the stress of first-line
3	defense of the country were, in fact,
4	smokers?
5	A. Well, it's simply, you know, a fact
6	of history that both during World War I and
7	again during World War II the military
8	becomes a principal context or environment
9	in which young men are, you know, drawn into
10	a smoking culture and develop a smoking
11	addiction, yes. So it is -- you know,
12	military service at that time was highly
13	conducive to developing smoking addiction.
14	Q. Okay. So Mr. Bowden, at least the
15	information you have, was smoking Camels and
16	Lucky Strikes during this period while he
17	was in the military? At least those were
18	his primary brands ?
19	A. Yes. That's what the record
20	indicates.
21	Q. Okay. And that was from his wife;
22	correct, primarily?
23	A. Yes. Yeah.
24	Q. Of course, she wasn't there; right?
25	A. No. It's secondhand.
0091
I	Q. And in some respects, Mr. Bowden --
2	well, I don't know if the word is stuck, but
3	basically received -- whatever brands he
4	received in his rations were the brands that
5	he would smoke; correct?
6	A. That's true, yeah. But he, of
7	course, had the option to buy them as well.
8	Q. Right. So he could buy them at the
9	PX or he could get the cigarettes that came
10	in his ration; correct?
II	A. Yes.
12	Q. And then the government also, in
13	many locations overseas, didn't charge
14	military personnel for their cigarettes when
15	they were overseas in action; correct?
16	A. Right. I mean, there's a lot of
17	tobacco surging through the entire system.
18	You know, I mean, soldiers smoke them, they
19	give them away, they barter, they steal
20	cigarettes from the PX and sell them to the
21	black market and occupied areas. I mean,
22	there's a lot of, you know, -- just in terms
23	of the military effect, you know, how do
24	these brands become global brands? Well,
25	you know, their distribution during World
0092
1	War II. It's true of cigarettes as well.
2	They bleed into the communities. So there's
3	a lot of tobacco surging through the U.S.
4	Army and the Navy and the Marines.
5	Q. And so, for example, you saw in
6	those hearings that the report to the
7	Congressional committee that they had, for
8	example, billions of cigarettes in storage,
9	for example, in Europe?
10	A. That's correct.
11	Q. And they had billions of cigarettes
12	in storage in the U.S. that they would ship
13	over on ships and by other means to
14	distribute to the military personnel;
15	correct?
16	A. Yes. It was a lot of tobacco.
17	Q. So after Mr. Bowden gets out of the
18	military, he's at that point a regular
19	smoker; correct?
20	A. Yes. That's how I would describe
21	it, yes.
22	Q. And he goes to work at Southwestern
23	Bell as a linesman? Did you see that?
24	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
25	the form.
0093
1	A. Yes, a technician. Yes, working
2	for the phone company.
3	Q. And he worked there for what, about
4	25 years or so?
5	A. He retires sometimes in the late
6	'70s, yes. So he has a full career there.
7	Q. And so after he gets back and a
8	couple of years into work, he starts having
9	children and he marries Gloria Bowden;
10	correct?
11	A. That's correct.
12	Q. And that all happens in the 1950s?
13	A. Yes. The early '50s, yes.
14	Q. So he marries Mrs. Bowden and she
15	has a son from a previous relationship, Ted?
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. And he's eventually, at least from
18	the information we have, adopted?
19	A. Yes, adopted by Mr. Bowden. Yes,
20	that's correct.
21	Q. Tammy and Nancy are both bom in
22	the 1950s?
23	A. That's correct.
24	MS. V ALLE JOS - NICHOLS: Objection.
25	Object to the fomi.
0094
1	Q. Let's talk a little bit -- let me
2	back up. I think her objection was I think
3	Nancy was bom in the '60s. I think she was
4	bom in 1967; right?
5	A. Yeah. She's the youngest, that's
6	right.
7	Q. I get the decades confused. I
8	apologize. But Tammy was born in 1958?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. Any opinions you have about
11	Mr. Bowden's smoking history after he got
12	back from the military during the 1950s
13	that's related specifically to Mr. Bowden as
14	opposed to the industry?
15	A. Well, it seems at this period of
16	time he continues in the brands that we
17	discussed earlier and then in the '60s makes
18	a change in his brands. But I guess that's
19	getting ahead of what you're --
20	Q. Yeah. I just wanted to focus on
21	the '50s. So that's it for the '50s?
22	A. Yeah. There's some reference to an
23	occasional Pall Mall use.
24	Q. But his primary brands don't change
25	from the time that he's in the military?
0095
1	A. No. No. It seems to be Lucky and
2	Camels.
3	Q. All right. Let's talk about the
4	1960s. In the 1960s, that's the period when
5	warnings come on the packs; correct?
6	A. 1965, that's correct.
7	Q. The Surgeon General's report comes
8	out?
9	A. In 1964, yes.
10	Q. And that's also when Mrs. Bowden
11	quits smoking, according to her children, in
12	the late 1960s; correct?
13	A. That's correct.
14	Q. And when Mrs. Bowden quits smoking
15	at that point in time, her kids all report
16	that she no longer allowed smoking in the
17	house?
18	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
19	the form.
20	A. Yes. I think, you know, Mr. Bowden
21	was a pretty heavy smoker, two packs a day.
22	You know, I'm not completely sure how
23	effective that band was is all I'm getting
24	at. He seems to have smoked quite a bit.
25	And it's reported he liked to smoke while he
0096
1	watches TV, for example.
2	Q. Well, don't all the children report
3	that after the mother said no more smoking
4	in the house that no one smoked in Gloria
5	Bowden's home?
6	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
7	the form.
8	A. I may have missed that particular
9	statement. So I'm not sure on that.
10	Q. Now, I think two of the kids say
11	that Mrs. Bowden prohibited smoking starting
12	in the late 1960s. I think one of the
13	daughters says early 1970s. But in any
14	event, it was around that time period;
15	correct?
16	A. Yeah. And that's not -- you know,
17	it's not figured in my opinions for this
18	case.
19	Q. Mrs. Bowden also didn't let
20	Mr. Bowden smoke in the car around the kids;
21	right?
22	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
23	the form.
24	A. Yeah, there's discussion of that.
25	That's correct.
0097
1	Q. And then you also saw in Ted's
2	deposition that he recalls learning about
3	the hazards of smoking when his coach told
4	him that smoking was bad for your health and
5	he talked to his dad about that in the late
6	'60s?
7	A. Yeah. There's a reference to that,
8	yes.
9	Q. And he also recalls talking with
10	his dad during this time period about the
11	relationship between cancer and smoking;
12	correct?
13	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
14	the form.
15	A. Yes. I mean, generally, the kids
16	indicate that their father said, you know,
17	don't smoke. He said, I wish I could quit,
18	don't pick it up.
19	Q. Well, what I'm referring to
20	specifically is Ted recalling talking to his
21	dad in the late 1960s about the fact that
22	smoking and cancer were related?
23	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
24	the form.
25	A. I -- that may be in there. I'm not
0098
1	exactly recalling that particular section,
2	you know. So I'm not exactly sure. But I
3	don't dispute it. I'd have to go back and
4	double check.
5	Q. In any event, both Mr. and Mrs.
6	Bowden made it clear to their kids that they
7	didn't want them to smoke; right?
8	A. Yes, I think that's fair.
9	Q. And it was safe to say that it was
10	a --1 think described as a no-no to smoke
11	around Mr. or Mrs. Bowden?
12	A. I'm not sure about that. But I --
13	again, just from my recollection of the
14	depositions, I can agree with the former
15	statement more affirmatively. I'm just less
16	certain on the statement you just made just
17	through recollection.
18	Q. Fair enough. What about
19	Mr. Bowden's smoking history in the 1960s as
20	it relates to his brands, any change in
21	that?
22	A. He does seem to change -- well, the
23	record indicates that he does change
24	brands. He moves to two very popular
25	filtered brands principally, or so it seems
0099
1	principally, Marlboro, with Winston smoking
2	also.
3	Q. Did you get any sense from the
4	record how much he smoked Marlboros versus
5	how much he smoked Winstons?
6	A. Marlboros seems to have been the
7	regular usual and, therefore, principal
8	brand that he used in lesser amounts.
9	Q. And did you see any inconsistencies
10	in terms of the testimony about that, in
11	terms of what his primary brands were?
12	A. They mentioned both of those. I
13	didn't really focus on trying to evaluate.
14	You know, those were the two most popular
15	brands in the country at the time and that
16	was good enough for me.
17	Q. And are you certain that it was the
18	1960s that he made the switch or was it
19	later in the 1970s?
20	A. My sense is in the '60s that he
21	moves to the regular Marlboros, the filtered
22	brand; and then later in the 1980s, he does
23	move to some light brands. But my
24	recollection was in the '60s.
25	Q. Does it affect your opinion one way
0100
1	or another if it was actually in the 1970s?
2	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
3	the form.
4	A. No. I mean, that fits -- you
5	know, that fits the general market trend of
6	the, you know, rapid -- or the significant
7	shift towards filters, which happens over
8	the course of the '60s and early '70s, and
9	1970s.
10	Q. Anything else about the 1960s in
11	terms of your opinions specifically as it
12	relates to Mr. Bowden, the case-specific
13	portion?
14	A. No.
15	Q. The 1970s, that's --1 think we
16	talked about earlier, that's when he leaves
17	Southwestern Bell; correct?
18	A. That's right. My sense is that he
19	retired and then takes up other jobs, kind
20	of a clerk at gas stations and other, you
21	know, sign painting and other kind of post
22	retirement jobs I guess you would call it.
23	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: David, can I
24	just make a quick correction? It's not
25	Southwestern Bell. It's Southern Bell.
0101
1	MR. THORNE: Thank you. I'm just
2	so used to Southwestern Bell. Southern
3	Bell. Let the record reflect that it's
4	Southern Bell.
5	THE WITNESS: Yes. That's good.
6	Right.
7	MR. THORNE: Thank you, Dawn.
8	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Sorry.
9	THE WITNESS: The phone company.
10	MR. THORNE: I just haven't
11	encountered Southern Bell before, so I was
12	thinking it was Southwestern.
13	Q. Do you recall in the 1970s the
14	testimony about the fact that Mr. Bowden's
15	brother, Emory, develops lung cancer as a
16	smoker and dies?
17	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
18	the form.
19	A. There -- yes, that's discussed.
20	Yes, his brother does die.
21	Q. Okay. In the 1970s also is when
22	advertising for cigarettes is discontinued
23	on television; correct?
24	A. Yes. 1971.
25	Q. And at this point in time, there
0102
1	are warnings that appear on all cigarette
2	advertising and tax; correct?
3	A. Right. Yeah. Actually, from '65
4	to '71 it's what I call a caution statement
5	and then the text changes and becomes a
6	warning statement, and that prevails until
7	the mid '80s, and it is on the print
8	advertising.
9	Q. What about the 1970s, is there
10	anything about Mr. Bowden in your opinions
11	in this case in terms of what happened in
12	the 1970s as it relates to a smoking
13	history?
14	A. No. He seems to be, you know,
15	using the brands I identified earlier. So
16	nothing in addition to that.
17	Q. Let's move to the 1980s. In the
18	1980s it's safe to say that Mr. Bowden is
19	holding a number of jobs where he works at
20	gas stations/convenience stores; correct?
21	A. That's right. Yes.
22	Q. He works at a place called Little
23	Champs, he works at Mobil gas, he works at
24	an Amoco station and a Shell station, and
25	maybe a couple of others as well.
0103
1	A. Right. There's a reference to
2	Hess. I mean, it seems to be a type of
3	occupation that he's engaging in at a
4	variety of places.
5	Q. And Hess, just so that we're clear,
6	that's where he worked starting in 1991;
7	correct?
8	A. Oh, I see. Okay. Yes, that's
9	right. So if you want to stick to the '80s,
10	that's right.
11	Q. So in the '80s, he's working at a
12	number of convenience stores, but Hess
13	actually occurs in the 1990s; right?
14	A. That's correct, yes.
15	Q. And in addition to that, he also
16	works at a sign company with his son-in-law;
17	right?
18	A. That's correct.
19	Q. And I think that's one of those
20	depositions that you didn't recall reading?
21	A. Right. But there's reference to
22	that in other documents.
23	Q. Okay. So you didn't see, for
24	example, in his testimony, the son-in-law's,
25	that he only recalls him smoking Marlboro
0104
1	Reds during the time period that he knew
2	him?
3	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
4	the form.
5	A. No, I didn't review that testimony
6	to that detail.
7	Q. During the 1980s is also the time
8	period at least when Mrs. Bowden and some of
9	the other witnesses remember him switching
10	from a full flavored filtered cigarette to a
11	light cigarette; correct?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. And that occurred somewhere in the
14	mid-to-late 1980s?
15	A. Right. Yes. Sometime during that
16	decade.
17	Q. And what Mrs. Bowden recalls is
18	that Mr. Bowden told her that the reason he
19	was starting to smoke a lighter cigarette
20	was because it had lower tar and nicotine
21	and he perceived it to be a cigarette that
22	wasn't as hazardous; correct?
23	A. Yes. Yes. That's the point that I
24	make in my report.
25	Q. And in terms of that overall
0105
1	information, that's information that was
2	being put out by public health officials
3	dating back to really Dr. Wynder in the
4	1950s; right?
5	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
6	the form.
7	A. Well, yeah. What -- some public
8	health researchers who did not have the
9	knowledge of compensation and the full
10	knowledge of the -- all aspects of the
11	design of the actual light, low-tar
12	cigarettes that were introduced on the
13	market made the assumption that if you
14	smoked a cigarette with lower tar and lower
15	nicotine you would reduce your harm.
16	Of course, we now know both within
17	industry documents and, you know, external
18	research, that that was not the case.
19	Q. I don't want to take you through
20	all of your opinions on light cigarettes and
21	I know that you have a vast array and we
22	could be here all day talking about that,
23	but I guess my only point is, that you're
24	aware that organizations like the American
25	Cancer Society were putting out a public
0106
1	announcement urging people to quit and if
2	they didn't quit, to smoke lower tar
3	cigarettes; correct?
4	A. Yes. To reduce -- smoke lights,
5	low tars, cut your cigarette in half. There
6	are a variety of ways to reduce your
7	exposure to cigarette smoke.
8	Q. And there were public service
9	announcements that appeared on television
10	and written in magazines and newspapers and
11	so on with that message?
12	A. Yes, there were. Yeah. These
13	messages were disseminated, yeah, in those
14	ways.
15	Q. And that's also true with regard to
16	compensation. There's been information from
17	the public health community that's been
18	disseminated that says that people should
19	continue to -- if they're going to smoke
20	lighter, lower tar cigarettes, they need to
21	continue smoking the same number of
22	cigarettes, don't smoke it down to the butt,
23	all kinds of information about not
24	compensating by smoking more with low-tar
25	cigarettes; correct?
0107
1	A. Well, I can't completely agree with
2	that because I think the term "compensation"
3	entails a -- you know, kind of a wider array
4	of compensatory smoking behaviors, many of
5	them done almost without awareness by the
6	smoker but to the limited sense that we're
7	saying, yeah, reduce the number of
8	cigarettes you smoke. If you want to quit,
9	reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke,
10	try to smoke a lighter, low tar. That part
11	I can agree with that.
12	Q. And you can agree with the
13	statements that they also said don't smoke
14	more when you start smoking lower tar
15	cigarettes? That was certainly public
16	health messages and communicated to the
17	public.
18	A. Well, yes. The idea that you --
19	yes. Yeah, to reduce your harm. Don't
20	increase it, reduce it.
21	Q. And so individuals like Mr. Bowden
22	who is described as up on current events and
23	watched the evening and local news may have
24	encountered that message from various public
25	health organizations; correct?
0108
1	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
2	the form.
3	A. Yeah. Just as he's encountering
4	the messages from the industry, he is also
5	encountering public health messages.
6	Q. By the way, Mr. Bowden is described
7	by his children as someone who is a very
8	intelligent person; correct?
9	A. You know, his intelligence
10	didn't --1 mean, I did not make an
11	evaluation of how smart he was. I mean, he
12	certainly didn't seem to suffer from any
13	impairments. He was, you know, a normal,
14	average, hard-working, responsible person.
15	I mean, that's certainly a picture I get of
16	him.
17	Q. Well, the other thing that they
18	specifically said was that he regularly,
19	daily read the newspaper.
20	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
21	the form.
22	A. They indicate that they -- they got
23	the Florida Times Union, the Jacksonville
24	paper, and they did like to watch the TV
25	news. There's not a lot of description of
0109
1	like magazines and things like that, just as
2	an aside observation; but, yeah, I mean, I
3	think he was, you know, like most people,
4	kind of kept up like with television news
5	and those things.
6	Q. In fact, didn't, I think it was
7	Tammy, the daughter, say that he watched
8	both the local and national news daily?
9	A. Yes.
10	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
11	the form.
12	A. Yes, he did like to watch the TV
13	news, that is true, as I mentioned earlier.
14	Q. And I think Ted mentioned that he
15	liked to watch Walter Cronkite and David
16	Brinkley?
17	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
18	the form.
19	A. Yes. Yeah. They would be on
20	different stations but, yeah, those were
21	the -- in the '60s and '70s two of the more
22	prominent, especially Walter Cronkite on
23	CBS, the leading television newscaster, I
24	guess you would call it, or anchorman.
25	Q. So, for example, if Mr. Bowden was
0110
1	watching nightly News and reading the
2	newspaper during the 1960s, you would agree
3	that he certainly would have likely heard
4	the story about the Surgeon General's report
5	that came out in the 1960s?
6	A. Oh, sure. I mean, that was a big
7	story. Even if he didn't watch the news, he
8	probably would have heard about it. You
9	know, people -- you know, media works both
10	through direct and indirect means. You
11	know, it helps shape the conversation. And
12	just like he would have encountered the
13	cigarette advertising and other messages
14	from the tobacco industry, he would have
15	also encountered, you know, stories about
16	covering the Surgeon General's report and
17	those kind of things.
18	Q. Now, when Mr. Bowden was working at
19	convenience stores, one of the things that
20	he was also doing was selling cigarettes;
21	correct?
22	A. Yes. Particularly the time that
23	he's working at the convenience stores, they
24	are moving into being one of the main ways
25	in which cigarettes are sold to the public.
0111
1	Q. And during the time period in which
2	he's working at the convenience stores,
3	there's warnings on every pack that he sells
4	to consumers; correct?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. And there's also point of purchase
7	displays which are described in the
8	depositions?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. And those point of purchase
11	displays for cigarettes would have all
12	included a warning on them; correct?
13	A. Yes. On the advertising portion,
14	yes, or the visual advertisement.
15	Q. All right. Let's talk -- anything
16	else about the 1980s about Mr. Bowden's
17	smoking history or your opinions as it
18	relates thereto that I should know about?
19	A. Well, there are -- there are
20	descriptions of quit attempts during --
21	particularly during this period of time. I
22	don't know if I'm going to discuss those at
23	the -- in the direct exam or not; but, you
24	know, he does, you know, try everything from
25	cold turkey, with lozenges and candies to,
0112
1	you know, more kind of medically indicated
2	efforts to quit through, for example, the
3	patch. There's even a reference, I think,
4	perhaps to the gum later, but generally the
5	patch, which his wife mentions and in a
6	couple of other places.
7	Q. What time period do you recall in
8	the depositions that he started to try and
9	quit smoking?
10	A. That's unclear to me. I would have
11	to go back and --1 didn't make, you know, a
12	specific note. I noticed the patch. Of
13	course the patch would have to be after --
14	the patch is introduced in the early '80s.
15	So certainly that seems to be coming about,
16	you know, from the mid-to-the-late '80s and
17	I guess into the '90s various attempts. I
18	didn't make a list of every quitting time
19	reference.
20	The candy, in discussions, ones of
21	his daughters references, you know, attempts
22	to quit with candy and stuff. I just am not
23	sure. I'd have to check--1 would just
24	have to check the record to see if there
25	were any before that. So I'm just not sure.
0113
1	Q. Is Mr. Bowden's quit attempts
2	something that's essential to your opinions
3	in this case?
4	A. Not really, since I understand my
5	role in this is to talk about, you know,
6	kind of the promotion, the marketing, the
7	distribution of the cigarettes and the
8	creation of the cigarette culture and the
9	environment of smoking as a historical
10	phenomena over time. So I don't anticipate
11	discussing this. You know, I'm not going to
12	offer opinions on his level of addiction and
13	those medical issues.
14	So it's something that I noted to
15	the extent that I just described but, you
16	know, didn't include in my affidavit and
17	don't anticipate testifying about directly.
18	Q. All right. Let's move to the
19	1990s. That's when Mr. Bowden goes to work
20	at Hess Oil Company; correct?
21	A. Yes, that's right. I guess that
22	happens in the '90s, yes.
23	Q. And he works there, I think, for
24	about a -- from '91 to '94. Somewhere in
25	that time period after he's diagnosed. I'm
0114
1	not sure how much he works after that, but
2	certainly that's the time period; correct?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. Okay. And while he's at Hess,
5	that's when I think you mentioned that he
6	receives some merchandise; correct?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. And did you bring those with you?
9	A. The pictures?
10	Q. Yes.
11	A. No. I thought they might have been
12	disclosed on the list.
13	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: They are.
14	A. But I can describe them.
15	Q. Go ahead.
16	A. You know, it's a variety of Philip
17	Morris and R.J. Reynolds themed merchandise
18	ranging from ashtrays to the always
19	interesting Joe Camel koozie. I have one of
20	those in my collection. There was a Basic
21	item, and by "Basic," I'm referring to the
22	brand of cigarette. Some items there and
23	t-shirts and other, what I would call
24	informally these days as swag, which is a
25	term, you know, kind of themed merchandise
0115
1	that's given away, you know, to promote the
2	item as it's used by the customer.
3	Q. So that merchandise became in the
4	possession of the family after he passed
5	away; correct?
6	A. Yes. Those were his things. I
7	guess he kind of accumulated them.
8	Q. All right. And so the testimony
9	from people who -- well, let me rephrase it.
10	None of the family members were there when
11	he received that merchandise; correct?
12	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
13	the form.
14	A. Well, when you say "there," you
15	mean like at work?
16	Q. Present.
17	A. When he actually opened up the box
18	or -- yeah, I didn't make a note either way.
19	Q. Well, let me rephrase the question
20	and make it clear. No one has firsthand
21	knowledge of how Mr. Bowden received that
22	merchandise; correct?
23	A. Well, I just paid attention to the
24	fact that he did have it, you know. The
25	presumption is that he got it from the
0116
1	cigarette manufacturers either at work or
2	some other method.
3	Q. Okay. That's a presumption, but no
4	one knows for certain because no one has
5	firsthand knowledge about who gave it to him
6	or how he received it; correct?
7	A. I didn't see that particular item
8	come up, so I didn't see a description of
9	actually how he got it, which, I mean, does
10	that mean he filled out a form and mailed it
11	in? I don't know.
12	Q. So one of the ways he could have
13	gotten it is he could have clipped coupons,
14	sent those in and the company might have
15	sent him merchandise; correct?
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. Another way that he could have
18	gotten it is the convenience store sold, for
19	example, Mack lighters, match books, those
20	kind of things, and so he could have either
21	purchased them or taken them from the store
22	when he worked for Hess; correct?
23	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
24	the form.
25	A. Yes, he could have gotten them that
0117
1	way as well.
2	Q. Or another possibility is, you
3	understand that the distribution of
4	cigarettes is that there are wholesalers who
5	sell them; right, to convenience stores?
6	A. That's right. They are
7	intermediaries between the manufacturer and
8	the retailer.
9	Q. So, for example, Philip Morris
10	doesn't go out to Hess and actually sell
11	them cigarettes, there's a wholesaler that
12	does that; correct?
13	A. Right. Jobbers and wholesalers.
14	Q. So one of the representatives for
15	the wholesaler who delivered the cigarettes
16	may have had some merchandise and may have
17	given that to Mr. Bowden?
18	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
19	the form.
20	A. Yes. And, I mean, what you're
21	getting at is it's quite common for the
22	manufacturers, say, for example, your
23	client, Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds, to
24	have essentially a giveaway, you know, for a
25	themed promotion; and, yes, the actual
0118
1	physical distribution of that giveaway item,
2	either it's attached to the pack of
3	cigarettes or some other -- or they're put
4	in a basket and you can take them, is
5	actually physically distributed to the store
6	through the wholesale or jobber.
7	Q. And so Mr. Bowden could have said,
8	hey, can I have one of those pair of shorts
9	that have a camel on them, or the wholesaler
10	may have offered them to him. We don't
11	know.
12	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
13	the form.
14	A. Yes. Correct. Yeah. I mean, you
15	know, again -- but just let's look at the
16	full picture as, you know, the items are
17	produced. These are trademarked items with,
18	you know, business trademarks on them,
19	Marlboro, Winston, other brands, and these
20	are produced in arrangement with the
21	manufacturer. You know, they contract with
22	a company and the company manufacturers the
23	item on behalf of the cigarette manufacturer
24	as part of their promotional efforts.
25	And so by focusing on the
0119
1	wholesaler as you're describing, we're
2	really dealing with the person that just
3	simply moves the product to the retailer.
4	You know, this a conveyor, someone who's
5	involved in physical movement and the
6	arrangement of the displays, sets up the
7	display in the store. Usually, there's
8	guidelines as to how to do purchase
9	displays, for example, or how to display the
10	free item; or if it's a for sale item, how
11	much it should cost and how it should be
12	marketed or sold to the final consumer.
13	Q. My only point is that whoever that
14	person is, he's not an employee of Philip
15	Morris or he's not an employee of Reynolds
16	or of any tobacco companies; correct?
17	A. No. But he's an agent of the
18	industry because he is part of the closely
19	monitored and carefully calibrated and
20	coordinated system of -- literally of
21	marketing. And we talked about marketing
22	and bringing the product to the consumer.
23	Q. You're not an expert in agency law,
24	though, are you?
25	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
0120
1	the form.
2	A. In law, no. No. I mean, he's an
3	agent in the sense that he's -- I'm using it
4	more in terms of the economic sense of the
5	--for example, the principal agent problem
6	in economics. You know, you have the
7	principal and the agent, the principal being
8	the industry and the agent being the
9	wholesaler.
10	Q. So one is the manufacturer who then
11	sells it to a customer, who then sells it to
12	another customer; correct?
13	A. That's correct.
14	Q. All right. Now, in terms of the
15	merchandise that he received, the majority
16	of the pictures that you saw were of brands
17	that Mr. Bowden was smoking; correct?
18	A. Yes. Yeah. Because he does --
19	there is evidence at this point in time of
20	moving back towards a filtered Camel brand
21	and a light Camel brand. There is some
22	evidence of occasional Basic use, you know,
23	that's mentioned somewhere, but still
24	principally Marlboro with Winston.
25	Q. So the majority of this stuff is
0121
1	Marlboro, Winston, or Camel cigarettes of
2	which he has been smoking those brands, some
3	of them, since he was in the military,
4	others since the '60s or '70s; correct?
5	A. Yes, that's accurate.
6	Q. So 20-plus years he's been using
7	those brands; correct?
8	A. Yeah.
9	Q. There's also pictures for brands
10	that he actually never used. For example,
11	Skoal is one?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. So Mr. Bowden collected this stuff
14	in some respects regardless of whether he
15	ever intended to use any of the products;
16	correct?
17	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
18	the form.
19	A. Yeah, he has -- yeah, he has a wide
20	collection.
21	Q. Now, some of the pictures that were
22	taken of the merchandise showed Camel and it
23	showed more of the kind of cartoon depiction
24	of a camel. Do you recall that?
25	A. When you say "cartoon," for Joe
0122
1	Camel?
2	Q. Joe Camel, yes.
3	A. Yes. Yeah. The koozie as an
4	example.
5	Q. Exactly. And I don't recall
6	whether you said you reviewed this or not,
7	but did you see in his grandson's deposition
8	that they kind of laughed at thinking
9	basically that that was kind of goofy?
10	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
11	the form.
12	A. I didn't read that deposition, so I
13	didn't see that particular item.
14	Q. Okay. At the time that Mr. Bowden
15	came in possession of these pieces of
16	merchandise with tobacco company logos on
17	them, he was in his mid 60s; correct?
18	A. Yeah. He was bom in 1925. Yeah.
19	Q. And at that point in time, he had
20	been smoking for well over 40 years?
21	A. Yes, that's correct.
22	Q. None of the merchandise that he
23	received, however he received it, was for
24	light cigarettes, was it?
25	A. Well, there's some Basic items that
0123
1	was light.
2	Q. But that was never his brand?
3	A. No. He doesn't smoke that as much
4	as some of the others, but you asked me if
5	it was any for light brands and that would
6	have been one.
7	Q. But for Marlboro and Winston,
8	there's no light cigarettes and those were
9	his primary brands; correct?
10	A. Right. The Marlboro family and the
11	Winston family of brands were his primary
12	brands; and, yeah, I'm just recalling, you
13	know, just general Marlboro and Winston -
14	themed items.
15	Q. Any other opinions about the
16	merchandise as it relates specifically to
17	Mr. Bowden? I realize you may have opinions
18	generally about it, but I just want to make
19	sure that I didn't miss anything with regard
20	to Mr. Bowden.
21	A. No.
22	Q. Let me switch -- I may have
23	forgotten something, I'll go back and look,
24	but why don't we just keep going. I just
25	want to go through some of the documents
0124
1	that Dawn sent to me that are new reliance
2	materials for this case to make sure that I
3	know what your opinions are, if any, as it
4	pertains to this case.
5	A. Okay.
6	Q. And that is going to require me to
7	get out a notebook.
8	A. Okay.
9	Q. And I only have one copy of these,
10	because, honestly, they're so big, I
11	couldn't bring one for everybody.
12	A. Well, I will -
13	Q. What I'm going to do is I'm going
14	to give them to you.
15	A. Okay.
16	Q. I'm going to let you look at them
17	and I'm going to use these clips right here
18	(indicating) and we'll try and do this in a
19	systematic way.
20	A. And feel free to walk around and
21	look over my shoulder if you feel more
22	comfortable. I don't--you know, whatever
23	makes your job as efficient and as easy as
24	you need it to be.
25	Q. Okay. Now, these are -- just so
0125
1	that we're clear for the record, these are
2	all documents that appeared on the CD that
3	Ms. Vallejos-Nichols sent to me that are
4	additional reliance materials for this
5	particular case. So we'll go through each
6	one of these and identify them. And if
7	there's something here that doesn't fall
8	into that category, will you let me know?
9	A. Sure, I will.
10	Q. All right. So here is the first
11	document. I don't even think I have a clip
12	big enough for this one. We'll have to
13	figure that out. A rubber band. Let me
14	hand this to you (indicating). And this
15	document, at least as it's numbered, is
16	60217731. Do you recognize that document?
17	A. I sure do.
18	Q. Okay. And that is a document, it
19	looks like, from the files of American
20	Tobacco Company; is that right?
21	A. Yes. This would be, yeah, American
22	Tobacco.
23	Q. Okay. And how does that figure
24	into your opinions in this case, that
25	document?
0126
1	A. Well, this is from a -- essentially
2	a Hollywood product placement firm. These
3	are documents I discovered in my research.
4	Gary Mezzatesta, M-E-Z-Z-A-T-E-S-T-A, and it
5	is just simply a substantial number of
6	descriptions of ways in which Mr. Mezzatesta
7	is working and others. There's other agents
8	working to place American Tobacco-branded
9	cigarettes in Philips.
10	Q. Okay. Let me come around and look
11	at this but is this -- my recollection is
12	this is a document from a marketing firm?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. And they're attempting to get
15	placement of cigarettes in various movies or
16	films; correct?
17	A. Yes, that's correct.
18	Q. And it reports on whether or not,
19	in fact, they're able to successfully do it?
20	A. Well, yeah. It varies. I mean,
21	there's, you know, a substantial number,
22	over a hundred, well over -- I've actually
23	never counted them. It's a long document.
24	But, yeah, they -- each memo has a
25	description of the story line; name of the
0127
1	film; the people involved, at least with the
2	production of the film; and then potential
3	exposure.
4	Q. And these relate to potential
5	exposures for brands at the time made by
6	American Tobacco Company?
7	A. Yes, the American Tobacco Company.
8	Q. And we don't know whether or not
9	those attempts to place American brands into
10	a movie whether or not those were
11	successful; correct?
12	A. Well, one could -- yeah, I mean,
13	you'd have to go and look at the films.
14	There's many films here. The significance
15	of this document to me is that the industry
16	worked very hard to get its products in
17	cinema. In this case, these are all dated
18	from the 1980s. Yeah.
19	Q. All right. But this document, as
20	it relates to your opinion, this is specific
21	to American Tobacco Company?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. All right. So it has nothing to do
24	with, for example, whether Philip Morris was
25	trying to get its product into movies;
0128
1	correct?
2	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
3	the form.
4	A. Right. This would relate to the
5	company that now owns the American Tobacco
6	business, which is R.J. Reynolds.
7	Q. Now, that's not -- well, let me
8	back up. Did you see in the testimony that
9	Mr. Bowden didn't like to go to movies?
10	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
11	the form.
12	A. Yes. His wife indicated that, yes.
13	Q. So we have no evidence that
14	Mr. Bowden ever saw any of these movies
15	where packs of cigarettes may have been
16	placed?
17	A. Right. Yeah, I don't know what
18	movies he saw and have made no attempt to
19	kind of correlate the films that he may have
20	saw, if any. This is more kind of just the
21	way in which the industry worked to get its
22	message out to the broader American public
23	of which Mr. Bowden was a member.
24	Q. But there's no evidence that any
25	placement of any cigarettes in a movie had
0129
1	any influence on Mr. Bowden in particular in
2	his decision to smoke any particular brand?
3	A. Right. I mean, this is kind of
4	like the -- when you asked me the question
5	about his possible learning of the Surgeon
6	General's report and the like, and I made
7	the point that media works directly and
8	indirectly by shaping conversation and
9	through other people that see this and talk
10	about it, but, you know, direct, no, I don't
11	have a --1 can't put them in the theater.
12	Q. All right. Any other opinions as
13	it relates to that document?
14	A. No.
15	Q. All right. Let's move to the next
16	one.
17	A. Do you want to put it back so you
18	can keep track of things?
19	MR. THORNE: Let's go off the
20	record for a second.
21
22	(The time is 11:30 a.m.)
23
24	(Whereupon, an off-the-record
25	discussion was held.)
0130
2	(The time is 11:31 a.m.)
3
4	(Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit No.
5	7 was marked for identification and same is
6	attached hereto.)
7
8	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, we've decided
9	we're going to mark as Exhibit 7 a notebook
10	that contains all of the documents that I
11	received from Ms. Vallejos-Nichols that
12	relate to your case-specific opinions in
13	this case so that we can keep them all
14	together. Does that sound like a good plan?
15	A. That's a good idea.
16	Q. All right. The next one that I'm
17	going to hand to you is numbered in the
18	notebook 502343938, and this is a document
19	at the top that says, "William Esty Company"
20	from Jack Grossman to Mr. Ogbum at R.J.
21	Reynolds Company.
22	A. Okay.
23	Q. Have you seen that document
24	before? Take your time to review it.
25	A. Yeah. This is a, you know,
0131
1	marketing document from the '70s that
2	relates to the brands.
3	Q. I'm listening.
4	A. Smoked by -- at least some of the
5	brands smoked by Mr. Bowden.
6	Q. So this -- just to be clear, it's a
7	document that's found in the files of RJR;
8	correct?
9	A. That's correct. It's a Reynolds'
10	document.
11	Q. But it's a document that's actually
12	authored by a third-party; correct?
13	A. Yeah. This is a -- with William
14	Esty, a longtime advertising agency and
15	market research firm or longtime client that
16	worked for R.J. Reynolds is maybe a better
17	way to put it.
18	Q. And he's suggesting ideas for
19	consumer research; correct?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. And we don't know whether or not
22	that consumer research was actually done?
23	A. That's not indicated in this
24	particular document. Esty did do a lot of
25	work for Reynolds in the '70s at this time
0132
1	kind of, you know, with their brands and the
2	like; but, yeah, it was just a description
3	of, in this case, Camel -- Camel Lights and
4	other brands, Doral and Vintage.
5	Q. And what's the date on the
6	document?
7	A. March 5, 1974.
8	Q. So at this time period, Mr. Bowden
9	had already smoked Camel cigarettes; right?
10	A. Right. Regular Camels, right.
11	Q. So there's no evidence that this
12	document or any research that may have been
13	done had any impact on Mr. Bowden?
14	A. Well, this just is a document that
15	indicates the kind of research. It was part
16	of a full-fledged marketing effort called
17	Project Metro which was an attempt to kind
18	of more effectively promote R.J. Reynolds'
19	brands. They were in the 1970s being passed
20	by the Phillip Morris Company and relegated
21	to second tier status in the highly -
22	competitive cigarette industry, and so this
23	--in the Reynolds' documents which Project
24	Metro was a part of in this effort to kind
25	of figure out why they're -- you know, why
0133
1	Philip Morris is doing so well and why
2	they're not doing better.
3	Q. And that's not unusual for
4	companies to do, whether it's the tobacco
5	industry or between Pepsi and Coca-Cola or
6	any industry to figure out why your
7	competitor is having more success with
8	consumer satisfaction than you are; correct?
9	A. Right. No. The difference is in
10	the nature of the product, which is
11	inherently deadly, that kills half of the
12	people that are longtime users. But, no,
13	the methods -- as I said earlier at the
14	beginning of this examination, the methods
15	employed by the industry to discover
16	information about their customers are used
17	by other industries as well.
18	Q. And just to back up to the previous
19	document that talked about placement in
20	movies, that's not unusual either as it
21	relates to the tobacco industry. Other
22	industries try and get their product placed
23	in movies as well; correct?
24	A. That's correct. I mean, you know,
25	the difference is the nature of the product.
0134
1	You know, the tobacco industry had been
2	banned from the -- prohibited from using
3	commercials for --1 totally made a mess of
4	that. Pardon me.
5	The tobacco industry had been
6	banned from the broadcast airwaves. So they
7	were interested in getting their message out
8	to the public and placement in films was one
9	way to work around that. So in that
10	respect, there's a difference.
11	Q. But there was nothing illegal about
12	any tobacco company trying to get their
13	product placed in a movie, was there?
14	A. In a criminal sense, not that I'm
15	aware of in terms of any particular
16	statute. We can deal with, you know, higher
17	orders of ethics on top of that. But, no,
18	I'm not aware of a criminal statute that --
19	that prohibited them from doing this.
20	Q. Anything else about this document
21	that we're looking at, the RJR files?
22	A. No. That's it.
23	Q. All right. This one I'm
24	particularly interested in and this one is
25	document 968257540. And this is a document
0135
1	entitled, "Use Your Ashtray Oregon."
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. So here is my big question. Did
4	Mr. Bowden ever live in Oregon and did he
5	start any forest fires?
6	A. No. No. I just--1 collect
7	references to ashtrays; and although it's
8	not indicated with a Bates number, this is
9	something from the files of the industry. I
10	don't know why the Bates didn't show up. I
11	might have --
12	Q. There is --1 think there is a
13	Bates number for that. I don't know why
14	it's not on the document.
15	A. Okay. Yeah. But, yeah, this is
16	just one of my favorite ashtray references
17	but it's not --
18	Q. Any significance to your opinions
19	in this case?
20	A. No. No. Except people did smoke
21	in their cars, yeah.
22	Q. And they shouldn't throw their
23	butts out the window?
24	A. You know, I know you want to go
25	through your list and I want to go through
0136
1	your list, but, you know, sometimes I get
2	lost in these documents. There's so many to
3	keep up with. I think we all have that
4	problem. But I thought the only thing that
5	I had sent case specific was the motion
6	picture listings of where --
7	Q. I have that, too.
8	A. Okay.
9	Q. We're going to get to that.
10	A. Okay. Good.
11	Q. These are just all the ones, at
12	least that we found, that were on the disc.
13	A. Okay.
14	Q. So you may tell me this has been on
15	my reliance before. It's not new.
16	A. Yeah. I think these are all
17	standard things. I don't recall like, for
18	example, the last two documents that we
19	talked about, selecting them specifically
20	for this case. I think they may have just
21	kind of gotten in the drudge.
22	Q. Fair enough. They may just be new
23	reliance materials. I'm not sure. But
24	let's just make sure and we'll just plow
25	through them as quickly as we can.
0137
1	A. Absolutely.
2	Q. Okay. The next one is 9990202122.
3	This document is entitled, "National
4	Consumer Study of Cigarette Smoking Habits,"
5	Summer of 1953, Summary. Have you seen this
6	document before?
7	A. I sure have, yes.
8	Q. And where did this document come
9	from?
10	A. This is the American Tobacco --in
11	the files of the American Tobacco Company.
12	Q. Okay. And do we know who wrote the
13	document?
14	A. Yeah. A market research firm that
15	appears frequently in the files of the
16	manufacturers Sullivan, Stauffer, Colwell, &
17	Bayles. And let me spell that. Sullivan,
18	S-U-L-L-I-V-A-N, comma; Stauffer, which is
19	S-T-A-U-F-F-E-R, comma; Colwell,
20	C-O-L-W-E-L-L; ampersand Bayles,
21	B-A-Y-L-E-S, Incorporated. And they are
22	kind of a pioneering market research firm.
23	Q. And so I did a quick glance of that
24	document. Is it fair to say that that
25	document is an analysis by that agency about
0138
1	the brand usage by different segments of the
2	population?
3	A. That's correct, yes.
4	Q. And so what they were trying to
5	determine is who's smoking what brand and is
6	there certain brands that fall into a
7	segment that more men use and more women use
8	and those kind of things?
9	A. That's right. And some regional
10	rural/urban characterizations as well. It's
11	pretty -- it's a good picture of the
12	national cigarette market and its segments
13	on the eve of the smoking and health debate
14	as it reached its full elaboration.
15	Q. So the American Tobacco Company was
16	trying to figure out who's smoking their
17	brand and other brands in an effort to try
18	and increase the market share?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. And that's not unique to the
21	tobacco industry. That's kind of research
22	that goes on all the time, even today?
23	A. Yes, that's correct. I mean, these
24	are techniques that are effective in moving
25	products off the shelves, and so the
0139
1	industry availed themselves of that.
2	Q. And any connection at all to your
3	opinions as they relate to Mr. Bowden
4	specifically?
5	A. No. This is an item -- this has
6	been in my files for a long time. That's
7	part of my generic, you know, assessment of
8	the state of the smoking public --
9	Q. Okay.
10	A. --in this case, 1953.
11	MR. THORNE: Off the record for a
12	second.
13
14	(The time is 11:43 a.m.)
15
16	(Whereupon, an off-the-record
17	discussion was held.)
18
19	(The time is 11:43 a.m.)
20
21	Q. All right. This one is document
22	number BW 1966 Blalock, B-L-A-L-O-C-K, in
23	the notebook. Let me hand that to you.
24	A. Thank you.
25	Q. Have you seen that document before?
0140
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. And where does that document come
3	from?
4	A. This is a Brown and Williamson
5	document.
6	Q. And what's the significance of that
7	document in terms of your opinions in this
8	case?
9	A. Yeah. This is a document in which
10	Blalock, who is an official -- a high
11	official with Brown and Williamson, is
12	writing to Addison Yeaman, or Yeaman I think
13	is how you pronounce it, about his
14	assessment as to what the public's knowledge
15	of nicotine is. And he says obviously the
16	key word is confusion and anything we can do
17	to confirm such a situation can work to our
18	advantage.
19	And, you know, it fits into the
20	larger theme of, you know, creating doubt
21	and uncertainty about the various health
22	effects of smoking, including chemical
23	dependency or addiction.
24	Q. And what year is that document?
25	A. This is 1966, October 20th.
0141
1	Q. Any other opinions that you have as
2	it relates to that document or pertains to
3	the Bowden case?
4	A. That's it. Again, I would identify
5	that as part of my more generic analysis.
6	Q. Okay. The next one is noted in the
7	notebook as H&K 1958-02-05-108.11, and this
8	is a document with the letterhead of
9	American Tobacco Company from Paul Hahn to
10	John Hill at Hill and Knowlton. I'll hand
11	you that.
12	A. Yes. This is a famous document.
13	Q. What year is that one dated?
14	A. February 5, 1958.
15	Q. And tell me about your opinions as
16	it relates to this document.
17	A. Well, it was a very famous
18	document. It is a letter to John Hill from
19	the head of the American Tobacco Company, at
20	that time a leading firm, and it's in
21	response to questions posed by Mr. Hill to
22	the heads of all the major companies and
23	they are planning the Tobacco Institute,
24	which will shortly be launched, and he asks
25	Mr. Hahn what is the point of -- he says,
0142
1	what is the area of activities for the
2	institute and what are its major
3	objectives. That's the question. And Paul
4	Hahn responds: "In my opinion, the
5	institute's major area of activity and major
6	objective should be to defend the tobacco
7	industry against attacks from whatsoever
8	source on tobacco as an alleged health
9	hazard, including efforts to impose labeling
10	requirements on tobacco products based
11	directly or indirectly on the charge that
12	tobacco is a health hazard." And it goes on
13	to elaborate his vision for the Tobacco
14	Institute.
15	Q. Now, I know that you've testified
16	before about this document. Is there
17	anything new in terms of your opinions for
18	this case?
19	A. No. This has been a standard item
20	in my reliance for many years. In fact,
21	this is actually a copy that I made and that
22	I got myself from the Wisconsin Historical
23	Society. It has my little chicken scratch
24	at the bottom.
25	Q. Any evidence that Mr. Bowden from
0143
1	the record ever saw any statements from TI?
2	A. Well, there is no --1 can't put
3	him from the record in front of a particular
4	TI statement at a particular point in time
5	at a particular place, but the Tobacco
6	Institute's messages were so widely and
7	extensively disseminated, both directly and
8	indirectly, that he couldn't have helped but
9	encounter these, just as he couldn't have
10	helped but encounter the Surgeon General's
11	report.
12	Q. But you have no evidence from
13	anyone in the record that he actually did
14	see those? You're making a presumption;
15	correct?
16	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
17	the form.
18	A. Yes. I'm making an evaluation to a
19	reasonable degree of historical certainty
20	that he -- based on the fact that he was a
21	smoker, that he lived at a particular time,
22	'50s and '60s, '70s and '80s, in particular
23	that he would have had to have encountered
24	these messages either directly or
25	indirectly. But, again, you're correct in
0144
1	saying that I can't put him in front of a
2	particular message in his hand at a
3	particular point in time and place.
4	Q. All right. This one is numbered HK
5	1953108.12. This one is also from the
6	archives in Wisconsin. It says,
7	"Preliminary Recommendation for Cigarette
8	Manufacturers, December 24, 1953." And at
9	the end it looks like it's from Bert C.
10	Goss.
11	A. Yeah. This is--again, this is
12	something that's been part of my reliance
13	for a long time. And just -- this may not
14	be information that's useful to you, but on
15	the chance this might be, this number
16	convention, 108.12, is one I devised, and it
17	means box 108 of the John Hill papers,
18	folder number 12, if you ever want to check
19	a citation.
20	Q. Maybe in my spare time I'll do
21	that.
22	A. In your spare time. But, yeah,
23	this is a very famous document that relates
24	to the formation of the tobacco industry
25	research committee and is part of the
0145
1	conspiracy and story and I've testified to
2	this before.
3	I don't know if the intention is to
4	ask me about this on the direct exam or not.
5	I didn't testify about these in the last
6	case.
7	Q. But your opinions would be the same
8	about this document as you've given in prior
9	cases; correct?
10	A. I have no new opinions about this
11	document, that's correct.
12	Q. And in 1953, at the time that this
13	was authored, Mr. Bowden was approximately
14	28-years-old; correct?
15	A. Uh-huh.
16	Q. Is that a yes?
17	A. Yeah. Yes. 28, yes.
18	Q. There's no information connecting
19	this document to Mr. Bowden; correct?
20	A. No. This is an internal planning
21	document that reveals really the incredible
22	launching of the TIRC.
23	Q. Good enough.
24	A. And TIRC stands for the Tobacco
25	Institute Research Committee.
0146
1	Q. All right. The next document is HK
2	1953-1215-110.2. Did I pull the right
3	document here? Just a second. Let's do
4	this one first. This one is December 15,
5	1953, also from the achieves in Wisconsin,
6	entitled, "Background Material on the
7	Cigarette Industry Client." Let me hand
8	that to you. Have you seen this document
9	before?
10	A. Yes, I have.
11	Q. Any new opinions as it relates to
12	this document?
13	A. No. No. And I don't know if this
14	is an area where efficiency could be
15	achieved, but all of the Hill and Knowlton
16	documents I have no new opinions about
17	them. You know, my testimony on those is
18	recorded and I have no new opinions specific
19	to this case relating to these 1950's era
20	internal Hill and Knowlton reports.
21	Q. Fair enough. I think we skipped
22	one document, and just so that we've got it
23	on the record, that one in the notebook is
24	marked HK 1953. It's also a Hill and
25	Knowlton document entitled, "Letter of
0147
1	Transmittal to Manufacturers." It appears
2	to be a draft. It says "Hold" at the top.
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. Are you familiar with this one?
5	A. Yes, I am.
6	Q. Any new opinions as it relates to
7	this document?
8	A. No.
9	Q. And we don't know that this one was
10	ever actually sent out; correct? It says
11	"Hold" at the top. It looks like it's a
12	draft.
13	A. Yeah. Let me remind myself. Yeah,
14	you don't have to take it out. Right. This
15	is the draft version. This particular
16	version is a draft version and may not
17	reflect the one that was actually sent out.
18	Q. And the next document in the
19	notebook actually is a "List of Kyriakoudes
20	Additional Reliance Materials" as it's
21	labeled.
22	Let me hand you this document and
23	you may -- while we're doing this, why don't
24	we do a couple at a time. The next one
25	would be entitled, "Kyriakoudes Reliance
0148
1	List," and I think these two go together
2	along with the disc. So why don't you take
3	a look at those two? I'll just hand you the
4	notebook and you can look at them rather
5	than take it out.
6	A. Okay.
7	Q. And as I understand it from Dawn,
8	that the documents that you're looking at
9	now that says "Additional Reliance Material
10	Production Kyriakoudes" is a list of
11	documents that were specific to the Haldeman
12	case and your testimony that were provided
13	shortly before your trial testimony, and the
14	next document that's "Kyriakoudes Reliance
15	Material" is your full reliance list?
16	A. Yes, that's correct. The first one
17	are items used in Haldeman/McEniry. In
18	fact, it has the actual trial exhibit
19	numbers. This is a spreadsheet that I keep
20	that has documents that I'm particularly
21	fond of and I think are pretty, you know,
22	pretty important, but really in terms of my
23	kind of general opinions about the history
24	of the industry; and this goes on and I keep
25	adding to this list.
0149
1	And this list, I may get a chuckle
2	from you, is my attempt to replace what I
3	had previously done, which was to give you
4	guys two or three DVD discs with the actual
5	copies, just kind of organized by folders
6	but not listed, which was a lot of material
7	and not officially organized for your quick
8	dissemination and review.
9	Q. We appreciate the help. We need
10	all we can get.
11	A. Well, you know, we can all be more
12	organized in life, and so that's what this
13	is. And most of these are industry
14	documents and so the links are there so that
15	you can, you know, of course go to them.
16	But a few that are not industry documents
17	have the file names, and already we've
18	talked about some of these, like the
19	background material in the cigarette
20	industry, which was just referenced just a
21	few moments ago. Shall I go farther in the
22	book?
23	Q. Yeah. You seem to have something
24	written in there. You can hold onto it,
25	though. One question that I do have is,
0150
1	since the Haldeman case, are there any new
2	documents that you've added to that list
3	that you haven't told us about?
4	A. Well, I can't remember if they're
5	on this list or not, but I did -- I'll tell
6	you what I did for this case. I went and
7	searched from the Motion Picture Talking
8	Service Company, I believe I'm remembering
9	the name of that properly, the cases in
10	which the film -- the films Answers We Seek
11	and other film The Need to Know, which were
12	two Tobacco Institute produced films.
13	Q. What was the first one?
14	A. Answers We Seek.
15	Q. You can continue.
16	A. And the other -- that was from the
17	late 70s. I think 1976 or 1977. And then
18	an earlier one called Smoking and Health:
19	The Need To Know, which was produced in
20	1972, both by the Tobacco Institute. And
21	the TI contracted with this film
22	distribution service and they set up a
23	mechanism whereby these films could be shown
24	in communities across the country.
25	And so I included a couple of
0151
1	representative examples of where the film
2	had been shown. The films had been shown in
3	Jacksonville, Florida.
4	Q. All right. I think that I saw a
5	clip of The Need To Know on the disc.
6	A. That's correct. I have an edited
7	version of it. The full version is
8	available at archive.org as part of the
9	tobacco industry multimedia collections.
10	And the same is true for Answers We Seek. I
11	don't think I provided a clip for Answers We
12	Seek just because I just didn't have time to
13	download it.
14	Q. Is Answers We Seek, or a clip from
15	that, something that you intend to use as
16	part of your direct examination in this
17	case?
18	A. I don't know. I think it would --
19	it might be a good idea. I mean, I'll have
20	to talk to the attorney about it, but --1
21	mean, I'll tell you how I, you know, would
22	use it. I would probably show the
23	abbreviated clip from Smoking and Health:
24	The Need To Know, because Answers We Seek is
25	essentially a re-edited version of the same
0152
1	footage, as far as I can tell, with a
2	slightly different overlay of narration.
3	And these were shown all over the
4	county and in Jacksonville, and they're just
5	one way to show to the jury the ways -- the
6	many ways in which, in this case, the
7	Tobacco Institute sought to get the message
8	out that cigarette smoking had not been
9	proven to be a cause of any serious disease.
10	Q. Well, I think that we're coming up
11	on some of the documents you're referring to
12	and we'll look at them, but before I forget,
13	you don't have any evidence that Mr. Bowden
14	or any of his family members for that matter
15	saw The Need To Know or Answers We Seek at
16	any of these showings; correct?
17	A. That's correct. Those films do not
18	-- are not mentioned in any of the
19	deposition documents or the deposition
20	testimony that I reviewed. I didn't see it
21	in the testimony. But they were shown in
22	the area and, as I mentioned earlier, these
23	efforts worked two ways, directly and
24	indirectly, you know.
25	Q. One of things that I found amusing
0153
1	when I looked at it was that over 50 percent
2	of the people who filled out the forms said
3	that they would never recommend to a family
4	member to go back to see it.
5	A. Well, the industry did do,
6	particularly for The Need to Know, the first
7	film, they did do opinion research and
8	testing of its effectiveness. But while a
9	certain portion of the population didn't buy
10	the message, particularly among smokers, you
11	know, their own findings, Anne Duffin, and
12	these have long been a part of my reliance
13	materials, indicated that they were able to
14	move the needle, so to speak, to change
15	opinions favorable to the industry.
16	Q. And the people who did the analysis
17	of that was TI in terms of the public
18	opinion on that; correct?
19	A. Yeah. They worked with another
20	firm whose name escapes me right now. But,
21	yeah, the final analysis and evaluation was
22	by TI people.
23	Q. The same people who were
24	distributing the film?
25	A. Yes, they were the same people
0154
1	distributing the film. Yeah, they wanted to
2	know how well it worked. That was their
3	job.
4	Q. And they thought they did a good
5	job?
6	A. Yes. Yeah, that's what their data
7	indicated to them.
8	Q. All right. Let's -- are you okay
9	to continue going?
10	A. I say we push -- off the record.
11
12	(The time is 12:03 p.m.)
13
14	(Whereupon, an off-the-record
15	discussion was held.)
16
17	(The time is 12:03 p.m.)
18
19	Q. Before we do that, let's add your
20	disc. Why don't we make your disc Exhibit
21	No. 8 and I will get that out after we get
22	done before I forget.
23	A. Yeah. I'm the only one that
24	doesn't have a copy of that disc. So --
25	Q. We can have a copy made for you.
0155
1	A. Yeah.
2
3	(Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit No.
4	8 was marked for identification and same is
5	attached hereto.)
6
7	Q. The next document is numbered
8	1003287418. It's entitled, "The New
9	Competition for Marlboro Franchise." It
10	says on the front "Philip Morris, USA
11	Marketing Research, July 1974." Let me hand
12	that to you. Have you seen that document
13	before?
14	A. Yes. I thought we had testified
15	about this in McEniry. If we didn't, we
16	skipped over it, but at one point, we had
17	intended to.
18	It is a market analysis by Philip
19	Morris, you know, on the state of the market
20	and going into some detail, looking at Kool,
21	you know, the menthol brand, which were in a
22	sense becoming a significant factor in the
23	-
24	Q. So --1 didn't mean to interrupt
25	you. But -- so, in essence, this is similar
0156
1	to the American company document that we
2	looked at before that's an analysis where
3	they go out and see who's smoking what brand
4	and what segment of the population they fall
5	into; correct?
6	A. That's correct, yes.
7	Q. And as we talked about before,
8	that's not unusual for tobacco companies or
9	any other companies to go do; correct?
10	A. No. The industry employed methods
11	that had been proven to work to promote
12	their products, and this fundamental market
13	research is part of that effort.
14	Q. Yes. And a lot of times they use
15	outside advertising agency or marketing
16	consulting companies to advise them on what
17	works and what doesn't based on their
18	experience with a variety of different
19	products; correct?
20	A. That's correct. This isn't
21	actually one of those cases. This is an
22	internally-generated report based on Roper
23	data. So it's -- you know, the raw data
24	collected by the Roper Corporation, which
25	was another significant, nationally
0157
1	regulated firm, and then analyzed and
2	interpreted and made useful by the Phillip
3	Morris marketing department.
4	Q. And in '74 Mr. Bowden is in his
5	50s; correct?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. There's no evidence that they did
8	any research in Duval or any of the counties
9	that he lived in, was there?
10	A. This is based on nationally
11	representative random samples of the
12	population. So they may have hit a person
13	in Duval County or not. There's no way to
14	know. That doesn't factor into my
15	opinions. These are just, you know,
16	representative of the U.S. population.
17	Q. Any other opinions as it relates to
18	that document?
19	A. No.
20	Q. All right. The next document is T
21	11977.03.31, and this is the document that
22	you referred to earlier related to, at least
23	your PDF describes it, as "Need To Know."
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. And it is -- at the top says,
0158
1	"Modem Talking Picture Service." Let me
2	hand you this document (indicating).
3	A. Thank you.
4	Q. Can you tell me what that document
5	is?
6	A. Yeah. This is what's called
7	"Certification of Showing." This particular
8	document is dated March 31, 1977, and this
9	is a report to the Tobacco Institute as to
10	where this film was shown; how many people,
11	you know, attended; and the localities that
12	the film was shown; and it includes all of
13	the states that it was shown in this
14	particular period, this month and including
15	Jacksonville and Tyndall Air Force Base.
16	Q. Where does it say Jacksonville on
17	there?
18	A. Right there (indicating).
19	Q. So that -- is there a date for when
20	it was shown in Jacksonville?
21	A. The 2nd of March.
22	Q. And what year?
23	A. This one is 1977. This is
24	representative of -- there's many, many of
25	these.
0159
1	Q. All right. And just to be clear,
2	there's no evidence that Mr. Bowden attended
3	that?
4	A. No. That he directly, yeah. Is
5	this the only one you have?
6	Q. I have others.
7	A. Yeah. But they're all of the same
8	type.
9	Q. The next one is tabbed T
10	11977.10.31.
11	MS. V ALLE JOS - NICHOLS: I think it's
12	actually supposed to be TI.
13	MR. THORNE: Is that what it is?
14	My eyesight is not good enough.
15	MS. V ALLE JOS - NICHOLS: Yeah, TI.
16	Q. TI then.
17	A. Thank you.
18	Q. Can you tell us what that document
19	is?
20	A. This is a similar document to the
21	one I described earlier. Again, another
22	report on certifications of showings for the
23	Smoking and Health, The Need To Know film.
24	And it says total viewers since the start of
25	the program 388,683, and that's nationally.
0160
1	And it lists the various bookings that they
2	had given for this particular month.
3	Q. Any of them in areas where
4	Mr. Bowden lived?
5	A. Well, they indicate Jacksonville,
6	Florida on the 17th of October of that year.
7	Q. Why don't I just ask you once and
8	for all, for all of these documents where we
9	see a reference to Jacksonville, there's no
10	evidence that Mr. Bowden ever saw the film
11	The Need To Know; correct?
12	A. Right. I can't document that
13	Mr. Bowden was one of the audience members
14	in these films. It just shows that the film
15	was shown in his community, though.
16	Q. The next document is TI 1978.04.30.
17	And why don't we kind of lump these
18	together, because I have a feeling they're
19	going to be the same thing and through
20	document number TI 1980.01.31. Let me just
21	have you look at those collectively. I'll
22	just put that tab in there so you'll know
23	where it ends (indicating).
24	A. Sure. Yeah.
25	Q. And tell me what those are.
0161
1	A. Okay. I'm going through the
2	documents and, again, these are as a class
3	essentially the same thing (indicating), you
4	know, the showings of these tobacco and suit
5	propaganda films whose purpose is to instill
6	doubt and confusion in the mind of the
7	public as to the truth of the matter
8	relating to smoking and health. All should
9	have an indicator of a Jacksonville
10	showing. That was my selection process and
11	I just -- you know, Jacksonville, Florida
12	and various states from the 1970s.
13	Q. And one of them at least is Bates
14	stamped 1980. So I assume that that one --
15	if you look at that, I think it says 1980 on
16	the last one. I assume that it takes it up
17	to 1980?
18	A. You're right, January 31, 1980.
19	Correct. And that -- there's two films.
20	They're really two variations of the same
21	footage, one called Smoking and Health:
22	Answers We Seek, which is later, you know,
23	in the late '70s, and Smoking and Health:
24	The Need To Know. But the films are highly
25	similar in their impact, purpose and indeed
0162
1	they seem to be comprised of the same
2	footage, simply re-edited in different ways.
3	Q. All right. So The Need To Know
4	film, the documents that we have just gone
5	through, those relate to showings of that
6	program; correct?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. None of those relate to the showing
9	of Answers We Seek; correct?
10	A. Right. There's two films, two
11	separate films; but again, the films both
12	have essentially the same message and
13	involve interviews with the same experts.
14	My sense is that the footage was
15	all collected as part of one production and
16	you're getting re-edited versions. But
17	that's not as important as knowing that the
18	purpose of both of the films is to persuade
19	the public that the case against the
20	cigarette is unproven and the cigarettes
21	have not been proven to be the cause of any
22	serious disease.
23	Q. The -- do we have any
24	certifications about the showing of Answers
25	We Seek in the documents?
0163
1	A. Yes, we do. So, for example,
2	documents TI 1980.01.31. And the quick and
3	easy way to tell them apart is that the file
4	name of "Answers We Seek" has the word --
5	the phrase Answers We Seek in the file name.
6	So it's Answers We Seek.PDF and The Need To
7	Know should have --
8	Q. And that's on the green piece of
9	paper that's in the middle, so I can kind of
10	differentiate it, or on the file on the CD
11	you provided us ?
12	A. The green sheet of paper but that
13	which reflects the file name.
14	Q. Got you.
15	A. And then you could also look at the
16	document itself. It says at the top. And
17	it was part of this, you know, film program
18	to reach out to the communities across the
19	country. And, you know, of course, they
20	record how many people came, men and women,
21	boys and girls, and then the total. They
22	indicate where they showed it tended to be
23	at high schools, community colleges,
24	hospitals, public -- various public places
25	like the Homemakers Club, you know;
0164
1	Honeywell; Veterans Administration Hospital.
2	I'm just reading from the places.
3	Q. All right. Any other opinions
4	about those documents?
5	A. No.
6	Q. All right. The next one is
7	entitled document number notebook TI
8	1981.02.28 and the PDF also references The
9	Need To Know, and let me hand this to you.
10	It's a little different type of document.
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. Can you tell us what that is?
13	A. Yeah. This is -- has a slightly
14	different cover page which I put in because
15	it seems to reflect the -- perhaps the cover
16	of these documents as they were received by
17	the client, which would be the Tobacco
18	Institute. But what's in it has kind of an
19	explanation of how they showed the films.
20	So that's useful for background
21	(indicating). And then the rest of it is
22	comprised of similar types of "Certification
23	of Showings" as we've been talking about.
24	Q. Do they pay people to watch the
25	film?
0165
1	A. No. The film is -- the Tobacco
2	Institute pays the company to set up
3	showings of the film, which is then free
4	advertised, promoted in the community as
5	kind of a public service film.
6	Q. So the participants don't get any
7	money for attending it?
8	A. I have not found that in the
9	documents.
10	Q. Okay. The next one, I believe, is
11	the film that we talked about -- oh,
12	actually, I take that back. This one is
13	document TIMN 0004654-4657 in the notebook.
14	This document is to William Kloepfer?
15	A. Kloepfer.
16	Q. Kloepfer from Anne Duffin. And it
17	has some red markings on it. Are those your
18	red markings?
19	A. They are. These are my red
20	markings that I put around this, and they're
21	around there because they're the parts that
22	I think are important.
23	Q. You've testified about this
24	document before?
25	A. I have. Yes, I have.
0166
1	Q. Okay. Any new testimony that you
2	would tend to offer in this case regarding
3	that document?
4	A. Nothing new.
5	Q. And this is a document, by the way,
6	that I referenced that said 50 percent of
7	the participants said they wouldn't advise
8	someone to go see it again?
9	A. That's true. But it also says,
10	referencing to various evaluated statements
11	about the relationship of cigarettes and
12	disease, they concluded that of six
13	statements rated four showed significant
14	favorable shifts between viewers and
15	non-viewers, and favorable meaning favorable
16	to the tobacco industry. So generally, the
17	response was that this was an effective --
18	we can go through the whole document if you
19	want, but --
20	Q. No need to. I just found it of
21	interest.
22	A. Yeah.
23	Q. Because I watched it myself, at
24	least the clip you gave me, and so I can't
25	imagine people sitting through it on their
0167
1	own time. But that's why I thought that was
2	kind of interesting.
3	A. Okay. A lot did.
4	Q. Okay. The next one is document
5	TIMN 0078203, and this is a document to TI
6	staff from William Kloepfer, Jr. regarding
7	distribution of The Need To Know dated
8	October 1, 1973. Have you seen that one
9	before?
10	A. Yes. I've testified about this.
11	Q. Okay.
12	A. Would you like to know what I
13	testified about on it?
14	Q. No. Incidentally, it does say in
15	there, I can't remember the exact language
16	in there, that they're not attempting to
17	distribute to youth; correct?
18	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
19	the form.
20	Q. Actually, why don't you just read
21	the language?
22	A. "Our latest report from the
23	distributor states that since the film was
24	released last January 1, some 37,000 persons
25	in community audiences have seen it,
0168
1	including 18,000 men, 9,600 women, 5,400
2	boys and 3,200 girls, plus a few not
3	specified." They also write further up that
4	"The Institute does not initiate showings to
5	youth groups."
6	But as you look at the
7	"Certification of Showings" that, you know,
8	hundreds of -- tens of thousands of youths
9	are seeing this film.
10	Q. Do we know what the age of those
11	people are?
12	A. They refer to them as girls and
13	boys. So that's --
14	Q. Did they refer to them by age?
15	A. They don't.
16	Q. So you're making the inference that
17	they're younger than 18?
18	A. I'm making an inference that when
19	they talk about girls and boys, when they go
20	men and women, girls and boys that certainly
21	girls and boys refers to youths.
22	Q. But we don't know what age those
23	youths are?
24	A. We don't know their precise age.
25	They did not record their precise age.
0169
1	Q. Thank you. Is that all of your
2	opinions about that document? Anything
3	other than what you've testified to before?
4	A. That's it.
5	Q. All right. The next one is TINY
6	0013656-3660. This looks like more of the
7	same. Here you go (indicating).
8	A. Yeah. This is -- again, this is
9	another "Certification of Showing" and
10	you've tagged Florida section. There's no
11	reference to Jacksonville there.
12	Q. You saw my note, didn't you?
13	A. I'm sorry? Oh, I just -- you have
14	a tab with yellow stickies, just to kind of
15	get to the point. But this is the same kind
16	of document.
17	Q. Which film is that for?
18	A. This is for The Need To Know, yeah.
19	And I put red markings around it. I used
20	this one, I think, in an earlier trial and
21	that's what that red --1 put that red box
22	in there to highlight it.
23	Q. All right. The next one is the
24	"Roasting Pamphlet," that's how it's labeled
25	in the notebook. Can you tell us what the
0170
1	title of that is?
2	A. This is an American Tobacco
3	pamphlet that I found in the course of my
4	research. It not indicated, as far as I
5	know, in the on-line industry archives. I
6	got this at what's called the Romaine Trade
7	Catalog Collection at the University of
8	California at San Diego -- the University of
9	California at Santa Barbara. And this is
10	just a standard 1928 Lucky Strike document
11	advertising, you know, in some elaboration,
12	you know, what the toasted phrase means and
13	it promoted Lucky Strike cigarettes. This
14	would be --1 don't know that I've ever
15	testified about this document, but this
16	would be kind of context, background.
17	If I was asked questions about
18	special features of the Lucky Strike
19	cigarette as they were put forth on the
20	marketplace after the introduction of the
21	Lucky Strike in 1917, this might be
22	something I would show as an example of
23	that.
24	Q. And at the time that document was
25	written and copyrighted in 1928, Mr. Bowden
0171
1	was three-years-old?
2	A. That's correct.
3	Q. So it really doesn't have any
4	relevance to Mr. Bowden in particular?
5	A. It has relevance to the Lucky
6	Strike brand and to the extent that he
7	becomes a Lucky Strike smoker, that's the
8	connection. But, you know, this is just a
9	standard, you know, -- it's more about Lucky
10	Strike actually is what this is about. So
11	if I was asked about that brand, that might
12	come up.
13	Q. All right.
14	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Are we
15	getting close to taking that --
16	MR. THORNE: You can take a break
17	anytime you like. Let's take a break.
18	Let's take about 15 minutes.
19
20	(The time is 12:26 p.m.)
21
22	(Whereupon, a short break was
23	taken.)
24
25	(The time is 12:49 p.m.)
0172
2	Q. All right, Dr. Kyriakoudes. I just
3	want to ask you one quick question about
4	Mr. Bowden and compensation. You didn't see
5	anything in the record, did you, when
6	Mr. Bowden switched to a light cigarette,
7	whether it's Winston, Marlboro, or any
8	other, that he started smoking more
9	cigarettes after he made the switch?
10	A. Yeah. I didn't make that kind of
11	evaluation at all. That's not really --
12	that's an individual diagnosis. That's
13	beyond my expertise.
14	Q. And just to be clear--make sure
15	we're clear, likewise, you didn't see
16	anything in the record that somehow he
17	smoked his cigarettes differently?
18	A. I didn't make an evaluation either
19	way. So that's just not an area I have an
20	opinion on, on his personal smoking
21	compensation behavior.
22	Q. And you saw nothing in the record
23	that Mr. Bowden ever switched for any
24	significant period of time to any ultra
25	light or other lower tar cigarettes than the
0173
1	Winston Light and the Marlboro Light that
2	were a more regular cigarette as described
3	by his family?
4	A. No. Those were the light brands
5	that I saw him use.
6	Q. All right. I want to talk to you
7	about a couple of documents, all of which
8	you've seen before or at least know about,
9	just to make sure that I've got your
10	opinions. The first document pertains to
11	attempts by Philip Morris, in this case
12	Philip Morris Europe, to get their
13	cigarettes in movies. You're familiar with
14	the Superman II documents?
15	A. I am, yes.
16	Q. And that is the only document with
17	the Phillip Morris name that you're familiar
18	with in which Philip Morris, whether it's
19	Philip Morris Europe or Philip Morris USA,
20	ever attempted to get its cigarettes placed
21	in movies; correct?
22	A. No, I don't think so. There are --
23	that's one that I've used and testified
24	about, but I believe --1 mean, there are
25	other documents that indicate -- that's an
0174
1	especially blatant case, but I believe
2	Philip Morris is involved in product
3	placement as well.
4	Q. Okay. You don't have any other
5	documents that you can think of off the top
6	of your head, do you?
7	A. No. I wasn't prepared to get
8	others but I'll --
9	Q. Well, the reason I raised it is you
10	talked about in your earlier testimony about
11	the companies generally, and I just wanted
12	to isolate specifically as to your opinions
13	about Philip Morris since you appear that
14	that's a topic you're going to testify about
15	at trial.
16	A. Right. Yeah, Philip Morris also
17	was involved in working to promote its
18	products through these, you know, various
19	means like the other companies.
20	Q. Now, I'm not going to spend a lot
21	of time talking about Superman II, but you
22	know that Superman II, the attempts to get
23	that movie put in -- excuse me. Let me
24	rephrase the question. The attempt to have
25	Marlboro appear in Superman II were the
0175
1	efforts of Philip Morris Europe; correct?
2	A. That's right. So you can go back
3	to the annual reports of the Philip Morris
4	company from the '60s when they divided the
5	company up into a European operating
6	division, domestic operating division.
7	These are all parts of essentially the same
8	company.
9	Q. Well, you know that they're
10	separate and distinct companies; correct?
11	There's one that's called Morris Europe,
12	there's one that's Philip Morris USA;
13	correct?
14	A. Yes, they're legally separate, but
15	they were set up by Philip Morris to run
16	their European business.
17	Q. And there's no evidence that anyone
18	from Philip Morris USA was involved in the
19	efforts to try and get Marlboro to appear in
20	Superman II; correct?
21	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
22	the form.
23	A. Well, you know, when they set up
24	the European operating division, it was one
25	of the Colemans that was head of the
0176
1	European Division. You know, one of Joe
2	Coleman's relatives, I forget which relation
3	it was. And of course Philip Morris, at the
4	time that we're talking about, had a very
5	strong family identification through the
6	Coleman family, a prominent tobacco family
7	in New York. I just haven't researched that
8	particular thing.
9	I mean, the key take-away point is
10	that this is the Marlboro product being put
11	in Superman II, particularly after Superman
12	I had noticeable anti-cigarette references
13	in it. Superman looks at Lois Lane, uses
14	his x-ray vision, and says you shouldn't
15	smoke in Superman I. In Superman II, they
16	work hard to roll that back. It's -- this
17	is just simply the European Division of the
18	company. It's a global company with many
19	operating units.
20	Q. And I guess going back to my
21	original question just so we're clear, you
22	didn't find any documentation that
23	individuals from Philip Morris USA, who's
24	the defendant in this case, was involved in
25	the attempts to place Marlboro in Superman
0177
1	II?
2	A. I found evidence that employees of
3	Philip Morris affiliated companies were
4	involved in this.
5	Q. And that's Philip Morris Europe?
6	A. That's right, a Philip Morris
7	affiliated company.
8	Q. Going back to my question, though,
9	you saw no document that says someone from
10	Philip Morris USA was involved in the
11	attempts to distribute -- or I'm sorry, in
12	attempts to get Marlboro in the Superman II
13	film?
14	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
15	the form.
16	A. The contract is between the
17	European operating division of Philip
18	Morris.
19	Q. All right. Let me move on to
20	another document. I don't know if you've
21	testified about this before but it involves
22	chocolate cigarettes.
23	A. In the 1940s.
24	Q. Yes. And Little Johnny.
25	A. Yes, I have seen these.
0178
1	Q. Okay. So you've seen -- it's a
2	document and is the one that I said that I
3	did not have with me but I think you're
4	familiar with it. It's the correspondence
5	from Gus Wayne to Mr. Gallagher "Re: Sales
6	Promotion." Are you familiar with that?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. And that's a document in which Gus
9	Wayne was one of the bellhops. Are you
10	familiar with that?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. He suggested that maybe the company
13	should have chocolate cigarettes. Are you
14	familiar with that?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. And you know that Philip Morris
17	never actually made chocolate cigarettes;
18	correct?
19	A. That's true. Other people did make
20	candy cigarettes but not Philip Morris.
21	Q. Philip Morris never made candy
22	cigarettes?
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. And when they found out that people
25	were using some likeness of a Marlboro, they
0179
1	let them know that that was unacceptable and
2	sought legal retribution for that; correct?
3	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
4	the form.
5	A. Well, I mean, the story of industry
6	tolerance for trademark violation for candy
7	cigarettes is more complicated than you
8	indicate. There was a period of time,
9	particularly closer to the time that you're
10	talking about, obviously not Marlboro
11	related, in which the industry as a whole,
12	their tolerance for what most people might
13	consider blatant trademark infringement was
14	quite high in the candy cigarette field.
15	That's been documented and there's been
16	secondary literature published on that in
17	The Journal of Tobacco Control and other
18	places. I think your reference to Marlboro
19	comes much later.
20	Q. But there's no evidence at all that
21	Philip Morris ever made any candy cigarette?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. All right. That's all the
24	questions I have for you about that
25	document.
0180
1	Project Magic. You're familiar
2	with Project Magic?
3	A. Oh, there's so many projects. This
4	is one that --1 think I've got some
5	documents related to this actually. Help me
6	remember.
7	Q. I can show you the documents that
8	pertain to this and maybe it will refresh
9	your recollection. I'll give you the -- let
10	me have the tab that's --
11	A. Oh, sure. Yeah. Keep your note
12	there. You can take that and pull it off if
13	you need. Great.
14	Q. I tried to highlight it the best I
15	could for you so that you would have it.
16	A. Uh-huh. Sure.
17	Q. But this is a project, once again,
18	that's for Philip Morris Europe or
19	International?
20	A. Yes. This is -- yeah, this is
21	fundamental sociological research. I
22	remember now. Yeah, I talk about this.
23	These are -- oh, these are multiple copies
24	of the same document.
25	Q. They may be. I probably handed you
0181
1	my copy, too.
2	A. Yeah. Take your copy (indicating).
3	Q. There's probably two of each one
4	there.
5	A. Yeah. Yeah, I got it.
6	Q. And, really, the point that I want
7	to make with this document with you is that
8	this -- this is a project that was done, as
9	you can see from the letterhead, in either
10	London or Switzerland; correct?
11	A. Well, yeah, London. Uh-huh.
12	Q. And there's other documents in
13	there that -- interoffice correspondence
14	that relate to Switzerland and the project
15	being implemented in Germany; correct?
16	A. Yeah. I mean, Philip Morris is a
17	global company involved in selling its
18	product all over the world, just as, you
19	know, B-A-T, Brown and Williamson were. A
20	very strong global presence, yeah.
21	Q. So -- but Project Magic was
22	something that was European; correct? It
23	was not done in the U.S.?
24	A. Well, it's emanating from the
25	European side of the company, right. But
0182
1	it's part of the body of, in this case, what
2	I would call kind of theoretical knowledge
3	that the industry is developing about the
4	nature of smoking and a smoker's behavior
5	and wants and needs.
6	Q. Well, Magic was never manufactured
7	or sold in the United States; correct?
8	A. That's correct. That's correct.
9	This is more -- you know, the significance
10	here is more in terms of just kind of
11	fundamental knowledge about smoking and its
12	meaning in people's lives, that kind of
13	anthropological positioning of the smoking
14	act.
15	Q. By the way, you're aware, aren't
16	you, that the smoking age in different
17	countries in Europe is -- at times has been
18	less than the United States? In other
19	words, where it might be 18 in the U.S., in
20	other companies, like Germany, it was age
21	16; correct?
22	A. Right. In many American states, it
23	was also 16 earlier in the 20th Century as
24	well. Yeah, there are variations like that.
25	MR. THORNE: That's all the
0183
1	questions I have for you. I'll pass the
2	baton and let Kurt ask questions. And I'll
3	just go back and make sure that I didn't
4	miss anything, but I appreciate your time.
5	THE WITNESS: Oh, you're welcome.
6	MR. THORNE: And don't forget to
7	remind me to give you your check in case I
8	forget.
9	THE WITNESS: You can do that now.
10	Put it on the record, that way you can't say
11	that I didn't receive it.
12	MR. THORNE: Here, we'll mark it as
13	our next exhibit number.
14
15	(Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit No.
16	9 was marked for identification and same is
17	attached hereto.)
18
19	MR. THORNE: There is
20	Dr. Kyriakoudes's check (indicating).
21	THE WITNESS: Thank you very much.
22	Into the wallet so I don't lose it.
23	EXAMINATION
24	BY MR. COPPER:
25	Q. Hello again, Mr. Kyriakoudes. I am
0184
1	Kurt Copper from Jones Day. We met off the
2	record earlier. We represent the defendant,
3	R.J. Reynolds, in this case. I will try to
4	avoid ground that's already been covered.
5	So I apologize in advance for jumping around
6	a bit, but I'll try and streamline this as
7	best I can.
8	In the case-specific materials that
9	you reviewed, there was no witness who could
10	testify as to the circumstances surrounding
11	William Bowden's first cigarette; is that
12	correct?
13	A. When you say "first," you mean his
14	very, very first cigarette ever?
15	Q. The first cigarette that he did
16	smoke, yes.
17	A. No. There's simply testimony that,
18	you know, before he went into the Army he
19	was smoking as a teenager.
20	Q. So we don't know when he smoked
21	that first cigarette?
22	A. That's true. And based on what we
23	know about smoking initiation and the
24	history of smoking initiation and the kind
25	of history of smoking behavior, it's very
0185
1	likely that he had smoked before even his
2	cousin had identified, or indicated is more
3	accurate.
4	Q. And there's no witness who has
5	testified as to the brand of cigarette that
6	he had as that first cigarette; is that
7	correct?
8	A. Again, yeah. This is going back 70
9	years. You know, we do get brand
10	information later that he's a regular smoker
11	of Camel and Lucky Strike.
12	Q. We had some discussion earlier
13	about Mrs. Bowden smoking, Gloria smoking.
14	Do you recall reviewing her testimony where
15	she said that she had quit when her son
16	Michael was born?
17	A. I seem to recall she said that,
18	yes. I didn't focus on her behavior too
19	much but I do remember that, yes.
20	Q. And do you recall testimony that
21	Michael was born in 1953?
22	A. Yes, that's correct.
23	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
24	the form.
25	A. Yes, that's when he was bom.
0186
1	Q. The first document in Exhibit 7
2	that you discussed earlier was a lengthy
3	document regarding movies. Do you remember
4	that discussion?
5	A. Yes, I do.
6	Q. Do you mind if I step over and show
7	you?
8	A. No. Please come. Yeah, let's make
9	this as easy as possible.
10	Q. And this was a document -- first of
11	all, you had said, if I understood you
12	correctly, you don't know for sure that
13	Mr. Bowden ever saw any of these movies; is
14	that correct?
15	A. Right. I have not made an attempt
16	to do that, and there's not much discussion
17	of film in the deposition record.
18	Q. Okay.
19	A. Or a specific film.
20	Q. Okay. I apologize these pages are
21	not numbered as to this document, but a few
22	pages in, there's a discussion of a film
23	entitled, Black Glass in 1988; is that
24	right?
25	A. You read that correctly.
0187
1	Q. Okay. Are you aware as to whether
2	any such film was ever actually created?
3	A. No. No. This is all kind of --
4	you know, these documents indicate efforts
5	to promote films. Films don't get
6	produced. They don't -- if they do get
7	produced, their names are changed. And this
8	is just one snapshot of that process in the
9	movie-making industry. So, no. No, there
10	may be films in there that weren't made.
11	There are certainly films that one could
12	easily recognize as having been made.
13	Q. So we don't know if at least some
14	of the films in this document were actually
15	ever made?
16	A. That's correct. No. What we know
17	from these documents is that the industry
18	worked with an entertainment marketing
19	company to vigorously seek to place American
20	Tobacco products in films. Do they have a
21	thousand percent batting average, no, but
22	they certainly have a good batting average.
23	Q. So there -- strike that. Did you
24	see any evidence that Mr. Bowden ever smoked
25	a Carlton cigarette?
0188
1	A. I am not recollecting seeing
2	Carlton off the top of my head as I sit
3	here.
4	Q. Did you ever -- did you see any
5	case-specific evidence that Mr. Bowden ever
6	smoked a Salem cigarette?
7	A. No. I didn't see any reference to
8	menthols and that would include Salem.
9	Q. And you had mentioned, I think,
10	Pall Mall briefly earlier. Did you ever see
11	any indication that Pall Mall was
12	Mr. Bowden's primary brand at any point in
13	time?
14	A. No. There's just a reference to it
15	as in the mix more toward the earlier part
16	of his smoking career.
17	Q. You --1 want to make sure I
18	understood your testimony earlier. You had
19	said that you're not going to offer any
20	opinions as to whether Mr. Bowden was
21	addicted to cigarettes; is that right?
22	A. Yeah, I can't offer any kind of
23	medical diagnosis because I don't do that.
24	That's not my area of expertise. I'm a
25	historian.
0189
1	Q. When is your assessment of when
2	Mr. Bowden entered the military?
3	A. I believe he entered in 1942.
4	There's a military service document in there
5	that lists his date of induction. My
6	recollection is it's 1942.
7	Q. The Frank Statement was issued in
8	1954; is that right?
9	A. In January, yes.
10	Q. So you would agree that Mr. Bowden
11	began smoking at least ten years before the
12	Frank Statement was issued?
13	A. Yeah, that's accurate at least.
14	Q. Would you agree that because
15	Mr. Bowden started smoking at least ten
16	years before the Frank Statement was issued
17	that the alleged conspiracy of the tobacco
18	company could not have caused him to start
19	smoking?
20	A. Well, no, it wouldn't have caused
21	him to start smoking. That's actually kind
22	of -- that wasn't the point of the
23	conspiracy. The point of conspiracy was to
24	keep people smoking, to persuade people that
25	cigarettes were not the cause of any
0190
1	disease, and that meant -- you know, I mean,
2	people start smoking but then people quit.
3	And, you know, the industry is interested in
4	people starting smoking but they're also
5	interested in people not quitting. So
6	there's two elements there.
7	Q. Is it accurate to say that in the
8	case-specific materials that you reviewed,
9	no testifying witness has described
10	Mr. Bowden smoking in the military?
11	A. Well, nobody has firsthand
12	descriptions of his military smoking. There
13	are descriptions of when he comes back from
14	service or on leave that he's smoking
15	Camels, Lucky Strikes. That's as close as
16	you can get.
17	Q. So no testifying witness has
18	firsthand knowledge of his smoking during
19	the time when he was in the military?
20	A. That's correct. Again, we're
21	dealing with 70 years in the past. He --
22	you know, there's no kind of fellow
23	servicemen that have been deposed, as far as
24	I can tell, that were stationed with him
25	somewhere.
0191
1	Q. All right. And during his time in
2	the military, his wife didn't know if he had
3	purchased his cigarettes or smoked the ones
4	that were given to him in his rations; is
5	that correct?
6	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
7	the form.
8	A. Well, no, she doesn't know that.
9	But again, if you learn a little bit about
10	how the rations system worked, you're
11	talking about -- you're question implies
12	we're really dealing with kind of the second
13	tour of duty or second period of service.
14	You know, C and K rations, which included
15	cigarettes, were field rations. But if he's
16	at a base, you know, overseeing basic
17	training and the other tasks that he was
18	charged with, then he would be eating in the
19	regular camp mess and so then his cigarettes
20	he would have -- he would have purchased
21	them at the PX or the post exchange.
22	Q. And from the case-specific
23	materials that you reviewed, we just don't
24	know the circumstances surrounding him
25	getting those cigarettes while he was
0192
1	smoking in the military then?
2	A. No. But, I mean, you don't have to
3	be -- you're not dealing with, you know,
4	complicated, reasonable historical
5	inferences here. He's got two periods of
6	service. The first period of service, as
7	indicated by the service report, is he is
8	involved in the Pacific campaign and so his
9	cigarettes would have come two ways. He
10	would have purchased some at the various
11	post exchanges that were set up as part of
12	the movement of the U.S. troops to the
13	Pacific fighting the Japanese. But when
14	distributed with the field rations in the
15	field, C and K rations, he would have also
16	had cigarettes included in those.
17	And then, just because he got those
18	cigarettes there, it's true that, you know,
19	your brand was kind of determined by how,
20	you know, the ration was packaged, but
21	people could trade them. And there was all
22	manner of ways of kind of moving the brand
23	around. So you just don't know.
24	But we do know that when he comes
25	back, he is smoking Camels and Lucky
0193
1	Strikes, and those are the two most popular
2	brands at the time anyway. So that's what
3	he was smoking. That's my opinion.
4	Q. Do you have an opinion as to
5	whether Mr. Bowden was smoking during the
6	time that he spent in the military prison?
7	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
8	the form.
9	A. Well, yes. We know from lots of
10	research that in prisons of all types
11	smoking is one of the most prevalent
12	activities, that you get the entire prison
13	economy is based around the use of
14	cigarettes as a kind of currency. So the
15	role of the cigarette and incarceration,
16	there's been anthropological research on
17	this, is significant. There's a lot of
18	smoking in prison, often because there's not
19	much else to do.
20	Q. Do you have an opinion as to what
21	brand you believe Mr. Bowden was smoking
22	while he was in the military prison?
23	A. No, I don't.
24	Q. All right. Did you see any case-
25	specific evidence that provided detail as to
0194
1	Mr. Bowden's smoking during his time in the
2	military prison?
3	A. I didn't see anything in my review.
4	If it's there, I missed it or I didn't see
5	it.
6	Q. In your review of Mrs. Bowden's
7	deposition, did you see a discussion of her
8	family's history with Orem's Restaurants and
9	Candy Stores?
10	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
11	the form.
12	A. Yeah. Her side of the family, her
13	father seemed to have been involved in the
14	restaurant business, yes.
15	Q. As part of this case, have you done
16	any sort of research or investigation into
17	the history of that business?
18	A. No. It doesn't seem relevant to my
19	opinions. I mean, she indicates that they
20	did sell cigarettes there. That's good
21	enough for me.
22	Q. So you did note that they sold
23	cigarettes at the -- at that business?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. Okay. And did you note that -- her
0195
1	testimony that the business was ultimately
2	sold for over a million dollars?
3	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
4	the form.
5	A. Well, she indicates that they did
6	sell the business.
7	Q. And they sold the business for over
8	a million dollars?
9	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
10	the form.
11	A. Well, they didn't indicate what the
12	net price was, so it's hard to say what the
13	net was, but she does mention that. Of
14	course, you know, most businesses carry some
15	kind of debt burden. So it's hard to know
16	what the net was.
17	Q. Do you recall her testimony that as
18	a result of the sale of that business a
19	trust was established for her mother and her
20	sister and herself that contained over a
21	million dollars?
22	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Relevance.
23	A. They mentioned some reference of
24	the trust. I didn't -- you know, this
25	seemed to me far afield from Mr. Bowden's
0196
1	smoking history. So it plays no role
2	whatsoever in my opinions.
3	Q. You had mentioned earlier some
4	reference to potential quit attempts in the
5	record that you had reviewed. I just want
6	to make sure I understood your testimony.
7	Now, you said that those do not have a
8	relevance to your opinions in this
9	particular case; is that right?
10	A. Yeah. I mean, I'm not going to
11	give --1 don't intend to give
12	individualized testimony about Mr. Bowden's
13	level of addiction.
14	Often people that have that
15	expertise will take into account quit
16	attempts in those areas. You know, quitting
17	only touches on my opinions in a generic way
18	in that what I said earlier applies, and
19	that is, you know, the industry is involved
20	in kind of both ends of the industry -- let
21	me rephrase that. Both ends of the market.
22	You know, they're working assiduously to
23	recruit new smokers and they're also working
24	assiduously with great energy to persuade
25	those who are smoking that instead of
0197
1	quitting they should try alternative
2	products, such as filters, lights, low tars,
3	and the matter. That's part of the history
4	of the tobacco industry and their efforts to
5	promote their products.
6	Q. And regardless of whether
7	Mr. Bowden had attempted to quit smoking or
8	not, those opinions of yours would remain
9	the same?
10	A. That's correct.
11	Q. What's your current position?
12	A. At the University?
13	Q. Yes.
14	A. I'm a professor of history and
15	director of the center for oral history and
16	cultural heritage.
17	Q. When were you promoted to full
18	professor?
19	A. It took effect at the beginning of
20	the fiscal year or the new school year.
21	Q. Had you done certain things in
22	order to receive the promotion?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. And what were the steps that you
25	had to fulfill in order to receive that
0198
1	promotion?
2	A. Well, it's not quite like a
3	checklist. We have these standards that's
4	based on reputation, impact, and scholar
5	achievements. I had a mix of publishing a
6	book, winning a significant number of
7	grants -- competitive grants, service to the
8	university, service to the state. A variety
9	of those things. You put together a
10	portfolio of what you've done and that's
11	reviewed by a committee and then it goes to
12	another committee and then it goes to
13	another committee. It kind of works its way
14	up, and then the president of the university
15	agrees or disagrees.
16	Q. What was the book that you had
17	published?
18	A. The second book, an edited
19	collection of essays called Transformations
20	of the South, 1790 to 1860. Sort of an
21	economic and social history of the
22	antebellum south. And then that mixed with
23	some important grants I think was, you know,
24	what was important in getting a favorable
25	result.
0199
1	Q. Did that include a -- did that
2	promotion include an increase in your
3	current salary?
4	A. I got a bit of a raise, yes.
5	Q. Congratulations. What was the
6	raise?
7	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
8	the form.
9	A. I believe it was 55 or $5,700,
10	$5,600 maybe. Something like that. I'm
11	certainly not going to put a down payment on
12	a villa in the south of France on that. I'm
13	making a joke.
14	Q. So your salary for -- I'm sorry.
15	That is the difference between your salary
16	for 2012 and then 2013?
17	A. Yeah. My salary --1 think this
18	year's salary is 67,800 -- $67,800 for nine
19	months. And then I teach in overload. You
20	know, I'm on the schedule for summer school.
21	So it usually comes out a bit ahead of that.
22	Q. You've never worked for an
23	advertising agency; right?
24	A. Not an advertising agency. I
25	worked for -- after college, I worked for an
0200
1	advertising -- a media company and radio
2	print advertising called The Village
3	Companies that owned two FM stations, a
4	phone directory business, a mall advocate,
5	village advocate and I sold advertising.
6	Q. Okay. You haven't designed or
7	created an advertising campaign of any kind;
8	is that fair?
9	A. Yeah, that's true. That's true.
10	I'm a historian of advertising, not a
11	practitioner of the current state of art.
12	Q. If a manufacturer of a consumer
13	product today wanted to develop and place an
14	advertising campaign, they would look to
15	someone else to help with all of that?
16	A. They would. I could help them
17	develop an advertising campaign that might
18	have worked in 1955 but not today.
19	MR. THORNE: That makes you a
20	relic.
21	THE WITNESS: Yes. The historian's
22	curse. We know all about the past, which
23	even the contemporary practitioners, you
24	know --1 mean, advertising people don't
25	have a strong sense of current history. So
0201
1	it's interesting.
2	MR. THORNE: I know that by
3	watching Mad Men.
4	THE WITNESS: Yes. Well, there's
5	problems with that show.
6	Q. You agree that there's no evidence
7	in this case that Mr. Bowden ever smoked a
8	menthol cigarette?
9	A. I didn't see any menthol smoking in
10	my review of the evidence.
11	Q. Okay. You are not an expert in
12	cigarette design; right?
13	A. No. I know a great -- well, I
14	mean, some of my expertise touches on the
15	history of cigarette design to the extent
16	that filters, lights, and low tars are
17	design elements. In the history of
18	cigarette design, because the design and the
19	marketing and the promotion are so clearly
20	intertwined, there is overlap there. But
21	I'm not going to offer opinions on, you
22	know, contemporary cigarette design and kind
23	of cigarette engineering and those things.
24	Q. You're not going to tell the jury
25	in this case that if Mr. Bowden had never
0202
1	smoked a Winston cigarette that he would
2	have avoided his disease and death; right?
3	A. Well, my own feeling is if he had
4	never smoked cigarettes, he would not
5	have -- he would have avoided the diseases
6	that he suffered from, but that's not
7	really -- that's not my area of expertise,
8	so I'm not going to offer medical testimony
9	even if it's kind of counter-factual,
10	hypothetical medical testimony about his
11	individualistic condition.
12	Q. You are not going to testify to the
13	jury in this case that had Mr. Bowden
14	continued to smoke full-flavored cigarettes
15	during the entirety of the time that he
16	smoked as opposed to sometimes smoking
17	filtered cigarettes that he would have
18	avoided his -- I'm sorry, strike that.
19	You are not going to tell the jury
20	in this case that had Mr. Bowden smoked
21	full-flavored cigarettes for the entirety of
22	the time that he smoked as opposed to ever
23	smoking a filtered cigarette that in that
24	case he would have avoided his disease and
25	death; correct?
0203
1	A. Correct. I'm not going to offer
2	medical testimony about Mr. Bowden,
3	including counter-factual or hypothetical
4	medical testimony based on different
5	behaviors.
6	Again, for my opinions, the
7	cigarette design and the type of cigarettes
8	that he smoked are important in the sense
9	that these different products, filters,
10	lights, low tars were marketed by the
11	industry as being healthier, and we know
12	from the Surgeon General's reports and the
13	National Cancer Institute studies that they
14	weren't healthier just as a matter of kind
15	of historical analysis, but I'm not going to
16	offer medical testimony on his physical
17	condition. I'm not a medical doctor.
18	Q. You're not going to testify that he
19	would have been able to quit sooner if he
20	had smoked a different brand of cigarette
21	than he did; correct?
22	A. I'm not going to offer testimony to
23	that effect, no. That, to me, is along the
24	lines of, you know, individual
25	pharmacological assessments of his -- there
0204
1	are others that are qualified to make that
2	evaluation. I'm not one of them.
3	Q. We had a discussion of this
4	document earlier, which is the second
5	document in the binder marked as Exhibit 7,
6	and this particular document was one
7	authored by the William Esty Company dated
8	March 5, 1974; is that right?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And this document was -- it appears
11	to have been sent to Mr. T.L. Ogbum, Jr.;
12	is that right?
13	A. That's correct.
14	Q. Again, there was no evidence that
15	you've seen that Mr. Bowden ever saw this
16	particular document; is that correct?
17	A. That's correct. This is an
18	internal document about market research on
19	smoking.
20	Q. And the document references the
21	Esty Company's early thoughts in the process
22	of potentially conducting consumer studies?
23	A. Yes. Consumer perception studies,
24	yes.
25	Q. And you aren't aware as to whether
0205
1	the Esty Company performed the specific
2	follow-up studies that are discussed as
3	potential studies in this particular
4	document; is that right?
5	A. Well, Project Metro was a
6	significant market research effort by the
7	Reynolds Tobacco Company and so there was a
8	lot of effort put into that. The
9	correspondence and documentation on that is
10	quite voluminous and so they did do a
11	significant project metro study looking at
12	cigarette smokers and the general public
13	smokers' perceptions of the products among
14	metropolitan areas.
15	Q. But you can't point me to a
16	specific document that was created as a
17	result of that document; is that correct?
18	A. Those documents exist. You know,
19	again, there's so many in the industry files
20	and you've, you know, asked about a
21	particular thread. But, yeah. No, those
22	documents do exist. I've seen them, I have
23	reviewed them and have identified many
24	others that I've yet to fully review. It
25	was a big deal. So that's a significant --
0206
1	that is kind of an indicator of a
2	significant market research effort, yeah.
3	Q. There was no evidence that you
4	reviewed in this case that Mr. Bowden
5	changed the way that he smoked when he began
6	smoking filtered cigarettes; correct?
7	A. Now, when you say that, you're
8	meaning the physical description, you know,
9	the inhalation patterns, and I did not make
10	an evaluation of that in my review of the
11	evidence. I don't--again, that's not
12	something that I considered to be part of my
13	opinions. So I can't make --1 can't really
14	give you an answer as to whether there's no
15	evidence to that fact. I can say that
16	that's not an area that I intend to testify
17	about.
18	Q. So you don't intend to testify that
19	Mr. Bowden changed either the amount he
20	smoked or the way in which he smoked
21	cigarettes after beginning to smoke filtered
22	cigarettes?
23	A. Well, that's correct. I'm not
24	going to offer that individualized testimony
25	about his own smoking practice.
0207
1	Q. And there's no evidence that you
2	reviewed that Mr. Bowden ever sought out a
3	cigarette with the lowest machine-measured
4	tar and nicotine yields, is there?
5	A. All I know is what is reported by
6	his daughter and by his wife, which is that
7	he understood that light cigarettes were
8	safer. Whether he sought out the absolute
9	lowest, there's no indication either way.
10	You know, just because it doesn't say it,
11	doesn't mean he didn't do it. It's just
12	that there's no evidence either way for that
13	from what I recall reading.
14	Q. But you are aware that there were
15	brands in existence in the 1980s that had
16	lower tar and nicotine yields than the
17	brands that Mr. Bowden smoked; correct?
18	A. There's variation among brands and
19	that was one area in which the industry
20	sought to compete. You know, Merit. For
21	example, Basic, which does get mentioned in
22	there, was another very low brand. But, you
23	know, the --1 just don't have an opinion on
24	that based on what I reviewed.
25	Q. So you don't have an opinion based
0208
1	on what you reviewed about whether
2	Mr. Bowden ever selected a brand of
3	cigarettes based on the tar and nicotine
4	units?
5	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
6	the form.
7	A. Well, I mean, light -- that's going
8	too far, because light cigarettes are
9	cigarettes with lower tar and nicotine.
10	That's a different question than the one you
11	just asked me, which was did he make -- the
12	first question was, did he make some -- is
13	there evidence that he made a conscious
14	decision to smoke the lowest. It just
15	doesn't say either way. We just don't know.
16	So I can't offer an opinion on that. But we
17	do know that he did select cigarettes that
18	had lighter, you know, or lower tar and
19	nicotine yields because he moved toward
20	light cigarettes and did so for a health
21	reason.
22	Q. Let me go back to a document that
23	you discussed earlier --
24	A. Sure.
25	Q. -- that includes a reference to
0209
1	Mr. Blalock that's dated October 20, 1966.
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And this is part of Exhibit 7. In
4	1966, what brands do you believe Mr. Bowden
5	was smoking?
6	A. In '66, he's -- that exact year, I
7	can't say. All I can say is that he's
8	making -- around this time and afterwards,
9	he's making the transition from his older
10	brands, Camel and Lucky, towards the next
11	phase of his smoking, which is Winston and
12	Marlboro.
13	Q. What company manufactures candy
14	cigarettes?
15	A. The R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
16	Q. And what company manufactures Lucky
17	Strikes you said?
18	A. At that time, the American Tobacco
19	Company, but now part of the Reynolds
20	American or R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company
21	business.
22	Q. Are you aware as to whether
23	Mr. Bowden ever saw this particular document
24	that was referenced earlier, the Blalock
25	document from October 20, 1966?
0210
1	A. This is an internal memo. So the
2	purpose of this document is not to say that
3	he saw this. This document is an indicator
4	of an industry strategy to kind of prey on
5	and capitalize upon the doubt and confusion
6	in the mind of the public about cigarette's
7	health and addiction. So, no, I can't
8	imagine that he had seen this document.
9	Q. In the late 1960s, you had said
10	that you had reviewed the deposition
11	transcript of Mr. Bowden's adopted son who
12	had discussed with him the potential health
13	effects of smoking?
14	A. That's discussed, yes.
15	Q. Okay. Did you see any reference in
16	the documents that you reviewed that were
17	case-specific materials to Mr. Bowden
18	arguing with his son at the time about the
19	potential health effects of smoking?
20	A. I didn't see anything on that
21	issue.
22	Q. Okay.
23	A. If it's in there, I missed it.
24	When you say "potential health," you're not
25	implying that it's uncertain that cigarette
0211
1	smoking causes disease personally on your
2	part?
3	Q. I'm not trying to imply anything
4	with my questions. I was just asking you.
5	A. Okay. Good.
6	MR. COPPER: Do you mind if we take
7	just a two-minute break? I'm almost done.
8	I want to look for a few things.
9	THE WITNESS: Sure. Yeah.
10	MR. THORNE: I've got two
11	questions. Do you want me to ask them to
12	you now?
13	THE WITNESS: Sure. You do?
14	Official questions? Absolutely, yeah.
15	EXAMINATION
16	BY MR. THORNE:
17	Q. I think it will be just two
18	questions. Do you recall from the testimony
19	of Gloria Bowden and her daughter, Tammy,
20	that they both indicated that their dad
21	never said that he thought it was safe to
22	smoke light cigarettes; correct?
23	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
24	the form.
25	A. Right. I mean, he thought it was a
0212
1	safer option.
2	Q. Well, in fact, she said -- Tammy
3	said that her dad didn't say that it was
4	healthier. He said it was not as bad as
5	full flavor; correct?
6	A. Yes. Right. You know, safer.
7	That would be safer than a regular
8	cigarette.
9	Q. That's your interpretation of it?
10	A. Yes. Less harmful.
11	Q. Still bad for you but --
12	A. Well, I mean --
13	Q. -- not as bad for you?
14	A. I mean, he's a person that clearly
15	is struggling -- you know, since we're
16	dealing with his individualized view, he's
17	struggling with this addiction. You know,
18	based on my review of the evidence, it's
19	clear that this person, from a layperson's
20	view, and I'm coming at this from a
21	layperson's view, was very addicted to
22	smoking and found it -- it's objective that
23	he found it very -- you know, he couldn't
24	quit.
25	And so, you know, my interpretation
0213
1	of that is he's struggling for anything that
2	will save him. And that's the fraud of the
3	light and the low-tar cigarettes is --
4	particularly for these smokers that it's put
5	out there as a -- as a -- something that
6	undermines quitting. It's a false life
7	raft, if you think of it that way. There's
8	lots of metaphors one could use to describe
9	it. This is not -- again, I'm not going to
10	give individualized assessments of his state
11	of mind, but since you've opened up this
12	line of inquiry, I —
13	Q. Well, I'm not trying to open up a
14	line of inquiry into addiction. I asked a
15	very specific question. And I want to make
16	clear if you're going to testify to that,
17	we're going to have to stay here longer to
18	talk about addiction issues.
19	A. Well, I don't intend to talk about
20	addiction, and I said that earlier.
21	Q. I mean, my only question to you was
22	that Tammy said that her dad told her that
23	lights are not as bad as full flavor. Do
24	you recall that testimony?
25	A. Yes. Yes.
0214
1	MR. THORNE: That's all.
2	THE WITNESS: Okay.
3	MR. THORNE: Thank you for your
4	time.
5	THE WITNESS: Are you almost there
6	or do you still need a couple more minutes?
7	I might duck into the restroom.
8	MR. COPPER: Go ahead.

10	(The time is 1:44 p.m.)

12	(Whereupon, a short break was
13	taken.)
14
15	(The time is 1:48 p.m.)
16
17	EXAMINATION
18	BY MR. COPPER:
19	Q. So there was some discussion
20	earlier about some of the promotional
21	merchandise you had seen references to, and
22	you had said that your understanding of the
23	practice was that in some instances
24	wholesalers would offer items that were
25	brand-specific items to retailers who were
0215
1	selling cigarettes; is that right?
2	A. Sure. You know, these are all part
3	of -- well, I mean, again, the wholesaler
4	and the jobber are simply, you know,
5	intermediaries that are between the
6	retailer, handle the distribution of the
7	product to the retailer and the
8	manufacturer. They work closely with the
9	manufacturer, and so when the manufacturer
10	has, for example, a promotion, that could be
11	a price promotion but it could also be a
12	merchandise promotion, you know, they're
13	going to work through, you know,
14	the wholesaler.
15	You know, often these are -- you
16	know, they go by names like candy companies
17	and they have all kinds of names. They're
18	often listed as plaintiffs --1 mean,
19	defendants in these courses to get a local
20	venue, to deliver these products to the
21	actual retail outlet. That's all.
22	But, you know, these are all
23	designed and implemented by the
24	manufacturer. You know, the extensive
25	marketing program and an extensive -- in the
0216
1	marketing department are very sensitive to
2	price promotions, study those extensively
3	and use that particular technique along with
4	other marketing and advertising techniques
5	to promote the product.
6	Q. Outside of the time when he was
7	working at the convenience stores, did you
8	see any evidence that Mr. Bowden accumulated
9	any merchandise that bore the label of a
10	specific cigarette brand?
11	A. Most of the merchandise, my senses,
12	dates from the '80s and the '90s, you know,
13	which is the period when he was no longer
14	working for the phone company and engaged in
15	a variety of occupations, sign painter,
16	clerk, a variety. I don't recall seeing
17	stuff that seemed to date before then, but
18	that simply could be an artifact of, you
19	know, what one saves and what one throws
20	away. It is -- you know, one point to
21	consider, the family did seem to move around
22	a little bit. Of course, one usually
23	lightens one's load. So the fact that there
24	isn't older stuff doesn't mean he didn't
25	receive older stuff.
0217
1	Q. You just didn't see case-specific
2	material that indicated that there were
3	products that bore the label of a particular
4	cigarette manufacturer that he acquired
5	outside of the time when he was working in
6	the convenience stores?
7	A. Well, again, you know, from the
8	'80s and the '90s, he was working
9	convenience stores a lot then but not
10	exclusively. He also did dip into the sign-
11	painting business. And there was also -- we
12	didn't talk about this, but I saw in his
13	employment record something with an
14	exterminator or something like that. So he
15	did -- you know, he had a lot of jobs.
16	So that's the best I can say,
17	because I haven't taken the time to perhaps
18	precisely date those marketing items, and
19	even if I did, and I'm talking about like a
20	specific year, even then we wouldn't know
21	exactly when he acquired them. So that
22	wouldn't be a fruitful exercise.
23	Q. Do you recall when his wife
24	testified about the paraphernalia and she
25	was asked where did you get it and she
0218
1	responded when my husband worked at Hess, I
2	don't know if it was distributors or who it
3	was that would come in there and they would
4	give him this merchandise of cigarettes?
5	A. Right. She did say that. But some
6	of the items clearly predate his time at
7	Hess. You know, there's some older items
8	from the '80s, but, yeah, she did say that.
9	Q. Professor, you've seen evidence
10	that some people believed, even in the
11	1800s, that quitting the use of tobacco
12	could be very difficult, have you not?
13	A. Yeah. There's always been an anti-
14	tobacco narrative in American history. You
15	know, it's always had its critics. You can
16	find them if you look hard enough.
17	Q. Are you familiar with Google Books?
18	A. I am.
19	Q. And what is your understanding of
20	what Google Books is?
21	A. Google Books is an effort by
22	Google, the internet technology company,
23	working with the university libraries and
24	other libraries to digitize world libraries.
25
0219
1	(Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit No.
2	10 was marked for identification and same is
3	attached hereto.)
4
5	Q. I'll hand you what's been marked as
6	Exhibit 10, which is a copy of a book from
7	Google Books entitled, The Bane of the Times
8	from 1861. First of all, is your
9	understanding of Google Books that it's in
10	the public domain?
11	A. Things before 1924 are. Things
12	after 1924 aren't.
13	Q. Okay.
14	A. As a rule.
15	Q. Okay. This particular book is
16	found in the Harvard College Library.
17	A. Is that the stamp? Yeah, that's
18	right.
19	Q. Okay. And on the cover, there's a
20	quote that says, "Snuffing, smoking and
21	chewing are bad habits, and we advise any
22	gentleman who is not hopelessly addicted to
23	either, to give it up."
24	A. Yes, you read that correctly.
25	Q. So in 1861 this appears to be -- or
0220
1	recognizing that some people are addicted to
2	tobacco; is that right?
3	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
4	the form.
5	A. Well, he uses that term, yeah.
6	And, of course, this is a religious sermon,
7	and part of an essentially religious, moral
8	critique of tobacco is that it was -- it
9	could be addictive. You know, given the
10	levels of use of tobacco in the 19th Century
11	and then of course in the 20th Century,
12	these were not particularly persuasive
13	sermons.
14	Q. This 1861 was before Americans were
15	smoking cigarettes in great numbers; is that
16	fair?
17	A. That is fair, yeah. That's
18	accurate.
19
20	(Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit No.
21	11 was marked for identification and same is
22	attached hereto.)
23
24	Q. You've been handed what's been
25	marked as Exhibit 11, another book from
0221
1	Google Books. This one is entitled, Public
2	Health Bulletin, and this was found in the
3	library of the University of Michigan; is
4	that correct?
5	A. That's the stamp, yeah.
6	Q. And this is a collection of studies
7	performed by the U.S. Public Health Service
8	early in the 20th Century; is that right?
9	A. It looks like it.
10	Q. There is a reference on the third
11	page, in fact, to typhoid fever as causation
12	and prevention?
13	A. Yes, Safe Disposable -- pardon me.
14	"Safe Disposal of Human Excreta at Unsewered
15	Homes." That's a particularly powerful
16	title.
17	Q. So in the second decade of the 20th
18	Century, the U.S. Public Health Service was
19	still dealing with public health problems
20	like safe disposal of human excrement in
21	unsewered homes?
22	A. That's right, yeah. C.W. Stiles
23	was a great -- is important in the history
24	of eliminating the hookworm from American
25	life, which is transmitted that way.
0222
1	Q. And we have excerpted then just
2	past that a 1915 report prepared by the U.S.
3	Public Health Service at the direction of
4	the U.S. Surgeon General. Do you see that?
5	A. I do.
6	Q. And so as of 1915, we had a Surgeon
7	General; is that right?
8	A. Surgeon Generals go back to the
9	19th Century, yes. I mean, they go back
10	quite a way.
11	Q. And the Public Health Service
12	prepared reports for the Surgeon General on
13	matters of public health?
14	A. That's correct.
15	Q. And if I can direct your attention
16	to page 26 --
17	A. I'm here.
18	Q. I'm sorry. I believe it's actually
19	27. This table at the bottom is discussing
20	the use of tobacco amongst male garment
21	workers; is that right?
22	A. Uh-huh.
23	Q. And, actually, if you look at table
24	10, it shows that 52.5 percent were
25	occasional smokers, 2.7 percent were --
0223
1	sorry. Strike that question.
2	A. What you're looking at, occasional
3	smokers are 2.7 percent.
4	Q. Right.
5	A. What they describe as habitual
6	smokers are 45.8 percent and then nonsmokers
7	are 52.5 percent. That's the explication
8	of the table.
9	Q. And then underneath it, it says,
10	"It will be seen from the above table that
11	of the 2,072 male workers, 1,068, or 51.5
12	were nonsmokers; and 948, or 45.8 percent,
13	were habitual smokers. It is seen that the
14	habit of smoking is not unusually prevalent
15	among male garment workers, the number of
16	nonsmokers exceeding the number of those
17	smoking." Did I read that right?
18	A. You read that correct.
19	Q. So even though nearly half of the
20	male garment workers were either occasional
21	or regular smokers, they say that habit of
22	smoking is not unusually prevalent among the
23	male garment workers; is that right?
24	A. Right. Yeah. This is only two
25	years after the introduction of the Camel
0224
1	cigarette which is, of course, the first
2	cigarette designed to be specifically
3	inhaled because of abuse from the use of
4	tobacco.
5	Q. And yet already in 1915, male
6	smoking prevalence in the United States was
7	already quite high; right?
8	A. Well, now, the next table tells you
9	what they're smoking. There's pipes, cigar
10	smokers. So most are smoking cigarettes,
11	yes. But, yeah, these people are smoking.
12	Q. And in the discussion that you
13	referenced, the Public Health Service found
14	that among the habitual smokers, 94.6
15	percent of them smoked cigarettes and they
16	smoked an average of 10.3 cigarettes per
17	day?
18	A. That's what the table--well, let
19	me find the per day. Is that another --
20	yeah, the 94.6. I'm not sure maybe because
21	of my -- this is hard to read. Where are
22	you getting the per day?
23	Q. It's in the -- I'm sorry. The
24	paragraph at the top of page 28.
25	A. Oh, I see. I was trying to divide
0225
1	it from the table. Okay. Yeah, that's what
2	they report. And then they go on to talk
3	about cigars and others, yeah.
4	Q. Right. And it goes on to say, "It
5	is seen that cigarette smoking is by far the
6	most popular form of tobacco addiction among
7	male garment workers. The kind of
8	cigarettes most preferred by these workers
9	were Turkish cigarettes"; isn't that right?
10	A. That's correct.
11	Q. So this 1915 report to the Surgeon
12	General by the U.S. Public Health Service
13	referred to habitual cigarette smoking as a
14	form of tobacco addiction; right?
15	A. They use that phrase. That's
16	correct, yeah.
17	Q. Turkish cigarettes, they're made of
18	Turkish tobacco?
19	A. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you would
20	have had, you know, more popular in Europe
21	than they were in the United States. Of
22	course, garment worker populations are, you
23	know, almost exclusively immigrant and
24	almost exclusively located in New York City,
25	and this would be at a transitionary period
0226
1	in the history of the types of cigarettes.
2	The American blended cigarettes are only
3	just now getting started, Camel, Lucky
4	Strike, Chesterfield, Old Gold all
5	introduced in the teens.
6	Q. Before U.S. blended cigarettes
7	became the most popular, Turkish cigarettes
8	were the most popular cigarettes in America;
9	correct?
10	A. I don't know if they were the most
11	popular but they were a popular. You know,
12	brands like Murad, for example, Fatima,
13	which has explicitly, you know -- oriental
14	names tend to be heavier smoked and by what
15	people report.
16	Q. And at the end of that paragraph on
17	page 20 that we're looking at, it says,
18	"Several instances of irregular and
19	intermittent action of the heart,
20	brachycardia, tachycardia and a number of
21	cases of chronic pharyngitis and laryngitis
22	thought to be due to excessive smoking were
23	observed among male garment workers." Did I
24	read that right?
25	A. Yeah, you read that correctly.
0227
1	Q. And so in this 1915 report to the
2	Surgeon General, the U.S. Public Health
3	Service identified a variety of health
4	conditions thought to be due to excessive
5	smoking?
6	A. They talk about it the way you read
7	it, yes.
8	Q. I have just a few more.
9	A. Okay.
10
11	(Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit No.
12	12 was marked for identification and same is
13	attached hereto.)
14
15	Q. You've been handed what's been
16	marked as Exhibit 12, another from Google
17	Books. This one from 1883 entitled, Health
18	Notes for Students." Do you see the
19	reference to 1883 on what is the fourth page
20	in?
21	A. That's a publication here, yes.
22	Q. And this is authorized by Burt G.
23	Wilder, M.D.?
24	A. That's the author, yes.
25	Q. And he was a professor of
0228
1	physiology at Cornell University at the
2	medical school in Maine?
3	A. That's what it says.
4	Q. And if we go to the preface at
5	Roman numeral III --
6	A. Uh-huh. I see it.
7	Q. -- it references that, "The
8	following notes form the basis of four of
9	the six Lectures on Hygiene, which are
10	attended by nearly all the students of
11	Cornell University, early in the first term
12	of their first year. The other two lectures
13	are based upon 'Emergencies: How to avoid
14	them, and how to beat them'"; is that right?
15	A. You read that correctly.
16	Q. And under Roman numeral VI, it's
17	the list of table of contents, and one of
18	the chapters was on bad effects of smoking
19	on the young. That is about two-thirds of
20	the way down the page and references
21	starting on page 44.
22	A. Yes. Under the heading "Stimulants
23	and Narcotics," yes.
24	Q. And then if we go to page 47, it
25	reads: "As stated in The Tribune of August
0229
1	26, a reporter for that journal elicited the
2	following opinions from 'a well-known
3	physician who has made diseases of the lungs
4	and air-passages his special study', and is
5	himself a smoker: 'More than 90 percent of
6	the men who smoke cigarettes habitually
7	inhale the smoke, and that is where the
8	great harm and peril to the smoker lie."
9	Did I read that correctly?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. So we have a book published in 1883
12	which reports that more than 90 percent of
13	cigarette smokers inhale; is that right?
14	A. Well, it's not based on anything
15	but what a reporter elicited from one
16	source, but you read that correctly.
17	Q. This is 30 years before the
18	introduction of the American blend cigarette
19	in 1913; right?
20	A. That's true, yes.
21	Q. And in 1883, it was reported that
22	inhalation of tobacco smoke is where the
23	greatest harm and peril lie?
24	A. Well, that -- yes. That is a
25	reasonable statement, yes.
0230
1	Q. It goes on to say on page 47 of
2	this document that: "Moderation in
3	cigarette-smoking? There is no such thing .
4	. . One can make the general rule that it is
5	far'" -- I'm sorry -- "One can make the
6	general rule that it is far the most
7	injurious form of smoking, and that no one
8	can indulge in it to any extent without
9	falling into dangerous excess." Did I read
10	that right?
11	A. You read that correctly. There
12	were many critics of the cigarette.
13	Particularly in the 1880s, there was an
14	anti-cigarette league. I mean, the
15	cigarette was seen as a gateway drug to even
16	more significant vices like alcohol, and as
17	you probably know, they successfully banned
18	it in a number of states for a period of
19	time.
20	Q. And in 1883, it was reported that,
21	"There was no such thing as moderation in
22	cigarette smoking. No one could start
23	smoking without falling into dangerous
24	excess."
25	A. You read that correct.
0231
1	Q. And that's one way of saying that
2	initiating cigarette smoking is likely to
3	lead to addiction?
4	A. Sure. That was the meaning of this
5	document. You know, the issue is not were
6	there critics of smoking, were there people
7	that presciently identified the harms of
8	smoking, even cancer and the stuff before
9	the modem age? Of course, there are. But
10	what impact did they have? We just have to
11	look at the use of cigarettes, smoking
12	prevalence over the course of the 20th
13	Century to get your answer. It increases
14	dramatically.
15	Q. This is another document from
16	Google Books that we'll mark as Exhibit 13.
17
18	(Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit No.
19	13 was marked for identification and same is
20	attached hereto.)
21
22	Q. You've been handed what's been
23	marked as Exhibit 13 from The Chicago
24	Medical Journal Examiner from 1887; is that
25	right?
0232
1	A. That's the date indicated on the
2	document.
3	Q. Okay. If you'll look at this
4	excerpt, if you look to page 356, which is
5	the second to last page --
6	A. The second to last page. I'm
7	there.
8	Q. — where it says, "The Deleterious
9	Effects of Tobacco on the Throat and Nose,"
10	Professor M.F. Coomes, of Louisville,
11	Kentucky, said, that he considered smoking
12	far more injurious to these parts than
13	chewing. "Cigarette smoking is especially
14	injurious, because the smoke is so
15	universally inhaled, causing pharyngitis,
16	laryngitis, and chronic irritation in the
17	nose, not to mention the injury it may
18	occasion to trachea and lungs. Ninety-five
19	per centum of smokers have something
20	abnormal or unhealthy about the upper
21	air-passages." Did I read that correctly?
22	A. You did. You read it correctly.
23	Q. So in 1887 a professor is quoted in
24	The Chicago Medical Journal saying that
25	cigarette smoking is especially injurious
0233
1	because the smoke from cigarettes is
2	universally inhaled; is that correct?
3	A. Right. And then they go on to say
4	that, you know, basically if you don't
5	inhale them, they're less harmful than any
6	other form of tobacco.
7	Q. And he also said that the
8	inhalation of cigarette smoke can injure the
9	trachea and lungs; is that correct?
10	A. That's what it says. And then it
11	goes on to say, "Dr. L. Brown smokes
12	cigarettes, and considers them less harmful
13	than any other form, if we don't inhale the
14	smoke, and use a fresh mouthpiece."
15	Q. Just one more.
16	A. I have not seen this one. This is
17	a good one.
18
19	(Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit No.
20	14 was marked for identification and same is
21	attached hereto.)
22
23	MR. THORNE: What did you say about
24	1924?
25	A. Oh -- this is off the record.
0234
1	MR. THORNE: Yeah.
2
3	(The time is 2:13 p.m.)
4
5	(Whereupon, an off-the-record
6	discussion was held.)
7
8	(The time is 2:14 p.m.)
9
10	Q. You've been handed what's been
11	marked as Exhibit 14, which is a excerpt of
12	the St. Louis Courier of Medicine Journal.
13	A. Yes, I see it.
14	Q. "Volume IX" from 1883; right?
15	A. Uh-huh.
16	Q. And on page 13--
17	A. Okay. I'm there.
18	Q. It states: "The magnitude of this
19	vise is amble apology for the appearance of
20	the least pretentious article bearing on it;
21	and I may add, by way of securing some
22	attention, that I was myself for fifteen
23	years addicted to it, and have never lost
24	any opportunity of examining the nose,
25	throat, and windpipe of a cigarette smoker."
0235
1	Did I read that correctly?
2	A. Yes, you did.
3	Q. So we have a medical doctor in 1883
4	writing in this medical journal that he had
5	been addicted to cigarette smoking for 15
6	years; right?
7	A. That's what he reports.
8	Q. And on page 14 it reads: "If
9	general laws could be formulated, taking
10	common consent as to what excess and
11	moderation mean, they might be written as
12	follows: Tobacco is harmful to 99 percent
13	addicted to its excessive use, to 50 percent
14	addicted to moderate use, and to 10 percent
15	using it in the smallest quantity." Did I
16	read that right?
17	A. Yes. Yes, you read that correctly.
18	Q. And then he goes on beginning on
19	page 14 and moving on to 15 to say: "If the
20	smoker did not very sensibly feel the
21	contact of the smoke with his larynx and
22	windpipe, his pleasure would not exist.
23	Certain kinds of tobacco do not cause this
24	subjective irritation, and are therefore
25	avoided, as are also those kinds which
0236
1	irritate too much. Tobacco in the form of a
2	cigar, or in a pipe, belongs to this latter
3	class, and is thus seldom used. This
4	pleasurable irritation must therefore be of
5	a certain grade, and that habitue chooses
6	his tobacco and paper, or ready-made
7	cigarette accordingly. I repeat that the
8	pleasure of cigarette smoking is found in
9	inhalation, and were it not so, cigarettes
10	would almost cease to exist, for smoked in
11	the ordinary way, they soon become insipid,
12	and are thus only used by smokers en
13	amateur." Did I read that correctly?
14	A. Yes. It's habitue, H-A-B-I-T-U-E,
15	with an accent.
16	Q. Thank you for clarifying my
17	pronunciation.
18	A. It's a French term. Yeah, you read
19	that correctly. There are always, you know,
20	critics of cigarettes. That's true.
21	Q. Well, we have a medical doctor
22	writing in a medical journal in 1883 that
23	the pleasure of cigarette smoking comes from
24	inhaling the smoke; right?
25	A. Uh-huh.
0237
1	Q. And he stated that without the
2	inhalation of cigarette smoke people would
3	not smoke cigarettes?
4	A. Well, I think that's -- yes, I
5	agree with that proposition. He did state
6	that, yes.
7	Q. And he made these observations
8	about both roll-your-own cigarettes and
9	manufactured cigarettes; right?
10	A. Well, you know, people that were
11	using products made for tobacco that had a
12	pH profile conducive to what's perceived as
13	mild that's an inhalation, you know, would
14	tend to inhale. Uh-huh, that's true.
15	Q. And in 1883 many of the cigarettes
16	that were smoked in the United States were
17	roll-your-own cigarettes; right?
18	A. Yes. I mean, yeah, people rolled
19	their own. They were hand-rolled. After
20	1883 Bonsack, you know, the availability of
21	machine-made. Yeah, there's a variety of
22	products on the market.
23	Q. And in 1838 it was recognized that
24	nearly all habitual cigarette smokers
25	inhaled; correct?
0238
1	A. In 1883 this document makes that
2	statement. I don't know if I would take it
3	the way you put it, which is to take this
4	individual document and extrapolate for
5	everybody. There are many different types
6	of tobaccos out there at this time.
7	Q. It was recognized in 1883 that
8	inhalation was an essential affect of the
9	satisfaction of smoking cigarettes; correct?
10	A. In this document they make that
11	statement, yes, uh-huh.
12	Q. It says if there was no irritation,
13	then the cigarette would not be satisfying.
14	It was recognizing that; correct?
15	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
16	the form.
17	A. Yeah, I'm not sure what that means.
18	I don't know if I completely understand the
19	meaning of that statement, but that is what
20	the text indicates.
21	Q. And, in fact, it indicates that if
22	there was too much indication as in the case
23	of a cigar, then a smoker wouldn't like it;
24	is that correct?
25	A. Right. I guess what they're
0239
1	referring to here is that, you know, cigars
2	are not generally inhaled, although some
3	people do inhale cigars. I've read research
4	that 10 percent of cigar smokers, mostly
5	ex-cigarette smokers, do inhale cigar
6	smoke. There's var -- you know, human
7	variation in all of these things.
8	Q. Now, in the 1880s, you would agree
9	that it was in the public domain that the
10	type of tobacco used determined the smoker's
11	impact?
12	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
13	the form.
14	A. That's a pretty vague question.
15	You might want to work on that one again. I
16	mean, that's --
17	Q. I'll rephrase.
18	A. That one doesn't even --
19	Q. Would you agree that some refer to
20	the irritation of the throat caused by
21	smoking as the impact?
22	A. Well, irritation is a constant
23	feature -- well, let me put in this way.
24	20th Century cigarette manufacturers,
25	particularly in the first half of the
0240
1	tobacco epidemic, advertise heavily on the
2	lack of irritation, not a cough in the
3	carload, it's toasted for your throat
4	protection, you know, these were all
5	slogans. And so to persuade people to
6	overcome the initial irritation of smoking
7	so that they develop a more sustained
8	engagement with the product, to use a kind
9	of roundabout way to put it, was a major
10	goal of advertising. And I think all that
11	this document recognizes is that for many
12	people, you know, the hot smoke of
13	cigarettes, pipes, and cigars, all of them
14	can be quite harsh, at least in terms of how
15	people perceive it.
16	Q. You would agree that by 1883
17	inhalability of cigarette smoke was already
18	an intentional aspect of cigarettes
19	designed?
20	A. No, I don't think it was an
21	intentional aspect at that time. I think --
22	there are many blends of tobacco that are
23	competing. You know, the process of flue
24	curing, which is the key tobacco that
25	produces a mildly acidic smoke on the pH
0241
1	scale, and therefore, it's perceived as mild
2	by the lungs in the human body --1 mean,
3	flue curing is mentioned in the antebellum
4	period.
5	So the technology of flue curing
6	exists in the 1830s in Caswell County, North
7	Carolina. It's out there, you know. It's
8	part of the mix that the early Duke Tobacco
9	Company is using. This is when George
10	Washington Duke is there with his sons at
11	the end of the Civil War selling tobacco to
12	the union soldiers. All of this stuff is
13	done kind of on a folk basis. There's lots
14	of individualistic blends as you indicated.
15	A lot of the stuff is hand-rolled. You can
16	always find examples of different kinds of
17	tobacco.
18	But until you get to the
19	introduction of the modern American blended
20	cigarette, you don't get the widespread and
21	pervasive use of a cigarette that is, you
22	know, designed, you know, to be inhaled.
23	This is at a time when cigarette
24	use is infinitesimal in American life. By
25	far people are using cigars, and most
0242
1	importantly, they're chewing tobacco. That
2	is the single largest category of tobacco
3	use. So this is at a time when people are
4	identifying these characteristics, they
5	exist in some products, they don't. But the
6	cigarette is such a marginal product in
7	terms of the number of people that use it,
8	it's well-nigh irrelevant to the 20th
9	Century experience.
10	Q. You had mentioned briefly flavored
11	cigarettes earlier. There's no indication
12	in this case that Mr. Bowden ever smoked a
13	flavored cigarette; is that right?
14	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
15	the form.
16	A. If I said flavored, I meant, you
17	know, blends of tobacco. I wasn't referring
18	to, you know, like sweeteners or things like
19	that. But, no, Mr. Bowden, you know, smoked
20	the brands that we have discussed over the
21	course of our day today and that does not
22	include menthols.
23	Now, there are flavorants in the
24	Camel and the Lucky Strike, you know,
25	ranging from licorice to cardamom and other
0243
1	spices. But, yeah, as flavored as
2	contemporarily understood to have a strong
3	single flavor sweetness or what have you,
4	no, I don't think he used --1 don't see
5	evidence of those products.
6	Q. It's not your opinion that had
7	Mr. Bowden smoked a menthol cigarette
8	instead of the types of cigarettes that he
9	smoked that he would have quit smoking
10	earlier; correct?
11	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Object to
12	the form.
13	A. I have no opinion on that. No,
14	that's not --1 just have no opinion on
15	that. It goes in with the earlier line of
16	questioning. I'm not going to offer kind of
17	hypothetical medical testimony for him.
18	Q. When Mr. Bowden started smoking,
19	there was no commercially-available
20	cigarette available to Mr. Bowden that was
21	any less addictive than the cigarettes that
22	he smoked; correct?
23	MS. V ALLE JOS - NICHOLS: I'm going to
24	object to the form.
25	A. I'd have to double check on the
0244
1	date of Sano, which was a denicotinized
2	cigarette. I believe Sano was available
3	then.
4	Q. All right. Is there any evidence
5	in the materials that you reviewed for this
6	case that Mr. Bowden ever sought out a Sano
7	cigarette?
8	A. No. No.
9	Q. Let's move forward to the 1950s.
10	When Mr. Bowden was smoking in the 1950s,
11	was there any commercially-available
12	cigarette available to Mr. Bowden that was
13	less addictive than the cigarettes that he
14	smoked?
15	A. Again, I think Sano was made and
16	sold during this period. I mean, there were
17	denicotinized cigarettes or cigarettes
18	without nicotine. Those were available on
19	the market.
20	Q. Was Sano sold throughout the United
21	States?
22	A. I'm not sure. I don't know --1
23	haven't done the research on its
24	distribution.
25	Q. Do you know if it was sold in the
0245
1	state of Florida during the 1950s?
2	A. I don't know. I just don't know.
3	I haven't done that research.
4	Q. Let's move forward to the 1970s.
5	When Mr. Bowden was smoking in the 1970s,
6	was there any commercially-available
7	cigarette available to Mr. Bowden that was
8	any less addictive than the cigarettes that
9	he smoked in the 1970s?
10	A. I'm just not really sure. I don't
11	know when --1 don't know when the end point
12	for the sale of this denicotinized cigarette
13	was, if any. I'm just not sure. I haven't
14	thought about that issue. I haven't
15	considered it.
16	Q. And then during the 1980s, when
17	Mr. Bowden was smoking during the 1980s, was
18	there any commercially-available cigarette
19	available to Mr. Bowden that was any less
20	addictive than the cigarettes that he
21	smoked?
22	A. Again, I'm not sure. I haven't
23	done that research. So -- and I don't
24	intend to offer an opinion on that. I kind
25	of see that as a little bit on the frontier
0246
1	of my expertise.
2	MR. COPPER: Subject to any follow-
3	up, I believe that's all the questions I
4	have. Thank you very much, Professor.
5	THE WITNESS: Okay.
6	MR. THORNE: One last, Professor.
7	EXAMINATION
8	BY MR. THORNE:
9	Q. You left me sitting here for so
10	long, I had to come up with one more. I
11	just want to clarify. Have we covered all
12	of the opinions that you have as it relates
13	to Mr. Bowden in this case on case-specific
14	opinions?
15	A. I feel that we have, yes. I feel
16	confident about that.
17	MR. THORNE: Okay. No additional
18	questions. Thank you.
19	MS. V ALLE JOS - NICHOLS: Lynn, do you
20	want to ask any questions?
21	MR. FEIWUS: I do not.
22	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: Thank you.
23	I have a few.
24	MR. THORNE: Am I going to miss my
25	flight, Dawn?
0247
1	MS. V ALLE JOS - NICHOLS: Sorry. I'll
2	ask them very quickly.
3	EXAMINATION
4	BY MS. V ALLE JOS - NICHOLS:
5	Q. Professor Kyriakoudes, regarding
6	Exhibits 10 through 14 that were just
7	introduced to you, were all of these
8	documents published before the explosion of
9	the modem cigarette?
10	A. Yes, they were all -- and by
11	"modem cigarette," you mean the
12	introduction of Camel and similarly-designed
13	cigarettes which were introduced in 1913 and
14	afterwards? Yes, they are all from the 19th
15	Century, these documents.
16	Q. And were any of these documents
17	available to the general public?
18	MR. COPPER: Object to the fomi.
19	A. Well, I mean, you know, there's
20	specialized medical literature. They would
21	have been in, you know, tight circulation.
22	Not widely available, no.
23	Q. So none of the conclusions in these
24	documents from the 19th Century would have
25	been widely disseminated to the American
0248
1	public?
2	MR. THORNE: Object to the form.
3	MR. COPPER: Objection.
4	A. No. No. I mean, there was --
5	there wasn't anti-cigarette movements at
6	this time strongly tied to alcohol
7	prohibition, and I've testified on that
8	quite a bit. There always were critics of
9	cigarettes. One of the reasons why the
10	tobacco industry advertised so heavily after
11	1913 in promoting its products was largely
12	to overcome these objections, which based on
13	the number of people that took up smoking,
14	they weren't very successful in doing.
15	Q. Were the conclusions in these
16	documents that cigarettes were dangerous to
17	health and addictive ever accepted by the
18	tobacco industry during the lifetime of
19	Mr. Bowden?
20	MR. THORNE: Object to the form.
21	A. No, they were not.
22	Q. Did Mr. Bowden have access during
23	his lifetime to Google Books, the Harvard
24	Library, the University of Michigan Library
25	and the St. Louis Courier of Medicine, to
0249
1	your knowledge?
2	A. No, not to my knowledge.
3	Q. Did the tobacco industry ever admit
4	during the lifetime of Mr. Bowden that
5	smoking cigarettes would be harmful to 99
6	percent of smokers addicted to its use as
7	the -- let me get the author correct. As
8	Dr. J.C. Mulhall stated in Exhibit 14?
9	MR. THORNE: Object to the form.
10	A. No. They never agreed with that
11	conclusion and never admitted what their own
12	internal research indicated about the
13	extreme health risks and addictiveness of
14	cigarettes, and they never shared that
15	information that they knew privately within
16	their corporation with the public.
17	Q. Did the tobacco industry ever admit
18	during the lifetime of Mr. Bowden that their
19	products could addict smokers?
20	A. No. No, they never accepted that.
21	In fact, it mounted both on the issue of
22	disease and of addiction a public relations
23	advertising and misinformation campaign of
24	historical proportions to persuade the
25	public otherwise.
0250
1	Q. Is there any evidence in these
2	exhibits, and especially Exhibit 14, of
3	whether its authors actually conducted
4	scientific or medical reviews or experiments
5	that actual smokers to -- or did they simply
6	conclude -- excuse me. Strike that. Let's
7	start over.
8	Is there any evidence, and let's
9	start with Exhibit 14, of whether its author
10	actually conducted a scientific or medical
11	review of actual smokers, or is this article
12	simply the conclusion of its author?
13	MR. THORNE: Object to the form.
14	A. There's no indication of underlying
15	science, a systematic investigation,
16	experimentation, or what we could consider
17	to be science in any of these documents.
18	They are part of an anti-tobacco narrative
19	that was prevalent in the 19th Century that
20	was part of the anti-alcohol narrative of
21	the 19th Century.
22	Q. All right.
23	MS. VALLEJOS-NICHOLS: I'm going to
24	leave it there. I don't have anything
25	further. Thank you.
0251
1	MR. THORNE: Thank you, Professor.
2	Thanks, Dawn, for making it short.
